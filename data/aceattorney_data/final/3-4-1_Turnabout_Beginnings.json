And I kill her!Sorry, but you're not going to get the chance...*BANG!*I'm reading through the file of an old court case. It was the first case of my long-time mentor, Mia Fey...Fugitive DataName: Terry FawlesCharge: Kidnapping, Murder\nSentence: Death PenaltyFugitive MovementsAfter escaping, Fawles met with, and then murdered, Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, [sic] Recaptured on Eagle Mountain about 8 hours after his escape.Her very first client was a death row inmate who had recently broken out of prison. That was a whole year before Mia and I ever met.-- Six Years Earlier --Mia FeyFirst TrialFebruary 16, 9:24 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 4Mia:\n(Ugh... I'm so nervous. I feel like I'm going to die. I never should've accepted this case...) Eeeeeeek! ...Ah! G-G-Good morning! (Don't be so jumpy, Mia!)???:\nI-I din't do nuttin'! I swear! I din't kill nobody!Mia:\n(Terry Fawles... ...My first client. Sentenced to death 5 years ago, and now... a prison escapee.)Fawles:\n...Mia:\n(Just relax, Mia! Make small talk and try to relax him!) ...Err, umm... So why did you escape anyway?Fawles:\nAh. Ah. UGGA!Mia:\nEeeeek! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!Fawles:\n...Ugh. I din't do nuttin'! I din't kill nobody! I never... I never lie! I din't escape from nowhere!Mia:\nErr... But, Mr. Fawles... The police just recaptured you two days ago.Fawles:\n... Ugh. Sorry. I told a little lie.Mia:\n(Oh boy...)Fawles:\nBut anyway, I din't do it! I never killed nobody!Mia:\nUmm, sorry for asking but... You're on death row, right?Fawles:\nUh. Uh... UGGA!Mia:\nEeeeeek! I'm really, really sorry!Fawles:\nThey sentenced me to die 5 years ago! But I was tricked I tell you! That woman! She lied in her testimony! ...That's why I got the death penalty! I swear it! I din't kill her! I could never do that!Mia:\n(Two days ago, he escaped from the police wagon when it crashed... Then about 8 hours later... A policewoman was murdered before the police could recapture him. The police believe that Terry Fawles did it.) Umm... After you escaped, did you meet a policewoman?Fawles:\n... Yeah... I did. ...She's the reason I escaped.Mia:\n(So that much is true... He did meet with the victim.)Fawles:\nBut I din't kill her! She was alive when I left! She was alive...! It-It's true!Mia:\n(I can trust him... right? I mean, I should...)???:\nHa...! You're not going to figure out the truth by just staring at the guy...Mia:\nY-You're... Why are you here????:\nI came to see how our little kitten was doing all alone in the big, scary lion's den. ...I thought maybe you'd like someone to play with.Mia:\nErr, where is Mr. Grossberg????:\nHa...! That old man is probably still in bed. I bet he's clutching an empty bottle and mumbling in his sleep.Armando:\nAren't I good enough? After all, it's me... Diego Armando!Mia:\nI-I didn't say... So, Diego Armando, the finest attorney at Grossberg Law Offices, is here for me...?Armando:\nNo, no, no... You've got it all wrong! Today, YOU'RE the finest! After all, it took an amazing amount of guts to take this case! Imagine... An escaped death row convict for a first client!Mia:\nYeah, err... Th-Thanks. (I sure wish I could get out of it though!)Armando:\nHa...! Relax. I just heard some good news. The prosecutor for today is fresh out of his diapers as well.Mia:\nR-Really!?Armando:\nHowever... Unlike a certain somebody who I won't mention... ...he's earned the reputation as a \"genius\" since beginning his law career.Mia:\n(G-Genius...?)Armando:\nWell, it's about time to head in, Kitten. Sharpen those claws of yours. It's go time!Mia:\n(A solitary confinement cell for the condemned must be the world's loneliest place. ...And that's what my client ran away from. Every other lawyer gave up on him... But not me. When I saw those overflowing eyes and heard that simple, child-like voice... I just had the feeling that he was telling the truth.)February 16, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Terry Fawles.Mia:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.???:\nThe prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.Judge:\nI understand the lawyers for both sides are newcomers...?Mia:\nY-Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm Mia Fey.Edgeworth:\nMiles Edgeworth... Your Honor.Judge:\nSo you're the new prosecutor everyone is talking about, eh? They say you joined the prosecutor's office at quite an early age.Edgeworth:\nAt 20... Your Honor.Armando:\nI guess our little kitten hasn't earned herself much of a reputation yet, huh?Mia:\n(Come on, Mia! You can't lose! Not to someone younger than you!)Edgeworth:\n...Hmph.Judge:\nYoung people running a trial. I'm not too sure how I feel about that. ...Now then, the defendant in this case is currently a felon on death row. Two days ago, he escaped from a police wagon. Is that correct?Edgeworth:\nPrecisely.Armando:\nBut the defendant is not on trial for escaping prison. On the day that the defendant escaped, a policewoman was murdered...Mia:\nSo we're here to determine if Mr. Fawles was responsible for her death...?Armando:\nYou got it, Kitten.Judge:\nWell then, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's hear your opening statement.Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor. It was five years ago. The defendant, Terry Fawles, was sentenced to death in this very court. His crimes were kidnapping, extortion... and murder. The girl he threw off the bridge was only 14 years old.Judge:\nA truly horrible crime. I remember it well. There was no decisive evidence, so the trial was long and protracted.Edgeworth:\nCorrect. But in the end, what finally decided the case was... ...a certain witness's testimony.Mia:\nA witness's testimony...Edgeworth:\nThe testimony of Detective Valerie Hawthorne; the person who confronted this criminal. She arrested Mr. Fawles at the scene and later testified against him. She said she witnessed Mr. Fawles throw his young victim into the river. For those who are not aware, Eagle River is well-known for its powerful current. Most bodies that fall in are never recovered...Mia:\n(So Ms. Hawthorne's testimony was the one that put him away...)Judge:\nThat policewoman you just mentioned... That wouldn't be...?Edgeworth:\nExactly. The victim. The same woman that was killed 2 days ago... Police Sergeant... Valerie Hawthorne.Judge:\nAha...! I see... The man who was sentenced to death based on her testimony escaped two days ago... ...with only one thing on his mind. To take revenge against the woman who convicted him. ... Hmm... Aha! The truth is becoming clear to me now!Mia:\nHuh?Judge:\nYes, yes... It's quite obvious that the defendant is guilty.Mia:Mia:\nW-Wait a minute! That's not right! At least hear the case before you decide on the outcome, Your Honor!Judge:\nGrrrngh... Watch yourself, Ms. Fey! I'm not sure I care for your word choice, or your tone of voice.Edgeworth:\nYoung people these days simply don't know how to respect their elders.Mia:\n(Why you...! You're even younger than me, you hypocrite!)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Edgeworth, please call your first witness.Edgeworth:\nI call the detective who was in charge of the initial investigation of this case.Edgeworth:\nWitness... State your name and occupation.Gumshoe:\nGumshoe. Dick Gumshoe. I'm the homicide detective in charge of the case, sir! I finally got promoted to the detective division half a year ago!Mia:\nI don't believe anyone asked you about that.Gumshoe:\nHey, ma'am! You got any idea how much work it takes... ......Mia:\nWh-What is it?Gumshoe:\nYou... Y-You're really gorgeous...Mia:\nExcuse me?Gumshoe:\nNo, seriously... My heart... It's aching for you...Edgeworth:\nDetective. Pull yourself together and try to be professional. Otherwise... I'll write you up on contempt so quick that something other than your heart will ache!Gumshoe:\nUrk... O-OK, I-I got it!Judge:\n...Now, Detective. Tell us about the incident.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! Right away! The victim was Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, a veteran on the police force. She was stabbed in the back with a knife and died from excessive blood loss.Judge:\nThat much is already stated in the autopsy report. The court would like to hear more details about the incident itself.Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! I gotcha! OK! Let's take a look at this aerial map of the area here! This is a sketch of Dusky Bridge, an old suspension bridge. And the river that runs under there is Eagle River. The victim and the defendant met there... On top of the bridge. After stabbing her in the back, the killer carried the victim back to his car. He was recaptured at a police checkpoint as he was trying to make his getaway, sir.Judge:\nHmm... I see...Dusky Bridge Map added to the Court Record.Judge:\nWas the victim's blood found on the bridge?Gumshoe:\nThe victim, Sergeant Valerie Hawthorne, was wearing a thick coat, sir. Unfortunately, no traces of blood were found on the bridge.Judge:\nHmm... Mr. Edgeworth. I warn you that I absolutely despise conjecture. If there was no blood on the bridge, then you have no proof that they even met there!Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. If you would listen to the testimony we have prepared, I'm sure you'll be convinced. The two of them most certainly did meet on the bridge that day...Judge:\nWhy, Mr. Edgeworth... I'm not sure I like you wagging your finger at me as though I were some hoser! Detective, proceed with your testimony!Gumshoe:\nUm... Yes, sir!Mia:\n(Here we go, Mia! Hang on...!)Armando:\nOK now... Listen carefully, Kitten. One little mistake and this guy will drink you for morning tea! Trust me and get ready.Witness Testimony-- Summary of the Incident --Gumshoe:\nOn the day of the incident, an unknown person phoned the sergeant and asked to meet.\nSergeant Hawthorne went to Dusky Bridge at the designated time and met with Mr. Fawles.\nAnd that's where she was brutally murdered, sir.\nThe criminal stuffed her body into his car trunk and tried to make a getaway.\nMr. Fawles was arrested at a police checkpoint we set up at the base of the mountain.Judge:\nHmm... Well, you certainly have established the importance of the bridge.Edgeworth:\n...Naturally.Judge:\nNow, would the defense please hurry up and proceed with the cross-examination.Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor! C-C-Cross-examination... Coming right up!Armando:\nHey, hey! Settle down there, Kitten! If you keep trembling like that, you're gonna make me spill my coffee!Mia:\nI-I-I'm not t-trembling! It-It-It's just cold in here!Armando:\nThe courtroom can be a cold battlefield alright. Especially... for a beginner.Mia:\nI-I don't need you to worry about me...! I mean... I mean, the defendant, the witness... everyone's a beginner in here!Armando:\nHa...! You got me there. But maybe you should keep your claws out, and show them what you've got... Kitten.Mia:\n(It's OK, Mia. Stay calm... Just remember those court procedure videos you stayed up all last night watching!)Cross Examination",

I told a little lie.\n\n\nGumshoe:\n...Or something like that.\nMia:\n...\nJudge:\nWell, in any case, it seems he was caught and arrested.\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely.Present Victim's Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Witness!\"Gumshoe:\nMr. Fawles was arrested at a police checkpoint we set up at the base of the mountain.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nThat certainly is some impressive police work.\nGumshoe:\nWell, no, actually it was way too close for comfort. We set up that checkpoint just after 5:00 PM... We figured that Mr. Fawles might just try to run.\nMia:\n...What do you mean it was too close for comfort?\nEdgeworth:\nThe two of them arranged to meet at 4:30 PM. And it takes approximately 30 minutes to go from the bridge to the checkpoint.\nMia:\n(Hmm... That WAS kinda close. Any later and Mr. Fawles could have slipped right by.)Armando:\nListen up, Kitten. There's a big trap waiting for you in that testimony.Mia:\nA t-trap?Armando:\nWalk into it carelessly, and it'll leave more than just a flesh wound. Fun, huh?Mia:\nNo, it's NOT!Armando:\nWell, if you want to have any chance at all, you'd better get some more information. And if you're going to get caught in a trap, it's best to get caught early. You can always look for contradictions afterwards.Mia:\n(The ever-famous \"contradictions\". I sure hope I can find some of those...)Mia:\n...Witness! ............Gumshoe:\n............Edgeworth:\n............Judge:\n............ Wh-What is it...? Do you have something to say, Ms. Fey!?Mia:\nI-I'm sorry! I-I totally forgot what I was going to say... This is... This is the first time I've ever had to actually address someone like that...Judge:\nGrrgh... You should have practiced before coming to court! Honestly, Ms. Fey... I'm not sure I like this!Armando:\nHmph...! Say there, little Kitten, want a piece of my coffee candy?Mia:\nCandy?Armando:\nWell, you're still too young to be drinking real coffee.Mia:\n(Grrr... Come on, Mia! Shake it off! You're a lawyer!) Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, ma'am!Mia:\nThis photo... You said that there was nothing peculiar about it. ...Is that correct?Gumshoe:\nY-Yeah, that's what I said!Mia:\nWell then, I suggest you take another look at the note written by the victim!Gumshoe:\nThe n-n-note...?Mia:\nIt very clearly says, \"Wear white scarf for identification.\"... The caller must have forgotten what the victim looked like. Thus, this special request.Gumshoe:\nAaah... I, umm...!Mia:\nI have one very simple question for you, Detective. Where is the white scarf? I can't seem to find it in this photo...Gumshoe:\nUm... Well, to be honest, we didn't find it in the trunk, ma'am...Mia:\nAnd you stopped there!? You should have looked for it!Gumshoe:\nAaaaaaarrrggg...!Judge:\nThe caller told her to wear it to identify herself, so I'd expect she did just that! Well, Mr. Edgeworth!? What do you have to say about this!?Edgeworth:\n*sigh* I see the defense is a little... lacking.Mia:\n...!Edgeworth:\nThe scarf you are searching so desperately for... ...Is it this one, perchance?Mia:\n...Ah!Gumshoe:\nWh-Where did you find that, sir!?Edgeworth:\nOn Dusky Bridge. I was there first, and decided to conduct my own investigation.Gumshoe:\nWh-Why...? Why didn't you tell me?Edgeworth:\nI made a decision to keep all pieces of evidence in my personal satchel. It's the safest place I know.Armando:\nHmph! That hot-shot sure has a flair for the dramatic...Edgeworth:\nIt's not exactly \"white\", as the caller requested... But as you can see, it's close enough, for what it was intended for.Judge:\nHmmm... It looks like it spent some time in the mud.Edgeworth:\nNot surprising... It was drizzling on the mountain that day.Mia:\n(Prosecutor Edgeworth... He was intentionally hiding that scarf the whole time!)Judge:\nThe court will accept the scarf into evidence.Scarf added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nNow, if the attorney for the defense is finished embarrassing herself... ...I'd like to move on with the testimony. That IS alright with you, isn't it, Ms. Fey?Mia:\n(Boy would I like to wrap this scarf around his smarmy little neck...)Edgeworth:\nVery good. Now, if we're done with this mud-covered scarf business... ...the prosecution moves to establish conclusively, and with hard evidence that... ...Ms. Hawthorne and Mr. Fawles did indeed meet on that bridge that day. Further, we will show exactly what occurred there.Judge:\nThat sounds quite promising. I can't wait to hear all about it.Mia:\n(Argh... Everything is moving at his whim...)Armando:\nDon't forget, Kitten. There's a reason why everyone considers this kid a genius.Mia:\n(A genius, huh...)Witness Testimony-- Events on Dusky Bridge --Gumshoe:\nActually, there's an eyewitness who was there when the incident took place.\nThis photo was accidentally taken by the witness. It shows the vic wearing the scarf, sir. (Changed from [This photo was accidentally taken by the witness. It shows her wearing the scarf, sir.] in the original release)\nIt was drizzling that day; unfortunately, it's a little hard to see what's going on.\nAnyway, the criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back!\n...That must have been when the scarf fell off.Judge:\nHmm. Looking at this photo... ...you really get the sense that this bridge is very high up.Edgeworth:\nIt is about a 40 feet drop from the bridge to the Eagle River down below.Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth, who took this photo anyway?Edgeworth:\nLet's just say that it was a well-intentioned third party.Judge:\nAha! A potential witness! So why isn't this person in the courtroom?Gumshoe:\nWell... They said they absolutely did not want to testify.Edgeworth:\n...The person in question is very delicate, Your Honor. Besides, as long as we have this photo, we see no reason to compel her to testify.Judge:\n... I'm not sure how I feel about that!Witness's Photo added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nSo, as you can see, Terry Fawles had both the motive and the opportunity. I think it's quite clear at this point what happened on that bridge.Judge:\n... Hmm. Aha! The truth is becoming clear to me now!Mia:\nHuh?Judge:\nYes, it's quite obvious. He's clearly guilty.Mia:\nN-Not again! That's not fair! I haven't even done my cross-examination yet!Judge:\nHmm...Mia:\n(What do you mean, \"Hmm\"!?)Cross Examination",

Meaning she's \"female\" AND a \"college student\", ma'am! She doesn't do well in front of other people, so I came to testify for her.\nMia:\nMaybe so! But as the attorney for the defense, I have the right to cross-examine her...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nFor the time being, we're not relying on the witness's statements... That is all.\nMia:\nWh-What is that supposed to mean!?\nEdgeworth:\n...The prosecution has other, more decisive evidence. Our case doesn't rest on the vague testimony of a female college student.\nJudge:\nA female college student, eh.\nGumshoe:\nIt means she's \"female\" AND a \"college student\", sir!\nEdgeworth:\nIf you absolutely must hear her testimony, you'll have to give us a good reason why.\nMia:\nGrrr...\nJudge:\nPlease tell us about the more decisive evidence in question.Gumshoe:\nThis photo was accidentally taken by the witness.

What was this person doing all the way in the mountains?\nGumshoe:\nShe was taking photos of wild flowers apparently.\nEdgeworth:\nThere are many unusual types of flora on that mountain, Ms. Fey. People in the area say it's because of the spirits that live there.\nJudge:\nS-S-Spirits! Now that you mention it, th-this photo... This cloudy fog-like thing... Is-Is it a ghost!? I-I don't believe it!\nGumshoe:\nNo, Your Honor, no... I don't think it's a ghost.Gumshoe:\nIt was drizzling that day; unfortunately, it's a little hard to see what's going on.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nDrizzling, huh?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right. There was a light rain coming down. The whole place was dreary... ...But not as dreary as the mood that's in this court room right now. Ha ha.\nMia:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nGumshoe:\n...Looks like a cold front just moved in.\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... The point is that the area was quite damp. There was even some fog.\nGumshoe:\nI even slipped and fell while I was on the bridge. It was really something.Gumshoe:\nAnyway, the criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nIs that part of the witness's testimony as well?\nGumshoe:\nOf course it is. He pushed the victim hard in the back and she fell down right on her stomach!\nJudge:\nHmm... ...I remember that happening once myself. It was really broodle.\nMia:\n... (Are you talking about seeing someone get pushed, or were you the one getting pushed? Or does it mean that you pushed someone down like that once...? With his mind-boggling tales and the way he said, \"brutal\", I wonder if he's Canadian...)\nArmando:\nHa...! Save your nasty look for the right person.\nMia:\nHuh...?\nArmando:\n...Take a look.

Well. It looks like she didn't remember about the scarf. But from what she said, it sounded like a pretty violent fight, ma'am.\nMia:\n(The area was wet from rain. The bridge was probably wet, too. Which would explain why the scarf was all covered in mud, but... There's something about this testimony that's still bothering me...)Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"So at the time of the crime, there was a light drizzle coming down, correct?\"Armando:\nHeh, talk about a surprise. I had no idea there was a photo.Mia:\nS-So what do I do...\u00a0?Armando:\nYou really still believe him? Mr. Crybaby, I mean?Mia:\nOf course I do!Armando:\nHmph...! So the little kitten believes in fairy tales, huh... In that case, the answer is obvious. If what you believe is the truth... ...then that means that somewhere, hidden in that testimony, is a contradiction. One huge contradiction waiting to be discovered. ...That's your chance.Mia:\nSo at the time of the crime, there was a light drizzle coming down, correct?Gumshoe:\nYeah, and fog, too. Just a generally soggy atmosphere.Mia:\nWell, I have evidence that doesn't go with the soggy atmosphere.Judge:\nBut this is a photo of the victim's body that was found in the car trunk.Mia:\nConsidering the conditions at the scene of the crime, something isn't right.Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nWell by all means...

You truly are a genius... A genius of sarcasm and word-play.\nMia:\n(Oops! It looks like I really put my foot in my mouth that time!)\nArmando:\nJust relax.

You have got to think harder this time!)\nJudge:\nNow then, let me ask you one more time...\nLeads back to:\n\"What is it about this photo of the trunk that doesn't fit with the conditions that day?\"Mia:\nNaturally the answer is... right here!Judge:\nThe victim's... coat? As far as I can see, there is nothing strange about it.Mia:\nThat's exactly what's strange! Remember the testimony! What were the conditions on the bridge that day? It was drizzling and foggy. Dusky Bridge was all wet. If the victim really had fallen down on her stomach on top of the bridge... ...then the front of her coat should have been covered in mud!Gumshoe:\nUrk...!Edgeworth:\n...!Judge:\nThat... That's exactly right! The other day I fell on a muddy street and my gorgeous playoff beard was befouled!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...I do admit that the crime scene was quite wet that day. However! That doesn't mean that the top of the bridge itself was muddy! If Your Honor had fallen in the shower instead of on a muddy street... ...his glorious hockey beard, pride of the Legal League, would be wet, but not muddy!Judge:\nFortunately, I have yet to test that. Still, your point is well-taken.Edgeworth:\nCan you prove that the surface of the bridge was muddy that day?Mia:\n(The surface of the bridge, huh...)Armando:\nHa...! A real man wouldn't stand for a taunt like this!Mia:\n(Neither would a real woman!) Of course I can!Edgeworth:\n...!Mia:\nHere is the evidence that proves the surface of the bridge was muddy!Present Scarf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The evidence is... this scarf!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nThe evidence is...\nArmando:\nWait a minute.\nMia:\nWh-What is it? Your timing is terrible...!\nArmando:\nIf you present that evidence, it would be like... Like jumping off a 100-story building into a bubbling pool of magma. ...After tying a 10-ton boulder around your neck.\nMia:\nWhat is THAT supposed to mean?\nArmando:\nTo put it simply... It would be suicide.\nMia:\n(Why didn't he just put it simply in the first place...?)\nEdgeworth:\nIs your little chat finished? Can we move on now?\nMia:\nY-Yes... I-I've changed my mind.\nJudge:\nLife is short, Ms. Fey. Hurry it up already!\nMia:\nYes, Your Honor! The defense is now prepared to show our evidence!\nLeads back to:\n\"Here is the evidence that proves the surface of the bridge was muddy!\"Mia:\nThe evidence is... this scarf!Judge:\nAh...!Mia:\nIt should be obvious... If the scarf fell onto the bridge and got this muddy... It means that the bridge was obviously covered in mud!Edgeworth:\nUrrrnngh...! No... I can't be outwitted by this novice bimbo...!Mia:\n(Hey! Same to you, buddy!)Judge:\nMs. Fey's assertion makes perfect sense to me...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI do admit that there appears to be a contradiction between... ...the condition of the victim's coat and her scarf. However! The real question is... why is there a contradiction?Mia:\nHuh?Edgeworth:\nFor every contradiction, there exists an explanation. Let's look at what the explanation in this case may be, shall we?Mia:\nA-Alright...! (It's not like he's really giving me a choice here...)Armando:\nHa...! You're doing pretty well. ...For a little kitten. (Changed from [You're doing pretty good. ...For a little kitten.] in the original release)Mia:\nM-Mr. Armando!Armando:\nNo matter what he says, a contradiction always comes down to a lie. It's either the victim discovered in the trunk... ...the witness's photo showing the defendant and the victim... ...or the witness's testimony that stated she saw the moment of the murder. Just relax and think it over. It's pretty simple, isn't it? The false evidence... It's one of those three.Judge:\nHmph! What you said just now! I'm not sure I like that!Mia:\nTh-That wasn't me, Your Honor! It was the coffee aficionado over here that said it!Judge:\nThis court is not in the habit of accepting false evidence, you know!Armando:\nBlame it on him, Your Honor. He's the one trying to slip false evidence into the court.Mia:\n...!Armando:\nBut we won't let him! We'll expose his evidence as the flimsy scam it really is!Mia:\nY-Yes! The false evidence in this case is the...witness's photo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nAbout the photo that the prosecution claims was taken by a witness... It certainly seems to show a man in a prison uniform and a woman in a coat. However! We can't tell any more than that from the photo!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you saying the people in the photo may not be the victim and the defendant?\nMia:\nW-Well, that's certainly a possibility!\nEdgeworth:\nSo perhaps it was another prisoner and policewoman? I admit, people have their quirks. Perhaps they were part of a role-playing group?\nMia:\nW-Well, I suppose that's also p-possible... I guess...\nArmando:\nYou messed up again... Kitten.\nMia:\nM-Mr. Armando!\nArmando:\nThere should be something else that's even more suspicious. Now think the whole thing over again.\nJudge:\nFrom this point on, Ms. Fey, I will penalize you for making unsubstantiated accusations!\nMia:\n(Ugggh... Don't do it, Mia! Don't cry until you get home!)\nJudge:\nIn any case...!\nLeads back to:\n\"This court is not in the habit of accepting false evidence, you know!\"body in the trunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nIf the victim really did try to repel her killer and if she did fall down on the bridge... ...then you would expect her coat to be dirty. Therefore! The body that was found in the trunk of the car... It was NOT the body of Valerie Hawthorne!\nJudge:\nWh-What do you have to say to that, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n*sigh* Objection.\nJudge:\nHmm... Not only a whisper, but he mixed in a sigh, too.\nEdgeworth:\nValerie Hawthorne was more than a simple meter maid; she was a sergeant. There's absolutely no chance that a mistake about her identity could be made.\nMia:\nUuurgh... (I guess he's right...)\nJudge:\nFrom this point on, Ms. Fey, I will penalize you for making unsubstantiated accusations!\nMia:\n(Ugggh... Don't do it, Mia! Don't cry until you get home!)\nJudge:\nIn any case...!\nLeads back to:\n\"This court is not in the habit of accepting false evidence, you know!\"witness's testimony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It is a no-brainer. Obviously it's the witness that's suspicious!\"Mia:\nIt is a no-brainer. Obviously it's the witness that's suspicious! During his earlier testimony, the detective pointed out a crucial fact. \"The criminal shoved the victim down from behind and stabbed her in the back.\" Now, is that testimony exactly what the witness claims to have seen?Gumshoe:\nYeah. ...That's what the witness told us.Mia:\nThat testimony... is filled with holes. After all, the victim's coat isn't dirty at all.Judge:\nHmm... That's true.Armando:\nHa...! It's not just true. It's the truth. If there was a truly decisive witness in this case... ...I'm certain that boy wonder over there would have called them in the first place!Mia:\n...Your Honor! The defense requests to cross-examine the eyewitness! The testimony presented so far is not only vague, but contradictory as well!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth? It appears that we'll need to hear from your mystery witness after all.Edgeworth:\n... *sigh* You should brace yourself. ...For the brutal truth.Mia:\n...?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor, the prosecution has no intention of hiding the witness from the court. We are prepared to present our witness at any time.Judge:\nVery well... Please bring forth your witness at this time.Mia:\n(What Mr. Edgeworth said... kind of worries me... What does he mean by \"the brutal truth\"?)Judge:\nNow, let's proceed with the testimony. Mr. Edgeworth. Please go right ahead.Edgeworth:\nThank you, Your Honor. The prosecution summons... ...the woman who saw the events that day with her very own eyes.Mia:\n(This is it, Mia! The battle begins here!)Edgeworth:\n...Witness. What is your name and occupation? ...Judge:\n...Mia:\n(Everyone is so silent that I can hear their hearts going pitter-patter...)Judge:\nHmm... Ohh... When I look at you... How can I put it...? You look as scrumptous [sic] as a double-double and a dozen doughnut holes... I feel like I want to hurry up and hand down a verdict just to have a bite...Mia:\n(Hey, hey! Not so fast!)Edgeworth:\n...*sigh* As I said before... This witness is very sensitive and delicate. I would ask the court to please exercise care when addressing her.Judge:\nYes, indeed... Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. You are a true gentleman. Ms. Fey! You could learn a lot from this man!Mia:\n(...If he's such a gentleman, he sure doesn't act like one to me.)???:\nUmm... Sir?Judge:\nHmmm... Eh? Yes, my dear????:\nThis is my first time, so I'm sure I'll make a lot of mistakes. Anyway... I just wanted to say I'm sorry for all the trouble I might cause...Judge:\nHmmmmm... Not at all! It's no trouble at all!Mia:\nNow then... May we please have your name and occupation?Melissa:\nMy name is, umm... ...Melissa Foster. I'm a college student... A-A freshman in the literature department.Edgeworth:\nYou were on the scene when the unfortunate event occurred, correct?Mia:\n...And you were the one who took this photo? Is that accurate?Melissa:\nWaaaaaah! H-How can you be so mean...?Judge:\nNow see here! What are you doing shoving that in her face like that!?Mia:\nHuh? B-But it's just a photograph! It's not like it's something dangerous!Judge:\nNext time I'll be forced to penalize you!Mia:\n(Uh oh... I don't like the turn this has taken...)Melissa:\n...Mia:\n...? (Is she... staring at me?)Melissa:\nUmm... And you would be...?Mia:\nHuh? I-I'm the defense attorney. ...My name is Mia Fey. (Changed form [Huh? I-I'm the defense lawyer. ...My name is Mia Fey.] in the original release)Melissa:\n... ...I see. So you are...Judge:\nNow then, young lady. Could you please give us your testimony?Melissa:\nYes, Your Honor... I-I'll do my best.Witness Testimony-- The Witness's Photograph --Melissa:\nI... I was using my camera to take some pictures of wild flowers.\nThen, I noticed there were two people standing up on the suspension bridge.\nSuddenly, they just started fighting!\nThat's when I hurried and took the photo that shows the crucial moment.\nAnd right after that, I called the police.Judge:\nHmm... By the way, where were you standing when the incident occurred...?Edgeworth:\nI believe the map would be of help here.Melissa:\nUmm... I was standing to the south of the bridge. I was standing in a beautiful field, surrounded by tall cliffs.Judge:\nSo you took the photo from that location, eh.Melissa:\nI brought the camera I was using at the time, just like Mr. Edgeworth asked me to.Judge:\nHo ho ho. What a cute camera... Just like its owner.Camera added to the Court Record.Judge:\n...Alright then, Ms. Fey. Time for your cross-examination.

I was using my camera to take some pictures of wild flowers.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nDid you say... \"wild flowers\"?\nMelissa:\nYes, the mountain is famous for its beautiful spring wild flowers.\nMia:\nUmm... But it's only February.\nMelissa:\nWell, I... I couldn't wait for Spring to come.\nJudge:\nHo ho... I know just how you feel! It's just like when I first started growing this glorious beard of mine... I just couldn't wait, so I wore a dyed blonde Santa beard until mine grew in properly.\nEdgeworth:\n...Would you mind if we got back to the facts of the case, Your Honor?Melissa:\nThen, I noticed there were two people standing up on the suspension bridge.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWas there anything strange about the two of them?\nMelissa:\nI... I'm a bad girl. ...I know I am. It looked like they were having a really serious conversation up there... ...So I decided to watch them. Like some kind of Peeping Tom.\nJudge:\nNo, not at all! Everyone is like that! I love watching other people fight, too. In fact, I can't get enough of it! ...Actually, that's why I took this job in the first place.\nMia:\n(Too much info, Your Honor!)\nEdgeworth:\n...In any case, it's perfectly natural for you to have kept watching them. Especially dressed as they were...\nMelissa:\nWell, anyway... I was watching them very closely.Melissa:\nSuddenly, they just started fighting!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nDo you have any idea what they were fighting about?\nMelissa:\nEh? No... I have no idea. Why do you ask that?\nMia:\nOh, I just thought that maybe you overheard what they said...\nMelissa:\n...\nMia:\n...!\nMelissa:\nI would never... I would never eavesdrop... I've got more class than that!\nJudge:\nThat's right, Ms. Fey! Don't drag the witness down to your level!\nMia:\n(Grrrr...!)Melissa:\nThat's when I hurried and took the photo that shows the crucial moment.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWhy did you take a photo?\nMelissa:\nWell, the two of them were really going at it... Ever since I was a little girl, I always wanted to be a news reporter... I guess that part of me just kind of took over...\nMia:\n(Smells like a lie to me...)\nJudge:\nYes, I understand completely! Even now, I can't completely abandon my boyhood dreams... I still use my grandson to test my comedy routines on!\nMia:\n(So he wanted to be a comedian, huh. ...Not that it has any bearing on this.)\nMelissa:\nAll I could do was to use my camera. So I took the photo of the crucial moment and gave it to the police.Present Witness's Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\n...Witness. When you said you took a photo of the crucial moment,  is this what you meant?\nMelissa:\nErr...\nMia:\nAll I can see in this photo are two people facing each other. You testified that you saw the two of them starting to fight. Normally that's the kind of thing we would refer to as a crucial moment! Why haven't you presented a photo like that!?\nMelissa:\n...W-Well, you see...\nEdgeworth:\n...The photo we presented was the only one there was.\nMia:\nBut if you really wanted to capture the crucial moment... ...then what happened next? You must have taken a photo of it!\nJudge:\nHm... Hmmmmm... Doh! Err... Umm... My apologies, young lady... But Ms. Fey's assertion is not without a certain amount of merit...\nMia:\nHe can certainly downplay a situation, can't he... (Was an inner monologue in the original release)\nMelissa:\n...I-I'm sorry... ...I'm a very bad girl. I umm... I used it all up... The film, I mean.\nJudge:\nYou ran out of film!?\nMelissa:\nErr, this photo was the last one.\nMia:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, that is the truth. ...I personally examined all of the photographs she took that day. All the other photos are of the witness herself, playing among the wild flowers.\nMia:\nThe witness herself? Then who took the photos?\nMelissa:\nWell... You see... My camera has a timer feature built into it.\nMia:\nSo, you took photos of yourself!?\nJudge:\nHmm... I remember taking some photos of myself once, too!\nMia:\n(Please! No details...!)\nJudge:\n...It seems that Ms. Fey's assertion was not so decisive after all.\nMia:\nW-Wait! Just a minute!\nJudge:\nWell, if she had no film left, she couldn't very well take more pictures, eh.\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Foster, perhaps then you could tell us about a different sort of photo. Photos of the incident that you \"took\" with your very own eyes.\nMelissa:\nMr. Edgeworth... You're quite the poet!\nJudge:\nVery well then! Let's get back to the cross-examination. ...Let's hear your thoughts on the fight that you witnessed!\nMelissa:\nYes... Mr. Judge.\nMia:\n(Boy, this guy is really a sucker for sweet talk...)\nArmando:\nHa...! It looks like the other kitten in the room is the one that's getting all the attention.\nMia:\nYeah, it's sickening.\nChanges statement from \"That's when I hurried and took the photo that shows the crucial moment.\" to \"The victim turned around and tried to run away, but...\"\nChanges statement from \"And right after that, I called the police.\" to \"She only got about 10 yards before she was stabbed in the back.\"Melissa:\nThe victim turned around and tried to run away, but...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nThe victim... Why do you think she tried to run away?\nMelissa:\nUmm...\nMia:\nWith her police training, she certainly knew better than to turn her back on a criminal...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis was a large, powerful man with a knife. If it had been a quaggy woman like you, I'm sure she would have acted differently.\nMia:\n(\"Quaggy\"!? Why you...!)\nJudge:\nIf it had been me, I probably would have jumped into the river!\nMia:\n(There's still something wrong with this testimony...)Present Dusky Bridge Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Witness! Your testimony is a joke!\"Melissa:\nAnd right after that, I called the police.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou called the police?\nMelissa:\nYes. Because it looked to me like the murderer was going to try to escape.\nEdgeworth:\n...We were already moving before the call even came in. Thanks to the victim's note, we had already started our operation.\nJudge:\nHmm... That was certainly tough luck for the criminal, eh.Melissa:\nShe only got about 10 yards before she was stabbed in the back.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo you're saying Sergeant Hawthorne wasn't able to get away from him...?\nMelissa:\nWell, it's a narrow bridge and it was swaying back and forth... If you ask me, both of them were in danger of falling off. I only wish I could have done something to help her...\nJudge:\nHmmmm... That seems to make sense.\nMia:\nI wonder about that... Something seems kind of off...\nArmando:\nHa...! You have a good sixth sense. When you feel that something's off, that's when you need to figure out why...Present Dusky Bridge Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Witness! Your testimony is a joke!\"Mia:\n(If Terry Fawles isn't the criminal... Then there must be something strange in that girl's testimony!)Armando:\nBe careful, Kitten. That girl has the judge wrapped right around her little finger. You're going to have a tough time poking holes in that testimony of hers.Mia:\n(You're going to have to come up with something really good, Mia!)Mia:\nWitness! Your testimony is a joke!Melissa:\nHuh... Wh-What...? B-But I... I just...Judge:\nMs. Fey! I thought I warned you not to make the witness cry!Mia:\nOne short testimony and two bad contradictions... There's no possible excuse!Judge:\nYou say there were... two contradictions!?Mia:\nIt's simple. Just take a look at the diagram of the area. According to her testimony, the two of them were in the middle of the bridge. But if they were, and the victim had turned around and tried to run... Well, then...Judge:\nS-She would've hit a dead-end...!Mia:\nYou said 10 yards, but she couldn't have ran even 5! Because Dusky Bridge is collapsed on that side!Melissa:\nWaaaaaah!Judge:\nWh-What does all this mean!?Mia:\nIt's very simple, Your Honor. This charming, little witness told a charming, little lie. That's all there is to it.Melissa:\nNnnn...ggg...urk...Judge:\nTh-This beautiful, young lady has been l-lying to the court...?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nJust a moment, Your Honor.Mia:\n(M-Mr. Edgeworth...!)Edgeworth:\nYour Honor... Allow me to personally apologize for the confusion.Judge:\nWhat do you mean?Edgeworth:\nThere's one major mistake in this diagram.Mia:\nWhat did you say!?Judge:\nWhat are you referring to?Edgeworth:\nIt's all because this diagram was made after the incident occurred. It's a very old bridge... We couldn't find any official blueprints of it.Judge:\nS-So you're saying...?Edgeworth:\nI'm saying that even though this bridge is currently in disrepair... ...there's no evidence that can prove that the bridge was broken during the incident.Mia:\nTh-That's ridiculous...!Edgeworth:\nYou can't actually tell the condition of the bridge from this photo... I apologize to the court for not being more clear when I presented the evidence.Judge:\nHmm. Hmmmm...Armando:\nHa...! That guy is good.Mia:\nHuh? What do you mean?Armando:\nHe planned it from the beginning. He's a genius alright... That diagram of the bridge was his insurance policy.Mia:\n(What!? That coward!)Judge:\nWell, Ms. Fey... It seems you've once again made a reckless accusation.Mia:\n...!Melissa:\nI-I'm so sorry! I should have been more careful myself...!Judge:\nNo, no, no, no! It wasn't YOUR fault at all!Edgeworth:\nNow then... Shall we go on with the trial? I'd like to establish, once and for all, what it was that the witness actually saw.Judge:\nIndeed. Alright, young lady... May I ask you to please proceed with your testimony?Melissa:\nBut I... It's so hard to go on...!Judge:\nWe're all on your side, Ms. Foster!Edgeworth:\nThere's no need to worry. Just tell us what you saw.Melissa:\nY-Yes, sir!Witness Testimony-- Running From the Crime --Melissa:\nAfter he stabbed her in the back, he quickly picked her up in his arms.\nThen he carried her over to the car.\nI suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden.\nHe couldn't just leave the body on top of the bridge.\nOh, I'm sorry... I'm only supposed to talk about what I saw.Judge:\nHmm... Witnessing such violence must have been difficult.Melissa:\nYes, sir... I-I'm still shaken up...Armando:\nIf he accepts this testimony as it is, we're finished.Mia:\nD-Don't say that...!Armando:\nOh well... Maybe I'll stop off at my favorite caf\u00e9 on the way home. They make a really great mocha latt\u00e9...Mia:\nThis trial isn't over yet!Armando:\nHa...! That's what I like to hear...Judge:\nAlright, Ms. Fey.

Of course she didn't fall down. The man in the prison uniform grabbed her before she could.\nMia:\n...\nArmando:\nHa...!

Let's remember they were on a narrow bridge that was ready to collapse! Is it even possible for him to have carried a dead body on a bridge like that...?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, the fact of the matter is that he DID! That kind of talk is just silly!\nMia:\n(Wow... Why did he get so emotional all of a sudden?)\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, if you think there's some other possibility, please share it with the rest of us.Present Dusky Bridge Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nA killer not wanting his victim to be found... I can understand that. However! The idea of moving the body for that purpose is clearly odd. There was a much easier way to make sure the body wasn't found!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nW-Well? What is it!?\nMia:\nTake another look at the map of the area and you'll see how. There's a river right below the bridge. Earlier Mr. Edgeworth pointed out something interesting about the river.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nFor those who are not aware, Eagle River is well-known for its powerful current. Most bodies that fall in are never recovered...\n\n\nJudge:\nAhh...\nMia:\nIn the kidnapping case 5 years ago, the victim's body was carried away and never found.\nMelissa:\n...!\nMia:\nIf 10 murders were to occur at that same spot above the Eagle River... ...you can bet your boots that every other killer would have tossed the body in the water!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I'm not sure if I care for the way you put that, Ms. Fey! But I must admit it does seem odd not to have thrown the body into the river!\nMelissa:\nOoooh...!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n*sigh* How sad. Perhaps Ms. Fey would do well to try taking a dip in the river herself. After all, you claim to be such an expert in the ways of nature...\nMia:\nWhat are you talking about?\nEdgeworth:\nMy point is that no matter how odd you may find the killer's method of body-disposal... ...the fact is that this is what the killer did. None of your arguments have anything to do with what the witness saw.\nJudge:\nHmm... Quite true... Ms. Fey, it seems that your assertion is without merit after all.\nMia:\n\nMia:\nBut what the witness claims to have seen is totally ridiculous...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSurely you can't deny that the body was found in the trunk of the car.\nJudge:\nThat's certainly consistent with what the witness has told us.\nMia:\nUgh...\nEdgeworth:\nPlease, witness, go on with your testimony.\nMelissa:\nI-I'll try...\nEdgeworth:\nAll you have to do is tell us only what you saw. Otherwise the mean lady might yell at you again.\nMia:\n(Who is he talking about!?)\nMelissa:\nAlright! I-I'll do my best!\nChanges statement from \"I suppose that was the only way he could make sure the body stayed hidden.\" to \"The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.\"Melissa:\nThe killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWhat did the man do then?\nMelissa:\nWell... Naturally, he got in the car and was about to flee. That's... That's when I came to my senses. I said to myself, \"You have to call the police!\"\nEdgeworth:\nAnd so that's when you called the police?\nMia:\nYou're sure that you saw all that with your own eyes?\nMelissa:\nYes. I'm 100% certain.Present Dusky Bridge Map or Witness's Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Ms. Foster... It looks like you've done it this time.\"Melissa:\nHe couldn't just leave the body on top of the bridge.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWhy do you say that? It's already a broken-down bridge hidden away in the mountains. Doing anything more to hide the corpse would be going overboard, wouldn't it?\nMelissa:\nYes, but that mountain is famous among hikers. A surprising number of people go up there.\nMia:\nBut it's February, right? And it was raining that day, correct?\nMelissa:\nThere is also a small temple and a channeling dojo there. You know those monks... They just love cold, isolated places...\nEdgeworth:\nI think the witness is trying to say that the corpse could have been found at any time... Besides, the witness is merely reporting what she witnessed with her own eyes.\nMelissa:\n...Melissa:\nOh, I'm sorry... I'm only supposed to talk about what I saw.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAnd you're absolutely certain that it was my client who was carrying the body?\nMelissa:\n... Well, he was wearing a prisoner's uniform, but... as for his face...\nJudge:\nSo you're saying you didn't get a clear look at his face?\nMelissa:\nWell, they were far away and it was raining as well. I-I thought I was only supposed to say exactly what I saw...\nJudge:\nExcellent! You're a remarkably honest young woman!Mia:\n(Something about this testimony is bothering me, but what...?)Armando:\nHey, Kitten... Have you ever put salt in your coffee?Mia:\nNo... Why would I!?Armando:\nWhy not?Mia:\nHuh...?Armando:\nIt may actually go better with coffee than sugar, right?Mia:\n...Armando:\nListen. My point is if you're not sure, you might as well add a ton of salt to it. It might... bring out the rust in something. Like a piece of evidence.Mia:\n(He's right, Mia... Go present something. You've got nothing to lose!)Armando:\nBy the way, I wouldn't put salt in my coffee. The two don't go well, after all.Mia:\nWell, Ms. Foster... It looks like you've done it this time.Melissa:\n...? D-Done what?Mia:\nMade a crucial mistake.Judge:\nA c-crucial mistake? Like what, Ms. Fey!?Mia:\n\"The killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.\" You're saying you saw that, right? With your very own eyes?Melissa:\nY-Yes... And...?Mia:\nIt's simple, Ms. Foster. Take a look at the diagram. The place you claim to have taken the photo from that day is here. Do you see what I mean? Even if you tried to see the car... ...this outcropping of rock is directly in the way.Melissa:\nAh...!Mia:\nThat's right, Ms. Foster. From where you were standing, you could not have possibly seen the killer's car.Melissa:\nAaaaah...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI admit that the diagram shows a large outcropping of rock. However... It isn't so tall that it would stop her from seeing the car!Melissa:\nTh-That's right! It-It's not high at all... I-I was able to see his car just fine!Mia:\nI'm so sorry... But that just doesn't wash.Melissa:\n...!Mia:\nI believe it was the witness who presented this as evidence to the court, yes? This is the location that the photo was taken from. Your own photo tells the whole story! You can clearly see the left side of the bridge... But the outcropping that is being referred to is really more like a cliff.Judge:\nAh!Mia:\nYour view should have been completely cut off by this cliff! But still you claim to have been able to see the killer's car!Melissa:\n... Noooooo!Judge:\nOr-Order! Order in the court! What is the meaning of all this ballyhoo...!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor... Don't jump to any hasty conclusions. The fact that the escapee fled in a stolen car was reported on the news. After witnessing a murder, I'm sure you can appreciate that the witness was very upset. She must have heard about the stolen car and convinced herself that she saw it.Mia:Mia:\nBut she was repeatedly warned before starting her testimony! She was told to testify only about what she saw with her own eyes!Judge:\nHmmmmm... Oh!Melissa:\nErr... Mr. Judge?Judge:\nWh-What is it?Melissa:\nI think... I think I must have remembered things wrong...Mia:Mia:\nHey! Wait a minute! You can't just say that...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nMs. Fey, no one on the face of the planet is perfect.Judge:\nHmmmm... Yes, indeed... Quite true! You know what they say... \"To err is human, to forgive, divine.\" I'm inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to our witness here.Mia:\nWhat...!? Th-That's not fair...!Armando:\nHa...! Save the tears for later, Kitten!Mia:\nM-Mr. Armando!Armando:\nDon't look back until the trial is over. Now is the time to go forward.Mia:\nB-But...! But that wasn't fair!Armando:\nOK, Kitten, you need to relax. Then you need to remember... The other kitten's testimony!Melissa:\nThe killer broke into the trunk of the stolen car and hid the body in there.Armando:\nSo tell me... How did she know that? (Changed from [So tell us... How did you know that?] in the original release) How did she know that he broke into the trunk? (Changed from [How did you know that he broke into the trunk?] in the original release)Mia:\nAha...!Armando:\nWell, Ms. Foster? Until you can explain how you knew that... (Changed from [Until you can explain how you knew that...] in the original release) ...you're going to have a lot of very suspicious people on this side of the courtroom.Melissa:\n...Judge:\nW-Well, witness?Melissa:\nWell, I'm certain that he broke into the trunk. Because... Because there were marks left on the trunk lid. I'm certain they were scratch marks from when he broke into it...!Judge:\nW-What...!? L-Let me see that photo! It's true... These certainly look like scratch marks around the keyhole! HMMMM...! It's obvious that this trunk has been broken open. Well, Ms. Fey? Are you satisfied...?Mia:\n(The judge is on her side! I can't make any mistakes here! What she just said... Is there a contradiction in there somewhere...?)I'll buy it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Something about it still doesn't feel right, but...) I, err... OK, I guess I'm satisfied... Sort of.\nEdgeworth:\nI hope this has cleared up any doubts...\nJudge:\nIndeed, I believe it has.\nArmando:\nHey Kitten, this is no time to play around!\nMia:\nHuh...?\nArmando:\nOverlooking such a huge contradiction... What am I going do with you?\nMia:\n(Contradiction...!? So that wasn't my imagination after all!)\nJudge:\nVery well, let's move on to the next...\nMia:\n\nMia:\nJ-Just a minute!\nJudge:\nWhat is it now, Ms. Fey!?\nMia:\nI've got a big problem with what this witness said!\nJudge:\n... I'd appreciate it if you didn't change your mind every 5 seconds!\nMia:\n(Ugh... Hang in there, Mia!)\nLeads to:\n\"Melissa Foster.\"It doesn't work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Melissa Foster.\"Mia:\nMelissa Foster. It looks like you've finally betrayed yourself.Melissa:\nWhat...!?Mia:\nYou said you were in a field taking photos of wild flowers. But even so, you knew about the scratches... The question is when! When did you get a chance to see those scratches!?Melissa:\n...Mia:\n(Finally...! I've finally got her!)Armando:\nHa...! I'm getting pretty tired of waiting over here!Edgeworth:\nThen perhaps it would be faster if Ms. Fey explained herself.Mia:\nYour Honor! There's only one possible explanation! The reason the witness had seen the scratches was...she happened to be passing by.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nBecause she just happened to be passing by the area where the car was parked!\nJudge:\n... Well, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nFrankly, Your Honor, after hearing a pathetic response like that... I have to question whether or not such a pathetic lawyer should even exist...\nJudge:\nDid you hear that Ms. Fey? I believe Mr. Edgeworth just called you a canucklehead.\nMia:\n(Yeesh, isn't that overdoing things a little bit...? Come on, Mia! One more time! You can do it!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Your Honor! There's only one possible explanation!\"she put the corpse in herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's only one way that the witness had the chance to see those scratches.\"she is the owner of the car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nBecause the stolen car actually belonged to her. That is why she knew about the scratches!\nJudge:\n... Well, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nFrankly, Your Honor, after hearing a pathetic response like that... I have to question whether or not such a pathetic lawyer should even exist...\nJudge:\nDid you hear that Ms. Fey? I believe Mr. Edgeworth just called you a canucklehead.\nMia:\n(Yeesh, isn't that overdoing things a little bit...? Come on, Mia! One more time! You can do it!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Your Honor! There's only one possible explanation!\"Mia:\nThere's only one way that the witness had the chance to see those scratches.Judge:\nY-Yes? What was it?Mia:\nNaturally... When she opened the trunk... and stuffed the corpse in herself!Edgeworth:\n...!Mia:\nThe person who really hid the body in the trunk of that car was... Melissa Foster! It was you that did it, wasn't it!?Melissa:\nTh-That's ridiculous! I could never...! It was the man in the prison garb! He-He's the one that...Mia:\nI don't think so, Ms. Foster. If Mr. Fawles had been the one that put the corpse in the trunk... ...he would have simply used the car key. There was no need to break it open.Melissa:\nB-But...! He stole the car...!Mia:\nHe stole it from a young couple that had been waiting at a red light. Which means that the key would have still been in the ignition.Melissa:\nOh...! I-I... I see...Mia:\nThank you for telling us about the scratches, Ms. Foster. Without that, we never would have uncovered the truth. That it couldn't have been Mr. Fawles that put the body in the trunk! (Changed from [It couldn't have been Mr. Fawles that put the body in the trunk!] in the original release)Melissa:\nNooooo!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nP-Preposterous! To even suggest that the witness put the body in there! If that were true... then how do you explain the photo that she took? The corpse could only have been put in the trunk when the incident occurred. And we already know that at the time, she was taking photographs!Mia:\n(Now is your chance, Mia! Finish this thing!) On the contrary, I'm not so certain about that anymore, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n...!Mia:\nThere's no need to think too deeply about it. What I'm saying is the shutter for this may not have been pushed by Ms. Foster herself!Present Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let's take another look at this camera, and see what features it has, shall we?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWell, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nTo be quite honest, Ms. Fey... I wish you would have thought a little more deeply on this matter.\nMia:\nHuh?\nArmando:\nHey Kitten... Don't start getting all sloppy on me now. The fact is, she wasn't there, but the photo got taken. So how did it happen? This is a fastball right over home plate.\nMia:\n(That's what I thought, but...)\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, take a moment and think it over again.\nLeads back to:\n\"There's no need to think too deeply about it.\"Mia:\nLet's take another look at this camera, and see what features it has, shall we? (Changed from [I don't think you can make a mistake about it. Take a look at her camera.] in the original release) It has a timer built into it! Even a mini-tripod!Judge:\nHmmmm...!Mia:\nAlmost as if the camera was brought just to take this picture!Melissa:\n...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat are you trying to say then, Ms. Fey!? That when the crime occurred, Ms. Foster wasn't in the field as she claimed!?Mia:\n(Well, if she really did use the camera's auto-timer... ...then the answer is yes, she was somewhere else.) Exactly. She was NOT in the field.Judge:\nHmm... Would the defense please explain further.Armando:\nListen... This is a crucial point. \"Where was Ms. Foster when the incident occurred...?\" In answering that question, we'll also make clear Ms. Foster's true identity.Judge:\nWell then, please answer this question. Where was Melissa Foster when the incident on the bridge occurred?Present victim's location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Naturally, the witness was right here!\"Present car\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nNaturally the witness was right... here! ...I think.\nJudge:\nHmm... In the spot where the defendant's car was?\nMia:\nYes! She had to put the body in the trunk before the defendant returned!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't mind if I ask one teenie-weenie question, do you, Ms. Fey...?\nMia:\n(Uh oh. He's got that condescending tone in his voice...)\nEdgeworth:\nIf she put the body in the trunk at that time, as you suggest... ...that must mean that Valerie Hawthorne was already dead at that point, correct?\nJudge:\nHmm, indeed.\nEdgeworth:\nPlease take a look at the top of Dusky Bridge. It certainly looks to me like the victim is still alive... Am I mistaken?\nMia:\nErr...\nEdgeworth:\nIf Valerie Hawthorne was already dead, then... who is this? The mountain is famous for spirits, so maybe you think it was the ghost of the victim?\nMia:\n... Well, it COULD have been a spirit... Right?\nJudge:\nMs. Fey! Don't waste the court's time with this kind of foolishness!\nMia:\nA-Anyway! I still maintain that the witness was in a different place at the time!\nJudge:\nAre you certain?\nMia:\nYes, I am certain! More or less.\nJudge:\nOh, come now, Ms. Fey...\nLeads back to:\n\"Well then, please answer this question.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nNaturally, the witness was standing right here!\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... Well, what do you think, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n*sigh* Before pointing out where the witness was standing, Ms. Fey should do something herself. She should figure out where SHE stands, if you catch my drift!\nMia:\n(Oh don't worry, the drift was certainly caught...)\nJudge:\nYes, failure is an excellent opportunity for growth. Now try better next time.\nMia:\nAh, yes... Thank you...\nLeads back to:\n\"Well then, please answer this question.\"Mia:\nNaturally, the witness was right here!Judge:\nB-But that's... But that's where the victim, Ms. Hawthorne was standing! Order! Order! Order! Ms. Fey! What on earth...!?Mia:\nYour Honor, if I may... After parting with the \"victim\" on the bridge, the defendant fled by car. But this would mean that there was no time to put the victim in the trunk. In other words, if someone put the body in the trunk... ...it could only have been before the defendant met the \"victim\"!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHow asinine! Of course Mr. Fawles met with the victim! The only person with the opportunity to have put the victim in the trunk... ...is the same man that killed her: Terry Fawles!Mia:Mia:\nYou still don't understand, do you, Mr. Edgeworth? By the time the witness's photo was taken, the victim was already dead... The person in the photo was NOT Valerie Hawthorne!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat!? I've never heard anything more ridiculous in my entire life! Then who exactly is the \"victim\" in this photo!?Mia:\nIt's obvious, isn't it? It's your own witness.Melissa:\n...!Judge:\nWh-Wh-Whaaaat...!?Mia:\nIt's the only possible explanation. The woman that Mr. Fawles met on the bridge that day was not Valerie Hawthorne! It was you! Melissa Foster!Melissa:\nM-M-Me...!?Mia:\nLet's remember that it was raining and foggy on the mountain that day. Mr. Fawles himself believed that the woman in front of him was Valerie Hawthorne!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nBut the defendant knew Valerie Hawthorne very well! After all, she was the woman whose testimony helped get him convicted!Mia:Mia:\nBut since then, my client has spent five hard years in a federal penitentiary! He couldn't remember exactly what she looked like anymore!Edgeworth:\nYou are just making this up as you go along! Where's your proof!?Mia:\n(I've got it all right here! This piece of evidence will blow this case wide open...!) At the time of the incident, Mr. Fawles had forgotten what Valerie Hawthorne looked like!Present Victim's Note or Scarf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Fawles had forgotten the victim's face.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nArmando:\nWait a minute, Kitten.\nMia:\nM-Mr. Armando...\nArmando:\nFirst of all, relax. Second of all, think the whole thing over again!\nMia:\n(H-He's right, Mia! You need to calm down and think it over!)\nLeads back to:\n\"He couldn't remember exactly what she looked like anymore!\"Mia:\nMr. Fawles had forgotten the victim's face. That's why he needed some piece of identification. Namely, this muddy scarf!Melissa:\nAh...!Mia:\nIt was Mr. Fawles who requested that she wear this scarf to identify herself. That's already been proven by the note the victim left!Edgeworth:\n...Mia:\nIn other words, as long as you were wearing a scarf like he asked... ...anyone could have pretended to be Valerie Hawthorne!Melissa:\n...Mia:\nWell? What do you have to say to that, Melissa Foster!?Melissa:\nNnng...Gggh...Unnn...! N-N-N-N-N-Nnnnoooooooo!!!Judge:\nErr... Ahh... Where's Ms. Foster...?Edgeworth:\nShe's collecting herself in the Lobby.Judge:\nHmmmmm...Mia:\n(It's obvious that Melissa Foster did it. She hid the body in the trunk and disguised herself as the victim... She set up the camera to snap a fake photo of them together...)Armando:\nThe only question is... why did she do it...?Mia:\nWell, isn't that obvious? She's the real culprit! (Changed from [She's the true criminal!] in the original release)Armando:\nHa...!Judge:\nWell, we'll have to wait for Ms. Foster to compose herself before we start again. Until then, this court is in recess. The defense and the prosecution are both to wait in their respective lobbies. (Changed from [The defense and the prosecution are instructed to wait in the lobby.] in the original release)Mia:\nYes, Your Honor.Edgeworth:\nUnderstood.Judge:\nVery well! This court is in recess!To be continued.February 16, 1:14 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 4Mia:\nMr. Fawles, I...Fawles:\nUGGAAAA!Mia:\nEeeeeek! I'm sorry! I-I'm sorry!Fawles:\nI wanna say thanks. You're real good! You really hooked me up!Mia:\nThanks! We're almost there! Once I prove that she committed the crime...Armando:\n...Yeah, but there's one more big obstacle we've got to get past.Mia:\nOb-Obstacle...?Armando:\nYeah. Motive. Why would Melissa Foster kill that policewoman anyway?Mia:\n(Motive, huh...)Armando:\nAnyway... We're still badly in need of information.Mia:\nInformation... Right...Armando:\nWhat we need the most is info about this Melissa Foster herself. All we know is that she's a student studying literature. And one more thing.Mia:\n...What is it?Armando:\nWell, the incident that happened 5 years ago, of course. The kidnapping-murder case that Zebra Boy is on death row for...Fawles:\nI din't do nuttin'! I din't kill nobody! I never lie!Mia:\nMr. Fawles! In that case... Tell us more about it. ...About what happened 5 years ago.Fawles:\n... OK. I trust you. That day. 5 years ago. I dream of it. Every day. This picture. It reminds me everything. Bridge looks same. Just like then... 5 years ago... Like it could fall apart... Fall apart any minute...Mia:\n(So it's been broken like that for at least 5 years...)Armando:\nHa...! Sorry buddy, but you sound like the one that could fall apart at any minute.Fawles:\nIt true. I did... ...I did kidnap her. ...Five years ago. I kidnapped. My girlfriend. Dahlia Hawthorne.Mia:\nY-Your g-girlfriend? Huh...?Armando:\nHey, hold on there! Did you say, \"Hawthorne\"!?Mia:\n(The victim's last name...!)Fawles:\nDahlia Hawthorne... Valerie's little sister.Mia:\nWh-Wh-Whaaat!? Are you serious!?The girl... Let her go!Shut up! C-Come closer... And I kill her!Sorry, but you're not going to get the chance...Mia:\n(The detective back then was Valerie Hawthorne!) At first I thought shooting someone for a kidnapping was crossing the line, but... If it was to protect her little sister, I can understand why she did it...Fawles:\nWrong! No protect sister! Valerie betray me! Betray us!Mia:\nWhat do you mean she betrayed you!?Fawles:\nEverything. All lies. All make-believe. Kidnapping, too...Mia:\nA make-believe kidnapping?Fawles:\nDahlia. My girlfriend. My love. My Teen Angel.Mia:\n(Ugh. Did he actually say, \"My Teen Angel\"? He's seen one too many soap operas.)Fawles:\nI do anything she says. Anything Dahlia says...Mia:\n(\"Anything Dahlia says\"...?) H-Hold on a minute! What you're saying is that the kidnapping 5 years ago was planned by...Fawles:\nYeah. Me and Dahlia... ...And Valerie, too.Mia:\n(Valerie was in on it!?)Fawles:\nDahlia's family rich. Jewelry business. We get one jewel... That's what we thought... Me and Dahlia wrote kidnap note. We send to her dad. Asked for 2 million dollar diamond. Tell him make exchange on Dusky Bridge. ...We tell him Valerie make transfer 'cause she new detective.Armando:\nHaving a police detective in your pocket is a useful thing alright. In the end, you were planning on splitting the 2 million three ways, huh...Fawles:\nYeah, but! That woman! That woman! Valerie! She do it for real! She shoot at me for real! Me and Dahlia!*BANG!*Fawles:\nI was shot in arm. Dahlia... She jump in river.Mia:\nJump...? You don't mean she jumped on purpose, do you?Fawles:\nI couldn't do it! I could never push her...! Anyway, I blacked out... Wake up with police all over.Armando:\n...And that's when they decided to give you the death sentence.Fawles:\nI couldn't believe it. That woman. She betrayed me.Valerie:\nThat man... Terry Fawles... He killed her! He threw her off the bridge! He threw my beloved sister into the roaring river 40 feet below!Fawles:\n...These 5 years... All I wonder is... Why! ...Why! ...Why! ...Why! Why did she lie!? That's all I want to know!Armando:\nSo that's why you called her. You wanted to hear the truth from Valerie herself.Fawles:\nYes... but I forget what she look like. So I tell her to wear scarf. I don't want to hurt her! ...Just ask why! Why! Why did you lie...? Why did you betray me...? I just want to hear answer come from her mouth. That's all!Mia:\n(So that's why... That's why you made a crazy escape like that...)Armando:\nJust one thing, Zebra Boy... My senses are tingling all over. Tell me, Mr. Fawles... Where is it?Mia:\n...Huh? Where's what?Armando:\nCome on now, Kitten... The ransom. The 2 million dollar diamond. Remember that now? Did you give it back to Pops? Did the police take it?Fawles:\n...I dunno.Mia:\nHuh? You don't know?Fawles:\nNo really. I dunno. It's gone. With Dahlia.Mia:\n...With Dahlia?Fawles:\nThat day. On the bridge... Dahlia put it. In backpack... Now gone. With Dahlia. Gone... Forever... Into Eagle River...Mia:\n(It disappeared with Dahlia, huh...? Wait a minute...!)Bailiff:\n...You can come back in now! We're about ready to go!Mia:\nMr. Fawles! Just one more question! When you said, \"with Dahlia\", do you mean the diamond is still missing...? Along with the body of Dahlia Hawthorne?Fawles:\n... Never found her... My sweet Dahlia...Mia:\n(They never found her...!)Fawles:\nSwallowed by river... Gone... Dahlia... My Teen Angel...Armando:\nYour \"Teen Angel\"...? How old was she anyway?Fawles:\nJust 14...Mia:\nF-F-Fourteen!? (I guess you were robbing cradles before diamonds...)Armando:\nShe plans a fake kidnapping and disappears into the river with a rock worth 2 mil... Man oh man... Angels these days.Mia:\n(Fawles takes the fall... And gets a one-way ticket to Death Row... Is Dahlia Hawthorne an angel or is she really a...)Armando:\n...It's time, Kitten. It looks like we have a few more aces up our sleeve now.Mia:\n...You bet!Diamond added to the Court Record.Armando:\nThe training wheels come off now, Mia! You've got to strike while the iron is hot! That's one of my rules. Remember it.February 16, 1:49 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nNow then, let's continue with the trial of Mr. Terry Fawles. ...Witness. Are you feeling better?Melissa:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... I-I'll try my best.Judge:\nHmm... You're a brave young lady.Mia:\n(Not this again...)Edgeworth:\nI can understand a defense lawyer wanting to get her client off the hook... However! To try to pin the crime on an innocent student is...Mia:\nWhat are you talking about!?Edgeworth:\nMy witness is not the person on trial here. She's an innocent bystander who witnessed a violent crime. ...That's all. What possible reason would a girl like this have for murdering a policewoman!Judge:\nHmm... It's certainly hard to imagine this woman as a murderer...Mia:\n(Her motive, huh... I figured that's what I had to establish next...)Judge:\nWell, Ms. Fey? Do you have any evidence of a motive?Mia:\n... Err, yes! Of course! ...I think.Armando:\nHah...! You're still acting as tame as a kitten... Kitten.Mia:\nMr. Armando...Armando:\nListen... A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets.Mia:\n...!Armando:\nSmiling on the outside while your guts are twisted in knots is the mark of a pro.Mia:\n...Maybe so, but I wish you would quit grinning at me like that.Melissa:\nUmm... Excuse me... May I speak, Mr. Judge?Judge:\nOf course! Mr. Judge is ready anytime you like!Melissa:\nI'd like... I'd like to say something. Some people here are suspicious of me, right? Th-That's why... I... I at least wanted you, Mr. Judge, to know that it's not true...Judge:\nHmmmmm! I see! You're such an honest and upstanding young lady.Armando:\nIt looks like this witness is a real professional.Mia:\nWh-What do you mean!?Armando:\nLook at that 100-watt smile. ...Just when things are darkest for her... CLICK. She lights right up!Judge:\nVery well then! Let's hear what the witness has to say!Witness Testimony-- Melissa Foster's History --Melissa:\nI...

What we're here to evaluate is whether this witness has any connection to this case.\nMelissa:\nI've lived abroad ever since I was a little girl...

But Eagle Mountain is a two-hour drive from here and no trains run through there. There are plenty of mountains that are closer and easier to get to.\nMelissa:\nWell, I went there once with the college Hiking Club. I fell in love with its stark, desolate beauty and its cold, yet romantic, gloominess...\nMia:\n(Didn't know you were such a goth...) By the way, what's the name of your college...?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution objects to any questions that involve the witness's private life.\nMia:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nAll that matters is that she is a material witness to a crime. The witness doesn't need to respond to questions that are clearly malicious in intent.\nMelissa:\nThank you! She's really gone too far...!\nJudge:\nHmmmmm! Ms. Fey! You're treading on thin ice here!\nMia:\n(I hardly said anything! Talk about sensitive...)Melissa:\nAnd I certainly don't have any reason for wanting to hurt a police officer.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nPerhaps, but your behavior that day was very suspicious! Not only have you contradicted yourself here in court, but you know things you shouldn't. For example, the scratches on the trunk of the car.\nMelissa:\nWell th-that's...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately Ms. Fey, your last statement proves nothing.\nMia:\nOh really!? And why is that?\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness came to the police station once to identify the suspect. It's entirely possible that, at that time, an officer showed her this photo.\nJudge:\nHmm... That seems like a rather serious mistake.\nArmando:\nHa...! That's the oldest trick in the prosecutor's book.\nMia:\nTh-That's not fair...!\nMelissa:\nThat wicked inmate... I'll never be able to forget that horrible day...Melissa:\nHolding a grudge and killing the officer who testified against you 5 years ago...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nA grudge...?\nMelissa:\nWell, the policewoman's testimony was crucial, wasn't it? ...Crucial in getting the defendant sentenced to death.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, and that's precisely why he harbored such deep anger against her. So much anger that he forgot his own guilt...\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMy client has always maintained that he's innocent of those charges!\nMelissa:\nHe seems rather forgetful. ...Your client, I mean.\nMia:\n...!\nMelissa:\nNot only did he forget about what he did, but he forgot the poor policewoman as well.\nMia:\nWhat do you mean by that?\nMelissa:\nYour client... He forgot what the detective looked like, right? It's too bad for her that he didn't forget about her testimony as well.\nMia:\n(Well, she's right about that. Mr. Fawles is kind of forgetful...)\n\n\n\nWait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Any more damage to my client's image could be a disaster... The judge already has a bad enough opinion of him...)\nJudge:\nYou just can't trust someone with a bad memory. What did you eat for dinner one week ago today? ...At the very least, a person should remember that much. As for me, it was payday, so I had a nice moose steak with some poutine on the side.\nMia:\n(...And how does this relate to anything!?)\nEdgeworth:\nWhether it's eating steak or committing murder, a person shouldn't deny their actions. I'm in complete agreement, Your Honor.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nYou said, \"he forgot what the detective looked like.\" What did you mean by that?\nMelissa:\nWell he couldn't tell who she was without some kind of identification, right?\nEdgeworth:\nQuite right... That's why the victim was wearing a scarf as identification.\nMelissa:\nWhy, if I had been wearing a white scarf that day... ...then he probably would have tried to kill me...\nJudge:\nHmm... That's true. He's clearly a bitter man!\nMia:\n(This is bad. Mr. Fawles's reputation just keeps getting worse and worse. Sometimes it's best not to poke too deep... What should I do with that last statement?)\n\n\n\nHave it added to the testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nYour Honor! What the witness said just now was tremendously important! I'd like it added to the official testimony!\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution has no objection... After all, the defendant is a killer and a mentally unbalanced one at that... That testimony only helps to further prove that point...\nJudge:\nHmm...!\nMia:\nN-No, that's not why I...\nJudge:\nEnough. ...Witness, if you would?\nMelissa:\nMy pleasure, Mr. Judge.\nAdds statement \"I guess I'm lucky I wasn't wearing a white scarf.\"\n\n\n\n\nLeave it alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Any more damage to my client's image could be a disaster...

It's February now. Everyone is wearing scarves. If I had accidentally worn a white scarf like he said...\nEdgeworth:\nThen you yourself might have been killed.\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... That would've been a terrible loss for this world!\nArmando:\nHa...! It looks like you pressed too hard this time, Kitten.\nMia:\nMr. Armando...\nArmando:\nKeep looking around you and you're going to lose sight of the finish line. Justice is blind, but she's not deaf. Sometimes you have to know when not to talk.Present Scarf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWitness... I want you to look at this photo you took. It's hard to see in the photo, but look at the scarf the victim wore as identification.\nJudge:\nAh, you are talking about this scarf right here, eh?\nMelissa:\nY-Yes! That's it! The scarf the policewoman was wearing...\nMia:\n(I've got her now, just don't mess up...) ...But that's strange. In your testimony, you stated the following... \"I guess I'm lucky I wasn't wearing a white scarf.\"\nJudge:\nWh-White?\nMia:\n...This is the scarf you identified as belonging to the victim. But it certainly doesn't look white to me!\nMelissa:\nOh...!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, it was foggy that day... And it was raining as well! It's not surprising that she mistook it for white!\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSorry, but not this time. The witness just confirmed that this was the victim's scarf!\nJudge:\nYes, but... What's the significance...? It's true that the scarf doesn't look white, but...\nMia:\nThere's only one explanation for this mix-up! The reason why the witness thought the scarf was white is...!\n\n\n\nPresent Victim's Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Witness.

Urgh...!\"Present Victim's Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\n...It's true. Mr. Fawles did give instructions to Valerie Hawthorne about their meeting. The note that she left said: \"Wear white scarf for identification.\"\nJudge:\nYes, what about it...?\nMia:\nIsn't it obvious!? Doesn't it strike you as odd!? That note was a secret piece of evidence! How is it that the witness knows about it!?\nMelissa:\nAh...!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Hmm... It is odd, isn't it? Well, Mr. Edgeworth!? Did you show top-secret evidence to the witness...?\nEdgeworth:\nY-Your Honor... I certainly never gave anyone permission to do such a thing.\nMia:\nIn that case, the only way the witness could know about the note would b--\nMelissa:\nJ-Just a moment! Of course... Of course I didn't know about the note! It's just... I saw it when it happened. ...With my own eyes. When the victim went to see the killer... She used her own scarf to signal him. That's why... That's why I assumed that the signal was a white scarf.\nJudge:\nHmmm... I suppose that makes sense.\nMia:\n(Come on, Mia! You can't let her weasel out of it that easily!) ...Witness! Sorry, but your explanation isn't going to work here.\nMelissa:\nB-But why!? It-It's true! That's what I saw!\nMia:\nImpossible.

Drink some of this and then think it over again. Listen. Keep messing up like that and you're going to get the judge mad.\nJudge:\nMs. Fey! Don't just stand there casually drinking coffee!\nMia:\n(Oops... I think it's too late...) B-But Your Honor...! Th-There is one more person! There is a person besides Mr. Fawles and the victim that knew what the note said.\nLeads back to:\n\"That's right... A person that no one would have suspected...\"Mia:\nAnd that person is... Dahlia Hawthorne!Judge:\nDahlia Hawthorne...? I've never heard that name before.Mia:\nLook at the victim's note. This is what it says... \"Talk to Dahlia. Tell her this time...\" There is her name, right there.Judge:\nWh-What's this... So who is this person!? This... Dahlia Hawthorne...Edgeworth:\n*sigh*... Ms. Fey must be desperate if she's trying to bring the dead back to life.Judge:\nThe d-dead...?Edgeworth:\nDahlia Hawthorne was the victim's deceased younger sister. She was killed in a crime 5 years ago.Judge:\nKilled in a crime...? Y-You don't mean...!?Edgeworth:\nYes. She was kidnapped... And killed. By Terry Fawles!Mia:Mia:\nYou said she was \"killed\"... But was she really?Edgeworth:\nWhat are you implying...?Mia:\nOf course, people thought she had died 5 years ago... ...when she fell off of Dusky Bridge and was lost in the Eagle River. However! Her corpse was never found!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nShe was declared legally dead 5 years ago! As far as the law is concerned, Dahlia Hawthorne is officially dead.Mia:Mia:\nBut the fact remains that her body was never recovered! Dahlia Hawthorne was 14 years old, 5 years ago. If she were still alive, she would be 19 now. ...Melissa Foster. I believe that's the same age you are!Melissa:\nAh...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nEven you couldn't...! Ms. Fey...! You're not saying...!Mia:\nBut I am. That's precisely what I'm saying. This \"witness\" before us is the girl that was kidnapped and killed 5 years ago! This girl is in fact Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne!Judge:\nWHA...! WHAAAAAAT!Armando:\nHa...! Nice work... That was like tossing a grenade into a 3-alarm fire! But unless you can tie all the loose ends together... ...you're nothing but a hit-and-run arsonist.Mia:\nI... I understand. (If I can expose her true nature, I can turn this whole case on its head! Now is my chance to make Mr. Edgeworth squirm...!)Judge:\nHmm... Hmm... Hmmm... Witness! Just who are you anyway!?Melissa:\nI... I... I'm...Edgeworth:\nI didn't think it'd come to this. That's enough... You don't have to say anymore, witness.Melissa:\n... Yes. I understand.Judge:\nWh-What! Mr. Edgeworth! Explain yourself!Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. I have an admission to make. I honestly never thought the defense would pursue the matter this far...Judge:\nYou don't...! You don't mean...!Edgeworth:\n...Yes. The prosecutor's office isn't filled with fools, you know. Naturally, we conduct full background checks on all of our witnesses.Mia:\nWh-What did he say...?Armando:\nHa...! It looks like the kid knew. He knew her true identity from the get-go.Mia:\nNo way...! But then why...!Armando:\nIf you hadn't revealed her secret, he wasn't going to say anything about it. All he wanted was her testimony, so he made a little trade.Edgeworth:\nLet me introduce you to... ...the victim's younger sister, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.Judge:\nBut... But... I thought she died 5 years ago...?Edgeworth:\nWe thought so as well... But... Well, as you can see...Mia:\nWhy!? Why did she hide her identity for 5 years!?Edgeworth:\nThat has nothing to do with the current case. She was merely an accidental witness to a crime...Mia:Mia:\nAccidental...? I don't believe that for a minute! For the last 5 years, she's been playing the role of victim! And now we find her acting suspiciously at another murder scene!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nReally, Ms. Fey! I must say, your strategy here is painfully obvious. (Changed from [...Really, Ms. Fey! Your strategy is clearly obvious.] in the original release) You're trying to pin your client's crime on an innocent witness in order to win... ...At any cost.Mia:\nH-How dare you!Edgeworth:\nPlease, let us take a moment to think. Five years ago, this girl was kidnapped and nearly killed.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nBut even worse than that... 5 years later... ...Dahlia Hawthorne lost something much more precious. Her big sister. Ms. Fey must be insane to even suggest that she murdered her.Mia:\nWhaaaaat!?Judge:\n...I'm inclined to agree with the prosecutor's logic. Ms. Fey! Do you have any evidence to back up your assertion!? What possible reason would this witness have for killing her beloved sister!?Mia:\nW-Well you see... (I thought I was winning, but somehow he's turned it around on me!)Armando:\nHa...! I think you need a little push in the right direction, Kitten...The defense is prepared to present evidence supporting our claim!Mia:\nAh! That wasn't me! It was this guy... This crazy coffee addict...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI think we've heard enough empty threats from you, old man.Armando:\nHa...! What makes you think they're empty, boy?Edgeworth:\nBecause your prot\u00e9g\u00e9 looks like she's sweating bullets!Mia:\nAh...! (I AM sweating bullets!)Armando:\n...You think you're in a tough spot, huh?Mia:\nOf course! Aren't I?Armando:\n...No. You've just arrived at the moment of truth, that's all. Whether you win or lose... That's up to you.Mia:\n(Up to me...?)Edgeworth:\n*sigh*... The rashness of youth. How charming.Mia:\n(This coming from someone younger than me!)Judge:\nNow then, let's not waste any more time. ...Ms. Fey. What motive would this witness have for murdering her own sister, Valerie Hawthorne?Present Victim's Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...The story starts after Terry Fawles escaped.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...What is this? Is this the defense's idea of a joke?\nJudge:\nIf so, I certainly don't get the punch line... Well? Ms. Fey?\nMia:\nOh, that was... The rashness of youth!\nJudge:\nTh-The rashness of youth!? And what is your point in furthering such a stereotype!?\nArmando:\nThat witness stayed hidden for 5 years, Kitten. There must be a good reason for that. And somehow it must involve Valerie Hawthorne...\nMia:\n(OK, one more time, Mia! You gotta read the Court Record more carefully this time!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then, let's not waste any more time. ...Ms. Fey.\"Mia:\n...The story starts after Terry Fawles escaped. He called Valerie and told her he wanted to meet. This is the note she left... It says, \"Talk to Dahlia. Tell her this time, the whole truth must come out.\" ...Valerie Hawthorne gave Dahlia a warning. She told her she was going to reveal to the world the whole truth.Judge:\nThe whole truth...?Mia:\nThere was a dangerously important secret between Valerie and Dahlia. That's the reason Dahlia felt she had to kill Valerie... To keep her mouth shut permanently!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nA terrific story, Ms. Fey! If you like fiction, that is. Enlighten the court, Ms. Fey. What was this secret that was so important? Where's your evidence!?Armando:\nDahlia and Valerie Hawthorne, and Terry Fawles... There's only one important secret that connects them all...Mia:\nOh, yes... I know this secret. ...Your Honor! The defense would like to request further testimony.Judge:\nWh-What testimony?Mia:\nRegarding the kidnapping 5 years ago. We believe it will explain a lot of things. Such as the nature of the important secret between the Hawthorne sisters!Dahlia:\nUgh...!Judge:\n...Very well. I'll grant your request for further testimony. I know it will be painful for you, but can enlighten us once more, my little maple leaf?Dahlia:\nY-Yes, I-I'll try. Mr. Judge...Mia:\n(Putting on the old charm one more time, Dahlia? But this will be the last time you hide behind your womanly wiles!)Witness Testimony-- 5 Years Ago --Dahlia:\nFive years ago, I was kidnapped by Mr. Fawles.\nThe ransom price was a raw diamond. My sister, Valerie, brought it to the bridge...\nAfter she made the exchange, she shot Mr. Fawles in the arm!\nThat's when Mr. Fawles tried to kill me by shoving me off the bridge from behind!\nI survived, but I was afraid I might be kidnapped again for my family's money...\nSo I decided to change my identity and start a new life...Judge:\nHmmm...Edgeworth:\n...The kidnapping left her emotionally scarred. With her sister's help, she left the Hawthorne family and started all over again. And we're to believe after all that, she murdered her sister? Preposterous!Judge:\nThank you, Mr. Edgeworth. ...Ms. Fey?Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.Judge:\nAs you've heard, the witness is still traumatized from the kidnapping. ...I'll ask you again to be extremely gentle in your cross-examination.Mia:\n(...Mr. Edgeworth got the jump on me again...)Armando:\nHa...! If we're not allowed to fight, then let's twist some arms. ...Listen up. We've still got that info... That ace up our sleeve.Mia:\n...What info?Armando:\nCome on, Kitten. Don't say you've forgotten already. The fact that the kidnapping 5 years ago was staged!Mia:\n(That's right, it was a fake kidnapping! Terry Fawles told us that in the lobby.)Fawles:\nI do anything she says. Anything Dahlia says...Mia:\nWhat you're saying is that the kidnapping 5 years ago was planned by...Fawles:\nYeah. Me and Dahlia... ...And Valerie, too.Mia:\n(Yes! That's it! The fake kidnapping is your best shot, Mia! That's her secret!)Cross Examination",

Did he just call Mr. Fawles a clever fellow?)Dahlia:\nThe ransom price was a raw diamond. My sister, Valerie, brought it to the bridge...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nI heard the diamond is valued in the neighboorhood [sic] of 2 million dollars.\nJudge:\n2 million dollars!?\nDahlia:\nIt was still uncut, so it was about the size of a pint of milk.\nJudge:\nHMMMMM!!!

Not as a detective, of course, but as an individual.\nMia:\nBy the way, I want to ask you, Mr. Edgeworth. Why do you think he wanted to make the exchange up there on that mountain? If he ever got surrounded, it would be hard to escape...\nEdgeworth:\nThere's one thing a kidnapper wants to prevent, and that's police involvement. In a place like that, it would be easy to tell if he was being followed. With only one entrance to the mountain, he was ensuring his safety.\nDahlia:\nWhat a wickedly clever man that Mr. Fawles is...\nMia:\n(Yeah, right. It was all YOUR plan...)\nDahlia:\nAnyway, Valerie brought the diamond to the mountain and...Dahlia:\nAfter she made the exchange, she shot Mr. Fawles in the arm!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nThat was a dangerous thing to do considering you were being held hostage.\nDahlia:\nYes, but...  Actually, that saved my life.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean?\nDahlia:\nYou see, Mr. Fawles was holding a knife in his right hand... Somehow, I just KNEW he was going to use it. I knew he was going to use that knife to kill me!\nMia:\n...!\nDahlia:\nThat's why my sister shot him! It was to save me!Dahlia:\nThat's when Mr. Fawles tried to kill me by shoving me off the bridge from behind!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nI'd like to hear more about what happened right at that moment!\nDahlia:\nWell, when Mr. Fawles was shot in the right arm, he let go of me... I-I was dazed. I turned to try and run away, but Mr. Fawles turned to grab me as well... As I ran past, he and I locked eyes for a second, and he gave me a large, bloodthirsty grin.\nJudge:\nB-Bloodthirsty grin... Oooh...\nDahlia:\nAnd in the next instant...\nEdgeworth:\nI advise the court to remember that the river is 18 feet deep and incredibly swift...\nDahlia:\nI-I was a strong swimmer, but I was knocked out... When I came to, I had been carried away by the river to a strange place. I'll never forget that day. The crumbling bridge, nowhere to run... Then just one little shove from behind. That was it. Before my sister could catch me... ...I fell into the river.Present Dusky Bridge Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You say that Mr. Fawles pushed you into the Eagle River...\"Dahlia:\nI survived, but I was afraid I might be kidnapped again for my family's money...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAnd that's why you hid your identity?\nDahlia:\nYes... I only told my sister.\nJudge:\nValerie Hawthorne, eh.\nDahlia:\nYes, she's the only one who knew about me.\nEdgeworth:\nMeanwhile, legally, this witness has been deceased for 5 years.\nDahlia:\nI... I didn't ever want something like that to happen to me again.Dahlia:\nSo I decided to change my identity and start a new life...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAnd that new identity was \"Melissa Foster\", right?\nDahlia:\nYes, my sister helped me get the official paperwork taken care of.\nMia:\n(That makes sense... Without an insider's help, doing all of the paperwork would've been impossible.)\nDahlia:\nShe was the only person left in the world I could count on. And you... You think I k-k-killed her... There's no way I could!\nJudge:\nHmmmmm...!Armando:\nIt's the moment of truth for this witness, too. Once the truth about this staged kidnapping comes out... Everyone in the court will know how much of a Jezebel she really is!Mia:\n(I've just got to prove that kidnapping was a hoax!)Mia:\nYou say that Mr. Fawles pushed you into the Eagle River... However, that's hard to believe.Dahlia:\nB-But it's true! I felt a push on my back... I'm certain of it! It was Mr. Fawles!Mia:\nI'm sorry... I guess I wasn't clear enough. I shouldn't have said, \"that's hard to believe.\" I should've said, \"That's impossible.\"Dahlia:\nI-Impossible...?Mia:\nI ask that the court recall the condition of Dusky Bridge, now and 5 years ago. That bridge hasn't changed one bit in these last 5 years. If someone had pushed you from behind as you have claimed... ...instead of being carried away by the river... ...you would have been smashed by the bedrock below! A most certain death.Dahlia:\n...Mia:\nDo you understand now, Dahlia Hawthorne? The very notion that my client pushed you from behind is impossible!Dahlia:\n... Aaaaaah!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor, this event occurred 5 years ago! Why, for all we know, the water level in the river may have been higher back then.Mia:Mia:\nBut it's 40 feet from the bridge to the river! A small change in the water level wouldn't have made a difference!Edgeworth:\nUgggh!Judge:\nY-You're right! If the events occurred just as the witness has testified... ...then the defendant couldn't have pushed the witness into the river. Young lady! What is the meaning of this!?Dahlia:\nUuuh! I... I... I, err... You see, I...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nJust a moment, Your Honor! It's true that the witness testified that the defendant pushed her into the river... However! She never stated that she fell from the back end of the bridge!Mia:\nWhat... What do you mean?Edgeworth:\nAfter being shot in the arm, it's plausible that Mr. Fawles panicked! Therefore, he could have unwittingly pushed her off the side of the bridge!Judge:\nIf that's true, she would have fallen into the river! Well, Miss Hawthorne!? Is Mr. Edgeworth's explanation correct...?Dahlia:\n... Now that you mention it... I do remember now. When I fell off the bridge... ...my skirt got caught on one of the bridge's side wires!Mia:\nYou can't be serious!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court!Edgeworth:\nIt seems Ms. Fey's assault has finally reached its conclusion.Mia:Mia:\n(Not now, Mia...! This is no time to retreat!) Unfortunately for you... this is just the start of Ms. Fey's assault!Edgeworth:\nWh-What?Mia:\nI believe your reasoning went something like this, Mr. Edgeworth. \"After being shot in the arm, it's plausible that Mr. Fawles panicked! Therefore, he could have unwittingly pushed her off the side of the bridge!\" However! Once again, I'm forced to say, \"That's impossible!\"Edgeworth:\nR-Ridiculous! What's so impossible about it!?Mia:\nBecause your flawed logic contradicts the Court Record!Present Witness's Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor! All of the answers are right here in this photo!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nThis evidence shows the fatal error you've made!\nEdgeworth:\n... It's a fatal error, alright. Unfortunately... The error is yours, not mine.\nMia:\n(Uh-oh, here it comes...)\nJudge:\nMs. Fey. At this point in the trial, I can't just let that pass!\nMia:\nOuchie. (Come on, Mia! Take your time and think it over again!)\nLeads back to:\n\"I believe your reasoning went something like this, Mr. Edgeworth.\"Mia:\nYour Honor! All of the answers are right here in this photo! Take a look at the wires supporting both sides of the bridge! They extend up to about five feet off the ground... It would be impossible to push someone off from there!Dahlia:\nNNNNOOOOOOO!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nB-But let's remember the size and strength of the defendant! Wires like this wouldn't be a problem for him! He could have easily picked up a 14 year old girl and thrown her over!Mia:Mia:\nSo young, and already so forgetful, Mr. Edgeworth. Mr. Fawles had been shot in the right arm.Judge:\nAh...!Mia:\nAnd more importantly... ...Valerie Hawthorne had her gun trained on him... at point-blank range!Edgeworth:\nUgh...!Mia:\nSo! Mr. Fawles throwing the witness off the bridge? That is clearly impossible!Edgeworth:\nGWAAAAAAAHHH!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Wh-What is the meaning of this!?Mia:\nDahlia Hawthorne! You jumped into the Eagle River intentionally!Judge:\nWhat...!? What is this...!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nIndeed! What do you mean by such a ridiculous remark!?Dahlia:\nY-Yes! It's ridiculous! My sister was there to help me! She had her gun and handcuffs. She could have saved me... Jumping into a raging river like that... That would have been suicide!Mia:Mia:\nPerhaps... But still, that's exactly what you did! You were probably confident that you could handle the swift current. But even more so... ...the witness had a much more compelling reason for jumping into the river!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nOh? Then what was it!? What was so important that she'd want to jump into the river!?Mia:\nThe witness is still alive. This fact alone explains everything! This is why she risked her life by jumping into the rapids of the Eagle River!Present Diamond\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Five years ago...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat isn't even worth a reply. Ms. Fey. I hold you personally responsible... ...for confusing the court and causing great emotional pain to the witness!\nJudge:\nI have no choice but to impose a penalty on you.\nMia:\n(This is an easy one, Mia! What was it she was after...? Even Edgeworth must have realized it...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"The witness is still alive. This fact alone explains everything!\"Mia:\nFive years ago... ...something else disappeared along with Dahlia that day. The item that Valerie brought up the mountain with her... The 2 million dollar diamond!Dahlia:\n...!Edgeworth:\nAAAAAHHH!! N... No... It-It can't be...!Mia:\nYes. Dahlia had it all planned from the beginning! The 2 million dollars... She was going to keep it all for herself! She forced Mr. Fawles to help her fake the kidnapping...*BANG!*Mia:\nAt the last minute, she betrayed him and threw herself into the river... ...with the ransom tucked away safely in her backpack...Edgeworth:\nWhy that's... that's simply ridiculous!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nY-Your Honor! Five years ago, the witness was only 14 years old! Do you really think a 14 year old is capable of such a demonic plan!?Mia:\nThis woman IS a demon. And there was one more person who helped make a demon out of her. Her sister... Valerie Hawthorne.Judge:\nY-You mean the victim was involved in the kidnapping plot as well!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nBut she was a detective then! You're saying she participated in her sister's kidnapping!?Mia:\nPrecisely! I'm sure that it weighed heavily on her conscience for the past 5 years. This is the sole reason behind the victim's murder.Judge:\nWhat do you mean by that?Mia:\nOn the day of the murder... ...after receiving the phone call from Mr. Fawles, Valerie called her sister, Dahlia. And then she told her what she was planning to do.Judge:\n\"Planning to do\"...?Edgeworth:\nShe was going to tell the whole truth... As she wrote in her note!Mia:\nTHAT is what sealed Valerie Hawthorne's fate... THAT is when you hatched your demonic plan to kill two birds with one stone. A plan that would ensure neither of your accomplices to the kidnapping would talk. And THAT is why... ...you killed your sister, Valerie Hawthorne!... Hee hee...Judge:\nWh-Who is that!? Laughing at a time like this!Dahlia:\nForgive me. It's just hilarious...Judge:\nW-Witness? Is that you?Dahlia:\nYou amuse me, woman! MS. MIA FEY...Mia:\n...!Dahlia:\nYou can certainly weave an exciting tale... Naturally... you have the evidence to back it up, don't you?Mia:\nEv-Evidence...?Dahlia:\nEvidence that I planned the kidnapping, of course... That at 14, I plotted it with Mr. Fawles and my sister.Mia:\nW-Well, I...Dahlia:\nAnd one more thing. What happened to the 2 million dollar diamond? If you can't provide evidence to at least show that...Judge:\nHmmmmm... Well, Ms. Fey?Mia:\nI... I don't know...Dahlia:\nWhat a joke. YOU, MS. FEY... Are you stupid or something?Mia:\nNnrgh...! (How can I prove a fake kidnapping that happened 5 years ago!? I don't even have decisive proof of Valerie Hawthorne's murder...)Judge:\nWell it seems... that we've come to the end. To be honest, the witness's behavior does raise certain suspicions... However, I am forced to reject the assertions made by the defense.Dahlia:\nOf course you are.Mia:\n(Is this it...? Is it really over...? That girl has made a fool of me and there's nothing I can do about it!)Armando:\nHa...! Without evidence the trial is over? Who decided that?Mia:\nM-Mr. Armando!Armando:\nCome on now, Kitten. Haven't you figured out that you can make your own rules? For example, even if there's no evidence, there's still testimony!Mia:\n(T-Testimony...?)Armando:\nOn the day in question, Dahlia Hawthorne murdered her sister, Valerie Hawthorne. She hid her body in the trunk of Mr. Fawles's stolen car and then went to meet with him... ...disguised as her sister, Valerie Hawthorne. That's what you think, right?Mia:\nY-Yes, that's right...Armando:\nIn that case, there's only one answer, right? There is only one person left who can testify about Valerie Hawthorne's murder!Mia:\n(Since there's no proof, there's only one thing left to do! Who is the one person who can testify to that demon woman's crimes...?)Present Terry Fawles profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor! The defense wishes to call a new witness!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nArmando:\nListen up. This is your last chance. Think it over carefully one more time.\nMia:\n(Relax, Mia! This is easy...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"On the day in question, Dahlia Hawthorne murdered her sister, Valerie Hawthorne.\"Mia:\nYour Honor! The defense wishes to call a new witness!Judge:\nA new witness?Mia:\nYes! We would like to hear the testimony of Terry Fawles!Edgeworth:\nThe defendant...!?Mia:\nThere's only one person that can shed any further light on the situation... Only one person that knows what Dahlia's role in the kidnapping was... Only one person that can say whether the person in the photo is Valerie Hawthorne... ...or whether it was in fact her younger sister Dahlia, disguised as her. There's only one person who can solve this riddle once and for all... And that person is... Terry Fawles!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth? What is your take on this?Edgeworth:\n... Why not? The prosecution has no objection.Judge:\nVery well. Bailiff! Bring the defendant to the witness stand!Mia:\n(This is my last chance, Mr. Fawles... My last chance to establish Dahlia's guilt... You're all I have left!)Judge:\nDefendant, you've heard everything that's been said up to this point, yes?Fawles:\nUhh... Umm... I don't believe it! No way! Dahlia died! Five years ago! Valerie betrayed me!Mia:\nMr. Fawles... I don't know what she said to you 5 years ago, but one thing is clear. Dahlia is very much alive. And you were used. For 2 million dollars.Fawles:\nThat's... Not... True...Judge:\nMr. Fawles. There's only one question I want the answer to. Two days ago on Dusky Bridge... who did you meet? Was it Valerie Hawthorne? Or was it Dahlia Hawthorne?Fawles:\nDahlia... Dahlia... Did you... betray me? ... Five years ago she promised... She promised... Never, ever betray each other...Dahlia:\nTerry...Fawles:\nDahlia! It-It's true! You are alive...!Dahlia:\nYou don't trust me anymore? That makes me sad.Fawles:\nTell the truth! The real truth! I... I believed in you!Dahlia:\n... I shouldn't NEED to say it. You should already know...Fawles:\n...!Dahlia:\nBut... There is one thing that I WILL say. My life is in your hands right now, Terry.Fawles:\nDah...lia...Judge:\nI will allow Mr. Fawles to testify once and once only. Well then, Mr. Fawles. Yours will be the final testimony in this trial.Fawles:\n...Judge:\nWitness!Fawles:\nGAAAAAAAHHH!!!!Judge:\nEeeeek! I'm sorry! I apologize!Fawles:\nUwah! Uwah! UWAAAAH!! W-Water! P-Please! Water!Mia:\nHmm?Fawles:\nCan't talk... Need water...Armando:\nHa...! Oh well, I guess it'll have to be my coffee instead. At least it'll match the way he's probably feeling right now... Darker and bitterer than Hell itself.Fawles:\nUWAAAAAH...Witness Testimony-- Who Terry Fawles Saw --Fawles:\nThat day... 4 PM... I stopped the car. I was in front of bridge...\nShe wasn't there...So, I waited on bridge.\nI watched my car from bridge. I never put no body in that car!\nFinally, one woman came. She stood front of me.\nWe talked... Then she left.\nThat was... That was Valerie. Not my Dahlia!Mia:\nMr. Fawles! You're covering for her! Do you think she would do the same for you...!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThat's enough, Ms. Fey! His last statement was a fitting way to end the final testimony of the trial...Mia:\n...!Judge:\nWell then, Ms. Fey... Please proceed with your cross-examination.Mia:\n(Is this how you want it to end, Mr. Fawles? Another guilty verdict to go along with your death sentence!?)Armando:\nThere's only one person who can stop it... You, Kitten. ...I think.Cross Examination",

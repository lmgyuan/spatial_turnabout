  "previousContext": "Episode IV\nThe Adventure of the Clouded Kokoro\nAnime cutscene\n'I begin to think, Wilson,' said Sholmes, turning his head languidly in my direction, 'that there is more to this case than that which we have observed. Indeed, that there may be another part to this story that we are yet to discover.' His eyes wandered, following the steam rising from his cup of herbal tea, leading him to the distant memory of that snowy evening - to the young lady, collapsed on the pavement along Briar Road, and to the knife in her back. Lit in the soft glow of gas lamps, a most extraordinary scene had been set, and under the cover of a light fog, the curtain had risen silently on the insoluble mystery of our invisible killer.\n19th February, 9:47 a.m.\nBritish Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office\nSusato:\nDid you sleep last night, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nNo...not at all.\nSusato:\nIt was an enormous hotel, wasn't it? The rooms were so luxurious! I felt like we were staying in a palace! And with all the gas lights twinkling, it was brighter than day even in the middle of the night!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat about the enormous beds? After my time on the SS Burya, I wasn't going to waste a single inch of that space. I spent the entire night rolling from one side of the mattress to the other.\nSusato:\nOh yes, it really was the sort of night you can only dream of normally. Except... ...when I learnt that we owed three pounds for the rooms, that dream quickly turned into a nightmare.\nRyunosuke:\nOops! ...Sorry about that. The building was so impressive, and the entrance so inviting, I just...wandered in without thinking.\nSusato:\nIn a lodging house in Japan, that sum of money would put a roof over your head for a whole year. I did try, but...I'm afraid I couldn't help my tears when we were presented with the bill.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh... I really am sorry...\nSusato:\nWell, never mind. We must find some more affordable lodgings straight away, though. If we're not careful, our entire stipend will be used up in ten days or less.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh... London is a scary place...\nAh, good morning to you at this early hour.\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Yes! Um...we...erm... Well!\nSusato:\n...Good morning to you, Lord Chief Justice. We have come to report on the outcome of the trial at the Old Bailey yesterday.\nRyunosuke:\n(Susato-san is amazing. She doesn't bat an eyelid, even in the presence of the imposing Lord Stronghart.)\nStronghart:\nYes, I believe you had a very comprehensive initiation into British courtroom practices.\nRyunosuke:\nOh...yes! It was very...eye-opening, thank you!\nSusato:\nAnd...in accordance with your instructions, Lord Stronghart... ...Mr Naruhodo performed his duty to the end.\nStronghart:\nYes...I've already been apprised of events. You conducted a remarkable defence. ...You may consider the test passed.\nRyunosuke:\nOh!\nStronghart:\nNo longer are you a student from the Empire of Japan... You may henceforth claim to be...a fully fledged lawyer! My country is delighted to welcome young talent from such a remote Eastern land.\nRyunosuke:\nUm...thank you very much! (So...I'm a lawyer now...)\nStronghart:\nNow, in view of your new appointment, I have a fresh case in mind for you. I'd like you to take it on at once. ...I trust that won't be a problem?\nRyunosuke:\nAnother case? Already?\nStronghart:\nNothing trains a lawyer better than practical experience. ...I'm sure I don't sense dissatisfaction, do I?\nRyunosuke:\n......... It's just that yesterday's trial ended...unusually. I haven't quite come to terms with it.\nStronghart:\nWhat's to come to terms with? The man was cleared. ...What more were you hoping for?\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nJudge:\nThe culpability of the defendant has not, at the present time, been established by this court. Consequently... ...the jury will not be required to proffer judgement.\nMcGilded:\nWell, Lord van Zieks...it's been a pleasure, so it has. And as for you, my dear fella...I couldn't have asked for a better defence!\nWah hah hah hah hah!\nRyunosuke:\nI just can't help wondering... if Mr McGilded really was innocent?\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo!\nRyunosuke:\nIt's just that I never managed to ascertain the truth. And then the trial ended.\nStronghart:\n......... Well, you needn't let it trouble you for a second longer.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nSusato:\nWhat do you mean, Lord Stronghart?\nStronghart:\nMagnus McGilded passed away. Immediately following the trial.\nSusato:\nNo!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! Mr... Mr McGilded is... ...dead?!\nStronghart:\nI have nineteen minutes and forty-one seconds until my next engagement. ...Time enough to talk.\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nStronghart:\n...Your time is up. You will have to excuse me. I would advise you to begin making preparations for tomorrow's trial. After all, the clock is ever ticking. There is now but twenty-three hours, twenty-six minutes and thirty-nine seconds until the court sits.\nRyunosuke:\n(Last time he mentioned the twenty-three hours, he said there was plenty of time...)\nStronghart:\nAnd one more thing...Mr Naruhodo... There is something I should like to ask you.\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Um...what's that?\nStronghart:\nYesterday, you remarked upon something... That you intend to see through the will of your late compatriot, Mr Asogi.\nSusato:\n...!\nStronghart:\nI would be interested to hear what exactly you mean by that... ...inside thirty-four seconds.\nRyunosuke:\nOh, well, erm... Kazuma always used to say, you see... ...that he wanted to learn how the greatest justice system in the world worked so he could change ours in Japan. Now that he's gone, I'd like to work towards that myself. ...And...there's another thing...\nSusato:\nOh!\nStronghart:\n'Another thing'? Continue...\nRyunosuke:\nOn the way here, on the steamship, he said something to me...\nThere's something very important that I have to do.\nStronghart:\n'Something very important'? And what, exactly, would that be?\nRyunosuke:\nHe...never had a chance to tell me. I suppose he would have done...if he'd ever made it to Great Britain.\nStronghart:\n...You're out of time. Well, thank you for an enlightening discussion.\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo! What's all this about?! Mr Asogi never once mentioned anything of the sort to me!\nStronghart:\nI urge you both to focus your attentions on the matter at hand. I've taken the liberty of summoning the police inspector in charge of the case. He'll be able to apprise you of the details.\nRyunosuke:\n(How long has he been there?)\nStronghart:\nSo...I wish you the best of luck...and bid you farewell.\nSusato:\n......... 'There's something very important that I have to do.' Kazuma-sama... What did you mean...?\nRyunosuke:\nI wish I knew. But honestly, he never told me. ...Anyway, we had better talk to the detective, don't you think?\nSusato:\nYes, you're right!\nRyunosuke:\n(I hope I'm just imagining it, but I wouldn't say he looks pleased to see us at all.)\nAfter clearing all Converse options with Tobias Gregson:\nGregson:\n...Right, well, I've filled you in as requested, and I'm very nearly out of chips... So I'll be headin' back to the crime scene now. We're still carryin' out a few investigations there.\nSusato:\nIt was Briar Road, you said, didn't you? Where the incident took place.\nGregson:\nThat's correct, ma'am. And if you head over to the holding cells you can meet the criminal himself.\nRyunosuke:\nYou've branded him a criminal already?\nGregson:\nHe's as good as. Shakin' like a leaf in his cell, he is. ...It'll give you a chuckle if nothin' else. He's inmate fifty-three. Speak to the jailer and he'll show you the way.\nRyunosuke:\nInmate fifty-three... Thank you. ......... (...So there's no helping anyone against the Reaper of the Bailey, they say...)\nSusato:\nIs something troubling you, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\n..........\nSusato:\nTo tell the truth, when I recall the trial yesterday, I can't stop myself from shaking. The idea of facing the Reaper in court again is... Well, if you think it's too much for you, there's no shame in turning the case down. That takes courage, too.\nRyunosuke:\n......... But if the man they've arrested is innocent...\nSusato:\n...!\nRyunosuke:\n...You could well imagine he would be shaking like a leaf in his cell. And I for one wouldn't find the sight of that funny.\nSusato:\nSo...\nRyunosuke:\nIf I'm honest, I'm still reeling from the shock of yesterday's events myself. And I'm really not sure if I'll be able to help this man, whoever he is. But I'd like to try. So I think I'm going to make some enquiries. ...Will you help?\nSusato:\n.........\nDid you really think you had to ask? After all...I am your judicial assistant!\nRyunosuke:\nThank you... So then...shall we?\nSusato:\nYes! Let's go!\n19th February\nLocal Prison, Cell 9\nRyunosuke:\nSo these are British prison cells...\nSusato:\nOh, they're ghastly. It feels just like a dungeon.\nRyunosuke:\nYes. And having experienced it in Japan myself... ...I can assure you that our wooden cells feel a lot cosier than these cold, stone walls.\nSusato:\nOh, don't, Mr Naruhodo! You're making it seem worse!\nRyunosuke:\n(Apparently, our client is in this cell here. But it's so dark at the back there, I can't make him out. I wonder what he's like...)\nBailiff:\nInmate fifty-three! Your legal representative is 'ere to see you! Stop 'iding at the back of the cell and show your face at once!\nAm I...? Am I a cat, as yet with no name?! Calling me by a number! It's utterly, unbelievably, unjustly unreasonable! I refuse to answer!\nSusato:\n......... Mr Naruhodo, what...? What do you think is going on here?\nRyunosuke:\nI have no idea. But I wasn't just hearing things, was I? That tirade of complaints was in Japanese!\n???:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nErm, excuse me, but who-\n???:\nShh! Quiet! ......... They're all around. Hiding. I know they are! They're watching...listening...even now... I... I can sense it! .........\nRyunosuke:\nUm...right... So, could I ask you, who exactly-\n???:\nThere you are! You've come to curse me, haven't you? Don't try to hide it! You're a ghost!\nRyunosuke:\nA ghost?!\n???:\n.........\nSusato:\n......... We mean you no harm, prisoner-san. Are you... ...Japanese, by any chance?\n???:\n......... This is... This is... BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS!!! Forgive me for that outburst before. I'm so sorry.\nRyunosuke:\nOh, it's...fine. We were just a little surprised, that's all.\n???:\nImagine it! It's been twelve long months since I left my hometown! And here I am, in a frightful fix in a foreign land! So hearing the sweet, sentimental tones of a compatriot's voice here in this damp, dark hellhole was a...a...\nMost Monumentally Moving Moment!\nRyunosuke:\n(Who could have guessed that this new client Lord Stronghart assigned to us... ...would turn out to be a fellow Japanese?!)\n???:\nAh... ...what compassion my fellow countrymen show! To dispatch a first-class lawyer all the way from Japan to defend a mere foreign student!\nNoble, Nurturing, Never-Failing Nippon!\nRyunosuke:\nA, a first-class lawyer? (Oh dear, I think there's been something of a misunderstanding here...)\nSusato:\nI wonder... Would you be so kind as to tell us what's happened? Why you've been detained as a suspect, for example.\n???:\nYes... Yes! I can! I will!\nShan't Stay Sullen and Silent!\nSusato:\nI'm not quite sure I understand what he means, but...he seems happy!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, he does... (I just hope he actually has a good reason to be...) Thank you for your cooperation. I am a lawyer, as you said. My name is Ryunosuke Naruhodo.\nSusato:\nAnd I am Naruhodo-san's judicial assistant, Susato Mikotoba.\n???:\nI am... ...a visiting student, sent here by our government.\nSoseki:\nNotably, Notoriously Named Natsume! ...Soseki Natsume.\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nSoseki:\nMr Naruhodo Esquire!\nRyunosuke:\n...Oh, you can just call me Naruhodo. And when we're speaking English, a simple 'Mister' is more than enough.\nSoseki:\nOh. Yes. Um... Alright. Yes... They've, they've really got to me. This country is poisoning my mind! ......... But please, I beg you to defend me in court tomorrow. You can tell them what really happened. You'll do it...won't you?\nRyunosuke:\nWell, erm...\nSoseki:\nWhy?! WHY?! Why is it so hard to say 'yes' to me?!\nRyunosuke:\nWell, the thing is...I'm just a student like yourself. On a study tour.\nSoseki:\nA, a student...?\nRyunosuke:\nI have defended a case in the Old Bailey. Only the one, though. But at this moment in time, I really don't know what I'm supposed to believe in. I'm...confused about what justice in this country even means.\nSusato:\nOh, Naruhodo-san...\nRyunosuke:\nI'm not even the foreign student who was supposed to be here. I'm...a sort of locum lawyer, I suppose.\nSoseki:\nBut! But that armband! That's the mark of a defence lawyer from our great empire!\nRyunosuke:\nIt's a keepsake from the man who should have been here. ...He was my best friend.\nSoseki:\nA, a keepsake? ......... I know exactly what they're saying about me.\nSusato:\nOh... Who do you mean?\nSoseki:\nThe lawyers. All the British defence lawyers. They won't defend me.\nSusato:\nGoodness! Why...why do say that?\nSoseki:\nFor the same reason as you noted before. When it happened... ...there was only the victim and myself around. And I ran away from the scene of the crime. I'm not a fool. I know it looks as though I must be the culprit.\nRyunosuke:\nIt must be very hard for you, Soseki-san...\nSoseki:\nAnd anyway, I'm a student from overseas. I'm just a foreign nobody to them. Someone not to be trusted. I heard them openly laughing about me before. In my earshot, without any compunction at all. 'Any trial for this man would be a waste of time,' they said. And, 'Of course the foreigner did it!' They even had the gall to say, 'The man doesn't understand half of what's being said anyway!'\nRyunosuke:\nThat's awful...!\nSoseki:\nThey're wrong! I've studied more English than half of the policemen out there on the streets! I've travelled halfway around the world to learn about these people's country and its great history! But no one here wants to listen to a man with a strange accent. They all hate me! So...at the very least... ...I'd like to entrust my fate to someone who can listen to me, in my native tongue.\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nSoseki:\nYou could do it. ...Couldn't you? When I look into your eyes, I can see it. I can see what you've been through.\nRyunosuke:\n...Soseki-san, it's just that... ......... Give me a little time, please.\nSoseki:\nHm?\nRyunosuke:\nI'll do what I can, for the time being.\nSoseki:\nWhat do you mean?\nSusato:\nWe shall investigate the case as thoroughly as possible. If we can find some clues, it will give us a much better chance, I'm sure!\nSoseki:\n......... Oh yes! Yes! Thank you! I'll be here! All alone! Waiting for you...Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire!\nSusato:\nWe should be going then, Naruhodo-san. We have a case to prepare for!\n19th February\nBriar Road\nGregson:\nWhat's the Japanese delegation doin' here?\nSusato:\nOh! Inspector Gregson!\nGregson:\nThis isn't on the tourist trail, as I'm fairly sure you're well aware.\nSusato:\nYes! Of course! We're here to investigate.\nGregson:\nSo you've been to the holdin' cells, then? What d'you make of the criminal?\nSusato:\nHe's not a 'criminal' as you put it, Inspector. He's a suspect.\nGregson:\nHmph. We'll see about that. You Japanese like to stick together, I s'pose. Well, do what you will. It doesn't bother me. The bloke's in court tomorrow whatever happens. And the verdict's a foregone conclusion.\nRyunosuke:\n(Ugh...the stone-cold air of rejection...)\nSusato:\nTake heart! London at this time of year is full of stone-cold air!\nRyunosuke:\nThat...makes it worse somehow...\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nRyunosuke:\n(Well... I don't think we're going to get any more useful information out of the detective.)\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo, can I make a suggestion?\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Yes, what is it?\nSusato:\nWell, it seems to me... ...that we MUST speak with him about this!\nRyunosuke:\n......... By 'him', do you mean... ...Mr Sholmes?\nSusato:\nYes! Mr Herlock Sholmes! Exactly!\nRyunosuke:\n(Look at those shining eyes! You can't wait, can you?) Well, Mr Natsume did blame Mr Sholmes for all of this, didn't he?\nSusato:\nYes, he did! He really did! Which makes him an involved party in the case. Are you just going to ignore that? ...I hope not! ...I assure you, it's not simply my selfish desire to meet with Mr Sholmes again!\nRyunosuke:\nThe trouble is... ...we have no idea of the man's address, even. So how-\nSusato:\nIt's Baker Street!\nRyunosuke:\nH-How do you know that?\nSusato:\nIt's in the stories, of course! 221B Baker Street... The most famous address in the world!\nRyunosuke:\nOh...I see... Well, there's nothing to stop us from going, I suppose... (We'd better try to find our way there before Susato-san gets any more excited and unpredictable...)\nSusato:\nHurrah! I'll summon a carriage!\nRyunosuke:\n(So, we're to have a reunion already... ...with the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes.)\n19th February\nLocal Prison, Cell 9\nSusato:\n...It seems that we can't meet with Mr Natsume at the moment.\nRyunosuke:\nOh...\nSusato:\nHe's being briefed about his appearance in court tomorrow, apparently.\nRyunosuke:\nI see. (Yes, the trial is only a day away...) Alright then, let's come back later.\nSusato:\nYes.\nRyunosuke:\n(I really hope he's not answering any more questions with inappropriate textbook answers like, 'Yes, I do!')\nSholmes's Suite\nAnime cutscene\nRyunosuke:\nThank you very much.\nMan:\nIt's just up there, overlooking the street. Good day.\nRyunosuke:\nThanks again. This is it...the residence of Mr Herlock Sholmes.\n19th February, 12:53 p.m.\nSholmes's Suite\nRyunosuke:\nSo this is where the great detective makes his living... (It feels surreal to be here somehow...) Is it as described in the stories, Miss Susato?\nSusato:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nUm...Susato-san?\nSusato:\nMany, many famous cases have been solved here in this very room.\nRyunosuke:\nOh! I, I suppose they must have been, yes... (I've never read the stories, so it's hard to get quite as excited about it as she seems to be...)\nSusato:\nThe detective chases the villain relentlessly as he disappears into the fog down an unlit London street... Oh, the thrill of it! The romanticism! Can't you feel your heart thumping in your chest? Can't you, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nOh! I, I suppose I can, yes...\nSusato:\nSo, if you don't mind... ...I'll just stand here and soak up the atmosphere for a while longer. Please, don't mind me.\nRyunosuke:\nHaah... (She's obsessed... Well... ...it looks like our detective friend isn't home at present.) Excuse me! Is anybody home?\n???:\nOh! Do we have a visitor? Hello! Is it a big new case for Mr Sholmes?\nRyunosuke:\nErm...hello. ......... Wait. Aren't you...?\n???:\nOh! How rude of me! I'll go and make some tea at once!\nRyunosuke:\n(I'm sure it's the same girl...) Miss Susato! Did you see the girl who was just here?\nSusato:\nOh yes... Isn't it truly extraordinary? To think that the King of Bohemia came to this very room to ask Mr Sholmes to take on his case...\nRyunosuke:\nThe, the King of Bo-where-ia?\nSusato:\nKing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, of course!\nRyunosuke:\n...Sorry, I'm drawing a blank. Forget 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' for a moment, and look over there!\n???:\nThe tea's brewed! And I have a freshly baked cake as well!\nSusato:\nAh! It's you!\nRyunosuke:\n(I knew it. Susato-san recognises her, too.)\n???:\nAh! There you are!\nAnd taking that with you as well! I was looking forward to the trial run of my experimental smoke grenade launcher! Oh, good day to you! I'm...well, the inventor, I suppose, of that machine.\nRyunosuke:\n(It's the girl who turned up at the end of Mr McGilded's trial in the defendants' antechamber.)\n???:\nI've never met a lawyer from the Far East before! Poor you, having to get straight to work when you've only just arrived in London.\nRyunosuke:\nOh...yes, it was...challenging.\n???:\nWell, try this tea. It's my special blend, you know!\nRyunosuke:\nOh...um, thank you. (Is tea supposed to look that colour?)\nSusato:\nOh my! What a fragrant yet mellow flavour!\n???:\nHurray! It's a winner! I tried blending different leaves designed to alleviate fatigue, you see. You must be exhausted after your long voyage here. And you have another ticklish trial tomorrow! Oh, and you're to defend a Japanese man. I do wish you lots and lots of luck!\nRyunosuke:\nErm...\nSusato:\nDid Mr Sholmes tell you about us, by any chance?\n???:\nOh! You know Hurley, do you?\nRyunosuke:\n(...'Hurley'? 'Mr Sholmes' to you, surely?)\nSusato:\nMr Sholmes was a fellow passenger on the boat that brought us to Great Britain, you see.\n???:\nWas he really? Well, I had no idea! I'm afraid Hurley's out on an errand again today, even though he's just returned from overseas.\nRyunosuke:\n(Wait a minute... We met this girl for the first time ever yesterday after the trial. And only briefly at that. How on earth does she know so much about us?) Did she...deduce...all those things, do you think...?\nSusato:\nAnd perhaps more to the point... ...why is she here in Mr Sholmes's suite?\n???:\nOh! Silly me! I haven't introduced myself, have I?\nIris:\nIt's a great pleasure to meet you both. My name is Iris Wilson. I live here together with Hurley.\nRyunosuke:\nAh, Iris, is it? What a lovely name!\nSusato:\nWHAT?!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat's the matter?\nSusato:\nNo, wait, this, this can't be... Did, did you... Did you say that your, your name is...'Wilson'?\nRyunosuke:\n(What's the matter with Susato-san? Why is she so flustered all of a sudden?)\nIris:\nYes, that's right! And what are your names?\nRyunosuke:\nOh, um...I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo, a lawyer from Japan.\nSusato:\n......... Oh! Sorry... I'm Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant, Susato Mikotoba. It's wonderful to meet you!\nIris:\nLovely! Susie and Runo... Got it!\nSusato:\n'Susie'...?\nRyunosuke:\nAnd 'Runo'...? (There's more to this girl than meets the eye... I have so many questions for her, I don't know where to start!)\nSusato:\nYes, and so do I!\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nRyunosuke:\nThank you for answering so many of our questions, Iris. This has been very informative.\nIris:\nOh, you're most welcome! I've had so much fun!\nRyunosuke:\n...Do you happen to know where Mr Sholmes is at the moment? As you guessed, we'd like to ask him some questions about this case as well.\nIris:\nAh well... ...I expect Hurley is still investigating the scene.\nRyunosuke:\nOf the case involving Mr Natsume, you mean?\nIris:\nYes, Mr Nuts...ooh-may? Hurley said he was going to the man's lodgings. If you leave now, you'll probably catch him there.\nSusato:\nIris! Do you know where those lodgings are?\nIris:\nWell...I imagine the police are still investigating the scene of the crime themselves, aren't they? Did you happen to come across a detective by the name of Gregson when you were there?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, we know Inspector Gregson.\nIris:\nAh, goody. In that case... ...give Gregsy this from me, would you? If you do that, I'm sure he'll tell you what you want to know.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat is this?\nSusato:\nA five shilling piece and a postcard, it seems...\nIris's postcard has been entered into the Court Record.\nSusato:\nIt reads: 'Tell the gentleman in black whatever he wants to know. I trust that won't be a problem?' Gosh! This will make the inspector help us, will it?\nRyunosuke:\n...Well, thank you, Iris. We'll give it a try.\nIris:\nGood luck, then! I'm going to return to writing my manuscript. 'The Speckled Band'! And I'll be making more special blends of tea, so come back again soon!\nSusato:\nWe'd be delighted! Thank you so much, Iris. Well, Mr Naruhodo...it's back to the scene of the crime!\nRyunosuke:\nSo, somewhat dubious that they would exert any influence over the men of Scotland Yard at all... ...we headed back to the scene with Iris's curious note and one of the world's heaviest silver coins in hand.\nTo be continued...\n19th February, 2:38 p.m.\nBriar Road\nRyunosuke:\nIt looks as though the police are still here, carrying on with their investigation.\nSusato:\nPerfect! So let's find Inspector Gregson as quickly as possible!\nRyunosuke:\nYes... And let's see if he'll take a break from his chips to look at that silver 'tip' Iris gave us for him!\nRyunosuke:\nErm, Inspector Gregson...do you have a moment?\nGregson:\nI'm sorry to say I don't. I'm a very busy man. Much too busy to talk to a pair of foreign gadabouts, that's for sure.\nSusato:\nWe have these for you. A present...from Miss Iris Wilson.\nGregson:\nWHAAAAAAT?! For me?! From Her Ladyship?\nRyunosuke:\nHer Ladyship?\nGregson:\nGive that here! At once! Come on! Hand it over! That's for me!\nRyunosuke:\nAgh! (Don't wait for me to give it to you, will you?)\nRyunosuke:\nUm...what was that coin exactly?\nGregson:\nIt's a silver crown, obviously. But it's a lot more than that. It's...well... It's an appearance fee, that's what it is!\nSusato:\nAn appearance fee? ...Oh! I see. You mean...\nGregson:\nThat's right. For 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. Her Ladyship always offers me a little financial reward for featurin' me. Every time!\nSusato:\nYes! Yes, of course! ...I know all about your exploits, Inspector! I read them avidly!\nGregson:\n'Course, her usin' my name without my say-so does make me the butt of a lot of unpleasant jokes, but still.\nRyunosuke:\nI am sorry, Inspector. That must be difficult for you.\nGregson:\nNever you mind that! So...what d'you want to know then, eh?\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nGregson:\n'Tell the gentleman in black whatever he wants to know. I trust that won't be a problem?' it says. Well obviously it's not a problem! Go on, fire away. What d'you want to know?\nSusato:\nWell, if you wouldn't mind, Inspector... ...we'd very much like to know the address of Mr Natsume's lodgings!\nGregson:\nAh, the little knife-wieldin', moustached Japanese fellow? He lives in a right old hovel. It's just over there, look. On the first floor of that house on the corner where that wreck of a bicycle's propped up.\nSusato:\n...That is nearby indeed.\nGregson:\nIf I remember rightly, the landlord is a Mr John Garrideb. ...Right, well... If you see her again, you make sure you give Her Ladyship my regards, you hear? I mean it! You tell her that Gregson sends his very best wishes!\nRyunosuke:\nD-Don't worry, Inspector. We will.\nGregson:\nGoodbye for now then. And long live Her Ladyship!\nSusato:\nWell, at least he told us what we wanted to know before he left.\nRyunosuke:\nYes. So then, shall we go and see what we can find in Mr Natsume's lodgings?\nSusato:\nDefinitely!\n19th February\nMr Natsume's Lodgings\nMaid:\n...May I help you?\nRyunosuke:\nAh, yes, would this be the residence of...Mr John Garrideb?\nMaid:\nIndeed it would, sir. And who may I say is calling?\nRyunosuke:\nMy name is Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I, erm...\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo is representing Mr Soseki Natsume. I believe he takes lodgings here?\nMaid:\n...!\nSusato:\nWe would very much like to ask him some questions about our client.\nMaid:\n...! ...One moment, please. I shall convey the message to Mr Garrideb.\nRyunosuke:\nDid you see that, Miss Susato?! That was a real-life English maid!\nSusato:\nI know! As I understand it, anyone of standing in English society employs a number of household staff. But that was the first time I've ever seen one in the flesh! Oh, this day keeps getting better!\nRyunosuke:\nIt certainly feels like we've really arrived now, doesn't it?\nSusato:\nWe need only to meet a butler, and the experience will be complete!\nRyunosuke:\nWell, I'm not sure if I'd go that far, but...I understand the sentiment.\nMaid:\nThank you for waiting. Mr Garrideb will see you now. This way.\nSholmes's Suite\n19th February\nMr Natsume's Room\nRyunosuke:\nWha...? Just look at this place! (And smell it! It's so musty in here. I suppose it's the mountains of old books that are responsible for that.)\nSusato:\n......... I don't think I've ever seen so many books in all my life!\nRyunosuke:\nNo, me neither. It's so dark in here, too.\nSusato:\nIs that the window over there?\nRyunosuke:\nWell, it WAS the window, I think, yes. Once upon a time. (But for some reason it's been closed up with bricks and mortar.) So this is where Mr Natsume lives...\nSusato:\nBy the way... ...I haven't spotted Mr Sholmes anywhere, have you?\nRyunosuke:\nNo, that's true. But according to what Mr Garrideb told us... ...the great detective should be around here somewhere investigating.\nSusato:\nAaah! Look, Mr Naruhodo!\nRyunosuke:\nAh-ha! There he is! (Where did he appear from?)\nSusato:\nHe seems to be engrossed in the pages of an old book. I hope he won't mind if we disturb him... Hellooo! Mr Sholmes!\nSholmes:\n...! Ah, you two! Good day. Now, let me see... Where was it that we met?\nSusato:\nOh, Mr Sholmes! We were together on the SS Burya.\nSholmes:\nYes, of course! The Burya. And let me see... What happened on that voyage?\nRyunosuke:\nIt was Kazuma Asogi. He died...tragically. But you were a great help to us.\nSholmes:\nAh yes, but of course! The case of Mr Asogi! It was the one with the snake, wasn't it?\nSusato:\nOh!\nRyunosuke:\nWell...you seem to remember...something of it, at least.\nSusato:\nWhat an honour, to be remembered vaguely by the great Herlock Sholmes! This is Mr-\nSholmes:\nOh no no, my dear madam, hold your tongue! I pride myself on my superior powers of recollection. Your names are safely recorded in my brain-attic. Miss Naruhodo... ...and Mr Susato!\nRyunosuke:\n...Try the other way around, Mr Sholmes.\nSholmes:\nAh ha ha ha ha hah! I lose the first round!\nSholmes:\n...In truth, I had hoped to invite you both to my Baker Street suite the day we arrived in London. But some Scotland Yarders ambushed me at the railway station and whisked me away to a crime scene. It was an entirely trivial case, of course. I solved the matter in no more than thirty minutes.\nRyunosuke:\n(So they apprehended Soseki-san in THAT short an amount of time?)\nSholmes:\nI'm afraid the pursuance of a new case has dulled my recollection of my past involvements a little.\nRyunosuke:\n'A little'?\nSholmes:\nIt is a mistake to think that one's brain-attic has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. I do my best to forget useless facts, lest they should elbow out the useful ones. Yes! Those are my own words of inimitable wisdom, you know. From an adventure entitled, 'A Study in Scarlet'.\nRyunosuke:\n...Please, there's no need to quote yourself.\nSholmes:\nI don't always remember my pearls of wisdom, but fortunately, my associate pens them beautifully.\nRyunosuke:\n(He means Iris, I suppose.)\nSusato:\nMr Sholmes... ...we have some extremely important questions to ask you about the 'trivial case' you just mentioned!\nSholmes:\nGoodness! What an earnest expression. My dear madam, I should be only too pleased. And this murky room is an apt place to discuss the murky case!\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nSholmes:\nWell, I believe I've told you all I can now.\nRyunosuke:\nThank you, Mr Sholmes.\nSholmes:\nAh yes, Mr Naruhodo... ...was it not your intention to become a practitioner of law?\nRyunosuke:\n...! (You remembered that, did you?)\nSholmes:\nWill you perhaps be offering your services in this very matter, I wonder? To the occupant of this room, Mr...Natsume, was it?\nRyunosuke:\n......... I'm not sure.\nSholmes:\nNot sure? On what grounds?\nRyunosuke:\nWell, I actually defended someone in court here only yesterday.\nSholmes:\nReally? Well then, I congratulate you, sir, on an ambition realised. And so promptly, too.\nRyunosuke:\nThe thing is... ...it's really made me question things. Am I right to believe in my clients? To trust in their innocence?\nSholmes:\n......... Hm, yes. Trust...\nRyunosuke:\nMr Sholmes... ...Mr Natsume didn't do it, did he?\nSholmes:\n......... Ah ha ha ha ha hah! My dear fellow, I haven't the first idea!\nRyunosuke:\nOh! But... ...I thought that's why you were here. Didn't you come back to investigate?\nSholmes:\nAh yes, that was indeed my initial intention. But there are simply too many fascinating books here. I couldn't possibly ignore them.\nRyunosuke:\nOh...I see.\nSholmes:\nNevertheless, there are two facts that I can state quite unequivocally. The man who fled the scene of the crime two days ago was the Japanese occupant of this room. And... ...there are witnesses who swear to having seen the same man commit the crime. ...That is all I can say.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nSholmes:\nAh, and one more thing...\nSusato:\nOh! What is it, Mr Sholmes! Tell us!\nSholmes:\nI cannot say with any certainty whether or not it is of relevance to this case, but I am quite sure... ...that the retired army man who owns this property... is hiding something.\nRyunosuke:\nMr Garrideb is...? (Mr Sholmes said as much before actually, didn't he?)\nSholmes:\nAnyway, at present, that is really all that plays on my mind in relation to this case.\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo... ...as yet our investigations have uncovered nothing that could help establish Mr Natsume's innocence.\nRyunosuke:\nNo, you're right. (Perhaps it's time we probed a little deeper into Mr Garrideb's secret...)\nSholmes:\nJust remember, I cannot be sure whether the landlord's secret will prove to be of relevance or not. But I wish you every success, of course, Mr Naruhodo!\nRyunosuke:\n(Hm, a busy man, indeed... He's gone back to his book in the corner of the room.)\n19th February\nMr Garrideb's Room\nGarrideb:\nAh, you pair again. Tell me, was the detective chap - I forget his name - still hard at work down there?\nSusato:\nMr Herlock Sholmes?\nGarrideb:\nAh yes, rings a vague bell. All that detective business isn't really my thing, I'm afraid.\nRyunosuke:\nWell, Mr Sholmes is...in his element down there.\nGarrideb:\nJolly good show. Another cup of tea, if you please, Joan. ...Now then, why don't you tell me what- AAAAAAAAARGH!!! For the umpteenth time, woman, will you watch what you're bally well doing?!\nMaid:\nI shall be serving dinner shortly, sir.\nGarrideb:\nHm? Ah... Yes, of course. Frightfully rude of me, but I'm afraid I shall have to ask you to take your leave, if you'd be so kind?\nSusato:\nOh, yes, of course. We are deeply grateful for all your assistance.\nGarrideb:\nNot at all, not at all! Don't get much chance to talk with young foreigners like yourselves. It's been a pleasure. Best of luck, and all that. ...Perhaps you could see yourselves out.\nRyunosuke:\n(According to Mr Sholmes... ...Mr Garrideb is hiding something. And since no other avenues of investigation seem open to us at the moment, perhaps we should do some digging.)\nRyunosuke:\nAh... (What's he doing over there?)\nSusato:\nM...Mr Sholmes?!\nSholmes:\nAh-ha! We meet again, my dear fellows!\nGarrideb:\nGood gracious! When did you sneak in here?\nSholmes:\nHerlock Sholmes, sir, at your service.\nMaid:\nWhatever were you doing over by the window?\nSholmes:\nI am given to watching the evening sky as the sun sets, madam. Yet sadly, cheerful as the room downstairs undoubtedly is, it lacks an aperture for such observation. So I took the liberty of borrowing a small corner of space by the window up here.\nGarrideb:\nHmph. Well...\nRyunosuke:\n(Keeping an eye to one's windows at dusk is the prudent thing to do in London, I'm gathering...)\nSholmes:\nAh, and one other thing, Mr Naruhodo...\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Me?\nSholmes:\nI thought perhaps you might be in need... ...of a certain great detective's...great mind!\nRyunosuke:\n...! (Wait, he's not talking about...? Is he? I, I didn't expect to be going through that again so soon...)\nSusato:\nDo you mean, Mr Sholmes...?\nSholmes:\nThere is a mighty secret in this modest room. My eyes see even the most trivial of trifles. I take it you're prepared, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nI, I think so!\nSholmes:\nThere is just time enough for one of my greatly admired great deductions. Let us conclude the matter before dark! Mr Garrideb... ...though it would seem you are a military man of considerably distinguished service... ...your standing as a landlord is most certainly not what one might call, 'first-rate'.\nGarrideb:\nHm?\nSholmes:\nI'm afraid, sir, that it is all too clear to me. There are two conclusions I have been able to draw by careful observation of your living arrangements.\nGarrideb:\nI beg your pardon?\nSholmes:\nThe first... ...is that even as we speak, you are concealing the presence of a ferocious beast in your care!\nGarrideb:\nEh?\nSholmes:\nAnd the second... ...is that as a result of the beast's violent rampage, you have lost something very dear to you!\nGarrideb:\nAh! Er...\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo, look!\nRyunosuke:\n(The old man's broken out in a cold sweat... Unbelievably, it seems Mr Sholmes's conclusions...are both spot on!)\nGarrideb:\n...How? How could you possibly...?\nSholmes:\n'How could I possibly know?' you mean to enquire? The answer couldn't be simpler, sir. For in the dense jungle of logic and reasoning...I am the king of beasts!\nGarrideb:\nAgh!\nSholmes:\nAnd I know only too well, that wild beasts are not easily tamed. So...shall we begin? Once again, Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!\nThe Great DeductionThe game is afoot!\nTopic 1\nNature of the Beast\nSholmes:\nIt certainly shouldn't take a great detective to see... ...that a fearsome beast has been on the rampage of late within these four walls. Thus we are faced with the question: What form might this beast take? Ah, for a man with a military breeding, your eyes are uncommonly candid.\nGarrideb:\nI...!\nSholmes:\nYour furtive glance, Mr Garrideb, leads us directly to the answer. The true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that lion statue! Yes, though an army man, you appear unimposing at best. A fact that has fuelled your admiration for the mighty lion, the king of beasts.\nGarrideb:\nWhat is this piffle, I ask you?!\nSholmes:\nIn the end, your admiration became so great, in fact... ...that you had a living, breathing specimen shipped from India, which you tried to keep in this very house!\nGarrideb:\nWHAAAT?!\nSholmes:\nYet living with such a wild beast proved more difficult than you had imagined. The chilling traces of a wild rampage are still very much in evidence.\nMaid:\nWell!\nSholmes:\nYet as we look around, the beast in question fails to present itself. Where could this angry creature have disappeared to... madam?\nMaid:\nM-Me?!\nSholmes:\nI pray you do not consider me unchivalrous, but it is plain to me with one glance in your direction.\nMaid:\nIt...it is?\nSholmes:\nYour dress pocket gives us a handsome clue as to the beast's current whereabouts! For protruding from it is a handbill advertising a circus show.\nMaid:\nAh!\nSholmes:\nYes, you sought to dispose of this terrifying lion, Mr Garrideb. At 'Batty's Circus'... ...a travelling show currently sojourning in a nearby park. I have observed the tents. You sold the savage lion, sir, to the circus troupe!\nGarrideb:\nI, I most certainly did not!\nSholmes:\n...I believe I have made my point. The fearsome beast which ran amok in this room...was an Indian lion! And a simple visit to the circus now will reveal the lion prancing jubilantly through a ring of fire!\nTopic 1\nNature of the Beast\nConclusion\nA rampaging Asiatic lion\nTopic 2\nAftermath\nSholmes:\nNow...Mr Garrideb... ...it is plainly clear that you still have deep feelings for this formidable 'beast'. Indeed, in that blithe pose, the distress this loss has caused you is veritably tangible.\nGarrideb:\n...!\nSholmes:\nYour head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that supporting arm. Amid fits of tears, you let your beloved beast go. The strain of losing something so dear to you is clearly visible in your visage.\nGarrideb:\nNonsense man! I, I simply...\nSholmes:\nBut what, we must now ask ourselves, is the true cause of this pain? And we need only follow the direction of your gaze to find the answer. Yes, it is this pile of bills that has given rise to the pain you suffer. Every envelope contains another demand for payment.\nMaid:\nAh...\nSholmes:\nFor cart-loads of meat, potatoes, wheat and tea. Indeed, feeding your beloved has had a devastating impact on the financial circumstances of your household. And so you had no choice but to let it go.\nGarrideb:\nYes, well, erm...\nSholmes:\nNow...in a final fit of rage, the ferocious beast carried out one last, unimaginable attack...\nMaid:\nUn-Unimaginable...?\nSholmes:\n...The aftermath of which can be clearly seen by observing the carpet over there! A very expensive woollen carpet, if I am not mistaken.\nMaid:\nOh dearie me...\nSholmes:\nWhat could have caused such a destructive outburst?\nMaid:\nAh...\nSholmes:\n...This time, madam, I'm afraid it is you who has inadvertently revealed the truth to me. Your wandering eye has settled upon the answer very neatly indeed. Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the tower of cakes!\nMaid:\nAh!\nSholmes:\nThere is no creature more dangerous on this earth than a beast with an unsatiated appetite. Was it or was it not once said by a noblewoman, 'If they have no bread, let them eat cake'? Food is at the heart of all tragedy, in fact.\nMaid:\nWhatever do you mean?\nSholmes:\nHaving tired of the taste of cake, the beast began to stalk its next prey. I'm sure I need not spell out the nature of this final act of destruction carried out by the beast. There is only one logical conclusion: Worked into a frenzy by hunger, the lion attacked and ate the carpet! The teeth marks in the carpet...are a perfect match with those of a lion I once saw in India.\nTopic 2\nAftermath\nConclusion\nCarpet gnawed on by the starving lion\nSholmes:\nThus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this beastly puzzle!\nGarrideb:\nAAAAAAAAARGH!!! What is the matter with you, Joan?! You're pouring scalding hot tea all over me!\nMaid:\nOh...I'm sorry, Mr Garrideb. I'm afraid I didn't notice.\nSholmes:\nMy deductions can be startlingly sharp. It stands to reason that your cup runneth over. Indeed, my revelations can make people spill tears at times, too.\nMaid:\nOh...\nRyunosuke:\nErm, Mr Sholmes, sorry to butt in...again. But could I make an observation?\nSholmes:\nWhy certainly, Mr Naruhodo. What is it...again?\nRyunosuke:\nWell, your deductions just now... Do you really think a lion could have fit inside a room of this size?\nSholmes:\nIndeed. It is the only explanation for the facts. The terrifying truth all too often lies beyond the realms of common sense!\nRyunosuke:\n(But wouldn't it be an idea to consider what lies inside the realms of common sense as well?)\nSusato:\nBut...if an uncaged lion had run amok in this very room... ...surely Mr Garrideb and his maid would have been hurt...or worse.\nSholmes:\nAh, that's where you are stuck. No doubt the former military man held his own against the beast using that large cannon.\nRyunosuke:\nI thought you said that they sold the lion to the circus...\nSusato:\nAnd what about the food? Meat and potatoes are one thing... ...but I don't believe I have ever heard of a lion that drinks tea.\nSholmes:\nAh, my dear Miss Susato. It occurs to me with some regularity... ...that irrespective of race and breeding, whenever anyone lands on Great British soil... ...they are infused with a highly appropriate taste for afternoon tea!\nSusato:\nOh! ...What a glorious notion! Well then, Mr Naruhodo! It's your turn to shine again!\nRyunosuke:\nI...had a feeling that was coming.\nSusato:\nA slight massage, that's all Mr Sholmes's deductions need. You can do it!\nSholmes:\nExcellent. I've been waiting for my trusty partner in deduction to step forward, Mr Naruhodo!\nRyunosuke:\n(...We don't even know yet whether or not this is going to help with Mr Natsume's case. Still... ...uncovering the truth is always worthwhile, whatever the motivation! ...At least, that's what I want to believe...)\nSholmes:\nLet us start again from the beginning... ...of Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!\nCourse CorrectionHold it, Mr Sholmes!\nTopic 1\nNature of the Beast\nConclusion\nA rampaging Asiatic lion\nSholmes:\nIt certainly shouldn't take a great detective to see... ...that a fearsome beast has been on the rampage of late within these four walls. Thus we are faced with the question: What form might this beast take?

The true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that lion statue!\nRyunosuke:\n...I really didn't see the lion thing coming.\nSusato:\nNo, but if you observe Mr Garrideb's reaction... ...it rather seems as though some beast did indeed run amok here in this room.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, something with a very fierce nature.\nSusato:\nBut it couldn't have been a lion transported from India.\nRyunosuke:\nSo what was it, then?\nSusato:\nWe must follow Mr Garrideb's gaze. That will lead us to the true answer!\nThe true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that lion statue!\nSusato:\nWell, what we do know with some certainty, is that a destructive creature has been at work in this room.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd that Mr Garrideb inadvertently looked in the direction of something that gives its identity away. (Yes, if we investigate thoroughly enough, we ought to find the answer.)\nSusato:\nWhat did Mr Garrideb turn to look at? It's here somewhere. We simply need to find it!\nRyunosuke:\nThe true nature of the beast that has run rampant here is revealed by that newlywed bride!\nSholmes:\nPrecisely, Mr Naruhodo! No other explanation could possibly fit! Yes, this framed print pictures your wife, Mr Garrideb. And while we lament the fact that her face is obscured...\nRyunosuke:\n...we can still make out her mighty arms, and note the considerable horsepower they must contain.\nGarrideb:\nOh, um...\nSholmes:\nIndeed! Surely any woman of such powerful constitution would be honoured to be described as a 'beast'!\nRyunosuke:\nUm...'honoured' might be stretching a point...\nSholmes:\nToo late! The fact remains that the beast, which so clearly savaged this room... ...was your wife, Mr Garrideb!\nGarrideb:\nGYAAARGH!\nSholmes:\nThe chilling traces of a wild rampage are still very much in evidence.\nMaid:\nWell!\nSholmes:\nYet as we look around, the beast in question fails to present itself. Where could this angry creature have disappeared to... madam?\nMaid:\nM-Me?!\nSholmes:\nI pray you do not consider me unchivalrous, but it is plain to me with one glance in your direction.\nMaid:\nIt...it is?\nSholmes:\nYour dress pocket gives us a handsome clue as to the beast's current whereabouts!\nSusato:\nThe poor, fragile, defenceless woman is beside herself!\nRyunosuke:\nWell... ...I don't know about 'fragile'.\nSusato:\nOh...dear... Anyway, Mr Sholmes is quite right. There's no sign of a Mrs Garrideb anywhere.\nRyunosuke:\nBut it seems there may be a clue as to her whereabouts. A clue that this maid is trying to hide! (I wonder where Mr Garrideb's wife could be...)\nYour dress pocket gives us a handsome clue as to the beast's current whereabouts!\nSusato:\nWe've already established who it was that caused all the damage in this room.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, Mr Garrideb's wife.\nSusato:\nIt's just a question of finding out where she is now.\nRyunosuke:\nFor some reason, I feel as though she's very nearby. (I just need to find the evidence to prove it...)\nRyunosuke:\nYour wedding ring gives us a handsome clue as to the beast's current whereabouts!\nMaid:\nAh!\nSholmes:\nIndeed it does! That flowery band gleaming on your finger gives you away! For it is identical to the one shown on the hand of Mr Garrideb's bride in this photographic print!\nRyunosuke:\nIn other words, you are no ordinary household maid.\nMaid:\n...!\nSholmes:\nNo... You are Mr Garrideb's lucky bride. You...are Mrs Garrideb herself!\nMaid:\nOh my... WOOOOORRRRDDDD!!!\nGarrideb:\n...Well. Jolly fine detecting, sir. As you rightly surmised, this is the wife, yes. My Joan. Rather let herself go, you might say, but she was a bally corker back- AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!\nSholmes:\n...It would appear that you don't live in the most comfortable of circumstances. After all, you are a retired army man, yet you are in the business of renting out rooms.\nGarrideb:\nTsk...\nSholmes:\nI would assume, therefore, that you have insufficient means to employ a maid. ...Would that be correct?\nGarrideb:\nIt's not right, I tell you! I was second lieutenant of the third regiment! A man has his pride, don't you know! By golly, it's a sorry thing when a chap can't even afford to have a single maid in his employ!\nSholmes:\nYes, here in London, one is rather judged. A household cannot be considered worthy of society if it employs no staff at all. Though in my considered opinion, such concerns about appearances are a folly.\nRyunosuke:\nYou, you mean Mr Garrideb has his wife...work as his maid?\nSholmes:\nPrecisely. ...Am I right, Mr Garrideb?\nGarrideb:\nOnly in company, obviously. But listen here! This must remain a secret! Tip-Top secret! Please!\nTopic 1\nNature of the Beast\nConclusion\nA rampaging Asiatic lion\nThe raging wife of Mr Garrideb\nSolved\nTopic 2\nAftermath\nConclusion\nCarpet gnawed on by the starving lion\nSholmes:\nNow...Mr Garrideb... ...it is plainly clear that you still have deep feelings for this formidable 'beast'. Indeed, in that blithe pose, the distress this loss has caused you is veritably tangible.\nGarrideb:\n...!\nSholmes:\nYour head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that supporting arm.\nRyunosuke:\nMr Sholmes is quite something. He's still calling Mr Garrideb's wife a 'beast'.\nSusato:\nYes, as a woman, that feels rather uncomfortable.\nRyunosuke:\nBut Mrs Garrideb is standing beside her husband as we speak. In other words...he hasn't lost his beloved at all, has he?\nSusato:\nOh, how true! So perhaps that supporting arm that seems to be propping up his head... ...has some other significance, then!\nRyunosuke:\nAccording to Mr Sholmes, Mr Garrideb's pain is tangible, though. (What could that pose of his really signify...?)\nYour head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that supporting arm.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat is the cause of this acute pain that Mr Garrideb obviously feels?\nSusato:\nIt's rather strange, you know. He always seems to look at us only out of the corner of his eye.\nRyunosuke:\nMaybe something is stopping him turning his head? (Perhaps we need to consider what this pain is from another angle...)\nRyunosuke:\nYour head weighs heavy on your shoulders. The pain you feel being revealed by that slapped cheek!\nSholmes:\nAnd of course, the deliverer of that impressive mark on your cheek that refuses to fade... ...was you, Madam Joan Garrideb!\nMaid:\nWell, yes...\nSholmes:\nYou have been desperate to hide the slap mark on your cheek, sir.\nGarrideb:\nAgh! How the blazes...? How did you work that out, man?\nSholmes:\nNothing escapes the notice of one trained in the art of observation, my dear fellow.\nRyunosuke:\nThat's why you haven't looked directly at us even once... To keep your other side from view!\nGarrideb:\nWell, um... Hmph.\nSholmes:\nNow then, let us proceed to the next conundrum. Why were you subjected to such a violent slap? In other words, we must ask ourselves what caused Madam Garrideb to fly into a rage? And we need only follow the direction of your gaze to find the answer. Yes, it is this pile of bills that has given rise to the pain you suffer.\nSusato:\nDidn't Mr Sholmes say that the bills were all for lion fodder?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, but now we've established that the lion never existed. Which can only mean that the thing responsible for gobbling up all that food... ...was Mr Garrideb's wife.\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo! She's a person, not a 'thing'!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, well... She's also a person who gave her husband a mighty slap round the face. One so hard that it left a perfect hand mark, in fact.\nSusato:\nYes, why would a woman want to hit her husband with such force, I wonder?\nRyunosuke:\n...I'd love to know the answer to that question.\nYes, it is this pile of bills that has given rise to the pain you suffer.\nSusato:\nWe already know what the cause of Mr Garrideb's pain is, of course, don't we?\nRyunosuke:\nThe slap across the cheek which left that bright-red mark.\nSusato:\nMr Garrideb and his wife seem to share a very deep and loving bond.\nRyunosuke:\nPerhaps. But it's said that the stronger people's feelings are, the more fiercely they react to betrayal.\nSusato:\nYou seem to know a lot about the ways of the heart, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\n...I read it in a popular novel that I borrowed from Kazuma. (So we're looking for a reason why Mrs Garrideb would have felt betrayed by her husband, then!)\nRyunosuke:\nYes, it is this love note that has given rise to the pain you suffer.\nSholmes:\n'Oh James, I love you. Yours, Mary'. ...Passionate indeed. Perhaps the sender of this note, a certain Miss Mary, is the fly in the ointment here?\nGarrideb:\nGAAARGH! But! I don't know the bally woman!\nRyunosuke:\nYou don't know her?\nGarrideb:\nThat note wasn't written to me! It was just in the book. I don't know how it got there!\nSholmes:\nIt was 'just' in there, you say?\nGarrideb:\nThat's right! That's what I've been say- AAAAAAAAARGH!!!\nMaid:\nA likely story!\nGarrideb:\nNow listen here, Joan, old thing! I explained at the time! I bought the book at that secondhand place. And that note must already have been in there.\nRyunosuke:\nSo...the previous owner of the book was using the note as a bookmark, you mean?\nGarrideb:\nThat's right! That's what I've been say- AAAAAAAAARGH!!!\nMaid:\nA likely story!\nGarrideb:\nFor heaven's sake, woman! Look at the name! It's written to 'James'! My name, in case you'd forgotten, is John! AAAAAAAAARGH!!!\nMaid:\nA likely story!\nGarrideb:\nAre, are you questioning my name now?!\nSholmes:\nAnd there we have it... Arouse the suspicions of the female heart, and you unleash a beast with a most ferocious bite.\nGarrideb:\nUgh...\nSholmes:\nNow...in a final fit of rage, the ferocious beast carried out one last, unimaginable attack...\nMaid:\nUn-Unimaginable...?\nSholmes:\n...The aftermath of which can be clearly seen by observing the carpet over there! A very expensive woollen carpet, if I am not mistaken.\nMaid:\nOh dearie me...\nSholmes:\nWhat could have caused such a destructive outburst?\nMaid:\nAh...\nSholmes:\n...This time, madam, I'm afraid it is you who has inadvertently revealed the truth to me. Your wandering eye has settled upon the answer very neatly indeed. Yes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the tower of cakes!\nSusato:\nBut...but surely Mrs Garrideb didn't...eat the carpet?\nRyunosuke:\nNo, of course not. But there doesn't seem to be any doubt... ...that the state of disarray that this room is in is a result of her wild temper.\nSusato:\n...No, that's true. So, this is the last part of Mr Sholmes's deduction that we need to fix. We need only to follow Mrs Garrideb's gaze, and that will tell us the real answer.\nRyunosuke:\nAlright. Let's see what we can see!\nSusato:\nYes!\nYes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the tower of cakes!\nRyunosuke:\nThe real question here is... ...was the carpet actually eaten by something, or did something else happen to it?\nSusato:\nPerhaps that would be answered by examining the carpet in more detail. If we can find another possible explanation, maybe it will lead us to the right answer.\nRyunosuke:\nGood idea! (Yes, the point is, how did the carpet end up like that?)\nRyunosuke:\nYes, to explain the dire state of the carpet, we need only look at the candlestick!\nSholmes:\nMost illuminating, my dear fellow! And of course, the only possible way out of this logical labyrinth.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, the remnants of a ferocious attack in which the carpet was devoured are clearly visible.\nSholmes:\nIndeed they are. The scorch marks at the edge clearly give the truth away.\nGarrideb:\nScorch marks?\nSholmes:\nIt would appear that this room was the scene of a little marital altercation.\nMaid:\n...!\nRyunosuke:\nMrs Garrideb's mighty arm muscles left an impression not only on her husband's face...\nSholmes:\n...but on the entire room. The force of her strike caused a candle to fall from the holder...\nRyunosuke:\n...and in seconds the carpet was alight, and the whole corner of the room in flames!\nGarrideb:\nYes, erm... Hm...\nSholmes:\nFor the most ferocious beast in this world is neither a violent lion nor a vengeful woman...but fire.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd in this room, that ferocious beast bared its claws and ran amok.\nSholmes:\nEloquently put, my dear fellow. So you see, there is but one conclusion here:\nAfter the sparks of marital discord flew, this room was the scene of a fire!\nGarrideb:\nMr Sholmes, sir... I salute yooooooooou!\nTopic 2\nAftermath\nConclusion\nCarpet gnawed on by the starving lion\nCarpet scorched by a small fire\nSolved\n\n\nDeduction CompleteElementary!\nGarrideb:\nIt's these dashed long winter nights, you know. Nothing to do but read in front of the fire. Luckily, there's a jolly good secondhand bookshop just around the corner. Buy all my old novels there.\nSholmes:\nAnd in the pages of one particular novel, you discovered some rather illicit material?\nSusato:\nFor which your wife admonished you harshly, it seems.\nGarrideb:\nI don't know about 'admonished'. 'Demolished' might be rather closer to the mark. And 'beast' is most certainly an apt des- AAAAAAAAARGH!!!\nRyunosuke:\n(Here we go again...) And the carpet? Was that destroyed by fire when a candle fell on the floor?\nGarrideb:\n'Fraid to say it was. Happened in the blink of an eye, you know. The whole place filled with smoke. Couldn't see a bally thing. I was caught between the old stick's rage and the raging flames.\nSholmes:\nYou paint a torrid picture, sir. ...One that would have been most entertaining.\nRyunosuke:\n(That's sympathy for you...)\nGarrideb:\nDidn't take long for the fire to spread, of course. The bally furniture started going up as well! We've had to hide the mess behind that screen for the time being.\nSusato:\nOver here, Mr Garrideb?\nSholmes:\nWell, you have nothing more to hide now. If you'll allow me...\nGarrideb:\nHad all my favourite old novels in that case. But as soon as the fire got hold of them, that was it. Whoosh! Up in smoke!\nRyunosuke:\nGosh...\nGarrideb:\nThen the wife started hurling things at me.\nSusato:\nWhat a terrible sight it must have been.\nGarrideb:\nThere was I, back up against the window, under heavy enemy fire! Incendiary books incoming ten to the dozen. Worst of it is, I lost my favourite. Book called 'The Lion's Pride'.\nSholmes:\n'The Lion's Pride'? Ah yes, your notorious love of big cats coming through again.\nGarrideb:\nI assure you, the title didn't influence my choice in the slightest.\nRyunosuke:\n(So the poor man really did lose something dear to him as a result of the ferocious 'beast's' rampage.)\nSusato:\nMr Sholmes's deductions turned out to be correct once again!\nRyunosuke:\n...It can only be described as a great British wonder.\nGarrideb:\nI tell you, it was total carnage. Flames everywhere and the old stick in full fettle!\nRyunosuke:\nOut of interest, what time of day was that?\nGarrideb:\nHm, not sure I can remember. It was two days ago now. Let's see... Around five o'clock, I think.\nSusato:\nSo at exactly the same time... ...as a terrifying incident was unfolding outside your window on the street below.\nGarrideb:\nHmph. Even more terrifying on the inside, I can assure you. The whole of Blighty could have been flattened outside my window at that moment... ...and I wouldn't have noticed a dashed thing!\nSusato:\nOh...really?\nGarrideb:\n.........\nJoan:\n.........\nSholmes:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nUm, Mr Sholmes...\nSholmes:\nYes, Mr Naruhodo? What can I do for you?\nRyunosuke:\nWell, I think we've got to the bottom of Mr Garrideb's situation now. But what does it have to do with Mr Natsume's circumstances?\nSholmes:\nI can't help you there, I'm afraid.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nSholmes:\nMy dear fellow, if you recall, I did say as much from the outset. I warned you that although I knew the retired army man to be hiding something... ...I could not be sure whether his secret would prove to be of relevance or not.\nRyunosuke:\nI... I just knew you were going to say that!\nSholmes:\nAh ha ha ha ha hah! Now now, Mr Naruhodo. You mustn't lose heart. Bear in mind... ...that all things fall into one of only two categories: Those relevant to the case, and those not.\nRyunosuke:\n...That makes no sense to me.\nSholmes:\nWell, no matter. It is of far greater importance that you make up your mind now.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nSholmes:\nVisiting hours at the prison will soon be over.\nRyunosuke:\n...! (Oh no! Is it that time already?)\nSusato:\nIf we're to accept Mr Natsume's case... ...we have official paperwork to attend to.\nRyunosuke:\n......... (So that's it. No more time to think.)\nJoan:\nPerhaps you'd like to betake yourselves to bidding us farewell now? I must prepare supper for Mr Garrideb.\nRyunosuke:\nOh, oh yes... I'm so sorry.\nSusato:\nThank you both very much for your time.\nRyunosuke:\n(Soseki-san will be waiting for us. And I'm going to have to give him an answer...)\nMove to any other location except Mr Natsume's Room:\n19th February\nBriar Road\nSusato:\nIt's time, Mr Naruhodo. We must hurry back to the prison!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I know. Let's hail a carr- ......... Oh.\nSusato:\nWhat's the matter?\nRyunosuke:\nIt looks like something's going on over there in front of the Garridebs' house.\nSusato:\n...?\n???:\nI know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers!\n???:\nWho are you calling an old man...you rum-lookin' niminy-piminy?!\n???:\n'There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,\nThan are dreamt of in your philosophy.'\n???:\nWho's this Horatio fella, eh? What are you on about?\nSusato:\nExcuse me...\n???:\nEh? What the...? Who are you now?\nSusato:\nI'm sorry, it just looked as though there might be some problem here. And my associate here, Mr Ryunosuke Naruhodo, is a lawyer, you see.\n???:\nEh? A lawyer? ...What?\nRyunosuke:\nIf I can be of any assistance, I'd be happy to help. I'm from Japan, but I have studied English law.\n???:\nTsk! Fine! I'll be on me way for today. But you mark my words! This ain't over yet!\n???:\nGet thee to a nunnery!\n???:\nDo I look like a bloomin' nun to you?!\nSusato:\nI do hope you're not injured?\n???:\nO, fair Eastern maiden, thou art so gentle! Thank you!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat was that all about?\n???:\n'There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio,\nThan are dreamt of in your philosophy.'\nRyunosuke:\nErm...I'm not Horatio, either.\nSusato:\nForgive the enquiry, sir, but... ...are you a lodger here? In the Garrideb residence?\n???:\nO, fair Eastern maiden, thou art so right! Yes, I do dwell in this humble abode.\nRyunosuke:\n(Mr Garrideb mentioned that he had another lodger, didn't he? This must be the man.) Do you happen to know the other lodger, who lives on the first floor?\n???:\nAh, yes. A gentleman named Natsume? O, more worthy a polemist in my battle of words ne'er could there be!\nRyunosuke:\nSorry? Battle, did you say?\n???:\nWho is the stronger, Hamlet or Macbeth? Mr Natsume and I sparred long into the night!\nRyunosuke:\n...I see.\nSusato:\nI, I don't fully understand, but it seems Mr Natsume and this gentleman are acquaintances at least.\n???:\nSo, fair maiden! So good gentleman... ...I can tarry here no longer! Fare thee well!\nSusato:\nI didn't really understand him, but I think he's returned to his room.\nRyunosuke:\nIt seems he's unaware of what's happened to Mr Natsume, so he can't really help us. (With Soseki-san and that man as lodgers, the Garrideb house is certainly full of eccentrics.) Anyway, I'll go and find a carriage.\nSusato:\nYes. I'm sure Mr Natsume is eagerly awaiting our return!\nRyunosuke:\n(Let's hope we can get to the prison before visiting hours are over.)\n19th February, 6:31 p.m.\nLocal Prison, Cell 9\nSoseki:\n......... Oh! It's you! You're here! You came! Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAME BACK! I'M SO TOUCHED!\nSusato:\nWe are so sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr Natsume.\nSoseki:\nOh! No! Th-Think nothing of it! R-R-R-Relax! If, if I were a cat, I would purr with pleasure at the company of such fine compatriots.\nNoble, Nurturing, Never-Failing Nipponese!\nRyunosuke:\nOh now, let's not get carried away.\n???:\nOh, I quite agree. There is nothing more reassuring than the familiarity of one's native land. On the other hand...\nSholmes:\n...it is through friendship transcending international borders that one truly appreciates the fact. Such is my belief, at least.\nSoseki:\nAh! Oh! It's... Yes! Agh! It's... It's YOU! THE MISERABLE, ROTTEN SPY! HERR LOCK SHOLMES!!!\nRyunosuke:\nMr Sholmes! What are you doing here?\nSholmes:\nI have no intention of 'doing' anything per se. Save observing, of course.\nSusato:\nWhatever do you mean, Mr Sholmes?\nSholmes:\nWell, having encountered some curious reading material in that gloomful room... ...and having unmasked the secret identity of that eccentric pair... ...I decided I should drop in on my way home. To see how our divested friend is faring.\nSoseki:\nGloomful room?\nSholmes:\nAt least your accommodation here offers a window, my dear fellow. In that sense, it is the superior option. Anyway, I must commend you on your taste in books. My day has been a delight, and cost me not a penny.\nSoseki:\nAAARGH!!! YOUUU!!! HOW DARE YOU, HERR LOCK SHOLMES!!! ......... .........Ugh. I've had it. I'm through. I'm at the end of my rope. I should never have come to Great Britain. It was a terrible mistake. Haunted by spirits in those accursed lodgings... No doubt my luck will be cursed in tomorrow's trial as well... MY WHOLE LIFE IS BEDAMNED!\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nSusato:\nWhat are you thinking, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\n...He mentioned that once before, didn't he? That his lodgings were cursed, I mean.\nSholmes:\nAnd there is much truth in Mr Moustache's words.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nSholmes:\n'Cursed' is a wholly appropriate description, I would say. For the man's lodgings...and indeed for tomorrow's trial.\nRyunosuke:\n(...What's that supposed to mean?)\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nSholmes:\nWell, my dear fellows, it is time we were leaving, I believe.\nSusato:\nAlready?!\nSholmes:\nVisiting hours are over. The guard will be here shortly to escort us out. There is a restaurant near here that serves excellent trout. Would you care to join me?\nSoseki:\n...!\nSusato:\nOh dear. There is never enough time, is there?\nSoseki:\n......... .........\nRyunosuke:\nErm...Mr Natsume... ...if you'd like, in the trial tomorrow... ...I'd be happy to represent you.\nSusato:\n...!\nSoseki:\nL...L... Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire...\nRyunosuke:\n......... As I said, I only experienced a British courtroom for the first time yesterday. And although the man I was representing was found not guilty, I lost sight of something crucial.\nSoseki:\nSomething crucial?\nRyunosuke:\nWhat to believe in: the defendant, justice or the truth. How to believe, even. But...I think I've finally worked it out. I've decided I must believe in myself above all else. To trust my instincts.\nSusato:\nYes, Mr Naruhodo!\nRyunosuke:\nAnd my instincts are telling me that you, Mr Natsume, are innocent of this crime. And it's imperative that we prove that in court.\nSoseki:\nLocum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire...\nRyunosuke:\nI will fight for your innocence until the bitter end, with every weapon available to me. So I hope you'll permit me...to represent you tomorrow.\nSoseki:\n......... As I said when we first met... ...I'd like to entrust my fate to someone who will listen to me...in my native tongue.\nRyunosuke:\nOf course, Mr Natsume.\nSholmes:\nIt would be fair to say, Mr Naruhodo... ...that your mind was, in many ways, made up from the outset. You merely needed the events of today to fully realise it.\nRyunosuke:\nYes... I think you're right about that. (It's been a roundabout journey, but I got there in the end.) Miss Susato...\nSusato:\nYes?\nRyunosuke:\nWould you be willing to stand by my side tomorrow and help me in court?\nSusato:\n......... Absolutely! As I said this morning... ...you may consider me your personal judicial assistant!\nRyunosuke:\n(The shocking events of yesterday's trial still weigh heavily on my mind. But it's time to stop looking backwards. Kazuma believed in me. And Mr Sholmes believes in me now, too. So it's time... Time that I learnt to believe in myself. Soseki-san has no one. He's all alone. So it's my job to help him. To fight his corner. Tomorrow. In the courtroom. With all the strength I can muster!)\nTo be continued...",

Who'd have thought we'd be back here again so soon?)Susato:\nWe are on a study tour of Great Britain...with the intention of learning the country's legal practices. In order to research the latest court procedures here, we need as much court experience as possible.Ryunosuke:\nWell, yes, I suppose that's true, but... ...for the person in the dock, it may well be his or her one and only time in court. And it could be life-changing. In which case, treating it  as 'research' may seem a little... crass.Susato:\n...Oh, when you put it like that... You're quite right.Good morning!Ryunosuke:\nAh, Mr Natsume. Good morning.Susato:\nOh dear, are you alright? Your eyes are terribly bloodshot.Soseki:\n'The early bird catches the worm,' as they say here in Britain.Ryunosuke:\nYes, I've heard that expression.Soseki:\nBut I really don't want to catch a worm. SO I TRIED DESPERATELY NOT TO WAKE UP EARLY! BUT I WAS SO WORRIED, I COULDN'T CATCH A WINK! ...And now I'm absolutely exhausted as a result.Ryunosuke:\n(...Do all literary people take things so...literally?)Susato:\nThank you for putting your faith in us today, Mr Natsume.Soseki:\n......... I, I WISH I HAD NINE LIVES! MY WHOLE FUTURE HANGS IN THE BALANCE! I'M...Too Terrified To Tremble!Ryunosuke:\n(Really? Because I can feel tremors in the floor.)Soseki:\nI can't do this! I can't take it! Although...Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire...Ryunosuke:\nUm...yes?Soseki:\nI caught a glimpse of the public gallery as I walked by the courtroom. It looked like the opening night of the opera, there were so many people. I had no idea my case was such a notorious affair here in London.Ryunosuke:\nOh. Um... (Neither did I.) Do you know why that might be, Miss Susato?Susato:\nI'm sorry, Mr Naruhodo, but I have no idea.Ryunosuke:\n(So that all-knowing look on your face is just coincidence then, is it?)Soseki:\nDON'T HIDE THE TRUTH FROM ME! ...It's...it's... ...it's because of the Reaper, isn't it?Ryunosuke:\n...! (Lord van Zieks?!) Is, is that right, Miss Susato?Susato:\n...I purchased as many different newspapers as I could find this morning, and yes... ...Lord van Zieks is on the front page of every one.Ryunosuke:\nI, I knew it!Susato:\nSometime after the prosecutor was dubbed 'The Reaper of the Bailey'... ...he stopped appearing in court, it seems. It's been several years now, in fact, until the day before yesterday.Ryunosuke:\nYes, Inspector Gregson told us something similar, didn't he?The trial two days ago marked Lord van Zieks's return to the courtroom after a very long hiatus. (The trial of Magnus McGilded... Ugh, what a harrowing experience that was.)Susato:\nI believe that appearance made even greater waves here in the capital than today's.Ryunosuke:\nBut we wouldn't have realised, of course, having only just arrived in the country.Susato:\n'Why is the Reaper back in the Bailey so soon, for what appears to be a mundane murder?' That's the question the papers are asking. And they are all speculating various answers.Soseki:\n'Mundane'? MUNDANE?! It's the most significant saga of the century to some of us!Susato:\nOh dear! I meant no offence, Mr Natsume! But...that is how the papers are describing it.Soseki:\nWell, lest we also forget the fact that it could spark an international incident. Obviously, the reappearance of this infamous prosecutor has caught people's attention. But there's another blatant similarity with the trial of two days ago.Susato:\nYes, I agree.Soseki:\nLocum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire... It's you!Ryunosuke:\nMe...? (Well, I suppose that's true.)Soseki:\nBoth times, it is you who stands against this legendary prosecutor. It, it can only mean...THAT YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH THE REAPER!Ryunosuke:\nPlease! I don't rub shoulders with...with...death-bringers!Susato:\nI'm afraid that there's really only one other explanation. It can only be another example, Mr Naruhodo, of your uncommon bad luck.Ryunosuke:\n(...Thanks for that.)Soseki:\nOh, this is just my luck! Why must I be represented by a man with such frail fortune? By the LEAST LUCKY LAWYER ALIVE!Ryunosuke:\n......... Well, let's not forget... ...that it was you, Mr Natsume, who asked me to represent you.Soseki:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nYes, it's true that I'm just a student, new to London, with little in the way of experience or skills...or luck. But I promise you this... ...I will fight your corner until the bitter end. And I will believe in you, Mr Natsume.Soseki:\nOh, benevolent Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire...Susato:\nYou're not alone here with us, Mr Natsume. Whatever happens, we will always be on your side!Soseki:\nOh, benevolent Non-Locum Assistant Miss Mikotoba Esquiress... ......... I AM IN YOUR DEBT! FOREVER! I shall never forget this great kindness for as long as I live!Bailiff:\nMr Natsume! Counsel for the Defence! The court session is about to begin. Kindly make your way into the courtroom at once!Ryunosuke:\nAlright then, Mr Natsume, it's time. Let's go.Soseki:\nY-Y-Ye... Y-Y-Ye... YEEESSSSSS!!!Ryunosuke:(This is it... My second appearance in a British courtroom. And my second trial against...the Reaper. I hope you're watching over me, Kazuma. Because this time, I won't let my faith waver. I'll believe in my client to the last. Just like you believed in me... ...I believe I can do this now! I'm ready for this fight!)20th February, 10:00 a.m.\nThe Old Bailey CourtroomJudge:\nIn the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution is fully prepared, My Lord.Ryunosuke:\nThe defence...is ready, My Lord!Van Zieks:\n......... The Nipponese are a truly fascinating breed.Ryunosuke:\nSorry, what?Van Zieks:\nLord Stronghart has told me all about you. That you are a student who arrived in London but two days ago. A mere amateur.Ryunosuke:\nDo, do you have a point?!Van Zieks:\nBeing a compatriot, you feel compelled to try to help the accused, I suppose. ...Typical Nipponese arrogance.Susato:\n...Forgive me, but I do not believe arrogance is an appropriate description.Ryunosuke:\n(Susato-san...)Susato:\nAfter all, at our previous encounter, the defendant was found to be innocent.Van Zieks:\n...Very true. And a most fascinating - if dark - trial it was, too. The tragic conclusion came later, of course. Here's to the acquitted, and his unfortunate violent end.Ryunosuke:\n...!Judge:\nThank you, Counsels. I see both sides are in fine fettle. Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...are you ready to carry out your duties here in court as impartial members of the public?Juror No. 1:\nYou never know when you might be down on your luck. But I believe in fair play for everyone.Juror No. 2:\nWell I must warn you, I'm rather more ruthless than I appear.Juror No. 3:\nOh well, not me. What you see is what you get. I'm a peace-loving fellow.Juror No. 4:\nI'm afraid to say, I think it's quite possible that moustached foreigner did the deed.Juror No. 5:\nCome on, what are we waiting for? No doubt he did it, anyway.Juror No. 6:\nEh? Sorry? Didn't quite catch that.Judge:\nVery well, let us proceed. Your opening statement, if you please, Lord van Zieks.Van Zieks:\nVery recently, Great Britain signed an alliance with a rising power in the Far East. The accused in the dock today is a student from that same land. A certain Mr Soseki Natsume. And while our country has extended this foreign student the warmest of welcomes... ...regrettably the kindness has not been returned. In fact, this student is accused of a most sinister act. Of plunging a knife into the back of an innocent woman who was doing nothing but walking down the street!Juror No. 1:\nA knife crime?! I tell you from bitter experience, those are the worst! Bloody oath, they are!Juror No. 2:\nJust look at that sallow complexion and short stature... He's, he's one of those dreadful 'Japanese'!Juror No. 5:\nCome on, let's get this over with. With me now, everyone. One, two...three!Juror No. 6:\nEh? Sorry? Didn't quite catch that.Van Zieks:\nPray...forgive the discourtesy of smashing my hallowed chalice here in this great chamber. Allow me to call the first witness to the stand.Judge:\nVery well. Bailiff, lead the inspector in, please!Van Zieks:\nYour name and occupation, please.Gregson:\nYes, sir. Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard.Van Zieks:\nWould you please summarise the events of the case for the court, Inspector?Gregson:\nThe victim is thought to be a young woman in her twenties by the name of Olive Green.Judge:\nI beg your pardon, Inspector? 'Thought to be'?Gregson:\nYes, havin' been stabbed in the back by her attacker's knife, the victim fell unconscious. That was three days ago now. And she's been comatose ever since.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?! (So they don't even know who she is for sure?)Judge:\nHm, comatose... I see. But her life is not in danger?Van Zieks:\nFortunately for the Eastern student, the charge will not be murder. Pray, elaborate on the details, Inspector.Gregson:\nSir. If I could ask everyone to look at this street map... As I mentioned, the incident took place three days ago. ...At around five in the afternoon. It happened on the pavement running alongside Briar Road, a wide thoroughfare for horse-drawn vehicles. It had not long since stopped snowin' as the victim - Miss Green - was walkin' down the street. Out of the blue, she was approached from behind by the accused and stabbed in the back. Luckily, the young lady's life was spared, and she's currently bein' treated in one of the city's hospitals. But bein' unconscious as she is, we've been unable to take a statement from her, of course. This is the case file with everything we know about the victim so far.Judge:\nThank you, Inspector. The court will accept the documents as evidence, if you please.The case file has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks:\nWhat of the weapon that was used?Gregson:\nSir. I have that here. It was removed from the victim's back.Ryunosuke:\n(Ouch. That big thing is starting to make me scared to walk down the street now...)Susato:\nWith a heavy blade like that, almost anybody would have been able to stab the poor woman.Ryunosuke:\n(Even the scragged-looking Soseki-san, I suppose...)Judge:\nHm... A common-or-garden jackknife, I would say. Rather nondescript. Thank you, Inspector. The court accepts the blade as evidence.The jackknife has been entered into the Court Record.Judge:\nNow then...what do we know of the motive? Money or valuables, I presume?Examine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJackknife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlade, then tip of blade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSusato:\nOh, look here, Mr Naruhodo, just at the tip... A small piece of the blade appears to be missing.\nRyunosuke:\nYou're right! Well spotted, Miss Susato!\nSusato:\nI wonder what could have happened to it.\nRyunosuke:\nYes. ...You, you don't think... ...it could still be lodged in the victim, do you?\nSusato:\nOh dear! I do hope not. That sounds terribly painful.Gregson:\nFrom what we can tell by looking at the woman's possessions, it seems like she's a poor student herself. Hard to imagine she would have had anythin' much worth pinchin', My Lord.Judge:\nI see. Well, in that case, are we looking at some deep-seated resentment toward the victim?Gregson:\n...I'm afraid I couldn't say. Apart from visitin' secondhand bookshops, the defendant, Mr Natsume, doesn't appear to get out much. At this moment in time, we haven't been able to establish any sort of connection between him and the victim.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nIf theft and grievance had been ruled out as the motive... ...what reason could Mr Natsume possibly have had for stabbing the young woman? Yet you arrested the man in spite of that...in a totally unjustified and heavy-handed way!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\n...Pray forgive the discourtesy of flinging a freshly uncorked bottle into the public gallery... ...but your words have soured its hallowed bouquet. For it is you, my learned friend, who is being heavy-handed here.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?!Van Zieks:\nScotland Yard does not arrest people without good cause. That should be beyond question. Inspector Gregson, the prosecution calls for your formal testimony. Explain to the court precisely why the constabulary came to arrest the Nipponese student.Gregson:\nYes, sir!Witness Testimony\n- Mr Natsume's Arrest -Gregson:\nAs I said, it was five o'clock in the afternoon when the incident occurred. And there was an unusually light fog.\nVisibility was reasonably good, and there was no one else about but the victim and the accused.\nOut of the blue, the victim was stabbed from behind and subsequently collapsed on the pavement.\nThe accused ran off, scatterin' his belongings all over the floor.\nThose bein' a number of old books he'd just bought. He was on his way home from a bookshop, it seems.\nIt was just a matter of workin' out who the books belonged to, and we found the bloke to arrest him.Judge:\nOld books, you say?Gregson:\nYes, My Lord. I have a photograph here of the scene of the crime, taken immediately after the incident.Judge:\nAh yes, I can clearly see the books to which you are referring. I will take that photographic print as evidence, please, Inspector.The crime scene photograph has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks:\nYou Nipponese are a spineless breed. Too cowardly to admit defeat. Denying everything despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.Ryunosuke:\nWell...I...Susato:\nForgive me, Lord van Zieks, but the defendant is not denying 'everything', as you put it.Ryunosuke:\nWhat are you doing, Miss Susato?Judge:\nDo go on...Susato:\nMr Natsume has admitted to playing some part in the incident. Isn't that right, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke:\n(Well, now you mention it... ...when we visited him in the prison yesterday, he did tell us what had all happened.)Soseki:\nAs I was walking along that accursed pavement, I could make out the sole silhouette of another ahead of me. A woman, wearing a green overcoat, she was. And just as I went to overtake her... ...she suddenly let out a little scream, and collapsed onto the cold, hard slabs of stone at my feet! I was terrified! I had to get away from there! So I ran! As fast as my legs would carry me back to my accursed lodgings!Juror No. 1:\nHmph, a green overcoat?Juror No. 3:\nWell that's exactly what the woman in that print is wearing!Juror No. 4:\nOh my! A photographic print in full colour! What will the world come up with next?Ryunosuke:\nThe defendant has done nothing more than admit he fled the scene of a terrifying incident! That does NOT mean that he's guilty of the heinous crime of stabbing the woman in the back!Van Zieks:\nThere was nobody else there at the time. Just the two of them: the victim...and the accused. In other words, there is nobody else who could possibly have stabbed the woman. A fact...that the accused concedes!Ryunosuke:\nUgh...Judge:\nHm, it seems this cross-examination could prove to be pivotal, Counsel. Proceed, please.Ryunosuke:\nYes, My Lord! (Nothing for it... I have to use this cross-examination to turn the tables here. It's our only chance!)Cross-Examination\n- Mr Natsume's Arrest -",

And there was an unusually light fog.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nA light fog, you say?\nGregson:\nWell, light for London. You could see the opposite side of the street for once. Not much farther, though.\nRyunosuke:\n...That's light, is it?\nGregson:\nAround these parts, yes. Not something I'd expect a Japanese fellow like yourself to know, of course.\nRyunosuke:\nI've read that London is famous for its fog. But in my country, people usually imagine that gives the city a rather beautiful appearance.\nVan Zieks:\nTsk. How quaint.\nGregson:\nYes, well, it's not somethin' us Londoners tend to romanticise, as I expect you can appreciate.\nRyunosuke:\nI, I see...\nGregson:\nAt this time of year, the fog causes a large number of accidents, especially when it's heavy. Sometimes you can't even see your own hand at the end of your arm.\nJudge:\nIndeed. The other day, I was very nearly trampled by horses before I could see the carriage they were pulling.\nRyunosuke:\n(Ugh... Susato-san and I should definitely remember to stop, look and listen...)\nVan Zieks:\nHowever, on the day that concerns us, the fog was somewhat lighter than usual. A fact no doubt lamented by the accused.\nRyunosuke:\n...!Gregson:\nVisibility was reasonably good, and there was no one else about but the victim and the accused.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nHow are you able to state that with any certainly?\nVan Zieks:\nQuite simply, my learned friend. Because that is what the witnesses to this crime have told us.\nRyunosuke:\n(Ah yes, Inspector Gregson mentioned the witnesses yesterday, didn't he?)\nSusato:\nThat's right. One of them is a policeman, I believe. From Scotland Yard.\nGregson:\nThat is correct, ma'am.\nRyunosuke:\nThen we must hear their testimony!\nVan Zieks:\nThe prosecution will of course call them to the stand... should it be necessary.\nRyunosuke:\nBut, wait a minute! At five o'clock in the afternoon in the middle of winter... it would have been dark already! No matter how light the fog might have been, no one could have seen-\nVan Zieks:\nI'm unaware of the situation on your tiny island in the East... ...but here in the capital city of Great Britain...all main roads are illuminated in the night by gas streetlights.\nRyunosuke:\nAh!\nVan Zieks:\nThe prosecution believes there would have been ample light by which to witness the crime.\nJudge:\nQuite. Here in London, for the first time in history, mankind has completely conquered the darkness.\nRyunosuke:\n(Which means we really need to hear those witness statements. If I could just get through the fog of this cross-examination, maybe we'll be able to...)\nVan Zieks:\nIt seems the counsel for the defence is...taking stock. Continue with your testimony, Inspector.Gregson:\nOut of the blue, the victim was stabbed from behind and subsequently collapsed on the pavement.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\n'From behind', you say...?\nGregson:\nThat's right. As you can see from this print.\nJudge:\n...Yes, quite so, Inspector. The handle of the weapon is clearly protruding from the victim's back. And you say this poor woman - Miss Green - remains in a critical condition? Comatose, no less?\nGregson:\nI'm afraid so, My Lord, yes. She's bein' treated at Barts. I was hopeful that she'd come round before the trial started so I could take a statement, but it wasn't to be.\nJudge:\nYes, that is indeed a pity. It would have been most illuminating to hear the victim's own account of events.\nVan Zieks:\nLuck is on your client's side, it seems.\nRyunosuke:\n...! On the contrary! My client has been exceedingly UNlucky!\nVan Zieks:\n...Your force of tone is seriously undermined by those disturbingly wide eyes, I'm afraid.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...Gregson:\nThe accused ran off, scatterin' his belongings all over the floor.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nMr Natsume's belongings? Um...\nGregson:\nI think you'll find it's all there in the photographic print of the crime scene.\nJudge:\nYes, the three books on the floor.\nGregson:\nThat's right, My Lord. Secondhand books, they were. Irreparably damaged after fallin' in the snow, of course.\nVan Zieks:\nThe accused could easily have carried all three books in one hand. Which means... ...his other hand would have been free to wield a knife, for example.\nSusato:\nHe's very clever, isn't he?\nRyunosuke:\nWhat do you mean?\nSusato:\nHe's made it extremely hard for you to assert that Mr Natsume had his hands full with his books. He's managed to close the one avenue of escape we might have had before we even knew it was there.\nJudge:\nYou mean to say that the defendant was holding his belongings as he thrust the knife into the woman's back?\nGregson:\nThat must be what happened, My Lord, yes.Gregson:\nThose bein' a number of old books he'd just bought. He was on his way home from a bookshop, it seems.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe defendant apparently visits a secondhand bookshop on a daily basis.\nGregson:\nYes, so I understand. A shop full of old English literature.\nVan Zieks:\nI commend the accused on the lofty subject matter of his scholarly attention.\nGregson:\nThe bloke's room was stacked floor to ceilin' with those musty old books.\nRyunosuke:\nCan you tell us more about the bookshop in question, please, Inspector?\nGregson:\nWell, if I must. I'll have to ask you to look at the street map again, I'm afraid. The closest secondhand bookshop to the accused's lodgings is this place here. Bourbon Books. A little place on the corner of Briar Road and Meerschaum Street. As it happens, the accused is currently livin' in lodgings on the other side of Briar Road at the opposite end. Which means it doesn't take a genius to work out the route he would've taken home. Somethin' like this.\nThe local map's information has been updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nYes, I concur with your conclusion, Inspector. The defendant would certainly have passed the scene of the crime on his way home from that particular shop.\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo... ...I think that what the inspector just told us could turn out to be of vital importance.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I agree. (The most important point that the inspector just made being...)\n\n\n\nThe bookshop's location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe crucial detail in what you've just told the court, Inspector, is the location of the bookshop.\nGregson:\nI couldn't agree more.\nRyunosuke:\nSo...where is it exactly?\nGregson:\n......... Eh? Are you windin' me up, sunshine?! I just explained that! I got the map out and everythin'! Used red bloomin' ink! And drew the bloke's route home on for you!\nJudge:\nAnd I distinctly remember seeing you nod along, Counsel.\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Yes...yes, of course! (I must have been so nervous, I didn't take it in...)\nVan Zieks:\nThe blunder of the day goes to you, my learned friend.\nRyunosuke:\nNo no, not yet! The trial's only just begun after all!\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo... ...I would strongly advise you to look carefully through the Court Record at this stage.\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes, miss. At once, miss. Sorry I made a mistake, miss.)\nVan Zieks:\nInspector, continue with your testimony, please.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nThe bookshop's name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nInspector Gregson, may I ask you a favour?\nGregson:\n...What?\nRyunosuke:\nWould you kindly add the name of the bookshop to your formal testimony, please? I believe it may be of vital importance.\nGregson:\n'May be'?\nRyunosuke:\nOh, well, you know... I mean, yes! It could be a very important clue!\nJudge:\nVery well. Not that I can see it being of any great significance... ...but please revise your testimony accordingly, Inspector.\nGregson:\nYes sir, My Lord. Whatever you say.\nRyunosuke:\n(Could the man BE any more sardonic?)\nChanges statement from \"Those bein' a number of old books he'd just bought. He was on his way home from a bookshop, it seems. to \"He was on his way home from Bourbon Books, a secondhand bookshop he apparently patronises.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe bookshop's stock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nI often think, Inspector... ...that what really makes for a good bookshop is the quality of the books that they stock!\nGregson:\n......... Yes, I think I'd agree with that.\nRyunosuke:\nFor example! You go to a shop and buy a serialised set of novels... ...but when you return home, you find to your horror... that the third volume is missing!\nGregson:\n...Doesn't bear thinkin' about. Just the sort of thing that really gets my goat.\nRyunosuke:\nExactly! THAT is the point I was trying to make!\nVan Zieks:\nWell, now that you two have found common ground in that fascinating scenario... ...perhaps we might continue with the cross-examination? If you're quite finished, my learned Nipponese friend?\nRyunosuke:\nYes! ......... (...Wait, what just happened?)\nSusato:\nWhat just happened, Mr Naruhodo, was that you allowed yourself to be sidetracked. I would strongly advise you to look carefully through the Court Record at this stage.\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes, miss. At once, miss. Sorry I made a mistake, miss.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe defendant apparently visits a secondhand bookshop on a daily basis.\nGregson:\nYes, so I understand.

Not that I can see it being of any great significance... ...but please revise your testimony accordingly, Inspector.\nGregson:\nYes sir, My Lord. Whatever you say.\nRyunosuke:\n(Could the man BE any more sardonic?)\nChanges statement from \"Those bein' a number of old books he'd just bought. He was on his way home from a bookshop, it seems. to \"He was on his way home from Bourbon Books, a secondhand bookshop he apparently patronises.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe bookshop's stock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nI often think, Inspector... ...that what really makes for a good bookshop is the quality of the books that they stock!\nGregson:\n......... Yes, I think I'd agree with that.\nRyunosuke:\nFor example! You go to a shop and buy a serialised set of novels... ...but when you return home, you find to your horror... that the third volume is missing!\nGregson:\n...Doesn't bear thinkin' about. Just the sort of thing that really gets my goat.\nRyunosuke:\nExactly! THAT is the point I was trying to make!\nVan Zieks:\nWell, now that you two have found common ground in that fascinating scenario... ...perhaps we might continue with the cross-examination? If you're quite finished, my learned Nipponese friend?\nRyunosuke:\nYes! ......... (...Wait, what just happened?)\nSusato:\nWhat just happened, Mr Naruhodo, was that you allowed yourself to be sidetracked. I would strongly advise you to look carefully through the Court Record at this stage.\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes, miss. At once, miss. Sorry I made a mistake, miss.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationGregson:\nHe was on his way home from Bourbon Books, a secondhand bookshop he apparently patronises.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nHm, so the shop is called Bourbon Books, is it?\nGregson:\nThat's right. That's the closest secondhand bookshop to the accused's lodgings. And to get from there back to his room... ...he would have gone right past the very spot where the incident took place.\nRyunosuke:\nIf...if I could just confirm one point... Can we be sure that the defendant really did visit Bourbon Books on the day in question?\nGregson:\n......... Well, we haven't actually confirmed it, no.\nJudge:\nYou haven't confirmed it? Why the devil not, Inspector?\nGregson:\nWell, um, the thing is... ...the shopkeeper's gone on a trip, you see. Left the mornin' after the incident. To collect more stock, I'm told. So we, um, haven't been able to ask the bloke if the accused visited his shop on the day in question or not.\nRyunosuke:\nWell in that case, what did the defendant himself have to say about it?\nVan Zieks:\n...No recollection.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?!\nVan Zieks:\nAccording to the statement he made at the time, the accused has no recollection of where he'd been.\nRyunosuke:\n...Of course he doesn't.\nGregson:\nThe bloke clearly has his head in the clouds whenever he's walkin' about town. He claims he just wanders into whatever bookshop he happens to be passin', and rarely notices the name.\nJudge:\nHmmm... I should say the man ought to learn to look where he's going, at the very least.\nRyunosuke:\n......... (So... ...it's just as I thought, then.)\nSusato:\nIs something the matter?\nVan Zieks:\nInspector, you may continue with your testimony.Present Secondhand Book Receipt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Um...if, if I could just stop you there, Inspector Gregson...\"Gregson:\nIt was just a matter of workin' out who the books belonged to, and we found the bloke to arrest him.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou asked for the help of the famous detective, Herlock Sholmes, to locate the defendant, I believe.\nGregson:\n......... Stuff and nonsense.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nGregson:\nThat Jack-in-office...that busybody...just comes and sticks his oar in whether we ask him or not!\nRyunosuke:\nBut, but according to what I have here... ...Mr Sholmes was shown to the scene by Scotland Yard detectives.\nGregson:\nWell that was nothin' to do with me! The lads at the scene must've done it! Without my permission!\nRyunosuke:\nAgh!\nGregson:\nI tell 'em time and again! Whenever somethin' happens, send word to headquarters! Then follow your bloomin' instructions!\nRyunosuke:\n...I see.\nGregson:\nIf that meddler gets his hands on any details, we'll all be readin' it in Randst Magazine next month! And you can bet your last farthin' that I'll be in there, too, stripped of all my hard work on the case! 'Yes, Mr Sholmes, no, Mr Sholmes', 'Aren't you clever, Mr Sholmes'! That's all the thanks I'll be gettin'!\nVan Zieks:\n...Inspector. If the man is proving detrimental to the Yard's activities... ...perhaps I should step in and...deal with him?\nGregson:\nArgh!!! .........\nSusato:\nIt appears Inspector Gregson is lost for words.\nRyunosuke:\nYes. The Reaper's words carry a lot of weight, obviously.\nGregson:\nAnyway, the point is this! That little Japanese bloke's already admitted it. He's admitted that those books all over the pavement at the scene were the ones he bought that day!\nJudge:\nHmmm...Susato:\nWhat do you think, Mr Naruhodo? If you're unable to sway the jury during this cross-examination, I'm afraid-Ryunosuke:\nThat Mr Natsume's fate will be sealed? Yes, they're sure to find him guilty. So one way or another... ...I have to expose an undeniable inconsistency in the inspector's testimony!Ryunosuke:\nUm...if, if I could just stop you there, Inspector Gregson...Gregson:\nWhat is it, sunshine? I'm a busy man, you know!Ryunosuke:\nThis is a receipt that we found in Mr Natsume's room. It was issued on the day of the incident, and details the purchase of three secondhand books.Gregson:\nAnd you found that in the accused's room, did you?Ryunosuke:\nYes, but the point is not where the receipt was found, but the name of the shop printed on it.Van Zieks:\n...Go on.Ryunosuke:\nThis receipt was issued from a bookshop called...Yore Books.Judge:\nYore Books? Y-o-r-e, I presume...Ryunosuke:\nYes, My Lord. So Mr Natsume did indeed purchase a number of books at a secondhand bookshop that day. However! The bookshop in question...was not Bourbon Books!Gregson:\nEh? What?Judge:\nInspector! Do you know of this other bookshop?Gregson:\nY-Yes sir! Yore Books is another secondhand bookshop not far from Bourbon Books. It's just that... Well, it's such a small place, I, I didn't think the accused would have known about it.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nBut in fact that IS the bookshop which the defendant visited on the day in question. And this receipt proves it!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nYes...for what difference it makes. Wherever the man purchased his musty tomes, it makes no difference in the final analysis.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nI disagree! I, I mean...after all, um...Susato:\nI have the street map here, if that might be of help?Ryunosuke:\nOh, um... Yes! Thank you! Have a look at this, please... If the defendant had been returning from Bourbon Books... ...then yes, he would almost certainly have passed the place where Miss Green was attacked. However! If we take into account the fact that he was actually at another bookshop - Yore Books... ...it may very well turn out that he wouldn't have passed that location at all!Juror No. 1:\n...! Could that be true?Juror No. 2:\nMy my, it rather depends on where this other bookshop is, but I do declare it may be a possibility...Juror No. 3:\nIs that right, Mr Lawyer, sir? What you just said?Ryunosuke:\nAbsolutely! It absolutely could be right!Judge:\nInspector Gregson! Where is this Yore Books establishment?Gregson:\nWell, um, obviously we looked into that. It turns out that Yore Books... ...is just here on the next corner of Meerschaum Street goin' east.The local map's information has been updated in the Court Record.Ryunosuke:\nAnd there you have it! As you can clearly see now... ......... ...Oh.Van Zieks:\n...My learned Nipponese friend is obviously in training to be a clown, the way he regales us with such witticisms. To your future career in the circus.Susato:\nGrrr...you put that glass down now, or I'll put it down for you!Gregson:\nI, erm...didn't think I needed to spell it out, but here we go. If the accused was comin' home from Yore Books instead of Bourbon Books... ...there's no doubt he still would have passed the place where the victim was stabbed.Judge:\nYes, thank you, Inspector.Ryunosuke:\nUgh...Van Zieks:\nAllow me to reiterate for my learned, if somewhat slow, Nipponese friend... Wherever the man purchased his musty tomes, it makes no difference in the final analysis.Ryunosuke:\nAAAAAAGH!!!Juror No. 4:\nAs I suspected! You can't fool me! And I don't suggest you try!Juror No. 5:\nWhat did I say, eh? I've had enough of this now!Juror No. 6:\nBeg your pardon? Terribly sorry, but would you mind repeating that?Susato:\nMr Naruhodo! We mustn't give up!Ryunosuke:\nWhat, what do you mean?Susato:\nIf the prosecution's assertion is correct... ...the members of the jury may very well decide that Mr Natsume is guilty!Ryunosuke:\nAh! (She's absolutely right!)Susato:\nWe must think! We must consider the assertion just put forward by the prosecution very, very carefully!Ryunosuke:\n(They claim Soseki-san must have passed the location of the incident on his way home from Yore Books, but...)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe assertion just made by the prosecution...is fundamentally flawed!\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nLeads to:\n\"Explain yourself, Counsel!\"Leave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n......... (I think I'd better leave it alone for now.)\nJudge:\nVery well, if the defence has no rebuttal here...\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo, as I said before... ...we can't give up here. We must fight back!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I realise that. But sometimes the best way to fight is to do nothing, you know.\nSusato:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n...You're right! What am I talking about? Doing nothing won't get us anywhere! (It wasn't sitting right with me anyway...) \nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe assertion just made by the prosecution...is fundamentally flawed!\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nFirst we must deal with the inexcusable tardiness of your objection!\nRyunosuke:\nWah!\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo, remember! It's time to fight back!\nRyunosuke:\n(Ugh, I don't know what's worse, the court penalty, or Susato-san's piercing stare...)\nLeads to:\n\"Explain yourself, Counsel!\"Judge:\nExplain yourself, Counsel!Ryunosuke:\nErm, yes, My Lord! You, you can see what I mean on this map! When returning from Yore Books to his lodgings... ...Mr Natsume could have followed the route suggested by the prosecution. However... ...that isn't the only conceivable route to take between the two places. If the defendant used these streets...look what happens! He arrives back at his lodgings without passing the location where the victim was attacked!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nTalking back to a clown is a fool's errand, of course. However, I feel compelled to point out that... ...that route is what is commonly referred to as the long way round.Ryunosuke:\nAh.Van Zieks:\nOn a cold winter's night, why would any man choose to take a longer route home?Ryunosuke:\nWell, um...erm...Van Zieks:\nThe answer is extremely simple: He wouldn't. In other words... ...the accused took the obvious route back to his lodgings, and is the obvious perpetrator of this crime!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nBut...but...BUT! Ah-ha, yes! I've got it! Obviously, we must ask the man himself! Ask Mr Natsume which route he took home!Van Zieks:\nI have already informed the court of the accused's response to such questioning. He claims he has 'no recollection'.Ryunosuke:\nHaah...Gregson:\nThat's right. As I said, the bloke seems to spend his time outside wanderin' aimlessly from A to B. That day was no exception. He says he doesn't remember where he was or which route he took home.Ryunosuke:\n......... I don't... I DON'T BELIEVE THIIIS!!!Van Zieks:\n...I thank you, my learned friend. And suggest that we do not waste any more of the court's time by wandering aimlessly around this subject. Pray, what say you insightful jurors?Ryunosuke:\nBut, but even if that is the case, the defence still-???:Juror No. 1:\nI agree with Lord van Zieks! Wholeheartedly, and in every way!Ryunosuke:\nWhat?! (I don't believe it! Does, does this mean...?)Juror No. 1:\nWe members of the jury...are completely convinced now!Judge:\nVery well, in that case I hereby call upon all members of the jury... ...to present your findings to the court!Juror No. 1:\nGuilty!Juror No. 2:\nGuilty!Juror No. 3:\nGuilty!Juror No. 4:\nGuilty!Juror No. 5:\nGuilty!Juror No. 6:\nGuilty!Judge:\nIt would appear the jury's leaning is unanimous.Ryunosuke:\n.........Van Zieks:\nTo the insightful members of the jury. I applaud your brave resolve. You serve Queen and country admirably.Susato:\nMr Naruhodo...Ryunosuke:\n......... (No...not yet... This isn't over yet! I still have one last chance to sway the opinion of the jury. I have to tip the balance of those scales the other way. I have to turn this around... ...somehow!)Van Zieks:\nHm, those are the eyes of quarry not yet willing to give up and die.Ryunosuke:\n.........Van Zieks:\nSo I presume you intend to wield your rights again in this trial. Rights of the defence written into antiquated British law that should have been buried long ago.Ryunosuke:\nCall it antiquated if you will... ...but it's the defence's prerogative to carry out a summation examination if it so chooses!Judge:\nVery well, Counsel... ...in accordance with the letter of the law, we shall proceed with a summation examination. Are the members of the jury ready, Mr Foreman?Juror No. 1:\nOf course we're ready! I'm all too familiar with that Nipponese whippersnapper and his onkus refusal to throw in his alley.Judge:\nVery well then. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have determined the defendant to be guilty!Judicial Findings\n- The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1:\nFor pity's sake, that little Nipponese oddity already admitted it himself, didn't he?Juror No. 2:\nIf he said that a woman in green collapsed before his eyes, why it can only have been the victim!Juror No. 3:\nThe man wouldn't have gone around the houses on his way back from the bookshop. Not in winter!Juror No. 4:\nSo the poor woman was attacked from behind, was she? How dreadful!Juror No. 5:\nI really don't care! Can't we just wrap this up now? I've got work to be doing!Juror No. 6:\nHm, Yore Books, yes... Nice shop, that. But Bourbon Books? ...Hmph, no, not worth a visit.Judge:\nHmmm... With only minor exceptions, the reasons for finding the defendant guilty are all too clear.Van Zieks:\nWhen the stabbing occurred, the only two people at the scene were the victim and the accused. And the accused himself... ...has admitted to seeing the victim in her green overcoat sink to the ground before his eyes.Judge:\nFurthermore, we have heard from the inspector that the defendant then fled the scene. I must say, I would have ample grounds to convict this man already.Susato:\nOh dear, even the judge appears convinced of Mr Natsume's guilt now.Ryunosuke:\nUgh, why did he have to run away like that? And how are we supposed to believe in some phantom attacker that nobody could see? This is impossible! How can I possibly make a case for the defence?Susato:\nMr Naruhodo! This is no time for grumbling! If we want to force the trial to continue-Ryunosuke:\nYes, I know. I have to turn the tide. I must make the jurors change their minds. Well, four of them, at least.Susato:\nExactly. We have no choice but to forge forward!Judge:\nYou have the floor, Counsel. Begin your summation examination.Ryunosuke:\nYes, My Lord. (I just need to keep this trial going somehow. Whatever it takes... Come on, Ryunosuke, you can do it!)Jury Examination\n- The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1:\nFor pity's sake, that little Nipponese oddity already admitted it himself, didn't he?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nUm, excuse me, but... ...aren't you...?\nJuror No. 1:\nYes, that's right. I was in the witness stand myself just two days ago.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I had a feeling I knew your face. ...Or the side of it, anyway. If I remember correctly, you're a banker, aren't you?\nJuror No. 1:\nThat's right. After the gold rush down under, I came back to London to work. And it was all going swimmingly until you started fossicking around! Bruce Fairplay was a man of repute!\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nJuror No. 1:\nDon't think I've forgotten how you treated me the other day! You had me and that young hatter pegged as criminals!\nRyunosuke:\nOh, well, you know... Water under the bridge!\nJuror No. 1:\nNow there's all sorts of rumours buzzing around. And the police have been badgering me nonstop.\nRyunosuke:\n...If, if I could turn back the clock...\nJuror No. 1:\nWell anyway, I don't know about the hatter, but at least I'm in the clear now. And free to make up my own mind about who's guilty and who isn't.\nRyunosuke:\nHaah... Thank goodness... (Alright, maaaybe I might struggle to change this man's mind, given our awkward history...)\nSusato:\nOh dear, I wonder what's become of Mr Furst now...Juror No. 2:\nIf he said that a woman in green collapsed before his eyes, why it can only have been the victim!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou're right that at the time of the incident... ...the defendant admits to having seen someone wearing a green overcoat walking ahead of him.\nJuror No. 2:\nWell quite! That's precisely my point. Clearly that 'someone wearing green' was the victim. And clearly that funny little Nipponese man with the disturbing moustache is the culprit!\nRyunosuke:\nBut let us not forget, madam! The defendant vehemently denies attacking the woman!\nJuror No. 2:\nWhy, of course he does! If he admits to stabbing her, his life is over. The man is obviously a liver-faced coward. Honestly! Claiming the woman simply collapsed before his eyes!\nRyunosuke:\nBut if that's a lie as you're suggesting, do you not think he would have concocted something more credible?\nJuror No. 2:\nOh, I really couldn't say. After all, you are...foreign. Who's to say what goes through your funny little minds.\nRyunosuke:\n(I could tell you what's going through my funny little mind right now, but you wouldn't like it...)\nJuror No. 2:\nI do declare the man has already made the admission. He himself has stated that there was nobody else around. Surely the conclusion is obvious? No one else could possibly have committed this awful crime!\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...\nJuror No. 2:\nIf no one else could have done it, the accused must be the man. Really, it couldn't be more simple!\nJudge:\nYour argument is compelling in its simplicity, I must admit.\nJuror No. 2:\nOh my! You are too kind, My Lord!\nRyunosuke:\n(That went well...for her.)Pit against Juror No. 6's statement (after Juror No. 6 changes his statement; before Jurors No. 3 and 5 vote innocent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThose two statements clearly show a flaw in the jurors' reasoning!\nJudge:\nA flaw? What are you talking about, Counsel?\nRyunosuke:\nWell, juror number two? Juror number six?\nJuror No. 2:\nMy, whatever do you mean, sir?\nJuror No. 6:\n.........\nSusato:\nI think perhaps the old man didn't hear you.\nRyunosuke:\nUnbelievable. It's not like I was loud or anything... There is at least one fact of which we can be sure here. The bookshop receipt found in the defendant's room clearly indicates that on the day of the attack... ...he had been to Yore Books and purchased a number of secondhand titles. He then returned home on foot.\nJuror No. 2:\nBut the man says he has no recollection of his return journey.\nRyunosuke:\nThat's correct. But what he does remember is seeing someone appear in front of him on the way. Someone in a green overcoat, who suddenly collapsed on the pavement before his eyes.\nJuror No. 2:\nYes, we are well aware of all this! The poor young woman who was stabbed, obviously.\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nCan we really be sure of that, madam?\nJuror No. 2:\nMy! Whatever do you mean?\nRyunosuke:\nI'm sure you heard juror number six's account of what happened to him that day? That same afternoon, there was somebody else apart from the victim... ...who was wearing a green overcoat and who fell over on the icy streets in the neighbourhood.\nJuror No. 2:\nOh my!\nJuror No. 1:\n...!\nJuror No. 3:\nMy goodness, you, you mean...?\nRyunosuke:\nThat's right. I'm referring of course... ...to hard-of-hearing juror number six!\nJuror No. 2:\nAre, are you really suggesting... ...that the person in the green overcoat whom the defendant saw collapse in front of his eyes... ...was the jolly old gentleman on the end of the bench here with me today?\nRyunosuke:\nThat is entirely possible, yes. After all, the old man... ...has a somewhat similar build to the victim.\nJuror No. 5:\nWell look at that!\nJuror No. 4:\nMy goodness me!\nJuror No. 6:\nHm? Sorry? You need a pee?\nRyunosuke:\nAnd crucially! We know precisely where the old man in the green overcoat fell!\nJuror No. 2:\nOn Calabash Road...\nRyunosuke:\nTherefore, if the person who Mr Natsume saw collapsing in front of him was in fact juror number six... ...it means the defendant must have taken the long route back to his lodgings. And if that's true, then clearly... ...the crime scene on Briar Road where the woman was stabbed...was not on his way home!\nJuror No. 2:\nOooh my!\nJuror No. 5:\nYou idiot, old man! If you hadn't been so daft as to be roaming about there, we'd have boxed this off hours ago!\nJuror No. 4:\nAnd really! What were you thinking, wearing such a befuddling coat?!\nJuror No. 6:\nWhat did you say to me?! Is it a crime for the elderly to walk the streets these days, hm? Is it a crime to slip over on the ice? Is it a crime to keep up with the latest styles and wear a beautiful, green overcoat, is it?!\n???:\n\nJuror No. 2:\nMy Lord, I do hope it won't cause any inconvenience, but...\nJudge:\nYou'd like to change your leaning, I presume?\nJuror No. 2:\nI do declare that I would. I should like to call for a verdict of not guilty.\nRyunosuke:\n...! Thank you!\nJuror No. 6:\nAnd I would too!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nJuror No. 6:\nIs it a crime to change your mind, is it? Well?!\nSusato:\nOh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! That was wonderful!\nRyunosuke:\nWell, we've managed to change a couple of minds at least. It's strengthened our position somewhat.\nSusato:\nYes! And it will prompt the other members of the jury to reconsider their stance as well. They'll be asking themselves if their current leanings are really right or not. Now, if only... If we could just identify one more clue or discrepancy that would make them stop doubting Mr Natsume... ...we might be able to tip the balance completely!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, that's exactly what we've got to do! (Van Zieks is looking to bring this trial to an early conclusion. That's what we have to prevent, by whatever means we have at our disposal!)\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nJudge:\nThank you, Counsel. On with the summation examination, please!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, My Lord.\nChanges Juror No. 2's statement to \"Why it could have been that old man in the green that the defendant saw.

Calabash Road or something?\nRyunosuke:\nPrecisely.\nJuror No. 3:\nBut it seems to me that what counts is whether the little Japanese fellow actually went that way or not.\nRyunosuke:\nWell...yes, that's true.\nJuror No. 3:\nAnd at the moment, there's no proof that shows he did, is there?\nRyunosuke:\nWell...yes, that's true as well.\nJuror No. 3:\nAnd as I understand it, the accused himself doesn't remember which way he went, does he?\nRyunosuke:\nWell...yes, that's annoyingly true.\nJuror No. 3:\nWinter nights are dark and cold, so the way I see it, you'd want to get home as quickly as possible.\nRyunosuke:\nWell...yes... Haah...why is all this true?\nJuror No. 3:\nSo really, the only thing that makes sense is that he went home along Briar Road.\nRyunosuke:\nAgh! (I'm supposed to be convincing you here!)\nJuror No. 3:\nI have given it a lot of thought, you know. I didn't just make up my mind on a whim that he did it. I mean, if there was some logical reason why he might have gone the Calabash Road way, it'd be different. I'd be happy to reconsider my position in that case. Honest, I would.\nRyunosuke:\n(Hm, a reason why Soseki-san might have taken the longer way home...)\nSusato:\nYes, a good reason... I don't imagine you'll be able to sway this young man's opinion without one.Pit against Juror No. 5's statement (after Juror No. 5 changes his statement; before Jurors No. 2 and 6 vote innocent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThose two statements are clearly at odds with one another!\nJudge:\nAt odds, Counsel? Explain yourself!\nJuror No. 3:\nPlease! Don't point! It wasn't me, I swear!\nJuror No. 5:\nEh? What? I, I just want to get this done and dusted!\nRyunosuke:\nWell, juror number three?\nJuror No. 3:\nOh! Me, sir? What, what do you mean?\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number five's words just now are extremely significant. Let's take a moment to consider the implications of what's been said on our map of the local area. On the day in question, Mr Natsume visited this bookshop to purchase a number of secondhand books. And on the same day... ...we now know that there were works being carried out on Meerschaum Street, making it impassable. Which means that the defendant's route home... ...could not have taken him along Meerschaum Street and down Briar Road.\nJuror No. 3:\nOh! Yes! Of course! What, what do you think, sir?\nJuror No. 5:\nWell! Yes, you can't argue with that really, can you? We must've had a good two yards or more of the pavement up. Every gentleman and gentlewoman that came along had to turn back and go the other way.\nRyunosuke:\nSo the only conclusion is this! The defendant must have taken the longer route back to his lodgings!\nJuror No. 3:\nYes, I suppose he must have.\nJuror No. 5:\nI, I suppose that must be right, eh?\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number three, you said the following: 'The man wouldn't have gone around the houses on his way back from the bookshop.' ...But! We see now...that he had no choice!\nJuror No. 3:\nYeees! ......... My Lord Mr Judge, sir, if I may...?\nJudge:\nYes?\nJuror No. 3:\nI, I don't think in all good conscience...that I can say the man's guilty now. ......... Yes, I'd like to see this trial continue so we can get to the bottom of what really happened. What about you, sir?\nJuror No. 5:\nEh? Who, me? Hm, well, alright then... If there's a hole in the prosecution's argument, it should be filled in, that's what I say.\nSusato:\nOh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! That was wonderful!\nRyunosuke:\nWell, we've managed to change a couple of minds at least. It's strengthened our position somewhat.\nSusato:\nYes! And it will prompt the other members of the jury to reconsider their stance as well. They'll be asking themselves if their current leanings are really right or not. Now, if only... If we could just identify one more clue or discrepancy that would make them stop doubting Mr Natsume... ...we might be able to tip the balance completely!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, that's exactly what we've got to do! (Van Zieks is looking to bring this trial to an early conclusion. That's what we have to prevent, by whatever means we have at our disposal!)\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nJudge:\nThank you, Counsel. On with the summation examination, please!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, My Lord.\nChanges Juror No. 3's statement to \"I have to say not guilty at this point...so I can see where this trial goes from here.\" and Juror No. 5's statement to \"Whether it's digging up roads or digging up the truth, you've got to see it through to the end, haven't you?\"Pit against Juror No. 5's statement (after Juror No. 5 changes his statement; after Jurors No. 2 and 6 vote innocent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThose two statements are clearly at odds with one another!\nJudge:\nAt odds, Counsel?

How dreadful!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nJuror No. 4:\nWhatever is the matter, young man?\nRyunosuke:\nYou're the wife of Mr Garrideb, aren't you? The landlord who rents Mr Natsume his room.\nJuror No. 4:\nThe master's wife?! Where do you get your ideas, sir? I'm the maid! The maid, you understand!\nRyunosuke:\n(She's keeping up that charade? ...Ugh, this is going to be awkward.) Erm, why didn't you mention this yesterday? That you'd been selected for the jury in this trial, I mean.\nJuror No. 4:\nWell, I was told not to mention it to anyone until the day of the trial, you see. It was in the letter I received. The instructions were very clear. So I'm afraid I had no choice.\nRyunosuke:\nI see. Anyway, Mr Natsume - the defendant - takes lodging in your...master's house, doesn't he?\nJuror No. 4:\nYes, that's right. Although he's only been in a little over a week now.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd in that time, surely you must have taken stock of his character. Does Mr Natsume look like the kind of man who would commit a crime such as this?!\nJuror No. 4:\nOh my goodness me, yes! He's just the sort.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nJuror No. 4:\nSpending all his time in that dark and dingy room, sporting that unscrupulous moustache... The man never speaks! And don't get me started on those shifty eyes! All the neighbours are talking about him. I've heard them, you know. People think he must be building a bomb in there or something.\nSusato:\nOh dear, poor Mr Natsume. How could people say such things about him? He's just a harmless bookworm, nothing more.\nRyunosuke:\n...Well, you just called him a worm, so... (Anyway, I'd better be careful about inviting this 'maid' to speak. She's said enough damning things already.)Juror No. 5:\nI really don't care! Can't we just wrap this up now? I've got work to be doing!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nA man's life is on the line here, sir! This will take as long as it takes!\nJuror No. 5:\nDon't get clever with me now, son! My life's on the line, too. And so is my family's.\nRyunosuke:\nAh.\nJuror No. 5:\nThe likes of you wouldn't understand, but a labourer like me can't afford to take time off. If I don't work, I don't eat! And neither do the wife and kids!\nRyunosuke:\nOh, I see. That...must be very hard.\nJuror No. 5:\nI go to the union every morning to find out what needs doing. If you're late and the work's taken, it's tough. This time of year, there's water and gas supply pipes bursting left, right and centre. They're after cheap labour to get the roads dug up to fix it. It's a hard slog from dawn till dusk, it is.\nRyunosuke:\nSo...you were out digging up the roads on the day of the incident as well, were you?\nJuror No. 5:\nThat's right. In fact, if I remember rightly... ...it was just round the corner from where it all happened. By that old bookshop, it was.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! (Another coincidence?)\nJuror No. 5:\nThat's right, Meerschaum Street, it was.\nRyunosuke:\nMeerschaum Street...?\nSusato:\nOn the map, Mr Naruhodo! There are only three named streets!\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number five! I need you to add that information to your formal statement, please.\nJuror No. 5:\nWhat's the point in that? Can't we just get this business over with now?\nRyunosuke:\nPlease, sir, it's important!\nJuror No. 5:\nTsk, fine, I'll do it then.\nChanges Juror No. 5's statement to \"On the day it happened, I was digging up Meerschaum Street from dawn till dusk!\"Juror No. 5:\nOn the day it happened, I was digging up Meerschaum Street from dawn till dusk!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo, if I understand correctly, you're a day labourer and you were doing road maintenance that day?\nJuror No. 5:\nThat's right. Like I said, you get a lot of burst gas and water pipes underground in the middle of winter. It's the only time of year fellows like me can actually make a few bob. And I'm missing out today!\nRyunosuke:\nAnd...when you say from dawn till dusk...?\nJuror No. 5:\nWell the work has to be completed within the day, see. No coaches or pedestrians can pass while it's happening.\nRyunosuke:\nI wonder if I could trouble you, sir... ...to mark on this street map the exact location of the works you were carrying out?\nJuror No. 5:\nGive it here, then. Let me have a look. Right, let's see then... Here we are, Meerschaum Street. Yes, it was just here, like. It was a tidy dig, I can tell you. We had to get through all the drifts of snow that had frozen solid.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd at what sort of time did you finish the work?\nJuror No. 5:\nWell, we started in the morning and we can't have finished before gone six, I'd say. The snow had stopped coming down, but it was long past dark for sure.\nSusato:\nThat means the road work was still going on when Miss Green was attacked at around five o'clock.\nRyunosuke:\n(Road works on Meerschaum Street, huh...)Pit against Juror No. 3's statement (before Jurors No. 2 and 6 vote innocent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThose two statements are clearly at odds with one another!\nJudge:\nAt odds, Counsel? Explain yourself!\nJuror No. 3:\nPlease! Don't point! It wasn't me, I swear!\nJuror No. 5:\nEh? What?

Nice shop, that. But Bourbon Books? ...Hmph, no, not worth a visit.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nJuror No. 6:\nHm? Sorry? 'Fold it,' you say? Fold what?\nRyunosuke:\n...Um, no no, what I said was 'Hold it!' What I wanted to ask was, do you visit Yore Books often?\nJuror No. 6:\nI like the old books they have in there, yes. I enjoy reading them over a nice cup of old tea. That's my daily routine, you see. Same thing every day. Including the day you're all talking about.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd at what time did you visit Yore Books on the day in question?\nJuror No. 6:\nWell, I was picking out books in there all afternoon, and it would have been just before five that I left. That's my daily routine, you see. Same thing every day. Including the day you're all talking about.\nRyunosuke:\nJust before five, you say? (Exactly when the victim was attacked!) Are you sure about the time?\nJuror No. 6:\nOh yes, no mistake there. I remember it well, I'm not about to forget that day in a hurry. Not after the dreadful time I had.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat do you mean?\nJuror No. 6:\nWell, I was walking down Calabash Road when I slipped on the ice and donked my head! It's always worse after the snow's stopped falling. That's when it's most slippery. Knocked myself clean out, I did. I really thought my number was up!\nRyunosuke:\nWait a minute! Let me get this straight. This happened...on Calabash Road?\nJuror No. 6:\nThat's right. I live in Cornpipe, you see. Heading down Calabash Road is the quickest way for me to get back from Yore Books.\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number six! I must insist... ...that you add that information to your formal statement! It may very well be extremely significant!\nJuror No. 6:\nHm? Sorry? 'Extremely sick'? No no, I'm quite alright now.\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nChanges Juror No. 6's statement to \"I slipped over that evening myself, on Calabash Road. I knocked myself clean out, you know!\"Juror No. 6:\nI slipped over that evening myself, on Calabash Road. I knocked myself clean out, you know!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nAnd that was at around five o'clock, you say? The same time as the victim was attacked.\nJuror No. 6:\nI don't know anything about the girl who was stabbed. But my dinner's on the table at the same time every day.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd for the record, could you please identify the precise location of your fall?\nJuror No. 6:\nGoodness, it was aeons ago now. I'm not sure I can remember.\nRyunosuke:\n...It was three days ago. Try dredging your memory. Please.\nJuror No. 6:\nHm, well, let me see... It was especially slippery around about... Ah yes! I remember now! It was just on the corner here.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat happened to you then? Were you alright?\nJuror No. 6:\nWell, you don't get too many people down Calabash Road, you see. So there was no one around when I fell... No one around when I knocked myself out... No one around when I came to again... And no one around when I sneezed. So I picked myself up and went back to my nice, warm house where my grandchildren were waiting for me.\nJudge:\nA sad and lonely picture you paint, sir. You were fortunate not to have frozen to death.\nSusato:\nYes, how lucky that he wasn't more seriously injured!\nRyunosuke:\nTrue. It sounds like it was very nearly another hospital admission...or worse. Ah yes, one more thing... Were you wearing that same green overcoat on the day in question?\nJuror No. 6:\nAbsolutely. It's the only coat I have. It took until this morning to dry out properly. Good job too, or I'd have had nothing to wear here. So count your blessings, I say! Ho ho ho!\nRyunosuke:\n(Hm, I suppose we should... This gentleman certainly had a close shave there.)Pit against Juror No. 2's statement (before Jurors No. 3 and 5 vote innocent)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThose two statements clearly show a flaw in the jurors' reasoning!\nJudge:\nA flaw? What are you talking about, Counsel?\nRyunosuke:\nWell, juror number two? Juror number six?\nJuror No. 2:\nMy, whatever do you mean, sir?\nJuror No. 6:\n.........\nSusato:\nI think perhaps the old man didn't hear you.\nRyunosuke:\nUnbelievable. It's not like I was loud or anything... There is at least one fact of which we can be sure here. The bookshop receipt found in the defendant's room clearly indicates that on the day of the attack... ...he had been to Yore Books and purchased a number of secondhand titles. He then returned home on foot.\nJuror No. 2:\nBut the man says he has no recollection of his return journey.\nRyunosuke:\nThat's correct. But what he does remember is seeing someone appear in front of him on the way. Someone in a green overcoat, who suddenly collapsed on the pavement before his eyes.\nJuror No. 2:\nYes, we are well aware of all this! The poor young woman who was stabbed, obviously.\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nCan we really be sure of that, madam?\nJuror No. 2:\nMy! Whatever do you mean?\nRyunosuke:\nI'm sure you heard juror number six's account of what happened to him that day? That same afternoon, there was somebody else apart from the victim... ...who was wearing a green overcoat and who fell over on the icy streets in the neighbourhood.\nJuror No. 2:\nOh my!\nJuror No. 1:\n...!\nJuror No. 3:\nMy goodness, you, you mean...?\nRyunosuke:\nThat's right. I'm referring of course... ...to hard-of-hearing juror number six!\nJuror No. 2:\nAre, are you really suggesting... ...that the person in the green overcoat whom the defendant saw collapse in front of his eyes... ...was the jolly old gentleman on the end of the bench here with me today?\nRyunosuke:\nThat is entirely possible, yes. After all, the old man... ...has a somewhat similar build to the victim.\nJuror No. 5:\nWell look at that!\nJuror No. 4:\nMy goodness me!\nJuror No. 6:\nHm? Sorry? You need a pee?\nRyunosuke:\nAnd crucially! We know precisely where the old man in the green overcoat fell!\nJuror No. 2:\nOn Calabash Road...\nRyunosuke:\nTherefore, if the person who Mr Natsume saw collapsing in front of him was in fact juror number six... ...it means the defendant must have taken the long route back to his lodgings. And if that's true, then clearly... ...the crime scene on Briar Road where the woman was stabbed...was not on his way home!\nJuror No. 2:\nOooh my!\nJuror No. 5:\nYou idiot, old man! If you hadn't been so daft as to be roaming about there, we'd have boxed this off hours ago!\nJuror No. 4:\nAnd really! What were you thinking, wearing such a befuddling coat?!\nJuror No. 6:\nWhat did you say to me?! Is it a crime for the elderly to walk the streets these days, hm? Is it a crime to slip over on the ice? Is it a crime to keep up with the latest styles and wear a beautiful, green overcoat, is it?!\n???:\n\nJuror No. 2:\nMy Lord, I do hope it won't cause any inconvenience, but...\nJudge:\nYou'd like to change your leaning, I presume?\nJuror No. 2:\nI do declare that I would. I should like to call for a verdict of not guilty.\nRyunosuke:\n...! Thank you!\nJuror No. 6:\nAnd I would too!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nJuror No. 6:\nIs it a crime to change your mind, is it? Well?!\nSusato:\nOh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! That was wonderful!\nRyunosuke:\nWell, we've managed to change a couple of minds at least. It's strengthened our position somewhat.\nSusato:\nYes! And it will prompt the other members of the jury to reconsider their stance as well. They'll be asking themselves if their current leanings are really right or not. Now, if only...

Whatever do you mean?\nRyunosuke:\nI'm sure you heard juror number six's account of what happened to him that day? That same afternoon, there was somebody else apart from the victim... ...who was wearing a green overcoat and who fell over on the icy streets in the neighbourhood.\nJuror No. 2:\nOh my!\nJuror No. 1:\n...!\nJuror No. 3:\nMy goodness, you, you mean...?\nRyunosuke:\nThat's right. I'm referring of course... ...to hard-of-hearing juror number six!\nJuror No. 2:\nAre, are you really suggesting... ...that the person in the green overcoat whom the defendant saw collapse in front of his eyes... ...was the jolly old gentleman on the end of the bench here with me today?\nRyunosuke:\nThat is entirely possible, yes. After all, the old man... ...has a somewhat similar build to the victim.\nJuror No. 5:\nWell look at that!\nJuror No. 4:\nMy goodness me!\nJuror No. 6:\nHm? Sorry? You need a pee?\nRyunosuke:\nAnd crucially! We know precisely where the old man in the green overcoat fell!\nJuror No. 2:\nOn Calabash Road...\nRyunosuke:\nTherefore, if the person who Mr Natsume saw collapsing in front of him was in fact juror number six... ...it means the defendant must have taken the long route back to his lodgings. And if that's true, then clearly... ...the crime scene on Briar Road where the woman was stabbed...was not on his way home!\nJuror No. 2:\nOooh my!\nJuror No. 5:\nYou idiot, old man! If you hadn't been so daft as to be roaming about there, we'd have boxed this off hours ago!\nJuror No. 4:\nAnd really! What were you thinking, wearing such a befuddling coat?!\nJuror No. 6:\nWhat did you say to me?! Is it a crime for the elderly to walk the streets these days, hm? Is it a crime to slip over on the ice? Is it a crime to keep up with the latest styles and wear a beautiful, green overcoat, is it?!\n???:\n\nJuror No. 2:\nMy Lord, I do hope it won't cause any inconvenience, but...\nJudge:\nYou'd like to change your leaning, I presume?\nJuror No. 2:\nI do declare that I would. I should like to call for a verdict of not guilty.\nRyunosuke:\n...! Thank you!\nJuror No. 6:\nAnd I would too!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nJuror No. 6:\nIs it a crime to change your mind, is it? Well?!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that summation examination has concluded with a rather large shift in opinion.\"Juror No. 6:\nI'm sorry about my overcoat setting a cat among the pigeons. I'm leaning to not guilty to make up for it.Before any jurors vote innocent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSusato:\nIt sends a shiver down my spine to hear the members of the jury so convinced of Mr Natsume's guilt. But I can't help feeling that some of their opinions are rather subjective.\nRyunosuke:\nI agree. It's the irrelevance of what some of them are saying that sends a shiver down my spine. Still, at least some of their assertions don't actually incriminate Mr Natsume of anything. That's something.\nSusato:\nWe must use that to our advantage, Mr Naruhodo! Cunningly!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, you're right. (Let's listen to the jurors again, carefully. And if any of their assertions are at odds, I'll pit them mercilessly against each other.)\nSusato:\nYes. Don't hold back. Pit them all against each other!After two jurors vote innocent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSusato:\nYou've changed two of the jurors' minds, Mr Naruhodo!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, just two more to go.\nSusato:\nDeliver the finishing blow now! It's time to turn the tables here!\nRyunosuke:\n(Wish I knew how to do a Susato Takedown... I suppose words will have to suffice for now.)Judge:\nWell, that summation examination has concluded with a rather large shift in opinion. The ayes, two. The noes, four. So the noes have it. Not guilty, they say. Which means we no longer have a consensus among the members of the jury. The trial will continue!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nCould it seem churlish of me to drink from my hallowed chalice moments after raising an objection... ...only to crush it in disgust? ...Pray forgive the discourtesy.Ryunosuke:\nL-Lord van Zieks...?Van Zieks:\nIt seems I must retract my earlier remark.Ryunosuke:\nWhat do you mean?Van Zieks:\nI mistakenly credited these jurors with intelligence by describing them as 'insightful'. Yet we have just witnessed them falling for a cheap trick performed by an Eastern 'entertainer'.Juror No. 5:\nEh?Juror No. 2:\nWhatever do you mean?Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nI haven't tricked anyone! Everything I've said is the truth!Van Zieks:\nIndeed... Stalwart juror number five was undoubtedly repairing the road, as he claims. I believe you said it was 'a good two yards' of the pavement which you had excavated, sir?Juror No. 5:\nThat's right. Took me the whole day and they paid me a measly tuppence for it!Van Zieks:\nNow, my learned Nipponese friend, tell me... ...do you have any notion of the distance that two yards represents?Ryunosuke:\nAh! Um, well... (If I'm honest, I don't have a clue, no...)Susato:\nTwo yards is...a little less than two metres.Ryunosuke:\nLess than two metres? (That's...not much at all!)Van Zieks:\nIn other words, a distance readily vaulted by anyone of moderate vigour. ...Would you not agree, my stalwart friend?Juror No. 5:\nEh? Me? Well, I can't say you're wrong, no.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?Van Zieks:\nAnd did you perchance erect a sign to prevent pedestrians from passing the site of your works?Juror No. 5:\nEh? I wouldn't dream of it! What a waste of time! No coaches would have had a hope of passing anyway, and we just turn any gentlefolk back when they come. Kids just jump right over us all the time.Van Zieks:\n...The accused is no gentleman, as far as I can see. I have little doubt, however, that he could spring over a two-yard trench in his meanderings around town.Juror No. 3:\nAh!Juror No. 4:\nIs that true? Is it?!Van Zieks:\nThe incontrovertible truth is that the books just purchased by the accused were found at the scene. There can be no doubt that on his way back to his lodgings, Mr Natsume walked down Briar Road.Ryunosuke:\nUgh... (Crushed...in a single sentence...)Van Zieks:\nAnd...old man...Juror No. 6:\nC-Cold man?! ...You can talk!Van Zieks:\nYou say that around five o'clock on the day in question, you slipped and fell on Calabash Road. Pray, was there a suspicious-looking Nipponese behind you at the time?Juror No. 6:\nOh! I, I, um...can't say as I remember.Ryunosuke:\nYou, you don't remember?Van Zieks:\nHow about a wager, my learned friend? You say it was this old man that the accused saw. But I would lay a thousand to one...against you being able to prove it.Ryunosuke:\nAAAAAARGH!!!Judge:\nOrdaaar! Ordaaar! Lord van Zieks, explain yourself!Van Zieks:\n...My Lord?Judge:\nIf you had such a trenchant argument up your sleeve... ...why in the world did you not proffer it during the summation examination?Van Zieks:\nHmph... I wanted to give this young foreign student the sightseeing experience he no doubt came for. I wanted him to see for himself how the opinion of the jury is so readily swayed.Ryunosuke:\nUgh...Van Zieks:\nBut my hospitality has its limits. And they have been reached, I feel. So, my learned friend...today's sightseeing tour of London is now over.Ryunosuke:\nWhat, what are you talking about?Van Zieks:\nMy Lord! The prosecution requests permission to call its next witnesses to the stand.Judge:\nGranted. Bailiff! Bring forth the witnesses!Ryunosuke:\nIts...next witnesses?Susato:\nMr Naruhodo, do you not remember? We've been told on several occasions that there were eye witnesses to the incident.Ryunosuke:\nYes, I remember. One of them being a Scotland Yard policeman, no less.Susato:\nI'm afraid that's likely to be the prosecution's next witness.Ryunosuke:\n(Alright, no matter who van Zieks brings to the stand as his witnesses, and no matter what they say... ...I believe in Soseki-san! I know he's innocent! And I'll keep believing to the very end. Until this battle is over!)Van Zieks:\nWitnesses, please state your names and occupations for the court..........Roly:\nConstable Roly Beate, SAH! Nothin' to report on the streets, sah. .........Patricia:\nAnd I'm Mrs. Beate! Patricia's my name. I'm proud to say I'm this young town hero's wife!Roly:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nUm...what's the story here?Patricia:\nWell, in truth, we've not been married long. In fact, we celebrated our first anniversary only the other day!Roly:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nNo no, it was your husband I was asking about. He seems...tired.Van Zieks:\nHardly surprising. Whilst being an honourable occupation, patrolling the beat is the most demanding work in the world.Ryunosuke:\nOh, really? (I'm sure I've heard that before, actually.)Judge:\nIndeed, apart from rare days off, our gallant officers trudge some twenty miles a day, you know. They patrol boarding houses and pubs, collect taxes, survey the streets, check that meters are reading true... And they're responsible for keeping the streets clean, and lighting and extinguishing our streetlights.Susato:\nThere are a number of items on that list that don't sound much like policing duties at all.Ryunosuke:\nI wouldn't just be falling asleep on my feet, I'd have collapsed long ago!Van Zieks:\nBut it goes without saying that a policeman's primary duty is the apprehension of criminals. Even when he's off duty, a constable is expected to investigate and resolve any crimes on his beat. For the London bobby is a man of honour.Roly:\n.........Ryunosuke:\n...And a man of slumber.Van Zieks:\nOn the day in question... ...this man and his wife were walking down Briar Road in the opposite direction. And they witnessed the incident as it occurred. ...Is that not correct, Mr and Mrs Beate?Patricia:\nThat's right, sir! ...Isn't it, Roly?Roly:\n......... Constable Roly Beate, SAH! Nothin' to report on the streets, sah.Ryunosuke:\n(What a great witness he's going to be...)Judge:\nVery good. I'd like to hear your formal testimonies now, please. You will tell the court exactly what you saw on the afternoon of the incident.Roly:\nYes, sah!Witness Testimony\n- What the Witnesses Saw -Patricia:\nIt was our wedding anniversary, and Roly was taking me out for a meal. There was no time to change after work.\nAnyway, two silhouettes appeared out of the fog on the pavement in front of us.\nAll of a sudden, one of them just collapsed on the floor. Then the other scattered something before running off!\nWe ran straight over of course, and then went for help at a nearby police box.\nIt was definitely that Japanese man in the dock. Roly and I both saw him as clear as day!Judge:\nWell...this is extremely compelling testimony, I must say.Ryunosuke:\n...!Susato:\nOh dear, this policeman and his wife are claiming to have positively identified Mr Natsume at the scene. If their testimony is true... ...the alternative course of events that you established in the summation examination will be quashed.Van Zieks:\n...Its death knell, in fact. Because that 'alternative' was never viable in the first place.Judge:\nWhat an unfortunate bechancing. And on your wedding anniversary, too.Patricia:\nOh, I know! But I still managed to go out for the evening with my man! I thank the Lord for that!Susato:\nGosh, the life of a London 'bobby' sounds very hard indeed.Van Zieks:\nIndeed. However... ...this cross-examination will be over in minutes. You may well have time to rest this afternoon.Ryunosuke:\nWhat do you mean by that?Van Zieks:\nMy learned friend, the witnesses saw the face of the man fleeing the scene. They are testifying under oath that it was without doubt the accused, Mr Soseki Natsume.Juror No. 1:\n...!Juror No. 2:\n...!Juror No. 3:\n...!Van Zieks:\nAnd one of these witnesses is a policeman, no less. So you appreciate the gravity of the situation, I'm sure.Juror No. 4:\n...!Juror No. 5:\n...!Juror No. 6:\n...!Ryunosuke:\n(Except that the man's so tired, his wife has to do all the talking...)Judge:\nEnough preamble. Counsel for the Defence, commence the cross-examination, please.Ryunosuke:\nY-Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination\n- What the Witnesses Saw -",

Out with it!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! No no no! Oh no, it's really not that at all.\nPatricia:\nMy husband's a policeman, remember! And I know what I saw! I remember every last detail! Everything!

Please, put your husband's fists down.\nJudge:\nPer-Perhaps you would like the opportunity to supplement your testimony, Mrs Beate? Might that...appease you?\nPatricia:\nOh, thank you, My Lord. That would settle things nicely. Wouldn't it, darling?\nRoly:\n.........\nAdds statement \"I could even tell you the names of the four books he dropped at the scene.\"Patricia:\nAnyway, two silhouettes appeared out of the fog on the pavement in front of us.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nTwo 'silhouettes'?\nPatricia:\nThat's right. They were coming towards us, walking up Briar Road in the opposite direction. There was a rather plump figure followed by a scrawny, thin-looking man.\nSusato:\nThat does sound exactly like the victim as pictured in this print. And like Mr Natsume.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, unfortunately, it does.\nVan Zieks:\nAnd you're certain that at that time there was nobody else nearby?\nPatricia:\nOh yes, quite certain. It was dark, but there are streetlights on Briar Road, you see. There was nobody else around at all. ...Isn't that right, my darling?\nRoly:\nHm? Wha...? ...Ah yes, that's right. Of course, there was a light fog on the ground. But Briar Road is dead straight and you could see a fairly long way down the pavement. And then there's the streetlighting as well. I didn't see any...other...pedestrianzzz...\nVan Zieks:\nBefore sleep takes a firm hold, your answer, please, Mr Beate. ...Are you quite sure of what you've just said?\nRoly:\nYes, SAH! As a copper who spends all day every day keeping watch on the streets, I'd swear to it, sah! I'm as sure...as my love for Patricia is true!\nOh, Pat...\nOh, Roly...\nRyunosuke:\n(Hm... They're still maintaining there was no one else around other than the victim and the attacker. It's starting to seem like that must be how it really happened.)\nSusato:\nIt's beginning to seem like there's nowhere to run.\nRyunosuke:\nWell...that didn't stop Mr Natsume, did it? He fled the scene all too convincingly.\nJudge:\nThank you. I believe we have a reasonably clear idea of the situation just before the incident now. What happened in the crucial moments that followed?Patricia:\nAll of a sudden, one of them just collapsed on the floor. Then the other scattered something before running off!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nHm, 'scattered something'...? What do you mean by that?\nPatricia:\nOh well, I couldn't quite make out what it was at the time. But then when we got closer, we realised what it was. ...Didn't we, darling?\nRoly:\nHm? Wha...? ...Ah yes, that's right. It was some old books.\nJudge:\nI see... Old books...\nRoly:\nYes, SAH! The culprit had dropped a number of them, all around where the victim lay on the pavement.\nJudge:\nIndeed, as clearly pictured in this photographic print.\nPatricia:\nThat rotten Japanese man did that when he did the deed!\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nLet's not forget that it remains to be established that the defendant was indeed the attacker!\nRoly:\nBut we saw him! It was the man in the dock without question, sah. The moustache, the hunched back, the cat-like eyes, the taut mouth, the snub nose...everything!\nRyunosuke:\n(...Any more insults you want to throw in?)\nPatricia:\nThat's right! He looked down at that poor, defenceless woman with those terrifying, intense eyes... ...and then suddenly threw his books onto the pavement and ran away!\nRyunosuke:\nI, I see... (This is tough... They seem as though they're telling the truth here.)\nVan Zieks:\nMay I remind the court that this unambiguous testimony comes from a policeman and his wife. Now please...continue.\nRoly:\nYeeeeees SAH!Patricia:\nWe ran straight over of course, and then went for help at a nearby police box.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWas it your husband who went to fetch help?\nPatricia:\nNo no, I went. I may not be a police officer myself, but I am the proud wife of one, after all! ...Isn't that right, my darling?\nRoly:\nHm? Wha...? Ah, yes. That's right. I asked Mrs Beate to go. I was off duty by that point. But a bobby's never truly off duty, of course, so I felt obliged to stay and guard the scene.\nJudge:\nVery laudable, Mr Beate. Preserving the scene of a crime is a task of considerable importance.\nRoly:\nThat's why I sent Patricia, you see. I told her where to find the right police box.\nRyunosuke:\nUm...forgive my ignorance, but what do you mean exactly by 'the right police box'?\nRoly:\nDepends on a crime's location, you see, as to who deals with it. Where the woman was stabbed wasn't actually on my beat. So I told Patricia the way to the police box for the beat the incident fell under so she could go...and report...it.\nPatricia:\nI ran there as quickly as I could and asked for help from the bobby on duty. There is nothing more potent than a young couple in love working together, you know.\nVan Zieks:\nAnd thanks to your swift response, the case was quickly resolved. The actions...of two model citizens.\nPatricia:\nOh please! You're making us blush! ...Isn't he, darling?\nRoly:\nYes SAH! What Patricia said, sah!\nRyunosuke:\n...Let's move on, shall we?Press (after pressing first and fifth statements, before adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWas it your husband who went to fetch help?\nPatricia:\nNo no, I went.

Well, I decided to have a good look over the area for good measure. I am a proud policeman's wife, after all! I did it for Roly!\nRyunosuke:\nAnd...what was your husband doing at the time?\nPatricia:\nOh, he was lying face down in the snow. Getting some well-deserved rest. He works ever so hard, you know. Ever so hard! ...Don't you, my darling?\nRyunosuke:\n(...Interesting way of guarding the scene of the crime.)\nJudge:\nWell, Mrs Beate, seeing as you've regaled the court with tales of your powers of recollection... ...would you be so kind as to recount the titles of the books you observed at the scene?\nPatricia:\nI'd be happy to. Now, are you all listening? There was 'The Picture of Monsieur Somebody-or-other'. And...'Whatsit Yearnings'... Then there was, um...'A Meal for...Someone' and the last one was definitely...'The Thingummy's Something'. ...You see?\nRyunosuke:\n......... ...Yes, I see there are one or two holes in your memory.\nPatricia:\nOh well, they were along those lines, I'm quite sure.\nVan Zieks:\nThere were indeed books found at the scene with titles 'along those lines' as you put it.\nPatricia:\nWell, what did I tell you? So I think it's very mean the way you've been implying that my testimony can't be trusted.

What, what flaw?\nRyunosuke:\nSimply that, at the scene of the crime...there were only three books, not four!\nPatricia:\nWhat?\nRyunosuke:\nThis is the receipt from the bookshop where the defendant bought his books.\nPatricia:\n'Yore Books'...?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, and it details Mr Natsume's purchases that day. But as you can see...only three books are listed.\nPatricia:\nOnly three...? But...no...no, that can't be! I remember seeing them! There were four books, I tell you! Four dirty old books!\nRyunosuke:\nOh really? Have a good look at this photographic print of the scene of the crime. As you can clearly see from this evidence as well, there are only three books!\nPatricia:\nBut...I just don't believe it! I saw them there! I swear it!

No, I'm sorry, Mrs Beate... ...but Mr Natsume could not possibly have dropped the four books you describe!\nPatricia:\nWhy not?\nVan Zieks:\n...Fascinating. And from your assured tone, something you can readily substantiate with evidence...I presume?\nRyunosuke:\n...! (...Ah.

(...How could he possibly say that?!)\nSusato:\nI feel sure that we know this already. The number of books Mr Natsume was carrying that day, I mean.\nRyunosuke:\n(I think I'd better look over the evidence again.)\nLeads back to:\n\"Counsel, you will present evidence to substantiate your claim or withdraw it.\"\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe evidence is right here...in the form of this bookshop receipt!\nJudge:\nFrom Yore Books?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, this receipt details Mr Natsume's purchases that day.

Which means that your powers of observation, madam, cannot be relied upon.\nLeads to:\n\"Grrr...\"Ryunosuke:\n(So that's it, is it? That's their entire testimony?)Susato:\nWhat do you think, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke:\nWell, I hate to admit it, but on hearing the testimony... ...it really does seem as though Mr and Mrs Beate saw what they say they saw. Mr Natsume running away from the scene on Briar Road that day.Susato:\n......... Yes, I feel the same.Ryunosuke:\nSo if that's true, where does it leave us?Susato:\nThe members of the jury are sure to call for a guilty verdict after this testimony.Ryunosuke:\nOh no! (Then what do we do?)Susato:\n......... If Kazuma-sama were here...Ryunosuke:\n...! What are you trying to say?Susato:\nI think he would try to find a contradiction somewhere else within their testimony.Ryunosuke:\nWhat do you mean, 'somewhere else'?Susato:\nTheir statement about seeing Mr Natsume is unequivocal. Calling that into question won't help. But if you could identify some other part of their testimony which appears to contradict the facts... ...you might be able to discredit them! To make the jury doubt if the pair's memory of the day is accurate!Ryunosuke:\nOh...right...Susato:\nPut simply, we must focus on finding a discrepancy in these statements somewhere. If we don't, I'm afraid the trial may reach an early and unfavourable conclusion.Ryunosuke:\nUgh... (Why do I always seem to be so up against it?)Patricia:\nGrrr...Ryunosuke:\nSo it cannot be denied... ...that though you say it was the defendant that you saw... ...you could very well be mistaken!Patricia:\nOh no... Oh no, oh no, oh no... NOOOOOOOOO!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nIt's plainly evident... ...that it is your powers of deduction that cannot be relied upon, my learned Nipponese friend.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?Van Zieks:\nWhat cannot be denied is that these two witnesses saw the accused running from the scene. A fact that you know very well you have no hope of disproving.Ryunosuke:\nAh!Van Zieks:\nSo you've striven to avert attention from that by dint of some inconsequential discrepancies. Would that be...fair?Ryunosuke:\n...Ugh. (He sees right through me...)Van Zieks:\nBut your plan has somewhat recoiled against you.Ryunosuke:\nWhat are you talking about?Van Zieks:\nIt's quite simple. Let me explain with a toast. To the policeman's wife, and her entirely accurate testimony. ...In every respect.Patricia:\nOh!Van Zieks:\nYou see, the matter is not up for debate. At the scene on Briar Road, a total of four books were most definitely found.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nBut, but what about the photographic print? It only shows three books!Van Zieks:\nQuite right. Only three can be seen...in that print.Ryunosuke:\nThat print? You, you mean to say...?Van Zieks:\nAllow me to present another! ...One that shows the victim's hand.I, I don't believe it!\nIt's...it's the fourth book!Van Zieks:\nAs you will observe... ...the fourth book was hidden from view in the original print by the victim's torso.Ryunosuke:\nNo... NOOOOOOOOO!!!Judge:\nOrdaaar! Ordaaar!Patricia:\nThere! You see? You see?! Look at that! Look, look, look!Ryunosuke:\nYes...Patricia:\nIt's just like I said! ...Isn't it, my darling?Roly:\nYes, SAH! Patricia's always right, sah!Van Zieks:\nLet us study the receipt for the books purchased by the accused on the day in question. Mrs Beate, the titles once again, if you please.Patricia:\nOh yes, of course. 'The Picture of Monsieur Somebody-or-other'...Van Zieks:\n...'The Picture of Monsieur Lecoq'.Patricia:\n'Whatsit Yearnings'...Van Zieks:\n...'Canterbury Yearnings'.Patricia:\n'A Meal for Someone'...Van Zieks:\n...'A Meal for Gaboriau', in fact. As the court has just heard, the witness remembers the book titles flawlessly, save for a few minor details. Mrs Beate's powers of recollection can only be described as exceptional.Patricia:\nDid you hear that, Roly? The gentleman paid me a compliment!Roly:\nYes SAH! Flawless, sah! Patricia is flawless!Ryunosuke:\nB-But...there are only three books on the receipt. And Mrs Beate mentioned four.Van Zieks:\nThere's nothing surprising about that. Clearly the fourth book is that which is shown in this photographic print.Judge:\nI'm sorry, Counsel, but does that not seem odd? Why should the fourth book be omitted from the receipt?Van Zieks:\nIt's not odd at all, My Lord. As the photograph clearly shows, the fourth book was found in the victim's clutches. In other words...it belongs to the victim.Ryunosuke:\n(The victim...was holding her own book?)Susato:\nI wonder...what became of that fourth book?Van Zieks:\nObviously, it wasn't overlooked by the investigating officers at Scotland Yard. I have it here, as evidence.Judge:\nYou will submit that and the aforementioned photographic print to the court, please, Counsel.Van Zieks:\n...My pleasure, My Lord.The second crime scene photograph has been entered into the Court Record.The fourth book has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution rests. I have nothing further to add.Examine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Fourth Book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle on front cover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSusato:\nLet me see... It's a book entitled 'The Lion's Pride'.\nRyunosuke:\nI'm afraid I don't know any English literature at all. So it wouldn't be something I've heard- Wait a minute! 'The Lion's Pride'? (That's strange... ...I think I have heard of a book by that name before. And very recently, too.)\nSusato:\nIt's a title I recognise too, Mr Naruhodo.\n\n\n\n\nBurnt corner on back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSusato:\nOh! Look at this! The book has been badly burnt!\nRyunosuke:\nYou're right. You'd never be able to read it in this state. Especially not the latter pages.\nSusato:\nWhat a terrible waste... Judging from the scorched edges of the paper, I think the damage must have occurred very recently.\nRyunosuke:\nHm...a book...recently damaged by fire... (Why does that seem to raise a red flag with me?)\nThe fourth book's information has been updated in the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nBurnt corner on back (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nI keep looking at this book, and every time I can't believe how badly burnt it is.\nSusato:\nAnd I can't believe what a terrible waste it is. The more I look at the damage... ...the more I'm sure it must have happened very recently, too.\nRyunosuke:\nA book damaged by fire very recently... (Why does that seem significant somehow?)Ryunosuke:\nWhat?!Van Zieks:\nYou seem surprised, my learned friend. But your resistance until now has been in vain. Entertaining, yes. But futile. The spurious longer route to the accused's lodgings that you tried to establish in your summation examination... ...and the attempted discrediting of the witness's powers of recollection in your cross-examination...Ryunosuke:\nFutile...? (...I walked right into this, didn't I?)Patricia:\nYou see? Everything we've said is true! ...Isn't that right, my darling?Roly:\nYes, Pat! Marry me, Pat!Van Zieks:\n...So, perhaps the ladies and gentlemen of the jury would like to reconsider their positions? Should the court waste any more time on this Nipponese travesty? ...Or is the decision you have to make all too apparent already?Juror No. 1:\n...!Juror No. 3:\n...!Juror No. 5:\n...!Van Zieks:\nYou have heard all of the witnesses and seen all of the evidence. This trial has run its course!Susato:\nMr Naruhodo! I'm afraid we are in a terribly precarious position!Ryunosuke:\nI know! But... ...if I fight back in the wrong way now, I could very well just make matters worse! (Think, Ryunosuke, think! What do you do now?)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nI'm, I'm not done yet!\nLeads to:\n\"No, my learned friend. It's over.\"Wait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n......... (I should just keep quiet now and see what happens.)\nJudge:\nWell, it appears the defence has no objection at this juncture. In which case...\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo! Was I not clear? The case for the defence is in great danger!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I realise that. Which is why I decided to let the sweat drip from my trembling brow in silence.\nSusato:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n...You're so right! Sorry! If I don't say anything now, it'll all be over! (And it won't end well for us. I can't let that happen!)\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nNo! Wait! The, the defence-\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nThe defence will have to wait. Because that sapless hesitation...cannot go unpunished.\nRyunosuke:\nAgh! (...Isn't your derisive finger-pointing punishment enough?)\nLeads to:\n\"No, my learned friend. It's over.\"Van Zieks:\nNo, my learned friend. It's over. That last cross-examination was your final chance to establish a credible defence. And you failed. The die has been cast. There is no more room for debate.Ryunosuke:\nWell...it might be over as far as you're concerned, but... but... ......... (Argh! I can't think of what to say!)Susato:\n......... ...If I may, Lord van Zieks? It seems somewhat boorish to close down the debate at this point.Juror No. 4:\n...!Juror No. 2:\n...!Van Zieks:\nHmph. Your insignificant little Eastern isle must be a lawless hole indeed. For a lowly judicial assistant to have the audacity to intervene at a moment like this...Susato:\nOh! .........Ryunosuke:\n......... I am, to my shame, still a very inexperienced lawyer. So you will have to forgive me, but I consider my assistant's advice essential and her opinions invaluable.Susato:\nMr Naruhodo!Judge:\nHmmm... One of this land's great guiding principles is tolerance. So...the court will hear you, madam.Ryunosuke:\nGo ahead, Miss Susato. ...Please.Van Zieks:\nVery well... Pray, what insight can you give us? What have we all overlooked in this matter that you see fit to pursue further?Susato:\n......... Well, the court has been presented with new evidence, but...only after the last cross-examination finished.Judge:\nI see. And you believe that this new evidence warrants further examination, do you?Juror No. 6:\n...!Juror No. 1:\n...!Susato:\nUm...Mr Naruhodo? What do you think? It's just possible that this new evidence might be the decisive proof we've been waiting for. The judge is sure to ask the members of the jury to announce their leanings in a moment.Ryunosuke:\n.........Susato:\nAnd of course, he's sure to ask you to explain what the crucial piece of evidence is and why. So we must take this opportunity to examine the newly presented evidence as thoroughly as possible!Ryunosuke:\nYes, I understand. And...thank you, Miss Susato! (This is it. Susato-san has managed to win us one last chance here... I can't let it go to waste!) The defence wishes to present evidence, My Lord!Van Zieks:\n...!Judge:\n...Very well. The defence may present one further piece of evidence. Evidence that has apparently offers a profound insight into this case, and has hitherto been overlooked.Present Crime Scene Photograph #2 or The Fourth Book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The evidence in question is what we can see from the newly presented photographic print of the crime scene.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nObviously, the evidence in question...is this!\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nObviously it isn't.\nRyunosuke:\nUh?\nVan Zieks:\nYou have already had ample opportunity to discuss that evidence. If you disagree... ...feel free to conduct further examination at your own leisure...without wasting any more of the court's time.\nRyunosuke:\nGAAAAAARGH!\nSusato:\n...Don't forget that the prosecution presented some new evidence at the end of the last cross-examination. I suspect that might be where the clue we're looking for lies.\nRyunosuke:\nIn the new evidence? (...What was that again?)\nSusato:\nRemember that the judge is sure to ask you to explain what significance the evidence has as well. So we should take a moment to examine the evidence in the Court Record as thoroughly as possible!\nLeads back to:\n\"...Very well.\"Ryunosuke:\nThe evidence in question is what we can see from the newly presented photographic print of the crime scene. The fourth book, found in the victim's hand.Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nWe have already discussed the fourth book at length. Other than it being in the victim's grasp at the time of the incident, no significance has been attached to it. Pursuing the matter further would be a flagrant waste of the court's time...as you well know.Ryunosuke:\nAgh!Judge:\nHmmm... Yes, I'm afraid, Counsel, I must concur with the prosecution on this matter. When I afforded you this opportunity... ...you led the court to believe that the evidence in question contained a hitherto undiscovered clue.Van Zieks:\n...!Judge:\nSo I must insist that you elaborate, Counsel. You will identify this clue at once. ...Do I make myself clear?Ryunosuke:\nOh! Um...yes! My Lord! It's...erm...Susato:\nMr Naruhodo... ...I believe the prosecution is trying to avoid a thorough examination of the evidence. Which means...you may very well be on the right track!Ryunosuke:\nI...

So much so that you couldn't read it all any more.\nSusato:\nThat's right. ...Such a pity. And do you see the flaking edges of the burnt pages, Mr Naruhodo? I think that's a sure sign that the damage occurred relatively recently.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, a book damaged in a recent fire...

Even to yourself, I suspect.\nRyunosuke:\nAgh!\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo... ...you...do realise that you can turn the evidence around and look it from all angles, I suppose?\nRyunosuke:\nOf, of course I do!

Why do I feel as though I know about this book already from somewhere?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Don't keep us waiting any longer then, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke:\nMy Lord, the burn on the back of this book reveals a startling truth... ...about the book's owner.Judge:\nI beg your pardon?Patricia:\nBut...we already know who the book belongs to! The victim was gripping it in her hand as she fell to the floor, after all. It's obviously hers!Ryunosuke:\nThe question of how this book came to be in the victim's hand has yet to be answered. However... ...as to the questions of who the book really belongs to, and where it originated... ...the defence...has very credible answers!Judge:\nGood gracious! How can you possibly...?Van Zieks:\nVery well. I'll play along with this futile attempt to delay your inevitable demise. But do remember, the members of the jury may well burn you if your little gamble goes awry.Judge:\nCounsel, the defence's response here is very likely to influence the final outcome of this trial. So tell the court...who do you claim is the owner of this burnt book?Present Joan Garrideb or John Garrideb profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The answer...is that the book belongs to the couple who own the house where the defendant has his lodgings...\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nJudge:\n......... What on earth would make you say such a thing?\nRyunosuke:\nIt's...something of a gut feeling, My Lord, but... ...I can think of no one else more likely to set a book on fire!\nVan Zieks:\nWhat kind of morbid reasoning is that?\nJudge:\nIndeed. It would appear the smoke from the flames has clouded your judgement, Counsel.\nRyunosuke:\nAAAAAARGH! (Never fight fire with fire...)\nSusato:\nA burnt copy of a book entitled 'The Lion's Pride'... I'm quite sure that this isn't the first time we've heard about it, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\n...No, it isn't, is it? Of course!\nLeads back to:\n\"Counsel, the defence's response here is very likely to influence the final outcome of this trial.\"Ryunosuke:\nThe answer...is that the book belongs to the couple who own the house where the defendant has his lodgings... ...a certain Mr and Mrs Garrideb!Van Zieks:\nThe landlords?!Ryunosuke:\nAnd whether this is some extraordinary coincidence, of some kind of fate at work, I don't know, but... ...of all the people in London, one of the six chosen for jury duty in this courtroom today... ...is none other than Mrs Garrideb herself!Juror No. 4:\nOh, oh my goodness...ME?! I, I think you must be mistaken, sir. I'm...I'm... I'm not Mr Garrideb's wife! I'm...his...maid!Ryunosuke:\n...Things would be so much easier if you would just drop the pretence. Alright then, how about a simple question for you? Have you ever seen this book in Mr Garrideb's house?Juror No. 4:\nI, I would never presume to know all of the books he keeps, sir!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nThis is outlandish behaviour! This woman is the accused's landlady, you say? You implicate this hardworking member of the public... You besmirch her without a shred of evidence. Your actions...are unforgivable.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nThis is not mere conjecture. The defence happens to know... ...that on the day in question... ...at almost exactly the same time as the victim was stabbed on the pavement below... ...another 'incident' was taking place in the room on the top floor of Mr and Mrs Garrideb's house.Judge:\nGood Lord! What sort of incident, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\n...A fire, My Lord.Garrideb:\n'Fraid to say it was. Happened in the blink of an eye, you know. The whole place filled with smoke. Couldn't see a bally thing. Didn't take long for the fire to spread, of course. The bally furniture started going up as well! Worst of it is, I lost my favourite. Book called 'The Lion's Pride'.Van Zieks:\n...'The Lion's Pride'...Judge:\nBy Jove! The very same title that's the subject of this debate!Juror No. 4:\nOh dear me!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nThis is risible! All you've told the court is that a book by the same name was involved in a fire. In which case, it would be reasonable to assume that it was burnt to ashes. And entirely unreasonable...to infer that it magically removed itself to the scene of the crime.Ryunosuke:\nPerhaps it would make more sense...if I told you that the cause of the fire was...marital discord. Without going into details, it appears that Mrs Garrideb was considerably enraged. Apparently she continued to attack Mr Garrideb even amid the flames.Patricia:\nOh, how awful! I can't even imagine being so horrid to the one you love. ...Can you, Roly?Roly:\nAbsolutely not, SAH! My Patricia would never raise a finger against me, sah!Garrideb:\nHad all my favourite old novels in that case. But as soon as the fire got hold of them, that was it. Whoosh! Up in smoke! Then the wife started hurling things at me. There was I, back up against the window, under heavy enemy fire! Incendiary books incoming ten to the dozen.Judge:\nThe man had his back up against the window...and he had burning books thrown at him? Goodness gracious! Are, are you suggesting... ...that the book was thrown through a window and...and landed coincidentally at the scene of the crime?Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nNo. A thorough investigation of the surrounding area was conducted the very evening of the incident. And there is no report of the Garridebs' window pane being broken.Ryunosuke:\nThat's quite true. We also saw no sign of broken glass when we visited the Garrideb household. But is it not conceivable that the window was open at the time in-Van Zieks:\nNot even remotely! Let us not forget the season, and the chilling weather that accompanies it. No Londoner would ever leave a window open in the middle of winter.Ryunosuke:\nAh!Judge:\nHm... Does the defence postulate this scenario in all seriousness, Counsel? Do you earnestly claim that the book found at the scene was a flaming projectile thrown by Mr Garrideb's wife?Ryunosuke:\n......... I believe it's a possibility, My Lord.???:That's quite enough!Juror No. 4:\nWell! I hope that everyone can see you for what you are now, you little foreign trickster! You call yourself a lawyer, but you're just a coward! A mean coward!Ryunosuke:\n...Really?Juror No. 4:\nClaiming that our little tiff set the whole neighbourhood alight... Honestly! Implying that I'm merely posing as a maid for appearances' sake... How could you?! It's nothing to do with this beastly case, not any of it! All you've done is sully our family's name!Ryunosuke:\nNo! I, I assure you, that was never my intention!Juror No. 4:\nDragging an upstanding citizen's name through the mud simply to divert attention from your failing defence... I should box your ears, that's what I should do! It's utterly unforgivable!Juror No. 1:\nToo right!Ryunosuke:\nHere we go...Juror No. 1:\nHow long have we sat here now, listening to this Nipponese spouting out his fancy foreign theories? But...think about it! At the end of the day, the only person who could possibly have stabbed the victim... ...is that little hunchback with the moustache! And he ran away from the scene, too!Juror No. 2:\nI, I do declare you're right...Juror No. 3:\nIt's true!Juror No. 4:\nYes! What did I tell you?!Juror No. 5:\nMakes sense to me!Juror No. 6:\n...Hm? Sorry? What's that?Judge:\nWell... ...it would appear that the ladies and gentlemen of the jury are once again in full agreement. What is your position, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks:\nIn truth, My Lord...I feel these have been unnecessarily protracted proceedings. But then one must always exercise patience in order to savour the best vintage.Ryunosuke:\nNo! Wait! The, the mystery of the fourth book still hasn't been-Van Zieks:\nIf books are your predilection, my learned friend...study them on your own time.Ryunosuke:\n.........Van Zieks:\n.........Ryunosuke:\n(...What, no 'forgive the discourtesy' this time?)Judge:\nAhem! In that case, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will now state your individual decisions regarding the defendant's culpability for the court to hear!Juror No. 1:\nGuilty!Juror No. 2:\nGuilty!Juror No. 3:\nGuilty!Juror No. 4:\nGuilty!Juror No. 5:\nGuilty!Juror No. 6:\nGuilty!Judge:\n...Thank you...for that unambiguous response.Ryunosuke:\n(That's twice now. It's over...)???:\nMr Naruhodo, don't give up!Ryunosuke:\n...! Miss Susato...?Susato:\nHave you forgotten? The battle isn't over yet!Ryunosuke:\nYou're, you're not suggesting...?Susato:\nOf course. The defence has the right to another summation examination at this point. You could still convince the jurors to change their minds. You have one more chance!Ryunosuke:\n...My Lord! The defence...asks to exercise its right to a summation examination!Van Zieks:\nHmph. You believe you still have tricks up your sleeve?Ryunosuke:\nI don't intend to trick anybody. I intend to uncover the truth! (This is no time to be downcast. As long as there's a chance, I have to stay strong and determined!)To be continued...Judge:\nI have considered the defence counsel's request for a further summation examination of the jury... ...and I have determined that the court must uphold the defence's judicial right to this procedure. So, Counsel...you will now proceed with your second summation examination. I presume the jury is ready, Mr Foreman?Juror No. 1:\nWe are, My Lord.Judge:\nVery good. In that case, I must ask each of you now to state clearly and concisely for the court... ...the grounds on which you find the defendant guilty of this crime.Judicial Findings\n- The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1:\nThe accused left behind evidence at the scene, didn't he? Those three books of his.Juror No. 2:\nIf there was some novel alternative explanation about how the victim was stabbed, I might reconsider...Juror No. 3:\nEven if the woman was throwing books, it can't be related to this crime if the window was closed, can it?Juror No. 4:\nDearie me, it was only a little book! Hardly life-threatening, even with a direct hit!Juror No. 5:\nLook, I just want to get this over with. If I don't bring home some pay tonight, I'll be in a tidy bit of trouble.Juror No. 6:\nCome to think of it, we had a fire at home a while ago. It gave me the sneezes.Judge:\nHm, yes...considerably more tangible arguments from all members of the jury this time around, it seems. ...With one notable exception, of course.Van Zieks:\nMy learned student friend was unable to find fault in the previous witness testimony.Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nSo the court must accept the fact that it was indeed the accused seen fleeing from the scene. And moreover... ...no one else was even at the scene to commit the crime!Judge:\nWell, if the eye witnesses are correct...it would seem as if the conclusion is somewhat set in stone. I fail to see how it can be argued any other way.Susato:\n...That means, I'm afraid, that during this summation examination... ...it's essential that you establish some other tangible explanation for the facts!Ryunosuke:\nBut how? What would even constitute a tangible explanation here?Van Zieks:\n...Isn't it obvious? Who stabbed the woman and how? Those two details are all you need provide. Simply give us a name and a method by which the attack was conducted.Ryunosuke:\n(...And there I was thinking this might be hard.)Susato:\nBut Mr Naruhodo, you have to do it! Otherwise this really will be where the trial ends!Ryunosuke:\nUgh, no pressure then...Judge:\nThat's quite enough preamble. Proceed with the summation examination, please. I presume you are prepared, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\nOh, yes! ...My Lord. (Alright, Ryunosuke, focus your mind now... Clearly, the key to this summation examination... ...is going to be juror number four, the maid. Or should I say, Mrs Garrideb?)Susato:\nWe have a book that disappeared from the Garridebs' house on the evening of the incident... ...and the fourth book found in the victim's hand.Ryunosuke:\nThere must be a way to link the two. Yes, that's what we have to find... (...using every technique I've learnt in my short career so far! Whatever it takes!)Susato:\nDon't forget to keep an eye on Mrs Garrideb and how she reacts...even to the things other people say!Jury Examination\n- The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1:\nThe accused left behind evidence at the scene, didn't he? Those three books of his.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBut as we now know, there were four books, not three!\nJuror No. 1:\nWell? What difference does it make?\nRyunosuke:\nThere's every possibility that the fourth book...in fact belongs to the defendant's landlord!\nJuror No. 1:\nYes, that's the part I have a problem with.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nJuror No. 1:\nWell, at the point the woman was stabbed, this landlord fellow was at home, wasn't he? Enjoying a fiery scrap with his wife or something, you said.\nRyunosuke:\n...That's not exactly how I put it, no.\nJuror No. 1:\nWell anyway, the point is, the fellow and his wife were somewhere else when it happened.\nRyunosuke:\nHm...\nSusato:\nI think...that's what you call a strong alibi.\nJuror No. 1:\nSo it couldn't have been the landlord who did it. Which only leaves the Nipponese fellow. Honestly, I can't see what all this palaver's about. It's a done deal, isn't it?\nRyunosuke:\n(...I suppose it is, since I've nothing witty left to say.)Juror No. 2:\nIf there was some novel alternative explanation about how the victim was stabbed, I might reconsider...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo...you might be willing to change your decision, you mean?!\nJuror No. 2:\nOh my! Such delight on your face! But I'm afraid I shan't be swayed by emotion. Despite what you may think of me, I am a very modern, metropolitan and rational woman.\nRyunosuke:\n...That's great.\nJuror No. 2:\nIf one reads the morning papers, it's all forgotten by tea time, isn't it? So why read them in the first place? You see? Modern, metropolitan and rational thinking, wouldn't you say?\nRyunosuke:\n...And not at all extreme.\nJuror No, 2:\nAs I see it, an overwhelmingly suspicious Japanese man has been implicated by overwhelmingly strong testimony. So despite one or two minor puzzlements, I do declare that the man is overwhelmingly guilty! ...Modern, metropolitan and rational logic, wouldn't you say?\nRyunosuke:\n...Overwhelmingly.\nJuror No. 2:\nBut us modern 'gals' are always delighted to embrace new fads, you know. So I'd be only too happy to consider an exciting new theory if you could come up with one!\nRyunosuke:\n(I'd be happy to do that, too...if only I could.)\nSusato:\nLet's do our very best not to disappoint the modern and metropolitan young lady!\nRyunosuke:\n...Right. (I'm glad you omitted 'rational' there.)Pit against Juror No. 5's statement (after Juror No. 5 changes his statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"These two statements clearly have a deeply significant connection!\"Juror No. 3:\nEven if the woman was throwing books, it can't be related to this crime if the window was closed, can it?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBut what about the possibility that the window was open?\nJuror No. 3:\nWhat about it? I mean, there's just no way it could have been.\nRyunosuke:\nHow can you be so sure?\nJuror No. 3:\nThe prosecutor fellow over there said it earlier, didn't he? Winters in London are no joke. You don't want to invite that sort of cold indoors. So no, that window wasn't open. Us Londoners like sitting by the fire and staying warm, see.\nRyunosuke:\nBut you couldn't categorically state that the window wasn't open, could you?\nJuror No. 3:\nIt just wasn't. They wouldn't have opened it.\nRyunosuke:\nThen what's the point in even having windows? Huh?!\nJudge:\nCounsel! You will kindly refrain from childish bickering!\nRyunosuke:\nOh, um...sorry... (Somehow, I need to show there's an undeniable possibility that the window was open... ...because this young man isn't going to budge otherwise.)Pit against Juror No. 6's statement (after Juror No. 6 changes his statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThese two jurors' statements clearly contradict one another!\nJudge:\nThey do? How exactly, Counsel?\nJuror No. 3:\nDon't point at me again! I told you, it wasn't me!\nJuror No. 6:\nHm? What's that you say? Speak up, lad, speak up!\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number three! Do you see?\nJuror No. 3:\nOh! Me? See, see what, sir?\nRyunosuke:\nDid you hear juror number six's account of his birthday celebrations last year? It seems, despite being a Londoner, he once opened his windows in the middle of winter.\nJuror No. 3:\nWell yes, of course. Because it was an emergency. I mean, obviously, if the room was filled with smoke from a fire, then you'd be mad not...to open the... ......... Oh!\nRyunosuke:\nExactly. On the day in question, at the time of the incident, there was a fire in the Garrideb household. And Mr Garrideb had the following to say about it: 'The whole place filled with smoke.'\nJuror No. 3:\nOn my hat!\n\n\n\nPursue Juror No. 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number four! Do you have something to say about that?\nJuror No. 4:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nMrs Garrideb!\nJuror No. 4:\nOh dearie me! What is the meaning of this? How dare you imply that I'm hiding who I really am!\nRyunosuke:\nIt's imperative that you confirm something for the court. So please, it's time to drop the pretence now.\nJuror No. 4:\nWh-What is it?\nRyunosuke:\nWhen the fire started in your house that day, did you or your husband open the window?\nJuror No. 4:\nWha...? I, I beg your pardon? What are you insinuating?!\nRyunosuke:\nThe room would have been thick with smoke after the carpet and bookcase caught fire as they did. In a situation like that...it's inconceivable that you wouldn't have opened the window!\nJuror No. 4:\n......... And what if we did?\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nJuror No. 4:\nOh, alright then. ...Yes, you're right. My husband was frantically trying to open the window. Which can't have been easy, since I continued to give him a justly deserved book battering.\nRyunosuke:\n...Even though your house was on fire?\nJuror No. 4:\nOh, you never stop throwing until the anger subsides. It would be terribly bad for the nerves to do otherwise.\nRyunosuke:\n...Of course. I should have realised.\nSusato:\nThat's a significant step forward, Mr Naruhodo. You've managed to establish that the window was open. We simply must have that added to Mrs Garrideb's formal statement.\nChanges Juror No. 3's statement to \"The window could have been open when the woman was throwing books. I mean, it's definitely a possibility.\" and Juror No. 4's statement to \"Now you mention it, yes, the window was open at the time. I'd clean forgotten, but it's true.\"\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nTherefore, to clear the smoke, either Mr Garrideb or his wife almost certainly opened the window. That, you cannot deny, would be in no way out of the ordinary!\nJuror No. 3:\nNo...I suppose it wouldn't.\nJuror No. 6:\nWhen you get to my age, you learn a thing or two, you know. And I can tell you... ...you'd have to be a prize idiot not to open the window if there was a fire! Eh?\nJuror No. 3:\nYes! Of course! I, I think I need to reconsider my statement.\nRyunosuke:\nYes! Please do. (That's a step in the right direction...I think.)\nChanges Juror No. 3's statement to \"The window could have been open when the woman was throwing books. I mean, it's definitely a possibility.\"Juror No. 3:\nThe window could have been open when the woman was throwing books. I mean, it's definitely a possibility.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nAt the point when the victim was attacked on Briar Road... ...we know there was a small house fire in the Garrideb household on the opposite side of the street.\nJuror No. 3:\nWell yes, it certainly seems that way. And on account of the smoke, I imagine they would have had the windows wide open in spite of the cold.\n\n\n\nPursue Juror No. 4 (before Juror No. 4 changes her statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number four!

I'd clean forgotten, but it's true.\"\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nWe also know that Mrs Garrideb was throwing flaming books at her husband. Her husband, who was backed into a corner by the window due to his wife's frenzied attack.\nJuror No. 3:\nYes, that's right. So there's definitely a chance that one of the books could have flown past the man and out of the window. Only...\nRyunosuke:\nOnly what?\nJuror No. 3:\nOnly I can't really see how it could have gone all the way over to the other side of the road, that's all.\nRyunosuke:\nAh!\nJuror No. 3:\nSo I don't really see how I can change my decision, really.\nRyunosuke:\nOh...I see... (...That wasn't enough? What is it going to take to persuade these people?)Juror No. 4:\nDearie me, it was only a little book! Hardly life-threatening, even with a direct hit!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBut the 'little book' was on fire at the time, was it not?\nJuror No. 4:\n...With flames of love, I'll have you know.\nRyunosuke:\n...There's really no such thing as a 'loving' incendiary bomb.\nJuror No. 4:\nWell he brought it upon himself! It's playing with fire to betray a fiery love! Isn't it? ...Well? Don't you agree?\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Erm...well...any kind of betrayal is...is certainly a bad thing, yes. But I think the argument might have arisen out of your misunderstanding, Mrs Garrideb...\nJuror No. 4:\nNever you mind that! The point is, we were just having a jovial little dispute, nothing more! And I won't have any more of these suggestions that it was anything whatsoever to do with this crime!\nRyunosuke:\n......... (Right, well, we'll see about that. But what about juror number five? He doesn't seem to be turning a hair at Mrs Garrideb's relentless onslaughts...)\nSusato:\nIt's almost as though he's used to it. What a gentle soul he is!Juror No. 4:\nNow you mention it, yes, the window was open at the time. I'd clean forgotten, but it's true.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe fourth book found at the scene of the crime shows very obvious signs of fire damage. And the title of the book...is 'The Lion's Pride'. The same title, in fact, as the book that Mr Garrideb told us he had been reading.\nJuror No. 4:\n......... Well, I really couldn't say.\nRyunosuke:\nOn the day in question, did you or did you not throw at your husband... ...the copy of 'The Lion's Pride' that he had been reading?\nJuror No. 4:\n......... I did.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nJuror No. 4:\nIt was the first thing I could lay my hands on. So I hurled it straight at him! And now you come to mention it, yes... ...he was rather enjoying reading it, you're right.\nRyunosuke:\nWhy did you not reveal this information to the court from the outset?\nJuror No. 4:\nBecause I couldn't, you insolent little man! I didn't remember! At times like that, you pick up and throw whatever you can lay your hands on, as well you know!\nRyunosuke:\n...I really don't.\nJuror No. 4:\nI barely noticed I was throwing a book, much less the title of it!\n\n\n\nPursue Juror No. 5 (before Juror No. 5 changes his statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWhat is it, juror number five?!\nJuror No. 5:\n......... You know something? I've, I've remembered what it was! That memory I'd blocked out...\nRyunosuke:\nAh.\nJuror No. 5:\nIt was listening to what this granny was saying. Brought it all flooding back.\nJuror No. 4:\nWho are you calling a granny, you cheeky devil?! I'm Mrs Garrideb or the maid, I'll have you know!\nRyunosuke:\n(...The man doesn't even flinch. Please tell me that's not because he's so used to being hit all the time!)\nJuror No. 5:\nIt, it was about two weeks ago now. I'd just got back home after work, like. I put my hand in my pocket for the wages I'd just earnt that day...and I nearly died. There was a hole. Every last penny had dropped out.\nRyunosuke:\nOh dear, what a disaster.\nJuror No. 5:\nYou haven't heard the half of it, boy.\nRyunosuke:\nOh?\nJuror No. 5:\nThe wife was cutting up some chicken at the time. I, I could hardly get the words out, but I told her straight: 'I've lost the day's wages, luv.' Next thing I knew, the blade was whistling past my ear. Stuck into the wall next to me, it did. About an inch deep.\nRyunosuke:\n......... (No words... Just...terror...)\nJuror No. 5:\nI could smell it then, you know. That God-awful stench of the Thames. I was sure I was going to end up face down in the muddy banks that night, I can tell you. Now...that's a real disaster, isn't it?\nRyunosuke:\n...I'll never use the word lightly again.\nJuror No. 5:\nAnyway, the point I'm trying to make is this: When women lose their rag, they'll throw anything at you! Knives, hatchets, hammers...you name it!\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo! You mustn't think that all women are so short-tempered and unrefined!\nRyunosuke:\nNo no, I wasn't thinking that!\nSusato:\nThrowing household objects at people is... Well, it's so uncivilised. At least attack with honour! Using a bow or the like.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat? Attack? ...Who are you going to attack?\nSusato:\nNever mind. Anyway, this man's words... ...could be rather significant, I think.\nRyunosuke:\n(Alright, we'll come back to the bow and arrow thing later...if I dare.)\nChanges Juror No. 5's statement to \"A woman in a rage will hurl almost anything at you. The kitchen knife really brought that home to me.\"\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n...Right. Totally understandable.\nJuror No. 4:\nI mean, you can't waste time deciding what to use next, can you? When you feel the way I did...you don't care what it is, you just want it to smash into his face!\nRyunosuke:\n......... You see where violence can lead, Miss Susato?\nSusato:\n...I'm disheartened to think you might believe me capable of such behaviour. Anyway... I have a feeling I might have noticed someone reacting a little strangely to Mrs Garrideb's remarks just now.\nRyunosuke:\n(Ah, perhaps I missed something while I was... preoccupied...)Juror No. 5:\nLook, I just want to get this over with. If I don't bring home some pay tonight, I'll be in a tidy bit of trouble.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou just want to 'get this over with'? How can you sit there and say something like that? A man's future is at stake here!\nJuror No. 5:\nWell him and me both then, like I said before!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nJuror No. 5:\nI told you already. I'm a day labourer, aren't I? If I don't bring home some readies with me tonight... ...you'll find me floating face down in the Thames tomorrow morning.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?!\nJuror No. 5:\nYou heard me! My missus isn't one to mess about, you know. She can be fierce, believe you me!\nRyunosuke:\n(...Another shining example of marital bliss, then.)\nJuror No. 5:\nA situation like this cropped up the other day. It was...well...um... ......... D'you know, it's funny, but I can't quite remember.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nJuror No. 5:\nIt was too frightening, that's the thing. I must have blocked it out.\nRyunosuke:\n(Helpful...)\nSusato:\nI wonder if Mr Beate will ever be dragged into the Thames by his scarf...\nRyunosuke:\n...Don't even go there, Miss Susato. (There must be some way to jog his memory about this.)Juror No. 5:\nA woman in a rage will hurl almost anything at you. The kitchen knife really brought that home to me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYour wife really threw a kitchen knife at you?\nJuror No. 5:\nThat's right. She was chopping meat with it. ...Had a tidy edge on it, believe me. Still...it's all memories, isn't it? It started with that smile  she threw me when we were courting. And since then, the list of things she's thrown at me has grown along with our relationship. There was a cup, then a glass...then a pot...a kettle...a chair...a wardrobe...a cooker...a bathtub...\nRyunosuke:\n...Your wife must be even beefier than you.\nJuror No. 5:\nAnd things came to a head last week when she threw me. Right into the Thames. Still...she's not so bad when she's calmed down. She's a little sweetheart, really.\nRyunosuke:\n...I'm...so happy for you.\nJuror No. 5:\nIf you want to know what I think... ...I think this whole idea of 'ladies first' that we're so obsessed with in this country... ...was thought up by some clever lads who'd been tossed in the Thames a few too many times by their wives.\nRyunosuke:\n......... That's...a very interesting theory.\nSusato:\nWhat a terrible thought.\nRyunosuke:\n(On the face of it... ...this juror's statement just sounds like a really extreme anecdote. But I think it might turn out to be an extremely powerful weapon. A weapon I might be able to use to make the jurors accept an alternative explanation here.)Pit against Juror No. 2's statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"These two statements clearly have a deeply significant connection!\"Juror No. 6:\nCome to think of it, we had a fire at home a while ago. It gave me the sneezes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nDoes...that have anything to do with your decision about the defendant's culpability in this case?\nJuror No. 6:\nSorry? What's that? You'll have to speak up, lad.\nRyunosuke:\n......... Could you tell us more about that fire?\nJuror No. 6:\nIt was last winter. My grandchildren baked me a lovely cake on my birthday. It had seventy-five candles on the top, it did! What a sight to behold it was!\nRyunosuke:\nYou put candles...on a cake?! Was, was it some kind of devil-worship?\nJuror No. 6:\nOf course not! It was an angel cake! To celebrate my birthday, obviously!\nSusato:\nIt seems that's a common custom here in Great Britain, Mr Naruhodo.\nJuror No. 6:\nAnyway, I mustered all my puff to blow them out... ...only I must have blown wrong somehow. The flames didn't go out, but candles went flying all over the room! The furniture caught and everything went up! The whole place filled with smoke!\nRyunosuke:\n(...Definitely sounds like devil-worship to me.) And...by 'the sneezes', I presume you mean a cold. But how did you catch a cold from a fire?\nJuror No. 6:\nWhat a fiasco it was. The grandchildren, bless them, threw water over me as they tried to put out the flames. And then, because the whole room had filled up with smoke of course... ...we had to open all the windows to clear it.\nRyunosuke:\nThe windows...\nJuror No. 6:\nThe biting winter air rushed over me like the devil dancing on my grave, it did! I caught a terrible cold from it. It put me in hospital for a while. ...I won't forget that birthday in a hurry!\nRyunosuke:\n...I knew it was devil-worship all along. (But something about this old man's story is playing on my mind for some reason...)\nChanges Juror No. 6's statement to \"Winter house fires are dire. You have to open windows to clear the smoke. That's when the chill gets you, see.\"Juror No. 6:\nWinter house fires are dire. You have to open windows to clear the smoke. That's when the chill gets you, see.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\n...Um, did you change your statement from before?\nJuror No. 6:\nWell, yes. It was one of my most memorable birthdays, you see. I couldn't let it go unremembered.\nRyunosuke:\n(...I'm sure the defendant will be delighted that you're using his trial to explore your past.) And how is that memory related to this case exactly?\nJuror No. 6:\nHm? Sorry? What's that? You'll have to speak up, I'm afraid!\nRyunosuke:\n...Never mind. (He's as deaf as a post...when he wants to be. ...But actually, this old man's anecdote... ...might just provide the alternative explanation I need to make my point to some of the other jurors.)\nJuror No. 6:\nWe used unlit candles on my birthday this year. It's safer that way.Pit against Juror No. 3's statement (before Juror No. 3 changes his statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThese two jurors' statements clearly contradict one another!\nJudge:\nThey do? How exactly, Counsel?\nJuror No. 3:\nDon't point at me again! I told you, it wasn't me!\nJuror No. 6:\nHm? What's that you say? Speak up, lad, speak up!\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number three! Do you see?\nJuror No. 3:\nOh! Me? See, see what, sir?\nRyunosuke:\nDid you hear juror number six's account of his birthday celebrations last year? It seems, despite being a Londoner, he once opened his windows in the middle of winter.\nJuror No. 3:\nWell yes, of course. Because it was an emergency. I mean, obviously, if the room was filled with smoke from a fire, then you'd be mad not...to open the... ......... Oh!\nRyunosuke:\nExactly. On the day in question, at the time of the incident, there was a fire in the Garrideb household. And Mr Garrideb had the following to say about it: 'The whole place filled with smoke.'\nJuror No. 3:\nOn my hat!\n\n\n\nPursue Juror No. 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number four! Do you have something to say about that?\nJuror No. 4:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nMrs Garrideb!\nJuror No. 4:\nOh dearie me! What is the meaning of this? How dare you imply that I'm hiding who I really am!\nRyunosuke:\nIt's imperative that you confirm something for the court. So please, it's time to drop the pretence now.\nJuror No. 4:\nWh-What is it?\nRyunosuke:\nWhen the fire started in your house that day, did you or your husband open the window?\nJuror No. 4:\nWha...? I, I beg your pardon? What are you insinuating?!\nRyunosuke:\nThe room would have been thick with smoke after the carpet and bookcase caught fire as they did. In a situation like that...it's inconceivable that you wouldn't have opened the window!\nJuror No. 4:\n......... And what if we did?\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nJuror No. 4:\nOh, alright then. ...Yes, you're right. My husband was frantically trying to open the window. Which can't have been easy, since I continued to give him a justly deserved book battering.\nRyunosuke:\n...Even though your house was on fire?\nJuror No. 4:\nOh, you never stop throwing until the anger subsides. It would be terribly bad for the nerves to do otherwise.\nRyunosuke:\n...Of course. I should have realised.\nSusato:\nThat's a significant step forward, Mr Naruhodo. You've managed to establish that the window was open. We simply must have that added to Mrs Garrideb's formal statement.\nChanges Juror No. 3's statement to \"The window could have been open when the woman was throwing books. I mean, it's definitely a possibility.\" and Juror No. 4's statement to \"Now you mention it, yes, the window was open at the time. I'd clean forgotten, but it's true.\"\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nTherefore, to clear the smoke, either Mr Garrideb or his wife almost certainly opened the window. That, you cannot deny, would be in no way out of the ordinary!\nJuror No. 3:\nNo...I suppose it wouldn't.\nJuror No. 6:\nWhen you get to my age, you learn a thing or two, you know. And I can tell you... ...you'd have to be a prize idiot not to open the window if there was a fire! Eh?\nJuror No. 3:\nYes! Of course! I, I think I need to reconsider my statement.\nRyunosuke:\nYes! Please do. (That's a step in the right direction...I think.)\nChanges Juror No. 3's statement to \"The window could have been open when the woman was throwing books. I mean, it's definitely a possibility.\"Before pressing Juror No. 6's statement and pitting Jurors No. 3 and 6's statements against each other\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSusato:\nWe need to demonstrate who, apart from Mr Natsume, could have attacked the young woman on the street. As well as how he...or she could have done it.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, but once again the jurors' statements are full of personal prejudice. A lot of them seem convinced they're right, even in the face of logical arguments to the contrary.\nSusato:\nI think you're going to need to pit them against each other to force them to accept an alternative explanation.\nRyunosuke:\nYes... (I don't necessarily need to find contradictions between their assertions... Just a connection might do the trick.) Alright, I'll see what I can do. If anything stands out, I'll go in for a strike!\nSusato:\nThat's the spirit!After pressing Juror No. 6's statement and pitting Jurors No. 3 and 6's statements against each other, and before pursuing Juror No. 4 correctly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSusato:\nHm... When you were discussing the window before... ...I feel sure a certain member of the jury reacted in a rather unusual way.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I thought I might have seen something like that out of the corner of my eye. It could be worth pursuing...\nSusato:\nYes! 'Pursue' jurors to catch them off guard, that's the secret!\nRyunosuke:\n(We need to use every trick at our disposal here, so...let's see what I can do!)After pursuing Juror No. 4 correctly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo the window was open when the Garridebs were arguing that day.\nSusato:\nYes, Mrs Garrideb has finally admitted to it. Which is a very significant victory for the defense!\nRyunosuke:\n(...I feel like the fog's starting to clear, and an alternative explanation to this case is starting to show itself.)Ryunosuke:\nThese two statements clearly have a deeply significant connection!Judge:\nGood grief! You mean they don't contradict each other? Explain, Counsel! At once!Ryunosuke:\nJuror number two...do you think perhaps... ...that this could be one such novel alternative?Juror No. 2:\nOh my! Whatever do you mean?Ryunosuke:\nAn alternative explanation...as to how the victim was stabbed in the back.Juror No. 5:\nWhat are you talking about?Ryunosuke:\nWe've demonstrated that the fourth book - 'The Lion's Pride' - that was found at the scene of the crime... ...originated in Mr Garrideb's room on the top floor of his house. Therefore it's equally possible that some other object besides the book... ...could have found its way from the Garrideb household to the street below.Juror No. 5:\nEh? What's that now?Ryunosuke:\nAfter all, Mrs Garrideb could have thrown any number of different objects at her husband. ...Isn't that right, juror number four?Juror No. 4:\nWhat are you insinuating now, you...you little beanpole?!Ryunosuke:\n(I'm beginning to think that...ever since the true origins of this book came to light... ...perhaps she's had a feeling this might be what happened.)Juror No. 1:\nNow you listen here, you Eastern galah! As the foreman of this jury, I demand a straight answer. You give us this yarn about some other object making its way out of the house...but what? What was it?Ryunosuke:\n......... (I'm really taking a big gamble here. That was a bold accusation to make...but I haven't any real evidence to back it up. But I'm certain...that at the very least this warrants further investigation.) Alright, Mr Foreman, I'll try to explain the defence's theory. The 'other object' that found its way from the Garrideb household to the scene of the crime was...Present Jackknife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\".........\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\n...Probably this.\nJuror No. 1:\n......... Did you hear that, everyone? Did you hear that belligerent outburst?\nJuror No. 2:\nOh my! How horrifying!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nJuror No. 4:\n...I think it's very clear now. You're the one grasping at the first thing that comes to hand here, young man!\nRyunosuke:\nAgh!\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo, be careful! It's very dangerous to give indiscriminate answers like that.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh, I'm sorry. I was nervous and I obviously went for the wrong thing. (After all, what I'm suggesting here is a long shot, to put it mildly.)\nLeads back to:\n\"But I'm certain...that at the very least this warrants further investigation.\"Ryunosuke:\n......... Juror number four...Mrs Garrideb...Juror No. 4:\nWha...? What now?!Ryunosuke:\nI must apologise in advance for this... ...but I need you to confirm something else for the court. This knife... Have you ever seen this knife before?Juror No. 4:\nAh...Judge:\nGood Lord, Counsel! What on earth are you doing? That's the weapon that was lodged into the victim's back, man!Ryunosuke:\nMy Lord, remember that when the victim was attacked, Mr and Mrs Garrideb were in the throes of an argument. Mrs Garrideb was hurling anything she could at her husband, who'd been backed up against the window. A window that had been opened to clear the smoke...and through which a book sailed to land at the crime scene.Juror No. 1:\nYou can't seriously believe that! The book...was found in the victim's grasp!Juror No. 3:\nAre you saying that it flew out of the window and across the street to land neatly in her hand?Juror No. 5:\nHuh! Even my missus hasn't got an aim like that!Ryunosuke:\nYes, I admit...there are many details we don't yet understand. But that's the point! That's precisely why... ...we must not allow this trial to end! Not right now!Juror No. 2:\nOh my!Juror No. 6:\nAgh!Ryunosuke:\nMrs Garrideb, your answer, please! Have you seen this knife before or not?Juror No. 4:\n......... ...Oh! Ah...um... AAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!*Thud*???:My Lord!Juror No. 2:\nI, I wish to change my decision! ...I'm a woman of my word, after all.Ryunosuke:\nThank you, madam!Juror No. 1:\nYes, I agree. I certainly didn't see this coming, but... ...I just don't think it would be right for this trial to come to an end now with so many unanswered questions.Ryunosuke:\nMr Foreman!Juror No. 5:\n......... I'd have to agree. Not that I think the granny did it, mind.Juror No. 3:\n...Yes, you know what? I'm not quite happy about this at the moment, either.Juror No. 1:\nAll together now, ladies and gents...Ryunosuke:\nWe... We...did it...Susato:\nOh, congratulations, Mr Naruhodo!Judge:\nSo, as a result of the defence's summation examination, a number of jurors' leanings have changed. Two jurors call guilty, against four now calling innocent. Accordingly, the opinion of this court is divided... ...and this trial will continue!Judge:\nNow then, Lord van Zieks...how does the prosecution wish to proceed?Van Zieks:\n...This trial is rapidly descending into a farce. Like a corked wine...the first few sips are bitter enough... ...but what follows is so repugnant, it's good for nothing save the gutter!Juror No. 1:\nIf, if I may, Lord van Zieks... ...the defence has just put forward a credible alternative explanation for what happened.Van Zieks:\nCredible? Is that your considered opinion, Mr Foreman? The defence's argument is a joke to which I barely know how to respond. But let me start by insisting... ...that you must familiarise yourselves better with the relative positions of those places being discussed.Ryunosuke:\nWhat do you mean by that? (...What's his angle this time?)Van Zieks:\nIt should already be more than apparent, that between the crime scene and the Garrideb household... ...runs a rather wide street, Briar Road. Which means that the distance from the Garridebs' house to the scene is some... Yes, fifteen yards.Susato:\nLet me see... Fifteen yards... That's around fourteen metres.Ryunosuke:\nF-Fourteen metres? (Oh. ...That's a little farther than I'd imagined.)Van Zieks:\nAnd, as you ladies and gentlemen of the jury rightly noted as having portentous significance... ...the fourth book was found in the victim's clutches. In other words...the smouldering book, wantonly hurled by the lady of the house travelled some fifteen yards... ...to land on the opposite side of the road, neatly between the collapsed victim's fingers and thumb. ...Is that your final conclusion, my learned...and deluded friend?Ryunosuke:\nAh! Um...Van Zieks:\nAnd did the jackknife follow a near identical trajectory to plunge into the middle of the victim's back? This fantasy is somewhat stretching the notion of 'having a bad day' for the victim, I think. Even those pathetic serialised detective stories have more believable plots!Ryunosuke:\nAAAAAAAAAGH!!! ......... (There's nothing I can say to that...)Susato:\nThat...that prosecutor loves the sound of his own voice!Ryunosuke:\nMiss Susato!Susato:\nSerialised detective stories are pathetic, are they?! How dare he?!Ryunosuke:\nUm... Maybe let's pick our battles here...Susato:\nMy Lord, might I be allowed to speak?Judge:\nAs judicial assistant, you may speak for the defence, yes. Go ahead.Susato:\nThe prosecution may consider the idea a fantasy... ...but what the defence has postulated was believable enough to persuade the jury to change its leaning. And as such...the court has a duty to explore this alternative explanation as thoroughly as possible!Van Zieks:\n.........Susato:\nTo that end... ......... ...juror number four - Mrs Joan Garrideb...must be called to testify and submit to cross-examination!Judge:\nSaints alive! A cross-examination of a juror?! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Well...this, this is highly irregular. It is unprecedented for a member of the jury to be summoned to the witness stand.Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nAnd unnecessary.Judge:\nL-Lord van Zieks?Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nThere are already witnesses in the stand whose testimony the defence may further cross-examine. If my learned friend's farcical theory has any truth in it... ...then both a burning book and a jackknife must have flown through the sky before this couple's eyes. And we must assume they would be able to testify accordingly.Judge:\nHmmm... What say you, witnesses?Roly:\n......... Yes, SAH! Constable Roly Beate reporting for duty, sah!Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nWell... Good morning, Officer.Roly:\nSorry for dozing until now, sah! I haven't slept for a month, on account of a villain who's appeared on my beat, sah.Susato:\nOh, they are so heroic, these 'London bobbies'.Roly:\nPatricia, my darling, I've been neglecting you. But no more!Patricia:\nOh Roly, my hero! You make me swoon!Judge:\nVery well. I hereby reject the defence's request...Susato:\nOh...Judge:\n...and order the witnesses in the stand to testify again. State forthwith before the court any details pertaining to the defence's alternative explanation of events.Roly:\nYes...SAH!Witness Testimony\n- Constable Beate's Report -Roly:\nThis case has nothing to do with Mr and Mrs Garrideb. Believe me, a London bobby is good for his word!\nYou see - SAH! - the windows on the top floor of the Garrideb house are top-hinged casements.Patricia:\nObviously, if anything had been thrown out of the window, we would have seen it.\nI did leave the scene to go and fetch help, but my trusty Roly was there to make sure nothing was disturbed.Roly:\nI didn't take my eye off the crime scene for one moment, sah! Nothing strange to report on that front, sah!Judge:\nWell, this is quite startling. Top-hinged casement windows!Van Zieks:\nThat detail was not in the police report, Constable.Roly:\nAh, yes, um... Sorry about that. I...must have been a little drowsy... Ahem.Van Zieks:\nYou cannot excuse your sins with drowsiness every time, Constable.Roly:\nNo, SAH!Ryunosuke:\nUm...sorry, but... ...what exactly is a top-hinged casement window?Van Zieks:\nAnd you... You cannot excuse your ignorance with such trite remarks, my learned friend.Ryunosuke:\n...Of course...sorry.Susato:\nI've found it, Mr Naruhodo! Cast your mind back to the windows in Mr and Mrs Garrideb's room...Ryunosuke:\n(Alright, I'll try...)Susato:\nSo the window opens in order to allow air to circulate inside the house. But as it's a top-hinged casement window, it swings open along the upper edge, you see.Van Zieks:\nI'm glad you've rectified your ignorance. A casement window's most prominent feature... ...is its 'stay' - a metal bar which prevents the window from being opened beyond a certain amount.Ryunosuke:\nIt, it prevents it opening? (This is all news to me!)Roly:\nAbsolutely correct, sah! In other words, if a book or knife were to have been thrown through the open window... ...it would have clattered against the pane and fallen straight down to the pavement below.Ryunosuke:\nNo...Van Zieks:\nYou see the problem, then? Good...your education in windows is complete. There was never any possibility of either the book or the knife travelling fifteen yards over the road. That is, unless the window pane had been shattered... something we've discounted already.Ryunosuke:\nTh-That can't... BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!Patricia:\nDid you see that, Roly? That young Japanese man just collapsed in agony!Roly:\nOh yes, my darling. I saw it. I saw how he crumbled before me.Patricia:\nOh, Roly! You're so strong!Ryunosuke:\n(How is this happening? I haven't even started the cross-examination yet, and already my argument's been destroyed.)Judge:\nCounsel, if you could drag yourself upright again...the court awaits your cross-examination.Ryunosuke:\n...My Lord. (Oh good. Another desperate situation...)Cross-Examination\n- Constable Beate's Report -",

You should have said so earlier, sah.\nRyunosuke:\n...Yes, well... So, could you answer the question? (That was a waste of time, then.)\nRoly:\nAbsolutely, sah! I will answer it to the fullest of my abilities, sah! There's a surprising reason why Mr and Mrs Garrideb's domestic dispute can't be related to this case. ...But before I get into that, sah, just one thing...\nRyunosuke:\nYes?\nRoly:\nI'd very much like you and all your countrymen to understand the great British institution of Scotland Yard. So I hope you'll take back some tales of us London bobbies and how we uphold our guiding principles.\nRyunosuke:\n...I wasn't planning on going back just yet. I've only just arrived here.\nRoly:\nSo to that end - SAH! - I'd be happy to lend you my warrant card for your perusal.

Just because I'm a woman, it doesn't make my testimony any less valuable. You might just see me as the wife of a policeman, but I'm a woman of my word, I am!\nRyunosuke:\nI...I really don't remember ever suggesting that I doubted you...\nPatricia:\nNo excuses!

There's a surprising reason why Mr and Mrs Garrideb's domestic dispute can't be related to this case.Roly:\nYou see - SAH! - the windows on the top floor of the Garrideb house are top-hinged casements.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBy which you mean they don't open fully...is that correct?\nRoly:\nYes, sah! They're just there to allow a bit of air through the house, you see. So they're restricted as to how much they open.\nVan Zieks:\nAnd therefore anything thrown out of the window from inside the room... ...would simply strike the pane and fall to the street directly below. For clarity, allow me to mark the map. Here...is the location where objects would have fallen.\nJudge:\nHm, yes... Directly opposite the scene of the crime, on the other side of the rather wide road.\nRyunosuke:\n(Would it have been so hard for somebody to mention this top-hinged casement thing before?) Well...I have another question for you, Constable.\nRoly:\nAnd what would that be, sah?\nRyunosuke:\nHow do you even know? Why would you have any idea what sort of windows Mr and Mrs Garrideb's house is furnished with?\nRoly:\nAh, well sah... That's very simple. You see, I helped with the investigation yesterday.\n\n\n\nPursue Patricia Beate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nDo you have something to add, Mrs Beate?\nPatricia:\nHm...? Sorry?\nRyunosuke:\nYou look...well, delighted. Is there some particular reason for that?\nPatricia:\nOh, I was just remembering, that's all. We really were...so lucky.\nRyunosuke:\nLucky? What do you mean?\nPatricia:\nWell, of course I feel terrible for the poor woman who was attacked. Don't misunderstand me, please. But we were just so lucky it didn't happen on Roly's beat. It was so close, you see!\nRyunosuke:\nOh... I hadn't realised.\nPatricia:\nOh yes, that street, Briar Road...that's the boundary between Roly's beat and the next one. Isn't that right, my love?\nRoly:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nConstable Beate!\nRoly:\nHm? ...Oh! Y-Yes, that's right. That's the reason I was helping out with interviewing the occupants of the Garrideb household yesterday. Their house is on my beat, you see...sah.\nRyunosuke:\n(Hm, that really was cutting it close then...)\nSusato:\nConstable, I wonder if you could clarify something... If the Garrideb household is on your beat, does that mean that the pavement next to it is as well?\nRoly:\nOutside Mr Garrideb's house? Yes, ma'am! The pavement on that side of the road is part of my beat!\nRyunosuke:\nI see... I was unaware of that.\nPatricia:\nJust think, if the woman had been attacked just on the other side of Briar Road... ...we would never have been able to go for that meal to celebrate our wedding anniversary! But...that's the life of a bobby, after all.\nJudge:\nExtraordinary people, our bobbies. Tirelessly working for the benefit of all Londoners.\nPatricia:\nDo you know what I think?

That must be it.\nPatricia:\nAnd now it's my turn, I think!\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou helped? In what way?\nVan Zieks:\nVarious members of the public were questioned in order to gather information about the case.\nRoly:\nThat's right, sah. The sad truth is, we're all overworked. So even though it wasn't under the jurisdiction of my own beat, I obviously wanted to help.\nRyunosuke:\nI see. Well...thank you.\nPatricia:\nOh, is it my turn now?Patricia:\nObviously, if anything had been thrown out of the window, we would have seen it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBut according to my notes here, the sun had gone down already and it was dark.\nPatricia:\nOh, but Roly and I were strolling along, gazing at the night sky and looking for our lucky star!\nRyunosuke:\n...Sorry?\nPatricia:\nThe star that will guide us to eternal happiness!\nRyunosuke:\n...Can't it guide you to answer the question?\nRoly:\nIf a flaming book had cut across the sky in front of us... ...it would have lit up like a shooting star.\nPatricia:\nAnd if I'd seen a shooting star, I would have made a wish upon it! 'Let Roly be an inspector,' I would have said! Three times at least!\nRoly:\nOf course, what with the smog and everything, we couldn't actually see any stars...\nVan Zieks:\n...In short, are you trying to say that neither a book nor a knife crossed the sky before you?\nRoly:\nYes, sah, that is correct, SAH! As sure as the night sky in London is starless, sah!\nRyunosuke:\n(Hm... It certainly seems like they're telling the truth...)\nPatricia:\nAnd then we saw the poor woman fall to the ground, so we ran straight over to help her.Patricia:\nI did leave the scene to go and fetch help, but my trusty Roly was there to make sure nothing was disturbed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYes, you said that you went to a nearby police box to fetch another officer. Is that right?\nPatricia:\nThat's right, yes. If it had been on Roly's beat, I would have known exactly where I was going, of course.\nRoly:\nDon't feel bad, my love. You can't be expected to know the location of every police box on every beat.\nPatricia:\nSo Roly told me the way. Only...I sort of got a little lost on the way.\nRoly:\nPatricia, my darling...that's why I love you. Your terrible sense of direction is bewitching to me!\nOh, Pat...\nOh, Roly...\n\nRyunosuke:\n(Oh, please...)\nPatricia:\nSo, I suppose I was gone for about fifteen minutes. But like I said, my Roly was at the scene the whole time, making sure nothing was disturbed!\nRoly:\nI was off duty at the time, of course, but...a true bobby is never really off duty, SAH!Patricia:\nI know what I saw. My eyes never let me down! ...My sense of direction is a little off sometimes, though.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nMrs Beate, nobody is questioning what you've told us.\nPatricia:\nI saw it, I did! That evening, I saw it clearly! That little Eastern man with the whiskers and the funny curved back, slinking away from the scene!\nRyunosuke:\nHaah...\nPatricia:\nAnd I know what I didn't see, as well. I didn't see any flaming books or knives flying through the sky!\nRyunosuke:\n...All very clear. You, you also mentioned something about having a poor sense of direction?\nPatricia:\nOh...yes...well. That's a little embarrassing, really. I'm always ending up at the wrong place when I've made arrangements to meet Roly. He gets ever so cross!\n\n\n\nPursue Roly Beate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nConstable Beate! ...Is there a problem?\nRoly:\n......... Eh? Ah...hm? Ah, no sah... No problem, sah.\nRyunosuke:\nDid your wife's remark just now bring something to mind, perhaps?\nRoly:\nOh, um...well...in a way, sah...yes, sah. I, I was just remembering that the same thing happened that evening, is all.\nRyunosuke:\n...! You mean, Mrs Beate lost her way? On the night of the incident?\nRoly:\nWell, you see, I sent her off to find a police box in the next beat over from mine. But she was gone a fair bit longer than what I was expecting. I thought she'd be back inside ten minutes, but my darling was gone a good fifteen.\nPatricia:\nOh, Roly! You're such a tease! But the reason I was so long was because of the bouquet, silly.\nRoly:\n...The bouquet?\nRyunosuke:\nSorry, what bouquet are you talking about?\nPatricia:\nOh, it was a present for our wedding anniversary. ...Roly's so romantic! He saved up for it with farthings and ha'pennies he found in the gutter while doing his rounds!\nRyunosuke:\nYes...how romantic!\nPatricia:\nI'd forgotten all about it until just now. ...Had you, my darling?\nRoly:\nAaaaaaaaah! Hm? ...Ah! Oh, yes... But that...was just...between us... No talking about it to anyone else, darling. You have to promizzz...\nPatricia:\nReally? ...Oh.\nRyunosuke:\n(What was that all about? Constable Beate looked very obviously troubled during that exchange...)\nSusato:\nI'm afraid I can't offer any useful insight, Mr Naruhodo. But I'm quite sure of one thing: We have to ask Mrs Beate about the bouquet!\nRyunosuke:\nMrs Beate! This bouquet you just mentioned... I'd like you to add details about it to your testimony, please.\nPatricia:\nOh, really?! Yes, I'd love to!\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nChanges statement from \"I know what I saw. My eyes never let me down! ...My sense of direction is a little off sometimes, though.\" to \"What happened was, I dropped my bouquet and ended up losing my way for a while.\"\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nOh well...we've all made mistakes like that from time to time, I'm sure!\nPatricia:\n...I got the wrong church on the day of our wedding, I remember. It caused a terrible kerfuffle. I very nearly got married to someone I'd never even met before!\nJudge:\nThat would most certainly not do, madam. Anyway...continue with your testimony, please, Constable.\nRoly:\nYes, SAH!Patricia:\nWhat happened was, I dropped my bouquet and ended up losing my way for a while.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou mean you dropped the bouquet at the scene of the crime?\nPatricia:\nYes, that's right. Oh, I was so upset. When we ran over and saw it was a woman with a knife in her back... ...I was so shocked, I dropped the bouquet Roly gave me. It was in a dark spot where the streetlights weren't casting any light, so I didn't notice at first.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd then you went to the police box to report it to the policeman whose beat it was on?\nPatricia:\nYes! And I came back to the scene together with the other constable, you see. That's when I spotted my bouquet again. But the funny thing was, when I went to pick it up... ...it was nowhere near the victim's body at all!\nVan Zieks:\n...In case you need reminding, Mrs Beate, the victim is not deceased.\nPatricia:\nI was all flustered for a moment before I heard a voice calling me from the other side of the road.\nRyunosuke:\n...Your husband, presumably?\nPatricia:\nThat's right! Silly me, I'd gone over to the wrong side of the street! Although I'm going to blame the bouquet this time. I can't think how it got there, I really can't.\nRyunosuke:\n(So the bouquet somehow moved from one side of Briar Road to the opposite...)\nJudge:\nHmmm...curious indeed.\nPatricia:\nIsn't it? ...But the worst of it is, I forgot to pick the bouquet up again when we left the scene! That beautiful rose Roly bought me! With that change from the gutter he spent so long collecting!\nVan Zieks:\n......... By 'bouquet'... ...do you perhaps mean this sorry, solitary rose?\nPatricia:\nOh! OOOOOOH! Yes! Yes, that's it! That's the bouquet Roly bought me for our anniversary...with old bits of change he found in the gutter!\nRyunosuke:\n...Maybe just call it a rose.\nJudge:\nTell us, Lord van Zieks, where did you come by the flower?\nVan Zieks:\nAccording to the report by the police officer in charge of the crime scene investigation... ...it was found on the edge of the pavement in front of the Garrideb household.\nRyunosuke:\n(In front of the Garridebs' house?)\nVan Zieks:\nAlthough it wasn't noticed until the morning, as it lay where the streetlamps cast no light. It was believed to be of no relevance to the case, since it was found on the opposite side of the thoroughfare.\nPatricia:\nOh, thank you, sir! Thank you! Could I have it back now, please?\nJudge:\nHm... No, I think for good measure, this rose should be added to the Court Record as evidence.\nPatricia:\nOh.\nThe anniversary bouquet has been entered into the Court Record.\nPatricia:\nBut...it's a symbol of our love... I want it back after the trial! Do you hear me? I want it back!\nJudge:\nGood grief! Rest, rest assured that I shall do my very best not to forget, Mrs Beate.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou mean you dropped the bouquet at the scene of the crime?\nPatricia:\nYes, that's right. Oh, I was so upset. When we ran over and saw it was a woman with a knife in her back... ...I was so shocked, I dropped the bouquet Roly gave me.

It's such a beautiful flower.\nRyunosuke:\nAh, this is a rose, is it? I've never seen one before.\nSusato:\nDo you not take an interest in flowers, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nI wouldn't say that exactly. But I do know three types, at least.\nSusato:\nGosh...three?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, plum blossom, peach blossom and cherry blossom.\nSusato:\nPerhaps...you should consider branching out? Learning some that aren't fruit tree-based, for example?\n\n\n\n\nWrapped paper or ribbon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nIt's very stylish paper the flower's wrapped in, isn't it?\nSusato:\nIt's...just an old newspaper, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\nOh... I suppose it's because I'm not used to seeing English print. It looks so exotic to me!\nSusato:\nAh, I...see...\nRyunosuke:\nIs something wrong?\nSusato:\nOh! No no. I was just thinking that if you wrapped a stone-baked sweet potato in English newspaper... ...it might look like some sort of fancy cake.\nRyunosuke:\n(Ah, Susato-san, you do love your cakes...)Roly:\nI didn't take my eye off the crime scene for one moment, sah! Nothing strange to report on that front, sah!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\n'Nothing to report'...?\nRoly:\nThat's correct, sah. I had my eyes wide open the entire time. Never looked away for a second. No one else approached the scene, and nothing was removed from it. I can swear to that on the Yard's honour, SAH!\nRyunosuke:\nReally? That...seems a little strange.\nRoly:\nBeg your pardon, sah? Strange, sah? Seems altogether regular to me.\nRyunosuke:\nThis burnt copy of 'The Lion's Pride' was originally in the Garrideb household. So the question remains, how did it find its way into the hand of the victim? Can you shed any light on that, seeing as you were at the scene of the crime the entire time?\nRoly:\n......... ...Ah-ha! Could it be a different copy, sah? One that just happened to be burnt as well?\nRyunosuke:\nEven if that were possible, why would the victim have been gripping a book like that in her hand? As we can see from this photographic print, she had a bag over her shoulder.\nRoly:\n......... Well, SAH! That book was in the lady's hand from the moment we arrived at the scene.\nRyunosuke:\n...Is that so? (There's something about this statement that's not sitting right with me. The two mysteries of how that knife ended up in her back, and how that book ended up in her hand... There must be some common thread between them...)Press (after pressing first statement and pursuing Patricia Beate correctly, before adding statement \"I know what I saw. My eyes never let me down! ...My sense of direction is a little off sometimes, though.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\n'Nothing to report'...?\nRoly:\nThat's correct, sah. I had my eyes wide open the entire time. Never looked away for a second. No one else approached the scene, and nothing was removed from it. I can swear to that on the Yard's honour, SAH!\nRyunosuke:\nReally? That...seems a little strange.\nRoly:\nBeg your pardon, sah? Strange, sah? Seems altogether regular to me.\nRyunosuke:\nThis burnt copy of 'The Lion's Pride' was originally in the Garrideb household. So the question remains, how did it find its way into the hand of the victim? Can you shed any light on that, seeing as you were at the scene of the crime the entire time?\nRoly:\n......... ...Ah-ha! Could it be a different copy, sah? One that just happened to be burnt as well?\nRyunosuke:\nEven if that were possible, why would the victim have been gripping a book like that in her hand? As we can see from this photographic print, she had a bag over her shoulder.\nRoly:\n......... Well, SAH! That book was in the lady's hand from the moment we arrived at the scene.\nRyunosuke:\n...Is that so? (There's something about this statement that's not sitting right with me. The two mysteries of how that knife ended up in her back, and how that book ended up in her hand... There must be some common thread between them...)\n\n\nPatricia:\nUm, can I ask you something? ...Please, Mr Lawyer, sir!\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Um...yes, of course. What is it?\nPatricia:\nYou're, you're doubting us, aren't you? I can tell!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! I, I wasn't really... I mean... (What's she doing?)\nPatricia:\nPlease. Just because I'm a woman, it doesn't make my testimony any less valuable. You might just see me as the wife of a policeman, but I'm a woman of my word, I am!\nRyunosuke:\nI...I really don't remember ever suggesting that I doubted you...\nPatricia:\nNo excuses! I don't want to hear it! My voice will be heard! My Lord, you'll let me speak, won't you?\nJudge:\nYes, Mrs Beate, I will allow you to supplement your testimony if you so desire. ...Sometimes the path of least resistance is the sage one.\nRyunosuke:\n(That was a very loud mutter...)\nPatricia:\nI heard that! That Japanese man thinks a policeman's wife's word counts for nothing, does he? Well watch out, sir! I might let you get away with something like that, but my Roly won't!\nRyunosuke:\n...Duly noted, Mrs Beate. Please, I humbly ask you to continue...\nSusato:\nWhat could she possibly be about to say, I wonder...?\nAdds statement \"I know what I saw. My eyes never let me down! ...My sense of direction is a little off sometimes, though.\"Present Anniversary Bouquet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You claim, Constable Beate, there was 'nothing to report' in the fifteen or so minutes you were guarding the scene.\"Before Anniversary Bouquet is added to the Court Record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSusato:\nI'm so sorry, Mr Naruhodo. I had no right to speak out.\nRyunosuke:\nWh-What do you mean?\nSusato:\nI requested the cross-examination of Mrs Garrideb without consulting you. ...Even if the judge did deny me.\nRyunosuke:\nOh, I see. Well, I agree with you. We do need testimony from Mrs Garrideb... ...if we're ever going to get to the truth of this matter.\nSusato:\n...! Do you really think so?\nRyunosuke:\nWell, think about it. No matter how far it is across the road or how that window opens... ...Mr Garrideb's book found its way to the scene of the crime somehow, didn't it?\nSusato:\nYou're right!\nRyunosuke:\nAnd then there was Mrs Garrideb's reaction to me showing her the knife. ...The woman's hiding something, I'm sure of it.\nSusato:\nYou're right again!\nRyunosuke:\nWe need to use this cross-examination to uncover more clues. We'll get to the bottom of this one way or another, I swear!\nSusato:\nYes!After Anniversary Bouquet is added to the Court Record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSusato:\nWell, Mr Naruhodo... What do you make of all this?\nRyunosuke:\nHm, yes... ...the whole idea of an invisible attacker has been troubling me all along. But I believe I'm starting to get a picture of what really happened here now.\nSusato:\n...!\nRyunosuke:\nThe fourth book that had no business being at the scene of the crime... ...made me sure that Mrs Garrideb was hiding something from us. But it's becoming increasingly clear...that someone else has been hiding something from us as well. (I think I may already be armed with everything I need to strike a decisive blow here. This time...it's going to expose the whole truth about this mysterious affair.)Ryunosuke:\nYou claim, Constable Beate, there was 'nothing to report' in the fifteen or so minutes you were guarding the scene. But that cannot be.Roly:\n.........Patricia:\nWhat...what do you mean to say?Ryunosuke:\nIn your testimony just now, Mrs Beate, you explained to the court... ...that when you arrived back at the scene of the crime with the policeman assigned to that beat... ...the bouquet you had dropped at the victim's side was no longer anywhere nearby.Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nYes, on the opposite side of Briar Road to where the victim was attacked. But considering the size of that meagre 'bouquet' - if a single, sorry bloom can be so described... ...no doubt it was blown in the wind across the street, back into the gutter where it belongs.Patricia:\nMeagre...?Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nBut if that were the case... ...why did Constable Beate not testify to the fact?Van Zieks:\n...!Susato:\n'No one else approached the scene, and nothing was removed from it.' Constable Beate swore to that on Scotland Yard's honour.Patricia:\nBut the bouquet belonged to me! It has nothing to do with the case. That's...that's why Roly didn't mention it, I'm sure!Ryunosuke:\nNo, because sadly it's not only your bouquet we're talking about here. More than one thing in this case is mysteriously the wrong way round!Van Zieks:\nWhat are you talking about?Ryunosuke:\nThink about it... Besides Mrs Beate's bouquet...there's Mr Garrideb's book! Mr Garrideb's copy of 'The Lion's Pride', which was thrown out of the window by his wife... ...would have struck the pane of the casement window and landed here, on the west side of the street. And yet... ...it was actually found here, on the opposite side of the road, in the victim's hand. Meanwhile, according to the testimony we've heard, Mrs Beate's bouquet... ...should have been dropped here, at the scene of the crime, on the east end of the street. But in fact... ...it was actually found here, on the opposite side of the road, in front of Mr and Mrs Garrideb's house. There's no logical explanation for those things... ...unless somebody deliberately moved them!Patricia:\nWhat are you trying to say? The way you're talking, it sounds like you think my Roly's done something wrong!Juror No. 4:\nDon't you listen to a word that scrawny lawyer says! Wittering on about books and bouquets... Why should we care? It's nitpicking, that's what it is!Ryunosuke:\n(...Oh good. Mrs Garrideb's come round.) You might call it nitpicking, Mrs Garrideb... ...but deliberately meddling with the scene of a crime is a criminal offence. It's called, um...Susato:\n...'Tampering', Mr Naruhodo.Juror No. 2:\n...!Juror No. 4:\n...!Juror No. 6:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nBut the person responsible for this tampering cannot admit to it... ...for a very subtle, but compelling reason.Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\n'Tampering'? You've barely heard the term before! Tell us, my learned friend, who would possibly have had cause to carry out such an elaborate deception?Ryunosuke:\n(Yes, there is someone who tampered with the scene of the crime that evening. All the evidence and all the testimony points to that one particular person...)Judge:\nCounsel, I must demand that you substantiate this conjecture. Who are you saying is responsible for tampering with the scene of the crime?Present Roly Beate profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, there's only one person it could have been.\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\n(No, no, no, no, no! There's only one person who could have done this!)\nJudge:\n...Do you intend to share your internal monologue, Counsel?\nRyunosuke:\nSorry, My Lord, I was just taking a moment to get things straight in my mind.\nVan Zieks:\nAnd for that moment of wasted court's time...you will pay the price!\nRyunosuke:\nUgh... (Is it me or are things getting more strict around here?)\nSusato:\nWhat you were thinking is right, Mr Naruhodo. There is only one person who had the opportunity to tamper with the scene of the crime. There can be no mistake!\nRyunosuke:\nYes...I, I thought so! (There's no point overthinking this. There's really only one option.)\nJudge:\nI need an answer, Counsel.\nLeads back to:\n\"Who are you saying is responsible for tampering with the scene of the crime?Ryunosuke:\nObviously, there's only one person it could have been. Constable Roly Beate, it was you!Judge:\nWhat?! A policeman?! A member of Scotland Yard?Patricia:\nWhat nonsense! Why would my Roly do something like that? There's no one straighter than my husband! No bobby works more tirelessly for the people of London!Ryunosuke:\nMrs Beate... ...you said in your testimony that your husband asked you to go to a nearby police box to fetch the officer on duty. The fifteen minutes that you were absent from the scene is the only opportunity anyone had to tamper with it.Patricia:\nYou're making it up! It's all nonsense! It's all lies! What about that Japanese man with the whiskers? I bet it was him! He did it!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nIf that was true, Constable Beate would have seen him do it!Patricia:\nOh...Susato:\nAnd forgive me for pointing it out, but when you dropped your bouquet, Mrs Beate... ...it was after the defendant had fled the scene.Patricia:\nArgh! Well...well...Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nFirst you make accusations about the landlord and his wife...and now you incriminate a policeman as well. But your accusations lack one very important thing.Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nYou claim the crime scene was tampered with. But there is only one reason anyone would commit such a reckless crime: To hide something.Patricia:\nThat's right! He's right! But my husband and I just happened to be there, that's all! So why would we have anything to hide? It doesn't make sense!Van Zieks:\nYou've offered no motive for this alleged tampering. And until you do...your accusations are nothing but empty threats!Ryunosuke:\n......... (Constable Beate had a very good reason for wanting to tamper with the scene of the crime. That's the key to this entire affair.)Susato:\nMr Naruhodo, have you...? Have you managed to solve this mystery?Judge:\nCounsel, you have made a very serious accusation against a London police officer. If you are mistaken, I'm sure I need not point out that your reputation as a lawyer will be irrevocably damaged. ...With that stark warning in mind, you will now explain to the court the motive for this alleged tampering.Ryunosuke:\nYes, My Lord. ......... Constable Beate's motive for tampering with the crime scene was to hide...Where the book fell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n...Where the book fell to the ground. That's what he had to cover up at all costs.\nVan Zieks:\n......... And why, exactly?\nRyunosuke:\nHm?! Oh, well, of course, the reason is...erm... .........\nVan Zieks:\nDo you have something to hide, my learned friend? For it seems you're unwilling to share the reason with the court.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nOr could it be, perhaps...that no reason exists?\nRyunosuke:\nAgh! (He didn't even try to hide his displeasure...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Counsel, you have made a very serious accusation against a London police officer.\"Where the bouquet fell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n...Where the bouquet fell to the ground.

That is what this bobby had to cover up at all costs!Van Zieks:\nWhat?!Patricia:\nWhere the victim fell? You, you mean where she was attacked? What are you talking about? We told you at the very start, didn't we?! On the pavement of Briar Road! We saw it happen, remember? It was right here...as if anyone didn't already know!Ryunosuke:\n...That's certainly what everybody has been led to believe. But in fact...that isn't where the victim was stabbed at all.Patricia:\nWha...? WHAAAAAAAAAT?!Judge:\nI'm beginning to wonder where this tumultuous trial will end, Counsel.Van Zieks:\nIf that's your assertion...then the court is dying to know, my Nipponese friend... ...where are you proposing that the crime actually took place that evening?Present sidewalk next to Mr Natsume's Lodgings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"But, but that's...\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe crime in fact took place...here!\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nWith that answer, it's now entirely unambiguous! The scene of the crime...is this very courtroom!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nVan Zieks:\nOr to be more precise... ...in the exact location where that student in mourning dress stands.\nRyunosuke:\nAgh!\nJudge:\nHmph. And the criminal must be duly punished for his sins.\nRyunosuke:\nGYAAAAAARGH!\nSusato:\nNow we've been condemned, there is nothing more to say. Except perhaps... ...'That behaviour was really very out of character for the accused, My Lord.'\nRyunosuke:\nAlright! I'll think again...\nLeads back to:\n\"I'm beginning to wonder where this tumultuous trial will end, Counsel.\"Judge:\nBut, but that's...Van Zieks:\nOn the opposite side of the road?Patricia:\nI, I don't understand...Ryunosuke:\nOn the evening in question... ...Mr Garrideb's book fell directly down from the open window above. And your bouquet, Mrs Beate, never moved at all. What did move...was the scene of the crime itself!Judge:\nGood... GOOD GRACIOUS!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nPerhaps you haven't been listening to the ample testimony the court has heard. But these witnesses both saw the moment the attack took place!Patricia:\nThat's, that's right! I saw it! With my own eyes!Ryunosuke:\nIt was five o'clock in the evening and already dark. There was the typical London fog on the ground. When you saw the incident unfold and ran to the victim's aid... ...that was actually on the west side of Briar Road.Patricia:\nNo! That's not true! It, it can't have been!Ryunosuke:\nConstable Beate then arranged for you to be absent for a while by sending you for help. And during the fifteen minutes you were away, he transplanted the crime scene. He moved all the things shown in this print: the victim herself...the four books... He moved everything in fact...to the pavement on the east side of Briar Road!Judge:\nExtraordinary...Ryunosuke:\nBut the constable overlooked one thing.Patricia:\nWhat? What did he overlook?Van Zieks:\nThe bouquet, I presume?Ryunosuke:\nExactly.Susato:\nThe prosecution told the court just a few minutes ago about the discovery of the rose bouquet. Lord van Zieks said, 'It wasn't noticed until the morning, as it lay where the streetlamps cast no light.'Judge:\nYes, it couldn't be seen in the dark, obviously.Ryunosuke:\nWhich is why it was only the bouquet... ...that was found in its original position, on the pavement on the west side of Briar Road.Patricia:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nAnd that...is the defence's theory about what really happened that evening. How do you respond... ...Constable Roly Beate?Roly:\n......... Um...well...I'm... Very sorry. I didn't mean to nod off again. But I haven't slept properly...in a month. Did I miss...anything...important...?Patricia:\nOh Roly... ...it isn't true, is it? What that lawyer said is all lies, isn't it? I know it is, because you're the most upstanding, righteous man I know!Roly:\n......... I had...a dream... A terrible dream... All the thingzzz...I did that night... Everything...come out... Everything...expozzz'd...Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\n...!Roly:\nOnly...it seemzzz... ...it...wasn't a dream at all.Judge:\nGood... GOOD GOLLY! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! What on earth is the meaning of all this?Patricia:\nOh Roly, why? Why would you do something like this? Moving a corpse is...is...is a criminal offence, isn't it?Roly:\n.........Ryunosuke:\n(...Wishing the victim dead should be one, too.)Judge:\nConstable, explain yourself! Why would you do this? As a respected member of Scotland Yard, your duty is to protect the good people of London town!Roly:\n......... I, I can't say...sah.Judge:\nWHAAAT?!Roly:\nI really am ever so sorry about all this. For damaging the Yard's reputation... For...for everything...Ryunosuke:\n......... I have a possible explanation.Van Zieks:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nFor why, on that particular evening... ...Constable Beate felt compelled to move the scene of the crime. I can think of one reason.Van Zieks:\nWhat?! How could you possibly know? You - a foreigner - presuming to understand the mind of a Scotland Yard policeman!Judge:\nAnd yet, Lord van Zieks, it is this foreigner who has uncovered the startling truth of the matter thus far.Van Zieks:\n...!Judge:\nI believe it would be beneficial to the court to hear this extraordinary young lawyer's theory. Counsel for the Defence, if you please...Ryunosuke:\nYes, My Lord!Judge:\nNow then...I think you had better show us some evidence.Ryunosuke:\nAt once, My Lord. (England... Japan... It makes no difference where you come from, human emotions are the same. And I think I have a fairly good idea of the feelings behind this man's actions...)Judge:\nWhat gives away the motive for Constable Beate's unthinkable actions?Present Warrant Card or Anniversary Bouquet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\".........\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nIt's this piece of evidence here! You see?\nJudge:\n...I'm sorry to say that I don't, Counsel.\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nWhat I would like to know, my learned friend... ...is the motive for YOUR unthinkable actions. By which I mean that abysmal response!\nRyunosuke:\nGYAAAAAAGH! (Maybe...I was too unthinking...?)\nSusato:\nEngland... Japan... It makes no difference where you come from, Mr Naruhodo. Human emotions are the same.\nRyunosuke:\nThat's...what I was thinking, yes.\nSusato:\nAnd I think you have a fairly good idea of the feelings behind Constable Beate's actions...don't you?\nRyunosuke:\n...You seem to have a good idea of my own thoughts and feelings, Miss Susato. Perhaps too good an idea!\nSusato:\nWell...I heard you muttering to yourself before, you see...\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then...I think you had better show us some evidence.\"Ryunosuke:\n......... I realise that I'm a foreigner in this land. And I have only just arrived from Japan. Which is why all this information about London's so-called 'bobbies' is completely new to me. I've learnt that, though honourable, 'patrolling the beat is the most demanding work in the world', for example.Judge:\nKeeping the peace, looking after the citizens on his beat in all kinds of ways... There's no doubt that the young bobby is charged with a great deal to do each day, certainly.Ryunosuke:\nBut for Constable Beate, the day in question was special.Judge:\nSpecial? How?Ryunosuke:\nOn account of this bouquet, My Lord.Patricia:\nOh yes! It was our very first wedding anniversary!Van Zieks:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nConstable Beate had worked so hard to be able to afford this simple gift for his wife... ...and was so looking forward to taking her out for a celebratory meal...Van Zieks:\n...When he and Mrs Beate stumbled upon a crime along Briar Road. When he saw that shadowy figure through the fog collapse on the pavement ahead of them... ...what must have gone through the man's mind?Roly:\nBut SAH! Just on that one particular day, I was looking forward to celebrating my wedding anniversary. Mrs Beate puts up with a lot being married to a bobby like me. I wanted to show my dear wife how much I care!Roly:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nThis is the warrant card that Constable Beate offered to lend to me earlier. Inside, among the rules for patrolling policemen, it says... ...'When a crime is discovered on his beat, a policeman must assist with initial investigations and help detectives.'Judge:\nAh ha!Ryunosuke:\nConstable Beate... ...is that or is that not the reason why you moved the whole scene of the crime that day?Roly:\n......... Yes... Everything you said... It's all right...Van Zieks:\n......... So that's it... It was all to do with the boundary of your beat.Patricia:\nOh!Ryunosuke:\nExactly. To summarise... ...the incident actually occurred on Constable Beate's beat.Judge:\nGood gracious! Constable! Do you realise the gravity of what you have done?Roly:\n......... It...was the first time since I became a copper... ...that I'd ever cursed God. 'Stay close to me, Pat! The criminal could still be lurking somewhere!'As we ran over to the scene, I had every intention of doing my duty as a police officer.'We've got to report this to the station as quickly as possible!'...But then it dawned on me. I realised where we were. Where the victim was lying. And what that meant for me.'When a crime is discovered on his beat, a policeman must assist with initial investigations and help detectives.'Why here? Why did this have to happen here? And why tonight of all nights?! ...Why...?It's a copper's job to guard the scene of the crime, so... ...I told Pat she'd have to go to the nearest police box and fetch whoever was on duty there. It was then, when I opened my mouth to speak... It just...came out. I couldn't believe the words that were coming out of my own mouth! 'This is the next beat to mine, Pat. So you'll have to go [sic] the police box that covers it. Turn right along Meerschaum Street, and then... ............ ........ ......' ......... .........I'm...I'm... I'm sorry... I'm...so sorry...Susato:\nOh, Constable...Roly:\nI...I just wanted... Just that one night... To take my Patricia out for dinner.Patricia:\nOh Roly...Roly:\nJust that one night. .........Van Zieks:\nYou knew that if the incident was on your beat, your evening of celebration would be ruined. And so you decided...to move the entire crime scene outside your jurisdiction. Just across the street, to the east pavement of Briar Road... which falls under the neighbouring beat's care.Roly:\n......... You see, I... I thought ...Well, I was sure the victim was dead, you see.Judge:\nI beg your pardon?Patricia:\nOh, of course he did! Otherwise my Roly would never have left the poor woman on the freezing cold pavement!Judge:\n......... Ah, I see your meaning now.Roly:\n......... But God got me back for my sins, didn't He? That's why... That's why I missed the rose I bought for Pat.Patricia:\nOh no, Roly! That was all my fault! I should never have dropped it in such a dark place... I'm so sorry, Roly!Roly:\n.........Ryunosuke:\n......... And can you tell us, Constable... ...how many books did you move from the one side of the road to the other in total?Roly:\nHm? Oh! ...Um... Four, it was. Yes, sah. ...Definitely...four.Susato:\nThree of them dropped by Mr Natsume, and the fourth... ...being the one that fell from the window upstairs in the Garrideb household, of course.Ryunosuke:\nBut...what made you place that book in the victim's hand? When all the others were scattered haphazardly around, I mean.Roly:\nOh, well, sah... That's because that's how I found it.Van Zieks:\n'How you found it'? What do you mean?Roly:\nWhen we first ran over to the scene... ...the victim was already holding the book. So...when I moved everything, I made sure it was still in her hand.Ryunosuke:\nYou're sure it was this book - 'The Lion's Pride' - that the victim was holding?Roly:\nOh yes, sah. No doubt about it...sah...Ryunosuke:\n(Hm...interesting...)The fourth book's information has been updated in the Court Record.Roly:\n......... I thought it was an open-and-shut case at the time, you see. There were only the two people at the scene. And Pat and me both saw it happen. However which way you looked at it, it had to be the fellow who ran off who'd done it...I thought. I couldn't see the harm, really. I didn't think moving it all over the road would make a jot of difference. I... I suppose this is it for me now. I've had it............Van Zieks:\nMy Lord...Judge:\nYes, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks:\nI believe...that concludes the cross-examination of the witnesses.Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nConstable...you may withdraw.Roly:\nYes, SAH!Patricia:\nUm, Mr Prosecutor, sir... ...what will become of my Roly? What will happen to him?Van Zieks:\n......... For now, you are free to go home. The police will contact you in due course.Patricia:\nPlease...don't punish my husband! This, this was all my fault! It's because I'm always moaning at him for coming home late!Roly:\nLeave it now, Pat. ...Let's go home. I'm...tired...Patricia:\n...Alright then, my love.Van Zieks:\nOne last thing, Constable...Roly:\nSah?!Van Zieks:\nLet this be a lesson to you. In a criminal investigation, every detail matters, however insignificant it may seem to you.Roly:\nYes...sah...Van Zieks:\nCarve that lesson in your mind. And never again make the mistake of tampering with the scene of a crime.Roly:\nAh?! N-Never again, sah? You, you mean to say...?Van Zieks:\nLeave. Now. This trial is not yet over.Roly:\nUh...um... SAAAH!Judge:\nWell, quite a startling revelation, I must say. Whoever thought of a third party transplanting the entire scene of a crime like that!Van Zieks:\nIndeed, My Lord. Nevertheless, there are some immutable facts here. Principally... ...that the accused, Mr Soseki Natsume, is the only person who could possibly have committed this crime.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nNo! I disagree. Now that we know the true scene of the incident...there is someone else. Another person who could be responsible for the knife in the victim's back!Susato:\nForgive me for being presumptuous... ...but I believe the prosecution is probably well aware of this possibility already.Judge:\nLord van Zieks! Is this true?Van Zieks:\n......... Very well. Name the person if you will. And if further investigation is warranted... ...the prosecution has no objection to the trial continuing.Judge:\nYou will name this 'other person' who could have perpetrated the crime!Present Joan Garrideb profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The defence would once again like to request the cross-examination of a new witness, My Lord!\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nJudge:\nExcuse me? I'm afraid I was unable to hear you, Counsel. Again, please, and louder this time.\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nVan Zieks:\nI dare say my learned friend's timid tone is a reflection of the confidence he has in his answer.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...\nJudge:\nHmph, so that's what all the sweat is about, is it?\nRyunosuke:\nAAAAAAGH! (We've already managed to establish where the victim actually collapsed. I'm sure that means... ...we must nearly be at the end of the line!)\nJudge:\nCounsel, I say again...\nLeads back to:\n\"You will name this 'other person' who could have perpetrated the crime!\"Ryunosuke:\nThe defence would once again like to request the cross-examination of a new witness, My Lord!Judge:\nOnce again?Ryunosuke:\nMy assistant made the same request earlier. In order to finally reveal the truth about this case... ...it's imperative that we cross-examine juror number four...Mrs Joan Garrideb!Juror No. 4:\nMe? Me?! Oh dearie me!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nThat request has already been denied!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nBut the situation is very different now! Mrs Garrideb, answer me this...Juror No. 4:\nWhat do you want now, you little toad?!Ryunosuke:\nAt the time of the incident, you were engaged in a violent argument with your husband, Mr John Garrideb. In the course of the argument, a minor house fire was ignited... ...and to clear the smoke from the room, your husband opened a window that looks out over Briar Road.Juror No. 4:\nWell, what of it?!Ryunosuke:\nYou threw this book at your husband, when he was cornered with his back against the window. Upon striking the pane of the open top-hinged casement window, the book plummeted directly down... ...finding its way... ...to what we now know to be the true scene of the incident.Juror No. 4:\nYes, and as I said, what of it?Ryunosuke:\nDuring the argument, you were beside yourself with rage. As such, you threw not just books, but anything you could lay your hands on.Juror No. 4:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nSo...let me ask you one more time, Mrs Garrideb... This knife - the one removed from the victim's back... Have you really never laid eyes on it before?Juror No. 4:\nAh... ......... ............ ...I don't recall it.Ryunosuke:\nSeriously...?Juror No. 4:\nAm I supposed to remember everything I picked up and threw at my husband? And anyway, the man over there in all that regalia said members of the jury needn't testify, didn't he?Ryunosuke:\n...Conveniently, yes.Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nNo! I have no recollection of saying that at all...juror number four.Juror No. 4:\nOh!Van Zieks:\nMake no mistake... You jurors are not special in any way. You are not immune to the judicial process. If you know something about this knife, madam...let the truth come out.Juror No. 4:\nBut! But that's just a common-or-garden knife! It could have come from anywhere. We have several like that at home. If, if one went missing... ...how would you expect me to know?!Juror No. 3:\nWhat's that?Juror No. 5:\nAre you joking?Judge:\nWhat are you saying, please, Mrs Garrideb?Now you listen to me!Juror No. 4:\nI, I refuse to believe all this nonsense! I couldn't bear the thought that I'd injured someone. Do you hear? I couldn't bear it!Susato:\nOh, the poor woman...Juror No. 4:\nSo...yes! I want evidence! I want to see hard evidence if you're going to insist on this being my fault! You're going to have to prove to me that I threw that knife if that's what you think. Come along now! Chop chop! ...Do your worst!Ryunosuke:\nUm, well...Susato:\nWell, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke:\nIf, if I had evidence like that, believe me, I would have thrown it at her already!Van Zieks:\nThen take the stand, juror!Juror No. 4:\nOh!Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution does not object to the defence's request to cross-examine this woman.Ryunosuke:\nThank you, Lord van Zieks.Juror No. 4:\nI... I'm going to have to testify?Judge:\nJuror number four... ...as I'm sure you will appreciate, having observed it with your own eyes today... ...witness testimony can lead to the most extraordinary truths being unearthed. Truths of which the witnesses themselves may not even have been aware.Juror No. 4:\nOh dearie me...Judge:\nSo I demand your full and unadulterated testimony, Mrs Garrideb. And mark my words: In this court of law today...we shall extract the truth! Do you concur, Counsels?Van Zieks:\nCertainly, My Lord.Ryunosuke:\nOh! Um... ...That's what I'm hoping for, My Lord! (This is such a strange feeling... For the first time since arriving in this country, it actually feels real. I'm here, in the Old Bailey...and I'm a lawyer!)Van Zieks:\nWitness, state your name and occupation.Joan:\nOh...ah... Yes, my name is Joan Garrideb... ...and I'm...um...well... I'm a juror...and suchlike.Ryunosuke:\n(It sounds like even she doesn't know if she's a housewife or a maid or what any more...)Judge:\nThe court has decided your testimony is required in order to clarify matters in this case. ...Do you understand, madam?Joan:\n...Yes! ...My Lord!Van Zieks:\nYou will tell the court everything that took place in your household on the evening in question. And I warn you... Do not attempt to hide the truth.Joan:\nOh... Oh dearie me...???:\n...Chin up, Joanie. Nothing to worry about now.Joan:\nOh! I didn't know you were here, John!Garrideb:\nWasn't only you in the room that day, old thing, was it? Rather think I ought to testify as well, don't you?Joan:\nBut...but what about your knee, dear?Garrideb:\nDon't you worry about that. Hardly notice it! I'm not the sort of chap to leave a comrade to face disciplinary action alone.Joan:\nOh, John...Judge:\nI presume you are Mr John Garrideb?Garrideb:\nYes, sir! Former second lieutenant of the third regiment of the 4th Northumberland Fusiliers. Sir! Seen my fair share of action and now living the quiet life, as it were.Van Zieks:\n...The quiet life? Were you not engaged in an incendiary battle with your spouse on the day in question?Garrideb:\nAh...well...yes... Ahem! Quite.Judge:\nI believe this may represent a first in the proud history of the British court. Calling a juror to the witness stand is unprecedented. However, the court will hear your testimony now, juror number four, and that of your husband. You will recount clearly and concisely the events in your home at the time of the incident in question.Garrideb:\nSir! At once!Witness Testimony\n- The Battle of Garrideb -Garrideb:\nYes, on the day you're referring to, the wife and I did have a bit of a skirmish. Can't recall the reason now.\nKnocked a candlestick over and set fire to the carpet! Soon had it out, though, and got the window open.Joan:\nMeanwhile...I was picking up whatever I could find to throw at him.Garrideb:\nPlenty of knives around our place. Can't say I'd notice if one or two went missing, I'm afraid.\nIf that bally thing in the victim's back really was one of ours, you'll have a job proving it, I think.Judge:\nHmmm... It sounds as though it was quite the battlefield in your household that evening.Van Zieks:\nAlthough an entirely one-sided assault, it seems.Garrideb:\nThe enemy caught us on the hop, sir. Had no choice but to dig in and take defensive measures. To be honest, if the enemy had kept shelling us for another minute, we'd have been toast. 'Course, a veteran such as myself... ...is only too aware that on every battlefield, you're just a gnat's whisker from death at any moment.Ryunosuke:\n...Are we still talking about a marital quarrel here?Judge:\nWell... ...I must say I'm dubious that this testimony will shed any light on the origins of this jackknife.Van Zieks:\nIn combat, one's focus narrows such that surroundings are barely noticed. These witnesses may not be able to offer anything more than they have testified already. This may be a dead end.Ryunosuke:\n(Van Zieks may well be right.)Susato:\nWell, whatever the chances... ...we only have this last cross-examination to uncover the truth, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke:\nYes...I'm afraid so.Judge:\nVery well, Counsel. Begin your cross-examination!Cross-Examination\n- The Battle of Garrideb -",

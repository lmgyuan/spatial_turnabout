You can't imagine how much I've suffered...\nYou... suffered?\nAnd now... the perfect opportunity presents itself. At last... I shall have my revenge!\nWhat!?\n...Merry Christmas.\nDecember 25, 10:08 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?\nPhoenix:\nWaterfalls...? Dare I ask why?\nMaya:\nDuh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!\nPhoenix:\n... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?\nMaya:\nOf course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...\nMaya:\nOh. Darn.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?\nMaya:\n... Good idea!\nPhoenix:\n(So much for the rushing spring waters...)\nTV:\nNext in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it \"Gourdy\" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ...\nPhoenix:\n*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?\nMaya:\nNick?\nPhoenix:\n?\nMaya:\nThe water pressure's kind of low in that shower.\nPhoenix:\n... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?\nMaya:\n... Good idea, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) (Changed from [Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...] in the original release)\nTV:\nWe interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder!\nPhoenix:\n(Gourd Lake again?)\nTV:\nThe body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away?\nPhoenix:\n(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--\nMaya:\nNick?\nPhoenix:\nYipes! M-Maya!\nMaya:\nThe fireman yelled at me when I called him.\nPhoenix:\nWe've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!\nMaya:\nWhat? You mean, the prosecutor?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!\nMaya:\nWhaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?\nPhoenix:\nI-I don't know!\nMaya:\nLet's go find out, Nick!\nExamine\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.\nCharley the plant\nPhoenix:\nMia's favorite plant. Its name is \"Charley.\" Maya's gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley's been perking up these days.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMia's desk. If we had more clients, I would probably sit here more often. Lately, I've been spending more time on the couch, watching TV.\nMovie poster\nPhoenix:\nMaya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day. We had a big fight over whether to put it up or not. I know she's just waiting for a chance to sneak it up on the wall.\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. I can see the bellboy, getting the angle of that screwdriver in the drawer just right.\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean!? Let's investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(You're right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!)\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nWell? Got any good ideas?\nMaya:\nNot really. I do my best thinking when I'm standing underneath a waterfall.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I think it's developing a nice luster.\nMaya:\nI'll look at your badge later, Nick. We've got work to do!\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose you're right...)\nDecember 25Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nYou know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?\nPhoenix:\nI guess it comes with the territory.\nMaya:\nI'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!\nPhoenix:\n... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you doing here!?\nMaya:\nNick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.\nPhoenix:\nWell, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?\nMaya:\nNick... Should we be laughing?\nPhoenix:\nNah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.\nEdgeworth:\n... Yes you do.\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, he's right.)\nEdgeworth:\n... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't want to see you like this, either. Believe me.) (Changed from [Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.] in the original release)\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile for the camera...\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth. Tell me what happened.\nEdgeworth:\n... Why should I? What are you going to do about it?\nMaya:\nDuh! We're going to help you, that's what!\nEdgeworth:\n...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous.\nPhoenix:\nSorry...?\nEdgeworth:\nYou're a novice! You've only been in three trials!\nPhoenix:\nH-hey!\nEdgeworth:\nSure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nNick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!?\nGourd Lake\nPhoenix:\nThe murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... late last night.\nPhoenix:\nThe lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there?\nEdgeworth:\n... I see no need to tell you.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...?\nEdgeworth:\n... Gourdy.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nI went to see Gourdy.\nMaya:\n\"Gourdy\"? What's that!?\nPhoenix:\nI'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?)\nDid you do it (appears after \"What happened\", \"Gourd Lake\", and presenting Attorney's Badge)\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right?\nEdgeworth:\n... Think what you will. I have only one request.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nStay out of this case.\nMaya:\nWhy!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!\nEdgeworth:\nI know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay?\nMaya:\n!!! Why not?\nEdgeworth:\n... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!\nMaya:\nNick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he.\nPhoenix:\nMaya! Let's go investigate elsewhere.\nMaya:\nBut, Nick...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nEdgeworth:\nYour attorney's badge...?\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth. Let me defend you.\nEdgeworth:\n... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet.\nMaya:\nWh-what do you mean by that?\nEdgeworth:\nMe? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!\nMaya:\nWh-what!?\nEdgeworth:\nMy case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nEdgeworth:\nSimply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared \"guilty.\"\nPhoenix:\nI don't believe it!\nEdgeworth:\nRegardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this.\nDecember 25Gourd Lake ParkEntrance\nMaya:\nThis is where it happened?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.\nMaya:\nI can see some police walking around in there.\nPhoenix:\nQuestioning people, probably.\nMaya:\nHey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?\nPolice:\nS-sorry, sir... Nothing.\nGumshoe:\nIdiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!\nPolice:\nB-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--\nGumshoe:\nShaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... I'll... I'll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal! (Changed from [I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!] in the original release)\nPolice:\nY-yes, sir!\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!\nGumshoe:\nRecruits... peh! ... Aah!\nMaya:\nEek!\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!\nPhoenix:\nWright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!\nMaya:\nHe seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...\nExamine\nTrees\nPhoenix:\nI feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?\nMaya:\nI don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.\nPhoenix:\n(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)\nSign\nPhoenix:\nThe sign says \"Gourd Lake Nature Park.\" This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend.\nMaya:\nBut... no waterfall.\nPhoenix:\nNot many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? You don't know, pal?\nPhoenix:\nNo...\nGumshoe:\nWow, okay, Mr. Head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nHead-in-the... huh?\nGumshoe:\nNever mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol.\nMaya:\nAnd... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?\nGumshoe:\nA cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.\nMaya:\nHow did they get there so fast? (Changed from [How did he get there so fast?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake.\nPhoenix:\nA witness?\nEdgeworth\nMaya:\nYou don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer, do you!? (Changed from [You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAbsolutely not! It's impossible! I don't care if there's a witness either! I don't believe a lick of it!\nMaya:\nR-right! Who cares what the witness says!\nPhoenix:\n(I care!)\nMaya:\n... You really believe in him, don't you, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nCourse I do! But... the police are pretty sure he's the killer. Nobody's even really taking this investigation that seriously.\nMaya:\nOh no!\nGumshoe:\nAfter all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one's standing up to take his side.\nMaya:\nWell, at least you are, Detective. At least you are.\nDefense request\nMaya:\nDo you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth's defense attorney in tomorrow's trial?\nGumshoe:\nHe hasn't got one yet.\nMaya:\nWhat? The trial IS tomorrow, isn't it?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I don't know the whole story... But apparently no one he's been talking to will take his case.\nMaya:\nW-why not?\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth won't tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he'd asked you to defend him.\nPhoenix:\nU-unfortunately not...\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn't just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you're an attorney!\nDefense request (after presenting Attorney's Badge in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)\nMaya:\nI-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case?\nGumshoe:\nYeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid.\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)\nGumshoe:\nHey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai case? (Changed from [Remember the Steel Samurai!] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!\nPhoenix:\nI... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said.\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after that trial! (Changed from [You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case!] in the original release) He kept saying \"Wright, Wright, Wright,\" over and over.\nMaya:\n... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign.\nPhoenix:\nNeither am I...\nGumshoe:\nWhy wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it.\nThe witness (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nWho was this witness?\nGumshoe:\nEr, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nWas there only that one witness?\nGumshoe:\nYep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty...\nMaya:\nOh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nTalk to Santa.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nGumshoe:\nThat badge! You're showing that to the wrong guy, pal! You gotta show that to someone who needs it!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPolice:\nDetective Gumshoe, sir!\nGumshoe:\nWhat? Find something!?\nPolice:\nUm, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing...\nGumshoe:\nA briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?\nThe autopsy report\nMaya:\nWell, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...?\nGumshoe:\nSorry... They haven't worked up the autopsy report yet. I'm still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal!\nLeads to:\n\"You're not coming back, Detective?\"\nHow to get in touch with you\nLeads to:\n\"You're not coming back, Detective?\"\nPhoenix:\nYou're not coming back, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nErm... Probably not, pal.\nPhoenix:\nSo, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.\nDetective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station.\nPhoenix:\nOh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nW-what!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.\nMaya:\nYou know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...\nMaya:\nRight! Now, let's get investigating!\nDecember 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nMaya:\n... Looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here.\nChief:\nSomething wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in? Okay, what did you do? Shoplifting? Larceny? Public indecency...?\nMaya:\nN-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around?\nChief:\nGumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon.\nMaya:\nOkay, we'll come back.\nChief:\nYou do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that?\nMaya:\n... Do I look like a criminal or something?\nExamine\nPoster\nPhoenix:\nA poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad.\nDetective\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nPolice:\n\"...your mama could see you know she'd be crying'... ...a break and spit it out, you lowlife scumbag...\"\nPhoenix:\n... He must be doing image training for interrogations.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nThese are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.\nBlue Badger\nPhoenix:\nHey, is that the police department's mascot...?\nChief:\nThat's the \"Blue Badger\"! It was my idea! I made it! It's my mascot!\nPhoenix:\nI... see. How nice.\nChief:\nI'll get him assigned mascot of the Criminal Affairs Dept. if it's the last thing I do!\nPhoenix:\nUm, good luck!\nChief\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.\nChief:\nWha...!? \"Gourd Lake...!\" \"Gourdy sighted\"!!! I don't believe it!\nPhoenix:\n(Shouldn't you be reading something more important...?)\nDecember 25Gourd LakePublic Beach\nMaya:\nWowsers! This is \"Gourd Lake\"?\nPhoenix:\nYup. I'm not sure it warrants a \"wowsers,\" though.\nMaya:\nHmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!\nPhoenix:\n\"Samurai Dogs\"...?\nMaya:\nI wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great!\nPhoenix:\nWith a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?\nMaya:\nThey're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into \"The Pink Princess\" now. I mean, like, y'know!?\nPhoenix:\n(Nope.)\nExamine\nLake\nMaya:\nWow. Gourd Lake is really big.\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nMaya:\nSay, Nick. Why is it called \"Gourd Lake\"?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here.\nMaya:\nWhoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it is shaped like a gourd, actually. But that's just a coincidence.\nMaya:\nOh. Okay.\nTrash can\nPhoenix:\nThe trashcan is empty. At least the place is well maintained.\nBench\nPhoenix:\nA lineup of plastic benches. I guess the idea is you buy a dog and eat it here. I doubt anyone would sit here and eat on a day like this. Except maybe Maya... if she had a Samurai Dog.\nSign\nPhoenix:\nHuh... I almost didn't see that signpost. \"Left - Boat docks\" \"Right - Exit\"\nVendor stand\nPhoenix:\nA hotdog stand. It's closed... The Christmas fringe looks a little half-baked. The banner reads \"Samurai Dogs\"... Somebody needs to redecorate.\nPopper\nMaya:\nHuh. Someone left some poppers here. You know, you pull the string... (Changed from [Huh. Someone left one of those poppers here. You know, you pull the string...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...And it goes \"pop.\" Yeah, I know the ones. You see them a lot around New Year's.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! They might be a clue! (Changed from [Hey, Nick! It might be a clue!] in the original release) Let's take them. (Changed from [Let's take it.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nC'mon, admit it. You just want to pop them, right? (Changed from [C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop it, right?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWas it that obvious?\nPhoenix:\n(Poppers... hmm.) (Changed from [A popper... hmm.] in the original release)\nTake them (Changed from [Take it] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI suppose it couldn't hurt. Huh? Where'd they go? (Changed from [Huh? Where'd it go?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nInto my pocket. (Changed from [I already put it in my pocket.] in the original release)\nPoppers put in pocket. (Changed from [Popper put in pocket.] in the original release)\nLeads back to examination\nLeave them (Changed from [Leave it] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nNah, let's leave them. (Changed from [Nah, let's leave it.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nAww, listen to your inner child a little, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe if you outer child would be quiet for just a moment, Maya!)\nLeads back to examination\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nAnything else\nMaya:\nNick! If we don't hurry Mr. Edgeworth will get the death sentence!!!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa! O-okay! Let's go check things out.\nDetention Center\nPresent\nAnything else\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's that? I'm not in the mood for idle banter, Wright.\nDecember 25Boat Rental Shop\nMaya:\nNick... what is this place?\nPhoenix:\nA boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either.\nMaya:\nBoats... I've never ridden on a boat.\nPhoenix:\nReally? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished?\nMaya:\nHey, good idea! You bet!\nExamine\nTrees\nPhoenix:\nThere's more forest off that way. I doubt I'd find any helpful clues in there.\nShop\nPhoenix:\nA small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because it's Christmas.\nBoats\nPhoenix:\nThere are some boats floating at the dock. Was one of these boats used in the murder, I wonder?\nMaya:\nNick?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nI changed my mind. I don't really want to go for a boat ride.\nDecember 25Gourd Lake Woods\nMaya:\nI like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping!\nPhoenix:\nThey've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder.\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder!\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them.\nExamine\nCamera\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. Check out this camera!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... what's with the big mic and that box on top, I wonder? It looks like some sort of automatic system for taking a photo when a noise is heard.\nMaya:\nWow! Hey, let's see if it works! *cough* \"Hi, I'm Nick!\" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. \"YO! I'M NICK!!!\" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nWill you stop that?\nMaya:\nI think it's broken, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nD-don't kick it! (It must not be set up to respond to voices.)\nCamera (after Popper is added to the Court Record)\nLeads to:\n\"This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment.\"\nTrees\nPhoenix:\nThe trees grow quite thick here. Further back, the trees fade into the shadow where the sunlight can't reach them.\nSign\nPhoenix:\nThe sign says \"No Camping.\" Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.\nMaya:\nWait, what if the sign said \"No Setting Tents on Fire\"?\nPhoenix:\n... I don't think they have signs like that.\nMaya:\nOh...\nSheet\nPhoenix:\nThere's food and some magazines on the sheet. It takes a pretty tough skin to camp in this cold.\nCampfire\nMaya:\nHey, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat, don't tell me you're hungry again?\nMaya:\nNo, no. I was just wondering, why are camping pots and pans made of aluminum?\nPhoenix:\n... They didn't talk about that in any of the law books.\nMaya:\nSo, there's no law saying they have to be made out of aluminum, then!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not having this conversation...)\nSUV\nPhoenix:\nThis SUV has seen better days. It's dented all over. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.\nPhoenix:\nThis camera has a mic and some sort of attachment. It must take pictures when triggered by a noise.\nMaya:\nWow! Cool! Let's try it out! *cough* \"Hi, I'm Nick!\" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. \"HEY! I'M NICK!!!\" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nWill you stop that?\nMaya:\nMaybe it's broken?\nPhoenix:\nD-don't kick it! Maybe it isn't set up to respond to voices?\nMaya:\nWell what then? These things? (Changed from [Well what then? I know!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThe party poppers...? (Changed from [The party popper...?] in the original release)\n*BANG*\nklik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik\nMaya:\n... Well. It responded. (Changed from [... Yep. It responded.] in the original release)\n???:\nYaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw! Hey, you! Git yer hands offa' that!\nMaya:\nEek!\n???:\nWhat in the Sam Hill...!? Look what ya done now! There goes a whole roll of film!\nMaya:\nAh? Wha... huh? S-sorry!\n???:\nSorry's nice but it don't pay my bills! Y'all know how much a roll of that film costs!?\nMaya:\nI-I'll pay you back!\n???:\nWhat were ya'll thinkin' settin' off a party-popper in a place like this?\nMaya:\nUh... well...\n???:\nWhat! Don't try to play stupid with me just 'cause you think I'm some country bumpkin! Yeah, I know how y'all Yanks think! \"I say, those southern folks talk with that exaggerated drawl, why they must be dumb!\" Well let me tell you, just because I might be dumb don't mean we all are!\nMaya:\nN-Nick, help!\n???:\nAnd who are you, now? Her chaperone?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, uh, no, rather, uhh... we're sort of... friends?\n???:\nJus' figure out what y'all are gonna say and say it for bejeezum's sake! Gawd, I'd rather sit through one of papa's drawls than listen to you stutter all day.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy... I guess we should pay her for the film...)\n???:\nWatch it!\nPhoenix:\nYes ma'am. (On second thought, I'll pay later...)\nMaya:\nI'm really sorry!\nExamine\nCamera\nPhoenix:\nThis camera is rigged to respond to noise. But it only responds to loud noises... like a party popper.\nTalk\nAny option\nPhoenix:\nUmmm...\n???:\nWhat!? Can't ya see I'm changin' the film on my camera here! Someone--I'm not namin' any names--but someone used up a WHOLE ROLL.\nMaya:\nSorry...\nPhoenix:\n(That didn't work... I wonder if I have anything to show her that would get her attention...)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nLeads to:\n\"I, er, this is my badge.\"\nPhoenix:\nI, er, this is my badge.\n???:\nHuh? Aren't badges supposed t' be all shiny and impressive? You a cop or something?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I'm a lawyer.\n???:\nWh-what!? Y'all ain't gonna try and pull one o' them lawsuits on me over that film now? Cause I'll have you know I'm a fighter and I wrassled meaner looking' things'n you!\nPhoenix:\nN-no, that's not it at all.

Now wouldn't a gunshot make a similar noise to our party popper...?\nLotta:\nI guess it would.\nPhoenix:\nYour camera... didn't get a picture of the murder, did it?\nLotta:\n... Hey! Y'all are pretty bright!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nLotta:\nI see what yer sayin'... Tell ya what, I'll have a look-see at my film.\nPhoenix:\nIt would have been a photo taken late last night...\nLotta:\nI checked 'em once, don't remember if there was anything on 'em though.

For better or for worse...\nPhoenix:\n(I get the feeling we're in for some bad news...)\nExamine\nDetective\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives.

You're a lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nT-true...\nGumshoe:\n... Y'know... I don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, Mr. Edgeworth's human like you or me. Still... I get the feeling that if he'd done something wrong, he wouldn't go hiding it. That's just the kind of guy he is. Why can't anyone else see that?\nMaya:\nSo, they think that Mr. Edgeworth did it...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, the trial's starting tomorrow, as scheduled.\nMaya:\nI see...\nGumshoe:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... hey, in the end you did tell us about the meeting!\nGumshoe:\n... Don't go telling anyone else, pal.\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, sir!\nGumshoe:\nAnd... do me a favor! Stand by Mr. Edgeworth! He needs help, and you're the ones to help him! I'm sure he's got some reason why he won't talk to us.\nMaya:\nThanks, Detective Gumshoe.\nTrusting Edgeworth (appears after \"The meeting\")\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe... How come you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'd think that was obvious. We got a strong working relationship, us two. We trust each other, and that's how it works.\nMaya:\nA \"working relationship\"?\nGumshoe:\nSee, Mr. Edgeworth always gets his defendants declared \"guilty\" every time. Yeah, his methods might be a little extreme at times. But... there's a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That's why I work extra hard, pal. We've got to earn that trust he places in us.\nMaya:\nI see...\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth is a man you can trust...

I met him once when I went there to hang out with Sis!\nPhoenix:\nThat office...? Wait! You mean Grossberg's office?\nMaya:\nRight! That guy!\nPhoenix:\n(That was the last name I expected to come up... Maybe I should go talk to him... for old time's sake.)\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nHmm... The police have pretty much made up their minds that Mr. Edgeworth did it. And Mr. Edgeworth won't tell us anything. I guess we could go look for clues down by the lake?\nPhoenix:\nRight.\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nWell? Penny for your thoughts?\nMaya:\nThoughts... Thoughts... Yeah, why won't Mr. Edgeworth tell us anything? And... and... And why did he refuse to ask for our help? What a jerk!\nPresent\nAutopsy Report\nMaya:\nNick...

Mr. Grossberg is out as usual.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. Look at the wall.\nPhoenix:\n(That painting is still missing... Mia must have known about the deal with Mr. Grossberg and Redd White... She kept track of all of White's extortion and blackmail rackets.)\nExamine\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nExpensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.\nMaya:\nWell then let's take them back to our office! He won't miss them!\nPhoenix:\nUh, we don't need them.\nMaya:\nThen, can we take that wooden bear?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. It is kind of cute.)\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nA solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! I want a desk like that in our office too!\nPhoenix:\nI don't know. I don't think I'm ready to sit at a desk like that yet.\nMaya:\nHuh? I meant for me!\nPhoenix:\nYou'd better start saving your allowance, then.\nVacant wall\nMaya:\nWhy is the wall there a different color?\nPhoenix:\nA big painting was hanging there until recently.\nMaya:\nHuh. What happened to it?\nPhoenix:\nUh... well, he gave it to someone.\nMaya:\nI bet he gave it to some romantic interest! Love blooms eternal, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUh... yeah.\nPotted plant\nPhoenix:\nAn expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.\nMaya:\nI think our Charley is cuter.\nPhoenix:\nRight. He's a really cute... plant.\nTable\nPhoenix:\nA table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.\nMaya:\nWe should put things on our client table too.\nPhoenix:\nI'm not really into smoking.\nMaya:\nWe could put out candy, or gum.\nPhoenix:\nClassy...\nDetention Center\nPresent\nAutopsy Report\nEdgeworth:\n...

Edgey's got a proboscis on his knee!?\nMaya:\nNo, no--he's a \"prosecuting attorney.\" That's like the total opposite of a defense lawyer!\nButz:\n... Huh. Go figure! He always used to talk about defending the \"weak\" who were \"unable to defend themselves.\" Man, he used to go on and on about man's duty to society and all that. What a bore!

I feel as though I've seen this man somewhere before! ... Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nDid you remember!?\nGrossberg:\nHe was a lawyer! Here, in my office! That's Hammond! Robert Hammond!\nMaya:\nMr. Hammond...?\nGrossberg:\nAnd you say this is the man Miles Edgeworth shot?\nLake Photo\nGrossberg:\nSo this is the moment the crime took place, eh?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nGrossberg:\nYou can't really say for sure that's Edgeworth. I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Not sure at all...\nMisty Fey's Photo\nGrossberg:\nMisty Fey. Mother of Mia and Maya Fey. Show this photograph to Miles Edgeworth. He'll have something to say to you then.\nAnything else\nGrossberg:\nEr... my apologies. I'm not sure I can help you with that.\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nMisty Fey's Photo\nMaya:\nMy mother... ...\nPhoenix:\n(Now that I've shown her the picture, I can't think of anything to say... That probably wasn't the best thing to do.)\nDecember 25Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's this? I was hoping you'd gotten my message the first time.\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth, what about your defense?\nEdgeworth:\n...! It's no concern of yours.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess he hasn't found anyone yet.)\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nCan I ask you about the murder?\nEdgeworth:\nWright. I'll ask you again, just leave me alone.\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nPlease try to understand. I'm not doing this to prove I'm tough, or because I look down on you. I just don't want you anywhere near this case. Understand?\nGourd Lake\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you go to Gourd Lake?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no intention of telling you.\nPhoenix:\nNor, apparently, would you tell Detective Gumshoe.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe was really worried about you!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nThe DL-6 Incident (appears after presenting Misty Fey's Photo)\nEdgeworth:\nThe \"DL-6 Incident\"... was when my father died. Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all.\nMaya:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nMy memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it's a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It's pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect's name.\nPhoenix:\nAnd Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder?\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect.\nMaya:\nUmm... That spirit medium... that was my mom.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat? You mean you're...? ... It's strange. I thought that terrible incident was about to end, and now... this.\nPhoenix:\n\"About to end\"?\nEdgeworth:\nThe DL-6 Incident happened 15 years ago. 15 years ago... on December 28.\nMaya:\nDecember 28?\nEdgeworth:\nThe statute of limitations on the case runs out in three days.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nMaya:\nUm, Nick? What does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nWhen a case's statute of limitations runs out, legally, the case never happened.\nEdgeworth:\nThree days from now, DL-6 will be closed... forever.\nThe suspect (appears after \"The DL-6 Incident\")\nMaya:\nWhat happened to the suspect? The one who got off innocent?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he's still alive, he'd be about 50 years old now.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I can understand why he'd go into hiding... It'd be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.)\nYour father (appears after \"The DL-6 Incident\")\nMaya:\nUmm... so, was your father a lawyer?\nEdgeworth:\nHe was... Gregory Edgeworth. He was quite famous at the time, apparently.\nMaya:\nSo, you were sort of trying to follow in his footsteps.\nEdgeworth:\n... I'd rather not talk about it.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nEdgeworth:\nYour attorney's badge...? I can't say I really want to see one of those right now.\nMisty Fey's Photo\nEdgeworth:\n...! ...\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's only been a matter of hours since you last visited. Yet you've made incredible progress in your investigation. I'll admit it, I'm impressed, Wright. You were always single-minded in your work, though. Once you start on something, you always see it through, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the \"DL-6 Incident\"...\nEdgeworth:\nRight... DL-6. I didn't want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I'm sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren't up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6.\nPhoenix:\nSo... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know. But... I see no point in hiding anything from you now. Very well. Ask whatever you like, and I will answer to the best of my abilities.\nRemoves \"What happened\" and \"Gourd Lake\" Talk options, adds \"The DL-6 Incident\" Talk option\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Lake Photo:\nEdgeworth:\n... Wright.\nPhoenix:\n?\nEdgeworth:\nIt pains me to ask you this now...\nMaya:\nI know! You want us to defend you!\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Will you?\nOf course we will\nPhoenix:\nAh, who could have guessed this day would come?\nEdgeworth:\nNot me.\nLeads to:\n\"This is my chance to finally pay you back.\"\nOf course we won't\nPhoenix:\nSorry, charley! No way!\nEdgeworth:\nWright...\nMaya:\nNick...!? ...\nPhoenix:\nH-hey, don't look so serious, guys! I was kidding! Just a little joke!\nEdgeworth:\nThere was nothing little...\nMaya:\n...or joke-like about it!\nPhoenix:\n(I thought it was funny...)\nMaya:\nNick! Do it over!\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. How could I refuse you, Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, Wright.\nLeads to:\n\"This is my chance to finally pay you back.\"\nPhoenix:\nThis is my chance to finally pay you back.\nMaya:\nPay him back...?\nEdgeworth:\nPay me back? For what? I don't remember ever doing anything for you.\nPhoenix:\nNever mind... I guess you don't really need to know.\nEdgeworth:\nHuh... My letter of request. Please give it to Detective Gumshoe.\nEdgeworth's Request put in pocket.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess we should... ... W-what's that!?\nMaya:\nE-earthquake! Nick! It's a big one! Whaaaaa! I-it's calming down... ... Whew... that was scary!\nPhoenix:\n...? Huh? Where's Edgeworth?\nMaya:\n... There. He's on the floor in a ball, shivering. I guess he doesn't do so well with earthquakes.\nPhoenix:\n(I've heard of running, but curling up in a ball?)\nMaya:\nWell, I guess we're done. Mr. Edgeworth doesn't seem like he's going to stand up any time soon. Let's go, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nUh.. right. We have to give Edgeworth's letter of request to Detective Gumshoe.\nExamine\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro.\nAfter Edgeworth's Request is added to the Court Record:\nDecember 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nGumshoe:\nWhat's going on here!?\nMaya:\nEek!\nPhoenix:\nW-what's wrong, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThis wild lady comes in here just a while ago... Says she came \"to talk to y'all after hearing what Mr. Wright had to say\"! What's this all about, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta Hart...)\nGumshoe:\nWhy are you going around finding more witnesses!? You want to give Mr. Edgeworth the death sentence, pal!?\nPhoenix:\nN-no, not at all... Just... I mean, she did see something. There's nothing I can do about that. I can't go around covering up evidence!\nGumshoe:\nEr... You trying to say something about the way I do my job?\nPhoenix:\nNo sir!\nExamine\nDetective\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nPolice:\n\"Never talk to people in the neighborhood... Turn all the lights in the room off, and close the curtains...\"\nPhoenix:\n... He must be doing image training for a stake-out.\nTalk\nLotta's testimony\nPhoenix:\nSo... what did Ms. Hart say?\nGumshoe:\nShe says she saw Mr. Edgeworth fire the pistol.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nShe even had a photograph to prove it.\nPhoenix:\nRight. I saw it too... But you really can't tell from the photo who it is shooting.\nGumshoe:\nThat's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said \"it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!\"\nMaya:\nShe can do that!?\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, so there's going to be an enlarged photograph that shows Edgeworth in the act. Great. Just great.)\nGumshoe:\nIn any case, she's going to be the one testifying tomorrow.\nMaya:\nHuh? What happened to the other witness?\nGumshoe:\nWell... Apparently, there was a cancellation.\nPhoenix:\n(A \"cancellation\"...!?)\nTomorrow's trial\nGumshoe:\nI'm afraid tomorrow is going to be life or death for poor Mr. Edgeworth. We got a witness who says she saw the very moment of the murder. And we got a photo taken when the shot rang out.\nPhoenix:\n(I'd say that sounds like a pretty unwinnable case... But wait... What did Mia used to say? If he's innocent, there's got to be something I've overlooked...)\nEdgeworth\nGumshoe:\nIt sound like Mr. Edgeworth is going to ask the state to assign a public defender. I was just asked to file the paperwork. But you still got time, pal! Go talk to him again, for me, please! You have to convince him! You have to make him let you defend him! Please! I know you're the only one who can do it, pal. You're the only one who can save Mr. Edgeworth!\nPresent\nEdgeworth's Request\nLeads to:\n\"Look what I got.\"\nAnything else\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal, there's only one thing I want to see from you! And that's a letter of request from Mr. Edgeworth for you to be his defense attorney!\nPhoenix:\nLook what I got.\nGumshoe:\n... Hey, you did it, pal! Glad I waited till the last minute to file those papers! I'll rip 'em up and start new ones for you!\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Detective. Well, see you in court tomorrow, then.\nGumshoe:\nGood luck, pal. Hey! You guys feel that earthquake a little while back? I was worried!\nMaya:\nWorried? We're fine! I've lived out here my whole life. I'm pretty used to them by now.\nGumshoe:\nOh, I wasn't worried about you two. I was worried about Mr. Edgeworth!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, right...) He did seem to over-react a little, now that you mention it.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, well, I'm not surprised. It was a pretty big quake. I'm going to go check on him. You two go eat and get your rest for tomorrow's trial. Later!\nMaya:\n... I wonder what it is with Mr. Edgeworth and earthquakes?\nPhoenix:\nI wonder... He was never that scared of them when he was in school.\nPhoenix:\n(Then again, I only really got to know him in 4th grade. (Changed from [Then again, I was only in the same class as him for 4th grade.] in the original release) He transferred to another school after that. I wonder what happened to Edgeworth...)\nTo be continued.\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.",

(ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThat's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!Maya:\nNot a single case?Edgeworth:\nHe'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.Phoenix:\nHmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.Phoenix:\n(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)Edgeworth:\nHe taught me what it really means to \"prosecute.\"Phoenix:\nWh-what!?Edgeworth:\nJust picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.Maya:\nUgh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nSomething like that...Maya:\nAnd now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.Edgeworth:\nNot a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!Maya:\nThat's pretty ruthless...Edgeworth:\nLike I said. He's a god among prosecutors.Phoenix:\n(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?Maya:\nUh huh?Phoenix:\nWe could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?Maya:\nOh...Phoenix:\n?Maya:\nI can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.Phoenix:\nYou couldn't \"reach\"?Maya:\nI think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...Phoenix:\nOh man, what bad timing!Maya:\nI'm really sorry. I'll try my best!Phoenix:\nI hope so!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you whispering about?Phoenix:\nO-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:\n...Judge:\nErr, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?Karma:\n... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?Judge:\nR-right, my apologies!Phoenix:\n(He's even got the Judge scared!)Judge:\nVery well, your opening statement, please.Karma:\n... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?Judge:\nAh... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.Maya:\nWhat's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?Phoenix:\nHow am I supposed to fight against this!?Karma:\nI call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.Phoenix:\n(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)Karma:\nDescribe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:\nY-yessir!Phoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:\nEr, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:\nHmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:\nTestify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:\nW-w-wait!

(ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThat's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!Maya:\nNot a single case?Edgeworth:\nHe'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.Phoenix:\nHmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.Phoenix:\n(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)Edgeworth:\nHe taught me what it really means to \"prosecute.\"Phoenix:\nWh-what!?Edgeworth:\nJust picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.Maya:\nUgh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nSomething like that...Maya:\nAnd now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.Edgeworth:\nNot a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!Maya:\nThat's pretty ruthless...Edgeworth:\nLike I said. He's a god among prosecutors.Phoenix:\n(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?Maya:\nUh huh?Phoenix:\nWe could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?Maya:\nOh...Phoenix:\n?Maya:\nI can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.Phoenix:\nYou couldn't \"reach\"?Maya:\nI think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...Phoenix:\nOh man, what bad timing!Maya:\nI'm really sorry. I'll try my best!Phoenix:\nI hope so!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you whispering about?Phoenix:\nO-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:\n...Judge:\nErr, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?Karma:\n... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?Judge:\nR-right, my apologies!Phoenix:\n(He's even got the Judge scared!)Judge:\nVery well, your opening statement, please.Karma:\n... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?Judge:\nAh... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.Maya:\nWhat's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?Phoenix:\nHow am I supposed to fight against this!?Karma:\nI call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.Phoenix:\n(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)Karma:\nDescribe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:\nY-yessir!Phoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:\nEr, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:\nHmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:\nTestify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:\nW-w-wait!

He's glaring at me!Karma:\nTsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:\nEh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the \"fingerprints\" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these \"ballistic fingerprints\" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.Karma:\nIndeed.

Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nUh... hmm...Phoenix:\nAnd that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!Edgeworth:\nTrue...Phoenix:\nWas that you in the boat?Edgeworth:\n... Yes. It was me.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nBut... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.Phoenix:\nTh-then who did!?Edgeworth:\nI... don't know.Phoenix:\nYou don't know!? Weren't you right there!?Edgeworth:\n... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!Phoenix:\nY-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:\n... That's the only explanation I can come up with.Phoenix:\nHuh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?Maya:\nHuh? Wh-what?Phoenix:\nAny progress with Mia?Maya:\nOh... Sorry. It's no good.Phoenix:\nUgh...Maya:\nI know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?No, I need you here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, of course not, I need you here!

Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?Karma:\nLotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?Lotta:\nThat I am.Karma:\nGood. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?Lotta:\n... Y'all need to learn some manners.Karma:\nUNDERSTAND?Lotta:\nY-yeah, I understand, I understand!Judge:\nEr... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nI was in my car.\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nThen there was another \"bang\"...\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:\nEnough.Lotta:\nHuh?Karma:\nJudge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:\nW-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:\nAs the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:\n... Well, Judge?Judge:\nThe evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nW-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:\nA cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:\n...!Karma:\nVery well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:\nUh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:\n\"Contempt of court,\" you know?Maya:\nI... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?I think there was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... think I noticed one little thing...\nMaya:\nWow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on!\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...)\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"I think there wasn't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHonestly, I found nothing.\nMaya:\nI dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!\nPhoenix:\nI bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.\nMaya:\nBut... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will...\nPhoenix:\nHe'll bang down that \"flimsy gavel\" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.\nMaya:\nI guess we'll just have to bluff it.\nPhoenix:\nBut if we mess up... contempt of court.\nMaya:\nHey, if we lose we'll be held in public contempt!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right.\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"Phoenix:\nI understand... I will cross-examine the witness!Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk...

From what I saw, he looked pretty relaxed. Not like a murderer at all, really.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court requires the facts, NOT your opinion! How many years have you been on the force!? Facts only, Detective! Hard, cold, objective facts!\nGumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!\nPhoenix:\n(Man, he's got his share of objections...)Gumshoe:\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you think he was suspicious?\nGumshoe:\nYou should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court isn't interested in your musings! \"Deep\"? \"Trusting\"? Poppycock!

Now!Gumshoe:\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.\nKarma:\nJudge! Here's the bullet... It didn't strike bone, so its shape is well preserved.\nJudge:\nVery well. The court accepts this bullet into evidence.\nPistol Bullet added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body.

His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.Maya:\nWhat do we do?Phoenix:\nGrit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?Maya:\nWell said, Nick! You're the man!After pressing fifth statement and pressing modified sixth statement:Karma:\nMembers of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!Karma:\nWas the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:\nYes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:\nHmm...Maya:\nHey, Nick! What does he mean, \"ballistic markings\"?Karma:\nShocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:\nN-Nick! He's glaring at me!Karma:\nTsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:\nEh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the \"fingerprints\" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these \"ballistic fingerprints\" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.Karma:\nIndeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!Judge:\nO-order! Order!Phoenix:\n(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)Karma:\nWell, Judge?Judge:\nI'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:\nYou wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!Judge:\nY-yes?Karma:\nWhat are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!Judge:\nB-but, wait, I...Karma:\nJust bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!Judge:\nY-yes! Ahem.

Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nUh... hmm...Phoenix:\nAnd that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!Edgeworth:\nTrue...Phoenix:\nWas that you in the boat?Edgeworth:\n... Yes. It was me.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nBut... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.Phoenix:\nTh-then who did!?Edgeworth:\nI... don't know.Phoenix:\nYou don't know!? Weren't you right there!?Edgeworth:\n... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!Phoenix:\nY-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:\n... That's the only explanation I can come up with.Phoenix:\nHuh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?Maya:\nHuh? Wh-what?Phoenix:\nAny progress with Mia?Maya:\nOh... Sorry. It's no good.Phoenix:\nUgh...Maya:\nI know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?No, I need you here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, of course not, I need you here! I can see you're always trying to help out. Even if you don't actually help... it's the thought that counts, right?\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick, you don't have to make me feel better.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Yeah, you're useless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, actually... (You don't know law, you don't have any trial experience or techniques... Yeah, you're pretty much useless... but I can't say that!)\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick. You don't have to say anything.

I'm sorry.\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Maya:\nI don't know anything about trials, or defense...

But you never know when my luck is going to run out!Maya:\nReally...?Edgeworth:\nW-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart...Phoenix:\nOh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)Judge:\nCourt is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.Karma:\nYes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?Karma:\nLotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?Lotta:\nThat I am.Karma:\nGood. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?Lotta:\n... Y'all need to learn some manners.Karma:\nUNDERSTAND?Lotta:\nY-yeah, I understand, I understand!Judge:\nEr... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nI was in my car.\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nThen there was another \"bang\"...\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:\nEnough.Lotta:\nHuh?Karma:\nJudge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:\nW-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:\nAs the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:\n... Well, Judge?Judge:\nThe evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nW-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:\nA cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:\n...!Karma:\nVery well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:\nUh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:\n\"Contempt of court,\" you know?Maya:\nI... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?I think there was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... think I noticed one little thing...\nMaya:\nWow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on!\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...)\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"I think there wasn't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHonestly, I found nothing.\nMaya:\nI dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!\nPhoenix:\nI bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.\nMaya:\nBut... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will...\nPhoenix:\nHe'll bang down that \"flimsy gavel\" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.\nMaya:\nI guess we'll just have to bluff it.\nPhoenix:\nBut if we mess up... contempt of court.\nMaya:\nHey, if we lose we'll be held in public contempt!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right.\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"Phoenix:\nI understand... I will cross-examine the witness!Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk...

I think we've heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting.Phoenix:\nB-but, Your Honor!Karma:\nYou keep your promise!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court!Karma:\nAnd if that happens, you'll have to leave the courtroom immediately!

Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It's unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It's highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death!Lotta:\n...!Maya:\nLotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!?Judge:\nYou will stand down!

I saw Edgeworth...Karma:Karma:\nEnough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court!Judge:\nY-yes... yes, of course. I'm sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave.Phoenix:\n(No... No...!)Wait!Maya:\nI-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent!Karma:\nHah!

Well? You were trying to photograph Gourdy, weren't you! That's why you had set your camera to respond to loud noises!\nLeads to:\n\"Order! Order!\"Present Gourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe proof is this article about Gourdy the lake monster!\nLotta:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this article... When Gourdy breaks through the water, it makes a loud noise! Which is why you set up your camera with that microphone! You had it set to respond to loud noises! And that's how you got this picture when the pistol fired!\nLeads to:\n\"Order! Order!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof! It's simple!\nJudge:\n... If it's simple... then why have you obviously made an error, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nUrk...?\nLotta:\nWhat's that!?\nKarma:\nGo home. Consider a career change.\nPhoenix:\n(Gah! How can they so casually toss aside this eviden... Oh. Whoops. Wrong evidence.)\nJudge:\nLuckily for you, I'm in a patient mood, Mr. Wright. One more time please.\nLeads back to:\n\"Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!\"Judge:\nOrder! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange.Phoenix:\n(Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren't you?Lotta:\n... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what?Phoenix:\nHuh...?Lotta:\nThat don't change what I saw, does it?Karma:\nExactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist!Lotta:\nH-hey!Karma:\nBut, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing!Phoenix:\n(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!)Judge:\nMs. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony.Lotta:\n... Right. Fine, I'll testify. It won't change nothing, though.Phoenix:\n(Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!)Karma:\n...Witness Testimony-- Lotta's New Testimony --Lotta:\nActually, I'm not a research student at a university.\nI'm an investigative photographer.\nImagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!\nThat's why I was camping out by the lake.\nBut, that's all I was hiding.\nWhen I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake.\nThere wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.\nThen I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot.\nI was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Karma:Karma:\nThe witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!Judge:\nEr... hmm.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nI claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)Judge:\nVery well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.Karma:\nHah! That would be a first!Phoenix:\n(Hah hah, very funny.)Judge:\nYou understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination",

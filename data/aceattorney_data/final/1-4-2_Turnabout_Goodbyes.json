  "previousContext": "Episode 4Turnabout Goodbyes\nIt's been, what, 15 years?\nAbout that, yes.\n15 years is a long time to wait... You can't imagine how much I've suffered...\nYou... suffered?\nAnd now... the perfect opportunity presents itself. At last... I shall have my revenge!\nWhat!?\n...Merry Christmas.\nDecember 25, 10:08 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?\nPhoenix:\nWaterfalls...? Dare I ask why?\nMaya:\nDuh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!\nPhoenix:\n... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?\nMaya:\nOf course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...\nMaya:\nOh. Darn.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?\nMaya:\n... Good idea!\nPhoenix:\n(So much for the rushing spring waters...)\nTV:\nNext in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it \"Gourdy\" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ...\nPhoenix:\n*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?\nMaya:\nNick?\nPhoenix:\n?\nMaya:\nThe water pressure's kind of low in that shower.\nPhoenix:\n... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?\nMaya:\n... Good idea, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) (Changed from [Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...] in the original release)\nTV:\nWe interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder!\nPhoenix:\n(Gourd Lake again?)\nTV:\nThe body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away?\nPhoenix:\n(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--\nMaya:\nNick?\nPhoenix:\nYipes! M-Maya!\nMaya:\nThe fireman yelled at me when I called him.\nPhoenix:\nWe've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!\nMaya:\nWhat? You mean, the prosecutor?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!\nMaya:\nWhaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?\nPhoenix:\nI-I don't know!\nMaya:\nLet's go find out, Nick!\nDecember 25Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nYou know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?\nPhoenix:\nI guess it comes with the territory.\nMaya:\nI'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!\nPhoenix:\n... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you doing here!?\nMaya:\nNick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.\nPhoenix:\nWell, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?\nMaya:\nNick... Should we be laughing?\nPhoenix:\nNah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.\nEdgeworth:\n... Yes you do.\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, he's right.)\nEdgeworth:\n... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't want to see you like this, either. Believe me.) (Changed from [Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.] in the original release)\nDecember 25Gourd Lake ParkEntrance\nMaya:\nThis is where it happened?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.\nMaya:\nI can see some police walking around in there.\nPhoenix:\nQuestioning people, probably.\nMaya:\nHey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?\nPolice:\nS-sorry, sir... Nothing.\nGumshoe:\nIdiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!\nPolice:\nB-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--\nGumshoe:\nShaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... I'll... I'll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal! (Changed from [I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!] in the original release)\nPolice:\nY-yes, sir!\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!\nGumshoe:\nRecruits... peh! ... Aah!\nMaya:\nEek!\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!\nPhoenix:\nWright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)\nGumshoe:\nAnd just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!\nMaya:\nHe seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPolice:\nDetective Gumshoe, sir!\nGumshoe:\nWhat? Find something!?\nPolice:\nUm, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing...\nGumshoe:\nA briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?\nPhoenix:\nYou're not coming back, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nErm... Probably not, pal.\nPhoenix:\nSo, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?\nGumshoe:\nAh, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.\nDetective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station.\nPhoenix:\nOh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nW-what!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.\nMaya:\nYou know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...\nMaya:\nRight! Now, let's get investigating!\nDecember 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nMaya:\n... Looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here.\nChief:\nSomething wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in? Okay, what did you do? Shoplifting? Larceny? Public indecency...?\nMaya:\nN-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around?\nChief:\nGumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon.\nMaya:\nOkay, we'll come back.\nChief:\nYou do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that?\nMaya:\n... Do I look like a criminal or something?\nDecember 25Gourd LakePublic Beach\nMaya:\nWowsers! This is \"Gourd Lake\"?\nPhoenix:\nYup. I'm not sure it warrants a \"wowsers,\" though.\nMaya:\nHmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!\nPhoenix:\n\"Samurai Dogs\"...?\nMaya:\nI wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great!\nPhoenix:\nWith a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?\nMaya:\nThey're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into \"The Pink Princess\" now. I mean, like, y'know!?\nPhoenix:\n(Nope.)\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nDetention Center\nDecember 25Boat Rental Shop\nMaya:\nNick... what is this place?\nPhoenix:\nA boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either.\nMaya:\nBoats... I've never ridden on a boat.\nPhoenix:\nReally? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished?\nMaya:\nHey, good idea! You bet!\nDecember 25Gourd Lake Woods\nMaya:\nI like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping!\nPhoenix:\nThey've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder.\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder!\nPhoenix:\n(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them.\nPhoenix:\nThis camera has a mic and some sort of attachment. It must take pictures when triggered by a noise.\nMaya:\nWow! Cool! Let's try it out! *cough* \"Hi, I'm Nick!\" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. \"HEY! I'M NICK!!!\" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nWill you stop that?\nMaya:\nMaybe it's broken?\nPhoenix:\nD-don't kick it! Maybe it isn't set up to respond to voices?\nMaya:\nWell what then? These things? (Changed from [Well what then? I know!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThe party poppers...? (Changed from [The party popper...?] in the original release)\n*BANG*\nklik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik klik\nMaya:\n... Well. It responded. (Changed from [... Yep. It responded.] in the original release)\n???:\nYaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw! Hey, you! Git yer hands offa' that!\nMaya:\nEek!\n???:\nWhat in the Sam Hill...!? Look what ya done now! There goes a whole roll of film!\nMaya:\nAh? Wha... huh? S-sorry!\n???:\nSorry's nice but it don't pay my bills! Y'all know how much a roll of that film costs!?\nMaya:\nI-I'll pay you back!\n???:\nWhat were ya'll thinkin' settin' off a party-popper in a place like this?\nMaya:\nUh... well...\n???:\nWhat! Don't try to play stupid with me just 'cause you think I'm some country bumpkin! Yeah, I know how y'all Yanks think! \"I say, those southern folks talk with that exaggerated drawl, why they must be dumb!\" Well let me tell you, just because I might be dumb don't mean we all are!\nMaya:\nN-Nick, help!\n???:\nAnd who are you, now? Her chaperone?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, uh, no, rather, uhh... we're sort of... friends?\n???:\nJus' figure out what y'all are gonna say and say it for bejeezum's sake! Gawd, I'd rather sit through one of papa's drawls than listen to you stutter all day.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy... I guess we should pay her for the film...)\n???:\nWatch it!\nPhoenix:\nYes ma'am. (On second thought, I'll pay later...)\nMaya:\nI'm really sorry!\nPhoenix:\nI, er, this is my badge.\n???:\nHuh? Aren't badges supposed t' be all shiny and impressive? You a cop or something?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I'm a lawyer.\n???:\nWh-what!? Y'all ain't gonna try and pull one o' them lawsuits on me over that film now? Cause I'll have you know I'm a fighter and I wrassled meaner looking' things'n you!\nPhoenix:\nN-no, that's not it at all. We're here investigating a murder that took place here, on the lake.\n???:\nA murder...? ... Sounds cool! Why didn't y'all say that in the first place! Go ahead, ask me anything ya like!\nPhoenix:\n(Finally! Some cooperation!)\n???:\nYou too. Y'all can come out of hiding now. I won't bite. Hard.\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, where did Maya get to?)\nMaya:\nS-sorry... I-I was feeling a little overwhelmed. The culture gap and all...\n???:\nNever you mind, honey. I kin' talk Yank for ya if... ahem... if it pleases you?\nMaya:\nTh-thanks. I think I'll be okay.\nLotta:\nGreat then! I'm Lotta, Lotta Hart, but y'all can call me Lotta! I'm here photographing meteor showers for a research project. Mighty pleased ta meet ya!\nPhoenix:\nLotta?\nLotta:\nYeah?\nPhoenix:\nSo, your camera... it triggers on loud explosion noises?\nLotta:\nAyup.\nPhoenix:\nActually, the victim in the case we're researching--he was shot with a pistol.\nLotta:\nA pistol...?\nPhoenix:\nRight. Now wouldn't a gunshot make a similar noise to our party popper...?\nLotta:\nI guess it would.\nPhoenix:\nYour camera... didn't get a picture of the murder, did it?\nLotta:\n... Hey! Y'all are pretty bright!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nLotta:\nI see what yer sayin'... Tell ya what, I'll have a look-see at my film.\nPhoenix:\nIt would have been a photo taken late last night...\nLotta:\nI checked 'em once, don't remember if there was anything on 'em though. But what if I got sumtin'! I could be witness to a genuine murder! Yeehaw! I'll go check that film. Y'all come back now, y'hear?\nMaya:\nShe went inside her SUV. I guess we should come back later...\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nAfter presenting Lotta's Camera in Gourd Lake Woods:\nDecember 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nMaya:\n... I guess Detective Gumshoe is still in that meeting.\nGumshoe:\nHey! Thanks for coming down, pal!\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nWe just finished the meeting. For better or for worse...\nPhoenix:\n(I get the feeling we're in for some bad news...)\nWright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"The autopsy report\" Talk option in Police Department - Criminal Affairs)\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\nOh. Nothing... Just, something's been bothering me. ... Could you show me that autopsy report once more? ... ... ... Hey! I-I remember now! This guy! This is a lawyer that was at that office Mia worked at! I met him once when I went there to hang out with Sis!\nPhoenix:\nThat office...? Wait! You mean Grossberg's office?\nMaya:\nRight! That guy!\nPhoenix:\n(That was the last name I expected to come up... Maybe I should go talk to him... for old time's sake.)\nDecember 25Grossberg Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nIt's been a while since I was here last. Mr. Grossberg is out as usual.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. Look at the wall.\nPhoenix:\n(That painting is still missing... Mia must have known about the deal with Mr. Grossberg and Redd White... She kept track of all of White's extortion and blackmail rackets.)\nDetention Center\nAfter clearing \"The autopsy report\" Talk option in Police Department - Criminal Affairs:\nDecember 25Gourd Lake Woods\nLotta:\nHey y'all!\nMaya:\nLotta!\nLotta:\nWait up a sec! We got bingo!\nMaya:\nBingo...?\nLotta:\nMy automatic camera took two pictures last night!\nMaya:\nHey!\nLotta:\nThis is them. Take a look!\nPhoenix:\nWait...!\nLotta:\nSee? See? He's shooting him with that pistol!\nPhoenix:\nI-it looks like that, yes.\nMaya:\nBut you can't really tell who that is shooting.\nLotta:\nYeah, well there was enough fog out there last night t' strangle a bullfrog. But, y'know... Seeing these photos reminded me of something.\nMaya:\nWhat...?\nLotta:\nI saw the murder happen. I'm a witness!\nMaya:\nWhaaaaaaa!?\nPhoenix:\nA-are you serious!?\nLotta:\nCourse!\nPhoenix:\n(How do you forget... never mind.)\nLotta:\nY'all reckon I should tell the cops?\nLotta:\nHey, so, I'm off to talk to the cops. Y'all can have this photo. Later.\nPhoenix:\nW-w-wait! Lotta!\nLotta:\nWhat? Can't y'all see I'm kinda busy?\nPhoenix:\nT-tell us what you saw, too! Please?\nLotta:\nNice try, honey, but I wasn't born yesterday. I'm a witness, and that means I'm on the side of justice, and that means the cops! I'd sooner eat the south side of a north-bound skunk than tell you!\nMaya:\nL-Lotta!\nLotta:\nDon't let it get your skivvies in a bunch. Friends today, enemies tomorrow! Or was that the other way round? No matter. I'm gone! Hey! Maybe they'll let me do some testifying! Hot darn!\nMaya:\nShe left... ... Well, that's one more witness. What do we do now, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, if she saw something, there's not much we can do about it. The question is: what exactly did she see...? I guess we'll find out in the trial tomorrow.)\nLake Photo added to the Court Record.\nDecember 25Gourd LakePublic Beach\nMaya:\nLooks like the police have given up their interviewing. (Changed from [Looks like the police have given up their questioning.] in the original release)\n???:\nHey!\nMaya:\nAah! N-Nick! I think Santa's mad at you!\n???:\nLong time no see, Nick.\nMaya:\nNick... you know Santa!? Wow... Nick and St. Nick... Hey! I see the connection!\nPhoenix:\nDon't be ridiculous!\n???:\nDude, it's me!\nPhoenix:\nL... Larry! What are you doing here!?\nButz:\nIsn't it obvious? I'm working my day job! I sell Samurai Dogs! Want one? Gotta get money for dates, you know, My girl Kiyance deserves the best!\nPhoenix:\n(K-Kiyance...? Not another model, I hope...)\nButz:\nOh, Kiyance's a fine, fine woman, Nick. It was her idea that I wear this costume! She was all \"You go girlfriend!\" Y'know? She bought this costume for me!\nPhoenix:\nThat... that's great, Larry.\nMaya:\nWow! A Santa costume! She must be really nice!\nButz:\nWhoa! Cute! Nick! Who's she? She's not your...?\nPhoenix:\nNot my... what? N-no, she's not!\nMaya:\nI'm his partner, Maya Fey. I'm, uh, the little sister.\nButz:\nSister...? ... Wow, Nick, must be tough. Working nine to five, having to take care of a little sister...\nMaya:\nN-no, I'm not Nick's sister, I'm my older sister's little sister...\nButz:\nHuh. Sounds great!\nPhoenix:\n(Don't worry, Maya, he's not listening...)\nDecember 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nMaya:\n... Not a Gumshoe in sight.\nPolice:\nIf you're looking for Detective Gumshoe, he's in the questioning room. Apparently, an important witness turned up. He'll be in there for a while.\nMaya:\nLotta Hart... it has to be.\nPhoenix:\nUh oh...\nDetention Center\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Gourd Lake - Public Beach:\nDecember 25Grossberg Law Offices\nGrossberg:\n*Ah-HHHHEM!*\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, that old familiar clearing of the throat!)\nGrossberg:\nAh hah! You're Mia's... something, are you not?\nPhoenix:\nI was her understudy, yes. Phoenix Wright.\nGrossberg:\nAh hah! And you, you're Mia's... something too, are you not?\nMaya:\nHer little sister, yes!\nGrossberg:\nYou've grown! You've come to look a lot like your sister, you know? It takes me back. \"Ahh... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon...\" you see.\nPhoenix:\nUm, Mr. Grossberg, sir?\nGrossberg:\nHmm...? Ah, yes. I beg your pardon. Of course you came here to discuss something. What is it then? Something the matter?\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nDecember 25Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's this? I was hoping you'd gotten my message the first time.\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth, what about your defense?\nEdgeworth:\n...! It's no concern of yours.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess he hasn't found anyone yet.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Lake Photo:\nEdgeworth:\n... Wright.\nPhoenix:\n?\nEdgeworth:\nIt pains me to ask you this now...\nMaya:\nI know! You want us to defend you!\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Will you?\nPhoenix:\nThis is my chance to finally pay you back.\nMaya:\nPay him back...?\nEdgeworth:\nPay me back? For what? I don't remember ever doing anything for you.\nPhoenix:\nNever mind... I guess you don't really need to know.\nEdgeworth:\nHuh... My letter of request. Please give it to Detective Gumshoe.\nEdgeworth's Request put in pocket.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess we should... ... W-what's that!?\nMaya:\nE-earthquake! Nick! It's a big one! Whaaaaa! I-it's calming down... ... Whew... that was scary!\nPhoenix:\n...? Huh? Where's Edgeworth?\nMaya:\n... There. He's on the floor in a ball, shivering. I guess he doesn't do so well with earthquakes.\nPhoenix:\n(I've heard of running, but curling up in a ball?)\nMaya:\nWell, I guess we're done. Mr. Edgeworth doesn't seem like he's going to stand up any time soon. Let's go, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nUh.. right. We have to give Edgeworth's letter of request to Detective Gumshoe.\nAfter Edgeworth's Request is added to the Court Record:\nDecember 25Police DepartmentCriminal Affairs\nGumshoe:\nWhat's going on here!?\nMaya:\nEek!\nPhoenix:\nW-what's wrong, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThis wild lady comes in here just a while ago... Says she came \"to talk to y'all after hearing what Mr. Wright had to say\"! What's this all about, pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta Hart...)\nGumshoe:\nWhy are you going around finding more witnesses!? You want to give Mr. Edgeworth the death sentence, pal!?\nPhoenix:\nN-no, not at all... Just... I mean, she did see something. There's nothing I can do about that. I can't go around covering up evidence!\nGumshoe:\nEr... You trying to say something about the way I do my job?\nPhoenix:\nNo sir!\nPhoenix:\nLook what I got.\nGumshoe:\n... Hey, you did it, pal! Glad I waited till the last minute to file those papers! I'll rip 'em up and start new ones for you!\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Detective. Well, see you in court tomorrow, then.\nGumshoe:\nGood luck, pal. Hey! You guys feel that earthquake a little while back? I was worried!\nMaya:\nWorried? We're fine! I've lived out here my whole life. I'm pretty used to them by now.\nGumshoe:\nOh, I wasn't worried about you two. I was worried about Mr. Edgeworth!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, right...) He did seem to over-react a little, now that you mention it.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, well, I'm not surprised. It was a pretty big quake. I'm going to go check on him. You two go eat and get your rest for tomorrow's trial. Later!\nMaya:\n... I wonder what it is with Mr. Edgeworth and earthquakes?\nPhoenix:\nI wonder... He was never that scared of them when he was in school.\nPhoenix:\n(Then again, I only really got to know him in 4th grade. (Changed from [Then again, I was only in the same class as him for 4th grade.] in the original release) He transferred to another school after that. I wonder what happened to Edgeworth...)\nTo be continued.",

(ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThat's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!Maya:\nNot a single case?Edgeworth:\nHe'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.Phoenix:\nHmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.Phoenix:\n(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)Edgeworth:\nHe taught me what it really means to \"prosecute.\"Phoenix:\nWh-what!?Edgeworth:\nJust picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.Maya:\nUgh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nSomething like that...Maya:\nAnd now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.Edgeworth:\nNot a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!Maya:\nThat's pretty ruthless...Edgeworth:\nLike I said. He's a god among prosecutors.Phoenix:\n(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?Maya:\nUh huh?Phoenix:\nWe could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?Maya:\nOh...Phoenix:\n?Maya:\nI can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.Phoenix:\nYou couldn't \"reach\"?Maya:\nI think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...Phoenix:\nOh man, what bad timing!Maya:\nI'm really sorry. I'll try my best!Phoenix:\nI hope so!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you whispering about?Phoenix:\nO-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:\n...Judge:\nErr, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?Karma:\n... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?Judge:\nR-right, my apologies!Phoenix:\n(He's even got the Judge scared!)Judge:\nVery well, your opening statement, please.Karma:\n... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?Judge:\nAh... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.Maya:\nWhat's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?Phoenix:\nHow am I supposed to fight against this!?Karma:\nI call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.Phoenix:\n(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)Karma:\nDescribe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:\nY-yessir!Phoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:\nEr, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:\nHmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:\nTestify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:\nW-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...Karma:\nYes?Judge:\nActually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings...Karma:\nWrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word \"guilty.\" That is your role!Judge:\nY-yes, of course. You're quite right.Phoenix:\n(No, he's not!!!)Witness Testimony-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.\nThat's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Judge:\nHmm... I see. Very well...Karma:\nBegin your cross-examination, attorney. Now!Judge:\n...Cross Examination",

Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!Karma:\nWas the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:\nYes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:\nHmm...Maya:\nHey, Nick! What does he mean, \"ballistic markings\"?Karma:\nShocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:\nN-Nick! He's glaring at me!Karma:\nTsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:\nEh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the \"fingerprints\" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these \"ballistic fingerprints\" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.Karma:\nIndeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!Judge:\nO-order! Order!Phoenix:\n(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)Karma:\nWell, Judge?Judge:\nI'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:\nYou wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!Judge:\nY-yes?Karma:\nWhat are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!Judge:\nB-but, wait, I...Karma:\nJust bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!Judge:\nY-yes! Ahem.

Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nUh... hmm...Phoenix:\nAnd that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!Edgeworth:\nTrue...Phoenix:\nWas that you in the boat?Edgeworth:\n... Yes. It was me.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nBut... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.Phoenix:\nTh-then who did!?Edgeworth:\nI... don't know.Phoenix:\nYou don't know!? Weren't you right there!?Edgeworth:\n... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!Phoenix:\nY-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:\n... That's the only explanation I can come up with.Phoenix:\nHuh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?Maya:\nHuh? Wh-what?Phoenix:\nAny progress with Mia?Maya:\nOh... Sorry. It's no good.Phoenix:\nUgh...Maya:\nI know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?No, I need you here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, of course not, I need you here! I can see you're always trying to help out. Even if you don't actually help... it's the thought that counts, right?\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick, you don't have to make me feel better.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Yeah, you're useless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, actually... (You don't know law, you don't have any trial experience or techniques... Yeah, you're pretty much useless... but I can't say that!)\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick. You don't have to say anything. Your face said it for you.\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops!) N-no, o-of course we... I'm sorry.\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Maya:\nI don't know anything about trials, or defense...

But you never know when my luck is going to run out!Maya:\nReally...?Edgeworth:\nW-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart...Phoenix:\nOh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)Judge:\nCourt is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.Karma:\nYes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?Karma:\nLotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?Lotta:\nThat I am.Karma:\nGood. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?Lotta:\n... Y'all need to learn some manners.Karma:\nUNDERSTAND?Lotta:\nY-yeah, I understand, I understand!Judge:\nEr... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nI was in my car.\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nThen there was another \"bang\"...\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:\nEnough.Lotta:\nHuh?Karma:\nJudge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:\nW-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:\nAs the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:\n... Well, Judge?Judge:\nThe evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nW-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:\nA cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:\n...!Karma:\nVery well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:\nUh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:\n\"Contempt of court,\" you know?Maya:\nI... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?I think there was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... think I noticed one little thing...\nMaya:\nWow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on!\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...)\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"I think there wasn't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHonestly, I found nothing.\nMaya:\nI dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!\nPhoenix:\nI bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.\nMaya:\nBut... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will...\nPhoenix:\nHe'll bang down that \"flimsy gavel\" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.\nMaya:\nI guess we'll just have to bluff it.\nPhoenix:\nBut if we mess up... contempt of court.\nMaya:\nHey, if we lose we'll be held in public contempt!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right.\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"Phoenix:\nI understand... I will cross-examine the witness!Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk...

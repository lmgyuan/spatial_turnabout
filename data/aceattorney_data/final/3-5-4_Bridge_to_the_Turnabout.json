It is said that this sacred sword represents life itself. Though the branches may appear to be infinite, the choices limitless... ...like our destinies, the sword comes to but one end. One merciless point. And when the silver cord, the fragile thread that binds us to this world, is severed... ...the illusion is revealed and the implacability of fate is finally laid bare...\nFebruary 6, 9:48 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nHey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah? What is it?\nMaya:\nYou know how I've got spiritual powers, unlike you?\nPhoenix:\nUm, sure... You are a spirit medium, after all.\nMaya:\nBut just like you, if I don't keep my powers sharp, they get dull, right?\nPhoenix:\nUm... I guess so, yeah.\nMaya:\nGlad you agree! OK, Pearly! You're up!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls...?)\nPearl:\nSo! That's why we need to go on a special \"Spiritual Hot Spot Tour\", Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\n...Huh? I'm lost. What's this magazine you're shoving in my face?\nPearl:\nIt's the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\", Winter Spiritual Locations Special!\nPhoenix:\n...Oh. (Pearls looks so happy.)\nMaya:\n\"Maximize your spiritual powers with just one night of intensive training!\" ...Oh! It sounds too good to be true!\nPhoenix:\nI'll say. It sounds more like a scam to me.\nMaya:\nIt's at a spiritual retreat called \"Hazakura Temple\". It's way up in the mountains, and I bet it's nice and cold. ...Just perfect for training!\nPhoenix:\n(Now I definitely don't want to go...)\nMaya:\nYou know, I think I've heard of this temple before. It's a famous channeling dojo. It's hard for even real spirit mediums like us to make reservations up there!\nPhoenix:\nReservations...? For a temple? Are you serious?\nPearl:\nDon't worry! I've already made special reservations, just for us!\nMaya:\nYeah! And I signed up for the \"Special Course\"!\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's nice. And the timing couldn't be better. ...Since we don't have a case right now anyway.\nMaya:\nAlrighty then! It's settled! Well, come on! Don't just stand there! Start packing your stuff!\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! You'd better start packing your stuff!\nPhoenix:\nHuh...? M-ME!? Why do I have to go!?\nMaya:\nWell, we have to be accompanied by someone over 20 years old.\nPhoenix:\nHey! I don't have anything to do with spirit power. The only thing I can channel is a TV. ... So, um, is there a heated pool at this \"Hazakura Temple\"?\nPearl:\nNo, but you can stand under a freezing waterfall!\nPhoenix:\n... Sorry, but I think I'll pass. I hate cold places.\nMaya:\nWhaaat!? No way! How can you be so selfish!?\nPearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Look at this place! Doesn't it look beautiful!?\nPhoenix:\nNope. Not going. I'm gonna be nice and toasty at home....... .................What the...!?\nPearl:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nLet me see that magazine! Th-This nun...\nMaya:\nIs she a friend of yours or something, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This girl... I-It's...!)\nDahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.\nDahlia:\nHonestly, how can any woman ever count on you for anything? ...You disgust me!\nPhoenix:\nBut... It can't be! (She was found guilty and should still be in prison...)\nPearl:\n...Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n... I'll go.\nMaya:\nHuh...?\nPhoenix:\nHazakura Temple... I said I'll go.\nMaya:\nYay! Isn't that great, Pearly!?\nPearl:\nYes! Oh, thank you! Thank you, Mr. Nick! You'd do anything for Mystic Maya, right? Even walk over burning coals, right!?\n\"Oh! Cult!\" New Year's Issue received from Pearls.\nPhoenix:\n(Dahlia Hawthorne... I knew there was no way she could possibly be at that temple... But, I just had to be see for myself... ...who this \"nun\" really was.)\nFebruary 7, 3:24 PMHazakura TempleMain Gate\nMaya:\nBrrrrr... It-It-It's so c-c-cold here, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you should put on something warmer for a change!\nMaya:\nW-W-Well, it's supposed to be c-c-cold... It's t-t-training. ...Ah-Achoo!\nPhoenix:\n(Her teeth are chattering so loudly, it's all I can do to make out what she's saying...)\nPearl:\nWow, Mystic Maya! So this is the famous Hazakura Temple!\nMaya:\nP-P-P-Pearly... I-I-I-I... Ah-Achoo!\n???:\nWell, well, well... How nice to see you here. Welcome to our temple!\nMaya:\nOh...! Th-Th-Thank you... Ah-Achoo!\n???:\nOh my, my, my... Thank you for coming all this way. Come now, come now. You must have been cold.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's with the past tense...? We're freezing into human popsicles as we spea--!\n???:\nHo ho ho. Well, we are high up in the mountains after all. In any case, we shouldn't speak here. ...Please follow me inside.\nMaya:\nTh-Thank you. I was starting to think I would pass--\n???:\nOh! Yes, yes! I almost forgot to introduce myself.\nBikini:\nI'm the head nun here at the temple. My name is Bikini.\nMaya:\nB-B-B-Bikini...!?\nBikini:\nThat's riiight! Actually, that's my \"temple\" name. What do you think? It's a tradition to have one, and I wanted something that has a nice image to it. So I thought, \"Why not choose a bikini?\" Besides, it makes me seem younger. Wa ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!\nMaya:\nIt certainly does! Oh, I signed up for your \"Special Course\"!\nBikini:\nWell, my, my, my. Quite brave of you considering how cold it is! Young people can be so reckless with their health! Don't blame me if you become one with those you channel. Wa ha ha! Ho ho ho!\nPearl:\nR-Reckless...?\nMaya:\n\"Wa ha ha\"...?\nPearl:\nMaybe you should take it easy tonight, Mystic Maya... We can come back another day.\nMaya:\nBut you went through all that trouble to get reservations for m--\nBikini:\nYes, yes, yes, that's right! You've come all this way, so please, enjoy yourselves! There's still time before supper, so why don't you have a look around?\nFebruary 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall\nMaya:\nBrr... It's fr-freezing in here, too! Achoo!\nPearl:\nHee hee. It reminds me of the Meditation Room in Fey Manor!\nPhoenix:\n...Pearls, you've been in an unusually good mood since we got here.\nPearl:\nWell, kids are made of energy, you know!\nPhoenix:\nAs for you, Maya, you look like you're about to catch a bad cold.\nMaya:\nW-W-Well, I'm not exactly a little kid anymore, I guess. Ah-Achoo!\nPhoenix:\n(Nngh... Is she going to make it...?)\nFebruary 7Suspension Bridge\nMaya:\nWow! Look at this broken down old bridge, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, and look at that big canyon below us.\nMaya:\nHey! There's a river down there! It looks like it's flowing real fast! ...What's wrong, Nick? You look like you've seen a ghost!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm just not very good with heights...\nMaya:\nOh... Hey! I've got it! Maybe you should face your fear and try hurling yourself off the edge? You know! One... Two... Three... Jump! It might be just what you need to get over your fear of heights!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, death is a real good way to overcome phobias alright. Anyway, it sure looks like a rickety bridge.\nMaya:\nCan't argue there. That's probably why it's called, \"Dusty Bridge\".\nPhoenix:\nRead it again, Maya. It says, \"Dusky Bridge\".\nMaya:\nWell, it's practically the same thing.\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate:\nFebruary 7Hazakura TempleMain Hall\nMaya:\nTh-Th-The Main Hall... I th-think it's even c-c-c-colder in here! Achoo!\nPearl:\nAh! Mr. Nick! Do you smell that? It smells like meat and gravy!\nMaya:\nYeah, you're right! I guess it's pot roast for tonight! Yum!\nPhoenix:\n...Weird. I thought they would serve something a little more... well, traditional.\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about, Nick!? You think monks and nuns just sit around eating rice gruel all the time!?\nPearl:\nMystic Maya is right! Ooh! I hope there's mashed potatoes, too! I love mashed potatoes!\n???:\nHa ha ha... What a cute little acolyte! Greetings to all of you.\nPhoenix:\nOh... Um, hello. (Wow, this lady makes Maya look like a 6.8/10 on the weirdness scale.)\nMaya:\nYour outfit... Did you come here for the Special Course, too...?\n???:\nHa, ha, ha... Unfortunately, no. Actually, I'm...\nPearl:\nAaaaaaaaaah! Y-You're...! Y-You're...! You're Ms. Elise Deauxnim!\nElise:\nYes, that's right... You know of me?\nPearl:\nM-M-My name... My name is Pearl Fey! I-I'm your biggest fan!\nMaya:\nWho is she, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I see it now... Zvarri! A fortune-teller...?\nPearl:\nI-I've got all your books, Ms. Deauxnim!\nElise:\nHa, ha, ha... What a sweet thing to say. And please, call me Elise.\nPhoenix:\nUm, \"books\"...?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, don't you know anything!? Don't you even know who this is?\nPhoenix:\nWell, um... ...An author, maybe?\nElise:\nYes, and an illustrator. ...Of picture books.\nMaya:\nPicture books, huh? Oh, now I get it...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nElise:\nWell, you'll have to excuse me now... I have to go help with the dinner preparations.\nPearl:\nWow! You mean you're cooking dinner tonight?\nElise:\nThat's right. Would you like to help too, Pearl?\nPearl:\nYes, yes! I want to help with whatever I can!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls looks like she just won the lottery...)\nMaya:\nOh, I'll help too, then...\nElise:\n...No, it's fine. Please don't worry about it. Feel free to relax and explore the area with your friend.\nMaya:\nHuh!? But...\nElise:\n...Oh, yes! Please take this. I think it will be of help to you. It's a map of the area. We wouldn't want you to get lost now, would we?\nPhoenix:\n(The \"Inner Temple\"... There it is, on the other side of the bridge...) Well, if you insist, I guess we'll take this chance to go check out the other temple.\nHazakura Temple Map added to the Court Record.\nPearl:\nOK! I'll see you two later then! Remember! You're not allowed to fight!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Let's go! At least we'll stay warm if we keep moving!\nFebruary 7Hazakura TempleMain Gate\nMaya:\nHuh? Where did Sister Bikini go?\nPhoenix:\nI guess she went to the Inner Temple... To go help that other nun out.\nMaya:\nOh, right... I think her name is... Iris?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah... That was it. (I want to find out who Iris really is, but I'm scared of what I'll find...)\nMaya:\n...?\nFebruary 7Inner Temple Gate\nMaya:\nWhoa, that bridge was shaking like jello in an earthquake.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nAnd at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I bet. (Changed from [And at least half of the wood on that rickety bridge was rotting, I'd bet.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nNot to mention the last part only had like one board left on it!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong with you? Your face is all green.\nPhoenix:\nC-Can you not pick on me for a second? I'm still trying to get over the shock that we made it safely across that death trap.\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess I'm a bit surprised, too... Yikes! That \"temple\" is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse at any time... (Changed from [Yikes! That 'temple' is in bad shape. It looks like it could collapse anytime...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI guess people don't use it too often. Is this really where you're going to train tonight?\nMaya:\nThat has to be it. It's kinda creepy around here... Like a ghost might jump out at you or something!\nPhoenix:\n(A spirit medium afraid of ghosts...? Isn't it ironic, don't you think?)\nFebruary 7Inner TempleTraining Hall\nPhoenix:\nMan, look at this place... It's just a tiny, freezing-cold room. So this is where you'll both be training, huh...\nMaya:\nHuh? What do you mean, \"both\"? I'm the only one.\nPhoenix:\nReally? But I thought...\nMaya:\nPearly's just a little kid. She couldn't handle this kind of intense training.\nPhoenix:\n(So says the girl who I can barely hear over her teeth chattering...) (Changed from [So says the girl who I can barely hear over her bones chattering...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nAnyway... The real training room must be behind that door over there. Hmm... Yup, definitely getting the feeling it's back there. (Changed from [Yeah, I get the feeling it's back there, definitely.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Even I can sense that there's something supernatural about the cavern behind that door...) (Changed from [If only because the cavern behind that door is giving off a real supernatural feel...] in the original release)\n???:\nUm... Excuse me, but... Who are you...? ...Ah! ...\nPhoenix:\nY-You're...\nMaya:\nHi there! We're just looking around since we're going to be staying here tonight...\n???:\n...\nMaya:\n...? Is something wrong?\n???:\nUh, er, no! It-It's nothing...\nMaya:\nI wonder why she spaced out like that. Don't you, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nUh... D-Did you say something, M-Maya?\nMaya:\n... Not you too, Nick...\nIris:\nI... M-My name is Iris. I'm one of the nuns here at this temple.\nMaya:\nI'm Maya Fey. It's a pleasure to meet you!\nIris:\nThe pleasure is mine... ... Oh, er, please excuse me! I have some... um, chores to attend to.\nMaya:\nShe sure is beautiful... and a bit spacey, I guess... I guess she's just not used to talking with urban sophisticates like us.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nNick?\nPhoenix:\n(That girl... It-It can't be, but...)\nMaya:\n...?\nAfter examining hanging scroll in Inner Temple - Training Hall:\nFebruary 7Dusky Bridge\nMaya:\nWhew, we managed to make it across Dusty Bridge.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nNick, you look green. Are you feeling alright?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nHey! What's wrong with you? Ever since we met Sister Iris at the Training Hall, you've been really quiet.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Oh, um. Sorry...\n???:\nHey, you! ...Wait up!\nMaya:\n...? You think he's yelling at us?\nPhoenix:\nHe must be. There's no one else around...\n???:\nWould you mind moving? You're standing right in my way. ... Ah!\nMaya:\nHey! I know you! You're...\n???:\nWhoa! Sorry! Gotta run! ...See ya!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey! Wait a minute!\n???:\nOh, uh, nice to meet you. ...I'm Laurice Deauxnim.\nPhoenix:\nLiar! You're Larry! Your clothes may change, but you're still the Butz.\nButz:\nShaddup! I'm... I'm... Lauriiiiice! And I'm just here to do a sketch of Dusky Bridge!\nMaya:\nSo... it really is our Larry. ...Not that I get why he's pretending to be someone else.\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Iris profile:\nPearl:\nEveryone!\nMaya:\nHey! Pearly!\nPearl:\nDinner preparations are complete! Please come quickly to the Main Hall!\nMaya:\nAlright! I can't wait to dig in, Pearly!\nPearl:\nI'm going to go to the Inner Temple and call Sister Iris! I also want to have a look at where Mystic Maya is going to be training...\nFebruary 7, 7:46 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall\nMaya:\nBoy am I stuffed...\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it's alright to eat that much before your training?\nMaya:\nWell, this kind of training is a battle of endurance.\nPearl:\nMystic Maya... Please don't do anything that might put your health at risk.\nMaya:\nHa ha ha. No pain, no gain, I guess.\nPearl:\nNngh... I'm still worried about you...\nBikini:\nWell, well, well. Let's not dilly-dally shilly-shally. You must get ready for tonight.\nElise:\nGood luck. ...Maya.\nMaya:\nAlright! Here I go! I'll see you all tomorrow, I guess!\nBikini:\nIris, please ring the bell at 10:00 for lights out, alright?\nIris:\nYes, Sister Bikini.\nBikini:\nAnd then, after you ring the bell, I want you to come join us at the Training Hall.\nIris:\nI understand, Sister Bikini.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya and Bikini really seem excited about this training thing tonight...)\nElise:\n...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?\nPearl:\nWell, umm...\nElise:\nIf you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.\nPearl:\nR-Really!? I'd love to! I, umm... I'm not very good at reading.\nElise:\nHa ha ha. Well then, would you like to practice reading with me?\nPearl:\nAh! I'd love to!\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is absolutely smitten with Ms. Deauxnim...) So Larry, what are you going to do?\nButz:\nHuh... Me? Um, well... I'm just gonna hang out in my room. I can't stand the cold at all.\nPhoenix:\n(I totally hear you there.)\nPearl:\nUm, Ms. Elise? So, for example, how do you read this?\nElise:\nIt says, \"gravely\"... That's kind of a tough word.\nPearl:\nOh! OK! And what about this word?\nElise:\nThat's another tough one. It says, \"roast\".\nPhoenix:\n(What kind of a book is she reading anyway...?)\nPearl:\nWell, I'm going to go wash the dishes and help clean up. I'll go visit you when I'm done, Ms. Elise!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, not much to do except head to my room and huddle under the covers, I guess...)\nFebruary 7, 9:12 PMHazakura TempleMain Hall\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... It's a whole different type of cold up here in the mountains! Argh... Why couldn't the nearest bathroom be just a little closer to my room...?)\n???:\n...Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYaaaaaaah! Oh! Ah, Ms. Deauxnim! Are you going to use the bathroom, too?\nElise:\nUm, no. But... Have you seen Pearl?\nPhoenix:\nNo... Not since after dinner. I thought she said she was going to go to your room...\nElise:\nI know... But she never showed up. I-I'm going to go look for her. ...Excuse me.\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. Elise Deauxnim... A woman as mysterious in origin as her last name... But... The really mysterious one is...)\nIris:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nAh...! S-Sister Iris...!\nIris:\nG... G-Good evening...\nPhoenix:\n(The real mysterious one is this girl...!)\nIris:\nUm, are you on your way to the bathroom too, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(...I can't let this chance pass me by! I should try to talk with her... And maybe get some answers.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nIris:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nIs something wrong?\nIris:\nI-I didn't realize it was so late. I have to go and ring the bell for lights out...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it's almost 10:00 now, huh?)\nIris:\n... Um... Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes?\nIris:\nIf it's alright with you... I would like you to have this.\nPhoenix:\nBut this is your hood...\nIris:\nIt has the power to protect you from evil spirits.\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, Sister Bikini was wearing one of these, too...)\nIris:\nI pray for your safety on this dark, cold night.\nIris's Hood received from Iris.\nIris:\nI'm sorry, but I must bid you goodnight.\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute, Sister Iris...\nIris:\nY-Yes...?\nPhoenix:\nJust now, you called me by my name... You said, \"Mr. Wright\". How did you know my name? I never introduced myself to you.\nIris:\nTh-That's...\nPhoenix:\n...Sister Iris. Please, tell me the truth. You and I... Have we ever met before?\nIris:\n...\n5 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nI-Iris...\nIris:\nO-Oh! It-It's almost 10:00... Perhaps we can speak again... tomorrow.\n*gong* *gong* *gong*\nPhoenix:\n(So my hunch was correct... She does know me... I'll have to try to talk with her again tomorrow... ......... ...... ...)\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

That blood-curdling scream came from the courtyard!)\nFebruary 7, 11:06 PMHazakura TempleCourtyard\nPhoenix:\n(That scream... I'm sure it came from around here...) ...Aaaah! (S-Someone's there... On the ground...!) M-Ms. Deauxniiiiiim!\n...*squish*\nPhoenix:\n(...I just stepped on something soft.)\nBikini:\nHey! Don't step on my tummy like that!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you doing lying there in the snow!?\nBikini:\nI was passed out! What do you think!?\nPhoenix:\nSo that blood-curdling scream was you...?\nBikini:\nF-Forget about that! H-Hurry up and call the police!\nPhoenix:\nIs there even a phone in the Main Hall?\nBikini:\nNo, but we still get reception up here in the mountains! You must have a cell phone on you, right!?\nPhoenix:\nI, um... I didn't bring it with me--\nBikini:\nOh, you're useless! I mean, even Iris has a cell phone... We've got no choice! You'll have to use the public phone by Dusky Bridge! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Run as fast as you can!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, ma'am...\nBikini:\nIf you don't hurry, Iris will... Iris will...!\nFebruary 7, 11:18 PMDusky Bridge\nPhoenix:\n...*huff*...*huff*... (It's farther than I thought. The bridge is just up ahead. I have to go tell Maya what happened, too!) ............ ...Aaaaaaaaaah! Dusky Bridge...! It's burning down!

I almost had a heart attack!\nButz:\nMy name isn't Larry! It's Laurice!\nPhoenix:\nLarry, hurry up and call the police! I'm going to the Inner Temple!\nButz:\nD-Don't be stupid! The bridge is nothing but a burning wreck right now!\nPhoenix:\nListen to me! There's been a murder! Here! At Hazakura Temple!\nButz:\nWha-Whaaaaat!?\nPhoenix:\nThe murderer might have fled across the bridge! I have to make sure Maya is safe!\nButz:\nB-B-But...\nPhoenix:\nPlease! Call the police! I've got to go! ...Get outta my way, Larry!\nButz:\nIt-It's too dangerous! Nick, w-wait!\nPhoenix:\n(I must have been crazy... I knew how dangerous it was, but I still went for it...)\n...*crack!*...\nPhoenix:\nAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!\nButz:\nNiiiiiick----!\nPhoenix:\n(Weakened even more by the fire, the rickety old bridge's planks snapped and gave way.

This is nothing more than a terrible nightmare... I'll just roll over and...)\nButz:\nW-Wait! Don't hang up! ...It's an emergency! It's Nick! H-He... He took a really nasty spill!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, it wouldn't be the first time, so...\nButz:\nI'm not joking! His life is in danger!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What...!? What happened!? Tell me!\nButz:\nTalk about a guy with bad luck! He may already be dead! Anyway, you've got to come back! You're the only one that can help! My Iris... My beautiful Iris! She needs help...!\nEdgeworth:\nAlright. I don't know what's going on, but... I'll be there as soon as I can.\nButz:\nI-I'm at the detention center! Please! Hurryyyyyy!\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nEdgeworth:\n(It's been one year since I left that country... I thought I wouldn't have to see him again for a while... Sounds like it won't be a pretty reunion... As if I expected anything to change.)\nFebruary 8, 2:19 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nButz:\nYou're late, Edgey! What took you so long!?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't want to hear it! I chartered a private jet to come as quickly as I could!\nButz:\nWell, you should've chartered a faster one! Anyway, just listen! Something happened to Ms. Elise... and Nick is... Maya... and Iris's Bikini... ...Huh? Say something, Edgey!\nEdgeworth:\n...Before I came here, I stopped in at the hospital where Wright is. I believe I have a better understanding of the situation than you, at this point. The murder victim was the picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. She was found by Wright and the head nun. The suspect is the temple's younger nun. Then later, while Wright was crossing the bridge, it broke and he fell into the river. The hospital says that he'll need at least 2 days of bed rest.\nButz:\nY-Yes! Th-That's right! You got it! B-But they arrested her... My sweet little Iris!\nEdgeworth:\n(And here I was, convinced HE was the one the police had arrested...) However... I still don't understand what these two items are for.\nButz:\nWhat are you talking about?\nEdgeworth:\nThey're things Wright gave to me when I was leaving his room. (This is the first... He said some nonsense about being able to see into people's hearts with this... And the other... He couldn't possibly be asking what I think he is... could he?)\nButz:\nI'm begging you! Iris's trial starts tomorrow! With Nick out of the picture, you're all I've got left! You're the only one that can represent her!\nEdgeworth:\n... What did you just say?\nButz:\nYou know! REPRESENT! DEFEND! What were you expecting!? Why do you think I called you anyway!?\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm a prosecutor, Larry. A prosecutor. Do YOU understand what I'm saying? A prosecutor is a lawyer who...\nButz:\nDon't talk to me like a kid! I graduated from junior high, you know! Don't worry about it! I promise I won't tell!\nEdgeworth:\nBut I...\nButz:\nI mean, I heard a paper badge had no problem fooling an entire court before!\nEdgeworth:\n(...How could this country's judicial system have fallen into such decay!?)\nButz:\nPlease, Edgey! At least listen to her... Listen to Iris's side of the story!\nEdgeworth:\n(So Wright wasn't joking when he gave me this badge after all...)\nIris:\nThank you for coming. ...My name is Iris.\nEdgeworth:\n...Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth. I don't know if I can be of any help, but... ...I will at least hear what you have to say. ...About the murder.\nIris:\nUm...\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nIris:\nM-Mr. Wright! H-H-How is he? Mr. Laurice said that he... That he might even die...\nEdgeworth:\n... Fortunately, he will be fine. (Larry, you moron! How could you say something like that!?) He was badly bruised when he hit the water, but otherwise he is unharmed.\nIris:\n... Thank goodness...\nEdgeworth:\nBut, he's caught some kind of nasty cold.\nIris:\nA cold...?\nEdgeworth:\nHe's running a high fever and is drifting in and out of consciousness.\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n(I must be imagining things. This woman... I feel like I've met her before...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... It appears that's about all that you can tell me.\nIris:\nThank you very much for listening to my story.\nEdgeworth:\n...I visited Wright at the hospital before coming here. He asked me to take care of you...\nIris:\n...M-Me?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, at the trial tomorrow... He asked me to defend you.\nIris:\n... If Mr. Wright has that much faith in you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...Then I will gladly entrust my fate in your capable hands.\nEdgeworth:\nBut before that, I have one question.\nIris:\nYes?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know Wright?\nIris:\nEr... Wh-Why would you ask that?\nEdgeworth:\nWhenever you came up in our conversation, he would begin to act a little... strange.\nIris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth... What is Mr. Wright to you? (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... Are you his friend?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\n...He is a very dear and indispensable friend. (Changed from [Friend? Well... In a sense, yes.] in the original release)\nIris:\n... It was 5 years ago... That's when I... That's when I... deceived him.\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"deceived\" him...?\nIris:\nI heard that he was... in a lot of pain after what happened. I know what a weak person I am. That's why... That's why I thought it was best if he never saw me again. I wanted him to just forget about me, without learning the truth.\nEdgeworth:\n... Well, if you ask me, Wright is still suffering... And until he learns the truth, I don't think he will ever be able to truly recover. ...Iris. It's not too late. You should go to him. ...Tell him the truth.\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nI'll defend you, but only if you agree to that one condition.\nIris:\n... Alright, Mr. Edgeworth... I promise.\nEdgeworth:\n...Very well. I'll do everything in my power to get you an acquittal. (That's enough information gathering for now. I should head to the crime scene...)\nFebruary 8Dusky Bridge\nEdgeworth:\n(It sure is cold alright... So this is it... Dusky Bridge...)\n???:\nOh, wow! It's you, Mr. Edgeworth! (Changed from [Ahem! M-Mr. Edgeworth!] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nNngh... Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Urk... Detective Gumshoe.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nLong time no see! It's been about a year? ...Or has it been longer?\nEdgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter, Detective. What does matter is why you're shuffling around up here.\nGumshoe:\nOh, ouch! ...And there's that sharp left jab! (Changed from [Oh, ouch! ...And there was a sharp left jab!] in the original release) Well, I'm happy to see you anyway, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nLet me guess... You were transferred by HR to the local precinct? (Changed from [Let me guess... You were transferred into another section at work.] in the original release) A wise decision. The vast amount of nothing up here should be quite easy to guard. (Changed from [A good choice. The vast amount of nothing up here must be quite easy to guard.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nI heard you were back in the country and arranged to come all the way out here! Everybody was real nice. They even let me take charge of the investigation, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Gumshoe indeed! Like gum on your shoe, he's impossible to get rid of!)\nGumshoe:\nI'm supposed to report on the details of the crime scene, sir! Anyway! Here I am! Detective Dick Gumshoe! Reporting for duty!\nEdgeworth:\n...Great. Um, thank you, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nI thought Prosecutor Godot was gonna get here before me. That guy's a real mystery, I tell you!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Prosecutor Godot?)\nFebruary 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like Iris is being interrogated right now.) ...This place certainly brings back memories.\nGumshoe:\nOh yeah. Come to think of it, you got thrown in here once too, didn't you, sir? But you know what? I've never been in jail a single time!\nEdgeworth:\n(I should think it's hard to land in jail when you're so harmless...) Yes, well... If you're in jail, you don't have to pay for your own meals, you know.\nGumshoe:\n...*gasp!* ...\nEdgeworth:\nDon't get any funny ideas, Detective...!\nGumshoe:\n...Too late, I already did.\nEdgeworth:\n(In any case... I guess I'll have to come back here later...)\nFebruary 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate\nButz:\nYo! Edgey! What took you so long!? I'm so cold, my brain's turned to sherbet.\nEdgeworth:\n...I knew it was a mistake to race back to this country.\nButz:\nWh-What do you mean...?\nEdgeworth:\nWright is going to be fine, and the case itself isn't anything unusual... And I find myself taking a request to defend a woman accused of murder!\nGumshoe:\n...H-Hey! Wait a sec! Hold it! Objection! What's going on here, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nUm, it's hard to explain, but one thing led to another and...\nButz:\nWhat kind of lame excuse is that!? And you call yourself a defense attorney!?\nGumshoe:\nProsecutor Edgeworth is a prosecutor, and that's why he's Prosecutor Edgeworth! \"Prosecutor Edgeworth, Defense Attorney\" just sounds plain old weird, pal! ...Right, Prosecutor Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm not sure what role I'm supposed to be playing anymore.)\nButz:\nHmph! Dude, Edgey... (Changed from [Hmph! Dude, Edgey... I don't see you for a couple of years...] in the original release) I don't see you for a couple of years, and your heart turns to sherbet! (Changed from [...and your heart turns to sherbet!] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\n...I'd say more like sorbet. It is rather cold here.\nButz:\nIris didn't murder her! Someone else did it! I just know it, OK!? So trust me on this one!\nEdgeworth:\nEver the romantic, aren't you, Larry? Nevertheless, I'll do whatever I can to prove her innocence. (At least until I pass the baton on to Wright, that is.)\nFebruary 8Hazakura TempleMain Hall\nBikini:\n*sigh*\nGumshoe:\nHey! Hello there! Um, so how are you feeling?\nBikini:\nAlright, I suppose. ...Huh? Who is this?\nEdgeworth:\nI... My name is... Miles Edgeworth.\nBikini:\nMy my my. A handsome boy such as yourself is always welcome! *sigh* If circumstances weren't so tragic, I might just...\nEdgeworth:\n(Please don't call me \"boy\".) I'm sorry to trouble you... But I'm looking for a woman in a bikini.\nBikini:\nWell, you have found her. Now, what can I do for you?\nEdgeworth:\n... I'm sorry, but I don't see any bikinis...\nBikini:\nHa ha ha! If you ask nicely, I might give you a peek, big boy. Wa ha ha ho ho ho!\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth? This is the head nun, Sister Bikini... She's the witness.\nEdgeworth:\n... Why didn't you tell me that earlier!? This is exactly why your salary keeps on getting cut!\nGumshoe:\nNngh... My stomach is already growling in protest...\nBikini:\nSo... Um... What's the latest about my beloved Iris!?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, first... I want to hear what you know.\nMain Gate (before clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple - Main Gate)\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Hazakura Temple  - Main Gate:\nFebruary 8Hazakura TempleMain Gate\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm.

What a thorn in my side.)\nFebruary 8Hazakura TempleCourtyard\nGumshoe:\nAnd this is where the murder took place, sir! Other than removing the body, we left everything else untouched!\nEdgeworth:\nThanks, Detective. I'll just have a look around. (It looks like the police are still investigating...)\nGumshoe:\nOh yeah, by the way... I thought I'd better ask, just to be sure... Are you really gonna defend that nun, Iris, at the trial tomorrow?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitment. (Changed from [Yes, I will... I gave her my word and now I must follow through with my commitments.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell, in that case... I've gotta be careful... Gotta make sure I don't leak the prosecution's whole investigation...\nEdgeworth:\nDon't worry about it, Detective. Just keep your mouth closed and I think most of it will flow out on its own.\nGumshoe:\n... You got it, sir! I'll make sure it flows out like water from a tap! (Changed from [Roger, sir! I know exactly what you're saying!] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nY-Yes, you do that, Detective. (Just how much has your runny spout leaked over the years?)

It's still better than the view from my apartment, though.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk! Someone's here! Hide yourself, Detective!\n???:\nOh! Why why why!? Why does this always happen!?\nButz:\nWhenever I find a girl I like, they always run away! I even chased one of them to Japan... Next it's going to be prison, I guess. (Changed from [I even chased one of them to Tibet... Next it's going to be prison, I guess.] in the original release) ...I'll steal that detective's wallet. That'll get me locked up for sure. ...Nah. I can't do that to someone who looks like he's down on his luck.\nGumshoe:\n...He's just talking to himself.\nEdgeworth:\nShh! Be quiet and listen!\nButz:\nI knew it... I shouldn't have done that!

Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes?\nIris:\nYou are a prosecutor... aren't you? Are you sure about this? If your true identity is revealed...\nEdgeworth:\nDon't worry.

(Changed from [Y-You have...?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\n...Iris. It is a prosecutor's job to doubt people.\nIris:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nBut right now... I am a defense attorney.

However, the same cannot be said for the prosecution in this case.\nEdgeworth:\n...Indeed.\nJudge:\nI'm not sure I like such blatant waste of this court's time. An empty prosecutor's chair can only mean... ...that the prosecutor has no confidence in their ability to prove their case. It would seem this case is already over before it had a chance to begin. I am ready to announce my verdict at this time. This court finds the defendant...\n???:\n???:\nThe prosecution... stands ready.\nJudge:\nA-And you are...?\nvon Karma:\nFranziska von Karma... Prosecuting prodigy.\nJudge:\nV-Von Karma, you say...? Perchance, you wouldn't be of any relation to the legendary prosecutor Manfred von Karma?\nvon Karma:\n... Legends are a thing of the past. I am a Von Karma. That is all. Upon a special request, I flew in today for the purposes of prosecuting this case.\nJudge:\nY-You did!? Then... you must be quite a big shot, eh! By the way, Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI'm almost certain that I've seen you somewhere before. Or am I just imagining things? You look very much like a prosecutor I met once...\nEdgeworth:\n...I believe you are imagining things, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nMs. von Karma? Do you have anything to say?\nvon Karma:\n... There is no such weakling as this man among those of the Prosecutor's Office.\nJudge:\nThere... there isn't...? But I'm sure... once before, in this courtroom... Ack!\nvon Karma:\n...I told you, there is no such weakling!\nJudge:\nWh-What is that!? A whip!? I'm not sure I care for such a thing in my courtroom! B-Bailiff! Remove that whip, at...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...I have no objection to the whip.\nJudge:\nY-You don't...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution can wield a whip or drink seventeen cups of coffee... But there is still only one truth. That is what I stand here to prove today!\nvon Karma:\nThis promises to be interesting... Miles Edgeworth. ...I had expected to face Phoenix Wright here today. But looking at you now... ...maybe this is what I have been waiting for all this time. Miles Edgeworth! I will not allow this chance to crush you slip through my fingers!\nEdgeworth:\n...I see you brought your flair for the histrionic.\nJudge:\nAllow me to add to the things I'm not sure about... People acting bizarrely in my court! Uwa-hah!\nvon Karma:\n...The stage is set. Now continue with the proceedings, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nVery well. Ms. von Karma, please give an outline of this case. With as little whipping as possible!\nvon Karma:\nThe murder victim is the famed picture book author, Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Her body was found in the Hazakura Temple courtyard. She had been stabbed through the torso by a ceremonial sword from a golden statue.\nJudge:\nThe sword in this picture... is the weapon in question, correct...? ...Very well. The court accepts this photo of the crime scene.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nvon Karma:\nThere is no mistake. This was the doing of Sister Iris. After all... there is a witness to her crime.\nJudge:\n...Very well. Please bring this witness to the stand!\nEdgeworth:\n(And so it begins... My first and my last trial... as a defense attorney!)\nvon Karma:\n...Witness. State your name and occupation. Please.\nJudge:\nH-Hold on here! I'm not sure about being not sure if I care for this at all! Witness! Please stand up nice and straight!\nEdgeworth:\nIf I recall correctly... ...there are a few milk crates in the Defendant's Lobby for our back pain-plagued witness. (Changed from [...there are a few milk crates in the defendant's lobby for witnesses with bad backs.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nBailiff! Fetch a crate for this poor lady, please!\nvon Karma:\n...Once again. Your name and occupation, please.\nBikini:\nLittle old me? Well, I'm the head nun of Hazakura Temple on Eagle Mountain. My name is Bikini. You got it? Bikini. Nice to meet everyone.\nJudge:\n... But you don't appear to be wearing a bikini right now... Uwah!\nvon Karma:\n...The courtroom is the garden of holy judgment. Those with lechery in their hearts should leave this sanctuary at once!\nJudge:\nY-You want me to leave!?\nBikini:\nNo need to get your bikinis in a twist! Let me tell you, I'm a sight to behold in summer! Wha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha!\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... Witness. I hear that you saw the crime take place on the night in question.\nBikini:\nThat's right! I can still hardly believe it myself, to be honest. There's no way dear little Iris could do anything like that...\nJudge:\nLet us hear what you have to say then. First, tell us aboot your own movements that night, eh!\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Night of the Murder --\nBikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was simply coincidence that you found yourself returning to Hazakura Temple?\nBikini:\n...Yes, you could say that. If my back hadn't been in so much pain, I would have stayed at the Inner Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n(That sounds like a pretty important statement she just made...)\nvon Karma:\nThere is only one problem with this testimony that I can see... And you're not about to fall at the first hurdle, now are you, Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. ...Please begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- The Night of the Murder --\nBikini:\nThat night I was helping an acolyte with her training in the Inner Temple. But...\nBikini:\nWell, as you can see, my back likes to act up. Violently.\nBikini:\nSo, I left Iris to help the acolyte, and returned to Hazakura Temple.\nBikini:\nIris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner.\nBikini:\nThere's no bath at the Inner Temple, you see, and I needed a long, hot soak.\nBikini:\nIt was after I had finished, just as I was heading back... that's when I saw it!\nEdgeworth:\n(There is indeed only one problem with this testimony. If I can clearly point out what it is, then I can begin to quantify... ...just how good this witness's memory and observation skills are.)\nEdgeworth:\n...Witness. Let's get one thing straight. The defendant whom you claim to have met... ...she was wearing this \"Demon-Warding Hood\", correct?\nBikini:\nOf course! That is a very important piece of clothing, I'll have you know! Wha ha ha! Wha ha ha! Ha ha... Wait a minute...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nH-Hold it right there! Why do you have that...!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's the question of the day, now isn't it... Ms. von Karma? I'll have you know that this hood was given to someone as a gift that night. Before the lights out bell was rung.\nvon Karma:\nW... What!?\nEdgeworth:\n...You know where I'm going with this, don't you? If the witness had seen the defendant as she claims... ...then the Iris she saw should have been missing this very hood! (Changed from [...the defendant couldn't have been wearing this very hood!] in the original release)\nBikini:\nWell well well!\nEdgeworth:\n(It's not a bad feeling at all, exposing contradictions like this... Now I understand that happy look on Wright's face every time he does it...)\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Witness, your response... Wuahaaa!\nvon Karma:\n...Sister. This hood... You have spare ones around the temple, don't you?\nBikini:\nSpares... Well... I do tend to make too many of them.\nJudge:\nI see... A stockpile. A surplus of hoods, eh?\nBikini:\nEach nun is only given one hood. This should be the only hood that Iris owned...\nJudge:\nHmm... Then this is quite strange! Waaaah!\nvon Karma:\nIf there was a surplus of hoods, then she could have worn one of those! ...There is no contradiction here!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm sorry to break this to you, Ms. von Karma... but you won't get away that easily. Discrepancies such as this will sow seeds in any human heart. The seeds of doubt.)\nJudge:\n...Witness. While I don't wish to call your testimony into doubt... ...you must give every detail with precision.\nBikini:\nI-I'm not sure I'm comfortable going along with this...\nvon Karma:\nSister. You shall continue with your testimony. Tell us what you saw after finishing your bath, on your way back to the Inner Temple!\nEdgeworth:\n(Those seeds of doubt are sprouting in the judge's heart. They just need a little more stimulation to bear fruit... Contradictory stimulation.)\nWitness Testimony\n-- After My Bath --\nBikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.\nJudge:\nYou saw a truly terrible sight, didn't you...? If I was in your place... ...then it would be much like Ms. von Karma whipping Mr. Edgeworth in two in court! And me, seeing it all from this very chair! ...Er, well, something like that.\nEdgeworth:\n(This judge... His imagination is about as vivid and creative as Detective Gumshoe...)\nvon Karma:\nI would look the fool if I commented on such foolishness. Anyway, this case is mine... Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nCalling everyone by their full name... Can't you do something about that habit of yours?\nCross Examination\n-- After My Bath --\nBikini:\nI finished my bath around 11, and I thought I should return to the Inner Temple.\nBikini:\nAnd as I was walking back... I heard a noise from the courtyard. I took a look and...\nBikini:\nIris was...! Oh, Mystic Elise! And with that sword, of all things!\nBikini:\nNow that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on.\nBikini:\nMystic Elise was staying in the corner room, which faces out onto the courtyard.\nBikini:\nThe stabbing I saw must have occurred after she was pushed out of her window.\nEdgeworth:\n(...It doesn't feel like she is lying. This is very powerful testimony, too. She claims to have seen the instant in which the defendant stabbed the victim... There are only two things I can believe in right now... My client, Iris, and my own abilities as a defense attorney.)\nEdgeworth:\n...Impressive logic. That's what I'd like to say, anyway.\nBikini:\nOh please, do! My brain is something else... especially in winter!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... I think you are overlooking one thing. ...Ms. von Karma. Would you be so kind as to take another look at the autopsy report?\nvon Karma:\nT-The autopsy report...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim did fall from a height of 10 feet. ...However. This fall... was after she was killed.\nvon Karma:\nAh...!\nJudge:\nT-That's right! It says \"after death\" right here!\nEdgeworth:\nThe scene the witness claims to have seen is contradictory! If the defendant stabbed and killed the victim there in the courtyard... ...how did the victim then go on to take a ten foot fall!?\nvon Karma:\nAaah!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order! The victim was killed and then fell! If that is the case... ...then the victim must have been killed in her room... Don't you agree?\nvon Karma:\nTh-That is the logical conclusion... Yes, that's right! The victim must have been stabbed by the defendant in her own room! And she was then thrown out of her window down into the courtyard below!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWere there any signs of a struggle in Ms. Deauxnim's room...?\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nShe was stabbed with a sword! That would leave a blood stain, wouldn't you agree?\nJudge:\nW-Well, Ms. von Karma? Was there any blood...? Waaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...No traces of blood were found in the victim's room.\nJudge:\n...Your whip has just caused traces of blood to be found on my glorious playoff beard. However! If there was no blood in the room, then your claim that... Waaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nI'm sure there's no need for me to go over this... ...as I'm sure Your Honor is well aware... ...of when a stab wound produces the most blood.\nJudge:\nWhen it produces the most blood...?\nvon Karma:\nVery little blood is actually lost at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. With the weapon still in place... ...it acts like a lid on the wound.\nJudge:\nThat's true... With the weapon still in the body, there wouldn't be much bleeding... A perfectly reasonable line of thinking!\nvon Karma:\nWe have come to a conclusion then! The victim was thrown out of the window with the sword still in place... This removes all of the contradictions!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I must admit that this is a probable version of events!\nEdgeworth:\n(I'd expect no less from Franziska von Karma... She locates and takes control of every vital point!)\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph...\nJudge:\nIt seems... ...that we need a clearer testimony from the witness. Remove all supposition on your part and tell us only the truth, please! Witness! Please! Remain standing on the crate!\nBikini:\nDon't go selling me short now! The weight of winter snow has bent me out of shape! ...Especially my back and my mood!\nvon Karma:\nSister. Please, give us your testimony. I will give you a vigorous massage once we are finished here.\nEdgeworth:\n(...With the whip?)\nBikini:\n...Oh, boy. Alright, alright...\nWitness Testimony\n-- Further Details --\nBikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.\nI've never seen so much blood before...\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!\nJudge:\nHmm... This all confirms Ms. von Karma's theory...\nvon Karma:\nVon Karmas strive for nothing but perfection. Putting together such facts is nothing for me! You should know that, Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(\"Perfection\" is an impossibility, Franziska von Karma... And I'm here to teach you just that...)\nCross Examination\n-- Further Details --\nBikini:\nWhen I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.\nBikini:\nThinking about it now, I didn't actually see her stab Mystic Elise.\nBikini:\nI saw the instant in which the blade, plunged in to the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\nBikini:\nI've never seen so much blood before...\nBikini:\nThat's when I fainted. You can't blame me, can you?\nBikini:\nAnd when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!\nEdgeworth:\n(There are too many unnatural elements in this case... Why was it necessary to use the Shichishito from the Ami statue as a weapon? Why was the weapon finally placed back in the hand of the statue? If I can expose the flaws in this testimony, perhaps then I will begin to find the truth.)\nEdgeworth:\nSister Bikini. You are a reliable witness... At least, I'd like to think so. But there are too many contradictions here.\nBikini:\nW-What do you mean? You make it sound as though I'm a liar! But... You're a handsome young man, so I'll forgive you.\nvon Karma:\nWhat contradictions are you talking about?\nEdgeworth:\nIn the scene that the witness claims to have seen... ...the weapon was thrust up to its hilt into the victim. Furthermore... the killer withdrew the weapon smoothly from the body. ...However! Both of these are complete impossibilities!\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean...? Please, explain you... Uwaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nExplain yourself!\nEdgeworth:\nTo start with... Do you think it would be possible to stab someone to the hilt with this? No matter how I look at the defendant, she doesn't appear strong enough for that.\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\n\"Doesn't appear\"...? What meaningless dribble! I, too, may appear to be weak and frail... But I can crush men under my heel and make them weep, should I so choose!\nJudge:\nThe objection stands! I wept a little back there, I must admit.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...That isn't the only issue here. If this sword was truly stabbed into the body up to the hilt... Well, just look at all the branches on it. It certainly wouldn't come out smoothly.\nvon Karma:\nT-That's...\nEdgeworth:\nWe also have the problem of the amount of bleeding. It's true that when a blade is left in a body, it acts as a \"plug\" of sorts. However! When the weapon is shaped like this, it's an entirely different story. The wound would be too large for the blade to completely stop from bleeding!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nT-That's nothing more than conjecture! In reality, the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito. Even a weapon of this nature... ...may still sometimes slide out smoothly, and may still sometimes stop the blood loss!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI'm not finished. There is still one more... conclusive contradiction.\nJudge:\nY-You've still got more!?\nEdgeworth:\n...This one is simple. If this sword really was thrust in all the way to the hilt... ...why is there only blood on the tip of it?\nvon Karma:\nAh...!\nEdgeworth:\nIf this witness is telling the truth... Then there should be blood along the entire length of the sword!\nvon Karma:\nNoooooo!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Ord-- Whaaaaaaaa!\nvon Karma:\nBravo... Miles Edgeworth. Raising this many contradictions from a single piece of evidence! All the other attorneys I know could maybe manage one, if that!\nJudge:\nBut what does this all mean!? You have proven contradictions regarding the murder weapon, but...\nEdgeworth:\n...Having come this far, there can only be one answer.\nvon Karma:\nAnd that is...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe weapon used to kill the victim... ...was not the Shichishito!\nJudge:\nW-Whaaaaaaaaat!?\nvon Karma:\nA foolishly foolish idea born from the foolish mind of a foolhardy foolish fool.\nEdgeworth:\nLet's examine this again. What was it that made us think this sword was the murder weapon?\nBikini:\nW-Well... It's because Mystic Ami was holding it...\nEdgeworth:\n...Exactly. However! If you reflect on this, that is the only basis we have to assume such a thing. The impression left by the scene was just too strong. That is what influenced us. It influenced us to believe that the Shichishito was the murder weapon!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Waaaaaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nSo maybe the Shichishito was not the murder weapon. Even if that is the case... it changes nothing, Miles Edgeworth! The Sister here saw everything! She saw the defendant stab the victim with a sword-like object.\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm... That's true! Your response, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n... If that is so... I would like the prosecution to answer the obvious question it raises.\nJudge:\nThe obvious... question?\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. Namely... Where did the real murder weapon disappear to?\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nIt goes without saying that the police searched the Main Hall and the surrounding area. ...Perhaps the prosecution can enlighten us as to if a \"sword-like object\" was found.\nvon Karma:\nT-That's...\nJudge:\nAnswer the question, Ms. von Karma!\nvon Karma:\n... No evidence of that kind was found.\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... Another mystery to throw onto the pile! A trial without a murder weapon is a tricky beast!\nBikini:\nExcuse me... Could I say something...? I just remembered something, actually...\nvon Karma:\n...What is it, Sister?\nBikini:\nI was just thinking... It's possible... ...that just maybe... what actually happened was... it was just over there...\nJudge:\n... What exactly are you going on aboot here?\nBikini:\nThe murder weapon, I mean! Maybe... I think I might know where the sword was disposed of!\nEdgeworth:\nYou what!?\nvon Karma:\nWell then... I think we need to hear testimony from you one more time, Sister.\nEdgeworth:\n(Impossible...! What else... What else could this old woman have seen!?)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Location of the Weapon --\nBikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm... Witness. Please, tell us everything you know right away next time.\nBikini:\nWell. I'm not in the best of shape. What with my back and my age, you know.\nvon Karma:\nQuite... There were indeed snowmobile tracks in front of the Main Gate. Here is a photograph.\nJudge:\nA snowmobile, eh... I see. Well, it certainly is an interesting theory...\nvon Karma:\nThe tracks begin in front of Hazakura Temple... ...and run all the way to Dusky Bridge!\nTracks Photo added to the Court Record.\nvon Karma:\n...That solves your pesky little problem, yes? The Eagle River's current is quite swift, meaning that it doesn't freeze over in winter. Making it the perfect place to dispose of the murder weapon!\nEdgeworth:\n(Did she really go to the river to dispose of the murder weapon...?)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! ...Your cross-examination, please.\nCross Examination\n-- Location of the Weapon --\nBikini:\nI saw the murder at around 11 PM...\nBikini:\nAnd after asking that it be reported, I went out to the Main Gate.\nBikini:\nAnd there... I saw tracks! Tracks that indicated the snowmobile had been used!\nBikini:\nIt takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those!\nBikini:\nMaybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?\nBikini:\n...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...\nEdgeworth:\n(Another mystery to feed the fire... \"Was there any reason to go and throw away the murder weapon\"...? Luckily, there is surely a problem with this testimony. Now all I have to do is start poking holes in this flawed account...)\nEdgeworth:\nI admit this photograph proves something. It proves that the snowmobile was used on the night of the murder.\nvon Karma:\nYou've finally accepted the inevitable, it seems... Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... If what the witness says is true, why is there only one set of tracks?\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you mean...?\nEdgeworth:\nIris left Hazakura Temple, threw the weapon into the river, and then returned. If this was the case, then naturally there should be two sets of tracks in the snow! Those from heading out to the bridge, and those from coming back.\nBikini:\n... Ah...! You're right!\nvon Karma:\nHmph... You are forgetting one thing, Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nvon Karma:\nOn the night of the murder, it was snowing. The tracks leading to the bridge were erased by the snowfall. This removes your precious contradiction, now doesn't it!\nJudge:\nI see! While she was at the river, the snow stopped... ...leaving just the return tracks in the snow.\nvon Karma:\nWhat do you have to say now, Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is there a flaw in her theory...? This idea that the snowfall covered one set of tracks...?)\nEdgeworth:\nThe tracks to the river were covered by snow... What a nice theory. However, Ms. von Karma... That is impossible.\nvon Karma:\n... Would you care to explain... ...why there is a rude index finger currently pointed in my general direction?\nEdgeworth:\n...No need. The evidence will do all of the talking for me.\nJudge:\nOn the night of the murder the killer went to, and returned from, Dusky Bridge... ...in order to dispose of the murder weapon. The outgoing tracks were erased by snow. ...Or so claims Ms. von Karma. Mr. Edgeworth! Present your evidence to the contrary, eh! Evidence that the outgoing tracks were not covered by snow!\nEdgeworth:\nUltimately, it all comes down to one point. That being... Whether or not it was snowing in that courtyard when the victim was stabbed...\nvon Karma:\nThat's right. But proving that is...\nEdgeworth:\nIncredibly easy.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nIf we want to know whether it was snowing or not, this photo will tell us everything. Of course, I am referring to the photo of the crime scene. As you can see... everything is covered with snow. ...With just one exception.\nvon Karma:\nAnd that is...?\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim herself, Ms. Elise Deauxnim! Why is there no snow on top of her...? The answer is simple! It had stopped snowing when she was killed, that's why!\nvon Karma:\nGnnngh!\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words! If the killer really did go to the Eagle River to dispose of the murder weapon... ...then in this photograph, there should be two sets of tracks!\nvon Karma:\nAaaaah!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Just what are you... Gyahaah!\nvon Karma:\nJ-Just what are you suggesting, Miles Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\n(To be honest... I am not entirely sure myself. But...) This is simply what all of the facts point to. That night... someone used the snowmobile to leave Hazakura Temple. From the tracks left, it can be understood that they were heading for Dusky Bridge. At that time... it was still snowing.\nvon Karma:\nOf course it was. Because those tracks were erased by the snow. (Changed from [Of course it was. Because those tracks were gone.] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nThen when this person returned to Hazakura Temple... ...the snow had stopped. Thus, the return tracks remained.\nJudge:\nHmmmmm...\nBikini:\nCan I say something? This all sounds a bit fishy to me...\nvon Karma:\n...What does, Sister?\nBikini:\nThere is only one key for the snowmobile.\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nvon Karma:\nFurthermore, on the night in question, we know that the defendant had it! The key was found in her room after the murder!\nBikini:\n...Which can only mean, that night... Iris used the snowmobile to go to the Inner Temple...\nEdgeworth:\n(But... Iris said that she never went there... I should probably press on this point some more when I get the chance...)\nBikini:\nThe snowmobile can't cross the suspension bridge... So, she must have left it on the Hazakura side of the bridge and crossed on foot.\nJudge:\n...That sounds right.\nBikini:\nBut... What's odd is, when I left Iris and returned to Hazakura Temple... I didn't see anything near Dusky Bridge.\nvon Karma:\nY-You must have just failed to see it, Sister.\nBikini:\nMaybe... But when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean. I know what I saw. It was covered in snow, too...\nEdgeworth:\nB-But that... isn't possible!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order in the court! ...What does this all mean?\nvon Karma:\n...Nngh...\nEdgeworth:\nSo then what was the snowmobile used for...? It wasn't taken by the defendant when she went to the Inner Temple. If it had been, then the witness couldn't possibly have seen it by the gate. Furthermore... it wasn't used by the killer to dispose of the murder weapon. If that was the case, there should be two sets of tracks in this photo. All we know is this... After it stopped snowing... someone used the snowmobile to return to Hazakura Temple!\nJudge:\nHmmmmmm...\nEdgeworth:\n(I never thought a simple snowmobile could cause so much trouble...)\nJudge:\n... I think we've learned all we can from this witness... (Changed from [I think we've arrived at this point due to the witness...] in the original release)\nBikini:\nYes, yes. I've nothing more to add. I've told you everything -- everything that I know.\nJudge:\nBut then... that still leaves us with the same problem. (Changed from [Well then... That still leaves us with the same problem.] in the original release) If only there was someone... A witness who could testify to having seen the snowmobile!\nEdgeworth:\n(A witness, huh...)\nJudge:\nWas there no one out, walking perhaps, near Dusky Bridge on that night?\nBikini:\n... I don't think that's likely. It was cold enough to freeze your ears off. Only an idiot would go out wandering in that. ...Unless they had something really important to do.\nJudge:\nHmmmm... That's a shame.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hold on... Something is coming to me... An idiot may well have gone wandering out on that sub-arctic night!) ...Your Honor! Actually... there just might be one individual who may be of help to us. (Changed from [I actually have an idea... There may be one individual able to help us.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nR-Really!?\nvon Karma:\n...You know of someone who might have seen the snowmobile on the night of the murder...?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know for sure if he saw it or not... But there are two things about him that do come to mind.\nJudge:\nWhich are...?\nEdgeworth:\nFirst... that he saw \"something incredible\" on the night of the murder.\nvon Karma:\n...And the second being?\nEdgeworth:\nThis individual that I am thinking of went wandering outside on that cold night... In other words, he is our kind of idiot.\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth! Who is this idiot you're talking aboot!?\nJudge:\nThis guy must be a product of \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Painting\"...\nEdgeworth:\nThis is Larry Butz... The student of the victim, Elise Deauxnim.\nJudge:\nHer student...? Interesting. Why was he wandering on the night of the murder?\nEdgeworth:\nT-That's... (I could tell them all about his designs for Iris... But it may cost us his credibility as a witness... Before I even call him.) He is, after all, an artist. He was, perhaps, searching for something in the snowy scenery that would move him. ...Although I cannot guarantee that this is the reason.\nvon Karma:\nAnd so...? This unfortunate, unreliable-looking man... What exactly was it that he saw?\nEdgeworth:\nI intend to extract that from him, right here in this courtroom.\nJudge:\nSummon this youth as a witness immediately!\nvon Karma:\n... I have no choice, do I?\nEdgeworth:\nI believe he is in the gallery for this trial. It will not take long to summon him.\nJudge:\n...Very well.\nEdgeworth:\n(Larry... You may have escaped me yesterday... But today I'm going to get everything out of you!)\nJudge:\n...The court will now adjourn for a 20 minute break. Ms. von Karma, please see to preparing the next witness.\nvon Karma:\n...Understood, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nGood... Well then! Court is now in recess!\nTo be continued.\nFebruary 9, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nIris:\nExcuse me... Mr. Edgeworth? I'm not really sure what to say...\nEdgeworth:\nIris. We only have 20 minutes. There are two things which I need to ask you before we reconvene.\nIris:\n...Alright. I'll help you any way I can.\nEdgeworth:\nFirst, about that night. You really didn't go to the Inner Temple, correct? The last witness claims to have met and talked with you in the Training Hall. Either you or Sister Bikini... ...is lying.\nIris:\n... Mr. Edgeworth. It is just as I said yesterday. Until the incident occurred... I was in my own room, in Hazakura Temple.\nEdgeworth:\n...Very well. The second thing, then. That night, the temple snowmobile was used in between the time Sister Bikini... ...returned to the Main Hall and when she bore witness to the murder. Sometime between 10:30 and 11 PM that night. Were you the one who used the snowmobile?\nIris:\n... There is only one key for the snowmobile. The only person who could have used it... was me.\nEdgeworth:\nSo it was you...! But... why? ...What made you go out to Dusky Bridge?\nIris:\n... I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth.\n5 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nEdgeworth:\nIris...\nIris:\nI can't... tell you about that... yet.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Yet\"...?\nIris:\nNot until her safety is confirmed...\nEdgeworth:\nHer?\nIris:\nThe safety of the acolyte...\nEdgeworth:\n(The \"acolyte\", huh... She's must be talking about Maya...) ... Iris. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Did you kill Elise Deauxnim?\nIris:\n... No matter who or what may come... I could never take a life.\nEdgeworth:\n... (As I thought... no Psycholocks...) ...Very well. It is my job to get to the truth. You'll discover this for yourself soon enough.\nFebruary 9, 11:36 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7\nJudge:\n...Court will now reconvene. Ms. von Karma. Where is the witness...?\nvon Karma:\nDuring the break, a man was detained for suspicious behavior in the gallery.\nEdgeworth:\nSuspicious behavior...?\nvon Karma:\nHe was sketching something... Very intensely.\nJudge:\nDare I ask what the witness was sketching when he was detained?\nvon Karma:\nHe drew a terrifying woman, armed with a demonic face and a vicious whip.\nJudge:\n... I can only presume that his intention was to capture you-- ...Aaaah!\nvon Karma:\nAnyway, it's time to drag this pathetic excuse for an artist before the court! Laurice Deauxnim! I hope you're ready... Get in here!\nEdgeworth:\n(It would seem that whip is going to see plenty more use today...)\nButz:\nOuch!\nvon Karma:\n...Your sketch is in contempt of this court!\nButz:\nH-Hey! I was just artistically rendering... Ou-Ouch!\nvon Karma:\nYou tried to run away from the bailiff who was trying to hand you your subpoena, correct?\nButz:\nL-Look! I'm nothing but a fledgling artist, training out in the mountains! I'm only down here in the city because I ran out of green paint. Well, to use the technical term for the color, \"viridian\".\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry... This isn't an art store, now is it...?\nButz:\nI know! I graduated junior high, OK!? Look. Art is all about working in the fields, isn't it?\nJudge:\nWorking in the fields...?\nEdgeworth:\nI presume he wanted to say \"field work\"... I hope.\nButz:\nTh-That's it! Thanks, buddy!\nEdgeworth:\n(It's kind of sad that I was able to understand his mangled train wreck of a sentence...)\nButz:\nI just happened to stop in here and found a wonderful new model!\nvon Karma:\n...\nButz:\nSo see!? I've got nothing to do with this trial! At all! I expect all of your faces to be red when you realize this mistake! Bright red! Or, to use the technical term, \"crimson lake\". ...Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ou-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch!\nJudge:\nOu-Ou-Ou-Ouch! Ouch! Ou-Ouch!\nvon Karma:\nStop your pathetic blabbing and testify like a man!\nJudge:\nRefrain from whipping me, Ms. von Karma! Cross-whipping is as bad as cross-checking. Witness! That was all your fault! Testify, now!\nButz:\nWaaaah... This is almost too much for me...!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Saw --\nButz:\nI was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night.\nI walked to the bridge a number of times, but...\nI didn't see a s-snowmobile!\nI didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release)\nThe girl I was waiting for didn't show up... My teacher died on me...\nI'm all alone now. Aren't I, Edgeyyyyy...!?\nJudge:\nWitness! Please refrain from talking directly to the lawyers during your testimony!\nButz:\nI-I'm just a nobody! Nothing but a small, worthless man, aren't I!? And why wasn't I asked for my name and occupation... or anything else...!?\nJudge:\n... Mr. Edgeworth. This man seems to have quite a severe inferiority complex.\nEdgeworth:\n...He's recently been the cause of numerous incidents. I think he's finally realized for himself... ...just how much of a nuisance he has been to other people!\nButz:\nYeah, that's right! I'm behind everything, every case! Watch out, OK! Just touching me will make you eternally unhappy!\nJudge:\n...Well then, let us proceed with the cross-examination. With no touching, thank you. We can delve into other details at a later time.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Saw --\nButz:\nI was at that lodge out in the mountains, looking up at the stars that night.\nButz:\nI walked to the bridge a number of times, but...\nButz:\nI didn't see a s-snowmobile!\nButz:\nI didn't see anyone at the bridge that night either! (Changed from [I didn't meet anyone at the bridge that night!] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems that he's going to claim to have nothing to do with this to the end. I don't want this guy to cost us any more time... I need to slice through his obvious contradictions and keep things moving along...)\nEdgeworth:\nLarry Butz... I can understand why you might want to throw your old life away. You're pretty pathetic, and you cause all sorts of trouble...\nButz:\nI'm sorry...!\nEdgeworth:\nBut... Having realized just how much of a nuisance you have been... ...that could be considered a step in the right direction.\nButz:\nEdgey! Are you... trying to console me?\nJudge:\nIt certainly doesn't sound that way to me.\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... I cannot forgive you for simply turning away from the incidents you create!\nButz:\nWaaah... You're totally pinning this on me...\nEdgeworth:\n...Now then. Let us talk about the night of the murder. Sister Bikini, after seeing the murder take place, asked Phoenix Wright to report it. Thus, he headed for the public phone by the bridge... There, he happened across a certain nefarious individual! You, Larry Butz!\nButz:\n... That's right. Me, in the flesh.\nJudge:\nHmm... Listen carefully, witness. It doesn't matter if you change your name. So long as you remain pretty pathetic, you will continue to cause these incidents! That reality will not change!\nButz:\nB-But...! What do you want me to do, then!?\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. What you need to change is your inner self. But for now... (Changed from [Larry. What you need to change is your inner self.] in the original release) \"What you saw that night\"... Testifying truthfully about this one issue is all I need from you. (Changed from [Testify truthfully! That is all you can do for now.] in the original release)\nButz:\n... Edgey... I... I think... I've finally woken up! ... Well. I guess I could still be sleeping... But anyway! I'll do it! I'll testify! ... Well. I'm not sure this'll go especially well...\nJudge:\nI'll ask again, then, witness. What did you see on the night of the murder?\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --\nButz:\nI went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...\nI was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!\nI looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!\nThere was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.\nThat's when I ran into Nick.\nJudge:\nHmmmm... You certainly saw quite a lot, didn't you?\nvon Karma:\nSo... what happened to the bridge after it caught on fire?\nButz:\nIt was like me after a three-day stint chasing a girl... It totally burnt out. Like, almost totally gone. ...I mean, trying to cross the burning remains was what caused Nick to fall.\nvon Karma:\nW-What did you say!?\nEdgeworth:\nOh, don't worry... It's nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold. (Changed from [Oh, don't worry... nothing life-threatening. He just caught a cold.] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\n...I never know with that man if he should be called lucky or unlucky... (Changed from [As always, hard to know if he should be called lucky or unlucky...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nNow, Mr. Edgeworth! Please commence your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --\nButz:\nI went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM...\nButz:\nI was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!\nButz:\nI looked out the window... and Dusky Bridge was on fire!\nButz:\nThere was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out.\nButz:\nThat's when I ran into Nick.\nButz:\nI arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later.\nButz:\nI thought I'd never get another chance to see something so big burning!\nEdgeworth:\n(...He told me about the burning bridge yesterday. But there's still something that doesn't quite fit... It looks like... ...despite his change of heart, Larry still isn't telling us the whole truth.)\nEdgeworth:\nYour very existence being a contradiction, I'm not sure if you can grasp this or not...\nButz:\nWhat the hey, Edgey!? You make me sound like some sort of alien!\nEdgeworth:\nBut your testimony is conclusively contradictory. The problem here... is time.\nButz:\nI've never been the best timekeeper, you know. \"Three minutes after Billy leaves on foot, you follow him on your bicycle. How long does it take for you to catch up with him?\" Terrible at those.\nEdgeworth:\n...This is much more simple. You saw the lightning strike Dusky Bridge... ...and immediately went to see what had happened. ...Is this correct?\nButz:\nYeah... Well, I wasted about five minutes first, but more or less.\nEdgeworth:\n...I have the weather data from the night of the murder here. According to this, the lightning fell at 10:45 PM. You say it takes less than five minutes from the shack to Dusky Bridge. Meaning you probably got there at around 11 PM.\nButz:\n...That all sounds about right, I guess. And then Nick showed up and did his falling act.\nEdgeworth:\nThat is impossible.\nvon Karma:\n...What do you mean?\nEdgeworth:\n11 PM is when the murder occurred in Hazakura Temple. Thus... Wright was still there, in the courtyard. There is no way that Larry could have encountered him at Dusky Bridge at that time!\nvon Karma:\n...!\nButz:\nAh! Excuse me! I-I have an objection!\nJudge:\nYou do?\nButz:\nEdgey! How many times do I have to say this!? I'm not Larry! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! Gyaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...It has not been proven that the murder occurred at 11 PM. The Sister only said, \"around 11\". ...In which case! It could have been earlier than that!\nEdgeworth:\n...Watch your footing there, Ms. Franziska von Karma. The slope ahead is slippery! For there is still no way that Wright could have been at Dusky Bridge at 11 PM!\nvon Karma:\nAnd why not!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt is clearly written here in the weather data report. It took around 30 minutes for the bridge to burn out. Therefore! The bridge must have been burning until at least 11:15 PM!\nJudge:\nWhich means... what, exactly?\nEdgeworth:\nWright did not see the bridge as it was burning that night. In fact, he did not arrive on the scene until after the flames had died down! (Changed from [He did not arrive there until after the flames had died down!] in the original release; extra space between [had] and [died] in the Trilogy release) ...Larry! You arrived at the bridge at 11 PM. But Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15... (Changed from [Wright did not make it there until at least 11:15...] in the original release) I suggest you to stop hiding things and just tell us the whole truth. Now, then... (Changed from [Are you still trying to hide something from us!?] in the original release) What happened during these missing 15 minutes!?\nButz:\nUrk... I... I feel like I just got brutally woken up by toilet splashback... (Changed from [I... I feel like I just woke up...] in the original release) I guess I was still sleeping after all! Ha ha ha! Pinch me!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Ordaaaaaaaaagh!\nvon Karma:\n...So there was a missing 15 minutes prior to meeting Phoenix Wright. I hardly see that as much of a problem!\nButz:\nYeah! Not much of a problem at all!\nEdgeworth:\nReally...? The bridge is burning before your eyes, and there is a phone right next to it. Why, then, did you not report the accident?\nJudge:\nYes, witness! Why didn't you!? Were you there simply to watch the bridge burn? (Changed from [Did you simply... watch the bridge burn?] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd therein lies the problem. (Changed from [That is the problem here...] in the original release) For even after the bridge had burnt out, he was still there! (Changed from [Even after the bridge burnt out, he was still there!] in the original release) Staring into space, this witness didn't even attempt to fulfill his civic duty! (Changed from [He simply stood there and didn't report anything.] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nTh-That's what it sounds like...\nEdgeworth:\nAh, but this is Larry we are talking about, and even he is incapable of being so stupid. (Changed from [This might be Larry we are talking about, but even he is incapable of being so stupid.] in the original release) Which means there has to be a reason for his inaction! (Changed from [There has to be a reason for his inaction!] in the original release)\nButz:\n... Edgey... I think it's about time I got serious with you, dude.\nEdgeworth:\n...Just as I thought, you've been playing with us all this time.\nButz:\nListen... I'm... I'm going to tell you everything! Are you sure you want to hear it all!?\nEdgeworth:\nY-Yes...\nButz:\nI may reeeeally say it this time! Everything! Kahaah!\nvon Karma:\n...Then say it!\nJudge:\nVery well... I have a terribly bad feeling aboot this; however... ...let's have the witness finally give us the whole truth. Now... for this 15 minute gap, what where you doing, witness!?\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Missing 15 Minutes --\nButz:\nI'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing?\nSketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art!\nThe shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!\n...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up.\nJudge:\nHmmmmm... I suppose artists can be strange folk...\nButz:\nThat's right! I'm willing to sacrifice everything in order to draw the perfect sketch!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Including the truth, from the sound of it!)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Has this removed the last of your doubts?\nEdgeworth:\nNot at all, Your Honor. One very large doubt still remains.\nJudge:\nAnd what would that be?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a surprisingly believable story, especially considering the source... So why did he think he needed to hide it from us until now? I intend to drag the reason out of him!\nButz:\nHah ha ha! You'll regret this, Edgey!\nCross Examination\n-- The Missing 15 Minutes --\nButz:\nI'm a Deauxnim. I'm an artist! What do you think I was doing?\nButz:\nSketching! In front of the bridge! I was whipped up into a frenzy of art!\nButz:\nI saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!\nButz:\nThe shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!\nButz:\n...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up.\nEdgeworth:\n(There is a big clue waiting for me in this cross-examination... This testimony does nothing less than mock the court... But I am sure that there is a vital kernel of truth hidden in it somewhere!)\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. What did you really see that night...? Not that I particularly care.\nButz:\nIn your position, that's just being irresponsible! I... I drew exactly what I saw! I'll give you a whole dollar that it's the truth!\nEdgeworth:\nIf that is truly the case... Then there is one thing that we can say for certain.\nJudge:\nWhat might that be...?\nEdgeworth:\nThat the person who flew over the bridge... ...could not have been the defendant, Iris!\nButz:\nW-W-What!? What do you mean? I don't understand!? Uwaaagh!\nvon Karma:\nA foolhardy folly of a foolish statement by an equally foolishly foolhardy fool. How, exactly, can you make this claim?\nEdgeworth:\n...Tell us, Larry. According to this picture... ...the individual whom you say you saw was wearing a hood. Correct?\nButz:\nOf course she was! That run-down shack is quite a way from the bridge... The hood is what told me that this floating angel was my Iris! The hood is my darling Iris! And Iris is my darling hood! Waaah!\nvon Karma:\nIt seems there are bigger fools in this world than the one at the defense's bench.\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry, there's something you need to be made aware of. On the night of the murder... Iris wasn't wearing her hood. She had given it to Wright as a gift! Are you going to change your story now? Perhaps suggest it was Wright who took flight!?\nButz:\nW-What are you talking about!?\nEdgeworth:\n...I think you understand what I mean just fine.\nButz:\nWhy...? Why did Nick have Iris's hood!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...? (Changed from [Eh...?] in the original release)\nButz:\nEdgey! What's going on with Iris and Nick!? Why you, Niiiiiick! You dooooooog!\nJudge:\nI do believe... ...that this unbelievably mysterious sketch... ...is destined to disappear, discredited and discarded. Straight into the garbage.\nButz:\n...Hah... Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hagaaah!\nvon Karma:\n...What is it now, witness?\nButz:\nIt feels like... I've been waiting 25 years for this very day to come! Edgey! Today is the day I get to completely stupefy you!\nEdgeworth:\nW-What...!?\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of your outburst, witness!?\nButz:\n...I hate to have to do this, but I have some definitive evidence.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Definitive\"...?\nvon Karma:\n\"Evidence\"...?\nButz:\nIris did indeed come flying over the burning bridge! And I, Laurice Deauxnim... ...shall prove it!\nJudge:\nI didn't expect to ask this again... But we shall be needing your testimony once again. Tell us anything you know concerning the defendant as depicted in this sketch... And show us your evidence that this nightmare was actually a reality!\nButz:\n...OK. I hope you're ready, Edgey! Because I'm going to feed you a whopping serving of pain!\nEdgeworth:\n(...You've been serving us a whopping serving of pain this whole time. Trust me.)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Proof That Iris Flew! --\nButz:\nWhen I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone...\nI was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her!\nThat led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow!\nI'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood.\nAfter all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night.\nJudge:\nA c-crystal sphere...!?\nButz:\nThis one. Pretty, isn't it? But finders keepers!\nvon Karma:\nThat sphere... Where did you find it?\nButz:\nLet me see... Around here, somewhere? Looks about right.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd it was half-buried in the snow...?\nButz:\nIt had pretty much stopped snowing by then... But there was still some falling as I walked to the bridge.\nJudge:\nHmmmm... The court accepts this crystal sphere!\nButz:\n...That's mine, OK!? I want it back afterward!\nJudge:\nHmm... There's something on it... (Changed from [There's something on it, isn't there...] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\n...?\nJudge:\nOh my... It's blood! (Changed from [Oh my... It's a blood stain!] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\n(What!? Blood...!?) (Changed from [What!? A blood stain...!?] in the original release)\nCrystal Sphere added to the Court Record.\nButz:\nYou ready, Edgey!? By tomorrow morning, you'll be calling me \"Master Larry\"! Yeah, I like the sound of that! No one's going to push me around anymore!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Didn't you want to be called \"Laurice Deauxnim\" only a few minutes ago!?)\nCross Examination\n-- Proof That Iris Flew! --\nButz:\nWhen I reached Dusky Bridge she was already gone...\nButz:\nI was so worried! So I frantically searched all over for her!\nButz:\nThat led to me finding a beautiful crystal sphere, half-buried in the snow!\nButz:\nI'm sure that Iris was simply wearing a spare hood.\nButz:\nAfter all, no one else could have lost a crystal sphere that night.\nEdgeworth:\n(This case isn't going to end without a fight... Exposing the obvious contradictions in this testimony will be easy... But I fear that all that awaits us are further mysteries!)\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry. That night... There was someone. Someone who lost a crystal sphere.\nButz:\nTh-There was...? Who!? Who was this stupid idiot!?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Elise Deauxnim! The mentor to a stupid idiot!\nvon Karma:\nThe victim...!?\nEdgeworth:\nI have a photo of her here. And on the end of her staff, you can see a familiar looking crystal sphere.\nButz:\nH-Hey...! That's my photograph! ...Give it back! Ou-Ou-Ouuuuch!\nvon Karma:\n...A crystal sphere like that is quite easy to find. I have one just like it on my broach.\nEdgeworth:\n(They look nothing alike!) In any case... please take a look at this. This is the victim's staff, found at the scene of the crime!\nJudge:\n...Aaaaah! The crystal sphere... It's gone!\nButz:\nW-W-W-W... What!? What!? What!? What!? WHAAAAAAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nJ-Just what does this mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nIf anyone jumped... or flew across the bridge that night... ...it certainly was not Iris! After all... She was not wearing her hood! More importantly... ...the crystal sphere found at the \"landing site\" was not hers either!\nJudge:\nT-That means... The one who flew... ...and dropped the sphere... was the victim, Ms. Elise Deauxnim!?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nA fool alongside another fool, on a fool's errand to reach a foolish conclusion! First of all, this \"sketch\", which I prefer to call a \"scribble\", is ridiculous! People cannot fly! ...Thus, it is rejected!\nButz:\nY-You can't do that! I saw it! With my own two-- Eyeeeeeeiiiz!\nvon Karma:\n...And this crystal sphere. This is nothing more than a red herring!\nEdgeworth:\nYou honestly believe that...?\nvon Karma:\nGive it some thought, and I'm sure you'll realize it as well, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim was in her room on the night of the murder. There was no reason for her to go to Dusky Bridge! Therefore, this sphere cannot be related to this case. That is all.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...Ms. Franziska von Karma. The only people who will accept that explanation... are scatterbrains and clowns!\nButz:\nWhy are you pointing at me!?\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim's crystal sphere was found near the bridge on the night of her murder. Yet you expect us to believe this has nothing to do with the case!?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nThat crystal sphere... It was probably thrown away at the bridge after the murder.\nJudge:\nAfter the murder?\nvon Karma:\nThere is blood on the crystal sphere, isn't there? This naturally suggests that it was thrown away after the murder took place. The killer placed it there to throw the investigation off the scent... Which is the exact same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch! (Changed from [The same reason that he drew that ridiculous sketch!] in the original release)\nButz:\n... ...... What...? You mean... I'm the killer!? No waaaagh!\nvon Karma:\nAll joking aside... (Changed from [Enough joking...] in the original release) Just when did this crystal sphere appear near the foot of the bridge? Unless this can be proven in some way, I refuse to believe this is related to the case!\nEdgeworth:\n(She makes a valid point... There is no evidence that Elise Deauxnim left Hazakura Temple that night. ...However, if somehow this crystal sphere... ...can be proven to have been dropped before the victim was killed... ...then this case is going to transform into something else entirely!)\nJudge:\nYour response, Mr. Edgeworth? I want your final opinion on the disposition of this crystal sphere! If it is not related to the case, then this witness who you called... ...will have been nothing more than a monumental waste of time!\nvon Karma:\nPrepare yourself for some very appropriate punishment, Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(Can I prove it...? Can I prove that the crystal sphere was dropped before the murder took place...?)\nEdgeworth:\n...Your Honor. Allow me to prove something to you. I will prove that this crystal sphere is a vital link to solving this case!\nJudge:\nYou will do what!?\nvon Karma:\nThat look in your eyes... You remind me of Phoenix Wright when he is cornered.\nEdgeworth:\nThat should come as no surprise. (Because right now, I am Phoenix Wright, and I am indeed cornered...!)\nJudge:\nI order you to present your evidence, Mr. Edgeworth! Evidence that proves that the crystal sphere was indeed dropped before the murder!\nEdgeworth:\nThis crystal sphere... It was half-buried in the snow, correct?\nButz:\nThat's right. If it hadn't stopped snowing then it would have been game over. ...The snow would have totally covered it!\nEdgeworth:\n...That's all I needed to hear from you, Larry. ...Your testimony makes one thing quite clear.\nJudge:\nW-What...?\nEdgeworth:\nWhen the crystal sphere was dropped, it was snowing, even if it was ever so slightly...\nvon Karma:\nSnowing...?\nEdgeworth:\nOn the other hand, let us look at the scene of the murder. As proven earlier today... there is no snow on the victim's body.\nJudge:\nAh...!\nEdgeworth:\n...Therefore! The crystal sphere must have been dropped before the murder!\nvon Karma:\nWha... Whaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!\nEdgeworth:\nOn the night of the murder the victim did indeed go to Dusky Bridge! And there, something occurred that caused the staff's crystal sphere to come loose! (Changed from [And there, something occurred that caused this crystal sphere to come loose!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nWhat... What could that have been!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis sphere... There is some blood on it, isn't there?\nvon Karma:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nAllow me to raise a certain possibility at this junction! The real crime scene was near the foot of Dusky Bridge!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nThe murder didn't take place in the Hazakura Temple courtyard...!? Only a fool would suggest such a foolish piece of absolute foolishness!\nEdgeworth:\nJust who is the fool? And which part is so foolish, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nHave you been paying any attention this whole time, Miles Edgeworth!? The Sister saw everything! She saw the victim being killed by the defendant in the Hazakura Temple courtyard!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not exactly true, now is it? To put it more precisely, what she saw was... ...the murder weapon being removed from the victim's body.\nvon Karma:\nTh-That's the same thing!\nEdgeworth:\n...No, it isn't!\nvon Karma:\n!\nEdgeworth:\n...You said it yourself.\nvon Karma:\nVery little blood is actually lost... ...at the moment of a blade's insertion. If you want to talk about when the most blood would be lost from a body... ...that would be when the blade is removed.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that statement is the truth... ...then Dusky Bridge could very easily be the scene of the murder. The murder weapon was not removed! Thus, there was no bleeding!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nYou are forgetting one vital thing, Miles Edgeworth! Elise Deauxnim's body was found in Hazakura Temple! On foot it takes 15 minutes to travel from Dusky Bridge to Hazakura Temple. You mean to suggest someone carried the body all that way!?\nEdgeworth:\n(I've made it this far... The only place to take this is to the end! I just need to prove that my version of the events is also perfectly plausible. (Changed from [I just need to prove the possibility it happened as I presume...!] in the original release))\nJudge:\nNow, if the defense is ready, the court would like to have an explanation. Please show us the method by which the victim's body was carried to Hazakura Temple!\nEdgeworth:\nOn that snowy night... ...there is one way that a body could have been moved. The snowmobile.\nvon Karma:\nAh...!\nEdgeworth:\nAs we know... the snowmobile was used that night. It was explained as having been used to dispose of the murder weapon... But it could also have been used to carry a body!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Gyaaaaah!\nvon Karma:\nThis... This is completely unacceptable, Miles Edgeworth! You've dug yourself into your own grave!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean!?\nvon Karma:\nThe only one who could have used the snowmobile was the defendant. She's the one who moved the body! Doesn't that put the final nail in your coffin...?\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... You're too late... Franziska von Karma. And in fact, the defense has proven something else entirely. We have shown that this case requires further investigation!\nvon Karma:\nW-What!?\nEdgeworth:\n...Where was the victim, Elise Deauxnim really killed? ...If her body was moved, whatever for? And finally... Just what does this image mean?\nvon Karma:\nDo you even need to think about that!? Such a creature could never see the truth, let alone describe it!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...This witness certainly sits on one of the lowest possible branches of humanity. However! He would never utter a lie that could hurt a girl with whom he is enamored! He drew this, so it is something that actually happened. The defense stands firm on this point.\nButz:\nEd-Edgey! Thank you...!\nJudge:\n...That settles it, then. I cannot give a verdict under these circumstances.\nvon Karma:\nGrrr... Grrrrrr!\nEdgeworth:\n(Wright... I seem to have fulfilled my part in this...) It is just as I thought. Franziska von Karma... You make a wonderful partner.\nvon Karma:\nExcuse me...?\nEdgeworth:\nThere was one reason, and one alone, for me being here. To expose the darkness lurking in this case, and then pass it on to Wright!\nButz:\nR-Really? That's what this was all about? You could have just told me that from the very beginning! Then I wouldn't have had Franzy whipping me all... Daaaaaayyyowch!\nvon Karma:\nMiles Edgeworth... I don't care about what you were here to do! This was my chance to finally grind you under my heel!\nEdgeworth:\nA shame that your chance seems to have slipped you by. (Changed from [A shame that your chance seems to have slipped by you.] in the original release)\nButz:\nWhat a shame, Franzzzyyyyyyyy!\nvon Karma:\n...This is all your fault! Such a terrible witness... You are an affront to all the legal system stands for!\nButz:\nOuuuouuuouooooouuuuuououuooououooouuuuouoouuch!\nvon Karma:\nI demand satisfaction!\nJudge:\n...I cannot believe that the witness's testimony relates to an actual event. However, there has to be some sort of answer for the questions it raises. Have his words here today been the truth or lies? Next time we gather in this courtroom... ...those are the matters that shall be addressed! I am counting on thorough investigations by both the defense and the prosecution.\nEdgeworth:\n(And with this... The rest is up to you... Wright...)\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nCourt is now adjourned!\nTo be continued.\n\nFebruary 9, 3:43 AMHotti ClinicIntensive Care Unit\nPhoenix:\nI'm still up at this hour, reading through the trial record of a certain case. It's the first case my mentor, Mia, had ever handled in a court of law. The horrifying truth that I refuse to accept is holding me hostage here within its pages. Dahlia Hawthorne... What I have read, I don't want to believe. What is written here... This isn't the Dahlia I knew. (Changed from [What is written here... This wasn't the Dahlia I knew.] in the original release) After falling into the Eagle River, I was somehow miraculously saved... But I ended up catching a cold that seemed to knock me around the world and back. I feel dizzy, my ears are ringing, my throat burns, and my head is on fire. But I will recover! I have to recover by this afternoon... I have to meet with the most ill-tempered witness imaginable. But I know that he will be able to help me with him... somehow!

Nothing to worry about. *cough* *cough* *cough* *cough* Anyway... I read today's trial record. You weren't bad, Edgeworth... Pretty impressive despite the circumstances.\nEdgeworth:\nWe're not in the clear yet. The main point of contention tomorrow is going to be the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nEdgeworth:\nIn the end, the Shichishito did not deliver the deadly blow. Which means there must be another sword hiding out there that we don't know about...\nPhoenix:\n(Another sword, huh...)\nGumshoe:\nDon't you worry about anything, pal! I'll dig up the murder weapon myself, or I'll eat my coat!\nPhoenix:\n...Thanks again, Edgeworth. I'll handle things from here.\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... That is probably for the best. Actually, I was thinking about paying the old precinct a little visit. There's something I want to look into...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that is...?\nEdgeworth:\nOur client's background, naturally.\nGumshoe:\nYou mean Iris, sir...?\nEdgeworth:\nI have the feeling that we've met before.\nPhoenix:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nAll I want is confirmation, one way or the other. And since I probably won't be getting that from you...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nI bid you adieu, Wright. ...Take care.\nGumshoe:\nGuess I should get moving, too.\nPhoenix:\nWhy? Do you need to be somewhere?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I've gotta get to work on this bridge, pal. I'm rigging something up so we can get across to the other side.\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! That's right! Maya is still stuck over at the Inner Temple...)\nGumshoe:\nBut don't you worry, pal!

I'm only going to say this once, Lady von Whippingberg. Go home!\nvon Karma:\n... Phoeeenix Wriiight!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you hitting me for!?\nGodot:\nHa...! You deserve more cracks of the whip than that, Trite.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nGodot:\nYou still don't get it, do you? You don't realize that you've set something in motion that you'll never be able to undo.\nPhoenix:\n(There's something different about Godot today... I'm getting such a strong sense of... something from behind that mask of his. Is it anger? Or... Is it... sorrow?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nGodot:\n... So. I should be getting back to work.\nPhoenix:\nWait, Godot! How sure about Maya are you?\nGodot:\n... There's no doubt in my mind. She's in the Sacred Cavern somewhere. It's the only place she could be.\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nYou'd better start praying. You'd better pray that friend of yours brings the accused back here soon.\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth?)\nGodot:\nListen up, Trite. There's only one thing I want to say to you before I go. I'll never accept you. Never.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nvon Karma:\nYou should choose your friends more carefully, Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\nThat's what everyone says. (It looks like I don't have much of a choice... I guess I'll just have to do what I can for now.)\nInner Temple Gate (after examining incinerator in Inner Temple Gate and clearing all Talk options in Inner Temple - Training Hall)\n???:\n... I dunno... Should I... Or shouldn't I...?\nPhoenix:\n(Sound like someone's talking to himself, but where's that coming from?)\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I guess I better wash that off. That's what I'll do. No, but I can't do that. I'm a detective... ...Argh! My brain! This is driving me nuts! Aaaah!\nvon Karma:\nIs something troubling you, Scruffy?\nGumshoe:\nP-Please don't whip me like that all of a sudden, sir!\nvon Karma:\nIt was merely a simple greeting. A friendly tap on the shoulder... with my whip.\nPhoenix:\nSo what's up, Gumshoe? Is something on your mind?\nGumshoe:\nH-H-How did you know, pal!?\nvon Karma:\nPerhaps you were trying to decided [sic] if you wanted to wash \"that\" off or not...?\nGumshoe:\nH-H-How did you know, sir!? Oh! Yeah! I nearly forgot. You can't go through that little gate there, OK?\nPhoenix:\nUm... You mean the one that says \"No Entry\" on it?\nGumshoe:\n... I... um... kinda already snuck in there!\nPhoenix:\n(Is he trying to be clever or something...?)\nvon Karma:\nSo what's behind there, Scruffy?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? A kind of... garden-like garden.\nPhoenix:\nA garden?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Anyway, it's under investigation right now, so keep out! I'm not telling you, I'm asking you, pal! You got me?\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't it normally the other way around?)\nGumshoe:\nWell, see you later!\nvon Karma:\nSo... shall we adjourn to this garden, Phoenix Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Of course! What else would we do? I really want to know what Gumshoe was thinking of washing off!)\nFebruary 9Inner TempleGarden\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\nThere's a strange feeling in the air. I wonder what it is...\nPhoenix:\n(Strange feeling? Forget about that! What's that strange writing on the stone lantern?)\nGumshoe:\nAaah! What are you doing here, sir!? I thought I said you can't come in here!\nvon Karma:\nDon't you know, Scruffy? A Von Karma will always show up wherever there is a clue! And there are plenty of clues to be found here.\nGumshoe:\nB-But...\nAfter examining charm and clearing \"True crime scene\" Talk option in Inner Temple - Garden:\nFebruary 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate\nvon Karma:\nIt seems you have a visitor.\nIris:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nIris! I'm really glad to see you!\nEdgeworth:\nGodot managed to mobilize the police by claiming a state of emergency.\nvon Karma:\nNot him again.\nPhoenix:\nNever mind him! We've gotta hurry and unlock the Sacred Cavern...\nIris:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Wright! It's my fault someone so important to you is locked in there... Mr. Edgeworth. Can we finish our conversation later?\nEdgeworth:\n...Alright. Let's hurry to the Inner Temple then. ...I'll see you later, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWait, Edgeworth! I'm coming with you guys!\nEdgeworth:\n... Sorry, Wright. I can't allow you to come with us.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nI hate to be the one to break it to you, but... ...Maya Fey is in a rather... delicate position.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by a delicate position...?\nEdgeworth:\n... This isn't simply a rescue operation, Wright. It's also an investigation. That being the case... we can't allow members of the public to interfere.\nPhoenix:\nC-Come on, Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nIf anything happens, you'll be the first to know. ...Please understand, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nBut it's Maya!\nIris:\nMr. Wright! All that matters is that Mystic Maya is rescued, correct?\nPhoenix:\nI...\nvon Karma:\nListen to the voice of reason for a change, Phoenix Wright.\nEdgeworth:\nFrom now on, consider anything beyond Dusky Bridge to be off limits. We'll be going now... Excuse us.\nPhoenix:\n... Aaack!\nvon Karma:\nThis is no time to be standing around, Phoenix Wright! Aren't there other things that demand your attention?\nPhoenix:\n... (She's right...) ...Thanks. For reminding me.\nFebruary 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall\nBikini:\n...\nPhoenix:\nSister Bikini looks like she's shrunk some since I last saw her...\nvon Karma:\nDon't be so rude, Phoenix Wright. What's wrong, Sister Bikini?\nBikini:\nMy my my! Hello, you two! How are you doing? Wa ha. Wa ha ha ha ha ha ha! Hmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaah...\nPhoenix:\n(From the sound of that sigh, I guess she's still pretty down.)\nBikini:\nIris was just here, you know. She was accompanied by that handsome, crimson-clad prince!\nPhoenix:\n(Is she talking about Edgeworth?)\nBikini:\nIt was just a courtesy call. I wasn't allowed to talk with her at all. Oh dear. It's all my fault that this has happened. Poor Iris. She was worried about my back, would you believe? What have I done to her...?\nvon Karma:\nOnly what you had to do, Sister. You bravely and truthfully testified about what you saw. There's no shame in that. And we'll see to it that your testimony wasn't made in vain!\nBikini:\n... Well, I don't hear anyone else saying that. ... ...... Mr. Blue-Suits doesn't seem to share your opinion, I see.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Me? ...Ack!\nvon Karma:\n*glare*\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, yes! You did great, Sister Bikini. ...Absolutely spectacular!\nBikini:\n*sniffle* You two are the only ones who've said that to meeee!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't shake the feeling that I just became a shill to a shrew.)\nvon Karma:\nDo you have a problem, Phoenix Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Sure, she was brave to testify so truthfully like that. But I know she's still hiding something. Guess it's time to break those Psyche-Locks of hers... (Changed from [Guess it's time to break that Psyche-Lock of hers...] in the original release))\nBikini:\nMystic Elise graced us with her presence about a week ago. When she showed me the talisman with that mark on it... Well! I nearly fainted! No one had seen her since she disappeared 17 years ago, after all. (Changed from [No one had seen her in 17 years. That's when she disappeared.] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nWhat is the significance of this talisman, Sister?\nBikini:\nThe Kurain Talisman? It's the symbol of the Master of Kurain. The bearer must carry it with them always until their death.\nvon Karma:\nUntil their death...?\nPhoenix:\nSo Elise Deauxnim was really Maya's mother, huh...\nBikini:\n... She was Misty Fey, the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nPhoenix:\n(...The truth comes out at last. It looks like we're making some headway here...)\nvon Karma:\nTell me, Sister... After 17 years, why did she choose to show herself now...?\nBikini:\nBecause something happened that called her out of hiding.\nPhoenix:\n...W-What happened?\nBikini:\nWell... ...\nvon Karma:\nWh-What's happening?\nPhoenix:\n(I-It can't be...)\nBikini:\nE-Earthquake!\nPhoenix:\nAaaaaaaargh!\nBikini:\nOh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might...\nvon Karma:\nThe Inner Temple?\nBikini:\nThe Sacred Cavern in the Training Hall! It might very well cave in!\nPhoenix:\nWH-WHAT!? MAYA!!!\nvon Karma:\nIt... It seems to have... passed...\nPhoenix:\nWell, we can't just stand here and do nothing! Let's go!\nvon Karma:\nWhat? Where?\nPhoenix:\nTo the Inner Temple, of course! Where else!?\nvon Karma:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nSister Bikini! We'll finish this later, alright!?\nBikini:\nOf course. You run along now! People may have been hurt. I must get some first aid kits ready.\nvon Karma:\nCome on then, Phoenix Wright! They won't bar you from entering as long as I'm with you.\nPhoenix:\nTh-Thank you... (Right at that moment, I had the worst feeling in my gut. We just had an earthquake... I wonder if he's alright...)\nvon Karma:\nYou look worried. ...Are you thinking about Miles Edgeworth?\nPhoenix:\n... Come on. Let's go!\nMain Gate\nPhoenix:\n(We've gotta hurry to the Inner Temple and...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Wright!\nPhoenix:\nAah! Wh-What are you doing here?\nEdgeworth:\nGurgh... H-How could I have...? ...\nvon Karma:\nHow do you expect us to understand if you don't speak up!\nPhoenix:\nYeooowww! Hey! Why am I the one getting whipped!?\nEdgeworth:\nSh-She's gone...\nPhoenix:\n(N-No...!)\nEdgeworth:\nThe defendant... Iris... She's... gone...\nvon Karma:\nGone where?\nEdgeworth:\nShe fled... She escaped!\nvon Karma:\nWHAT!?\nPhoenix:\nSo... it was just now... during the...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(It's easy to see Edgeworth's one and only weakness. His fear of earthquakes...)\nEdgeworth:\nI should've known better than to escort the defendant alone! As soon as the ground started shaking, everything went dark before my eyes and... ...I stupidly passed out!\nPhoenix:\nThat incident... haunts you to this day, doesn't it?\nEdgeworth:\n... That's no excuse for letting the suspect get away... I can't believe I let it happen. Wright, the Inner Temple area is a dead end, so she only could've escaped to this side.\nvon Karma:\nWe haven't seen her.\nEdgeworth:\nThen we need to get a manhunt underway now, and search Eagle Mountain from top to bottom!\nPhoenix:\nWait, Edgeworth. Have you thoroughly checked the Inner Temple yet?\nEdgeworth:\nDon't be ridiculous! Why would I? The Inner Temple is like an island. There's no way to escape but to cross...\nPhoenix:\nNo, that's not it... Iris isn't the type of person to run away, Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you talking about?\nPhoenix:\nSister Bikini mentioned something when we were with her. She said that the Sacred Cavern might've caved in because of the quake.\nvon Karma:\nThen you think Iris might've gone to the Inner Temple to check on the situation...?\nPhoenix:\nListen, Edgeworth. I'm sure she's at the Inner Temple. A manhunt is not necessary.\nEdgeworth:\nWright...\nPhoenix:\nLet's not waste any more time. We need to get to the Training Hall's Sacred Cavern now!\nEdgeworth:\n... Alright. Let's go!\nFebruary 9Inner TempleTraining Hall\nPhoenix:\n(Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern hadn't caved in. (Changed from [Fortunately, the Sacred Cavern didn't cave in.] in the original release) But... What we found... ...was something none of us would've ever expected.)\n5 TRICK LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nH-How can there be...\nvon Karma:\n...Even more locks...\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What is the meaning of this...!?) Iris!\nIris:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Iris! Please tell me! What the hell is going on!?)\nTo be continued.\nFebruary 9Inner TempleTraining Hall\nEdgeworth:\nWright, is this what Godot was talking about?\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah. The trick locks.\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, Iris. Please remove these at once.\nIris:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth... I'm afraid I can't... It-It's not possible for me...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\n(During the earthquake, when the cavern was in danger of caving in, Iris escaped. And I know that there was only one lock when I last came here.)\nvon Karma:\nSo you're saying that you can't undo the new locks?\nIris:\n...Yes.\nEdgeworth:\nIf only I was stronger...!\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth, how are you feeling? You look a little pale in the face.\nEdgeworth:\nLike you're one to talk with your face all green.\nvon Karma:\n...Miles Edgeworth. Go and get some air. I'll watch over the suspect. You go and get a grip on yourself.\nEdgeworth:\nDon't be ridiculous! I'm perfectly finngh!\nvon Karma:\nThere's no telling what sort of mistakes you could make in your current state. Go and get some rest! That's your only concern now, Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n...... ... Understood. I'll handle the investigation in the garden... You take care of things here.\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth...) He's got so much pride that he's probably off crying in a corner of the garden...\nvon Karma:\nPride is simply another trap that hinders us in our lives. That said... One must have pride to be effective on the job. At any rate, it seems that this is where we part ways, Phoenix Wright. I'm going to stay here and see if I can't help solve these bothersome puzzles.\nPhoenix:\n...I see. Well, thanks for your help. Now then... Do you mind if I ask you a few things, Iris?\nIris:\nNo, not at all...\nFebruary 9Inner TempleGarden\nPhoenix:\nThe cops are still combing the place. They look pretty nervous... I'd be nervous, too. It's got to be a tough job. Especially with someone giving you the evil eye the whole time.\nEdgeworth:\n*mutter, mutter* How could I have done that...?\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. I can't believe it's still bothering him.) Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nAaaah! ...\nPhoenix:\n... Hey! Don't you dare run away!\nEdgeworth:\n...What do you want, Wright?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do I want?\nEdgeworth:\nIf you came here to laugh at me, then get on with it. Go on! Laugh away!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* I was ready to hug it out with him, but he's just the same, prideful Edgeworth.) You went back to the Criminal Affairs Department, right? You said you wanted to look into something concerning Iris.\nEdgeworth:\nY-Yes... ...And thanks to what I found, I was reminded of something terrible.\nFebruary 9Inner Temple Gate\nPhoenix:\n(I'm finally getting to the bottom of this case. I can count on Iris to break those locks, so I should try to gather more clues. From Sister Bikini, Edgeworth, Gumshoe... ...and Pearls...)\nFebruary 9Dusky Bridge\nPhoenix:\nIt's weird that there's no one around all of a sudden. It sure gets quiet up here in the mountains when you're all on your own. Speaking of alone... I guess I should go check out the shack just down this path... Maybe I'll find Larry there sulking again.\nFebruary 9Hazakura TempleMain Gate\nPhoenix:\nI wonder if Sister Bikini has gone back to the Main Hall already. I haven't seen Gumshoe around for a while, either. Maybe they're having a cup of tea together somewhere. I bet Gumshoe is Sister Bikini's type.\nFebruary 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall\nPhoenix:\nLooks like Sister Bikini is not here. She must be sorting things out after the quake. Must be hard on her with her bad back. There are a few things I really need to discuss with her. Guess I'll drop by again later and see if she's around.\nFebruary 9Heavenly Hall\nPearl:\nOh! Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nPearls! What are you doing here?\nPearl:\nN-Nothing... What about Mystic Maya!? Is she alright!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... We don't know yet.\nPearl:\nOh... I see...\nButz:\nHey! What do you think you're doing here, Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nLarry...\nButz:\nThis is the losers' shack, where losers get together to lose themselves!\nPhoenix:\nThis is the what...?\nButz:\nHey, we find comfort in each other's failures, OK? You got a problem with that?\nPearl:\nLook, Mr. Nick. Mr. Laurice did a picture of me!\nPhoenix:\nThat's, um... great, Pearls.\nButz:\nWe're going to gather firewood now. We'll be cooking some half-rotten potatoes over a miserable little camp fire. So stay out of our way!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't believe this... Why can't he try getting fired up over becoming a better man?)\nButz:\nNo one believes a word I say anymore. Listen to me, Pearl. You don't wanna trust this kind of guy, OK? He'll only let you down!\nPearl:\n... Oh, Mystic Maya...\nAfter clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option in Heavenly Hall:\nFebruary 9Hazakura TempleMain Hall\nBikini:\nWell!? What's the damage!? How is the Sacred Cavern!?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it survived. But we have a bigger problem now.\nPhoenix:\n(I told Sister Bikini all about it... About the five locks that were stopping us from getting inside the Sacred Cavern.)\nBikini:\n... But who... who could've done that...? The only people who know how to set those trick locks are those of the Kurain Tradition.\nPhoenix:\nWe have Iris at the Sacred Cavern, trying her best to open them for us right now. Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk with you about, Sister Bikini.\nBikini:\nOh, yes. We were in the middle of a chat, weren't we?\nPhoenix:\nYes. You were telling me how the Master of Kurain disappeared 17 years ago. I want to know why Misty Fey suddenly appeared at this temple.\nBikini:\nIt was about a week ago when Mystic Elise... No, I mean Mystic Misty, arrived. After she showed me the talisman that proved she was the Master, she said... \"Someone is trying to destroy the Kurain Tradition's main family line. I am here to put a stop to them.\"\nPhoenix:\nSomeone was trying to destroy the main family line?\nBikini:\nThere is only one heir to the title of \"Master\" at any time, and it's usually the eldest. That child becomes the new Master of Kurain, and her daughters, the main family. All other mediums become branch family members, with no hope of controlling the clan. That's why nothing has changed throughout the history of the clan... Branch families always have and always will plot to erase those of the main family line.\nPhoenix:\n...! (Is the power of the Master worth this much bloodshed...?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... Thank you very much. You've helped clear up a lot of details. Pearls had two older sisters, huh...\nBikini:\nYes, that's right... No doubt it was all because of Mystic Morgan's anger towards the main family...\nPhoenix:\nAnger? What do you mean?\nBikini:\nHer twin daughters were taken from her by her jeweler husband. But even that couldn't destroy her dream that a child of hers would one day lead the clan.\nPhoenix:\n(That's why she had Pearls?)\nBikini:\nIt seems that the incident here was a result of Mystic Morgan's anger. It was able to break free of the bars that confine her.\nPhoenix:\n(So Iris has a twin sister... The plot thickens... But this information will be useless unless I can flesh it out a bit. I need to ask more questions, and get some more info!)\nFebruary 9Heavenly Hall\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I was expecting Larry and Pearls to be here. I guess they must've gone to collect firewood. I suppose I'll have to check back later.\nFebruary 9Hazakura TempleCourtyard\n???:\n............\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like someone's happy.

I made a promise to Mr. Edgeworth. I promised I would find the real murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(The real murder weapon...)\nGumshoe:\nThat barbed sword thing turned out to be a false lead, right? I'm giving it my best shot here, but I still haven't turned up any clues. I just found these weird scraps of paper. It looks like a letter or something. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with the case, though...\nPhoenix:\n(A letter?)\nGumshoe:\nCome on, pal. It's good fun, I'm telling you.\nPhoenix:\nAlright, then... I guess I'll give it a go...\nGumshoe:\nLike I said, this is the department's most advanced gadget. The absolute best! It's so sensitive, you could make it cry! It's so hi-tech, you could sky dive off it!\nPhoenix:\nOh, bother.\nGumshoe:\nSo, now I'm gonna tell you how to use it. It's possible the real murder weapon is around here somewhere, right?\nPhoenix:\nSure. That's what we're trying to find out.\nGumshoe:\nRight. So first, let's turn the detector on. That's the sound of the metal detector's signal bouncing off of something metallic. Next, move the detector around and give this courtyard a good lookie-see, pal. (Changed from [Next, touch the detector and take a real good look around this courtyard with it, pal.] in the original release) Don't worry, this baby'll let you know when you've hit on something metallic.

This one's a real gem... The workmanship is really something else! Thank goodness it wasn't a cane-sword, or else the victim would've stabbed her own foot!\nPhoenix:\n(...I officially give up on trying to figure out how Gumshoe's mind works. If the real scene of the crime was the Inner Temple Garden... Then why was the sword used to kill the victim found in the Main Hall Courtyard?) Hey, Gumshoe... Who knows about the hidden sword?\nGumshoe:\nNo one. Even the police didn't know about this until I discovered it just now.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, as they say, there's no \"Team\" in \"Gumshoe\".) It doesn't look like there are any traces of blood on it.\nGumshoe:\n... Then I guess this isn't the murder weapon, huh?\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no! I'm sure someone just wiped it off after the murder!\nGumshoe:\n... Yeah, of course! This thing's definitely the murder weapon! Great job, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(It's about the same length as the Shichishito, too. This must be the murder weapon!)\nGumshoe:\nOK, I'm gonna run over to forensics. There's gotta be some traces of blood left, even if most of it has been wiped off. See you later, pal! ♪Every case is gonna be airtight...

I'm a pretty busy guy right now, you know.\nPhoenix:\nYou're going to get that staff analyzed, right? Would you mind holding off for just a while?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What are you talking about, pal!?\nPhoenix:\nPlease! Just until we find Maya...\nGumshoe:\nMaya? What's this got to do with her?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know, but I'm starting to get a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach.\nGumshoe:\nOh? How so?\nPhoenix:\nLook, Maya's trapped inside the Sacred Cavern right now and... Well, we don't even know if she's OK or not... The more evidence and testimony I hear, the more uneasy I feel.\nGumshoe:\nY-You don't think...? Maya's been murd--\nPhoenix:\nPlease, Detective! Let's just wait until we can get inside the Sacred Cavern.\nGumshoe:\nYou're... looking kinda viridian there...\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nOK, OK. Just stop it with that face, pal. One thing, though... This staff's secret trick... Let's keep it between you and me, alright? If it gets out that we knew about it and didn't say anything, we're finished.\nPhoenix:\n...I understand.\nGumshoe:\nThis is just a regular, run-of-the-mill staff, you got it? ...OK, now you take good care of it, pal.\nPhoenix:\nThank you, Detective.\nGumshoe:\n...

Are you by yourself?Phoenix:\nAh... Morning, Pearls.Pearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Please tell me! What's going to happen to Mystic Maya?Phoenix:\nI'm sorry... We don't know yet. The investigation is still going on, so I wasn't allowed into the Inner Temple.Pearl:\nOh, I see... So is Sister Iris still trying to remove those trick locks in the Training Hall?Phoenix:\nNo... She's the defendant in this case, so she can't be at the Inner Temple. She's required to be here in court.Pearl:\nUm... Then... How come she's not here in the defendant's lobby?Phoenix:\n(I have to admit it's kinda strange...)???:\n...If you're looking for Iris, she's in the prosecutor's lobby.Phoenix:\n...Ed-Edgeworth. What's Iris doing over there?Edgeworth:\nShe's going over today's testimony with the prosecutor as we speak.Phoenix:\nToday's testimony...?Edgeworth:\nYou heard me... Iris is going to be testifying as a witness for the prosecution.Phoenix:\nWait, what!?Edgeworth:\nThe prosecutor is squeezing her for a confession. ...Or so I heard.Phoenix:\n(Franziska von Karma... What are you up to...?)Edgeworth:\nI know what you're thinking, but Franziska isn't going to be the prosecutor today.Phoenix:\nWhat...!? Then who is?Edgeworth:\nWho else would it be but Godot?Phoenix:\nG-Godot...Edgeworth:\n...Franziska is engaged in some important work at the Sacred Cavern.Pearl:\nThe Sacred Cavern...? You don't mean that she's...Edgeworth:\nExactly. She has been out there all night, trying to remove those trick locks. With the head nun's assistance, naturally. We estimate that the last of the locks should be taken care of in about three hours. I hope everything continues to go smoothly and we receive some good news soon.Phoenix:\nYeah... Thanks, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nProsecutor Godot intends to nail this case shut today. Be prepared to fight like there's no tomorrow!Phoenix:\n...You don't have to tell me that.Edgeworth:\nTouch\u00e9. I can already see it in your eyes. (Changed from [I know. I can already see it in your eyes.] in the original release) You're not the same fever-ridden, frantic maniac you were yesterday.Phoenix:\nIt's strange... On the way here, I decided that today would be the end of all this. Almost immediately after I made that decision, I felt myself getting stronger.Edgeworth:\nInteresting... Maybe you've passed your cold onto someone else, literally. And with that... I leave the rest in your capable hands... partner.Phoenix:\nThanks...Phoenix:\n(...I still don't have answers for most of the riddles plaguing this case. The circumstances around the murder of Ms. Elise Deauxnim, no, I mean Ms. Misty Fey... The impossible flight Larry claims to have seen... And... What that woman is really after...) I will solve them all and bring this whole tragedy to an end!February 10, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Iris of Hazakura Temple.Godot:\n...Phoenix:\n... Umm... Your Honor...? Wh-What are you...?Judge:\nWho? Me? Well, my little brother came to visit me in my chambers earlier this morning. All of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, he developed a scorching fever and fainted! Therefore, I'll be standing in for him.Phoenix:\nI-I see, Your Honor... (So they're brothers! That explains a lot...)Judge:\nMy poor brother. He looked a bit pale, not to mention sad that he couldn't be here.Godot:\nIt is impossible to predict what the future has in store for any of us. This is precisely why people feel the need to judge the past. And we of the court have been charged with the solemn duty of passing such judgment.Judge:\n...Well said, Mr. Godot. I understood exactly what you said... at least up until the end, anyway. Now then, Mr. Godot. Please proceed with your opening statement.Godot:\n...Humans are fragile, fickle beings. Our hearts change with the shifting of the tides. There is only one thing that remains a constant in this crazy world... The bitter darkness that lies at the bottom of this mug.Judge:\nSo then you mean...? Um... Forget it. What do you mean?Godot:\nDuring yesterday's trial, the accused refused to admit her role in the crime. But today, she has had a change of heart... Sister Iris of Hazakura Temple has a confession to make.Judge:\nC-Confession...! Th-The defendant...?Phoenix:\n(Iris... Why didn't she discuss this with me first...?)Judge:\nVery well. This court will now hear the defendant's confession!Godot:\n...Upon meeting a beautiful lady, always ask for her name and profession. That's one of my rules.Iris:\n...Um, my name is Iris. I am but a simple nun undergoing training at Hazakura Temple.Judge:\nWitness, is there something that you want to confess to?Iris:\n...Yes. But first, I want to apologize to Mr. Wright... I... I can't continue lying to everyone anymore.Phoenix:\nI-It's alright... What is it...?Iris:\nMr. Wright, I have to admit that I... I did play a part in this terrible incident.Judge:\nAre... Are you actually confessing!? Are you saying that you were the one who murdered Ms. Elise Deauxnim?Iris:\n...No, I'm not, Your Honor. But I dealt with the cover up, after the murder took place. After her spirit left, I took the lifeless shell of Mystic Elise... ...and carried it to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard where I desecrated it.Judge:\nWh... Whaaaat!? O-Order in the court! Order! W-Witness...! Are you... Are you saying you were an accomplice to the murder!?Iris:\n... Yes. That's correct.Phoenix:\n...Whaaaaaaat!? (Three minutes in court and I'm already covered in a cold sweat...)Godot:\nHa...! Everyone on the planet is an accomplice to something. It just happens to be that in this case, it's to murder. Isn't that right... Mr. Trite?Phoenix:\n(Grrr, that Godot... So this is the confession they were conferring about! It pains me to say this... ...but it looks like Iris's testimony was all a lie.)Iris's Testimony crumpled up and shoved into a pocket.Godot:\nNow then, little lady. If you don't mind, I've got a question for you. Whose crime were you trying to cover up by your actions?Phoenix:\n(Iris was covering for someone...? Nngh... Now I'm definitely up the creek without a paddle... or a lifejacket.)Iris:\n...I've been at Hazakura Temple ever since I was a little girl. Hazakura Temple is run by one of the branch families of the Kurain Tradition. One of our missions is to protect the main family.Judge:\nI'm sorry, but \"main family\"...?Iris:\nYes, and that's why I would dirty myself, if need be, to protect her... The daughter of the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, Mystic Maya Fey!Phoenix:\nHuh...?Godot:\nWake up and smell the coffee, Trite.Phoenix:\nSh-She's naming... MAYAAAAAAAAA!?Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! So not only did you witness the murder... You know the name of the murderer!Iris:\nI'm terribly sorry... But it's true. I saw her commit the crime with my very own eyes... And then I cleaned up the area to try to protect her.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nTh-That's ridiculous! Maya could never do such a--Judge:\nThe defense will refrain from commenting until the appropriate time. Now, witness. Let's hear your testimony. What exactly happened on the night of the crime?Iris:\n... ...Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(I thought I was prepared for the unexpected... But I never imagined the case would wind up going in this direction...)Witness Testimony-- The Real Murderer --Iris:\nI went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.\nI saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!\nWhile Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike!\nMystic Maya tried desperately to defend herself and stole the weapon...!\nIt was only in self-defense! You can't blame her for it!Judge:\nSo it was in self-defense?Iris:\nYes. Mystic Elise was the one who attacked first!Judge:\nHmm...Iris:\nThat's why I tried my best to protect Mystic Maya!Godot:\nYou moved the victim's body to the temple so that Maya wouldn't be suspected... Isn't that right? Not bad... You've got the instincts of a true criminal.Phoenix:\n(Something's not quite right. I'm sure it was established yesterday... ...that Iris never went to the Inner Temple that night. And that the person who did go was... that woman... ...Iris even admitted it.)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. Please proceed with your cross-examination.Cross Examination",

      "newContext": "-- The Real Murderer --Iris:\nI went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSister Iris! Your testimony has changed quite a bit since yesterday. You stated yesterday that, on the night of the murder, you didn't go to the Inner Temple.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nDid she now? Too bad for you, what she said yesterday doesn't mean much today. By the way, where were you when she claimed that she didn't go?\nPhoenix:\nUmm, I... It was in the Inner Temple's Training Hall...\nGodot:\nA private conversation between the two of you does not constitute testimony. That would be properly described as hearsay.\nJudge:\nHmm... What do you have to say, witness?\nIris:\nI-I just couldn't tell him the truth at that time. Mystic Maya... She's your girlfriend, isn't she?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nIris:\nI... I didn't want to be the one to break it to you that I saw her commit murder...\nJudge:\nThere, there... We all understand how difficult this is for you. Now then, let's continue with the testimony. What did you witness in the temple garden...?\nIris:\nWell, Your Honor...Iris:\nI saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou're saying that the victim attacked Maya... I mean Ms. Fey?\nIris:\nY-Yes... It was a truly frightening scene. Mystic Maya was struck hard on the head and looked like she was going to collapse.\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing at the time?\nIris:\nUm...\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you stop them from fighting!?\nIris:\nI-I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wright... I was... I was frightened... I couldn't move... I couldn't even speak, I was in such shock...\nJudge:\nHmm... That's perfectly understandable, my dear.\nPhoenix:\n(This doesn't sound right... I don't believe this testimony for a minute!)\nJudge:\n...What happened after that?Present Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey.\nIris:\nHo-How can you be so sure...?\nPhoenix:\nBecause the victim's real name was not \"Elise Deauxnim\". Her real name was... \"Misty Fey\".\nJudge:\n...\"Fey\"?\nIris:\nAaah! N-No...! N-Not Mystic Misty Fey!\nJudge:\nWh-Who is this Misty Fey? Is she related to...?\nPhoenix:\nMisty Fey is the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She is also... ...the mother of Maya Fey!\nJudge:\nA-Are you serious!?\nIris:\nIs it... really true? Mr. Wright...!? Was Elise Deauxnim actually the great Mystic Misty!?\nPhoenix:\nThere's no doubt about it. (It looks like Iris had no idea...)\nIris:\nI can hardly believe it...\nPhoenix:\nThe idea that she would try to kill her only daughter, one she hadn't seen in 17 years... Perhaps the prosecution can offer some explanation for why she would do such a thing!\nGodot:\n...Ugh...!\nJudge:\nOrder in the court!! There's no doubt about it. This certainly is odd. I find it difficult to believe that a mother would try to kill her own daughter!\nGodot:\nHa...! If it turns out that I'm wrong about this... I'll quit my day job and open up a coffee house.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nGodot:\nI'd like to believe that domestic violence cases like these never occur, but... ...unfortunately, they're all too common. That's why people drink bitter coffee, you know.\nJudge:\nYou've brought to light a very interesting fact, Mr. Wright... But I must agree with the prosecution that domestic violence is not all that rare.\nPhoenix:\nY-You don't mean...!?\nJudge:\nThe fact that they were mother and daughter doesn't itself disprove the witness's claims. I think it would be best if we returned to the testimony at hand.\nIris:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow... It looks like I'm gonna have to find another contradiction in her testimony. Something more conclusive than this!)Iris:\nWhile Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nShe moved in to deliver a fatal strike?\nIris:\n...Yes, I'm sure of it. She threw down her staff and reached into her robe for a weapon...\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute! What was this weapon...?\nIris:\nIt-It was... some kind of dagger.\nPhoenix:\n(A dagger, huh...?) And Elise Deauxnim tried to stab her with this weapon? ...To kill Ms. Fey?\nIris:\nYes... Exactly.\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nHa...! You look like I did after I mistakenly took a swig of Worcestershire sauce.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nDo you have a problem with the testimony we're hearing from your client, Lawyer Boy?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Do I have a problem with Iris's testimony...?)\n\n\n\nNo problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Iris is my client... I'd better not press her too hard...) The defense has no objection to Ms. Iris's testimony.\nGodot:\nHa...! You should try some nice, sweet caf\u00e9 con leche at least once, Trite...\nJudge:\nVery well, let's continue with your testimony. What happened to Ms. Fey when she was attacked by the victim?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nThere is one thing...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...Your Honor. I have a small problem with the witness's testimony.\nJudge:\nY-You do? But this witness is your own client!\nPhoenix:\nYes, well... N-Nevertheless...\nGodot:\n...That's fine. Witness, let's add your last statement to the testimony.\nIris:\nY-Yes, sir.\nJudge:\nH-Hey! Just a moment! It's my job to say that...\nGodot:\n...Listen, gramps. I won't say it again. Final judgment will be rendered by me!\nJudge:\nNnngghh...!\nGodot:\n...OK, now. Let's continue.\nAdds statement \"She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe!\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nShe moved in to deliver a fatal strike?\nIris:\n...Yes, I'm sure of it. She threw down her staff and reached into her robe for a weapon...\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute! What was this weapon...?\nIris:\nIt-It was... some kind of dagger.\nPhoenix:\n(A dagger, huh...?) And Elise Deauxnim tried to stab her with this weapon? ...To kill Ms. Fey?\nIris:\nYes... Exactly.Present Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey.\nIris:\nHo-How can you be so sure...?\nPhoenix:\nBecause the victim's real name was not \"Elise Deauxnim\". Her real name was... \"Misty Fey\".\nJudge:\n...\"Fey\"?\nIris:\nAaah! N-No...! N-Not Mystic Misty Fey!\nJudge:\nWh-Who is this Misty Fey? Is she related to...?\nPhoenix:\nMisty Fey is the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She is also... ...the mother of Maya Fey!\nJudge:\nA-Are you serious!?\nIris:\nIs it... really true?

I think that's why she wanted a more lethal weapon.\nJudge:\nIt's true... It's not easy to inflict a deadly blow with a staff.\nPhoenix:\nSister Iris, let me make sure I've got this straight. The victim herself chose to throw away her staff?\nIris:\nY-Yes. That's what I saw...\nJudge:\nIs there anything odd about that, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n... (Yeah, it's odd alright.)\nIris:\nMystic Elise attacked Mystic Maya with the dagger. I'm sure of this.Present Victim's Staff (if Elise Deauxnim profile was presented on any statement other than first)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSister Iris... There's something strange about your version of events.\nIris:\nHuh...?\nPhoenix:\nMs. Deauxnim throwing her staff away makes no sense at all to me.\nIris:\nB-But all you can do with a staff is hit someone...\nPhoenix:\nNaturally you wouldn't know this, Sister Iris, but... ...the victim's staff had a special feature about it. As you can see, it's a sword.\nIris:\nAh...!\nPhoenix:\nIf Elise Deauxnim really had wanted to kill Maya Fey... ...she wouldn't have needed to use a separate dagger! Not when she already had a beautiful blade in her hands already!\nLeads to:\n\"Order! Order in the court!\"Present Victim's Staff (if Elise Deauxnim profile was not presented on any statement other than first)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSister Iris...

What do you have to say?\nIris:\nUhh, err, I...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\n...That was an impressive bit of investigating, Trite. I never would have thought there was a sword hidden in that staff. But even so... How should I put this?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nA long sword is unwieldy, and thus quite ineffective in close-quarters combat. Maybe that's why she chose a dagger over her blade.\nPhoenix:\nUm, well...\nGodot:\nAnyway, the type of weapon she chose to use isn't what's important. The important thing is that she tried to kill Maya Fey. As long as there's nothing strange about that, there's no problem with her testimony.\nPhoenix:\n(But there is something strange about this whole testimony!)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? The prosecution has a point.\nPhoenix:\n...Very well, Your Honor. The defense will now present evidence to back its argument.\nIris:\nM-Mr. Wright...!\nPhoenix:\nI have here another piece of evidence that shows that this testimony can't be trusted. Because Ms. Elise Deauxnim would never attempt to take the life of Maya Fey!\n\n\n\nPresent Elise Deauxnim profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Elise Deauxnim would never have attacked Maya Fey.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nIf you ask me... ...the only thing that seems strange is the angle of Mr. Trite's index finger.\nPhoenix:\nEh...\nGodot:\nTrite, sticking your finger in an electrical outlet might be safer for you. Otherwise it might get bitten off the next time you poke it in the wrong place!\nPhoenix:\nArrrrgh...!\nPhoenix:\n(I still don't think that Ms. Deauxnim would ever attack Maya... If you think about their relationship, it's obvious!)\nJudge:\n...Why don't you think it over one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"...Very well, Your Honor.

Are you absolutely certain!?\nIris:\nYes... B-But believe me, she had no choice! If Mystic Maya hadn't done something...\nGodot:\n...Maya Fey's name would've been written on this autopsy report instead.\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, I see...\nPhoenix:\n(This is bad...

You can't blame her for it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n...So you're saying Maya Fey was the one who stabbed Ms. Elise Deauxnim. Sister Iris!

Something more conclusive than this!)Phoenix:\n(I'd like to avoid the whole spirit channeling thing if I can... Not only would it be inadmissible as evidence... ...but I think it might actually hurt our standing with the judge. First I need to pick her testimony apart and expose the unnatural-sounding parts... I don't know why Iris would tell a story like this... ...but there are two things I noticed that just don't add up!)Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Upon first hearing the witness's testimony, it seemed natural enough. ...However. In light of some facts that have just been presented...Iris:\n...Judge:\nOne, that the victim supposedly threw away a sword during a fight... ...and two, that the two people battling to the death were mother and daughter... Despite the facts being believable when taken on their own... ...when taken together, the entire story seems difficult to believe.Godot:\n...Listen. There's nothing in this world that is impossible. Except for one little thing.Judge:\nYes? What is this one little impossible thing...?Godot:\nHa...! You still don't get it. You think maybe my beans are under-roasted, but you have no idea gramps.Phoenix:\nUmm... Could you get to your point?Godot:\nI heard this witness's confession this morning... ...just as I had taken the first sip of my eighth cup of morning coffee.Judge:\n...You're going to ruin your health, my friend.Godot:\nAnyway, after hearing this woman's confession... I had a detective who loves to investigate sent to the scene of the crime. And... he discovered this little beauty.Judge:\nIs that the dagger the witness testified to seeing...?Godot:\nObviously, Your Honor... But do you not notice something else?Judge:\n...Now that you mention it, if you look closely, there appears to be blood on it! (Changed from [...Now that you mention it, if you look closely, there appears to be a bloodstain!] in the original release)Phoenix:\nWh-Where did you find that? I didn't see that when I investigated the crime scene!Godot:\n...Did you investigate the pine tree at the crime scene?Phoenix:\nHuh? The pine tree...?Godot:\nThis dagger was stuck in the back side of the pine tree. When the last blow was struck, ending the violent battle between the two women... ...this little baby was thrown in the direction of the back of the pine tree.Judge:\nWhich means... the blood on this dagger belongs to the victim, correct!?Godot:\nHa...! Were you even listening, old man? I first heard this confession this morning. Just as I had taken the first sip of my 13th cup of morning coffee.Phoenix:\n(Didn't you say it was your 8th just a few minutes ago!?)Godot:\nI didn't have enough time to get the blood analyzed on such short notice.Judge:\nIn any case, the court will accept the dagger as evidence. Furthermore, I order that a blood test be performed on it immediately!Godot:\nThis is my sweetheart. Make sure you treat her right.Judge:\n...Bailiff! Get this piece of evidence to the crime lab for testing immediately!Dagger added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow then... The testimony we've just heard had numerous unbelievable aspects to it. However! After having found the very dagger the witness spoke of... ...I believe we can consider her testimony to be credible.Godot:\nCute girls never lie. Ever.Judge:\nIn any case, witness... If you could please testify again to this court.Iris:\nUmm... About what, Your Honor?Judge:\nAbout the incident you saw... The battle between the two women!Iris:\n...Yes, Your Honor.Witness Testimony-- The Battle --Iris:\nMystic Maya stumbled briefly after being hit over the head with the staff...\nBut then she dodged Mystic Elise's next attack and stole her weapon!\nSuddenly Mystic Elise was the one on the defensive, with her back to the stone lantern.\nThat's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!\nMystic Elise managed to fling the knife away, but then... Then... she collapsed.Judge:\n...That was a very heart-breaking story.Iris:\nI don't know if there were any bad feelings between them, but... It had been 17 years since Mystic Misty's disappearance. ...Perhaps they simply didn't recognize each other anymore...Judge:\nHmm... That seems reasonable. Now then, Mr. Wright.

What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nWell, if either of them had noticed you... ...they might not have continued their battle.\nIris:\nI... I wonder if that's true... The two of them... They were standing near the garden's stone lantern. I... I was watching the whole thing from behind. It was dark where the two of them were, so... I think that's why they didn't see me.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was dark in the garden when the murder took place... Tell me, what did Ms. Maya Fey do after she was struck?Iris:\nBut then she dodged Mystic Elise's next attack and stole her weapon!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat happened to the victim's staff then?\nIris:\nI-I'm not sure. The area was very dark, so... I really couldn't see. I think it got knocked away somewhere as the fight escalated.\nJudge:\nThat makes sense... That would explain the need for the dagger.\nIris:\nMystic Elise raised the dagger to strike. But Mystic Maya dodged it at the last second. The dagger struck the lantern and fell to the ground. And then at some point, Mystic Maya picked it up...!\nPhoenix:\n(Nothing sounds especially strange yet...)\nJudge:\nWhat did the victim do when the weapon was stolen from her?Iris:\nSuddenly Mystic Elise was the one on the defensive, with her back to the stone lantern.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou're saying that Maya Fey turned the tables on the victim?\nIris:\nY-Yes... ...But Mystic Maya wasn't herself at the time. After all... Her life was in danger...\nPhoenix:\n(I still can't believe it... The idea of Maya cornering someone at knifepoint! It's just silly!)\nGodot:\nAs they say... \"A cornered fox is more dangerous than a jackal\".\nPhoenix:\nI believe the correct description of a cornered fox is \"scared and petrified\".\nGodot:\n... Your animal analogies have grown tiresome!\nPhoenix:\n(You were the one who started it!)\nJudge:\nAnyway... So, after Maya Fey backed the victim into the stone lantern, what happened next?Iris:\nThat's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain that's what you saw!?\nIris:\n... Yes, I'm almost certain.\nPhoenix:\n\"Almost\"...?\nIris:\nThe garden was dark... I couldn't really tell who was who.\nPhoenix:\n(What did she just say!?) S-So in other words, it could have been someone else entirely...!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWe know that Maya Fey was at the Inner Temple that night. And that the woman that was killed was Elise Deauxnim. Isn't it fairly obvious who attacked who?\nPhoenix:\nNnrgh... (I don't have anything to counter that yet...)\nJudge:\n...Well then, witness. Please continue with your testimony.\nIris:\n...Yes, Your Honor. The two of them faced each other for a moment... Then Mystic Maya rushed straight into Mystic Elise! Then Mystic Elise doubled over and fell to the ground.\nJudge:\nHmm... So she was stabbed in the stomach, huh?\nIris:\nYes...Present Elise's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Something about you just isn't right today, Iris!\"Iris:\nMystic Elise managed to fling the knife away, but then... Then... she collapsed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhere did that dagger go?\nIris:\n...I have no idea. It was dark and I couldn't see.\nGodot:\nAccording to the detective who found the dagger... ...it was stuck into the pine tree in the garden. Most likely it was flung towards the tree after the struggle.\nJudge:\nThat is the most likely explanation, yes.\nPhoenix:\nAfter being stabbed in the stomach, did the victim collapse right away?\nIris:\n... Now that I think of it... ...she seemed to stare at Mystic Maya for a while. And Mystic Maya stood there, not moving an inch... It felt for a moment like time had just stopped.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nIris:\nBut then, suddenly, as if the spell had worn off, Mystic Elise fell over...Phoenix:\n(It seems like a reasonable story at first... But... there's one thing that is completely impossible. The very idea of Maya stabbing someone... That alone is impossible! Which means... ...this faulty testimony must contain another contradiction in it somewhere.)Phoenix:\n...Something about you just isn't right today, Iris!Iris:\nHuh...?Phoenix:\nUntil now, I didn't think you were the type to make such a careless mistake. However! The testimony you just gave contains quite a few contradictions.Iris:\nWh-What do you mean? What's so wrong about my testimony?Phoenix:\nAccording to you... ...Maya Fey stabbed the victim while she had her back to the stone lantern... Correct? (Changed from [...Maya Fey stabbed the victim, who had her back to the stone lantern... Correct?] in the original release)Iris:\nY-Yes... That's right.Phoenix:\nBut in that case, the victim would've been stabbed in the stomach, right?Judge:\nY-Yes, I think so...Phoenix:\nBut! According to the autopsy report... ...the cause of death was due to blood loss from a stab wound in her back.Iris:\nAh...!Phoenix:\nThis proves that the victim was stabbed from behind, not from the front! Sister Iris! It appears another seed of doubt has sprouted from your testimony!Iris:\nAaaaaaaah!Judge:\nWhat...!? What is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?Godot:\nHa...! It's simple. People are like books. We've all got a front and a back. You get my drift?Judge:\n... Umm, is that all you have to say?Godot:\nI can also say that darkness loves to play with the human mind.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nCould you please knock it off with the cheesy proverbs and illogical metaphors already!? The point is, too much of this testimony just doesn't make sense! Throwing away a useful staff, the people fighting being mother and daughter... And now, she falsely claims the victim was stabbed in the stomach!Judge:\nHmm... There certainly are some inconsistencies.Phoenix:\nWell, Iris... How about it!?Iris:\n... W-Well, it's just...Godot:\nIf you ask me, you're just being too na\u00efve about the whole thing.Phoenix:\nWhat do you mean...?Godot:\nThere are 253 distinct types of bitterness in coffee... But to pick out each one requires total concentration and the use of all the senses. Were you really concentrating on what this witness actually said?Judge:\nProsecutor Godot! Explain yourself!Godot:\nThe witness was quite unambigious [sic] about her own ambiguities when she said... ...that the garden was dark and she couldn't see clearly.Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nA human needs one thing to see clearly. And that is... light.Judge:\nLight...Godot:\nBy the way, did you know? Hazakura has a rule that on nights when an acolyte is at the Inner Temple training... (Changed from [The Inner Temple has a rule that on nights when an acolyte is there training...] in the original release) ...the stone lantern in the garden must be kept lit. (Changed from [...the stone lantern in the garden is to always be lit.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Hmm... I did wonder what that stone lantern was there for...)Judge:\nWell if that's true... ...shouldn't the witness have been able to see the crime more clearly?Godot:\n...Normally yes, Your Honor. But according to the head nun, Sister Bikini... ...on the night of the crime, it was impossible to light that stone lantern.Phoenix:\nImpossible...?Godot:\nIt hadn't been used in a long time and the wick was no good. In other words... It had to be nearly pitch black in the garden that night. There could have been a faint light coming from the Training Hall, but that's all.Judge:\nMost enlightening...Godot:\nYes, that illuminating fact has chased all the contradictions away! ...If the staff was dropped, it would be difficult to see. It also explains why they didn't recognize each other. We can't see the demons that lurk in the night... That's why humans are weak. Isn't that right, Trite?Phoenix:\nN-- Nooooooooooooooo!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Ordeeer!Godot:\nHere, Your Honor. Let me present the stone lantern into evidence. Maybe it will rekindle the flame of truth in your mind.Stone Lantern added to the Court Record.Judge:\n............Phoenix:\n(Why is the judge just sitting there with that look on his face...?)Godot:\n...What's wrong, Your Honor? Was that flame too hot?Judge:\nTh-This lantern... There's something written on it!Godot:\n...?Judge:\nWh-Why... It's written in blood!Phoenix:\n(Oooh boy...! So the judge didn't know about that yet...)Godot:\nWritten... in blood?Iris:\n...Judge:\nIt... It says...! It says, \"Maya\" upside-down!Godot:\nWh-What the...!?Iris:\nOh yes... That's right... After being cornered and then stabbed by Mystic Maya... Mystic Elise didn't fall down right away. She must have been writing that on the stone lantern behind her... ...with the blood that was draining out of her body!Judge:\nHmm... It certainly looks that way...Godot:Godot:\nHang on... Hang on just a minute! What are you all talking about!?Judge:\nWhat do you mean, \"What are we all talking about?\"Phoenix:\nWe're talking about the message written in blood...Godot:\nHmph... Nonsense! This lantern... It's as clean as a whistle!Phoenix:\n(C-Could it be...? He can't see the bloody writing at all...!? Now that I think of it, he did say something to me yesterday...)Godot:\nMy eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything.Phoenix:\n(So that's what he meant by that...)Judge:\n...In any case, this is obviously an important clue. We now know that the crime scene was dark... ...and that the victim scrawled this message on the stone lantern! Well, Mr. Godot? Anything further?Godot:\n...Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot?Godot:\n...! Errr, umm... OK then... Let's move on.Phoenix:\n(Godot is literally shaking, and somehow, I don't think it's from caffeine overdose.)Judge:\n...I believe it has now been established... ...that Ms. Deauxnim was killed by Maya Fey.Phoenix:\n(Th-That's... just wrong!)Godot:\n...Now it's time to turn our attention to you.Iris:\n...Yes, sir.Godot:\nAfter the victim died, you did something, didn't you? Let's hear it. ...We're all ears.Witness Testimony-- Sister Iris's Cover-Up --Iris:\nAfter Mystic Elise died... I called out to Mystic Maya.\nI thought it was my duty to protect the future Master of the Kurain Tradition.\nSo I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself...\nI dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.\nThen I used the snowmobile to carry it back to Hazakura Temple and...\n...I used the Shichishito to alter the way the wound looked.Judge:\n...So you moved the body.Iris:\nYes... I was raised at Hazakura Temple... I owe a great deal of thanks to the Fey clan. But even so... I never imagined... ...that Elise Deauxnim was actually Misty Fey! I've... I've committed a terrible sin!Judge:\nHmm... A terrible trick of fate.Phoenix:\n(I believe you're looking for \"twist of fate\", Your Honor.)Iris:\nI intended to return to the Inner Temple after taking care of the body... But...Godot:\nYou were spotted by the head nun, correct?Iris:\nYes... And that's why I couldn't go back.Judge:\n...Your story makes sense, I suppose. Mr. Wright, go ahead with your cross-examination.Phoenix:\n...Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination",

I called out to Mystic Maya.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you waited until everything was over before making a move?\nIris:\nN-No, it's not like that...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nShe saw someone murdered right in front of her eyes... It's not surprising that she was a little timid...\nJudge:\n...Yes, I suppose that's true. Sometimes when I'm watching lawyers argue back and forth with each other... ...I feel so helpless that I just sit quietly and wait for them to reach a conclusion.\nPhoenix:\n(...Isn't it your job as the judge to mediate the argument!?)\nIris:\nIt wasn't until Mystic Maya saw me... ...that it finally dawned on her what she had done.Iris:\nI thought it was my duty to protect the future Master of the Kurain Tradition.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo then... You knew...? You knew the significance of the name \"Maya Fey\"...?\nIris:\nY-Yes... Of course I did.\nPhoenix:\n(That's odd... I mean, Sister Bikini didn't recognize Maya's name, let alone her position...)\nIris:\nAnyway... She was a very special person indeed.Iris:\nSo I removed the body from the Inner Temple by myself...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you do that?\nIris:\nBecause I didn't want Mystic Maya to be suspected in any way. I thought the best thing would be to remove the body from the crime scene...\nJudge:\nYou moved her body all by yourself...?\nIris:\n...Yes. I did. It would have been impossible if it wasn't for the snow...\nPhoenix:\n(The snow, huh...?)Iris:\nI dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's pretty amazing you could make it all the way across... That's a rickety old bridge.\nIris:\nIt looks worse than it is. It's surprisingly sturdy despite its age.\nGodot:\nIt's like they say, \"Idiots are too stupid to catch even a simple cold.\"\nPhoenix:\n...But there's one other thing that bothers me. Why not just throw the body into the Eagle River?\nIris:\n...\nPhoenix:\nIt would have been much easier than dragging it all the way to Hazakura Temple.\nIris:\nI thought that it would still cast too much suspicion on Mystic Maya...

(I knew that would show up sooner or later...)\nIris:\n...Yes, I had the key. I used the snowmobile to travel from Hazakura Temple to Dusky Bridge.\nPhoenix:\n(This is the part that was in question the other day. Should I ask for more details...?)\n\n\n\nForget it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(...Forget it, there's plenty of other things to go after in this testimony. Iris had the key to the snowmobile. There's nothing strange about that...)\nJudge:\nVery well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard?\nIris:\nYes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAbout the snowmobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLet me hear more about this snowmobile ride.\nIris:\nWell, it was very cold that night... So I rode it all the way to the foot of the bridge.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nI'm sorry, witness... But now, I've got a problem with your testimony.\nIris:\nExcuse me?\nPhoenix:\n(Godot... What are you up to now?)\nGodot:\nThat night... After the head nun left the remainder of the training to you... ...she said she walked from the Inner Temple back to Hazakura Temple.\nJudge:\nYes... I'm fairly certain that's what the record indicates.\nGodot:\nLet's recall her comments on the subject...\n\n\nBikini:\nMaybe... But, when I made it back to Hazakura Temple... ...it was there, by the Main Gate... The snowmobile, I mean.\n\n\nGodot:\n...The snowmobile was in front of the Main Gate. This is one of those contradictions, wouldn't you say?\nIris:\n...!\nJudge:\nOr-Order! ...Mr. Godot! Wh-Why are you pointing out contradictions in the witness's testimony!?\nGodot:\n...Let's just say I like things to be neat and tidy, OK?\nIris:\nUmm... Well... Maybe... S-Sister Bikini missed it. Yes, maybe she didn't see it.\nPhoenix:\nYou think she missed it...? (That doesn't sound right...)\nGodot:\nHa...! Whatever. Even I don't think this is decisive enough to warrant any more time or effort. It's just... You'd better be careful in your testimony. That's all I wanted to say. A smart little cookie like you shouldn't have any trouble understanding that.\nIris:\nY-Yes, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(What was that all about...? Why would Godot want to give me a hint...!?)\nJudge:\nVery well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard?\nIris:\nYes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway. And then I...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAbout the tracks (before adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you really did move her body by snowmobile... ...then there should be tracks left in the snow, right?\nJudge:\nWell yes, naturally you would expect tracks.\nPhoenix:\nThis picture was presented at yesterday's trial... ...Are these the tracks from that ride?\nIris:\nY-Yes... I think they are.\nPhoenix:\nBut... I can only see one set of tracks here.\nIris:\n...I don't see what's so strange about that. Snow was still falling when I left Hazakura Temple.\nJudge:\nI see... Snow was still falling, huh?\nIris:\nAnd then when the murder took place, it had already stopped. That's why there are such fresh-looking tracks.\nJudge:\nHmm... How about it, Mr. Wright? What do you think about this testimony...?\n\n\n\nIt's very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(When the murder took place, the snow had already stopped...? That doesn't make sense if you stack it up against the other evidence.) ...Your Honor! I'd like the statement Iris just made added to the testimony!\nJudge:\nB-But... Does it have something to do with the case?\nPhoenix:\nAll will be made clear if you allow her statement to be added to the record.\nGodot:\nHa...! This should be fun! You. Let's get this snow business cleared up, shall we?\nIris:\nY-Yes, sir...\nAdds statement \"By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.\"\n\n\n\n\nIt's not important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Nothing I've heard sounds strange at all. I'd better not get too worked up about it...) ...I'm fine, Your Honor. I have no problems with her testimony.\nJudge:\nVery well then, let's continue with the testimony. So you transported the body by snowmobile... ...all the way to the Hazakura Temple Courtyard?\nIris:\nYes. I thought that way, Mystic Maya would never be suspected. That's what I thought, anyway.

She probably thought the worst...\nPhoenix:\n(\"Probably\"...? More like \"definitely\".)\nJudge:\nHmm... I see... So Sister Bikini mistakenly thought you were the one that murdered Ms. Deauxnim...\nIris:\n...I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. It's my fault that this case has gotten so confusing.\nJudge:\nHmmm...Iris:\nBy the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere have been a lot of contradictions in your testimony so far. This time... are you sure it's all true?\nIris:\n...Y-Yes. I am.\nPhoenix:\nWhen the murder happened, the snow had already stopped. According to you, that's why the snowmobile tracks were so clear...\nIris:\nTh-That's right! I'm certain of it!\nPhoenix:\n(I think I've trapped her this time.)\nGodot:\n... I see how you think... Snow, huh...\nJudge:\nWh-What is going on here?\nPhoenix:\n(If the snow really had stopped by the time of the murder... ...it'd mean there's a bigger hole in her story than that movie The Grid: Revelations!)\nGodot:\nHa...! Well then, Mr. Trite, perhaps you'd like to share your theory with us? Let's see what's up your sleeve... or rather, at the end of your index finger!\nIris:\n...?Phoenix:\n(I don't want to believe it, but I don't think my logic is failing me... ...Iris is trying to pin the murder on Maya! But why would she want to do that...? There's only one reason I can think of...)Phoenix:\n...You claim that the snow had already stopped when the murder occurred. But I'm sorry, Iris. That just isn't possible.Iris:\nWhat...!?Phoenix:\nThis is the weather data from the night of the murder. According to this, the snow didn't stop until 10:50 PM. But you couldn't have crossed Dusky Bridge at that time.Iris:\nW-Why do you say that!?Phoenix:\nBecause 5 minutes before the snow stopped... ...Dusky Bridge was struck by lightning and had caught on fire.Iris:\nWhat did you say!? Th-The bridge... It was on fire...?Judge:\nYou don't mean to say... you didn't know about it? It was because of that lightning strike that the bridge burned down!Iris:\nWhaaaaaat!? But it can't... It can't be...!Phoenix:\nIt looks like you still haven't figured it out. No matter how hard you try to deceive or conceal the truth... ...you can't pull the wool over the eyes of a real defense attorney!Iris:\n...Nooooooooo!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!Phoenix:\nThe bridge was already on fire when the incident took place. That's right! The Inner Temple was already totally cut off from the outside world! There's no way you could have crossed the bridge, body or no body!Iris:\nUh... Aaaaaaaah!Judge:\nWitness! Even my patience has its limits. Any further lying and I will find you in contempt of court! Do you have anything to say for yourself!?Iris:\nUgggh...Godot:Godot:\nThe only person here that is truly contemptible is you... ...old man!Judge:\n......... Me!? How dare you!?Godot:\nWhether this witness lied or not doesn't mean squat right now.Phoenix:\nS-S-Squat!?Godot:\nThe important thing now is to find out the truth. ...Isn't that right?Judge:\nY-Yes, of course. But...Godot:\nWhether it was snowing, or not snowing, or whether the bridge was burning or not... There are 2 facts that can't be disputed. First, the body of Elise Deauxnim was discovered in the Hazakura Temple Courtyard. And second, the head nun, Sister Bikini... ...witnessed Iris desecrating Elise Deauxnim's body!Phoenix:\n...! (H-He makes a good point... on both accounts.)Iris:\nTh-That's right! I'm not lying!Judge:\nWhat are you claiming this time!?Iris:\nI wasn't myself at all that night. ...So my memory is still somewhat hazy!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYou have stood at that witness stand and testified this entire time! Are you telling us now that your memory of that night is hazy...?Godot:Godot:\nIt is only human to err. If you're so perfect, Trite, maybe you can explain this for the court?Phoenix:\nWh-What is it...?Godot:\nWhen the murder happened, the bridge had already burnt down. But somehow the body traveled across the bridge and was found in the temple courtyard. Perhaps you have some kind of perfect explanation for this little magic trick?Phoenix:\nUgh...! Well not exactly, no... (I know there must be some other way she got across that burnt-out bridge. But unless I can somehow demonstrate it... We'll never know the truth!)Judge:\nIt looks like the defense is not prepared to offer a suitable explanation...Godot:\nYou see what I mean? In other words... You're in no position to suggest that this lady's testimony isn't the truth!Phoenix:\nAaaaaack!Judge:\nAlright then. Witness, let's hear your testimony once more.Iris:\nAbout what, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou've admitted that you moved the victim's body. Nevertheless, your prior testimony contained a rather large inconsistency. ...Please add an explanation for that to your testimony.Iris:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(...Will this be her final testimony...!?)Godot:\n...Witness Testimony-- Moving the Body --Iris:\nOther than walking over the bridge, there's no way to move the body.\nSo I... must have just... gotten confused, I guess.\nWas the snow still falling or had it stopped...? Does it really matter that much?\nOr are you saying that there is a way to cross a burning bridge?Judge:\nHmm... So it was just a misunderstanding, I see.Godot:\nThis is a photo of Dusky Bridge after it burned down from the lightning blast. It was taken on the morning after the incident.Judge:\nIt certainly was burned to a crisp, and... (Changed from [It certainly was burned to a crisp...] in the original release) ...one of the suspension wires even snapped... It's amazing the whole bridge didn't fall. (Changed from [And one of the suspension wires is gone... It's amazing the whole bridge didn't fall.] in the original release) Clearly it would be impossible to carry a corpse across a bridge in this condition.Dusky Bridge Photo added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\n(Unless I do something to discredit this testimony... ...it's going to be deemed as the truth... ...and Maya will be accused of murder!)Godot:\nTrite. I'm only going to say it one more time.Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nIt is only human to err. And... ...only humans can spot the errors of our ways.Phoenix:\n(The more sense he makes, the less sense he makes...)Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright!

It's not that easy to remember, is it?\nPhoenix:\n...B-But if it had been some kind of a special day, I would have remembered! For example, it was pouring rain on the day of my elementary school graduation!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nNo one wants to hear about your childhood traumas, Trite.\nPhoenix:\nWhat...!?\nGodot:\n\"By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped.\" If you insist on obsessing over that one statement, let's see the proof.

I wouldn't exactly rule out the possibility.\nJudge:\nWh-What!?\nGodot:\nHa...! You're saying it's possible? Don't make me laugh.

We have a witness who did see it happen.\nGodot:\n...Pwweposterous!\nJudge:\nWh-Who is it!? Who is this witness!?\nPhoenix:\n(I can't chicken out here... I've gotta keep on the attack and go, go, go!) Ms. Elise Deauxnim's brilliant and highly-gifted apprentice, Laurice Deauxnim!\nJudge:\nBrilliant...?\nGodot:\nHighly-gifted...?\nIris:\nApprentice...?\nPhoenix:\n...Remember what he said in his testimony. That night he was at the mountain shack, Heavenly Hall. And that's when he witnessed the event. I think you've all seen this sketch before! It's an exact drawing of what he witnessed that night!\nIris:\n...\nGodot:\n......\nJudge:\n......... ...Are you serious? Today's not April Fools' Day, is it? Mr. Wright. Are you seriously claiming that the victim flew through the air!? And you're using this pathetic scribble to support your argument!?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh... The judge looks like he's about to blow a gasket.)\nGodot:\nHa...! Well, Trite. There's nowhere for you to hide now... Other than looking like it was drawn by a 6 year old, does this sketch prove anything?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes... I'm pretty sure it does, and I'm going to prove it!\nGodot:\nListen... I know your tricks. You're trying to turn this whole thing upside-down.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nIf you're so eager to turn this case upside-down, why not start with this sketch?\nPhoenix:\n(Upside-down...?

But how do you transport a body across a burning bridge...? Even if I don't know the exact answer yet, it's OK. I'll start by examining all of my evidence, and see where that takes me... I've gotta be like a shark... If I don't keep moving, I'm as good as dead!)Judge:\nThat's a photo of Dusky Bridge, correct?Phoenix:\nYes. Now, compare the sketch and the photo for a minute. In the sketch, the wires appear to be above the guard wires. But on the actual Dusky Bridge...Judge:\nJumping Jehosaphat!Phoenix:\nThe wires are... below the guard wires!Godot:\n...Bwhaaaat!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! This sketch is somewhat different than what's depicted in the photo! However... Isn't it likely that the artist just saw it wrong?Iris:\nOr perhaps he just drew it wrong!Godot:\nEither way, it sounds like you're... just wrong!Phoenix:\n...With someone like Laurice, I admit a mistake is a definite possibility. But then that begs the question... \"Why did he make a mistake?\" What was the reason?Godot:\n...Are you saying you know the answer to that?Phoenix:\nListen! Think back, alright? Remember what Laurice was doing when he witnessed this event. ...He was at Heavenly Hall waiting for a lover that was never going to come. He waited and waited, and finally he laid down. ...But then! Lightning shoots from the sky and sets the bridge aflame! Now ponder what sort of position Larry must have been in at the time... He was lying on his back, which is why he remembered the scene the way he did.Judge:\n... He was lying on his back...? I can't see how it relates...Phoenix:\nBut it does, Your Honor. That is the reason why the wires in the sketch go up instead of down...Judge:\nAaaaaah!Godot:\nUgh... No way...!Phoenix:\nLaurice Deauxnim witnessed the event while he was lying on his back, face up. In other words, the scene that he saw... ...was actually upside-down!Judge:\nSo then...! This sketch should actually...Phoenix:\nI think you finally get it, Your Honor. The correct way to view Laurice Deauxnim's sketch is like this! This is how it should actually look! The victim's body wasn't flying above the bridge! It was actually swinging below! ...That's right! Just like a pendulum!Godot:\nBwwweeeediculous!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order--Godot:Godot:\nOf all the things to say! A pendulum!?Phoenix:\n...The bridge was burning to a crisp. There was no way to get across it. But if the body had been found at the Inner Temple, it would have caused problems. This is where the criminal decided to take a gamble. They used the burning bridge to get the body across to the other side. And a pendulum was the only way to get it done!Godot:Godot:\n...Let's think about this for a minute, shall we? Dusky Bridge is about 20 yards long. Which means it's about that far from the Inner Temple to the opposite cliff.Phoenix:\n...Yes, that sounds right.Godot:\nIn order to cover that distance with a pendulum... You'd need a rope at least 10 yards long. To get a rope that long, you have to plan ahead!Phoenix:Phoenix:\n(The lightning strike that night can only have been an accident. So it doesn't make sense that the criminal would have prepared the rope beforehand. So then... (Changed from [So then, the criminal...] in the original release)) They didn't have to get the rope ready... The rope was already right in front of them. (Changed from [The rope was already right in front of the criminal.] in the original release)Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nI'm saying that it was just a matter of using what was already there.Judge:\nIn that case, Mr. Wright, please give us an explanation to support your theory. What makes you think the criminal had the rope on hand to create a pendulum!?Present Dusky Bridge Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"And the meaning of this is...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\n... What do you think, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nI think that Mr. Trite is lucky there's no rope around here...\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nGodot:\nEven if I had just a sliver of rope... ...I'd be wrapping it nice and tight around his neck.\nPhoenix:\n(I should have figured I'm not going to win this one with a lucky guess...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, your assertion seems to be baseless...\nJudge:\nThere's no evidence that the body was swung like a pendulum after all...\nPhoenix:\nWait! But that's the only possible way the body could have gotten across!\nLeads back to:\n\"The rope was already right in front of the criminal.\"Judge:\nAnd the meaning of this is...?Phoenix:\nIf you want to know where the rope came from... ...it's hanging right there in front of your glorious beard!Judge:\nAaaaaaaah! This... This is one of the wires from the bridge!Phoenix:\nWhen the lightning struck the bridge and set it on fire... ...one of the suspension wires came loose from its anchor. The criminal didn't have any time to waste. So they tied the wire around Elise Deauxnim's body... ...because there was simply no other way to move the body!Godot:\n...... Ha......! *glug, glug, glug, glug, glug* *glug, glug, glug, glug, glug* *glug, glug, glug, glug, glug*Judge:\nMr. Godot!? Hmm... It seems that Mr. Godot is more focused on his coffee than answering my question. It seems that the odds of a rope being readily available were very high. So I suppose that it's not an impossibility after all!Godot:Godot:\n\"Possible\" or \"impossible\"...? That's not the question we need to ask! There's only one question. \"Did that really happen?\" Trite! I wonder if you can prove what happened to us. Do you have any actual evidence that the body was swung over like a pendulum!?Present Elise's Autopsy Report or Crystal Sphere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Before I present my evidence, let me review what we know so far.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n...Here's the proof!\nGodot:\n...Why don't you go swing yourself around like a pendulum, Trite.\nJudge:\nI think you should think that over again, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(...It's kinda nice when they don't spend too much time thinking of a witty retort.)\nJudge:\nI suppose we've gotten used to your mistakes.\nPhoenix:\n(I need to think about how this body was moved... The criminal decided to use the pendulum method as a last resort... So there's a good chance there's still a clue from when or where the body landed.)\nGodot:\nHa...! Here's a toast to your ever so classic clueless-look.\nLeads back to:\n\"Trite! I wonder if you can prove what happened to us.\"Phoenix:\nBefore I present my evidence, let me review what we know so far. According to this photo, one of the wires snapped. Looking at the map, we can see it's the one that was in front of the Inner Temple.Judge:\nSo then, that was the spot where the criminal...!?Phoenix:\nYes, precisely. Now let us consider the body's movement by looking at the overhead map again. If the body was pushed from this point here... ...it would drop on the opposite bank at approximately this point.Judge:\nD-Did you say drop?Phoenix:\nWell, they must have failed to catch the body on the other bank.Iris:\nWhat...!? What makes you think something like that happened!?Phoenix:\nBecause I have evidence that suggests her body dropped some distance.Iris:\nWh-What kind of evidence!?Phoenix:\n...Take a look at this autopsy report. It says here that her body fell about 10 feet after her death.Judge:\nTen feet, huh...Phoenix:\nThat's most likely the height difference between the two sides. The body over swung due to forward momentum but then came loose and fell about 10 feet. And then, as a result of the landing impact... ...this crystal sphere was knocked loose!Iris:\n...! That's...Phoenix:\nYes, this blood-stained amethyst crystal... It's the one that came off of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's staff! And even more important is the place where this crystal sphere was found!Judge:\nIn-Indeed... I believe it's already marked on this overhead map. The crystal was found... Aaaaaah!Phoenix:\n...Precisely, Your Honor. In the very spot where the pendulum would arrive if given the right amount of speed!Judge:\nThis explains your theory quite well, Mr. Wright. You have provided us with a way the body could have been moved that night... An impressive deduction, Mr. Wright. ...Most impressive. M-Mr. Wright!Godot:\nI thought this cold coffee might help cool you down.Judge:\nWh... What is the meaning of this, Mr. Godot!?Godot:\nThat was a dark and bitter guess that you made, Trite. ...But you forgot about one thing.Judge:\nOh? And what would that be?Godot:\n... The aroma.Phoenix:\n...Huh?Godot:\nA coffee's most reliable accomplice is its deep and profound aroma...Phoenix:\nUm... The rest of the court doesn't speak Coffeenese. Can you elaborate a bit more?Godot:\nIf the criminal had sent the body to the other side like you say... ...then naturally, there must have been an accomplice laying in wait to catch it.Judge:\nAn accomplice...!?Godot:\n...The criminal wasn't able to cross Dusky Bridge. So, who collected the body...? What do you have to say about that, Trite!?Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nMr. Godot is correct... This can't be the work of a single person! Well, Mr. Wright!? You know what you must do.Phoenix:\n...Yes, Your Honor. (The body couldn't have made it to Hazakura Temple without an accomplice!)Judge:\n...Very well then! If you please, Mr. Wright. Who was the person that received the body on the Hazakura Temple side?Present Iris profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It can only be you... Sister Iris.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Godot? I'm sure you have something to say.\nGodot:\nThat aroma just now... It smelled of sulfur... Perhaps it was your chances of winning rotting away?\nPhoenix:\n(I can't get my facts all mixed up like this! After the accomplice received the body, they carried it to Hazakura Temple... Then they altered it using the Shichishito! There's only one person it can be...!)\nJudge:\n...Mr. Wright. Please don't stare at me like that. It's creepy.\nLeads back to:\n\"...Very well then! If you please, Mr. Wright.\"Phoenix:\nIt can only be you... Sister Iris.Iris:\nHuh...? Aaaaaaah! But I... I...Phoenix:\n...I don't see why you're so surprised. The only way to transport the body from Dusky Bridge is by snowmobile. But with her bad back, Sister Bikini could never pick up a body like that. ...You're the only one that could have managed it.Godot:Godot:\nTrite. Were you even listening to the witness's testimony...? On the night of the crime, this little cutie pie... ...was on clean-up duty in the Inner Temple Garden after the mother-daughter bloodbath.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nI haven't forgotten. But have you, Mr. Godot? This witness was also seen at Hazakura Temple... ...desecrating the corpse of the victim.Judge:\nHmm... Strange indeed... It's almost as if... ...on that night, the defendant was in two different places at the same time!Phoenix:\n...Sister Iris. Let me ask you something... Why didn't you mention it when you first gave your testimony?Iris:\nM-Mention what?Phoenix:\nThe pendulum, of course. Using this sketch drawn by an eyewitness... I have established how the body was moved using the burnt-out bridge. Which means it's now a fact that this occurred, something you should've already known.Iris:\nN-No...! I... I had no idea! I-I didn't know anything about a pendulum!Phoenix:\nBut the body couldn't have been passed along to the other side without your help! So you should have known about it! In fact, it'd be impossible for you to be clueless about this whole thing... ...unless you're not really Iris to begin with.Iris:\nWhat...!? H-How can you say that, Mr. Wright...?Judge:\nWhat...!? What kind of nonsense is this? You... You're saying this witness isn't Iris of Hazakura Temple...?Godot:Godot:\nA-Are you serious, Trite...!? You... You mean... Th-This woman is...Phoenix:\n(There's no one besides Iris that could have received the corpse that night! Now I get it... Now I know why I've been sick to my stomach during this trial. Why her whole demeanor changed so suddenly from yesterday... ...and why she's trying to pin this murder on Maya...) The woman that's standing there at the witness stand... Her real name is...!Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I never thought I'd have to utter your name again...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, wait! That can't be it! This is no time to be making stupid, amateurish mistakes!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! You've just made an absolutely absurd accusation! I won't have you turning my courtroom into a circus side-show!\nPhoenix:\nUuurgh...! (Come on! This one's a no-brainer!)\nLeads back to:\n\"The woman that's standing there at the witness stand...\"Phoenix:\nI never thought I'd have to utter your name again... Let alone see you. ...It's been a long time, Dahlia Hawthorne.Iris:\n...!Judge:\nHawthorne...?Phoenix:\nSister Iris had a twin sister. ...And you're looking at her. Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.Judge:\n...... That name rings some bells. Distant bells, but bells nonetheless...Godot:\nHa...! It's just your imagination, gramps. This file contains all the relevant data about Dahlia Hawthorne.Judge:\n... Oh yes, I remember now... That case... 5 years ago...Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Payne:\nThe honor is all mine!Judge:\nNo... The honor is all mine.Judge:\nB-But... According to this... Dahlia Hawthorne... ...is already dead! ...It says her execution was carried out last month!Godot:\n... So what? Death has no meaning in this courtroom!Judge:\nWh-Whaaaaaaaaat!? Order! Order! Order!Iris:\nW-Wait a moment! How can you...? My sister...! She's already dead! Wh-What kind of...?Phoenix:Phoenix:\n...You of all people should already understand. After all... The blood of the Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique flows within that body.Judge:\nThe Kurain Channeling Technique...? Now where have I heard that...Phoenix:\n...That's right. You're not Dahlia Hawthorne herself. You're the spirit of Dahlia, currently inhabiting the body of a spirit medium!Godot:\nWhat an exciting story. Exciting, but quite impossible. You're asking us to buy that Dahlia Hawthorne just happened to be channeled by someone... ...on the very night of the murder, to a temple where her twin sister, Iris was...?Phoenix:\nWell, if you're going to put things that way, then... Yes.Godot:Godot:\nWe're supposed to believe a coincidence like that just happens!?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNaturally it was no coincidence. The whole thing was part of a plan from the very beginning. It's all written right here in these instructions...!Iris:\nAh...! Wh-What's that...!?Phoenix:\nThese instructions were written by your mother, Morgan Fey! And part of the plan called for Dahlia Hawthorne to be channeled! That night... ...there were two Irises at Hazakura Temple.Godot:\n...T-Two of them?Phoenix:\nEven the time of the channeling was planned out. \"As soon as you hear the lights out bell\"... In other words, 10:00 PM. However, Iris was seen before dinnertime.Judge:\nThat means the Iris that was at dinner was the real Iris.Phoenix:\nAnd the Iris who gave me this hood in the Main Hall was also the real Iris. Meaning that the Iris Sister Bikini saw at the Inner Temple... ...was someone else dressed as her! Namely, one Dahlia Hawthorne!Godot:Godot:\nDo you even know what you're saying, Trite? This whole \"channeling the spirit of Dahlia Hawthorne\" business... Yes, it's true that you found plans that talk about it. ...However! There's one thing that's perfectly clear. The witness currently standing in the witness stand is the real Iris!Phoenix:\nWhaaaaat!?Godot:\nCalm down and remember what you know about the night of the crime. After meeting Sister Bikini, the Dahlia Hawthorne that had been channeled... ...would've been stranded at the Inner Temple due to the lightning strike. It was later that the body was moved by pendulum.Phoenix:\n...That's right.Godot:\nNaturally that would mean that the Iris that received the body was... ...the real Iris. Are you with me so far?Phoenix:\n...Yes.Godot:\nAfter being notified of what happened, the police came to Hazakura Temple's Main Hall. There they found Iris in her room and arrested her. And ever since, she's been under police supervision at the detention center.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, I suppose... (I can't deny any of that...)Iris:\nWhew... Thank goodness. It looks like he's finally convinced...Phoenix:\n(But something still seems off... Way off...!) I'm still not convinced that the Iris here is the same one from the other night.Godot:\nHa...! I suppose you're about to say something really ridiculous? Like, the real Iris and the spirit of Dahlia... ...somehow switched places?Judge:\nS-Switched places...!? To be perfectly honest... ...there are still quite a few things I don't understand, but I do know... ...that unless we confirm the witness's identity, we can't continue with this trial.Phoenix:\n(Iris doesn't have the spiritual power needed to channel Dahlia. Which means... ...they must have switched places somewhere.)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Since the time she was arrested at Hazakura Temple... ...have there been any chances for Iris to switch places with Dahlia Hawthorne?Not a chance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n... (Hmm, I can't think of one... She certainly couldn't have escaped while she was under arrest!)\nGodot:\nHa...! I love that look on your face! Maybe you should go live in that old mountain shack and become a hermit?\nJudge:\nIt appears there was no opportunity for them to have switched places.\nPhoenix:\n(No! If I give up here, I'd never be able to live with myself... Even if it's a little forced, I have to think of something!)\nLeads to:\n\"...Your Honor!\"There was one...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Your Honor!\"Phoenix:\n...Your Honor! I think there might have been one chance.Judge:\nOh? Explain yourself...Phoenix:\nYesterday for a few minutes, Iris's whereabouts were unknown.Godot:\nUnknown...? What do you mean?Phoenix:\nWhat I mean is... There was a span of time in which Iris was able to move about freely, unsupervised.Judge:\nWell, who was it!? Who would give a murder suspect time to move about freely like that!?Phoenix:\n(I'm sorry... I know you didn't mean to... It wasn't your fault...) The person who gave Iris the chance to freely move about was...Present Miles Edgeworth profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Th-This is... Mr. Edgeworth, isn't it...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\n...Mr. Wright. There will be no unaccountability in my court, time or otherwise!\nGodot:\nHa...! Trite, Trite, Trite... Can't you even remember what happened only yesterday...?\nPhoenix:\n(Yesterday, Iris was escorted to Hazakura Temple... ...in order to remove the locks on the Sacred Cavern! That would have been her only chance...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, who was it!?\"Judge:\nTh-This is... Mr. Edgeworth, isn't it...?Phoenix:\n...Your Honor. There was a fairly large earthquake yesterday, was there not?Judge:\nAn... earthquake? Hmm...Bikini:\nE-Earthquake! Oh my goodness! The Inner Temple! This kind of tremor might...Edgeworth:\nH-How could I have...? She fled... She escaped!Phoenix:\nWe went to the Inner Temple right away. And it's true, Iris was already there. However... ...they had already switched places by that point in time. When I arrived at the Training Hall, I was met by none other than Dahlia Hawthorne!Judge:\nTh-That's quite enough already, Mr. Wright! Now see here! No judge in his right mind would consider the idea of \"spirit channeling\" and...???:\n...Be quiet. It's been a long time... Mr. Judge.Judge:\n...! Th-That voice...!Godot:\nGuess I'll have to ask again.???:\n...Godot:\n...Upon meeting a beautiful lady, always ask for her name and profession. That's one of my rules.Dahlia:\nDahlia Hawthorne. And my current profession? Permanently retired.Phoenix:\n...Godot:\nHa...! So you're not going to bother hiding your identity anymore, huh?Dahlia:\n...Why should I? After all, I'm dead. There's really nothing you can do to punish me!Judge:\nWh-What is going on here...?Phoenix:\n(Dahlia Hawthorne... I never thought we'd meet again. And I never thought we'd meet like this... But this time, I'll end it! For her, and for myself...)To be continued.February 10, 1:06 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge:\n...Now then, let's continue where we left off, shall we? Well, witness?Dahlia:\nYes? How can I help you? ...Mr. Judge.Judge:\nWell... It seems that if we're to learn the truth... ...we'll need to hear your testimony.Dahlia:\n... I have no problem with that. But when you've seen what I have, sometimes the truth is better left unknown.Phoenix:\n...Judge:\n...In any case, let's hear your testimony!

What my goal was?\"Dahlia:\nThe plan went wrong... but it seems to have succeeded anyway.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou think the plan was a success?\nDahlia:\nYou heard me. Just as that woman had hoped... ...Maya Fey is dead. Now the title of the Master will pass on to Pearl Fey.\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's absurd! M-Maya is just... She's just trapped! Trapped inside the Sacred Cavern!\nDahlia:\nReally...? You're as foolishly optimistic as ever, aren't you... my darling Feenie?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nDahlia:\nDo you want to know the truth? Ever since we met... I've despised you. Your sniveling na\u00efvet\u00e9 and your pathetic faith in other people.\nPhoenix:\n...Press (after pressing all other statements, before adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou think the plan was a success?\nDahlia:\nYou heard me. Just as that woman had hoped... ...Maya Fey is dead. Now the title of the Master will pass on to Pearl Fey.\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's absurd! M-Maya is just... She's just trapped! Trapped inside the Sacred Cavern!\nDahlia:\nReally...? You're as foolishly optimistic as ever, aren't you... my darling Feenie?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nDahlia:\nDo you want to know the truth? Ever since we met... I've despised you. Your sniveling na\u00efvet\u00e9 and your pathetic faith in other people.\nPhoenix:\n... I just want to know one thing... What did you personally think of Morgan Fey's plan?\nDahlia:\nI told you already, didn't I? It was a stupid plan. It had no point, no value other than fulfilling her own greedy desires... ...Yes. It was certainly nothing to be proud of.\nPhoenix:\nIf that's how you feel, why did you help her carry it out!? Why would you do it...? Why would you kill Maya!?\nDahlia:\n... You may not understand it, being the kind and gentle soul that you are... You may not be able to appreciate why someone like me would help a woman like that.\nPhoenix:\nSo then tell me! Why!?\nDahlia:\nIsn't it obvious? I'm not like that woman. I only act in my own self-interest. The reason I helped her was... for myself. For my own personal satisfaction!\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you say...!? (So this woman, Dahlia Hawthorne... She had her own reason for wanting Maya dead...!?)\nAdds statement \"Do you understand why I would kill Maya Fey now? What my goal was?\"Dahlia:\nDo you understand why I would kill Maya Fey now? What my goal was?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nObviously... It's because you were helping Morgan Fey.\nDahlia:\nHelping...? Don't make me laugh. From the day I was born to the day I died, I never helped anyone! I lived for myself and, in the end, I died for myself. I thought that was obvious.\nPhoenix:\n(So she wasn't actually cooperating with Morgan... She was just using Morgan and her plan so she could accomplish her own goal!)\nDahlia:\nAll I wanted to do was kill Maya Fey. That was the only way I could think of to get revenge...\nPhoenix:\n(Revenge...? It looks like I have no choice but to present that piece of evidence...)Present Mia Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Could it be...\"Phoenix:\n(I can't believe it! She meant to kill Maya... I've got to keep a cool head! And... I need to get more information out of her. It's the only way to understand this plan, and what she was after as well!)Phoenix:\nCould it be... ...that your actual goal had nothing to do with Maya Fey herself...?Dahlia:\n...As I said, none of you have the power to punish me anymore. Because I'm already dead. Well, I had the same problem, you see. You can't punish the dead... and you can't take revenge against them either.Judge:\nY-You wanted to take revenge on someone?Dahlia:\nI was sentenced to die because of that woman... Mia Fey.Phoenix:\n(I somehow knew this was it...)Dahlia:\n...I wanted to send her a message. It was at her hands that I suffered my first humiliation... I wanted her to feel the same pain she made me feel! Sadly... when I realized revenge was impossible, I gave up.Godot:\nAnd the reason it was impossible...? Was it perhaps because Mia Fey had already died...?Dahlia:\nYes. And I realized... there's only one way to take revenge against the dead.Judge:\nA-And how do you do that?Dahlia:\nEven when the body dies, the spirit, the ego, it lives on... forever. I wanted to take away the person that Mia Fey loved most. I wanted to kill her with my own hands! That would be the one and only way I could take my revenge against Mia Fey! That was the reason I helped out with that woman's plans!Phoenix:\nJust for that!? For that you would kill Maya!? Your goal was no different than that of Morgan Fey!Judge:\n... As they say, \"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\" What a cruel plan... Cruel, cold, and heartless.Dahlia:\n...Hmph! Don't waste your time preaching to the dead. I've already told you, there's not a thing you can do to me.Phoenix:\nGrrrr...!Dahlia:\nThat night... ...at about 9:30 PM, I materialized into this world. I quickly pinned my hair up and put on a demon-warding hood. Then I picked up the staff that was by my side and left Hazakura Temple.Phoenix:\n(So... it was Elise Deauxnim who channeled her after all.)Dahlia:\n...That ridiculous head nun never noticed a thing. She left Maya Fey at the Inner Temple... ...and wobbled back clutching her poor old back.Judge:\nWh-What did you do then...?Dahlia:\nThat kid was easier to handle than I had hoped... I caught up with her in front of the stone lantern. Then I took out the dagger I got from the storeroom and...Phoenix:\nS-So then you... Y-You're saying you s-stabbed Maya!Dahlia:\n............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that.Judge:\n...What does that mean!? No clear memory...?Dahlia:\nI don't know... I think... I think I was stabbed.Phoenix:\nYou were stabbed!?Dahlia:\nAt the last minute, Maya Fey must have stabbed me. I'm sure of it.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThat's not like her at all! Maya wouldn't stab a French fry with a plastic fork!Dahlia:\nAnyway, I suddenly lost consciousness... But before I did... I scrawled her name on the lantern. Just as I was passing out, I wrote \"Maya\" behind my back. I had hoped it would cast suspicion on her.Phoenix:\n(I-I can't believe she was thinking of that until the bitter end...)Dahlia:\n...That's where my memory temporarily stops.Judge:\nIt-It stops...?Dahlia:\nI don't have any memory of actually killing Maya Fey with my own two hands. My very last memory was... ...Maya's terror-filled eyes. When I woke up after that... ...I was in the Sacred Cavern surrounded by darkness.Judge:\nYou were in the Sacred Cavern?Dahlia:\n...The entrance was sealed with one of those trick locks. Somehow I had been trapped in there.Godot:\nBut how did you wind up in there?Dahlia:\n...I'd like to know that myself. Anyway, I was worried... I didn't know whether or not Maya Fey was dead... And I swore I wouldn't return to the underworld until I knew I had killed her myself.Godot:\nHmm... For a ghost, you're one tough cookie...Dahlia:\nI wanted to get out of there and make sure she was dead. But... I couldn't do it. I couldn't get out.Godot:\nThe trick lock stopped you, huh?Dahlia:\nI didn't know how to remove it.Judge:\nSo then you're saying... ...you were actually confined against your will inside this Sacred Cavern...?Dahlia:\nYes! I wanted to get rid of that annoying lock as soon as possible... But it wasn't easy. I kept getting interrupted while I was working on it.Phoenix:\nInterrupted...?Dahlia:\nIt was early in the morning, but someone came into the Training Hall.Judge:\nWhat!? Who!?Phoenix:\nCould it have been... Maya!?Dahlia:\nI thought the same thing. But I couldn't see.Phoenix:\nWhy not!?Dahlia:\nIf someone had spotted me, I would have lost my chance to take revenge. ...So I made sure to hide myself well at the back of the Sacred Cavern.Phoenix:\n(That morning... only two people could have gone into the Training Hall. Maya and... Pearls... Pearls went there to cover the hanging scroll in gravy.)Dahlia:\nStill, I finally managed to remove the lock. But... I was too late.Godot:\nWhat do you mean by that?Dahlia:\n...The flies had already started to gather.Godot:\nThe bridge had been fixed and the police had started their investigation, correct?Dahlia:\nNaturally, I couldn't go out. So instead... I returned to the cavern and put the lock back on myself. I realized I wouldn't get a chance to see Maya's corpse as I had hoped... But just then... Lady Luck showed up.Phoenix:\nLady Luck...?Dahlia:\nAfter that big earthquake... she showed up, all by herself.Phoenix:\n...The real Iris?Dahlia:\nShe said she'd come to make sure the Sacred Cavern was alright... Stupid girl. I came out from the Sacred Cavern and got a feel for the situation. ...And I locked her away in my place. I had finally learned exactly what had happened... It was then that I learned that the plan had actually succeeded.Phoenix:\nWhat do you mean your plan had succeeded?Dahlia:\nI had misunderstood one thing, you see. That night, the one that had summoned me... I had assumed that it was Pearl Fey.Judge:\nW-Well of course you would've assumed that. It was written in the instructions.Dahlia:\nBut... I was wrong. The person that had actually called my spirit back was... Misty Fey... The picture book author...Judge:\nWh... Whaaaaaaat!?Dahlia:\nWell, that's really the only possibility, isn't it? After I lost consciousness in the garden... ...it was her body that was left lying there... Maya Fey... I wasn't able to kill her with my own hands after all. But even so... I made her commit the most vile sin a human can commit.Judge:\nAnd that is...?Dahlia:\nMatricide. The sin of killing her own mother!Phoenix:\nUgggh... NOOOO WAY!!Judge:\nOr-Order! Order in the court! What is the meaning of this!?Dahlia:\nIt's true that I was the one who attacked Maya Fey... But even so... ...the murderer who actually snuffed out Misty Fey's life was none other than... ...your darling little Maya!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nR-Ridiculous! That's nonsense...Dahlia:\nAre you sure about that? ...Just think about it. There's even evidence supporting these facts, isn't there?Phoenix:\nWhat...!? What do you mean? Wh-What is this so-called evidence!?Dahlia:\n...The fact that Maya Fey has disappeared is evidence enough, isn't it?Phoenix:\nHuh...?Dahlia:\nThe idea that she's still in the Sacred Cavern is just ridiculous. She wasn't able to escape from the Inner Temple, that much is obvious. In that case, there is only one place she could be.Judge:\nWh-Where...?Dahlia:\nDo I have to spell it out? ...The bottom of the Eagle River, where else?Godot:\nEa-Eagle River...!?Dahlia:\nMaya Fey killed her long-lost mother. Can you imagine the guilt she must have felt when she realized that? That's why she threw herself into the Eagle River. Most bodies that wind up in there are lost forever. So, what do you have to say now... Feenie?Phoenix:\nOoooh... Uuuuuhhhh...Phone:\n.........Godot:\n...Oops. Sorry, that's my phone.Phoenix:\n(What kind of ringtone is that...?)Phone:...*beep*...Godot:\n...Godot here. ......... ...OK. Thanks.Phone:...*beep*...Judge:\nW-Was it something important?Godot:\nThey just finished removing the locks from the Sacred Cavern.Phoenix:\nThat's great! What about Maya?Godot:\n... There was a woman in the cave...Judge:\nWas it Maya Fey...?Godot:\nIt was the accused... Sister Iris.Phoenix:\nHuh...?Dahlia:\nDon't look so surprised. ...I locked her in there yesterday. I just got finished telling you that.Phoenix:\nSo... what about Maya? Where is she?Godot:\n... There was no one else found inside the Sacred Cavern.Phoenix:\nN-No... It can't be...Dahlia:\nI told you, didn't I? She's dead.Phoenix:\nNo... Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Judge:\nIt seems... ...that this case has come to an end... A tragic end... Sadly, it appears the killer of Elise Deauxnim, also known as Misty Fey... ...was her own daughter, Maya Fey. Overcome with guilt for what she had done... ...Maya Fey jumped to her death into the raging waters of the Eagle River!Phoenix:\n(It can't be...)...Ha!...Godot:\nTrite... Have you ever heard this one? \"Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth.\" ...No matter how improbable it may seem.Judge:\nWh... What is that supposed to mean, Prosecutor Godot...?Godot:\nAccording to this witness... ...Maya Fey threw herself into the Eagle River. However... is that really the truth?Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nRemember, this woman testified earlier that... ...the bridge was already on fire when the murder was taking place in the garden. Which means if Maya had thrown herself into the river... ...it must have been from the Inner Temple side, near the bridge.Dahlia:\nThat's right! That's where she jumped from...Godot:\nBut that's impossible. It's impossible to jump into the river from there!Phoenix:\n...! (Wh-What...!?)Godot:\nDon't get your panties all twisted up, Trite. Just relax and think through the whole thing again.Phoenix:\n(So it's impossible...? Maya couldn't have thrown herself into Eagle River...?)Judge:\n...Well, Mr. Wright? Ms. Hawthorne claims Ms. Fey threw herself into the river from the Inner Temple side. Do you have any evidence that refutes this claim?Present Hazakura Temple Map or Dusky Bridge Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's impossible to jump into the Eagle River from the Inner Temple side...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\n...That's it? That's your answer?\nGodot:\nHa...! The only one that should be thrown into a river is you.\nPhoenix:\nUgh...!\nGodot:\nBut then again... Even if you did... ...you wouldn't reach the river, would you?\nPhoenix:\n(Huh...? What's that...? I wouldn't reach it...?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Don't get your panties all twisted up, Trite.\"Phoenix:\nIt's impossible to jump into the Eagle River from the Inner Temple side... No one knows that better than this witness!Dahlia:\nWhat did you say...?Phoenix:\nEleven years ago, you jumped into the very same river!Dahlia:\n...!Phoenix:\nJust take a look at this overhead map! As you can see... ...below the cliff on the Inner Temple side is a big rock shelf!Judge:\nOh... Ooooh! Y-You're right!Phoenix:\nShe wouldn't have reached the river if she had jumped off from there. In other words... If she had jumped, we should be able to see her body in this photo!Dahlia:\nAh!Godot:\nHa...! So you finally figured it out!Dahlia:\nYou...! Nooooooooo!Judge:\nO-Order! Order!!Dahlia:\nYou... You're just playing with me! Maya Fey's body is at the bottom of the Eagle River! There's nowhere else she could possibly be hiding!Phoenix:\nMs. Hawthorne... Have you ever heard this one before? \"Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth.\"Dahlia:\nYes, just a few minutes ago.Phoenix:\n...Maya Fey wasn't inside the Sacred Cavern. We now know that she didn't throw herself into the Eagle River.Godot:\n...Correct. That eliminates all the most likely possibilities.Phoenix:\nNow, although it seems improbable, there's still one other place she could be.Judge:\nWh... What...!? What is this one possibility you are talking about...?Dahlia:\nTh-That's obviously a bluff! So where is her dead body then?Phoenix:\n(Finally... I think the pieces are falling into place... Normally the living have no way to punish the dead... But I think there is a way to give Dahlia Hawthorne the ultimate punishment.) ...Shall I tell you, Ms. Hawthorne? Shall I tell you where Maya is this very instant!? Maya Fey is...in the Inner Temple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe Inner Temple was cut off from the outside world on the night of the crime. So in other words, Maya is still there!\nJudge:\n... Mr. Wright, let me ask the question that I'm sure is on everyone's minds. The police scoured the Inner Temple from top to bottom, correct?\nGodot:\nYou bet. Detective Gumshoe had his nose to the ground and sniffed around everywhere.\nJudge:\nThen the fact that Maya is not in the Inner Temple... ...has already been adequately proven, has it not!?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yikes...! Guess my intuition was wrong.\nGodot:\nIntuition...? Truthiness has no place here! Use your brain, not your gut, to find the real truth, Trite!\nLeads back to:\n\"Th-That's obviously a bluff!\"in Hazakura Temple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's already been proven that she isn't on the Inner Temple side! So that means... she must be somewhere in Hazakura Temple!\nJudge:\n... Mr. Wright, let me ask the question that I'm sure is on everyone's minds. The bridge was already on fire when the murder took place, correct?\nGodot:\nJust so you know, my heart is also on fire and it aches from your stupidity.\nJudge:\nSo the impossibility of Maya Fey escaping from the Inner Temple side... ...has already been adequately proven, has it not!?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yikes...! Guess my intuition was wrong.\nGodot:\nIntuition...? Truthiness has no place here! Use your brain, not your gut, to find the real truth, Trite!\nLeads back to:\n\"Th-That's obviously a bluff!\"in this very courtroom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's only one possibility left.\"Phoenix:\nThere's only one possibility left. Namely... she's right here in this very courtroom!Dahlia:\nWh-What!?Godot:\nM-Maya Fey is here!?Judge:\nYou say she's here in m-my courtroom!?Phoenix:\n...Dahlia Hawthorne. I seem to recall that you said... \"I had misunderstood one thing, you see.\"Dahlia:\nSo what!?Phoenix:\nBut I think there's one more thing you misunderstood.Dahlia:\nWhat do you mean...?Phoenix:\nTell me something. At this very moment... ...who is channeling Dahlia Hawthorne!?Dahlia:\nWh-Why that... that's obvious! It's Pearl Fey! That pathetic, little, sniveling runt!Phoenix:\n...You're wrong. Pearls tried... but she couldn't do it.Pearl:\nI've never failed at channeling someone. This is the first time it's happened.Phoenix:\nIsn't there any explanation for why you couldn't channel a spirit?Pearl:\n... It could happen if someone else was already channeling the same spirit.Dahlia:\nSomeone called me before Pearl did...? But who...?Phoenix:\nPearls even tried again on the day after the crime. But she couldn't do it... What could that mean? I think the truth is becoming clearer to you right about now, am I correct?Dahlia:\n... Aaaah!Phoenix:\nIt wasn't Pearls that channeled you! There was someone who called you before she could!Present Maya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...This is an easy one.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, that's not who! How can I come this far and still not get it!? Pearls couldn't channel her. And Maya had disappeared... There's only one possible answer!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! You can mumble to yourself like a wino on your own time!\nPhoenix:\nP-Please... Give me just one more chance...\nLeads back to:\n\"It wasn't Pearls that channeled you!\"Phoenix:\n...This is an easy one. Pearls couldn't do it, and Misty Fey is gone. There's only one possibility left!Judge:\nCome on already...! I can't stand the tension!Phoenix:\nDahlia Hawthorne! The person channeling you right now must be... Maya Fey!Dahlia:\nWh... WHAAAAAAAT!?Judge:\nB-But how could that be!? Remember what this witness, Dahlia Hawthorne, said about her goal!Godot:\nShe said that her goal was to kill Maya Fey.Judge:\nYes, that's right. But if Maya channeled the spirit of someone that was trying to kill her...! ...Godot:\nHa...! Well, gramps? What would happen?Judge:\n... C-Could it be...?Phoenix:\nIt looks like you finally understand, Your Honor.Dahlia:\nW-Well, I don't! What are you going on about!?Phoenix:\nWhat I'm going on about is the reason Maya channeled you... And there's only one reason. To protect herself from you!Dahlia:\nTo... protect herself... ...from me?Phoenix:\nYes. On the night of the crime, you were only interested in one thing.Killing Maya Fey!Phoenix:\nThe path back to Hazakura was closed off and there was nowhere for her to run. (Changed from [The path to the Inner Temple was closed off and there was nowhere for her to run.] in the original release) So then the problem became... \"Where would be the safest place to hide?\"Dahlia:\nAh... Aaaaaaaaaah! Y-You mean... That's when she channeled me...?Phoenix:\nAll this time, you thought you had been channeled by Pearls... (Changed from [All along you thought you had been channeled by Pearls...] in the original release) That's why it never occurred to you... ...that Maya's hiding place... ...was you!Dahlia:\nN-No... No... DON'T SAY THAT! Y-You're saying that I... Dahlia Hawthorne... (Changed from [Y-You're saying that I...] in the original release) ...was played for a fool!? By that little whelp!?Phoenix:\n...Dahlia:\nMaya Fey killed herself! Isn't it obvious!?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nSorry, but no... It would have been impossible for her to jump into the Eagle River. ...This was the only avenue of escape open to Maya. The only way that Maya could disappear from the Inner Temple...!Dahlia:\nI-I don't believe you...! A stupid little girl like that who has never been out in the real world... She could never have come up with a plan like that! Who could have ever given her such a brilliant idea!?Phoenix:\n... Well......Me, of course...Phoenix:\nM... Mia!Dahlia:\nMia Fey!Mia:\nIt's been a long time, Dahlia Hawthorne...Godot:\n... ...So it's true... It was you.Mia:\n...Yes.Godot:\nHa...! You're something else...Dahlia:\nB-But what... what are you doing here...!?Phoenix:\nThat hair... It's Pearls, right?Mia:\nTell me something, Dahlia... I want you to think back to that night one more time. You had just cornered Maya in the Inner Temple's garden. And then... in the final moments of the fight, you lost consciousness.Dahlia:\nI was stabbed! By Maya Fey!Mia:\nActually... Maya lost consciousness at the same time as you.Godot:\n...She did?Judge:\nNot terribly surprising since she was about to be killed.Mia:\n...When she woke up, she was in the Training Hall. That's when Maya decided she needed help... So she channeled me. She explained in a memo the situation she was in. She asked me what I thought she should do.Dahlia:\nShe did that...? I can't believe it...Mia:\nOf course, I didn't have all the details. But... One thing was perfectly clear.Judge:\nAnd that was...?Mia:\nI knew that you couldn't be allowed to wander free.Phoenix:\nFree...? What do you mean?Mia:\nIt was a race against time, so I wrote down two things that Maya had to do. Channel Dahlia Hawthorne as soon as possible... ...and lock herself in the Sacred Cavern until help arrived.Phoenix:\n(So it was Maya who put that lock on there...)Judge:\nYes, but why did you order her to do those two things?Mia:\nIf she hadn't done it... ...Dahlia Hawthorne would've been channeled by someone else. By one Pearl Fey.Phoenix:\nP-Pearls?Mia:\nYes. Pearl didn't properly understand the plan. So all she was trying to do was follow her mother, Morgan Fey's instructions. If she had succeeded in channeling Dahlia Hawthorne's spirit... ...things would have turned out very badly, to put it mildly.Godot:\n......... ...So that's how it was. Dahlia Hawthorne would have used the body of Pearl Fey... ...to kill Maya at all costs.Judge:\nY-Yes, it certainly sounds like that was the intent all along.Dahlia:\nH-How dare you!? I-I won't forget this...!Phoenix:\nWhy not just admit it? ...Dahlia Hawthorne. Your little plan was nothing but a big failure.Mia:\nYes... Another failure to add to the pile of shame, wouldn't you say?Dahlia:\nWh-What do you mean by another!?Phoenix:\nThink about it, Dahlia. Remember all your past crimes? Not a single one of them was a success. They all ended in failure.Dahlia:\nWhat...!? How dare you...!Phoenix:\n11 years ago... The fake kidnapping... Your very first crime. You got your hands on a 2 million dollar diamond. But... ...after Terry Fawles escaped and went to meet with Valerie Hawthorne... ...the truth was exposed.Dahlia:\nSh-Shut your mouth! That wasn't my fault! It was because of that stupid oaf of a prisoner and that weakling of a policewoman!Phoenix:\nAnd then... one year later. You tried to kill me.Dahlia:\n...!Phoenix:\nWell... I'm still alive, but... ...you wound up killing someone else. As a result, you were sentenced to death. ...It's one stupid move after another for you. But it's no longer funny.Dahlia:\nYou...! Wipe that smug, happy-go-lucky smile off your face...!Phoenix:\nAnd now this! You've messed up again! You let Maya Fey escape. Even though she was right there in front of you!Dahlia:\n...Grr...Mmm...Nnnn... Grrr... Ahh! M... M... Mia F... F... Fey Mia Fey! Mia Fey! MIA FEEEEY! You... You... spinster!! I was supposed to kill Maya Fey like I swore I would! And if only you had gotten this spiky-haired jerk the guilty verdict... ...I wouldn't have been hanged to death!Mia:\n...... True.Dahlia:\n...!Mia:\nBut I think you finally understand, Dahlia Hawthorne. ...You will never defeat me.Dahlia:\nWh-What...!? What did you say!?Mia:\nWhether you're alive, dead, or somewhere in between, you will never defeat me. As long as I'm around, you're destined to lose for all of eternity!Dahlia:\nGrrr... Grrrr... Grrrrr...Phoenix:\n...I remember what you said earlier in the trial. You said there was no way we could punish you... ...because you were already dead.Dahlia:\nWhat about it!?Phoenix:\nThen you said... \"Even when the body dies, the spirit, the ego, it lives on... forever.\"Mia:\n...That's very true, Dahlia. And that's exactly the punishment you'll never be able to escape from.Dahlia:\n...!Mia:\nFor all of eternity, you'll have to remain as Dahlia Hawthorne. A miserable, pathetic, weak creature who can never win at anything... And for you, there is no escape from that. No hope of freedom. Since the day you were executed... ...the narrow bridge that once stretched out in front of you has burnt to a crisp!Dahlia:\n...Y-You... OoOooOOh... ...Y-You'RE... wROnG... ...It... CAN'T... be... ...How... coULd... I... ...loSe... to... THe... ...likES... of... YOU...?Phoenix:\nIt no longer matters! I don't care whether you win or lose anymore. The only thing I want... ...is for you to come out of Maya's body right now!Dahlia:\n...... ...... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ...I'M... NOT... READY... ...NOT... READY... TO... GO...Maya:\n...Nick... ...Sis...Judge:\nNow then... I assume you are the real Iris...?Iris:\n...Yes. I was just rescued from the Sacred Cavern.Judge:\nI must say you and your twin sister are indeed identical from what I can see. In any case... It appears that everything has finally been cleared up. Mr. Godot. ...What happened to Dahlia Hawthorne?Godot:\nIf you ask me, Your Honor... ...it looks like she went back to the hell she came from.Judge:\nHmm... It seems that Misty Fey wasn't the only victim of this crime. Maya Fey, as well as the young Pearl Fey... ...were also victims of this wicked and selfish plan.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Judge:\nThe tragedy of \"Medium Valley\" has finally come to an end, it seems. It would be best for everyone if no further attempt was made to channel that spirit again.Phoenix:\n............ Umm... Your Honor?Judge:\nYes, what is it?Phoenix:\nAbout this whole \"spirit medium\" thing... It's almost weird how comfortable you seem to be with the concept now.Judge:\n... Well, to be frank, my younger brother is quite judgmental... He often criticizes me for not studying hard enough. That's why I made a concerted effort to study up on the Kurain Channeling Technique.Phoenix:\n(Hey! Isn't that the New Year's issue of \"Oh! Cult!\"!?)Judge:\n...I've seen quite a few things in my many years on the bench. And in all that time, I've finally learned this one thing. Each case is different, and takes place in its own world, if you will. In order to fully understand that world... ...first we have to immerse ourselves in it completely. And that's where... my brother and I used to differ.Phoenix:\n(Hmm, never thought of it that way...)Judge:\n...At any rate! It's time to pass judgment in the case of Iris of Hazakura Temple.Godot:Godot:\n...You're a little too fast with that gavel, Your Honor.Judge:\nWhat do you mean by that, Mr. Godot!?Mia:\nThis trial... It isn't over yet. ...That's what he means.Phoenix:\nW-What!?Godot:\nTrite... Remember what Miss Evil Spirit said in her testimony?Phoenix:\nHuh? Dahlia's testimony?Dahlia:\nI caught up with her in front of the stone lantern. Then I took out the dagger I got from the storeroom and...Dahlia:\n............ It's strange, but... I don't have a clear memory of what happened after that. I think... I think I was stabbed.Mia:\n...Just as Dahlia Hawthorne was about to attack Maya... ...she was stabbed and \"killed\" by someone.Judge:\nY-Yes... That's right...Godot:\nThe person that was ultimately killed was the spirit medium that channeled Dahlia... ...Elise Deauxnim, no, Misty Fey. But... who killed her? We still don't know who did it!Phoenix:\nTh-This isn't over!?Godot:\nUnless someone else is found guilty, the accused is still on trial. We can't let her walk until there is evidence that proves her innocence.Phoenix:\nN-No way...Judge:\nBut... This court isn't prepared for any further testimony...Godot:\nThe prosecution is ready to call our final witness!Judge:\nF-Final... witness!?Godot:\nThis one will clear up the whole mystery... The mystery of \"Who killed Misty Fey\"!Judge:\n...Hmm, indeed!Mia:\n... Is it really alright... Mr. Prosecutor?Godot:\n... Of course it's alright... Madame Attorney.Judge:\nVery well then... Who is this final witness?Godot:\nHa...! Isn't it obvious? There's one person who saw the whole event and will put the final dagger in this case.Judge:\nS-Someone who saw the murder take place...?Godot:\n...The very person who saw her mother killed in front of her own eyes.Phoenix:\nY-You... You mean Maya!? (Changed from [Y-You mean... Maya!?] in the original release) ...You can't! She can't testify after what she's just been through!Godot:\nWe need to find the truth. The prosecution calls Maya Fey to the witness stand!Judge:\n...Very well. But first, we'll take a brief recess. ...We'll have to wait for Ms. Fey to recover before summoning her. Once we receive the doctor's permission, we will proceed with the trial!Godot:\n...Hey, Trite. I've got something to say to you, so listen up.Phoenix:\n...What is it?Godot:\nI don't think much of you as a lawyer. It's always the same with you. ...You somehow manage to just squeak by without even a faint understanding of the case. Some beautiful woman always seems to come dashing in at the last minute to save you.Phoenix:\nY-You've got some nerve!Godot:\n...But that's not going to happen this time. This time... you're going to have to do this by yourself.Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nThat's enough! This court is now in recess!February 10, 2:56 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Iris:\nI'm truly sorry about everything. You were working so hard to defend me... But I was missing all day, and we didn't even have a chance to talk...Phoenix:\n(...She's right. When I met \"Iris\" at the Training Hall yesterday... ...they had already switched places... and Iris was inside the Sacred Cavern.)Iris:\n...I wanted to at least be in the defendant's box today to root you on.Phoenix:\nW-Well, it wasn't you fault. You were locked up this whole time... There's something more important than that, though. I have to ask you... Why did you help your sister out as much as you did?Iris:\nHuh...?Phoenix:\nIf you had tried to get help at the Sacred Cavern yesterday... ...you wouldn't have spent an entire day locked up in there.Iris:\n... My sister... I felt sorry for her. She was abandoned by our mother and never got any love from our father either.Phoenix:\nYes, but... it was the same for you too, wasn't it?Iris:\nYes, but at least I had Sister Bikini, who was like a mother to me. If only Dahlia had come with me to Hazakura Temple... I always... I always loved her... Dahlia was always so smart, so strong... She never complained about a thing. That's why I... That's why I promised her that I would help her.Phoenix:\nAre you talking about the fake kidnapping case 11 years ago?Iris:\n...Yes. I-I wanted to be useful to her in some way... B-But, as usual... I was too cowardly... At the last minute, I ran away. Because of that... Dahlia's stepsister, Valerie, ended up... (Changed from [Dahlia's half-sister, Valerie, ended up...] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(That was the case that wounded Mia so badly...)Iris:\nBut... things didn't end there, of course. Some people suspected that my sister was involved in the murder.Phoenix:\nSome people...? You must mean...Iris:\nYes, two defense attorneys. (Changed from [Yes, two defense lawyers.] in the original release) Mia Fey... and Diego Armando. After poisoning Mr. Armando, who was getting too close to learning the truth... ...Dahlia even tried to kill the person who had unknowingly hid the poison for her. You.Phoenix:\n(...That's right...) ...Iris. There's one more thing that I have to ask you.Iris:\nYes, what is it?Phoenix:\nOn the night of the murder... ...the person that cleaned up the corpse of the victim, Elise Deauxnim... Was it... Was it really you?Iris:\n... Yes... It was me. That night, after I rang the lights out bell... I went back to my room. At around 10:30, I received a call on my cell phone.Phone:\n......... ...*beep*...\"There's a problem... Come to the Inner Temple right away.\"Iris:\nI... I got on the snowmobile and headed for the Inner Temple. But...!Phoenix:\nThe path to the Inner Temple was cut off... Right?Iris:\nExactly.Phone:\n......... ...*beep*...\"We can't just leave the body here... So you've got to do this exactly as I say, got it? (Changed from [...Alright, let's do this as you said...] in the original release)\"Iris:\nIt was me... I was the one that received her body. The murder weapon had been left in her body so she wouldn't bleed too much. The staff that Mystic Elise always held...Phoenix:\nI knew it... So the actual murder weapon was the staff.Iris:\n...Yes, that's right. I brought the body back to Hazakura Temple on the snowmobile.Phoenix:\nBut why... Why did you alter the body?Iris:\n...I didn't want anyone to know that the staff was the murder weapon. I didn't want to leave anything that would lead back to Misty Fey... So I dressed her in a robe and stabbed her with the Shichishito... I wiped the blood off the staff's blade and left it next to her on the ground.Phoenix:\n...Iris. Just tell me one last thing. Tell me the name of the person that called your cell phone. The real killer.Iris:\n... I'm sorry, Mr. Wright... I can't do it... I can't say who did it.Phoenix:\n... I... I see...Victim's Staff updated in the Court Record.Bailiff:\n...Defendant!Iris:\n...Y-Yes...Bailiff:\nThe judge is calling you! He wants you to see you in his chambers. He has some questions about Dahlia Hawthorne.Iris:\n...Alright. ... Well then... I'll see you later... There's something I want to tell you. (Changed from [There's something I want to tell you later.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nOh, um... OK... (\"Something she wants to tell me\"? So it's true... Iris cooperated with the real killer... Maybe even from the very beginning!)Mia:\n...Phoenix.Phoenix:\nMia...! Umm... H-How is Maya doing!?Mia:\nPhysically, I'm not worried. She'll recover completely. But emotionally, she's been hurt very badly by this case.Phoenix:\nI-I see... ...! You don't mean...! She's learned who Elise Deauxnim really was?Mia:\n...Yes. I went to the medical office and talked with her. I told her everything I knew.Phoenix:\n...But why?Mia:\nMaya is stronger than you think... I knew she could take it... All of it.Phoenix:\nWhat do you mean by that?Mia:\nI want you to figure that answer out by yourself. ...The trial is about to restart. The real killer... Do you know who it is yet?Phoenix:\n(Iris wouldn't tell me who called her. But still... I think that just maybe... I know who it was.) That night, the victim was killed in the garden of the Inner Temple. And the criminal wasn't just there by accident. Which means... ...that the killer knew of Dahlia's plan from the very beginning.Mia:\n...And one more thing. The victim was moved to the Hazakura Temple side by pendulum. In other words... the criminal couldn't cross the bridge. That means they were stuck on the Inner Temple side for almost an entire day.Phoenix:\n(Exactly. So the culprit... (Changed from [Exactly. So the criminal...] in the original release) ...was someone that wasn't in Hazakura Temple the following day...!)Mia:\n... That's as much help as I can give you. The rest of the battle is yours to win... or lose.Phoenix:\nOK, I've got it. ...Thank you, Mia. (Finally... It's almost time to bring this case to an end. What exactly did Maya see anyway...? And who was it that actually killed Misty Fey? Whoever it was, I have to prove it... Me. All by myself.)To be continued.February 10, 3:36 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 7Judge:\nNow then, before we proceed any further... ...I'm going to announce the results of the tests we had performed earlier.Phoenix:\nTests...?Judge:\nYes, tests. On the bloody dagger that was found stuck in the pine tree.Phoenix:\nOh yeah! That! (I totally forgot about it.)Godot:\nThat's the weapon that Maya Fey used when she fought with the victim.Phoenix:\nSo what are the results!? Was it the victim's blood, or...?Judge:\nDue to time constraints, a full test wasn't possible. However... There's one thing we can say with certainty. The blood that was on this dagger was not the victim's blood! ...That is all. Now then, let's restart this trial.Phoenix:\n(So it wasn't Misty's blood on the dagger... Then whose was it...?)Dagger updated in the Court Record.Judge:\nI'm sure both the defense and the prosecution know this, but... ...this trial is rapidly coming to a close. Both sides will need to show some firm evidence with their claims.Phoenix:\nI understand, Your Honor.Godot:\nFrom what I've heard... ...the witness is dangerously weak, physically speaking. So, let's finish this quickly.Phoenix:\n...Agreed.Judge:\nVery well! Please bring in the last witness!Godot:\n...Witness, please tell us your name and profession.Maya:\nMaya Fey. My profession is... Umm... I'm the assistant manager at Wright & Co. Law Offices.Phoenix:\n(Maya...)Judge:\nAccording to the magazine I have here... ...you're a spirit medium of the Kurain Channeling Technique...Maya:\n... I... I'm frightened. The Fey clan... I don't want any more to do with it.Phoenix:\n(Oh, Maya... The pain the Fey bloodline causes must be unbearable...)Judge:\n...Very well. Now then, Ms. Fey. When the event occurred... you were in the garden of the Inner Temple. And... You witnessed the moment of Ms. Elise Deauxnim's murder. ...Is this correct?Maya:\n... I, umm... I... I didn't see anyth--Godot:Godot:\nStraighten up this instant, young lady! (Changed from [Straighten up this moment, young lady!] in the original release)Maya:\nHuh...?Godot:\nPick your head up and speak clearly. There's always time for crying later.Maya:\nB-But I...Godot:\nYour mother was killed right in front of your eyes! There's nothing you can do to change that fact.Maya:\n...!Godot:\nBut there's something you can do... You can finish this. You've been watching the whole thing right? You've seen the witnesses come out and you've seen us squeeze the truth out of them. Now it's your turn. ...Let's hear your testimony. On the night of the crime... what exactly did you see happen!?Judge:\nWitness. If you please.Maya:\n...Yes, Your Honor.Witness Testimony-- At the Inner Temple --Maya:\nI was passing through the garden on the way to a spare prep room when it happened.\nSuddenly, someone struck me over the head...\nI stumbled... and ended up against the stone lantern.\nI think I screamed, \"Help me!\"\nThen something warm splashed over me...\nThat's when... I lost consciousness.Judge:\nHmm... So you were struck on the head... I suppose it must have been this staff.Phoenix:\nMaya! The person who hit you... It was Dahlia Hawthorne, wasn't it!?Maya:\nI-I'm sorry, Nick. I just... I couldn't see... I don't know who it was...Phoenix:\nMaya, think hard...Maya:\nSorry, Nick, but I really couldn't!Godot:\nHa...! Can't say it was an especially good night for young ladies to be walking around alone.Judge:\nIt seems that it will be hard to determine the criminal through testimony alone.

But I remember her saying that Iris would be coming later as well.\nPhoenix:\n(On the day after the incident, Edgeworth met Bikini at Hazakura Temple. That means she couldn't be the criminal.) So then... did Iris actually come later like she said?\nMaya:\nWell, umm... Let me think...\nPhoenix:\n(She seems confused. It's probably because she's so tired...)\nMaya:\nNo... I'm sure I didn't see her. She must have come while I was preparing for the training.Maya:\nSuddenly, someone struck me over the head...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho did it? Who hit you?\nMaya:\nAh... Well... I didn't see who it was... I was hit from behind.\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't see the person...? But after that, your attacker was in front of you!

It was dark, that's it!\nJudge:\nIt was dark...?\nMaya:\nIt's not good to have too much light around when someone is undergoing spiritual training.\nJudge:\nHmm... Come to think of it, there was earlier testimony to that effect as well. So it was dark in the garden on the night of the crime...\nPhoenix:\n(Which is why she didn't see her attacker...

I-I was in a state of panic. There were only two things rolling around in my mind at the time.\nJudge:\nWell now...! This is beginning to get interesting!\nPhoenix:\nSo what were the two things rolling around in your mind?\nMaya:\nUmm... \"My name is Maya Fey. One plus one equals two\"...\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nYou see, for some crazy reason, I was afraid I was going to lose my memory. I know it's odd considering my life was in danger, but that's how it was...\nJudge:\nThat's not odd at all. Your actions are understandable, given the circumstances. So... What did you do then?Maya:\nI think I screamed, \"Help me!\"Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou think you screamed, but you're not sure?\nMaya:\nListen, I was a complete wreck! It was dark and I couldn't see my attacker... Was it a man? A woman? An adult? A child? I had no idea... I was scared out of my wits!\nJudge:\nBelieve me, my dear...

Do I press her for more details...?)\n\n\n\nWhat did she scream?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're certain that you screamed, \"Help me!\"?\nMaya:\nUmm... I think so. Now that I think about it... Yeah, that's gotta be what I screamed.\nGodot:\nHa...! Is it all that strange, Trite, for her to have screamed, \"Help me\"?\nPhoenix:\n(No, but... Something about that bugs me...

Look, you were facing an attacker that you couldn't see and you screamed, right? You screamed, \"Help me!\"\nMaya:\nUm, yeah.\nPhoenix:\nBut you testified that you screamed that because you thought it was your last hope.\nMaya:\nOh... Well, you know... That's like... What do you call it when that happens...\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's not doing so well up there...)\nMaya:\nOh, yeah. Umm, I... Oh! That's right! I remember now... I was facing my attacker, but that's not who I was screaming at.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What did you just say...?\nMaya:\nYeah, that's right... It was the person behind my attacker that I was yelling at.

They always light it when an acolyte is there for training.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nH-Hey!

The witness could describe a person that was standing behind her attacker... And she quite clearly described him as a man!Maya:\nAh...!Phoenix:\n...In other words!

What is visible in the dark!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"...Alright, Mr. Wright. Time to show us what you've got.\"Phoenix:\nBecause it was pitch black, Ms. Fey was able to recognize the killer easily. I'm sure the court would like to see for itself how this is possible, yes?Judge:\nWhat!? B-But how do you propose to show us something like that!?Phoenix:\n...It's easy.

Well then, let's continue with the testimony. Please tell us how you knew the killer was a man!Maya:\n...Y-Yes, Your Honor. I didn't realize it until after I woke up, but...Witness Testimony-- The Killer --Maya:\n...When I came to, I was just lying there on the Training Hall floor.\nBy the time I got back to the garden, the place had totally changed...\nThe torches were lit... And the body was gone.\nAnd all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.\nSince the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...Judge:\nHmm... So it was after the crime took place that the witness came to think the killer was a man.Maya:\nYes... That's right...I'm sorry, Your Honor, I...Judge:\nNo need to apologize. It's as Mr. Godot said... You're utterly exhausted. It's only natural that you would be a little confused.Godot:\n...Judge:\nAlso, if you consider the situation you described... ...it doesn't seem too much of a stretch to assume the criminal was a man.

I felt like the killer was hiding the evidence for me... for my sake...\nJudge:\nWh-What? Hiding it for you...!?\nMaya:\nEveryone knew that I was the only one at the Inner Temple that night. If Sister Bikini had come back and looked at the garden...\nPhoenix:\n...She may have thought that you had done it...\nJudge:\n...No, she definitely would have thought so. And you're saying that's why the killer... ...cleaned up the crime scene to make it look like nothing had happened...?\nMaya:\nYes. I'm sure of it.\nJudge:\nWell, that's certainly an important piece of information!

If the body and the blood hadn't been removed... ...I would've immediately been the prime suspect, right?\nJudge:\nYes, I suppose that's true.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, and if that happened, the body would have caused some other problems, too. If her real identity had come out right then, it would have been terrible. \"Master of Kurain Killed by Own Daughter!\" I don't think Maya would've been able to handle it...)\nJudge:\nBut still... It's rather difficult to fathom the killer's motives. What reason is there to go through that much trouble to protect you...?\nMaya:\n...Present Stone Lantern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The body of Elise Deauxnim was carried all the way to Hazakura Temple's courtyard.\"Maya:\nThe torches were lit... And the body was gone.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe torches were lit?\nMaya:\nYes. That's how I noticed that the whole scene had changed.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm going to say it was the killer who lit the torches... I mean, who else could it be?)\nJudge:\nThe killer probably lit them since it'd be impossible to do any cover-up work in the dark. However, if that's true, there's one thing that still bothers me. Why did the killer go to the effort of moving the body?\nPhoenix:\n(That's true... It's hard to see how that would be of any advantage to the killer. The only one who would gain anything from that would be... ...the only person that was at the Inner Temple, Maya.)\nMaya:\n...\nJudge:\nVery well... Let me hear some more about the condition of the crime scene.Maya:\nAnd all of the snow around the stone lantern had been carefully cleaned up, too.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying the killer cleaned up the snow? (It did look really odd... The snow was removed in an unnatural-looking rectangular shape around the lantern...)\nMaya:\nThere were a lot of shovels around the Inner Temple. But they're all really heavy. Way too heavy for me to use.\nJudge:\n...An odd fellow indeed, this killer. Why on earth would anyone want to take snow away?\nPhoenix:\nWell there's one thing I can think of... Didn't you say that a lot of the victim's blood sprayed onto the snow?\nMaya:\nY-Yeah... The area I collapsed in ended up being splattered.\nPhoenix:\nIn other words... ...the killer's purpose was to hide the bloody snow. I think that's the most reasonable explanation.\nJudge:\nHmm, perhaps... However, there's something that's bothering me. If the killer just wanted to hide the snow with blood on it... ...there was no need to remove that amount.\nPhoenix:\n(That's true... He could have scooped up just the snow that was stained with blood.)\nJudge:\nIt looks like there are some mysteries behind this issue.\nMaya:\n...But, I think this will help explain them!Maya:\nSince the person did all that work alone, I just assumed it was a man...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're saying that you never saw the killer, right?\nMaya:\nY-Yes.\nPhoenix:\nBut earlier you very clearly stated that... ...you saw a man behind your attacker.\nMaya:\n... Nick... I'm sorry...Phoenix:\n(The killer certainly went through a lot of trouble... Moving the body by pendulum, manipulating the crime scene... But for what purpose...? Why do all that? Maybe Maya knows more than she's letting on...)Phoenix:\nThe body of Elise Deauxnim was carried all the way to Hazakura Temple's courtyard. Then at the garden, the real scene of the crime... ...the snow that we suspect was covered in blood was scooped up and removed. It's reasonable to believe all this was done in an attempt to hide the true crime scene. However... There's still one matter that still seems somewhat odd.Godot:\nOh? And what would that be?Phoenix:\nYou must have figured it out by now, Mr. Godot... It's the message written in blood on the lantern.Godot:\n...!Phoenix:\nIt was written very clearly on the white stone lantern. \"Maya\"...Maya:\nAh...Phoenix:\nIf the killer was so motivated to protect Maya from suspicion... ...then why didn't they wipe the writing off the lantern? (Changed from [...then why didn't he wipe the writing off the lantern?] in the original release)Judge:\nAaaaaaah! You're right! Order! Order! Order! B-But, Mr. Wright! Isn't it a fact that the killer was trying to cover up the crime scene...?Phoenix:\nIndeed. But it doesn't make much sense to move the body and remove the bloody snow... ...then not wipe off the most incriminating thing of all -- the bloody writing!Godot:Godot:\nBut if that's the case... ...do you have an explanation for the killer's mysterious behavior? Why would this killer move the body and remove all that snow... ...but then leave the bloody writing on the lantern...?Phoenix:\n(I don't know what the killer's plan was... ...but it's a fact that the killer left the writing on the lantern. There must be a reason for it!)Judge:\nWell then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion. Why did the killer leave the message written in blood on the lantern?The killer wrote it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's only one reason... And it's easier to spot than Sister Bikini in a bikini. It's because the killer is the one who wrote it!\nJudge:\n......\nMaya:\n......\nGodot:\n......\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nJudge:\n...Too bad, Mr. Wright. Don't you remember the testimony of that rather pathetic, vile woman?\n\n\nDahlia:\nI think... I think I was stabbed. Anyway, I suddenly lost consciousness... But before I did... I scrawled her name on the lantern. I had hoped it would cast suspicion on Maya.\n\n\nPhoenix:\n... Oh yeah... She did say that, didn't she...?\nGodot:\nHa...! You and Dahlia... I'm not sure which one of you is more pathetic!\nPhoenix:\nUgggghhh!\nPhoenix:\n(I've got to recall everything I've seen and heard up to this point! The answer is there somewhere!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion.\"To pin the crime on Maya.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's only one reason! One as obvious as Jean Armstrong in a thong on the Riviera! ...The killer was trying to pin the crime on Maya!\nJudge:\n......\nMaya:\n......\nGodot:\n......\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nMaya:\nUmm, Nick. I shouldn't have to be the one to tell you this, but... If the killer had meant to put the blame on me... ...then why didn't the killer leave the crime scene as it was?\nPhoenix:\nOh...\nJudge:\nOnce again, you've been pointing that finger where it doesn't belong!\nPhoenix:\nUgggghhh!\nPhoenix:\n(I've got to recall everything I've seen and heard up to this point! The answer is there somewhere!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well then, Mr. Wright! Let's hear your opinion.\"The killer didn't notice it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Prosecutor Godot. Earlier in this trial, you gave me some good advice.\"Phoenix:\n...Prosecutor Godot. Earlier in this trial, you gave me some good advice. \"Once you eliminate the impossible... ...whatever remains must be the truth.\"Godot:\nMaybe you're not as dumb as I thought.Phoenix:\nThe real killer wanted to disguise the fact that a crime occurred there. If that's the case... They wouldn't have left the bloody writing on the stone lantern on purpose! Therefore, it must mean that they didn't notice it...Maya:\nB-But... That doesn't make any sense! The torches were all lit and everything... There's no way any normal person would miss something as glaring as that!Phoenix:\nYou're right... There is no way any \"normal\" person would.Judge:\nWhat...? What are you trying to say, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\nThere's only one person involved in this incident... ...who could have missed seeing the bloody writing altogether.Judge:\nAnd who would that be!? Who is the person that could have failed to notice the bloody writing!?Present Godot profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Godot...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\n...I think I'll leave some bloody writing when I die, too. I'll write... \"Wright Left\".\nPhoenix:\nH-Huh?\nJudge:\nYou have no idea what you're talking about, do you?\nPhoenix:\n(Is he telling me I need to leave the courtroom...?)\nGodot:\nHey, Trite... You can play after the trial is over!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure I'm on the right track! I've just got to think more carefully about all that's happened up to this point!)\nLeads back to:\n\"There's only one person involved in this incident...\"Phoenix:\nMr. Godot... This is what you said yesterday...Godot:\nMy eyesight is pretty messed up. Even with these huge goggles on my head, I still can't see everything.Judge:\nYou can't see everything!? Is that correct, Mr. Godot!?Godot:\n...Phoenix:\nThis lantern was submitted as evidence today. I would like the court to think back to the moment it was first presented.Judge:\nTh-This lantern... There's something written on it! Wh-Why... It's written in blood!Godot:\nHmph... Nonsense! This lantern... It's as clean as a whistle!Phoenix:\n...Mr. Godot. Just admit it. There are certain colors you can't see... Correct?Godot:\n...Phoenix:\nYou can't see red on a white background, can you? ...That's right. We went through this once before. During the poisoning case at Tr\u00e9s Bien...Godot:\nThis is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time. And somehow spilled coffee on.Judge:\nThere's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?Godot:\nBloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?Judge:\nDon't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!Godot:\nThat's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix:\nYou could see the coffee on the white apron... ...But you couldn't see the ketchup. Because it was red.Godot:\n... Ha...! It's strange... In a black and white photo, those letters would have appeared black to me... I wonder... Why am I the only one that can't see them...?Judge:\nS-So then... Mr. Godot! Are you admitting it!? Are you admitting that you can't see the red writing on the lantern!? (Changed from [Are you admitting that you couldn't see the red writing on the lantern!?] in the original release)Godot:\n...Hey, gramps. Didn't you know? That's the reason why I don't drink red tea!Phoenix:\n(I wasn't sure about it until now, but... I just can't believe it... Prosecutor Godot is the murderer! But... There's no going back now. I've finally figured out the truth...!) ...Mr. Godot. The defense at this time formally accuses you. You are the murderer of Ms. Elise Deauxnim, also known as Ms. Misty Fey!Judge:\nIt's hard to believe this may be true. However... ...once again Mr. Wright has brought up a disquieting fact about you!Godot:\nHa...! Just make sure you don't fill out the indictment in red ink, gramps. Come on... How does a little graffiti make me into the killer?Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nBesides, it's not like it's my name that's written there.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nI'm certain that the killer wasn't able to see the color red!Godot:\nThis is rich. Do go on, Trite.Phoenix:\nThe answer is right there at the crime scene. In the snow...Judge:\nThe snow? How so?Phoenix:\nWell, for example, why did the killer move all that snow...? Your Honor, you said it yourself. If they wanted to hide the bloody snow, why not take out just that area?Judge:\nYes, why didn't he take just that area...? Ah! C-Could it be...!? (Changed from [Yes, why didn't they take just that area...? Ah! C-Could it be...!?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nYes. The killer couldn't see the red blood that had seeped into the snow. And so, he had to remove all of the snow! He couldn't be sure of where the blood had landed, so he removed the whole area!Godot:Godot:\nIsn't it more likely that the killer couldn't see the blood because it was dark?Phoenix:\n...Not a chance. The torches were all lit. He would have been able to see just fine. (Changed from [The torches were all lit. They would have been able to see fine.] in the original release)Judge:\n......It seems... ...that once again, this trial has taken an unexpected turn, to say the least. Can you explain this, Mr. Godot!????:Maya:\nW-Wait! Wait just a minute! (Changed from [W-Wait! Just wait a minute!] in the original release)Phoenix:\nMaya!Judge:\nWh-What is it, witness?Maya:\nM-Mr. Godot... isn't the killer...! After all, he didn't even come to the Inner Temple... ...until 2 days after the murder took place! He didn't show up until after that old bridge got fixed up!Godot:Godot:\nMaya...Maya:\n...!Godot:\nYou can't testify to something like that.Maya:\nWhy...? What do you mean!? I may not look it, but I'm-- Eeeeeeeek!!Godot:\nAfter the murder happened... you didn't even exist.Judge:\nShe didn't...? I'm afraid I don't follow...Godot:\nAre you senile, old man? We established this just a little while ago. After the murder, this witness was unconscious for a long time. Because she was channeling Dahlia Hawthorne.Judge:\nOh... That's right...Maya:\nP-Please, Your Honor! Let me add to my testimony! ...Nick! Please listen to me...!Phoenix:\n...... (Maya... Do you plan to cover for Godot no matter what the cost...? If that's the case, then I've got no choice.) ...Your Honor! Let's hear her testimony. If it means we're going to hear the whole truth, I say we should not silence her.Godot:\nHa...! Nicely done, Trite.Judge:\nVery well, let's hear the witness's testimony. Please tell us what happened at the Inner Temple after the murder.Maya:\nYes, sir.

Pearl Fey.Judge:\nHmm... So when did you hear about this?Maya:\nOh, just a while ago... When I was in the medical office.Judge:\nI'm terribly sorry... But what you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony.Maya:\nWhaaaat!? Come on! Pearly would never tell a lie! She's a way more honest person than I'll ever be!Phoenix:\n(Real smart, Maya. You always know the best things to say when you're under oath...)Godot:\nHa...! The prosecution has no objection.

However, Dahlia Hawthorne was already there... ...possessing the body of Elise Deauxnim.)Maya:\nThe next morning, she looked around, but couldn't find anyone.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nShe searched the entire Inner Temple side, end to end...?\nMaya:\nWell, you see... Pearly gets pretty scared when she's alone. And there weren't that many places to look... She says that she even went back and forth several times.\nPhoenix:\nThe Inner Temple side has two structures: the Training Hall and a spare prep room...\nMaya:\nAnd there's also a storage shack, I think... That's about it.\nPhoenix:\n(There was a storage shack, too?) ...Pearls was looking for other people, right?\nPhoenix:\nWould she have really examined a storage shack all that carefully...?\nMaya:\n... Well, if it was me, that would be the first place I would investigate!\nJudge:\nHmm... So that means it's possible that someone may have been hiding in the storage shack.Maya:\nThe next day, when the bridge was finally fixed, she was in the spare prep room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPearls didn't hear the sound of them working on the bridge?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nI was just wondering why she would stay in the prep room. If it was me, I'd at least go out and wait at the foot of the bridge.\nMaya:\n...Oh. Well, Pearly said she was sleeping at the time. She said she was so scared during the night... ...that she couldn't sleep well and woke up a bunch of times.\nJudge:\nPoor little girl... All alone like that...\nGodot:\nWell, we know that she had at least one friend in the Sacred Cavern. ...Dahlia Hawthorne, who was busy battling with the trick lock...\nPhoenix:\n(She couldn't let anyone see her... So she wouldn't have shown herself to Pearls.)\nGodot:\nWhat happened after the bridge was finally fixed...?Maya:\nThat's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo it was your first time on the Inner Temple side, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nHmm? That's funny. Am I imagining things, or did the defense ask me a question?\nJudge:\n...Mr. Wright, please save your questions for the witness.\nPhoenix:\n\"What you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony.\" Those are your words. ...Your Honor.\nJudge:\n... Touch\u00e9, Mr. Wright. Oh well... What do you have to say, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nHot nights and even hotter coffee... That's what I always say. If it hadn't have been for this case, I never would have visited there. A freezing cold temple in the mountains... I think I'll pass!\nPhoenix:\n(So he had never visited Hazakura Temple or the Inner Temple, huh...?)\nGodot:\n...Ha! You want to say something, Trite?\nPhoenix:\n(In any case, I have to find a crack in Godot's armor! While I cross-examine Maya, that is...)\nJudge:\nVery well, please go on with your testimony. After fixing the bridge, the policemen came over to the Inner Temple side, right?\nMaya:\nYes! Then Mr. Godot...Press (after selecting \"Godot's investigation\" upon pressing fifth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo it was your first time on the Inner Temple side, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nHmm? That's funny. Am I imagining things, or did the defense ask me a question?\nJudge:\n...Mr. Wright, please save your questions for the witness.\nPhoenix:\n\"What you heard from someone else is simply not admissible as testimony.\" Those are your words. ...Your Honor.\nJudge:\n... Touch\u00e9, Mr. Wright. Oh well... What do you have to say, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nHot nights and even hotter coffee... That's what I always say. If it hadn't have been for this case, I never would have visited there. A freezing cold temple in the mountains... I think I'll pass!\nPhoenix:\n(So he had never visited Hazakura Temple or the Inner Temple, huh...?)\nGodot:\n...Ha! You want to say something, Trite?\nPhoenix:\n(It's just like I thought. Godot is lying! If his first visit to the Inner Temple really was after the incident.. He shouldn't know about that piece of evidence!)\nJudge:\nVery well, please go on with your testimony. After fixing the bridge, the policemen came over to the Inner Temple side, right?\nMaya:\nYes! Then Mr. Godot...Present Hanging Scroll (after selecting \"Godot's investigation\" upon pressing fifth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Mr. Godot.\"Maya:\nHe found Pearly first, and cheered her right up!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nH-He cheered her up...?\nMaya:\nThat's what Pearly said... She said he was a very nice older gentleman. Thank you for looking after my cousin, Mr. Godot!\nJudge:\nAnd here I was thinking you were nothing more than a coffee-addict.\nGodot:\nHa...! Cut it out... ...You're making me blush.\nPhoenix:\n(This guy is really beginning to get on my nerves... In more ways than one...)\nGodot:\nThe truth is there aren't that many places to look on the Inner Temple side. The policemen were all busy going over the garden with fine-toothed combs. So I decided to carry out an investigation in my own way... Godot-style!\nJudge:\nI'm the same way. I like to hand down verdicts in my own way, Judge-style!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, maybe I should ask some questions, Phoenix-Style...)\n\n\n\nForget it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? Do you have anything to add?\nPhoenix:\nNo. I give up... This whole Phoenix-style thing, I mean.\nJudge:\nIt seems... ...this phrase has become overused, so I'm putting an end to it... Judge-style.\nPhoenix:\n(Then let it go already!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nCheering Pearls up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you cheered Pearls up?\nGodot:\nWhen I found that little girl... ...the first thing she asked about was her cousin, Maya Fey.\nMaya:\nReally...?\nGodot:\nThe bridge had burned down and she was huddled up in that tiny shack with no heat... Even though she must have had a truly terrifying night out there... ...she asked about you before she said a thing about herself.\nMaya:\nP-Pearly...\nGodot:\nI noticed that you weren't anywhere on the Inner Temple side. But... I couldn't find it in me to tell her that. So I gave her my last cup. With milk and sugar... To hide the bitterness of the harsh truth.\nJudge:\nWh-What a sweet story... *sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(He had a thermos of coffee? Why doesn't that surprise me?)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nGodot's investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou said that you conducted an investigation of your own. Did you find anything?\nGodot:\nIt looks like my investigation went about as well as yours, Trite. After all, I did miss the bloody writing on the lantern.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I didn't miss it, so speak for yourself, Goggles!)\nGodot:\nThe only odd thing I discovered was the beauty in the Training Hall.\nPhoenix:\nBeauty...?\nGodot:\n...Misty Fey, naturally. Clad in her stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes.\nPhoenix:\n(Western tastes...? Could he find a stranger way to describe gravy...?)\nJudge:\nSo from there you headed for the prep room?\nPhoenix:\n...... (Wait a sec... What did Godot say just now? I think I just found his proverbial weak spot!)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\n(There's only one thing of any importance here... Where was Godot when the murder was taking place? He must have already been at the Inner Temple when it happened. Otherwise, he couldn't have killed Elise Deauxnim!)Phoenix:\n...Mr. Godot. The first time you crossed Dusky Bridge and went into the Inner Temple... ...was long before the murder took place.Godot:\n...Maya:\nWh-Why do you say that!?Phoenix:\nBecause he just made one fatal slip-up. The hanging scroll in the Training Hall...Judge:\nHanging scroll...?Maya:\nB-But! Mr. Godot is right! That scroll shows a picture of my mother!Phoenix:\nMaya... I know you know who it is, but here's something you didn't know. By the time the bridge had been repaired, two days after the murder... ...the hanging scroll in the Training Hall looked like this.Judge:\nWhat's that wonderfully delicious smell!?Phoenix:\nThe morning after the crime, someone covered it with gravy.Maya:\nGravy...? But why gravy, Nick?Phoenix:\nBecause gravy was much more than a condiment to the culprit. Well, Mr. Godot!? If you really hadn't seen the hanging scroll until after the murder... ...you wouldn't have had any way of knowing that it was Misty Fey!Maya:Maya:\nW-Wait a minute, Nick!Phoenix:\n...Yes?Maya:\nT-Take another look at the hanging scroll! Look! At the top...! There's a crest there!Phoenix:\nAh, that. It's the mark of the Master, correct?Maya:\nExactly! So if you know the meaning of the mark...Judge:\n...Then you could guess that it was a picture of Misty Fey on there!Phoenix:\nTrue, but Mr. Godot described what was underneath like this. \"Clad in her stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes.\"Maya:\nOh...Phoenix:\nYes, it's possible that he knew what the crest meant. ...However! He couldn't have known that she was wearing Japanese clothing! Mr. Godot! On the day of the murder... ...you were hiding at the Inner Temple, long before the crime took place!Godot:\nCan I ask you just one little thing, Trite?Phoenix:\n...What is it?Godot:\nThis whole theory of yours... It all rests on a certain assumption. That I knew beforehand that a crime was going to be committed.Maya:\nTh-That's right! Otherwise there's no reason for him to sneak onto the crime scene...Phoenix:\n... Of course Mr. Godot knew about the plan.Maya:\nHuh...?Judge:\nWh-What did you say!? Is it really possible that another person knew of that plan!?Present Burnt Letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...This crime was actually planned over a year ago.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\n...Mr. Wright. At this stage of the game... a mere guess is simply unacceptable.\nGodot:\n...So in the end, you were just bluffing, huh? Well, don't expect any sympathy cards from me, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n(But there's only one way he could have known about the crime!)\nJudge:\n...Mr. Wright, I'll give you just one more chance.\nLeads back to:\n\"Of course Mr. Godot knew about the plan.\"Phoenix:\n...This crime was actually planned over a year ago. Morgan Fey authored the plan for her daughter's future... ...and these instructions were hidden somewhere in Fey Manor for a year... However, by the time little Pearls found these instructions... ...they had already been unsealed.Judge:\nUnsealed...?Phoenix:\nYes. The killer had read these instructions long before Pearls ever found them. That's how he knew the crime was to take place at the Inner Temple!Godot:\nAnd you still insist this crafty killer... is me? (Changed from [And you're saying this crafty killer... is me?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nYou bet I do. (Changed from [You bet I am.] in the original release)Godot:\nBut you just said that the instructions were hidden...Maya:\nTh-That's right! Mr. Godot couldn't have known where the instructions were hidden!Phoenix:\nIf he really wanted to know, he had one great chance to find out.Judge:\nY-Yes, and when was that...?Phoenix:\n...During a visit.Maya:\nA visit?Phoenix:\nMorgan Fey told her daughter, Pearl, about where the instructions were hidden... ...during one of her visits to the detention center. That would be the only time for someone to have learned where they were hidden.Judge:\nEa-Eavesdropping on a visit at the detention center!Phoenix:\nYes, it could be arranged if you were someone with easy access in and out of there. Like for example, a prosecutor such as Mr. Godot!Godot:\n...!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! M-Mr. Godot...! You're under fire again!Phoenix:\n...This murder could not have been carried out without prior knowledge! And you...! You were the only one that could've acquired this information before the murder.Godot:\n...Humans are afraid of the dark. And yet... At the same time, we're fascinated and bewitched by it. Maybe that's why humans drink the darkness that is coffee.Judge:\n......Phoenix:\nUmm... Sorry for always asking, but what does that mean?Godot:\nIt means there's a reason for everything. According to your theory, the killer in this case eavesdropped... ...on a conversation during a jail visit where he learned of a hidden plan for a crime.  After discovering the plans, he hid in the Inner Temple and waited for the crime to occur. Then he ultimately took a person's life. ...And he did all of that just to protect this witness?Phoenix:\nThat's right.Godot:\nIf you're accusing me of this crime, I have to ask you... Why would I do this? This girl is nothing but a stranger to me. I've got no reason to go through that kind of trouble to protect her. I am what you see. I am certainly not the type to rescue the damsel in distress.Judge:\nHmm... The killer's behavior is... certainly... extreme... for lack of a better word. Even considering that the killer wanted to protect this witness's life... ...his behavior is still a little too unnatural!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nHowever... ...you had a good reason didn't you, Mr. Godot? An unshakable reason that forced you to protect this witness at all costs!Maya:\n...... I knew it... You've figured it out, haven't you, Nick...?Phoenix:\n(Maya... I guess you were doing your best to cover for Godot... ...for the same reason, huh?)Godot:\nOK, Trite. I'm all ears. ...Let's hear it.Phoenix:\nIt's very simple... Maya Fey is a lot more than just a stranger to you.Judge:\nWh-What's this...!?Phoenix:\nThere's one person who lies at the very center of this whole story. One person that ties you and Maya Fey together inextricably!Present Mia Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's a very good reason why Maya Fey's life is so precious to you!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\n...Sorry, but at this point in my life, I'm a lone wolf. I've got no connection to that person whatsoever.\nJudge:\nYes, and by the way, I don't have any connection with them either, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(What am I doing...? If I think about Godot's true identity, the answer is obvious!)\nGodot:\nHow's it going, Trite? I knew it... Has this whole trial just been too much for you...?\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, maybe. I'm not sure... But I am sure about one thing!\nLeads back to:\n\"Maya Fey is a lot more than just a stranger to you.\"Phoenix:\nThere's a very good reason why Maya Fey's life is so precious to you! After all... She is Mia Fey's only sister.Maya:\n...!Godot:\nMia... Fey.Phoenix:\nYou once worked alongside her. That was when you... were a defense attorney.Judge:\nW-Wait a second here! Mr. Godot is... is a defense attorney!?Phoenix:\nWith Your Honor's piercing intellect, you must have figured it out by now... The real name of this man who calls himself \"Godot\"... His real name is... Diego Armando. Isn't that right?Godot:\nThe last time someone called me by that name... ...was over 6 years ago.Judge:\nDiego Armando... That name rings a bell...Phoenix:\nIt should, Your Honor. All of this is related to a single case... A case in which a convict named Terry Fawles killed himself... Mia Fey's first time in court. The tragic outcome left a deep wound in her heart. She knew that behind it all was a heartless, scheming demoness in disguise. But in the end, Mia couldn't tear off that disguise. However, there was one man who reached out to help her. ...Diego Armando, a senior defense lawyer at the office where Mia worked.Mia:\nIt's my fault! It's all my fault that Mr. Fawles killed himself!Armando:\n............... Mia... You can't cry yet. The only time a lawyer can cry is when it's all over.Godot:\n... I was moved by her... The way she put all her faith in her clients... That pure, sweet heart of hers... That's why... I could never forgive Dahlia Hawthorne. Mia and I thoroughly investigated that fake kidnapping incident. Then one fateful day, Dahlia wanted to meet with me... It had been 6 months since the trial... We met in the courthouse cafeteria.Judge:\nAh...! I just remembered! 6 years ago! Right here in this courthouse! You were poisoned...!Godot:\nEven I didn't see it coming. Dahlia Hawthorne slipped some poison into my coffee.Judge:\nSome newspapers at the time called it a murder. But very little information about the case was released to the press...Phoenix:\nBut you weren't dead at all!Godot:\nNo official reports ever actually called it a murder. I was just in a deep, deep coma...Phoenix:\nI see...Godot:\n...My body shut down, and my life became nothing but a long, deep sleep. That woman's poison did a real number on my central nervous system... I lost my sight, and all of my hair turned white due to the damage it caused.Maya:\nThat's terrible...Godot:\nApparently it was a miracle that I ever regained consciousness. Five years had passed since I drank that poisoned brew... Then one morning, my eyes flew open... from the smell of a doctor's cup of coffee.Judge:\nF-Five years...!? You were asleep for 5 years!?Godot:\nAnd the worst possible news was waiting for me... ...Mia Fey was dead. From the very moment I opened my eyes... I had already lost everything I thought I had. The woman I loved had been murdered... And the woman I loathed had been sentenced to death.Judge:\nThe woman you loathed...?Godot:\nThe woman who had spiked my scalding hot coffee... Dahlia Hawthorne! Ha...! Good ol' Mia. She didn't let me down. She got her revenge before she checked out. In the end... There wasn't anyone waiting for me when I woke up.Maya:\nTh-That's so sad...Godot:\nFor someone like me... For someone who had slept away their best days... ...there were only two reasons left to live. (Changed from [...there were only 2 reasons left to live.] in the original release) And it was for those two reasons that I decided to become a prosecutor. (Changed from [And it was for those 2 reasons that I decided to become a prosecutor.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nIf I may ask... What were your two reasons to live...? (Changed from [If I may ask... What were your 2 reasons to live...?] in the original release)Godot:\nThe first was you, Trite.Phoenix:\nHuh...!? M... M-Me?Godot:\nIf I hadn't drank that stupid poison... ...Mia Fey never would have died, much less the way she did.Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nYou were the only one who was there to protect her! But you let her die. It was all your fault.Phoenix:\nI... It wasn't like that...Godot:\nI wanted to see for myself what kind of a man you really were.Judge:\nS-So that's why you became a prosecutor?Godot:\nMy other reason for living... She goes by the name of Maya Fey.Maya:\nHuh? You mean me...?Godot:\nYou were the only way I could make up for the sin of not saving Mia. One year ago, when the Kurain Village incident was resolved... ...it was obvious that Morgan Fey was planning something. Whatever her evil plan was, I was determined to stop it. My role as a prosecutor put me in the perfect position to do something about her.Phoenix:\nThat's how you overheard Pearls's visit with Morgan at the detention center.Godot:\nI knew that the time was drawing near. Since I knew the plan, I thought I could foil it. My goal was to outwit the plan. I thought if I could do that... ...I could keep that girl from being caught up in it.Phoenix:\n(That makes sense... If Pearls had known that the actual purpose of the plan was to kill Maya... ...she never would have helped out.)Godot:\nFinally, the day of the plan was drawing near... I contacted both of my accomplices.Judge:\nAccomplices...?Godot:\nIris of Hazakura Temple and... Misty Fey. I especially needed the help of Iris... She was to take the fall in my back-up plan in case we couldn't control Pearl Fey.Maya:\nB-But...! How did you contact my mother!? She had been missing for almost 20 years!Godot:\nOfficially, yes...Maya:\nWhat!? What do you mean, officially!?Godot:\nYou've heard about it, haven't you? About the strong ties between the main family and the government...Phoenix:\n(Now that you mention it... Bikini did say something to that effect... She said that the Master of Kurain had great authority...)Godot:\nEven without her official position, Misty Fey still wielded great influence... The police have been keeping an eye on her movements all this time. That's how I was able to contact her... Again, because of my position as a prosecutor.Maya:\nSo my mother... was cooperating with you?Godot:\nDon't ever forget... ...no matter how far away from you she was, she never stopped thinking about you.Maya:\nSh-She was always...Godot:\nThat's why... I knew she would do anything to protect you. If you want to know how strong her resolve to protect you was, look at her staff.Judge:\nHer staff...? The one with the sword in it?Godot:\nThe day the plan was to be carried out arrived soon enough... We met for the first time at Hazakura Temple. That's when your mother showed me her special staff... I realized it then... Just how far she was willing to go... She was ready to use that sword to protect you from Morgan Fey, if necessary. ...Yes! Even if it meant paying the ultimate price.Maya:\nM-Mother...Godot:\nThat night... The night of the crime. There was just one way to stop Morgan's evil plan.Phoenix:\nYou mean Pearls, don't you?Godot:\nWe had to make sure she didn't channel Dahlia Hawthorne...Elise:\n...Well, Pearl? What are you going to do tonight?Pearl:\nWell, umm...Elise:\nIf you'd like, you can come to my room. Perhaps we can read some books together.Godot:\nWe thought we could prevent her from playing her part in Morgan's plan. But... She never showed up.Maya:\nShe was worried and followed me to the Inner Temple...Godot:\nThat was the thing we were most afraid of. And that's why... Misty Fey had to do the channeling herself. She channeled Dahlia Hawthorne into her own body.Judge:\nWhat...!? What do you mean!?Phoenix:\nIf she channeled the spirit first... ...then Pearls wouldn't be able to do it herself.Maya:\n...!Godot:\nAs Master of Kurain, Misty Fey's power was supreme. So that's how it went down. She channeled Dahlia Hawthorne so that Pearl Fey wouldn't be able to!Maya:\nAh...! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! (Changed from [Ah...! Whaaaaaaaat!?] in the original release)Judge:\nWhat...!? Is this true!?Godot:\nMy role in the plan was to make sure no one was going to hurt Maya Fey. That's why... I hid myself at the Inner Temple. Just in case you needed to be saved from Dahlia Hawthorne.Phoenix:\nGodot...Godot:\nAnyway... That's all I'm going to admit to... Trite.Phoenix:\nHuh...?Godot:\nThere's no doubt about it. You're a great defense attorney. (Changed from [There's no doubt about it. You're a great defense lawyer.] in the original release) But... you're going to have to do the rest yourself.Judge:\nThe background leading up to this incident has been laid bare. There's just one question remaining, Mr. Wright. \"Who killed the victim?\" There are only two possible suspects right now. Maya Fey... And I'm sad to say... you, Mr. Godot!Godot:\nWell, Trite... If you're the real deal... ...then finish this thing once and for all. Show us beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can finish this on your own!Maya:\nN-No, Nick...! P-Please don't!Phoenix:\nM... Maya...Maya:\nI... I heard the whole thing. From my sister... In the medical office...! That's why! That's why... I have to protect Mr. Godot...Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nI can't do it... I can't testify against him... After all... ...he's the man who put his life on the line to protect Mia... and me, too!Phoenix:\nMaya... I know that!Maya:\nN-Nick...Phoenix:\nBut even so... It doesn't absolve him of his crime! ...Please, Maya. Testify.Maya:\n...!Judge:\nMs. Fey. Your testimony please.Phoenix:\nThis is the final testimony. Don't bother trying to hide anything, because I'll know. I want to hear the truth from your own lips...Maya:\n...... I understand. I'm sure you're right... I'm ready now, Nick...Judge:\nAlright, young lady... Tell us about the moments before you lost consciousness. What exactly happened at the time of the murder!?Witness Testimony-- The Time of the Murder --Maya:\n...Just before it happened, I think I saw some red lights. Three of them.\nI thought I'd ask for help, but... just then I was splattered with blood!\nShe wasn't dead though... And she struck back at the enemy behind her.\nSuddenly, the red lights went out and the whole area was dark.\n...Just at that moment, there was a horrible scream!\nRight after that... Dahlia collapsed and I lost consciousness.Judge:\nThese red lights... I thought you said you don't remember seeing them!Maya:\nI-I'm sorry... I thought I saw them, but then they disappeared all of a sudden...Godot:\nHa...! Things break, Trite... Even the best of theories.Phoenix:\n...Godot:\nWho was it that stabbed Misty Fey? It looks like you still can't prove it.Phoenix:\n(Maya is telling the truth this time, I know it... The rest is up to me!)Judge:\n...Well then, Mr. Wright! Proceed with your final cross-examination of the witness!Cross Examination",

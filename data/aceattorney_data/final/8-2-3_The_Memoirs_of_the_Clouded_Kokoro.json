  "previousContext": "Episode II\nThe Memoirs of the Clouded Kokoro\nAnime cutscene\nIt was a ghastly tale of a winter's night - one of an invisible killer and a crime perpetrated on the pavement along Briar Road. As the victim lay at death's door, thy mystery of just who had stabbed the young lady from behind had been resolved. But no sooner had my friend saved that Eastern exchange student from his harrowing plight, than in the dim, flickering shadows of gaslight did a second bizarre crime rend the stillness of that very night. I daresay most can still recall the sensational headlines of the day. 'Haunted Apartment of Death' 'The Condemned Criminal's Curse' 'The Dread Demon of Coal Gas' Yet, though the great detective had at once discerned the truth upon his arrival at the scene, it only proved to be the overture that announced the rising of the curtain on a most tragic play.\nMy name is Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a fledgling lawyer, just starting out on my journey. Six months ago, I arrived as a visiting student of law... ...having made the long voyage across the sea from the Empire of Japan to here...London, England. And on the way, in quite extraordinary circumstances, I made the acquaintance of a world-famous detective. Currently, I reside in the attic of the detective's own lodgings, from where I run my legal consultancy of sorts. I've successfully defended a number of clients in Britain's highest court, the Old Bailey. But since a particularly gruelling and unforgettable legal battle four months ago now... ...I haven't returned to the courtroom. In truth, I lost my right to return. But that epic trial was just part of an epic tale. A tale which was now about to awaken from slumber... ...thanks to a letter that arrived this morning from my homeland...\n*Ruuumble*\nRyunosuke:\n......... (Mmm, what a delicious smell wafting up the stairs... It must be nearly time for breakfast. I'd better go down to Mr Sholmes's suite... ...and say good morning to the great detective and his flatmate.)\n30th August, 7:28 a.m.\nSholmes's Suite\nIris:\nAh, Runo, good! I was just about to call up to you. The bacon's ready.\nRyunosuke:\nGood morning, Iris. It smells delicious as usual. Before we eat, though, I have some news. I had a surprise this morning-\nSholmes:\nShh! Not another word, Mr Naruhodo! This could be just the abstruse thing for my pre-breakfast stagnation-repelling mental stimulation, my dear fellow.\nRyunosuke:\n'Morning' to you too, Mr Sholmes.\nSholmes:\nAh...yes...I see... So that's it... The truth is as clear to me as day. My faculties of observation have revealed it again.\nRyunosuke:\nWh-What are you talking about?\nSholmes:\nYou, Mr Naruhodo. You have, this very morning, met with a surprise! ...Well? Is that not the case?\nRyunosuke:\nUm...\nSholmes:\nReally, my dear fellow, it barely warrants explanation. Firstly, your hair is particularly unkempt. Somewhat reminiscent of a bird's nest. Secondly, you have neglected to fasten the third button of your jacket. Clearly, when considered together, these two facts point to you having been flustered this morning.\nRyunosuke:\n......... Can I talk now?\nSholmes:\nBut of course, of course! Though I don't look for admiration, you understand.\nRyunosuke:\nMy hair always looks like this. It's been this way since I first met you.\nSholmes:\nOh. It has?\nRyunosuke:\nAnd the button...was ripped off last night, if you remember? ...By you.\nIris:\nHurley pulled your button off?\nSholmes:\n......... Ah yes, I recall the incident now. It was after supper, was it not? As the evening advanced, I picked up my violin and began to play the wailing notes of a haunting tune. But then, to my utter dismay, the third string snapped! Why did it have to happen? WHY?! Little wonder then, that in my vexation, I grabbed the first button I saw and ripped it from its proper place!\nRyunosuke:\n...Well, I'd like it back now, please. It's troubling me that I can't fasten my jacket.\nSholmes:\nAnd it's troubling me that you expect me to know where it is! Somewhere thereabouts on the floor, one presumes.\nRyunosuke:\n(Helpful.)\nSholmes:\nWhat matters at the present time, my dear fellow, is simply whether or not my deduction was unerring.\nIris:\nBut Hurley, Runo said it when he came in, didn't he? 'I had a surprise this morning.'\nSholmes:\n......... Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Well, that really is a surprise!\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes, this man is the pride of the British Empire. The famous consulting detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes. There can't be a single person in the world who doesn't know his name.)\nIris:\nAlright then, enough of this silly conversation. Come and eat this bacon before it goes cold. And I have a new herbal tea for you to try, too! My latest special blend!\nRyunosuke:\n(And here we have Iris Wilson, Mr Sholmes's lodger and companion. A truly exceptional young girl, who's the author of a highly successful serialisation here in London. Yes, 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' as published in Randst Magazine.)\nSholmes:\nSo, Mr Naruhodo, won't you put us out of our misery? What surprised you this fine morning?\nRyunosuke:\nAh, well, I received a letter...from Japan.\nIris:\nOh! From Susie, you mean?! Was it? Really?\nRyunosuke:\nThat's right. And she had some rather startling news, in fact.\nSholmes:\nAh... intriguing indeed. You must tell us all about it over breakfast!\nIris:\nOh yes! What fun!\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nRyunosuke:\nSummoning her back to Japan so suddenly like that... I wonder what Miss Susato's father is hiding.\nIris:\nHmmm... Hurley, do you know what it's all about?\nSholmes:\n...Hm? Ah, well, who can say?\nRyunosuke:\nWhat? But, but you said...\nSholmes:\nPlease, I have engagements, my dear fellow! My calendar is quite surprisingly full today. And a stringent analysis of the matter would be excessive, I feel. Even if I were quite at leisure. So! Man the fort in my absence, won't you, Iris?\nIris:\nI will, Hurley, don't worry. See you later!\nRyunosuke:\n(He scuttled off rather quickly there... I think perhaps Professor Mikotoba isn't the only person hiding something here. Soseki-san was involved in two cases, but only one of them was forbidden from being published. By, of all people...Mr Sholmes.)\nIris:\nAh-ha! I've found them at last!\nRyunosuke:\nIris! Are, are they...?\nIris:\nThe notes about the case? That's right. Susie and I compiled them together. 'The Case of the Haunted Lodgings'... Do you want to read them, Runo?\nRyunosuke:\n......... Absolutely. Thank you, Iris. I have no idea what secrets could still be hiding in the shadows of this case... ...but perhaps if I read over the notes again, something might come to light.\nIris:\nThat's the spirit!\nAnd so... ...Iris and I decided to read over the case notes again together. Everything from what happened, to our investigation and that fierce battle in court that followed. Reliving every detail... I just need to find a clue. And I have all the time in the world. Because of course... ...I'm no longer allowed to practise law in the courts of Great Britain.\nIt was six months ago... A mysterious incident that unfolded on the wintry streets of London. A young woman was found lying on the snowy pavement of Briar Road with a knife in her back. Fortunately, her life was spared, but she was unconscious for several days following the incident. The fog was thick, and nobody saw her attacker, but... ...by a cruel twist of fate, a visiting Japanese student was walking behind her at the time, and was duly arrested. That man was Soseki-san. And the man who effected his arrest...was Mr Sholmes. Believing in our compatriot's innocence, Susato-san and I decided to represent Soseki-san in court. And, after a gruelling trial of many twists and turns, we finally managed to prove his innocence.\nSoseki:\nJoyful, Joyous, Jubilant Jubilation!\nRyunosuke:\n...Was the man's reaction after the trial. But his jubilant jubilation was short lived. We received a telegram from Mr Sholmes the following morning. 'The victim of the Briar Road stabbing has regained consciousness. Hurry to Barts at once!' So Susato-san and I summoned a hansom and headed immediately to the hospital.\nBefore clearing all Converse options in Sholmes's Suite:\n30th August\nNaruhodo's Legal Consultancy\n21st February, 5:30 a.m.\nSt Bartholomew's Hospital, Recovery Ward\nSholmes:\nThere you are at last!\nRyunosuke:\nGood morning, Mr Sholmes.\nSholmes:\nI think not.\nSusato:\nOh!\nSholmes:\nYou're late! What on earth took you so long!\nSusato:\nYour telegram only arrived at five o'clock, Mr Sholmes. And it's a twenty-minute ride to the hospital.\nRyunosuke:\nThat's right, and it's half past five now. I think we made very good time.\nSholmes:\nThe time is utterly irrelevant! The fact is, I have been waiting for what has felt like an eternity.\nRyunosuke:\nHaah...\nSholmes:\nIn point of fact, I myself was awoken at four this morning by a telegram boy. And feeling it was somewhat unjust that I alone had been roused at such an hour, I sent one to you.\nRyunosuke:\n(Well thanks for that.)\nSholmes:\nAnyway, you're here now, so... The victim is over there. She's only just regained consciousness. You should introduce yourselves. And I shall observe from here.\nRyunosuke:\n(So that's the lady who was found on the snow-covered pavement with the knife in her back...)\nSusato:\nHer name is... Ah yes, here we are. Miss Green.\nAfter clearing all Converse options with Olive Green and examining picture frame:\n???:\nIs there a Mr Narrowfodder here? Mr Narrowfoddeeer?!\nRyunosuke:\n('Narrowfodder' now...?) Well, um, if you're looking for Naruhodo, the lawyer, that's me, but...\n???:\nAh! Mr Narrowfodder, good. This is for you. It's a message from a Mr Saucy Nutsmeg.\nRyunosuke:\nMr Natsume?! Sent a message...to me?\nSusato:\nBut why would a policeman be delivering a message from Mr Natsume?\nRyunosuke:\nExactly... (What's going on? What's a Scotland Yard constable doing playing delivery boy at this time in the morning?)\nSholmes:\nArgh, what are you waiting for?! Let me see that!\nRyunosuke:\nOh!\nSholmes:\n......... Well...this is most unexpected...\nRyunosuke:\nIs something wrong, Mr Sholmes?\nSholmes:\n'Is something wrong, Mr Sholmes?' he says! Have you not seen this note?!\nRyunosuke:\nNo, how could I have?!\nSholmes:\nIt would seem that London's criminals have no intention of letting the great detective rest. A new case calls. A case of murder, no less. ...We must depart at once!\nSusato:\nMurder?!\nSholmes:\nCall a cab! Time is of the essence!\nRyunosuke:\nBut...the trouble is... ...we've yet to read Mr Natsume's note. I was thinking we ought to pay him a visit in his lodgings once we did.\nSholmes:\nThat will be entirely convenient.\nSusato:\nConvenient? What do you mean?\nSholmes:\nIt's all here in the note, my dear fellows. The murder we must investigate...took place at Mr Moustache's lodgings!\nRyunosuke:\nWait...WHAT?!\nSusato:\nI'll hail a fiacre at once!\n(It was only yesterday that Soseki-san was in court and we were dispelling doubts about his innocence. And now...the very next day... ...there's a murder at the man's own address? He may very well be the unluckiest man alive.) ...Or so it seemed to us at the time, but we were soon to discover it was worse than we thought.\n21st February\nSholmes's Suite\n21st February, 7:18 a.m.\nMr Natsume's Lodgings, Ground Floor\nRyunosuke:\nWhat on earth...?!\nSusato:\nOh my! The gentleman is deceased, without question! He's dead!\nSoseki:\nL-L-L-Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire!\nRyunosuke:\nMr Natsume!\nSoseki:\nOh...why...? Why is this happening? Why to me? I'VE ONLY JUST GOT OUT OF COURT! YESTERDAY! I WAS FINALLY HOME AFTER TWO DAYS OF MISERY! AND THEN I WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY TO THIS! NO EARLY BIRD SHOULD CATCH A WORM LIKE THIS!\nWOEFUL WORM WITHOUT WIGGLE!\nSholmes:\nI see you're in high spirits again this morning, Mr Moustache.\nSoseki:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!! Not the horrible HERR LOCK SHOLMES! SHOO! SHOVE OFF! SHOW YOURSELF THE DOOR! I NEVER INVITED YOU!\nSusato:\nMr Sholmes came here with us. I'm quite sure he'll be able to help you, Mr Natsume!\nSholmes:\nI am entirely at your disposal, Mr Moustache. What can I do for you?\nSoseki:\nGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!\nGregson:\nTsk, here they are...already. The busybodies.\nSholmes:\nAh, Inspector Gregson. What a pleasant surprise.\nGregson:\nPleasant, is it? Gives me heartburn every time I see your face at a crime scene, Sholmes.\nSholmes:\nHah! I deduce, Inspector...that your heartburn is a result of your excessive consumption of fried food.\nRyunosuke:\nUm...good morning, Inspector.\nGregson:\n.........This is a crime scene! Don't you go touchin' anythin'!\nRyunosuke:\n(Or 'Good morning to you too, sunshine...')\nRyunosuke:\nUm, Mr Sholmes, what are you doing?\nSholmes:\nHah! You need only observe to know it, my dear fellow. Investigating, naturally!\nRyunosuke:\n...There's nothing natural about that pose.\nSusato:\nMr Sholmes! Have you made some miraculous discovery?\nSholmes:\nPatience, my dear madam, patience. We've not been here in this room five minutes. So far, all I've managed to deduce is what actually happened.\nSusato:\nMy goodness! But...isn't that everything we need to know, Mr Sholmes?\nSholmes:\nHm... Now that you propose the idea, I believe one could, indeed, see it that way. At the present time, I have managed to draw two incontrovertible conclusions. The first, that there was a physical struggle here last night in which the victim fought for his life.\nSoseki:\nAAAAAAAAAH!\nSusato:\nAh!\nRyunosuke:\nMr Natsume, what's wrong? Is something that Mr Sholmes said significant somehow?\nSoseki:\nN-No... Don't mind me! Forget I was here!\nSholmes:\nAnd my second conclusion... ...is that there was a poison lingering in the air here last night that passed the victim's lips.\nSoseki:\nN-N-N-NONSENSE!\nSusato:\nAh!\nRyunosuke:\nAlright, Mr Natsume. Why are you reacting so extremely to Mr Sholmes's deductions?\nSoseki:\nN-N-N-No... Please! Pretend I'm not here!\nInvisible, Ineffable, Inscrutable...Insignificant!\nRyunosuke:\n...Impossible to ignore.\nSusato:\nYou must tell us everything, Mr Sholmes! Spare no detail!\nSholmes:\n......... But of course. Let the theatrical tragedy before us be unravelled by my great deductions, presented for your pleasure in two acts!\nRyunosuke:\n(We've heard some truly astounding great deductions from Mr Sholmes in the past... No doubt this will be no exception. What miracles will unfold before our eyes this time?)\nSholmes:\nSo, my dear fellows, for your delight and wonder, let the curtain rise... ...for Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular', Act One!\nThe Great Deduction\nThe game is afoot!\nTopic 1\nCause of Death\nSholmes:\nCareful observation of the victim reveals to us the events that transpired in this disconsolate room last night. Foam at the mouth of the deceased clearly indicates the use of poison. Next to the victim, we notice a large dining plate, which contains, you will observe... ...one half of a sizeable bar of soap. Meaningful? Indubitably. Why is this soap set so purposefully upon the dish? Like the victim's last supper, in fact. Yes... Could it be that the man was about to eat it? Of course, the fork reveals the answer. It appears that the young man's appetite was his undoing. Taking up arms in the form of his cutlery, the victim engaged in a deadly battle for his life. Yet the struggle against his hunger was in vain, for in the end, he couldn't resist devouring the slippery feast! But London's foul soap is besmirched by foul poison. Yes, the victim's life was claimed by poison that tainted the contents of the plate! The soap...and the lather about the young man's mouth are too perfectly matched to ignore. The cause of death was clearly intoxication due to excessive ingestion of foul soap! ...Though personally, I have a greater interest in the taste of foul candlewax, of course.\nTopic 1\nCause of Death\nConclusion\nPoisoning from soap ingestion\nTopic 2\nSuicide or Murder?\nSholmes:\nThe cause of death identified, we proceed to Act Two, where we ponder the next question: Was this suicide or murder? The audience will recall that death occurred during the victim's 'last supper'. Did the man dine and die alone? This single teacup suggests the answer. To draw a conclusion on such meagre evidence would be foolish however, certainly. The careful criminal could have absconded with his own cup to cover his tracks. Well, allow me to lift the veil of doubt, my dear fellow. Indeed. What reveals the answer, of course, is the broken lock! Though forced open now, at the time of the incident, this door was locked. And the sole key was in the victim's pocket. In other words, when the victim consumed the poison, he must have been alone. Alone with his inferior soap, from whence wafted an inferior scent. And with that acrid aroma lingering in the air, the victim met his end...in tragic solitude. We can take comfort only in the fact that his soul was well cleansed on its way to the hereafter.\nTopic 2\nSuicide or Murder?\nConclusion\nNo possible perpetrator present\nSholmes:\nThus concludes the final act of Herlock Sholmes's great deduction!\nSusato:\n.........\nGregson:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n...There's just one thing, Mr Sholmes...\nSholmes:\nYou are disposed to identifying 'just one thing', aren't you, Mr Naruhodo? Pray, what concerns you?\nRyunosuke:\nWell...no matter how hungry he was, do you really think the man would have eaten soap?\nSholmes:\nIt is quite apparent that this man had barely a penny to his name. It is a curious thing, but to one so destitute, soap can suddenly appear quite irresistibly appetising.\nSusato:\nHow extraordinary!\nSholmes:\nIn truth, I have tried a little soap myself in the past.\nRyunosuke:\nYou've eaten it, you mean?!\nSholmes:\nMy dear fellow, it was some time ago now. My postulation was that it would cleanse my gut.\nSusato:\nAnd did it?\nSholmes:\nAs I writhed in agony on the floor and spilt the contents of my stomach...yes, I believe it did. The experience taught me a valuable lesson: soap is quite poisonous. It has an unpleasant taste and leads to great discomfort. In summary, I cannot recommend it.\nRyunosuke:\n(Believe me, I wouldn't eat it even if you did.)\nSusato:\nThere's something that troubles me as well, actually.\nRyunosuke:\nOh? What's that?\nSusato:\nIt's Mr Natsume.\nSoseki:\nAh!\nSusato:\nI couldn't help noticing him shuddering and quivering out of the corner of my eye. Almost as if Mr Sholmes's deductions touched a nerve somehow.\nSoseki:\nN-N-N-N-N-Nonsense...\nRyunosuke:\n(Well, that clenched teeth episode didn't last...)\nSusato:\nI think...judging by Mr Natsume's reaction... ...the great detective's deductions may need some gentle corrections in order to reach the actual truth.\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes, Mr Sholmes's observations and deductions are sometimes a little too sharp... He has a tendency to hit the nail on the side of the head and drive it in at an obtuse angle. When he does that, it falls to us to straighten things out.) Alright then, let's see what we can do.\nSusato:\nYes, we must pick out the key words in Mr Sholmes's quite brilliant deductions... ...and discreetly exchange them for something that makes a little more sense. If we can do that... ...I'm sure we'll arrive at what Mr Sholmes meant to say in the first place!\nSholmes:\nIn that case...are you ready for the second performance of the day? Once again, my dear fellows, for your continued delight and wonder, let the curtain rise... ...for Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular', Act One!\nCourse Correction\nHold it, Mr Sholmes!\nTopic 1\nCause of Death\nConclusion\nPoisoning from soap ingestion\nSholmes:\nCareful observation of the victim reveals to us the events that transpired in this disconsolate room last night. Foam at the mouth of the deceased clearly indicates the use of poison. Next to the victim, we notice a large dining plate, which contains, you will observe... ...one half of a sizeable bar of soap. Meaningful? Indubitably. Why is this soap set so purposefully upon the dish? Like the victim's last supper, in fact. Yes... Could it be that the man was about to eat it? Of course, the fork reveals the answer.\nRyunosuke:\nWell, you can't deny that a fork implies the man was eating something, or about to eat something.\nSusato:\nYes, that's true. If I were to decide to eat some soap, I should prefer to use a fork than to attempt it with chopsticks.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd of course, only half of the bar of soap is left on the plate.\nSusato:\nBut might there not be some other explanation? Something material that proves whether or not the man really ate some soap...\nCould it be that the man was about to eat it? Of course, the fork reveals the answer.\nRyunosuke:\nSome soup on a plate, and a fork in hand... Even so, surely you wouldn't try to eat soap, no matter how hungry you were.\nSusato:\nThat's what we must determine: was the victim eating soap when he died or not? Until we can establish that with some certainty, we shan't make any progress.\nRyunosuke:\n(Talk about a slippery problem...)\nRyunosuke:\nCould it be that the man was about to eat it? Of course, the other piece of soap reveals the answer.\nSholmes:\nIt being the other half of the soap on the table. In short, the victim was not eating soap at all. But it's obvious, really. For no depths of hunger could drive any man to attempt to eat soap. Even I, with my unquenchable thirst for practical knowledge, took only a single bite!\nRyunosuke:\nBut that begs the question of how the man was poisoned. Because there's no sign of any food on the table.\nSholmes:\nAn excellent observation, Mr Naruhodo. And one that furnishes us with the answer we seek. For London's foul soap is besmirched by foul poison. Yes, the victim's life was claimed by poison that tainted the contents of the plate!\nRyunosuke:\nMr Sholmes is still pushing the soap argument, then.\nSusato:\nPerhaps he's suggesting the man licked the soap rather than ate it.\nRyunosuke:\nIf soap in London is that poisonous, I don't think I want to be washing my hands with it. (But there are no signs of any food in this room at all.)\nSusato:\nOf course, food isn't the only thing that passes people's lips, is it?\nYes, the victim's life was claimed by poison that tainted the contents of the plate!\nRyunosuke:\nIf the cause of death was poison, how did it get into the victim's body?\nSusato:\nI think it might be difficult to establish the answer conclusively at this point. But at the very least, the idea of poisoned soap should be discounted, I think. I'm sure there's a far more likely explanation before our eyes here.\nRyunosuke:\n(Something obvious that could explain how poison passed the victim's lips...)\nRyunosuke:\nYes, the victim's life was claimed by poison that tainted the teacup!\nSholmes:\nIndeed! Cups have been the vessel of choice for practising poisoners over the centuries. And it would appear that this victim drank every last drop.\nRyunosuke:\nThere's no sign of food anywhere in the room.\nSholmes:\nWhich leads us to the immutable conclusion: The cause of death was clearly intoxication due to the ingestion of poison contained in this teacup!\nTopic 1\nCause of Death\nConclusion\nPoisoning from soap ingestion\nPoison in the tea\nSolved\nTopic 2\nSuicide or Murder?\nConclusion\nNo possible perpetrator present\nSholmes:\nThe cause of death identified, we proceed to Act Two, where we ponder the next question: Was this suicide or murder? The audience will recall that death occurred during the victim's 'last supper'. Did the man dine and die alone? This single teacup suggests the answer.\nRyunosuke:\nAh, the 'Western vessel for infused hot drinks' again. It's already featured heavily in our deductions so far.\nSusato:\nYes, we can imagine that shortly before his death, Mr Shamspeare was having a drink of tea. There would be nothing remarkable about that. But what troubles me...\nRyunosuke:\n...Is Mr Natsume's reaction when he heard Mr Sholmes suggest it. (There's more to this deduction than it seems...)\nSusato:\nWe must closely examine the scene of the crime again for some more clues!\nDid the man dine and die alone? This single teacup suggests the answer.\nSusato:\nIt's crucial that we determine whether or not there was somebody else present at the time of death. It will tell us if this was a murder or suicide.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, and while the argument that the presence of a single teacup shows he was alone is a good one... (...we need to make sure we look at this from all angles...)\nRyunosuke:\nDid the man dine and die alone? This other teacup suggests the answer. Yes! There were two teacups in this room all along!\nSoseki:\nAh!\nRyunosuke:\nIn other words, this is a strong indication that at the victim's 'last supper'... ...there was a guest present!\nSholmes:\n...At the very least, we can say now with certainty... ...that somebody else was here in this room last night, taking tea with the victim!\nSoseki:\nWh-Wh-What are you TALKING ABOUT?!\nUtterly, Unbelievably, Unjustly Unreasonable!\nSholmes:\nTo draw a conclusion on such meagre evidence would be foolish however, certainly.\nRyunosuke:\nIn which case, what more can we deduce about this possible 'guest' at the table?\nSholmes:\nWell, allow me to lift the veil of doubt, my dear fellow.\nRyunosuke:\nDo you mean to say, you know who exactly was in this room at the time of the victim's death?!\nSholmes:\nIndeed. What reveals the answer, of course, is the broken lock!\nRyunosuke:\n...I'm not sure I like where this deduction is going now.\nSusato:\nI'm afraid it's too late to go back to the halcyon days of eating too much soap.\nRyunosuke:\nBut the identity of the 'guest' who was in here last night when the victim passed away is... Is something I have a very bad feeling about.\nSusato:\nWell, you can try to ignore your feelings, but we cannot ignore the truth, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\n(No, I suppose not. Time to look around again...)\nIndeed. What reveals the answer, of course, is the broken lock!\nRyunosuke:\nWas there somebody else in here last night, or not... Clearly that's a fundamental question that will reveal the truth about this man's passing.\nSusato:\nExactly. So we must make sure we have solid grounds for our conclusion.\nRyunosuke:\n(I must have another look around and make sure there's not more here than meets the eye...)\nRyunosuke:\nIndeed. What reveals the answer, of course, is the pile of familiar books!\nSholmes:\nQuite so! It's no mere coincidence that these three titles are here in this room. It's the link to the truth!\nSoseki:\nAgh!\nRyunosuke:\nMr Natsume, you purchased these books four days ago at a secondhand bookshop.\nSoseki:\nTh-That's just...a c-c-c-coincidence!\nSholmes:\nIn that case, you will be able to bring the same three titles from your own room, will you not? This very moment!\nSoseki:\n.........\nNo! Never! Non-Negotiable!\nRyunosuke:\nIf you can't bring your own copies here, it proves that these three books are in fact yours.\nSoseki:\nHnnnnnngh...\nRyunosuke:\nHaving purchased the books four days ago and returned to your lodgings, you were arrested the very next day. So you could conceivably have brought the books here on that evening, but you never mentioned that.\nSholmes:\nIn other words, you could only have brought these three books here to the victim's room... ...last night, having returned to your lodgings after the trial concluded at the Old Bailey.\nSoseki:\nAh...um...aaah...aaaaaah...\nSholmes:\nIn short...there is only one possible conclusion: The victim died here in his room last night as a result of poisoning.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd that same night, the victim had a visitor.\nSholmes:\nAnd that visitor...\nRyunosuke:\n...Was you, Mr Soseki Natsume!\nSholmes:\nThus concludes the final act of Herlock Sholmes's great deduction!\nTopic 2\nSuicide or Murder?\nConclusion\nNo possible perpetrator present\nSoseki Natsume at the scene\nSolved\nDeduction CompleteElementary!\nSoseki:\nHuuurgh...uuurgh...

HOLD YOUR HORSES!\nGregson:\nYes?\nSoseki:\nDoor! Key! Locked! Entry! Exit! Entirely! Impossible!\nRyunosuke:\n(He's so flustered he's being even stranger than normal...)\nGregson:\nWhat, you think that's an alibi? You could have just made a copy.\nSoseki:\nWha...?\nGregson:\nYou live in the same buildin', after all. You'd have had plenty of opportunity, I'm sure.\nSoseki:\nB-B-B-B-But... MISERY MEEEEEEEEE!\nGregson:\nSorry, sir, you'll get your chance to give your side of the story later.\nSholmes:\nThe facts speak for themselves, Mr Moustache.\nSoseki:\nAaargh...you...you... You horrible Herr Lock Sholmes!\nRyunosuke:\n(He really has found himself an arch-rival now, hasn't he?)\nGregson:\nCome on now, no dilly-dallyin'. Outside! There's a carriage waitin'.\nSoseki:\nLocum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! I, I never imagined I'd be in this position again, but... YOU HAVE TO HELP ME! Please! Please! I'm innocent!\nRyunosuke:\n...Alright, I understand. We'll come to your cell later and talk about it.\nSoseki:\nAnd one more thing!\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Yes?\nSoseki:\nMy, my poor little kitty-cat... Please give him his breakfast for me!\nAnd so... ...his evil curse still apparently unbroken... ...Soseki-san found himself once again the prime suspect in a case of murder. Thanks to the incriminating deduction of the great detective.\nSholmes:\nMy dear fellow, that honour belongs to you!\nRyunosuke:\nWell, at least that means Inspector Gregson is no longer here. We can examine the crime scene in more detail now.\nSusato:\nYes, that's right. Ah, and of course...\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nSusato:\nHave you forgotten what the inspector mentioned before? It was the landlord, Mr Garrideb, who discovered Mr Shamspeare.\nRyunosuke:\nAh, Mr John Garrideb, yes...\nSusato:\nI expect we could find him in his sitting room on the top floor as usual.\nRyunosuke:\nRight. We must remember to go and talk to him later, then.\nAfter examining meter on wall, teacup, bricked-up window twice, and paper scrap on floor:\n???:\n...Looks like you're havin' a good snoop around, eh?\nRyunosuke:\nInspector Gregson! B-Back so soon?\nGregson:\nAfter I threw that little Japanese fella in the clink, I went and reported this to the investigation division. In five minutes' time, this place will be cordoned off by the Yard.\nRyunosuke:\nOh, I see. Well, we'd better be leaving then.\nSusato:\nPoor Mr Natsume must be feeling very low, being back in a cell again so soon...\nRyunosuke:\nI'm sure. We should probably go...and.........\nSusato:\nWhat's wrong, Mr Naruhodo? KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!\nShamspeare:\n'Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player... That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more...' ......... ...Now, how soundeth the next part?\nGregson:\n'It is a tale. Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.'\nShamspeare:\nIndeed! Oh, happy day!\nRyunosuke:\nWa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa... ...WALKING DEEEEEEEEEAD!!!\nGregson:\nThe, the fella isn't dead at all?!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat was that nonsense he was saying, though?\nSusato:\nI think... Yes, it was from William Shakespeare's 'Macbeth'. A soliloquy from Act Five, Scene Five.\nRyunosuke:\nShakespeare...\nSo it was... ...that the victim, Mr William Shamspeare...'came back to life'. If the man had indeed been poisoned, it transpired that it hadn't killed him. He was taken by emergency carriage to a nearby hospital for treatment. And Inspector Gregson evicted us from the scene of the crime...whatever that now was.\n21st February\nBriar Road\nSusato:\nWhatever do you think will happen now?\nRyunosuke:\n...Good question. What a strange situation for Mr Natsume. Arrested for murder, but then the victim comes back to life!\nSusato:\nI think perhaps the victim was never dead in the first place. It seems very likely that Mr Shamspeare did consume poison, as we deduced... ...but was it an accident, attempted suicide...or attempted murder? Until the truth can be established, I imagine the police will keep Mr Natsume in custody.\nRyunosuke:\nI suppose so... Let's hope it doesn't come to anything more than a night in the cells... (Oh...what's this? What's that man doing over there? He looks like he's trying to see into Soseki-san's lodgings...)\nSusato:\nIs something wrong, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nUm, excuse me! Could we have a word?\n???:\nAh!\nRyunosuke:\n(He just ran off...)\nSusato:\nI feel sure that I've seen that man somewhere before. Where was it...?\nRyunosuke:\nHm... (I do too, but I don't remember...)\n21st February\nNaruhodo's Legal Consultancy\n21st February\nThe Garridebs' Room\nRyunosuke:\n(Here we are again. The eccentric landlord's eccentric top floor abode...)\nSusato:\nWe're here because Mr Garrideb's the one who discovered the incident this morning, don't forget.\nGarrideb:\nAh...you chaps, eh?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, good morning, sir.\nGarrideb:\nThank you for your...cooperation in court yesterday.\nRyunosuke:\n(It was quite a trial... As much for Mr Garrideb as anyone, really.)\nGarrideb:\nCame straight back here after all that business at the Bailey yesterday. Didn't expect to wake up to more bally nonsense this morning!\nSusato:\nI wonder...if you wouldn't mind telling us exactly what happened, Mr Garrideb?\nGarrideb:\nYes...I suppose you'd like to know all about that dead loss of an actor chap in the ground floor room.\nRyunosuke:\n(Those were exactly Inspector Gregson's words, weren't they?)\nAfter clearing all Converse options with John Garrideb and examining meter on wall, teacup, bricked-up window twice, and paper scrap on floor in Mr Natsume's Lodgings, Ground Floor:\nRyunosuke:\nWell, we've done as much investigating here as we can, I think. Perhaps we ought to go to the prison and speak with Mr Natsume again.\nSusato:\nA good idea!\n21st February\nLocal Prison, Cell 9\nSusato:\nLook, Mr Naruhodo. Mr Natsume...have the police finished questioning you now?\nSoseki:\nLocum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire!\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Y-Yes?\nSoseki:\nWhat is he? Tell me! Is he a ghost? Is he here to haunt me?!\nRyunosuke:\nLet me guess... You're talking about Mr Sholmes?\nSusato:\nHe actually calls himself a great detective, Mr Natsume. Not a ghost.\nSoseki:\nBut, but his diabolic deductions... They're not of this world... They've...they've...they've left me... AAAH! Cursed! I'm cursed, I tell you!\nRyunosuke:\n(Well, that sort of hurts...)\nSusato:\nCredit where credit is due, Mr Naruhodo. You were heavily involved in the deduction, too.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, um...moving on... We have some wonderful news!\nSoseki:\nOh?\nSusato:\nThe victim that we all thought was dead...has come back to life again!\nSoseki:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nNow, in the absolutely worst case, you could only be tried for attempted murder! That's...great, isn't it? Mr Natsume?\nSoseki:\nIT'S TERRIBLE!\nSusato:\nOh!\nSoseki:\nI'm stuck! In this cell! Suffering! For some silly! Wrong end of the stick! 'You did it, didn't you?' 'Confess!' 'You're a killer!' 'Why the moustache?' CONSTANT QUESTIONS!\nRyunosuke:\nI'm sorry to hear that...\nSoseki:\nARGH, THAT SELFISH SHYSTER! Make up your mind! Are you dead or alive? If you were going to come back to life, why bother dying?\nWickedly Wishy-Washy William!\nRyunosuke:\nWell...it seems likely that Mr Shamspeare was never actually dead in the first place.\nSoseki:\nAh, yes, that might make sense... And I'm pleased that he's alive, of course. Our lively debate last night was much fun. I'd be sad to think it was our last.\nSusato:\nOh!\nSoseki:\nOops.\nRyunosuke:\nUm, Mr Natsume...does this mean... ...that you did see the victim last night? You met with Mr Shamspeare, didn't you?\nSoseki:\n......... I'm not saying another word! I demand to have a lawyer present!\nRyunosuke:\nWho do you think I am? Please, Mr Natsume, we need to hear your side of the story!\nSoseki:\nUgh... Why am I cursed like this...?\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nSoseki:\nOf course... ...Mr Lord-of-the-Manor is worried about the curse on my room as well.\nRyunosuke:\nYou mean Mr Garrideb?\nSoseki:\nYes. He knows that if people keep dying there, he'll never be able to rent it out again.\nRyunosuke:\nWell, that's true. I, for one, wouldn't go near the place.\nSusato:\nAh... Perhaps... ...that may explain why the landlord pays so much attention to the gas lamps and his tenants' movements.\nRyunosuke:\nYou mean...because he's worried about their well-being? (He does seem to have an unusually keen interest in the amount of gas in the pipes... There must be a reason why he keeps such close tabs on the occupants of his let rooms.)\nSoseki:\nWhat do you mean, 'he pays so much attention to the gas lamps'?\nSusato:\nOh dear! No! It's nothing to do with you, Mr Natsume! Please, forget I said anything!\nSoseki:\nOh, now you're talking about me behind my back as well...\nRyunosuke:\nWhat's important is that Mr Shamspeare isn't in fact dead at all. Once he's come round and he's able to tell us what happened, we'll be able to get you released.\nSoseki:\nYes, please! Oh, I do hope you're right!\n???:\nAhem! Excuse me...\nRyunosuke:\nInspector Gregson!\nGregson:\nI couldn't help overhearin' what you just said. And on that note... ...I have some good news and some bad news.\nSoseki:\nOh.\nGregson:\nWhich d'you want first?\nSoseki:\nAlways! Every time! The bad news comes first! 'When hope is all you have, hold onto it!' That's my guiding principle!\nGregson:\nRight, well, in that case...the good news it is!\nSoseki:\nHuh?\nGregson:\nSorry, but it's just a lot easier to explain everythin' that way.\nSoseki:\n...Then why did you ask me my preference?\nGregson:\nAs you might have heard, the victim, Mr Shamspeare, was just unconscious. He's come round now.\nRyunosuke:\nYes...we saw it happen in all its terrifying glory.\nGregson:\nHe's still bein' treated by the doctors, but we've managed to get a written statement from him already.\nSusato:\nOh, isn't that wonderful, Mr Natsume?\nSoseki:\nOh, thank goodness... It's all over, then. I can leave this sombre cell...\nGregson:\nSorry, no. That's not on the cards.\nSoseki:\nWhat?\nSusato:\nWhy ever not, Inspector?\nGregson:\nMr Shamspeare has implicated someone as bein' responsible for what happened last night.\nRyunosuke:\nImplicated someone?\nSusato:\nOh dear!\nSoseki:\nYou, you don't mean...?\nGregson:\nI'm sorry to say I do, yes. He's pointed the finger at you, Mr Natsume.\nSoseki:\nARGH!\nGregson:\n'By sweet poison did he seeketh to end my life. That wicked'st caitiff...Soseki Natsume!'\nRyunosuke:\nNo!\nGregson:\nSo I'm afraid you'll be appearin' in court as planned. You'll be wantin' to make the necessary preparations.\nSoseki:\nNnnnnn... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!\nRyunosuke:\nAnd so...once again, Soseki-san found himself having to take the dock in the Old Bailey. Whether his room was haunted or whether he was just terribly unlucky, I knew I had no choice... The following day I would represent him in court, and do my utmost to break the curse that blighted him!\nTo be continued...22nd February, 9:23 a.m.\nThe Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber\nRyunosuke:\n(The Old Bailey... This place always makes me feel strange. I seem to get chills down my spine and break out in a nervous sweat all at the same time...) Well...I didn't think I'd be back here so soon.\n???:\nThat's my line!\nSoseki:\nGOOD MORNING!\nRyunosuke:\nAh! Good morning, Mr Natsume.\nSoseki:\nIt was only two days ago that I was declared not guilty here.\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes, we somehow managed to prove he didn't stab Miss Green in the back...)\nSoseki:\nBUT NOW THIS! ANOTHER MORNING, ANOTHER MURDER! AND HERE I AM AGAIN IN THIS HELLHOLE!\nCan't Keep Coming to Court!\nRyunosuke:\n(I'm beginning to think he's right. It really does seem as though he's cursed.)\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo! I'm afraid I have bad news! .........Oh! Mr Natsume... Good morning.\nSoseki:\n...Yes, morning.\nSusato:\nSo...here we are again!\nSoseki:\n...Yes, again.\nSusato:\n.........\nSoseki:\n......... JUDICIAL ASSISTANT MISS MIKOTOBA ESQUIRESS! WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS?\nSusato:\nOh dear... You heard, did you?\nSoseki:\nIf you come in shouting at the top of your voice...PEOPLE CAN'T HELP HEARING WHAT YOU SAY!\nSusato:\nOh... I am sorry.\nRyunosuke:\nYou've done nothing wrong, Miss Susato. Now, what is it?\nSusato:\n......... Well...it seems that the prosecution in today's trial... ...will be led by Lord Barok van Zieks.\nRyunosuke:\nVan, van Zieks...?\nSoseki:\nGAAAAARGH! Oh no... Oh no no...\nRyunosuke:\n(The so-called 'Reaper of the Bailey'... The most legendary prosecutor in the land... In the trial two days ago, he pursued Soseki-san and I relentlessly. Of course, by the skin of our teeth, we managed to pull through, but still...)\nSusato:\nPerhaps Mr Natsume's acquittal in the last trial wasn't the end of the matter. After all...\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I know what you're thinking. The legend of the Reaper that says... ...nothing can save a person in the dock when Lord van Zieks is the prosecutor.\nSoseki:\nOh no...\nSusato:\nThat even if that person is found not guilty...the accused will meet a mysterious end one way or another...\nRyunosuke:\n(And we've experienced it firsthand. A man we successfully defended met the most terrifying end after his acquittal...right here in the Old Bailey...)\nSoseki:\nAGH! DO I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THOSE ICE-COLD EYES BORING INTO MY SOUL AGAIN?! CURSED BY EVIL SPIRITS AND NOW BY THE REAPER!\nPair of Petrifying Perils, Potentially!\nSusato:\nWell, if it's 'potentially'...at least you appear to have hope, Mr Natsume.\nSoseki:\nLocum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire!\nRyunosuke:\nAh! ...Yes?!\nSoseki:\nI'm...I'M INNOCENT! YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME! You, more than anyone now...\nRyunosuke:\n......... Don't worry. I'll be your steadfast ally every step of the way in this battle. ...I promise! (...And this promises to be a hard battle, I fear...)\nSusato:\nWell... ...the trial is scheduled to begin shortly. We should move into the courtroom.\nRyunosuke:\nLet's go!\nSusato:\nOh yes, I forgot to say... I'm afraid he won't be able to make it. Mr Sholmes, I mean.\nRyunosuke:\n......... That's probably for the best.\nSusato:\nOh!\nRyunosuke:\nIf he were here, I might be tempted to rely on his help. And that could be seen as a weakness. If Lord van Zieks were to notice, he'd prey on it mercilessly. At least, that's my gut feeling.\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo...\nSoseki:\nYou're right... Yes, you're so right. Oh, well said, Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! Well said!\nRyunosuke:\nI swear on this sword at my side, and on the spirit of Kazuma that it harbours... ...I'll show him what a Japanese lawyer can do! I'll set you free...with honour!\nSusato:\nOh yes!\n22nd February, 9:40 a.m.\nThe Old Bailey Courtroom\nJudge:\nIn the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.\nVan Zieks:\nThe prosecution is ready.\nRyunosuke:\nThe defence is ready, My Lord.\nVan Zieks:\nReadiness for the trial, my learned Nipponese friend, is not what the defence needs. What you need...is readiness for your inevitable defeat.\nRyunosuke:\n......... (It's not just in my imagination; it's really there... Lord van Zieks has such an animosity towards us Japanese for some reason...)\nSusato:\nIt was some time ago now that he first became known as the Reaper of the Bailey, I believe. These past few years, he hasn't appeared in court at all.\nRyunosuke:\nYet now he's back in the courtroom. Though for some reason... ...only when I'm defending. (This 'Reaper', with his curious disdain for us Japanese, is a prosecutor shrouded in mystery. Still...this isn't the time to be pondering that. I have to concentrate on Soseki-san's trial.)\nJudge:\nFurthermore, I now call upon the six ladies and gentlemen of the jury. You have been chosen at random to represent the will of the people in this trial. Are you ready to fulfil your duty?\nJuror No. 1:\nAbsolutely! I had a feeling this larrikin wasn't innocent before!\nJuror No. 2:\nI must say that I feel especially ruthless on days when my hat refuses to sit right!\nJuror No. 3:\nOh...well I rather like how you're wearing your hat. I think the ruthless look is very fetching, actually...\nJuror No. 4:\nI need to be somewhere at ten o'clock. I have a very important meeting. Let's make this quick.\nJuror No. 5:\nI couldn't agree more. I need to take home five bob tonight, or the missus will go through the roof!\nJuror No. 6:\nOh, may the Lord show us all the light here, and lead His flock to a righteous verdict...\nSusato:\nThe British jury system is so very different to our own, isn't it? It's quite extraordinary to think that the power of judgement is in the hands of six members of the public. And that the judge can only pass sentence when all jurors are in agreement about the defendant's guilt.\nRyunosuke:\n(Six citizens of London, chosen at random... Or at least, that's the idea.)\nVan Zieks:\nThe prosecution would draw attention to the fact that the accused was on trial here but two days ago. Accordingly, where possible, the same jurors have been asked to return for duty today.\nJudge:\nVery well, let us commence the trial. Lord van Zieks...your opening statement, please.\nVan Zieks:\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, it is not the intent of the prosecution to cast doubt over your past decision... However, the innocent verdict afforded to this eccentric Nipponese before...has had dire consequences. Did the accused repent for his wrongdoing in that affair? Far from it. Instead, he used his freedom to perpetrate a most blood-curdling crime! Namely, that of the attempted murder of his neighbouring lodger, an innocent Englishman.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nTo explain the circumstances of the crime, the prosecution calls its first witnesses to the stand... ...the detective responsible for investigating the scene, and the accused himself!\nVan Zieks:\nWitnesses, your names and occupations, please.\nGregson:\nYes, sir! Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard's homicide division.\nSoseki:\n......... Ah! Soseki Natsume from the Empire of Japan! My government ordered me to come here as a student to study your language and culture.\nJudge:\nMr Natsume...\nSoseki:\nYes! My Lord, sir!\nJudge:\nI'm quite sure I'm not mistaken... ...that you swore on oath...never to set foot in my courtroom again. I remember it as if it were yesterday.\nVan Zieks:\nThe day before, in fact, My Lord. But close enough.\nSoseki:\nUgh...believe me, this is the last place I want to be...\nVan Zieks:\nInspector, let's hear from you first. Explain the case for the court.\nGregson:\nRight you are, sir! The incident occurred at the Garrideb household where the defendant has lodgings... ...in the ground floor room of the victim, Mr William Shamspeare. The defendant has already admitted to visitin' the victim on the night in question. Mr Shamspeare collapsed in his room as a result of poisonin' by strychnine. He was found the followin' mornin' when the landlord, suspectin' somethin' was wrong, broke down the door.\nJudge:\nThis means, I presume, that the door to the victim's room was locked at the time of the incident?\nVan Zieks:\nCorrect, My Lord. It was locked from the inside, making entry to or exit from the room impossible.\nGregson:\nAlthough the victim, Mr Shamspeare, lives to tell tale... ...he very nearly didn't. The man was halfway to Heaven when we first found him.\nJudge:\nHmmm...\nGregson:\nI was the first officer on the scene, My Lord... ...and I have a photographic print here that I took at the time to show how it looked.\nJudge:\nYes, a chilling scene indeed. The man looks very much deceased.\nGregson:\nThat's right. Everyone present believed that's exactly what he was.\nJudge:\nVery well, I shall accept this photographic print as evidence for the court.\nThe crime scene photograph has been entered into the Court Record.\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr Natsume...\nSoseki:\nAh! Y-Yes...yes...YES?!\nJudge:\nAs the defendant, do you have anything to say at this juncture?\nSoseki:\n......... They're, they're haunted... Haunted by evil sp-spirits...\nJudge:\nGood gracious! What's haunted?\nSoseki:\nMY LODGINGS! THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE SERIES OF STRANGE HAPPENINGS IN MY LODGINGS! The tenant before me died in mysterious circumstances! A woman was stabbed by no one on the street outside! My neighbour was poisoned! And ME! WHAT ABOUT ME?! I've nearly been killed countless times!\nJudge:\nKilled, Mr Natsume? How?\nSoseki:\nEven on that fateful night, it happened. When I returned from Mr Shamspeare's room... ...I lit my gas stove and climbed into bed, but before long... ...the stove went out, AND SOMEBODY TRIED TO KILL ME!\nJudge:\nYou must always extinguish all fires before retiring for the night, Mr Natsume.\nSoseki:\nBUT IT'S SO COLD! My, my runny nose would freeze! The point is, I, I didn't poison my neighbour. Oh...why am I being accused of this? Why is my existence so cursed...?\nJudge:\nThank you, witnesses. I believe I have a reasonably clear picture of events.\nVan Zieks:\nIf I could raise one more point, My Lord. One more...conclusive point.\nJudge:\nConclusive? Go on...\nVan Zieks:\nFortunately, the victim, Mr Shamspeare, has regained consciousness after his ordeal. And he has named the true culprit.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nThe poison consumed by the victim was administered in a cup of tea that he drank on the night in question. Tea, My Lord, that was brought to the victim's room by the accused.\nJudge:\nThe accused...? Good grief! Ordaaar! Ordaaar!\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes...that's the crux of this whole case. If Soseki-san is innocent, then why...? Why has the victim accused him?)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr Natsume? What have you to say to this accusation?\nSoseki:\nThat evening, yes...I did take some freshly brewed tea with me when I visited Mr Shamspeare's room, as a gift. The public water pump outside always freezes at night, so I bought bottled water especially to make it. And this is the result! Never will I touch tea again! Never!\nRyunosuke:\nThe public pump was frozen, you say?\nSusato:\nThat's not information we've heard before.\nJudge:\nThat will do, thank you. Now, according to our laws, the defence must have the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses at least once. Therefore, I call upon these witnesses now for a formal testimony. ...I presume the prosecution has no objection?\nVan Zieks:\nNone whatsoever, My Lord.\nJudge:\nGood. Then you will give your account of events on the night in question to the court now.\nSoseki:\nYe-Ye-Ye...YEEEEEESSS, MY LORD!\nWitness Testimony\n- The Catastrophic Night -\nSoseki:\nIt was around nine o'clock that evening when I visited my neighbour, and I took some tea with me as a gift.\nWe had a heated literary debate over a nice, hot drink. After which I went back to my room, at around eleven.\nArgh! My tea was completely harmless! He couldn't have locked the door behind me otherwise, could he?\nGregson:\nStrychnine takes some time to have an effect on the body. People don't keel over immediately after takin' it.\nThe victim would have been perfectly able to lock the door after his guest left. The argument still stands.\nJudge:\nHm, yes, I see... It all seems relatively straightforward.\nSusato:\nExcuse me, but...that testimony does raise one rather crucial point, I think. Mr Natsume claims his tea to have been harmless. Presumably, though... ...the teacups have been examined for traces of the poison...haven't they?\nRyunosuke:\n(Why didn't I think of that?)\nGregson:\nWell, as it happens, no. We haven't been able to.\nJudge:\nDid I hear you correctly, Inspector? Scotland Yard has failed to examine the suspect substance?\nRyunosuke:\nHow could you have overlooked something so important?! Isn't that the first thing you should have done?\nVan Zieks:\n...My learned Nipponese friend is falsely incensed.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nThe inspector said Scotland Yard was unable to examine the tea. Not that it was overlooked.\nRyunosuke:\nUnable? Why?\nGregson:\nIt's simple enough. There was none left. Not a drop. Someone must have been very thirsty indeed.\nVan Zieks:\nWith current scientific techniques, it's not possible to test for poison under such circumstances.\nGregson:\nWe only need a drop, but that one drop does actually have to exist, funnily enough.\nJudge:\nHmmm...\nVan Zieks:\nThe lack of examination notwithstanding... ...it appears nothing other than the tea passed the victim's lips on the night in question.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nJudge:\nI see. Thank you. The matter is clear.\nVan Zieks:\nCast your eyes over the jury, my learned friend.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nVan Zieks:\nYou can see it in their faces, I'm sure. The recognition of the accused's guilt. Your client's fate is all but sealed. In mere moments from now...you will lose, and your compatriot will be damned for all eternity!\nRyunosuke:\n(He's right. I can feel all six of the jurors looking daggers at me. But I can't let them beat me down... I won't...)\nJudge:\nCounsel for the Defence...proceed with your cross-examination!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, My Lord!\nCross-Examination\n- The Catastrophic Night -\nSoseki:\nIt was around nine o'clock that evening when I visited my neighbour, and I took some tea with me as a gift.\nSoseki:\nWe had a heated literary debate over a nice, hot drink. After which I went back to my room, at around eleven.\nSoseki:\nArgh! My tea was completely harmless! He couldn't have locked the door behind me otherwise, could he?\nGregson:\nStrychnine takes some time to have an effect on the body. People don't keel over immediately after takin' it.\nGregson:\nThe victim would have been perfectly able to lock the door after his guest left. The argument still stands.\nRyunosuke:\n(That's the extent of their testimony, is it?)\nSusato:\nIf I could voice a personal opinion, Mr Naruhodo...\nRyunosuke:\nOf course. Go ahead.\nSusato:\nMr Natsume is arguing for his innocence so adamantly and so persistently... ...yet Inspector Gregson just brushes what he says aside. It's really quite infuriating!\nRyunosuke:\nI agree. So we need to find an inconsistency in what the inspector is saying, I think.\nSusato:\nI'm afraid so. As things stand, the jurors are sure to find Mr Natsume guilty.\nRyunosuke:\n(As I see it, what we need to focus on is the poison and the tea...) Let's listen carefully to this testimony again.\nSusato:\nYes!\nRyunosuke:\nThe argument still stands, you say? I think not, Inspector!\nGregson:\n...Come again?\nRyunosuke:\nI think you'll find...that you've overlooked a very significant chronological inconsistency here!\nGregson:\nA chrono-what? What are you on about?\nRyunosuke:\nAccording to this report... ...the victim must have consumed the poison at around... one thirty in the morning. And yet... ...the defendant, Mr Natsume, left the victim's room at eleven.\nGregson:\nAh!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, that's right... There's more than two hours of missing time there!\nGregson:\n...Nnf...\nRyunosuke:\nIn other words... ...if there was poison in the tea that Mr Natsume brought to the victim's room... ...how could the victim have fallen ill to it...two and a half full hours after the defendant left?!\nGregson:\nUWAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\nJudge:\nThe defence's argument is entirely reasonable. How do you respond, Lord van Zieks?\nVan Zieks:\n...Pray forgive the discourtesy if my mind has wandered. I was considering what cuisine would best complement the contents of my hallowed chalice this luncheon.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nHow could it have happened, you ask? I do hate to shatter illusions, but my Nipponese friend appears to be chasing a phantom idea.\nRyunosuke:\nA phantom...?!\nVan Zieks:\nIs it so hard to imagine that the victim drank his tea after the accused had left? For example, at the time stated in the medical report. Yes...at around half past one.\nRyunosuke:\nRyunosuke:\nMr Natsume brought the tea with him to drink together with his neighbour! And in Japan, there is a well known saying: 'Drink tea while it's hot!'\nVan Zieks:\nVan Zieks:\nAnd in my country, there is an even more apt saying: 'There is nothing more refreshing than cold tea.'\nRyunosuke:\nThe, the point is...if there was such a long gap... ...there may be other ways to explain how the victim came to be poisoned! Other possibilities!\nJudge:\nWhat sort of possibilities, Counsel?\nRyunosuke:\n......... Well...for example... The man could have had another visitor!\nVan Zieks:\nAnother visitor? That's a very bold assertion, my learned friend...from someone who has nothing to substantiate it.\nRyunosuke:\nOr...or...the victim could have taken the poison of his own volition!\nJudge:\nYou suggest this may have been a suicide, Counsel?\nVan Zieks:\nVan Zieks:\nMr Shamspeare has categorically denied suicide. The idea can and must be discounted.\nRyunosuke:\nRyunosuke:\nBut, but he could be lying!\nVan Zieks:\n.........\n.........\n..................\nJudge:\nIs something wrong, Lord van Zieks?\nVan Zieks:\nI was listening to the sound of the carriage pulling up outside the courtroom. Pray, forgive the discourtesy.\nRyunosuke:\nCarriage? What carriage?\nVan Zieks:\nIt would seem...that the key player in this case has just arrived.\n???:\n???:\n'Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow...'\nShamspeare:\n'...a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more. It is a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.'\nJudge:\nWho, sir, are you...?\nShamspeare:\nWilliam Shamspeare, My Lord. Alas 'twas I, undone by these bitter events. I...am the victim!\nRyunosuke:\nWha... What's he doing here?!\nVan Zieks:\nThe prosecution seeks to call this gentleman to the stand. With his testimony, my learned friend's futile resistance will be utterly crushed.\nRyunosuke:\nYou're calling him as a witness?\nJudge:\nVery well, Counsel. I grant your request with interest. I'm curious to discover what the court shall hear from the victim himself!\nShamspeare:\nHappy am I, Shamspeare, to regale thee with my tale of woe, My Lord.\nSoseki:\nB-But...! I still have my own tale to tell! My own tale of worse woe! I CAN REGALE THE COURT WITH THE TALE OF MY PERFECT INNOCENCE IN PERFECT ENGLISH!\nJudge:\nThat will do, Mr Natsume. Let the court now hear from the victim!\nRyunosuke:\n(Alright, so that's Mr Shamspeare... But who's that other man beside him?)\nSusato:\nYes, I think... I feel sure that we've caught a glimpse of that man before.\nVan Zieks:\nState your names and occupations for the court, please, witnesses.\nShamspeare:\nA writer of words so sweet, they do scent the breeze. An inventor of ideas so profound, they compose the earth. The unrivall'd poet, the unmatched scribe, William Shakespeare... Were the great bard to be recall'd to life anew, lo, what a magnificent man! Good fellows, I am he who ponders such a miracle... William Shamspeare.\nMetermann:\nOh, um...the name's Metermann. Adron B. Metermann. I work for the Altamont Gas Company, East End branch office.\nSusato:\nAh! I remember now! It was yesterday, on Briar Road...\nRyunosuke:\nOh yes! (She's right. It's him!)\nRyunosuke:\n(Oh...what's this? What's that man doing over there? He looks like he's trying to see into Soseki-san's lodgings...)\nSusato:\nIs something wrong, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nUm, excuse me! Could we have a word?\n???:\nAh!\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes, we spotted him outside Mr Garrideb's house that morning. And he's a gas company employee? What does he have to do with this case?)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr William Shamspeare...you are the victim in this miserable affair, correct?\nShamspeare:\n'O Heaven! O Hell! Do you command me to remember?' That sweet poison that didst cross me and cross mine innocent lips.\nVan Zieks:\nI subpoenaed him for the trial. With his doctor's permission, naturally. Hearing the testimony of the aggrieved will remove any room for doubt from the jurors' minds, I'm sure.\nShamspeare:\nBehold, you have only to rearrange the letters of my name to see that 'me's a seraph'! An angel, indeed! Thus be I noble of mind, sweet of nature and verily, honest of heart. As all heavenly angels be.\nRyunosuke:\n(Because there isn't a less contrived meaning in your name. No, not at all...)\nSusato:\nThe jurors seem to be very moved by this man, I'm afraid.\nRyunosuke:\n(They're actually taking this 'seraph' anagram idea seriously...?)\nJudge:\nThank you, witnesses, for your illuminating introductions.\nRyunosuke:\nBut My Lord...what's the man next to Mr Shamspeare doing here? The gasman, I mean.\nMetermann:\nUh? What? Me? Well now...\nVan Zieks:\nAllow me to enlighten my learned friend. You recall, I presume, your earlier impertinence? When you suggested that the victim had another visitor to his room on the night in question. And, moreover, that the victim is a compulsive liar.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! No, no I didn't quite say that...\nVan Zieks:\nThis young chin-stroker is here to controvert your wild claims. Conclusively. Is that not so...Mr Metermann?\nMetermann:\nEh? Hang on, no... I'm just here...\nJudge:\nI hereby call for your formal testimonies. You will tell the court as lucidly as possible what happened on the night in question!\nShamspeare:\n'One may smile, and smile, and be a villain...' Yes, it doth pain me, but let the truth be spoken! The truth of that wintry night of my discontent.\nMetermann:\nHmmm...\nWitness Testimony\n- The Wintry Night of My Discontent -\nShamspeare:\nThe snow lay about. My neighbour did cometh in the evening, bearing a gift of tea.\nBut marry! Bitter was his drink! And when he left, I did fall prostrate on my table!\n'Twas the tea alone did pass my lips that late hour. Nought else.\nMetermann:\nI was outside this bloke's window in the freezin' cold all night, keepin' an eye on his room.\nNo one else visited his room but that short little round-backed Eastern fella.\nRyunosuke:\nWait, what did you say?! You were 'keeping an eye' on Mr Shamspeare's room all night?!\nMetermann:\nThat's right. 'Course, the bloke's window is all but blocked up, isn't it? But there's a little gap in the bricks where you can see into the room. So I spent the night tryin' to keep my teeth from chatterin' as I peered in through that.\nJudge:\nThe question is, sir...why?\nMetermann:\nAh! Well now, that's because he's on my list!\nShamspeare:\n'What a piece of work is a man!' ...Wherefore wouldst thou not stare in wonderment?\nRyunosuke:\nWhat are you talking about?\nShamspeare:\nThis buzzing busybody hath not part in this play. I pray thee...pay him no heed. Make no more ado about his tedious words...\nMetermann:\nWhat'd you say about me?!\nVan Zieks:\nCalm yourself. This court is concerned with what happened on the night in question. Nothing more.\nJudge:\nIndeed, that is so.\nVan Zieks:\nAnd, as the testimony we have just heard clearly reveals... ...there was no one other than the accused present at the time who could have carried out this crime.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nJudge:\nWell...I believe this may be the final testimony of the trial. Now, Counsel...the defence may proceed with the cross-examination!\nRyunosuke:\nYes...My Lord!\nCross-Examination\n- The Wintry Night of My Discontent -\nShamspeare:\nThe snow lay about. My neighbour did cometh in the evening, bearing a gift of tea.\nShamspeare:\nBut marry! Bitter was his drink! And when he left, I did fall prostrate on my table!\nShamspeare:\n'Twas the tea alone did pass my lips that late hour. Nought else.\nMetermann:\nI was outside this bloke's window in the freezin' cold all night, keepin' an eye on his room.\nMetermann:\nNo one else visited his room but that short little round-backed Eastern fella.\nRyunosuke:\n(So that's the entire testimony...)\nSusato:\nWhat do you think, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nWell...erm... ...I can't see any obvious holes at all, to be honest.\nSusato:\nNo... Oh dear... If nobody else visited Mr Shamspeare's room that night apart from Mr Natsume... ...I imagine the members of the jury will all conclude the same thing.\nRyunosuke:\n(Right. That he's guilty...) Well, all we can do is press these witnesses for more information and hope for a breakthrough.\nSusato:\nYes!\nAfter pressing all statements:\n???:\nJuror No. 1:\nMy Looord!\nJudge:\nGoodness me! Yes, Mr Foreman?\nJuror No. 1:\nI've kept my mouth shut and listened up to now, but this has gone on long enough. Are you all with me?\nYEEEEEESSS!\nVan Zieks:\nAre we to understand...that you ladies and gentlemen of the jury are in agreement with one another? That you've reached a unanimous decision?\nJuror No. 1:\nToo right, we have!  Are you all with me?\nYEEEEEESSS!\nRyunosuke:\nWait! No! The defence is in the middle of a cross-examination!\nJuror No. 1:\nTo be honest, I was holding out a bit of hope for you, young man. Especially after you identified those few hours that followed the accused leaving the victim's room.\nJuror No. 2:\nYes, the three 'missing hours' as you put it.\nJuror No. 3:\nBut in the end, what difference do they make? None, as far as I can see.\nJuror No. 4:\nAnd since that's now apparent, there's really no reason to delay our decision any longer.\nJuror No. 5:\nLike I was saying before: if I don't take five bob home with me tonight, the missus will blow her top!\nJuror No. 6:\nHm? What's that? Sorry, I didn't quite catch what you said...\nJudge:\nVery well, let the court be apprised of your decisions. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you will state your leanings as to the defendant's culpability!\nJuror No. 1:\nGuilty!\nJuror No. 2:\nGuilty!\nJuror No. 3:\nGuilty!\nJuror No. 4:\nGuilty!\nJuror No. 5:\nGuilty!\nJuror No. 6:\nGuilty!\nRyunosuke:\nA-All of you...?\nJudge:\nWell, it would appear that the jury is indeed unanimous.\nVan Zieks:\nSo...this time at least, it seems justice will be done. All's well that ends well, as they say. This calls for a toast, I feel... To the guilty being punished!\nRyunosuke:\nUgh... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\nSusato:\nGet up, Mr Naruhodo! Please! The trial isn't over yet!\nRyunosuke:\nWh-What do you mean, Miss Susato?\nSusato:\nWhat about the information I found in this Encyclopaedia of British Law that I have? That obscure right that belongs to the defence in these situations...remember?\nRyunosuke:\n......... ...A summation examination... ...Yes, that's right... We don't have a jury in Japanese courts, of course. But here in a British court of law, if we can reverse the decisions of a majority of the jurors... ...we can force the trial to continue. (This trial can't end now. Whatever it takes, I just can't let that happen!) The defence moves to invoke its right to a summation examination, My Lord!\nVan Zieks:\nWhy am I not surprised...at my learned Nipponese friend's inability to admit defeat? You choose to cling desperately to some archaic rule you barely comprehend instead of accepting the truth.\nJudge:\nCertainly no other defence counsellor in recent times has exercised the right to a summation examination.\nVan Zieks:\nBecause they all know that once the jury's mind is set, it cannot be altered.\nJudge:\nNevertheless, the right remains and must be upheld. The defence counsel's request is granted. This court will proceed with a summation examination, as outlined in the Encyclopaedia of British Law!\nRyunosuke:\nThank you, My Lord!\nJudge:\nAre you and your fellows prepared, Mr Foreman?\nJuror No. 1:\nBelieve me, My Lord, we know all about this young lad's tenacity. And we're ready for it!\nJudge:\nVery well. In that case, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I hereby call upon each of you... ...to state the grounds upon which you find the defendant guilty of the crime for which he stands accused!\nJudicial Findings\n- The Jurors' Contentions -\nJuror No. 1:\nThe victim may not be well off, but he's a noble man and straight up! There's no reason to doubt the man.\nJuror No. 2:\nWell, I do declare the good gentleman has no reason to lie. In fact...I think he's rather splendid.\nJuror No. 3:\nJust look at the accused by comparison! He's Japanese, stoops all the while, and has a moustache! Very fishy...\nJuror No. 4:\nThere's no evidence to suggest the gangling actor is a fraudsman. ...For now, at least.\nJuror No. 5:\nAgh! I really don't care, like! I just need this trial to end quickly!\nJuror No. 6:\nThree hours of 'missing time' is nothing when you reach my age, you know. Nothing at all.\nRyunosuke:\n(I knew it... Every single one of them seems completely convinced...)\nSusato:\nIt would seem that all the jurors... ...have come to the conclusion that Mr Shamspeare is a fine, upstanding and honest citizen.\nRyunosuke:\nIf you ask me, they've all been bewitched by his strange theatrical movements.\nSusato:\nAnd sadly, nothing Mr Natsume has said appears to have registered at all.\nRyunosuke:\nWell...here goes! (Let's not forget... ...I've pleaded with the jury on Soseki-san's behalf before and it worked. So you never know!)\nSusato:\nBefore we begin... ...it might be an idea for me to remind you exactly how a summation examination works, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\nOh.\nSusato:\nWell, you're still very new to British law, after all.\nRyunosuke:\n(That's true, I suppose. And Soseki-san's fate is entirely in my hands now, too. There's always a chance I might have forgotten some crucial detail. Perhaps I should hear Susato-san out. I wonder...should I let her talk me through it again or not bother?)\nJudge:\nWithout further ado, please, Counsel. Proceed with the summation examination!\nRyunosuke:\n...Yes, My Lord!\nJury Examination\n- The Defence's Rebuttal -\nJuror No. 1:\nThe victim may not be well off, but he's a noble man and straight up! There's no reason to doubt the man.\nJuror No. 1:\nAlright, if you can show me that the victim's a liar, I'll reconsider my position!\nJuror No. 2:\nWell, I do declare the good gentleman has no reason to lie. In fact...I think he's rather splendid.\nJuror No. 3:\nJust look at the accused by comparison! He's Japanese, stoops all the while, and has a moustache! Very fishy...\nJuror No. 4:\nThere's no evidence to suggest the gangling actor is a fraudsman. ...For now, at least.\nJuror No. 4:\nThe 'victim' puts on a fine performance, but in reality, he's a common thief...of my company's gas!\nJuror No. 5:\nAgh! I really don't care, like! I just need this trial to end quickly!\nJuror No. 6:\nThree hours of 'missing time' is nothing when you reach my age, you know. Nothing at all.\nSusato:\nThe key to summation examinations is identifying contradictions between jurors' statements, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\nRight, and once I've found two jurors whose statements can't coexist, I need to pit those jurors against each other. Then hopefully, when they see that what they're saying doesn't make sense, they'll change their leaning.\nSusato:\nYes. And if you're able to change the minds of a majority of the jurors, the trial will continue. But conversely, if you're unable to do that, the judge will declare the trial over and move to adjudication.\nRyunosuke:\n(And I can't let that happen. Somehow or other, I have to turn this trial around!)\nRyunosuke:\nThose two statements clearly contradict each other!\nJudge:\nGood gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel?\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number one!\nJuror No. 1:\nEh? What are you yelling about, lad?\nRyunosuke:\nI presume you've heard juror number four's statement? Made by the wife of the owner of Altamont Gas.\nJuror No. 1:\nWell, yes...\nRyunosuke:\nThe victim, who you claim to be a noble, 'straight up' man... ...in fact turns out to be a 'common thief'.\nJuror No. 1:\nSo the good lady says. But there's no evidence, is there? You and I both heard them say as much!\nJuror No. 4:\nIt's true, we don't have evidence as such...just yet. But the claims aren't baseless, you know.\nJuror No. 1:\nWhat?\nJuror No. 4:\nYou heard me. Seeing as his operation has already been compromised... ...I would suggest that the court hears testimony from our East End branch office employee over there.\nMetermann:\nI'll do whatever you say, my lady! Gasman's honour!\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number one! You say you're a man of your word!\nJuror No. 1:\n...!\nRyunosuke:\nIf I could show that Mr Shamspeare was a liar, you assured me... ...that you would reconsider your decision about the defendant's guilt.\nJuror No. 1:\n......... Hm, yes, I did say that. And as a man of honour, I'll hold to it. ...As I'm sure the other gentlemen of the jury will!\nJuror No. 3:\nMe?! Oh, well, yes... Now that we've found out the man's a liar, perhaps we ought to consider the matter further.\nJuror No. 6:\nWell...if I'm perfectly honest, I haven't heard half of what you've all been saying. So if this means you'll recap a few points, that would suit me down to the ground.\nJuror No. 5:\nOh no, I'm not having any part of this! I want this trial over and done with!\nJuror No. 4:\nIn that case, I shall change my leaning.\nJuror No. 1:\nSo, Mr William Shamspeare...if that is your real name... ...we of the jury demand to know exactly what kind of a man you really are!\nRyunosuke:\nThat's...four jurors! Four for 'not guilty'!\nSusato:\nYes, Mr Naruhodo! Victory!\nJudge:\nOrdaaar! Ordaaar! Well...this is quite extraordinary, I must say. As a result of the defence's summation examination, the jury's leaning has changed. Now only two jurors say 'guilty', whilst four say 'not guilty'. I therefore declare this court to be in a state of disaccord... ...and order the trial to continue!\nVan Zieks:\nYou have spoilt the bouquet...Mr Shamspeare.\nShamspeare:\n.........\nVan Zieks:\nThe ladies and gentlemen of the jury now find they are unable to trust you, the victim.\nShamspeare:\n......... 'But you gods will give us, Some faults to make us men.' So God mend me, I do swear... This gasman speaketh that which concerns him most: nought but gas! Nought but thin air! Ay, it burneth bright a while, but it hath no substance. And it doth reek foul!\nMetermann:\nOi, what did you say?!\nJudge:\nDo I take it, Mr Shamspeare, that you deny the allegations of gas thievery?\nShamspeare:\nMost heartily, My Lord! Hast thou forgot? I am as a seraph! An angel! Noble of mind, sweet of nature and verily, honest of heart.\nMetermann:\nArgh, you flowery-mouthed, pompous beanpole! Just cos I haven't got the evidence yet...\nRyunosuke:\nMr Shamspeare! If, in fact, you are NOT noble of mind, sweet of nature or honest of heart... If you are a liar... ...then your testimony should have no sway in this courtroom!\nShamspeare:\n.........\nJudge:\nIt is my considered opinion... ...that at the present time, no other possible culprit of this crime has been identified. All testimony heard by the court thus far heavily implicates the defendant. In short, it would not be unreasonable at this stage for me to rule on the case.\nSusato:\nOh no...\nJudge:\nHowever...in light of the fact that the jury has expressed concern about the fidelity of this witness... ...I believe it would be inappropriate for this court not to pursue the point further.\nVan Zieks:\nVan Zieks:\nI assure you, My Lord, that would be a waste of the court's time. The gas and this case are unrelated.\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number four!\nJuror No. 4:\nYes?\nRyunosuke:\nDidn't you say before that although you had no hard evidence to prove this man has been stealing gas... ...you have strong grounds for suspecting him?\nJuror No. 4:\nThat's right, we do. ...Don't we, hm, worker?\nMetermann:\nAbsolutely, Lady Quinby! Gasman's honour!\nJudge:\nVery well, then. We will hear your testimony now. You will tell the court precisely why you believe the victim, Mr William Shamspeare, has been stealing gas.\nMetermann:\nYes, My Lord, it'll be my pleasure! On the Altamont Gas name, I swear-\nJuror No. 4:\nIf I may, My Lord...?\nJudge:\nGo ahead, madam.\nJuror No. 4:\nThis worker's testimony may have a significant bearing on the good name of my husband's company. Therefore, I should like to take the stand alongside him, in a supervisory role. If you wouldn't mind.\nMetermann:\nWahoo! Oh, yeah! Sweet as honey! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!\nJudge:\n...Very well. As an exception, I shall honour your request.\nJuror No. 4:\nThank you, My Lord.\nMetermann:\nYou wait till the boss gives you an earful! Ooh, it's gonna sting, you mark my words!\nJudge:\nSo, you will both testify before the court... ...on the subject of the illegal consumption of the Altamont Gas Company's fuel!\nJuror No. 4:\nYes... ...Is that clear, my good man?\nMetermann:\nClear as Altamont gas, my lady! ...Which is the clearest in the world!\nRyunosuke:\nDo you think the gas has gone to his head, Miss Susato?\nSusato:\nI think the man is just a very dedicated employee, Mr Naruhodo.\nWitness Testimony\n- The Altamont Gas Company's Investigation -\nMetermann:\nI'm proud to be the company's East End branch investigator and meter money collection agent.\nAltamont gas meters accept thruppenny bits, each coin givin' customers about two hours of gorgeous gas!\nAltamont:\nAnd yet, the meter in Mr Shamspeare's room didn't have a single coin in it!\nThe meter doesn't appear to have been tampered with, though, and the collection agent has the only key.\nMetermann:\nSomehow, he's usin' all the flamin' gas he wants without payin' a penny! If that's not thievin', what is?!\nVan Zieks:\n...Pray forgive the discourtesy. The irrelevance of this testimony caused me to turn to my hallowed chalice.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean by that remark, Lord van Zieks?\nVan Zieks:\nDid the moustachioed Nipponese poison the gangling excuse for an actor or didn't he? That is all that should concern this court. And yet now we must listen to this...abhorrence. Clearly what separates the vast British Empire and your Eastern island nation is more than geographical distance.\nRyunosuke:\nBut...but this could turn out to be crucial testimony! The cross-examination must go ahead!\nVan Zieks:\n...Do what you will.\nSusato:\nLord van Zieks appears to be in a violent mood.\nRyunosuke:\nYes...he does. (An attempted poisoning...and an incidence of gas theft with no supporting evidence... It's true that they would appear completely unrelated at first glance. But I wonder... The truth tends to be buried in the most unusual places. And the first step in uncovering it...will be to establish just who and what this man really is!)\nCross-Examination\n- The Altamont Gas Company's Investigation -\nMetermann:\nI'm proud to be the company's East End branch investigator and meter money collection agent.\nMetermann:\nAltamont gas meters accept thruppenny bits, each coin givin' customers about two hours of gorgeous gas!\nAltamont:\nAnd yet, the meter in Mr Shamspeare's room didn't have a single coin in it!\nAltamont:\nThe meter doesn't appear to have been tampered with, though, and the collection agent has the only key.\nAltamont:\nAll joints on the meter are welded shut, and the lock is made from solid steel. There's no way to dismantle it.\nAltamont:\nThe meter is designed for coins the exact diameter and thickness of a thruppenny bit. Nothing else will fit.\nMetermann:\nSomehow, he's usin' all the flamin' gas he wants without payin' a penny! If that's not thievin', what is?!\nRyunosuke:\n(I certainly didn't expect to uncover another crime that looks like it's been taking place in the very same room...)\nSusato:\nAccording to the testimony, it's only the meter in Mr Shamspeare's room that's under suspicion. It does seem as though perhaps it has nothing to do with the incident involving Mr Natsume...\nRyunosuke:\nI know. It does seem that way. But the fact is... ...since I've been practising law in England, I feel like I've encountered this at least once already. Cases that are interlinked.\nSusato:\nOh...\nRyunosuke:\nIt might seem that two cases have nothing to do with one another at first. But in fact, they're intimately connected.\nSusato:\nYes, we have experienced that before, haven't we? I wonder if this is another instance...?\nRyunosuke:\nPerhaps... But we can't be sure of that yet. (If the Altamont Gas Company has been investigating Mr Shamspeare so earnestly... ...there must be something to it. But then how has he been managing to steal their gas?)\nRyunosuke:\nLet me just confirm something here... If the diameter and thickness were to be correct... ...the meter would accept any object as if it were a thruppenny bit. Is that correct?\nAltamont:\nYes, that is correct.\nRyunosuke:\nWell, by something of a coincidence, while we were investigating in Mr Shamspeare's room... ...we found a particular item that matches the dimensions perfectly.\nAltamont:\nSomething the same size as a thruppenny bit?! What was it?\nRyunosuke:\nThe item in question...is this!\nMetermann:\nWha...? Have you been inhalin' gas? That's a bar of soap!\nAltamont:\nIt certainly looks nothing like a thruppenny bit, I must say...\nRyunosuke:\n(It looks like I'm going to have to point out exactly what I mean here.) What's so important about the soap...is this part here!\nRyunosuke:\nYou have to turn over the soap to see what I mean.\nAltamont:\nAh! Are you referring to that round depression in the middle of the soap there?\nRyunosuke:\nThat's right. A depression that's approximately three-quarters of an inch in diameter. Or in other words, almost exactly the same size as a thruppenny bit.\nMetermann:\nGET AWAY!\nJudge:\nDoes anyone here present have in their possession a thruppenny bit? Quickly now! Hand over your coins, ladies and gentlemen!\nSusato:\nIt sounds rather like a highway robbery, doesn't it?\nJudge:\nThanks to a kind member of the public in the gallery, I have here a thruppenny bit. Now, to see if it fits... ......... My word! It couldn't be more snug!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, as I suspected... This, without a doubt, is a vital clue to explain how the Altamont Gas Company is being defrauded!\nAltamont:\nWell! I don't believe it!\nVan Zieks:\nSo...your assertion amounts to what? That some inferior bar of soap has a tentative connection to the theft of gas?\nRyunosuke:\nYes! The depression in the soap was clearly made by a thruppenny bit.\nJudge:\nI must concur at least, that pushing a coin with some force into a poor-quality bar of soap such as this... ...is a remarkably simple way of replicating the coin's shape.\nMetermann:\nAnd then you could use...well, some melted wax or somethin' to pour into the mould... You could make fake coins in no time!\nRyunosuke:\n(This brings all the pieces of the puzzle together. It's the method Mr Shamspeare has been using to steal the gas... That's the missing link! And now if I follow the chain of thought... ...it's going to bring me to a new explanation for what happened that nobody's considered yet!)\nAltamont:\nBut...this is all nonsense! If the man had been making fake coins, my worker here would have found them when he emptied the meter!\nJudge:\nQuite true, Lady Altamont. In the absence of some black magic that could make them disappear...\nVan Zieks:\n......... I see. That's what we're dealing with, is it? There is one form of 'black magic' that could cause the fake coins to disappear into thin air, yes.\nRyunosuke:\nExactly. And the meter here gives it away.\nAltamont:\nWhat on earth...?\nRyunosuke:\nThere are remnants of the 'magical' method used visible on the gas meter taken from the victim's room!\nJudge:\nIf that is your assertion, Counsel, the defence will identify these remnants for the court at once! Where on the meter can the remnants of the method used to make the fake coins disappear be seen?\nRyunosuke:\nWe found this bar of soap at the scene of the crime, just outside the victim's window.\nMetermann:\nOutside...?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, outside, where you yourself, Mr Metermann, were loitering...in the freezing winter air. That's where we found this soap.\nMetermann:\nAh! I get it!\nRyunosuke:\nThat's right. The answer, of course...is ice.\nJudge:\nDid you say...ice?\nRyunosuke:\nMr Shamspeare has been leaving soaps like this outside his window each evening, filled with water. After a night outside in the bitter cold, the water is completely frozen solid the next morning.\nVan Zieks:\nThen he takes his fake coins of ice and feeds them into the gas meter, giving him light and warmth in spades. As his room becomes very comfortably warm, the ice now inside the meter's coin box...melts...\nRyunosuke:\n...Turning back into water... ...and draining harmlessly away through the small hole made in the underside of the meter. That is how, without leaving any evidence of his wrongdoing, this man has been stealing Altamont gas!\nAltamont:\n.........\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nJudge:\n.........\nAltamont:\nJust like that... So simply... Is, is he trying to make us look like idiots? He's been fooling us all with some bars of soap and some water?\nRyunosuke:\nThat's right, madam.\nAltamont:\nI don't believe it! It can't be true! Do you have any idea how much money we spent to develop that new meter? And now you have the audacity to suggest...that a bit of soap and some water can render it totally useless?\nRyunosuke:\nI'm fairly sure I didn't design it...\nAltamont:\n...Evidence!\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nAltamont:\nI want evidence! If you're going to stand here and tell me our meters are rubbish, I want to see proof!\nSusato:\n...She's very good at enforcing accountability, isn't she?\nRyunosuke:\nVery well, Lady Altamont. If you'd like evidence, I'll provide it.\nAltamont:\nWhat?\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo! Are, are you saying...you do actually have evidence to support this theory?!\nRyunosuke:\n(I did notice a trace of something that bothered me a little at the time. And I have a feeling that this theory we've come up with now could explain it.) The piece of evidence that substantiates the theory about how Mr Shamspeare has been stealing gas is...\nRyunosuke:\nThis is a photograph of the scene at the point when the victim was discovered, taken by Inspector Gregson. And it clearly shows the remnants of the crime carried out by Mr Shamspeare!\nVan Zieks:\nWhat remnants?\nRyunosuke:\nHere you can see the gas meter on the wall in Mr Shamspeare's room. Now...look closely at the floorboards directly underneath the meter.\nAltamont:\nWhat, what is that? Some kind of grubby stain...\nRyunosuke:\nAlmost certainly...it's a water stain resulting from the liquid that drained out of the hole made in the meter.\nAltamont:\nAh!\nRyunosuke:\nIf one coin gives around two hours of gas usage, and the occupant was heating his room in all his waking hours... ...we can imagine he would have used around ten of his fake coins each day. The melting ice inside the meter's coin box would have been dripping out almost constantly... ...leaving a stain on the floor.\nAltamont:\nThis, this is awful...\nRyunosuke:\nAnd there's further evidence, too. Mr Shamspeare is slumped over the table, apparently having consumed strychnine. And right there next to him...is a bar of soap, broken in half.\nAltamont:\nYou're right...\nJudge:\nIt would appear to me then, Counsel... ...that the man was eating the soap, was he?\nVan Zieks:\nPardon me for disagreeing with Your Lordship, but... ...certainly not.\nSusato:\nHe didn't beat about the bush there, did he?\nRyunosuke:\nIn truth... ...Mr Shamspeare was found with a fork in his hand.\nJudge:\nA meal of soap is sounding increasingly likely, Lord van Zieks...\nMetermann:\nD'you mean to say...? He was using the fork to...\nRyunosuke:\nYes. To extract a frozen coin from the bar of soap.\nAltamont:\nAh!\nSusato:\nBut the bar broke in half... ...so perhaps it didn't go very well.\nJudge:\nGood gracious!\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nL-Lord van Zieks!\nVan Zieks:\nI was throwing my hand up in despair... ...and happened to catch my hallowed bottle on the way. Pray, forgive my maladroit mistake.\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Counsel?\nVan Zieks:\nAllow me to pose my learned friend a question: What exactly did you establish with your most recent cross-examination?\nRyunosuke:\nUm...well...\nSusato:\nThat Mr William Shamspeare is a liar and a thief. In other words...that his testimony is unreliable!\nRyunosuke:\nThat's it! That's exactly it!\nVan Zieks:\nVery well, let us assume the man is a liar. Now allow me to pose another question: What possible difference does that make?\nRyunosuke:\nWell...\nVan Zieks:\nWe know that suicide can be discounted. Scotland Yard's investigation revealed no sign of another vessel that contained poison.\nJuror No. 1:\n...!\nJuror No. 2:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nAnd on the night in question, there were no visitors to the room except the accused. The young gasman's testimony, which we have no reason to doubt, has confirmed that.\nJuror No. 3:\n...!\nAltamont:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nFurthermore...the only possible way the poison could have entered the victim's body is via the tea. The court has seen no evidence whatsoever that suggests otherwise.\nJuror No. 5:\n...!\nJuror No. 6:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nEven if William Shamspeare is the liar you claim him to be... ...these facts have been objectively established. There's no escaping it!\nRyunosuke:\nAgh!\nVan Zieks:\nTherefore, in light of these facts... ...the prosecution calls for immediate adjudication!\nRyunosuke:\nY-You......... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nJudge:\nOrdaaar! Ordaaar! Well, Counsel? How does the defence respond?\nSusato:\nM-Mr Naruhodo!\nRyunosuke:\n(What was the point of that last cross-examination? Did it actually get us anywhere? Or did it make no difference at all, like Lord van Zieks is saying?)\nRyunosuke:\nNo! This isn't over! The defence will not rest!\nVan Zieks:\nWhat?\nJudge:\nBut, Counsel, you've successfully explained everything! You've identified and substantiated the unscrupulous method employed by Mr Shamspeare to consume gas. What more is there to discuss?\nRyunosuke:\nLord van Zieks just highlighted three 'facts' in order to make his point. But contrary to what he would have the court believe, not all of them have been objectively established at all!\nVan Zieks:\nWhat are you trying to say, my Nipponese friend?\nRyunosuke:\nAt least one of those so-called facts is an assumption, made due to a lack of evidence.\nVan Zieks:\n...!\nRyunosuke:\nBut the situation has changed now following the cross-examination of the latest witnesses to take the stand.\nVan Zieks:\nDon't be absurd! What is this nonsense?!\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes, when you bring everything we've learnt so far together and consider it as a whole, it's clear... There's a question that we now need to consider. Namely...)\nRyunosuke:\nWe've all been led to believe that the strychnine poison that afflicted Mr Shamspeare... ...was in the tea brought to him by Mr Natsume. But that's conjecture at best.\nVan Zieks:\nVan Zieks:\nThe victim has testified that nothing else passed his lips that night. There is no other possibility. And since there was no trace of the tea left at the scene, it couldn't be tested for traces of the poison.\nRyunosuke:\nRyunosuke:\nAs I said, the situation has changed. Because in fact...some of Mr Natsume's tea WAS left at the scene! And a particular piece of evidence proves it!\nVan Zieks:\nVan Zieks:\nA ludicrous claim. Scotland Yard detectives investigated the scene exhaustively. What evidence are you suggesting they missed?\nJudge:\nThe defence has made a bold claim indeed. Very well, Counsel... Present your proof! What evidence from the scene of the crime can tell us about the nature of the defendant's tea?\nJudge:\nGood gracious! The soap again? The same bar the victim used to fashion his coins of ice?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, that's right, My Lord. It's just come back to me. Something about when we first found this bar of soap at the scene yesterday.\nSusato:\nIt's...more bars of soap!\nRyunosuke:\nSoap? What are bars of soap doing lined up on a ledge outside the window?\nRyunosuke:\nI'm quite certain that when we originally stumbled upon the bars of soap... ...there was actually a frozen coin in each bar.\nVan Zieks:\nSo you discovered the gas thief's coin factory. Fascinating...\nRyunosuke:\nIn a way, yes. But there's more. The coins we found in the soap at the time weren't normal ice.\nJudge:\nThere, there was something strange about them, you mean?\nRyunosuke:\nExactly. Something very obviously strange. They were red.\nVan Zieks:\nThe ice...was red? No... You mean...?\nRyunosuke:\nThat's right. It's obvious to me now. The fake coins in the soap...were made from frozen tea!\nVan Zieks:\n...!\nWHAAAAAAAT?!\nRyunosuke:\nI would remind the court of a statement made by Mr Natsume earlier in this trial...\nSoseki:\nThat evening, yes...I did take some freshly brewed tea with me when I visited Mr Shamspeare's room, as a gift. The public water pump outside always freezes at night, so I bought bottled water especially to make it. And this is the result! Never will I touch tea again! Never!\nJudge:\nAh yes. I believe there had been a snowfall that day. It was particularly cold. Sadly on such occasions, the poorly constructed water mains in the East End are prone to freezing.\nRyunosuke:\nSo on the night in question, Mr Shamspeare, having no running water to use... ...was forced to use the tea brought by Mr Natsume in order to make his fake coins!\nJudge:\nMy word!\nRyunosuke:\nThere were two bars of soap on the window ledge when my judicial assistant and I investigated the scene.\nSusato:\nThat's right. And we only borrowed one of them.\nRyunosuke:\nWhich means...that even as we speak, some of the defendant's tea is still present at the scene of the crime... ...frozen solid in a bar of soap outside Mr Shamspeare's window!\nJudge:\nExtraordinary!\nRyunosuke:\nEarlier today, Inspector Gregson informed the court... ...that if even one drop of the tea remained, Scotland Yard would be able to analyse it for poison. As such, we are now in a position to prove or disprove what has until now been mere conjecture... ...by finding out for sure whether or not Mr Natsume's tea actually contained strychnine at all!\nVan Zieks:\nArgh! You...smug Nipponese...!\nRyunosuke:\nMy Lord, we cannot do the defendant the injustice of passing judgement now! The police should be dispatched to recover the remaining bar of soap from the scene at once! And the defence requests a thorough analysis of the frozen tea embedded in it... ...to determine whether or not it contains any poison!\nJudge:\nBailiff! Bailiff! Instruct the police to attend the scene at once!\nBailiff:\nYes, My Lord! Understood!\nJudge:\nIt would seem we have no choice but to suspend these proceedings for the time being. I trust you have no objection, Lord van Zieks?\nVan Zieks:\nNone, My Lord.\nJudge:\nScotland Yard will recover the tea from the scene and carry out the requisite tests immediately. The trial will resume at the same hour tomorrow. The prosecution and defence may conduct further investigations as appropriate in the interim.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, My Lord!\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n(Well... ...we managed to scrape through there somehow.)\nJudge:\nThank you, Counsels. Court is adjourned until tomorrow!\nTo be continued...",

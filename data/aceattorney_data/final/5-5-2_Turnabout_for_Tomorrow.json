The sins we've committed... and the sadness we've caused... No matter how far we run, our past remains... ...as ever-present as the moon in the sky. It looms in wait... for the day when we are forced to face it. But only in doing so can we truly make peace and move on in hope towards tomorrow.\nDecember 20, 1:23 PMWright Anything Agency\nPhoenix:\n(They took Athena from the courtroom, straight to the station. She's probably being questioned at this very moment.) ............ (After this past year, I took it for granted that those two would always be here. But now, Apollo has gone off on his own to seek his own truth... ...and my pursuit of the truth only ended up with Athena becoming the new suspect. Some boss I turned out to be...)\nTrucy:\n............ It's even quieter in here than usual.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... It seems so empty, too.\nTrucy:\nI just don't get it, Daddy. All of your reasoning during the trial seemed perfectly solid...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... And I still believe it was... At least, based on what we know.\nTrucy:\nBut now, Athena is the one who's being accused...\nPhoenix:\nDuring the trial for the bombing and murder that occurred at the Cosmos Space Center... ...the lighter used by the real culprit was found. This lighter proved the defendant, Solomon Starbuck, innocent. But Athena's prints were found on it instead... ...and she was subsequently arrested for the murder.\nTrucy:\nBut Athena couldn't have done it. It just doesn't make any sense.\nPhoenix:\n(No, none of it does. I've been racking my brain, but I just can't figure it out! Argh! Where is the flaw in my reasoning? What have I got wrong in this case?)\nTrucy:\nYou know, Daddy... if Athena was here... ...she wouldn't just be sitting around thinking. She'd be out there doing something. You ARE going to defend Athena, right, Daddy?\nPhoenix:\nOf course I will! And thanks, Trucy. I needed that push. (Trucy's right! The trial is tomorrow. There's no time to waste! If I'm going to prove Athena's innocence, I'd better get out there and find some evidence!)\nTrucy:\nOff we go, then! We're on a hunt for evidence that'll prove Athena's innocence!\nPhoenix:\n(Great! But before we go, I'd better tidy up the evidence I have on hand...)\nUnnecessary evidence left at the office.\nPhoenix:\n(Athena is probably still in the middle of being questioned... ...so Trucy's right. The thing to start with is talking to people at the Space Center.)\nTalk\nWhat to do\nTrucy:\nI still can't believe Apollo really left us...\nPhoenix:\nIt was so sudden.\nTrucy:\nMaybe he got tired of being my assistant for my magic tricks?\nPhoenix:\nI don't think it's your fault, Trucy.\nTrucy:\nB-But I made him clean the toilet a lot! And I made him go bring in the newspaper! It WAS my fault! I just know it! Oh, Apollo! *sniffle*\nPhoenix:\nI really don't think it was your fault, Trucy. But I didn't realize Apollo was wearing so many hats around here, either.\nAny ideas?\nTrucy:\nHow could they suspect Athena? It's just ridiculous. It must be some kind of conspiracy.\nPhoenix:\nA conspiracy, huh? Well, it certainly is some kind of mistake, that's for sure.\nTrucy:\nFirst of all, we have to bust Athena out of the Detention Center. Then we have to chase down the people who framed her. We'll sneak around the world, from Kiev to Carolina, with the fuzz hot on our tails!\nPhoenix:\nIsn't that exactly the same as the plot of the movie you watched the other day?\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nTrucy:\nI guess presenting your attorney's badge... ...is like your \"quick trick,\" huh, Daddy?\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. So it's just a trick to you, huh?\nTrucy:\nWell, you are one of the talents in our Wright Anything Agency, after all. But I have to say that an attorney's badge won't get many laughs...\nPhoenix:\nI don't care if I get laughs, as long as I can clear my client's name.\nTrucy:\nHa ha ha! That's a good one, Daddy!\nPhoenix:\nI'm no match for you, though, Trucy.\nSpace Center Pamphlet\nTrucy:\nSpace, huh... I'd sure love to go up there someday. Will you take me, Daddy?\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. It's not like taking somebody to an amusement park, you know.\nTrucy:\nWell, you hardly ever take me to one of those, either! You either say, \"I don't have any money\" or \"I don't have time\"!\nPhoenix:\nF-Fine. I'll take you on my next day off.\nTrucy:\nYou're the best, Daddy!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. (I'm no match for Trucy...)\nAnything else\nTrucy:\nDaddy, you should be careful about showing evidence to a magician.\nPhoenix:\nThat's true. You can make anything disappear.\nTrucy:\nWell, anything up to about a yard in diameter, anyway. My magic panties are an extra-dimensional space!\nPhoenix:\nI guess only a space probe can help us figure out how they work then, huh.\nDecember 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance\nPhoenix:\nDirector Cosmos! Do you have a minute?!\nCosmos:\nUrgk! Galactic Scooter! Full speed ahead!\nPhoenix:\nDirector! (He scooted away...)\nTrucy:\nHis expression changed the instant he saw you, Daddy!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, well, I dragged his name through the mud pretty good at the trial earlier today...)\nDecember 20Cosmos Space Center - Boarding Lounge\nPhoenix:\nWe were here only yesterday... Oh, hey! Mr. Starbuck! You've been released, huh?\nStarbuck:\nYup. And I came straight here. This is all thanks to you and your team, Mr. Wright! You've given me a second chance to fly into space again. I can't thank you enough. Except... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong? (I thought he'd be happy to be acquitted...)\nStarbuck:\nAs I was coming out of the Detention Center, I saw Miss Cykes.\nPhoenix:\n(H-He saw Athena?)\nStarbuck:\nI was at a loss for words. I didn't know what to say to the poor girl. And then, you know what? She flashed a peace sign at me. \"Congratulations on your acquittal,\" she said. \"Now you can go back into space someday.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, that sounds like Athena. I can just picture it.)\nStarbuck:\nBut I saw her eyes. They were red and swollen from crying. She's gotta be suffering! She must be so worried! And yet she went out of her way to be nice and give me that big smile!\nTrucy:\nShe held back her own tears so she could give someone else a smile. That's... so Athena.\nStarbuck:\nThere's no question about it. That girl is innocent. Please, Mr. Wright. You have to make sure she goes free! And then, they can put me in prison instead! I don't mind!\nPhoenix:\n(We can't have that either, Mr. Starbuck!) Don't worry, Mr. Starbuck. I'm going to give her the very best defense I can. I promise to get her acquitted, just like I did for you.\nStarbuck:\nI know she'll be all right with you in her corner. I know you'll never give up on her. Apollo has a fine boss to look up to!\nTalk\nAbout the murder\nStarbuck:\nI still can't believe Launch Pad 1 was switched with the Space Museum...\nPhoenix:\nWhat could have made Director Cosmos do such a thing?\nStarbuck:\nI haven't the foggiest idea. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... So there never was gonna be a launch that day, not from the very beginning... I wonder if Clay knew...?\nPhoenix:\nI imagine he must have. Surely he would've noticed when you went to board the rocket.\nStarbuck:\nIt's pathetic to think I was the only one who got taken in. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... But I guess that's about how it goes, when you're worth less than space debris.\nTrucy:\nIs he... going to be all right, Daddy? His expression looks as dark as a black hole...\nPhoenix:\nWell... That's just how he is.\nThe murderer (appears after \"About the murder\")\nPhoenix:\nMr. Starbuck, do you remember anything about the murderer?\nStarbuck:\nNot really. I only saw a shadowy figure in the dark after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I guess that was a little too much to hope for...)\nStarbuck:\nHey, I heard something from the police, though. They said they never did find a .10-caliber gun down that trash chute.\nPhoenix:\nJust as I thought. The culprit must've carried it away with them when they escaped.\nTrucy:\nSo, was the person you saw holding a gun, Mr. Starbuck?\nStarbuck:\nUmm... I couldn't really tell.\nPhoenix:\nBut it wasn't Athena, right? Could you tell if the person was male or female, tall or short?\nStarbuck:\nI-I can't even tell you that much. Man, I'm useless... When the culprit opened the door and some light came in, I should've been able to see...\nPhoenix:\nThe door... Ah, yes... As I recall, they opened this door here as they made their escape...\nTrucy:\nThe door to Launch Pad 1, right?\nStarbuck:\nYeah, except, right now, the door leads to the Space Museum.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the launch pad and the Space Museum are switched right now?\nStarbuck:\nYeah, they're trying to investigate the theory you came up with in court.\nPhoenix:\nSo they're recreating the conditions, huh? (I'd like to see what's beyond that door now.) Mr. Starbuck, could you open this door for us?\nStarbuck:\nSure. Just let me have my prints scanned here...\nThe murderer (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nMr. Starbuck, do you remember anything about the murderer?\nStarbuck:\nNot really. I only saw a shadowy figure in the dark after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I guess that was a little too much to hope for...)\nStarbuck:\nHey, I heard something from the police, though. They said they never did find a .10-caliber gun down that trash chute.\nPhoenix:\nJust as I thought. The culprit must've carried it away with them when they escaped.\nTrucy:\nSo, was the person you saw holding a gun, Mr. Starbuck?\nStarbuck:\nUmm... I couldn't really tell.\nPhoenix:\nBut it wasn't Athena, right? Could you tell if the person was male or female, tall or short?\nStarbuck:\nI-I can't even tell you that much. Man, I'm useless... When the culprit opened the door and some light came in, I should've been able to see...\nSwitching the launch pads (appears after \"The murderer\")\nLeads to:\n\"Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot?\"\nPresent\nTerran's Autopsy Report\nStarbuck:\nClay always used to cheerfully greet me in a loud voice.\nPhoenix:\nAnd he did vocal exercises every morning, sometimes until he was hoarse, right?\nStarbuck:\nExactly. You could always hear him, even through the wall-- Hey, wait a minute. Did you know Clay?\nPhoenix:\nNo, but like attracts like, as they say.\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nDo you know anything about this piece of evidence?\nStarbuck:\nNo... Sorry I'm so useless... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...\nPhoenix:\nNo, no. It's all right. There's no need to get all depressed!\nPhoenix:\nDo the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot?\nStarbuck:\nWell, back when the Space Museum was Launch Pad 2... ...they used to switch the pads around at times.\nPhoenix:\nBut these days, Launch Pad 2 is only used as a tourist attraction, right?\nStarbuck:\nRight. 'Cause, quite frankly, the Space Center needs the money.\nPhoenix:\n(I hear you... Times sure are tough...)\nTrucy:\nDaddy, let's go check out what's beyond that door!\nPhoenix:\nSure. Let's go.\nStarbuck:\nHey, why don't I come along? I can show you around!\nExamine\nLeaves\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I wonder what these dead leaves are doing here?\nTrucy:\nMaybe they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes. There are lots of trees around the Space Center.\nPhoenix:\n(She's right. It's a modern, state-of-the-art building, but it's surrounded by trees.) But I don't know. If they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes... ...wouldn't they look more crushed up? These don't look like they've been stepped on.\nTrucy:\nMaybe there's some kind of secret hatch in the corridor, and they came in that way?\nPhoenix:\nNot everything is set up like a magician's stage, you know.\nFingerprint scanner\nPhoenix:\nSo this is another one of those devices for opening the door, huh?\nStarbuck:\nYup. But this one doesn't require fingerprint verification. You just hit the button and \"open sesame\"!\nTrucy:\nSo when you and Clay went through here, you didn't need to show your prints, either?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, Trucy. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2.\nLaunch Pad 1 Door Lock updated in the Court Record.\nFingerprint scanner (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo this is another one of those devices for opening the door, huh?\nStarbuck:\nYup. But this one doesn't require fingerprint verification. You just hit the button and \"open sesame\"!\nTrucy:\nSo when you and Clay went through here, you didn't need to show your prints, either?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, Trucy. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2.\nAfter examining leaves and fingerprint scanner:\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I don't see anything else that jumps out at me. And I imagine this corridor is built exactly like the Launch Pad 1 corridor.)\nTalk\nSwitching the launch pads\nPhoenix:\nDo the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot?\nStarbuck:\nWell, back when the Space Museum was Launch Pad 2... ...they used to switch the pads around at times.\nPhoenix:\nBut these days, Launch Pad 2 is only used as a tourist attraction, right?\nStarbuck:\nRight. 'Cause, quite frankly, the Space Center needs the money.\nPhoenix:\n(I hear you... Times sure are tough...)\nTrucy:\nSo, right now, this Boarding Lounge 1 is connected to the Space Museum...\nPhoenix:\nI guess the police are trying to re-create the conditions of the crime.\nTrucy:\nAnd just now, when we checked the hallway on the other side of the door...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it looks like that door opens from the corridor side without fingerprint verification.\nTrucy:\nSo when Clay and Mr. Starbuck went through, they didn't need to scan their prints, either.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2.\nTrucy:\nAnd remember there were those dead leaves in the corridor? I wonder where they came from? Hmm... I still think maybe they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know. Those leaves didn't look like they'd been stepped on to me...)\nDecember 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance\nCosmos:\nUrgn! Curse the wretch who sullied my good name! Reverse course and full speed away!\nPhoenix:\nDirector Cosmos! Wait!\nTrucy:\nI'll handle this, Daddy! Take that!\nCosmos:\nGaaaaagh! The mobility system has been compromised!\nPhoenix:\n(Trucy's knife throw was a direct hit to one of his tires!)\nTrucy:\nAnd the streak continues!\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe I should've kept a closer watch on what tricks she's been practicing...)\nCosmos:\nMy dear, old battleship! We fought many a skirmish together! It has been an honor...\nTrucy:\nDaddy! He's going to blow that thing up!\nPhoenix:\nNah. I bet all that button will do is make it go haywire again.\nCosmos:\n............Very well. I surrender. As a prisoner of war, I expect to be treated honorably.\nTalk\nSwitching the launch pads\nPhoenix:\nDirector Cosmos, when you were talking in court about switching the launch pads... ...you used your right to remain silent about the reason as to why.\nPhoenix:\nI'd like Director Cosmos to tell us... ...why he switched the two launch pads to begin with.\nCosmos:\nNnngh... Please... I can't... I... I exercise my right to remain silent... But I will say... my hands were tied... I was only doing what I could to keep my men from getting caught in that blast. Nngh... Nnnggggh...\nCosmos:\nThe center of the cosmos is shrouded in mystery! But I don't have any secrets left... ...now that my battleship has been destroyed and I've been taken prisoner!\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(No secrets left, huh? I beg to differ. Looks like I'll have to undo his Psyche-Locks if I want to get to the bottom of this.)\nPresent Magatama\nPhoenix:\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- Behind the Switching of the Launch Pads --\nPhoenix:\nI want you to tell me everything you're hiding about the switching of the two launch pads.\nCosmos:\nI refuse! You can't make me! I can hold out longer than anyone!\nPhoenix:\n(I hope I never get like this when I'm old... Now, let's see. Where to start?) This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it...\nTo fool the bomber\nPhoenix:\nYou said your motive was to fool the bomber, right?\nCosmos:\nNo, by then, the bomb had already been set. Switching the launch pads after the fact would have done nothing to fool the bomber.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? Ugh, I guess I got it wrong.) Ha ha. That was just a little joke. Now I'll tell you what you really said at the trial.\nLeads back to:\n\"This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it...\"\nTo prevent the bombing\nPhoenix:\nYou said your motive was to prevent the bombing, right?\nCosmos:\nHmph. So what you're saying is... ...that even though I switched the launch pads to prevent the bombing from happening... ...it ended up happening anyway, and I am nothing but a big fool?!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I never said that last bit...) Ha ha. That was just a little joke. Now I'll tell you what you really said at the trial.\nLeads back to:\n\"This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it...\"\nTo save the astronauts\nLeads to:\n\"Thanks to you switching the launch pads, the astronauts escaped injury from the blast.\"\nPhoenix:\nThanks to you switching the launch pads, the astronauts escaped injury from the blast. Instead, they safely boarded the Museum's rocket, far away from the actual explosion.\nCosmos:\nHmph! My astronauts were raring to go out on an authentic adventure in space! How do you propose I had them board a fake rocket without them noticing?!\nPhoenix:\n...I agree you couldn't have done it without help. For one, they would have figured it out the instant they stepped into the Space Museum. You figured you could fool Mr. Starbuck once he'd been drugged with his medication, but... ...without the help of this person, it would've been impossible to pull your plan off.\nPresent Clay Terran profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"You must have gotten Mr. Terran to help you.\"\nPresent anyone else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt wasn't this person, was it?\nCosmos:\nAre we done here? I'm quite busy with the aftermath of the incident, you know.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh... Guess I was right about being wrong...) ...Well, I did say it \"WASN'T this person,\" didn't I? But I still contend that...\nLeads back to:\n\"...without the help of this person, it would've been impossible to pull your plan off.\"\nPhoenix:\nYou must have gotten Mr. Terran to help you.\nCosmos:\nUrghk!\nPhoenix:\nHe stole the tranquilizers from his mentor's locker and slipped them to him. And then, with Mr. Starbuck in a daze, they boarded the replica rocket in the museum!\nCosmos:\nAaaaagh! Someone please help this poor prisoner of war!\nPhoenix:\n(How is he able to spin around like that...?)\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nPhoenix:\nIf you really wanted to save the astronauts' lives... ...shouldn't you just have called off the launch?\nCosmos:\nIf I could have done that, do you think I would have gone to all that trouble?!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he must've had a compelling reason why he couldn't call it off...) But how did you know to switch the pads in advance of the bombing incident?\nCosmos:\nW-Well, that's because... nrgh... I was warned in advance. Once I received that warning, it was my duty to ensure my astronauts' safety!\nPhoenix:\nBut it was just a warning. It could even have been a prank. Why did you believe in it so completely?\nCosmos:\nB-Because I went to one of those \"mediums\" that everyone's talking about these days.\nPhoenix:\nOh? I didn't realize channeling was back in vogue. ...Besides, I thought it was you yourself that got the warning via telephone.\nCosmos:\nYes, that's right! The bomber contacted me personally. My battleship is equipped with a special advanced communications system, you see!\nPhoenix:\n(AKA, a regular ol' telephone.)\nCosmos:\n\"It's been a while. Planning another launch? I see you haven't learned...\" I'll never forget the terror I felt when I received that call.\nPhoenix:\nThe bomber said, \"It's been a while\"...? And that was enough to make you take the threat seriously? (Perhaps Director Cosmos took the threat so seriously... ...because the Space Center had been involved in a bombing once before? Maybe... ...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!)\nThe Courtroom No. 4 bombing\nPhoenix:\nIt was the courtroom bombing, wasn't it?! That's when you were dealt a major blow!\nCosmos:\nDo you really think blowing up a courtroom would've shaken the center of the cosmos?\nPhoenix:\nGaaagh... (I guess I got it wrong... The director felt personally threatened, so it has to be something more relevant to him. )\nLeads back to:\n\"...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!\"\nThe HAT-1 Miracle\nLeads to:\n\"The HAT-1 Miracle, that epic story of survival...\"\nThe HAT-2 bombing\nPhoenix:\nThe HAT-2 bombing. That must be where the answer to your secret lies.\nCosmos:\nAll hands! Ready the Galactic Scooter's main turrets! Teach this blockhead what a precision shot is all about!\nPhoenix:\nAaaaaaagh! You got me! (Unh... I guess I was way off on that one... Now, let's see...)\nLeads back to:\n\"...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!\"\nPhoenix:\nThe HAT-1 Miracle, that epic story of survival... People across the nation know it now as a heroic tale of bravery. But in truth, it was an act of sabotage perpetrated by our current killer, wasn't it? Very few knew about the previous plot, so when the caller said, \"It's been a while\"... ...you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the danger was real, and it wasn't a prank!\nCosmos:\nGaaaaaaagh! Didn't anyone ever tell you to go easy on an ex-serviceman?!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nCosmos:\n...Yes, the HAT-1 Miracle was really a desperate battle against an act of sabotage. I even lost the life of one of my staff members in the fight.\nPhoenix:\n(Sabotage, murder... So this is the ugly truth behind the HAT-1 Miracle.)\nCosmos:\nI let my guard down... I thought the saboteur had been caught, and that the case was closed.\nPhoenix:\n(...Huh? Wait a minute... The murder at the Space Center seven years ago...! This must be the person Director Cosmos thought was the culprit.)\nPresent Simon Blackquill profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Simon Blackquill, the murder suspect in a case that happened here seven years ago.\"\nPresent anyone else\nPhoenix:\nCosmos:\nMr. Lawyer, you must be very tired. Why don't you take a nap in one of our zero-gravity beds?\nPhoenix:\n(...I guess I picked the wrong person. Although I do like the sound of a zero-g nap right about now... But that will have to wait! I still have a Psyche-Lock left to break!)\nLeads back to:\n\"This must be the person Director Cosmos thought was the culprit.\"\nPhoenix:\nSimon Blackquill, the murder suspect in a case that happened here seven years ago. That place and time of the two incidents -- the murder and the sabotage -- were the same. So you thought that he committed both crimes. But while Prosecutor Blackquill was behind bars, you got another threatening call. If the culprit this time is the same as seven years ago, then it isn't Simon Blackquill. Realizing that, you were shaken. It meant the true culprit's been running free all this time.\nCosmos:\nNgaaagh... How do you keep seeing straight through me?!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nSwitching the launch pads (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nPhoenix:\n(The reason why Director Cosmos won't talk about why he switched the launch pads... ...is connected to the truth behind the HAT-1 Miracle. The sabotage and murder that happened at this Space Center seven years ago...) Director Cosmos, tell us what you're hiding!\nCosmos:\nIf you really want to understand the reason I decided to switch the launch pads... ...we'll have to start with the story of that horrible nightmare from seven years ago.\nPhoenix:\nSeven years ago... You mean the so-called \"HAT-1 Miracle\"?\nCosmos:\nThe launch went smoothly, but once the ship entered outer space, then the troubles began. It was all the handiwork of a certain person and their evil scheme.\nPhoenix:\n(So Mr. Starbuck's traumatic experience wasn't accidental...)\nCosmos:\nNot only that, but before the launch, a very valuable piece of moon rock was stolen. But that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered!\nTrucy:\nWow. I had no idea such awful events were behind that exciting story of space heroism...\nCosmos:\nAll that, in spite of the Space Center having very strict security in those days. All personal effects were examined thoroughly, coming or going. You couldn't even smuggle a withered old leaf through those checkpoints!\nPhoenix:\nSo... do you have any clue who was responsible for the sabotage...?\nCosmos:\nAt the very least, I know it wasn't Simon Blackquill. I don't know enough to identify the true culprit, but it's clear WHAT that person is. To put it simply............ a spy.\nTrucy:\nA spy?! You mean somebody who infiltrates a foreign country... ...carries out dangerous missions, and always gets the girl?!\nPhoenix:\n(Someone's watching way too many late-night movies.) Well, I guess if we're talking about blowing up a rocket and stealing research material... ...it's not all that surprising that a spy could be behind it all.\nThe spy (appears after \"Switching the launch pads\")\nCosmos:\nMake no mistake! There's cutthroat rivalry between nations in the space R&D race. Some try to outdo others by any means possible, even deliberate obstructions. Seven years ago, we got a call before the launch warning us of sabotage.\nPhoenix:\nThe same MO as this time...\nCosmos:\nYes. And here I thought the perpetrator had been caught, but it looks like I was wrong.\nTrucy:\nProsecutor Blackquill seems more like a ninja than a spy, don'tcha think?\nPhoenix:\n(Aren't ninjas and spies basically the same thing?)\nCosmos:\nBut there's a good reason we failed to find the real spy... ...A massive cover-up by the government. Government officials were too embarrassed to admit... ...that they had allowed such a thing to happen at the hands of a spy.\nPhoenix:\nDon't tell me they made the police rush the investigation?\nCosmos:\nThey did indeed. And then, to cover up the sabotage, they cleaned up the story.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that was \"The HAT-1 Miracle,\" wasn't it? (But then, seven years later, the same MO -- advance warning of sabotage... That must've been the director's reason for switching the launch pads.)\nJust like seven years ago (appears after \"The spy\")\nPhoenix:\nSeven years ago, the spy gave you advance warning of their plans, just like this time. That was what made you decide to switch the launch pads, wasn't it?\nCosmos:\nThat's right. The caller knew the facts of the case seven years ago, despite the cover-up. They knew about the sabotage, the moon rock, the murder. And they said... ...\"You don't want things to go like they did seven years ago, do you?\" I immediately thought of calling off the launch, but the government wouldn't let me! \"We don't give in to the likes of terrorists! We must proceed for our country's honor!\" It was quite a moving speech, actually.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Moving\"? Really? Maybe if you're easily inspired by political talking points...)\nCosmos:\nBut I knew the truth. We had been warned, which meant that the danger was very real. And I knew there was no way to stop the spy. No matter what I did, they would find a way. That's why I switched the launch pads, and staged the moving rescue scene. First, I snuck into the Center the night before and switched the launch pads. That way, the astronauts would go from Boarding Lounge 1 to the Space Museum. Then, I put a \"closed for repairs\" sign at the door to Launch Pad 1 in Boarding Lounge 2.\nPhoenix:\nYou did that so normal visitors wouldn't enter, right? What else did you do?\nCosmos:\nI enlisted the help of several staff members, including Terran.\nPhoenix:\nBut you didn't let Mr. Starbuck in on it?\nCosmos:\nHe'd already been through enough, and he's no good at lying to keep a secret... I'm afraid I had no choice but to have him drugged. My plan went well, until...\nTrucy:\n...Clay's murder, huh...\nCosmos:\nAfter the culprit made their escape, I switched the launch pads back. I did it in such a way that no one would find out. But after all that effort... ...Terran is dead, and the HAT-2 is destroyed! And the Hope capsule, which had returned to us only recently, was also lost in that blast! My home, the center of the cosmos... my beautiful Cosmos Space Center is done for!\nPhoenix:\n(Wait, what did he mean by the Hope capsule was lost in that blast...?)\nThe \"Hope\" capsule (appears after \"Just like seven years ago\")\nPhoenix:\nI thought that the Hope capsule was found at the crime scene with Mr. Terran. It had just been brought back by the Hope space probe with asteroid samples inside.\nPhoenix:\nSo what kind of samples are they? What's in them?\nCosmos:\n............The samples are scheduled for analysis in the near future. We haven't had time, since they just came back the day before Terran's murder.\nCosmos:\nThe capsule was being held in a safe in Launch Pad 1... ...but I gave it to Terran before the incident so it wouldn't be destroyed in the explosion. The idea was that, with it safely in Terran's possession... ...he could make it look like he rescued it during the staged \"miraculous escape.\" But our precious research materials... ended up lost to that explosion anyway...\nTrucy:\nBut I thought Clay was supposed to keep it safe?\nCosmos:\nYou misunderstand. The launch pad explosion wasn't the one the capsule was lost to... It was lost after the police confiscated it as evidence. It was the courtroom bombing from the other day. The capsule was there in the courtroom as evidence, and was blown to smithereens!\nPhoenix:\n(Yet another casualty of that blast...)\nCosmos:\nUltimately, I think the culprit may have known about the switching of the launch pads.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? H-How?\nCosmos:\nThe police found a wiretapping device during their investigation today. A bug aboard my battleship, a tap on my advanced communications system!\nPhoenix:\nA wire on that phone?\nCosmos:\nYes... A wire on this very phone. I used this phone to give instructions to my staff about the launch pad switch. Just to the few select members who knew about the plan. Just before the incident, staff members were coming in and out of Launch Pad 1. The culprit probably slipped in with them amid the confusion...\nPhoenix:\nAnd planted the bomb then... Yes, if they were tapping your phone, they definitely could pull something like that off. So you really think the same spy is behind this incident and the one seven years ago?\nCosmos:\nYes. I'm sure of it.\nPhoenix:\nThen, this spy... must be the \"phantom\" Prosecutor Blackquill has been chasing...\nFulbright:\nBut Prosecutor Blackquill told me once... \"The hunt I've been on for the phantom of seven years past continues even still.\"\nFulbright:\nFor starters, that case happened right here at this very Space Center, too.\nTrucy:\nSo if we can find this \"phantom\"...!\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. We can clear Athena's name. And then there's the matter of Prosecutor Blackquill, too.\nTrucy:\nWhat about him?\nPhoenix:\nWell, IF the culprit of seven years ago is the same person as in the current incident... ...it would mean Prosecutor Blackquill is innocent. That's still an \"if,\" though...\nTrucy:\nHmm... I wonder how dangerous that guy would be in court without handcuffs...? But if we're going on a ghost hunt, count me in!\nCosmos:\nHee hee hee... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! It's all over for me! Spin! Spin! Whirl! Whirl! I'm done for! The center of the cosmos is doomed!\nTrucy:\nDo you think he's going to be all right, Daddy?\nPhoenix:\nWell, at least he'll be in good company. There must be planets out there he can spin with. Which reminds me... I'd like to delve a little deeper into the HAT-1 mission, too.\nCosmos:\nIf you want to learn more, start with the Space Museum. There's a HAT-1 exhibit there. Oh, don't mind me. I'll just keep spinning here and see how the cosmos unfolds...\nTrucy:\nIt's like he achieved spiritual enlightenment or something!\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure he'll stop when he gets dizzy. Let's go visit the Space Museum!\nThe \"Hope\" capsule (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nI thought that the Hope capsule was found at the crime scene with Mr. Terran. It had just been brought back by the Hope space probe with asteroid samples inside.\nPhoenix:\nSo what kind of samples are they? What's in them?\nCosmos:\n............The samples are scheduled for analysis in the near future. We haven't had time, since they just came back the day before Terran's murder.\nCosmos:\nThe capsule was being held in a safe in Launch Pad 1... ...but I gave it to Terran before the incident so it wouldn't be destroyed in the explosion. The idea was that, with it safely in Terran's possession... ...he could make it look like he rescued it during the staged \"miraculous escape.\" But our precious research materials... ended up lost to that explosion anyway...\nTrucy:\nBut I thought Clay was supposed to keep it safe?\nCosmos:\nYou misunderstand. The launch pad explosion wasn't the one the capsule was lost to... It was lost after the police confiscated it as evidence. It was the courtroom bombing from the other day. The capsule was there in the courtroom as evidence, and was blown to smithereens!\nPhoenix:\n(Yet another casualty of that blast...)\nCosmos:\nUltimately, I think the culprit may have known about the switching of the launch pads.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?

Just before the incident, staff members were coming in and out of Launch Pad 1. The culprit probably slipped in with them amid the confusion...\nPhoenix:\nAnd planted the bomb then... Yes, if they were tapping your phone, they definitely could pull something like that off.\nPresent\nClay's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife\nCosmos:\nWhat a shame. Truly. Clay was so young... He was an outstanding man who could have contributed greatly to the future of mankind.\nPhoenix:\nHe was an exceptional man, wasn't he.\nCosmos:\nIf he had gone into space, my reputation would have grown even loftier! Why did he have to die before he went into space?!\nPhoenix:\n(Someone needs to teach him he is not the literal center of the cosmos...)\nSpace Center Pamphlet or \"Hope\" Capsule\nCosmos:\nMankind's crowning achievement, the HAT-1 mission, will be in textbooks across the land!\nPhoenix:\nWow. That historic, huh?\nCosmos:\nMy achievements are grand enough to rival the very birth of space itself! My life will be a legend that will be told millions of years into the future! You may proceed to admire and praise me now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha... You certainly are an amazing piece of work.\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, but about this piece of evidence...\nCosmos:\nLet me ask YOU a question. What will that object contribute to the future of mankind?!\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Uh, not much, I guess...\nCosmos:\nHmph. Then how important could it be? Quite unlike the great historical figure, Yuri Cosmos! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!\nPhoenix:\n(If he's any more self-absorbed, he'll turn into his very own black hole.)\nBefore clearing \"The \"Hope\" capsule\" Talk option in Cosmos Space Center - Entrance:\nDecember 20Cosmos Space Center - Space Museum\nTrucy:\nWow... The place is crawling with cops.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like we won't get any investigating done here now. Let's come back later.\nAfter clearing \"The \"Hope\" capsule\" Talk option in Cosmos Space Center - Entrance:\nDecember 20Cosmos Space Center - Space Museum\nTrucy:\nLet's see... Where's the exhibit on the launch seven years ago...?\nPhoenix:\nThere, that's the HAT-1 exhibit.\nTrucy:\nOh, wow! Look at that photo of the team!\nPhoenix:\nThere's Clay, and Mr. Starbuck, Director Cosmos, Aura Blackquill, and even Ponco. ...But I've never seen the woman on the right before.\nTrucy:\nEverybody looks so happy! ...Well, except for Director Cosmos.\nPhoenix:\nLet's check out the newspaper article, too. \"HAT-1 Launch Imminent\"... And there's a photo of the Hope space probe. I guess it's only natural it doesn't talk about the murder or the sabotage.\nTrucy:\nThey really were keeping it a secret, just like the director said. Daddy, take a look at that jacket...\nPhoenix:\nIt must be the HAT-1 team's uniform jacket. It's the same design as the one Apollo was wearing, the one that belonged to Clay.\nTrucy:\n\"Actual jacket worn by a HAT-1 team member,\" it says.\nPhoenix:\nNot a replica, huh? (I wonder if it was Mr. Starbuck's?)\nHAT-1 Exhibit added to the Court Record.\n???:\nHello...?\nPhoenix:\nOh, Ms. Woods! What brings you here?\nWoods:\nI... I heard Thena got arrested, so I... ...I've been looking for you, Mr. Wright. I thought you might be here... at the scene...\nPhoenix:\nYou must be so worried! But rest assured. I'm going to do my very best to defend her.\nWoods:\nThena's going through such a hard time. I hope she doesn't lose heart. Even just coming back to this place must've been really difficult for her...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? You mean the Cosmos Space Center?\nWoods:\nWhat, you didn't know...? She used to live here, when she was a little girl.\nPhoenix:\nSh-She did?! No, I didn't know... (No wonder she knew so much...) Ms. Woods, could you tell me more, in detail?\nTalk\nAthena and the Space Center\nWoods:\nThena's mom worked here. If I remember right, she was a doctor of psychology, or something like that...\nPhoenix:\nBut why was a psychology specialist working at a space research facility?\nWoods:\nI don't really know. But I do know that she lived and worked here, so Thena lived here, too.\nPhoenix:\nSo it was far from Athena's first time here. I wonder why she didn't mention it?\nWoods:\nShe probably didn't want to talk about it. This place is connected to a very sad memory for her.\nSad memory (appears after \"Athena and the Space Center\")\nPhoenix:\nA sad memory...? Can you tell me about it?\nWoods:\nThere was a terrible incident here... It was seven years ago.\nPhoenix:\n(The same time frame as the HAT-1 launch...)\nWoods:\nThena's mom... In the robotics lab... She was... murdered...\nTrucy:\nWh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nWoods:\nAfter it happened, Thena stopped coming to school.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Athena... And all this time, she never let on at all...)\nWoods:\nI was so worried about her! I came here so many times, hoping to see her...\nBut I never saw her again.\nWoods:\nAfter a while, we started exchanging letters... ...but I didn't get to see her face-to-face for seven long years.\nPhoenix:\nAnd so the first time you'd seen her in seven years was during Prof. Courte's case?\nWoods:\nThat's right. And I was so surprised! She was like a completely different person, so cheerful and happy!\nYoung Athena (appears after \"Sad memory\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Athena like as a child?\nWoods:\nShe was very sensitive and kind. She didn't talk very much. She liked to draw and paint at home.\nTrucy:\nThat's completely different from the Athena we know now. I can't even picture it...\nWoods:\nShe never left the Space Center much because... ...she was very sensitive to other people's emotions. When she went to crowded places, she'd get dizzy from all the emotions flying around.\nPhoenix:\n(It must be hard to hear people's hearts as well as their voices...)\nWoods:\nShe always wore these big, heavy-looking headphones. She said her mother made them for her, as part of her research.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh. I wonder what kind of research it was?)\nWoods:\nBecause of her special ability, Thena couldn't handle being in school very often. And I was always out sick because of my weak constitution. Maybe that's why we became such good friends. We used to play together here at the Space Center a lot. It brings back memories.\nTrucy:\nSounds like Athena's mother played a big role here at the Space Center. Ooh! Daddy, show her that picture!\nPhoenix:\n(Atta girl! Good idea.)\nPresent\nHAT-1 Exhibit (after clearing \"Young Athena\" Talk option)\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Woods, could you take a look at this for me?\"\nAnything else\nWoods:\nI'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about that... *cough* *cough, cough*\nPhoenix:\nAck! Okay! Sorry to bother you! (I guess she doesn't have leads on that.)\nPhoenix:\nMs. Woods, could you take a look at this for me?\nWoods:\nOh, look! There's Thena's mom! The woman on the far right, the one in the kimono. That's Dr. Metis Cykes.\nPhoenix:\nAthena's mother's murder... ...did it by any chance have any connection to the HAT-1 launch?\nWoods:\nWhat? Why, yes... it did. As I recall, it happened on the day before the launch.\nPhoenix:\nJust as I suspected...\nCosmos:\nBut that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered!\nPhoenix:\n(So this is the murder Director Cosmos was talking about... Does that mean that the crime Prosecutor Blackquill was convicted of... ...is the murder of Athena's mother...?) There's a chance her death is somehow connected to the current case.\nWoods:\nTh-There is?\nPhoenix:\nThank you for all your help, Ms. Woods. And please, try not to worry. I won't let anything happen to Athena.\nWoods:\nThank you, Mr. Wright! I know you'll take good care of her.\nTrucy:\nSo we need to investigate the robotics lab, and also talk to Athena. We've got our plates full, Daddy. I hope we can fit it all in before the day is through...\nPhoenix:\nThe Detention Center first, then. We have to see Athena before visiting hours are over!\nDecember 20Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nFulbright:\nWell! If it isn't Mr. Lawyer! Fancy meeting you here!\nPhoenix:\nOh, hello, Detective Fulbright. Here on business?\nFulbright:\nTo tell the truth, I'm here to interview Ted Tonate!\nPhoenix:\nThe one behind the courtroom bombing incident?!\nFulbright:\nHe suddenly said he's ready to tell the truth about that case! And what he was saying was so incredible, I just had to come right over to hear more.\nTrucy:\nIncredible? What was he saying?\nFulbright:\nWhy don't you hang around and hear it for yourself?\nPhoenix:\n...Really? Us? Are you sure?\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! I give you my special permission! Here comes the bomber now!\nTonate:\nYOU! WHAT NERVE YOU HAVE TO COME HERE! YOU'RE HERE TO LAUGH AT ME, I SUPPOSE?!\nPhoenix:\n(Like I'd waste my breath on you. After all, you're the one who assaulted Apollo and put him in the hospital!)\nTonate:\nVIOLENCE -> NO QUESTION -> OK\nPhoenix:\n\"No violence\"?! Too bad Apollo didn't get a chance to say that before you attacked him!\nTonate:\nI... I...\nPhoenix:\nFine. Then just answer me this, Mr. Tonate. What is this \"truth\" of yours about the courtroom you blew up?\nTonate:\nNO! I DIDN'T DO IT! I DIDN'T BLOW UP THE COURTROOM! WHEN I KILLED DETECTIVE ARME, THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON IN THE ROOM!\nTrucy:\nWh... What are you talking about?! Who else could've been there?!\nTonate:\nI SAW IT, I TELL YOU! I SAW SOMEONE'S HAND AS THEY WERE STEALING THE REMOTE SWITCH! THIS PERSON WAS THERE AND WITNESSED THE MURDER I COMMITTED!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What?!\nTonate:\nI DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS... ...But that's who blew up the courtroom!\nTrucy:\nYou expect us to buy that?!\nPhoenix:\nEasy there, Trucy... I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess he must not be lying.\nTonate:\nPARDON ME. I GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY. BUT I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. I DID NOT DETONATE THAT BOMB.\nFulbright:\nAnd there you have it. We can't exactly ignore his claims, of course, so we're going a follow-up. We're even analyzing the bomb itself, or what's left of it! We haven't found any new facts yet, though.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. They've laid it all out, piece by piece...)\nTonate:\nOH, LOOK AT ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PIECES! I... I WISH I COULD HAVE THEM...\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh. Looks like his geek switch has been activated...)\nPhony Phanty Bomb added to the Court Record.\nFulbright:\nWell, I hope you're ready for Prosecutor Blackquill's special brand of questioning!\nTonate:\nAAAGH... ANYTHING BUT THAT...!\nFulbright:\nI'm afraid I have to be off now, too! I was just about to question Ms. Cykes.\nTrucy:\nYou're going to see Athena now?\nFulbright:\nThat's right... Oh, did you folks come to see her? Sorry for the trouble, but could you come back later? Well, off I go!\nPhoenix:\n(What bad timing... Looks like we'll have to wait until after her questioning is over to see her.)\nTrucy:\nAnd after we came all this way, too! Well, I guess it's back to the Space Center. Let's go check out the robotics lab, Daddy.\nPhoenix:\nAll right. Sounds like a plan.\nPresent\nPhony Phanty Bomb\nTrucy:\nHey! It's Phony Phanty!\nPhoenix:\nYou know this character?\nTrucy:\nYeah, it's the craze at my school, too.\nPhoenix:\n(I had no idea this thing was so popular.)\nTrucy:\nThere are two camps: the Bum Rap Rhiny fans, and the Phony Phanty fans. Which side are you on, Daddy?\nPhoenix:\nWell, as a lawyer, I'd like to avoid both of them if I can help it.\nEntrance\nPresent\nHAT-1 Exhibit\nCosmos:\nMankind's crowning achievement, the HAT-1 mission, will be in textbooks across the land!\nPhoenix:\nWow. That historic, huh?\nCosmos:\nMy achievements are grand enough to rival the very birth of space itself! My life will be a legend that will be told millions of years into the future! You may proceed to admire and praise me now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha... You certainly are an amazing piece of work.\nBoarding Lounge\nPresent\nHAT-1 Exhibit\nStarbuck:\nThe HAT-1 mission experienced one crisis after another. It was almost like space itself was rejecting our efforts. That's what it felt like, anyway.\nPhoenix:\nBut, in the end, the mission was a success.\nStarbuck:\nYeah. People call it a \"miracle\"... ...but I think it was us who made it work somehow, through sheer will and hope.\nPhoenix:\n(A miracle through sheer will, huh? I think I know what he means all too well...)\nSpace Museum\nPresent\nHAT-1 Exhibit\nPhoenix:\nMs. Woods, could you take a look at this for me?\nWoods:\nOh, look! There's Thena's mom! The woman on the far right, the one in the kimono. That's Dr. Metis Cykes.\nPhoenix:\nAthena's mother's murder... ...did it by any chance have any connection to the HAT-1 launch?\nWoods:\nWhat? Why, yes... it did. As I recall, it happened on the day before the launch.\nPhoenix:\nJust as I suspected...\nCosmos:\nBut that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered!\nPhoenix:\n(So this is the murder Director Cosmos was talking about... Does that mean that the crime Prosecutor Blackquill was convicted of... ...is the murder of Athena's mother...?) There's a chance her death is somehow connected to the current case.\nWoods:\nTh-There is?\nDecember 20Cosmos Space Center - Robotics Lab\nTrucy:\nSo this is the robotics lab, huh? Looks like it's exactly one floor above the boarding lounge.\nPhoenix:\n(...And where people were directed to evacuate from via the emergency ladder. This is where Athena's mother was killed seven years ago...) Speaking of someone who works with robots...\nTrucy:\nDaddy, look! Over there!\nApollo:\nSo they planned to use this bag to carry the capsule, is that right?\nAura:\nYeah, more or less. ...Say, why don't we stop talking about the case and have a nice cup of tea instead?\nPhoenix:\n(Apollo and Aura Blackquill? I wonder what they're talking about?)\nAura:\nWell, well. Come to spoil our fun? Just when I was enjoying our alone time...\nApollo:\nTrucy! And... Mr. Wright.\nAura:\nIf it's Apollo you want, you can't have him. He said he's investigating on his own.\nPhoenix:\nAnd I respect his wishes. We just came to investigate this lab.\nAura:\nWell, this is MY lab, so you'll need MY permission if you want to do any snooping.\nTalk\nAbout what happened\nAura:\nI heard about the trial. You made mincemeat out of the director. And suddenly Starbuck was out and your little subordinate, the princess, was in. Case closed. And they all lived happily ever after! Ha ha ha!\nTrucy:\nGrrrrr! Daddy, say something to her!\nAura:\nAnd I suppose you're going to defend the princess in court, am I right?\nPhoenix:\n(\"The princess,\" huh? Guess she's talking about Athena...) Of course! Athena is innocent.\nAura:\nOh, my. Such loyalty and trust! She seems pretty suspicious to me, though. The emotionally unstable princess. There's your culprit for you. Don't you agree, Apollo?\nApollo:\nI... I don't know yet.\nTrucy:\nApollo! How could you?!\nAura:\nWhat's wrong with saying \"I don't know\" if it's true? It's a very scientific approach. Your subordinate is more level-headed than you... Or should I say, \"former subordinate\"? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!\nApollo:\n............\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe it... Does Apollo really suspect Athena?!)\nAura:\n...Phew. All this laughing has worn me out. Your turn to say something, Hunk of Junk.\nClonco:\n............ Mr. Terran, you look pale. Shall I help you to the sickbay?\nPhoenix:\n\"Mr. Terran\"...? But that's Apollo you're talking to...\nAura:\nOh, this Hunk of Junk here is mistaking Apollo for Clay. Maybe Apollo is possessed by Clay's ghost.\nClonco:\nMr. Terran, how are you injuries? Mr. T-T-Terraaaaan... ...Mr. T-T-Terran, h-h-how are your injuries? Mr. T-T-Terraaaaaaaaaaaaaaan...\nAura:\nI guess Clay intends to hang around to haunt the princess that murdered him. Oh, and to haunt the lawyer that defends her, too, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(A robot that can see ghosts? Yeah, right! And I'M a spirit medium!) Sorry, but apparently, scientists just don't tell very frightening ghost stories. I intend to defend Athena, no matter what you have to say about it.\nAura:\nHow perfectly foolish! That kind of blind belief makes people lose sight of the truth. ...Just like seven years ago.\nSeven years ago (appears after \"About what happened\")\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about the incident seven years ago?\nAura:\nWhy? Do you enjoy trampling on people's feelings and rubbing salt in their wounds? Or do you just want me to talk? Hmm, in that case, what should I ask for in return...?\nApollo:\nI'd like to hear about that incident, too. It'd help me understand the current case better.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? Apollo knows about that case, too...?)\nAura:\nWell, if you're the one who's asking, Apollo... Come on, Hunk of Junk. You tell the story.\nClonco:\nBut Miss Aura, that's private information...\nAura:\nTsk! If you won't talk, I'll just have to make you talk!\nClonco:\nG...Gaaagh! ...Yes! Who cares about personal privacy?! Not me! I am ready to utilize my blast processing abilities to impart all available information!\nTrucy:\nWow, what a magic trick! He's like a completely different robot now!\nClonco:\nThe bodies of all the robots that come through this lab are designed by Miss Aura! I was born seven years ago! Miss Aura was much, much younger then!\nPhoenix:\n(Y-Yikes! Better watch what you say if you don't want to get recycled, Clonco!)\nClonco:\nAnd then our hearts were created by that great genius, Dr. Metis Cykes!\nPhoenix:\nHearts? Robots with hearts? Can you even make such a thing?\nClonco:\nEmotions are not irrational things! Our logic and our hearts can be integrated! The two Navigation Companions created by Miss Aura and Dr. Metis transcend humans! Gaaagh!\nAura:\nMetis...\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.)\nAura:\nNobody could continue Metis's research. She and her work were truly one of a kind. And now the two Navigation Companions are all that are left of Metis here on Earth...\nPhoenix:\n(The robots are all that's left? Isn't she leaving out a very important someone...?)\nAura:\nWe built the ultimate creations together, but now she's gone!\nApollo:\nI get the feeling Dr. Cykes loved her robots almost as much as she loved her daughter... ...and almost as much as she loved you.\nAura:\n...Ha ha ha ha ha! What are you talking about? Don't make me laugh! But you lost someone, too, didn't you, Apollo? Your friend Clay... I guess you and I are pretty much in the same boat. *sigh*\nClonco:\nMiss Aura, would you like a tissue?\nAura:\nKeep your trap shut, Hunk of Junk!\nClonco and Ponco (appears after \"Seven years ago\")\nTrucy:\nClonco is an important keepsake of your time with Dr. Cykes. You should treat him better!\nAura:\nWhat does it matter? He doesn't feel pain, and I can always repair his body. Besides, their hearts aren't actually in their bodies.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by that?\nAura:\nThe program Metis wrote runs on a separate mainframe. Their bodies are controlled remotely from there. Their hearts and memories are there, too. These bodies are really just peripherals. So I can do anything I want to them!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not so sure that gives you the right to physically abuse the poor things...)\nAura:\nBut why are you people looking into such an old case now, anyway?\nPhoenix:\nWell... we believe the culprit of that incident might be the same person as in this case.\nTrucy:\nSo Daddy's going to find out who killed Dr. Cykes, too! (Changed from [So Dadddy's [sic] going to find out who killed Dr. Cykes, too!] in the original release)\nAura:\n............ I'm sure you're aware of who Metis's killer is?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Prosecutor Blackquill... or so it seems.\nAura:\nThat's a quaint way of putting it. Are you implying you don't think he did it?\nPhoenix:\nI can't say anything for sure right now. But that's exactly why I'd like to hear your side of it, to help me be sure.\nDr. Cykes and Simon (appears after \"Clonco and Ponco\")\nLeads to:\n\"I was the one who introduced Simon to Metis, you know.\"\nPresent\nSpace Center Pamphlet\nAura:\nI actually don't have any interest in space. The only thing I'm interested in is robotics! I love robots!\nClonco:\nOh, Miss Aura! I didn't realize you felt that way about me! Gaaagh! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!\nAura:\nThe kind of robots I want to make aren't rusty pieces of scrap like you! I want to create giant robots! I've actually been working on a project for a while now.\nPhoenix:\n(I shudder to think what uses she might put giant robots to...)\nAura's Statement\nAura:\nI have nothing else to say to you.\nPhoenix:\n(Okay. Guess she has nothing else to say to me.)\nClonco:\nI apologize for Miss Aura.\nPhoenix:\nIt's all right, Clonco. There's nothing for you to apologize about.\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me anything about this piece of evidence?\nAura:\nEven if I could, I wouldn't tell a filthy lawyer like you.\nPhoenix:\nWhat a... pleasant response.\nAura:\nI was the one who introduced Simon to Metis, you know. He wanted to learn psychology, he said, to give himself an edge in court.\nPhoenix:\nAh, Prosecutor Blackquill's forte... his infamous \"power of suggestion\" technique.\nAura:\nExactly. And he was oddly serious about it. Rather than a teacher/student relationship... ...he treated her more like how a loyal samurai would treat his sovereign.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh. He seems more like a lost soul than a dignified samurai to me...)\nAura:\nHe even got along well with that miserable little princess.\nTrucy:\nWhy do you call Athena \"the princess,\" anyway?\nAura:\nWell, she is Metis's daughter, after all, although she's nothing like her. Besides... ...doesn't the selfish little princess always have lots of white knights hanging around?\nPhoenix:\n(Now I think I see why Athena didn't say anything when we ran into Aura yesterday. It all makes sense now.)\nAura:\nSo the culprit behind the two cases could be the same, huh...? That settles it, then.\nPhoenix:\nWhat does it settle?\nAura:\nNone of your business. Just forget you heard anything. How long are you people going to hand around in here, anyway?\nTrucy:\nWhat? But we came here to take a look around...\nAura:\nYou think you can just waltz in and ransack a person's lab? Show me a search warrant!\nPhoenix:\nUh, we're not the police, so we don't have one...\nAura:\nThen get out. Now! Clonco, show them out!\nClonco:\nC-Certainly, Miss Aura!\nTrucy:\nOuch! Don't push!\nClonco:\nMy apologies! I'm just following orders!\nPhoenix:\nAaaaagh...!\nDecember 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance\nPhoenix:\nWhat a way to get shown out...\nTrucy:\nThe nerve of that woman! What's with that horrible attitude?!\nPhoenix:\nI guess that's just how she is.\nTrucy:\nAnd why was Apollo going along with her?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it's because they have something in common... Apollo lost Clay, just like how Aura lost Dr. Cykes.)\nTrucy:\n*sigh*... I'm really worried about him. He's not himself at all. He's usually not all cool and dark and mysterious like that!\nPhoenix:\nI guess that's true... (Does she mean he's usually silly and dorky?)\nTrucy:\nI'm going to go keep an eye on him!\nPhoenix:\nHey, wait! Trucy! Come back! ............ (She's gone. Hmm... What should I do now? Detective Fulbright is probably still questioning Athena. Guess I'll go back to the office... alone. *sigh*)\nDecember 20Wright Anything Agency\nPhoenix:\n(Well, here I am...

And then, for a while after that, she was always by my side. (Changed from [And, after that, there was always someone by my side.] in the original release) Now I'm getting all sentimental.

Miss me?\" (I know this handwriting!)\nI read somewhere that you were holding a trial in the middle of an exploding courtroom? That must've really been something, although weird is par for the course with you.\nPhoenix:\n(I think she, or whatever paper she's reading is a little off on the details...)\nI'd love to come visit, but I'm right in the middle of a difficult part in my training.

But I wonder how this letter got here?\n???:\n...Um, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\nAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\n???:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nPhoenix:\nOh, it's you, Pearls!\nTalk\nPearls\nPearl:\nHow have you been, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThis is Pearl Fey, though I call her \"Pearls.\" She is Maya's cousin, who is also a spirit medium. A very talented one, at that. I've known her since she was eight years old. But Apollo and Athena only met her a few months ago.\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't come all this way just to bring me a letter, did you?\nPearl:\nI apologize for barging in. The door was unlocked... But I can't believe there was a big explosion here! Your office doesn't look any different.\nPhoenix:\n(She's even further off on the details than Maya.) I wish I could take you out to eat or something, Pearls, but there's a lot going on...\nPearl:\nOh, I knew that! I didn't come here for a social visit, you know, Mr. Nick!\nPearls's errand (appears after \"Pearls\")\nPearl:\nDid you read the postscript on the letter?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? There's more? ...Oh, yeah. Here it is. \"P.S.\"\nI bet you've been too busy to clean or take care of the office. So Pearly said she would come help you! Isn't she sweet? You'd better thank her!\nPhoenix:\nOh, so that's what you're doing here. That's awfully nice of you, Pearls. (Maya and Pearls. Thanks to these two... ...I'm starting to feel a little better. Thank you, girls.)\nPearl:\nNow that I'm here, I'm going to whip this place into shape! You just concentrate on your work and don't mind me at all!\nPhoenix:\n(I'll need to talk to Prosecutor Blackquill if I want to learn more about his case. With the trial still going on, they must be holding him down at the Detention Center.)\nWhat to do (appears after \"Pearls's errand\")\nPearl:\nHas it been a while since you've seen Mystic Maya?\nPhoenix:\nYes, quite a while. She used to drop by the office sometimes to say hello... ...but she hasn't been by recently. I wonder what she's up to these days?\nPearl:\nTo become a spirit medium worthy of heading the Fey clan, she undergoes rigorous training. But she says she's growing really tired of the vegetarian diet!\nPhoenix:\nI'll have to have some burgers delivered to her, then.\nPearl:\nOh! I'm sure she would love that! But to get where she is, the delivery person would have to climb a steep mountain.\nPhoenix:\n............I hope she tips them well, then.\nAny ideas? (appears after \"Pearls's errand\")\nPearl:\nYour hair is nice and spiky today, as always, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nThanks. I generally try to look good if I'm going to be in court.\nPearl:\nDo you make it spiky so that the prosecution will feel intimidated?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? No, that's not exactly my intention...\nPearl:\nYour hairstyle is to make you look bigger and stronger, just like a rooster's comb, right? That's what Mystic Maya says, anyway.\nPhoenix:\nShe couldn't compare it to something cool, like a lion's mane?\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nHee hee. When I see you wearing your attorney's badge like that... ...it brings back such memories.\nPhoenix:\nI remember you helping me conduct my investigations from time to time.\nPearl:\nI'm glad I can help again!\nPhoenix:\nThanks. You always provide such great assistance.\nPearl:\nI'll do my best to live up to Mystic Maya's standard!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know what I'd do if Pearls wasn't here right now.)\nSpace Center Pamphlet\nPearl:\nIs that a pamphlet? I just love to look at pamphlets!\nPhoenix:\nI bet you find vacation pamphlets especially exciting, huh?\nPearl:\nYes, because I don't get a chance to leave the village much, what with my training. So looking at pamphlets is kind of like a hobby.\nPhoenix:\nWell, the office is just full of them. You can have as many of them as you'd like.\nPearl:\nOh, boy! Thank you!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor kid. I wish I could take her on a real vacation.)\nPhony Phanty Bomb\nPearl:\nHee hee! What a cute little elephant.\nPhoenix:\nIt used to have a bomb in it, you know.\nPearl:\nOh, my! A bomb in its stomach?\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. It must've been starving, huh? You'd have to be pretty hungry to want to eat a bomb.\nPearl:\nAnd there must not have been anything else around to eat. ...You have to be careful never to eat anything strange yourself, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. I promise. (She looks genuinely worried for me.)\nAnything else\nPearl:\nI'm sorry. I want to be of help... ...but I'm still in training, and... ...nothing about that is coming to mind, I'm afraid. I'm really, deeply sorry.\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no. It's okay. I shouldn't have shown you something so trivial anyway. (I feel like we've had this conversation before...)\nAfter clearing \"Pearls's errand\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency:\nDecember 20Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(Well, look who's here... I wonder what they're talking about?)\n???:\nAll this time and you haven't said a word. It's even turning your hair gray!\nBlackquill:\nI don't have anything to say, Aura. Why don't you go home and play with your dolls?\nPhoenix:\n(Prosecutor Blackquill!)\nAura:\nWell, even if you don't, I have plenty, you jerk!\nFulbright:\nM-Ms. Blackquill, don't you think that's enough for today?\nAura:\n\"Enough for today\"?! Today is all there is when there's no tomorrow!\nPhoenix:\n(\"When there's no tomorrow\"? What is she talking about?)\nBlackquill:\nWe have company, Aura. Please try to calm down.\nAura:\nAll right, fine. I see you're just not going to listen, no matter what I say. I've had it. If that's the way you're going to be, I have another plan up my sleeve. I hope you're happy, Simon, because I'm done! Do as you please! See if I care!\nFulbright:\nUgh...\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... I could cut the tension with a katana...)\nBlackquill:\nWright-dono. It looks like Fool Bright saved your case in court this morning.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? ...Oh. Yeah, he did. (You bounced back to business quick!)\nFulbright:\nP-Prosecutor Blackquill, forgive me! But it was the just thing to do!\nBlackquill:\nBut, as a result, Cykes-dono was arrested. Was that the just thing to do, too?\nFulbright:\nMr. Lawyer, I'm sorry! But it was evidence. What else could I do?\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry about it. I plan to defend her and prove her innocence.\nBlackquill:\nI wouldn't take things so lightly, if I were you, Wright-dono!\nPhoenix:\n(...Th-This is bladeproof glass, right...?)\nTalk\nSeven years ago\nLeads to:\n\"Prosecutor Blackquill, we're looking into the case from seven years ago.\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nBlackquill:\n...How can you call yourself a lawyer if you can't even protect your own subordinate?\nPhoenix:\nUngh... I swear I'll get her acquitted! You'll see!\nBlackquill:\nYour mind must be as dense as the hair on your head. Do you really think it will be so easy?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm more than aware of how hard it's going to be, thank you very much!)\nAnything else\nBlackquill:\n............\nPhoenix:\n............So............ what do you think?\nBlackquill:\n............\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like it wasn't important enough to warrant even a contemptuous \"Hmph\"...)\nPhoenix:\nProsecutor Blackquill, we're looking into the case from seven years ago. You're looking for somebody you call \"the phantom of seven years past,\" aren't you?\nBlackquill:\nYou villain! Where did you hear about that?!\nPhoenix:\n(...Th-This glass is absolutely, positively bladeproof... right...?)\nFulbright:\nNo! It wasn't me! I didn't say a single w-- ...Oops.\nPhoenix:\nOuch. (At least it wasn't my fault!)\nBlackquill:\n............\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me who this \"phantom\" is? And also, you didn't really kill Dr. Cykes, did you...?\nBlackquill:\nGuard! The guest is leaving!\nPhoenix:\nProsecutor Blackquill! Please listen to me! The culprit in the current case might be the same as the one in the case seven years ago! If you would cooperate, we could probably solve both cases!\nBlackquill:\n............Hmph. I suppose I could talk. The one who killed my mentor was, without question, me. I stole Cykes-dono's mother away from her. I destroyed her life!\nPhoenix:\n(Prosecutor Blackquill...)\nBlackquill:\nGuard! Where are you? Stop dragging your feet, I tell you!\nPhoenix:\n............There he goes.\nFulbright:\nNoooooooooooooooooooooo! We've upset Prosecutor Blackquill! Now what are we going to do, Mr. Lawyer?!\nPhoenix:\n(There isn't much we CAN do...) ...Detective Fulbright? Do you mind if I ask you just a little more about that old case?\nFulbright:\nWell, I guess it won't make any difference now... What would you like to know?\nTalk\nThe trial seven years ago\nPhoenix:\nDo you know anything about the trial that got him convicted?\nFulbright:\nA little. The police call the incident the UR-1 Incident. Prosecutor Blackquill was charged with murdering his psychology mentor. ...Kind of like if your red Mr. Lawyer were to kill you.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to think about that one.)\nFulbright:\nThere were two decisive pieces of evidence, so a verdict was reached very quickly.\nPhoenix:\nTwo pieces of evidence, huh. What were they?\nFulbright:\nLet's see! The first was some security camera footage. He was the only one who used the corridor to the murder scene at the time of the crime.\nPhoenix:\nThe only one, huh? (Ouch. That does sound pretty decisive...) Could you show me that footage?\nFulbright:\nOh, sorry. I don't have it with me right now.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I'll have to see it some other time.)\nSeven-Year-Old Video added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was the second piece of evidence?\nFulbright:\nThis one's even more incriminating. A photo of the moment of the crime. See? There he is at the crime scene, holding a bloody katana. It was the victim's, kept on display in the room. She had a thing for Japanese culture.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wow... (It'd be hard to explain this one away...)\nKatana added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nBut who took this picture, Detective?\nFulbright:\nThe incident happened the day before the HAT-1 launch. A reporter who had come to do a story on the launch was in the room across from the lab. This just happened to show up in one of the pictures he took.\nPhoto of the Crime added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(Prosecutor Blackquill's attitude earlier was so odd... He's definitely hiding something.) Prosecutor Blackquill said he was hunting a phantom from seven years ago, didn't he?\nFulbright:\nYes. And I imagine it's getting more and more urgent as his execution date approaches.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What did you just say? Execution date...?\nFulbright:\nWhat? Did I say something?! Never mind me! You didn't hear a thing!\nThe trial seven years ago (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDo you know anything about the trial that got him convicted?\nFulbright:\nA little.

I'll be sure to take care of it!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no! this is an important piece of evidence!\nPhoenix:\nSo he was given... the death sentence...\nFulbright:\nYes. He told me not to tell you people, actually... ...but I guess there's no sense hiding it anymore. His execution date is tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! Tomorrow?! (No...)\nFulbright:\nM-Ms. Blackquill, don't you think that's enough for today?\nAura:\n\"Enough for today\"?!

Prosecutor Blackquill would be executed tomorrow under a false charge.\nPhoenix:\nBut that would be unthinkable! We have to do something... right now!\nFulbright:\nNnnnngh! I want to do something... I want to, but... You're a lawyer! You know how hard it is to overturn a decision!\nPhoenix:\nI know! But why?! Why isn't Prosecutor Blackquill putting up any kind of a fight?\nFulbright:\nYou saw how he was, right? He's been like that ever since his conviction. Totally uncooperative. Not even his own sister could persuade him!\nPhoenix:\n(Uncooperative... when he's about to be executed for a crime he didn't commit?! This isn't right...! I can't let it happen! I have to stop it somehow!)\nFulbright:\n...Oh, pardon me! Looks like I have a phone call. Fulbright here. What? What's happening?! YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!\nPhoenix:\n(That's quite a reaction. I bet he's making some big show of it right now.)\nFulbright:\nM-M-Mr. Lawyer! The robots...! The robots are...!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Fulbright, get a hold of yourself. Some kind of robot malfunction?\nFulbright:\nNot a malfunction. They're staging a revolt! The machines are rebelling against humans!

This is going to be one heck of a battle!\nDecember 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance\nPhoenix:\n(The riot police are here. Then, the robots really are holding people hostage?!)\nFulbright:\nHm? Look, Mr. Lawyer! What do you suppose that group of people are swarmed around?!\nClonco:\nBut I was only trying to help this nice person! She said she was lost...\nMan:\nYou robots have declared war on us humans! You've even taken hostages already!\nWoman:\nStay away from it!

I know I have absolutely no right to make such a ridiculous request, but...\nPhoenix:\nBut you need me to buy some time, right? Got it. I'll see what I can do. But promise me...

Ms. Hostage-Taker, Athena is not a murderer.\n???:\nWhat are you talking about? She's been arrested and they've got her in detention!\nPhoenix:\nI'm telling you the truth. Look, the person you want is the real killer, right? Well, it's NOT Athena. It's someone else.\n???:\nAll right, let's hear your stupid little theory. Who is this \"real killer\"?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet. But the culprit is the same as the one in the case from seven years ago. The UR-1 Incident... I believe you have a personal interest in that case?\n???:\nHmph. It's too late to change what's going to happen now, no matter how wrong it is...\nPhoenix:\nBut is it really too late? You can still do something about it. You might even be able to fix it...\n???:\nJust... what exactly are you proposing?\nPhoenix:\n(What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?)\nRecreate it\nPhoenix:\nHow about we do a reenactment of the case?\n???:\nSo you DO enjoy trampling on people's feelings and rubbing salt in their wounds.

I have to come up with something I can bargain with.)\nLeads back to:\n\"What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?\"\nPhoenix:\nI propose we retry the case from seven years ago.

But more importantly... an important guest has arrived.\nPhoenix:\nA-A guest?\nAnime cutscene\nEdgeworth:\nI trust you've been well, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth! What are you doing here...? (This is Miles Edgeworth. We've been friends since we were kids. We faced off in court a number of times back when he was a prosecutor, but now...)\nPearl:\nHello, Prosecutor Edgeworth... Oh! But you're not a \"Prosecutor\" anymore, are you? Um...\nPhoenix:\nHe's chief prosecutor now. Pretty soon, it'll be a year, right?\nEdgeworth:\nA title is nothing more than a title. Don't we have more pressing issues to discuss?\nTalk\nMiles Edgeworth\nPhoenix:\nSo what are you doing here, Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThe captor chose me as the prosecutor for the UR-1 case.\nPhoenix:\nWow, she's good. She went all the way up to the top!\nEdgeworth:\nI gathered all the information I could in the short time that I had. I'll give you a run-down.\nPearl:\nYou're always so well prepared, Prosecutor Edgeworth!\nPhoenix:\nThanks. I appreciate this. I could really use the help.\nThe UR-1 Incident (appears after \"Miles Edgeworth\")\nEdgeworth:\nI'll start with a brief overview. The victim was the psychologist Dr. Metis Cykes.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, Athena's mother.\nEdgeworth:\nSeven years ago, on the 7th of October, her body was found here in this very room. I have two crime photos and the police notes on them for you to see.\nPearl:\n*gasp* What a terrible way to die...\nPhoenix:\nThis other photo shows the other side of the room, I see.\nSeven-Year-Old Photos added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nI also have the autopsy report for you.\nMetis's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nThe murder weapon was the victim's own katana found at the scene.\nPhoenix:\n(Yes, Detective Fulbright mentioned she was into Japanese culture...)\nEdgeworth:\nThe body was found by a Space Center staff member and two police officers. The police were called in because of the sabotage threat on the HAT-1 launch.\nPhoenix:\n(Yes, Director Cosmos mentioned this, too.)\nEdgeworth:\nA few hours after the body was discovered, a suspect was arrested. The suspect was Simon Blackquill, a young prosecutor.\nThe UR-1 Incident (subsequent times)\nEdgeworth:\nI'll start with a brief overview.

The suspect was Simon Blackquill, a young prosecutor.\nSimon Blackquill (appears after \"The UR-1 Incident\")\nPhoenix:\nI heard his trial was over in a flash.\nEdgeworth:\nYes. A guilty verdict was declared in only one session. Not only did he plead guilty, but there was decisive evidence against him, too.\nPhoenix:\nThe security camera video... ...and a photo of the moment of the crime, as I recall.\nPearl:\nBut did Prosecutor Blackquill have a motive?\nEdgeworth:\nMmm. To this day, his motive is still unknown. He insisted he did it, but he would never say why.\nPhoenix:\nSo that means... he must still be hiding something.\nEdgeworth:\nRight. And there's another aspect of the case that was never revealed to the public.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know. The part about the spy, right?\nEdgeworth:\nWright! How on earth do you know about that?!\nPhoenix:\nDirector Cosmos told me, after a bit of pressure. He told me espionage and sabotage were behind The Hat-1 [sic] Miracle.\nPearl:\nDon't worry! I won't tell anyone! I've always been good at keeping secrets!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I might as well tell you now. They really do suspect Blackquill of being a spy. They think he sabotaged the rocket and killed Dr. Cykes to steal the moon rock. But if you can prove that the HAT-2 bombing is the work of the same spy...\nPhoenix:\nWe can stay the execution...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a possibility. That's why I intend to help you any way I can.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Edgeworth. Now all I have to do is comb this room for evidence.\nPearl:\nLet's do it together!\nSimon Blackquill (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nI heard his trial was over in a flash.\nEdgeworth:\nYes.

It's been eight years. I'm sorry for all I put you through.\nEdgeworth:\nNo... I'm sorry I wasn't able to help you.\nPhoenix:\nNah. I was the one that made the decision.\nEdgeworth:\nBut now you can stand in court once again. And you can mow them down just like you used to.\nPhoenix:\n(W-Way to put pressure on a guy. And since when did I get such a brutal reputation?)\nTerran's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife\nEdgeworth:\nAnother young life lost to the hands of a cruel killer.\nPhoenix:\n...Edgeworth, you don't think Athena's the culprit, do you?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. That's up to the evidence, and the truth they reveal, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about the hostage situation?\nEdgeworth:\nThe law will deal with the hostage-taker. Remember, we must never stoop to threats or acts of violence ourselves. Even if people's lives are on the line.\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth... (He may be a stickler for the rule of law, but I have no better ally in this world than him.)\nSpace Center Pamphlet or \"Hope\" Capsule\nEdgeworth:\nThe Hope capsule samples, brought back from some distant asteroid... Risking his own safety, the victim brought them with him from the launch pad.\nPhoenix:\nThey must've been very valuable.\nEdgeworth:\nYes. All nations are itching to get their hands on such materials. Wright, this case may turn out to be more than just a murder case, you know.\nPhoenix:\n...That's fine. Come what may, my top priority is to defend my clients.\nAnything else\nEdgeworth:\nWright... Please stop presenting random evidence just to see how that person will react.\nPhoenix:\nBut, that's the thing. I need to see how people will react in order to question them.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what if it's evidence that person isn't privy to?\nPhoenix:\nAha ha ha! That doesn't happen... much...\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. You never change. And I'm afraid I'll never understand your assortment of oddball clients either.\nExamine (after clearing \"Simon Blackquill\" Talk option)\nRobot on desk\nPhoenix:\nOh, look. It's a little robot. I wonder what it does? Cleaning, maybe?\nA cleaning robot must follow a human's orders, as long as it causes no human harm.\nPhoenix:\nYikes! It talks!\nA cleaning robot must keep desks clean without violating the preceding clause. However, Miss Aura says she prefers a moderate leave of clutter on the desk... Oh, what is the purpose of my existence?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess \"slack off\" and \"cut some corners\" aren't in his vocabulary bank.)\nDesk on left\nPhoenix:\nAura's desk is a mess, though that doesn't surprise me.\nPearl:\nOoh, I just want to dive in and straighten it up!\nPhoenix:\n...Wait, before you do...\nAura:\nMetis...\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.)\nPhoenix:\n(It's... Metis Cykes...) Clonco, can I talk to you? (I really hope he's back to normal.)\nClonco:\nYou wish to speak to me, Mr. Wright? If you're going to hit me, please avoid the face area.\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, don't put me in the same class as that woman!) What was Aura like seven years ago at the time of the incident?\nClonco:\nWhen Mother died, Miss Aura was... confused.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh. So he calls Dr. Cykes \"Mother,\" but Aura Blackquill \"Miss Aura\"...?)\nClonco:\nWith the loss, she exhibited a severe catecholamine imbalance.\nPearl:\nExcuse me, but I have no idea what that means.\nClonco:\nPardon me. Searching for alternative expression... She would spend the nights crying, and then take out her feelings on those around her.\nEdgeworth:\nAfter Prosecutor Blackquill was found guilty, she repeatedly demanded a retrial as well.\nClonco:\nThat is correct. But without new evidence, her requests were ignored. And then, little by little, Miss Aura began to change. She started to hate it when I called her \"Mama Aura.\"\nPhoenix:\n(And before long, she started hating the court system, and abusing Clonco, huh...?)\nPearl:\nThat murder destroyed so many lives...\nEdgeworth:\nWright, take a look at this paper on Dr. Cykes and Ms. Blackquill's research.\nPhoenix:\n(Ponco and Clonco. They're the \"robots with hearts\" that Dr. Cykes created.) A heartbeat detection system lets them determine when a human is present. In addition, they can recognize people by their ID tag or facial features... ...and they can infer people's emotions by analyzing their tone of voice. That's amazing. Hey, I don't know, Edgeworth. They might even be more human than you.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What's that supposed to mean?\nPhoenix:\n(It kind of sounds like these robots can do what Athena does...)\nRobots with a Heart added to the Court Record.\nDesk on left (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nAura's desk is a mess, though that doesn't surprise me.\nPearl:\nOoh, I just want to dive in and straighten it up!\nPhoenix:\n...Wait, before you do...\nAura:\nMetis...\nPhoenix:\n(Huh?

It's in the photo, too.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it was here then as well, with the victim's body lying on it.\nPearl:\nThere's a button here... Oh! I know! I'll try pushing it!\nPhoenix:\nPearls! Don't touch th--\nPearl:\n...Oopsie.\nPhoenix:\nHey! It's moving!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... It appears to be a robot-assembly device.\nPearl:\n\"Disassemble anything in a flash! Push the 'Dismantle' button!\" That sounds pretty neat! Can I push it, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't push any more buttons, Pearls.\nOperating table (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like... an operating table.

This must be the one they used during the evacuation.\nAura:\nThe explosion disabled the elevators. So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to.\nEdgeworth:\nAs Ms. Blackquill was climbing down the side of the building, she saw the culprit inside.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder which would've been scarier: that, or looking down...?)\nEmergency Ladder added to the Court Record.\nEmergency ladder (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nAn emergency ladder.

I bet the wheels make it easier for people to move heavy research materials around.\nPearl:\nI bet they'd be fun to ride around in. We could even probably both fit into the biggest one! I know! We could have Prosecutor Edgeworth push us!\nPhoenix:\nI don't trust him not to push us down a flight of stairs...\nUnfinished robot arm\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? A giant robot arm, maybe?\nPearl:\nIt's pretty big for an arm, but you're right! I think these thin parts here are finger bones! They're even about as long as my legs!\nPhoenix:\nAnd there's a spiked ball and giant drill on the floor, too... Is Aura trying to build some kind of weapon of massive destruction?\nPearl:\nMaybe she wants to use it to demolish a big building or something?\nPhoenix:\n(I can picture her gleefully tearing down the street doing just that... I'd better not think about it anymore.)\nCharging station\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? It looks like a giant power plug.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... It's attached to what looks like an electric vehicle charging station...\nClonco:\nThat's a charging station for us robots. We come here periodically and charge ourselves up.\nPhoenix:\nWow. Machines that maintain themselves. That's pretty cool.\nClonco:\nIf out batteries run out and we lose consciousness... ...we never know what Miss Aura will do to us while we're down, you see.\nPhoenix:\n(Nothing motivates quite like fear, huh?)\n\"JT-02\" robot or spiked ball\nPhoenix:\nThis is one heck of a robot.\nPearl:\nThere's something written on it... Is this supposed to be a poem? \"I cut down anyone who displeases me. I make the rules. I am the law. I wield the ultimate gavel of judgment. I am Judgetron (JT-02)!\"\nEdgeworth:\nI don't believe we need to bother with that, Pearl. It's not even completed yet.\nPhoenix:\nHe's right, Pearls. There's no sign of it in the photo from seven years ago, either.\nEdgeworth:\nThey were building the Hope space probe here at the time. The murder occurred after the space probe had been removed from the room.\nPhoenix:\n(So it was long gone by the time someone took this picture, huh.)\nPearl:\nBut you can see the probe in this newspaper photo.\nEdgeworth:\nYes. And you can see the stolen moon rock there, too.\nPhoenix:\n(That strange black and yellow thing on the left side of the picture?)\nEdgeworth:\nNote that the same rock is absent from the crime scene photo.\nCosmos:\nNot only that, but before the launch, a very valuable piece of moon rock was stolen.\nAthena:\nI hear there's lots of research into moon rocks and star dust from asteroids these days. They say the results could potentially have a huge impact on all of civilization! It's like we're in a new space race with every other country out there.\nPhoenix:\nSo the person who stole it... Think it was our spy?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sure of it. Dr. Cykes was probably killed because she was a roadblock in their plan. Unfortunately, the government thinks Prosecutor Blackquill is the culprit...\n\"JT-02\" robot or spiked ball (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt takes someone like Aura Blackquill to actually build something like this...\nPearl:\nOh, there's more to the poem! \"Guilty or not, it doesn't matter. I burn the law books for my fuel. My laser of judgment pierces your soul. I am Judgetron (JT-02)!\"\nEdgeworth:\nWe've heard enough of that, I believe.\nPearl:\nAww... Are you sure you don't want to hear the third stanza...?\nDesk on right\nPhoenix:\nIt's about as cluttered as my office, but I think it's a workbench.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, I think this must be a kitchen. Look at this photo. See the cute little food processor?\nEdgeworth:\nThat isn't a food processor, Pearls. That's the Hope capsule. It was scheduled to be loaded onto the Hope space probe that fateful day. The three people who came to collect the capsule discovered the body.\nPhoenix:\nThe first on the scene, huh? A staff member and two police officers, was it? (And they were here to collect the capsule... Which reminds me...)\nApollo:\nSo they planned to use this bag to carry the capsule, is that right?\nAura:\nYeah, more or less. ...Say, why don't we stop talking about the case and have a nice cup of tea instead?\nPhoenix:\n(Apollo and Aura Blackquill? I wonder what they're talking about?)\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth, did those three people have a bag with them for transporting the capsule?\nEdgeworth:\nOh, you mean this? It's a custom-made, shock-resistant bag. But how did you know?\nPhoenix:\nOh, I just overheard Apollo making an inquiry about it, that's all.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... So he's looking into the case from seven years ago on his own, is he?\n\"Hope\" Capsule updated in the Court Record.\nDesk on right (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt's about as cluttered as my office, but I think it's a workbench.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, I think this must be a kitchen.

Any ideas?\nPhoenix:\nThere are still a lot of gaps in the evidence, but I'll pull it off somehow! After all... ...you asked me to prove Blackquill's innocence, right, Edgeworth?\nPearl:\nWhat?! He did?!\nPhoenix:\nYup. He called it a \"special request.\" He reached out to me while I was still disbarred.\nTalk\nEdgeworth's request\nPearl:\nSo that was what sparked you to get your attorney's badge back?\nPhoenix:\n...Yup, the Blackquill case.\nEdgeworth:\nWright, I have a special request. ...I want you to clear one of my subordinates of suspicion.\nPhoenix:\nHey, I'm not even a lawyer anymore, remember? Haven't been one for a long time.\nEdgeworth:\nThat eight-year misunderstanding has been cleared up, and you must be eager to return. I'm sure you're familiar with the other case that ushered in the \"dark age of the law\"?\nPhoenix:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nVery soon, a convict will stand as a prosecutor in court. I want you to keep an eye on him.\nPhoenix:\nAww, just when I'm beginning to actually like the job I have now...\nEdgeworth:\nWright... I'm sorry I dragged you into this... Because of the espionage aspect, I wasn't free to give you all the details...\nPhoenix:\nHey, no need to apologize. It's like I said on the phone the other day... ...I know that the type of criminals you're after now aren't small fries anymore.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like your target finally decided to make a move. Yeah... It's for this very reason I returned. Time to bring it to an end.\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to end the dark age of the law. That's what this is all about.\nThe dark age of the law (appears after \"Edgeworth's request\")\nLeads to:\n\"\"The dark age of the law\"... It sure comes up a lot these days on TV and in the papers.\"\nPearl:\n\"The dark age of the law\"... It sure comes up a lot these days on TV and in the papers. And I hear there are more false charges and fabrication of evidence than ever.\nEdgeworth:\nWhen I became chief prosecutor, the court system had already lost the people's trust. It all began eight years ago. A lawyer was caught fabricating evidence... And a year after that, a prosecutor was found guilty of murder.\nPearl:\nWait! D-Do you mean...?!\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. He's talking about my case and Prosecutor Blackquill's.\nEdgeworth:\nIt was a downward spiral after that, an absolute nightmare. After those two cases, the mass media launched an all-out attack on the courts. Public opinion was tainted, and, before long, the legal world itself was sucked into it.\nPhoenix:\nIt's such a shame... Once suspicion forms, it's very hard to shake. Lawyers and prosecutors were supposed to trust each other -- pursue the truth together.\nPearl:\nIt's so sad when people begin to cast doubt. They start lying to themselves and each other.\nPhoenix:\nYes, and do absolutely anything to win. We're in an age now where winning is valued far more than the truth. I'm sure it's caused our new chief prosecutor to lose many a night's rest. (Is it just me or did his brow get even more furrowed than the last time I saw him...?)\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. The hostage-taker's disdain for the courts is a perfect example of the times.\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* It sure is.\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any idea who the hostage-taker might be?\nPhoenix:\nWell, somebody who mistrusts the court system and can manipulate robots... ...It can really only be Aura Blackquill. Who else but her would want a retrial of that case from seven years ago so badly?\nEdgeworth:\nSimon Blackquill's older sister and the owner of this room... I agree with your conclusion. Perhaps she intended to force Ms. Cykes to confess...\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, I think she had a much more horrific plan in mind for Athena...)\nEdgeworth:\nThe important thing is for you to solve UR-1 and prove Blackquill's innocence.\nPearl:\nAnd then maybe she'll release the hostages!\nEdgeworth:\nI'm counting on you, Wright, to set that prosecutor and those hostages free.\nPhoenix:\nAnd I'll be counting on you in court to help me, too.\nEdgeworth:\nOf course. I'll do everything I can to help uncover the truth. As this isn't an official trial, I'm more at liberty to be a little unorthodox.\nClonco:\nMr. Wright, are you finished with your investigation?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but I'd like you to tell the hostage-taker something for me. I have to go to the Detention Center. I can't start the trial until I've talked to Athena.\nClonco:\nShe's already given her consent. I'll accompany you to the detention center.\nPhoenix:\n(So I'm still being watched, huh?) I'll see you in court, Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Even if it will be an undocumented trial, it'll be good to face you in court again.\nDecember 20Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(She was right by my side only a few short hours ago... ...but I feel like I haven't seen her in ages...)\nOh! Mr. Wright!\nAthena:\nAnd Pearly, too! I knew you would come. After all, the first step is the interview with the defendant.\nPhoenix:\nAnd because you're my friend and I was worried about you.\nAthena:\nHeh heh. Thanks, Boss.\nPhoenix:\nI'm not the only one who's worried, either.\nAthena:\nReally? Who else?\nPhoenix:\nI saw Ms. Woods today. She was so beside herself, she came to find me. She told me you used to live in the Cosmos Space Center. No wonder you knew so much about the place!\nAthena:\nOh... So you know, huh? I... I'm sorry I didn't tell you.\nPhoenix:\nThat's all right. But... there are some other things I'd like to ask you.\nAthena:\nSure, you can ask me anything. I promise I won't keep any more secrets from you!\nTalk\nThe day of the crime\nPhoenix:\nTell me about the day Clay was murdered.\nAthena:\nI... I was actually at the Space Center that day. In... In the Space Museum...\nPhoenix:\n(Right where the culprit fled to?! That's not good...)\nAthena:\nI never could fully deal with what happened seven years ago... But when I saw the Center again during the news coverage of the HAT-2 launch... ...I thought maybe if I went there, things would be different this time...\nPearl:\nThat must've taken a lot of courage, to face your past like that...\nAthena:\nSo I went to the Space Museum the evening before the explosions. This was before the launch pads had been switched... There was sign that said \"closed for repairs,\" and they weren't letting anybody in.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, the director couldn't very well switch the pads if there were people in there...\nAthena:\nBut I snuck in anyway.\nPhoenix:\nDid you want to see that HAT-1 group photo, the one with your mother in it?\nAthena:\nI did... but what I really wanted to see was her jacket.\nPhoenix:\n(That jacket on display... That was Dr. Cykes's...?)\nHAT-1 Exhibit updated in the Court Record.\nAthena:\nBut I should've known it wouldn't be easy to get over such a traumatic experience... The second I saw that jacket, it all came rushing back to me. Everything around me went hazy and I couldn't see... ...I tried to get out of there somehow... But I guess I passed out. When I came to, I was in the passage behind the rocket. I was in the shadows, where people couldn't really see me.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you got confused and went the wrong way when you were trying to leave?\nPearl:\nHow long do you think you were unconscious, Athena?\nAthena:\nI was out until about noon of the next day. I didn't even know about the explosions. When I woke up, nobody was around, so I just went out into Boarding Lounge 2. My mind must've still been fuzzy, because my memory is vague after that. I don't remember how I got home.\nPhoenix:\nNo memory, huh...? (This is gonna be tough...)\nAthena:\nWhich means... What if I'm the one who killed Clay...?!\nPhoenix:\nI think that's enough of that, Athena. Let's talk about something else. (So, during the entire incident, she was unconscious in the Space Museum... Of course I believe her... ...but will anybody else...?)\nThe day of the crime (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nTell me about the day Clay was murdered.\nAthena:\nI...

Of course I believe her... ...but will anybody else...?)\nYour mother's work (appears after \"The day of the crime\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of research was Dr. Cykes... your mother... doing?\nAthena:\nMachines that could tell people's emotions by their tone of voice... and my special ability. Someday, when people travel to distant planets, their companions will be robots. So she said they had to be able to understand how their human companions felt.\nPearl:\nWow! Robots that can understand people!\nAthena:\nI was just a convenient subject for her research. All she ever did was work, and she never paid any attention to me. ...Oh, sorry about that, dredging up all that old stuff...\nPhoenix:\nNo need to apologize. (I guess her home life was... complicated...) Oh, by the way. Ms. Woods said something about you always wearing headphones...?\nWoods:\nShe always wore these big, heavy-looking headphones. She said her mother made them for her, as part of her research.\nAthena:\nI had to wear them every time I went out. Oh, I hated them so much! But she wouldn't listen...\nPearl:\nWhat were they for?\nAthena:\nOh, she gave me some kind of explanation... ...but I don't remember now. It was too difficult for a little kid to understand.\nPhoenix:\nOkay... But let me say this one thing. I don't think your mother only thought of you as some handy subject for her research.\nAthena:\nI... I want to believe that. But just about the only things my mother left me with are Widget... ...and this earring.\nPearl:\nOoh! It's beautiful!\nAthena:\nIt's made of a piece of real moon rock she had for research. Maybe she did love me, in her own way...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure of it. I'm really sure she did. (Because that's what I want to believe, too.)\nMoon Rock Earring added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(I'd better ask her a little more about her mother's research.

Did you hear about the person holding up the Space Center?\nAthena:\nYes, a little. And this person has even taken hostages?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I'd better spare her the news about Trucy...) Well... ...after some negotiating, we agreed to do a retrial of the case from seven years ago.\nAthena:\nWhat? You're kidding me! So that means... Prosecutor Blackquill might...?!\nPhoenix:\nYup. I know he's innocent. I just have to prove it. So, wait. Did you know him back then?\nAthena:\nYes. He used to come visit my mom a lot. He studied psychology under her, and would sometimes ask for advice on his legal cases. He was very kind and considerate, and straight as an arrow.\nPhoenix:\n(Unlike now, where he's more twisted than a basket of snakes...)\nAthena:\nThat's why I took the witness stand during his trial seven years ago.\n\"Please! You have to listen to me!\"\nAthena:\n\"He didn't kill her! His heart is screaming that he didn't kill her!\"\nAthena:\nI was a fool. How could anybody else know what I was talking about?\nPhoenix:\n(She heard... the voice of his heart...)\nPearl:\nYou were only eleven then, right? You were very brave just to give testimony.\nPhoenix:\nPearls is right. You did the very best you could at the time.\nAthena:\nBut... nothing I said did any good. I was a shaking and scared little girl, small and ineffectual. Even after I went to live with my relatives in Europe, I stayed closed up in my shell.\nPearl:\nBut you're different now! You're always so bright and cheerful!\nAthena:\nThanks. That's because one day, I came to realize that I had to fight. I couldn't give up. I exercised hard and I studied hard.

See Ponco's bandages? I put those on her. I just wound them around and around. Pretty bad job, huh? But I really put my all into it. I hardly left the Center in those days, so I didn't have any human friends besides Junie. I didn't really understand the difference between robots and people back then. I thought that if a robot broke, bandaging it would help it get better. What a weirdo I was!\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like there's something written on the bandages.\nAthena:\nYeah, I wrote stuff like, \"Get well soon, Ponco!\" But, in the end, my mom just put her on the operating table and fixed her in a flash.\nPearl:\nOh! That must be the thing I made move in the robotics lab.\nAthena:\nI was so impressed by what my mom did. I even asked me if she would put me on the table and fix me if I ever got hurt. It looked just like magic to me, what she could do.\nPhoenix:\n(A little girl who grew up around robots... She seems to have some good memories of it.)\nTerran's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife\nAthena:\nCould it have been me who killed Clay...? Did I kill Apollo's friend...?\nPhoenix:\nOf course you didn't! We all believe in you.\nAthena:\nI hope that includes Apollo...\nAnything else\nAthena:\n*sigh* I wonder if I'll ever get the chance to present evidence like that again... I'll probably never work as a lawyer again now...\nPhoenix:\nDon't talk like that, Athena! We're going to clear you of all suspicion. Just you wait!\nAthena:\nI hope you can... I really hope you can...\nAthena:\nI wanted to save Simon, but I had no idea how. Then I met Mr. Wright, and thanks to him... ...I realized that if I became a lawyer, I could prove that Simon was innocent. I also realized that psychology could help me do this. I mean... ...psychology was my mother's specialty. When I studied it... ...I felt like she was there with me, supporting me.\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't seem like Athena knows... ...that Prosecutor Blackquill is due to be executed tomorrow.)\nAthena:\nI wanted to prove Simon's innocence personally. I wanted to do it so bad... Even now, I want to fly out of here and go save him!\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, she said something like that during the Themis Legal Academy trial. She mentioned there was somebody she wanted to save... She must've been talking about Prosecutor Blackquill...)\nAthena:\nI heard some prison guards say that you had an interview with Simon. How was he? What did he say?\nPhoenix:\n............! (No! I can't tell her! But how can I lie to Athena?!) ...He was doing well. He was happy about the possibility of being proven innocent.\nAthena:\nHe was? I wonder if he smiled, like he used to... back then...\nPhoenix:\n(If I can't prove Prosecutor Blackquill's innocence in this trial... ...I don't think Athena will ever forgive me... I just have to free him! Failure is not an option here!)\nFulbright:\nAh, I thought you might be here! Mr. Lawyer, we're in trouble!\nPhoenix:\nW-We are? What is it?\nFulbright:\nI couldn't find a single open courtroom. They're all in session.\nPearl:\nOh, no! But this is an emergency!\nFulbright:\nHmm... It's very difficult to interrupt a trial once it's underway...\nPhoenix:\nMy phone! ...It's from Trucy!\n???:\nI told you I'd give you one hour. I guess it's time to pick one of the hostages...\nPhoenix:\nNo! Wait! We still have a little more time! Besides... all of the courtrooms are being used right now!\n???:\nMake all the excuses you want, but you won't get more time. Your daughter is first. The poor thing. She's a little too young to die, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nNO! Don't you dare hurt her! (There has to be something I can do!)\nFulbright:\nNnngh... The cruelest injustice is about to befall us!\nPearl:\nNo! This can't be happening! Mystic Maya... help us!\nPhoenix:\n(Wait a minute... Maya...?)\nI read somewhere that you were holding a trial in the middle of an exploding courtroom? That must've really been something, although weird is par for the course with you.\nPhoenix:\n(A courtroom... blew up...! That's it! There IS a courtroom we can use after all!)\n???:\nOkay, time's up! Too bad. Any last words you'd like to say to her?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAura, please don't add to the crimes you've already committed.\n???:\nSo you know who I am, do you? It wasn't like I was trying to keep it a secret anyway...\nPhoenix:\nWe're ready to start the trial. We can hold it in the ruins of Courtroom No. 4, the one blown up by the bomber.\nPearl:\nOh! What a wonderful idea, Mr. Nick!\nFulbright:\nI... I never would have thought of that! An astonishing trial in an astonishing location! I guess it's only befitting. I'll go get the place ready right away!\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't exactly pick the place for its \"astonishing\" factor...) How about it? Are you ready to have your brother's innocence proven?\n???:\nMy brother...? Heh. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I'm sorry. Did I forget to mention...? It's not Simon you'll be defending.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? (Not... Prosecutor Blackquill...?)\n???:\nI indict Athena Cykes, on the charge of murdering her own mother! You'll be defending the little princess there, the one behind the glass.\nPhoenix:\n(WH-WHAAAT?!)\n???:\nSee you in that mountain of rubble you've chosen for our courtroom, Mr. Wright!\nPearl:\nWhat is she talking about? Athena...?!\nAthena:\nOf course... Why didn't it ever occur to me before? If Prosecutor Blackquill is innocent, somebody else had to have been the true culprit. Did I..? Did I... kill my own mother...? N-No.........\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\n5 BLACK PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n! No way... It can't be true!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What's the matter?!\nPhoenix:\nI see... I see five black Psyche-Locks! (I've seen these kinds of locks before... Dark, black locks protecting a secret deep inside a person's heart...\n(And there's no way to remove them!)\nTo be continued\nWright Anything Agency (before clearing \"Why you became a lawyer\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPearl:\nWhat a terrible situation this is!\nPhoenix:\nTrucy... I still can't believe it...\nPearl:\nTrucy will be all right, Mr. Nick. She's such a strong girl.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I'm sure she's hanging in there. (But if anything were to happen to her...) S-She's counting on us, Pearls, so let's get out there and do what we can!\nPearl:\nI agree!\nAny ideas?\nPearl:\nThat robot named Clonco... He's very articulate, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\nThat wasn't the robot talking. It was the hostage-taker speaking through him.\nPearl:\nWhat? You mean... there was a person inside the robot?\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's not like that, Pearls.\nPearl:\nHmm? Then... what do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nHow can I explain it? It's kind of like a telephone.\nPearl:\nSo it wasn't a robot. It was a telephone?\nPhoenix:\nYes... No... Hold on. Now I'M confused!\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNothing special here.\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I think I have enough evidence, but maybe I should do a bit more thinking first...)",

I looked into those special Psyche-Locks you mentioned, Mr. Nick.Phoenix:\nYou did? That's great! I really appreciate it.Pearl:\nA red Psyche-Lock protects a secret that a person is consciously trying to hide. If the person folds under questioning, the lock breaks and the truth comes out.Phoenix:\nYup. That's exactly how I got the truth out of Detective Fulbright and Director Cosmos.Pearl:\nBut a black Psyche-Lock protects a secret from the deepest place in a person's heart... ...a secret that that person isn't even consciously aware of.Phoenix:\nSo even they don't know it's there...Pearl:\nAthena isn't trying to keep anything from you on purpose. For some reason, part of her heart and her memories are sealed off, even from herself.Phoenix:\nOkay, so all I have to do is break the Psyche-Locks!Pearl:\nAccording to my research... A black Psyche-Lock is like a heavy chain wrapped directly around one's heart. If they are ripped off by force, it could cause permanent damage to a person's soul.Phoenix:\n(In other words, if I'm not careful, I could traumatize Athena for good... *gulp*) Pearls, could you stay by Athena's side? She must be suffering under the weight of such a heavy burden.Pearl:\nAll right... But will you be all right by yourself, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\nI'm up against Edgeworth. I have to be able to give this trial all of my focus and strength!Pearl:\nAnd you can't do that if I'm there... I'll just hold you back...Phoenix:\nNo, that's not it! I just meant I can relax and concentrate if I knew you were with Athena. You're the only one who can do it, Pearls.Pearl:\nAll right. I'll do it, then! Good luck, Mr. Nick!Phoenix:\n(Good. Now that my mind is at ease, I'd better get ready. I'll just tidy up the evidence and take out what I don't need... It's time to end this nightmare that started seven years ago!)December 20District Court - Courtroom No. 4Phoenix:\n(Defense, prosecution, and judge. There are even people in the gallery. The roof has been completely blown off and the walls have collapsed... ...but today, this ruin is my battleground!)Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge:\nCourt, or some facsimile thereof, is now in session for the trial of Athena Cykes.Aura:Aura:\nNot a \"facsimile,\" old man! This is a proper, official trial! Take this more seriously, or you'll start hearing the bones of the hostages snap!Phoenix:\nPlease try not to upset Ms. Blackquill... I'm begging you...Judge:\nUmm... Court is now in session for the very serious and very proper trial of Athena Cykes.Edgeworth:\nHmph. This is no trial. It's nothing more than a ridiculous farce.Aura:\nWh-What did you say?!Phoenix:\nEdgeworth! Did you not hear what I said to His Honor?!Edgeworth:\nHowever, this ridiculous farce has a very important meaning for our legal system. Recall the case of the UR-1 Incident, in which a prosecutor was found guilty of murder. That case ushered in the odious \"dark age of the law.\"Aura:\nI see what you're after... If we can find the real truth behind that case today...Edgeworth:\nPrecisely. The darkness will be dispelled and glory shall be restored to the court system.Judge:\nProsecutor Edgeworth, you sound as if you know something of this \"truth\"...?Edgeworth:\nI do indeed. A new suspect has emerged in the UR-1 case. For seven years, Simon Blackquill has refused to speak in order to cover for someone else.Phoenix:\n(Brace yourself, Phoenix. Here it comes...)Edgeworth:\nI'm sorry, Wright, but the situation is what it is, and I must do what I must. The prosecution moves to indict Athena Cykes on the count of murder in the first degree!Anime cutscene\nEdgeworth:\nRegardless the circumstance, I intend to question the defendant with all I have. For THAT is a part of my creed.Phoenix:\nThen you'd better bring it.Judge:\nIf the two of you are ready... Court is now in session... for the trial of Athena Cykes.Phoenix:\nYour Honor...! The defense was born ready!Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk... The prosecution... is also ready.Phoenix:\n(This immense tension between us... It's like we're picking up right where we left off.)Edgeworth:\nIt's my duty to clear Prosecutor Blackquill of false accusations and end this insanity.Phoenix:\nBut I have no intention of losing Ms. Cykes, either. She's a very promising young lawyer! (I know without a doubt that Athena is innocent... ...but I don't think Prosecutor Blackquill did it, either.)Phoenix:\nSo... do you have any clue who was responsible for the sabotage...?Cosmos:\nAt the very least, I know it wasn't Simon Blackquill. I don't know enough to identify the true culprit, but it's clear WHAT that person is. To put it simply............ a spy.Phoenix:\n(The true culprit is a spy. It's going to be hard to convince anyone of that when I barely believe it myself... ...but I don't a choice if I want to save Athena and Blackquill and expose the spy!)Judge:\nNow, then, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth...Edgeworth:\nHmph... No need for the \"Chief Prosecutor\" bit, Your Honor. I am here as a simple prosecutor.Judge:\nVery well. Your opening statement, please, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Although, I've been known of late to give an impressive opening statement myself...Edgeworth:\nIn all the trials I have ever seen, only the prosecution gives an opening statement...Judge:\nO-Of course. You're right! I was just joking -- just having a little fun!Phoenix:\n(So he wasn't doing them just out of fear... Interesting...)Edgeworth:\nLet's start with a brief overview of the UR-1 Incident. The incident occurred at the Cosmos Space Center seven years ago, on October 7th. The victim, psychologist Metis Cykes, was killed in the robotics lab on the fourth floor.Phoenix:\n(Athena's mother...)Edgeworth:\nSimon Blackquill, a young prosecutor at the time, was found guilty of the crime. There were two deciding factors that led to his guilty verdict: One: Blackquill was the only person in the corridor to the lab at the time of the murder. And two: this photo, which captured the moment of the crime.Judge:\nHmm... Very incriminating evidence indeed... It would appear that the only conclusion is that Prosecutor Blackquill did indeed--Aura:Aura:\nAre you kidding me?! I'm not accepting any conclusion of the kind! This opening statement is OVER! Now, hurry up and call the witness!Judge:\nExcuse me, Ms. Blackquill, but we must follow proper procedure for these things, you know...Edgeworth:\nOr perhaps we should heed her wishes, Your Honor. She is the trial's sponsor, after all. Besides, the courtroom is chilly, and sitting for too long can't be good for your back.Judge:\nOh! You are very kind to show such concern for the welfare of the elderly...Phoenix:\n(As skilled as ever at playing the court puppeteer, I see.)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls its first witness. A witness... who decided to bring forth new testimony after seven long years!Phoenix:\n(New testimony...? And just who IS this witness, anyway?)Fulbright:\nBobby Fulbright's the name! In justice we trust!Phoenix:\nWhat are YOU doing here...?Fulbright:\nI'm just here to speak for the hostage-taker, Ms. Aura Blackquill. She says she's too busy, what with confining and threatening the hostages and all.Phoenix:\n(That doesn't seem to stop her from constantly chiming in through Clonco...)Aura:\nI'm nothing more than an observer in this. Do your best! I'm watching you...Edgeworth:\nBelieving her brother innocent, Ms. Blackquill has been conducting her own investigation. And though her current actions are hardly lawful, I think we can at least hear her theory.Fulbright:\nI have here Ms. Blackquill's notes on the investigation she conducted. And I'll be giving testimony based on these notes! Here I go!Witness Testimony-- Aura Blackquill's Theory --Fulbright:\n\"Simon isn't the murderer. He was trying to cover for someone.\"\n\"Someone else was at the scene at the time they say Simon committed the murder.\"\n\"I mean, if he really was out to steal that moon rock, then why the rolling case?\"\n\"Because he was using it to hide someone inside. That's why.\"\n\"And the only person small enough to fit inside that case... was Athena Cykes!\"Fulbright:\nAnd that's Ms. Blackquill's theory! It totally goes in the face of the official ruling, huh! About the case she mentions, there were other rolling cases like that one in the lab. But they're not for traveling -- they're apparently for moving parts and equipment.Phoenix:\n(I vaguely remember seeing three cases, all different sizes.)Fulbright:\nAt the last trial, they thought that Prosecutor Blackquill used the case to steal the rock. And they had a perfectly good reason to think that, too! You see, there's a security camera in the corridor that leads to the robotics lab. And that camera captured footage of Blackquill leaving the scene with the case!Phoenix:\n(I can see why that footage helped to bring his trial to a quick end. It's very convincing, that's for sure...)Seven-Year-Old Video updated in the Court Record.Fulbright:\nThat case, by the way, was later discovered outside on the Space Center grounds!Phoenix:\nSpeaking of after the incident, where was the defendant, Athena Cykes, found?Edgeworth:\nShe was found on the fifth floor of the Space Center, in the Cykes family residence. Prosecutor Blackquill most likely brought her there after the incident. In addition, it's unknown where Ms. Cykes was at the estimated time of death.Fulbright:\nMs. Cykes was too confused by the shock of her mother's death to give proper testimony. And there was no witness or evidence to tell us where she might have been...Phoenix:\nSo what you're saying is, Ms. Cykes didn't have an alibi?Edgeworth:\n...That is what the evidence is saying, yes.Judge:\nHmm... I understand the reasoning behind the theory, but I'm far from convinced. The victim is the accused's mother. Are you actually claiming an eleven-year-old girl...?Edgeworth:\n...Hmph. Of course, the girl had a very strong motive.Fulbright:\nDr. Cykes was a psychologist who wrote many papers about speech and emotions. You're aware of Athena Cykes's special ability, aren't you, Your Honor?!Judge:\nAre you referring to that therapy thing? Yes, she's done it quite a few times in court!Edgeworth:\nThe ability to read emotions from speech, and the subject of her mother's research.Judge:\nWell, as long as it benefits society, I don't see any particular problem researching it...Phoenix:\n(I don't like where this is heading... Not one bit!)Edgeworth:\nDr. Cykes was so intent on her research, she forced her daughter to undergo experiments.Judge:\nProsecutor Edgeworth! Are you seriously suggesting...?!Edgeworth:\nI've done my best to be delicate, but even you can't deny it to be true, Mr. Wright. No longer able to withstand the anguish of the experiments... ...Ms. Cykes felt her only choice was to kill her own mother!Phoenix:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! What a tragic story... I hardly want to believe it myself. But we must proceed. Mr. Wright, if you could. Detective Fulbright, please refer to the notes.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Aura Blackquill's Theory --Fulbright:\n\"Simon isn't the murderer.

All we have to do is compare this with... ...this photo of Prosecutor Blackquill to see what's missing. If he took something with him, then it should be in one of these photos! (Lady Luck, don't fail me now...)Judge:\nAll right then, Mr. Wright. Let us hear your theory. What did Prosecutor Blackquill take from the scene of the murder?Present bandaged robot arm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Please note that there is a robot part on top of the cart in this photo.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe took this!\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm afraid I never heard mention of that being removed from the crime scene...\nPhoenix:\n............ (He saw straight through that!)\nEdgeworth:\nTell me you have something more substantial than that, Wright!\nJudge:\nWell, I have something more substantial for him: a penalty.\nPhoenix:\n(I'd better compare the two photos again. Okay, in this photo, I see... ...the operating table, the katana, a cart... and the stuff on said cart... Are any of those things different in this photo taken after the incident?)\nLeads back to:\n\"What did Prosecutor Blackquill take from the scene of the murder?\"Phoenix:\nPlease note that there is a robot part on top of the cart in this photo. However, in this photo taken after the crime, the robot part is gone. In other words, this part is something that was taken from the scene of the crime!Judge:\nHmm... You do appear to be right. I don't see it in the second picture.Fulbright:\nBut it's just a piece of junk. How important could it be?Phoenix:\n(Is it really just an insignificant robot part? ............Speaking of which...)Aura:\nWh-What are you looking at?! I'm gonna start charging for each glance, per eyeball!Phoenix:\n(Stingy, stingy. What happened to the age of free previews?) *ahem* Your Honor, about this robot part... Doesn't it look like it could be an arm from that robot there?Judge:\nWell! Now that you mention it, it does, doesn't it. But the case is still too big to be practical for just the moon rock and a robot arm.Phoenix:\n(But was it really just the one arm that was in there? If it wasn't Athena in the case, then maybe...) I believe there was another robot at the scene that looks just like the one here. Your Honor, it is the defense's assertion that it was this other robot that was in the case!Judge:\nWh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWe can't be certain that part belonged to a robot. Yes, it looks like the arm of the one before us, but it could be something else entirely. Besides, it's wrapped entirely in bandaging, making it difficult to verify what it is.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nI know for a fact that it is a robot arm. I can even tell which robot it belonged to, just by looking at it! With this information, we can investigate whether it was there at the time or not.Judge:\nBut, Mr. Wright! I thought you were more of the technologically illiterate type. When did you become such an expert? I feel... somehow abandoned...Phoenix:\nNot to worry, Your Honor. I still know next to nothing about machines. But I know this piece of evidence proves which robot the arm belonged to!Present HAT-1 Exhibit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The robot in this picture is named Ponco.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI-Is this conclusive enough for you?!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's perfectly conclusive... of your utter incompetence.\nPhoenix:\n(Can't you be normal for once and simply say, \"That's wrong!\"?)\nJudge:\nYou've conclusively earned yourself a penalty as well, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, given the arm's distinctive feature, this is one conclusion that won't escape me!) I may not know my hard disk from my floppy drive...\nLeads back to:\n\"But I know this piece of evidence proves which robot the arm belonged to!\"Phoenix:\nThe robot in this picture is named Ponco. But take a look at Ponco's arm. It was Ms. Cykes who bandaged it up like that.Judge:\nShe must have thought that machines heal in the same way that people do. What an adorable, na\u00efve mistake! It reminds me of my own grandchild...Phoenix:\nThe robot arm at the crime scene had the same bandaging wrapped around it. In other words, this robot arm could belong to none other than Ponco!Judge:\nOrder in the court! Order, I say! Prosecutor Edgeworth, what do you have to say to this?!Edgeworth:\nI concede that the robot is about the same size as a child. But it cannot grab its knees and curl itself up into a ball. Even if it was the largest of the cases, the robot couldn't have possibly fit in there!Judge:\nThe case does comes [sic] up to about mid-thigh on Prosecutor Blackquill. Hmm... I see your point. The robot is much taller than that.Phoenix:\n(They've got me there... So then, did Prosecutor Blackquill make Ponco fit into the case by...?)Dismantling her\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Of course Ponco would fit. All Prosecutor Blackquill had to do was dismantle her.\"Compacting her\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCouldn't he have crunched Ponco up and compacted her a bit? You know, kind of like... ...when you suck the air out of those storage bags with a vacuum cleaner?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm. Interesting theory. Why don't we conduct an experiment, then? Detective Fulbright, could you please bring us a storage bag and a vacuum cleaner? Let's try to compact Mr. Wright here, and see if we can't fit him in the rubbish bin.\nPhoenix:\n............On second thought, let's just scrap the whole idea and start over, okay?\nJudge:\nVery well, but one man's trash is that same man's penalty.\nPhoenix:\nGah!\nLeads back to:\n\"So then, did Prosecutor Blackquill make Ponco fit into the case by...?\"Phoenix:\nOf course Ponco would fit. All Prosecutor Blackquill had to do was dismantle her. Once taken apart, the robot could have easily fit inside that rolling case!Edgeworth:\nHmm... It appears to be a robot-assembly device.Pearl:\n\"Disassemble anything in a flash! Push the 'Dismantle' button!\" That sounds pretty neat! Can I push it, Mr. Nick?Judge:\nHmm... It sounds rather violent, but Mr. Wright does have a point there.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nExcept that there was a body on the table where robots are dismantled and assembled. There would have been no room to take the robot apart.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut what if it wasn't done on the table? What if the katana was used instead?Judge:\nY-You mean... the sword?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. Ms. Blackquill, I'd like your opinion as a woman of science. Isn't it true that the katana could have been used to take the robot apart?!Aura:\nI... I suppose so...! Their joints aren't made of a very tough material. A blade could slice through them.Phoenix:\nThank you for your expert opinion, Ms. Blackquill. Thanks to you, we now know... ...that the existence of the severed arm in this photo proves that Ponco was taken apart. In addition, since the rest of Ponco was not found at the scene, we can conclude that... ...the true meaning of this photo is very different from the original interpretation.Judge:\n...Y-You can't mean...?!Phoenix:\nThat's exactly what I mean. This photo does NOT capture the moment of the murder. It is instead a picture of the moment after the robot was sliced apart. The blood you see where the arm was cut off was transferred there by the bloody katana. Most likely, the rest of Ponco is scattered around Prosecutor Blackquill's feet...Aura:\nNot hearing this...!Phoenix:\nTherefore, what was transported inside that case was not the defendant, but a robot! Ms. Cykes never was at the scene at the time of the murder!Aura:\nNnnnngh... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! ...My head! My head! My body! Where am I?! Gaaagh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court!Aura:\nIt's true that Ponco was found in pieces after the murder... And I'll admit I repaired her myself afterwards.Photo of the Crime updated in the Court Record.Phoenix:\n(Yes! I'm finally making some progress! Hopefully, I've gotten at least one step closer... ...to proving both Athena and Prosecutor Blackquill innocent...)Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWell played, Mr. Wright. You've made your point abundantly clear. I concede that it wasn't the defendant inside the rolling case, but the robot.Phoenix:\n(All right... What's going on here? It's never good when he plays things this straight...)Judge:\nDoes the prosecution withdraw its claim that the defendant was carried from the scene?Edgeworth:\nNo, Your Honor. My claim hasn't changed.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut Ponco and Ms. Cykes couldn't have both been inside that case!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThe notion that the case was used to carry Ms. Cykes was Ms. Blackquill's theory. I have been of a different opinion from the outset. Now I finally have the opportunity to voice my theory... ...thanks to the defense.Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth... He's been one step ahead of me this whole time!)Judge:\nIn that case, how do you propose the defendant left the crime scene?Edgeworth:\nSimple. The footage only shows Prosecutor Blackquill from behind. What's more... ...he's holding his arm in front of his body, as if he were holding something, or someone...Phoenix:\nThat's hardly evidence.Edgeworth:\nI have proof: the surcoat Prosecutor Blackquill was wearing. The victim's blood was found on the front of it and the stain had a highly distinctive shape.Judge:\nA bloodstain? With a distinctive shape? Please continue, Prosecutor Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nSeven years ago, the defendant was known to constantly wear a certain item... ...of which there is only one in the world: a special pair of headphones made just for her.Woods:\nShe always wore these big, heavy-looking headphones. She said her mother made them for her, as part of her research.Edgeworth:\nAnalysis showed the bloodstain to be in the exact same shape as these headphones. In other words, this was no mere blood splatter. The blood went from the victim's body... to the headphones... and then... ...was imprinted onto Prosecutor Blackquill's coat like a stamp.Judge:\nA most gruesome stamp, indeed...Edgeworth:\nBlackquill carried Ms. Cykes, who had been hit by splatter, away from the crime scene. This proves that Athena Cykes was, without question, present at the crime scene. And that... concludes the prosecution's argument.Phoenix:\nNgaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!Judge:\nOrder! ...If the defendant was indeed at the scene, it deepens the suspicion against her.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut we've also shown that the robot was there at the scene as well!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI hope you're not making the ridiculous claim that a simple robot was the real murderer?Phoenix:\n(I don't really think that, no, but...) You can't say the possibility isn't there! Detective Fulbright, was the robot questioned at the time?Fulbright:\nNo, I don't see any record of it. I believe it was considered \"unrelated to the case.\"Phoenix:\nBut, as it turned out, the robot was actually integrally related. Your Honor, the defense would like to call Ponco to the stand!Judge:\nA r-robot witness?! Order! Order in the court! ...Prosecutor Edgeworth, what do you think about this?Edgeworth:\nHmph. Mr. Wright has called all manner of witnesses to the stand over the years. So why not a robot? Nothing surprises me anymore with him.Judge:\nVery well. I will allow the witness. ...Bailiff! Please summon the robot named Ponco!Edgeworth:\nWitness, please state your name and occupation.Ponco:\nMy name is not \"witness\"! My name is Ponco!Edgeworth:\nYes, I realize that. But when you are at the witness stand, you are the \"witness.\"Ponco:\nNo, I'm not! I'm Ponco! Say it with me! \"Ponco\"!Edgeworth:\nWhat an utterly inflexible little robot!Phoenix:\n(You're the last person who should be calling anybody \"inflexible\"...)Judge:\nHa ha! You remind me of my grandchild who just learned his own name. Oh, how precious!Edgeworth:\nAll right, Ponco... I'm going to ask you some questions.Ponco:\nQuestions? You have questions? Hooray! What are your questions?Edgeworth:\nI want to know if you were there at the scene of the murder of Metis Cykes. It was seven years ago, on the 7th of October around 2 PM, in the robotics lab.Ponco:\nCertainly! Just one moment! Searching data............ Search complete! Yes, I was there in the robotics lab!Edgeworth:\nIt would seem this robot's testimony is necessary to this case after all.Phoenix:\n(This is great! I just KNEW Ponco must've seen something important!)Judge:\nA murder committed right before this poor little girl's eyes! It's inexcusable!Phoenix:\n(The judge seems ready to adopt Ponco as another grandchild...)Judge:\nSo, little Ponco, do you think you can give us your testimony today...?Witness Testimony-- What I Saw --Ponco:\nI went to the robotics lab at about 2 PM for my regular recharge!\nJust as I was about to charge up, Athena came in and hugged Mommy Metis!\nAnd then Mommy Metis fell down. After that, I was recharging, so I don't know anything.\nAfter I charged up, I was cleaning the room, and Mr. Simon came in.\nAnd then an error occurred. There is no data after that point.Judge:\nWell, it sounds like the defendant was, without question, at the scene. However, it doesn't appear that the witness saw the actual moment of the murder.Edgeworth:\nI disagree. This testimony shows that the defendant did indeed commit the crime.Phoenix:\n...What?Edgeworth:\nAt the end of the day, we mustn't forget that this witness is still a machine. Being a robot, its understanding and capacity to express itself are limited.Judge:\nS-So what are you suggesting?Edgeworth:\nThe witness's statements need to be interpreted. For example, the terms \"hugged,\" and then, later, \"fell down.\" Adults don't usually fall down after being hugged by a child.Judge:\nThey don't, but...!Edgeworth:\nYes. What this witness's statements are telling us is... ...that the defendant stabbed the victim with the murder weapon during this moment!Phoenix:\nWH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Edgeworth:\nBefore Ms. Cykes hugged Dr. Cykes, did the two of them converse?Ponco:\nYes, they did. They spoke to each other very loudly! But I don't know what they said. Athena is usually so quiet, so I was surprised!Edgeworth:\n\"Spoke very loudly.\" We can interpret this to mean \"they argued.\"Judge:\nI see. Murder after a heated argument... And then the victim \"fell down.\" I agree that it does sound like a reasonable interpretation. However, Ponco doesn't seem to remember anything that happened after that.Ponco:\nWhen I am recharging, I go into sleep mode. But I remember everything before that! I have a very good memory!Edgeworth:\nYou may as well admit defeat now, Wright; a cross-examination would be useless.Phoenix:\nD-Don't be ridiculous! A cross-examination is never useless!Edgeworth:\nUntil now. Think about it! Robots don't lie. This robot is both an important witness and valuable evidence at the same time.Phoenix:\nNevertheless... I will have my cross-examination!Edgeworth:\nHmph. I see you haven't changed. You never were one to worry about wasting time.Judge:\nVery well. Even if it may be a waste of time, you may proceed, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(I'll show you both just how fruitful any cross-examination can be!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What I Saw --Ponco:\nI went to the robotics lab at about 2 PM for my regular recharge!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour \"regular recharge\"? What is that, exactly?\nPonco:\nI have to refill my battery's power or else I stop working! I go to the lab to do that.\nEdgeworth:\nSo that recharge occurred around 2 PM, around the time of the murder?\nPonco:\nThat's right! I go every day at 2 PM!Ponco:\nJust as I was about to charge up, Athena came in and hugged Mommy Metis!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(\"Hugged\" her, huh? Which Edgeworth took to mean \"stabbed her with a weapon.\") You said the two of them were talking before Ms. Cykes hugged her mother, is that right?\nPonco:\nYes, they were talking very loudly. But I couldn't tell what they were saying.\nPhoenix:\nCouldn't tell? Even though they were speaking so loudly?\nPonco:\nI'm only allowed to listen to voices that are directed at me.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. If it listened to every voice, it would be little better than a mobile eavesdropper.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, that explains why some of Ponco's testimony is so vague...)\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a shame that our little friend wasn't listening in, however.

A little kid couldn't possibly move an adult body like that! And the last thing I want to do is cast more suspicion Athena's way!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright...? Your response...?\nPhoenix:\nUm, can you just forget I ever said that, Your Honor? Please...?\nJudge:\nI can't, and I won't. As a matter of fact, here is a little reminder for YOU as well!\nPhoenix:\nAaaaaagh! (Ngh... I really need to think this through. What could explain the two locations...?) Let me try that again, Your Honor!\nLeads back to:\n\"What could explain the two very different locations of the body? I'll tell you what!\"Phoenix:\nAn eleven-year-old girl couldn't have moved the heavy body of an adult. So the only explanation is that the victim walked to the operating table herself. In other words, what Ponco observed near the workbench... ...couldn't possibly have been the moment of the murder!Judge:\nWhew. I am relieved to hear that. Glad to know that the murder wasn't committed in front of little Ponco here.Phoenix:\nYes, as we just heard in the testimony, Ms. Cykes hugged her mother, nothing more.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWright, Wright, Wright, Wright, Wright... It's been eight years, but you're still just as green as ever.Judge:\nGreen...? But I can't recall ever seeing Mr. Wright in anything but a blue suit.Phoenix:\n(Hey, blue's my favorite color! What can I say?)Edgeworth:\nIf the defendant couldn't move the body herself, she could have it moved for her.Phoenix:\nMoved for her? But Ms. Cykes and Dr. Cykes were the only ones there!Edgeworth:\nI agree. Since this robot is equipped with a heartbeat detection system... ...it would've been aware of another person's presence, if someone else had been there. We can therefore conclude that the defendant and the victim were the only ones present.Judge:\nThen who do you suggest moved the body?Edgeworth:\nDon't you know it's in the nature of a robot to help people do things? Ms. Panko, allow me to ask you a question.Ponco:\nMy name is \"Ponco\"! Say it with me! \"Ponco\"!Edgeworth:\nI believe you said you were cleaning after Dr. Cykes \"fell down.\" Did you happen to move something large onto the operating table?Ponco:\nYes! Yes, I did! Athena asked me to!Phoenix:\nAthena asked you to...?Judge:\nAnd what did you move, little Ponco?Ponco:\nI don't know. Unless something has an ID tag, I can't tell what it is.Judge:\nAn ID tag, you say?Ponco:\nYes, a tag with a bar code on it. We robots scan them to tell us what a thing is!Phoenix:\n(Hmm... That paper in the lab did mention something about that. \"Recognizes people by scanning their spacesuit or uniform jacket ID tag,\" it said.)Edgeworth:\nSo it would appear that Ms. Panko here can't identify what it moved.Ponco:\nMy name is \"Ponco\"!Edgeworth:\nBut we humans have the power to imagine what it was, do we not?Judge:\nW-We do?!Edgeworth:\nHmph. Well, I do, at the very least. Ms. Panko, on the defendant's command, moved the body onto the operating table!Phoenix:\nGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Ponco! Did you really move Dr. Cykes's body?! This is really important! Isn't there any way you could tell?!Ponco:\nI don't know! Without an ID tag, I can't tell!Edgeworth:\nGive it up, Wright! If the victim's heart had stopped, the robot's detection system would be useless. Furthermore, Dr. Cykes usually wore her white coat while she was working. She kept the jacket with her ID tag on it draped over a chair in the robotics lab. ...and only wore it for special occasions. In other words, the victim wasn't wearing her ID tag at the time. From the robot's point of view, her body was simply just another object!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut Ponco is equipped with a facial recognition system! If she really did move the victim, she would have recognized the body as Dr. Cykes! But she didn't, so that means--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nA face can easily be covered with a piece of cloth, a mask or anything else for that matter! With her facial features hidden, the robot wouldn't be able to tell it was Dr. Cykes!Phoenix:\nNnnnnnngh! (He's right...)Edgeworth:\nTo summarize, Ms. Cykes stabbed her mother near the workbench, then, using the robot... ...she moved the body to the table, where she removed the sword and was stained in blood.Judge:\nOrder! ...But if that's the case, then I have a question. Why did the defendant move the body to the operating table in the first place?Edgeworth:\n...You want a reason? Very well.Phoenix:\nWh-What? You can't possibly have an explanation!Edgeworth:\nYour emotions blind you to the truth. You could learn a lot from our robot friends. Calm and rational thought will open your eyes to the truth in front of you, Mr. Wright. Now then, do you remember the operating table's one special feature?Judge:\nI believe I read that robots can be assembled and disassembled there, isn't that right?Edgeworth:\nThat's right. And to the defendant, who was just a child at the time... ...the table was like a magic box that could make robots appear or disappear in seconds.Athena:\nBut, in the end, my mom just put her on the operating table and fixed her in a flash. I was so impressed by what my mom did. I even asked her if she would put me on the table and fix me if I ever got hurt. It looked just like magic to me, what she could do.Phoenix:\nY-You can't possibly be suggesting...!Edgeworth:\nThis young, sheltered girl had a difficult time distinguishing robots from people.Phoenix:\nBut take a look at Ponco's arm. It was Ms. Cykes who bandaged it up that like.Judge:\nShe must have thought that machines heal in the same way that people do. What an adorable, na\u00efve mistake! It reminds me of my own grandchild...Phoenix:\nNo way... I refuse to believe it!Edgeworth:\nMs. Cykes made a childish, na\u00efve and cruel mistake. She thought that if a robot could be dismantled and vanish without a trace...Judge:\nP-Prosecutor Edgeworth! I-If you're about to claim what I think you are... ...I demand that you word it as delicately as you can!Edgeworth:\nWith all due respect, Your Honor, all I can do is present the truth as it stands. The reason the defendant moved the victim's body to the operating table...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNO! Don't say another word! Just stop!Edgeworth:\n...was to \"dismantle\" the evidence so that she could get away with her crime!Phoenix:\nThat... That can't be... TRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUEEEEE!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Order in the court, I saaaaaaay!Phoenix:\nEdgeworth... She was just a little kid... How can you say such a horrible thing...?Edgeworth:\nHorrible? Hmph. Like I said, you're just as green as ever. I came here today as a prosecutor to seek only the truth. No more, no less. My theory is simply the result of a rational consideration of every possibility.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nB-But dismantling isn't the table's only function! It can make repairs as well! It's conceivable that Ms. Cykes moved her mother to the table in order to \"fix\" her!Edgeworth:\nHmph. I suppose that could be another way of interpreting it. But dismantle or repair, it doesn't matter either way.Phoenix:\nWhat do you mean?Edgeworth:\nAfter murdering her mother, Ms. Cykes may have come to her senses. Perhaps she did want to make it appear as if it had never happened... ...and that's why she tried to \"repair\" her mother... Yes, that's one possible explanation.Phoenix:\nB-But...Edgeworth:\nBut we mustn't forget the facts of this case. The victim was observed to fall down after being \"hugged\" by the defendant. And the body was moved per the defendant's command. These two facts -- facts that indicate the defendant's guilt -- remain unchanged!Phoenix:\nThis just can't be true...Judge:\nMr. Wright, do you have any evidence to refute the prosecution's claim?Phoenix:\nEvidence... Right... Let's see... (I can't think of any!) I-I'm afraid I... don't have any evidence.Edgeworth:\nSince becoming chief prosecutor, I've learned that the truth isn't always pretty. Now, accept the truth, Mr. Wright! Your subordinate murdered her own mother. Your Honor, the prosecution demands a verdict. The hostages have suffered enough.Judge:\nWhat a terrible and tragic conclusion... If the defense has no counterargument, I see no need to further prolong this trial.Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth's argument seems solid enough... But... But... There's no way Athena could have ever done anything like that! What do I do?! There has to be something... but I can't think of a single thing...!)???:Judge:\nP-Prosecutor Blackquill!Blackquill:\n...Hmph. This is quite the farce you are conducting here. I could die from laughter.Edgeworth:\n...Prosecutor Blackquill, what are you talking about?Blackquill:\nWhat I'm talking about is that your argument is based on an entirely false premise.Phoenix:\nG-Go on. We're listening. (Could this be the miracle I need?! But what is Prosecutor Blackquill trying to pull here...?)Blackquill:\n............Seven years. For seven long years... ...this case has been on my mind. Not for an instant did I not think of it. I'm the one who killed my mentor, and don't think you can alter that fact now. Your Baldness, I will take to the stand, and I won't take no for an answer!Judge:\nO-Of course, Prosecutor Blackquill. Please go ahead.Witness Testimony-- Seven Years Ago --Blackquill:\nI went to the Cosmos Space Center with the intention of killing Dr. Cykes!\nBut when I got to the robotics lab, I found Athena there instead.\nI would not be swayed from my purpose, so I waited for Dr. Cykes to return.\nAnd then, I committed the act. Ah, how cathartic it was!Judge:\nHmm... But little Ponco here witnessed the victim \"falling.\" In other words--Blackquill:Blackquill:\nI don't need any of your \"other words,\" old man. I can guess what happened.Judge:\nWh-Which would be...?Blackquill:\n\"She fell\" means \"she fell.\" Merely that. A mother and child fooling around... Perhaps she tripped. Not that it matters. When I entered the lab, there was no trace of Dr. Cykes to be seen. There was no dead body, either, of course, meaning she must have left the room.Judge:\nSo the murder occurred after the time period Ponco described in her testimony?Blackquill:\nHmph. You should hardly take stock in the words of a windup toy.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThen how do you explain the fact that the defendant had the robot move something?!Blackquill:\nAthena was always tinkering with robots on the operating table to amuse herself. And she always had Ponco move the heavy ones for her. That day was no different. Ponco moved a heavy robot for Athena.Phoenix:\n(This is awful... What he's saying seems to make sense, and yet...)Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nProsecutor Blackquill! Are you trying, even now, to turn away from the truth?! Don't you realize we could bring the dark age of the law to a close today?!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nYou expect too much from me. I'm just a murderer, beyond redemption. Why don't you just let me go so I can settle down into hell?Edgeworth:\nNgh!Phoenix:\n(Prosecutor Blackquill's execution is tomorrow... If the truth doesn't come out now, it's all over...)Judge:\nAre you saying that the little girl and the robot had nothing to do with the murder?Blackquill:\nThat's right. So let's hear your verdict. If we don't hurry, I might miss the ferry across the Styx.Judge:\nI... Hmm...Aura:Aura:\nDon't you dare, Judge! Don't forget I have hostages over here! And Simon! How long are you going to cover for her?!Phoenix:\nM-Ms. Blackquill!Blackquill:\nForgive me, Aura. I never wanted you to do anything like this for me. But you agreed to this trial. If you have a counterargument, then present your evidence. That's the rule of the courtroom. Isn't that right, Chief Prosecutor?Edgeworth:\nBlackquill...! You selfish--!Judge:\n...Well, to be frank, I don't like this, but it's my duty to make a decision. If no one has a counterargument, I will announce my verdict.Phoenix:\n(Is this really happening? Is it really going to end just like it did seven years ago...?!)Athena:\nI wanted to do it so bad... Even now, I want to fly out of here and go save him!Phoenix:\n............! (No! I can't tell her! But how can I lie to Athena?! If I can't prove Prosecutor Blackquill's innocence in this trial... ...I don't think Athena will ever forgive me...)Phoenix:\n(I can't let this happen...! ...But I just don't have the evidence to counter Prosecutor Blackquill's testimony...!)???:Phoenix:\nAthena! What are you--? Are you feeling okay?Athena:\nI can hear it... I can hear the voice of his heart. He's hiding something!Phoenix:\n(If he really is, I could sure use Athena's help here... Her power might be just the thing to get us through this!)Blackquill:Blackquill:\nCykes-dono...! No need for you to chime in here. Just accept that you're innocent!Athena:Athena:\n...........These past seven years... They've been just as hard on me, you know.Blackquill:\nWhat are you talking about...?Athena:\nDo you remember? That... horrible, horrible trial...\"Please! You have to listen to me!\"Athena:\"He didn't kill her! His heart is screaming that he didn't kill her!\"Athena:\nEven now, every time I stand in a courtroom, it comes back to haunt me. Not being heard, no matter how hard you try... Feeling so helpless... Caught in people's stares, so scared that it feels like your chest is in a vise... I'm terrified of courtrooms. I want to run out of that door even now!Phoenix:\n(And yet, you found a way to keep your fears at bay and became a lawyer...)Athena:\nThanks. That's because one day, I came to realize that I had to fight. I couldn't give up. I exercised hard and I studied hard. I wanted to become the strongest lawyer I could be.Athena:\n...This day has finally come. The day I've been looking forward to with all my heart. This is why I became a lawyer. This is why I studied psychology. It was all to save you from this false conviction.Judge:\nBut, Ms. Cykes, do you realize what it would mean? You are the accused, after all. If you prove Prosecutor Blackquill innocent, then...Athena:\nThe only thing that matters is the truth. It's my duty to find out what that truth is. Simon, please give me this chance! The chance to shake off this fear that's been with me for seven years and to face the truth!Phoenix:\n(Athena is being so brave, confronting her past like this... This might really be the last chance to save them both!) Prosecutor Blackquill! Please testify one more time about the incident seven years ago!Blackquill:\n............Hmph. Fine, but your efforts will surely be in vain. For I am not a man who can be cut down easily.Athena:\nHere we go, Simon! Let me hear the voice of your heart!Blackquill:\nI went to the Cosmos Space Center with the intention of killing Dr. Cykes.Blackquill:\nBut when I got to the robotics lab, I found Athena there instead.Pinpoint Happy marker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This feeling of happiness...\"Blackquill:\nI would not be swayed from my purpose, so I waited for Dr. Cykes to return.Blackquill:\nAnd then, I committed the act. Ah, how cathartic it was!Athena:\nHis emotions are very guarded, and his defenses are way up. He's steeled his will, as if he'll never let his secrets be known...Phoenix:\nOh, I don't know about that. We've got a couple of strong wills on our side, too! Prosecutor Blackquill isn't the killer, and we're going to prove it!Athena:\nBut what WAS he trying to do that day? If we approach it from that angle... ...I bet we can find an emotion that just doesn't add up!Phoenix:\nThis feeling of happiness... Even though the person you were looking for wasn't there, you felt happy. Why is that?Blackquill:\nSimple. When I was looking for Athena, and hadn't found her yet, I grew worried. So when I saw her in the robotics lab, I was happily relieved. Merely that.NOISE LEVEL40%Phoenix:\nJust now, you said that you went to the Space Center to kill Dr. Cykes... ...but the first thing you did was look for her daughter instead?Blackquill:\nI had no intention of harming Athena, so I wanted to confirm that she was safe first. It was just a part of my plan. Nothing contradictory about that.Phoenix:\nGah...! (The second I find an inconsistency, he cuts it down...)Athena:\nSimon knows the principles of analytical psychology. There's less noise now... but I don't see any instabilities we can latch on to.Phoenix:\n(I was afraid of that. We'll just have to keep chipping away at him, then, bit by bit!) Could you update his testimony, Athena?Athena:\nYou got it, Boss!Blackquill:\nI went to the Cosmos Space Center with the intention of killing Dr. Cykes.Blackquill:\nWhen I found Athena in the robotics lab, I was relieved.Blackquill:\nBut I would not be swayed from my purpose, so I waited for Dr. Cykes to return.Blackquill:\nAnd when she did, I plunged the katana in!Pinpoint Sad marker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Not even you can falsify your emotions, Prosecutor Blackquill.\"Athena:\nThe heart doesn't lie, not even Simon's. I can hear that he's trying to hide his true feelings, but they're seeping through anyway.Phoenix:\nThanks. That should help a lot. (If Prosecutor Blackquill isn't the killer, then there should be a contradiction somewhere!)Phoenix:\nNot even you can falsify your emotions, Prosecutor Blackquill.Blackquill:\nWhat?Phoenix:\nWhen you said that you killed Dr. Cykes in your testimony, you felt sadness. Why would someone who had laid in wait to kill her be sad at her death?!Blackquill:\nHmph. Such an obvious attack. Yes, I felt sadness, but it wasn't for her. I felt sorrow for Athena and her circumstances.Phoenix:\nGah...! (He can't be talking about that... can he?)Athena:\nI was just a convenient subject for her research.Edgeworth:\nDr. Cykes was so intent on her research, she forced her daughter to undergo experiments.Blackquill:\nMy objective was to save Athena... ...from an obsessive scientist who treated her own daughter like a research subject.Phoenix:\n(Wh-What...?!)Blackquill:\nI went to the psychology lab first. That's where I would usually find Athena playing. But that day was different. I heard someone crying in the robotics lab next door. \"Was Athena being subjected to yet another experiment?\" I thought as I went to see. Conveniently, Athena had cried herself to sleep, so all I had to do was wait and kill.Phoenix:\n(So that's why he was relieved when he saw Athena... But is this story really true? I'm not sure how much to believe...)Athena:\nMr. Wright?Phoenix:\nHow are you doing, Athena? Still hanging in there?Athena:\n...I'm a lot stronger than I look, Boss. Now, take a look at this. The noise level actually increased.NOISE LEVEL60%Phoenix:\nIt went up? (I've never seen it do that before!)Athena:\nProsecutor Blackquill is lying somewhere in his testimony. As a matter of fact... ...he's piling lie on top of lie, in an attempt to make his claim sound more believable. He's trying even harder to suppress his true feelings, and that's what's causing the noise!Phoenix:\n(How in the world should I approach this? An evidence-based approach might work if I can find a contradiction. (Changed from [I can either use an evidence-based approach if I can find a contradiction.] in the original release) Otherwise, I should look for an inconsistency in his emotions...)Blackquill:\n...Hmph. There are no flaws in my testimony, and His Baldness is prepared to give his verdict. Give up on this lost cause, and let the law free me of these chains already.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nI don't think so. Not while I'm around. (Now, contradictory testimony or inconsistent emotions... Which should I tackle first?)His testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOkay, let's present some evidence here!\nAthena:\nGot it, Boss!

Why would you register surprise at opening the door to the lab?Blackquill:\nTsk! ...All right, fine. I'll explain, if I must. What surprised me was... Ponco. That toy figure attacked me. Dr. Cykes knew full well of my plan to rescue Athena. But she couldn't stand guard over her daughter twenty-four hours a day...Phoenix:\nSo Dr. Cykes had Ponco do it?Blackquill:\nThat's right. She ordered Ponco to forcibly remove me on sight. So I slashed Ponco up with the katana that was there in the lab. Hmph... That rickety old puppet wasn't worthy of that fine blade...Athena:\nMr. Wright! It's happening again! There's even more noise now!NOISE LEVEL100%Phoenix:\n(It's at a hundred percent now!

That's the photo of the supposed \"moment of the murder,\" isn't it?Blackquill:\nHow many more times must I see that which damned me for my sin?Phoenix:\nThe ironic thing is, I think this picture is actually going to be your savior now. See the bloodstain at the end of Ponco's arm where it was severed with the katana?Judge:\n...I hope you aren't claiming it's the robot's blood, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nNo. Most likely, the blood was transferred there from the bloody katana.Judge:\nThe katana already had blood on it? So then it must have been the victim's blood?Phoenix:\nThat's right. But, if that's the case, we've found a glaring inconsistency.Blackquill:\n............Ngh!Phoenix:\nYou said in your testimony that you cut up Ponco, and then you killed Dr. Cykes. But, in spite of that, the victim's blood is already on Ponco's arm in this picture.Judge:\nWhat? But that couldn't be!Phoenix:\nExactly. In order for the blood to have transferred from the sword to Ponco's arm... ...the victim must have been stabbed first, before the robot was slashed. In other words, Prosecutor Blackquill... ...your entire testimony is nothing but one giant ball of lies!Blackquill:\nGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!Phoenix:\nTell the court the truth, Prosecutor Blackquill. Now!Blackquill:\n...YOU...! You have NO idea what you're doing...!Athena:\nUnh... His voice... There's so much discord! I'm hearing not just one or two, but a bunch of rampaging emotions here! It's hard to describe... It's like a violent whirlpool or something...!Blackquill:\nPhoenix Wright...! You will pay for this! Never have I been forced to reveal so much, but the rest I'll take to my grave!Phoenix:\nProsecutor Blackquill, you are on the witness stand. You are obligated to tell the truth. Isn't that the rule of the courtroom?Athena:\nAll of these complex emotions... They seem to be flowing from one source. I think whatever he really saw that day is what's causing these feelings!Blackquill:\nFollowing the sound of crying, I opened the lab door. And then...Blackquill:\nI saw it! That terrible scene!Probe Athena\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"When you opened the door and saw Athena, you became overwhelmed by your emotions.\"Blackquill:\nBut before I could lead Athena out of there, curse my luck, Dr. Cykes came in!Blackquill:\nI had no choice but to kill my mentor!Athena:\nAngh...! Th-This voice! It hurts to even listen to it... (Changed from [Angh...! Th-This voice! It's hurts [sic] to even listen to it...] in the original release) He's been living with this pain inside him for all these years?!Phoenix:\nAnd the root of it all is hidden somewhere in this testimony, isn't it?Athena:\nYes, that's right. Please hurry! Please set him free, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nWhen you opened the door and saw Athena, you became overwhelmed by your emotions. Isn't that right, Prosecutor?Blackquill:\nNnngh... You should know better. And though it's pathetic... I admit I'm terrified to speak of it.Phoenix:\nProsecutor Blackquill, Ms. Cykes is innocent. I will always believe that with all my heart. Now, can't you find it within yourself to believe in me, too?Blackquill:\nAthena is innocent, huh? Can you honestly say you believe that to be true, Wright-dono?Phoenix:\nI give you my word. Now tell me what you really saw when you opened that door!Blackquill:\nC-Curse you, Phoenix Wright!It was a tragedy -- one I'll never forget. When I arrived at the lab... Dr. Cykes was already dead. She was lying on the operating table... while the bloody katana lay on the floor. And standing between the two, covered in blood, was Athena. She smiled, with a far-off look in her eyes, as she sweetly said...Something's wrong with Mom, so I'm taking her apart to fix her!Blackquill:...That's what I saw. And now you have it -- the truth that you so desperately wanted.Phoenix:\n(N-No... Prosecutor Blackquill finally tells the truth... and THIS is what it is...? It's... beyond devastating...!)Athena:\nI-I... tried to take... my mother... apart...? I... I... I... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAthena:So it was me... I... I'm the one... who killed... my mother...Phoenix:\nA-Athena!Edgeworth:\nAs I said, Wright... The truth isn't always... pretty... Murder, disassembly on an operating table, a scientist using her daughter as a guinea pig... Sadly, it appears that my theory was correct after all.Blackquill:Blackquill:\nIt's true that Athena didn't like her mother's research, but... ...you dare cast aspersions on my mentor by claiming Athena was used in such a manner?! Dr. Cykes could be awkward with people, but she loved her daughter with all her heart!Athena:\nShe... loved me...?Blackquill:\nYour mother hated to see you suffer because you could hear the voices of people's hearts. She wanted to set you free of your pain, so she worked tirelessly on her research. Do you remember those headphones you hated so much?Athena:\nYes... My head hurt every time I wore them...Blackquill:\nNo, Athena, it's just the opposite. They emitted sound waves to nullify emotional input from the voices of people around you. Your power was much stronger then than it is now. And those headphones were what enabled you to carry on with everyday life.Athena:\nNo...! That can't be true...! Then why...?! ...Why would I have done... something like that... to somebody who loved me so much..?!Blackquill:\nHer love for you was real. That, I can guarantee. That's why I knew... ...that what happened had to be some kind of mistake. I couldn't let you be punished for it!Edgeworth:\nSo you took the blame yourself? You and your mentor are more alike than you know.Blackquill:\nPonco was a witness, so I put it in the case, held Athena close, and vacated the lab. I threw Ponco away in the boarding lounge trash chute... ...and I hid the case on the Space Center grounds.Judge:\nHmm... It would seem that we now have all of the facts of this case.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo! Not yet! It can't end like this!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nDo not disgrace yourself, Mr. Wright. The truth has been revealed. Or are you the type of man to turn your back to things that disagree with you?Phoenix:\nI'm not... But this...! (I-I can't give up now! I have to say something, anything, even if it's a bluff! I've always managed to pull through that way in the past! I have to make it work!) The defense is, uh, prepared to... present evidence...Athena:\n...Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Athena?Athena:\nIt's... okay. You can stop now... I don't want you or anyone else to suffer any longer for my sake...Phoenix:\nA-Athena! What are you saying?!Athena:\nI killed my mother. That's the truth. It's just like Prosecutor Edgeworth said... We have to face it... no matter how much it hurts.I admit my guilt. But could I please be granted... just one chance to tell everyone what I recall...?Edgeworth:\n...Hmph. It appears Ms. Cykes is much braver than you, Mr. Wright. What say you, Your Honor? In light of her courage, will the court give Ms. Cykes this opportunity to confess?Judge:\n...Very well. Then if you would, please take the stand, Ms. Cykes.Athena:\nThank you for letting me do this, Prosecutor Edgeworth. And thank you, Mr. Wright and Prosecutor Blackquill, for letting the truth be known. Now we can finally move forward, and everyone's suffering can come to an end.Phoenix:\n(Athena...!)Edgeworth:\nProsecutor Blackquill will be cleared and the dark age of the law can come to an end. ...Yes. Admit your guilt, and bring everything to its conclusion.Athena:\n...I killed my mother. My memory is still a little hazy, but there's no question I remember it. I remember the weight of the weapon in my hands, and the feeling of it stabbing in deep... And I remember the warmth of her blood as it flowed down the handle onto my fingers. Your Honor, please find me guilty.Edgeworth:\nI dare say, these are all memories that no one but the murderer would have.Judge:\nI see. Thank you for your confession. I believe this trial has gone on long enough. But, before we conclude, does anyone have a counterargument?Phoenix:Phoenix:\n............I do, Your Honor.Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright...Athena:\nBut Mr. Wright... Why? I killed her. I remember it now. Any counterargument now is pointless!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nDon't tell me you've forgotten one of the basic tenants of lawyering? Always believe in your client to the bitter end. Athena, you are not a murderer.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nI said that you never change, but could you have actually regressed in these eight years? I won't stand for your childish emotionalism getting in the way of the truth!Phoenix:\n(\"Emotionalism\"? Don't lecture ME on matters of the heart, Edgeworth! Because I can see straight into a person's soul!)5 BLACK PSYCHE-LOCKSPearl:\n...I did a little research. I looked into those special Psyche-Locks you mentioned, Mr. Nick. Athena isn't trying to keep anything from you on purpose. For some reason, part of her heart and her memories are sealed off, even from herself.Phoenix:\n(There's still a chance. Somewhere deep in Athena's heart... ...there might still be a memory that not even she knows about yet. It might be like looking for a grain of sand somewhere in the cosmos, but, still...! That memory might contain a new fact that could prove her innocence!)Judge:\nI hope for everyone's sake that you are not just bluffing, Mr. Wright. Now then, is there or is there not a problem with Ms. Cykes's confession?Athena:\nMy memory is still a little hazy, but there's no question I remember it. I remember the weight of the weapon in my hands, and the feeling of it stabbing in deep... And I remember the warmth of her blood as it flowed down the handle onto my fingers.Phoenix:\n(There's definitely something wrong with her memory of the event. I can just tell!)Judge:\nIf there is a problem with her confession, please prove it to this court now.Present Katana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Isn't that... the katana the defendant used to kill the victim, Mr. Wright?!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nHmm... And what contradiction does that piece of evidence prove?\nPhoenix:\nWell, sometimes you have to flip or tilt a thing to get a new way of looking at it, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nAnd I suggest YOU get a new way of looking at things yourself, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch. That didn't work... Hmm... Athena said that the blood \"flowed down the handle onto my fingers\"... There's something about that that bothers me... I'd better look at the evidence again.)\nLeads back to:\n\"I hope for everyone's sake that you are not just bluffing, Mr. Wright.\"Judge:\nIsn't that... the katana the defendant used to kill the victim, Mr. Wright?!Phoenix:\nI respectfully and vehemently disagree, Your Honor!Athena:\nBut I remember it! I remember holding the weapon and getting blood on my fingers!Phoenix:\nThat's exactly my point. If blood really did get on your fingers while you were holding it... ...there should be blood on the handle. But please focus on the handle of this sword. There's not a trace of blood on it. And therefore... this is clearly a contradiction of the facts!Athena:\nYou're... You're right...Judge:\nO-Oh myyyyyyyyyyyy!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHmph. The defendant must've simply confused a portion of her memories. She mentioned it was hazy to begin with, and we can't mull over every minor detail...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut she also said, \"There's no question I remember it,\" -- a fact we can't ignore!Edgeworth:\nIn that case, why don't YOU explain what this contradiction with her memories means?Phoenix:\nG-Gladly! (Just give me a sec to think of something... I want to say that Athena didn't stab anyone... ...but she said it herself that she remembers the feeling of committing the act... Think, Phoenix. Think! What could the contradiction with Athena's memories mean?)The blood was wiped off the weapon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe blood was wiped off of the handle!\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmph.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh. I got the \"hmph\" treatment...)\nEdgeworth:\nI shouldn't have to explain the implications of your own argument to you, Wright, but... ...all your claim suggests it that Ms. Cykes wiped the blood off herself after the fact.\nPhoenix:\nI-I knew that...\nEdgeworth:\nI know that bluffing your way through things is your calling card... ...but your credibility phoned just now and told me to tell you to \"put a sock in it.\"\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Daddy...\nLeads back to:\n\"What could the contradiction with Athena's memories mean?\"The defendant used a different weapon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Cykes said blood flowed down the handle, but the katana's handle is spotless.\"Phoenix:\nMs. Cykes said blood flowed down the handle, but the katana's handle is spotless. So, doesn't it follow that the defendant must have used a weapon other than the katana?Edgeworth:\nWhat are you up to this time?Phoenix:\n(This is it. This time, I've found just the thing to end Athena's nightmare for good! The weapon that took Dr. Cykes's life was the katana. That much is for sure. So if I can show a possibility that Athena didn't use the katana... ...it could help me prove her innocent!)Judge:\nA different weapon, you say? What weapon would that be, exactly?Phoenix:\n(Right. Of course he would ask that.)Edgeworth:\nI can see you're floundering, Mr. Wright. Did you speak without thinking again, as always?Phoenix:\n(How does he do that?! But I can't back down! Not here, not now!) That's right. I did. Because it's so obvious, it doesn't require any thought.Edgeworth:\nWhat did you say?Phoenix:\n(Okay, so maybe that was an exaggeration, but there has to be something! Was there some other bladed weapon in the robotics lab that day? Maybe there's something in one of the crime scene photos... Wait a minute! There IS something! There is a high probability that THAT was in the lab! I don't have that particular weapon here in evidence right now, but... ...I DO have a piece of evidence just like it!) Other than the katana, this is another blade that may have been at the crime scene!Present Utility Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"B-But that's the murder weapon in the Clay Terran case!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nHow does that evidence suggest that there was another bladed weapon at the scene?\nPhoenix:\nWell, when you put it that way... I'm not sure.\nJudge:\nThen let me give you a little jolt to help you be sure next time!\nPhoenix:\n(That... wasn't... so... bad... Anyway! The crime scene was a robotics lab. They must have had blades of some kind! And I have something just like it in evidence!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Other than the katana, this is another blade that may have been at the crime scene!\"Judge:\nB-But that's the murder weapon in the Clay Terran case!Phoenix:\nYes. This is the knife that took Mr. Terran's life. But there must have been a knife just like this at the scene seven years ago as well. Tool kits containing utility knives like this one are issued to Space Center employees. And a robotics lab, especially, would naturally have one of these around.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nBut, besides the katana, no other bladed weapon was found at the site. It was in the investigation report, if you didn't know...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nO-Of course I knew that! (Once you told me just now...)Edgeworth:\nThen here's something else you \"already knew.\" There was a tool kit at the scene. But it didn't contain any blades. Here is a photo of its contents.Judge:\nYou're right. I don't see any kind of bladed tool.Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Fine, but isn't there something odd about the design on these handles...?)Edgeworth:\nTherefore, there was no other bladed weapon in the room.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nI disagree. This tool kit contained a knife.Edgeworth:\nAnd what proof do you have of that?Phoenix:\nDon't tell me your eye for art is failing you, too, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nYou are the last person in the world who should be criticizing my aesthetic sense!Judge:\nNow, now, he is simply watching out for your ocular health. Please proceed, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nNotice that the handles of each of these tools have a sort of design on them.Judge:\nAh, I see that they do. But what significance does that have?Phoenix:\nIt's clear that one of the tools is missing from this kit. If we rearrange the tools into a specific pattern... ...we might be able to tell which part of the overall design is missing.Edgeworth:\nHmph. Is that the theory your pitiful sense of aesthetics helped you come up with?Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth... Just let it go, man.)Edgeworth:\nShow the court, then, if you would! What pattern or design would we see if we were to rearrange the tools?Present Space Center Pamphlet or Robots with a Heart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"And what design is this supposed to represent?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere it is!\nJudge:\nThat's the design we'll see when we rearrange the tools?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. Of course, you have to have an open mind. And squinting a little helps, too.\nEdgeworth:\n............*sigh*\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh. I got the \"*sigh*\" treatment...)\nJudge:\nPlease answer seriously, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor! I'll be very serious next time! I promise! (These red and white markings... I know I've seen something like them before!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Show the court, then, if you would!\"Judge:\nAnd what design is this supposed to represent?Phoenix:\nThe GYAXA logo, Your Honor. It's on all of the Space Center's documents and pamphlets. As you're aware, GYAXA is the program that operates the Cosmos Space Center.Athena:\nLook at how brightly the GYAXA logo shines in the sunlight above the entranceway! I really dig the stars and rocket motif it's got going!Phoenix:\nGYAXA, huh? Isn't that the new name of the federal space R&D program?Judge:\nAh, I think I see it now. But...Phoenix:\nYes, with just the tools shown in this photo... ...the red \"A\" part of the logo is missing. And this is where the murder weapon from the Terran case comes into play. If we were to place the utility knife in the open slot... ...it would complete the GYAXA logo!Judge:\nSo it would! Then that means...!Phoenix:\nAdmit it, Mr. Edgeworth. My aesthetic sense is keener than yours! And while you're at it... ...admit that the weapon Ms. Cykes used could have been this one!Edgeworth:\nNnnghhhoooh!!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court!Phoenix:\nMs. Cykes confessed to having a memory of \"stabbing the victim.\" Admittedly, Ms. Cykes most likely did stab someone... using the utility knife... However, the weapon used to kill Dr. Cykes was the katana. Therefore, the act of stabbing that Ms. Cykes remembers couldn't be that of Dr. Cykes!Edgeworth:\n............ Very well. Let's suppose for a minute that Ms. Cykes did use the utility knife. Tell me............ How does that change anything?Phoenix:\n...Come again?Edgeworth:\nWhat if the katana was only being used as a decoy, to conceal the true murder weapon? What if the real weapon that took the victim's life was the utility knife?Phoenix:\nDon't be ridiculous! Or are you changing the premise of your entire argument?!Edgeworth:\nI'm merely offering a hypothetical situation derived from YOUR logic. Ms. Cykes could've put blood on the katana to make it look like the murder weapon... ...and then concealed the knife on her personage until Blackquill carried her away.Judge:\nThat does clear up the contradiction between Ms. Cykes's memories and the evidence...Edgeworth:\nIf, in fact, the murder weapon is a utility knife, then Fate has dealt you a cruel hand. For you have just proven the knife's existence to the rest of us with your own logic!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nTh-The prosecution is attempting to lead the court!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYOU'RE the one attempting to lead the court, Mr. Wright! By forcing us to forget the facts of this case. Need I remind you that there were only two people in the lab at the time of the murder? And that the defendant herself recalls stabbing someone with her own hands?Phoenix:\nNo...Edgeworth:\nIt matters not whether the murder weapon was a katana or a utility knife. As long as we know that the victim and the defendant were the only ones there... ...you cannot escape the fact that it was Athena Cykes who killed her own mother!Phoenix:\nI-I don't believe it...! Why?! Why does this keep happening?! Every time I find a contradiction, it vanishes and the suspicions keeps coming back! It's almost as if... almost as if...!Edgeworth:\nHmph. Now you're finally starting to get it. Your contradictions keep vanishing because the charge is true. And the suspicion keeps coming back to the defendant because that's where it belongs. Phoenix Wright... When will you open your eyes and accept the truth?!Phoenix:\nNgh...! NGHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!Phoenix:\nNgaaagh! (I don't want to believe it... It can't be true...) Ngh...! (But what if...?!)Judge:\nMr. Wright, you've fought a good fight. I think you've done all you can do...Phoenix:\n(Is giving up really the only option...?! No! Snap out of it, Phoenix! What's the matter with you, giving in to doubt?! I can't look back! Forward is the only way to go!) No, Your Honor, not yet! It isn't over yet!Edgeworth:\nWright!Phoenix:\n(I can't lose sight of what's important! I believe in Athena, and I'll always believe in her... to the very end! A defense lawyer never gives up on his client! I have to pick myself up and stand firm! Make that brain of yours work, Phoenix! If I don't see a way, I'll just have to go back and look for one! Time to rethink this case, thoroughly!)Phoenix:\nI concede the fact that Athena must have stabbed someone with the utility knife. This must've been what Ponco witnessed as Athena's \"hug.\" But Prosecutor Blackquill didn't see the knife at the scene. This means that someone must've removed it from the lab before he arrived. Who could have taken the utility knife from the lab?Metis Cykes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaybe Dr. Cykes was still alive, and she's the one who took the utility knife away...? ............Nah. That's definitely not it.\nLeads back to:\n\"Who could have taken the utility knife from the lab?\"Athena Cykes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBut that's the prosecution's claim! And of course Athena didn't take the knife with her! What kind of lawyer doubts his own client?!\nLeads back to:\n\"Who could have taken the utility knife from the lab?\"Someone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"A third person was at the scene\"A third person was at the scenePhoenix:\nIf I trust in Athena, then I have to conclude there was a third person at the scene. But according to Ponco's testimony, Athena and her mother were the only two there. So then, how did this third person manage to escape Ponco's detection? I know! This person must've fooled Ponco's facial recognition feature by covering...Ponco's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaybe the person covered Ponco's face so they wouldn't be recognized! But, no... In that case, Ponco wouldn't have recognized anybody, not even Athena...\nLeads back to:\n\"I know! This person must've fooled Ponco's facial recognition feature by covering...\"Their own face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The person hid their face\"The victim's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, that's not right. What good would covering the victim's face have done? Besides, that wouldn't have helped the culprit hide their identity.\nLeads back to:\n\"I know! This person must've fooled Ponco's facial recognition feature by covering...\"The person hid their facePhoenix:\nBut wait a minute. Ponco has a heartbeat detection system, too. Even if they covered their own face, Ponco would've still detected their presence. But she wouldn't have been able to tell who they were... Wait, that's it! The culprit could have covered their face and posed as which person to avoid detection?Simon Blackquill\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat if the culprit covered their face and posed as Prosecutor Blackquill? ...But Ponco already said she recognized the real Blackquill... I guess two Prosecutor Blackquills isn't the answer... Back to the drawing board...\nLeads back to:\n\"The culprit could have covered their face and posed as which person to avoid detection?\"Ponco\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat if the culprit posed as Ponco? That way, the real Ponco would just think she was looking in a mirror! ...Okay, now that's just silly. Scratch that.\nLeads back to:\n\"The culprit could have covered their face and posed as which person to avoid detection?\"Metis Cykes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The person posed as the victim\"The person posed as the victimPhoenix:\nIf the person posed as the victim... ...that would explain why Ponco thought only she and Athena were there. All they had to do was take advantage of Ponco's basic recognition features. The culprit used this in order to pose as the victim.A recording of her voice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...But then why would the culprit have gone to the trouble of hiding their face?! Let's see... Ponco can also recognize people by scanning their ID tag, if I recall... In that case...\nLeads back to:\n\"The culprit used this in order to pose as the victim.\"Her jacket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The victim's jacket\"Her katana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPonco saw the culprit holding the victim's katana and thought it was her, maybe...? Nah. Let's see... Ponco can also recognize people by scanning their ID tag, if I recall... In that case...\nLeads back to:\n\"The culprit used this in order to pose as the victim.\"The victim's jacketPhoenix:\nThe culprit could've posed as the victim by wearing her jacket with the ID tag on it! But that still leaves the heartbeat detection system. How did the culprit get around that? It wouldn't have worked if Ponco could detect the real Dr. Cykes's heartbeat, too. So does that mean that the real Dr. Cykes was already dead by that time? If that's the case, then who did Athena stab?The victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no. That's the one conclusion I DON'T want to come to. I'd better try again.\nLeads back to:\n\"If that's the case, then who did Athena stab?\"The defendant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAthena stabbed herself? What am I thinking?! Get it together and try again, Phoenix!\nLeads back to:\n\"If that's the case, then who did Athena stab?\"The real culprit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"ATHENA STABBED THE REAL CULPRIT\"ATHENA STABBED THE REAL CULPRITPhoenix:\nTh-That's it...! The person Athena stabbed wasn't Dr. Cykes. It was the person who murdered her, and then pretended to be her... The real culprit!Phoenix:\n............Edgeworth:\nNow that Mr. Wright has finally finished thinking, let us bring this to a swift end. Please give us your verdict, Your Honor, so that we can move on to hostage negotiations.Judge:\nYou are absolutely right, Prosecutor Edgeworth. I hereby--Phoenix:Phoenix:\nI didn't say I was finished -- I was only pausing for a second. Because I realized something so shocking, I had to take a break to digest it. But now, I know for a fact that............ Ms. Cykes is innocent.Athena:\nBut Ponco saw me! She witnessed the moment of the crime!Phoenix:\nYes, Ponco did witness something. She saw the \"hug\"... In other words, the moment you used the utility knife. But the person you stabbed wasn't your mother.Judge:\nWh-What are you saying, Mr. Wright?!Phoenix:\nThe answer is simple. The person Ms. Cykes stabbed... ...was a third person, posing as Dr. Cykes!Judge:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHmph. Do you really expect us to swallow that, Mr. Wright? According to the robot's statements, there was no third person there. Did you really think I wouldn't see through your ludicrous grab for time?!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nAfter all we've been through, Mr. Edgeworth, I'm disappointed. Don't you know by now that this smile of mine means I have absolute confidence?Edgeworth:\nHah! You make that pose all the time, regardless of the facts!Phoenix:\n(Clonco's strange \"malfunction\"...)Clonco:\nMr. Terran, you look pale. Shall I help you to the sickbay?Phoenix:\n\"Mr. Terran\"...? But that's Apollo you're talking to...Aura:\nOh, this Hunk of Junk here is mistaking Apollo for Clay. Maybe Apollo is possessed by Clay's ghost.Phoenix:\n(That was another case of mistaken identity cause by a jacket ID tag. All because Clonco couldn't read Apollo's facial features due to that eye patch.) Like Mr. Edgeworth said, a mask could nullify the robot's facial recognition. And then... ...all the person would have to do is wear a jacket with the victim's ID tag to pose as her!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nOf all the ridiculous theories... What good would a disguise like that do? Have you forgotten that the robot also has a heartbeat detection system? If there was a third person at the scene, the robot would have detected them!Phoenix:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth, but that doesn't count for much, I'm afraid. Because, by that time, Dr. Cykes's heart had already stopped beating.Edgeworth:\nWhat?!Judge:\nS-So does that mean...?!Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor -- the person Ms. Cykes stabbed... ...this third person who was posing as Dr. Cykes... ...is her mother's real killer!Edgeworth:\n...B-But that's... ...Im... Im... IMPOSSIBLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!Athena:\nA mask... The person I stabbed... was wearing a mask...?Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court...! Ms. Cykes? Did you say something?Athena:\nA mask...? Yes... I remember a... Aaaaaaaaaaagh!Phoenix:\nAthena...! Wh-What is it?!Athena:\nI... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!5 BLACK PSYCHE-LOCKSAthena:\nI remember a man... with a mask! How could he...?! What did he do to my mother...?! Ungh... My head...! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!Judge:\nMs. Cykes! Are you all right?!Athena:\nN-NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Phoenix:\n(The black Psyche-Locks... They're breaking!)5 LOCKS BROKENAthena:It's all coming back to me... Everything that happened the day my mother was murdered...Phoenix:\n(They're gone! The black Psyche-Locks are finally gone!) You didn't really stab your mother, did you. It's all right, Athena. Just tell us what you saw that day.Athena:\nI was... drawing a picture. When I was done, I went to show it to my mom. I opened the door... and then...! Ugh... Nghaaah...Phoenix:\nIt's all right. I'm right here. You're safe, Athena.Athena:\nShe... was on the floor, by the workbench... with the katana sticking out of her... There was a handkerchief over her face... but I knew it was her by her clothes. And... there was a man there!Judge:\nA-A man?!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nQuiet, Your Honor! Go on, Athena.Athena:\nHe tried to attack me. In a panic, I grabbed the knife that was there and... Nngh... He dodged at first, so I only got his clothes, but I tried again!Phoenix:\nAnd this time, you got him, didn't you?Athena:\nI did. I remember it clearly now. The knife went into the back of his hand. Then he kicked me, and I passed out.Utility Knife updated in the Court Record.Athena:\nWhen I came to, my mom wasn't moving. I had to do something... I had to fix her, I thought... So I asked Ponco to move her to the operating table.Something's wrong with Mom, so I'm taking her apart to fix her!Phoenix:\n(So that's why she said that...) Your Honor, as you can see, the defendant has just given us critical new testimony. A man was there before Ms. Cykes arrived! A man who covered the victim's face... ...and put on the victim's jacket! This man is the real culprit!Judge:\nMs. Cykes, do you have any idea who this man was?Athena:\n............No, I'm afraid I don't...Phoenix:\nA few moments ago, Ms. Cykes mentioned a mask. Athena, can you tell us anything else about that?Athena:\nYes...! The mask... It was my mom's Japanese theater mask! I think it was the one hanging on the wall of the lab!Judge:\nAh, this mask hanging here on the wall!Athena:\nIt was kind of spooky, that mask. My mom used to tell me... ...that a Noh mask even has the power to turn an ordinary human being into a phantom.Phoenix:\n(A ph-phantom...?)Judge:\nHmm... It would seem... ...that a new suspect has emerged. And that means all suspicion against Ms. Cykes has--Aura:Aura:\n...You see? This is precisely why I can't trust the court system. Athena Cykes is the murderer! I won't accept any other verdict!Phoenix:\nMs. Blackquill! (Th-This is not good...)Aura:\nA new suspect? Where's the proof this person ever existed? Who says it wasn't all just a dream in the little princess's groggy little head?Phoenix:\n(Ungh... She's right. We don't have any hard evidence of the masked man's existence...)Athena:Athena:\nThank you, Mr. Wright. I'll never be able to repay you for all you've done. But I'm fine now, because I can say with certainty that I didn't kill my mother.Phoenix:\nAthena... I'm so glad for you.Athena:\nMore and more memories are coming back now... so I'd like to say one thing, if I could. Ponco came to the robotics lab at about 2 PM to recharge.Ponco:\nI went to the robotics lab at about 2 PM for my regular recharge! Just as I was about to charge up, Athena came in and hugged Mommy Metis! And then Mommy Metis fell down. After that, I was recharging, so I don't know anything.Phoenix:\nI see where you're going with this. If \"Mommy Metis\" was really the killer in disguise...Athena:\nRight. Then he must have come to the robotics lab before 2 PM!Phoenix:\n(Do I have anything here in the evidence... ...that can help me find this person who came to the lab before 2 PM...?)Present Seven-Year-Old Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is Prosecutor Blackquill leaving the scene after the incident, at around 3 PM.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis piece of evidence will reveal the identity of the person who came to the lab!\nEdgeworth:\nWill it, now? Then reveal away, by all means.\nPhoenix:\nOh... um... How about if we team up for this, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nNo.\nPhoenix:\nH-How about you, Your Honor? What do you say?\nJudge:\nCertainly, I'll help you. I will help you to remember to think before you speak!\nPhoenix:\nOwww! (Tag-teamed by Lemon Juice and Paper Cut... Could an image of the culprit.. ...possibly have been captured anywhere...?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Do I have anything here in the evidence...\"Phoenix:\nThis is Prosecutor Blackquill leaving the scene after the incident, at around 3 PM. What I'm wondering is, does the video show anyone else passing by there before then?Edgeworth:\nI don't see anything in the investigation report. It looks like they didn't check.Phoenix:\nJust as I thought. So if we rewind the footage and go back to around 2 PM... ...we should be able to see the true culprit leaving the scene!Judge:\nV-Very well, then! Let's take a look!Phoenix:\nThere! Please stop it right there!Judge:\nIt's just like you said! There is a man leaving the scene of the crime!Phoenix:\nMs. Cykes... do you remember this person?Athena:\nThat's him! I'm sure of it! He... He's wearing my mother's jacket!Athena:\nI did... but what I really wanted to see was her jacket.Phoenix:\n(That jacket on display... That was Dr. Cykes's...?)Athena:\nCan you see it? There's the slash I made with the utility knife that day! And I'm sure that knife is under that jacket somewhere!Judge:\nS-So then... everything Ms. Cykes said...Phoenix:\nExactly. It proves that Ms. Cykes's memory was correct! Dr. Cykes's killer arrived at the robotics lab before 2 PM. He killed her and hid her face with a handkerchief. Then, he disguised himself with Dr. Cykes's jacket and mask that were there in the lab.Athena:\nThe culprit probably knew beforehand that Ponco charged up at 2 PM every day. So he waited for Ponco to come to the lab for her regular recharge.Phoenix:\nBy leaving Dr. Cykes's jacket on, the culprit tricked Ponco into thinking he was Dr. Cykes. Thereby, making it look like she was alive up to that point in time. All to disguise the real time of death!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nIt's a nice theory, Mr. Wright, but I'm afraid that it's just not possible.Phoenix:\nWh-What?! Why not?! The victim's jacket is clearly visible right there in this video!Edgeworth:\nAnd that right there, is precisely the problem. The ID tag on the jacket at the scene confirms beyond doubt that it belonged to the victim. If the person who left the lab truly was wearing the victim's jacket... ...then how could it possibly have wound up back at the crime scene?!Phoenix:\nHmm... (What's going on? That doesn't make sense... Edgeworth's right. If the culprit was wearing the jacket, how did it get back to the lab?)The killer brought it back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The killer used the jacket as a disguise to make his escape...\"The victim brought it back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDr. Cykes must have brought it back to the lab herself.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm afraid she would have had to come back from the dead to accomplish that feat. Care to explain to the court exactly how she managed it?\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDon't be ridiculous, Edgeworth! Everybody knows that's impossible!\nJudge:\nExactly the prosecutor's point, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nGaaaaaaagh! Your Honor, please give me another chance!\nLeads back to:\n\"Edgeworth's right. If the culprit was wearing the jacket, how did it get back to the lab?\"The defendant brought it back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Cykes brought the jacket back to the lab!\nEdgeworth:\nI see. So you're saying Ms. Cykes is an accomplice then?\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI'll believe in Ms. Cykes [sic] complete innocence... to the bitter end!\nJudge:\nWith the way things are going, it might very well be a bitter end... for the both of you.\nPhoenix:\nGaaaaaaagh! Your Honor, please give me another chance!\nLeads back to:\n\"Edgeworth's right. If the culprit was wearing the jacket, how did it get back to the lab?\"Phoenix:\nThe killer used the jacket as a disguise to make his escape... ...but in order to conceal that fact, he had to get the jacket back to the crime scene. So the culprit simply returned to the robotics lab later and planted it there. Contradiction resolved!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nExcept that it would have been impossible. The only people who came to the robotics lab after the killer were... ...Prosecutor Blackquill, and the people who reported the body. And they claimed that the jacket was there when they arrived. So! When do you propose this mysterious man of yours had the chance to return the jacket?!Judge:\nHmm... A puzzling question indeed.Phoenix:\n(When did the culprit have the chance to bring the jacket back?)When the body was found\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The only time the culprit could have returned the jacket was when the body was found.\"At the time of the murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe culprit was there at the time of the crime! He could have easily put it back then.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBut the security camera captured the man leaving with the jacket AFTER the murder. You realize you're contradicting yourself, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nOf course I do! Who do you think you're dealing with here?\nJudge:\nWell, I hope you also realize that you will now have to deal with this penalty.\nPhoenix:\nWhy can't these hurt less?!\nLeads back to:\n\"When did the culprit have the chance to bring the jacket back?\"Phoenix:\nThe only time the culprit could have returned the jacket was when the body was found.Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright, do you realize the implication of that argument?Phoenix:\nI do. Most people, when they come across a murder, focus their attention on the body. The culprit could have taken advantage of that split second to plant the jacket. In other words, the true culprit of this case, the man known as \"the phantom\"... ...was one of the first people to discover the body!Judge:\nI... I... would never have thought of that! Order! Order in the court...! Wh-What is the meaning of this, Prosecutor Edgeworth?!Edgeworth:\n............The body was discovered and reported by a group of three people. They were there to collect the space probe's capsule in preparation for the HAT-1 launch. One of those people had a special bag to transport the capsule in.Phoenix:\nOh, you mean the shock-resistant bag?Edgeworth:\nCorrect. I suppose that if the jacket was in that bag... ...it could have been returned to the scene of the crime without anyone noticing. I'll see to it that you get the reports on those three people.Phoenix:\nY-You will...?!Edgeworth:\nWe should also check the facial recognition database for that robot. If this person felt the need to hide his face with the theater mask... ...it might mean that his facial data was once registered.Judge:\nP-Prosecutor E-Edgeworth! D-Does th-this mean...?!Edgeworth:\nI have to admit, I believe Ms. Cykes's memories to be credible. ...You win, Wright... Not that this was ever an \"official\" trial anyway...Judge:\nDo my ears deceive me...? Prosecutor Edgeworth, are you actually conceding?!Athena:\nIs it true, Boss? Does this mean... I'm...?Phoenix:\n(I can't believe it! It's over! I won! I proved that both Athena and Prosecutor Blackquill are innocent!) Your Honor! I see no need to further prolong this trial!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHold on, Mr. Wright. Have you forgotten who's in charge of this trial?Judge:\nThat's right! I'M the one who's supposed to say, \"I see no need to further prolong--\"Edgeworth:\nNot you either, Your Honor. Now, silence.Aura:\n............ The little princess who was truly beloved by Metis, and who repaid that love with death-- All these years, hating Athena was the only thing that's kept me going... But what do I do now? Can anybody tell me? How am I supposed to go on?!Phoenix:\n(Ms. Blackquill...)Blackquill:\nHmph. How unlike you, Aura. Metis was deeply passionate about her work, and she chose you as her partner. Isn't that--Aura:\nShut up, Simon! You know exactly how I felt about her! Her respect as a co-worker wasn't all that I wanted!Judge:\nHmm... Then what did you want from her?Phoenix:\n(...Did you really just go there, Your Honor?!)Blackquill:\nAura, there is something I've wanted to say, if you will lend me an ear. I have in my possession, a lead on who Metis's murderer is.Phoenix:\nY-You do?!Blackquill:\nWright-dono, you asked me about the identity of \"the phantom of seven years past.\"Phoenix:\nTh-That's right. (The phantom... The person Blackquill has been looking for, even from behind bars!)Blackquill:\nSeven years ago, somebody hatched a plan to sabotage the HAT-1 rocket.Edgeworth:\nThe spy...Blackquill:\nBut he was no ordinary spy. We knew naught about him -- his background, appearance... We came to refer to him as \"the phantom.\" At the time, I was working with the police to hunt him down. And then one day, a miracle occurred, and I obtained a lead on him.Judge:\nOh, how exciting! What was the lead?Blackquill:\nA recording of the phantom's voice. But the quality was too poor for proper voice analysis. Yet, I had hope. Aura's co-worker was a scientist who could analyze human emotions... ...so I asked her to evaluate the recording using analytical psychology.Phoenix:\nAnd that scientist was... Dr. Cykes!Blackquill:\nYes. A spy's greatest fear is to have his true identity discovered. In addition to HAT-1, Dr. Cykes's results and the recording were surely among his targets. But his search of the Space Center bore no fruit, so he must have started to panic.Judge:\nHe couldn't find them? But where could they have been?!Blackquill:\nHmph. Who is to say?Phoenix:\n(Wow, I bet he's never let that out of his sight all these years.)Edgeworth:\nHow in the world did you smuggle them into prison?!Blackquill:\nOh, I have my ways. What's more, my partner is especially talented at that sort of thing. I worked to lure the phantom in by spreading rumors throughout the underworld. I was even granted permission to prosecute cases to attract the phantom's attention. \"Just TRY to retrieve your identity, you bloody butcher!\" became my taunt.Phoenix:\nAnd what about the results Dr. Cykes drew up for you? Was there any useful information?Blackquill:\nHere. You can see for yourself. But take good care of it. It's all I have left of my mentor.Phoenix:\nI-I will... (I'd better hold onto this real tight...)Phantom's Psych Profile added to the Court Record.Psychological Profile (Classified)Emotional output of this voice extremely weak compared to typical voices. Subject deemed to have unique psychological makeup with almost no emotional fluctuation.Phoenix:\n(No emotional fluctuation, huh?)Blackquill:\nA spy who experiences no emotions -- not sadness, nor anger... and naturally, no fear. He is the very definition of a phantom: a monster with no heart. Don't you see? This CREATURE is the rot that destroyed our lives, and set what ails us all into motion!Edgeworth:\n\"The phantom,\" indeed. A fitting name for the one who has brought darkness to our world.Judge:\nHmm... Well then. It seems a faint image of this man has started to take shape. Based on what we have learned, I'd like all of you to conduct further investigation. This is not a normal trial, but I do want to follow protocol. If I may, I'd like to hand down my verdicts and bring these proceedings to an end.Aura:\n...Whatever. Do what you want.Edgeworth:\nHmph. You'll hear no objections from me.Phoenix:\nYes, please, Your Honor! (It's over... It's finally over...)Judge:\nVery well. In that case... Prosecutor Blackquill, could you please take the stand? As a result of this trial, your innocence has been proven. The verdict handed down seven years ago is hereby overturned.Blackquill:\nHmph............Judge:\nAnd now, the defendant of the current trial, Ms. Athena Cykes.Athena:\nY-Yes, Your Honor! Mr. Wright... Thank you! Thank you for everything!Phoenix:\nAthena... You're more than welcome...Judge:\nIf everyone is ready, I will now give my verdict.???:Judge:\nY-You...!Apollo:\n............Phoenix:\nA-Apollo!Edgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this...?Apollo:\nCongratulations, Mr. Wright and Prosecutor Edgeworth. You uncovered the truth from seven years ago, and you saved Prosecutor Blackquill. However... ...I can't allow this trial to end just yet!Phoenix:\n(Why, Apollo? Why would you do this to us?)To be continuedDecember 20District Court - Courtroom No. 4Judge:\nMr. Justice! Please explain yourself!Apollo:\nIt's very simple. There isn't much to explain. The defendant, Ms. Athena Cykes, might not be innocent.Phoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?! The case from seven years ago has been settled!Apollo:\nI'm not talking about the past here. I'm talking about the present case. It's still not clear who killed Clay Terran.Athena:\nBut, Apollo... Why would you...?Apollo:\n...Ms. Cykes, please listen quietly to what I have to say.Phoenix:\n(What in the world is Apollo trying to do?)Apollo:\nYour Honor, please allow me a little of the court's time.Judge:\nBut... this is a trial for the case from seven years ago.Apollo:\nMs. Blackquill... I'd like to ask a favor of you. Just as you lost someone close to you, I lost someone close to me, too. I'm sure you want to know the real truth of what happened as much as I do.Aura:\nApollo............ Hee hee. Sure, you know I'm all for the truth! Now, let's see you expose the princess's guilt! Judge, I give my permission. Continue with the trial!Judge:\nV-Very well. Is that all right with you, Prosecutor Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nHmph............ The prosecution has no objections. Let's hear Mr. Justice's testimony. I'll have the police's investigation report brought immediately.Phoenix:\n(Not you too, Edgeworth... I really hope it's because you have something up your sleeve.)Judge:\nVery well. Your opening statement, please, Prosecutor Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nAs you wish. Let's review the case of the murder of Mr. Clay Terran. It was made clear in the previous trial that Solomon Starbuck was not his killer. Therefore, the true culprit was someone else. On that day, this culprit waited for the astronauts in Boarding Lounge 1. When the two men made their escape out of the Space Museum... ...the killer attacked Mr. Terran with the same type of knife that was used seven years ago. The murderer then escaped into the Space Museum. Next, Director Yuri Cosmos switched the launch pads. After that, the culprit exited the Space Museum and escaped via Boarding Lounge 2. Therefore, this trial must make clear who Mr. Terran's true killer was. In other words... ...we must discover who it was that escaped through the Space Museum that day.Judge:\nThank you, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Mr. Wright, is the defense ready?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. (I'd better rearrange my evidence...)Relevant evidence swapped in to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Justice. Your testimony, if you please.Witness Testimony-- Apollo Justice's Accusation --Apollo:\nI suspected Ms. Cykes of the murder of Clay Terran.\nMy growing suspicions were confirmed when this incriminating evidence presented itself.\nIn addition, she's the only one who could have utilized the launch pad switch to escape.\nThat is why I wish to indict Ms. Cykes on the charge of murder!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Justice, you realize you are charging your own co-worker with murder, don't you?!Apollo:\nYes, Your Honor, because that is the conclusion my investigation has led me to.Athena:\nBut, Apollo... Why? How could you suspect me, too?Apollo:\n............Mr. Wright, your cross-examination. Please.Phoenix:\n(I don't get it! Just what did you find out over the past few days to make you think this...?)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Apollo Justice's Accusation --Apollo:\nI suspected Ms. Cykes of the murder of Clay Terran.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat first made you suspicious of Ms. Cykes?\nApollo:\nIt all started when Ms. Cykes and I were investigating the crime scene. When she saw the weapon that killed Mr. Terran... ...my bracelet reacted. She said she'd never seen the knife before, but my bracelet told me otherwise. And then, every time after that... ...my bracelet would react when she talked about the case.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Apollo must've been beside himself during that investigation...)\nApollo:\nI didn't know what to do or think. I couldn't even sleep. In that condition, I knew I wouldn't be any good in court. So I decided to wear an eye patch, so I wouldn't be able to perceive any of her tells.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's why Apollo was acting so strangely...) But the reason Ms. Cykes unconsciously reacted to the knife is because... ...she stabbed her mother's murderer with one identical to it seven years ago.\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nBut that knife was also the murder weapon that was used to kill Clay Terran. My bracelet could've also reacted to her because she knew she was his killer, too.\nPhoenix:\nUngh... (I guess he has a point...)\nApollo:\nBut my bracelet wasn't the only reason I became suspicious of her...Apollo:\nMy growing suspicions were confirmed when this incriminating evidence presented itself.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's the lighter found in the Space Museum with her fingerprints on it, right? But even if it seems decisive, there must be other facts we don't know about it yet!\nApollo:\nIf that's so, go ahead and prove it, then! Look, honestly, I don't want to believe it's true, either...! But... But Ms. Cykes was the only one who was in the Space Museum at the time of the murder.\nPhoenix:\nBut, Mr. Justice! Ms. Cykes had absolutely no motive to kill Mr. Terran!\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nSeven years ago, Ms. Cykes lived at the Cosmos Space Center. It wouldn't be strange if she had some kind of connection to him. Besides, people sometimes kill for motives we can't even imagine. I know you've seen plenty of cases like that in your own career, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(I still can't believe this... How can you actually suspect Athena, Apollo?)Apollo:\nIn addition, she's the only one who could have utilized the launch pad switch to escape.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIsn't it possible that somebody else used that same escape route?\nApollo:\nI'm afraid not, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nWhy not?\nApollo:\nRecall there is a security camera in Boarding Lounge 1 aimed at the launch pad door. It's the camera that captured Mr. Terran and Mr. Starbuck. But there's also another security camera in Boarding Lounge 2. It recorded Mr. Terran's killer, or rather, Ms. Cykes coming out of the Space Museum.\nPhoenix:\nA camera in Boarding Lounge 2? (First I've heard of it, but it makes sense... Athena said she had snuck into the Space Museum the night before the incident... ...and then was overcome and passed out until around noon the next day.)\n\n\nAthena:\nI was out until about noon of the next day. I didn't even know about the explosions. When I woke up, nobody was around, so I just went out into Boarding Lounge 2.\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(That must've been when the camera captured her. And that's what made Apollo suspect her even more... But wait a minute...) In that case, it most likely recorded the true culprit as well.\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThat's a negative on that one too, Mr. Wright. In the footage taken after the incident............ Ms. Cykes is the only one who appears.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT?! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court!\nPhoenix:\n(That can't be! But if it is, then it is incredibly incriminating...)\nEdgeworth:\nWasn't it YOU who proved in the previous trial that the way the true culprit escaped... ...was via the Space Museum after the pads had been switched? Hmph. A fact you previously proved, turned on its ear, leaving your client high and dry... I must say... That is vintage Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Nghhh...)Apollo:\nThat is why I wish to indict Ms. Cykes on the charge of murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBelieving in your client to the end is a basic principle of good defense. Shouldn't you extend that same principle to your own co-worker?\nApollo:\nYou're probably right. Maybe I'm not even fit to be a lawyer... However... I don't care. This case is special to me! Clay was my friend...! And that's why I just have to know the truth...\nPhoenix:\n(Apollo suspected his trusted co-worker of killing his friend. To dispel his doubts, he investigated on his own, but that only led to more doubts. Apollo must've been really struggling with this... Well, Apollo may have doubts, but...) ...I'll say it again. Athena Cykes isn't the murderer.\nApollo:\nThen I have only one thing to say. \"Evidence is everything in court.\" Well, Mr. Wright? Think you have the concrete proof to knock down my arguments?Phoenix:\n(His points of contention are the fingerprints on the lighter, and the escape route, huh? Apollo knows how I operate, so I can't use my usual tactics on him. It looks like the only thing I can do here is press him for more information.)"

I vow to dispel every last bit of doubt in your heart!Apollo:\nGood! Because I want to believe in Ms. Cykes again!Phoenix:\n(You're really hoping there WAS an alternative route, aren't you, Apollo? But if I use the process of elimination, there really aren't that many possibilities. Director Cosmos was at the southern exit... ...leaving only the Control Room and the corridor to the Space Museum. Which door could the culprit have escaped through?)Apollo:\nCome on, Mr. Wright! Where do you think the culprit escaped to?Present Space Museum Corridor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"They really only could've escaped to the corridor to the Space Museum.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nApollo:\nThere?

Yes, I believe I can.\nPhoenix:\n...I guess you're right.\nApollo:\nWhat are you doing?! This is serious, Mr. Wright!\nJudge:\nPlease be serious, Mr. Wright!\nLeads back to:\n\"You're really hoping there WAS an alternative route, aren't you, Apollo?\"Phoenix:\nThey really only could've escaped to the corridor to the Space Museum. All they had to do was use the unconscious Mr. Starbuck's prints to get through the door.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nIt appears that all you're trying to establish is Ms. Cykes's guilt. If the culprit used that route, the only exit would have been into Boarding Lounge 2. The logical conclusion of your argument is that the killer is none other than the defendant!Phoenix:\nUngh...Apollo:\n............I knew it... That's the only way it could be, huh? If the culprit escaped into the corridor that leads to the Space Museum... ...then I guess it's true. The only exit WOULD have been into Boarding Lounge 2.Phoenix:\nBut Ms. Cykes was the only person... ...captured by the Boarding Lounge 2 security camera.Apollo:\nI investigated the crime scene thoroughly... ...but the only place the culprit could have escaped to was the Space Museum corridor. There weren't any other secret corridors or anything.Edgeworth:\nSo the leaves us with no other conclusion to draw but that Athena Cykes was the culprit.Phoenix:\n(What could the answer be? Was there really no other escape route? ............But, hold on a second. What if...? Where did those mysterious leaves we saw in the corridor come from? What if they're a clue to the culprit's real escape route...?) ............I think it IS possible that the culprit escaped into the Space Museum... ...but then came out using a route other than into Boarding Lounge 2.Apollo:\nOh?!Phoenix:\nLaunch Pad 1 and the Space Museum were switched after the bombing, meaning... ...the Space Museum corridor was moving along the rail at the time. Which is exactly when an alternative escape route opened up for our culprit!Apollo:\nA-Are you kidding me?!Edgeworth:\nHmph. Judging by the intense look in your eyes, I take it you're serious. Very well, then, Mr. Wright. Do tell. Where could the culprit have gone from the Museum corridor besides Boarding Lounge 2?Present area outside Space Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"We found something odd while investigating the Museum corridor this afternoon.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI see... So you're saying that the Space Museum corridor... ...leads to a spot somewhere in your head? What must it be like, being Phoenix Wright?\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nEdgeworth:\nAfter all, this \"alternative escape route\" seems to exist only in your mind.\nPhoenix:\nGah... (Well, I think I have a beautiful mind...!)\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps we'd better shut the security door on that corridor tightly... ...so that your ridiculous delusions don't seep out onto us.\nJudge:\nYes, shut it AND lock it, too!\nPhoenix:\n(Launch Pad 1 and the Space Museum were switched after the bombing, meaning... the Space Museum corridor was moving along the rail at the time. Which is exactly when an alternative escape route opened up for our culprit!) Please let me try that again!\nEdgeworth:\nFine. Just don't exhaust all of your mental capacities while you're at it.\nLeads back to:\n\"Where could the culprit have gone from the Museum corridor besides Boarding Lounge 2?\"Phoenix:\nWe found something odd while investigating the Museum corridor this afternoon. Namely, a few dead leaves on the floor. Considering where dead leaves come from... they point us to exactly where the culprit escaped to.Apollo:\nYes, I remember seeing some leaves myself............ Aaaaah! Do you mean...?!Phoenix:\nYup. While the Space Museum was in motion, just beyond that corridor's safety door... ...was an alternative place that the culprit could use to escape. In other words, the culprit's real escape route was... ...the area outside the Space Center!Edgeworth:\nYou'reApollo:\nFreakin'Judge:\nINSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANE!Apollo:Apollo:\nDo you know how impossible that would be?! That corridor is level with the third floor! Even if the culprit tried to leap to the outside wall of the Space Center building... ...they would fall to their death!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nOrdinarily, yes. But after the bombing incident, the culprit could make use of a certain item.Edgeworth:\nAnd what item was it, exactly, Mr. Wright?!Phoenix:\nAll right. This is what the culprit used to leap to the outside wall of the main building.Present Emergency Ladder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"An emergency ladder...?!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Why don't you demonstrate how it could've been done with that, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm, what?\nEdgeworth:\nYou're saying that the culprit used that to escape, are you not? Then why don't you show us and use that item yourself to leap to a third-floor wall!\nPhoenix:\nWell, uh... GAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\nJudge:\nI suggest a less reckless answer next time, Mr. Wright!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy don't you try one more time?\nLeads back to:\n\"All right. This is what the culprit used to leap to the outside wall of the main building.\"Edgeworth:\nAn emergency ladder...?!Phoenix:\nThere was an emergency ladder in the fourth-floor robotics lab. And it was used that day after the explosions to help evacuate people. Ms. Blackquill herself used that ladder to escape down to ground level. Recall that the launch pads were switched after the ladder was lowered. The corridor would have passed by the ladder while the pads were being switched. And that's when the culprit literally sprang into action! And leapt onto the ladder!Apollo:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Wh-Who would have imagined...?!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Well! An alternative escape route seems to have emerged!Apollo:\nWhich means someone other than Ms. Cykes could have been the culprit, right?!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nMaking things up on the fly in an attempt to sway the court again, are we, Mr. Wright? Your theory has so many holes, it puts Swiss cheese to shame!Phoenix:\nAll right, then. Name one.Edgeworth:\nI have here detailed information about the Space Center. According to this... ...the distance between the Museum Corridor and the main building during movement is... ...a full twenty feet.Phoenix:\nT-Twenty feet? You're pulling my leg, right?Edgeworth:\nIn addition, the corridor is three floors from the ground, or roughly fifty feet. What's more, the culprit would be leaping to a precarious place............ an unstable ladder.Phoenix:\nUrk.Edgeworth:\nHuman beings feel fear in dangerous situations. It's a basic survival instinct. An ordinary person would certainly hesitate before jumping... ...or even freeze in fear and not jump at all.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nB-But the culprit had just murdered someone. They weren't in an ordinary state of mind.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nNevertheless, why would they have taken that kind of risk? They could have waited for the switch to be complete and escaped to Boarding Lounge 2.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBecause there was a security camera in Boarding Lounge 2. The culprit knew they would be recorded if they left the Space Museum that way!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nIn that case, the culprit could have hidden in the museum until things settled down... ...and then blended in with the other people after the museum was opened.Phoenix:\nThat's a good point!Edgeworth:\nBut you claim that, despite all this, the culprit took a twenty-foot death-defying leap? And all in the brief moment that the corridor and ladder passed by each other?Phoenix:\nThat's... also a good point...Edgeworth:\nThey would have needed a running start while the corridor was moving to make that jump. If their timing was off or if they couldn't jump far enough, it would have been instant death. What kind of person would attempt something like that?!Phoenix:\nStop bringing up good points, Edgeworth...Edgeworth:\nThis \"true culprit\" of yours is nothing but a figment of your imagination!Phoenix:\nWhy do you always have to point out every flaw?!?!?!Apollo:\nMr. Edgeworth's right -- that does sound pretty insane. The culprit would have to be someone who feels no fear, like a stuntman.Phoenix:\n(But everyone feels fear on some level, right? ............Wait a minute! Aha! I've got it this time!) I can prove that there is someone who could've used this alternate escape route!Edgeworth:\nOh, can you now?Phoenix:\nThis proves the possibility of a person who could've used this alternative escape route!Present Phantom's Psych Profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What's that, Mr. Wright?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis should clear everything up!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Clearly not.\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYes, it does! It even suggests the possibility of a third or fourth escape route!\nJudge:\nThe only thing this suggests to me is YOU need an escape route out of life.\nPhoenix:\nGah! (That didn't work... Didn't I have some evidence that proves the existence of somebody without fear...?)\nLeads back to:\n\"This proves the possibility of a person who could've used this alternative escape route!\"Apollo:\nWhat's that, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nThis is a certain person's very interesting psych profile. \"The subject... doesn't experience feelings like normal people do.\" In other words, this person doesn't feel happiness, sadness, or fear.Apollo:\nDoesn't feel... fear?Edgeworth:\n............W-Wright...! You can't be serious?!Phoenix:\nWithout the constraint of fear... ...he could easily do what an ordinary person wouldn't dare! Just as you or I could do a broad jump on the ground without the slightest fear... ...this \"subject\" could make a twenty-foot leap, fifty feet up in the air. He could choose this extreme way of escaping without hesitation!Apollo:\nSo you're saying that to a person without fear... ...the alternative route would be quicker and eliminate the chance that they'd be spotted? That's definitely pretty extreme, Mr. Wright!Judge:\nBut was there such a person at the scene?Phoenix:\nYes, the phantom, that mysterious, shadowy figure who keeps popping up...Judge:\nOh dear!Edgeworth:\nThe phantom... again...?!Phoenix:\nI knew the phantom was there behind the scenes of the Space Center bombing. But I wasn't sure if he was connected to the murder of Clay Terran as well. However, now it's all clear! The phantom is the one who not only bombed the Space Center, but also killed Mr. Terran!Edgeworth:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA--Apollo:\n--AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Judge:\nOrder in the court! Order, I say! M-Mr. Wright, please continue!Phoenix:\nThere were just too many similarities between this case and the one from seven years ago. \"But why?\" you may ask. It can only be because both incidents are the work of the same phantom!Apollo:\nSo then, this \"phantom\"... is the one who killed Clay...?! But who IS he?!Phoenix:\n(This phantom has been haunting this case, pulling the strings in the background... Who could this unidentified, international spy be?)Edgeworth:\nWright, this escape route must've been a part of the phantom's plan from the start. As was tricking Director Cosmos into switching the launch pads. The bomb on the second floor was meant to make the elevators and stairs unusable. That's why he gave advance warning and planted the bombs where he did.Phoenix:\nYes, I think you're right. ............But it doesn't explain this one last thing.Aura:\nSo I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to. But it was such a pain. Why couldn't they have used the ladders in the other rooms?Phoenix:\nThe robotics lab wasn't the only room with an emergency ladder. But he couldn't have made that leap unless he was certain which one it would be.Apollo:\nSo, you mean... ...the phantom was someone who knew that particular ladder was going to be used?Phoenix:\nThat's right.Judge:\nHmm... Who could it be?Phoenix:\n............Wait a minute...\"So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to.\"Phoenix:\nMs. Blackquill lowered the ladder... after being told to by the detective leading the...? ............AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Y-You've gotta be kidding me!)Edgeworth:\nDid you figure it out, Wright? Do you know who the phantom is?!Phoenix:\nYes, I do...Apollo:\nWh-Who is it?! Who killed Clay?!Phoenix:\n(Our mystery spy, known as the phantom, is none other than...!)Present Bobby Fulbright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"After the explosions, a member of the staff crossed paths with a certain detective.\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nUnbelievable! This person is the spy?!\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. We were all completely fooled!\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, please don't be fooled by Mr. Wright here. He picked that person without putting any thought into it at all.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! How dare you take me for a foolishly foolish fool! Unacceptable!\nPhoenix:\nBut I don't, Your Honor! And I'll prove it! (After the explosions, somebody gave the order to lower that emergency ladder. That person is the phantom!) I promise to reveal who the phantom is this time, Your Honor!\nLeads back to:\n\"Our mystery spy, known as the phantom, is none other than...!\"After the explosions, a member of the staff crossed paths with a certain detective.\"I was on duty on the fourth floor. It was quite the madhouse, I tell you!\"Phoenix:As for the detective who was leading the evacuation from the fourth floor... ...he had a very specific objective in mind.\"So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to.\"Phoenix:His objective was to secure his own escape route!\"We lowered an emergency ladder from a fourth floor window and escaped that way. Once everyone else got out safely, I made my way down too, and headed to the shelter.\"Phoenix:This is a detective you all know. He's even the lead detective on the current case... He appears to be a very emotional man, but his psych profile says he is without emotion.Edgeworth:\nWhat?! Are you saying...?!Apollo:\nY-You mean the phantom is...?!Judge:\nD-Detective Bobby Fulbright?!Phoenix:\nExactly. We were all taken in by his fake persona. Detective Fulbright's real identity is the phantom!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court...! Mr. Wright! How could this be?Phoenix:\nThat's easy, Your Honor. Detective Fulbright was leading the fourth floor evacuation effort. Our first clue is that he made no attempt to have any other ladder put to use. The ladder in the robotics lab is the only one he ordered to be lowered. The second is that he directed everybody to the basement shelter via this ladder.Edgeworth:\nVerily! It was all a part of his plan to create an escape route!Phoenix:\nAfter Detective Fulbright saw to it that the ladder was lowered from the robotics lab... ...he went to the lounge, where he killed Clay Terran, and escaped into the Space Museum. The Museum started moving, slowly, so he waited for the right time, got a running start... And just as the corridor was passing the ladder... he leaped onto it!Edgeworth:\nGrr... I don't believe it... That addlepated detective did all that...?!Apollo:\nWas it really him...? I mean, all this time, I thought...Apollo:\nSorry, we didn't catch your name.Fulbright:\nMy name? I'm Bobby Fulbright! The heroic detective who defends our good citizens from evil! The champion of justice who comes running whenever you're in need! And my catchphrase? It's \"In justice we trust!\"Athena:\nThen... his concern for Simon... was also all just one big act...?Fulbright:\nI swore to reform Prosecutor Blackquill and make him a valued member of society again... ...so I can't just sit by and watch him give in to his emotions, and tear the defendant apart!Apollo:\nTHAT monster killed Clay?! He--! He had me completely fooled! Come to think of it, he's the one who brought that bloodstained lighter to court, too! The scumbag even made me turn on Athena! Damn it! How the hell did I fall for all that?!Edgeworth:\nFor him to have wormed his way into the police department as well... Nnrgh!Phoenix:\nYour Honor, the defense demands to question Detective Bobby Fulbright!Judge:\nHmm... Yes, I agree that we need to hear from him right away. The court will take a short recess, and then Detective Fulbright will take the stand!December 20, 5:23 PMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 5Athena:\nThank you so much, Mr. Wright! If it wasn't for everything you did, I... I...Phoenix:\nDon't thank me yet. We still have an uphill battle to fight.Athena:\nYou got it, Boss!Apollo:\n............Athena:\nA-Apollo...! ............Phoenix:\n(Ugh... Well, this is awkward...)Apollo:\nAthena, can you do me a favor?Athena:\nHuh? What is it?Apollo:\nCould you............ punch me, please?Athena:\nWh-What?! Why should I do that?!Apollo:\nBecause I should've believed in you! I let the seed of doubt inside me get the best of me. I'm really sorry that I didn't trust-- OUCH!Athena:\nDon't be such a dope! I was really touched by what you did!Apollo:\n............Huh? Now what are YOU talking about?Apollo:\nI... I want to believe in Athena. I really do. But what is faith without doubt? That's why... I need to question her guilt! So that once the truth finally comes out, I can really, fully trust her!Athena:\nYou took the time and effort to genuinely think about who I am and what I'm made of... After all that, how could I punch a true friend like you, Apollo?Phoenix:\n(You didn't have any trouble slapping him a second ago...)Apollo:\nThanks, Athena. And thanks for waking me up to reality again.Phoenix:\n(Guess I know now who to call if I ever get sleepy in court...)???:\nIt looks like you have some promising young people working under you.Phoenix:\n...Edgeworth. Yeah. I think they're pretty great, myself. (And they're not afraid to keep me in line...)Edgeworth:\nAnyway, I have some very good news. Aura Blackquill has surrendered and the hostages have been set free.Phoenix:\nTrucy and all the others...?! Oh, thank goodness!!!Edgeworth:\n............Ms. Blackquill said she had something she really needed to do. So I granted her special permission to do what she must.Phoenix:\nI wonder what it is? Ms. Blackquill!Aura:\n............I didn't come to apologize, if that's what you're thinking. My actions are what allowed the truth of what happened seven years ago to come to light. But I did come because I had something to say to all of you.Clonco:\nMiss Aura...Phoenix:\n(She'd better not be here to complain about something...)Edgeworth:\n............Ms. Blackquill, I want to apologize to you. The fact that you couldn't trust the court system is our fault.Aura:\nHa ha ha! Yes, it's true the courts are filled with incompetent idiots. Still... I suppose I could let you handle the rest of this case for me.Clonco:\nOh, Miss Aura! Does this mean you're starting to trust the system again?!Aura:\nNo, of course not! Be quiet, Hunk of Junk! It's just... I wouldn't mind if you were the ones who took Metis's killer down.Apollo:\nLeave it to us! We'll get him!Phoenix:\n(So I guess that means she's starting to trust US at least...)Blackquill:\n...Aura.Aura:\nSimon. I'm so glad both you and the princess were cleared of all suspicion. And it's all thanks to me and my robots. You'd better be grateful.Blackquill:\nHmph. I never imagined you would go that far... though you always were extreme. But I don't recall ever requesting your help.Aura:\nAs closed as ever, I see. Well, now that you've been released, I guess it's my turn to go live in the slammer. I just hope you're not the prosecutor for my trial. You'd probably give me the death penalty.Blackquill:\n...Hmph. You know me all too well.Phoenix:\n(I guess love can take on a variety of expressions, including stunted in their case...)Blackquill:\n............But I truly was about to be executed tomorrow. Though, because of you, it looks like I won't be crossing the Styx just yet. ............You have my heartfelt thanks, Aura. I'm sorry I caused you so much anguish.Aura:\nSimon... ............ *sniffle* I'm so glad, Simon. So very glad to hear you say that...Blackquill:\nAura...Aura:\n...All right. That's enough of that... Bailiff, take me to the Detention Center.Phoenix:\n(What Ms. Blackquill did was inexcusable... ...but it's clear she did it out of love for her brother...)Athena:\nI still can't wrap my mind around Detective Fulbright being the phantom...Apollo:\nI...! I can't believe he killed Clay!Blackquill:\nRight. And murdered my mentor, which brought great distress upon little Athena. ......Chief Prosecutor.Edgeworth:\nYes...?Blackquill:\nI would ask a favor. Would you allow me to stand at the prosecutor's bench for this trial? I wish to claim the phantom's head by my own hand.Edgeworth:\n...Hmph. That was my plan all along. After all... ...it's highly unconventional for a man of my position to stand in court.Blackquill:\n............Sir...Edgeworth:\nThe formal paperwork has yet to be filed, but you are hereby conditionally released. Please take the prosecutor's bench in your official capacity... ...and uncover the truth by your own hand.Blackquill:\nI'm much obliged... ...The day to part with these has come at last. Chief Prosecutor... could you?Blackquill:\n............ ............How long have I waited. Maybe it's the sense of freedom, but even the air seems fresher, the light, brighter... And I will relish slashing that blackguard Fulbright to shreds without mercy.Phoenix:\n(I don't have to be able to read his heart to see how happy he is...)Athena:\n*sniffle* I'm so glad! But I won't... cry just yet! After all, we've still got a trial to finish!Phoenix:\n(It's okay to cry, Athena. I promise.)Apollo:\nProsecutor Blackquill... Mr. Wright... Please avenge Clay's death for me.Phoenix:\nWhat are you talking about, Apollo? You're coming to the defense's bench with me.Apollo:\nI am?!Phoenix:\nWell, I can't expect Athena to assist me, now can I? She's the defendant. That leaves you, Apollo.Apollo:\nBut... Are you sure you want me...? I... I took a leave of absence and everything...Phoenix:\nWell, our office is pretty short-handed, and you're all I've got.Apollo:\nTh-Thank you, Mr. Wright!Athena:\nApollo.Apollo:\nAthena, I can say it with all my heart now. I believe in your complete innocence. And now we're going to prove it to the world!Athena:\n...Thank you, Apollo! I know you can do it!Anime cutscene\nPhoenix:\nSo... you won't be needing that eyepatch anymore, right?Apollo:\nRight! Because I'm fine now.Phoenix:\nNow THIS is the Apollo I know!Athena:\nWelcome back, Apollo!Edgeworth:\nIt's almost time for the trial to restart, though it looks like you have things well in hand.Phoenix:\nYup.Edgeworth:\nI should head back to the Prosecutor's Office.Athena:\nBut why?Edgeworth:\nI want to look into a few things. Namely... ...the first people on the scene seven years ago, the facial data registered by the robot... ...and Detective Fulbright's background.Phoenix:\nSounds great, Edgeworth. Thanks.Edgeworth:\nI expect to be repaid with a victory, Wright. Now, if you'll excuse me.Phoenix:\nOkay, you two all set to go?Apollo:\nYou bet I am!Athena:\nLet's do this!Phoenix:\n(This is it, the final battle!

(Although, back then, I thought you were more loud than you were reliable...) You've really come a long way since then, Apollo. You've grown a lot.Apollo:\nWell, there have been some hiccups, but I guess I've done pretty well.Phoenix:\n(He's still got that ego of his, though.)Judge:\n............Prosecutor Blackquill. With the seven-year mistake now resolved, you can finally take your rightful place... ...! Um, yes, I guess we can keep the chitchat for later...! B-Bailiff, please bring in the witness immediately!Apollo:\nEven with those handcuffs off, Prosecutor Blackquill seems to be pretty much the same.Phoenix:\nSeven years of grumpiness doesn't go away so easily, I guess.Fulbright:\nHa ha ha ha! Bobby Fulbright here! I heard I was needed on the stand so I here I am!Judge:\nDetective Fulbright... Do you know why you have been called to give testimony?Fulbright:\nYup! 'Cause there is only one reason why I'd be called! And that is, because it's time for justice! In justice we trust!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYou can't fool us with that act anymore! Your \"justice\" is nothing but lies!Fulbright:\nWhat?! Are you questioning the integrity of my sense of justice?! ............I mean, sure, sometimes I make mistakes, but hey...Apollo:\n............He's acting exactly the same as always.Phoenix:\nTell me about it. He must be feeling awfully confident...Blackquill:\n............Fool Bright, if you wish to dispel our suspicions, then let's get to your testimony.Fulbright:\nAll right. Fine! You want me to prove my righteousness? I can certainly do that!Witness Testimony-- The Embodiment of Justice --Fulbright:\nHa ha ha ha! I am the very embodiment of justice itself!\nI won't have you make me into a villain with your far-fetched arguments!\nAnd this bit about the escape route is only a theory -- you don't have any proof!\nWhat we DO have is proof that Athena Cykes is the culprit: this lighter with her prints on it!Judge:\nHmm... So you're saying the suspicions against you are completely false? And that the defendant is the real culprit?Fulbright:\nTh-That's right. Mr. Lawyer's escape route is totally circumstantial! He doesn't have any proof that I made a big leap onto a ladder!Blackquill:\nWe don't have proof. You are correct about that. However, you don't have any proof for your claim, either.Fulbright:\nNgaaagh! I-I guess you're right. But you can't define justice with evidence. Who can define it, anyway? Justice... just is!Apollo:Apollo:\nD-Don't make me......... break out a dictionary on you!Fulbright:\nNgaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Please, don't throw the book at me!Apollo:\nUgh... Tell me the phantom didn't just make me set up a stupid pun for him.Phoenix:\n...Let's just try not to lose focus, all right?Fulbright:\nBut my justice is crystal clear! What's not clear are your eyes! Wake up and smell the justice!Blackquill:Fulbright:\n!Blackquill:\nEnough of your rubbish, Fool Bright. If you have even an ounce of justice, then you will answer the court's questions and prove it!Fulbright:\n............Prosecutor Blackquill?Apollo:\nProsecutor Blackquill looks torn.Phoenix:\nWell, Fulbright was his partner after all.Judge:\nHmm... Prosecutor Blackquill is right. The truth will be revealed in the cross-examination. The suspicions against Detective Fulbright are, at this point, only suspicions. As is my duty, I will judge the claims against the detective as impartially as I can. Does anyone have any objections?Phoenix:\nThat's fine, Your Honor.Fulbright:\nHa ha ha ha! Now, ask away and don't hold back!Judge:\nWell, there don't appear to be any objections. Very well, Mr. Wright.

Then, after the launch pads were switched, she ran out of the Space Museum... ...where her image was caught by the security camera!\nPhoenix:\n(Without evidence I should probably save this fight for another time...)Fulbright:\nThree prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo three prints from a right hand were found on the lighter, huh? Are you certain of this?\nFulbright:\nI'd stake my life on it!\nApollo:\nMr. Wright, isn't it odd he's saying the prints are from Athena's right hand?\nPhoenix:\nWhy would you say that?\nApollo:\nWell, think about it for a sec. Athena always wears that glove on her right hand, right? So there's no way she'd leave prints of those three fingers from her right hand.\nPhoenix:\nHey, great point! (Why didn't I catch that one?) Detective Fulbright! I'm sure you heard our discussion just now. About how Ms. Cykes always wears a glove on her right hand!\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Well, I have only one thing to say to that! Do you have any evidence that she was wearing that glove at the time of the incident?\nPhoenix:\n............I guess we don't.\nFulbright:\nIf you want to prove the defendant innocent, you'll have to ask better questions than that.\nPhoenix:\n(Like I need a lecture from you, Smiles McGoo...

And across the room on the opposite wall... ...is a large mirror.Phoenix:\nHmm... I do remember seeing it... ............Aaaah! So are you saying...?!Fulbright:\nYes, the culprit Ms. Blackquill saw must have been a reflection of that person in the mirror.Judge:\nAh, I see. In that case, right and left would appear reversed, wouldn't they?Fulbright:\nHa ha ha ha ha! Now do you see?! That's the logic of pure justice!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut your argument is only conjecture! You don't have any proof that what Ms. Blackquill saw was a reflection--Blackquill:Blackquill:\nWright-dono, you'd sooner nick yourself than him like that. Put some more muscle into it.Phoenix:\nHuh?Fulbright:\nHa ha ha ha! That's right! Besides, the lighter couldn't have been in the left hand!Phoenix:\nAnd why not?Fulbright:\nMs. Blackquill said she saw an Earth emblem on the lighter, didn't she? That emblem is only on one side of the lighter.Phoenix:\n...You're right. There's no emblem on the other side.Fulbright:\nExactly! As blank and smooth as the judge's fine scalp! If the culprit had held the lighter in their left hand, they would've covered the emblem.Phoenix:\nUh oh...Fulbright:\nWhat's more, this is the kind of lighter you flick open with your thumb before lighting. So if the culprit had held it in their left hand with the emblem out and visible... ...they wouldn't have been able to open it, let alone light it. But if they had held it in their right hand, they could easily open it and light it. This all means that the culprit was definitely holding the lighter in their right hand!Phoenix:\nNoooooooooooooooooooooo! (Come baaack, my beautiful contradiction!)Blackquill:\n...Hmph. It appears you've planted a flower that bears no fruit.Fulbright:\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha! See how it withers before my flower of justice?!Phoenix:\nHe's tough! He's managed to discredit almost everything I've proven up this point...Fulbright:\nIn justice we trust! Now do you see? I'm not this \"phantom\" you've been talking about. I mean, are you sure there really is a spy? I bet they're just a figment of your imagination! *sob* Oh, it's so sad! So very sad! But I'm afraid Ms. Cykes is the culprit!Apollo:Apollo:\nDetective Fulbright, I believe you said... ...that the emblem is only on one side of the lighter. Are you sure about that?Fulbright:\nHmm? Of course I'm sure! Why don't you take a look for yourself and see? Do YOU see an Earth emblem on both sides of the lighter?BRACELET THUMPSApollo:\n............I knew it. You're lying, Detective.Fulbright:\nP-Pardon me?Phoenix:\nYou mean...?Apollo:\nYes, my bracelet reacted to his statement about the emblem. He's definitely hiding something big. And I think if we use my talent, we might be able to figure it out.Blackquill:\nJustice-dono, are you to use that cheat of yours again?Apollo:\nIt's not cheating, Prosecutor Blackquill!Blackquill:\nHmph. Very well. Whether I like it or not, I suppose we should use whatever works right now. Go on, then.Phoenix:\nWe have Prosecutor Blackquill's reluctant blessing, apparently. Okay, Apollo, you're up!Apollo:\nHere goes, then...! Detective Fulbright, could you repeat that last statement one more time?Fulbright:\nWhat in the world are you up to? Hmm............ All right. Fine. I'll say it as many times as you like! Listen carefully! The Earth emblem is only on the side that you can see when held in the right hand.Perceive left thumb on holster on \"The Earth emblem\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Fulbright, you might not be aware of it yourself, but...\"Perceive wrong area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAha! I spy a nervous tic!\nFulbright:\nA tick? Maybe I should squash it then!\nApollo:\n(That's not the kind of tic I had in mind...) Um, could you please repeat your statement?\nLeads back to:\n\"I'll say it as many times as you like! Listen carefully!\"Apollo:\nDetective Fulbright, you might not be aware of it yourself, but... ...whenever you say the phrase \"The Earth emblem,\" your left thumb moves. In fact, it appears as though you're running it along the edge of your holster.Fulbright:\nM-Mr. Lawyer, I don't have the foggiest notion what you're talking about.Apollo:\nBe that as it may, I know it has something to do with the lighter. Let me examine it.Fulbright:\nBut why? You're not making any sense! You can't just--Blackquill:Blackquill:\nHmph! Be still and do as you're told, Fool Bright. If you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't mind them having a look-see, should you?Fulbright:\nWhat...?! Not you too, Prosecutor Blackquill...!Judge:\nHmm... I'm not sure what this is all about, but if Prosecutor Blackquill insists... ...it must be something important. I will allow the defense to examine the lighter.Fulbright:\n............Nnnghhh...Apollo:\nGood! Now maybe we'll learn something new!Phoenix:\nI hope so. Now, let's check every inch of this thing.Examine bloodstains on front\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nHmm. It's hard to tell if the prints are from a right hand or a left just by looking.\nPhoenix:\nI don't think looking at each print with the naked eye will tell us anything new. But this lighter definitely hides a secret...\nApollo:\nI agree. Let's check it out carefully.Examine bloody prints on back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUgh... The back is covered with blood.\nApollo:\nSay, do you notice anything funny about this bloodstain?\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. It suddenly breaks off unnaturally.\nApollo:\nSupposedly, the lighter was held with the right hand so that the emblem was visible. If so, the prints should be around the emblem and on the lid where you open it.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. There's definitely something off here.Examine top of lid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't see anything unusual about the top of the lid.\nApollo:\nBut Detective Fulbright's words were definitely hiding something. Let's look for something that has to do with what he said.Examine moon emblem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a moon here in relief.\nApollo:\nI guess it's designed to go with the Earth. If anything is suspicious about this lighter, it's probably in this area...\nPhoenix:\nI don't see anything add about this, though.Examine Earth emblem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"So this is the Earth emblem Detective Fulbright was talking about.\"Phoenix:\nSo this is the Earth emblem Detective Fulbright was talking about.Apollo:\nSee anything noteworthy?Phoenix:\n...Huh? H-Hey! Look at this! The emblem's actually some kind of button!Apollo:\nWow! It transformed... into something...Phoenix:\nA handle, a trigger. Is this what I think it is...?Blackquill:\n............There's no question, it seems. What you have there is a gun.Judge:\nA WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Phoenix:\nA gun............ So that's it. Your Honor, please recall this morning's trial, when Director Cosmos was on the stand. The bullet that hit the oxygen tank was extremely small, maybe a .10 caliber. This little compact gun probably takes bullets of that caliber.Apollo:\nIt looks like this is the gun that was fired at the scene.Judge:\nI'm flabbergasted! The lighter... was a gun?!Phoenix:\nSo when Detective Fulbright would touch his holster...Apollo:\nThat's right. Whenever he mentioned the Earth emblem... ...he must have subconsciously thought about the secret behind the lighter. In other words, he knew it was a gun from the very beginning.Fulbright:\n............Apollo:\nA lighter that transforms into a gun seems like a spy gadget to me. It's not the kind of thing any ordinary person can get their hands on. In fact, I'd say it's strictly in the domain of elite spies! Detective Fulbright, you WILL explain yourself!Fulbright:\n............ Ha ha ha ha ha! There's nothing for me to explain! I didn't know the lighter could transform! I mean, it was found in the Space Museum, and then I brought it straight in! ............I didn't even have time to check it out.Apollo:Apollo:\nWhenever you mentioned the Earth emblem, you touched your holster! You subconsciously did that because you knew it was a gun!Fulbright:\nAccuse me all you want, but where is your proof?! Do you have any evidence that I knew the lighter was a gun?Apollo:\n...Not exactly...Fulbright:\nAnd whose prints are on it? Ms. Cykes's prints! It proves that she's the culprit who fired the gun at the scene!Apollo:\nArgh!Judge:\nI-It would appear that the detective is right...Fulbright:\nAre you guys really trying to prove your client innocent or what?! ...Although it pains me to do this, now that we are where we are... ...I have to make the following assertions, coming from the prosecution's side. The person who fired the gun at Director Cosmos in the lounge after the incident... ...and the person Ms. Blackquill saw holding the lighter... ...and the person who murdered Mr. Terran... ...and the person who bombed the Space Center... ...are all the defendant, Athena Cykes! The prints on the lighter are decisive proof!Apollo:\nNoooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Fulbright:\nHa ha ha! Now do you see? A man on the side of justice couldn't possibly be the culprit! And I think this about sums up Ms. Cykes's part in the whole affair.Judge:\nThe evidence certainly does seem to point to the defendant's guilt. Do you have anything to say, Prosecutor Blackquill?Blackquill:\n...Evidence is everything in court. Therefore, Fool Bright's claims... stand firm.Apollo:\nB-But...!Phoenix:\nCalm down, Apollo. He's just saying that because he has to as the prosecutor.Fulbright:\nMr. Lawyer, our job is to pursue criminals in the name of justice! You shouldn't cast suspicion on people based on something as dubious as a habit! In fact, you have a bad habit of showing up in court with an awful case of bed head!Apollo:Apollo:\nSays the man who wears sunglasses at night. If it's proof you want, it's proof you'll get! I'll prove that lighter is not Ms. Cykes's, but yours!Fulbright:\nHmm?Phoenix:\nSounds like you've hit on something, Apollo.Apollo:\nIt's just, if the prints on the lighter are the basis for accusing Athena... ...I think we should reconsider the credibility of the evidence itself.Phoenix:\nYou mean, you think this lighter might be forged evidence?!Apollo:\nThat's right. It could all be part of Fulbright's bigger plot. Did he do anything out of the ordinary while I was off on my own?Phoenix:\n...I can definitely think of a few things.Fulbright:\nIt is, indeed! Have a look at this!Judge:\nWhat's this? A lighter?Athena:\nDetective, we'd like to run a comparison on some prints we found in the boarding lounge.Fulbright:\nAh, yes! I just happened to have compiled the print data of everyone related to this case! I can always make another copy for myself, so it's all yours! Consider it a gift.Phoenix:\n(If we assume he's been laying a big trap for us all along... There's gotta be something off about this piece of evidence. What's wrong with the lighter as a piece of evidence?)How the prints were left on it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I guess I don't see anything strange about how the prints were left on the lighter... Nothing unusual about the angle of the prints or how they are patchy in places, but...)\nLeads back to:\n\"There's gotta be something off about this piece of evidence.\"The owner of the prints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Are they really Athena's fingerprints?\"Where the prints are on it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Anything odd about where the prints are? No, I guess if it was fired as a gun... ...that's about where the prints would be, but...)\nLeads back to:\n\"There's gotta be something off about this piece of evidence.\"Phoenix:\n(Are they really Athena's fingerprints? They definitely matched her print data... Hmm... But what about the data itself...?) Detective Fulbright, you were the one who provided us with the lighter and print data... ...isn't that correct?Fulbright:\n............Yes. What about it?Phoenix:\nYou say Ms. Cykes's prints matched the print data... ...but I have to wonder, was the data you used official?Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Are you suggesting that the evidence might have been fabricated?!Phoenix:\nI guess there's only one way to find out. Let's re-examine the prints... ...using the official, sanctioned print data of the people involved in this case.Fulbright:\nWhat?! You dare insult the epitome of justice and integrity?! There's no need for such antics!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nYour Honor, I lend my voice to the defense's request. You must allow the test to be re-run.Judge:\nVery well, then... Bailiff!Judge:\nAh! It appears that the official data is here.Phoenix:\nAnd the results?Judge:\nHmm... Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm............ It's... It's just as the defense claims... This proves that the prints on the lighter do not belong to the defendant!Fulbright:\nNGAAAAAAAAAH!Phoenix:\nYes!Judge:\nThe fingerprints actually belong to the victim, Mr. Clay Terran.Lighter updated in the Court Record.Apollo:\nThey were Clay's fingerprints on the lighter...?Blackquill:\nAh, I see. Come to think of it... ...wasn't it you, Fool Bright, who collected the victim's prints?Fulbright:\nI personally removed his glove during the investigation. We had to get his fingerprints to confirm his identity, after all.Blackquill:\nWhen you took the deceased's fingerprints... ...you could have easily planted his prints on the lighter with his blood. After which, you wiped the blood off of his hand.Fulbright:\nNgaaah.Phoenix:\nBy your own admission, you were also the one who compiled the phony print data. All to put the blame on Ms. Cykes!Fulbright:\nNGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!Phoenix:\nThis ploy must've been to distract us from the phantom who was behind everything. You were out to create the impression that the phantom wasn't the true culprit.Judge:\nS-So does this mean... Detective Fulbright really IS the phantom?Phoenix:\nRemember the killer's escape route. No ordinary person... ...would have been fearless enough to attempt it. Nobody but the phantom -- the man with no emotions -- could've done it.Fulbright:\nNGAAAAAAAAAGH!Phoenix:\nDetective Fulbright, you were the only one who could've used that escape route.Fulbright:\nNgaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! I... I...!Blackquill:\nFool Bright! Are you really the phantom?Fulbright:\n............Blackquill:\nAnswer me, or so help me I will slash you to tiny slivers where you stand!Fulbright:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! All right! All right! I'll talk! I-I confess. ............I... I'm not the phantom.Blackquill:Blackquill:\nIt's all over. Now be a man and admit it already!Fulbright:\nB-But I'm not a spy! ............I'm an undercover investigator. I've actually been after the phantom myself.Judge:\nAn under-the-cover investigator...? That sounds less than wholesome to me...Blackquill:\n...A person who hides his identity and secretly investigates in order to uncover information. And that's what you really are, Fool Bright?Fulbright:\nThat's right, I was working to track down the phantom... But, sadly... ...even though I was supposed to catch the spy, the spy ended up catching me. He took my family hostage and forced me to cooperate with him.Judge:\nWhat?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYou're telling us this NOW?! But if what you say is true, then... ...who was the mystery person Ms. Blackquill and Mr. Starbuck saw?Fulbright:\nIt was the phantom, I tell you! All I did was help him by having that emergency ladder lowered for him!Apollo:Apollo:\nI don't believe you! Then how do you explain the fabricated lighter?!Fulbright:\nThat was also one of the phantom's demands. Being the detective in charge of the case, it was easy for me to fabricate evidence. Pinning the crime on Athena Cykes was just another one of the phantom's orders!Apollo:\nAnd you expect me to buy that?!Blackquill:\n...Fool Bright, what was the phantom's ultimate objective?Fulbright:\nI was told it was to sabotage the rocket launch. ...Someone who didn't want the launch to happen must've given him the order.Blackquill:\n............Fulbright:\nActually, I have to apologize to you, too. The phantom told me to get close to you. He ordered me to get back that psych profile you have on him.Blackquill:\n............So, he sent a buzzard of his own to tail me this past year, did he?Fulbright:\nI... I haven't been a champion of justice... ............I've just been a pawn of evil... ...a pawn of the phantom who stole the moon rock and killed Dr. Cykes seven years ago...Blackquill:\n...Enough, Fool Bright. Just tell us the phantom's true identity.Fulbright:\nI don't know. He was very careful to hide it. He has top secret information for all kinds of corporations and countries... ...so there's a number of organizations that want him dead. If people believed I was the phantom... ...I could be killed on the spot! Why, I bet even now... ...there are assassins lurking nearby! This case is about the phantom after all.Blackquill:\n...With the ceiling blown off, I suppose you are vulnerable to a sniper's shot in this courtroom.Phoenix:\n(Just two seconds ago, Fulbright was treating Athena like a criminal... Does he really think he's going to lie his way out of it now?)Apollo:\nBut on the surface, everything does seem to make sense. This could be bad, Mr. Wright, if we can't find a flaw in his logic!Phoenix:\n(He's right! After we've come all this way, we can't let Fulbright wriggle free now!)Fulbright:\nThere. I finally told the truth.Now I hope you see how foolish it was to think I was the phantom!Fulbright:\nYou're an intelligent man, Prosecutor Blackquill. You believe me, right?Blackquill:\n............I believe you. I don't think you're the phantom.Phoenix:\nWhat?! How can you say that, Prosecutor Blackquill?! It's obvious he's the phantom!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nEvidence is everything, Wright-dono. And you must admit there's no clear evidence that Fool Bright is the phantom.Phoenix:\nNgah.Judge:\nHmm... Yes. As I recall, the only solid proof we've seen up to this point... ...is the fact that Detective Fulbright fabricated evidence.Phoenix:\nB-But...!Fulbright:\n............Blackquill:\n...I've known Fool Bright here for a year now. And all this time, he's been quite intent on rehabilitating me. I don't believe his efforts were a lie.Fulbright:\nP-Prosecutor Blackquill!Blackquill:\nThis fool truly thought he could reform a death-row inmate like me. He went so out of his way in his efforts for me, he actually became quite a nuisance, really.Fulbright:\n*sob* Prosecutor Blackquill! You believe meeeeeeee!Phoenix:\n(Please tell me Prosecutor Blackquill hasn't REALLY been taken in by this big phony?!)Blackquill:\nHowever, even if it was against your will... ...you still acted as the phantom's accomplice. You will have to pay the price for that. Throw yourself at my mercy! And don't you ever betray me again! Have you got that?!Fulbright:\n............Y-Yes! Thank you! Oh, thank yooooou!Judge:\n*sniffle* *sniffle* *sniffle* S-Such a bond of trust is a rare and beautiful thing...! In any case, it looks like everything has been resolved. I can now hand down a \"not guilty\" verdict with confidence.Fulbright:\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Very good! I'm very glad to hear it! It's all over. Everything's been cleared up, and Ms. Cykes will go free as well!Athena:\n............Apollo:\nM-Mr. Wright! We can't let the trial end here! If we do, the phantom -- the man who killed Clay -- will get away!Phoenix:\nI know! I know! But...! (Argh! What do I do?! I don't have any proof that Detective Fulbright is the phantom! Is this it...? Is he going to get away just like that...?)Fulbright:\nNow, if you'll excuse me, my next investigation awaits! And with that............ I'm off!???:Athena:\nThe defense-- No, wait... Not \"the defense\"... The defendant feels it's not time for a verdict yet, and would like to see this trial continue.Judge:\nWh-What?! But I was just about to declare you innocent of all charges!Athena:\n............Hmm... It just doesn't feel right to be standing here. Hey, Apollo! Think you could scooch over?Phoenix:\nAthena, what are you doing?! (Hope we don't get held in contempt of court!)Athena:\nI have some questions for you, Detective Fulbright. Are you relieved that you are no longer under suspicion of being the phantom? Are you grateful to Prosecutor Blackquill for what he's done for you?Fulbright:\nO-Of course I am! And I'm truly grateful from the bottom of my heart!Phoenix:\nAthena, where are you going with these questions?Athena:\nI have yet to hear a single emotion behind any of Detective Fulbright's words, Boss. The suspicion against him has been cleared up, but he's not feeling happy at all.Phoenix:\nWhat? Does that mean...?!Athena:\nWe may not have any evidence, but the heart doesn't lie!Phoenix:\nThat's it! With your special ability, we just might be able to stop him!Athena:\nYour Honor! The detective has been deeply traumatized by our accusations!Judge:\nHmm... Yes, well... Even before all this, I thought he was a rather odd fellow...Athena:\nIf he doesn't get counseling right away, who knows what might happen to him?!Fulbright:\nHee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! Prosecutor Blackquill! Can you believe the nonsense the defense is spouting?!Blackquill:...Hmph.Fool Bright, I think you'd better have that counseling.Fulbright:\nNot you, too?!Blackquill:\nYou've been making batty remarks ever since you were accused of being the phantom... ...such as, you're an undercover investigator, and your family has been taken hostage. ...I fear you might have finally lost it.Fulbright:\nB-B-But I thought you believed me...?!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nHa ha ha ha ha! Oh, how you amuse me so!Phoenix:\nWh-What's going on here?Athena:\nThat was an excellent bit of psychological manipulation just now, Simon!Blackquill:\nI knew you would catch on, Athena.Phoenix:\nHuh? Mind filling me in here?Athena:\nHee hee. Guess we left you in the dust, huh, Mr. Wright? Simon was only pretending to believe Detective Fulbright... Because he knew I'd notice if there was a lack of emotions, like joy or relief, in his response. So he gave me the chance to take a listen. And listen I did to the voice of Detective Fulbright's heart!Phoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! You two were working together just now?!Blackquill:\nCome now, Athena! Show us what's inside Fool Bright's heart!Athena:\nYou got it! Time to check the instant replay! Widget, mon ami! Let's do this!Fulbright:\nThank you for believing in me, Prosecutor Blackquill!Fulbright:\nI am an undercover investigator, but the phantom was coercing me!Fulbright:\nHe stole the moon rock and killed Dr. Cykes seven years ago!Fulbright:\nI'm a bad, bad person for cooperating with such a man!Fulbright:\nBut he took my family hostage! What else could I do?!Phoenix:\nEven with all his over-the-top expressions and gestures, he's registering no emotion at all?!Athena:\nIt's just like I thought, and right in line with the phantom's psych profile.Fulbright:\n............Athena:\nDetective Fulbright! This lack of emotion proves you're the phantom! Hey! What's going on?!Phoenix:\nWait! Hold it! What do you think you're doing, Detective?Fulbright:\n............Me? I'm not doing anything.Athena:\nHe's trying to hack into the Mood Matrix program! I can't do anything with it like this!Fulbright:\nGaaagh!Blackquill:\nFancy device you have there, but I'll tolerate no cheating, thank you.Fulbright:\n............Ha ha ha! Sorry about that! As an undercover agent, I tend to use my secret arsenal without even thinking!Phoenix:\n(More like, as a spy...)Athena:\nThanks, Prosecutor Blackquill! There! Now that you can't hack me anymore... ...I dare you to try to hide your lack of emotions from us!Fulbright:\n............ Ha ha ha ha ha! Lack of emotion? What are you talking about? Of course I have feelings! *sob* As a matter of fact, you've wounded me very deeply with that accusation!Athena:\nWhat's going on?! All of a sudden, I'm getting an overwhelmingly happy reading!Apollo:\nHuh? But he's literally crying us a river over there...Fulbright:\n............Oops. My mistake. How about this? Graaaagh!Athena:\nYikes! Now he's angry all of a sudden?!Apollo:\nWhat's he trying to pull?Blackquill:\nLike as not, it would appear our friend is not completely without emotion. It's just as it says in Dr. Cykes's profile of the phantom. The subject has a \"unique psychological makeup with almost no emotional fluctuation.\"Athena:\nOh, I get it! So he has SOME emotions, right?Blackquill:\nPrecisely. Which leads me to wonder why you can't sense any emotion from him at all. I believe it's most likely because he is controlling his emotions.Fulbright:\nVery good, Prosecutor Blackquill! You are correct! It's the result of my daily training! A very important skill for us undercover investigators, you know!Phoenix:\n(More like, \"for us SPIES\"... Seriously. But I wonder why he suddenly showed several strong emotions...? Wait a minute... I think I know!) I sense there's a feeling you're trying to hide with your exaggerated emotions, Detective.Fulbright:\nHa ha ha! A feeling I'm trying to hide? That's a good one! You're the ones who have been saying I'm the phantom because I don't have any emotions! I was just trying to show you the range of deep emotions I truly possess!Athena:\nThen you have no objections to me analyzing you, right?Fulbright:\n...No. Analyze away. But I will state it again: I am not the phantom. And be forewarned that your analysis will have no effect! Because you're about to see what an undercover agent can really do!Fulbright:\nMe, the phantom?! No way!Fulbright:\nOh, I'm so sad! *sob* See?! I told you I have emotions!Fulbright:\nHow dare you accuse me of being someone who would kill over a moon rock?!Pinpoint Sad marker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I found it! I found the one emotion you're truly feeling!\"Fulbright:\nI do regret cooperating with the phantom, of course...Fulbright:\nBut I'm so glad this whole misunderstanding is cleared up now!Phoenix:\nWhat the--?! How are we supposed to pick out what's unnatural from this mess?!Athena:\nI don't know what we can do with this, either...Phoenix:\nThis must be his defenses against your ability.Athena:\nS-So you think this is what he meant by what he's really capable of?Apollo:\nI'd hate to know what's going on inside that guy's head...Phoenix:\nWell, we know he's hiding something, and that he feels threatened by Athena. Being only human, his true feelings -- an emotion he can't completely conceal... ...must be hidden somewhere in his testimony!Phoenix:\nI found it! I found the one emotion you're truly feeling!Fulbright:\nWhat...?Phoenix:\nHidden in the middle of that chaotic storm, I saw one emotion that never disappeared. When you talked about the moon rock... ...you felt a fear that wouldn't fade!Fulbright:\nFear... huh...Blackquill:\nHmph. A fear that a man with hardly any emotions feels, huh?Athena:\nAnd it was a response to that moon rock!Fulbright:\n............Phoenix:\nDetective Fulbright, I presume you feel fear concerning the moon rock because...Your identity will be revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Of course! That's it!\"You lost it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou lost the precious moon rock you went to so much trouble to get, didn't you? And that frustration has turned into fear in your heart!\nFulbright:\nOh, it's so frustrating! I can't stand it! Ha ha ha ha ha!\nApollo:\nI'm not so sure a man who could make that twenty-foot leap would feel fear about that...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I guess you're right... (Didn't the topic of what a spy might fear the most come up in our discussions earlier?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Detective Fulbright, I presume you feel fear concerning the moon rock because...\"You failed to steal it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou tried but failed to steal the moon rock! That stain on your career as a spy has left you feeling afraid!\nBlackquill:\nBut the moon rock did indeed disappear from the laboratory...\nApollo:\nAnd I'd hardly think a person who feels so little would feel fear over a thing like that...\nPhoenix:\nDon't everyone jump on the Phoenix hype train all at once now... (Didn't the topic of what a spy might fear the most come up in our discussions earlier?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Detective Fulbright, I presume you feel fear concerning the moon rock because...\"Phoenix:\n...Of course! That's it!Blackquill:\n...Enough, Fool Bright. Just tell us the phantom's true identity.Fulbright:\nI don't know. He was very careful to hide it. He has top secret information for all kinds of corporations and countries... ...so there's a number of organizations that want him dead. If people believed I was the phantom... ...I could be killed on the spot! Why, I bet even now... ...there are assassins lurking nearby! This case is about the phantom after all.Phoenix:\nDetective Fulbright, I think I know why you would feel afraid. You are afraid that the moon rock will somehow reveal your identity.Fulbright:\n!Blackquill:\nIf his identity were revealed, he would be killed immediately... That's certainly enough to make even the phantom feel afraid.Fulbright:\nMe, afraid? I don't know what you're talking about.Athena:\nSo, there really is something about the moon rock that would reveal his identity...?Phoenix:\nApparently so. Wait a minute... Maybe the phantom didn't so much STEAL the moon rock... ...but more like he HAD to take it with him? Because there was something on it that would reveal his true identity!Fulbright:\n............Phoenix:Phoenix:\nWhere do you think YOU'RE going?!Fulbright:\n...Me? I'm not going anywhere.Apollo:\nIs it just me or was he going to use that weird watch thing to try to get away?Phoenix:\n(How many more of those toys does he have? And where can I get myself some?) Detective Fulbright! You will answer honestly to this court right now! Why do you feel fear in connection with the moon rock?!Fulbright:\nIn JUSTICE we TRUST! Not emotions, Mr. Lawyer! Evidence is everything. I'm the phantom because I'm afraid? Don't make me laugh!Phoenix:\nAaaaagh! (And what was THAT just now?!)Athena:\nBut all humans beings have hearts and experience emotions. Sometimes analyzing a case from the psychological perspective... ...is the best way to find the truth! Eeeeek!Fulbright:\n............It's all just a waste of time. All your efforts at analysis serve no purpose. And now, in this dark age of the law, nobody would believe your claim that it's effective. In an era when evidence is fabricated, do you truly expect feelings to be accepted as proof? And where exactly is your \"proof\" that I fear the moon rock anyway?Athena:\nUngh! ...W-Well, I admit, I don't have any conventional proof... But I still say that examining a person's heart has its merits!Fulbright:\nOh, really? Then why don't you listen carefully with those special ears of yours.Listen to the voices of the hearts of the people in the gallery.Athena:\nAll I hear... is distrust...?Fulbright:\nAs you can see, the people are on my side. Because all they see is a strange little girl using a weird little machine.Athena:\nBut it's not like I use analytical psychology to falsely accuse people!Phoenix:\n(Uh-oh. He's got Athena doubting herself.) Ms. Cykes's analytical psychology has breathed new life into the courtroom. It has freed the hearts of many witnesses, and has been key in getting to the truth.Fulbright:\nHa ha ha! What nonsense! Your Honor, the defense's claim is a false one! I don't feel any kind of fear when it comes to the moon rock!Judge:\n............Hmm, I see. Very well. I will give the opinion of this court. In a trial, I don't feel that a person's emotions are quite as compelling as actual evidence is.Athena:\nB-But, Your Honor...Fulbright:\nHee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! There! You see?! Nobody believes you and your trumped-up charges!Judge:\nHowever, I do believe Ms. Cykes's analyses can contribute to making the truth clear. I have seen her do this firsthand several times already.Fulbright:\nSurely you jest.Athena:\nSo does this mean............ you will accept my findings in this trial, Your Honor?Judge:\nYes, I believe your claim, Ms. Cykes. I think there is merit in examining why the witness feels fear in regard to the moon rock. That is the court's opinion on this matter.Athena:\nThen that's a win for me-- No, a win for analytical psychology! Now, Mr. Phantom, you will tell this court the reason for your fear!Fulbright:\nAnalytical psychology? My fears? ............Fine! I'll show you precisely why those abstract things can't be considered evidence! Hee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!Witness Testimony-- My Fear of the Moon Rock --Fulbright:\nI felt fear when I thought about the moon rock because it reminded me of the phantom.\nYes, I'm very afraid of him because he took my family hostage.\nWhat reason would the phantom have to be afraid of the moon rock?! None at all!\nSo the very fact that I'm afraid of the moon rock means I'm not him!\nIn fact, I'm on the side of... JUSTICE!Fulbright:\n...And there you have it. Now do you see why I'm afraid of the moon rock?Blackquill:\nSure, you sound convincing enough. But so does any two-bit con artist. It's all meaningless in the absence of evidence.Fulbright:\n............ Hmph!Blackquill:\nHmph. The phantom is like the mist. No flesh. No bones. My sword alone cannot cut it, Wright-dono...Phoenix:\n!Blackquill:\nWith your deductive reasoning and the body of evidence before us... ...let us send this miserable phantom fellow to the other world together.Phoenix:\nYou and I, Prosecutor Blackquill... We have a duty to bring the phantom down, and restore the people's faith in the courts!Blackquill:\nIndeed. By covering for Athena, I allowed the phantom to escape. And as a prosecutor, I gave birth to the people's mistrust with my murder conviction.Phoenix:\nI bear part of the responsibility as well... ...for being suspected of forging evidence and losing my attorney's badge as a result. The two of us and the phantom were there at the beginning of the dark age of the law.Blackquill:\nThen it is also our burden to cut away the foul specter we created, is it not? Until all that remains is the righteousness of the court and the faith of the people!Fulbright:\nHee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! Trust? Understanding? Hah! Fragile ideals of the masses who are controlled by emotion. Humans can't truly trust each other, which is exactly why the illusion of trust is so enticing.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nOnce two people overcome their misgivings, that's where real trust is to be found. You're free to believe what you want, but... ...trust like that is stronger than you and your lies, always!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- My Fear of the Moon Rock --Fulbright:\nI felt fear when I thought about the moon rock because it reminded me of the phantom.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt only REMINDED you of the phantom?! Don't make me laugh. You ARE the phantom!\nFulbright:\nEvidence is everything in a court of law... Or did you forget? I was forced to testify over a silly thing like \"feelings\"... ...but those tactics won't work from here on out! You need real evidence!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I hate to admit it, but he's right.)Fulbright:\nYes, I'm very afraid of him because he took my family hostage.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour family? Like, who in your family, specifically?\nFulbright:\nOh, I don't know... Like... maybe my lover, for example?\nAthena:\n\"For example\"?! \"Maybe\"?! We need a more concrete answer than that!\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Maybe... my mother? My son...? Or, my daughter! Maybe it was all of them! I'm so sad and worried! I miss them so much! Ha ha ha!\nApollo:\nArgh! He's obviously lying!\nFulbright:\nLook how upset I am! Is it any wonder I followed the phantom's orders?!Fulbright:\nWhat reason would the phantom have to be afraid of the moon rock?! None at all!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou can't think of a single reason that the phantom might be afraid of the rock?\nFulbright:\nI thought the phantom wasn't even supposed to have any feelings? How can someone like me, with my wealth of emotions, be expected to understand the guy!\nPhoenix:\n(The phantom, a person with very few emotions... ...would only be afraid of something really big. Like his cover getting blown big... I'm willing to bet that the moon rock has something to do with his identity, but what?)\nAthena:\nMaybe the phantom's fingerprints are on the rock?\nApollo:\nBut fingerprints can be wiped off.\nAthena:\nThen maybe he wanted the rock so bad, he literally drooled on it and left his DNA?\nApollo:\nWe're dealing with a SPY here, Athena, not a SLOB...\nPhoenix:\nTrue............ But maybe the \"DNA\" isn't too far off...\nApollo:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\n(Something unexpected happened to him during the incident seven years ago... I just KNOW I have something that can show why the phantom is afraid of the moon rock!)\nFulbright:\nI'll just continue with my testimony while you're pondering, then, if you don't mind!Present Utility Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Fulbright, I assume you know what this is.\"Fulbright:\nSo the very fact that I'm afraid of the moon rock means I'm not him!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd how afraid are you, exactly?\nFulbright:\nI'm so scared I start to shake even when I see the moon in the sky!\nPhoenix:\nDo you shake when you see Ms. Cykes's earring?\nFulbright:\nWell, to be honest, since the very first time I met Ms. Cykes... ...I've felt more than a little frightened of her.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess some people just inspire THAT much fear in others...)\nAthena:\nMr. Wright, you were thinking something mean-spirited and rude, weren't you?\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha! Of course not! (Must beef up mindreading defenses...)\nFulbright:\nNow do you understand?! The very fact that I'm afraid of the moon rock proves that...Fulbright:\nIn fact, I'm on the side of... JUSTICE!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAfter all that you've done, how dare you speak the word \"justice\"?!\nFulbright:\nIn justice we trust! I'll say it as much as I want, and with absolute confidence! What I say is just, is just! That's how it works in this dark age of the law!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr! He won't get the best of me with that twisted argument of his! I'll find a way to get him right where I want him!)Athena:\nDetective Fulbright, or rather, the phantom, feels fear in regard to the moon rock. It probably has something to do with being afraid that his true identity will be revealed.Phoenix:\nRight. So that's why the phantom had to take the moon rock with him seven years ago. (In that case, if we had something to show the real cause of Fulbright's fear... ...we just might be able to expose his true identity!)"

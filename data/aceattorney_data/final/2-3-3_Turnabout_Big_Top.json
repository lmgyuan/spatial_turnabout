It's been six months since the incident in Kurain Village... and it was during that trying time that I met Pearls...

Since I don't have time to sit, it's unusually clean...Movie posterPhoenix:A poster of the newest member of the \"Steel Samurai\" universe. Maya went out and bought it right away.

I just know Maya is going to drag me out to see it with her...WindowPhoenix:There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Until recently, it had been a normal, business-class hotel.December 28, 11:19 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:What are they talking about? Why did they arrest Max?Phoenix:You're asking the wrong man on that one, Maya.

What the young lady just said was absolutely fabulous! What a clever girl! Such a fabulous understanding of events!Phoenix:(...What's with all this fabulous talk...)Max:Welcome to the Visitor's Room!Maya:It's MAX!! Nick!! Look!

FABULOUS!!Phoenix:(Absolutely cringe inducing.)ExamineSurveillance cameraPhoenix:Smile, you're on candid camera. Max keeps sneaking glances up at the security camera on the wall... I wonder if he is still trying to be a star?Security guardPhoenix:This guard monitors the visitor's room. He's so quiet, you could forget he was even there... If he wasn't watching everything. He's pushed up against the wall... Kinda like a magnet on a refrigerator.TalkMax GalacticaMaya:Max, I was hoping you could tell me a little bit more about yourself...Max:FABULOUS! I think we should get to know each other better, too! Why don't you come sit next to me?Maya:Umm... There's a big piece of security glass between us...Max:Oh sweet geebus! What in the world!? If only I could use magic! Then I could make this wall disappear...Phoenix:(What is this guy talking about!?) Anyways... Lately, you've become awfully famous, haven't you Max?Max:That's Maximillion to you, porcupine head! Get it straight!Phoenix:(Jeez, people nowadays... They get their panties all in a bunch over nothing!) Anyway, Maximillion, you won a very prestigious award recently, did you not?Max:I did indeed! It was FABULOUS! I won the Magician's Grand Prix, held by the Association of International Magicians. It's an award that recognizes that I am the most fabulouso of fabulous world magicians. There was a trophy, and a bust. It was a fab... I mean it was an amazing day.Maya:Wow! That's incredible!Max:Isn't it!? I'm certainly the greatest magician in the world!Phoenix:(I'm going to guess he didn't win a trophy for most modest magician.)Berry Big CircusMaya:You are signed to an exclusive contract with the Berry Big Circus, correct?Max:That's the long and short of it. You sure do your research sweetie! I'm impressed. You just can't watch a magician on TV, you know!? Magic is so fabulous, you have to see it with your own eyes, sweetie!Maya:You're right! You're so right!Max:However, the circus... It's a dinosaur. A thing of the past. Nowadays, no one even cares about what goes on there.Maya:Huh? What do you mean?Max:That's why I signed the contract!!Phoenix:That's why you signed the contract?Max:Thanks to me, the Berry Big Circus is fabulously popular! People come out in droves to catch a glimpse of the magic of Max Galactica! I revived the dinosaur that is the circus! But to me, it was just another magic trick! Isn't it just wonderful, sweetie?Maya:Y-Yes...Max:I made all the old crusty performances obsolete!Maya:But I kinda like the circus performances...Phoenix:(Maya looks a bit down...)What happenedPhoenix:Tell me what happened at the Berry Big Circus.Max:Ahh... Last night. The Ringmaster was murdered.Maya:The Ringmaster... You mean Russell Berry?Max:Someone smashed him over the head, I hear. He was slumped over on the ground. Even though it was the middle of the night, the police presence was fabulous. The police questioned me at length...Phoenix:Questioned you about what?Max:About everything... I was the last one to see the Ringmaster before he was murdered. I saw him last evening... In his room. (Changed from [I saw him that night... In his room.] in the original release)Maya:So then why were you arrested?Max:Arrested? Don't make an ant hill into a mountain, sweetie. They just wanted to consult with me on matters... That's all.Maya:Nick... I don't think Max understands how serious this is.Phoenix:(She's right... I think I should shock him back to reality...)Meeting with Russell (appears after \"What happened\")Phoenix:Before the murder, you met with the Ringmaster?Max:Uh-huh.Phoenix:What did you talk about?Max:Things that aren't for your ears.Phoenix:Maya. Would you please ask him?Maya:What did you talk about with the Ringmaster, Max?Max:It was nothing... Small talk really... We were just having a chat about my salary.Maya:Salary?Max:I am the one bringing in the crowds. (Changed from [I am the one bringing in all of the crowds to the circus.] in the original release) I think that I should be compensated as such. You agree, don't you?Maya:Y-Yes...Phoenix:That's all you talked about?Max:Of course! It was a fabulous chat!3 PSYCHE-LOCKSPhoenix:(Just fabulous! I mean-- Argh! Now he's got ME saying it!) (Changed from [Fabulous! Why does he have to keep saying fabulous!?] in the original release)Maya:What's the matter, Nick? You look all bent out of shape.Meeting with Russell (subsequent times)Max:When you make absolutely fabulous magic... It costs enormous sums of money. Sums that will boggle your mind!3 PSYCHE-LOCKSMaya:That's why you went to his room that night...?Max:I went to ask him for a fabulous raise.Phoenix:(I wonder how people can lie with such a straight face...)PresentAttorney's BadgeMax:What is that badge? Is it used in a disappearing act?Phoenix:I'm not a magician, Max. I'm an attorney.Max:An attorney? Then why are you wasting your time talking to me?Maya:He isn't wasting his time! Max... You're...Max:OK! OK! Relax, sweetie... You're just a little overanxious, I think...Maya:*whimper*Maya Fey profileMax:So, would you like to come up on stage with me sometime?Maya:Re-Really? Is that really OK?Max:I'll bring you up on stage as a volunteer from the audience!Maya:REALLY!?Max:I'll give you something before the show, and then on stage you'll sneak it to me...Phoenix:(Wait a second... He's planting her in the audience to rig a magic trick!)Max profilePhoenix:Do you mind taking a look at this?Max:I guess I have no choice... But really, is this the proper time or place for this?Phoenix:(He signed his own photo...)Maya:Nick... You mind giving that to me when the case is over?Anything elsePhoenix:What about this?Max:Fabulous!! You'd like me to sign this for you?Phoenix:(*sigh*)After clearing all Talk options and presenting Attorney's Badge:Max:... Anyways... I've been curious about something for a while now.Maya:What's that?Max:Why do you keep looking at me with such a sad look on your face, sweetie?Maya:Be-Because! You've been arrested! For murder!Max:Oh, don't be ignorant. They wouldn't arrest someone like me!!Phoenix:Why is that?Max:Obviously because I'm the fabulous Maximillion Galactica!Phoenix:So?Max:I'm the very big star of the Berry Big Circus.Phoenix:And that means?Max:I'm rich. I'm paid fabulous sums!Phoenix:Which means what?Max:...Maya:Max...Max:Quit joking around! You've got to be pulling my magic wand! The police aren't really serious about all this, are they?Phoenix:They don't arrest people as a joke.Max:...!!Maya:Look at Max... He's crushed...Phoenix:Well he needed to wake up and smell the coffee. (This is serious business.)Max:Umm... Umm...Phoenix:Yes?Max:Porcu... I mean, Sir. You're a lawyer, right?Phoenix:Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm an attorney.Max:Please! Help me! I didn't kill nobody!Maya:\"Didn't kill nobody!?\"Max:I may be more spoiled than a hog in a hamburger mud pit... But a killer!? That's insane... I... I... I could never...Maya:M-Max?Max:I swear!! I just wanted to pay off my daddy's debt... He's back on the farm...Phoenix:OK... OK... I'll take your case.Max:R-Really?Phoenix:Really.Max:Uh... Thank ya much. Ya'll sure are nice folks.Maya:Umm... Max.Max:Yes?Maya:What's your real name?Max:It's Billy Bob Johns...Maya:............ (Changed from [... Ugh...] in the original release)Phoenix:What's the matter, Maya?Maya:He's really just a country bumpkin!Phoenix:...Max:...Ahem. I must apologize for not being my absolutely fabulous self just now, sweetie.Maya:H-Huh?Max:Mr. Attorney.Phoenix:Yes?Max:A few minutes ago, you took one of my cards, didn't you?Phoenix:(Hmm... Now that he mentions it... I did take a card.)Max:It was the 10 of Hearts. Right?Phoenix:(Wha... How'd he... He got it right, again!)Max:What can I say? You, too... You've stolen some of my most valued possessions. Ten of Maximillion Galactica's hearts...Phoenix:(You sure do have a lot of hearts, don't you?)Max:Ah ha ha ha... I'm putting my faith in you sweetie.Phoenix:(He didn't just call me sweetie, did he?)Maya:Alright! Let's make this an absolutely fabulous case! C'mon, Nick!December 28Wright & Co.

Who would have guessed he was country bumpkin?TalkWhat to doPhoenix:So now what do we do?Maya:Huh? There's still lots of things we can do! Go to the scene of the crime, talk to witnesses, gather evidence...Phoenix:Yeah. I guess you're right.Maya:We still don't even know what happened in the first place.Any ideasMaya:We don't have enough information to make a case yet.Phoenix:I could have sworn I've heard that before.Maya:Well, we never have enough information!Phoenix:Just admit it, you don't have a clue what happened.PresentAttorney's BadgeMaya:Well... Your badge is still shining. Barely.Phoenix:It may be showing a bit of wear, but I try to take good care of this thing.Maya:You sure do love to show that off, don't you Nick? Who knows how many times you have shown it to me?Phoenix:(She's right... I whip it out at the drop of a hat.)Maya Fey profileMaya:Once you start channeling spirits... They say you lose sight of who you actually are...Phoenix:Hmm... Do you really believe that?Maya:Not really. But... Just in case, I plan to write my autobiography.Phoenix:Your autobiography...?Max profileMaya:...Phoenix:What's the matter? You've been acting strange for a while now.Maya:Max... He's just some country bumpkin...Phoenix:So? Why does that matter? He's still a famous magician right?Maya:I guess. But his real name is... Billy Bob Johns.Phoenix:(Yikes! The poor guy's got three first names! I guess that is pretty odd.)Maya:Oh well! If a big star can do it, then you should pretend to be exotic too, Nick!Phoenix:\"A big star...\"?Maya:Max Galactica is a pretty big name! Anyways, what do you think about Naruhodo A. Wrighto?Phoenix:N-N-Na... *cough* Umm... What's the \"A\" stand for?Maya:The \"A\" stands for \"Attorney\".Phoenix:I'll think about it...Anything elsePhoenix:This is kinda pointless don't you think?Maya:If it's that pointless, then you don't have to worry about showing it to me.Phoenix:(When she's right... She's right.)December 28Berry Big CircusCircus EntranceMaya:We're here again...Phoenix:Yep. But this time we are here for work.

It really gets your blood pumping doesn't it!?SignMaya:Look! Look! It's Max!!Phoenix:Even when you don't want to see him... *poof* He's right in front of you. (Sure the sign says \"Berry Big Circus\"... But looking around... It might as well be Cirque du Galactica...)Maya:The stars on his cheek sure are dreamy... How about I draw a star on your cheek Nick? I've got a marker!Phoenix:Nah! Nah! It's alright!StreamersPhoenix:Those streamers do a nice job introducing the circus performers.Maya:\"Maximillion Galactica and his comical comrades!\"Phoenix:You know... You don't really see too many streamers nowadays, do you?Maya:You're right. I haven't seen one in ages. I bet they stopped using them due to little kids climbing up to the top...Phoenix:(Umm... I don't think that was why...)VendorsPhoenix:It's a snack stand. They have hot dogs, hamburgers, and drinks... Not to mention...Maya:Candy and popcorn... They've even got snow cones!!Phoenix:(Who would eat snow cones in the middle of winter?)Maya:Nick... Do you think we can buy some snow cones?Phoenix:Look around... There's tons of snow piled up all around here!Maya:YAY!! Wait a second... There's no syrup though! I want syrup!Phoenix:(Hopefully she doesn't notice that discolored snow in the corner. That's not syrup!)EntranceMaya:Nick... The entrance is right here.Phoenix:Maya. The circus is closed today. No clowns. No elephants. No shows.Maya:I know that! Nick...

I forgot to buy one when we came to the circus last time.Phoenix:So then why don't you buy one now?Maya:Hmm... Sounds like a plan. Oh no... It looks like I forgot my wallet. ...Phoenix:If you want me to buy it for you, just ask me already.Maya:You know I'd never do that to you, Nick...DoorMaya:Hmm... This door must lead to the lodging house.Phoenix:\"No Entry To Unauthorized Personnel\"Maya:Do you really need to say \"No Entry\" if no one's actually entering? It's almost like a zen riddle, isn't it Nick?Phoenix:(I'm not even going to justify that question with a response...)Maya:I bet all of the stars stay at that lodging house.December 28Lodging HousePlazaPhoenix:This seems to be a dorm where all the performers in the circus stay...Maya:Really!? So we might run into that stoogey clown here, right? He's so kooky! (Changed from [Really!? So that stoogey clown should be here, huh? He's so kooky!] in the original release)???:Ahhh!

(Changed from [You always seem to be working so hard, Detective.] in the original release)Gumshoe:Well, I'd rather not be always working, but with crime, you don't make your own hours. (Changed from [I'd rather not be working hard, but with crime you don't make your own hours.] in the original release) If I have to be at the circus anyway, I want to see the lion tamer and the tightrope.

Let's get back to business now, OK?ExamineTarpPhoenix:There's some evidence under the tarp over there...Gumshoe:Hey! Watch it, pal! The killer is behind that tarp!!Maya:AHHHHH!!Gumshoe:Ho! Ho! Ho!

Did you ride your triceratops to work too?Phoenix:And what do you mean you \"won\" an air conditioner? You didn't buy it?Gumshoe:I can't afford one of those things!! But I got lucky and won it as a door prize at the Annual Police Christmas Party!Maya:They really pay you peanuts don't they?Gumshoe:Peanuts? I don't even get paid enough for peanut butter, let alone peanuts!LightpostGumshoe:The safety lights around the circus are kept on all night long. So, they should have been on at the time of the murder...Phoenix:(So he's saying the murder took place in the light...?)Gumshoe:How strange...Maya:How strange indeed... Hmm...Muddy footprintsPhoenix:This is the only place that the snow has been trounced upon.Maya:The murderer was sloppy leaving all these prints all over!Gumshoe:No no no no no... We're the ones who left the prints... An investigation can be a messy thing sometimes.Maya:What!?Gumshoe:I also slipped and fell in that spot over there. The other detectives all got a good laugh when the prosecutor whipped me. Thank god there was all this snow around to bring down the swelling.Phoenix:(It's great to know that the police aren't worried about preserving the evidence...)TalkTomorrow's trialPhoenix:Do you know who will be the prosecutor in court tomorrow?Gumshoe:Of course. It will be Ms. von Karma.Phoenix:Uhhh... She isn't gonna hit me with her whip again, is she?Gumshoe:What do you have to worry about? You only have to see her in court! When she shows up at the precinct, the sound of that whip never ends, pal.Maya:Detective Gumshoe... I'm sure Ms. von Karma's really interesting and all, but... (Changed from [Detective Gumshoe... That's enough about Von Karma.] in the original release) there's someone else I'd rather talk about. (Chagned from [What about that guy? What is he up to?] in the original release)Gumshoe:Like who?

Don't say his name again, OK?Maya:N-Nick?What happenedPhoenix:The Ringmaster of the circus was murdered, wasn't he?Gumshoe:Yep. Last night around 10 PM. He died outside in the cold.

The thing you mentioned earlier.Gumshoe:Footprints, pal. Footprints.Maya:Footprints?Gumshoe:Look at this picture of the crime scene...Phoenix:What's this?

Calm down now. Take a good look at the footprints in this picture.Phoenix:The victim's footprints are on the scene.Gumshoe:That's right, pal. The problem is...Maya:...! The killer's footprints aren't there!!Gumshoe:Bingo. Where did the killer come from, and where did the killer run off to?

How about that one?Phoenix:I'll only wear it if Detective Gumshoe carries a Steel Samurai Police Badge.Maya:Then it's a deal! I hear that Detective Gumshoe has that very badge! ...Gumshoe:What!?

That's really something!!Maya:Actually, I've been thinking of taking a break from channeling.Phoenix:Really?Maya:I don't want to have another incident like last time.Max profileGumshoe:It looks like Max is the most unpopular guy in the circus tent. You know what they say...

I like having a big collection so I can match my costume to my mood... And my carrot.Maya:Hehe...Moe:You know, I only own one T-shirt. The rest are all clown costumes!Phoenix:(Snazzy dresser!? More like spazzy dresser if you ask me!)Boarded up cracks in ceilingMaya:There's a hole in the ceiling... Why is there a hole in the ceiling?Moe:Well... Umm... I was riding a pogo stick, and I guess I just overdid it a little...Maya:\"Overdid it a little\"...?Moe:What can I say, sometimes things get a bit crazy in one's college days...Maya:Huh?CarrotsMoe:Carrots are one of my trademark props.Maya:Yep! I saw you use them! You must believe in a carrot and no stick approach. You put the carrot out in front for motivation, but I guess the trick is gauging what flavor you want each day...Moe:Exactly! You were really paying attention, weren't you!? You know, I eat about 5 of those carrots every single day. If you eat that many, you've gotta change up the taste every now and again.Phoenix:(I didn't understand any of that, nor do I ever want to.)PajamasPhoenix:Moe, you've got quite the collection of pajamas... They really scream out to you.Moe:You think they're loud, huh? I kinda thought they were refined... You know, a bit too adult for me to use on stage... That's why I used them as pajamas.Phoenix:(Wait a second... He sleeps in clown costumes!?)DeskMoe:Take a look at my desk. Aren't I the most studious clown you've ever seen? Every free moment I have, I spend it studying or reading.Phoenix:The classic \"Pull My Finger\" or \"Clown Car Maintenance and Repair\".. Not to mention the bestseller \"Jean-Luc de Laduc's Guide To Obnoxious French Pierrots\"...Maya:Umm... They all seem to cover rather basic topics though...Phoenix:Maybe he is just trying to cover all of his bases?Moe:Exactly! I want to be a renaissance clown!Phoenix:(Too bad he didn't buy \"How To Be A Funny Clown\"...)Clown equipmentMoe:Us clowns really take our work seriously. I try to hone my craft day and night, with the latest in jester technology. Unicycles. Trampolines. Balancing Balls. Accordions.Phoenix:It looks like you've put quite a bit of wear and tear on that equipment...Moe:Well... The theme of my act as a clown is... \"How many ways can a fat funny guy fall down?\" I don't care what I break or how I break it, as long as it ends with me on my bum!! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!Shoes or banana peelMaya:What's this? A banana peel? *slips*Moe:Oh my! Oh my! What a wonderful fall girlie! You should remember that when you see a banana peel, get ready to fall down! That is one of the basic tenants of clownsmanship.Maya:Ow ow ow ow ow...Moe:Every night, I fall down 100 times to practice the proper banana peel breakfall. WHOA! *slip* WHOA! *slip* WHOA! *slip*Maya:Wow. He really is a pro, huh Nick!? His falls are totally different than my slip!TalkBerry Big CircusMaya:Could you please tell us more about the Berry Big Circus?Moe:It's a Berry Big story... You sure you got that kind of time?Phoenix:(And the hits just keep on comin'... *sigh*)Moe:This circus has been in business for 20 years. We all performed under the guidance of the Ringmaster, Russell Berry.Maya:Twenty years!? Wow!Moe:Working in the circus is never easy, especially nowadays... With movies, TV, and bowling, there is just too much competition.Maya:But... But... I LOVE THE CIRCUS!Moe:I love it too... That is why I've been here for 20 years. We work hard to keep the show running. No one sends in the clowns on us!Maya:Nick! He just made a joke! Laugh!!Phoenix:Har! Har! Har! Har! Har! Har!Moe:The Ringmaster was a real big shot in the circus world. A real class act. Even when there were no customers, Russell would use his own money to pay me. Because he knew that I had a family to care for... He was happy to take care of his employees.Maya:I see...Moe:How could anyone do that to such a wonderful man...!?What happenedPhoenix:Moe...Moe:Wiggidty-wiggidty-wiggidty WHAT?Phoenix:Ugh...Maya:I'm sorry Moe. Nick was born without a sense of humor.Moe:Don't worry about it... How can you fault someone for being born that way?Phoenix:Let's talk about the murder.Moe:Ahh... Let's see... It must've taken place around 10 PM last night. After rehearsals were finished, I was tuckered out, so I came back here. After I went to bed... That's when I caught a peek of it...Maya:\"Caught a peek...?\"Moe:Of the crime.Phoenix:(Just as we suspected...

He would always add new elements to the show.Maya:New elements...?Moe:When you've been a performer for a long time, your act starts getting a bit stale.Phoenix:Hmm...Moe:I realize that even my act can get a bit long in the tooth... Sometimes my jokes can be a bit... Umm... Old-fashion.Phoenix:\"A bit long in the tooth?\"Moe:But that make-believer takes things too far!!Maya:Make-believer?Moe:The magician!! The one that thinks he's all high and mighty!! He had the gall to say to me, \"You're one of those funny types, right?\" What does he mean \"one of those\"!? Well the joke's on him now...Phoenix:On him...?Moe:Yep! He got on everyone's nerves!! The day of the murder... ...Phoenix:Go ahead.Moe:Nope. No way! Just forget I said anything!Phoenix:(I bet he's still hiding something about Max...)What you witnessed (appears after \"What happened\")Phoenix:You say you saw the crime. Do you mind telling me what you saw?Moe:Well, the police told me that I can't share my story with others. \"Don't say a word, pal!!\" I'm just gonna have to let these lips stay zipped! (Changed from ['Don't say a word!!' I'm just gonna have to let these lips stay zipped!] in the original release)Maya:That's not fair!Moe:I guess you're right... Maybe I can tell you a few details. But only if you can get old stiff lips here to make with the funny...!Phoenix:Stiff lips? Wait... Do you mean me?Maya:Nick! You can do it!!Phoenix:*achem* *achem*Moe:What's the matter?Phoenix:Just getting ready. OK... Do you know why I, Phoenix Wright, am a great lawyer? Because I'm Wright all the time!!Maya:...Moe:...Maya:At least his expectations are low.Moe:I wouldn't let him quit his day job.Phoenix:(Yeesh, cut a guy some slack. At least it was funnier than Chuckles over here.)Moe:It wasn't the greatest joke I've heard, but you did try, so I'll tell you what I saw.Maya:I'm sorry he's incapable of being funny, Moe.Moe:That night... Once I had tucked myself into bed, I heard this amazing noise. It was incredibly loud. It sounded like a giant \"THUMP\"! Once I heard it, I jumped out of bed. That's when I saw... Without question. Without a doubt. It was that magician!! That's all I saw... But it just proves how terrible that man actually is!Phoenix:(He knows more about Max than he is letting on...)PresentCrime PhotoMoe:RUSSELL!! How could anyone do this to you... I...

Max clonked Ben right over the head, as hard as he could.Phoenix:Ben?

She lives with her mother now.Phoenix:(It's true what they say about the tears of a clown...)Russell Berry profileMoe:I've been friends with Russell since even before the circus began. He was so selfless. He always thought about others before thinking of himself. I'll find a way to return the favor... He always took such good care of me.

I asked him to \"Let me marry my sweetie pie!\"Maya:What!?Max:The Ringmaster told me that it \"sounds good to me!\" That's why my sweetie pie is MY sweetie pie! And no one else's!Phoenix:Hmm...

It's closed!?December 28Big TopRingmaster's RoomMaya:It looks the same as always... A great big mess. Considering how messy it is, I bet they wouldn't notice if another poster went missing.Phoenix:Will you just stop it, you poster pilferer!Maya:I'm just kidding! You know I already got one of these posters!!Phoenix:You mean \"stole\" one of those posters!Maya:Yeah... Uh... Let's focus on what Max told us.

Even I have Money problems.Phoenix:Eh?Regina:Whenever Money sees something shiny, he takes it back home.Maya:Haha... That's pretty funny.Phoenix:Well, I guess I'll just have to find out where Money disappeared to...Regina:I think that's your best bet. You should probably ask Uncle Moe... He might know.Maya:Huh? You don't know?Regina:Well... Money isn't exactly someone I am on friendly terms with.Maya:What!?Regina:He's not really the kind of animal I work with... Even if he does need taming.Maya:Oh, I see!Phoenix:(Go to Moe's... Hmm... I guess it is time that I revisit that kooky clown...)Ben and TriloMaya:Do you mind telling us a bit about Ben?Regina:Ben...?

Kinda cute, don't ya think? He's so smart, and he's such a wonderful singer... I love him!Maya:But... What about Ben?Regina:What about Ben?

Nope... That won't be for a while.Maya:Huh? Really? That's strange, isn't it Nick?Phoenix:Yeah... Max and Trilo both said otherwise. They said they asked for her hand in marriage.Maya:Ahh, but Max only talked to the Ringmaster about it.Phoenix:I forgot about that. He asked the Ringmaster for her hand, not Regina directly.Maya:So I guess Trilo hasn't asked her directly yet.Regina:What!? He's going to propose to me!? I'm so confused... How about you Maya?Maya:Huh? What?Regina:Who do you think I should go for? Max or Trilo?Phoenix:Wait... Wait... You do realize that Trilo is... a... puppet?Regina:Uh?

Detective Gumshoe took off already.Phoenix:Yeah... Probably because we ditched him earlier. (Changed from [Yep. Just leave him alone for a while, OK Maya?] in the original release) I bet he and the other cops got lonely and headed back to the precinct.

They've got the killer trapped behind that tarp!Phoenix:...Maya:What? It wasn't funny? You know it wouldn't have hurt you to look even a little bit surprised.Phoenix:(Whew! She didn't notice that I was too scared to talk!)Air conditionerPhoenix:This is the condenser for the air conditioner. It hasn't been used in a while.Maya:What!? How'd you figure that out!? You're not making things up now are you!?Phoenix:Hold your horses! It was easy to figure out! It was snowing before the murder, right? Well, look at the condenser. The snow is still piled on top of it.Maya:Wow! Nick! I'm impressed. Maybe you should be a P.I. instead of an attorney.LightpostMaya:This safety light was on at the time of the murder, wasn't it?Phoenix:That's what they say. (There were performers in the lodging house, so it makes sense that it was on. I bet the killer was worried that someone would spot them during the crime...)Muddy footprintsPhoenix:The Ringmaster's body was found here.

Pull up a chair, or maybe just pull my finger, and let me have it.Maya:We're going to get the same sound effect either way, aren't we?Moe:How'd you know I put a whopee [sic] cushion on the chair!?

Aha!TalkReginaPhoenix:So, about Regina...Moe:Regina is such a pure, innocent child...Maya:She's such a cutie, too.Moe:She was born and raised in the circus you know? But that means she doesn't really know much about the world outside the Big Top.Maya:Sounds like Pearly...Moe:For her, every child's \"dream\" of the circus is her everyday reality.Maya:She lives in a dream world...Moe:Everyday she sees dancing wild animals, men flying in the air, and one very funny clown. The funny thing is, that all seems normal to her because it is her everyday life.Phoenix:(I guess that explains why she thinks she can marry a ventriloquist's puppet...)Moe:Don't ask me if her reality is a good thing or a bad thing though... \"A clown sees life simply, without complications.\"Money the MonkeyPhoenix:Have you ever heard of a monkey named Money?Moe:Ahhh! Yes! Money!Phoenix:He stole my Attorney's Badge!Moe:Well... Money does love shiny objects... It makes sense that he'd swipe your badge. But under no circumstances can you chase after him.Phoenix:Eh? Why's that?Maya:Oh! I know!! You don't want to get involved in any monkey business, right?Moe:EXACTLY! BRAVO!! BRAVO!! Enough joking around though... Money isn't considered a member of Regina's family.Maya:Then who does he belong to?Moe:I'll be happy to take you to where his owner is staying...Maya:You mean right now?Moe:Of course.

I refuse to acknowledge its legitimacy! It did not count! Do you hear me!?Phoenix:(She must still be upset about what happened last time...)von Karma:You have no chance. Zero. Zilch. Nada.

NOW!!von Karma:Sorry to keep you from work, as I'm sure you need every penny you can earn, Detective.Gumshoe:Don't mention it! It's no trouble at all! I've been looking forward to this.von Karma:Very well. I would like you to begin by shedding light on the events in question.Gumshoe:At your service, sir.Judge:Alright, Detective. You may proceed with your testimony.Witness Testimony-- Details of the Events --Gumshoe:The night of the crime, snow was falling until 9:40 PM, making it extremely cold out.All of the circus performers gathered in the Big Top to practice their routines.The practice session broke up around 10 PM.The murder itself took place in the plaza in front of the lodging house at 10:15 PM.The victim was found bent over a wooden box dead as a doornail.The cause of death was blunt force trauma that snapped a vertebrae in his neck.Judge:I see... He was beaten to death.Gumshoe:Here is the autopsy report for the victim.Judge:The court accept [sic] this into evidence.Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:A blunt object... Hmm... Very well... Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Details of the Events --Gumshoe:The night of the crime, snow was falling until 9:40 PM, making it extremely cold out.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Let me ask you about the snow...Gumshoe:It was nearly a blizzard up until the time of the crime.Phoenix:Did it pile up?Gumshoe:It wasn't such a big deal... Maybe about an inch and a half was on the ground. The snow froze in place and stayed on the ground until the next day.Phoenix:(Hmm... The snow... Let me see... There's got to be more to this...)Maya:Eh? What's the matter? Nick?Phoenix:I need to take a look at the Court Record...Judge:Mr. Gumshoe, what were the members of the circus doing on the night of the crime?Press (after selecting \"About the contents\" upon pressing fifth statement and pressing sixth statement)Phoenix:Phoenix:Let me ask you about the snow...Gumshoe:It was nearly a blizzard up until the time of the crime.Phoenix:Did it pile up?Gumshoe:It wasn't such a big deal... Maybe about an inch and a half was on the ground. The snow froze in place and stayed on the ground until the next day.Phoenix:(Hmm... The snow... Let me see... There's got to be more to this...)Maya:Eh? What's the matter? Nick?Phoenix:I need to take a look at the Court Record...Leads to:\"Well, I think we have a good feel for the details of the event now.\"Gumshoe:All of the circus performers gathered in the Big Top to practice their routines.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:When you say \"all of the circus performers\"... Who do you mean?Gumshoe:Everyone but the dancers and staff were there. Regina the animal tamer, Moe the clown, Ben the Ventriloquist... And of course, the defendant, Maximillion Galactica, and his victim, the Ringmaster. Oh, I almost forgot... Regent the tiger was there as well.Phoenix:Out of curiosity, what about the circus monkey?Gumshoe:When I was investigating yesterday, he happened to snatch my wristwatch.Judge:Detective, you are welcome to file a police report AFTER these proceedings!Gumshoe:The practice session broke up around 10 PM.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:After the practice was over, where did everyone head off to...?Gumshoe:Regina was playing with Regent, while Moe went back to his room tired from work... Ben the ventriloquist went to the front gate absorbed in his own world... The Ringmaster and Max went off to the Ringmaster's room to talk privately.Judge:Talk privately, huh? That's awfully suspicious... You wouldn't happen to know what they were talking about would you?Gumshoe:It seems they were negotiating Max's salary...Phoenix:(Actually, Max was asking for Regina's hand in marriage!)Gumshoe:The murder itself took place in the plaza in front of the lodging house at 10:15 PM.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:I'd like you to be a bit more specific about the events at 10:15 PM.Gumshoe:Uh... Umm... OK... Not a problem, pal. We've got a witness that told us how the whole thing went down. OWWW!!von Karma:This is totally meaningless. Time to move on!Judge:Hmm... Alright... We'll just have to revisit that testimony later. Detective Gumshoe, would you mind telling us how the victim met his end?Gumshoe:The victim was found bent over a wooden box dead as a doornail.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:A \"wooden box\"?Gumshoe:That's right. The victim must have been carrying the wooden box when he was killed.Judge:Carrying the box, huh?Gumshoe:It was a rather strange wooden box, Your Honor.Judge:What do you mean?Gumshoe:Well... It was much heavier than it looked... Not to mention it was locked.Judge:Locked, you say?Wooden Box added to the Court Record.Phoenix:(This may be my only chance, so I might as well ask some questions...)About the Wooden BoxPhoenix:This wooden box... You figure it weighs about 20 pounds, right?Gumshoe:Sounds about right. The whole thing is lined with iron.Phoenix:Iron plating? Why do you think it's lined with iron?Gumshoe:I figure they just did it to make the box heavier... Yeowch!!von Karma:I think we could all do without your guesses, Detective. Stick to what little you actually know!Gumshoe:S-S-Sorry... Suffice it to say, the box is really heavy.von Karma:Much better. You may continue on, Detective.Leads back to cross-examinationAbout the lockPhoenix:You said the box was locked. How exactly was it locked?Gumshoe:Well... It had quite a sturdy lock on it. It took quite a bit to open that bad boy up.Phoenix:So, when you found the box, it was locked, correct?Gumshoe:Yes, it was. Some of the forensics team took it back to the precinct to crack it open.Judge:I see...

So we took it back to the station and cracked it open. All that was inside was this little bottle...Judge:Bottle? What is that, Detective?Gumshoe:Exactly what it looks like Your Honor. It's a condiment bottle.Phoenix:What's inside the bottle?Gumshoe:It's filled with... pepper.Judge:Pepper...? Why in the world was it locked in that big box?Phoenix:(There was only one little bottle in that huge box...?)Maya:I wonder if that has some sort of special meaning?Small Seasoning Bottle added to the Court Record.Leads back to cross-examinationPress (subsequent times)Phoenix:Phoenix:A \"wooden box\"?Gumshoe:That's right. The victim must have been carrying the wooden box when he was killed.Judge:Carrying the box, huh?Gumshoe:It was a rather strange wooden box, Your Honor.Judge:What do you mean?Gumshoe:Well... It was much heavier than it looked... Not to mention it was locked.Judge:Locked, you say?Phoenix:(This may be my only chance, so I might as well ask some questions...)About the Wooden BoxPhoenix:This wooden box... You figure it weighs about 20 pounds, right?Gumshoe:Sounds about right. The whole thing is lined with iron.Phoenix:Iron plating? Why do you think it's lined with iron?Gumshoe:I figure they just did it to make the box heavier... Yeowch!!von Karma:I think we could all do without your guesses, Detective. Stick to what little you actually know!Gumshoe:S-S-Sorry... Suffice it to say, the box is really heavy.von Karma:Much better. You may continue on, Detective.Leads back to cross-examinationAbout the lockPhoenix:You said the box was locked. How exactly was it locked?Gumshoe:Well... It had quite a sturdy lock on it. It took quite a bit to open that bad boy up.Phoenix:So, when you found the box, it was locked, correct?Gumshoe:Yes, it was. Some of the forensics team took it back to the precinct to crack it open.Judge:I see...

Especially since you didn't find it on the scene.Gumshoe:No no no... I bet he made it disappear with magic... Ho ho ho!Maya:There wasn't much that we could go after Gumshoe with this time...Phoenix:He gave us the facts, as he saw them. But there's gotta be more to this.Maya:I didn't see anything... But that's why you're the lawyer and I'm the medium.After pressing first and sixth statements and selecting \"About the contents\" upon pressing fifth statement:Judge:Well, I think we have a good feel for the details of the event now.Phoenix:(I guess that's all we're gonna get out of Gumshoe in this case...)Maya:You mean all we're gonna get out of him is that little bottle of pepper?von Karma:Now that we have wrapped up with the Detective, I'd like to call my next witness.Gumshoe:Eh? I'm not even off the stand yet!von Karma:Obviously... But that's due to you being slow and unable to take a hint!Gumshoe:I dunno, but \"wrapped up\" has such a mean sound to it... I'm a sensitive guy...Judge:Thank you very much, Detective Gumshoe. You may step down. Ms. von Karma. Call your next witness.von Karma:I would like to call Mr. Benjamin Woodman to the stand.Phoenix:(She must be talking about Ben the ventriloquist...)Maya:I wonder if Trilo will show up on the stand as well...?von Karma:Please state your name and occupation for the record.Trilo:My full name is Trilo Quist. I am employed as an opera tenor.Judge:Ex-Excuse me! The witness called to the stand was one Mr. Benjamin Woodman, Ventriloquist.Trilo:That robe must be cutting off your circulation. I said that I was a singer!! Maybe you don't believe me. Fine. I'll grace you with a song. *Ahem*... Mi mi mi mi mi! The world of the law... Exciting and daring... Guilt or innocence... Decided by a judge dressed up like a woman!! ...Well, what do you think?von Karma:...Judge:...Maya:It had a good rhythm...Phoenix:It's just the lyrics... They leave something to be desired, so to speak.Ben:T-Trilo! You know better than to insult a judge!!Trilo:Shuddup! Just look at your nose. You would think you'd have the sense to fix it!! It's so ugly I want to punch you in the face on the off change swelling would help. You know that your nose is the reason you'll never be an A-List star.Maya:Celebrities must really enjoy saying everything that flashes into their minds.Judge:What's going on here!? Order! Order! I demand to know who the witness is!!Ben:Don't... Don't worry about me, sir. I'll let Trilo handle this.Judge:I'm not worried about you one bit... I'm worried about getting testimony in my court! OUCH!!von Karma:You won't get anywhere trying to figure out this witness! Now let's proceed!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Trilo:Once practice was over, I left the tent with the stooge... I mean clown.Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went back to the plaza's entrance. (Changed from [Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went over to the plaza.] in the original release)That's when I saw Max, heading towards the scene of the crime.He was the only one heading that way... How could that punk not be the killer!?Then the police showed up, and took magic boy away.von Karma:You saw Maximillion Galactica heading towards the scene? You're sure of that?Trilo:Without a doubt. He had on his silk hat, cloak, and the dumb white roses on his chest. How can you mistake someone with that crazy get-up and his nose stuck up so high...Judge:Th-That's enough... I think we all get the picture. Just one thing... You said you \"ditched\" the clown.Trilo:That's right, dress-boy.Judge:Well, since you weren't with him, couldn't that mean the clown committed the crime?Phoenix:(Hmm... He's got a point.)von Karma:What a shame... It was a nice theory, but the clown can't be the criminal.Judge:Why's that?von Karma:Here's absolute proof.Judge:A... silk hat?von Karma:This was found at the scene of the crime. It belongs to the defendant.Phoenix:Ah...von Karma:Without question, he was wearing his signature hat during practice. If the clown was the murderer, there would be no reason for this hat to be at the scene.Judge:Hmm... Well done, Ms. von Karma. Your prosecutorial skills are unrivaled. Well done.von Karma:Thank you for stating the obvious... Mr. Phoenix Wright, what do you have to say?Phoenix:O-OK... (I guess she's the boss again today...)Cross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Trilo:Once practice was over, I left the tent with the stooge... I mean clown.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:The clown... You're talking about Moe?Trilo:Of course I'm talking about that old fart. He's so pathetic, I can't stand him! Just a little bit of exercise and his makeup is running all over the place... Once practice was over, he was 9/10ths of the way to keeling over for good...Phoenix:Poor guy...Trilo:We didn't have any choice, so Ben took him back to his room. When it comes to being a first place loser, that guy's ahead of the pack!Judge:Hmm... Then what happened?Trilo:Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went back to the plaza's entrance. (Changed from [Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went over to the plaza.] in the original release)PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What did you do then?Trilo:I went over to the Plaza to do some thinking.Phoenix:It was awfully cold out that night... Especially with all the snow around... Wouldn't thinking in your nice warm lodging house have been a better idea?von Karma:von Karma:Mr. Phoenix Wright. I think you should leave the thinking to the witness.Phoenix:(But I'm a good thunker* ([sic])! At least my teachers always said I was...)Trilo:That's when I saw Max, heading towards the scene of the crime.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you sure it was really Max Galactica?Trilo:Of course I'm sure. How could you mistake someone wearing such a snobby 3 piece get-up!Phoenix:Snobby 3 piece get-up?Trilo:Get the wax out of your ears! Lawyers nowadays... You're like talking to a brick wall! Max's 3 piece get-up! Jeez! Could you be any more dense! All together now!\"SILK HAT! CLOAK! WHITE ROSES!\"Trilo:Thank you!Maya:Nick, I think you should put a little bit more effort into preparing your questions...Trilo:He was the only one heading that way... How could that punk not be the killer!?PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You saw Max and only Max, right Trilo?Trilo:That's right. And that makes him the killer! There was only one person headed that way that night.Judge:Hmm... That makes quite a bit of sense and makes Max one suspicious character...Phoenix:(There's more to this story than meets the eye... Is there something amiss in this?)No problems.Phoenix:(I can't really see anything wrong with what Ben... I mean Trilo said.)Maya:Maybe you should take a step back and look things over again, Nick.Leads back to cross-examinationThere is no proof it was Max.Phoenix:Wait a second! There's no proof that the witness saw Maximillion Galactica...Trilo:Hey! Hey! You still don't get it, do ya? I saw what I saw... It was Max's 3 piece joke of a costume! Alright! Lets [sic] say it all together now!\"SILK HAT! CLOAK! WHITE ROSES!\"Trilo:Thank you!Judge:I think you should study up on your celebrities, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:(Great, I'm getting shut down by a toy!)Leads back to cross-examinationBen only saw Max?Phoenix:That's a bit strange, don't you think?Trilo:What's strange!?Phoenix:That you only saw Max... Doesn't it seem like you should have seen someone else as well?Judge:What? Where are you going with this, Mr. Wright? Who else do you suppose this witness could have seen?Present Russell Berry profile (before correctly presenting Regina Berry profile upon pressing fifth statement)Phoenix:Judge:That's the... victim...Phoenix:That's correct. If Trilo was at the entrance to the plaza... He should have seen the Ringmaster as well! Ah-hah!von Karma:Obviously the Ringmaster arrived at the scene of the crime before the witness could have seen him! Anyone with sense could have figured that one out!Phoenix:What are you talking about!? The Ringmaster and Max went together to the Ringmaster's room!von Karma:Is that according to the defendant? A likely story! If Maximillion Galactica was supposed to be in the Ringmaster's room, why was he, just as the witness stated... At the scene of the crime!?Phoenix:Ahh!!Judge:I see... It seems that at this stage I have no reason to doubt this witness's testimony. And there are clearly no conclusive contradictions.Phoenix:He's right...von Karma:A brilliant judgment, Your Honor.

Let him continue with his testimony!Trilo:Then the police showed up, and took magic boy away.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Around what time did the police arrive at the scene?Trilo:Hmm... I suppose that would have been around... Hey, what time was it!?Ben:Huh!? Umm... I think it was around... I'd say a bit after 10:30 PM... I think...Phoenix:Practice ended at 10 PM so you hung around the lodging house the entire time?Ben:I... I... I... I guess that sounds about right...Phoenix:Wasn't it awfully cold? I can't believe you'd just stand outside in that weather!Ben:Well... Uh... The truth is...Trilo:Will you shut up, you big nosed dope! Why are you telling him anything extra!? Why can't you believe that we'd just stand outside in that weather?Phoenix:Well, maybe you were waiting for someone?Trilo:W-W-W-W-WHAT!?

He's cracking under the pressure already! I'm on to something!Judge:Hmm... Mr. Wright! Who do you suppose the witness was waiting for out in the cold that night?Present Regina Berry profile (before correctly presenting Russell Berry profile upon pressing fourth statement)Phoenix:Phoenix:Well, if he was waiting outside in the cold, it was for one person... And one person only! He was waiting for the animal tamer, Regina!Trilo:WAAAAHHHH!!Phoenix:You were waiting outside for Regina to come back to the lodging house. Am I mistaken?Trilo:...Judge:Is this true?Ben:Well... I... Umm... You can't really ask me that question...Trilo:Who cares who I was waiting for that night! What's important is what I saw!

Trilo wouldn't happen to have an ulterior motive for incriminating Max, would he?Phoenix:Well, Max is part of that bitter love triangle with Regina. Which is probably why Max conked him over the head.Maya:Umm Nick... Wasn't Ben the one who got knocked over the head?Phoenix:Uh... Yeah... I think so... I dunno anymore!Phoenix:Alright! There is obviously a reason why this witness was there that night! He spent all that time waiting for Regina to arrive! Moreover...

The witness saw the defendant at the scene of the crime!!Phoenix:Phoenix:However, he did not see the victim on the way to his eventual demise!

It was a present for her.In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!Judge:You were going to propose... You... A puppet...Trilo:Don't be so obtuse!

You mean a room they put money, like a bank vault?Trilo:Hah! That filthy monkey is gonna get what's coming to him!!Judge:Mr. Quist, I would prefer if you avoided slandering innocent fiats in my court.Phoenix:Well, Your Honor... Money really is a monkey... In every sense of the word.Judge:Ah. I see... Well then...Phoenix:Money likes to go after the shiniest things that he can find and gather them up.Judge:Shiny... Things?Phoenix:Trilo! When was this ring stolen from you?Ben:Well... I suppose it was... That time... You know... That night... The night of the crime...von Karma:What did you just say!?Phoenix:Details... I need more details...Ben:Well... It was stolen right after Max showed up in the plaza...Phoenix:Right about when you saw the defendant walk past, correct?Ben:Well... Umm... I guess you... Might... Umm... Be able to say that... The ring might have... Well... It could have been... Taken around that time...???:Oooo-Ooooh!Ben:Ahhhhh... Yeowwwwwwwww... Ohhhhhhhhhh...Trilo:Ben! What's with you!? ... Oh, whatever... It has nothing to do with anything! Especially not who committed the murder!!Phoenix:It's not for you to decide what has to do with what! Now, Trilo! Back to the topic at hand!Trilo:I haven't admitted a thing! Not I... Mr. Trilo Quist!Phoenix:What did you do when the ring was taken, Trilo?Trilo:You know exactly what I did! I chased after that ring snatching monkey Money!!Phoenix:But you weren't able to catch up with him, were you?Trilo:It's all this slow loafy fool called Ben's fault! While he was fumbling his way through the snow, that dumb monkey was able to get away!Judge:That is indeed an incredible shame.Phoenix:Well... This does indeed prove one very important point.von Karma:Prove an important point!? What point could that possibly be?Ben doesn't exercise enough.Phoenix:Obviously that one Mr. Benjamin Woodman is lacking in the area of exercise!!Judge:...von Karma:...Trilo:...Phoenix:This is clear from the testimony we have just listened to!! He was too slow and awkward to catch a monkey fleeing through the snow!!! (This revelation doesn't seem to be registering too well around the courtroom...)Maya:Maybe you should leave the courtroom drama for video games and rethink that one...Phoenix:Umm... OK.Leads back to:\"Well... This does indeed prove one very important point.\"Ben's testimony has a flaw.Leads to:\"There is a huge contradiction in this witness's testimony!\"Phoenix:There is a huge contradiction in this witness's testimony!von Karma:Co-Contradiction!?Phoenix:The witness just testified to the following effect -- Up until the police arrived, he didn't move from the entrance to the plaza. HOWEVER! The witness just stated that he chased after Money the monkey. When the witness was off chasing Money, there was no one watching the plaza!von Karma:What is the meaning of all this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where are you going with this little theory of yours?Phoenix:I'm saying that there is no possible way that this witness saw the plaza the entire time! That's where I'm going with this little theory! Which leads me to my next point. It is entirely possible that someone other than the defendant was at the scene!Judge:Interesting, Mr. Wright.von Karma:von Karma:Well then tell me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! Do you have any proof that something slipped past this vigilant ventriloquist?Phoenix:Phoenix:Well, he obviously didn't see the victim, the Ringmaster, arrive on the scene!von Karma:However, that doesn't change the fact that he saw the defendant arrive!Phoenix:The witness is lying! He is blinded by his rivalry with Max!Judge:Well... The defense's argument does hold water. This witness does have a history of animosity towards the defendant.Trilo:What!? How dare you!? I wouldn't lie just to get that dorkface in trouble! He's not even worth it!! I saw him! No doubt about it! I saw that worthless liar!Judge:Well... Just for clarity's sake, let's flesh out exactly who you saw on that night.Trilo:Hah! I've told you so many times, you'd think you'd know my story's not changing!Phoenix:(You've already changed your story, stick boy! And I'm sure it will change some more.)Maya:Where there is one lie, there are usually many more behind it.Phoenix:Exactly, Maya. That's why we have to keep after him!Maya:Yeah!Witness Testimony-- Witnessing Max --Trilo:I'll give you that I was waiting that night for Regina.But that doesn't change the fact that I saw Max in the plaza that night!He showed up after I had been waiting there for about five minutes.I said \"good evening\" to him, but he didn't even acknowledge my presence!I'm absolutely sure it was him! I saw Maximillion Galactica at the scene!!There's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!Judge:Hmm...von Karma:So that means that Money didn't show up until after you saw Max?Trilo:That's right. Money ran up less than a minute after I saw Max.Phoenix:Then Money snatched the ring, and you went chasing after him?Judge:How long was it until you came back to where you were waiting?Trilo:Well. Let's see... I'd say about...Ben:I suppose five minutes. I think...von Karma:So the victim could have arrived on the scene in that five minute stretch.Judge:Mr. Wright, please proceed with your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Witnessing Max --Trilo:I'll give you that I was waiting that night for Regina.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So you were only concerned with waiting for Regina that night?  That means you probably wouldn't have noticed if someone else showed up.Trilo:You should think about how many eyes I actually have. I've got four, you know! Four. F-O-U-R. Counting Ben of course... With that many eyes, do you really think something would have slipped by me?Judge:Four eyes is an awful lot of attention directed at one area, I suppose...Phoenix:(Yikes! The judge is even more dangerous to our case than Trilo!)Trilo:But that doesn't change the fact that I saw Max in the plaza that night!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So you saw Max coming out of the Big Top that night?Trilo:Of course that's where I saw him coming from! I was staring at the entrance to the tent the entire time!Phoenix:(I guess that makes sense, especially since he was waiting for Regina.)Trilo:He showed up after I had been waiting there for about five minutes.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:About what time would you say these events took place?Trilo:You're one of the dumbest people on the planet if you can't figure it out yourself! You already know that practice finished promptly at 10 PM! And you already know that I went to the lodging house right after practice! You don't need to be a brain surgeon to know around what time it was when I saw him... Just add ten more minutes! I'm sure you can do that! Now what time was it?Judge:Indeed, what time was it?Phoenix:Hmm... What time was it? Lemme think about that for a second......... ...YEOW!! I'm no good at math!von Karma:*sigh* It was 10:10 PM!Judge:Ahhh, yes. That sounds about right!Trilo:It sounds about right because that's the time that I saw Max on the scene!Trilo:I said \"good evening\" to him, but he didn't even acknowledge my presence!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So you testified that you said \"good evening\" to Max that night.Trilo:You must enjoy asking incredibly obvious questions! You say \"good morning\" in the morning, and \"good afternoon\" during the day, right? And it's obvious that I'd say \"good night\" to someone at night!!Ben:...Trilo:What Ben!? You've got something to add!? Lemme guess... \"That's not it Trilo! You say 'good evening' at night!\"Ben:Ah... I'm sorry Trilo...Judge:Mr. Quist, I would prefer if you kept your ventriloquist's act outside of the courtroom!Trilo:Impossible! A performer lives and breathes his performances! You should know better!!Phoenix:(There's got to be something wrong with this bit of testimony...)Nothing especiallyPhoenix:(I guess it's kinda petty to bad mouth someone's performances...)Maya:I think so too... I guess you really are \"Wright all the time!\"Phoenix:Glad to see you finally coming around to that.Judge:Continue with the cross-examination please!Leads back to cross-examinationTrilo's evening greetingPhoenix:Isn't that a bit strange to you?Trilo:What do you mean?Phoenix:Well, if you hate Max so much, why would you bother being nice to him? It strikes me as somewhat strange.Trilo:Why would it strike you as strange?von Karma:Exactly! How is it strange to be cordial to one of your coworkers?Phoenix:Well... If it was simply just being cordial to a coworker I would understand... OWW!! That hurt!!von Karma:Maybe you should think of having some proof before your lips start flapping next time! Proof is everything in this world! You should have learned that back in grade school!!Phoenix:(There's no reason that Trilo would ever say something nice to Max... But how do I go about proving that with the evidence?)Maya:Bluffing is everything in this world! ...But I'm sure you already learned that one!!Phoenix:I guess I can give it a shot...Judge:The witness will resume his testimony.Leads back to cross-examinationBen's half of the comedy actPhoenix:I hate to say it, but Ben's part of your little act is coming off a bit stale! I'm sure that if a pro was to review your work, he would say... OWWW!!von Karma:You're not trying to pass yourself off as a professional performer, are you? Don't get so wrapped up in yourself, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You! Should know! Better!Phoenix:OW! OWWW! AWWWWWW! THAT HURTS!!von Karma:That should have set him straight! You may proceed with your testimony, Witness.Leads back to cross-examinationPresent Broken Bottle or Regina Berry profilePhoenix:Leads to:\"Trilo, is it not true that you had a fight with Max on the day of the murder?\"Trilo:I'm absolutely sure it was him! I saw Maximillion Galactica at the scene!!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You are 100% absolutely sure of what you just said?Trilo:I told you already! Jeez!! I am 100% absolutely sure!von Karma:There's no way that he could be any more confident than that, right?Trilo:There's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Those three ridiculous symbols, huh?Trilo:Out of curiosity, exactly how many times have you asked that question by now? If you're gonna ask again, I'll answer with a chorus... Everyone together now!Judge:\"SILK HAT!Maya:CLOAK!WHITE ROSES!\"Trilo:Thank you very much!Phoenix:Maya... You didn't have to join in did you!?Maya:But... It's fun shouting out with everyone else!!Maya:There has to be a hole in his testimony somewhere.Phoenix:I agree. But do we have the proof to make something stick?Maya:All we can do is try, right Nick!? We've gotta have something that will prove useful.Phoenix:All right, time to go to work.Phoenix:Trilo, is it not true that you had a fight with Max on the day of the murder?von Karma:A fight?Phoenix:A fight over Regina to be exact.Trilo:It wasn't that big of a deal! It was just an argument... A disagreement at most!Phoenix:A disagreement usually doesn't end with someone getting clonked over the head...Trilo:AHHHH!!Phoenix:That morning, Ben got clobbered over the head by Max, didn't he?Judge:Wh-What? Is that an admission of assault and battery? OUCH!!von Karma:Before we handle that, we should wrap up the defendant's murder charge first!Phoenix:The truth is that on the day of the crime, the defendant and witness had a huge fight! There is absolutely no way they would have suddenly become cordial that evening! Moreover, just consider the personality of the witness on stand! There is no way a puppet this lewd would just up and say \"good evening\" to his rival!Trilo:GWWAAAAHHHH!!von Karma:von Karma:Are you saying this witness is lying!? That he is trying to frame the defendant by claiming to have seen him at the crime scene!?Trilo:I-I-I... I didn't tell a single lie! Honestly! I just...Judge:That's enough from you Mr. Quist! Mr. Wright...Phoenix:Yes, Your Honor.Judge:Let's clarify this testimony for the court... Could you explain your theory about who the witness actually saw that night?He didn't see anyone.Phoenix:Of course, the witness did not see a soul that night.Judge:I see...Trilo:Who... Who do you think you are to just up and decide what it is I saw that night!?von Karma:A fool can only understand a foolish foolery uttered by the most foolish of fools. The witness \"didn't see anyone\"... You wouldn't happen to have proof to back up that statement, would you?Phoenix:*gulp*Maya:Nick, I just thought of something... If Ben and Trilo really didn't see anyone that night, they wouldn't have testified that they greeted someone that night, would they?Phoenix:Wh-What do you mean?Maya:I think that Trilo really did say \"good evening\" to someone that night.Phoenix:But... Trilo and Max... They were in the middle of a huge fight.Judge:Maybe you should think this over some more on your own time, Mr. Wright.Leads back to:\"Let's clarify this testimony for the court...\"He saw the defendant.Phoenix:Of course he saw the defendant! How could he miss Maximillion Galactica!? OWWWW!!von Karma:You said that Trilo would have no reason to greet Max if they had met that night! You said that, did you not!? Mr. Phoenix Wright!!Phoenix:Ahh...von Karma:\"Ahh...\" is not the correct answer!Judge:Mr. Wright! I'm afraid that \"Ahh\" has just landed the defense a penalty!Phoenix:(Foiled again...)Maya:Nick, you've got to think about things a bit more and give it another shot!Phoenix:Yeah, I know... (And by the looks of things I've gotta hurry up!)Leads back to:\"Let's clarify this testimony for the court...\"He saw a different person.Leads to:\"It is my belief that the witness did indeed see someone that night...\"Phoenix:It is my belief that the witness did indeed see someone that night... It was just someone else! That's who he said \"good evening\" to.von Karma:What kind of theory is that!?Phoenix:The correct one. Furthermore, I don't believe the person the witness saw was Max at all.von Karma:Wh-What!?Phoenix:If he had truly met Max that night, there would have been no greeting at all. Which means there is only one proper answer. The person the witness saw that night was not Maximillion Galactica. That is why Trilo made the effort to greet whoever it was that he saw that evening. Or \"good evening\" as he put it.Trilo:Uhh...von Karma:What in the world... You...Judge:Would the defense kindly explain who it was Trilo saw that evening then?Present Russell Berry profilePhoenix:Leads to:\"Considering the ill temper of this witness, there is only one person he would greet!\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Phoenix:This is the person that this witness felt the need to greet that night!Judge:Hmm... How about it, Mr. Quist?Trilo:How about you stop asking me these ridiculous questions! You can show me all the crappy pictures you'd like, there's not one I wouldn't greet!Ben:...Trilo:What the oak are you doing, Woodman? You better not say, \"Trilo watch your mouth!\"Ben:Ahh... Well... OK. Sorry about that, Trilo.Judge:Order! ORDER! There will be order in my courtroom! Mr. Wright!!Phoenix:(Uh oh, now I've done it!)Judge:You better rethink this line of questioning before I lose my patience with you!!Leads back to:\"Would the defense kindly explain who it was Trilo saw that evening then?\"Phoenix:Considering the ill temper of this witness, there is only one person he would greet!Judge:It must be Regina! It's Regina right!? She's so cute!!Phoenix:No, Your Honor, it is not Regina. If it was Regina, Trilo would have given her the engagement ring as a present.Judge:Oh... Yeah... I suppose you've got a point there.von Karma:It was Russell Berry. The victim himself, was it not?Phoenix:You are correct. It was indeed Russell Berry.Trilo:...!Phoenix:The person you saw that evening was the victim, the Ringmaster, Russell Berry. That's why you greeted him Trilo. Isn't that correct?Trilo:... *gulp*Phoenix:Answer the question, Mr. Quist!Trilo:WAAAAHHHH!! AH!Judge:ORDER! ORDER! How do you respond to this!?Trilo:Wa-Wait a second!! Well, at first I thought it was the old man! But! But! Once I got a better look at him, it was obviously Maximillion Galactica!Judge:I think it is high time that we clear the air about this question! Mr. Quist obviously witnessed a single person in the area of the plaza that evening. The problem is identifying exactly who that person was... Was it Maximillion Galactica? Or was it the Ringmaster, one Mr. Russell Berry?von Karma:The prosecution argues that it was the defendant that the witness saw that night! The witness has clearly stated that he saw the defendant's three symbols!Phoenix:Three symbols?Trilo:Alright... This is getting old. C'mon man! You've gotta remember them by now!! Here we go again! Everyone... All together now!! OWWWWW!!von Karma:Yes, yes... We know... The silk hat, cloak, and white roses...Phoenix:Phoenix:A silk hat and a cloak! Anyone could wear them! They'd even look good on me!von Karma:What was that!?Phoenix:Well, the witness has endlessly repeated that he saw Max's three symbols... However, how do we really know it was Maximillion Galactica? It could have been someone else, dressed up as him. Possibly even Russell Berry!von Karma:WHAT!?Judge:Ms. von Karma.von Karma:...Judge:Do you have clear evidence that the person the witness saw was the defendant?von Karma:Well... I...Judge:If that's the case, then it is impossible for me to make a judgment at this point.Phoenix:(Yes! I think we've finally won a point in this one!!)von Karma:... That is very... Unfortunate.Phoenix:Huh?von Karma:You're just a little too excited for your own good, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:What do you mean by that?von Karma:You merely established one thing from this witness. You established that this witness saw one person in the plaza that night. I applaud you on your effort, but...Judge:But...?von Karma:Who that person was can only be answered by the next witness!Phoenix:HUH!?von Karma:Your Honor, the prosecution will provide, beyond a shadow of a doubt, an answer to that question, and evidence that clearly establishes one thing. That there is no one other than Maximillion Galactica responsible for this crime!Judge:Very well. The court will take a 10 minute recess. During that time, I request the prosecution prepare their next witness. Court is now in recess!To be continued.December 29, 11:54 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 5Max:Sw-Sweetie! You have to believe me! I didn't go anywhere near that crime scene!Maya:So then, where were you when the murder took place?Max:We talked about it yesterday, remember? I was in the Ringmaster's room!Phoenix:And while you were there, it was the Ringmaster who left the room, right?Max:Exactly. He told me to wait in the room because he would \"be right back\".Maya:That's when the Ringmaster headed to the scene of the crime... Right?Phoenix:That's what it seems like.Maya:But... The Ringmaster must've been wearing Max's costume. Right?Max:Oh! Sweetie! I just remembered! I went straight to the Ringmaster's room still dressed in my stage clothes. But when I got there, I went ahead and took the costume off.Maya:Which means?Phoenix:It means that the Ringmaster could have taken his costume, and went out looking like Max!Max:FABULOUS! That's a fabulously possible possibility!Maya:Heh Heh... Well done, Nick.Max:However, sweetie... Why would the Ringmaster want to dress up like me? Isn't that a bit strange?Phoenix:Hmm...Max:If you think about it, all they found at the crime scene was my silk hat. What about my cloak? Where did that go?Phoenix:Double hmm...Maya:Wow Max. I never thought of that. You should be a detective or something!Max:Well, I was never quite sure what to be when I grew up... Magician or President? You have no idea how hard it was to make a decision!Maya:That's really cool...Phoenix:(Fabulous... This mystery just keeps getting deeper...)December 29, 12:06 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:Now that everyone is back, let's get started. The court is now back in session. Ms. von Karma, please proceed with the prosecution's case.von Karma:Very well... I will now call my next witness. A pitiful clown with the unfortunate distinction of having seen the entire thing. Will Mr. Lawrence Curls please take the stand!Phoenix:(Why did she just call him a \"pitiful\" clown?)von Karma:The witness will state his name and occupation for the court record.Moe:...von Karma:...Moe:... In West Clownadelphia, born and raised, on the playground is where I spent my clowin...von Karma:... Name and occupation.Judge:Will the witness please inform the court why he is speaking autobiographical gibberish?Moe:O-Oh... I-I'm sorry... I'm just not used to being in court. I've never been in a courtroom in my life. I wasn't quite sure what joke is best suited to this sort of occasion.Judge:What in the world are you talking about!? You're in a grand hall of justice, not some comedy club! Since it's easy to see your occupation, please state your name for the court.Moe:... Oh... Yeah... Maybe this joke is OK... \"Mom, do I have to wear pants?\" \"The sign only says no shirt, no shoes, no service.\" Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!.....................Moe:OK! OK! How about this? \"Have you met my proctologist? Dr. Seymour Butts!!\" How was that one!? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! ...But a couple of clowns who were up to no good... Started makin' trouble in... (Changed from [...But a couple of clowns, they were up to no good... Started makin' trouble in...] in the original release)von Karma:Your name...Moe:Lawrence Curls. Professional funnyman, also known as Moe the clown.von Karma:You witnessed the scene at around 10:15 PM the day of the murder. Correct?Moe:Yes... Yes it is.Judge:Very well, Mr. Curls. Will you please testify to what you saw that evening?Moe:A rabbi, a priest, and a Rastafarian walked into this plaza...Judge:Without the humor please.Moe:OK...Maya:Aww... Poor Moe can't be his normal stoogey self in court.Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Moe:I know... I know... I'm not the greatest comedian in the world...I haven't been able to make people laugh for 10 years!No matter what I say, all I get in return is a vacant stare and polite applause.Since no one ever laughs at my jokes, I've taken to laughing at them myself.It's a bad habit, but hey, at least I'm trying!!Imagine my predicament! I'm a clown who can't make people laugh!! I'm almost useless!But I keep trying... I even tried to come up with jokes just for today!!But this atmosphere is very nerve-racking! I decided to try making everyone laugh!Seriously... Everyone... What do you think of me? How am I doing?Judge:...von Karma:...Phoenix:Umm... Aren't we the ones supposed to be asking the questions here?von Karma:Witness...Moe:Huh?von Karma:We will listen to your call for help after the court proceedings are over. Thus, please stick with the facts of this case.Moe:Really!? You'll really hear me out!?von Karma:Well, I'll make sure that one of my staff will be your straight man later.Moe:Thank you!! Thank you!! I can't wait!!Phoenix:(Poor Gumshoe...)Judge:Now that that's settled, shall we begin once again with the testimony!?Moe:Of course we can! I'll talk for as long as you want!!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Moe:The night of the murder, after practice was over, I went straight back to my room.You have no idea how tired I was that night. I was pooped.I thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window.That's when I saw two silhouettes! They were a bit far away though!It was the Ringmaster, and he was with Max, who was wearing his cloak!I kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!Judge:That's very interesting... If this eyewitness account is to be believed, I have enough to pass judgment right now...von Karma:Of course you can! There is no way that this account can be criticized.Judge:However... The witness is a bit, how do you say, \"off-kilter\"... Almost like he has some sort of atmosphere of guilt surrounding him.Moe:Aha! Aha! Aha! That must be because of my insincere smile...Judge:Mr. Wright, please begin the defense's cross-examination.Phoenix:Yes, Your Honor.Maya:Nick! You've gotta find some kind of contradiction in his testimony!Phoenix:I know that!Judge:Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Your Honor?Judge:I'm afraid that if you push this witness too far, it would bring disaster upon the court. Thus, I sincerely hope you are not going to engage in pointless saber-rattling.Phoenix:I understand, Your Honor.von Karma:If you cause this clown to stray from the facts, I'll hold you responsible!Phoenix:(Why am I responsible!? I'm not the one with the corny jokes.)Cross Examination-- What You Witnessed --Moe:The night of the murder, after practice was over, I went straight back to my room.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You'd say that practice wrapped up around 10 PM correct?Moe:See, that's the thing...Phoenix:Huh?Moe:How exactly am I supposed to make a joke about 10:00 PM? Now eight o'clock... That's something a clown can riff off of... Let's just pretend it was eight o'clock... That way I can make a great joke!Let's not...Phoenix:Let's not make it 8:00 PM, alright Moe?Moe:What do you mean let's not! Don't take the clown out of the clowning around!Maya:C'mon Nick, just listen to his joke!Phoenix:There are three reasons why I don't want to... One, I probably won't laugh. Two, I'll get hit with a penalty. Three, I'll get whipped. Will the witness just proceed with his factual testimony...Maya:You are sooo boring.Leads back to cross-examinationAlright, eight o'clock then...Moe:You know you want to hear the joke... A man goes to his doctor and the doctor asks, \"How is number 1?\" The man says \"Everyday at six.\" The doctor asks, \"And 2?\" The man says \"Everyday at seven.\" \"Then what's the matter?\" \"I slept til eight.\"von Karma:Witness! These are exactly the type of jokes you should save for Gumshoe!Phoenix:... OWWW!!von Karma:You knew what would happen! Don't look at me like that!Judge:Mr. Wright, you're hereby penalized! This will not become a kangaroo court!Phoenix:(This isn't funny at all... In more ways that* ([sic]) one...)Leads back to cross-examinationMoe:You have no idea how tired I was that night. I was pooped.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You were \"pooped\" that night?Moe:Yes. I was very very tired... Not to mention I had some bad Mexican food.Phoenix:What?Moe:The double cheese double bean enchilada is a dangerous menu item... What happened after that, as they say, \"happens\"... Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! That one was cool, huh? I hear the kids really love toilet humor these days...Phoenix:That joke was so hip, I don't want to ruin it with a reply.Judge:I've got a good reply though. That joke was so funny it just earned you a penalty!Moe:I thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You just happened to glance out of the window?Moe:You could say that. You could also say I peeked, stared, glimpsed, peeped, eyeballed...Judge:Mr. Curls!!Moe:Oh... I guess synonyms aren't allowed either...Phoenix:(What should I do? I wonder if I should press him further on this issue...)Let it rest.Phoenix:Very well, Moe. How about we get back to your testimony now?Judge:This is definitely one of your more straightforward cross-examinations, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:(Of course! You threatened me with a penalty if I don't keep this stooge in check!)Keep pressing.Phoenix:Exactly why did you look out of your window that night?Moe:Why!? Why!? Clowns don't need a reason to look out their windows, do they!?Phoenix:That's not what I meant. I meant that... Well... When we spoke yesterday...Moe:Once I had tucked myself into bed, I heard this amazing noise. It was incredibly loud. It sounded like a giant \"THUMP\"!Moe:... Oh yeah! I forgot about that!!von Karma:You... forgot!?Phoenix:Your Honor, the witness looked out of his window upon hearing a loud sound. He did not just simply \"glance\" out of his window that night.Moe:Oh yeah! That's right! I forgot to mention that \"THUMP\" didn't I? Owwy Oww Oww...von Karma:That's not something you just \"forget to mention\"!Phoenix:Umm... Yeah... What she said... I believe it would be best if Moe were to revise his testimony.Judge:Hmm... Very well. Mr. Curls. Please revise your testimony.Phoenix:(This should start turning the tables in our favor!)Changes statement from \"I thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window.\" to \"I heard a huge noise outside the window, and that's what made me take a look outside...\"Moe:I heard a huge noise outside the window, and that's what made me take a look outside...PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What was the sound like?Moe:Well... I guess it kinda sounded like... Hmm... I guess you could say...Judge:Mr. Curls. May the court remind you that humor is unnecessary.Moe:Doh! How'd you know that I was gonna make a joke! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! I guess that the sound sounded like a... I suppose it sounded like someone getting hit with something very hard... Yep. That's what it sounded like. Honestly.Judge:\"Someone getting hit...\" huh?von Karma:What then? You went to look out the window and you saw...Moe:That's when I saw two silhouettes! They were a bit far away though!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Far away you say... If you had to say exactly, how far away were they?Moe:Let me think about that for a second... If my room is here... And they looked about yay-big... I'd say they were about 30 feet from my window.von Karma:Just 30 feet? That's not far at all!Moe:It was snowing that night, and it cut down on visibility.Judge:I see. Please continue with your testimony regarding the two shadows that you saw.Moe:It was the Ringmaster, and he was with Max, who was wearing his cloak!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You'd say you clearly saw this? Even though you were, by your own admission, far away?Moe:That's right. I had been thinking about it over and over since that night, but things didn't really make sense until I spoke with the prosecutor, Ms. von Karma. But now I am 100% certain that it was Max and the Ringmaster that I saw that night. Just think about it? How could I be wrong if Max is always wearing his uppity symbols?Phoenix:Uppity symbols?Moe:Lawyers nowadays!! Do you even have to go to school anymore to be one? Alright! Everyone knows what to do!! Altogether now!! Say it with Uncle Moe!.....................Moe:... See what I mean!! It's always like this! The crown never wants to go along with me! I must really be utterly and completely worthless as a clown... Yeowza!von Karma:Enough foolishness, get back on track!Judge:Will the witness please testify as to what he saw... And only what he saw!Moe:I kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You say you saw the Ringmaster get \"clonked\" over the head!?Moe:Yes, I did!! It's the climax of my story!Phoenix:(He really does enjoy the completely random non sequitur...) What would you say the victim was struck with?Moe:You mean weapon? I have no idea. A weapon wasn't found at the murder scene, right?Phoenix:That's not what I meant... You did say you did see \"everything\", didn't you? (Changed from [No no no... You did say you saw the entire thing, didn't you?] in the original release)Moe:Well... I, umm... Yeah, I suppose I did. Wait... No I didn't. I didn't see a weapon... Heh heh heh!Phoenix:Moe! Did you or did you not see the crime of murder committed that night!?von Karma:von Karma:I will not permit you to harass my witness in this manner! You'd better have an excellent reason for attacking this poor, poor clown. Because if you don't... You know what is waiting for you... A nice penalty!Phoenix:*gulp* (Wasn't that a bit melodramatic...)von Karma:So what will it be then, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Do you have any clear basis to believe that my witness did not see the crime?Of course I don't!Phoenix:Well... See... Right now, I don't have a clear basis to be thinking that...von Karma:Then this is just another one of your pointless efforts to badger my witness! Thus, you have just earned yourself a penalty... FROM ME!!Judge:Now wait a second Ms. von Karma! This time, I do not feel the need to treat Mr. Wright so harshly.Phoenix:That's right! What he said! (Bailed out by the judge! What an honor indeed!)Judge:If we must penalize Mr. Wright for his display, I think a verbal censure would be best.Phoenix:Huh?Judge:You know the rules Mr. Wright. There is no room for baseless hounding in this courtroom.Phoenix:(I guess he didn't really bail me out after all...)Leads back to cross-exmainationOf course I do! (before changing third statement)Phoenix:Of course I have grounds to make this claim!von Karma:Then let's hear it!Phoenix:That's something I can't share with you at this time.Judge:W-W-What did you just say!? Mr. Wright!!Phoenix:(I know there's something wrong with this testimony... But I can't put why I feel this way into words for the Judge...)Maya:Maybe we should get a bit more information... Once we find something more solid, we can give it another shot!Phoenix:Yeah, you're right...Judge:Mr. Wright, before we resume testimony, you know that you must be penalized.Phoenix:(Yikes. That's harsh...)Leads back to cross-examinationOf course I do! (after changing third statement)Leads to:\"I've got a great reason to make my claim!\"Maya:You know... Moe's testimony and what he told us yesterday are kinda different...Phoenix:Yeah I noticed. We've just got to pinpoint what's changed.Maya:You can do it, Nick!Phoenix:I've got a great reason to make my claim!von Karma:And I suppose you will be telling us all that \"great\" reason?Phoenix:Of course I will... The reason is... The witness' very own testimony!Judge:What is the meaning of that Mr. Wright?Phoenix:Moe said that he heard a sound like a \"thump\" of someone getting hit.Judge:Hmm... He did say that.Phoenix:However, Moe just stated the following under oath.Moe:I kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!Phoenix:If Moe is to be believed when he says he looked out the window upon hearing a sound, there is no way that he could have seen Max \"clonk\" anyone!Moe:In 1972, a crack clown unit was sent to prison by a circus court for a crime...Judge:Mr. Curls! How do you respond to Mr. Wright's assessment!!?Moe:...they didn't commit. These clowns promptly escaped from a maximum security clown car...Judge:Mr. Curls, are you reciting the C-Team theme to anger this court?Moe:No no no... I'm just stalling for time while I jog my memory...Maya:Great job, Nick!Phoenix:These types of witnesses always seem to have a selective memory... You just have to peel back the layers of the clown make-up to find the truth.Moe:Well... Umm...Judge:Ahh, you're back from your jog?Moe:Well... It pretty much happened the way I said.Phoenix:\"Pretty much\"...?Moe:When I looked out my window that night, the Ringmaster was already face down in the snow. The prosecution helped me fill in the gaps of my statement.Phoenix:(Von... Von Karma!! Tampering with witnesses again!!)von Karma:...Judge:So now you are saying that you did not see the defendant \"clonk\" the Ringmaster?Moe:Y-Yes... When I looked out my window, the Ringmaster had already checked out.Judge:Checked out?Moe:Yep. He was on permanent vacation as they say. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!Judge:Mr. Curls!!Moe:Your Honor?Judge:You did not witness the actual crime; however, you still say you saw the criminal, correct?Moe:Y-Y-YES!! Exactly! The Ringmaster was slumped over and I saw someone's silhouette next to him.Judge:Very well. Then please testify to this silhouette you saw... I expect the truth! And if I even catch a hint of a joke from you... I will put you in a holding cell until you learn court etiquette, got it!?Moe:Got it.Witness Testimony-- The Silhouette --Moe:I was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max.There's no doubting it. Especially since I saw his uppity symbols.His silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there!His face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him.His cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying.Judge:Hmm... It does seem as if the defendant was at the scene of the crime.von Karma:It took the clown long enough to get his facts straight. (Changed from [You took your time realizing that, didn't you!?] in the original release) But whatever. This should finally be good enough, yes? (Changed from [Whatever. That should be enough, right!?] in the original release)Judge:It is decisive testimony...Maya:Was Max really at the crime scene that night...?Phoenix:He said he wasn't there. We have to believe in that. (Changed from [He said he wasn't there. We have to keep believing that.] in the original release)Judge:Alright, Mr. Wright. Commence your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Silhouette --Moe:I was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Don't you think that you are going a little overboard with how explicit you're being? 'That shadow belonged to Max' is an awfully firm statement, don't you think?Moe:What are you getting at...?Phoenix:I'm just saying that one of your fellow performer's life is on the line here. Are you truly, 100% absolutely certain that it was Max?Moe:... I'm not the kind of person who would lie about something as serious as this! The silhouette I saw was Max. I'm convinced of that.Phoenix:(It doesn't seem like he is jumping to any conclusions this time...) Let's go over this again then. What makes you so sure that you saw Max that night?Moe:There's no doubting it. Especially since I saw his uppity symbols.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Trilo said the same thing. But if it was just the symbols, then even I could have been wearing them. What if someone had just taken Max's symbols and worn them?Moe:I thought of that myself. But just looking at the shape of the face I saw, it must have been Max.Judge:Hmm... You're sure of that!?von Karma:Such a silly little boy... He threw his entire case headlong into a trap!Present Max G. Promo PosterPhoenix:Leads to:\"You say you saw all of Max's \"uppity\" symbols?\"Moe:His silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You're sure that is what you saw that night?Moe:Exactly what I said I saw is exactly what I saw. I've got eyes like a hawk!Phoenix:(Umm... Don't birds have terrible night vision?)Moe:But that's not all I saw!Present Max G. Promo PosterPhoenix:Leads to:\"You say you saw all of Max's \"uppity\" symbols?\"Moe:His face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You were able to see that kind of detail from your window?von Karma:von Karma:There was a light near the scene of the crime. Anyone with decent eyesight should have been able to see that much.Phoenix:Out of curiosity Moe, what is your eyesight like?Moe:I can see like a hawk out of my left eye, and an eagle out of my right eye...von Karma:Our records say his eyesight is a perfect 20/20.Phoenix:(That must mean he could have seen the crime scene clearly.)Judge:Hmm... The more we look into this matter, the more suspicious it becomes.Moe:Hey! You asked me what my eyesight was like, not what it actually was!Moe:His cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So, you didn't actually see what the criminal was holding?Moe:That's correct. I've been curious to know what caused that loud noise... It must have been something incredibly hard.Phoenix:(Too bad they haven't found the murder weapon to know for sure...)Maya:They claim it was a blunt object... At least it says so in the autopsy report.Phoenix:(With Trilo's testimony, and now Moe's... It really seems like Max is the killer.)Maya:N-Nick... You've gotta find a contradiction in this.Phoenix:That's not going to be enough...Maya:What?Phoenix:I have to prove that Moe saw someone other than Max that night! That's the only thing that will help! I've gotta do it!Phoenix:You say you saw all of Max's \"uppity\" symbols?Moe:I suppose so... The silk hat and the cloak, right?Phoenix:Moe... Everyone knows that Maximillion Galactica has three uppity symbols!Moe:Three symbols?Maya:Yay! Everyone get ready!! All... Together... Now...\"SILK HAT! CLOAK! WHITE ROSES!\"Moe:What the!?von Karma:Who cares if he knew that there were three or not! He saw what he saw. And he saw the symbols. He just forgot to mention one.Moe:...von Karma:Isn't that right, Moe?Moe:... Do you like Pi? I love Pi! 3.141592653589793238462643383279! Tasty!von Karma:Silence fool! You are to respond with the whole truth! No fractions!Judge:Order! Order!Phoenix:Moe! You didn't see the roses, did you!?Moe:To be honest... There wasn't any roses on the person I saw...von Karma:von Karma:The crime scene was dark! It's obvious it was too dark to see that kind of detail!Phoenix:Phoenix:But the witness said he was able to see the silhouette of the criminal's face. Not to mention that the roses are white! There's no way he could have missed them!von Karma:von Karma:Then the roses must have fallen off when the defendant assaulted the victim!Phoenix:If that was the case, then the police would have found them near the crime scene!Judge:Mr. Wright! Are these white roses truly material to the facts of this case?von Karma:Clearly not! He is just toying with this court!Phoenix:... (I got her on the ropes now... These seemingly insignificant facts have never failed to lead me to the truth yet! (Changed from [Whenever there's a nugget of truth, it always seems to peek out at me... Then run away.] in the original release)) Someone is toying with the court, but it's not me! Your Honor! Do you recall Trilo's testimony?Trilo:There's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!Trilo:How can you mistake someone with that crazy get-up and his nose stuck up so high...Trilo:How could you mistake someone wearing such a snobby 3 piece get-up!Phoenix:Trilo saw them all! Trilo saw all three of Max's symbols! However, this witness claims there were no white roses on the person he saw! There is absolutely no doubt that this is a contradiction!Judge:Hmm... Now what am I supposed to think? One is supposed to disregard the pointless, but this...von Karma:Judge! Forget the roses! Think about his other testimony! The witness has stated without a doubt that he saw Maximillion Galactica! Nothing else matters! Let's wrap this case up now!Phoenix:Your Honor! It may be trivial, but it does cast doubt on the prosecution's case. (Changed from [Your Honor! It may be trivial, but there should still be doubt lingering in your mind!] in the original release)Judge:... Frankly, I have my doubts about this witness. It seems that, unlike wine, the witness has not grown more mature with age.Moe:I'm not... mature...Judge:I've come to a conclusion... I'm 99% certain that this witness saw the defendant. However! My remaining one percent of doubt is quite reasonable! Which means that for my peace of mind, I'm going to request a bit more testimony.von Karma:W-What!?Judge:If there are no contradictions in his next statement, I am prepared to issue a ruling.Phoenix:(A ruling...!!)Maya:Nick! This is your last chance!Witness Testimony-- The Silhouette, Part 2 --Moe:There's no doubt in my mind! There were no white roses that night!However, all of the other symbols were there... I'm equally sure of that.Especially the silk hat! There is no way I could forget seeing the decorations on it!He was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!Judge:Mr. Wright... You've got one last chance at this.Phoenix:Just one chance?Judge:I will not allow even the slightest hint of badgering against this witness. If you are going to prove to me there's a contradiction with Mr. Curls' statement, you'd better have at least a shred of evidence to back up your accusations.Phoenix:(I've only got a single shot as [sic] this... I've got to be careful.) I understand, Your Honor. One chance is all I will need!Cross Examination-- The Silhouette, Part 2 --Moe:There's no doubt in my mind! There were no white roses that night!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Moe... Be honest... OWWW!!von Karma:You promised Mr. Phoenix Wright. No more badgering! I hope you enjoy this penalty!Phoenix:Ungh... I'm finished...Judge:Umm... Excuse me. I'm the one handing out the pen-- OWWW!!von Karma:Witness, continue with your testimony.Moe:You're not going to whip me too, are you?von Karma:Maybe after court... If you're into that kinda thing.Moe:But isn't it kinda pointless if you only whip me after court?Moe:However, all of the other symbols were there... I'm equally sure of that.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Moe... Be honest... OWWW!!von Karma:You promised Mr. Phoenix Wright. No more badgering! I hope you enjoy this penalty!Phoenix:Ungh...

There's gotta be an answer. And it's probably in the Court Record!Phoenix:This wouldn't happen to be the silk hat you saw that night, would it?Moe:Yep! That's it! That's the hat he was wearing that night!Phoenix:No question in your mind?Moe:Exactly how would one mistake a thing like that!?Phoenix:I see...Judge:Is there some sort of problem, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:Ms. von Karma. Where exactly was the silk hat found?von Karma:Must you always ask these questions!? It was found at the crime scene!! ... The c-c-crime scene... That means...Phoenix:The silk hat fell off at the crime scene! However the witness clearly testified to the contrary!! The witness stated that \"he was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!\"Moe:NoooooOOOOOooooo!! That's not trrrrrruuuuueeee!!Judge:ORDER! ORDER!! OOORRRDER!! MR. CURLS!!Moe:Y-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL OF THIS!? You are old enough to know better than to behave like this in court!Moe:Hey! That's just not right!! That's so harsh!Judge:What's not right here is your eyesight and your memory, amongst other things!!Moe:............... Wh... Why are you being so mean to me!! What did I do!? Lemme guess... You just didn't like my jokes or something, right? You didn't have to go and insult my eyesight or my memory!? They're both great! Seriously!! Why!?

WAAAAAHHHHHHHH!! *sob* (Changed from [And no matter how old I get, I'll always be younger you!! [sic] WAAAAAHHHHHHHH!! *sobs*] in the original release)...Judge:... Enough of these childish outbursts, Mr. Curls! Who do you think you are?Moe:I saw him! I swear I saw him!! It was Max!! Even if he didn't have his roses, he was still wearing his dumb silk hat!! I'm telling the truth!!Maya:He's turned into a bratty little kid.Phoenix:It's pitiful, isn't it?Moe:He left the scene wearing that dumb silk hat! He was there!!Phoenix:(He... left the scene?)Maya:What's the matter, Nick?Phoenix:There's something I've been mulling over for a while now. Moe?Moe:Whaddya want!?Phoenix:You just said that he left the scene... Exactly how did the murderer leave the scene of the crime?Moe:WHAT!? He... Umm... He... Went... Whaddya mean \"how did he leave the scene\"? You can't ask me that!!von Karma:von Karma:Mr. Phoenix Wright is badgering the witness, Your Honor!!Phoenix:Phoenix:This witness's testimony is so full of holes, Ms. von Karma's protest is useless!von Karma:Grrrr...Judge:You've got a point. Let's hear what the witness has to say on this matter. Is that alright with you, little guy?Moe:Don't talk to me like I'm a little baby!! Besides, what kind of stupid question is \"how did he leave the crime scene!?\" The answer's obvious! He just turned around and walked away!!Phoenix:That's what I expected you'd say... You sure that's how it happened?Moe:Say what!? (Changed from [Hmph!!] in the original release)Judge:Huh? I'm not sure I know exactly where you're going with this... Lawyers nowadays sure do love to harp on the smallest things. Do you have any proof to counter his story as to how the criminal left the scene?Present Crime PhotoPhoenix:Leads to:\"Look at this picture.\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Phoenix:How about this!?Judge:This isn't your idea of a joke is it, Mr. Wright?von Karma:Not very amusing, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Moe:You're not going to get paid for that one.Maya:It doesn't look like it worked.Phoenix:(What happened? It's like I turned into Moe or something...)Judge:You'll have to excuse me, but I don't understand what you're getting at.Leads back to:\"Do you have any proof to counter his story as to how the criminal left the scene?\"Phoenix:Look at this picture. The problem is the footprints in the snow...Judge:Footprints?Phoenix:In this photo, we can clearly see the footprints of the victim! However, where are the criminal's footprints? They aren't there!!Moe:Ai-yai-yai-yai-yai!!Phoenix:So Moe, exactly how did the criminal escape the scene?Moe:Umm... He... Uh...Phoenix:Your Honor! This witness has already proven that his testimony is completely unreliable! I move to strike all of this witness's testimony from the court record!Judge:I agree... This clown's testimony is as rickety as the clown car he came to court in.Moe:WAIT JUST A SECOND!! You guys can't just ignore everything I've said!! Fine fine! I'll tell you the truth this time...von Karma:YOU WAIT A SECOND! I think you've said more than enough for today!!Moe:That didn't hurt!! I'm sick and tired of listening to you anyways!! I'll give you the real deal this time... I swear!!Maya:I dunno why, but I get the feeling things are gonna get worse before they get better.Judge:Mr. Lawrence Curls.Moe:Yes!?Judge:The testimony you've provided up until now has been false?Moe:It hasn't been false! I haven't lied! It's just...Judge:It's just what?Moe:It's just I was a bit confused on the bit about the criminal leaving the scene. Especially since Von Karma and her whip told me not to talk about what I really saw!Judge:ORDER!! ORDER!! I WILL HAVE ORDER!! Franziska von Karma!! How could you!!von Karma:Your Honor... If you had heard the truth from this witness... You would have exactly the same opinion as I have.Judge:What opinion is that?von Karma:It's not funny!Judge:That's enough out of you! I'm going to listen to what he has to say. Now then, let's hear the truth about what you say you saw, Mr. Curls! (Changed from [Now then, let's hear the truth about what you say you saw!] in the original release)Moe:Hah! You're not gonna believe this but it's all true I tell you!von Karma:Try not to waste our time with your idiotic drivel.Witness Testimony-- The Truth --Moe:Now it's time for our next segment, \"Moe Knows...\"!!Everything that I've said up until now has been the truth!When I looked out the window, the Ringmaster was down and Max was standing above him!He wasn't wearing his white roses, but he was wearing the silk hat!That's when I saw... He...This is the truth now, get ready for it!He flew! He jumped up and flew through the air!!He flew right off and disappeared into the darkness!That's why there were no footprints! Flying people don't leave footprints!von Karma:I told you it wasn't funny. Do you believe me now?Phoenix:...Judge:........................Judge:Well... That was... Umm... How do you put this into words...von Karma:Maximillion Galactica is a world-class magician. But to leave the scene of a crime by flying -- there's no way that actually happened. (Changed from [But to leave the scene of a crime by flying. There's no way that actually happened.] in the original release)Judge:You... You're right.Moe:Why is she right!? You believed the other witnesses! Why won't you believe me!? Especially since it's the best part of the story!!Judge:Hmm... To be honest, this is the first time I've heard of a flying criminal. What do you think about this witness' testimony, Mr. Wright?His eyes are playing tricks.Phoenix:It's obvious that the witness' eyes are playing tricks on him...Moe:Don't be such a fool! Who in the world do you think I would mistake that jerk for!?Phoenix:(Jeez... I didn't say you were lying!)Maya:Wow, he looks really serious right now. More serious than he's looked all day!Leads to:\"I suppose I will let you all in on my thinking regarding this matter...\"He's telling the truth.Phoenix:What he just said was so strange, I don't think he would have made it up.Judge:Which means that he is telling the truth?Phoenix:That's what I think...Maya:Nick, wait! That means that Max actually used magic!!Phoenix:Yikes! You're right! OWWW!!von Karma:Only a foolish looking fool could be fooled by such a foolish fool's foolish dream. Don't be ridiculous! Magic does not exist!Leads to:\"I suppose I will let you all in on my thinking regarding this matter...\"This is all a dream, right?Phoenix:Right now, I can't believe any of this! I'm not even sure if this day hasn't been some kind of Kafkaesque dream... OWWW!!von Karma:Now do you think it's still a dream!? Huh, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?Leads to:\"I suppose I will let you all in on my thinking regarding this matter...\"Judge:I suppose I will let you all in on my thinking regarding this matter... \"The criminal disappeared into the sky.\" I'd love to believe that... But I just can't wrap my head around how that could actually happen.von Karma:You imbecile!Judge:If you disregard a need for proof, Ms. von Karma's case is sound. However... I've got the feeling that this case is in dire need of more investigation.von Karma:...!Judge:Thus I will conclude today's proceedings at this point! It's an undisputed fact that the criminal left no footprints at the scene. Tomorrow, I want us to find out the reason behind this mystery of mysteries.Phoenix:Umm, uhh...von Karma:Grrr...Judge:I believe that's enough for today. Court is adjourned!

I can't fly whenever I please. It's not that easy!!Maya:But it looks so effortless for you on stage...Max:It's not that simple!! I'm not actually flying on stage! I use invisible wires and have them hoist me through the air!Maya:Wow... You just told me the secret to your magic!!Max:NO!! I broke the first rule... The cardinal rule... The ONLY RULE!Phoenix:I'm sorry, Max. We made you break a magician's creed to never reveal the secret to their tricks. (Changed from [I'm sorry you had to break a magician's creed to keep the magic tricks secret...] in the original release)Maya:Nick!

I'm not sure I follow you.Phoenix:It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...Judge:You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied.Phoenix:(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimonyPhoenix:Phoenix:Your Honor!

Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)Presenting wrong evidence during testimonyPhoenix:Phoenix:This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!Judge:How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?Phoenix:They aren't, are they...Judge:Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.Phoenix:(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimonyPhoenix:Phoenix:The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!Judge:... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)Too many penaltiesJudge:That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong this trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.

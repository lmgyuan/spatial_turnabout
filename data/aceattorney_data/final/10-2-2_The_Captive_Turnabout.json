  "previousContext": "Episode 2The Imprisoned TurnaboutEdgeworth: ..........Gumshoe: ..........Kay: ...He's not coming.Gumshoe: He's not coming, sir.Edgeworth: How long does he intend to keep us waiting...!?Kay: Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. There's no need to get your cravat in a twist.Edgeworth: Ethan Rooke's murder... Two days after the incident, we visited the detention center. Naturally, we were hoping to meet with the defendant, Horace Knightley. His trial was set to begin the next day, with me serving as the prosecutor.Edgeworth: Still, he is rather late... You there! Do you know what's going on?Guard: I-It is certainly strange... I'll try calling him one more time...Guard: I-It's terrible! I-It's... Knightley! H-He's been murdered!Gumshoe: Whaaaaaaat!? What did you say!?Edgeworth: Murdered? (Inside the detention center?)Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go check it out!Edgeworth: You there! Take us to the crime scene, posthaste.Guard: Yes, sir!Edgeworth: (Knightley's not in his cell? I thought he was being held there.)Guard: What are you doing, sir!? This way!Gumshoe: Wh-Where are you taking us, pal? Through this door is the...Edgeworth: Ah... It's the prison.Kay: Prison? Then what were the small rooms back there?Edgeworth: Those cells we just passed are part of the detention center. They're used for holding suspects temporarily, while they await for their trial. What lies ahead... is a facility that serves a completely different purpose.Gumshoe: This is where criminals who have been declared guilty serve out their sentence, pal.Edgeworth: It's the one place a Great Thief does not want to end up, Kay.Guard: I'm opening the door now! Please, follow me!Edgeworth: (Th-There's no mistaking it... Knightley's... dead! Moreover, he was murdered inside the prison walls... How exactly did this happen!?)Kay: I-I can't believe something like this would happen to Mr. Knightley!Edgeworth: Yes. I can't believe it either... But the scene you see before you is the unmistakable reality.Kay: Besides... Wasn't Mr. Knightley supposed to be in the detention center?Edgeworth: Indeed. He was. Knightley hadn't had his trial yet. Before a suspect is found guilty, they're detained in the detention center's holding cells. (They only enter the prison after they have received a guilty verdict. Knightley should not have been moved in here...)Gumshoe: Do you think he passed through those giant doors that we went through earlier, sir?Edgeworth: Huge metal doors and a long passageway separate the prison and the detention center. As a suspect, Knightley wouldn't have been able to pass through.Floor Plans jotted down in my Organizer.Edgeworth: What happened to Knightley... In order to solve this mystery, we must first investigate the crime scene.(Connecting all possible Logic and examining body, rubber glove, chessboard, and hand leads to:)Edgeworth: Well. We've collected quite a bit of evidence.Kay: He he! With the three of us here, it's a piece of cake! Right, Gummy?Gumshoe: That's right, pal! We're the Invincible Trio!Edgeworth: It's too early to start celebrating. There is still something we haven't found yet.Gumshoe: Eh? What haven't we found yet, sir?Edgeworth: (What is missing from this crime scene?)Edgeworth: The murder weapon that took the victim's life has not been found yet.Gumshoe: Ah! Now that you mention it, you're absolutely right, sir!Edgeworth: Detective. Get your act together. Isn't that the most basic of the basics?Gumshoe: Ugh. I'm sorry, sir.Kay: Don't worry about it, Gummy! I didn't notice it either!Edgeworth: (That's not much of a consolation.) In this prison, dangerous objects that could be used as weapons are strictly regulated. It'd be quite dangerous if the inmates got their hands on them... Obtaining a murder weapon and carrying it around is not an easy task.Kay: I see! You have a point!Edgeworth: (What was the murder weapon? And where did it go? That could be the key to solving this case.)???: Huh? There are visitors here already? Sorry to barge in like this. Is this the crime scene?Edgeworth: You're...!???: Huh? You... Aren't you... That piercing gaze... That furrowed brow...Edgeworth: ...It has been a long time. Mr. Shields.Ray: Yes, yes. That frilly thing around your neck and that stiff greeting. There's no doubt about it! Prosecutor Manfred von Karma. Fancy meeting you here.Edgeworth: !Gumshoe: What are you saying, pal! Mr. Edgeworth's not that old man!Edgeworth: Detective... It's fine.Ray: Oh it's you, Prosecutor Edgeworth. I thought you looked a bit young. He he he. You two are so similar. Looks like your Uncle Ray got you two mixed up again.Edgeworth: ...You never change. How many years has it been since we last saw each other...Ray: Hmm. I've already forgotten. Your Uncle Ray has been overseas these past few years. But you know... There's something I still haven't forgotten. About you... and your betrayal.Edgeworth: ......Kay: I-I'm getting some bad vibes over here. Do you know this guy, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: Allow me to introduce him to you. Raymond Shields, attorney at law.Ray: Ace Attorney Ray Shields at your service. I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.Gumshoe: I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, sir.Kay: Kay Faraday. Nice to meet ya! I'm a Great Thief! Ah, but I'm currently on hiatus.Ray: Great Thief? Well, well. That sounds romantic, how wonderful!Kay: Oh! Mr. Shields, you get it, right? I'm currently recruiting new members! The registration forms are easy to fill out!Ray: That's splendid. Uncle Ray would love to join your little gang!Kay: I'm sorry, but we're only accepting bright, cheerful, and energetic girls.Ray: I see. That's too bad. Well, how about a hug then? As a sign of affection.Kay: ...No.Ray: I guess not. He he he. This isn't Europe after all.Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. What are you doing here?Ray: Oops. That's right! Sorry, sorry. Preventing the attorney from investigating the crime scene is the Von Karma way, isn't it?Edgeworth: ........Gumshoe: Hey! You've been going on about Von Karma this and Von Karma that. What's your problem, pal!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Detective! Restrain yourself. This... can't be helped.Gumshoe: Eh...?Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. Are you the defense attorney for Horace Knightley?Ray: That's right. Or should I say... I was his defense attorney.Edgeworth: (Mr. Shields is the defense attorney. If Knightley had not been murdered... ...I would have been going up against him in court... I should listen to what he has to say.)Edgeworth: The inmates cannot freely enter this room. As they're wearing bracelets that set off the sensors. According to the guard, it seems that no inmates were scheduled to enter this room today. However, a rubber glove used by the inmates was left in here. That is a direct contradiction!Gumshoe: Then, who left this rubber glove in here, sir?Edgeworth: I don't know... yet. However, it seems that this rubber glove is connected to our case.Edgeworth: Guard! Aside from the inmates and prison guards, does anyone else have access to the room?Guard: Umm. Well, this is a prison facility after all. Only inmates and prison guards come here...Edgeworth: Mr. Shields...?Ray: He he he. What are you saying? There are others that come in here. Aside from inmates and prison guards, there are certain things that can enter this room.Guard: ! Are you talking about them? But. They're...Edgeworth: Mr. Shields! What are these \"things\" that you speak of?Ray: It should be obvious. You came all the way here without seeing one, Prosecutor Edgeworth? Usually you can find them walking around the prison facility... Well, you'll see once you leave this room, Prosecutor Edgeworth.Gumshoe: Hey! You're just saying that to get Mr. Edgeworth to leave, pal!Ray: What now? Don't you trust me? Mr. Detective. You have a big body, but a small mind.Gumshoe: What did you say, pal!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe: Ugh... S-Sorry, sir.Ray: Come on. Follow me. I'll show you what Uncle Ray has been talking about.Ray: This place is a little different from your normal prison. There are more than just the prisoners and guards living here.Edgeworth: Animals...!Ray: Yep, animals. According to the guard... ...they introduced animal therapy here several years ago. Each prisoner is assigned one animal. In other words, they receive a pet partner.Kay: Huh! That... seems kinda fun!Ray: Plus, learning to take care of their pet is a great qualification to have.Kay: Ah! So you mean that workroom!Ray: Yep. That's where the prisoners practice taking care of their pets.Gumshoe: S-So then, the \"thing\" you mentioned, that could enter the crime scene is...Ray: Right. These animals.Gumshoe: But that doesn't make any sense, pal! Why would an animal leave behind a rubber glove!?Ray: He he he. Quite right. But the fact remains that they could have entered the crime scene.Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! Can you please talk some sense into this man!Edgeworth: Mr. Shields, are the animals allowed to go wherever they please?Ray: Most of the doors in this prison are fitted with sensors. The sensors not only sound an alarm in response to the prisoners' bracelets. They also respond to the animal's \"microchip\" and open the doors for them.Kay: Microchip?Ray: It's like a tiny machine embedded under the animal's skin. All it takes is a simple injection, \"psh!\", and the microchip is inserted.Kay: Whaaaa! Th-That sounds painful...Ray: I've heard it's not that painful... But, anyway. Since the animals aren't criminals, they are allowed to move around freely.Edgeworth: (How ironic... The ones with the most freedom in this prison are the animals...)Door Sensor data updated in my Organizer.Ray: But still, they can't go out of the prison. The prison's entrance does not have a sensor. .....Oh?Edgeworth: Hm? (What's that? Is that a bell...?)Gumshoe: Wh-What's that?........Edgeworth: (Wh-What's this... This dog? It has a bell on its collar... Was this the sound that we heard earlier?) ................ Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Why are you glaring at each other?Edgeworth: (...I mustn't lose!)Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth, you're not good with dogs, are you, sir? I'll tame that dog myself! Here boy, here boy! It completely ignored me, sir...Edgeworth: (Compared to the other animals, there's something different about this one. I'm sensing a great hostility towards me only...)Ray: Well, now that I've introduced you to the animals... What's next on the agenda?Gumshoe: Of course, we question those related to the case, pal!Edgeworth: Yes. We should gather information about the state of things when the body was discovered.Gumshoe: We'll start with... you in that cell! Tell us what you know!Prisoner: ........Gumshoe: H-He's completely ignoring me, sir...Edgeworth: Y-You there. Do you know anything about the incident?Prisoner: ........Kay: Uuugh... H-He's scary!Ray: He he he. Don't be so cold. Come on, you can talk to us. Or, how about an introductory hug?Prisoner: .....It's... time.Edgeworth: ! (Wh-What was that?)Ray: S-Sorry. Was Uncle Ray's joke a little too much?Prisoner: ........ ......Exercise time.Edgeworth: (This man... is clearly odd! I need to get some answers from him.) Your... name is?Elbird: Me... I'm prisoner number D-259. Jay Elbird. ...Gotta raise my metabolism. I can't let my muscles rest.Edgeworth: Muscles aside, it looks like you've lost a lot of weight.Elbird: Half of the match is won even before it has begun. Yeah... Gotta make the weight limit.Gumshoe: Err... Are you entering some kind of tournament? Ah! Perhaps as a boxer!Elbird: Yeah, I'm a former boxer, but exercise is just... a hobby of mine.Kay: Well then, it sure looks like it's the bear's hobby too! Hee hee... He's hanging on like an apron. So cute!Elbird: This is Rocky the polar bear. He's my partner.Edgeworth: (He's loosened his tongue. Maybe we can try asking him now...) Where were you and Rocky at the time of the incident.Elbird: ......I don't know anything. I got nothing to say to you.Edgeworth: That's for me to decide. Now, answer the question.Elbird: D-Didn't I just tell you? I know nothing!Edgeworth: (Nngh... He has no intention of talking.)Kay: In that case, you've got no choice but to use \"that\"!Edgeworth: Yes. If he insists he has nothing to do with this, we'll just have to prove there's a connection. Mr. Elbird, by all means, you WILL tell us what you know.Elbird: ...........Edgeworth: Now... Let's analyze the situation.Edgeworth: (A fighting stance... It seems that he has become agitated. In these circumstances, a direct confrontation would be pointless.) When my opponent becomes agitated, I should calmly wait and see... When I see an opening, I will not hold back! Now, let's question him about his knowledge of the incident. To start with, I'll ask about his movements today. I'll have to tire him out before the sound of the bell!Edgeworth: Can you tell me what you have done today?Elbird: ......Edgeworth: A-Answer me!Elbird: Huh? If you wanna fight with me... Get into your fighting stance!Edgeworth: .........Elbird: What, are you throwing in the towel already?Edgeworth: This is not a fist fight. Welcome to the war that is chess. By the way... Hasn't all that moving around tired you out?Elbird: Don't underestimate my stamina! You wanna test me? With that body of yours!Edgeworth: .....Elbird: I ain't tired at all. Well, first off... I held back in my training today. I just stayed quietly in my cell.Edgeworth: Quietly? Then what's with all that sweat?Elbird: ...B-Buzz off! That's all I've got to say. I'm getting a little tired...Edgeworth: You're a well-trained boxer... However, you need more practice in the art of lying. Getting a little tired? That's not possible! You said that you stayed quietly in your cell just a moment ago!Elbird: ...! Rocky. It looks like this is gonna be a tough opponent.Edgeworth: This man... It looks like he's still hiding something. Next, I'll ask him about the time of the incident. I do not need to use fists. My words alone are enough for a K.O.!Edgeworth: Let's try using that clue...Edgeworth: Stop telling such an obvious lie! Didn't you admit it earlier? You were exercising...!Elbird: Tsk... Looks like I just ate a counter.Edgeworth: Your back's against the ropes and there's no way out. Just confess already!Elbird: ...! H-Hey, quiet down a bit. If outsiders like you make a racket, you'll frighten the animals again.Edgeworth: You've been persistent. However, I'm afraid you're about to hit the mat. You said \"again\" just now. Did something happen earlier? To frighten the animals!?Elbird: Gyaaaaaaaaaaaah! D-Dammit...! How could I have gotten sucker punched like that! Y-Yeah... There was this great scream back then. It startled the animals. Dang! I would never have lost in a real ring!Edgeworth: Hmph... Checkmate.Edgeworth: I believe this proves that you do know something about the case.Elbird: .......Damn. OK, I'll talk, I'll talk!Kay: You did it, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth: Don't lose focus, Kay. The real game has just begun.Ray: Let's just stop for a moment. Uncle Ray's got one important thing to say. It must be fate that has brought us together after all these years. I have received the opportunity to observe your skills carefully. And... ...I'll be giving a detailed report to \"that person\" about how much you've grown.Edgeworth: ........Kay: Err... Who is \"that person\"?Ray: You didn't know? The truth is...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: This doesn't concern Kay. She doesn't need to know!Ray: Whoa there. You scared me. Don't get so worked up.Edgeworth: You can do what you like. It doesn't matter to me.Ray: ...How you have been leading your life ever since you were tainted by the Von Karma way... I'm sure \"that person\" would be interested. I feel that it's my duty to report it to him. I'll expose your mistakes here, I won't let you disappoint him any further.Kay: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Just what are you guys talking about?Edgeworth: Don't concern yourself with it. Our only opponent now is Elbird. Well then, let's hear it. What do you know about the case?Elbird: ...You're gonna be sorry.Elbird: Recreation time ended around 10 AM. I returned to this room and went straight to my training. Just as I'd counted to two, I heard a voice shout out, \"AAARGH! I've been stabbed!\" It sounded like someone in pain, calling out for help. But... I couldn't do anything since I was locked up in my cell. So, I went back to my training.Edgeworth: ...That's odd. You really weren't bothered by that shout?Elbird: Even if I was, there was nothing I could do. Look out for number one before you look out for others. That's the basic rule in prison.Ray: Indeed. Even if he wanted to take a look he'd still be locked in his cell.Edgeworth: Is all that training equipment yours? You seem to have quite a collection.Elbird: I get them from the Supplier.Kay: Supplier...?Elbird: You can get just about anything if you put in an order. It's our secret shop.Ray: That's quite convenient. So, if Uncle Ray wanted a cute girl...Edgeworth: In that case, you should order a book on how to give testimony. Hmph... Because I'm going to knock you down for the count in one hit.Elbird: You're gonna K.O. me? Stop kidding around...!Ray: Heeey... Don't ignore your Uncle Ray!Elbird: Recreation time ended around 10 AM.Elbird: I returned to this room and went straight to my training.Elbird: Just as I'd counted to two, I heard a voice shout out, \"AAARGH! I've been stabbed!\"Elbird: It sounded like someone in pain, calling out for help. But...Elbird: I couldn't do anything since I was locked up in my cell. So, I went back to my training.Kay: If this place wasn't a prison, Mr. Knightley might have been able to get help.Edgeworth: I don't believe he could have been saved.Kay: Eh! But, what if someone had come running to his aid...!Edgeworth: (Elbird is clearly lying. But... what possible reason would he have to do this? To find out, I'll have to point out the contradiction.)Edgeworth: Mr. Elbird. Can you hear my voice clearly?Elbird: Why you... You mocking me?Edgeworth: The victim received a fatal blow to the throat. Which means... he couldn't possibly have screamed.Elbird: !Edgeworth: So, why did you hear a nonexistent scream?Elbird: Th-That's...! There should have been a scream...Edgeworth: There should have been one?Elbird: Dang it! I oughta rip that smug look off your face! Yeah. You're right! I never heard a scream! The one who heard it was the guy in the next cell!Edgeworth: (The next cell...?)Kay: Uhh, the next cell...Prisoner: Ah? What's up? Yeah, I heard the scream. Recreation time had just ended. It happened after we returned to our cells. So then, I tell that guy, \"I heard a great scream.\"Edgeworth: Can you describe that scream for me?Prisoner: Sure, I never told that guy about the contents of the scream though... \"AIEEEEEEEEEE! Someone! Come quickly! A man's been...!\" Something like that.Ray: Hmm. So, it wasn't the victim...Edgeworth: ...but rather, it was the first person to discover the body who screamed.Kay: I see! That solves that mystery! So, there was nothing wrong with Mr. Elbird's testimony!Edgeworth: (Is that really true? Or is there still a problem with Elbird's testimony...)Edgeworth: No... In this case, a new problem has presented itself. Mr. Elbird, why did you not hear the scream?Gumshoe: It's odd that he didn't hear the scream, sir! Hey you! Why didn't you hear the scream, pal!Elbird: .......... Guaaaaaaaaah!Gumshoe: Aieeeeeeeee!Elbird: ...... ...You guys, do you suspect me? I was shut up in this stupid cell the whole time... How could I have killed someone in the workroom?Gumshoe: ! Th-That... would be impossible, wouldn't it?Prisoner: Yeah! None of us could've killed him! If we could've killed him, we would've already killed you guys by now!Gumshoe: Aieeeeee!Elbird: You guys, don't think you're going to get out of this prison alive...!Edgeworth: (I nearly forgot... Despite being locked inside cages, these guys are still dangerous criminals!)Ray: He he... Looks like we got ourselves in a pretty bad situation here.Edgeworth: (What can I do? I can't talk to them in these circumstances!)???:Gumshoe: Wh-Who was that????: ...Please be silent.Elbird: What? Who're you? Can't you see we're busy here!???: Silence is golden.Elbird: Wh-What the...???: Now, your hands. You shall remain silent while under the judgment of the law. You should be thankful. You get to live your life without the need of money. You are to receive the blessings of the Goddess of Law. Guard. ...If you would please.Guard: Congratulations. You get to spend the night in the disciplinary room.Elbird: Eh...! Th-That's! N-No! Not there! Anywhere but there!???: Accept this wonderful blessing! Let your heart be reborn! Cast away your sins!Elbird: Stop it! Noooooooooo!???: Oh, Goddess of Law. Give this man your blessings. ...I thank thee.Edgeworth: You are...?Gav\u00e8lle: My name is Verity Gav\u00e8lle. I am privileged to be a Judge... An emissary of the strength of the law.Edgeworth: A judge, you say? Why are you here?Gav\u00e8lle: Prosecutor Edgeworth... I came to meet with you personally. I convey the will of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee. That is my appointed task.Kay: Prosecutorial Investigation Committee? What's that?Gav\u00e8lle: Do not use that name so lightly. Those are the sacred words of the Goddess of Law.Ray: Since little Kay doesn't know, Uncle Ray will explain it for her! The P.I.C. is an assembly comprised of 11 members. Their job is to check if prosecutors are doing their jobs properly.Edgeworth: If I'm not mistaken, its members are elected from politicians and those of the legal profession. ...So, I take it you are one of those members?Gav\u00e8lle: ...Indeed. I am thankful they judged me worthy of such a task.Ray: I, too, am thankful that I was able to meet you here. Ahem. How about a hug of thankfulness?Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle: The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee also shares deep ties with the Bar Association.Ray: Hey, I was just kidding. No need to make such a scary face.Kay: Errr. So your job is to find bad prosecutors and punish them?Gav\u00e8lle: Well said! May you be blessed by the Goddess of Law. Our job is to remove problematic prosecutors from their cases. And so, those people not fit to be prosecutors... ...will be stripped of their Prosecutor's Badge.Gumshoe: Wh-What business does this Whatchamacallit Committee have with Mr. Edgeworth, pal! We're in the middle of an investigation here...???:???: Wow, you're thick. Seriously, how thickheaded can you be?Gumshoe: And just who do you think you are, pal!Debeste: Me? I'm a prosecutor. Sebastian Debeste is my name. Haven't you heard of me? At the Prosecutor's Office, everyone calls me \"The Best\". Ah, I'm so beloved there...Edgeworth: ...........I've never heard of you.Debeste: Hey you, Mr. Flatfoot. You've heard of me, right?Gumshoe: This is the first time, pal.Debeste: ...Oh well, It can't be helped. There's no way someone who's so thick on the intake could have good ears.Edgeworth: (Don't you mean \"slow on the uptake\"...?)Gav\u00e8lle: I suppose it's only natural as Sebastian only became a prosecutor last month.Edgeworth: (He's just a rookie prosecutor!?)Debeste: Right. The Best rookie prosecutor in the office...Gav\u00e8lle: ...Or so he plans to be.Debeste: Mr. Edgeworth. I'm here to clean up the mess you made.Kay: What do you mean!?Edgeworth: (The P.I.C. intends to have me replaced... That much is clear.) ...Mr. Debeste. I know what you're trying to say. However, I have not been informed of this. Your Honor. I would like an explanation.Gav\u00e8lle: Very well. This judgment has been passed under the name of the Goddess of Law. The incident at the president's welcoming event, and the murder of Horace Knightley... The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee has decreed that you will be taken off this case... ...and Sebastian has been appointed to take over the case. ...That's all.Gumshoe: Wh-Whaaaaaaat! You can't just take him off the case like that, pal!Edgeworth: Your Honor... I thought I asked for an explanation?Gav\u00e8lle: The judgement is guilty. The Goddess of Law's verdict is absolute.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I have done nothing to warrant being taken off this case!Gav\u00e8lle: You don't remember? Very well, in that case I shall remind you of your past crimes. You boarded the president's plane, which was protected by extraterritorial rights... ...and then, of all things, you ordered a search of the president's personnel.Edgeworth: ......Gav\u00e8lle: A single mistake could have sparked an international incident. You crossed the line as a prosecutor... You've gravely overstepped your authority.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I'll admit, my actions may have gone against the rules. However, if I had not taken that risk, I'm certain that the truth would never have been found. I have never considered my actions as a mistake!Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle: So, you're saying that as long as the ends justify the means... ...it's alright to ignore the rules. That is an extremely dangerous way of thinking. No one is above the rules. That is the spirit of the law.Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but... I cannot accept your way of thinking.Gav\u00e8lle: I see. That's a shame. Even so... ...the gavel must slam down at the conclusion of a trial. Even if you, or the defense attorney, or the suspect, do not consent to the verdict. All you can do is accept the blessings of the Goddess of Law. Or... will you fight it? And risk losing your badge?Edgeworth: (She means to take my badge if I don't obey.)Ray: Awwwww. That's too bad.Gav\u00e8lle: It seems you understand. Now then, guards. Please proceed.Gumshoe: Hold it right theeeere!Debeste: Hey, what are you doing! Aren't you supposed to be on our side? You should listen to the new prosecutor in charge.Gumshoe: Ehh! I don't wanna work for you, pal!Debeste: But, isn't that the job of a flatfoot?Edgeworth: (We're at an overwhelming disadvantage here... It's useless to resist any longer.) Detective Gumshoe! You are now under Mr. Debeste's authority.Gumshoe: B-But that's...!Edgeworth: Your Honor.Gav\u00e8lle: Yes? What is it?Edgeworth: This does not mean I have accepted your decision. We will meet again.Gav\u00e8lle: Certainly... I look forward to that day.Edgeworth: Let's go, Kay!Kay: Yeah...!Ray: Wait. Don't forget. I'll be reporting today's events to \"that person.\"Edgeworth: ......To be continued.Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! Just what happened yesterday!? Those two people! Their attitude was just unforgivable!Debeste: Mr. Edgeworth. I'm here to clean up the mess you made.Gav\u00e8lle: The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee has decreed that you will be taken off this case... ...and Sebastian has been appointed to take over the case. ...That's all.Edgeworth: (Judge Gav\u00e8lle and Mr. Debeste... They were certainly ruthless. But what I'm more concerned about is... ...just what is the P.I.C. thinking? ...I'm worried about what they will do from here on. I have a bad feeling about this...)Kay: Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! Are you listening to me?Edgeworth: Yes, I'm listening.Kay: You're not going to give up on this case, are you?Edgeworth: No. I don't plan on backing down, not with the current situation as it is. If I were to silently stand by, that would only validate their claims. (But I no longer have investigation rights. What should I do now?) What is it, Detective Gumshoe?Gumshoe: B-Bad news, sir! I heard something down at the precinct... It sounds like they've already arrested a suspect in yesterday's case!Edgeworth: What! Who is it?Gumshoe: I don't know yet, sir... But if we go down to the detention center, we can talk!Kay: Let's get going! Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth: (Even if I can't investigate, meeting with the suspect should not be an issue.) Alright, we're heading over to the detention center now.Gumshoe: I'll also head over on the double, sir!Edgeworth: Detective. Won't that interfere with your job?Gumshoe: I gotta investigate the scene of the crime anyway, so it should be OK, sir!Edgeworth: Alright. We'll meet up with you there.Gumshoe: Roger, sir!Edgeworth: Let's go, Kay!Kay: OK!Edgeworth: ..........Kay: .......... ...He's not coming, is he?Edgeworth: He's not.Kay: It's happening all over again!Edgeworth: ...Don't joke about that.???: No way! I mean it! It's not happening!Guard: Yes. It's happening alright! There's just someone here to talk to you!Edgeworth: (Hm...?)Kay: That sounds like a pretty screechy voice, huh????: Nowaynowaynoway...!Guard: Don't be so stubborn!???: But aren't prosecutors crazy scary or something? Always giving you a death glare!Edgeworth: Um, pardon me, but would you happen to be the suspect...????: Aaaaahhh! I knew ittt!Edgeworth: Kay, why does this man seem so distraught?Kay: Well, because you're, uh, you!Edgeworth: (That doesn't help me at all...)Kay: Hello, Mr. Suspect!???: !Kay: Would you mind talking to us for a little bit????: Wh-Who are you?Kay: I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant, Kay Faraday! Well, it's just a part-time job. I'm just taking a vacation from my real job!Edgeworth: ...I don't remember hiring you.Kay: This is Mr. Edgeworth. He's a prosecutor, but he's not as scary as he looks, so it's OK.Edgeworth: (Hmph. How rude...!)???: R-Really?Kay: Really! Really!Edgeworth: Really.???: Eek!Edgeworth: ......Kay: Anyway, can you tell us your name, Mr. Suspect?Simeon: ...Yeah. Uh... I-I'm Simeon Saint...Kay: Nice to meet you, Simeon! You can just call me \"Kay\", 'kay?Edgeworth: I am Miles Edgeworth, a prosecutor. I would appreciate a word with you.Simeon: ...!Kay: Please! It's for your own good, Simeon!Simeon: ...Really?Edgeworth: (Finally. It looks like we'll be able to get something out of him, thanks to Kay.)Edgeworth: So, why were you arrested? (Hm, I guess he still won't respond to me...)Simeon: ........W-Well, I don't know.Kay: Looks like he's finally warming up to you.Edgeworth: (Whew, that's a great help.)Simeon: This morning, a police officer barged into my house... And before I knew it, he had brought me here...Edgeworth: Was there a prosecutor accompanying him at that time?Simeon: Ahh. I remember a prosecutor called Du-um... Best or something was there too.Edgeworth: (So, it was that rookie prosecutor...)Kay: Then, I guess the police haven't dragged you into questioning yet, huh?Simeon: A-Are the p-police going to interrogate me?Kay: Yup. That's right. Because you're the suspect.Simeon: Nowaynowaynowaynoway...! Aren't detectives like crazy abusive or something? Always bossing you around with their big bodies!Gumshoe: Detective Gumshoe is on the scene!Simeon: Aaaaaaaaahhhhh! I knew ittttt! Please don't beat me with your thick arms! I can't take it anymore! Someone call the police!Gumshoe: ....... What's gotten into him, sir?Edgeworth: Well... It's because you're you, Detective.Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it, sir...Kay: I know Simeon has to be innocent, Mr. Edgeworth! Can't we do something...?Edgeworth: ...Simeon Saint.Simeon: Y-Y-Y-Yes!?Edgeworth: You were Mr. Knightley's best friend. You only just met with him two days ago... You say you didn't kill him. Are you certain about this?Simeon: ......Y-Yes, I am. I-I wouldn't harm a fly!Edgeworth: I see. That's enough for me. I shall offer my assistance in proving your innocence.Simeon: Eh! Wh-What's the point in helping little ol' me?Edgeworth: It's not just for you. This case, I have a personal stake in it as well.Kay: That's right! We gotta get back at those two from yesterday!Gumshoe: Yeah! I'm fired up, sir!Edgeworth: But, I don't have any investigation rights at the moment. Since I won't be able to obtain information myself, your role is most vital. I'm sure we can rely on you to fill in any holes in the information we have. Help us help you... That's all I ask.Gumshoe: Ah! I just had an idea! Why don't you just borrow a defense attorney's badge, sir!Kay: Come on! There's no way Mr. Edgeworth could do that. This isn't the time to be joking around!Gumshoe: B-But I wasn't joking... Helping the suspect is a defense attorney's job, pal...Kay: Jeez. Don't worry about that! It doesn't matter what Mr. Edgeworth's job is. All we gotta do is find the real murderer! So, let's get movin'!Gumshoe: OK, pal!Edgeworth: I'm sure you understand, but if the investigation results prove that you are the murderer... No hard feelings, but I will show no mercy...Simeon: Eeeeeee...!Edgeworth: But, you don't need to be scared. I believe in your story... At least for now.Simeon: ........Edgeworth: All you need to do is believe in us and wait patiently... There's nothing to fear. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be off.Kay: ...So, we're all fired up and ready to go. But we still can't enter the part of the prison where the murder occurred...Gumshoe: If you can't investigate, the only thing you can do now is defend him in court, sir.Kay: But how are we supposed to do that? We can't!Ray: Huh? If it isn't Prosecutor Edgeworth and his merry gang. What are you guys doing here?Gumshoe: Did you come here to harass Mr. Edgeworth again, pal?Ray: He he he. What're you talking about, big guy? Uncle Ray's just here to do his job.Kay: Your job? Oh yeah, you're a defense attorney, right?Ray: Oh, Kay! You're as cute-iful as ever!Edgeworth: (Cute-iful...?)Ray: I might not look like it, but your Uncle Ray's a hotshot defense attorney. I'm here to meet with a new client today. What was his name again? Shy Monkees or something...Kay: What? You mean Simeon Saint?Ray: That's it! Kay! Looks like you know the deal.Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! He's the defense attorney!Edgeworth: (I thought as much. Guess we have no choice but to resort to that method. In the past, whenever I had to investigate cases I was not placed in charge of... ...I was able to gain access by becoming a subordinate to whomever was in charge. Not my preferred opinion, but it's the only one I have now...) Mr. Shields. If I may ask...Ray: By the way... I don't take on sidekicks.Edgeworth: !Ray: I refuse to take on male assistants who lack charm. Especially... Someone who was like a son to Von Karma.Edgeworth: (Mr. Shields... As I thought, he won't forgive me so easily.) Mr. Shields. I understand that you cannot forgive me for what I've done. I am also fully aware of your hatred towards those involved with Von Karma. I don't know if you'll believe me, but... ...I am no longer the same as I was back then... Back when I idolized Von Karma.Gumshoe: Yeah, pal! Mr. Edgeworth is a changed man! Sure, he may have been a cruel, inhuman prosecutor in the past... ...but now, he's completely different, pal!Edgeworth: (When you put it that bluntly, it kind of hurts...)Kay: That's right! Mr. Edgeworth's not a bad guy anymore! I wouldn't even call him a prosecutor! He's more like... Uh... Umm... A hero! Yeah! He even helped me out in that big case last month!Ray: A hero... That's some pretty big talk there, missy.Kay: He's a magnificent hero! Although he'd be no match for a Great Thief like me!Ray: ......Edgeworth: Mr. Shields, don't the actions of the P.I.C. appear... strange to you? I believe there may be something else hidden behind this case. I can't afford to... quit at this juncture! Please let me help you with the investigation. I am begging you.Ray: ...... ...Heh. I never expected you to grovel like this. It sure looks like you've changed, alright. And I'm kinda interested... in the cause of all this.Edgeworth: You're interested... in what changed me? If I had to say, it would probably be... the courtroom itself. All the experiences I've had and all the people I've met inside the courtroom. And perhaps... Reuniting with my old friends.Ray: ...... He he he... I never expected you of all people to change. Who would've thought that you'd lay open your heart like that. I'm sure that man would be surprised as well. Guess I can't turn you away. It may be long overdue... But allow me to properly reintroduce myself. If you would be so kind as to read this...Gumshoe: Edgeworth Law Offices Raymond Shields, Head Attorney...?Kay: E-Edgeworth...?Edgeworth: Mr. Shields was an assistant to my deceased father... Gregory Edgeworth.Kay: Really? Your father was a defense attorney? S-So that means that man Mr. Shields talked about is...Ray: Correct, my cute little Kay. Prosecutor Edgeworth's old man. I never changed the name of the firm. It's my way of showing my appreciation for his help. Prosecutor Edgeworth. No, wait... Miles. Uncle Ray doesn't fully trust you just yet. It may have been temporary, but the fact remains: you were once a disciple of Von Karma. You say that you've changed, but you'll need to prove it to me with your actions. Even your old man... Would've wanted it this way.Edgeworth: ...Yes, I understand.Ray: Alright. I'm getting tired of all this stuffy talk, so let's give it a rest and move on... For now, I'll make you my temporary assistant. How does that sound?Edgeworth: I'm sorry to trouble you...Ray: But... this outcome is kinda moving, yeah? The prodigal son returning to work in his late father's law firm.Kay: What about me! What about me!Ray: Of course, you can help too, Kay.Kay: Alright! Thanks a lot, Mr. Shields! I mean, Boss!Ray: Now then, let's get right to work. Let's see.. First off... What do you think we should do, Miles?Edgeworth: (That's right... I had some unfinished business yesterday.)Ray: Hmm. So, it wasn't the victim...Edgeworth: ...but rather, it was the first person to discover the body who screamed.Edgeworth: Why don't we find them and listen to what they have to say?Ray: Yeah, that's it! Uncle Ray thinks so, too.Edgeworth: (Hmph. Upbeat as always.)Kay: OK! With that decided, let's hurry up and grill him!Gumshoe: Um... Sir, what am I supposed to do? Detectives can't help defense attorneys!Edgeworth: (Hmm... I can't just leave him be...) Detective, I will give you a special assignment. I want you to assist Mr. Debeste in his investigation and follow his orders. And then, if you discover anything useful, I want you to share it with us. Detective. This is a job that only you can do. Can we count on you?Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir! Leave it to me! I'm really good at leaking investigation reports to defense attorneys!Edgeworth: (Normally, that would be a problem for me, but it may come in handy this time.)Ray: Alright, let's get moving, shall we? Time to go to jail!Ray: Now then, where's the person who first discovered the body?Edgeworth: For now, all we can do is ask around.???: Hold it right there!Edgeworth: (Who is this woman?) Umm... Excuse me, but...???: Oh, you are simply irresistible!Ray: Huh? Do you mean... me????: Very nice, very nice, indeed! What an elegant mustache.Ray: It's a pleasure to meet you, mademoiselle. Defense attorney Ray Shields, at your service. How about we exchange greetings with a hug????: Oh ho ho ho. But of course.Ray: Mmf! Mmmmmmmf! Uncle Ray's... l-lips...???: A proper greeting should begin with a hug AND a kiss!Kay: It's almost like... it was stolen from him!Edgeworth: Yes, a remarkable feat of quickness that would put a Great Thief to shame.???: I feel that close contact is very important. This goes for my family here in my home as well.Ray: Q-Quite a splendid way of thinking there. He he he.Laguarde: I am the warden, Fifi Laguarde. But please, just call me Patty.Edgeworth: (The warden...? So she's in charge of the prison and detention center?) Nice to meet you. I am Miles Edgeworth. I'm a prosec... I mean, I'm Mr. Shield's assistant. Pardon me for asking, but were you here in the prison yesterday?Laguarde: But of course! Yesterday was a day that I wouldn't have missed for the world!Edgeworth: \"Wouldn't have missed for the world\"? Did you have some kind of important meeting...?Laguarde: Oh heavens, no! I despise meetings! It was the Animal Show, of course! A wonderful spectacle, featuring animals dancing and flying through the air! I always see it along with everyone else in our home! We're one big, happy family! We built a special stage in the courtyard just for this performance.Edgeworth: (A performance for the prisoners' enjoyment... Yesterday, Elbird mentioned some kind of \"recreation\"... I suppose the Animal Show was what he was referring to.) When did this show take place?Laguarde: It started at 8 AM and ended around 10 AM.Edgeworth: (That's exactly when the body was discovered... So whoever saw the show would probably have an alibi.)Laguarde: Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be going. I have business to attend to. Please take your time and have a look around our home!Kay: So, where should we start, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: There was a prisoner who heard the scream from the person who first discovered the body. Let's start by talking with him.Kay: Hellooooo! Is this occupied?Ray: Kay, that's not a restroom. Hey, guard. Do you have a minute?Guard: Sir! What is it?Ray: Is anyone using that workroom right now?Guard: Presently, there is one prisoner working inside! I'm positive he's been there since the noon roll call!Edgeworth: We would like to ask the prisoner a few questions, if that is acceptable...Guard: Yes, sir! I will bring him out, so please wait a moment!Ray: I'll leave this to you, Miles.Edgeworth: Wh-What do you mean?Ray: 'Cause I don't know what kind of scary guy will come out of that room.Kay: Mr. Shields. You're a scaredy-cat? Even though you're an adult?Ray: He he he. Same to you, Kay.Edgeworth: (Here he comes...)???: Oh, good day to you, sirs. Are you the ones who requested my presence?Edgeworth: (He doesn't seem like a dangerous criminal...) My name is Miles Edgeworth. I'm a prosecutor.???: A prosecutor... Is that right?Ray: I'm Ray Shields, a defense attorney.Edgeworth: (Mr. Shields... His demeanor completely changed once he saw who we were dealing with...)Ray: Sorry about that. He he. My assistant says strange things sometimes. He's not a prosecutor, just my assistant. Hey! Get your act together, Miles.Edgeworth: (Hmm, I guess I messed up... I forgot about my \"new job\".)???: No wonder I thought you were different from the prosecutor who visited me yesterday.Edgeworth: (It looks like he's already spoken to Debeste.) May we ask you a few questions?Sahwit: ...Oh, yes. Of course you may. My name is Frank Sahwit.Ray: OK. Go for it, Miles.Edgeworth: (I guess I'll be asking the questions after all... *sigh*...) Mr. Sahwit, you are aware of the murder that occurred here yesterday, correct? Where were you when the body was discovered?Sahwit: I was... in this room, where I had been working.Edgeworth: What kind of work?Sahwit: Well, my goal is to become a pet groomer. An animal beautician, so to speak. Oh yes. I was inside cultivating my skills.Edgeworth: (In any other prison, such training would be unheard of...)Sahwit: That was all. Honestly. I-I did not see a thing.Edgeworth: (Hm? Why did he say that? I haven't even asked him anything yet.)Sahwit: Which is why, sad to say, I won't be any help to you.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Mr. Sahwit... I haven't asked you anything yet.Sahwit: ! No... Wait. That's... Even if you were to ask, I would not...Edgeworth: You... know something, doesn't you?Sahwit: ...! Oh, oh... That's... ........Edgeworth: (It seems he is indeed hiding something. Let's try to press it out of him...)Edgeworth: First let us assess the layout of the board. My opponent's condition is...Sahwit: I'm afraid I didn't see a thing. So, I won't be any help to you.Edgeworth: (This man's expressions do not change much. It's a true poker face. It may be difficult to read his emotions from his body language.) Perhaps I should focus on how he phrases his words. It may reveal what's on his mind. Now, for the opening move... I'll start by asking about who this man is. Even if he hides his emotions, if I push the right buttons I'm sure I'll cause a change!Edgeworth: Are you... involved with this case?Sahwit: Are you referring to the murder that occurred inside this prison? I had nothing to do with it at all.Edgeworth: ...Is that true?Sahwit: I-I would never dream of being involved in a murder plot. Hm... How should I put it... I'm... an upright, model citizen after all...Edgeworth: Common sense tells me... ...an upright, model citizen would have never ended up behind bars.Sahwit: W-Well, that is...Edgeworth: Tell me what you know about the incident!Sahwit: I already told you, I don't know a damn thing! Oh, er... I really don't know anything.Edgeworth: ........Sahwit: I apologize from the bottom of my heart for that outburst... But I will be of no assistance.Edgeworth: Pardon my rudeness. It's just that the murder occurred in this rather confined prison. It seems unnatural that you do not know anything about it.Sahwit: ...Oh? Er... U-Unnatural... Is that so? I-If you're looking for the person who discovered the body... You should try someone else...Edgeworth: How did you know we were looking for the person who discovered the body? I don't recall saying a word about that. Are you sure you don't know anything?Sahwit: ...! N-No... It was merely a hunch I had. I am but a humble pet groomer in training. I honestly have no recollection of the murder.Edgeworth: I am positive that this man is hiding something. For my next move... I'll ask him about his movements on the day of the murder. This man has suppressed his emotions. I will expose his true nature hidden beneath that suspicious smile!Edgeworth: Let's talk about what happened on the day of the murder. If you truly had nothing to do with it, there shouldn't be a problem, correct?Sahwit: Oh... Well... O-On the day of the murder... There was a lot going on...Edgeworth: Let's try using that clue...Edgeworth: You don't remember? Ridiculous. Didn't you say earlier that you heard a scream?Sahwit: That wasn't... I could very well be mistaken... At any rate, I honestly do not remember.Edgeworth: You still do not remember? Enough with your lies!Sahwit: I ain't lyin', you...! ...I mean, I'm telling the truth.Edgeworth: ........Sahwit: In any case... I was absorbed in grooming the animals.Edgeworth: By the way... How skilled would you say you are in animal grooming?Sahwit: My techinique with the scissors still needs some work... But I am very confident in my handling of the animals. When the animals became frightened, I calmed them with my gentle hands...Edgeworth: ...Frightened? Why would the animals have become frightened? I don't think that's a common occurrence...Sahwit: W-Well... That's a good thing... Isn't it?Edgeworth: Perhaps the reason they were frightened was because of someone's scream? Why are you trying so hard to hide the fact that there was a scream! Are you concealing some vital information from me?Sahwit: Argh! I-I am doing nothing of the sort! I-It's true that I heard some sort of scream... But I'm not trying to hide it!Edgeworth: He's starting to show his true colors. I should be more aggressive with my next move. I'll ask him about the scream. It's time to give him a taste... ...of the futility of keeping a secret from me!Edgeworth: Let's try using that clue...Edgeworth: Just how deep are you going to dig your pit of lies? It's obvious that you did not see the Animal Show!Sahwit: Urgh!Edgeworth: There's no way out of this! Tell me what really happened! Confess everything you know about the scream!Sahwit: I cannot answer... What I cannot answer... I-I didn't hear the scream... from the person who discovered the body...Edgeworth: That's strange. Normally, if you hear a scream during a murder, it's usually from the victim. Why would you think the scream was from the person who discovered the body?Sahwit: Oh! M-My mistake!Edgeworth: How? How did you know the scream was from the person who discovered the body?Sahwit: W-Well... That's because...Edgeworth: Allow me to answer for you. That's because you're the one who discovered the body. And... ...the scream that was heard when the murder occurred didn't come from the victim... It came from you when you discovered the body!Sahwit: Urrrrrrrraaaagh! J-Just who do you think you are!? I-It is just as you say, but... What gives you the right to do this?Edgeworth: Hmph... Checkmate.Edgeworth: It's now clear who discovered the body. You have no more reason to withhold your testimony... Correct?Sahwit: V-Very well, I'll tell you... B-But I doubt my testimony is worth hearing...Edgeworth: Whether or not it is worth hearing is for me to decide. I will expose the truth with my own hands. That is my sole duty.Kay: Umm. I think you're a little off there, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth: What do you mean?Kay: We're not trying to expose the truth, we're trying to save Simeon! Isn't our goal to help out our clients? I mean, you're not a prosecutor right now, you're a defense attorney's assistant!Edgeworth: ...Hmm.Ray: Well said there, Kay! She's right on the money, Miles. The official task of the Edgeworth Law Offices is to defend our clients. Your old man, who founded the firm, truly valued the bonds he had with his clients. So, if you're not willing to do the same, maybe you aren't cut out for this job. I don't wanna fire you on the spot either. So have a heart, OK?Edgeworth: ...... (The heart of a defense attorney, huh...) In any case, it's important that we hear the testimony of the person who discovered the body. Start talking, Mr. Sahwit. Tell me what happened when you found the body!Sahwit: I was in the workroom over there practicing my skills. By some chance, I got curious about the adjacent workroom, and went up to the door. I peeked in through the small window on the door. Then I saw him lying there... A man... not moving... dead! I quailed in fright and found myself letting out a scream.Edgeworth: If I may confirm one thing... You were in the room... Right next to the one where the dead body was found?Sahwit: Within the prison, we call it Workroom B.Edgeworth: And were you in there the whole time on the day of the murder?Sahwit: Yes. After the 7 AM roll call, I remained inside the whole time. In this prison, we have roll call 3 times a day. At 7 AM, noon, and 9 PM.Edgeworth: And they check the workrooms during those times, too?Sahwit: Exactly.Edgeworth: (I see... So during the 7 AM roll call, there was nothing amiss. And Knightley's body was not in the workroom yet...)Prison Roll Call notes jotted down in my Organizer.Ray: So it sounds like the murder occurred after 7 AM, huh?Kay: And that's right when the Animal Show started!Sahwit: Correct. The other prisoners went to see the Animal Show.Edgeworth: Meaning anyone who did not see the show does not have an alibi... Do you understand what I'm saying, Mr. Sahwit?Sahwit: Y-Yes, that is certainly true... H-However, I merely discovered the body...Edgeworth: (His testimony has a clear contradiction. I should press him about that first.)Sahwit: I was in the workroom over there practicing my skills.Sahwit: By some chance, I got curious about the adjacent workroom, and went up to the door.Sahwit: I peeked in through the small window on the door.Sahwit: Then I saw him lying there... A man... not moving... dead!Sahwit: I quailed in fright and found myself letting out a scream.Edgeworth: (He's pretending to be an innocent bystander, but parts of his testimony are odd. Considering his situation, and the place he's in... The contradiction should be quite obvious. I'll show him the evidence that proves it!)Edgeworth: ...Mr. Sahwit. Please stop telling such feeble lies. You don't seem to understand your position.Sahwit: My position? I-I used to be a newspaper salesman, but then I took up the pet groomer training...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: What about that bracelet on your wrist? It proves that you are... unmistakably a prisoner. And as long as you wear that bracelet, you should not be able to move around as you please! As soon as you went through the door, the sensor would have sounded the alarm.Sahwit: Oh, er... That is...Edgeworth: Peeking into the adjacent room is impossible... When you couldn't even leave the one you were in!Sahwit: Argh!Ray: Whoo-wee! Nice one, Miles! That was a real humdinger!Kay: But does that mean Mr. Sahwit didn't see the body?Edgeworth: I'm not sure. Perhaps... We should let the man himself explain it to us.Sahwit: Huh? Umm... You see... That is... Well... Forgive me. It appears my previous explanation was lacking... I shall clearly explain how I was able to see the body.Edgeworth: Hmph. Very well, let us hear your revised testimony.Sahwit: There is a rather well-known technique among the prisoners here... If the hand with the bracelet stays in the room, you can step out without sounding the alarm. That's how I was able to peek into the adjacent room. The moment I realized that the man inside was dead, I let out a scream.Edgeworth: (Hmm, so that means... He kept his arm inside workroom B, while he peeked into the adjacent room.)Sahwit: I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to everyone. Especially the guards... OK?Edgeworth: (Was that what he was trying to hide earlier...? I should try asking him for more details about a few other things as well.)Sahwit: There is a rather well-known technique among the prisoners here...Sahwit: If the hand with the bracelet stays in the room, you can step out without sounding the alarm.Sahwit: That's how I was able to peek into the adjacent room.Sahwit: The moment I realized that the man inside was dead, I let out a scream.Sahwit: And to my horror, there was a black dog biting his neck!Sahwit: He most likely had passed away already. His hands moved nary an inch...Sahwit: The ring with the snowflake insignia glimmered, with no purpose but to catch my eye.Edgeworth: A ring with a snowflake insignia...?Sahwit: Yes, that is correct. It was clearly engraved on the surface.Edgeworth: I see. Your testimony is very accurate, But it's a little TOO accurate, if you ask me.Sahwit: And what's wrong with being accurate?Edgeworth: You state that you saw a ring with a snowflake insignia engraved into it. And it is true that the victim was wearing such a ring.Sahwit: See? Was I not correct?Edgeworth: That is not the issue I have with your testimony. Take a look at this picture! As you can see, the right hand is covered by a sheet. It should not have been possible for you to see the engraving on the ring. Unless you had approached the body and lifted up the sheet for yourself! You said you only looked into the workroom through the door. And yet, you gave such a detailed account of what you saw.Sahwit: Who do you think you are...? Acting all high and mighty. I-I'm telling you, I saw what I saw! Oh! The victim must have moved his arm after I saw it...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I don't think so. You said as much earlier.Sahwit: The man did not even flinch...Edgeworth: (He must have been dead already...)Edgeworth: The victim was already dead. How would he have been able to move his arm?Sahwit: ......!Ray: This guy's lookin' pretty suspicious now, yeah?Edgeworth: Frank Sahwit! What are you hiding, you scoundrel!Sahwit: ......Ooh. No, I ain't... I am not... That is... You're wrong. I know what I saw... ...Urrrrrgh... Gwaaaaaaaaaaaah! Shut up already! Stop making a fuss about every little thing I say! You're just a defense attorney's assistaaaant!!Edgeworth: (...He has finally shown his true self...)Ray: Whoa. I guess the cat's out of the bag. A black, hairy one at that. ...Just went flyin'.Sahwit: I'm just your friendly neighborhood witness!Edgeworth: Are you really just a witness? I would you say that you are rather suspicious.Sahwit: What was that?Edgeworth: You saw something that could not have been seen from the outside of the room. How is that possible? ...The logic behind it is simple. Mr. Sahwit. This is where you saw the body from!Edgeworth: When you discovered the body, you went inside the room where it laid! Since you saw the engraving on the ring, that is the only possibility!Sahwit: .......... Heh... He he! Even if you say that, you ain't got no evidence, do ya? Where's the evidence that shows that I was in that room? I was grooming pets at that time. In the room adjacent to where the body was found! I even went so far as to borrow some rubber gloves! Show me the evidence that proves I was in the room where the body was found!Edgeworth: Mr. Sahwit, what were you doing when the body was discovered?Sahwit: Didn't I tell you already? I was practicing being a pet groomer!Edgeworth: I see. In that case... Do you happen to recognize this glove?Sahwit: Oh! Th-That's...!Edgeworth: This was found near the body. It is believed to have been dropped by the culprit. By the way... I noticed that you also have a rubber glove hanging out of your apron pocket...Sahwit: N-No, this is... something else!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Looks like you're missing one of your gloves.Sahwit: Y-You can find gloves like these anywhere in the prison! Your evidence proves nothing!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Hmph. Perhaps we should hand this glove over to the police for fingerprinting. I'm certain they will find some interesting results.Sahwit: Grr... Grr... Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!!Edgeworth: (It's over...)Ray:Edgeworth: (Wh-What the...?)Ray: He he he. Pretty cool, right? My \"Objection!\" voice.Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. Could you save the jokes for later...Ray: I'm not joking. Because it's not over yet. There's still something else. Something that's clearly odd. That guy's a prisoner, y'know. He's got the bracelet and all.Sahwit: ..........Kay: That's right! How did he get into the other workroom? The sensor would have set off the alarm, right?Edgeworth: (...He's right. That's the only thing we don't know yet.)Ray: Not so fast, Mr. Prisoner. Could you fill us in?Sahwit: ..........Ray: That's pretty weird. The bracelet should have been his last line of defense.Kay: Defense?Ray: That's right, Kay. It was useful evidence for Mr. Prisoner here. He could have claimed that due to the bracelet, he wasn't able to enter the room... But, he didn't say a word about it. Is there any reason why you didn't?Sahwit: ..........Ray: The silent treatment, eh? Well, the Judge yesterday did say that silence is golden.Kay: W-Wow... You really are a hotshot defense attorney, Mr. Shields!Ray: Defense attorneys always remain calm in a pinch, and smile in the face of danger. That's what your old man taught me. The Defense Attorney's Creed, yeah? ...So, what's the deal? Why didn't you mention anything about the bracelet?Sahwit: .......... ...The truth is... It's broken.Edgeworth: (Broken?)Sahwit: Some time ago, I took a spill and the bracelet hit the floor with a loud bang. Ever since then, it was not been able to activate the sensor. Forgive me. It was so convenient, I didn't want to report it...Edgeworth: I see... So the bracelet was broken. (But did it really break so easily? If that is true, then there is a problem with the prison's security.)Edgeworth: You, over there. May I have a moment?Guard: Here, kitty kitty. You're such a cute little guy! Yes, you are! Meow~!Edgeworth: Excuse me!Guard: Y-Yes! What can I do for meow?Edgeworth: This prisoner's bracelet appears to be broken.Guard: What! Really!? That's not good at all. I'll contact the person in charge and have it replaced immediately!Edgeworth: Thank you. I'll be holding onto the broken bracelet for the time being.Sahwit's Bracelet data jotted down in my Organizer.Guard: Yes, sir! Please take care of it.Ray: Now that the bracelet's been taken care of, shall we move on to arresting you for murder?Sahwit: What? Perish the thought! I didn't kill anyone!Ray: But your bracelet was broken, right? Doesn't that mean you could have gone anywhere you wanted during the Animal Show?Sahwit: But all I did was find the body! Honest! And it is true that I saw the dog biting his neck! However, I entered the workroom after the dog had left...Edgeworth: Why did you do that?Sahwit: Well, it was just... I was curious if he had anything of value on him...Edgeworth: (So he was planning to loot the corpse. That's why he remembers Knightley's ring so well.)Kay: Why are you looking at me, Mr. Edgeworth!? I am a GREAT Thief! Please don't put me on the same level as him!Sahwit: But! I didn't take a thing! The Animal Show had ended and the other prisoners were making their way back down here. I hurried back to my workroom, and let out a scream to deceive the others.Ray: And that's when you dropped your rubber glove.Rubber Glove data updated in my Organizer.Ray: I guess his story holds up. What do you think, Miles?Edgeworth: Whether he is the murderer or not, one big question remains. How did Knightley get all the way from his holding cell to the prison?Ray: You're right about that. It's a real stumper.Edgeworth: And there's something Mr. Sahwit said in his testimony that I'm very concerned about. (If that dog had any part in the murder...) Mr. Sahwit.Sahwit: Y-Y-Yes! What is it?Edgeworth: Were there any other prisoners who didn't see the Animal Show?Sahwit: ...Yes. There is only one other that I know of.Edgeworth: And this prisoner wouldn't have been able to see the show even if he wanted to. Correct?Sahwit: Y-Yes, that's correct. Why do you ask?Edgeworth: (Just as I thought... I had my suspicions as soon as I saw that black dog. That fiendish criminal... I never expected him to be held here in this prison.) Where is his cell...?Sahwit: Err... Do you intend to meet him?Kay: Him...? Who's him?Sahwit: He's a very special man. He receives very special treatment, and... ...Oh, forgive me. I need to watch what I say about him. However... If you value your lives, I would advise you to stay away from him.Kay: Hey! C-Cut it out already! You're giving me the creeps!Ray: Hm, a puppet master in the shadows, huh? Yeah... I still value my life...Sahwit: He is being held in the special cell. Over there... In that direction...Edgeworth: (The special cell...? It certainly seems like he receives special treatment.)Floor Plans updated in my Organizer.Kay: Well, so just who is this \"him\" anyway?Sahwit: ...To protect my own life, all I can tell you is that he is the oldest prisoner here. My deepest apologies... But I can't say anymore... He is truly terrifying!Edgeworth: ......Ray: Care to fill me in? It feels like you're leaving Uncle Ray behind here.Edgeworth: He is someone I knew in the past... Let's head for the special cell. I believe that black dog should be there as well.Kay: Hey, it's pitch black in here... I can't see a thing at all!Edgeworth: Aren't you always talking about how the Yatagarasu is able to flap even in the darkest night?Kay: Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu!Ray: Oh-ho! That was pretty cool!Kay: But still, I can't see what I can't see! I'm still just a human! Eek!Ray: Aahhh!???: .....Mr. Edgeworth, I presume?Edgeworth: (That voice... It can only be...)???: It has been far too long.Edgeworth: So you still remember me????: Keh heh, it would be impossible to forget. Because it was you who did what none could do... ...and place me here in this cell.Kay: Um... Don't tell me that the dog is talking to you, Mr. Edgeworth.Ray: Is there someone else there? I can't see anything though...Kanis: Down boy. It is rude to frighten the visitors. Here. Allow me to illuminate this dark room. Keh heh heh... Such noisy visitors. From the voices and footsteps... Two more in the back. But it would be rude not to introduce myself. I am called Bodhidharma Kanis. Mr. Edgeworth and I... We are old acquaintances. Keh heh heh...Edgeworth: (This man is a former assassin.) The blind assassin... Bodhidharma Kanis. His weapons are sharp knives and a ferocious dog. His appearance is always accompanied by the sound of a bell. It is said that the ringing of this bell in the darkness is the last sound his victims hear.Kanis: Would you be so kind as to share the reason why you have come, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: That will not be necessary. You are already well aware of why we're here.Kanis: Keh heh heh. It seems we know each other quite well.Edgeworth: Do you know who was murdered?Kanis: It was Horace Knightley. A most unfortunate lad.Edgeworth: Your ears are as sharp as ever.Kanis: They are all I can rely on.Edgeworth: (As I thought, he has full knowledge of everything that goes on in this prison.)Kanis: On second thought, he might be fortunate after all.Edgeworth: Fortunate? How so?Kanis: He committed a grave crime, but he was able to avoid punishment for it. An assassination attempt on the president... What a bold man.Edgeworth: (Assassination attempt?)Kay: Hey! Mr. Edgeworth! Didn't Mr. Knightley just...Edgeworth: He may have killed his own superior, but he never attempted to take the president's life. (Are they trying to conceal the fact the assassination was staged by the president?)Ray: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold your horses. Knightley didn't attack the president? But Uncle Ray was requested to defend him in court on charges of attempted assassination.Kay: You didn't know either, Uncle Ray? So, they're trying to pin the whole thing on Mr. Knightley...?Edgeworth: Now I see why the P.I.C. is taking action.Kay: Ah! So that's why they removed you from the case...Ray: That DaPest guy was going to indict him on charges of attempted assassination.Kay: And in doing so, they would have twisted the truth!Kanis: Keh heh heh. I suspected it was a false charge.Edgeworth: ?Kanis: I heard about it from one of the guards. About Knightley... He kept desperately insisting, \"I didn't assassinate anyone!\"Edgeworth: ...But the courts are supposed to bring the truth to light.Kanis: I may not be well-versed in law, but I can say one thing for certain. Some of the prisoners here were convicted on false charges.Edgeworth: Ugh...!Kanis: ...That's the reality of it. Right, Anubis? Right, boy? Leaving the truth in the care of the court can be dangerous.Edgeworth: (Leaving the truth in the care of the court is dangerous... Huh. There was someone who said the exact same thing before... That investigator from Interpol who doesn't trust prosecutors.)Lang: You're not twisting the truth behind those closed courtroom doors, too, are you? Fueled by those ideas, is it any wonder that courts produce nothing but falsities and lies!? Rest assured, the next time we meet, I won't be so forgiving.Edgeworth: (I doubt his distrust has cleared up completely...)Kanis: Keh heh heh... You feel the same way, don't you, Anubis? The truth of the courts and Mr. Edgeworth's reasoning both can't be trusted. Right?Edgeworth: Ugh...!Kanis: It is nothing to be upset about. You're not the only one who suspects me. Yesterday, the other prosecutor and that judge came here too. They brought the warden along. How they despise me.Kay: Oh! It must have been those two rude people from before!Edgeworth: (Prosecutor Debeste and Judge Gav\u00e8lle...)Kanis: They thoroughly inspected my room, but left without finding a thing. Keh heh heh. It seems they were searching for the murder weapon. 'Tis a shame. They searched the other prisoners' cells too. Not just mine. Yet they were still unable to find anything. All that hard work was for naught. Keh heh heh.Prison Investigation note jotted down in my Organizer.Ray: He he he. This is quite a problem. What should we do?Edgeworth: (Sahwit's testimony alone won't hold up. In order to confront him, we'll need evidence...)Kanis: Now, if my guests would be so kind as to leave... Right, Anubis? Show them the way out.Ray: Ah, does this mean... What I think it means?Kay: L-L-L-Let's get going, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth: ......We shall meet again, Kanis.Kanis: It would be a shame for our long-awaited reunion to end so soon. I'll be waiting. Keh heh heh.Edgeworth: (Now then, we still need to find that murder weapon.)Kay: Mr. Edgewooorth!Edgeworth: (She went all the way up there?) It's fine now, Kay. Come down from there. Where is Mr. Shields?Kay: Beats me... He just took off running like death was after him.Edgeworth: (Good grief. That man...)Kay: What should we do now, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: We'll continue investigating. (First, we should... ...start by solving that one mystery. Knightley's body was found in a workroom inside the prison. However... ...he was supposed to be in the detention center's holding cell... How did he get to the prison under such tight security?) Let's go investigate the holding cell at the detention center.Kay: That was where Mr. Knightley was held, right!? But what about Uncle Ray?Edgeworth: ...Let's just leave him be for now.Kay: I thought we were supposed to be his assistants though...Edgeworth: The victim's cell in the detention center was this way.Kay: Let's check it out! Mr. Edgeworth!???: Oh, this is truly just dreadful!Edgeworth: (Hm? What happened? That's the warden, Ms. Laguarde. She must have come from behind that \"No entry\" sign.)Guard: So, he still won't talk? Even after all the trouble you went through to get the evidence transferred from the precinct...Laguarde: That's right. I don't know how many times I've tried. I can't report back empty handed...Guard: That assassin sure is one tough cookie, huh?Edgeworth: (Did he just say \"assassin\"...!?)Laguarde: Oh my.Edgeworth: Pardon me, but... Were you talking about Bodhidharma Kanis just now?Laguarde: Oh, eavesdropping, were you? You naughty boy!Edgeworth: ...Did you question him personally, Warden Laguarde?Laguarde: Not just him. I try to have a heart-to-heart with all the prisoners and suspects. In my home, we're all family here! It's only fair I invite them to my Warden's Office!Edgeworth: The Warden's Office?Laguarde: Oh, have you taken an interest in my room as well? It's just down this hallway. But outsiders are not allowed past this point.Edgeworth: (Down the hallway... So around there...)Laguarde: Hu hu hu. It's such a lovely room. People do enjoy being invited back here. I always show them the splendid view of my precious courtyard!Kay: The courtyard of this animal-filled prison! I'd sure love to see it!Floor Plans updated in my Organizer.Laguarde: I'm delighted that you want to see it... However, I cannot invite you.Kay: What?Laguarde: You're not a child of our home. If you want to come to my room, you'll have to be convicted first.Edgeworth: (That's a rather high hurdle to clear...)Laguarde: Goodness me! Look at how long we've been talking! I was just about to feed Ally her lunch!Edgeworth: Ally...?Laguarde: She is my favorite little angel! Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be off to the courtyard! Toodle-loo!Edgeworth: (I never got a chance to ask her about Kanis...) ...Well, let's head over to Knightley's cell.Edgeworth: (This is the victim's cell...)Kay: When did Mr. Knightley arrive in here again?Edgeworth: It was after the president's welcoming ceremony, on the night of March 25th. (So, when and how did he move over to the prison? There might be some evidence left that can answer that.)Kay: Alright! Let's get cracking, Mr. Edgeworth!(Connecting all possible Logic, examining sink, and deducing paper leads to:)Edgeworth: So, this is what our investigation turned up. It seems we've found a major connection between the victim and Kanis.???: Th-This is terrible!Edgeworth: (Hm? What happened?)Guard: Th-The security camera recorded something terrible!Edgeworth: What!? Can you let me see it?Guard: Of course, sir! I have a portable playback device right here!Edgeworth: Then let me see it right away! (This is...!)Kay: Th-This black thing has got to be that doggy, right!?Edgeworth: Up until this point, I thought the murder took place inside the prison. But it appears I was mistaken. The place where Knightley was attacked was...Edgeworth: It was the detention center. And furthermore, he was attacked by Kanis's dog. (This is the decisive evidence!)Security Footage data jotted down in my Organizer.Edgeworth: (If Knightley was killed in this room... ...then this piece of evidence we found in the cell takes on a new meaning! Which piece of evidence takes on a new meaning if the murder occurred in the holding cell?)Edgeworth: (For some reason, someone wiped the floor clean. It's possible they were wiping away bloodstains.) Thank you for your hard work. While I have your attention, may I ask for one more favor?Guard: What would that be?Edgeworth: There should be a detective by the name of Dick Gumshoe in the detention center or the prison. I would like you to give him a message. Tell him to check this room for traces of blood and give the results to me.Guard: Y-Yes, sir.Wiped Floor data updated in my Organizer.Kay: This should corner that old coot!Edgeworth: No... Not yet. We still don't know how Knightley and the dog moved from here to the prison.Kay: That's true. But once we figure that out...! Where should we check out next, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: The guards here might know something about the murder... Let's see if we can learn any new details from them.Kay: Alright! Let's continue our... Aah!???: Oh. Sorry to intrude... ...Well, if isn't Mr. Prosecutor and the little lady. Fancy meeting you here...Edgeworth: (This man is Shi-Long Lang, an Interpol Agent. About two weeks ago, he was in charge of investigating one of my cases. I would have thought he'd returned to his native country of Zheng Fa by now.) Agent Lang. What brings you here?Lang: Just some boring work. Nothing you need to know about.Kay: Ha ha! On top of a black dog, we meet a black wolf! Huh? You came alone today, Agent Lang?Lang: ........Edgeworth: (Usually, he'd have a huge police force with him.)Lang: Mr. Prosecutor, seems you've been busy these past few days.Edgeworth: (These past few days... Is he referring to the incident with the Zheng Fa president?) I would have thought you'd be involved in his security too.Lang: Hah. Our president doesn't even trust his own country's police force. Look at the results of hiring a private security company. It's laughable.Edgeworth: (Agent Lang doesn't trust prosecutors or the courts. That's why... ...he brings along a large force of capable policemen to thoroughly investigate the crime scene.) Yes. If you and your subordinates had been there, the results might have been different.Lang: ...My subordinates, huh... They're... no longer with me.Edgeworth: They're not with you?Lang: Funny, looks like I'm a real lone wolf now. Hahahaha!Edgeworth: Agent Lang. Just what happened exactly?Lang: Didn't I tell you? It's nothing you need to know about. Well, be seeing ya, Mr. Prosecutor.Kay: Mr. Lang... I wonder what happened...?Edgeworth: (Yes, it troubles me too, but there's nothing we can do about it for now...) Kay, let us continue with our own investigation.Kay: ...Got it. First, let's ask those guards a few questions!(Talking with two guards leads to:)???: Ooh! There you are!Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. Where did you go?Ray: Where indeed! I've been searching for you guys this whole time! Walking all around the prison is hard work, you know!Kay: ...That's strange, seeing as you came from the opposite direction.Ray: .......... I've got some new information. You wanna hear it? Do you!?Edgeworth: (He sure changed the subject quickly.)Ray: I heard a little something from the guards. It seems Knightley caused a bit of an incident two days ago.Edgeworth: An incident?Ray: You know how Simeon said he came to visit Knightley, right? After the visit, when Knightley returned to his cell... Naturally, a guard escorted Knightley back to his cell. While the guard was unlocking his handcuffs... All of a sudden, Knightley struck the guard and knocked him out. It seems he was going to attempt a jailbreak. By the time the other guards arrived, the key to his cell had disappeared.Edgeworth: But, there's been no reports of Knightley's jailbreak attempt two days ago...Ray: Exactly. It's strange, isn't it. Right up until his death, he was still in his cell. What's more, Knightley claimed he never stole the key in the first place. In fact, they searched his cell, and the key was nowhere to be found...Edgeworth: Did the guard who was struck have anything to say?Ray: No one knows. He was taken to the hospital while he was still unconscious. He's still there now, it seems.Edgeworth: (So, in the end, we still don't know what happened...)Knightley's Cell Key data jotted down in my Organizer.???: It's youuuuu!Edgeworth: (Hm. That voice...)Debeste: What are you still doing hanging around here!?Ray: Err, well, you see. This is my assistant...Debeste: Are you here to object our investigation and make me into a laughing stock!?Gav\u00e8lle: Sebastian. I believe \"obstruct\" is the word you're looking for.Edgeworth: (In a way, I think his expression was apt.)Ray: A pleasure meeting you again, Judge Gav\u00e8lle. I am...Gav\u00e8lle: I know. You are Simeon Saint' defense attorney, are you not?Ray: Well then, let's skip the formalities, and celebrate our happy reunion with a hug... O-Or maybe not!Gav\u00e8lle: Incidentally... I heard you mention an assistant a moment ago.Kay: Yeah! We're assistants at the Edgeworth Law Offices!Gav\u00e8lle: Prosecutors are civil servants, to open a side business is to betray the Goddess of Law.Edgeworth: As long as profit is not our objective, there shouldn't be a problem, right?Ray: Y-Yeah, that's it! Miles here is a volunteer worker! The purpose of my office isn't to make money... We're pro bono.Gav\u00e8lle: What a wonderful heart you have. Defending others without demanding payment.Ray: Ah... Aha ha ha... I-I do have an amazing charitable heart.Edgeworth: More importantly, I'd like you to explain your reasons for arresting Simeon Saint.Gav\u00e8lle: There's no need to...Debeste: Is that a challenge against me!?Edgeworth: No, I was speaking with Judge Gav\u00e8lle...Debeste: I guess it can't be helped. If you want to take on The Best, you will fall like the rest!Edgeworth: (I haven't said anything yet. ...But this is convenient.) Then I will hear you out. What were your reasons for arresting Mr. Saint?Gav\u00e8lle: I see no need to inform you. Sebastian, let us...Debeste: Heh heh heh... Just watch, Verity. Watch as I run around in circles against this useless prosecutor!Edgeworth: I think you mean, \"run circles around me\"...Debeste: Yeah! That's what I meant! Prepare yourself, Mr. Edgeworth!Debeste: So, you want to know my reasons for arresting that man? The answer is simple. Yes. We found \"traces\" of that guy over there. How's that? Perfectly simple, perfectly decisive... Right? Of course, I was the first to notice it because I'm the Best.Edgeworth: ...... (How am I supposed to go about pressing that...)Debeste: How's that? Got nothing to say! Speechless in my presence?Edgeworth: (*sigh*... This guy sure talks a lot.) ...So, you're the one who arrested Mr. Saint, I take it... Mr. Debeste. Do you have the right to do such a thing?Debeste: Well, obviously it was the police who carried out the arrest. But, since it was under my direction, shouldn't it also count as my arrest?Edgeworth: (As I expected... It'd be difficult to deal with both of them at the same time. However... Her silence is troubling me. Just what is she thinking?)Debeste: So, you want to know my reasons for arresting that man?Debeste: Obviously, we had a fatal reason for arresting Simeon!Debeste: The answer is simple. Yes. We found \"traces\" of that guy over there.Debeste: The victim carried a chessboard. From it, we found Simeon Saint' fingerprints.Debeste: How's that? Perfectly simple, perfectly decisive... Right?Debeste: The other prints belonged to the victim and the guards. Yes, only Simeon's prints are unnatural!Debeste: Of course, I was the first to notice it because I'm the Best.Debeste: My reasoning is faster than light. It'd take you a light year to get it. In short, I am the Best!Edgeworth: ........ (What is he saying...)Kay: It's really vague and hard to understand...Edgeworth: First, I'll have to teach him how to speak a language people can understand.Kay: Teach it to him, Professor Edgeworth!Edgeworth: Fingerprints found on the chessboard... Is that the ace up your sleeve?Debeste: Ace in my sleeve? ...Oh! Ace up my sleeve...!? Yes! The methods I use are always \"The Best\". This ace is my trump card!Edgeworth: Well then, allow me to show you that it is not, in fact, a trump card at all. Simeon Saint was the one who sent this chessboard to the victim in the first place... So, it's only natural some of his prints would be left on it.Debeste: .......... Aaaaagh!Edgeworth: (...That took way too long.) These fingerprints are hardly decisive evidence. Perhaps your arrest was a little too rash?Debeste: Rash......Edgeworth: To begin with, this incident occurred in the detention center and the prison. To suspect Simeon just because he isn't a prisoner or a guard is a little unreasonable...Debeste: Aaaaaah!Edgeworth: Wh-What? (What's with him all of a sudden...)Debeste: Wah hah hah hah. I finally get what you're trying to say. Rash... You mean we were too quick to arrest the guy, right?Edgeworth: (He was stuck on that!?)Debeste: Sure, I was the first to lay eyes on him. And I was the first to notice the evidence. That was even faster. But, I am not rash! Sure, Simeon Saint isn't a guard or a prisoner. But...Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle: ...Sebastian.Edgeworth: (Judge Gav\u00e8lle...!)Debeste: Wh-What are you doing Verity! Don't butt in like that.Gav\u00e8lle: Pardon me, Sebastian. Yes, your words on the suspect are very interesting. However... Shouldn't you get to the \"Best\" part first?Debeste: The \"Best\" part...!Gav\u00e8lle: Why don't you tell them? About your wonderful reasoning regarding the murder weapon.Debeste: .....Good one, Verity. Nice suggestion. Mr. Edgeworth, listen to my first-rate reasoning!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Will this reasoning explain why you arrested Mr. Saint?Debeste: I'm sure it will meet your expectations.Edgeworth: (Judge Gav\u00e8lle just changed the flow of the conversation... Just what is she planning?)Debeste: It's obvious the murder weapon was a sharp metal object! However, the prison maintains strict control over potentially lethal items. So... That's why I've reasoned that the murder weapon was brought in from the outside. Yes. It was hidden inside that chess board. And since only the victim and the suspect's fingerprints were found on the chessboard... Isn't it obvious who brought and used the murder weapon?Edgeworth: (At least it's clearer than his last testimony...)Debeste: It's Debeste reasoning you can get from Prosecutor The Best. How do you like that?Edgeworth: (Now he's mixing up \"the best\" with his own name...)Kay: But, could someone really hide a weapon inside a gift sent to a prisoner?Debeste: He he. You'll find a good place if you examine the inside of the chessboard.Edgeworth: (Inside the chessboard? Is there some place to hide a weapon...)Edgeworth: As I thought, there are only chess pieces inside.Debeste: He he he...Kay: Wow. What an annoying laugh...Edgeworth: (Inside the chessboard, huh. Perhaps I should examine it a bit further.)Edgeworth: This is...! (The top panel is removable.)Kay: It's quite deep.Edgeworth: Yes. There's more than enough room to hide a small knife.Debeste: Understand now? This is how the culprit smuggled in the...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Hmph......Debeste: Hmph! What's with the \"hmph\"! I wasn't even finished!Edgeworth: ...Mr. Debeste, there is something you have forgotten. There's a gate at the entrance of the detention center!Debeste: ...Eh? Well, there is, but...Gav\u00e8lle: He means the security gates with the metal detectors, Sebastian. We had to pass through the same check when we entered the prison, remember?Debeste: Ah... Aaaah! Yeah! That's it! I remember now!Edgeworth: (It looks like he completely forgot.) It would be impossible to smuggle a sharp metal object into the detention center. Therefore, your reasoning never held, even from the very beginning!Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle: That gate is only used on people. In other words, packages sent to the detention center undergo a simpler check.Edgeworth: ...So they don't use a metal detector for that?Gav\u00e8lle: This never should have happened... It seems the guards were too careless.Chessboard data updated in my Organizer.Security Gate data jotted down in my Organizer.Debeste: Right, Verity. Thanks for the assist.Gav\u00e8lle: You're welcome. Now then, Prosecutor Edgeworth, your cross-examination, if you please.Edgeworth: (Cross-examination. It's as if we were in the courtroom. ...Very well, his reasoning... Let's see how long it will hold up under pressure!)Debeste: It's obvious the murder weapon was a sharp metal object!Debeste: However, the prison maintains strict control over potentially lethal items.Debeste: So... That's why I've reasoned that the murder weapon was brought in from the outside.Debeste: Yes. It was hidden inside that chess board.Debeste: And since only the victim and the suspect's fingerprints were found on the chessboard...Debeste: Isn't it obvious who brought and used the murder weapon?Kay: That last testimony sure seemed like faulty reasoning.Edgeworth: Judge Gav\u00e8lle helped him out... No, the argument was entirely her own reasoning.Ray: In that case, this'll be tough. Got anything up your sleeve, Miles?Edgeworth: Of course. They don't know all the facts. This reasoning doesn't appear to have any weak points at first glance, but...Ray: But on closer inspection, there is a hole, right?Edgeworth: (I should press them to draw out more information, then find the hole in their logic. I'll strike first and take hold of any clues I find...!)Edgeworth: The murder weapon is hidden inside the prison? ...I don't think so. It's clear from this piece of evidence. (What shows that the murder weapon can't be inside the prison?)Edgeworth: Have you completely forgotten your own actions? You, along with Warden Laguarde, conducted a search of the prison. But, you did not find the murder weapon, right?Debeste: Th-That's..... We must have overlooked something!Kay: This guy just completely contradicted himself!Edgeworth: You carried out such a sloppy investigation? I'm amazed that you call yourself \"The Best\".Debeste: Are you mocking me...!?Gav\u00e8lle: ...Sebastian.Debeste: !Gav\u00e8lle: Please calm yourself. Don't get caught up in the opponent's pace.Debeste: .....I'm fine, Verity. Did you really think Debeste prosecutor would be shaken by someone Miles behind him?Edgeworth: (I wish he'd stop messing around with other people's names...)Kay: Oh, in that case, Kay Faraday is far, Farahead!Edgeworth: Kay, don't you get caught up in this too!Debeste: Yes. If my best investigation didn't find anything... ...then there must not have been a single weapon in the prison! In that case, there's only one possibility! The criminal must have taken the murder weapon with him when he left the prison! So it's only natural we didn't find it in there. Yeah.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: There was no way that the culprit could have brought the weapon out of the prison! And this piece of evidence shows why!Edgeworth: Have you completely forgotten your own testimony?Debeste: Y-You! That's twice you've insulted me!Edgeworth: Oh? It seems you remember what I said earlier. But you'd do well to remember further than that.Debeste: ...! What is that!?Kay: Th-This guy, he really doesn't remember anything?Edgeworth: It seems that way... The detention center and the prison are equipped with security gates. Anyone leaving must pass through these gates. Gates... equipped with metal detectors.Debeste: Aaaah! That's what you...!Kay: Looks like he remembers now.Edgeworth: Yes. There's no way someone could have brought the murder weapon through those gates. And so the criminal could not have taken it out of the prison either!Debeste: Aaaaaaaaaaah!Gav\u00e8lle: So then, Prosecutor Edgeworth... Do you know where this murder weapon went to?Edgeworth: Perhaps the weapon is still inside the prison?Debeste: But, we couldn't find it anywhere in the prison!Edgeworth: The reason you didn't find it... ...is because you believed it to be a sharp metal object.Kay: We saw the very moment when Mr. Knightley was attacked, after all!Gav\u00e8lle: If you can say that much, then perhaps you could enlighten us. What would you say is the murder weapon in this case?Edgeworth: From this piece of evidence, the murder weapon of this case becomes obvious.Edgeworth: Here is footage from a security camera. It shows one of the cells in the detention center... See it with your own eyes!Debeste: What! Th-This is! It can't be!Edgeworth: This tape clearly shows the moment the victim was attacked by a black dog. I believe this is sufficient proof, wouldn't you say?Gav\u00e8lle: ...Indeed, this is vital evidence.Edgeworth: Horace Knightley was killed in the detention center, by that dog! After that, the body was moved to the prison workroom. Our witness claims to have seen a dog in the workroom when the body was found. Of course, a dog couldn't have planned this crime on its own. However, there is someone who could have...Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle: ...That's enough. Prosecutor Edgeworth.Edgeworth: Judge Gav\u00e8lle...?Gav\u00e8lle: It's true this camera footage is vital evidence. However, there is something else you must prove. Actually, you've already noticed it, haven't you?Edgeworth: (...It's just as she says. There is still a huge flaw in my reasoning.)Gav\u00e8lle: If that black dog is a prisoner's pet... ...how was it able to move between the detention center and prison?Debeste: ......Ah!Kay: What will we do, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth: I still don't know how the dog managed to move from one place to the other...Debeste: I knew it...Kay: What! You're one to talk! You don't know either!Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle: If you do not solve this mystery, I'm afraid I cannot accept your logic. If this was a real courtroom, I would call for a recess now.Edgeworth: Wha-! Wait! I'm not finished yet!Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle: Court has been adjourned. Leave at once.Edgeworth: (This isn't a courtroom!)Gav\u00e8lle: Well then, as I said, court is adjourned...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I can't prove my argument, but isn't it the same case with Mr. Saint?Gav\u00e8lle: Whatever do you mean?Edgeworth: Just as I don't know how the dog entered the detention center... ...you also don't know how Simeon Saint entered the detention center and prison. Although he came to visit the victim, he was an outsider to the prison. Don't you think it would be difficult for him to commit a crime inside the prison?Gav\u00e8lle: ........Edgeworth: Judge Gav\u00e8lle. Now the burden of proof lies with you. Show us evidence that Simeon Saint entered the prison!Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle: ........Ha ha. You want me to present evidence? I'm happy to oblige.Edgeworth: What?! (Does she really have evidence?)Gav\u00e8lle: It's about time I told you. Now that I know the basis of your reasoning, Prosecutor Edgeworth.Edgeworth: (What is she thinking?)Gav\u00e8lle: It seems you don't even know Simeon Saint' real occupation... He is a circus performer.Edgeworth: A c-circus performer?Gav\u00e8lle: Yes. Have you ever heard of the Berry Big Circus?Edgeworth: Circus... Aaaaah!Laguarde: But of course! Yesterday was a day that I wouldn't have missed for the world!Edgeworth: \"Wouldn't have missed for the world\"? Did you have some kind of important meeting...?Laguarde: Oh heavens, no! I despise meetings! It was the Animal Show, of course!Gav\u00e8lle: It seems you've realized. On the day of the incident, an Animal Show was being performed at the prison. And the show was put on by the Berry Big Circus.Kay: S-So then! Do you mean, Simeon is...Gav\u00e8lle: Simeon Saint entered the prison as a staff member of the Animal Show. That, we know for a fact.Edgeworth: N-Nuguoooooh! (Th-This woman! She's been concealing this fact the whole time! She only planned to reveal it after hearing my reasoning! Come to think of it...)Debeste: Wh-What are you doing Verity! Don't butt in like that.Gav\u00e8lle: Pardon me, Sebastian. Yes, your words on the suspect are very interesting. However... Shouldn't you get to the \"Best\" part first?Edgeworth: (Mr. Debeste was going to say it then, but she stopped him!)Debeste: Wah hah hah hah! How do you like that, worthless prosecutor!Edgeworth: You didn't do anything!Gav\u00e8lle: Well then, now it really is time for a recess. I'll end with some advice. I had already doubted your abilities as a prosecutor... ...which is why I relieved you of your authority. You'd best not forget that...Edgeworth: ...What are you trying to say?Gav\u00e8lle: The P.I.C. can still take away your badge. If you value your badge, I'd advise you not to show your face before me again.Edgeworth: ...Is that a threat?Gav\u00e8lle: The Goddess of Law is merciful, but that doesn't mean you can get away with everything. And one more thing... I must digress. I suggest you stop with this defense attorney act.Edgeworth: ...That's none of your concern. I don't intend to abandon a case I am involved in so easily.Gav\u00e8lle: For defense attorneys, a relationship of mutual trust with their client is vital. It is very different from the way of the prosecutor... In any case... you didn't even know about your client's occupation.Edgeworth: Ngh!Gav\u00e8lle: Well then, I must be going. May the blessings of the Goddess of Law be upon you.Kay: Did Simeon... lie to us...?Ray: It seems he lied to Uncle Ray too. This complicates matters. Why'd he do that?Edgeworth: ......Ray: Hey, hey, Miles. Don't tell me you've got cold feet already? Gav\u00e8lle-pie is quite a handful, but giving up is still uncool. A defense attorney's creed is to never give up. Remember, you're my assistant.Edgeworth: ...Of course, I don't plan on giving up either. It's just... My theory that he couldn't enter the prison no longer holds. It looks like we'll have to investigate once more.To be continued.",

Um... What didn't I mention?Kay:That you're a member of the Berry Big Circus.Simeon:No! It's just that, you know! I'm not! I can't call myself a member yet. I'm just a new recruit!Edgeworth:Regardless, that still makes you a member!Simeon:Eek!Kay:So why didn't you tell us that before?Simeon:If I had told you I was part of the circus, it would've made me look suspicious, right?! Since I also knew Knightley and all that. I didn't think anyone would believe what I had to say... Not even you guys, Kay.Edgeworth:Didn't we promise to believe in you?Simeon:But M-Mr. Edgeworth! You're just... kinda scary...Ray:Man, you're just terrible at getting info from people. Aren't cha, Miles?Edgeworth:(...Hmph. That's none of your concern. Looks like we need to have a talk with him again...)Kay:So, um, what did you do in the circus, Simeon?Simeon:I guess you could say I'm a wild animal tamer. I'm still just an apprentice though...Kay:Wow, that's incredible! So you command lions and tigers to do your bidding, right?Simeon:Nuh-uh! Nothing crazy like that! Nowaynowaynowaynoway! My partner is this little guy right here.Edgeworth:(...And that makes you a wild animal tamer?)Ray:He's more like an organ grinder than a wild animal tamer... He he he.Simeon:Hey, Money! Cut that out! He can be quite a handful sometimes.Edgeworth:(I thought organ grinders controlled their monkeys, not the other way around...)Berry Big CircusEdgeworth:Yesterday, you told us you were just a regular employee, correct?Simeon:E-Even if I'm a member of the circus, I'm still legally an employee... We're just like any regular company. The ringleader is the boss and I'm just a grunt. I even have a supervisor... She's the head of the Wild Animal Tamer Division. No matter what kind of fierce creature, they all immediately follow her every command.Ray:He he he. She might even be able to get a handle on Miles here.Edgeworth:(I am not a wild animal.) Did you and your supervisor take part in the Animal Show here at the prison?Simeon:Yeah, it was just us two. It was only a small operation this time around. Basically, my supervisor takes center stage and I take care of all the dirty work. Well, I did have a tiny part in the performance...Edgeworth:(So there are only two members of the circus that are related to this case.)Your movements (appears after Berry Big Circus)Edgeworth:So, can you tell me about your movements around the prison?Simeon:OK. I went to meet Knightley two days ago around noon.Edgeworth:And that's when you gave him the chessboard?Simeon:That's right. And then that night, I started setting up the stage in the courtyard. It was pretty tough going back and forth moving all the crates by myself... I left everything in... Workroom A, I think. Just temporary storage.Edgeworth:(Workroom A... That's where the body was discovered.)Kay:Didn't your supervisor help you at all?Simeon:No way! I can't let her do anything like that! That's my job. After I got everything ready, we started rehearsing. When we left, it was almost midnight. The show was set to start at 8 AM the next day and go on until 10 AM.Edgeworth:(The only one who went in and out of where the body was found is Mr. Saint... And then the body was found just before the show ended.)Reasons for arrest (appears after Your movements)Leads to:\"Do you happen to know why you were arrested?\"PresentHound PieceSimeon:Wh-What is that? Is that a Cerberus carving?Edgeworth:Not quite, but you're not far off.Simeon:I-It's impossible! Even if I'm an animal tamer... ...I only just started recently, there's no way I could tame such a beast... Absolutely nowaynowaynoway!Edgeworth:(How does he see this tiny chess piece in such a fashion...)Knightley's MemoSimeon:Knightley told me it was real tough on him not being able to play chess... ...so when he found someone to play with, he seemed really happy.Edgeworth:So this memo contains a record of moves for a correspondence chess game. (As someone who is also fond of the game, he had an admirable enthusiasm.)Edgeworth:Do you happen to know why you were arrested?Ray:It's weird how it happened so fast. I don't think that DaPest guy would just have you arrested on a whim.Edgeworth:(I wouldn't put it past him though...)Simeon:Well, maybe it's because... of that. When I was moving the crates, I decided to go check up on him. You know, Knightley...Edgeworth:Y-You went directly into the detention block? Did you have permission?Simeon:No... I had to sneak in. It wasn't a formal visit or anything...Edgeworth:Didn't you already see him two days ago? Why would you go and do such a thing...?Simeon:Well, we're the only friends either of us has had since childhood... He was... the same as me. We never had real families. I just wanted to talk with him for a bit, so I went to see him.Edgeworth:...Hm? You didn't have a family?Simeon:Um... When I was younger, I lost the only family I had, my father...Edgeworth:(So is that it? I know all too well how it feels to lose your father at a young age...)Kay:So you're the same as Mr. Edgeworth and me...Edgeworth:...So it was just the two of you talking at that time?Simeon:Yes. All the other cells were empty and there weren't any guards nearby either.Ray:He he he, but then you got found out, and that's why they suspected you.Simeon:What!? What!? Did I do something really bad?Edgeworth:(Something must have happened while Mr. Saint and Knightley were alone... That's probably Debeste's logic.) It seems that we'll need to talk with your supervisor as well.Simeon:She should be here today, too. Probably in the courtyard. Ooh... I'm sorry it turned out like this, Boss...Kay:Simeon! If there's anything we can to do help, just tell us!Simeon:What? What? B-But, I can't do anything in return...Kay:Don't you worry about that. We're your allies! That's because... we're like birds of a feather! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:(Birds of a feather, huh? ...I suppose that's true.) We have sufficient information about your past. I doubt you had a motive to kill Knightley. Rather, you are probably the most affected by his death. And I doubt someone as timid as you could work up the courage to murder someone. Alright. I'll get you out of here. ...We'll believe in you.Ray:Well, what do we have here? Starting to get a hang of the whole defense attorney gig? You sounded a bit like your old man just now.Edgeworth:(...Hm. Me... Sound like my father?)Ray:He he he. He would say, \"The defense attorney's job is to be an ally to the deserted.\" If you're going to ride that stallion into the sunrise, wait for me, I want in too!Edgeworth:Mr. Shields... I think you mean \"sunset\".Ray:He he he. Yeah, of course. It was just a joke! Want some candy?Simeon:N-No, thank you. I don't like sweets.Ray:Oh, really? What a shame.Kay:What's wrong with the sunrise? The legendary Yatagarasu is all about the sun! Since the sunlight always exposes the truth!Edgeworth:(Good grief...) For now, let's just head to the prison courtyard and see what we can find there.Prison - HallwayKay:Ah! The shutter is open!Edgeworth:Yes. It looks like that way leads to the courtyard.Kay:So what are we waitin' for? C'mon, let's get a move on!Edgeworth:(Hmph... She's certainly in high spirits.)March 28, 3:37 PMPrisonCourtyardEdgeworth:(So this is the courtyard...) Just before the body was discovered, the Animal Show was held here.Kay:It looks just like a carnival! Man, I bet it was lots of fun!Edgeworth:(The prisoners were gathered here when the body was found. So that means whoever saw the show has an alibi...)Floor Plans updated in my Organizer.Edgeworth:(We should start by checking the area for...)Kay:Eeeeeek!Edgeworth:Kay!Kay:C-C-Cut it out, you! Help me, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:Y-You there! Stop right this instant!Kay:Ow ow ow ow ow! Someone, anyone! Help!???:Down! Astique! Down!Kay:Wh-Who are...????:Looks like you found a new playmate. Good for you, Astique!Kay:It wasn't playing around! It was about to eat me!???:Huh? No way, that's impossible. This child doesn't bite. ...Often.Edgeworth:(Often, huh?)???:People normally never get to play with an elephant up close. Isn't it wonderful?Kay:No, it's not!???:It's wonderful... right?Ray:It was simply marvelous, little lady.Edgeworth:(M-Mr. Shields...)???:Really?! Oh, that makes me so happy!Ray:So how about a hug... as thanks? Hey! Watch where you swing that thing! Weren't you taught not to hit people with your trunk????:Ha ha ha! It looks like Astique is friends with everyone!Edgeworth:I am... an assistant of this defense attorney. My name is Miles Edgeworth.Regina:Ah! I haven't introduced myself yet! I'm Regina Berry! Nice to meet ya!Kay:I'm the Great Thief and defense attorney's assistant's assistant, Kay Faraday!Edgeworth:(That's a rather complicated job title...)Kay:And the one playing with Mr. Elephant is the defense attorney, Mr. Ray Shields.Regina:It's not \"Mr. Elephant\". It's Astique, the fantastic Asian elephant!Kay:You're incredible, Regina! You made Astique stop right already!Regina:Well, I'm a wild animal tamer, after all.Kay:Really!? Then, you must be Simeon's supervisor...Regina:Yep! I'm the head of the Berry Big Circus Wild Animal Tamer Division. The one and only Regina Berry!Ray:It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm ace attorney, Ray Shields.Edgeworth:(...It looks like he's the one she has a handle on.)Kay:......Hmmm. Yes, she's perfect!Edgeworth:What are you mumbling about, Kay?Kay:Look at her! She's energetic, fun-loving and healthy! She could be the new member of the Yatagarasu... She'd be perfect as a Great Thief!Regina:...A Great Thief? That sounds like fun! We could make a huge ruckus with the animals!Kay:Ah! You can't make a ruckus! A Great Thief is supposed to be quiet and sneaky-like...Regina:But the show needs to have flash! Being quiet is... kinda boring.Kay:Aww. I guess she's not very thief-like after all...Edgeworth:(...It seems there has been a breakdown in negotiations.)Kay:Alright, let's get started, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's check out anything that looks suspicious! We'll even look through the barbed wire if we have to.Edgeworth:Yes, we need to gather more information about the case. We should also try talking with anyone connected to the case.PartnerKay:Yeah, what's up?The Animal ShowKay:Man! It's such a shame!Edgeworth:...What is?Kay:I should have joined the circus! I just know my amazing rope escapes would have received standing ovations!Edgeworth:...That's a shame indeed.Kay:All that's left for me now, is to solve this case... And take part in their next show! Come on! Let's hurry and finish collecting information!Edgeworth:R-Right.Frank Sahwit (appears after talking with Frank Sahwit)Kay:Being an animal groomer seems kinda fun. Ah, Mr. Edgeworth. Could I interest you in a mud pack facial?Edgeworth:Absolutely not.Kay:There's no need to hold back. See? We've got a rubber glove right here.Edgeworth:Stop playing around with the evidence! ...Hm? (The mud on this rubber glove...)Kay:Huh, is something wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Are you really mad at me?Edgeworth:No. Kay. You've done some fine work.Kay:Eh? Uh, Ah... I know, right? Eheheh!Edgeworth:(Looks like I'll need to have a talk with Mr. Sahwit...)PresentSecurity GateKay:Can metal detectors detect all types of metals?Edgeworth:A high-end model should be able to. However, there are certain metals that may be difficult to detect.Kay:Ho ho, such as?Edgeworth:Objects without a magnetic field seem to be harder to detect.Kay:I see, I see! As expected of Mr. Edgeworth! I've learned a lot!Edgeworth:(I probably shouldn't be teaching this kind of stuff to a Great Thief...)Barbed wire wallKay:\"DANGER! High Voltage\"! These signs really do exist! On the other side, you can see what appears to be the detention center's garden!Edgeworth:(It's just as Warden Laguarde said, you can see the garden from her office.)Kay:If it weren't for this barbed wire, we could take a look at the garden on the other side!Edgeworth:That is Warden Laguarde's prized garden, I doubt she'd let us in so easily.LakeKay:*rrribbit!*Edgeworth:...What are you doing?Kay:Don't you know? If you croak like a frog at a pond, they will come towards you.Edgeworth:...The only things that are coming towards you are the water striders.Kay:Water striders are so cool! They're like ninjas! They glide gracefully on top of the water...! I wish I could do that.Edgeworth:...What about the frogs?AstiqueEdgeworth:It's the Berry Big Circus's Asian elephant, Astique. Supposedly, very friendly with humans...Astique:.........Edgeworth:(Doesn't seem very friendly.)Kay:It's your stern gaze, Mr. Edgeworth. It must think you're the boss.Edgeworth:...Are you comparing me to an animal?Kay:That's not what I meant. Umm... I think it approves of you.Edgeworth:...That doesn't make me the least bit happy.Raymond ShieldsRay:Hm? What's the matter?The Animal ShowRay:This is nice. It feels like a dream.Edgeworth:A circus performance can be considered an art form.Ray:My pounding heart. It's beating with excitement.Edgeworth:It's not everyday you get to see what goes on inside a circus tent.Ray:Exactly. It sure makes me want to give it a big hug.Edgeworth:(Hug... The circus?)Ray:Having an Animal Show inside a place surrounded by barbed wire. It almost makes you forget that this is a prison facility.Edgeworth:(Barbed wire, huh... I'll need to inspect every last inch of this prison.)Ray:We didn't see the Animal Show, but the stage and the equipment are still here.Edgeworth:(I should examine the remnants of the show. It could be useful to our investigation.)Ray:...Miles. Please don't ignore your Uncle Ray like that.Regina BerryRay:Uncle Ray's feeling faint! I've never seen such dreamy eyes.Edgeworth:She... does seem to have an enchanting presence.Ray:Exactly. I feel like I must obey her! I wonder if she cracks a whip when she's taming her animals. With those sparkling eyes she'll say, \"Down boy!\"Edgeworth:If that's what you're after, I have someone in mind...Ray:Ehh! You know someone like that! You must introduce me, Miles!Edgeworth:(She's the whip carrying demon from the prosecutor's bench...)CartEdgeworth:It's a wicker crate... No, there are tires attached to it, so I guess it's a cart.Kay:*sniff* *sniff*... It kinda smells like animals.Edgeworth:They probably use this instead of a hand trolley at the circus.Kay:Just once, I'd like to ride one of these bad boys down a hill.Edgeworth:........Kay:Ah! Or maybe one of those office chairs with wheels, doesn't that sound like fun?Edgeworth:(What... is she talking about?)Red doorEdgeworth:That door is locked.Kay:Want me to pick the lock? Success is not guaranteed though!Edgeworth:No, if need be I'll just borrow a key.Kay:Sheesh. I thought it was finally a chance for me to steal the spotlight.Edgeworth:Don't even think about stealing anything in my presence... Not even the spotlight.Regina BerryRegina BerryEdgeworth:Head of the Wild Animal Tamer Division... Are you Mr. Saint' supervisor?Regina:That's right. Berry Big Circus was created by my Daddy. But Daddy died in a murder incident...Kay:Y-Your... Dad is...Regina:But. After that... our current Ringmaster made the circus even bigger. The Ringmaster is Daddy's close friend. He's like a funny uncle.Kay:Wow! A funny uncle... That's great, Regina!Regina:Yup. Uncle Moe established the Wild Animal Tamer, Magic, and Ventriloquist Divisions. Only the Wild Animal Tamer and Ventriloquist Divisions have subordinates though. Berry Big Circus is going to become even more fabulous!Kay:Yes, yes! That sounds amazing!Edgeworth:(The way these two are carrying on... I'd hate to put a damper on things.)The Animal Show (appears after Regina Berry)Edgeworth:Could you tell us about the Animal Show?Regina:It's an amazing show! It has a storyline and everything. What's more... It's a love story. Doesn't that sound wonderful?Ray:He he he. Very nice. Are you the heroine, Regina-pie?Regina:Nope, The heroine of this show is Astique! And her partner is Regent the tiger! It's about the forbidden love between an elephant and a tiger!Ray:E-Elephant and tiger? ...Forbidden love?Regina:That's right! It's what they call a love triangle! Isn't it romantic?Kay:It sounds amazing. Right, Mr. Edgeworth...Edgeworth:(Heroine... Astique is a female elephant?)Ray:Umm. Since it's a love triangle, shouldn't there be one more animal involved?Regina:Yup. The third animal. He's the one who interferes with the love between Astique and Regent.Kay:Mr. Edgeworth. What do you think it is?Edgeworth:Well. Since it's a circus... Perhaps a lion?Kay:I think a crow would be nice.Regina:He he he. The third animal is a naughty little monkey!Edgeworth:(The scale suddenly got smaller.)Kay:Ah! Money the monkey!Regina:Nope. The one who plays the role of the monkey is Simeon. Money is a little too small. He's like the villain who tries to break up the love between Astique and Regent! How will Astique and Regent control their own destiny!? ...Isn't it wonderful?Kay:I... I guess.Edgeworth:I thought Mr. Saint just did all the grunt work.Regina:Wouldn't you feel sorry for Simeon if he didn't get to perform on stage?The preparations (appears after The Animal Show)Edgeworth:Could you tell me about the preparations for the show?Regina:Simeon handled everything... So I don't know that much about it. Simeon insisted on it. He wanted me to focus on the show. I saw Simeon doing something near the well though...Edgeworth:(The well... If I recall, it was behind the stage... I'd better go take a look at it later...)Regina:He even moved this giant cage all by himself. Simeon is such a nice guy!Kay:Th-That... sounds like something Simeon would do.Edgeworth:(While crying profusely.)Regina:During the preparations, Simeon went back and forth between the workroom and the courtyard. We were using the workroom to store our equipment. Only Simeon entered that room, so I don't know anything about it...Edgeworth:(The workroom... Was it the one where we found the dead body? So, Simeon was the only one who entered workroom A?)Kay:Man. The bad news just keeps on coming.Regina:Mr. Lawyer, please promise me you'll help Simeon.Kay:Don't worry! Despite his looks, Mr. Edgeworth is really amazing!Edgeworth:(Despite my looks... And just what is wrong with the way I look?)PresentProsecutor's BadgeRegina:Umm... OK. I'll accept it.Edgeworth:? Hold it. Did I say anything about giving it to you?Regina:You're not giving it to me?Edgeworth:Of course not.Regina:.........................Edgeworth:...I'm sorry. It's my fault for presenting it to you.Regina:It's alright. I forgive you.Edgeworth:(Urk... Why am I apologizing to her!)Black DogRegina:Wow, what a cute doggy!Edgeworth:C-Cute... doggy?Regina:Yup! Ah, but this child... Won't play nice with others. From the look in his eyes, he only opens his heart to his master. I'm certain he's a good doggy though.Edgeworth:Oh...? You can tell that much just by looking at a picture?Regina:Of course! I'm the Head Animal Tamer, after all! Ah, Mr. Edgeworth also has the same eyes as that doggy!Edgeworth:Wha...! (My heart isn't closed off!)Anything elseRegina:Ah! Is this a present? Yay! I'm so happy.Edgeworth:No, that was not my intention...Regina:I'm sorry. Unless it's an animal, I can't tame it.Edgeworth:...That was also not my intention.StageEdgeworth:This is the stage where they put on the Animal Show.Kay:If I put on a Great Thief Show, I wonder if anyone would come?Edgeworth:I'm pretty sure the police would show up...WellEdgeworth:This crude-looking well seems handcrafted. Was it built by the inmates?Kay:There are a bunch of tools lying around the well... A long piece of rope... And a heavy-looking weight! It weighs... 33 pounds. It says so right there! There's even a couple of pulleys!Edgeworth:Kay. Please stop touching other people's things.Kay:Stingy pants! I'm just checking stuff out, it's not like I'm going to take them home with me...Edgeworth:(Still, these tools... What were they used for?)Frank SahwitSahwit:Ah, Mr. Attorney. How are we doing today?Kay:We're doing... hey! We just met a few moments ago!Sahwit:Please do forgive me. Ever since I've come here, I've been working on refining my speech.Edgeworth:(That's not the only thing that needs refining.)Sahwit:Right now, I'm helping out with the cleanup after the show. Ahh. But if there's anything you need, please let me know. You'll have my full cooperation.Helping out the showSahwit:I'm in the middle of volunteer work right now. As you can see, I am a model prisoner. I have been reborn inside this prison.Edgeworth:Reborn, as a thief.Sahwit:Th-That was... The devil made me do it.Kay:How can you blame the devil? You're a disgrace to thieves!Sahwit:I have nothing to say. I still have much to learn.Edgeworth:(...As a thief?)Sahwit:But, as you can see, I've exchanged my bracelet for a working one... I will continue to devote myself to being a model prisoner.Edgeworth:(Again with the \"model prisoner\". Give it a rest already...)Pet grooming (appears after Helping out the show)Sahwit:I'm training to pay my debt to society, once I become eligible for parole.Kay:So you were training instead of watching the Animal Show.Edgeworth:(So there were only two people who did not watch the show, Sahwit and Kanis.) Why didn't you say anything about Kanis earlier?Sahwit:Well... if you asked any inmate at this prison, they'd all think twice before telling you. That person is like the ruler of this place. Around here... we call him the Supplier.Edgeworth:...The Supplier?Sahwit:If you ask him nicely, he can provide you with anything you want.Kay:What! Is that allowed?Sahwit:Normally, it's not allowed. But with him, it's another story. He supposedly has a secret route to procure these goods...Edgeworth:(As the Supplier, Kanis would be in a position of power.)Sahwit:However, I've put all that behind me. All I care about now is applying mud packs to the animals.Edgeworth:Mud packs?Sahwit:I coat the animal's fur with my mineral-rich mud packs to give it a beautiful shine. To help with my training, I give them to all the animals in prison. Each and every one of them.Edgeworth:(Mud... huh. It could be related to that piece of evidence. I should present it to him...)PresentProsecutor's BadgeSahwit:My, my, what a lovely badge. I see that you have some class, unlike some two-bit attorney.Edgeworth:Are you referring to the attorney who put you in here?Sahwit:Yes, yes! That's right! That shyster, the next time I see him I'm going to bust his kneecaps! Oh! ...Figuratively speaking.Edgeworth:(I don't know who he's talking about... But he seems to be holding quite a grudge.)Rubber Glove (after talking about Pet grooming)Sahwit:! That's the rubber glove I dropped.Edgeworth:Where did the mud on this glove come from?Sahwit:Ahh. That's the mud from my mud packs. At the time I was practicing applying my mud packs.Edgeworth:Could you tell me when this took place on the day of the incident?Sahwit:Since the Animal Show had started... I'd say it was around 9 AM. The mud packs turned the animals' bodies pitch black! And my heart was pure white...! I was totally engrossed with covering the animals in mud!Edgeworth:(Prison life must be taxing on his stress levels...)Rubber Glove data updated in my Organizer.Sahwit:Thanks to the warden's policies, I can undergo job training here... I owe her a debt of gratitude.Door SensorSahwit:It's because of these sensors that the inmates cannot come and go as they please.Edgeworth:...Except for you.Sahwit:I-Is that right? B-But I didn't do anything wrong.Edgeworth:You have been acting rather suspiciously though.Sahwit:P-Please don't lose your hair over it.Edgeworth:Don't you mean, \"lose your head\"? (It's easy to see he's upset.)Sahwit's BraceletSahwit:Please have a look. As you can see, I've exchanged my bracelet. And it's all thanks to you.Edgeworth:Good for you.Sahwit:It's really all because of you... No, no, it's all thanks to you. I truly mean it, this bracelet, it was all your doing. I had to get this exchanged. All thanks to you!Edgeworth:(He still seems pretty angry. Not the least bit repentant.)Prison InvestigationSahwit:A place to hide the murder weapon?Edgeworth:Yes. Do you have any ideas?Sahwit:I don't think an inmate would be able to hide anything inside the prison.Edgeworth:................Sahwit:H-Hey! Why do you keep looking at my hair!Edgeworth:Ahh, no. Sorry. Never mind. (I've already seen first hand that he isn't hiding anything under that hairpiece.)Anything elseSahwit:That has nothing to do with me, so I know nothing about it.Edgeworth:Are you sure about that? I think you know more than you're letting on.Sahwit:Preposterous! From head to toe... There is not a single thing about me that is a lie. Because I am a model prisoner.Edgeworth:(The hair on his head is a lie... But it's probably better if I didn't say anything about it.)ChairsEdgeworth:These were used for audience seating during the show.Kay:Folding up all these chairs must have been a chore.Edgeworth:Is that so?Kay:Don't tell me, you've never tidied up folding chairs before?Edgeworth:I've delegated the task to others in the past...Kay:Mr. Edgeworth... You should try doing some manual labor once in awhile.Edgeworth:Hmm... I'll look into it.Examine evidenceMud on Rubber GloveEdgeworth:It's covered in mud, up to the wrist. It must have come from the animals' mud packs.(Examining barbed wire wall and clearing all \"Talk\" options leads to:)Laguarde:Oh my~! There you are, Regina-darling!Regina:Ah, Ms. Laguarde!Laguarde:I was looking all over for you! I wanted to have a little chat with you.Fifi LaguardeThe prisonEdgeworth:Could you tell me a little about this prison?Laguarde:Currently, this place is my pride and joy, which I like to call our Home... When I first came here, this prison was in a terrible state.Edgeworth:Terrible state... You mean the prisoners' attitudes?Laguarde:There are no bad children in my family! It was the environment that was terrible! That's why, after giving it a lot of thought, I enlisted the help of the animals.Kay:Being together with animals will soften up even the most hardened criminals.Laguarde:Right now, everyone has returned to their most honest self. Just take a look at Franky! He's a model prisoner.Edgeworth:(A model prisoner who was trying to steal from a dead body...)Frank Sahwit (appears after The prison)Laguarde:There are lots of model prisoners here... but Franky is number one! He's proactive with his job training and helps out with the chores...Kay:Don't the other model prisoners do job training and chores?Laguarde:Eh? Uh hu hu, don't be silly? They all do, of course. I-It's just that Franky here... He has his sights set on something different.Edgeworth:(Hm? Something feels strange...)Laguarde:In any case, he's a very good boy! Please get along with one another!Berry Big Circus (appears after Frank Sahwit)Laguarde:The enchanting music! The prancing animals! The Berry Big Circus is fabulous! Hu hu hu. If you come here you can see a show once a month.Kay:Really? Then maybe I should...Edgeworth:(Was she just thinking about committing a crime?) \"Once a month,\" you said. Is it always the Berry Big Circus?Laguarde:Of course! I'm Regina-darling's biggest fan! My darling Regina... She's just, so fabulous. She's such a cutie pie, I could just eat her up!Kay:She really likes her darling Regina.Laguarde:...That's why I'm worried. About poor little Simeon. If he is found guilty, Regina-darling will be heartbroken. Mr. Lawyer, please take care of little Simeon. If there's anything I can help with, please don't hesitate to ask.PresentProsecutor's BadgeLaguarde:So you're the one who brings me my new family members!Edgeworth:Family members...?Laguarde:Thanks to you our home has become much more lively! Please bring us 100 more, or even 1000 more people! I just love lively places!Edgeworth:I suppose you'll be bringing in the same number of animals too.Laguarde:But of course!Edgeworth:(It wouldn't be a stretch to say that this place would become the world's biggest zoo...)Crime Scene NotesLaguarde:...He never got the chance to become a part of our family... No matter how many times I called out for him, he would not respond. He was just a nice little boy who loved chess. ...It's such a shame.Edgeworth:................ (She's in her own little world.)Door Sensor, Sahwit's Bracelet, or Security GateLaguarde:This facility is filled with my love! Once you step inside, you won't be able to leave... You'll form iron bonds!Edgeworth:So, you're saying that the security here is flawless?Laguarde:Come now! Would you please stop using such crude words like security? Chains of love! It's the bonds that bind them!Edgeworth:(She thinks everything's alright because of her tight bonds...? ...What about Sahwit's broken bracelet?)Black DogLaguarde:...!Edgeworth:Hm. (Her expression changed...?) Could you tell me about this \"family member\".Laguarde:You're mistaken. Those outside of my circle of love are not called \"family members\".Edgeworth:...I see. (So, there are things that are outside of her control.)Prison InvestigationEdgeworth:You were in charge of the investigation inside the prison, correct?Laguarde:That's right! Everyone helped out and we split up the investigation!Edgeworth:Everyone? You don't mean the animals?Laguarde:Of course! They were all happy to help!Edgeworth:I heard that in the end, you didn't find anything...Laguarde:That's right. Everyone did their best though...Edgeworth:(Splitting up the investigation with the animals... That doesn't seem very reliable.)Anything elseEdgeworth:I'd like to hear your thoughts about this...Laguarde:Hu hu hu! Very well! Come here, you!Edgeworth:L-Let go of my hand! That's not what I wanted you to look at.Laguarde:Oh my, I'm sorry. How thoughtless of me! A proper greeting should begin with a hug and a kiss!Edgeworth:Th-This isn't a joke!(Examining well, clearing all \"Talk\" options of Laguarde and Sahwit, and presenting Rubber Glove to Sahwit leads to:)Laguarde:But, really! I would have loved to show everyone yesterday! You did a wonderful job on the stage, Regina-darling!Regina:*giggle* I'm so happy to hear that! I'm glad all the prisoners came to see it!Laguarde:Well, about that... Just between you and me, not everyone came to see the show.Edgeworth:(That would be Kanis and Sahwit, I imagine...)Laguarde:There were 3 people who didn't see your show yesterday. Unbelievable, really.Edgeworth:Excuse me, but did you say there were three prisoners who did not see the show?Laguarde:That's right. I took a count and there were three empty seats. And we even had the correct number of seats set out...Kay:Doesn't that seem weird to you, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:It does. We had thought that Kanis and Sahwit were the only two prisoners... ...who were not present in the courtyard during the show. ...But that doesn't add up. Where did the third person go...? Further investigation is needed.Laguarde:Ah, I was having so much fun talking to you, Regina-darling, that I completely forgot! It's time to feed my baby!Edgeworth:(...\"My baby\"?)Kay:Ah! It's an a-a-a-alligator!Laguarde:Oh, Ally! You look as cute as ever!Regina:Oh, how cute! So her name is Ally?Laguarde:Yup! She's Ally the alligator! She's my favorite out of all my family!Regina:How lovely. I wanna try petting it!Laguarde:If Regina-darling wants to pet it, go right ahead, I'll allow it!Ray:Th-They seem pretty excited...Kay:W-We need to go check the prison cells, don't we?Edgeworth:...That's right. Let's look for the third prisoner who didn't see the Animal Show.March 28, 4:02 PMPrisonHallway???:M-Mr. Edgeworth! I've finally found you, sir!Edgeworth:Detective Gumshoe. I take it the investigation is running smoothly?Gumshoe:The judge and that prosecutor haven't shown up yet! Oh, yeah! I also got your message, sir!Edgeworth:What was the result of the examination of the victim's cell?Gumshoe:We hit the jackpot, sir! Traces of blood were found on the cell floor! There wasn't a whole lot there though...Kay:This should prove that the murder occurred in the holding cell!Edgeworth:Indeed. The probability has increased. However, we still cannot say for certain.Gumshoe:I thought you'd say that, sir, so I asked the lab guys to look into it a little further. They're running an analysis on the blood so we'll know soon if it's the victim's or not!Kay:Way to go, Gummy! Good thinking!Edgeworth:Detective... You've outdone yourself. What caused this sudden foresight?Gumshoe:I'm actually a little hurt that you're so surprised by it, sir.Edgeworth:(I hope nothing bad comes of this...)Wiped Floor data updated in my Organizer.Ray:Once we get the results, we can prove that the scene was the holding cell. Which leaves...Kay:...finding out how that doggy managed to sneak his way in here!Gumshoe:Just leave that to me, pal! Since that other prosecutor isn't here, we can investigate as much as we want! That's why I brought my secret weapons with me!Kay:Secret weapons?Gumshoe:That's right, pal! They've gotten us out of a few jams before... Take a gander at Dick Gumshoe's Seven Secret Weapons!Ray:Looks like he'll come in handy. Want to take up his offer, Miles?Edgeworth:Detective, please allow us the use of your \"secret weapons\".Gumshoe:Sure thing, sir! First, I'll give you a rundown! Secret Weapon No. 1: The trusty metal detector! Perfect for finding all kinds of metallic objects!Edgeworth:(As its name implies.)Gumshoe:Next, Secret Weapon No. 2: Everyone's favorite pal, Missile! He can track any scent you want, especially the scent of food!Kay:He's much cuter than Mr. Kanis's dog!Gumshoe:And then, Secret Weapon No. 3: It's umm... this!Ray:...Isn't that a fishing pole? What are you trying to catch?Gumshoe:No! Actually, I just brought it by accident...Edgeworth:Never mind that. What's next, Detective?Gumshoe:...Umm, that's all of them, sir.Kay:What!? You called them the \"Seven Secret Weapons\", but there's only three of them!Gumshoe:That's all I have for now, pal! We can use the rest next time. I can't just reveal them all at once! Why do you think they're called \"secret weapons,\" pal?Edgeworth:...It doesn't matter. We'll just use the three that he's provided.Gumshoe:Alright! Which one do you want to use?The metal detectorEdgeworth:The metal detector, if you please.Gumshoe:The metal detector, sir? I'll sweep the area right away! Metal detector, activate!Edgeworth:What happened, Detective?Gumshoe:Sorry about that, sir... It seems the battery's dead.Kay:Aww man... Guess we can't use that then.Gumshoe:Looks like the metal detector won't be any help to us. Try another one, sir!Leads back to:\"Alright! Which one do you want to use?\"MissileLeads to:\"You want Missile, sir?\"The fishing poleEdgeworth:The fishing pole, if you please.Gumshoe:The fishing pole, sir?Edgeworth:There is a pond in the prison courtyard... Something important may have fallen in.Gumshoe:Roger that, sir! I'll fish it out right away!Gumshoe:Whoaaaaah, pal!Edgeworth:What's the matter, Detective Gumshoe?Gumshoe:It got away, sir... I thought I hooked something big, but the line snapped! There has to be a monster fish in there, sir!Edgeworth:(It's likely that alligator... I won't tell him that though.)Gumshoe:I guess the fishing pole won't be of any more use to us. Try another one, sir!Leads back to:\"Alright! Which one do you want to use?\"Gumshoe:You want Missile, sir? Hey, pal! Over here, Missile!Kay:Ah! There he is!Gumshoe:First, let's decide what scent he should track down!Edgeworth:We are searching for the route Kanis's dog used to get to the detention cell. This route would have also been the same path used to carry the body to the prison.Ray:So if we have him track the scent of the body...Kay:...that should lead us to the path!Workroom AGumshoe:Hm? Don't you smell something sweet?Edgeworth:Really? All I can smell is the scent of blood.Gumshoe:It's a very faint scent. Like cake or something.Edgeworth:(The scent of cake from the body?)Gumshoe:Alright, Missile. Get a good whiff of that scent, pal! C'mon, let's follow after him!Prison - HallwayEdgeworth:(That way is...)Ray:H-He's heading towards the special cell.Kay:And he's gone straight inside!Edgeworth:Yes. Let's follow him.March 28, 4:24 PMPrisonSpecial CellEdgeworth:(This is Kanis's cell, but it looks like he's absent at the moment. ...Maybe he's being interrogated?)Kay:What's in here?Gumshoe:Shhhhh! I think he's found something!Missile:Grrr! Woof! Woof! Woof!Edgeworth:(What could there be in this room?)Kay:Mr. Edgeworth, we better take a look!BiscuitsEdgeworth:A teacup and biscuits... I suppose he has his tea time in here, too.Kay:Playing chess while drinking tea in his cell... Isn't this going a bit overboard with the \"special treatment\"? It's like he gets whatever he wants!Edgeworth:Don't complain to me. ...You should tell him yourself.Kay:I-I think I'll pass on that!ChessboardEdgeworth:It's Kanis's chessboard. It still has that hound piece on it.Kay:Ah, the chessboard has legs! Aren't these things expensive?Edgeworth:They can be. (This is very good craftsmanship.)Kay:Mr. Kanis playing chess is kinda unexpected, y'know? I figured he'd be more of a Go player or something like that.Edgeworth:Go... Do you play Go, Kay?Kay:I'm really good at Gobang!Edgeworth:...But, that's not Go.Chisel with bellKay:Look at this, Mr. Edgeworth! There's a small chisel here!Edgeworth:I'm not well-versed in woodworking, but this seems to be a pocket-sized chisel.Kay:A pocket-sized chisel! It must be convenient to have one wherever you go!Edgeworth:Is that... from a thief's point of view?Kay:No, it's from a Great Thief's point of view!Edgeworth:(...She didn't even skip a beat.)ChiselsEdgeworth:It's the chisels Kanis uses. (More than enough for him to murder someone with.)Kay:Speaking of chisels... It kind of looks like someone used a chisel on your forehead, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:...And what is that supposed to mean?Kay:See? That furrow between your brow is getting deeper! It looks just like a carving!Edgeworth:...I would leave the subject alone if I were you.(Examining chisels and chessboard leads to:)Missile:Woof! Woof! Woof!Gumshoe:...Hm? Missile, maybe... This is what you're barking at?Missile:Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!Gumshoe:Whoa, hey! Knock it off, pal!Missile:Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!Gumshoe:Chocolate cake is bad for dogs! If that's how it's gonna be, I'll eat it all myself! ...Wow, that was pretty good!Ray:He he he, good for you! But it looks like someone else has a problem with that...Kay:That wasn't fair, Gummy! I wanted to eat it, too!Edgeworth:(...I doubt it's wise to eat food you find lying around a prison.)Gumshoe:Anyway, I guess Missile was barking at the cake, sir.Edgeworth:(That was pointless...)Ray:...Is that police dog going to get the job done?Gumshoe:H-He's fine, pal! He was just following his stomach instead of his nose. Let's track down the scent of the body for real this time, Missile!Prison - HallwayMissile:Woof! Woof! Woof!Gumshoe:Ooh! Looks like he's found something else, sir! Now it's this cell!Edgeworth:This would be Mr. Elbird's cell. I'd like to examine the interior. Detective, call a guard.Gumshoe:Roger that, sir!Edgeworth:Good work Detective. By the way... Is Jay Elbird still being held in the disciplinary room?Guard:No... He should've already returned. He was present during the noon roll call... He may have been assigned to work some place else.Edgeworth:I see. Well then... May we examine the cell?Guard:Yes, sir!HourglassKay:Mr. Edgeworth, how many minutes do you think this hourglass foes for?Edgeworth:Elbird is a former boxer... So I'd say three minutes. In a boxing match, each round lasts for three minutes.Kay:Bzzzzzt! Wrong! The correct answer is \"Around two minutes\"! Why? Well, because the glass is cracked and some sand has spilled out!Edgeworth:Wha...! (How could I have missed that!)PosterKay:Ah! There's a poster of Mr. Elbird on the wall! And what's this next to it... Is this his weight loss target?Edgeworth:Hmm... He was a former boxer. He probably continued with his weight management. It seems he also takes various protein supplements.Kay:\"Muscle Protein\", \"Hustle Protein\"... \"Weight Loss Protein\" ...Nothing but protein.Edgeworth:Which weight class was he aiming for?TireEdgeworth:\"Rocky\" is written here in messy handwriting. Could this be the bear's toy? This prisoner... seems very close to his unusual partner.Kay:Ah, this takes me back! Didn't you play with stuff like this when you were a kid?Edgeworth:No... I don't recall doing that.Kay:...... Well then, what did you play when you were younger?Edgeworth:Chess, golf... and the flute, things like that.Kay:......Mr. Edgeworth. Didn't you have ANY friends?Edgeworth:Wh-Why must you be so concerned about that!Punching bagLeads to:\"This sandbag shows signs of repeated use...\"HeaterEdgeworth:Giving the prisoners a heater is careless. They're much too lenient here...Kay:Did this guy use the heater every day?Edgeworth:It was probably for his weight management, since training was his hobby.Kay:Wouldn't his partner, Rocky, get too hot...?Edgeworth:I think their combination is hot enough.Edgeworth:This sandbag shows signs of repeated use...Missile:Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!Kay:Aha ha! You wanna box too, Missile?Missile:Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!Gumshoe:Ha ha ha. Look at him go...Edgeworth:It can't be... Detective, move this sandbag at once!Gumshoe:Y... Yes sir!Edgeworth:...A hole? This is...Missile:Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof!Gumshoe:Hey! Missile! Come back here!Kay:I'm going too!Edgeworth:Hold it!Gumshoe:I'll stop them, sir! Uuugh... It's too tight for me, siiiir!Edgeworth:D-Detective... ........ It can't be helped. I'll have to wait for her to contact me.Edgeworth:.......... Hello! Kay! Are you alright?Kay:Don't get so worked up! Right now I'm in the detention center!Edgeworth:The detention center?Kay:That hole comes out at Knightley's cell!Edgeworth:Really!? Stay where you are. I'm coming over there now!March 28, 5:04 PMDetention CenterHolding CellEdgeworth:Kay!Kay:Mr. Edgeworth! He he he. I really helped out, didn't I?Edgeworth:Indeed. (She doesn't appear to be injured.)Gumshoe:The floorboards have been ripped out from under the bed, sir!Edgeworth:I see... It seems we've found what we were looking for. The passageway between the detention center and prison is blocked by solid doors. However, there was a secret underground tunnel beneath it. We were following a sweet scent and arrived here. That means... ...the scent must have come from Knightley's body.Crime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer.Edgeworth:Come to think of it... His body was covered in dirt. It may have been caused by passing through the tunnel. Kay! What was the inside of tunnel like?Kay:It was pitch black, so I really couldn't see much but... ...I took some photos!Edgeworth:Please show us. (...Mmph. This is!)Ray:Spoons and forks... Were these used to dig the tunnel? But, more importantly... What are these footprints?Edgeworth:These footprints... Could they belong to a dog?Tunnel Footprints data jotted down in my Organizer.Edgeworth:This will surely be vital evidence. However, before we consider that, we have a big problem...Ray:A problem?Edgeworth:Jay Elbird could use this tunnel to move around freely. Detective! Confirm his whereabouts posthaste! Perhaps he's...!Gumshoe:Y-You may be right... sir! This is a big deal!Edgeworth:After speaking with the guards, the search for Jay Elbird was carried out immediately. They searched every nook and cranny of the detention center and the prison... But in the end, they found no sign of him...March 28, 5:34 PMDetention CenterHallwayLaguarde:Did you contact the police?Guard:Yes, ma'am! We've already done that! We've set up a security perimeter around the prison, ma'am!Laguarde:Right... This is the first scandal in our prison's history...Guard:We're so sorry!Edgeworth:(She's completely different from before.)Laguarde:Mr. Edgeworth, was it? Thank you for finding the escapee's tunnel. But, it's a little too late... Mr. Elbird has long since left here.Edgeworth:I don't believe he has gone beyond the detention center. There are security gates located at the exit of the detention center. I  believe it would have been difficult to get through those, wouldn't you agree?Laguarde:Maybe he has another tunnel.Edgeworth:We certainly can't deny that possibility, however...Laguarde:Anyway, there's no use in you being here now. Please return to your investigation.Edgeworth:Yes, we'll do that.Laguarde:You guys get back to your posts too!Guard:Yes, ma'am!Officer:Detective Gumshoe, sir! We've got the results of that blood test you requested!Gumshoe:Good work, pal!Edgeworth:(These are the forensic results on the bloodstain found in Knightley's cell.)Kay:So, what's it say? Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:The blood is confirmed to have been Knightley's.Wiped Floor data updated in my Organizer.Ray:He he he. Hey now, that's good news! We've found the bloodstain in Knightley's cell and discovered the tunnel the dog used... Furthermore, the security camera shows footage of a dog attacking Knightley in his cell.Edgeworth:We have all the evidence we need. It's time we asked Kanis a few questions.Laguarde:Kanis... did you say? Please, use utmost caution. That man even has henchmen outside of the prison.Edgeworth:(Outside of the prison... Is this related to his secret trade routes as the \"Supplier\"?)Laguarde:The police have been searching for Kanis's henchmen for ages. I've also been helping them, but...Edgeworth:(So that means, back then...)Guard:So, he still won't talk? Even after all the trouble you went through to get the evidence transferred from the precinct...Laguarde:That's right. I don't know how many times I've tried. I can't report back empty handed...Guard:That assassin sure is one tough cookie, huh?Edgeworth:You had evidence transferred from the precinct...?Laguarde:Yes. We borrowed all the evidence concerning Kanis. I've been interrogating him personally in my office. But... ...no matter how much evidence we have on him, we can't get a single word out of him.Edgeworth:(The warden interrogates him herself? Why go that far...)Laguarde:Lose your focus and he'll eat you alive. Be on your guard.Ray:Whoa. You've made Uncle Ray a little nervous.March 28, 5:55 PMPrisonSpecial CellEdgeworth:Judge Gav\u00e8lle. What are you doing here?Gav\u00e8lle:...Questioning a prisoner. Did you forget that we're investigating as well? Or rather, have you forgotten my warning? If you value your badge... You should not have appeared before me again.Edgeworth:I'm sorry if you thought that I would abide by those words. I won't overlook something important just to head your warning. I've come for a testimony. About the truth of this case, which you have overlooked...!Kanis:Keh heh heh. You mean to say you require my humble services.Edgeworth:As I promised, I've returned to prove that you are the culprit.Kanis:Hm-Hmmm. Interesting... Do tell.Debeste:Debeste:Before that... You should first listen to our reasoning!Gav\u00e8lle:We can say with confidence that Simeon Saint is the culprit. Only Simeon Saint could have moved Mr. Knightley into the prison. And we can show proof of this fact. But first... I'd like to hear your resolve, Prosecutor Edgeworth. If our reasoning is correct... Will you submit it to us? Your prosecutor's badge...Gumshoe:Eep...! Y-You'll deprive him of his badge? I-Is that a threat, pal!?Gav\u00e8lle:No, it's not a threat. Rather, an act of compassion. Normally, I wouldn't even have taken notice of you, since you have no right to investigate. However, if you are able to show proper resolve... ...I would be willing to let you be my opponent. Are you willing to risk it? Your prosecutor's badge...!Kay:M-Mr. Edgeworth...!Gumshoe:Mr. Edgeworth, sir...!Edgeworth:Very well. I trust my own reasoning. But moreover... ...at the moment, I am currently a defense attorney's assistant first and a prosecutor second. I will not sully the good name of the Edgeworth Law Offices.Ray:......Edgeworth:I intend to see my job through. I won't yield to your threats!Gav\u00e8lle:So be it. Is this bravery, or simply foolishness? On the Goddess of Law's behalf, I shall be the judge of that. Sebastian. Allow me to...Debeste:Yeah, I got it. I'm counting on you, Verity!-- Movement to the Prison --Gav\u00e8lle:I presume you know of the incident Mr. Knightley caused the day before yesterday?He attacked a guard and stole his keys...Afterwards, Simeon Saint stopped by his cell with an animal cage from the show.During this time, Mr. Knightley was able to use the stolen key to exit his cell.He then hid in the cage while it was moved to the prison workroom.Edgeworth:(So, Mr. Saint went to his cell after all.)Gav\u00e8lle:After hearing you talk about the security camera yesterday... ...we investigated it ourselves. Why don't you have a look? I have here a printout of the security camera footage.Edgeworth:This is the moment when Mr. Saint visited Knightley...Gav\u00e8lle:Exactly. As you can see, the cage creates a huge blind spot in the cell. By using this blind spot, Mr. Knightley could have entered the cage... That, is our reasoning.Edgeworth:(Hm, a blind spot. That means... ...the camera doesn't actually show him entering the cage. At this time, there's still the possibility that Knightley never left his cell.)Kay:But, why would he be hiding inside an animal cage?Gav\u00e8lle:Mr. Knightley was planning to escape from prison... That is the only possibility.Kay:A prison escape!? That's... so cool! First Mr. Elbird, and now Mr. Knightley... ...I won't let them show me up!Edgeworth:Kay, this isn't the time to get excited. Jay Elbird's escape is no laughing matter.Gav\u00e8lle:Simeon Saint was aiding Mr. Knightley in his escape. In other words... he was an accomplice.Kay:Not bad, Simeon.Edgeworth:(Don't praise him!)Gav\u00e8lle:That cage was transported temporarily to the workroom. Originally, Mr. Knightley was to remain hidden until the end of the Animal Show... He would then be carried out along with the cage. I presume that was the plan. However, midway through the plan, he was betrayed by Simeon Saint and murdered...Edgeworth:(Judge Gav\u00e8lle's reasoning does appear to make sense... However, there must be a hole somewhere. I must not overlook anything!)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Judge Gav\u00e8lle, about this incident... Gav\u00e8lle: You do not know of it? That would be unbecoming of you, \"Ace Attorney\" Miles Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hmph. Naturally, I know of it. However, you said... Gav\u00e8lle: Gav\u00e8lle: In that case, this is a waste of time. I shall continue. Mr. Knightley...Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you have proof Knightley stole the keys? Gav\u00e8lle: It is the only explanation as to why Mr. Knightley would have attacked the guard. We will know for certain the moment the guard regains consciousness. Edgeworth: (Is that really true...? Should I ask Judge Gav\u00e8lle for more information...?) Ask for more information Leads to: \"There is one point in your reasoning that is odd.\" Don't ask for more information Edgeworth: Could you please continue with your reasoning? Gav\u00e8lle: I understand... Mr. Knightley used the stolen key to leave his cell. Edgeworth: There is one point in your reasoning that is odd. If Knightley did indeed steal the key... I'd expect he'd try to escape immediately. Was it really necessary for him to wait for Mr. Saint to help him escape? Gav\u00e8lle: He simply chose the method with the highest probability of success. After stealing the key, he concealed it on his personage... ...as he waited for the opportune moment. That is what I believe. Edgeworth: (He concealed the key...?) Judge Gav\u00e8lle. Such an oversight is unlike you. Knightley could not have concealed the key. And I can prove it. (Knightley did not hide the key. And the proof is...) Present Knightley's Cell Key Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Haven't the guards informed you yet?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Judge Gav\u00e8lle, could you take a look at this piece of evidence? Gav\u00e8lle: I'm afraid I cannot accept that piece of evidence. I do not believe it has any relation to my testimony. Edgeworth: Nnghoooh! (As I expected, she's nothing like Mr. Debeste. However, I won't back down so easily!) Present anything else (Alternate) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Judge Gav\u00e8lle. Don't you have a problem with that statement just now? Gav\u00e8lle: Should I have a problem with it? Edgeworth: Hmph... Exactly. Because there's no problem at all! Gav\u00e8lle: In that case, you should have refrained from speaking in the first place. Edgeworth: Nnghhooh! (I don't think that left a good impression...) Leads to: \"There is one point in your reasoning that is odd.\" Edgeworth: Could you please continue with your reasoning? Gav\u00e8lle: I understand... Mr. Knightley used the stolen key to leave his cell.

(I don't think that left a good impression...)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, Mr. Saint' actions were intended to help Knightley escape from prison? Gav\u00e8lle: Yes. He stopped by the detention center's holding cells with the cage. This is Simeon Saint' own testimony. It can't be denied. Edgeworth: (His visit to Knightley's cell ended up drawing suspicion, as one would imagine.) Kay: Simeon was just... errr... J-Just clumsy! Gav\u00e8lle: His clumsiness led him to bring the cage to the detention center. Or, he brought the cage to help Mr. Knightley escape. Which explanation do you think is more natural? Edgeworth: Ugh...! Gav\u00e8lle: I see you understand. Simeon Saint carried the cage to the detention center.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you have proof Knightley stole the keys? Gav\u00e8lle: It is the only explanation as to why Mr. Knightley would have attacked the guard. We will know for certain the moment the guard regains consciousness.

(I don't think that left a good impression...)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Why would he have needed to do such a thing!? Gav\u00e8lle: In order to escape. How else would you explain his actions? Edgeworth: Hmm... That is... Gav\u00e8lle: The animal cages are made of metal. They would not have been subjected to a check. The Animal Show takes place once a month... So naturally, Simeon Saint would have known about it. Edgeworth: (Ngh... That wasn't enough to negate her point!) Gav\u00e8lle: As long as the cage was covered, it would have been simple to avoid the guard's eyes. ...But instead of helping Mr. Knightley escape, Simeon Saint betrayed and killed him. This is a truly unforgivable crime!Kay: She says Mr. Knightley stole the keys, but... He denied it, didn't he?Edgeworth: Unless Knightley had the keys, this logic doesn't hold up.

And the proof is...)Present Knightley's Cell KeyEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Haven't the guards informed you yet?\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:Judge Gav\u00e8lle, could you take a look at this piece of evidence?Gav\u00e8lle:I'm afraid I cannot accept that piece of evidence. I do not believe it has any relation to my testimony.Edgeworth:Nnghoooh! (As I expected, she's nothing like Mr. Debeste. However, I won't back down so easily!)Present anything else (Alternate)Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Judge Gav\u00e8lle. Don't you have a problem with that statement just now?Gav\u00e8lle:Should I have a problem with it?Edgeworth:Hmph... Exactly. Because there's no problem at all!Gav\u00e8lle:In that case, you should have refrained from speaking in the first place.Edgeworth:Nnghhooh! (I don't think that left a good impression...)Gav\u00e8lle:He then hid in the cage while it was moved to the prison workroom.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:Why would he have needed to do such a thing!?Gav\u00e8lle:In order to escape. How else would you explain his actions?Edgeworth:Hmm... That is...Gav\u00e8lle:The animal cages are made of metal. They would not have been subjected to a check. The Animal Show takes place once a month... So naturally, Simeon Saint would have known about it.Edgeworth:(Ngh... That wasn't enough to negate her point!)Gav\u00e8lle:As long as the cage was covered, it would have been simple to avoid the guard's eyes. ...But instead of helping Mr. Knightley escape, Simeon Saint betrayed and killed him. This is a truly unforgivable crime!Kay:She says Mr. Knightley stole the keys, but... He denied it, didn't he?Edgeworth:Unless Knightley had the keys, this logic doesn't hold up. This will be the breaking point. I'll try pressing the testimony further.Edgeworth:Haven't the guards informed you yet? They searched Knightley after he attacked the guard, and the key was nowhere to be found. Since the key's location is unknown, your logic doesn't hold.Gav\u00e8lle:That is not an issue. ...There is an explanation. Mr. Knightley had the key. It simply wasn't found. The reason being, he concealed it inside the chessboard.Edgeworth:The chessboard... You mean the one that concealed the murder weapon?Gav\u00e8lle:Come now. How do we know whether or not the murder weapon was really there?Kay:What! Take some responsibility for your own words!Gav\u00e8lle:That was all Sebastian's idea, after all.Edgeworth:(So, those two don't always agree on their reasoning...)Gav\u00e8lle:In other words, once we put all the pieces together... Mr. Knightley concealed the key he stole from the guard inside the chessboard. When Simeon Saint arrived, Mr. Knightley used the key to slip out of his cell. He entered the animal cage, and was transported to the workroom. All thanks to his accomplice, Simeon Saint. Mr. Knightley had planned to be carried outside after the show had ended. However, he was betrayed by his accomplice and murdered during the circus performance.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Mr. Saint performed in the show. He would've had no opportunity to murder him during the circus performance!Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:No opportunity... Is that so? A story plays itself out on the stage. And such was the case with the Animal Show.Edgeworth:(So, she examined the content of the show...)Gav\u00e8lle:The suspect plays the role of the villain who antagonizes the elephant heroine. In the final act, the villain is defeated by the heroine's love and all ends well. At that point, the suspect, in the role of the villain... ...is blown away by the heroine's burning love, and makes his exit.Edgeworth:(Blown away... by the elephant?)Kay:W-Was he hurt...?Gav\u00e8lle:After being blown away, the suspect disappeared from the stage. The suspect was absent from the stage for about 15 minutes.Edgeworth:Are you saying the crime was committed during that time?Gav\u00e8lle:Even in such a short period of time, it would still be possible to carry out the murder. Don't you think so?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:So, he committed the crime in 15 minutes and then returned to the stage... That may have been possible, if the crime scene had been the prison... Judge Gav\u00e8lle. The actual crime took place in the detention center.Gav\u00e8lle:I'm afraid I cannot accept that camera footage alone as evidence...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:As for evidence... I have it.Gav\u00e8lle:Well then, please show us your evidence. Where is the evidence that shows the scene of the crime was the detention center?Present Wiped FloorEdgeworth:Leads to:\"This is... the floor?\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Gav\u00e8lle:What... is this?Edgeworth:Hmph... This is the evidence that proves the scene of the crime was the detention center.Gav\u00e8lle:I do not understand.Kay:Me too!Ray:Uncle Ray too!Debeste:...A-And me!Edgeworth:Mmph! (It seems I was mistaken.)Ray:Aren't you going to show Gav\u00e8lle that the detention center was the crime scene?Kay:Why don't we show her what we discovered in Mr. Knightley's cell!?Edgeworth:Indeed. Judge Gav\u00e8lle. Will you allow me to present another piece of evidence?Gav\u00e8lle:Very well. Go ahead and present it.Leads back to:\"Where is the evidence that shows the scene of the crime was the detention center?\"Gav\u00e8lle:This is... the floor? Oh, Goddess of Law! I am unable to comprehend your mysterious ways.Edgeworth:This is what we discovered. The area here... was tested positive for Mr. Knightley's blood!Gav\u00e8lle:This blood test... Can it really be trusted? To begin with... how were you able to conduct a scientific investigation...?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Hmph. I happen to have a subordinate. I can't vouch for his competence, but he is a man that I trust.Gav\u00e8lle:That detective...? This concerns me. I cannot think why one would disturb the order of law. The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee's influence goes as far as the Police Department. Ha ha ha ha.Kay:G-Gummy's in trouble!Edgeworth:(Forgive me, Detective! I'm afraid something bad may come of this...!)Gav\u00e8lle:I will accept the fact that blood was found at the detention center as evidence... However...Debeste:Debeste:Wa ha ha ha ha! How ridiculous! This is unthinkable of you! You Third-Rate Prosecutor!Edgeworth:Mr. Debeste... You're here? (I'd completely forgotten about him.)Debeste:There's a giant contradiction in your statement! According to the security tape, a dog killed Knightley in his cell. Then, after he left the cell, the blood on the floor was wiped away...Kay:Aaah!Debeste:Did the dog wipe away the bloodstains? As if that could happen!Kanis:.....That is possible. Of my Anubis. Right, boy?Debeste:Wha-!Kanis:That was one of the tricks I taught him while I was still in the outside world. He makes sure to hide any bloodstains he makes. Keh heh heh heh. So as not to leave behind any evidence.Debeste:........Edgeworth:........ (I was saved. If only by chance.)Ray:Shouldn't you have taught your dog to \"shake\" or something?Kanis:Keh heh heh heh. Anubis also performs that trick very well. But the \"shake\" I taught him is a little different from others. First, he bites the victim's hand...Kay:Stop! Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear any more!Gav\u00e8lle:I see... I understand. Prosecutor Edgeworth. It appears... you've gathered a good hand.Edgeworth:I'm glad you understand...Debeste:Debeste:My argument isn't over yet!Gav\u00e8lle:Objection overruled.Ray:Hey now, that's a little harsh.Gav\u00e8lle:Sebastian. Would you allow me the privilege of explaining?Debeste:S-Sure, Verity.Edgeworth:Do you finally realize? The murder occurred in the detention center. Therefore that assassin's pet dog...Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:My opinion has not changed. Unless I can understand how the dog was able to enter and leave the crime scene... ...I'm afraid I cannot accept your logic, Prosecutor Edgeworth.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:I've been waiting for you to say that. Now, let me show you. This evidence shows the route the dog used to go between the detention center and prison!Present Tunnel FootprintsEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Th-This photo...\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Gav\u00e8lle:...And what, pray tell, is that?Edgeworth:This is the piece of evidence that shows the route the dog took!Gav\u00e8lle:Surely, you don't think I can accept such faulty evidence...Edgeworth:Mmph... (Of course, I was mistaken...)Kay:Let's show her the place where we found that secret route!Edgeworth:Indeed. Judge Gav\u00e8lle. Will you allow me to present evidence once more?Gav\u00e8lle:Certainly. Well then, go ahead and present your evidence.Leads back to:\"This evidence shows the route the dog used to go between the detention center and prison!\"Gav\u00e8lle:Th-This photo...Edgeworth:It shows a secret tunnel hidden in the prison.Debeste:Th-Th-Th-Th-That's impossible! A s-secret tunneeeeeeeeeeel?Edgeworth:This tunnel was dug by the escaped prisoner, Jay Elbird. It begins in his prison cell, and it's connected to a holding cell in the detention center. Namely... the victim's cell!Gav\u00e8lle:I'm shocked. How did this...!Kanis:........Edgeworth:Kanis. You must have known of this. Since you used this tunnel to commit murder!Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:In the name of the Goddess of Law... I hereby reject Prosecutor Edgeworth's claim!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Wh-What do you mean!?Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:Evidence is everything. That remains true here, just as in the courtroom. Isn't that right? I have evidence here... Horace Knightley's autopsy report.Edgeworth:Autopsy report!?Debeste:Since when!?Edgeworth:(Why are YOU surprised!?)Gav\u00e8lle:This was delivered straight from the police a short while ago. It's not complete yet. More of a preliminary report. Here... The very word of the Goddess of Law is written. \"Cause of Death: Stab wound to the neck, died instantly. Murder Weapon: Sharp metal object.\" The victim was stabbed multiple times in the same spot with a sharp object. Although they were unable to determine the actual shape of the murder weapon... ...they have clear proof that it was a sharp metal object. So, do you still stand by your claim? That a dog used a sharp object to kill the victim!?Edgeworth:This can't beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!Gav\u00e8lle:...That is all. The court is adjourned!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:But, wait! The tunnel contains the dog's footprints!Kanis:Perhaps it may have been one of Anubis' walking courses? I can never tell what Anubis gets up to outside my cell.Edgeworth:(Something feels unnatural about all this, but... I have no evidence!)Ray:Gav\u00e8lle-pie. You sure pulled out a hidden gem at the very last moment.Edgeworth:(She waited for the perfect time to reveal the autopsy report. Have I let her outwit me again...!?)Gav\u00e8lle:Appointed Attorney Shields. Here is the autopsy report from earlier. I apologize for the delay.Ray:...No, it's alright. Thank you. He he he.Autopsy Report jotted down in my Organizer.Ray:I gladly accept it.Gav\u00e8lle:Mr. Shields... I don't believe it's necessary to hold hands while exchanging documents... I'd advise you to stop.Ray:Huh?Gav\u00e8lle:Persist any longer... and I shall call on the strength of the Goddess of Law.Ray:...I-I'll be careful.Debeste:J-Verity! Well done. Just as... I planned...Gav\u00e8lle:...I only acted in accordance to your instructions.Edgeworth:(The autopsy report came straight from the police. I can't refute it. However, if the murder weapon wasn't the dog, Kanis will be cleared of suspicion.)Gav\u00e8lle:The merciful Goddess of Law so decrees: If you choose to yield now, your badge will not be taken.Gumshoe:Wh-What will you do, sir? She says that, but...Edgeworth:...My answer remains the same! Judge Gav\u00e8lle. It is as I said before. I will see my job through. I will not yield to threats.Gav\u00e8lle:So even now... You still refuse to give up? If you want to keep your badge, this may be your last chance.Edgeworth:Right now... I am a defense attorney's assistant. What I protect is not my badge... ......but my client.Gav\u00e8lle:...The Goddess of Law grows weary of your sentiment.Ray:He he... Now we're talking. Miles is starting to understand. That a defense attorney never gives up. Actually, those were the words of your old man.Edgeworth:(...My father?)Ray:It really is in your blood. You're the spitting image of him right now. You said it yourself, you've changed since you were tainted by Von Karma. It's only now... that I've actually come to believe it.Edgeworth:...Mr. Shields.Ray:Well then, Miles. Now's the time to put those skills to the test. Think beyond your limits. If the murder weapon was a sharp object, does that really negate your reasoning...?Edgeworth:(...The murder weapon was a sharp object...? ...That's it! There were five chisels placed inside this special cell. Kanis is a \"former assassin\", it's quite possible he could kill someone with just a chisel. In that case, the weapon that killed Horace Knightley was...!)Gav\u00e8lle:Is that all? Well then, I suppose you'll be giving up...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Evidence is everything... Didn't you say? The murder weapon was a sharp metal object. However... Such a weapon has yet to be found.Debeste:Wh-Wh-What! So what are you trying to say!Edgeworth:Hmph. The only decisive evidence... is the actual murder weapon itself. And that was in plain sight this whole time. The real murder weapon is... ...Kanis's chisel!Debeste:What did you saaaaaaay!?Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:Take responsibility for your own statements. The scene of the crime was Mr. Knightley's cell, you said so yourself.Edgeworth:If the evidence changes, then so will my logic. That too is courtroom procedure, is it not? If the chisel was used, that means the killer was human. However, the fact remains that we cannot deny this security photo.Debeste:Y-Yeah! What about that photo!Edgeworth:I'll give you the answer. This photo shows the moment...The dog killed the victimEdgeworth:...the dog killed the victim!Gav\u00e8lle:Prosecutor Edgeworth, you should take responsibility for you own statements.Edgeworth:Indeed. I do intend to take full responsibility.Gav\u00e8lle:The real murder weapon was Mr. Kanis's chisel. Didn't you say that just a moment ago? A dog could not possibly have used a chisel.Edgeworth:Urgh! (It seems I was mistaken... If this photo doesn't show the moment of the murder, there can only be one answer!)Debeste:So really, what's with that photo!Leads back to:\"I'll give you the answer. This photo shows the moment...\"The dog leapt at the victimLeads to:\"...Kanis's dog leapt at Knightley.\"Someone attacked the dogEdgeworth:...someone attacked the dog!Gav\u00e8lle:The person attacked the dog?Kay:It's obvious the person is the one being attacked!Edgeworth:Mmph! (As I thought, I was wrong... If this photo doesn't show the moment of the murder, there can only be one answer!)Debeste:So really, what's with that photo!Leads back to:\"I'll give you the answer. This photo shows the moment...\"Edgeworth:...Kanis's dog leapt at Knightley. However, the victim did not die at that time.Gav\u00e8lle:Didn't die...?Edgeworth:He was only knocked unconscious. The dog didn't move a dead body. It moved the unconscious Knightley! And the real killer was... its owner!Ray:I see! If the victim was moved, it would've been possible for Kanis to commit the murder...Kay:And use the murder weapon!Edgeworth:Indeed. The killer is... Bodhidharma Kanis! It can only be you!Kanis:......Keh heh heh.Debeste:Debeste:I bet your teacher used to write on your report card. \"Needs to pay more attention on what others say.\"Edgeworth:(I would think that describes you more.)Debeste:We examined that room. Every crook and granny. Right, Verity?Gav\u00e8lle:We examined all four of Mr. Kanis's chisels... ...and found no traces of blood.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Hmph. Thank you, Judge Gav\u00e8lle. Thanks to you, I am now certain.Gav\u00e8lle:Thanks to me...? Whatever do you mean?Edgeworth:When I came here earlier, I saw five chisels.Kay:That's right! There were definitely five there before!Ray:Err... So the one that disappeared was...Edgeworth:...the smallest one. ...Presumably for portable use. Kanis, Where is that chisel!?Kanis:I'm not free to leave this place. I've no need of a portable chisel.Edgeworth:(...Not free to leave? In that case, he mustn't have been free to hide the deadly chisel either.) Hmph... Kanis, you just dug your own grave.Gav\u00e8lle:It seems you know something. Would you care to show it?Edgeworth:(Kanis couldn't leave, so the place he hid the chisel is...!)Present Special CellEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Kanis is a prisoner... So he can't leave his cell freely.\"Present anywhere elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:It must be here in the prison.Ray:Because of the security gate, that's probably the case...Kay:You're supposed to point out where in the prison it's hidden!Edgeworth:Mmph... I know that. (What was I thinking...! Kanis didn't have time to take the chisel out of the cell. In that case, there's only one place he could have hidden it!)Leads back to:\"(Kanis couldn't leave, so the place he hid the chisel is...!)\"Edgeworth:Kanis is a prisoner... So he can't leave his cell freely. Perhaps he could have sent his dog out to dispose of it... ...but he would not have been able to confirm the weapon's location.Kanis:Keh heh heh heh. So, what does that leave?Edgeworth:Above all else... Special metal tools are allowed in this cell. Even if one chisel were to appear here, no one would suspect a thing. You'd be a fool not to take advantage of that!Ray:I see. Of course, it's always safest if you do something yourself.Debeste:Debeste:But, I examined everything! I didn't find any hiding places in his cell!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:I am certain that the murder weapon is here. The reason you haven't found it is because it was cleverly hidden.Kanis:Keh heh. You say I hid it? Where, exactly?Edgeworth:(Think... Where could he have hidden it? I have to remember everything up to this point! There must be some clue...)Ray:Ah, does this mean... What I think it means?Kay:L-L-L-Let's get going, Mr. Edgeworth!.........Edgeworth:(Come to think of it... That dog hasn't barked at me once today. Previously, when I came to the special cell, it barked on Kanis's command. Th-That's it! That's what's been out of place! There's just one place he could have hidden the murder weapon!)Kanis:Giving up already? Keh heh heh. How dull, how dull.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:I will... present evidence. This piece of evidence shows where you concealed the murder weapon!Present Black DogEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Hasn't your dog been awfully quiet today?\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Kanis:Keh heh heh. And what is that?Edgeworth:This is where you hid the murder weapon!Ray:Miles. Wouldn't you think that's impossible...Edgeworth:Urgh! ...I know. (The unnatural feeling I had when I came to this cell... That's where the chisel is.)Kanis:Keh heh heh. I never hid anything like a chisel. Ready to give up?Edgeworth:No, you did hide the chisel.Leads back to:\"This piece of evidence shows where you concealed the murder weapon!\"Edgeworth:Hasn't your dog been awfully quiet today?Kay:Now that you mention it, it hasn't barked at all. Before it was...Gav\u00e8lle:Bodhidharma Kanis! Open that dog's mouth, now!Kanis:Anubis doesn't bark needlessly. I ordered him to do that before.Edgeworth:In that case, order it to bark now!Gav\u00e8lle:Naturally, you should be able to. If you have nothing to hide...Kanis:............ It was inevitable. Anubis, show them your mouth.Edgeworth:As you can see, a dog of this size can easily conceal a small chisel in its...Debeste:WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAT! Why a chisel? The dog really had one in its mouth!Edgeworth:(I thought he was unusually quiet. Was he unable to follow the discussion?)Gav\u00e8lle:........Sebastian. Could you call the Forensics Department? Urgently, please.Debeste:Ugh! I got it!Forensics:A-A reaction! This chisel tests positive for blood!Debeste:WH-WHAAAAAAT!Edgeworth:I guess that proves my theory wasn't just nonsense.Kanis:........Ray:He he he. Would this chisel be the murder weapon then?Gav\u00e8lle:It reacted positively for blood. There is no doubt about that.Chisel data jotted down in my Organizer.Gav\u00e8lle:Mr. Bodhidharma Kanis. Now that the murder weapon has been found... I must ask you for your testimony.Examine evidenceBlade of ChiselEdgeworth:Kanis hid this chisel inside his dog's mouth.Kay:Could this be the murder weapon of this case?Edgeworth:I can't say for certain... However, traces of blood were found on the chisel. At the very least, it's not unrelated to the case...Bell of ChiselKay:This bell, it's the same as the one that's attached to Anubis' collar.Edgeworth:Yes. It's the Assassin Kanis's trademark.Kay:An assassin with a trademark... What an odd combination!Edgeworth:Don't you think it's similar to the Great Thief Yatagarasu?Kay:Mr. Edgeworth, you don't understand anything! A Great Thief has to stand out!Edgeworth:(Why would a thief want to stand out...)Kanis:........Edgeworth:We know how your dog got to the detention center, and we've found the murder weapon... Do you still think you can talk your way out of this?Kanis:Keh heh heh heh. Interesting.Kay:Th-This guy. Even at a time like this, he's still smiling...Kanis:Well, Anubis. It seems everyone has become suspicious of you. It's quite troubling, but since it has come to this, we have no choice but to tell the truth. I did not kill anyone. I've long since grown weary of killing.Edgeworth:(What's this? His face looks completely composed.)Gav\u00e8lle:It seems we'll need to listen to Mr. Kanis's explanation. Please promptly give your testimony.Kanis:Keh heh. Certainly.-- Kanis's Explanation --Kanis:First of all, I would like you to explain my motive.I do not know anyone by the name of Knightley. We share no connection.So, I wouldn't think some motive for murder would just appear out of nowhere.Or are you insinuating my Anubis had a motive?Keh heh heh. He only bares his fangs at others on my command.Kanis:I do not hunger for blood so much as to kill a man I do not even know.Kay:Uuugh... Coming from an assassin, it sure is persuasive.Edgeworth:Hmph. An assassin who only kills acquaintances? I doubt that would be profitable.Kanis:I may kill strangers in my line of work, but I never make it personal.Edgeworth:(Is there evidence that shows a connection between Knightley and Kanis... I should thoroughly review the evidence once more.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You cannot kill without a motive. ...Hardly what I'd expect an assassin to say. Kanis: Keh heh heh. I don't spill blood needlessly. It may be required for my job, but not in my personal affairs. They're a little different. Isn't that right, Anubis?Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You didn't know Knightley? It's not like you to say something like that. Kanis: You overestimate me considerably. Did you have such a hard time arresting me in the past? Edgeworth: ...We've already looked into it. You are the prison's Supplier. Naturally, you would have known about the other prisoners. Kanis: Keh heh heh. Hearing one thing and knowing ten is just an ideal. It's true, I do hear things. However, that doesn't mean that I know everything. I've never heard of anyone named Knightley.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You are an assassin. You do not require a motive to kill. Kanis: Hey, Anubis. What do you think of this man? Is he an idiot, a fool... or possibly even a genius? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You can drop the act. Answer the question. Kanis: But first, consider this. Who am I? Before your eyes, you see the man you arrested yourself... The assassin Bodhidharma Kanis. For those I have needlessly killed, I chant a prayer.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The dog probably did not have a motive. However, it has been trained to kill. Kanis: Anubis, how could this man say such a thing? You poor thing. There there. There there. Edgeworth: The dog isn't you. He could have mistaken his target! Kanis: In that case, wouldn't police dogs be equally untrustworthy? If you still mean to suspect Anubis... Then you'll have to show me this \"evidence\" you're so fond of. Edgeworth: Ngh...! (I don't have that kind of evidence!)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then, perhaps you ordered him to kill Knightley! Kanis: Keh heh. Aren't we impatient? Haven't you forgotten the first thing I said? I don't know anyone called Knightley. Although you still insist I do, I'm afraid there's no evidence. Don't you think so too, Anubis? Good boy. Good boy.Edgeworth: (Did the dog kill him, or did Kanis... If Kanis did not have the motive to kill, then he could not have murdered Knightley. First, I should show proof of some connection between Kanis and Knightley.)",

Answer the question.Kanis:But first, consider this. Who am I? Before your eyes, you see the man you arrested yourself... The assassin Bodhidharma Kanis. For those I have needlessly killed, I chant a prayer.Kanis:Or are you insinuating my Anubis had a motive?PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:The dog probably did not have a motive. However, it has been trained to kill.Kanis:Anubis, how could this man say such a thing? You poor thing. There there. There there.Edgeworth:The dog isn't you. He could have mistaken his target!Kanis:In that case, wouldn't police dogs be equally untrustworthy? If you still mean to suspect Anubis... Then you'll have to show me this \"evidence\" you're so fond of.Edgeworth:Ngh...! (I don't have that kind of evidence!)Kanis:Keh heh heh. He only bares his fangs at others on my command.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:Then, perhaps you ordered him to kill Knightley!Kanis:Keh heh. Aren't we impatient? Haven't you forgotten the first thing I said? I don't know anyone called Knightley. Although you still insist I do, I'm afraid there's no evidence. Don't you think so too, Anubis? Good boy. Good boy.Edgeworth:(Did the dog kill him, or did Kanis... If Kanis did not have the motive to kill, then he could not have murdered Knightley. First, I should show proof of some connection between Kanis and Knightley.)Edgeworth:You've lost your touch, Bodhidharma Kanis. If you had your dog clean up after you, you should have disposed of this too. This is a record of a correspondence chess game found in the victim's cell. This record, and the chessboard in your cell... Both clearly depict the same game.Kanis:Wh-What...!Edgeworth:I've heard that the number of possible chess positions is around 10\u00b9\u00b2\u2070.Kay:10 x 10, 120 times. 100, 1000... Umm... I-Is that even a real number!?Edgeworth:Indeed. There's absolutely no way these two could have coincided by chance.Kanis:........Edgeworth:Tell us your reason for killing Knightley! Unless you intend to explain this as a coincidence.Kanis:........Keh. Keh heh heh. Well. Don't they say that the truth is stranger than fiction? It is as you said. This is merely a coincidence.Kay:B-But there's no way that could have happened!Kanis:My correspondence chess opponent was the victim in this incident? What a horrible coincidence. Aren't you shocked too, Anubis?Knightley's Memo updated in my Organizer.Kanis:Looks like I'll have to tell them the truth. Anubis, my boy. The Animal Show, or something. That was when everyone left. Anubis brought the body to my cell... Keh heh heh. He had already been stabbed in the neck with the murder weapon. I did not wish to be suspected. So I had Anubis carry the body to the workroom. After that, he pulled out the murder weapon and returned to me.Edgeworth:So you're saying the one who pulled the weapon out was Anubis?Kanis:That's right. If I pulled out the murder weapon here, the blood would have been a problem.Kay:Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't this what that Sahwit guy said...Sahwit:A large black dog... ...was biting into the neck of the victim!Edgeworth:Wha-! What did you say!Sahwit:It was a truly hellish scene... That dog! That dog killed him!Edgeworth:I see... So that means Sahwit witnessed the moment the murder weapon was pulled out.Kanis:Oh, yes. That prisoner's testimony. It surprised me when I first heard it. It's not often that Anubis makes a blunder like that. Right, boy? Now, I believe that explains my actions. I did not kill him. All I did was remove the murder weapon. Now, will that be all? Anubis is getting tired.Ray:Ray:Whoa there. Just a moment. Mr. Kanis.Edgeworth:Mr. Shields...!Ray:Isn't there one thing you haven't explained? Why would you need to pull out the murder weapon in the first place?Edgeworth:(That's right... I understand why he'd move the body to draw suspicion away from him. But, he didn't need to retrieve the murder weapon!)Kanis:I thought him just a fool, but how quickly his scent has changed.Gav\u00e8lle:Care to elaborate, Mr. Kanis?Kanis:It was... because of this bell. The bell attached to the murder weapon, and the bell on my dog's neck... They share a distinctive shape, wouldn't you say?Edgeworth:The assassin Bodhidharma Kanis's trademark...Kay:An assassin's trademark?Edgeworth:The blind assassin... Bodhidharma Kanis. He always appears at the sound of a bell. The sound of a bell ringing in the dark of night is said to be the last thing his target hears.Kanis:Keh heh. You remember well. It has been a while since you last saw my bells, after all.Edgeworth:When I prosecuted you in court, I confiscated a knife with the bell attached to it.Kanis:Yes. My bells... There are only two in the world.Ray:Only two?Kanis:They're custom-made. Attached to my knife and Anubis' collar. Even though I can only rely on my ears... ...I can easily identify them. Alas, one has been confiscated and is not in my possession.Kanis's Bells jotted down in my Organizer.Kanis:When Anubis brought the body here, I heard a familiar sound. I thought my knife must have been embedded in the body. So imagine my confusion when I found out that it was merely a chisel with my bell attached.Edgeworth:Indeed, your knife is nothing like this chisel.Kanis:Either way, those bells are my trademark. Moreover, I'm the only one in this prison who uses chisels. With all this, I knew I would be falsely suspected. So, I removed the murder weapon and hid it.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:So, you're claiming that you only moved the body!?Kanis:Didn't I tell you? That chisel isn't mine. If you think I'm lying... Go ahead and check for my fingerprints.Gav\u00e8lle:Sebastian!Debeste:Eh? M-Me? But how do I check for...Gav\u00e8lle:Forensics!Debeste:Y-Yes, maaaaaaam!Debeste:A r-r-rr... Reaction! We have fingerprints! They're Knightley's, Verity!Edgeworth:What about Kanis's!?Debeste:Nope, just Knightley's... And there's no evidence of prints being wiped either.Gav\u00e8lle:.......Edgeworth:(Only Knightley's fingerprints? I-It can't be...)Debeste:Um... Should we re-examine it?Kanis:Keh heh heh. See now? I never even touched that chisel. Because I ordered Anubis to carry it in his mouth. In other words, the fingerprints belong to the chisel's original owner!Edgeworth:Ngh...!Ray:The murder weapon's owner... was the victim? Hrmmm. This is perplexing.Kanis:At any rate, I did not touch the murder weapon. In other words, the killer could not have been me... Isn't that right?Edgeworth:(Gah! I have nothing to refute that...! H-How could this...! Is he really... not the killer? Could Kanis's testimony actually be... true? This... can't be...!)Gav\u00e8lle:It seems this is sufficient enough not to warrant any further explanation... As it stands, you have not changed the state of this case... I believe this is more than enough reason for us to relieve you of your badge. To save any needless fuss, I'd suggest you hand over your badge now.Gumshoe:...Th-This is bad, sir! They sound serious!Edgeworth:(...It's regrettable, but... With those prints as decisive evidence, I'll have to rethink my logic from step one...)Kay:But... there are still many unexplained things. Why would Mr. Knightley be carrying a chisel?Kanis:It could be used for many things. Perhaps even prison escapes.Kay:Well then... How did he carry it into the prison? I mean, the prisoners aren't even allowed cutlery... Right, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:......Kay:Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:...Hm?Kay:Even if your reasoning is off at first, you shouldn't let that confuse you. The most important thing is to arrive at the truth! Isn't that right? It doesn't matter how you get there. The end result is to save Simeon! We have to do everything we can for his sake!Gumshoe:Well said, Kay!Edgeworth:.......Ray:Nice one, Kay. I really want to scout you for the law firm now. Remember when Uncle Ray said, \"A defense attorney never gives up\"? Miles, do you understand the true meaning behind those words?Edgeworth:(The true meaning... of those words?)Ray:Defense attorneys carry the fate of their client on their shoulders. You are the only person your client can rely on... Just like with Mr. Saint. We're the only ones who can save him now. We are linked by fate to our clients... That is why we must never give up. There's no way Uncle Ray can go against the teachings of Gregory. So... what will you do?Edgeworth:...... Currently, I am a defense attorney's assistant; no, an assistant at my father's firm... I have made a commitment to this case. Therefore... ...If I don't save my client, I cannot say I've achieved it. ...I will abide by this. To save Simeon Saint...! No matter how many times my logic fails, I will always find another possibility.Kay:OK! You're finally back! Well then, let's search for that other possibility! To start with... Do you think there was a way Mr. Knightley could've brought the chisel into the prison?Edgeworth:(The method Knightley used to bring the chisel into the prison was...!)Present ChessboardEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Normally, metal objects can't be brought into the detention center or the prison.\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:This was how Knightley brought the chisel inside!Gav\u00e8lle:And could you explain how this allowed him to do so?Edgeworth:Hmph... Don't you understand?Gav\u00e8lle:...I'm afraid I cannot.Edgeworth:Nnghoooh! (So it's not this...)Kay:Was there really a way for him to bring the chisel inside? Didn't someone mention something about that earlier?Edgeworth:Indeed. (Why do they suspect Mr. Saint... The answer lies there!)Gav\u00e8lle:It would appear you have no thoughts on the matter.Edgeworth:No, Judge Gav\u00e8lle. Please allow me to present evidence once more.Gav\u00e8lle:Very well. Please show us your evidence.Leads back to:\"(The method Knightley used to bring the chisel into the prison was...!)\"Edgeworth:Normally, metal objects can't be brought into the detention center or the prison.Kay:They'd just be caught by the security gate.Edgeworth:However, there is one way to avoid this. And that is, if they're sent in a package to the detention center.Gav\u00e8lle:That gate is only used on people. In other words, packages sent to the detention center undergo a simpler check.Edgeworth:...So they don't use a metal detector for that?Gav\u00e8lle:This never should have happened... It seems the guards were too careless.Edgeworth:Knowing this, Knightley asked Simeon to send him a package. Namely, a chessboard containing the chisel!Gav\u00e8lle:...Well, this has solved one of our problems. The fact that the chisel was not Mr. Kanis's, but Mr. Knightley's.Chessboard data updated in my Organizer.Edgeworth:Given this... One major issue remains. The security camera shows a dog attacking the victim... As long as that exists, I will maintain that Kanis is the killer.Ray:But, Kanis never touched the murder weapon. ...I'm stumped.Gav\u00e8lle:We also desire a conclusion to this matter.Gumshoe:Mr. Edgeworth! We can use one of my secret weapons, sir! Secret Weapon No. 4! The video analyzing machine: Mr. Analysis!Edgeworth:What's with that ridiculous name!?Gumshoe:I-I named it myself, sir... This'll let us analyze video footage in detail.Kanis:Go ahead. You'll soon see I'm not lying.Edgeworth:(I don't know what will come of this but... All we can do now is investigate!)Gumshoe:Mr. Edgeworth! Do you know how to use Mr. Analysis??Edgeworth:(A video analysis machine... Should I hear how to use it?)Hear his explanationEdgeworth:Detective Gumshoe. Could you show me how to use it?Gumshoe:Of course, sir! Fundamentally, it's the same as investigating a crime scene. You just Examine anything that piques your curiosity!Edgeworth:(To Examine I just press the X Button...)Gumshoe:Now, I'd like you to look at the buttons below the monitor! The left and right buttons will rewind and fast forward, respectively. And the center button lets you pause the video... Let's make good use of it to advance our investigation, sir!Edgeworth:(To rewind and fast forward, I use the Y and A Buttons. And to pause I use the B Button.)Gumshoe:While paused, you can go to the previous frame or the next frame! You just use the same left and right buttons as before, sir. Next, I'll explain how to zoom in! Just point the cursor at the area you want to zoom in on and... ...press the button on the upper left of Mr. Analysis! The one that says Zoom+!Edgeworth:(It seems I can also use L Button to zoom in.)Gumshoe:And after you've zoomed in, you can Examine it just like you would the original image! Use the previous frame and next frame buttons to Examine frame by frame! But, you can't actually playback the video in this mode, so keep that in mind.Edgeworth:And what should I do if I want to zoom out?Gumshoe:Just press the top left button on Mr. Analysis again, sir! Now, it should say Zoom-. And that concludes the explanation, sir! Well then, let's turn on Mr. Analysis.Leads to:\"Use Mr. Analysis to examine any suspicious part of the video, sir!\"Don't hear his explanationEdgeworth:Hmm. I see no particular need for an explanation.Gumshoe:Yes, sir! Alright, let's turn on Mr. Analysis and get started.Leads to:\"Use Mr. Analysis to examine any suspicious part of the video, sir!\"Gumshoe:Use Mr. Analysis to examine any suspicious part of the video, sir!Edgeworth:(This is the video from the detention center's camera... I believe this was the moment when Knightley was being attacked by the dog... If that wasn't the case, then what does it show? Is the person in this video really Knightley...? And what is the true form of the black silhouette attacking this person...? I should check the video and try to find the answers to these two questions.)Gumshoe:There could be unexpected things in unexpected places! So be sure to check every nook and cranny of the video, sir!Edgeworth:(What part of video is strange?)Black figure at around 6:42:21 (after zooming)Edgeworth:Th... This is...! I fear we have made a grave miscalculation! This animal... This silhouette... No matter how you look at it, it is not a dog. This animal is...A bearLeads to:\"From the silhouette, I'd say the animal is not a dog, but a bear.\"A catEdgeworth:This silhouette is definitely a cat.Kay:...A cat?Ray:No matter how hard I try, Uncle Ray can't see a cat.Gav\u00e8lle:Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please be more serious with your answers!Edgeworth:Urgh! (I-I was being serious... I should have another look at the animal seen in the video.)Leads back to:\"This animal is...\"A pigEdgeworth:This silhouette is clearly a pig.Debeste:...A pig!? Now that you say it, it has to be...Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:I certainly cannot see anything resembling a pig.Ray:Now, now. I'm sure that Miles here was just joking, right?Edgeworth:......! (I was being serious...)Debeste:What!? It was a joke!?Gav\u00e8lle:Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please be more serious with your answers!Edgeworth:Urgh! (That must have left a bad impression... I should have another look at the animal seen in the video.)Leads back to:\"This animal is...\"Edgeworth:From the silhouette, I'd say the animal is not a dog, but a bear.Kay:So then, in that photo I took...Edgeworth:Those footprints must have belonged to this bear, yes.Tunnel Footprints data updated in my Organizer.Gumshoe:Hm? Did you say a bear...Edgeworth:Yes. That man is the first to come to mind.Before examining mirrorEdgeworth:Now that we know this black shadow isn't a dog, but a bear... There's a good possibility that the man being attacked is not Knightley.Gumshoe:Whatever can show that this man isn't Knightley... ...should be somewhere in the video, wouldn't it, sir?Edgeworth:Since his face is not visible, it would be difficult to get direct confirmation. However... perhaps there is something indirectly reflected.Gumshoe:Something reflected...? Hey, isn't there a mirror in the cell, sir!?Edgeworth:Indeed... That could be worth examining.After examining mirrorLeads to:\"We were all under the impression that the person in this video was Knightley.\"Mirror at around 6:42:23 (after zooming)Edgeworth:A reflection of this person can be seen in this mirror. Hm? Is that a cap on his head...?Gumshoe:Actually, it looks kinda like the caps the prison guards wear, sir! You don't think... it was a guard who was attacked?Edgeworth:Have you received a report of any guard being attacked by an animal?Gumshoe:No, not that I've heard, sir...Edgeworth:Hm. Then it was someone else wearing a guard's uniform... I see. I have evidence that shows what this cap is. It is...Present Stolen UniformEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Normally, metal objects can't be brought into the detention center or the prison.\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:The cap in this video is clearly this!Kay:Eh? That doesn't look like it at all...Edgeworth:.......Ngh! ...I'll try thinking it over again. The person in this video is wearing a guard's uniform. But they're not a guard. In that case, why would they choose to appear this way...?Leads back to:\"I have evidence that shows what this cap is. It is...\"Edgeworth:There was no report of a guard being attacked by an animal. However, we did hear that a guard's uniform was stolen. Putting two and two together... I'd say this was... a disguise. For the purpose of a prison escape...Gumshoe:D-Disguised as a guard...! That sounds like it could have been successful, sir. Huh? Speaking of prison escapes...Edgeworth:Indeed. That person certainly was successful.Before examining black figureEdgeworth:If the person in this video is not Knightley... Then perhaps that black shadow is not a dog either.Gumshoe:If you zoom in, you should be able to see its real shape, sir!After examining black figureLeads to:\"We were all under the impression that the person in this video was Knightley.\"Anywhere elseEdgeworth:(Nothing here... I should have another look at the video. Maybe I'll find something if I make use of the zoom feature.)Edgeworth:We were all under the impression that the person in this video was Knightley.Kay:But, it's his cell after all. Why would it be anyone else...?Edgeworth:That line of logic no longer holds. Remember the tunnel under his bed!? It's possible whoever used this tunnel is the one in this video!Gav\u00e8lle:It seems it is time to answer that question. Just who is the person in this video...?Edgeworth:The person in this video is...Present Jay Elbird profileEdgeworth:Leads to:\"The person wearing the guard's uniform is...\"Present anyone elseEdgeworth:Kay:Whaah! The person in this video is really them!?Edgeworth:It's the only possibility...Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:No, it's not.Edgeworth:Argh! (I was mistaken...)Kay:You can see a bear in this video... Isn't there someone in the prison who keeps a bear?Edgeworth:Indeed. It's likely they are the one in this video. Judge Gav\u00e8lle. Will you give me permission to speak once more?Gav\u00e8lle:Very well. So, who is this person...?Leads back to:\"I have evidence that shows what this cap is. It is...\"Edgeworth:The person wearing the guard's uniform is... ...the escaped prisoner, Jay Elbird. The probability is extremely high. His pet is a polar bear cub.Kay:But, but! The bear here is black!Edgeworth:We have evidence that can explain this matter. The reason the polar bear became black is...Present Rubber GloveEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Think back to Frank Sahwit's testimony.\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Gav\u00e8lle:That is what turned the polar bear black?Ray:Uncle Ray can't understand why that would turn it black either.Gav\u00e8lle:Would you care to provide an explanation?Debeste:I-I can understand it even without his explanation!Edgeworth:Hmph...Gav\u00e8lle:Please refrain from making such meaningless statements.Edgeworth:M... Mmph. (It wasn't this...)Kay:Mr. Elbird's polar bear. I'm sure it was under the care of Mr. Sahwit!Edgeworth:Yes. The answer must lie in something that happened at that time! Judge Gav\u00e8lle, will you allow me to present evidence once more?Gav\u00e8lle:In the name of the Goddess of Law, I will allow it. Please present your evidence.Leads back to:\"The reason the polar bear became black is...\"Edgeworth:Think back to Frank Sahwit's testimony.Sahwit:! That's the rubber glove I dropped.Edgeworth:Where did the mud on this glove come from?Sahwit:Ahh. That's the mud from my mud packs. At the time I was practicing applying my mud packs.Edgeworth:Could you tell me when this took place on the day of the incident?Sahwit:Since the Animal Show had started... I'd say it was around 9 AM. The mud packs turned the animals' bodies pitch black! And my heart was pure white...! I was totally engrossed with covering the animals in mud!Edgeworth:During the Animal Show, Mr. Sahwit was applying mud packs to the animals.Kay:So, then, among those animals...Edgeworth:Was this polar bear... Yes.Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:Prosecutor Edgeworth. There is a huge contradiction in your argument. The security camera footage...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Judge Gav\u00e8lle. You are quite right. Sahwit used the mud packs during the Animal Show. Knowing this, a new contradiction in the video comes to light.Kay:A new contradiction?Edgeworth:Kay. Do you know when this footage was taken?Kay:It was after the mud packs were used, that would put it at around 9 AM.Edgeworth:In that case, you should notice something strange about this video.Kay:Huh!? What's strange about it?Edgeworth:The strange thing that contradicts the time this video was taken is...Present timestampEdgeworth:Leads to:\"The time Sahwit covered the polar bear in mud was around 9 AM...\"Present anywhere elseEdgeworth:Kay:That's the contradiction?Ray:So where, specifically, is the contradiction?Edgeworth:Specifically, around here...Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:I'm afraid I cannot accept such unclear terms.Edgeworth:Urgh! (So it wasn't here...)Kay:Mr. Edgeworth. Is there really something strange in this video!?Edgeworth:Yes. And I'll show it to you now. (The video was taken at around 9 AM... In that case, there is something obviously strange about this video.)Leads back to:\"The strange thing that contradicts the time this video was taken is...\"Edgeworth:The time Sahwit covered the polar bear in mud was around 9 AM... Which means this video should also have been taken at 9 AM. However, the timestamp reads 6 AM! On that day, the prisoners went to the courtyard to watch the Animal Show. At this time, only three people remained behind. Kanis in the special cell... Sahwit in the workroom, applying his mudpacks... And the one who put his escape plan in motion at that moment, Jay Elbird. Elbird left the polar bear in Sahwit's care and entered the secret tunnel. However, the bear escaped from Sahwit and followed after its owner. And just as he was chasing after the escaped bear, Sahwit happened to witness... ...the dog pulling the murder weapon out of the body. If Sahwit's testimony is correct, this video must have been taken at around 9 AM. However, the timestamp is off by three hours.Kay:Why would the timestamp be off like that?Edgeworth:Detective Gumshoe. I'd like you to examine the security camera.Gumshoe:Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! I asked all the guards and... ...it seems the camera's power was cut off for a moment, throwing off the timestamp.Edgeworth:What?Gumshoe:The camera is an old model, so if it loses power, the clock stops as well.Edgeworth:In that case, this means the camera's power was cut for three hours...Security Camera data updated in my Organizer.Gumshoe:While I'm at it, I've got some more information for you, sir. You heard that Knightley denied stealing the key, right? It seems nobody would believe the words of a criminal, but... ...Knightley testified, \"I was knocked out too.\"Edgeworth:That may not necessarily be a lie...Laguarde:My, my, my. There you all are! Making progress in your investigation? Can I be of any help?Edgeworth:Actually, Warden Laguarde, there is something we must report to you. The escaped prisoner... Jay Elbird, is most likely still inside the prison. He has disguised himself. Here is the proof. The person visible in this security video is Elbird. So, perhaps, he's still in this very building...!Kay:Come to think of it, didn't Mr. Elbird have a bracelet like the other prisoners?Edgeworth:The bracelet would have been concealed under the uniform's sleeves. Moreover... ...the prison's main gate does not have a sensor to detect bracelets. All he would have to do is avoid any doors with sensors inside the prison.Laguarde:Th-That's right. So, if he didn't enter the cells or the workrooms... ...could one of you guys be Jay Elbird...!?Kay:Ah! Rocky!Guard:S-Stop it! What are you doing!?Edgeworth:It would seem that Rocky has answered that question for us.Elbird:........Ngh. NOOOOOOOOOO! Rocky! This is all your fault!Edgeworth:The little guy loves you so much, it's enviable.Laguarde:Right then! Seize him at once!Edgeworth:Wait. There's something we must hear from this prisoner. It's necessary if we are to find the truth. I'd like permission to interrogate him.Laguarde:...Understood.Elbird:...What do you want out of me?Edgeworth:(Elbird's escape route is linked to Knightley's cell. So it's highly likely he knows something about the crime!) I'd like to ask you about the day the body was found.-- When the Body Was Found --Elbird:So it was you guys? You were the ones who found my secret tunnel!It took me ages to dig that!The day the body was found was the day I had planned to escape. I was in disguise.Then, Rocky followed after me.But he was all covered in mud. I panicked and returned to my cell.Elbird:Damn! If only you guys hadn't shown up! If only Knightley hadn't died!Edgeworth:You say you dug the tunnel. What did you use to dig it?Elbird:Oh, that... Just hammers... and spoons. Stuff like that. I bought them from the Supplier! But it was all for nothing!Kanis:Keh heh heh. No need to lose your temper. There's always next time.Edgeworth:(On the day of the incident, it's possible that Elbird met Knightley while he was alive. I'll have to listen to his testimony carefully.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You... Elbird: Shuddup! What's with that \"Hold it\", punk! Edgeworth: You say you dug... Elbird: What's it to you! You know how long it took me to dig that!? I had to beg the Supplier for those tools! Day after day, I slaved away! Give me back my hard work! Give it back, you sonuva...! Edgeworth: (I can't get a word in edgewise.) Elbird: You can't just go around discovering people's holes!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you dug that hole alone? Elbird: You're damn right I did! Edgeworth: Could a tunnel like that really be dug by one person? Kay: Wow... Such a wasted effort. Elbird: A kid like you wouldn't understand. Never rely on others. Never let others see you. Those are the rules we live by in here. Kay: Well... as a Great Thief, I kinda see where you're coming from. Edgeworth: ...Kay, don't agree with him. Kay: Ah, no! I was just joking! Elbird: Well, I wasn't! Damn, why'd it come to this!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Did you obtain the guard's uniform from the Supplier too? Elbird: Yeah... That's right. Seems he got it by threatening a guard. That guy went and stole it from someone's locker. Edgeworth: So, when you went through the tunnel, you were already dressed like a guard? Elbird: No. To ensure that the clothes wouldn't get stained with mud, I carried them with me. Once I got out of the hole and changed clothes, getting out the cell doors was simple. And that's when... Rocky ran up and jumped on me! Edgeworth: ...That must be the moment the security camera captured. I see. Could you add that to your testimony? Add statement: \"Once I got out of the hole and changed clothes, getting out the cell doors was simple.\"Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Getting out the cell door was \"simple\", you say...? Elbird: Yeah. Compared to going through the tunnel, it was very simple. Edgeworth: You inhabit a prison. Yet, you seem to know the layout of the detention center quite well. Elbird: ! Wh-What's so wrong about that? Sure, I've been to the detention center too. Edgeworth: (In that case, he should have known about it from the start. When Knightley was in his cell, the door would've been locked! Which means there was one piece of evidence Elbird needed to escape.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: When did you first realize he was following you? Elbird: When I got out of the tunnel. Just when I thought I pulled it off ...Damn! Edgeworth: Didn't you notice anything when you entered the tunnel? Elbird: He wasn't there at the time. I knew he would follow me if he was around. This is my chance! I thought... Just my luck, damn it...! Kay: Such harsh words... Poor Rocky... Elbird: I-I can't help it! Today was his fault too! Just like yesterday, always clinging onto me!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You didn't consider just making a run for it? Elbird: I would have if I could! But the mud would've given me away. And it's not like I'd get another chance like this. So, I had to proceed with caution. Edgeworth: (In the end, he was exposed by his own bear.)Edgeworth: (It's possible that Elbird met Knightley before he died. I should listen to his testimony carefully, and review the evidence.)",

      "newContext": "-- When the Body Was Found --Elbird:So it was you guys? You were the ones who found my secret tunnel!PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:You...Elbird:Shuddup! What's with that \"Hold it\", punk!Edgeworth:You say you dug...Elbird:What's it to you! You know how long it took me to dig that!? I had to beg the Supplier for those tools! Day after day, I slaved away! Give me back my hard work! Give it back, you sonuva...!Edgeworth:(I can't get a word in edgewise.)Elbird:You can't just go around discovering people's holes!Elbird:It took me ages to dig that!PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:So, you dug that hole alone?Elbird:You're damn right I did!Edgeworth:Could a tunnel like that really be dug by one person?Kay:Wow... Such a wasted effort.Elbird:A kid like you wouldn't understand. Never rely on others. Never let others see you. Those are the rules we live by in here.Kay:Well... as a Great Thief, I kinda see where you're coming from.Edgeworth:...Kay, don't agree with him.Kay:Ah, no! I was just joking!Elbird:Well, I wasn't! Damn, why'd it come to this!Elbird:The day the body was found was the day I had planned to escape. I was in disguise.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:Did you obtain the guard's uniform from the Supplier too?Elbird:Yeah... That's right. Seems he got it by threatening a guard. That guy went and stole it from someone's locker.Edgeworth:So, when you went through the tunnel, you were already dressed like a guard?Elbird:No. To ensure that the clothes wouldn't get stained with mud, I carried them with me. Once I got out of the hole and changed clothes, getting out the cell doors was simple. And that's when... Rocky ran up and jumped on me!Edgeworth:...That must be the moment the security camera captured. I see. Could you add that to your testimony?Add statement:\"Once I got out of the hole and changed clothes, getting out the cell doors was simple.\"Elbird:Once I got out of the hole and changed clothes, getting out the cell doors was simple.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:Getting out the cell door was \"simple\", you say...?Elbird:Yeah. Compared to going through the tunnel, it was very simple.Edgeworth:You inhabit a prison. Yet, you seem to know the layout of the detention center quite well.Elbird:! Wh-What's so wrong about that? Sure, I've been to the detention center too.Edgeworth:(In that case, he should have known about it from the start. When Knightley was in his cell, the door would've been locked! Which means there was one piece of evidence Elbird needed to escape.)Present Knightley's Cell KeyEdgeworth:Leads to:\"You say it was simple getting through the cell door?\"Elbird:Then, Rocky followed after me.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:When did you first realize he was following you?Elbird:When I got out of the tunnel. Just when I thought I pulled it off ...Damn!Edgeworth:Didn't you notice anything when you entered the tunnel?Elbird:He wasn't there at the time. I knew he would follow me if he was around. This is my chance! I thought... Just my luck, damn it...!Kay:Such harsh words... Poor Rocky...Elbird:I-I can't help it! Today was his fault too! Just like yesterday, always clinging onto me!Elbird:But he was all covered in mud. I panicked and returned to my cell.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:You didn't consider just making a run for it?Elbird:I would have if I could! But the mud would've given me away. And it's not like I'd get another chance like this. So, I had to proceed with caution.Edgeworth:(In the end, he was exposed by his own bear.)Edgeworth:(It's possible that Elbird met Knightley before he died. I should listen to his testimony carefully, and review the evidence.)Edgeworth:You say it was simple getting through the cell door?Elbird:Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that? Huh?Edgeworth:Even though you managed to arrive at Knightley's cell, opening the door wasn't so simple. How did you intend to unlock the cell door? Jay Elbird! You... had the key to Knightley's cell!Elbird:...! I ain't got... nothing like that. Th-That's it! It was open! It was already unlocked when I got there!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Indeed, the cell was vacant after Knightley's death. Which is why... ...at the time we conducted out investigation, it was unlocked. Your successful escape attempt occurred after Knightley's death. So the door would've been open. However, you had tried to escape once before then!Kay:The plan was foiled thanks to Rocky; the video shows it!Edgeworth:Yes. That was during the Animal Show. Before Knightley's death was known! And the cell door was locked! Because no one knew he was dead! Without the key to Knightley's cell, your escape would have been impossible!Elbird:Guh... Gwaaaarrgh!Gav\u00e8lle:That means... It can't be...!Edgeworth:It's exactly what you think. In the case of the stolen key, the culprit is... ...Jay Elbird! You were the one who attacked the guard, weren't you? The guard... and Knightley too! In order to steal the cell key!Elbird:I-It wasn't me! I don't know any Knightley!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:After stealing the key, you returned to your cell, as a precautionary measure. Then, you waited for a time when the prison would be mostly vacant. That was just before Knightley's death became known. In other words, during the Animal Show! But in the end, the plan was foiled thanks to Rocky...Elbird:Don't screw with me! If you don't have evidence, I'll still win by decision! Besides, it was that Knightley guy who attacked the guard, right?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:I think not. Regarding the theft of the keys, Knightley was the victim! This proves Knightley was the victim who was attacked in his cell...!Present Wiped FloorEdgeworth:Leads to:\"In Knightley's cell, there were traces of his blood, which had been wiped away.\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Debeste:Does this really prove it?Edgeworth:Of course.Debeste:If you say so, then I get the feeling he was definitely the victim.Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:Prosecutor Edgeworth. This evidence proves nothing.Debeste:Huh! Really... I knew that!Edgeworth:Nnghoooh! (It's not easy to fool Judge Gav\u00e8lle. I have to remember the state of Knightley's cell. I have to show what happened between those two!)Debeste:As I thought, you don't have proof, do you?Leads back to:\"This proves Knightley was the victim who was attacked in his cell...!\"Edgeworth:In Knightley's cell, there were traces of his blood, which had been wiped away. I believe this is more than enough proof Knightley was attacked in his cell. You attacked those two people and stole the key, didn't you?Elbird:Gwaaaaaaaaarrgh! ...Damn! I never thought you'd find the bloodstain I wiped away with the newspaper...Kay:Why would you go through all the trouble of wiping the bloodstain?Elbird:On the hands of Knightley and the guard, there were obvious signs of a scuffle, you know. If the bloodstains were uncovered, they'd find out there was another attacker! And if anyone looked around the bed, the tunnel I dug would be discovered!Edgeworth:So, you were trying to buy more time for your escape attempt. But I'm afraid to say your plan still ended in failure. Now then... Hand over the keys to Knightley's cell!Elbird:Guh... Gwoooh! Urgh! Gwaaaarrgh! D... a... mn iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit! No way... How could an amateur like you knock me out! Here. I got the keys right here.Knightley's Cell Key data updated in my Organizer.Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:Hold it! If you have that key, then that means...!Edgeworth:That's right, Judge Gav\u00e8lle. You reasoned that Knightley stole the key and used it to leave his cell... From there, he entered Mr. Saint' cage and was moved to the workroom. However... The very foundation of that hypothesis has collapsed!Gav\u00e8lle:Aaaaaaaaaah!Debeste:HOOOOOOOOOOOOW!Ray:I see. In that case... ...there was only one person who could have moved Knightley. The criminal must have been someone who knew about the secret tunnel.Elbird:...H-Hey! A-Are you suggesting...!Gumshoe:Jay Elbird! You're under arrest, pal!Elbird:W-Wait! I didn't do nothin'! Sure, I knocked out those two guys. Then, I stole the keys! And after that, I waited for the perfect time to enter that guy's cell. But, the cell was empty then! There was no dead body either. And also, how could I have gotten into the workroom? I couldn't even leave my own cell, right?Edgeworth:It's true, you only had the key to Knightley's cell. But... there's also Kanis's dog.Elbird:Wha?Edgeworth:It'd be possible for the dog to carry the body from the cell to the workroom.Ray:I see... So, you're saying there was an accomplice!Edgeworth:The crime would've been possible if Elbird and Kanis were working together. It's perfectly plausible. Somehow Elbird managed to carry Knightley's body to his own cell...Gumshoe:...and then, the dog must've carried it to the workroom!Edgeworth:Yes, because all the animals can move freely in the prison. But that's not the case for the path between the detention center and the prison. The only one who could use that route was you, Jay Elbird!Elbird:What if there was another route that you didn't know about?Edgeworth:Hmph. There couldn't have been. The tunnel is a straight path, is it not?Elbird:Yeah, seems like it. I didn't have enough time to dig any more than I did. I only dug halfway up the corridor.Edgeworth:What? You mean to say that you didn't dig the entire tunnel?Elbird:When I got to that cell, the tunnel was already there. There was a tunnel linking my cell to the well. Looking down the well from the courtyard, there's no mistaking it. They've always been connected.. I just continued the tunnel with my digging.Edgeworth:What was that hole doing there in the first place?Elbird:Who knows. Maybe another inmate dug it in an attempt to escape?Kay:Or maybe the animals dug it! Maybe they wanted to drink from the well?Edgeworth:(That's highly doubtful...)Elbird:There's no water in that well anymore. It's all dried up. Hm? Wait a minute. That's it. For some reason, that well gave off a nice scent.Edgeworth:A nice scent?Elbird:I don't know what it was, but it smelled sweet, like candy...Edgeworth:This scent... I believe we've come across it before. (We know this scent from...)Present Crime Scene NotesEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Knightley's body was giving off a sweet, candy-like scent.\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:Is it, by chance, this scent? Here, have a sniff.Elbird:*sniff* *sniff*... Nope, it wasn't this smell.Edgeworth:What!? (I must have been mistaken... When we found the tunnel, we followed some kind of scent... That must be the answer!)Leads back to:\"(We know this scent from...)\"Edgeworth:Knightley's body was giving off a sweet, candy-like scent. We used a police dog to track that scent. And that led us to discover the tunnel.Elbird:!Edgeworth:By any chance, could this be the same scent as the well?Gav\u00e8lle:Prosecutor Edgeworth, I know what you're trying to say. That the scent proves the body was carried down through the tunnel.Edgeworth:Exactly. And... Jay Elbird! You are the only one who could have used the tunnel!Gav\u00e8lle:...Thank you, Mr. Elbird. I am very grateful to you. At last... At last the truth comes to light. Mr. Elbird, wouldn't it be wise to confess now? To being an accomplice, I mean.Elbird:Don't tell me even you suspect me too?Edgeworth:Judge Gav\u00e8lle, it seems you and I have come to the same conclusion.Gav\u00e8lle:...Not at all. Our thoughts on this matter are still quite different. Mr. Elbird was certainly an accomplice, but an accomplice to Horace Knightley.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:...What do you mean?Gav\u00e8lle:Mr. Elbird did not move the body. He simply lent the victim his keys.Kay:Wha!Gav\u00e8lle:It would seem Mr. Elbird did indeed strike Mr. Knightley on the head. However... Mr. Knightley was not knocked out. The two must have made a little negotiation.Ray:Negotiation?Gav\u00e8lle:For Mr. Knightley's escape plan to work, he would have needed the keys to his cell. So, Mr. Elbird stole them from the guard... On the other hand, for Mr. Elbird to escape, he needed to get to Mr. Knightley's cell. But, if Mr. Knightley had seen him and yelled, the plan would have gone down the drain. .....And so, they \"negotiated\".Elbird:I-I didn't negotiate nothing!Gav\u00e8lle:Oh? You still intend to deny it?Ray:I see. So, in other words, we're back where we started.Gav\u00e8lle:Mr. Elbird opened the cell door, and Mr. Knightley entered Mr. Saint' cage. And then, he was moved into the prison.Debeste:Of course! And then he was killed in the prison workroom!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Weren't you listening? The scent on the body shows it must have been moved through the tunnel! Knightley was moved from the detention center through the tunnel...Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:...Please wait until someone is finished before speaking. I do not claim that he wasn't moved through the tunnel.Edgeworth:What?Debeste:Y-You don't?Gav\u00e8lle:The scent shows that the body was moved through the tunnel. However, that does not mean it came from the detention center.Kay:What do you mean? That sure sounds like a contradiction to me...Gav\u00e8lle:Isn't there one more possibility? The well in the courtyard... It's possible the body was dropped down from there.Kay:The courtyard...? Ahh! The well in the courtyard!Gav\u00e8lle:Mr. Saint carried the cage not to the workroom, but to the courtyard. Mr. Knightley was killed in the courtyard and his body was dropped down the well. And then, the body at the bottom of the well was moved by Mr. Kanis's dog. Now... there's one thing I'd like you all to remember. Before the body was discovered... What was happening in the courtyard?Kay:The Animal Show, right? Regina and Simeon were there. ...Wait? Simeon? ...Aaaaaaah!Gav\u00e8lle:I see you understand. Who then, dropped the body drown the well?Edgeworth:(Judge Gav\u00e8lle... She's a tough opponent. Her flexible way of thinking enables her to adapt and come up with her own deductions...)Gav\u00e8lle:Mr. Knightley was not carried to the workroom but to the courtyard... And Mr. Saint was off stage for 15 minutes. This was when he dropped Mr. Knightley down the well. It's as simple as that.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Judge Gav\u00e8lle, your reasoning is sound, I'll admit that. However, let's say the body was dropped down the well... That didn't have to be done during the show, it could have happened at a different time!Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:Unfortunately for you, Prosecutor Edgeworth, that is not possible.Edgeworth:What!?Gav\u00e8lle:When the show started, Mr. Elbird was in the tunnel, on his way to the cell block. Mr. Elbird. At that time, did you happen to see a body in the tunnel?Elbird:Nope... Nothing like that.Edgeworth:Ngh...!Gav\u00e8lle:So, if the body had been dropped before the show... Mr. Elbird would have seen it. However, he has stated he did not see a body. So it is impossible to think the body was dropped before the show. And after the show, the body was discovered in the workroom... In other words! The body being dropped down the well and then moved to the workroom... ...could only have been done during the show. And the only one who could have done it is Simeon Saint!Edgeworth:Nnghoooh!Kay:M-Mr. Edgeworth! Wh-What should we do?Edgeworth:(If the body was moved through the well, that does put Mr. Saint at a major disadvantage.) However! The notion that the body was moved through the well is only a hypothesis. That doesn't mean there is \"evidence.\"Gav\u00e8lle:..... I am obligated to recognize that fact.Edgeworth:Will you allow me to investigate the courtyard once more?Gav\u00e8lle:.....I give my approval, in the name of the Goddess of Law.Edgeworth:(Reinvestigating the courtyard... I fear this may be out final chance! Huh? What?)Kay:F-Fire!Gumshoe:Could be another prison break, pal!Ray:Sh-Should we evacuate?Laguarde:Everyone! Please remain calm! This is just the signal for the evening meal. It's a little loud, so I can understand why you'd be surprised.Kay:It sure scared me.Laguarde:I'm terribly sorry. And with that, everyone! Please return to your posts! Jay Elbird, it's also time for you to return to your room.Elbird:Ugh... Bah! I got it! .....Let's go, Rocky.Edgeworth:Warden Laguarde. We will be proceeding to the courtyard for another investigation.Laguarde:Isn't it time for you to go home as well, Mr. Edgeworth? It looks like we're out of time. Why don't you continue this another time?Edgeworth:B-But! The investigation...Laguarde:Today's been a big day, right? With the escaped prisoner and all. So, I'm afraid I can't let outsiders like you loiter around any longer.Edgeworth:(Ngh...)Laguarde:This is my decision as the warden of this prison.Gav\u00e8lle:.....Looks like it can't be helped. The warden's word can be called the law of the prison. Prosecutor Edgeworth. This means we will have to carry out our investigation another day. Until then, you may hold on to your Prosecutor's Badge. And with that, I leave you.Laguarde:Now, I think it's time you all left...Edgeworth:(Well, it looks like we'll have to continue the investigation tomorrow. Knightley's body was dropped down the well... And was carried to the workroom from Mr. Elbird's cell. This is Judge Gav\u00e8lle's logic, but is it correct? And... ...Judge Gav\u00e8lle claims that Mr. Saint transported him, but... ...was Mr. Saint really the only one with a chance to move him?)Kay:Mr. Edgeworth! Let's do our best tomorrow! We have to save Simeon, no matter what!Edgeworth:Indeed, I agree. (I must prove Mr. Saint' innocence without fail...!)To be continued.March 29, 10:12 AMPrisonCourtyardEdgeworth:The courtyard... Depending on what we find here, the entire incident could become clear. However...Kay:There's nothing left here.Edgeworth:(Yesterday...)Gav\u00e8lle:Isn't there one more possibility? The well in the courtyard... It's possible the body was dropped down from there.Gav\u00e8lle:In other words! The body being dropped down the well and then moved to the workroom... ...could only have been done during the show. And the only one who could have done it is Simeon Saint!Edgeworth:(Was the body dropped down the well or not? This could be the decisive clue that we need to reach the truth of the matter. Before I continue with the investigation, I should organize my evidence.)Unnecessary evidence has been removed. Remaining evidence has been re-arranged.Kay:Let's see here... Hey, there's a grate here!Ray:The well has run dry, after all. They even put a lock on it.Kay:Lock picking is one of my specialties! Wanna see?Edgeworth:There is absolutely no need for you to show off.Kay:Oh, c'mon. Don't be like that... Whoa!Edgeworth:What happened, Kay?Kay:The lock is broken! Judging from the looks of it... It feels like it was broken some time ago.Edgeworth:(So the lock was broken... This means that anyone could have dropped the body down this well.) According to Judge Gav\u00e8lle's reasoning, Mr. Saint murdered Knightley in the courtyard. And then, during the show, he disposed of the body in the well...Ray:You think so? Did he really use the well to move the body?Kay:Ah, I know! Let's get Missile to help us out again! He should be able to track the scent of the body!Edgeworth:Good idea. Let me contact Detective Gumshoe.Gumshoe:Yes, sir! Detective Gumshoe here!Edgeworth:Detective, I have a favor to ask of you. We would like for you to bring Missile to the prison courtyard.Gumshoe:Sounds like you need the help of one of my \"Seven Secret Weapons\" again, huh, sir?Edgeworth:(I thought Missile belonged to the police department.) And also, I would like for you to contact a witness. Please contact Regina Berry of the Berry Big Circus and bring her here.Gumshoe:Roger that, sir! I'll bring them over in a flash!Kay:So, what should we do while we wait for Gummy? How about some hide-and-seek?Ray:What are you talking about, Kay? There's nowhere to hide here.Edgeworth:(I don't think that is the issue.) Kay. During times like this, isn't it your turn to shine?Kay:Oh, that! You want me to re-create the crime scene!Ray:Huh? How do ya do that?Kay:See for yourself! The great Thief's secret weapon, Little Thief!Ray:Whoa! What's that? Screens floating in midair...! Just what are you doing, Kay?Kay:I'm entering the information needed for the simulation!Edgeworth:Mr. Shields, this \"Little Thief\"... ...is a tool that can re-create a crime scene based on the information it is given.Kay:Should I set it for how this place was like when we came here yesterday?Edgeworth:Yes. I believe they were in the middle of taking down the set. We didn't pay enough attention to the well, so it's possible we may have missed a clue.Kay:Leave it to me. I took a picture of the place too! There, there, there aaaaand there! Data entry complete! Now to set the projection to maximum output... Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood!Ray:Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What!? What just happened!?Kay:I re-created the courtyard from yesterday based on the information I entered! This was a tool the previous Yatagarasu used. It's a device to run simulations to practice stealing things.Edgeworth:But used in this manner, we can inspect the crime scene as it was in the past.Kay:Oh, but it's still only a re-creation based on what information we have! I can't re-create what I don't have information for, and if my information is incorrect... The re-creation could come out strange, too.Edgeworth:(In this case, since Kay had the photo, there should be no problems.) Now, let's begin the investigation.Begin InvestigationPrisonCourtyardKay:Since it's a re-creation, you can examine things just like you always do! You can even present evidence when you find a contradiction!Edgeworth:Yes, I know. (First, I should start with that well...)PartnerKay:Yeah, what's up?Notice anything?Kay:It'd be nice if we could come up with an alibi for Simeon!Edgeworth:Do not bring in your personal feelings or you won't be able to conduct a proper investigation. Information should be collected calmly and swifty.Kay:I see! It's just like how Mr. Edgeworth never shows any emotion; When you analyze your opponents with that icy glare!Edgeworth:(...Do I really come across as such a cold person...)PresentSecurity FootageKay:It's the exact moment of the murder! ...Or so we thought. Actually, the footage shows Mr. Elbird and Rocky the polar bear.Edgeworth:Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like this will be the compelling piece of evidence we need. But, according to the timestamp from the security camera, there are three hours missing. Why did the security camera lose power for three hours?Kay:It was probably just a power outage!Edgeworth:(I wonder... Is that really what happened...?)Well (bottom side)Edgeworth:Let's examine the area around the well. It holds the key to this case.Before examining well, pulleys, rope, and metal weightEdgeworth:(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)After examining well, pulleys, rope, and metal weightEdgeworth:(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)PulleysEdgeworth:Hm? There are some pulleys here... They don't appear to be the pulley that was used to lift the bucket from the well.WellEdgeworth:The well was behind the stage. That means...Ray:Only a few people would have access to dump the body in the well during the performance.Edgeworth:(This isn't looking good for Mr. Saint...)RopeEdgeworth:It's a sturdy hemp rope.Kay:It looks like the rope they use for tug-of-wars.Edgeworth:...I'm not going to play tug-of-war with you.Kay:I didn't even say anything yet!Edgeworth:There's a metal stake attached to the end of the rope.Kay:Ah! You use these to pin down the tent when you go camping!Edgeworth:(It doesn't seem like they'd need this for the performance... I wonder what it was used for?)Metal weightEdgeworth:This is... a metal weight. It weighs... It's hard to see in the re-creation. Kay. Do you remember?Kay:I think... it was 33 pounds (33 lbs (15 Kg) weights - Metal weights. Placed near the well. Each one weighs 33 pounds (15 Kg).). I wonder what such a heavy thing was used for?Edgeworth:It doesn't seem to be directly related to the circus.(Examining well, pulleys, rope, and metal weight leads to:)Kay:These things around the well (Tools around the well - Pulleys, metal weights and ropes. What could they be used for?), what were they used for? They don't seem to be related to the Animal Show.Edgeworth:I agree. We can ask Ms. Berry about it later.Well (top side)PulleyEdgeworth:This pulley was used to lift the bucket from the well. The bucket... can't be found.DoorEdgeworth:This door is locked.Kay:Want me to pick the lock? Success is not guaranteed though!Edgeworth:No, if need be I'll just borrow a key.Kay:Sheesh. I thought it was finally a chance for me to steal the spotlight.Edgeworth:Don't even think about stealing anything in my presence... Not even the spotlight.Raymond ShieldsRay:A Great Thief's secret weapon. ...He he, I see. But, isn't this bad? Using a thief's tool to aid in the investigation?Edgeworth:.........Ray:Don't make such a scary face. It's alright, Uncle Ray's lips are sealed. ...It's for the truth, right?Edgeworth:The evidence may very well already have been destroyed. In order to re-create the crime scene, we need her help.Ray:Why so serious? At times like this, a simple smile will suffice.Edgeworth:Yes. Thank you very much.CartEdgeworth:This crate... No, there are tires attached to it, so I guess it's a cart.Kay:Just once, I'd like to ride one of these bad boys down a hill.Edgeworth:.........Kay:Ah! Or maybe one of those office chairs with wheels, doesn't that sound like fun?Edgeworth:(...What is she talking about?)AstiqueRay:Umm. What was the elephant's name again?Kay:She's Astique the Asian Elephant (Astique the elephant - Star of the show. Along with Regent the tiget and Simeon.)!Ray:Ahh. That's right. It's an easy name to remember.Edgeworth:Maybe... they couldn't think of a good name, so they gave her a name that's easy to remember?Kay:Mr. Edgeworth! What a terrible thing to say about poor Astique!LakeEdgeworth:This pond is where Warden Laguarde keeps her pet alligator.Kay:I guess those fish bones are the remains of her last meal...Edgeworth:I don't think an alligator would leave such clean bones.Kay:But she had a very refined-looking face.Edgeworth:I couldn't tell at all.Kay:That's because I'm a girl who's good with faces.Edgeworth:(...Why don't I feel the least bit jealous?)Barbed wire wallKay:What an impressive barbed wire fence! It really gets my thief's blood boiling.Edgeworth:I wouldn't touch it though. You'll be in for quite a shock.Kay:I wonder what's on the other side of the fence?Edgeworth:...Looks like the warden's office.Kay:I heard she keeps even more animals over there.Edgeworth:(Why don't they just turn this place into a zoo already?)(Examining Astique, well, pulleys, rope, and metal weight leads to:)Edgeworth:That's all the information we can gather for now. The detective should be here soon too. Kay, go ahead and shut down Little Thief.Kay:Alright! Returning the area to normal!Investigation Complete???:Sorry to keep you waiting, sir!Kay:Hey, speak of the Gummy!Edgeworth:Detective Gumshoe. That was quick.Gumshoe:I couldn't keep you waiting for too long, sir!Kay:Thanks for coming along too, Regina!Regina:No problem! It sounded like fun, so I skipped practice to come here!Edgeworth:Thank you for your cooperation. First, Detective, let's have Missile do some tracking.Gumshoe:No problem, sir! Hey, Missile! Over here, pal! Hey, what's eating you, pal? I said over here!Edgeworth:What's the matter?Gumshoe:It looks like he's scared of something, sir.Kay:A-A-A-A-A-A! A-Alligator!Gumshoe:I guess he's scared of the alligator, sir.Edgeworth:Good grief. Looks like Missile won't be much help to us.Ray:So what should we do, Miles?Edgeworth:Maybe we can ask Ms. Berry for help.Regina:What is it? What is it? Is there something I can do? Do you want me to teach Ally a trick?Edgeworth:(Actually, she probably could.) No, I just need you to tell me about the condition of the courtyard during the show.Kay:Looks like it's my time to shine again!Edgeworth:Yes, if you please.Kay:Alright, that should do it! I'm starting up the re-creation now!Kay:Re-creation complete! This time you can see how the courtyard was during the Animal Show!Edgeworth:This should be around the time the body was dropped down the well.Regina:Wow, cool! It's just like magic!Kay:He he he, it's not magic. I just re-created the scene based on the information you gave us. See? Look over there.Edgeworth:Hm? The backstage area is missing...Kay:Well, Regina didn't help with the preparations, so... She doesn't really know how it was set up.Ray:I get it. You can't re-create what you don't have the info for, huh.Regina:I'm sorry. It's because Simeon took care of setting everything up...Ray:Don't worry yourself none, Regina-pie. Miles is the one as fault here.Edgeworth:(Why me...?)Kay:Mr. Edgeworth! I've re-created the show in progress... But I can also change it to how it was earlier, when it was being taken down!Edgeworth:I see. So we can examine the courtyard during the show and after the show... We can freely switch between the two different states. (To change the re-creation, select Little Thief on the bottom screen.) Now, let's begin the investigation.Begin InvestigationPrisonCourtyardLogic\"Astique the elephant\" and \"Missing apples\"Edgeworth:The apples in the crate were probably eaten by Astique...Regina:But it's strange. I remember leaving the crate out of reach from Astique's nose.Edgeworth:Are you certain?Kay:Yes. The crate was still full of apples on the night before the show.Edgeworth:Then, the cart was moved to where her nose could reach it. With that many apples, it could not have been moved by the wind. Most likely... the crate was moved by a person (Crate of apples - Somebody moved the crate of apples on the night before the show.). Prior to the show, the cart's position was already changed and the apples were all eaten. This appears to be the correct information. Please update the simulation parameters, Kay.Kay:Alright, I'll use the new info to re-create the scene! While recreating the After the Show sceneKay:First, let's return to the \"During the Show\" scene!Leads to:\"Using the info we got from Regina, I'll re-create the scene with the cart in its actual place!\"Kay:Using the info we got from Regina, I'll re-create the scene with the cart in its actual place!Kay:Re-creation complete!\"Tools around the well\" and \"Simeon's stunt\"Leads to:\"Mr. Saint used a device for his stunt...\"PartnerKay:Yeah, what's up?Change Re-creation (while recreating During the Show)Kay:You want to re-create the After the Show scene from yesterday?Kay:The After the Show scene from yesterday has been re-created!Change Re-creation (while recreating After the Show)Kay:You want to re-create the During the Show scene from two days ago?Kay:The During the Show scene from two days ago has been re-created!Using Little ThiefKay:Do you still remember how the Little Thief works?Edgeworth:Yes. I can basically examine its re-creation like I normally do in my investigations.Kay:Yes! If something catches your eye, please examine it to your heart's content! Oh, but if there's an error with the info, the re-creation could come out a bit strange, alright? If you find anything strange, please present some evidence!Edgeworth:I'm still not used to the new feature of the Little Thief...Kay:Using the latest feature, we can re-create the same spot at different times! By the way, we can currently re-create... ...the \"During the Show\" from two days ago, and the \"After the Show\" from yesterday!Edgeworth:(When I want to investigate a different scene, I'll ask her to Change Re-creation.)Regina BerryKay:Do you come here often, Regina?Regina:Yes. I have many friends here. I love this place! New friends, old friends, everyone's a friend here. Yesterday, Ms. Warden introduced me to a new friend, little Ally.Edgeworth:(The alligator who lurks in the pond in the courtyard...)Kay:That pond... If you get too close, it feels like you'll get \"gulped\".Regina:Umm. I don't think little Ally would do such a thing. Her stomach wasn't feeling very well yesterday. I'm worried. Aren't you all worried too? ...Right?Kay:Y-Yes! Of course! We're all worried, right? Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:Umm... Urk. (Don't drag me into this.)Dick GumshoeGumshoe:Mr. Edgeworth! You've got that look on your face, like you want to use my secret weapons, sir!Edgeworth:Hmm...?Gumshoe:Missile isn't in the mood, but I've got my fishing rod ready to go! Or would you prefer the metal detector (Metal detector - One of Gumshoe's Seven Secret Weapons! Can detect metal objects.)?Edgeworth:(I've never seen the detective's eyes sparkle like that.) If need be, I'll let you know. For now, just stand by.WellEdgeworth:At this point in time, we still don't have enough information about this area.Kay:That's right, Mr. Edgeworth. Please steal some information!Edgeworth:I don't steal information. I obtain it through my investigation and logic.Kay:I prefer to act first before thinking!Edgeworth:You may act before thinking as long as you don't interfere with the investigation. I wouldn't want to arrest you.MissileMissile:...*whimper*...Gumshoe:As you can see, he's totally scared, sir.Edgeworth:I wanted him to track a scent, but it looks like that won't be possible.Missile:...*whimper*...ChairsEdgeworth:These chairs are lined up in an orderly fashion. (I guess there were a few empty seats during the performance...)Kay:This intimate atmosphere... And this closeness between the stage and the audience. It reminds me of the karaoke tournament I entered when I was a kid.Edgeworth:Karaoke tournament?Kay:I was the runner-up! \u266c Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! \u266a \u266c Now, listen to the song of a real, modern-day Robin Hood! \u266aEdgeworth:Don't tell me, you actually sang that song?Kay:Of course, this song rocks!Edgeworth:(I'm surprised she actually made it to the finals. ...Did she steal second place? No. If she didn't steal first place, she must have gotten there fair and square...)StageKay:A love story between an elephant and a tiger... I really wanted to see that. I also wanted to see Simeon in action!Regina:Simeon is really amazing! Especially the part where he gets blown away.Edgeworth:(Blown away... That's the scene in question.)Gav\u00e8lle:At that point, the suspect, in the role of the villain... ...is blown away by the heroine's burning love, and makes his exit. After being blown away, the suspect disappeared from the stage.Edgeworth:Are you saying the crime was committed during that time?Edgeworth:Do you know how long he was gone from the stage?Regina:Let me think. About 15 minutes or so.Edgeworth:(It's just as Judge Gav\u00e8lle said...)Ray:But... isn't it dangerous? To be blown away by an elephant?Regina:It's alright! Astique is very gentle!Edgeworth:(That's not who we're worried about here...)Regina:During the first few practices, he was having trouble getting blown away... Then all of a sudden, he was able to be sent flying beautifully. He might be using some sort of device, but it's amazing!Edgeworth:A device...? Do you know anything about it?Regina:Umm. I have no idea. Simeon handled it all by himself (Simeon's stunt - The scene where Astique knocks Simeon into the air employs some kind of trick.).CartEdgeworth:Oh? This crate was empty in the re-creation earlier...Kay:That's right... It was also empty in the picture I took.Regina:Ah. I'm sorry. That information is wrong.Edgeworth:What do you mean?Regina:This crate contained Astique's food... In the morning on the day of the show, all the apples were gone. I totally forgot about that. ...I'm sorry.Edgeworth:(Missing apples (Missing apples - Astique's feed. Was there the day before the show, was gone the next morning.), huh. I should make a note of it.)Cart (after connecting cart Logic)Edgeworth:No wonder I thought it smelled like animals, it contained the elephant's food.Kay:So this was filled with Astique's apples.Regina:That's right. On the day before the show, it was full of apples!Edgeworth:And in the morning, they were all gone...Kay:Oh! Did you think of something?Edgeworth:You could say that.CageEdgeworth:It's the cage of the Asian elephant... Astique. The elephant is performing on stage right now, so the cage is empty.Kay:I wonder how Astique entered the courtyard?Edgeworth:What do you mean how?Kay:The entrance here is human-sized! And this fence is electrified... I don't think an elephant would enter from there.Edgeworth:...They could just turn off the electricity.Kay:If they did that, all the inmates would escape!Edgeworth:(I doubt anyone would escape while an elephant was entering.)Kay:Hmm. I wonder how she came in. This requires some thought!Edgeworth:(...She seems to be enjoying her little brain teaser. I should just let her be.)Edgeworth:Mr. Saint used a device for his stunt... Maybe the tools around the well are connected to this?While recreating the During the Show sceneEdgeworth:Kay. I'd like to recheck the tools lying around the well yesterday. Can you change the re-creation to the After the Show scene?Kay:Roger!Leads to:\"The tools lying around the well. Could they have been a part of his device?\"Edgeworth:The tools lying around the well. Could they have been a part of his device?Kay:It seems very likely! I wonder if it's possible to re-create the device?Edgeworth:If you ask Mr. Saint, he should be able to tell you how the device was put together.Kay:Alright! I'll go ask him!Kay:Mr. Edgeworth! I asked him about it!Edgeworth:And, did you find out how the device works?Kay:He used a rope to hang some weights on the well's pulley... The weights were suspended inside the well. Then, he ran the rope through two more pulleys... ...and tied the end of the rope to his own body.Edgeworth:So he uses the force of the falling weights to send himself flying. But, what's to stop the weights from falling on their own?Kay:In order to prevent that from happening, he used a stopper!Edgeworth:Ms. Berry didn't know anything about the well. That means... ...Mr. Saint removed the stopper by himself?Kay:Correct! That's why a second rope was needed. This rope was attached to the stopper, and when it was pulled from the stage...Edgeworth:The stopper would be removed, and the weights would drop down the well.Kay:I'm definitely going to steal this idea! The Yatagarasu won't lose to something like this!Edgeworth:Don't waste your time. Circus acts require extensive training. Even if you steal the device, it won't do you any good.Kay:Then, I'll train as well!Edgeworth:...Before you start training, could you first update the re-creation?Kay:Ah. Oh yeah, you wanted me to re-create the device that was used in the performance. First, let's return to the During the Show scene! Next, I'll input the information of the device on the well! Now we can re-create the device Simeon made!Edgeworth:So, this is the device that Mr. Saint used.Simeon's Device data jotted down in my Organizer.Kay:Simeon sure is gutsier than he looks. Using the falling weights... as the force to launch himself during his performance...Edgeworth:Indeed. He would have to drop enough weights to exceed his own body weight. In order to provide the strength needed to pull him off the stage (Strength to be pulled - In order for the stunt to work, the weights must exceed Simeon's weight.).Kay:Simeon must have practiced a lot for this.Logic\"33 lbs (15 Kg) weights\" and \"Strength to be pulled\"Leads to:\"Huh? Isn't this strange?\"PartnerKay:Yeah, what's up?PresentSimeon's DeviceKay:Seeing a well gets me excited for some reason. There could be secret trapdoors or ghosts down there.Edgeworth:More importantly, what do you think about the device on the well?Kay:A well with a secret device... I'm getting even more excited!Edgeworth:.....Good for you.Well (bottom side)SheetEdgeworth:(This sheet... It's the same as the one from the workroom...!)Kay:Isn't this the same as the one from the workroom?Edgeworth:Yes. (Why is there also one here?)Kay:I wonder why there's one here?Edgeworth:.........Kay:Huh? Mr. Edgeworth, are you deep in thought?Edgeworth:(Why does it feel like she's stealing my thoughts...?)WellEdgeworth:Mr. Saint used this well to perform the stunt where he gets blown away by the elephant. He used those two ropes quite skillfully.Metal weightKay:Looking at this weight, you can really feel the weight of Simeon's hard work on your chest.Edgeworth:...Is that so? I don't feel anything at all.Kay:Aww, that's too bad. If this was an actual weight... ...I'd immediately put it on your chest, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:(...And I'd do everything in my power to stop you.)Well (top side)RopeEdgeworth:This rope dangles into the well.Kay:I doubt a pi\u00f1ata is on the other end of the rope, nor is it candy, obviously...Edgeworth:Take this more seriously.Kay:C'mon, Mr. Edgeworth. It was a joke, a joke! Please don't take everything so seriously.Edgeworth:(No. Wait... What's on the other end of the rope... This could be worth thinking over.)PulleyEdgeworth:A rope and pulley. That's how it should be.Kay:A rope and pulley. A thief and treasure. It's a perfect match!Edgeworth:Objection. A thief and handcuffs are a perfect match.Kay:Huh? Isn't this strange?Gumshoe:What's wrong, pal?Edgeworth:Haven't you noticed, Detective? What's strange about the weight is...The weightLeads to:\"...it's not heavy enough.\"The numberEdgeworth:What's strange is the number of weights... In other words...Leads to:\"...it's not heavy enough.\"The materialEdgeworth:What's strange about the weight is the material it's made of.Gumshoe:What's wrong with the material it's made of, sir?Edgeworth:Hmph... So you still don't get it, Detective.Gumshoe:I have absolutely not clue, sir!Kay:I don't get it either!Edgeworth:I don't know either...Kay:Mr. Edgeworth! Please be more serious!Edgeworth:Mm... Mmph. (Let me think this over again.)Gumshoe:So... What's so strange, sir?Leads back to:\"Haven't you noticed, Detective? What's strange about the weight is...\"Edgeworth:...it's not heavy enough (Not heavy enough - In order to lift Simeon's body, more weights are required.). In order to pull up Mr. Saint' body weight...Gumshoe:Y-You're right, sir!Edgeworth:But... Where did the rest of the weights disappear to?Gumshoe:Looks like it's time to use my Seven Secret Weapons, sir!Edgeworth:(Hmm... If necessary, I'll let the detective know...)Logic\"Not heavy enough\" and \"Metal detector\"Leads to:\"Detective Gumshoe. It's time for your secret weapon.\"Edgeworth:Detective Gumshoe. It's time for your secret weapon.Gumshoe:Yes, sir!Edgeworth:...I was hoping for the metal detector.Gumshoe:I don't get many chances to use this one...Gumshoe:Before we begin the search, let me go over how to use the metal detector, sir! This metal detector uses sound... ...and this meter... ...to let you know how close you are to a metal object! When you get closer to a metal object... ...the metal detector will have a bigger reaction, like this. When you get the biggest reaction... ...give me the order to Examine that spot, sir! Now, let's see what we've got? ...It's just the metal fence... And that's basically how you search for metal objects. Just give me the instructions on where you want to search, sir!Metal detectorGumshoe:Let me explain how to use the metal detector, sir! The sound and the meter will let you know how close you are to the metal objects... That's how this metal detector works, sir! The closer you are to a metal object, the bigger the reaction will be. When you get the biggest reaction, make sure to Examine it! I'll handle the searching part, so just give me the instructions, sir!AnyoneEdgeworth:Detective Gumshoe! Enough with the idle chatter and continue the investigation!Gumshoe:Oooh... Yes, sir!LakeLeads to:\"Yeah! There's a reaction here, too, sir!\"Near basketball standGumshoe:Here, sir! It looks like there's something here! Oooooh...! It's a gold coin, sir! It's a historical discovery!Edgeworth:It's hardly possible that something like this could find its way into a prison.Guard:Ah, there it is! So that's where it was buried! That's a coin from the bi-weekly coin hunting competition!Gumshoe:There's an event like that? That sure sounds like fun, pal!Guard:It's an event where the warden buries some coins and the prisoners search for them... There are 3 silver coins and 1 gold coin. Whoever finds them can trade them in for snacks.Edgeworth:(A coin hunting competition and an Animal Show... Just what kind of prison is this, anyway?)Gumshoe:Let's continue the search, sir!Near Regina BerryGumshoe:Here, sir! It looks like there's something here!Edgeworth:I don't see anything that could be metallic... What could be causing the reaction?Gumshoe:Hmm... Maybe there are iron filings around here.Edgeworth:Iron filings, like the ones you collect with a magnet?Gumshoe:Yes, sir. I guess they're mixed into the sand here. If we're going to pull them out, we'll need Secret Weapon No. 6! ...Or was it 7?Edgeworth:Can't you even keep that much straight?Gumshoe:It's just a regular magnet I bought at the hardware store! Hold it near the ground and... Presto! Picked them all up, sir! Wow... This is really... Ha ha ha... Well, whaddya know...Edgeworth:(Finding simple joy in simple tasks... What a simpleton. Let's check somewhere else.)Gumshoe:Let's continue the search, sir!Anywhere else meter stopsGumshoe:No reaction, sir. Seems a little discouraging, huh?Anywhere else meter hits yellowGumshoe:I think we're getting warmer, but the reaction's still kind of weak, sir.Anywhere else meter hits orangeGumshoe:We're getting close, sir! There should be something metal nearby!Gumshoe:Yeah! There's a reaction here, too, sir! Let's check it out... Huh? I found these in the clumps of grass here, sir!Edgeworth:These are the weights used for that hoisting device! (Were these intentionally hidden...?)Gumshoe:There's four of them in all, sir!Kay:That many weights would be enough to lift Simeon!Edgeworth:So, the other weights that were used in the device were hidden. (Why were they hidden over here, though?)Gumshoe:See? I'm really earning my keep today, aren't I, sir? Eeeeeeeeek!Kay:Ah! The alligator!Gumshoe:Th-That scared me, pal... Huh?Edgeworth:What's the matter, Detective?Gumshoe:It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator.Kay:Really! Why?Edgeworth:Are you sure it isn't still just reacting to the weights?Gumshoe:It's a different reaction, sir! And it's definitely coming from the alligator!Edgeworth:(It's gone...)Kay:Looks like it's scared of us!Regina:Hmm... I don't think so, Kay.Kay:Huh?Regina:If anything, I think Ally looks a little under the weather.Edgeworth:(Ally... I suppose that was what Warden Laguarde called it.)Regina:She didn't eat any of the food that the warden gave her yesterday... I think she might have eaten something bad.Gumshoe:So I guess the metal detector could be reacting to whatever the alligator ate.Kay:Oh! Maybe she ate one of the weights?Edgeworth:I doubt that even an alligator can ingest a 33 pound weight. (But what could the metal detector be reaction to? And regardless, why were these weights hidden? Hmm, maybe we should take another look at the device on the well.) Kay, I'd like you to re-create the After the Show scene again.Kay:Alright!

It'd be neat if it were true!Edgeworth:...Starting tomorrow, you're pairing up with Mr. Debeste.Gumshoe:Eeehh! No way, sir! Not with that goofy prosecutor!Edgeworth:(He'd be a perfect match for this goofy detective.)Well (bottom side, during the show)WellEdgeworth:Mr. Saint used this well to perform the stunt where he gets blown away by the elephant.

When the rope that was tied to him was undone and let go... ...both the body and the rope dropped down the well... The rope wasn't used to tie up Knightley. It was used to suspend him inside the well. That also explains why the other weights were hidden.Kay:Ah! So that no one would find out that the weights were replaced with the body!Edgeworth:Yes. The killer was the one who hid those weights.Ray:But, Miles. Wasn't Knightley-boy stabbed in the neck with the murder weapon?

In other words, it doesn't matter where the real killer was or what they were doing during the show. Until now, this placed the doubt on the people who did not watch the Animal Show.Kay:I-It's true, we also suspected Mr. Kanis...Edgeworth:The killer's true intent was to make us think that the murder occurred during the show. In other words, they used the device on the well to create a fake alibi! Ms. Berry. Do you know when this device on the well was set up?Regina:Umm, let me think. The day before the show. I think it was at night. We all started preparing at 9 PM. We finished at around midnight.Edgeworth:The killer replaced the weights with the dead body (Weights switched with body - The device was set up with the body on the night before the show.) afterwards.Simeon's Device data updated in my Organizer.Edgeworth:(Did Kanis know about the device...? No, even if he knew about the device, it wouldn't be possible for him to use it. You can't teach a dog to suspend a body in a well. In other words...

The body was also switched the night before the show.Kay:I don't think it was just a coincidence.Edgeworth:Keeping that in mind, the question now becomes... Why was the cart moved? The cart used to be in front of that door. I can think of one reason why.Kay:Somebody opened that door! Alright, let's hurry up and... The door's locked. Let's ask a guard! Hey! Mr. Guard!Guard:Yes!

I see you have arrived early.Edgeworth:Or maybe it is you who are late, Judge Gav\u00e8lle.Gav\u00e8lle:I have many matters which require my attention... I have no time to waste. Unlike a certain prosecutor who was taken off the case.Edgeworth:(Grr...)Gav\u00e8lle:Oh, my apologies. I had forgotten that you were assisting the defense attorney.Debeste:An assistant can never be the best! You've fallen like the rest!Edgeworth:(You just say whatever you like, don't you...)Gav\u00e8lle:Let us begin our examination of the courtyard, Sebastian.Debeste:Alright! I'll call the men over.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:That will be unnecessary.Debeste:What!?Edgeworth:We have already finished the investigation of the courtyard. You've been bested.Debeste:Bested... Me!Edgeworth:Judge Gav\u00e8lle. Your reasoning from yesterday... Watch me shatter it to pieces.Gav\u00e8lle:........ I would advise you to choose your words more carefully. Have you forgotten that the fate of your badge rests in my hands?Edgeworth:I have had enough of such coercion. Can't you think of some other way to threaten me that does not involve my badge?Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:...Despite my repeated warnings, you show no signs of reflection... It seems I must remind you once more. The Prosecutorial Investigation Committee can't leave someone such as yourself unchecked.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Neither the fate of my badge nor the actions of the Committee will impede my progress. Proving Mr. Saint' innocence... That is all that concerns me.Gav\u00e8lle:Your words are like those of a defense attorney. If you are willing to go that far, then I will show no leniency. In the name of the Goddess of Law, I shall turn your words against you. And at that moment... You will forfeit the title of \"Prosecutor\". You shall regret this...-- Judge Gav\u00e8lle's Reasoning --Gav\u00e8lle:I shared my reasoning with you the day before.Since Mr. Elbird did not see the body when he passed through the tunnel...It could only have been dropped down the well during the show.The only one who could have performed such an act is the suspect.Edgeworth:Naturally, you have evidence to support your reasoning?Gav\u00e8lle:........Debeste:Of course she does! Who do you think she is!?Gav\u00e8lle:...Earlier, I received the official autopsy report.Edgeworth:(Babysitting that kid must be difficult.)Gav\u00e8lle:The time of death was the night before the body was discovered... In other words, the day before the show. The cause of death remains unchanged, a stab wound four inches deep.Autopsy Report updated in my Organizer.Gav\u00e8lle:Simeon Saint was not present on the stage for a period of 15 minutes. There was sufficient time for him to drop the body down the well.Edgeworth:(She has not investigated the courtyard yet. That means...) Hm. It seems there is a hole in your argument.Gav\u00e8lle:You seem quite confident. ...Can you present evidence to support your claim?Edgeworth:Of course I can, and I will.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you continue to believe Mr. Saint is the murderer? Gav\u00e8lle: Just as you continue to speak as if he is not. Do you have any decisive evidence? Do you know the identity of the true criminal? Edgeworth: You do realize you need proper evidence, too. Gav\u00e8lle: I am a representative of the Goddess of Law. My words are her holy orders. Indeed... If I state something is black, it is black. If I state something is white, it is white! Edgeworth: (So what would you call gray?) Gav\u00e8lle: If you wish to disprove my words, then present your evidence at once!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Couldn't it be possible that Elbird just failed to notice the body? Gav\u00e8lle: Ms. Assistant's Assistant, did you also enter the hole? Kay: Huh? How'd you know? Gav\u00e8lle: I noticed that there was some mud stuck on your lovely hair ornament yesterday. Kay: That's amazing! Your powers of observation would even put a Great Thief to shame! Gav\u00e8lle: In the name of the Goddess of Law, answer me truthfully. If there were a dead body in that tunnel, would it have escaped your notice? Kay: W-Well, the thing is... Um... Yeah, I think I would've noticed something like that. Gav\u00e8lle: Do you understand now? Mr. Elbird did not see the body.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The body was dropped down the well during the show? I'd like to hear your reasoning for this. Gav\u00e8lle: The day before the show, Mr. Elbird lent the key to Mr. Knightley. Edgeworth: (The key to Knightley's cell, huh...) Gav\u00e8lle: Mr. Knightley escaped from his cell with the key and entered the cage Mr. Saint had prepared. Mr. Saint then moved the cage to the courtyard, and proceeded to murder Mr. Knightley. The next day, when Mr. Elbird passed through the tunnel, he did not come across the body. Kay: Please wait a minute! That doesn't seem right at all! Wasn't there a sweet smell in the tunnel? Mr. Knightley must have passed through it! Gav\u00e8lle: Mr. Knightley passed through the tunnel after Mr. Elbird did. Mr. Elbird passed through the tunnel at the start of the show. However, the body wasn't found until the end of the show. Edgeworth: Which is why you believe the body was dropped during the show. Gav\u00e8lle: Yes. And there is only one person who could have carried out this act.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There is no one else who could have committed the murder? Gav\u00e8lle: I heard that Ms. Berry was present on stage at all times. A great number of the prisoners were also watching the show. Even the prisoners who did not see it have sufficient alibis. Edgeworth: How about the guards? Gav\u00e8lle: Along with the warden, nearly everyone was watching the show. Edgeworth: But there must have been a chance for even one of them to approach the well. Gav\u00e8lle: During the show, none of the guards left their posts. That much is certain. They all testified as such. Edgeworth: (Ugh... She's left no room for oversight...) Gav\u00e8lle: Do you finally admit that only Simeon Saint could have been the criminal?Edgeworth: Judge Gav\u00e8lle has not thoroughly examined the courtyard like we have.Ray: So there's a bit of a gap in her argument, right?Edgeworth: (I should review the evidence we obtained in the courtyard.)",

There was a device set up around the well here.Gav\u00e8lle:What is this device of which you speak?Edgeworth:Are you aware of the stunt in which Mr. Saint is blown away by the elephant during the show?Gav\u00e8lle:I have heard of it. It would have been right before he exits the stage.Edgeworth:He tied one end of a length of rope to himself, and the other end to a set of weights... He was able to perform the stunt by dropping these weights down the well.Debeste:Debeste:Wouldn't he have spent the whole play suspended up in the air?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:That's why he had a stopper attached to the weighted end. The stopper was removed by pulling another rope. Around the well, we found evidence that the weights were switched with the victim's body. This was done by the real killer in order to shift suspicion away from them!Gav\u00e8lle:........Edgeworth:Judging from the time of death, the murder was carried out in the early morning of the show. The true criminal had until the time the show started to set up the device.Debeste:Debeste:But didn't Simeon Saint made that thing? And since he was also the one who used it, he is \"the best\" suspect... Don't you agree?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:If Mr. Saint were the murderer, he would not have needed to do that! Ms. Berry!Regina:Yes?Edgeworth:Was there anyone else who knew of the device he set up?Regina:Well, let me see... Since we had to get everything about our show approved by the people here at the prison... I'd say there were others who knew about it.Edgeworth:...And there you have it.Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:I see... You have indeed performed a thorough investigation. Which is why I am even further perplexed. Why do you not use your efforts for justice?Edgeworth:My actions are not just? Who made that decision?Gav\u00e8lle:You cannot understand even that? Even now? Providing support to a defense attorney, despite being a prosecutor... Is it quite unnatural. This goes against the rules.Edgeworth:I am merely choosing to do what I think is right at this particular time. I travel down the road I have chosen. Your comprehension does not matter in the least. However, if anyone intends to interfere... I will show no mercy!Gav\u00e8lle:Perhaps this is a calling from the Goddess of Law. If you intend to rebel against her divine will... I will have no choice but to hand down my verdict. Pay heed to my words. I have one more reason to suspect Simeon Saint of murder.-- Reason for Suspicion --Gav\u00e8lle:If the body came from the courtyard...How was Mr. Knightley brought here from the detention center?Only Simeon Saint could have provided such an opportunity.Because of this fact, I find it most difficult to suspect any other party of the crime.Gav\u00e8lle:While Simeon Saint was moving supplies for the show, he visited Mr. Knightley's cell. Does that not strike you as odd? Why else would he have brought a large, covered cage with him?Kay:Ohh... That does seem pretty suspicious...Edgeworth:Mr. Saint... Was merely that kind of person. It is entirely possible that he carelessly brought it there!Gav\u00e8lle:If that is possible... Then it is also possible that he was assisting in the escape. Am I wrong?Edgeworth:(Hmm... I suppose I must refute her theory with evidence.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You seem to believe that Knightley was killed in the courtyard... So, can you say when he was brought here? Gav\u00e8lle: On the day of the show between midnight and 8 AM. I am positive it could only have been during that time. Edgeworth: (So after rehearsal had ended and before the show began.) Gav\u00e8lle: The most pressing issue is...Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you certain there were no other routes? Gav\u00e8lle: A trial date had not yet been determined for Mr. Knightley. Since he was not a prisoner, he could not have easily entered the prison. He would have stood out too much. Edgeworth: Meaning no one testified seeing him there. Gav\u00e8lle: Well done! May you be blessed by the Goddess of Law! As I said, Mr. Knightley was taken into the prison through a less conspicuous manner.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you certain that he was the only person who had the opportunity? Gav\u00e8lle: Have you forgotten? This is a prison. Due to the constant supervision, it would be impossible to do anything unusual. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then, wouldn't it be the same for Mr. Saint? Gav\u00e8lle: Gav\u00e8lle: The warden has shown favor to the Berry Big Circus. Simeon Saint is a circus member. Ms. Berry's apprentice, no less. ...It could only have been him. He was able to move about freely within the facility. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It seems that you forgot to mention that. Gav\u00e8lle: Gav\u00e8lle: The word \"forget\" does not exist in my dictionary. Edgeworth: Then, it would be prudent for you to add this to your argument. Mr. Saint may have been the only person who could move around freely in the prison... But on the day of the murder, there was a gap in time missing from the surveillance records. During that time, anyone could have done as they pleased!

Mr. Edgeworth, are you serious about your statement?Laguarde:Oh ho ho, how amusing. The very thought of a warden committing a murder. It sounds like something out of a mystery novel!Gav\u00e8lle:Precisely. Your reasoning is in contempt!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Nothing of the sort. I did not want to believe it myself, but... Based on the evidence, I have no choice but to believe it. This evidence proves that Warden Laguarde is the murderer...Present Crime Scene NotesEdgeworth:Leads to:\"The smell gave you away.\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:This proves you are the murderer.Laguarde:Treating me like a criminal just because of that is so cruel! That doesn't even have anything to do with me!Edgeworth:Nnghoooh! (That wasn't it. Missile's reaction to Warden Laguarde earlier... What was the cause of it...? I need to let that guide me to the answer!)Laguarde:I suppose your accusation was nothing more than a joke in poor taste after all.Edgeworth:No, it was not, Warden Laguarde! You are the murderer!Laguarde:Then why don't you show us the evidence?Leads back to:\"This evidence proves that Warden Laguarde is the murderer...\"Edgeworth:The smell gave you away. As you can plainly see, someone has taken notice.Gav\u00e8lle:This police dog...?Edgeworth:He tracked a sweet smell that came from the body. And right now, he is telling us that the same scent is also on Warden Laguarde.Laguarde:Hu hu hu! You're a cruel one to accuse me of murder based on something like that! Right, Verity-darling?Gav\u00e8lle:.........Edgeworth:It appears that Judge Gav\u00e8lle has reached the same conclusion as I have.Gav\u00e8lle:...Mr. Edgeworth, this couldn't have been just a coincidence, could it?Edgeworth:The key to the breaker room and the same scent on the body... If it were only one, it could have been seen as such.Gav\u00e8lle:It appears... we have reached a conclusion. We should now listen to what the warden has to say.Edgeworth:Indeed. Until we do... ...we cannot close this case!Laguarde:Oh my goodness. Everyone with such scary faces. So I'm the only one who could have been the murderer? That just cannot be...-- Why I Can't Be the Killer? --Laguarde:I heard all about the case from Verity-darling here.Had I committed the murder, it would've taken place inside the holding cell.But I couldn't have moved the body. I never went into the prison.I was caught up in my work. Up until the show, I was stuck in my office.Check up on it if you like. You'll find there's no record of me entering the prison.Laguarde:I don't know what reasoning you had, but I can say for sure... ...I cannot be the killer.Gumshoe:But Missile barked at you, pal! You've gotta be the culprit!Laguarde:Oh heavens, it's not possible... I already told you, I never went to the prison. If you think I'm lying, why don't you check the records.Edgeworth:(She wants us to check the records? She does seem confident. For now, all we can do is listen to her and try to draw out more information.)Laguarde:I do hope you understand, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: From Judge Gav\u00e8lle? Are you two... close? Laguarde: As close as fish and water. Are you jealous? Edgeworth: J... J-Jealous...? Gav\u00e8lle: On the first day of the investigation, she filled us in on the situation. In exchange for our cooperation, she explained the details of the case to us. Laguarde: How could you say that! You're so mean, Verity-darling! Gav\u00e8lle: Hmhmm. The truth is the truth. I believe it should be told as such. Edgeworth: (F-For some reason... Those two seem kind of... Scary...!)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The murder occurred inside the cell? How can you be so certain about that? Laguarde: Well, everywhere else would be under surveillance, right? And the victim's blood was found there too. Edgeworth: (That blood was actually from when he was struck by Elbird, but... ...I don't think it's necessary to inform her of this fact.) That doesn't mean it's proven, you do know that? Laguarde: But I see no contradictions in assuming the crime scene was at the detention center.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You never went into the prison? Do you have proof of this? Laguarde: My, my. Can't you wait for me to finish?Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You were in your office the whole time...? Nothing strange happened? Laguarde: Nope, nothing at all. Edgeworth: Were you looking for something? Laguarde: I'm not too good at tidying up. I always forget where I put everything... The other day, I even lost track of an important piece of evidence. Edgeworth: (H-How could you have made such a grave error!?) Laguarde: If someone were to take something from me, I wouldn't even notice it the entire year. Edgeworth: (Hmm... I guess it will be hard to attack with the key to the breaker room.) Laguarde: On the day of the incident, I was working in my office, and searching for lost items. In other words, I couldn't have gone to the prison, even if I had wanted to.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You did not enter the prison from the entrance. But, what if there was another route? Laguarde: Oh my, are you suggesting something like a secret passage? I don't know if anything like that exists. Edgeworth: It is my firm belief you did possess an alternate route. That route was neither the entrance nor a secret passage... The route you used was from here...! Present Courtyard Edgeworth: Leads to: \"The barbed wire fence...?\" Present anywhere else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You moved through here to enter the prison! Laguarde: Oh my. Now how would I have got to the prison from there? Mr. Edgeworth, you yourself said that I used neither the entrance nor a secret passage. Edgeworth: Urgh! (This wasn't the right route... To get to the prison from the warden's office without using the entrance or tunnel... The only way possible is by going through that place!)

First, let's listen carefully and gather information.Gav\u00e8lle:The barbed wire fence...?Edgeworth:You would have moved Knightley to your office first. This office leads directly to the garden side of the courtyard. If you had moved through here, and passed the barbed wire fence... ...you would have arrived at the prison without passing through the entrance or a tunnel!Laguarde:Hu hu hu! I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth is saying? Haven't you noticed? There's a high-voltage current running through the fence...Debeste:Yeah! Obviously she couldn't have passed through it like that!Edgeworth:The current to the fence could be switched off at the breaker room. And you were the only one who had the key, Warden Laguarde!Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:Most amusing. However, the breaker room is located on the prison side of the courtyard. How would the warden have accessed it from the detention center?Laguarde:...Ah, quite right. Gotcha there, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:Ngh. That's...Gav\u00e8lle:If there is no record of her passing through the prison entrance... ...it would not have been possible for her to turn off the fence's breaker.Edgeworth:(Ngh...! But, Warden Laguarde was the only one who had access...)Ray:Don't let this faze you, Miles.Edgeworth:But, if I don't have a solution for this, she'll get away!Ray:Now, Uncle Ray never said, \"don't think\", you know... It's just not good to be so stubborn about it. That's all.Edgeworth:(But, no matter how you think about it, Warden Laguarde couldn't have done this alone.

(What made it possible to turn off the breaker...!)Her position as the wardenEdgeworth:Her position as the warden made it possible!Laguarde:So I was able to use the breaker from the detention center, because I am the warden? In that case, I'd have to be not just a warden, but a psychic as well!Edgeworth:Mmph! (That wasn't right... It would be difficult for Warden Laguarde to use the breaker alone... Which means!)Gav\u00e8lle:It was indeed impossible for the warden to have used the breaker.Edgeworth:No, there was one way she could have done it!Leads back to:\"(What made it possible to turn off the breaker...!)\"She had an accompliceLeads to:\"It was indeed impossible for one person.

I am disappointed in you, Prosecutor Edgeworth.Gumshoe:What's that, pal!? You making fun of Mr. Edgeworth?Gav\u00e8lle:...The inmates at this prison all wear bracelets.Kay:If they try and go where they please, they will set off the alarm... Aah!Gav\u00e8lle:So you've noticed. This is a prison after all. Not only the prisoners, but the guards too, are under constant scrutiny.Edgeworth:(So why didn't everyone notice Elbird...?)Gav\u00e8lle:The only ones allowed to move around freely are the animals... ...and they certainly could not have used the breaker.Edgeworth:But, it's still possible that a person did it.Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:Excluding the inmates and the guards, just what kind of person would you say it was?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:We can't exclude the inmates and guards just yet! There was only one person. One whose movement was not restricted. This evidence shows that there was someone in the prison who could move around freely!Present Sahwit's BraceletEdgeworth:Leads to:\"That is...? It looks like the bracelet worn by the prisoners.\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:This evidence points to the existence of that person.Gav\u00e8lle:Well then, I'd like you to explain just who this points to.Edgeworth:.........Kay:Mr. Edgeworth, why aren't you saying anything?Gav\u00e8lle:It seems he doesn't know, after all.Edgeworth:Nnghoooh! (She saw through me...)Kay:Someone whose movement wasn't restricted... Wasn't there someone who tried to hide that from us?Edgeworth:Indeed. And we must find the evidence that implicates them!Gav\u00e8lle:It would seem that the warden's supposed accomplice does not exist after all.Edgeworth:No, Judge Gav\u00e8lle. There remains one person.Leads back to:\"This evidence proves that Warden Laguarde is the murderer...\"Gav\u00e8lle:That is...? It looks like the bracelet worn by the prisoners.Edgeworth:This belongs to a certain \"model inmate\". ...And it's broken.Gav\u00e8lle:What... Just who on earth does this belong to!?Edgeworth:Frank Sahwit. The warden's favorite inmate.Laguarde:...!Edgeworth:Don't you think it's strange? He managed to keep this hidden while he moved around freely in his daily prison life.Ray:Golly. When you think about it, it shouldn't be possible.Laguarde:.......Edgeworth:I'd hazard a guess that this was because he was a special case. Just like Bodhidharma Kanis in the special cell...Gav\u00e8lle:Gav\u00e8lle:The prosecutor's statement is mere conjecture!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Hmph. You could find out by simply asking Sahwit himself. It is my firm belief that Mr. Sahwit and Warden Laguarde were partners in crime! Due to their collaboration, another route surfaces. The real route by which Knightley's body was moved to the prison! There were two obstacles that needed to be dealt with. The security camera in front of Knightley's cell. And, the electric fence in the courtyard. Both these problems could have been solved with a single stroke. By having Sahwit switch off the breakers in the breaker room!Laguarde:Mr. Edgeworth. Could you wait one moment?Edgeworth:Do you still intend to deny it, Warden Laguarde?Laguarde:*sigh*... I give in. I confess.Gav\u00e8lle:Warden Laguarde... No! This cannot be!Laguarde:Yes, it's just as he says. Frank Sahwit and I were partners in crime.Debeste:No way...Kay:You did it, Mr. Edgeworth!Ray:Well done, Miles. At last, we have the real culprit cornered.Laguarde:Like Mr. Edgeworth said, Franky operated the breaker. But... we were not responsible for Knightley's murder.Edgeworth:WH-WHAT!Gav\u00e8lle:Warden Laguarde. Whatever do you mean?Laguarde:Judge Gav\u00e8lle. Would the Goddess of Law hear my confession?Gav\u00e8lle:The Goddess of Law is merciful. She will absolve you.Laguarde:I was... being threatened. That's why, I had no choice but to do as I was told.Kay:So, who was threatening you!?Laguarde:.....Bodhidharma Kanis! That assassin!Edgeworth:(Kanis...?)Laguarde:It's been going on since that man came to the prison. I will never forget that day. When we were both alone, he suddenly said to me:Kanis:I have many dogs outside the prison.Laguarde:D... Dogs?Kanis:Loyal dogs who obey my every command.Laguarde:I soon realized that what Kanis referred to were not really dogs. But his human henchmen... And, that's not all he said.Kanis:You'd better watch how you treat me. If you don't want you and your family to become dog food.Laguarde:I had no choice. I gave him the special cell. I gave him anything he desired.Edgeworth:Anything he desired... You don't mean! The Supplier...!Laguarde:That's right. Anything he ordered, I would deliver to him. ...An underground dealership. I was the one who won over Franky. It was simple, I just offered him special privileges within the prison.Gav\u00e8lle:And these underground dealings?Laguarde:Once a week, in the middle of the night, Franky would shut off two of the breakers... ...so I could move from my office to the courtyard without being seen by the security camera. I would go past the fence, and drop the goods down the well near the prison. And then I'd sprinkle this perfume over it...Edgeworth:So that's the true identity of the sweet scent...Laguarde:The scent of perfume was a signal for Kanis's dog. After picking up the scent, it would carry the goods to Kanis. Of course, this had to be done while Elbird was away from his cell.Gumshoe:I'm surprised he never found out about it, pal.Laguarde:We have a strict timetable here at the prison. Meal time, exercise time... It's easy to know when he's away from his cell. And since little Rocky is afraid of Kanis's dog... I didn't have to worry about him making noise.Edgeworth:(So, having full knowledge of the prison's inner workings, she made the deliveries herself. This would have ensured there were no slip-ups.)Laguarde:Franky would turn the breakers back on in the early morning, and the delivery was complete. I then modified the timestamp on the security camera.Gav\u00e8lle:You have told us a great deal. The Goddess of Law accepts your penitent confession.Laguarde:As the warden of the prison, how could I have done such a foolish thing? The day Knightley was killed was also a delivery day. It seems Franky was working the breakers as usual. But, that day I had nothing to send. So I did not go to the courtyard at all.Edgeworth:(The secret of the supply system... So then Warden Laguarde was...)Laguarde:The police have been searching for Kanis's henchmen for ages. I've also been helping them, but...Laguarde:I've been interrogating him personally in my office. But... ...no matter how much evidence we have on him, we can't get a single word out of him.Edgeworth:So the reason you kept on interrogating him...Laguarde:Yes. It was to find his henchmen. I borrowed all the evidence from the police, and carried out the interrogation myself! I kept an eye on all his actions, and examined all of his mail!Edgeworth:(Mail... like his correspondence chess letters.)Laguarde:But I could never uncover the true identity of his henchmen... This fear... It's something you could never understand.Gav\u00e8lle:Prosecutor Edgeworth. You were listening, right? I'd say this confession clears the warden of all suspicion. Is it really necessary to press her further than this?Edgeworth:(Is it necessary to press her further?)Press furtherLeads to:\"Judge Gav\u00e8lle. My questioning isn't over yet.\"There is no need for thatEdgeworth:Indeed, there is no need to question Warden Laguarde any further.Kay:Mr. Edgeworth! Are you just gonna let the warden get away like that!? She's the killer, right!?Gumshoe:It's not like you to overlook a culprit in plain sight, sir!Edgeworth:Mmph... Right. (There is still some suspicion surrounding the warden... We must press her further!)Leads to:\"Judge Gav\u00e8lle. My questioning isn't over yet.\"Edgeworth:Judge Gav\u00e8lle. My questioning isn't over yet. I'm sure the Goddess of Law isn't satisfied yet, either.Gav\u00e8lle:You mean to badger this woman further?Edgeworth:Even if she was threatened by Kanis... ...this does not prove she was not the culprit in this case. She was able to use the supply route... ...to transport Knightley's body!Gav\u00e8lle:Do you have any evidence to support this?Edgeworth:The body gave off a sweet scent... The scent of perfume that was used to signify a delivery! Can you explain this fact?Laguarde:Oh... Of course... Since I have made so many deliveries, the scent would've lingered around the well. When the body was moved through the well, the scent would have transferred to it.Gav\u00e8lle:Mr. Elbird also testified to this fact.Elbird:That's it. For some reason, that well gave off a nice scent.Edgeworth:A nice scent?Elbird:I don't know what it was, but it smelled sweet, like candy...Gav\u00e8lle:The lingering scent in the well would, of course, be picked up by anything passing through.Edgeworth:Ngh.....!Gav\u00e8lle:The Defense rests, I see. In that case, court is adjourned.Kay:Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't there anything we can do?Edgeworth:(What should I do? Is this as far as I can go?)Debeste:Is it over already?Gav\u00e8lle:Yes, Sebastian. It is. And now, court is officially adjourned!Gav\u00e8lle:Who... Who was that?Ray:It's not nice of you to adjourn things just like that, Gav\u00e8lle-pie.Edgeworth:Mr. Shields...!Gav\u00e8lle:Are you objecting to the court adjourning?Ray:He he he. Of course not. I ain't got no \"Objection\", or anything like that. Go ahead and adjourn court. Do whatever you like.Kay:Hey, what are you doing Mr. Shields!?Ray:Woah there. Calm down Kay. Who wants some chocolate?Gav\u00e8lle:...Is this a joke?Ray:He he he, you'll have to excuse me. I just have one tiny request to make. As Simeon Saint' attorney.Gav\u00e8lle:That's right, you're the defense attorney in charge of this case, aren't you?Ray:Exactly! Did you all forget? That's so mean.Kay:But you just left everything to Mr. Edgeworth and didn't do anything at all!Ray:Yes. That's right! That's why... I thought I'd do my job a bit.Gav\u00e8lle:Do your job? ...That hardly sounds like you at all.Ray:It's to prepare for the trial. I'd like to ask the warden a few questions.Gav\u00e8lle:Surely you jest. What more would you expect to hear from her?Ray:Well, Ms. Warden. I'd like to hear your thoughts on the culprit.Laguarde:My thoughts?Ray:Uncle Ray believes that Simeon is not the culprit. It seems that Ms. Warden also suspects someone other than Simeon. I'd like to hear you out.Laguarde:........Kay:Mr. Edgeworth. What's Mr. Shields up to?Edgeworth:...He's trying to lure Warden Laguarde into testifying. Why was the supply route used to transport the body...? I'd say it was to pin the crime on Kanis.Kay:Ah! I see!Edgeworth:If he committed a murder here, he would be transferred to another prison. One with tighter security...Kay:And that would get rid of the troublemaker!Edgeworth:Exactly. She wouldn't pass up a chance like that...!Debeste:Hey, hold on a sec! A culprit besides Simeon? What do you mean! Simeon was the one I was supposed to prosecute!Ray:Exactly! So wouldn't it be better if Debeste also listened to what she has to say?Kay:Amazing, Mr. Shields. You managed to drag Mr. Debeste into this too!Gav\u00e8lle:.....Warden Laguarde, is this acceptable?Laguarde:........ Oh, you! It's fine! It's fine! You understand a woman's heart!Ray:Th-Thank you... Mademoiselle.Laguarde:Actually, I've thought this over. I'd like to tell you my thoughts. You'll let me speak, won't you, Verity-darling?Gav\u00e8lle:...Of course. You may speak.Kay:Mr. Shields! Awesome!Ray:Phew, that was a close shave.Edgeworth:Thank you, Mr. Shields.Ray:No, no, I'm still leaving the rest to you. Remember what I said? A defense attorney never gives up... The fate of our client rests on our shoulders, after all. It'd be uncool if Uncle Ray didn't put that into practice. Now then, Miles. It's your turn to show you'll never give up.Edgeworth:Right...Laguarde:Well then, will you listen to my story?-- My Story --Laguarde:I believe that the culprit in this case could only have been Kanis.I have no idea what transpired between Kanis and the victim.It simply could have been that Kanis was displeased with him.In any case, he was the one who stabbed the victim to death.He probably had a dog dispose of the body. This is the truth of the case.Laguarde:The victim... Mr. Knightley, was it? I think it is a truly terrible thing.Edgeworth:Taking a man's life, you mean?Laguarde:...That's how you'd go about saying it, isn't it? If only I had been more vigilant, his death would not have happened. That's why I want to clear up his regrets!Gav\u00e8lle:Warden Laguarde...! How considerate! I'm sure Mr. Knightley in Heaven is overflowing with gratitude!Edgeworth:(Is gratitude really what Knightley feels?)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You seem very confident of that. How can you be so sure? Laguarde: The children of this home are all good little boys and girls. Believe in yourself, believe in your friends, and believe in me and the guards... There is no way any of these hard-working children could have committed a murder. Edgeworth: Quite an emotional reason. (Makes sense, coming from someone like her.) Laguarde: Only Kanis would be capable of something like that.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Knightley was being held in the detention center, and Kanis was in the prison. They couldn't make any contact. Don't you think that would've prevented trouble? Laguarde: The prison is quite confined, right? There were many ways for them to meet. Edgeworth: Knightley was murdered days before he would have been sentenced to prison. Surely there weren't \"many ways\" a meeting could have occurred? Laguarde: Even without a direct meeting, Kanis can still cause trouble. Mark my words.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What could Knightley have done in the detention center to \"displease\" him? Laguarde: That was just an example. You don't have to take it so seriously. Didn't I already say that I have no idea what transpired between them? Nevertheless.. You certainly are a serious one, Edgeworth-dear. Edgeworth: (Wh-What's this? That... piercing gaze...?) Laguarde: Always standing straight and stiff. Very nice! Looking very clever, my dear! I think I'm about to become your biggest fan! Edgeworth: Ngh...! Kay: M-Mr. Edgeworth, stay focused! It's just a flesh wound! Edgeworth: R... Right. (Is this some form of psychological warfare...?)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd like to hear your thoughts about the circumstances surrounding the murder. Laguarde: Well, I suppose it was a simple \"job\". During his booking, I learned that the victim had some kind of injury to his neck. He couldn't turn his neck to the right... I remember him saying something like that. Edgeworth: (Booking... that's the process one undergoes before being locked up in the detention center.) It sounds like you don't really know a lot about Knightley. Laguarde: I only know a little. In any case, he would've been an easy target for Kanis. Perhaps he used the chisel hidden in the chessboard? The victim wouldn't even have had a chance to scream. Edgeworth: ...I see. Your opinion will be a very valuable reference. ...Could you add those last statements to your testimony? Laguarde: Aww, you're making me blush. You're so c-u-t-e. Edgeworth: .....! Laguarde: I'm just kidding. I'll continue. Add statements: \"Perhaps he used the chisel hidden in the chessboard?\" and \"I'm sure it would have been a simple \"job\".\"Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The chessboard...? Laguarde: The thing that the victim brought with him. It seemed like he really enjoyed playing chess. How could I have guessed that chisel would be hidden inside it? Edgeworth: (The chisel in the chessboard... That fact is only known by a select few people! This was the answer we arrived at from our reasoning, after all. So then, why does she know about this...?) Laguarde: In Kanis's hands, even a chisel is enough to be used as a lethal weapon.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You certainly seem to hold strong feelings towards Kanis. Laguarde: Th-That's... just natural. Remember my interrogations? That man, no matter how much evidence we find, he's still as slippery as a snake...! Ray: You've got a lotta guts! Laguarde: That smug look he has on his face when he returns to his cell! Aaaaaargh! Just thinking about it makes my stomach churn! Edgeworth: (I can sort of understand how you feel.)xEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you mean to say the dog threw the body into the well? Laguarde: Kanis has more than one dog, not just that black one, you know. Didn't I tell you? He has henchmen outside these walls as well. Edgeworth: You mean his henchmen outside of the prison aided him in this crime!? Laguarde: Of course not. They would have been caught by the security gates. But, think about it. Wasn't he the \"Supplier\"? It's not hard to think he had \"dogs\" within the prison too. Edgeworth: Oh? Well then, why don't you tell me the names of those so-called dogs? Laguarde: If I knew that, I wouldn't have gone through so much trouble. In any case, it's still a possibility. Please try to consider it. Edgeworth: (She's dodging the question... Can't I pursue this line of thought any further?)Edgeworth: (Warden Laguarde's testimony is covered in lies. If I pick them apart one by one, her true colors will surely be revealed.)",

The chessboard wasn't something Knightley brought with him. It was brought to him later by Mr. Saint. He didn't even have it when he arrived here!Laguarde:Th-That's...! M-My mistake. I meant the parcel check...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Even if we assume that, there are still many suspicious points! Why wasn't such a chisel immediately confiscated!Laguarde:A-Aiiaaah!Edgeworth:Judge Gav\u00e8lle. Did you tell anyone about the trick to this chessboard?Gav\u00e8lle:...I did not.Laguarde:.........Edgeworth:If no information about our investigation was leaked, then how did you find out? You could not have examined this during the entrance check or parcel check!Gav\u00e8lle:Certainly... Someone in the warden's position would never have let a chisel slip by.Edgeworth:Exactly. So, answer this, Warden Laguarde! When and how did you learn about the chessboard's secret!Laguarde:.........Edgeworth:Hmph. In that case, I shall answer for you. It is because...Laguarde:I give up, Edgeworth-dear. It is as you say.Edgeworth:(Hm...?)Laguarde:.....I interrogated Knightley. That's how I learned about... the chessboard. But... Please believe me! I didn't kill anyone!Gav\u00e8lle:Enough. It would appear that we have uncovered some vital information. I'll ask you to testify once more. If that's airtight with you, Prosecutor Edgeworth.Edgeworth:...No objections here.Laguarde:Th-Thank you, Edgeworth-dear! I'll do my best!Gav\u00e8lle:Well then, Warden Laguarde, I trust there will be no lies from here on out.Edgeworth:(Her pool of lies is slowly running dry. Soon I will bring out her true nature!)-- My Story, Pt. 2 --Laguarde:I wouldn't go so far as to call it an interrogation.I always make sure to talk to all the new arrivals.Mr. Knightley... Yes, we had a little chat.After our talk, he went right back to his cell, I assure you.Edgeworth:(She's piling lies on top of lies, not realizing that it only tightens the noose around her neck.)Gav\u00e8lle:You speak with the new prisoners, you say?Laguarde:That's right! I'm glad you understand.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Your testimony is not solid evidence. It requires more than just \"understanding\"!Gav\u00e8lle:Well then, Prosecutor Edgeworth, you may begin your cross-examination.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're certain you interrogated him the day before the show? Laguarde: Yes. Around 3 AM on the 27th. Edgeworth: (3 at night. That matches the time of death on Knightley's autopsy report...) You summoned him that late at night and he wasn't asleep? Laguarde: Well, a guard was attacked in Knightley's cell, remember? After that incident, we checked his cell and inquired about the circumstances... I'm sure all that excitement made it hard to sleep. Knightley was wide awake, you know. Edgeworth: So, even though it was highly irregular, you still carried out this late-night interrogation. Laguarde: Edgeworth-dear... You're so mean. Edgeworth: Ngh...! Laguarde: It may have been irregular, but the truth is I had him moved. You can call it what you like, it still doesn't change the facts. Ray: Please excuse him. I'll give my incompetent apprentice a good scolding later! But for now, Mademoiselle, what did you mean when you said, \"you had him moved\"? Laguarde: I thought it was obvious, Monsieur. I spoke to him in my office. Edgeworth: (Her office... The route she used to move Knightley's body!) Please add that statement to your testimony! Laguarde: ...Uh hu hu. Of course. Add statement: \"Around 3 AM the day before the show, the victim was brought into my office.\"Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And where is your office located exactly? Laguarde: You know that sign in the detention center hallway? Kay: You mean the one that says \"No Entry\"? Laguarde: Yes. It's just a short walk up that aisle. About five minutes from the cell block. Edgeworth: I've heard that room exits into the courtyard. Laguarde: Of course. That side of the courtyard is my private garden. ...Oh, I get it. You're going to say I used that route to move the body. Edgeworth: Indeed, you must have been able to use it. If you used that route... Gav\u00e8lle: Gav\u00e8lle: For now, that is merely a possibility. There is no decisive evidence to support it. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But there is no other way the body could have been moved! Gav\u00e8lle: Gav\u00e8lle: Surely you haven't forgotten my theory that Simeon Saint dropped the body in the well? Debeste: That's right! That's right! What she said! Edgeworth: Ngh... (Pursuing this point further would be hazardous.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What did you talk about? Laguarde: What indeed... It was just trifling conversation. What kind of animals he liked, what his hobbies were, that sort of thing. Edgeworth: Hobbies... I assume he mentioned chess? Laguarde: Oh yes. That's all Knightley would ever talk about. Now that I think about it, the note he had in his room... It probably had something to do with chess too. Edgeworth: (So Warden Laguarde saw Knightley's note...?)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And what was Knightley like during the interrogation? Laguarde: He was very honest. Kay: M-Mr. Kn-Knightley was... Gumshoe: H-Honest, pal!? Laguarde: He also talked about a croissant and some kind of promo... Edgeworth: (En passant and chess piece promotions, I presume. Looks like he was his usual chess-loving self.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If he really returned to his cell, there is no way he would be a corpse now! Laguarde: I know you're suggesting that I killed him during the interrogation, but... ...I couldn't possibly have had a motive to kill Knightley, could I? Kanis was the only one I hated. And he had no connection with the victim. Edgeworth: (She only hated Kanis...) Please add that statement to your testimony! Add statement: \"Kanis was the one I hated. And he had no connection with the victim.\"Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The only one you hated was Kanis... Am I correct? Laguarde: Yes. Threatening me... And doing whatever he wants in this prison! That man... I will never forgive him! I will do whatever it takes to corner him! And his black dog too! They aren't fit to live in my home! Edgeworth: (She's brimming with hostility, even towards Kanis's dog... At first glance, it would seem she has no motive for killing Knightley... However, her hostility extends to anyone connected to Kanis. If I consider that, the answer will naturally follow!)Gumshoe: She chats with the criminals...? The warden sure is easygoing, sir.Edgeworth: Easygoing? She killed one of the criminals, you know.Ray: Since the guy was handcuffed, it would have been a pretty one-sided affair.Edgeworth: (Warden Laguarde has to be the killer. I have faith in my reasoning so far!)",

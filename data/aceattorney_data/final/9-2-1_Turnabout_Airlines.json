Thinking back, everything began on that fateful day, two days ago...)-- 2 Days Earlier --Edgeworth:(Yes, everything began high up in the air, 9,000 feet in the air, to be precise...)PA Notice:Thank you for flying GoYou (changed from [iFly] in the original release) Airlines. We are currently experiencing some slight turbulence. We are asking all passengers to please return to their seats and fasten their seatbelts.March 12, 6:13 AMFlight G-390 (changed from [I-390] in the original release), First Floor - LoungeEdgeworth:...Nnngh... ...Why do I feel like I just woke up from a horrible nightmare? (6:13, huh... Guess I was out cold for about 10 minutes. Hah, \"slight\" turbulence, indeed.)PA Notice:Ladies and gentlemen, we are currently experiencing some slight turbulence. For your safety, we ask that you return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.Edgeworth:(I suppose turbulence is to be expected on a flight. Though admittedly, I'm less than comfortable with anything resembling earthquakes... Hm? What's this...? A travel wallet? But it's not mine... How did someone else's travel wallet wind up in my pocket...? Nnngh...! My head... Why won't this headache go away...? I'll take care of this travel wallet later. Or hand it off to an attendant...) Unngh... From earthquake-like turbulence to an elevator... ............ Hmph. What am I doing hesitating like this? (Actually, I know full well why I hesitate. It was when I was still but a young child... I was caught up in a murder that happened in an elevator. But how long am I going to let my past haunt me!? It's just an elevator! I'm a grown man now! I need to behave like one!) Wh......What the...!? What in the world happened!????:Is there something wrong, sir? I must ask that you please return to your se... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! He... He-He-He's DEAD!!!Edgeworth:Please calm down! We mustn't jump to conclusions without all the facts...Passenger:What's wrong!? Did something happen!????:Y... Y-You MURDERER!!!Edgeworth:Wh--!? N-NO! You have it all wrong! It wasn't me!!March 12, 6:41 AMFlight G-390 (changed from [I-390] in the original release), Second Floor - First ClassExamine evidenceProsecutor's BadgeFront of badgeEdgeworth:This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.Back of badgeEdgeworth:Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!???:Everyone, I am sorry to interrupt, but I have an important announcement.Teneiro:I am one of your flight attendants today, Rhoda Teneiro. Unfortunately, we have just had a minor accident on this flight.Passenger:An \"accident\"!? Don't treat us like we're stupid! I caught a glimpse and it was a murder!Passenger:What!? M-Murder!? What's going on with this flight!?Teneiro:Everyone, please calm down. There's no reason to panic. This flight will stay on course and make its scheduled landing. We are still currently in the middle of a rough patch of turbulence. So until we are out of this area of turbulence, I ask that you please remain seated...Passenger:B-B-But, someone was killed, right!? I mean, what about the killer!? Let me off...!Teneiro:Please, there is no need to feel threatened. We have already apprehended the culprit.Edgeworth:I ask that everyone please remain calm.Passenger:What the heck is he talking about!? Why should we remain calm!?Edgeworth:My name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a prosecutor and I assure you I am not the killer.Passenger:Hah! Being a prosecutor doesn't make you incapable of murder, buddy!Edgeworth:Now you listen here! I am not the killer! I simply found the body!Teneiro:So you say, however... ...I am sure that you are the perpetrator of this crime. I swear on my honor as a professional flight attendant.Edgeworth:Oh, is that right?Teneiro:I know what I saw. And there's even very strong, incriminating evidence to back me up.Edgeworth:(What kind of \"incriminating evidence\" is she talking about...?)Teneiro:We've already alerted the proper authorities at our destination. Until we land, you will remain in our custody by the powers vested in our captain. I'm very sorry, but please understand our situation.Edgeworth:(Your situation? I'm more concerned with mine, and the direction it's going in... I'm not about to just sit idly by while I get accused of murder!) Ms... Teneiro, is it?Teneiro:Yes?Edgeworth:I was wondering if you might give me a chance.Teneiro:A chance? To do what?Edgeworth:A chance to plead my case. And a chance to ask what you meant by \"incriminating evidence\" just now.Teneiro:.........Edgeworth:To accuse a passenger of such a grave crime without allowing him to give a proper defense... Can the professional flight attendant inside of you really call this action \"righteous\"?Teneiro:......... You have a point. Very well, I'll listen to what you have to say... ...but be wary of what you reveal. I'm afraid you'll only look even more suspicious if your explanation fails to satisfy. I also do not have the time to deal with you all day, so please make it quick.Edgeworth:...... Of course. As you wish.Teneiro:Good. Very well then, let's get started.Edgeworth:(I know for a fact that I didn't kill that man in the elevator. What I don't know is what sort of \"evidence\" she has up her sleeve... ...but I'm certain it doesn't fit with how the crime really occurred.)Testimony-- What Ms. Teneiro Saw --Teneiro:I swear to tell the whole truth as a professional flight attendant.Unfortunately for you, Mr. Edgeworth, I am certain you are the killer.The scene I saw in front of the elevator......it was you, standing there, with fresh blood dripping off of the murder weapon.So, if you would please cooperate, we'll turn you over just as soon as we land.Edgeworth:(That's it...? That's her evidence...!?)Teneiro:I don't think you could ask for a more perfect witness testimony. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:(Not really. It's hardly perfect when there's a gaping hole in it.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Tell me, what exactly puts the \"pro\" in \"professional flight attendant\" for you? Teneiro: Well, it means we are very professional about how we take care of our passengers. Services like fetching papers and responding to calls are done with speed and accuracy. I can assure you that I give testimonies with the same level of professionalism. But I'm sure you have already realized that by now, right!? Edgeworth: (It's a bit hard to \"appreciate\" your professionalism when I'm the one under suspicion.) Teneiro: And there you have it. My professional testimony is accurate and reliable.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You certainly seem sure of yourself. Teneiro: Of course! A professional flight attendant can't afford to make mistakes, after all. Edgeworth: Perhaps. But you must admit there are few who can look at a murder with a clear mind. Teneiro: We attendants all go through extensive training and are always calm and collected. We'll even calmly serve you coffee, if you so wish, as the plane makes a splashdown. Edgeworth: (I fail to see how that would be the calm and rational thing to do in an emergency.) Teneiro: Even until the bitter end, we are there to serve the passengers. That is the duty of all professional flight attendants! Edgeworth: You certainly are confident. Anyway, shall we return to your testimony?Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Yes...? What did you see in front of the elevator? Teneiro: That's what I was just about to tell you, Mr. Edgeworth. Framed by the elevator doors and bathed in the light coming from within...Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The murder weapon, dripping with blood...? Really, now. Teneiro: I swear that was the grisly scene I saw before me. Thank goodness it wasn't a passenger who saw, or there'd be widespread panic by now. Edgeworth: As I recall, you were quite panicked yourself at the time... Teneiro: ............ Excuse me? Edgeworth: You were scared enough to misread the situation and accuse me of murder. Teneiro: Nonsense! Professional flight attendants cannot afford to be that flustered! I witnessed the murder scene and am now listening to your defense, all with a smile. Edgeworth: (Apparently, you also lie with a smile on your face.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I am not the culprit... And yet, you would keep these restraints on me? Teneiro: Mr. Edgeworth, please try to understand what kind of situation you're in right now. Edgeworth: And what exactly is my situation? Teneiro: I have the backing of the captain to keep you bound in this way. We are within our legal right to restrain anyone who might threaten our captain mid-flight. In essence, you're in the same situation as someone who has been arrested by the police. Edgeworth: (So I am to stay restrained until I can clear up all of her doubts? At least I'm close.)Edgeworth: (Her mistake shines like the silver lining on a dark rain cloud. And I'm going to capture some of that light with evidence!)",

But I... ...I don't understand any of it. There's another attendant on this flight who...???:I said that he is giving the runabout!Edgeworth:!???:I don't require an interpreter! I speak English just well! See! You, the attendant!Teneiro:Y-Yes, sir!???:I want this person to be under the arrest until we arrive at the airport!Edgeworth:......Teneiro:......Edgeworth:I'm sorry, sir, but what exactly are you hoping for????:What is it you want? I am finished talking to the likes of you.Edgeworth:Please, I would like to hear why you would like me to be held under arrest until we land!???:You! How dare you try to waste my time!?Edgeworth:(You were the one who stuck your nose into my affairs!)???:I wanted to spend even at least one more second with my precious art! I have no time for other things! I know what you are! I see through you! Insolvent! Yes, I am pretty sure that's how you say it in English!Edgeworth:(Well, I should hope I'm not monetarily bankrupt (changed from [I'd hope that I don't dissolve in water] in the original release, correcting a mistake where Edgeworth defines insoluble instead of insolvent), but I don't think that's what you meant.) I'm sorry, but I don't think I caught your name.Lablanc:I am Zinc Lablanc II. I am a very wealthy man in the Borginia! But I am not an ordinary rich man! I am an art dealer... a rich seller of beauty!Teneiro:Mr. Lablanc, what did you mean just now?Lablanc:Pardon!?Teneiro:Um, when you said that Mr. Edgeworth was giving me the \"runabout\"?Lablanc:I have to explain!? Unbelievable... I will say it once and only once. I do not have even a second to waste! \"Time is money\" as they say!Edgeworth:(Yes, and yet you continue to blather on...)Lablanc:I saw it, yes I did. I saw the victim go onto the elevator. Going down to the lounge! It was exactly at 6 o'clock!Edgeworth:......Teneiro:...... A-And what's the significance of that time...?Edgeworth:(At 6, he says.........) W-Wait, you saw him at 6!?!?Teneiro:Aaaah! Wh-What's the matter, Mr. Edgeworth!?Lablanc:He understands, I see. Ms. Attendant! What time did you discover the body!?Teneiro:Well, it was a little after that patch of turbulence, so I would say around 6:15... Ah!Lablanc:\"Hicks\" was his name, was it? Then I say that man Hicks was killed in the 15 minute time span. And the only person in the lounge at that time was this prosecutor, yes?Edgeworth:.........Passenger:Y-Yeah! I-I was in my seat the whole time!Passenger:M-Me, too! I was watching the movie and enjoying a fine glass of grape juice!Passenger:I was still eating! Still haven't finished, see!Lablanc:The other passengers have an alibi, so you have no problem with them, I suppose?Edgeworth:.........Lablanc:\"No compliant\", I see. Not a single word against this, right!?Edgeworth:...I have no way of discounting what you have put forth at this point, but it wasn't me.Lablanc:Oh!? So you say! But do you have, what you say, the evidence?Teneiro:Mr. Edgeworth... Are you really the culprit after all...?Edgeworth:Mr. Lablanc. I suppose you are quite certain in what you saw? Enough to give testimony? .........Lablanc:Of course! I was looking at that man the whole time! He was playing with that annoying little... um... small \"machine\" the whole time!Edgeworth:\"Machine\"...?Lablanc:Yes, that's what you people call it in English, yes? It was making me crazy with the click, click, click!Edgeworth:(From that description, it sounds like some sort of small computer...)Teneiro:I believe what Mr. Lablanc is talking about is a cell phone. I have to say that I did see him playing with it quite a bit, myself.Edgeworth:(A simple cell phone? A laptop or organizer I can see, but... That's kind of... low budget.)Lablanc:I hate that noisy little machine in his hand! Not a fragment of beauty! All it produces is ugly sounds! Anyway, I know what I saw!Edgeworth:Ms. Teneiro.Teneiro:Yes?Edgeworth:I was wondering if I might be granted permission to examine the crime scene.Teneiro:What!? You want to... examine the crime scene?Edgeworth:If you would grant me a little measure of time, I'm sure I can produce the real culprit.Lablanc:Hmph. I don't like the sound of that. \"Fox in the duck pen.\" Yes, I think that is how you say it in English.Edgeworth:It's \"Fox guarding the henhouse.\" And I believe my innocence was proven earlier. And if I'm given the chance, I can clear up all the remaining doubts.Teneiro:.........Edgeworth:Ms. Teneiro! If you wait until we arrive... ...there is a good chance that some evidence will have been destroyed by then.Teneiro:......... ...I understand. Let me see what the captain has to say.Lablanc:Hah! This should not be approved!Teneiro:Please, Mr. Lablanc! In an emergency, all decisions are to be made by the captain alone. Now, please wait here while I go ask the captain what to do. I'll be right back.Lablanc:You are not planning to erase evidence when you are doing your investigation, yes?Edgeworth:Of course not!Lablanc:Hah, we will see!Teneiro:Mr. Edgeworth, you have the captain's permission to investigate the crime scene.Lablanc:Wh-What!? Unbelievable!!!Edgeworth:I am in your debt, Ms. Teneiro.Teneiro:However... there is one condition. I am to supervise you. Can you agree to that?Edgeworth:Of course, I see no problem with that stipulation. It's only natural as I am still a suspect in this case.Lablanc:Grrrrrr...Teneiro:I take full responsibility and will watch Mr. Edgeworth's every move. I hope this is reassurance enough that there will be no foul play. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, shall we proceed? If you should need my help with anything, please feel free to use [X / Y / triangle / T] to talk (changed from [touch the Partner Button] in the original release).Edgeworth:(It's time to head to the scene of the crime... the first floor lounge.)TalkAttendant in front of doorEdgeworth:Excuse me, but may I have a word with you????:............Edgeworth:You there!???:............*yawn* ...If you need something, please ask Ms. Rhoda over there, OK?Edgeworth:What the...? Hey! Wake up, you!Teneiro:I'm terribly sorry that she's being so rude, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:No need for you to apologize. I just find it hard to believe she's asleep on the job! (If I were her boss, I'd see to it that her salary was cut so low that it was in the red.)Zinc LablancLablanc:Hurry up and investigate!

D-Don't get-t-t-t near m-m-m-me... y-you criminal!Teneiro:He said, \"Don't get near me, you criminal!\"Edgeworth:I am not the killer, and I intend to prove that starting now.Passenger:B-B-But th-that's c-c-contrary to th-the f-f-facts!Teneiro:He says, \"But that's contrary to the facts!\"Edgeworth:...I can understand his English just fine, thank you very much.Passenger in green suitPassenger:Hey, miss... How about another glass...?Edgeworth:Excuse me, but I was wondering if you know anything about the murder...Passenger:...How about it? How about a glass together?Edgeworth:Um, sorry, but I must decline.Passenger:I wasn't talking to you! I was asking the cute attendant!Teneiro:I'm sorry, but I'm on the clock right now. But if you need a refill, I'd be happy to bring you another glass at any time.Passenger:You got it, toots!Edgeworth:(Th-That's no way to talk to a lady!)Passenger eating steakEdgeworth:If I may have a word with you...Passenger:This...*munch*...steak... *munch* *munch* so... *munch*...awesome...*munch*Edgeworth:That's great to hear, however, I would like to ask you a few questions...Passenger:I...*munch*...was... here... *munch* *munch*... whole time so...*munch* wouldn't know...Edgeworth:Eat or speak.

You can't go there in mid-flight.Edgeworth:What's the probability that the criminal escaped through here?Teneiro:A hundred percent.Edgeworth:!Teneiro:............ Oh! Let me finish my thought. I'm 100% certain they didn't.Edgeworth:(When I'm searching for an answer, only complete thoughts need apply.)Serving trayTeneiro:How did you find your meal to be, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:Come to think of it, I forgot all about it. I must have been asleep or something.Teneiro:Oh! I'm terribly sorry! Let me prepare you something right away!Edgeworth:...What are you apologizing for, Ms. Teneiro?Teneiro:I've failed in my professional duties by letting a passenger go hungry! Please, help yourself! If you see anything to your fancy, feel free!Edgeworth:Ah, I think I'll take my time later, after I've solved this case. Thanks.Elevator buttonTeneiro:In order to preserve the crime scene, I'm afraid the elevator is not in service. To get to the first floor lounge, we should take the stairs.Vase on seatEdgeworth:Mr. Lablanc seems to be protecting the gargantuan vase on the chair rather closely.Teneiro:It's a marvelous vase, though, isn't it? Yes, I dare say so as a professional attendant.Edgeworth:I don't think there's any real connection between a piece of art and being an attendant...Teneiro:But I'm not just any old attendant! I'm a PROFESSIONAL flight attendant.Edgeworth:(As though there were such a thing as an amateur flight attendant.)Movie posterEdgeworth:It's a movie poster for... \"License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder\"...Teneiro:That's a GoYou (changed from [an iFly] in the original release) Airlines sponsored movie. It's a suspense-hardboiled-action-romantic-horror-comedy flick (changed from [movie] in the original release).Edgeworth:...Is that the genre listing for this thing (changed from [movie] in the original release)?Teneiro:Yes. It's a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone because it encompasses all those genres!Edgeworth:...I can't even begin to imagine what the plot would be (changed from [of this movie would be like] in the original release).Teneiro:But you have to admit it has piqued your curiosity, right? I heard the main strategy with this genre listing was to make people curious.Edgeworth:.........Well then, consider the mission a successful one.Seat next to movie posterEdgeworth:This was Mr. Hicks's seat. I don't see the \"machine\" Mr. Lablanc was talking about...Teneiro:Perhaps it's in the elevator?Edgeworth:Maybe. We should probably head down to the crime scene now.Edgeworth's seatEdgeworth:It's my seat. Unfortunately, I didn't bring anything particularly useful for an investigation. (It's not as if I'm constantly prepared for such a thing to occur...)ChessboardEdgeworth:Ah, that's right. I was in the middle of recreating a chess game.Teneiro:Just an observation, but aren't there too many red knights around that lone blue pawn?Edgeworth:...Nonsense. It simply shows that the blue pawn is no match for the red knights' might.LifesaverEdgeworth:What's a lifesaver doing here...?Passenger:I-I-I bought it a-at the in-f-f-flight shop just be-beyond the lounge! If-If something sh-should happen, having o-o-one will s-save your life!Edgeworth:(I think this guy would've been better off not taking a plane to begin with.)BottlesEdgeworth:Look at all these bottles, lined up in a row. It's a miracle they made it through the turbulence without a scratch...Teneiro:Actually, we asked the drink vendor to clean up all the ones that did break earlier.Edgeworth:Then you mean to tell me he put all these up here after the turbulence...?Teneiro:We are simply thrilled to have someone so interested in the variety of drinks available!Edgeworth:(I don't think anyone should drink this much. There is such a thing as over-hydration...)ParfaitEdgeworth:One very large parfait... though I could easily finish it off all by myself.Teneiro:This parfait is a GoYou original: the GoYou Parfait (changed from [an iFly original: the iFly Parfait] in the original release)! The \"Go\" comes from \"Gorgeous\", while the \"You\" part comes from \"Yogurt\" (changed from [\"i\" comes from \"I love you\", while the \"Fly\" part comes from \"Flying\"] in the original release). When you combine the two parts, you get \"GoYou\" (changed from [\"iFly\"] in the original release)!Edgeworth:(Except there's no \"you\" in \"yogurt\"...? (changed from [I fail to see how the \"i\" came from \"I love you\"...!] in the original release))PartnerTeneiro:Are you in need of assistance?TalkCaptain's permissionEdgeworth:Ms. Teneiro, I'd like to ask you about investigating the lounge...Teneiro:As long as you have the captain's permission, I can't stop you from looking around.Edgeworth:If you could pass a message along, tell him I'm grateful for his spirit of cooperation.Teneiro:I will. However, please realize that you are still under suspicion. To be honest, I still have my doubts about you.Edgeworth:Of course, and I take no offense.Teneiro:Do you really understand what I'm saying?Edgeworth:Yes, verily.Teneiro:Do you pinky-swear you do, on your honor as a professional prosecutor?Edgeworth:I-I pinky-swear I do, on my honor as a professional prosecutor.Teneiro:Well! I guess that settles that.Edgeworth:(I... I feel my honor as a man slowly diminishing.)PresentAnythingTeneiro:Even if you show that to me, I still cannot allow you free reign. I'm sorry, but I must admit that I still have my doubts about you.Edgeworth:(Guilty until proven innocent, I see...)March 12, 7:26 AMFlight G-390 (changed from [I-390] in the original release), First Floor - LoungeEdgeworth:I want to thank you for your help back there, Ms. Teneiro.Teneiro:It was nothing. You should thank the captain for granting you permission. And just so everything is perfectly clear... I still don't trust you (changed from [trust you to that extent] in the original release). Your standing with me hasn't changed one iota (changed from [I don't want you to think your standing with me has changed] in the original release).Edgeworth:I see. I will bear that in mind.Teneiro:I received an order from the captain earlier. He wanted you to know that... ...we reserve the right to stop your investigation if we feel you are not making progress. And when we do, he asks that you please return to your seat at that time.Edgeworth:(So my time runs out at his and his crew's discretion, does it? I have to find a way to discredit Mr. Lablanc's testimony before time's up!) I understand. By the way, is there any place you can think of where the killer might hide onboard?Teneiro:I don't think so. After every First Class passenger was accounted for at his or her seat... ...we made a thorough search of the plane. As for Business and Economy class... ...no one can move between those two classes and First Class without a staff keycard. And we found no record of a keycard being used at all.Edgeworth:(Which means that I have a First Class Killer on my hands. At least I know that much for sure. And one other thing. No one else has been allowed near this crime scene since the murder was discovered either.)Begin InvestigationFirst Floor LoungeEdgeworth:Now then, let's get started.Teneiro:But where would we start from?Edgeworth:Hmm... Let's start with Mr. Lablanc's statements. The crime occurred between 6 AM and 6:15 AM. During that interval, the only person in the lounge was myself. Which would make me the prime suspect. However, since I did not kill Mr. Hicks, it means that the killer was around somewhere (Where was the killer? \u2013 What clues point to where the killer could have been?)...Teneiro:If we are to believe what you say is true, then yes.Edgeworth:Hmm... The first order of business will be to gather information to win your trust.ExamineBlue doorTeneiro:This door leads to the flight attendants' room. But please understand that it's off limits to unauthorized personnel.Edgeworth:(The room is giving off the scent of women's perfume. One would think that perfume would \"smell great\", however, to me it simply \"smells\"... Not that I have any interest in what lies behind this door...)Teneiro:Perhaps we should return to the investigation, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:Hm...........................Teneiro:Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:Sorry, I spaced out for a second there.GlassesEdgeworth:(These bottles and glasses must have been broken by the turbulence.) There is quite a bit of broken glass here. Please be careful when passing through the area.Teneiro:Thank you very much for the warning, Mr. Edgeworth. However, no matter how kind you are towards me... ...know that it does not clear up any suspicions I have about you.Edgeworth:I-I wasn't warning you for the sake of clearing my name!!PianoTeneiro:This grand piano is the pride of this plane. It can play the music of whatever CD we insert into its CD drive.Edgeworth:That's not a piano! It's more like an overgrown music box.Teneiro:Ah, but its keys depress along with the music, as though there really is someone playing it.Edgeworth:(Some people have entirely too much money to waste on overly-complex toys.)WindowsEdgeworth:(These counter windows offer a glimpse of the sky, but these clouds, they tell me nothing...)Teneiro:Mr. Edgeworth...? You... look like you're talking to the clouds.Edgeworth:Is that so? Then tell me, what do you suppose I said to them?Teneiro:I don't know, but it looked like a rather one-sided conversation.Edgeworth:(The clouds... They tell me nothing.)Magazine rackEdgeworth:There are a few copies of Sky Magazine in the magazine rack.Teneiro:This month's special is an English trivia quiz.Edgeworth:That's not a bad idea. I've heard that the youth of today don't know a particle from a participle.Teneiro:Now, now, Please don't go around confusing people with made-up words, Mr. Edgeworth. Who's ever heard of such a silly word as \"participle\"?Edgeworth:(Case in point...)Statue to left of elevatorEdgeworth:What, or who, is this...?Teneiro:This is a bronze statue of the founder of GoYou Airlines, Mr. Ugo Hughes (changed from [iFly Airlines, Mr. Hugo Ifly] in the original release). The one on the left is of when he was in his 40's and the other is of him in his 80's.Edgeworth:(...Did the man age at all over those four decades (changed from [actually age in the span of four decades] in the original release)? Maybe I need to squint more.)Crime scene in elevatorEdgeworth:What floors does this elevator service?Teneiro:Only the first and second, although, it can also go down to the cargo hold. However, that requires a flight crew keycard.Edgeworth:(So the only floors accessible to passengers are the first and second (Elevator - The victim's body was found inside the elevator that connects 1F with 2F.), huh? I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)ExamineMoneyEdgeworth:Money is strewn all over the floor of the elevator. I would guess it was all in Mr. Hicks's wallet at some point.ShoesEdgeworth:There's no grape juice residue on the soles of his shoes... ...making it highly unlikely that Mr. Hicks entered this elevator after the turbulence.Body or bloodstainEdgeworth:I doubt anyone was expecting to find a dead body in an elevator on this flight.Teneiro:So Mr. Hicks... He's really d-dead?Edgeworth:Yes. (She's trembling, although I can't fault her for that when there's a corpse right there.)Teneiro:Mr. Hicks... If you're really dead, then please answer, \"yes\"...Edgeworth:(I see she's over the trembling now... although a new symptom seems to have appeared... Anyway, I should focus on the victim's body. Let's see...) There's blood on the back of Mr. Hicks's head... Could this be the cause of death? He appears to have been struck (Blunt force trauma - Wound on the back of Hicks's head suggests blunt force trauma, but what caused it?) very hard... Even his glasses (Broken glasses - The victim's glasses are broken. Were they broken during his murder?) are broken...LanyardEdgeworth:(I wonder what was hanging off of this lanyard? Something's missing from this picture... Now if I could just put my finger on it...)Lanyard (after correctly deducing lanyard)Edgeworth:The \"machine\" that should be hanging off of here must still be somewhere on this plane!PocketEdgeworth:(Hm? There's something sticking out of his pocket. Hope he won't mind if I take a look at what's inside.) .........Hm? It's a picture. It looks like it was taken inside a building somewhere.Photo of Mr. Hicks data jotted down in my Organizer.Pocket (subsequent times)Edgeworth:(Hm? There's something sticking out of his pocket. Hope he won't mind if I take a look at what's inside.) .........Hm? It's a picture. It looks like it was taken inside a building somewhere.FigureEdgeworth:What is this... sinister-looking figure on the floor here?Teneiro:Oh, that's a piggy bank of our company mascot, Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release). It's just one of the many pieces of merchandise we sell at our in-flight shop. This bank is a limited edition, and is so popular that we're down to our last one.Edgeworth:You have an in-flight shop...?Teneiro:Yes. It's just beyond the lounge to the right. The shutter to the store is closed at the moment... ...but it was open the whole flight up until Mr. Hicks's body was discovered.Edgeworth:(There's blood on here... Could this have been the murder weapon (Murder weapon: Capt. Ugo - The blood on it is still fresh... Could this be the murder weapon?)?)Deduce lanyard (after examining pocket)Edgeworth:(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)Present Photo of Mr. HicksEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Mr. Hicks's 'machine' is nowhere to be found.\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:This crime scene completely contradicts this piece of evidence!Teneiro:............ I'm sorry, but where?Edgeworth:Ah, I see the truth here in my mind's eye. I'll try to explain it in a simpler fashion for you.Teneiro:Um, alright...Edgeworth:(There's something missing from this scene in front of me. And I'll show Ms. Teneiro what's \"off\" through that piece of evidence!)Leads back to examination of crime sceneEdgeworth:Mr. Hicks's \"machine\" is nowhere to be found.Teneiro:His \"machine\"...?Edgeworth:Ahem, his cell phone, Ms. Teneiro.Teneiro:Ah, so I guess because it's not here...Edgeworth:Yes, I think we can safely deduce that the killer took it.Missing Cell Phone data jotted down in my Organizer.Crime scene in elevator (subsequent times)Edgeworth:(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)Crime scene in elevator (after examining body and figure, and correctly deducing lanyard)Edgeworth:(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)Pool of juice stain near elevatorEdgeworth:There's some spilled grape juice in front of the elevator. (I assume it was spilled during the turbulence.)Teneiro:Oh, we must clean that up or someone might get hurt...Edgeworth:Aha!Teneiro:? What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:I've found some very important evidence. What is the important piece of evidence in this scene?Present footprintsEdgeworth:Leads to:\"What is it...?\"Present line marksEdgeworth:Edgeworth:These lines here... They obviously weren't made naturally.Teneiro:You're right! But how were they made then, and why are they here?Edgeworth:I don't know yet... (But I do know they are important to this investigation.) Aha!Teneiro:What is it now, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:I've found an even more important piece of evidence in this scene!Leads back to:\"What is the important piece of evidence in this scene?\"Present anywhere elseEdgeworth:Teneiro:............ I'm not sure what's so important about that, Mr. Edgeworth...Edgeworth:N-No, wait! (Curses. This is no time to get careless!) Allow me to point it out to you one more time.Leads back to:\"What is the important piece of evidence in this scene?\"Teneiro:What is it...?Edgeworth:They're a little smudged, but I think we can both agree they are a set of footprints (Spilled grape juice \u2013 There is some spilled grape juice on the floor in front of the elevator.).Teneiro:So you think...Edgeworth:Yes, these belong to our killer.Teneiro:Oh, then maybe we should check the shoe sizes of everyone in First Class!Edgeworth:I don't think that will be of any help to us. Unfortunately, the prints are too smudged, which will make it hard to get a definitive match.Teneiro:Oh, I see...Pool of juice stain near elevator (subsequent times)Edgeworth:Spilled grape juice in a pool at my feet... Unfortunately, the delightful scent of grapes is obscured... ...by the unpleasant smell of the crime scene.Teneiro:This scent in the air... It's the same smell as the smell of my towels after they come out of my home dryer.Edgeworth:I-I would've never expected something like that by looking at you... (I suppose everyone has something unpleasant about them...)Statue to right of elevatorEdgeworth:A pity that a bronze statue knows not when good drink has been spilt at its feet.Teneiro:This is a statue of our founder, Mr. Ugo Hughes (changed from [Hugo Ifly] in the original release), who was a big fan of grape juice. I'm sure he would be thrilled if he knew so much grape juice was here at his feet.Edgeworth:(Is that a hint of hero worshipping I detect...?)Chair on ground next to tableEdgeworth:(This toppled-over chair... Yet another victim of the turbulence.)Teneiro:Aaaaah!! Nooo! Look at all that grape juice staining the back...! It may not look it, but this chair was extremely valuable.Edgeworth:It was?Teneiro:Yes! It was used when the Rocker Pals came to tour this plane. The Rocker Pals' leader sat in this very chair.Edgeworth:I'm sorry, but what are these \"Rocker Pals\"?Teneiro:I can't believe you've never heard of them! They're all the rage! The Rocker Pals are an extremely popular international band. They added the \"Pals\" part as they became more popular, especially among teens.Edgeworth:Ah, that explains it. I'm not really one for the music of today. (Maybe I should ask Detective Gumshoe about them later... On second thought... I can already see how confusing the conversation would get.)TableEdgeworth:Glasses and candles thrown into disarray by the turbulence.Teneiro:It's been a while since I've seen this big of a mess. It's terribly embarrassing, but I thought it was an earthquake for a second... ...and I frantically started searching for gas valves to shut off.Edgeworth:(I guess the shaking of the plane was bad enough to be mistaken for a real earthquake. Not that I would know, since I was unconscious for most of it...)ShuttersTeneiro:The in-flight shop is just beyond these shutters. But we don't have permission to open them, so I'm afraid I must leave them closed.Edgeworth:(There must still be clues to be found here in this lounge! I must remain ever vigilant.)LogicConnect \"Murder weapon: Capt. Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release)\" and \"Blunt force trauma\"Edgeworth:A statue with blood on it lying next to the body of a man who was beaten to death...Teneiro:Oh! Mr. Edgeworth! I think I figured something out!Edgeworth:Y-Yes? What is it?Teneiro:The way the blood is on this, it looks like it matches up with the wound on his head!Edgeworth:(Well, aren't we deserving of the Master of the Obvious title...)Teneiro:Well? What do you think, Mr. Edgeworth? Don't you think that's worth investigating?Edgeworth:Hmm... It would appear that this figurine is our murder weapon.Teneiro:Oh, I just knew it! I mean, I can't think of any other connection!Edgeworth:(Hmm, perhaps Master of the Oblivious would be more befitting...)Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy Bank data jotted down in my Organizer.Connect \"Where was the killer?\" and \"Elevator\"Edgeworth:(True, there wasn't anyone else in the lounge other than myself right before the turbulence... ...but if the killer was in the elevator along with the victim (In the elevator with Hicks? - If only I could prove that the killer rode the elevator with Hicks...), then that's a different story.)Connect \"In the elevator with Hicks?\" and \"Spilled grape juice\"Edgeworth:I have it!Teneiro:? I'm sorry, but I don't understand, Mr. Edgeworth...Edgeworth:I can prove that someone other than myself was here around the time of the murder.Teneiro:What!? R-Really!?Edgeworth:Yes. It's rather simple, actually. The proof is in the pudding. Or rather, the grape juice in this case. These footsteps here confess to me this very fact... ...that someone exited the elevator, alive. Seeing as how the victim is dead, that would mean a second person.Teneiro:But... couldn't the footprints be from Mr. Hicks himself?Edgeworth:Ah, but if you take a look at our victim's shoes, you can see the soles are spotless.Teneiro:Which means...Edgeworth:...Mr. Hicks wasn't alone in the elevator. In fact, it's quite the opposite. There was actually one other person inside the elevator!Grape Juice Footprints data jotted down in my Organizer.PartnerTalkNotice anything? (appears after examining pool of juice stain near elevator and presenting footprints) (this Talk option disappears after connecting \"In the elevator with Hicks?\" and \"Spilled grape juice\" Logic)Edgeworth:Did you notice anything?Teneiro:I was wondering whose footprints those are next to the elevator.Edgeworth:I'd say the killer's, wouldn't you say? Even if they aren't, I'm sure they are a vital clue to solving this case.Teneiro:Ooh, maybe there are other clues waiting to be found in other places. Come on now, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go find them together.Edgeworth:(A word of advice: nobody likes a credit thief, so stop stealing my lines.)About the victim (appears after examining body and figure)Edgeworth:I was wondering if you noticed anything, Ms. Teneiro.Teneiro:Yes... I can't help but notice the sad atmosphere in here.Edgeworth:Um, hmm, yes... It is a rather tragic crime.Teneiro:I'll say. Robbing the poor man after bludgeoning him to death, talk about rubbing in the salt! I can't forgive someone who would do this to a passenger of mine! I swear as a professional flight attendant that I will capture the culprit with my own hands!Edgeworth:And I promise as a prosecutor to solve this case with logic and deduction. (I should go over all the leads I've collected so far one more time. The key to solving this lies at the intersection of my logic and the evidence.)PresentGrape Juice FootprintsEdgeworth:If these footprints do, in fact, belong to the culprit... ..then I would say it was very careless to leave them.Teneiro:If I was [sic] a killer, I swear that as a professional killer, I'd never leave footprints behind!Edgeworth:That's all well and good, but I'm afraid it's of little use in our pursuit of the killer. (I feel like I'm still missing a link or two...)Examine evidenceCaptain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy BankLabelEdgeworth:It says \"GoYou (changed from [iFly] in the original release) Airlines\". You know, I've seen it occur a lot recently, and it's been bothering me greatly... ...but why do some brands think it's acceptable to simply smash two words together and call it a day (changed from [does nobody know how to properly capitalize and space nouns anymore] in the original release)!?Coin slitEdgeworth:I suppose this is where you insert your coins. I have to say, for a piggy bank, it's made rather well. So well, in fact, that I'm not sure there is a way to take your money out...BloodstainEdgeworth:There is some blood on one of the corners. Could this piggy bank be the murder weapon?After connecting all possible Logic and correctly deducing lanyard:Investigation CompleteEdgeworth:(Hm? What's going on over there?)Lablanc:[Borginese speaking]! [Borginese speaking]!???:[Borginese speaking]... [Borginese speaking]...Lablanc:Unforgivable!

I will not talk to you anymore! You are just wasting my time!Teneiro:What is the matter, Mr. Lablanc? If there is no emergency, please return to your seat, sir.Lablanc:Do not tell me what to do! I need not to sit down! Well, Mr. Prosecutor!? Did you prove you are innocent yet!?Edgeworth:If you would like, I will prove my innocence to you right now.Lablanc:What!? Nonsense! Are you saying my eye-witness testimony is mistaken!?Edgeworth:Not mistaken, merely that there is room for doubt. I'd be most honored if you could please tell me what you saw in detail once more.Lablanc:Fine, suit yourself!Testimony-- What I Saw --Lablanc:I am certain I saw Mr. Hicks enter that elevator!It was when the needles on my pocket watch pointed to the 6 and the 12!The body was discovered 15 minutes after that in the lounge, yes?Then you, the only person in the lounge at that time, must be the criminal!Edgeworth:(Mr. Lablanc's conclusions seem to make logical sense. After all, the only person in the lounge at the supposed time of the murder was me...)Lablanc:So! My eye-witness testimony! If you think you can destroy it, then come, let me see! Hurry! Do I look like a man who is having the time to wait for you!?Edgeworth:(Why is HE so irritated? I'm the one accused of murder here! Anyway, I must find a way to discredit Mr. Lablanc's account somehow, and fast!)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Lablanc, were you able to get a good look at the inside of the elevator at that time? Lablanc: Of course, I saw what was inside. Edgeworth: And you are sure that the victim was in the elevator alone? Lablanc: Yes! The only person inside was that Mr. Hicks man! Edgeworth: (Hmm, this last outburst is a bit too important to let go...) Adds statement \"The only person inside was that Mr. Hicks man!\"Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was he really alone? Lablanc: Of course! I will bet even 1 cent! Edgeworth: (Hmph, a cheap ante... for a cheap testimony. But if that's how you want to play it, I'll happily take your 1 cent!)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I assume the pocket watch in this case is the one you keep checking, is that correct? Lablanc: Oh! You noticed! It is a very expensive antique, I will have you know! The feeling is wonderful when I fully wind it up by hand! Edgeworth: Hmm... It does look very well designed, and quite classy. Lablanc: ...I will have to charge you if you want to touch it! Edgeworth: ......That's quite alright! Let's continue with your testimony. Lablanc: Hmph! What a cheap man you are! Now return the time you wasted back to me! And if we must, I saw Mr. Hicks enter the elevator at 6 o'clock!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It's true that I found the victim's body at 6:15. Teneiro: And that's when I found the two of them as well. Lablanc: You see! It all matches my testimony!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That is the most mistaken way of thinking I've ever heard of! Lablanc: Lablanc: No, no, no! Your silly opinion is what is mistaken! Teneiro: Please calm down, the both of you. In a sense, you are both mistaken. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black, then I don't know what is.)Edgeworth: (He certainly has a lot of confidence in his testimony.

Lablanc: I am always upset! The only time I am not is when I have a piece of art in my hands! Edgeworth: (...It's surprisingly easy to believe that about him.) Lablanc: But I was even more upset when Mr. Hicks walked by me!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Why were you so attentive to the time? Lablanc: Because! Because something unforgivable was happening! Edgeworth: Hmm, come to think of it, you were yelling about something \"unforgivable\" earlier... Lablanc: I was giving a complaint to the attendant about the movie starting time! Return back to me my time!! In money!! ...You understand the point. Edgeworth: (Movie? Is he talking about the in-flight one that's mentioned in the magazine? Hmm... A summary of the plot and its (changed from [the] in the original release) start time... Interesting...) Lablanc: They were supposed to show \"License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder\". I cannot see that movie in my country. You can only see it on international flights. I looked forward greatly to that movie!! I checked my pocket watch whenever possible so I would not miss it! I even set my pocket watch to the destination time when I came onboard. So my watch is not wrong! It matched the schedule! But the movie was still late! Very, very late! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your pocket watch... I'd like to ask you a little more about it, if that's alright. Changes statement from \"I was always checking the time, over and over again.\" to \"The movie I wanted to see would not start, so I checked my pocket watch many times.\" Adds statement \"My watch is set to my destination's time. I always set it when I board the plane.\"Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So this movie you mentioned, is it the one listed in the Sky Magazine? Lablanc: Yes! I was so looking forward to watching \"License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder\"! Edgeworth: Ms. Teneiro, was this movie shown on this flight? Teneiro: Yes, it was shown at the scheduled time... Edgeworth: ......Isn't it possible you simply slept through it by accident? Lablanc: Nonsense! You doubt me!? Edgeworth: N-No! Now stop pointing at me like that! (Odd. How did he miss a movie that he was clearly hoping to see...?) Lablanc: I checked my pocket watch a great number of times! That much I know for sure!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're sure about what you just testified, Mr. Lablanc? Lablanc: Yes, of course! I am a very busy man! I am immediately busy when I land! I have many places to go! And no time to waste adjusting my pocket watch! Edgeworth: I see... That was a very valuable statement you just made. Lablanc: Hmph! Flatter me all you want, but you will not get 1 cent out of me! Edgeworth: Um... That's alright. All I require is this piece of testimony.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Since you only \"happened\" to see him, it's possible that you missed something in that glance! Lablanc: Lablanc: Even if I only \"happened\", I did not miss a thing! Edgeworth: And how can you be so sure? Lablanc: Just because! Edgeworth: I would appreciate it if you didn't take my life so lightly with a simple, \"Just because!\" Lablanc: Hmph! Well, then I was only making a joke! I saw Mr. Hicks, alright?Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Is it possible that someone was hiding inside? Lablanc: What!? You dare insult me!? I have belief in my eyesight! When I look for art to sell, I am told often I have \"great sight\" for the arts. Edgeworth: (I think the phrase you were looking for was \"great sense\", although that's debatable.) But isn't it possible someone was just outside of your line of sight...? Lablanc: You are persistent! I tell you, I looked clearly!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Why do you insist that you are absolutely not mistaken!? Lablanc: Because when I say I am not wrong, I am not wrong! Teneiro: Mr. Lablanc, if I may, I think beyond misconceptions and mistakes lies the truth. Edgeworth: (Funny, that suspiciously mirrors something I told her only a little while ago.)Edgeworth: (Mr. Lablanc doesn't seem to be lying... I may need to draw more information out of him before I see anything inconsistent.)Teneiro: I honestly don't think Mr. Lablanc is lying... Edgeworth: Hmm... I don't think he's lying either. But... I think he might be mistaken about something. Teneiro: Mistaken...? Edgeworth: Yes. And I'm going to correct his mistaken recollection with evidence. Teneiro: And this professional attendant shall witness the prowess of a professional prosecutor!",

The only time I am not is when I have a piece of art in my hands!Edgeworth:(...It's surprisingly easy to believe that about him.)Lablanc:But I was even more upset when Mr. Hicks walked by me!Lablanc:I was always checking the time, over and over again.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:Why were you so attentive to the time?Lablanc:Because! Because something unforgivable was happening!Edgeworth:Hmm, come to think of it, you were yelling about something \"unforgivable\" earlier...Lablanc:I was giving a complaint to the attendant about the movie starting time! Return back to me my time!! In money!! ...You understand the point.Edgeworth:(Movie? Is he talking about the in-flight one that's mentioned in the magazine? Hmm... A summary of the plot and its (changed from [the] in the original release) start time... Interesting...)Lablanc:They were supposed to show \"License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder\". I cannot see that movie in my country. You can only see it on international flights. I looked forward greatly to that movie!! I checked my pocket watch whenever possible so I would not miss it! I even set my pocket watch to the destination time when I came onboard. So my watch is not wrong! It matched the schedule! But the movie was still late! Very, very late!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Your pocket watch... I'd like to ask you a little more about it, if that's alright.Changes statement from \"I was always checking the time, over and over again.\" to \"The movie I wanted to see would not start, so I checked my pocket watch many times.\"Adds statement \"My watch is set to my destination's time. I always set it when I board the plane.\"Lablanc:The movie I wanted to see would not start, so I checked my pocket watch many times.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:So this movie you mentioned, is it the one listed in the Sky Magazine?Lablanc:Yes! I was so looking forward to watching \"License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder\"!Edgeworth:Ms. Teneiro, was this movie shown on this flight?Teneiro:Yes, it was shown at the scheduled time...Edgeworth:......Isn't it possible you simply slept through it by accident?Lablanc:Nonsense! You doubt me!?Edgeworth:N-No! Now stop pointing at me like that! (Odd. How did he miss a movie that he was clearly hoping to see...?)Lablanc:I checked my pocket watch a great number of times! That much I know for sure!Lablanc:My watch is set to my destination's time. I always set it when I board the plane.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:You're sure about what you just testified, Mr. Lablanc?Lablanc:Yes, of course! I am a very busy man! I am immediately busy when I land! I have many places to go! And no time to waste adjusting my pocket watch!Edgeworth:I see... That was a very valuable statement you just made.Lablanc:Hmph! Flatter me all you want, but you will not get 1 cent out of me!Edgeworth:Um... That's alright. All I require is this piece of testimony.Present Sky MagazineEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Mr. Lablanc, you said this just now in your testimony:\"Lablanc:I happened to follow that man with my eyes when he passed me.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:Since you only \"happened\" to see him, it's possible that you missed something in that glance!Lablanc:Lablanc:Even if I only \"happened\", I did not miss a thing!Edgeworth:And how can you be so sure?Lablanc:Just because!Edgeworth:I would appreciate it if you didn't take my life so lightly with a simple, \"Just because!\"Lablanc:Hmph! Well, then I was only making a joke! I saw Mr. Hicks, alright?Lablanc:And I saw clearly into the elevator he was entering.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:Is it possible that someone was hiding inside?Lablanc:What!? You dare insult me!? I have belief in my eyesight! When I look for art to sell, I am told often I have \"great sight\" for the arts.Edgeworth:(I think the phrase you were looking for was \"great sense\", although that's debatable.) But isn't it possible someone was just outside of your line of sight...?Lablanc:You are persistent! I tell you, I looked clearly!Lablanc:But, I swear there was no one else inside! No one!PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:Why do you insist that you are absolutely not mistaken!?Lablanc:Because when I say I am not wrong, I am not wrong!Teneiro:Mr. Lablanc, if I may, I think beyond misconceptions and mistakes lies the truth.Edgeworth:(Funny, that suspiciously mirrors something I told her only a little while ago.)Before pressing second statementEdgeworth: (Mr. Lablanc doesn't seem to be lying... I may need to draw more information out of him before I see anything inconsistent.)After pressing second statementTeneiro:I honestly don't think Mr. Lablanc is lying...Edgeworth:Hmm... I don't think he's lying either. But... I think he might be mistaken about something.Teneiro:Mistaken...?Edgeworth:Yes. And I'm going to correct his mistaken recollection with evidence.Teneiro:And this professional attendant shall witness the prowess of a professional prosecutor!Edgeworth:Mr. Lablanc, you said this just now in your testimony:Lablanc:I even set my pocket watch to the destination time when I came onboard.Edgeworth:Now, if your watch has been set to our destination's time zone... ...it would mean that your watch is displaying the time of our destination.Lablanc:Yes, and? The correct time is worth its 6 cents.Edgeworth:I would like you to take a look at this. If you believe this Sky Magazine... ...clocks on this flight run in accordance with the time of our departure time zone! Of course, the movie schedule was also created with that in mind. Ms. Teneiro, for confirmation's sake, what time zone is this flight aligned to right now?Teneiro:Well, we made a short stop at a transfer point.Edgeworth:(That's right. It was in that small Asian country, the Republic of Zheng Fa...)Teneiro:But we didn't re-adjust our onboard clocks at that time. So right now, we are still running on Borginian time!Lablanc:What!?Edgeworth:The time difference between Borginia and our destination is 9 hours. In that case, it's only natural that your watch would be out of sync with the schedule!Lablanc:Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?Edgeworth:Further, with your analog watch set to our destination's time... ...it would appear to be running 3 hours fast when compared to the flight's onboard clocks. It also changes everything about your testimony. And you can bet 1 million cents on that! In light of this information, it means you saw Mr. Hicks 3 hours prior at 3 AM!Lablanc:Nnnnn...ggggggwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! My 1 miiiiiiiiiiiiiiillion ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeents!!!Edgeworth:(This should clear up all of the remaining accusations...)Teneiro:So this basically widens the time frame for the time of death, right...?Edgeworth:Yes. Because Mr. Lablanc saw the victim enter the elevator at 3 AM... ...it means that the time of death could be anywhere from 3 to 6:15 AM. The question now is where was Mr. Hicks during that span of time and what was he doing????:Um, I've got something to say.Edgeworth:And you are...????:Yeah, um... Oh! I'm Cammy Meele. I'm a flight attendant.Edgeworth:And what is it you wish to say?Meele:Well, I think your story is a little different from how I remember it.Teneiro:What do you mean, Cammy?Meele:I saw Mr. Hicks sitting in his seat at 5 AM, you know.Edgeworth:What? How can you be so sure of the time?Teneiro:Oh, that's right! He pushed his call button while we were parked at the transfer point.Edgeworth:Ah, the stop we made for refueling and cargo transfer in Zheng Fa, correct?Teneiro:Yes, it was from 4 to 5 AM according to our clocks.Edgeworth:And during that time, did any of the passengers leave or did any new ones board this flight?Teneiro:No. Not a single person got off or on in Zheng Fa.Edgeworth:What about the flight crew?Teneiro:The few who were handling the cargo transfer might have temporarily gotten on or off... ...but eventually everyone, including Cammy and myself, came back on the plane.Edgeworth:(So basically, I can assume that no one left or got on since our initial take off. Interesting... I should keep that in mind.)Refueling in Zheng Fa data jotted down in my Organizer.Meele:Yeah, and I answered his call. I can tell you Mr. Akbey Hicks was there in his seat when we took off again at 5 AM.Ms. Meele's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.Edgeworth:Alright, then that puts the time of the murder between 5 and 6:15 AM.Meele:OK, now what time did you come down to the lounge, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:Hmm, I remember coming down here almost as soon as we left the Republic of Zheng Fa... Aaah!Lablanc:You! You were here the whole time from 5, yes!? Then you are the only one who could be the killer!Teneiro:Mr. Edgeworth... Were you really here in this lounge the entire time from 5 AM onwards?Edgeworth:Unfortunately, yes.Teneiro:But then, how do we explain the footprints?Lablanc:Is not that obvious!? This man waited for Mr. Hicks here in this lounge. Waited to kill him! And then he put the corpse into the elevator! That is when the turbulence happened! My eye-witness testimony may have been mistaken! But what time I saw Mr. Hicks enter the elevator on the second floor does not matter! Because the entire incident concluded here in this lounge!Edgeworth:(Everything happened in this lounge...?) Is that what you really believe, Mr. Lablanc?Lablanc:Wh...!? Do you have another idea!?Edgeworth:I simply feel that there is something out of place in the scenario you presented. (Is there something that can tie this crime to a location other than this lounge?)Present Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy BankEdgeworth:Leads to:\"The murder weapon...\"Present Grape Juice FootprintsEdgeworth:Edgeworth:These footprints. In which direction do you think these are headed?Teneiro:That would be... the in-flight shop.Edgeworth:Correct. They are headed in the direction of the shop.Lablanc:But they look disconnected! They end all of a sudden!Edgeworth:You are right to point out that they do not form one continuous trail to the shop. However, there is another piece of evidence that connects the shop to our crime scene. (Besides the footprints, what else points to the in-flight shop?)Present Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy BankEdgeworth:Leads to:\"The murder weapon...\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Lablanc:Hmph! I don't need to hear your wild desperation stories! \"Grasping for weeds\" I think is how you say it, yes!?Edgeworth:Agnrk...... I didn't mean to pull that piece out!

I don't need to hear your wild desperation stories! \"Grasping for weeds\" I think is how you say it, yes!?Edgeworth:Agnrk...... I didn't mean to pull that piece out! It was a simple slip of the hand, I assure you!Leads back to:\"Is there something that can tie this crime to a location other than this lounge?\"Edgeworth:The murder weapon... This little piggy bank is sold at the in-flight shop. It is sold there and only there, and is not displayed here in this lounge! How, then, did it find its way here? Don't you find that a tiny bit suspicious?Lablanc:Hmph! Such a trivial point! It only means you prepared it, taking it from the shop first before coming here. It doesn't prove you are innocent at all!Edgeworth:Nnnrrrgh......... (Is there no way to win with this man!?)???:Teneiro:I-If I may...!Lablanc:What is it!?Teneiro:Um... You see...! Well, it's just as Mr. Edgeworth says!Lablanc:Oh? And why do you know this so well?Teneiro:Well... It's just that... That piggy bank was there in the shop. I saw it with my own eyes.Edgeworth:And when was this?Teneiro:It was... maybe around 5:40 AM...?Edgeworth:...Isn't that just before we hit that patch of turbulence!?Teneiro:Th-That's right...Lablanc:You were in the shop just before the turbulence!?Teneiro:Um............ Yes, I was.Edgeworth:Come to think of it... Ms. Teneiro, when I found the body... ...I believe you came out of that door.Teneiro:Yes, I did...Edgeworth:And what is beyond that door?Teneiro:That's the flight attendants' room.Lablanc:Th-Then! You were on the first floor!?Teneiro:Yes... I had to do something at the shop and in the flight attendants' room. So I went to the shop first, and then to the flight attendants' room.Edgeworth:Are you saying you passed by me at some point?Teneiro:Yes. You seemed really into the issue of Sky Magazine you were reading at the time. I don't suppose you noticed me walking by...Edgeworth:(Hmm, I vaguely recall someone walking by, but I didn't take notice of who it was.)Teneiro:Anyway! The piggy bank was definitely there at the shop when I went there.Lablanc:Why did you go to the shop in the first place?Teneiro:I... went there for a work-related matter.Lablanc:Work, you say?Teneiro:Yes... The upkeep of the shop is also one of my responsibilities.Lablanc:Why did you not say anything about that until now is what I want to know.Teneiro:.........Edgeworth:In any case, I believe it's clear that the shop needs to be investigated as well.Teneiro:Shall we head over there, then????:Edgeworth:Wh-What is it now!?Meele:Aren't you forgetting something, Ms. Rhoda...? Don't you need the captain's permission to check the shop?Teneiro:No, I haven't forgotten. But I have already asked him for permission to search the entire plane. So I think we're alright.Meele:Huh...? That's weird...Edgeworth:What is?Meele:Well, I just talked to the captain, see... ...and he said that he didn't give you permission to do anything like that at all.Teneiro:!Edgeworth:What is the meaning of this, Ms. Teneiro!?Meele:It means she's lying. Go on, admit that you are. You said you had permission to search all over, but you don't. And yet, here you are!Teneiro:.........Lablanc:...You, flight attendant! Wh-What are you trying to do!? Pull the sheep over us!?Meele:The captain's calling for you, Ms. Rhoda. Oh, but don't worry... I already got permission to search the shop from the captain. See, unlike you, I do things the right way.Edgeworth:Ms. Teneiro... Why would you do such a thing?Teneiro:.........Please excuse me.Meele:Looks like I get to be in charge now. Please go back to your seat, Mr. Lablanc. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth... ...if you would follow me, I will be your guide from now on.Edgeworth:(There's something about Ms. Teneiro that has piqued my curiosity. But right now, investigating the in-flight shop is my top priority.)Approach stairs to second floorMeele:Um... Weren't we going to go to the in-flight shop?Edgeworth:Of course. I still fully intend to.Meele:OK, well, the shop is over there. Don't forget now.TalkCammy MeeleEdgeworth:Ms. Meele! About investigating the in-flight shop...Meele:............Edgeworth:You're of no use to me asleep! Wake up!Meele:*yawn* Huh? What's up?Edgeworth:I-I need you to come with me so I can search the shop...Meele:Go on ahead without me. *yawn* I'll catch up with you later.Edgeworth:(How has this woman not been fired yet?)Zinc LablancLablanc:Ooooooh, I am really mad! You had better hurry and bring to me some evidence!Edgeworth:If you could wait just a little longer while we look into the shop...Lablanc:Hmph! Don't number the birds before they are born!Edgeworth:(Don't number the... What...? I have no idea what he's trying to say. \"Don't count your chickens before they hatch\" perhaps...?) All I ask of you is your patience and cooperation.ExamineBlue doorMeele:Mr. Edgeworth! That's the attendants' room!Edgeworth:Ah, please excuse me. It was a simple mistake.Meele:You made a mistake, didn't you!? Why don't you just come out and say it?Edgeworth:That's exactly what I just said. I made a small mistake.Meele:............Edgeworth:Don't nod off while I'm talking!GlassesEdgeworth:(These bottles and glasses must have been broken by the turbulence.) There is quite a bit of broken glass here. Please be careful when passing through the area.Meele:............ Huh? Did you say something?Edgeworth:I said that there is glass here, and to be careful...Meele:............ But why?Edgeworth:(Obviously, common sense does not register, even as a blip, on this girl's radar!)PianoEdgeworth:(A piano... It's been a while since I played one of these. It might not be a bad idea to brush up a bit after all this time. Of course, that's contingent on the outcome of this case! It's time to get investigating!)WindowsEdgeworth:(These counter windows offer a glimpse of the sky, but these clouds, they tell me nothing... Ack! Now's not the time for me to stand here making up soliloquies! I should be hurrying to the shop and investigating!)Magazine rackEdgeworth:There are a few copies of Sky Magazine in the magazine rack. The special this month is an English trivia quiz. Of course, I have never uttered a single grammatically incorrect sentence in my life.Lablanc:What is it!? Why are you looking at me for? Hurry and go do your investigating! I do not believe in this \"making haste slowly\" saying you have in English!Statue to left of elevatorEdgeworth:There's something written on the pedestal... \"Here lies Ugo Hughes (changed from [Hugo Ifly] in the original release)\" ............? I don't think that's what they meant to write...Crime scene in elevatorMoneyEdgeworth:(There is money strewn all over the floor of the elevator. I guess this was all in Mr. Hicks's wallet before the incident...)BodyEdgeworth:I doubt anyone was expecting to find a dead body in an elevator on this flight. For the victim's sake, I will do anything in my power to bring this to a speedy end.BloodstainEdgeworth:There is blood on the back of Mr. Hicks's head... Could this be the cause of death? He appears to have been struck very hard...LanyardEdgeworth:The \"machine\" that should be hanging off of here must still be on this plane somewhere!PocketEdgeworth:It looks like there was just the one picture in this pocket.FigureEdgeworth:Captain Ugo (changed from [The Mr. Ifly] in the original release) here was probably used to hit the victim on the back of the head.Pool of juice stain near elevatorEdgeworth:Considering which way these prints are pointed, it's likely the killer went into the shop. I should really make my way over there now.Statue to right of elevatorEdgeworth:A pity that a bronze statue knows not when good drink has been spilt at its feet. Odd... Compared to the one on the left, this statue appears to be slouching a little. ...It must be the altitude. Yes, that's it.Chair on ground next to tableEdgeworth:(This toppled-over chair... Yet another victim of the turbulence.) There's something written on the back: \"In honor of Rocker Pals' Day\"...? I have the distinct impression that this chair has nothing to do with this case.TableEdgeworth:Glasses and candles thrown into disarray by the turbulence. Seeing this reminds me of the ferocity of that last patch. And of... ...No, I can't do this anymore. I've overcome that already. I won't let past traumas control me for the rest of my life.March 12, 8:32 AMFlight G-390 (changed from [I-390] in the original release), First Floor - In-Flight ShopEdgeworth:(So this is the in-flight shop...) It's quite a mess in here...Meele:You think? Guess I'll have to clean things up then, tee hee.Edgeworth:Hold on! You can't \"clean up\" a potential crime scene!Meele:Ohhh, thank goodness! I hate cleaning soooo much.Edgeworth:(I mustn't rush things here. I must remain cool, calm and collected. Because this piggy bank (Murder weapon: Capt. Ugo - The blood on it is still fresh... Could this be the murder weapon?) was left at the crime scene... ...there is a very good chance that the killer had paid this place a visit.)Begin InvestigationIn-Flight ShopTalkCammy MeeleMeele:I don't know much about this shop, but you can still ask me about whatever.TalkNotice anything?Edgeworth:So what do you think about what has happened regarding this case?Meele:Oh, I don't know. I guess I think you're the killer, though, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:I can assure you that I'm here in this shop to prove just the opposite...!Meele:Yeah, but it was me that got you the permission to look around, you know. So don't forget that, OK?Edgeworth:How am I supposed to thank you properly if you insist on falling asleep!?Meele:Well, you know what'd really show your thanks? You see that item for sale over there?Edgeworth:Sorry, but you're going to have to make do (changed from [make due] in the original release, correcting the typo) with my words of appreciation.PresentProsecutor's BadgeMeele:Ooh, I'd love to have this piece of jewelry. Can I have it?Edgeworth:N-No, you may not! This is a Prosecutor's Badge...Meele:Pooey. Then why did you show it to me?Edgeworth:I wanted to prove to you that I really am a prosecutor. And that it's not possible for a prosecutor like me to commit such a crime as...Meele:..................Edgeworth:(I see that I'm just wasting my time with Cousin Hair here.)Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy BankMeele:Ms. Rhoda said that this piggy bank was in this shop, right? Don't you find her a tiiiny bit suspicious?Edgeworth:I don't think I can say either way yet. There's not enough evidence to convince me that she was lying about anything back there.Meele:Are you sure about that...?Refueling in Zheng FaMeele:Like I said earlier... ...I was the one answering people's calls while we were refueling in Zheng Fa. And Mr. Hicks was in his seat at that time.Edgeworth:What time was that again?Meele:He called at around 5 AM. You were at your seat around then too, you know.Edgeworth:I do recall people calling for service at around that time. (Even if this turns out to be a waste of time, I must stand firm. I just know that there is a vital clue or two awaiting me here in this shop.)Anything elseMeele:So what is that? Are you going to give it to me? Oh, but I'm not supposed to accept any presents. ...Unless they're really worth something.ExamineFlowersEdgeworth:Beautiful flowers in a beautiful arrangement. (I feel cleansed just by looking at them...)Meele:Well, you're kinda stepping on a few of them, you know, Mr. Edgeworth (changed from [Mr. Edgeworth, you're getting pollen all over] in the original release).Edgeworth:Oh... Excuse me.SuitcasesEdgeworth:Wh-What are these...?Meele:Oh, those are our company's completely original line of suitcases! They're practically flying out the door! That's how popular they are! You should buy one and see how you like it! You won't regret it!Edgeworth:Perhaps that's how things work on this flight, but in the real world you try, then buy.Meele:No way! But either way, it doesn't really matter.Edgeworth:(True. Either way, why would anyone buy a suitcase AFTER they've boarded the plane?)Meele:Anyway, see that? Just look at all the Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) heads painted on there! Cute company mascot, isn't he!? They're painted on with a lot of care. Doesn't he look like he's about to jump out at you?Edgeworth:...It is certainly making something jump inside my stomach!Meele:Huh...? Oh, I guess there's no fooling your refined tastes!Edgeworth:?Meele:You looked like you really wanted to get one... ...and I thought I was going to finally make my first sale, but you saw right through it. Glad that's done though. Never make me try to give you a sales pitch ever again, OK?Edgeworth:But I never showed any interest in it to begin with!Meele:Tee hee! It really is pretty horrible, isn't it? You want to know something? This suitcase was designed by Ms. Rhoda!Edgeworth:Ms. Teneiro designed this?Meele:Yeah. It was a company-wide contest.Edgeworth:Um, well... It does have a very sharp design sense.Meele:Ha ha, \"sharp\"? Like stinky sharp cheddar, maybe. I really have no idea why the big wigs decided to go with it. It's so... bleh.Edgeworth:(Ms. Teneiro designed this, did she? ...It's definitely not what I would've expected...) Aaaaaaaaaah!Meele:You OK!?Edgeworth:I-I'm fine! Please watch yourself, Ms. Meele! (Letting a suitcase (Suitcase - Plane's shaking caused it to roll. In-flight suitcase displays can be hazardous.) freely roll around has got to be a safety violation...)Meele:Here, I'll put it back.Suitcases (subsequent times)Edgeworth:(Suitcases designed by Ms. Teneiro... That's one sharp design.)Left side of brown display caseEdgeworth:There is a wide selection of souvenirs for sale in these display cases.Meele:You know what I'd suggest...?Edgeworth:Sorry, but I have no intention of buying souvenirs on this trip.Meele:OK, then how about you buy something for me then? As a present!Edgeworth:I can't think of a single reason why I'd want to buy you anything.Meele:But I've had my eye on that pendant for such a loooong time.Edgeworth:Try paying some attention to me when I ask you something, and then we'll talk.Broken display caseEdgeworth:(The glass from this display case's door is shattered all over the floor. And it looks like there's nothing on display inside either. Hmm? Wait, actually, I think there is something... What's this...? A mini captain's hat (Tiny captain's hat - It's a tiny captain's hat...? Hmm... I swear I've seen one of these before...)...?)Stuffed toy display in lower right cornerEdgeworth:Stuffed toys, just like the one Ms. Meele is holding, are on display here. (They're relatively cheap, which explains why they're displayed so haphazardly...)Meele:How about it, Mr. Edgeworth? You know you want one, too. They're great for when you're stressed.Edgeworth:(Why do I envision stuffed animal abuse when she says that...?)White display case, left sideEdgeworth:Inside this display case is a row of lifesavers and life vests for sale.Meele:We sell a lot of those when there's some kind of accident or something. But some people buy them even when nothing's going on. How about it, Mr. Edgeworth? Care to buy one?Edgeworth:(I sense that this shop is one shopper away from being sued.)White display case, right sideEdgeworth:(There are all kinds of luxury name-brand merchandise for sale in this display case. And they're lined up in just such a manner as to scream, \"Buy me!\" to any passers-by.)LogicConnect \"Murder weapon: Capt. Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release)\" and \"Tiny captain's hat\"Leads to:\"Hmm... The hat probably used to be on the piggy bank's head.\"Edgeworth:(Hmm... The hat probably used to be on the piggy bank's head. Let's give it a go and see...) I believe this piggy bank was forcibly removed from this display case.

Really?Examine evidenceCaptain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy BankHatEdgeworth:The hat on its head was found inside a display case in the in-flight shop. I wonder if that fact has any bearing on this case...?Edgeworth:Don't tell me you don't know what things go where in this shop.Meele:Well, I don't! Ms. Rhoda's in charge of this place. So, come on, how should I know anything?Edgeworth:(I sense that further inspection of this display case is needed.)TalkCammy MeeleAbout the shop (appears after examining broken glass or empty shelf in broken display case, before correctly deducing broken glass or empty shelf in the broken display case)Meele:I cut my finger on those bad pieces of glass.Edgeworth:Don't blame the glass for something you did to yourself. Just be more careful.Meele:Same to you! You're the one walking all over broken glass. You sure you're OK?Edgeworth:I'm fine. Any glass I walk on, I crush... like this!Meele:That's nice. Please be careful around the display case, OK? Wouldn't want you to get hurt.Edgeworth:Compared to the glass around my feet, the inside of the case is nothing to be afraid of. After all, no glass fragments appear to have ended up inside.Meele:Then I guess even you can tidy up the case, right?Edgeworth:Perish the thought!ExamineBroken display caseEdgeworth:(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)ExamineFigurines in left display caseEdgeworth:Is this the same man as the one portrayed by the statues around the elevator?Meele:Yeah, that's a paperweight of the founder of GoYou Airlines, Mr. Ugo Hughes (changed from [iFly Airlines, Mr. Hugo Ifly] in the original release).

You just said the first thing that came to your mind, right?Meele:............Edgeworth:(Looks like (changed from [Looks I] in the original release) [sic] hit the bull's-eye.)Broken glass or empty shelfEdgeworth:(The glass on this door is broken... Perhaps it was the killer who broke it in order to take the piggy bank? But it's a bit odd that the inside of the case is so devoid of glass shards. Plus, the glass broke rather cleanly...)Meele:Aaaaaaaah!Edgeworth:Wh-What is it!?Meele:I... I touched the glass, and it cut my finger!Edgeworth:.........Meele:It hurts, Mr. Edgeworth! It hurts!Edgeworth:...Please tell me you can deal with such a minor cut on your own!Handles or locksEdgeworth:(For security, there's a lock on this display case.) Ms. Meele, if I may ask you about this lock...Meele:Ummm... The one who's in charge of the shop is Ms. Rhoda, so... ...she's got the keys to all of the display cases.Edgeworth:I see...Meele:Oh!

Yeah, I guess it'd be like that!Edgeworth:However, there's not a single piece of glass inside the display case.Meele:Nope! No, there isn't!Edgeworth:Which means that the glass was broken from the inside out. The piggy bank must've fallen over from the turbulence and right through the glass.Meele:Yeah, that's for sure. There's so much glass all over the floor.Edgeworth:I'm willing to bet that this hat was knocked off its head at that time, too.Meele:.........Eh!? ......That's nice.Edgeworth:Which leads me to believe... ...that the killer took the Captain Ugo bank (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) from here after the turbulence (Turbulence - The plane shook so much during it that it made a huge mess of the shop.)!Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy Bank data updated in my Organizer.Meele:..................zzz.Edgeworth:Take your power naps on your own time, Ms. Meele, and listen when I'm talking!Meele:Wah!Edgeworth:But the murder occurred before the turbulence... ...which rules this piggy bank out as the murder weapon.Meele:So you mean the bank's not the real murder weapon? It's a fake?Edgeworth:Yes, at this point, that is a very real possibility.Meele:Um, but then what if when the killer went to take Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release)... ...they broke the glass by accident?Edgeworth:The display case is locked, so that's highly unlikely.Meele:...Yeah, but there's one person who could've.Edgeworth:Oh? And who would that be?Meele:Ms. Rhoda, of course. I mean, she's the one in charge of this place, so she has the keys to everything.Edgeworth:Ms. Rhoda Teneiro, huh...ExamineBroken display caseEdgeworth:(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)Broken glass or empty shelfEdgeworth:There's not a single piece of glass inside the display case.

These suitcases are lined up a bit too prim and proper.Meele:Yeah, they look a bit uptight, don't they? But I guess they take after their creator, hee hee.Edgeworth:Again, that's not what I meant, Ms. Meele. Don't you find it unusual that these cases are the only things undisturbed by the turbulence? (...Never mind. I'd sooner find an answer by inspecting these suitcases myself.) Upon closer inspection, they really are quite hideous.Meele:Tee hee... I wonder how Ms. Rhoda would've reacted if she'd heard what you just said.Edgeworth:.........Meele:What's wrong?Edgeworth:(...She makes a good point.

It appears the substance in question is grape juice. But why would there be juice on the wheel of a suitcase?)Edgeworth:Hmm, it would appear to be unlocked. Let's take a look at what's inside.

It's blood!Edgeworth:It appears that this suitcase... ...is very strongly tied to our murder after all!Investigation CompleteMeele:So explain this to me...? What does this suitcase have to do with the murder?Edgeworth:I believe it's pretty safe to say that the killer used this suitcase in some manner. Such as to move something perhaps?Meele:Ehhhh...

Was the victim wrapped in it at some point? Hmm... There's something very familiar about this fabric pattern...Edgeworth:In light of this, I'd say that Mr. Hicks was moved into the elevator from someplace else. Which means that the murder was committed in an entirely different location!Meele:......... So you're saying that after moving the body into the elevator... ...the killer brought the suitcase in here and just left it?Edgeworth:Exactly.Meele:.........Edgeworth:What is it?Meele:Um, nothing... Just that... ...I was thinking about what Ms. Rhoda said about coming here for something...Edgeworth:!???:Excuse me, Mr. Edgeworth...Teneiro:I wanted to give you a bit more time... ...but I'm afraid I wasn't able to convince the captain. I'm very sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. but the captain feels that he has allowed you ample time. He says that he'd appreciate it if you could wrap it up here and return to your seat.Edgeworth:I understand his sentiments, however, if I'm not allowed to complete my investigation... ...the crime scene may become contaminated by the time we land. If I must stop, then I insist I be allowed to oversee the preservation of the two sites. ...Under your supervision, of course.Teneiro:If that's your only condition, then I believe we can accommodate your wishes.

And wherever there are criminals to be caught.Edgeworth:(Her name is Franziska von Karma. The daughter of my mentor, Manfred von Karma, she, like myself, is a prosecutor.) Are you heading up this case? It would be a bit of a relief if you are...Franziska:Don't you try to flatter me! Miles Edgeworth... I'm placing you under arrest.Edgeworth:Wh... What!?Franziska:It's quite frustrating, actually. I had hoped to exact my revenge on you in a different venue... ...but I'll have to take what I can get. I never thought I'd see the day... ...when a disciple of the house of Von Karma would become a criminal! Have you no shame!?Edgeworth:Wait! It has all been a big misunderstanding! I didn't kill the victim!Franziska:A misunderstanding!? I heard all about the murder over the police radio from the captain himself. You waited for the victim on the first floor, and then beat him to death.Edgeworth:Franziska, do you honestly believe that I killed a man?Franziska:.................. I suppose I should reserve judgement until after I have investigated this for myself. I can put your arrest on hold until then.Edgeworth:That's as it should be.Franziska:Hah! I don't need a lecture on how to perform my duties from you of all people. \"To be perfect in every way.\" The fulfillment of that creed alone is all I strive for!Edgeworth:Well, I have my own creed which I must fulfill, so why don't we solve this together?Franziska:...I have to get going. The crime scene awaits. Don't you dare leave town.Edgeworth:Trust me, I had no intention to.Franziska:Detective Gumshoe!???:Yes, sir!Franziska:Too slow!Gumshoe:Owww!Franziska:Listen up.

She was always good at quick responses to a case.Gumshoe:I'd say she was, uh... a little too quick, sir.Edgeworth:Oh? How so?Gumshoe:Uh... Um...! I rushed on over as soon as I got word of the affair, sir! But somehow, when I got here... ...Ms. von Karma was already here barking out orders at everyone! It was kinda creepy! As though she knew there had been a murder or something... ...and had come in advance to await your flight's arrival!Edgeworth:(That is sort of odd. She did show up rather quickly, and out of the blue. Plus, I still don't know why she's here in America... There must be some backstory to all of this.)Franziska von KarmaGumshoe:Ms. von Karma just kinda popped up at the Prosecutor's Office about a week ago, sir. Something about chasing down leads related to a certain incident...Edgeworth:No details?Gumshoe:It's kinda top-secret, so she can't talk about it, even with me, sir.Edgeworth:(Knowing her, the only type of talking she likes to do is with her whip. Plus, I doubt the top-secret part was what stopped her from talking to you, Detective. Although, I wonder if her case has anything to do with mine...?)PresentProsecutor's BadgeGumshoe:Hey, Mr. Edgeworth, I think something just fell out of your pocket.Edgeworth:Hm?

His name is Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release), and apparently, he's supposed to be a monkey.Gumshoe:Ooooooooooh! I'm feeling some inspiration coming ooooooon!

And it is no good that attendant refuses to exit the attendants' room, too!Edgeworth:That attendant...? (I wonder if he's talking about Ms. Teneiro?)Anything elseLablanc:What is it!? Do you have some use for me? You seem not to understand; I have no time to waste! Let me put it another way! \"Le temps, c'est de l'argent!\" There! Maybe another language will get through your head!Edgeworth:(I understood you perfectly fine in English.)ExamineBlue doorOfficer:Sir, you can't go in there.Edgeworth:I'm Miles Edgeworth. I am one of the prosecutors on this case, so please let me through.Officer:I'm very sorry, sir. No one is allowed to enter without Ms. von Karma's express permission.Edgeworth:But I'm on the case...Officer:Yes, I understand that, but... ...I also have explicit instructions not to let you through from Ms. von Karma.Edgeworth:(Grrr... Why would you do this to me, Franziska...?)PianoGumshoe:They've got a piano on this plane!? Hey! Do you think I can try it out, sir?Edgeworth:I'd think you would know better than to randomly touch things at a crime scene, Detective! Besides, I didn't know you knew how to play.Gumshoe:Of course I do! I'm practically proficient!Edgeworth:(Interesting... The things you learn about people on a daily basis.)Gumshoe:I can get Do and Re to come out just right, sir!Edgeworth:Two notes does not a proficient pianist make, Detective.WindowsGumshoe:Oh, man... there's a really pretty lady in that plane over there. Aaaaaaack! She's looking over here! Quick, sir! Wave at her with me, please!Edgeworth:I refuse to be your wingman on this!Magazine rackEdgeworth:(There are a few copies of Sky Magazine in the magazine rack.)Gumshoe:This month's special... Oh, looks like it's an English trivia quiz. Oh, I've got one! What starts with \"i\" and means \"boldly rude\" and \"disrespectful\"?Edgeworth:(The answer is most definitely \"insolent\".)Gumshoe:Time's up! Sorry, sir, but the correct answer is \"insolvent\"!Edgeworth:(Detective Gumshoe... Don't tell me your English ability is at the same level as \"him\"...)Statue to left of elevatorGumshoe:Hey! This statue...Edgeworth:What about it, Detective? Did you notice something?Gumshoe:I saw this guy in a dream last night! The resemblance is uncanny, sir!Edgeworth:You saw him in your dreams?Gumshoe:Well, yeah. I saw him, and then I arrested him! I wanted to show you just how vital I am in our partnership!Edgeworth:(Being useful in your sleep is of no help to me in the real world, Detective.)Police lineGumshoe:Looks like we can't go beyond here, sir.Edgeworth:(Plus, the body has been sent off to the medical examiner's office for an autopsy.)Chair on ground next to tableGumshoe:Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! You have to see this chair!! It says, \"In honor of Rocker Pals' Day\".Edgeworth:And what exactly is the big deal with these \"Rocker Pals\"?Gumshoe:They're a seriously sweet Swiss super-star rock band, sir! Ah... Makes me wanna listen to one of their songs right now.Edgeworth:Sorry, I got lost in that forest of s's just now...Gumshoe:Do you want me to explain it to you again?Edgeworth:You know, Detective, I think I'll have to take a raincheck on that, regrettably.Examine evidenceBorginian ClothBloodstainEdgeworth:For there to be this much blood on this piece of cloth... Was the victim wrapped in it at some point? According to Mr. Lablanc, this textile is fairly famous.Gumshoe:What a waste...PartnerNotice anything?Edgeworth:Anything of interest, Detective?Gumshoe:Um, well, I can say that I don't quite know everything about the situation yet... ...so I was just telling myself that I should go ask someone about the stuff I don't know! I mean, just because I don't know it doesn't mean someone else might not know it, right!?Edgeworth:(It must be my imagination, but for a second, I think I actually understood his logic!)Edgeworth:What did you mean by \"that attendant\", Mr. Lablanc?Lablanc:She was taken into the attendants' room for her interview. And then they still have not come out! They make no sign of coming out either! I was finished with my own interview much earlier, quicker than her!Edgeworth:(Why is Ms. Teneiro's interview the only one that's taking up so much time...?)Franziska:Miles Edgeworth. You were given free reign [sic] to examine the plane, weren't you?Edgeworth:Yes, I was able to obtain the cooperation of the flight attendants. Speaking of attendants, I'd like to speak with Ms. Teneiro. I wonder if you might grant me permission to enter the flight attendants' room?Franziska:Hmph. Before I do... ...you still have to clear up a few issues surrounding your own circumstances.Edgeworth:...I understand.Franziska:You may have tricked those attendants with your sophisticated talking... ...but you can't pull the wool over my eyes, Miles Edgeworth.Argument-- Franziska's Logic --Franziska:Let's not complicate things and go with the most obvious conclusion.The scene of the crime was here, in the very lounge the body was discovered.From the time the victim was seen calling for an attendant until his body was found......the only person in this lounge the entire time was you, Miles Edgeworth!This, unmistakably, makes you the likeliest suspect.Edgeworth:Hmph. The \"likeliest suspect\", Franziska?Franziska:Do you have a problem with that?Edgeworth:No, but it's not like you to use such vague wording. You're usually a bit more... absolute.Franziska:I'm simply trying to watch out for you. Or is my kindness too hard for you to comprehend?Edgeworth:Thank you, but your leniency is unnecessary, for I will prove my innocence soon enough! (If I want to continue my investigation, I'll have to break her line of logic, fast!)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Don't you think you're being a bit rash by simply declaring me the culprit? Franziska: Hmph. I like my affairs to be simple. And perfect. I'll show you the meaning of both when I finish this whole thing within three minutes! Gumshoe: Hey! You say that like you're cooking a pack of instant noodles! Threeeeooooooowww! Franziska: I won't allow even three seconds of useless testimony to be uttered in my presence! Edgeworth: (...I see she hasn't changed a bit. But I won't allow her to send me to prison so easily.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So tell me, Franziska, do you know all there is to know about the crime scene? Franziska: I know all that I need to know in order to arrest you. Edgeworth: And nothing more? Franziska: .........Are you saying there is more I need to know!? Gumshoe: Aaaaaaaaah! Wh-Why did you whip me, sir!? Franziska: Sorry, Scruffy. My hand must've slipped. Edgeworth: (It would appear that Franziska doesn't have all the facts of this case yet.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What do you mean by \"seen\"? Franziska: Please stop pretending like you don't know. It's insulting. Obviously, I'm talking about how Mr. Hicks was seen calling for an attendant at 5 AM. And then, from the time after that call until the body was found...Edgeworth: Edgeworth: While it's true that I was in the lounge the whole time... ...that fact alone does not make me the criminal. Franziska: Franziska: Hah, we'll see about that at the conclusion of this investigation. However, there is one thing that even you must admit at this time.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Under the circumstances, I suppose I can agree that I am the most likely suspect. Gumshoe: B-But I believe in you, sir! I don't think you did it! Ms. von Karma's gotta believe that, too, right! I mean, you two are like siblings...OWWWW! Franziska: Quiet, Scruffy! Even if we were related by blood, that's no guarantee that he's not a criminal! Edgeworth: .........Franziska... Franziska: I demand to see some proof that you are not the guilty party!Edgeworth: (The likeliest suspect, huh. What a roundabout euphemism. But it would appear that she doesn't yet know... ...about the new evidence that we acquired, and where we acquired it. I'll take care of the gaps in her logic one hole at a time.)",

This still doesn't put you in the clear! Not by a long shot!Argument-- Franziska's Logic, Pt. 2 --Franziska:You prepared yourself and acquired the piggy bank before the plane hit that turbulence.And then, you waited for the victim in the lounge, where you beat him to death.Then, while you were in the elevator with the victim's body stuffed into the suitcase......the plane hit that patch of turbulence, and out flew the body from within the suitcase!With no way out, you hastily put the suitcase back where you had taken it from......and pretended to be the \"discoverer\" of the body.Edgeworth:Not a bad bit of logic, for something you thought of on the fly.Franziska:Just what are you insinuating?Edgeworth:That I will show you exactly how flawed your logic is. (No matter how strong of a face you put on, not even you can hide your fears from me. I'll expose the flaws in her logic in one fell swoop!)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And how do you suppose I was able to take the piggy bank out of its display case? As I recall, the case was locked. Franziska: That's easy. If the case was locked... ...you simply had to hit the glass... like this! Gumshoe: Eeeeeoww! Y-You've shattered my heart of glass! Edgeworth: (So she wants to talk about the in-flight shop and the Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) bank, does she...?) Franziska: That takes care of how you obtained the murder weapon.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I thought there wasn't any of the victim's blood found in the lounge. Franziska: Hmph. I thought you'd say that. What? Did you think I wouldn't have noticed? I think you just found a way to cleverly hide the blood splatter in the lounge! By \"accidentally spilling\" grape juice on top of it! Edgeworth: Gnrgh! Are you accusing me of tampering with the crime scene now!? Franziska: We'll see, won't we? The forensic scientists are hard at work on that as we speak. Edgeworth: .........And? What do you propose I did after that?Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So I put the victim's body into the suitcase, and then? Where was I headed, Franziska? Franziska: That's pretty obvious. You were bringing it to First Class where you could safely keep an eye on it! Edgeworth: We're talking about this thing, you know. I'd hardly call it discreet or ordinary. Franziska: Hmph. Annoying brat. Well then, you were intending to leave it inside the elevator. But unfortunately for you, a wrench was thrown into your plans, because...Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You've experienced turbulence on a flight before. Franziska: Of course. Many times. You get used to it after a while. Edgeworth: The patch we hit was especially rough... and I passed out briefly, but only for a second. Gumshoe: Good thing it was only for a sec, sir! It'd been bad if you had really blanked out! Edgeworth: Y...Yes, indeed. (Unfortunately, blanking out is exactly what got me into this mess in the first place.) Franziska: That's enough of your idle chatter. I'm not through with you yet, Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph... If I really were a criminal, do you really think I would be so easily caught? Franziska: Franziska: You are certainly in the middle of being caught right now! Edgeworth: Gnaaaaaaargh! (I have to find a contradiction fast or I won't have much of my own hide left to save!) Franziska: I have to say, you are looking rather caught right now. And I'll tell you exactly what you did after that. You loitered around in the lounge...Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I didn't pretend to be anything! I really was the first to discover the victim's body! Franziska: ...I suppose that's true. Edgeworth: Hm...? So then... you are yielding to my statements? Franziska: Don't be foolish! I still insist that you are the killer, but... ...in that sense, you really were the first to \"discover the body to be dead.\" Edgeworth: (...No matter what I say, she seems dead set on making me out to be the killer.)Edgeworth: (Her logic is reasonably sound... ...and the large majority of it reflects the truth... ...but there is one point about it that is not quite right.)",

The return of the Great Thief Yatagarasu... Thinking back, everything began on that fateful day, two days ago...)\n-- 2 Days Earlier --\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, everything began high up in the air, 9,000 feet in the air, to be precise...)\nPA Notice:\nThank you for flying GoYou (changed from [iFly] in the original release) Airlines. We are currently experiencing some slight turbulence. We are asking all passengers to please return to their seats and fasten their seatbelts.\nMarch 12, 6:13 AM\nFlight G-390 (changed from [I-390] in the original release), First Floor - Lounge\nEdgeworth:\n...Nnngh... ...Why do I feel like I just woke up from a horrible nightmare? (6:13, huh... Guess I was out cold for about 10 minutes. Hah, \"slight\" turbulence, indeed.)\nPA Notice:\nLadies and gentlemen, we are currently experiencing some slight turbulence. For your safety, we ask that you return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.\nEdgeworth:\n(I suppose turbulence is to be expected on a flight. Though admittedly, I'm less than comfortable with anything resembling earthquakes... Hm? What's this...? A travel wallet? But it's not mine... How did someone else's travel wallet wind up in my pocket...? Nnngh...! My head... Why won't this headache go away...? I'll take care of this travel wallet later. Or hand it off to an attendant...) Unngh... From earthquake-like turbulence to an elevator... ............ Hmph. What am I doing hesitating like this? (Actually, I know full well why I hesitate. It was when I was still but a young child... I was caught up in a murder that happened in an elevator. But how long am I going to let my past haunt me!? It's just an elevator! I'm a grown man now! I need to behave like one!) Wh......What the...!? What in the world happened!?\n???:\nIs there something wrong, sir? I must ask that you please return to your se... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! He... He-He-He's DEAD!!!\nEdgeworth:\nPlease calm down! We mustn't jump to conclusions without all the facts...\nPassenger:\nWhat's wrong!? Did something happen!?\n???:\nY... Y-You MURDERER!!!\nEdgeworth:\nWh--!? N-NO! You have it all wrong! It wasn't me!!\nMarch 12, 6:41 AM\nFlight G-390 (changed from [I-390] in the original release), Second Floor - First Class\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront of badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.\n\n\n\n\nBack of badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nEach Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!\n???:\nEveryone, I am sorry to interrupt, but I have an important announcement.\nTeneiro:\nI am one of your flight attendants today, Rhoda Teneiro. Unfortunately, we have just had a minor accident on this flight.\nPassenger:\nAn \"accident\"!? Don't treat us like we're stupid! I caught a glimpse and it was a murder!\nPassenger:\nWhat!? M-Murder!? What's going on with this flight!?\nTeneiro:\nEveryone, please calm down. There's no reason to panic. This flight will stay on course and make its scheduled landing. We are still currently in the middle of a rough patch of turbulence. So until we are out of this area of turbulence, I ask that you please remain seated...\nPassenger:\nB-B-But, someone was killed, right!? I mean, what about the killer!? Let me off...!\nTeneiro:\nPlease, there is no need to feel threatened. We have already apprehended the culprit.\nEdgeworth:\nI ask that everyone please remain calm.\nPassenger:\nWhat the heck is he talking about!? Why should we remain calm!?\nEdgeworth:\nMy name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a prosecutor and I assure you I am not the killer.\nPassenger:\nHah! Being a prosecutor doesn't make you incapable of murder, buddy!\nEdgeworth:\nNow you listen here! I am not the killer! I simply found the body!\nTeneiro:\nSo you say, however... ...I am sure that you are the perpetrator of this crime. I swear on my honor as a professional flight attendant.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, is that right?\nTeneiro:\nI know what I saw. And there's even very strong, incriminating evidence to back me up.\nEdgeworth:\n(What kind of \"incriminating evidence\" is she talking about...?)\nTeneiro:\nWe've already alerted the proper authorities at our destination. Until we land, you will remain in our custody by the powers vested in our captain. I'm very sorry, but please understand our situation.\nEdgeworth:\n(Your situation? I'm more concerned with mine, and the direction it's going in... I'm not about to just sit idly by while I get accused of murder!) Ms... Teneiro, is it?\nTeneiro:\nYes?\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering if you might give me a chance.\nTeneiro:\nA chance? To do what?\nEdgeworth:\nA chance to plead my case. And a chance to ask what you meant by \"incriminating evidence\" just now.\nTeneiro:\n.........\nEdgeworth:\nTo accuse a passenger of such a grave crime without allowing him to give a proper defense... Can the professional flight attendant inside of you really call this action \"righteous\"?\nTeneiro:\n......... You have a point. Very well, I'll listen to what you have to say... ...but be wary of what you reveal. I'm afraid you'll only look even more suspicious if your explanation fails to satisfy. I also do not have the time to deal with you all day, so please make it quick.\nEdgeworth:\n...... Of course. As you wish.\nTeneiro:\nGood. Very well then, let's get started.\nEdgeworth:\n(I know for a fact that I didn't kill that man in the elevator. What I don't know is what sort of \"evidence\" she has up her sleeve... ...but I'm certain it doesn't fit with how the crime really occurred.)\nTestimony\n-- What Ms. Teneiro Saw --\nTeneiro:\nI swear to tell the whole truth as a professional flight attendant.\nUnfortunately for you, Mr. Edgeworth, I am certain you are the killer.\nThe scene I saw in front of the elevator...\n...it was you, standing there, with fresh blood dripping off of the murder weapon.\nSo, if you would please cooperate, we'll turn you over just as soon as we land.\nEdgeworth:\n(That's it...? That's her evidence...!?)\nTeneiro:\nI don't think you could ask for a more perfect witness testimony. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n(Not really. It's hardly perfect when there's a gaping hole in it.)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Tell me, what exactly puts the \"pro\" in \"professional flight attendant\" for you? Teneiro: Well, it means we are very professional about how we take care of our passengers. Services like fetching papers and responding to calls are done with speed and accuracy. I can assure you that I give testimonies with the same level of professionalism. But I'm sure you have already realized that by now, right!? Edgeworth: (It's a bit hard to \"appreciate\" your professionalism when I'm the one under suspicion.) Teneiro: And there you have it. My professional testimony is accurate and reliable.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You certainly seem sure of yourself. Teneiro: Of course! A professional flight attendant can't afford to make mistakes, after all. Edgeworth: Perhaps. But you must admit there are few who can look at a murder with a clear mind. Teneiro: We attendants all go through extensive training and are always calm and collected. We'll even calmly serve you coffee, if you so wish, as the plane makes a splashdown. Edgeworth: (I fail to see how that would be the calm and rational thing to do in an emergency.) Teneiro: Even until the bitter end, we are there to serve the passengers. That is the duty of all professional flight attendants! Edgeworth: You certainly are confident. Anyway, shall we return to your testimony?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Yes...? What did you see in front of the elevator? Teneiro: That's what I was just about to tell you, Mr. Edgeworth. Framed by the elevator doors and bathed in the light coming from within...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: The murder weapon, dripping with blood...? Really, now. Teneiro: I swear that was the grisly scene I saw before me. Thank goodness it wasn't a passenger who saw, or there'd be widespread panic by now. Edgeworth: As I recall, you were quite panicked yourself at the time... Teneiro: ............ Excuse me? Edgeworth: You were scared enough to misread the situation and accuse me of murder. Teneiro: Nonsense! Professional flight attendants cannot afford to be that flustered! I witnessed the murder scene and am now listening to your defense, all with a smile. Edgeworth: (Apparently, you also lie with a smile on your face.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I am not the culprit... And yet, you would keep these restraints on me? Teneiro: Mr. Edgeworth, please try to understand what kind of situation you're in right now. Edgeworth: And what exactly is my situation? Teneiro: I have the backing of the captain to keep you bound in this way. We are within our legal right to restrain anyone who might threaten our captain mid-flight. In essence, you're in the same situation as someone who has been arrested by the police. Edgeworth: (So I am to stay restrained until I can clear up all of her doubts? At least I'm close.)\nEdgeworth: (Her mistake shines like the silver lining on a dark rain cloud. And I'm going to capture some of that light with evidence!)",

Well, it doesn't matter.) Ms. Teneiro. You say you saw the murder weapon dripping with blood. Is that correct?\nTeneiro:\nYes. All that blood... Drip, drip, drip... Just recalling that scene sends a chill down my spine.\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, but your so-called \"professional\" flight attendant training has failed you.\nTeneiro:\nWh-What!?\nEdgeworth:\nI'd like to direct your attention to this! Do you know what this is?\nTeneiro:\nIt's... a travel wallet, right?

Impossible...!\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, do you still think I am the killer? That I killed him with a travel wallet?\nTeneiro:\nBut... But...! I...! No, but I... I saw blood dripping from the wallet! I know I did!\nEdgeworth:\nAs you can see, this wallet is clearly stained. But if you would be so kind as to take a whiff... ...I think you'd agree it's only grape juice.\nTeneiro:\nAh! Then... Then...!\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right. You mistook grape juice for blood! The murder weapon dripping with blood does not, in fact, exist!\nTeneiro:\nN-Nooooooooooooooo!\nEdgeworth:\n(There. That should clear up that pesky accusation.)\nTeneiro:\nTeneiro:\nW-Wait just a sec! That is... I mean, even a wallet could be deadly if it was [sic] wrapped around something heavy! I demand that you show me what's inside... Please...\nEdgeworth:\n(She's trembling, and the tacked on \"please\" at the end... Sounds like I've got her.) There's no need to look inside. Even you can tell from its appearance that it's light.\nTeneiro:\nNo! I can't be sure of anything until I see the contents of that wallet for myself!\nEdgeworth:\n(*sigh* She's a persistent one. I suppose we have no choice but to see what's inside.) Ms. Teneiro, if you would be so kind as to open the wallet and check its contents for me.\nTeneiro:\nAlright. I usually don't pry into passengers' belongings, but we have no choice here.\nLeads to examination of travel wallet\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel Wallet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems that this passport is all that's in here.\n\n\n\n\nGrape juice stains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nGrape juice stains the outer cover. True, it was I who dropped it in the juice, however, I didn't do it out of ill intentions.\nAfter examining button of travel wallet:\nEdgeworth:\nAs you saw, there is nothing but a passport inside.

I'm rather curious myself. Th-This is...!\nTeneiro:\nJust as I thought... This travel wallet belonged to Mr. Akbey Hicks... ...which makes it the victim's property.\nWallet data updated in my Organizer.\nTeneiro:\nYou... You stole the victim's wallet... ...didn't you...?\nEdgeworth:\nH-How dare you!?\nTeneiro:\nYou said it yourself. You claimed to be holding this wallet in your hands when I found you.\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nTeneiro:\nPerhaps I did misconstrue the wallet for the murder weapon.... ...but it seems that I wasn't wrong about who the culprit is.\nArgument\n-- Ms. Teneiro's Logic --\nTeneiro:\nAs you claimed, the murder weapon is not the travel wallet...\n...however, it IS something you stole from Mr. Hicks after you were done with the vile deed.\nI find it hard to believe myself, but your motive was very simple...\nYou were out to steal Mr. Hicks's money, weren't you?\nEdgeworth:\nSo even though I didn't have the murder weapon on me, you still suspect me, I see...\nTeneiro:\nYou stood up at the crime scene with the victim's wallet in your hands. How can I turn a blind eye and not suspect you of foul play?\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Shouldn't that be proof enough for you that I did not murder the victim? Teneiro: Not at all! Edgeworth: Oh, and why not? Teneiro: Because, that wallet may not have been what I thought it was...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You think I stole it...? Teneiro: Yes! I'm very sorry to say it, and I wouldn't usually be so rude, but it must be said! Edgeworth: ? Teneiro: I never thought I'd see the day, but here I am calling a passenger a thief! Edgeworth: ......... Teneiro: Maybe I should put on a serious face and say it more directly. I believe you removed the wallet from the victim's personage! Edgeworth: ...It really doesn't matter how you phrase it. What I'd like to know is why you think I stole Mr. Hicks's wallet!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph, I don't think I have any sort of motive to speak of. I've never met Mr. Hicks before, and our only connection is this one flight. Teneiro: But that is more than enough of a reason. Edgeworth: How do you figure? Teneiro: He was sitting in First Class, and I think the implication is quite clear.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You think I was after his money!? Wh-Where did that cockamamie idea come from!? Teneiro: True, you are also a passenger in First Class, but... ...I thought something was off about you and those deeply-etched lines on your forehead. Edgeworth: Th-They're not lines!! They're perfectly normal and a part of my natural face! Teneiro: I don't think I've ever met someone with such a terrible (changed from [terrible] in the original release) countenance on a flight before. Edgeworth: ......... Teneiro: And that's when it hit me. You have the face of someone with money trouble!\nEdgeworth: (She... really is making a fool of herself, pursuing this line of logic.

The floor is covered in bills and coinage. By your rationale, these were the very things the killer was after.\nTeneiro:\nAaaah!\nEdgeworth:\nI think we can assume that the wallet fell during the victim's struggle with his killer. And I would think that the killer would've noticed something like money scattering somewhere. Furthermore, as you can see, there was no effort made by the killer to gather the money!\nTeneiro:\nB-But...! The wallet...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAh yes, the wallet.

It's a trick!\nTeneiro:\nNnnngh.........\nEdgeworth:\nWill you all please be quiet!? Ms. Teneiro.\nTeneiro:\nYes?\nEdgeworth:\nYou lost your cool when you saw the dead body. Plus, the lounge was dark, and looking into the light from the elevator... ...it's easy to see how you mistook the wallet in my hand for the murder weapon. I take no offense that you thought that I was the killer.\nTeneiro:\nMr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nThank you for releasing me.\n???:\n[Borginese speaking]!\nEdgeworth:\n(Wh-What is it now!?)\n???:\n[Borginese speaking]!\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Teneiro, if you could please translate, I'd be much obliged.\nTeneiro:\nI-It sounds like Borginian... But I... ...I don't understand any of it. There's another attendant on this flight who...\n???:\nI said that he is giving the runabout!\nEdgeworth:\n!\n???:\nI don't require an interpreter! I speak English just well! See! You, the attendant!\nTeneiro:\nY-Yes, sir!\n???:\nI want this person to be under the arrest until we arrive at the airport!\nEdgeworth:\n......\nTeneiro:\n......\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry, sir, but what exactly are you hoping for?\n???:\nWhat is it you want? I am finished talking to the likes of you.\nEdgeworth:\nPlease, I would like to hear why you would like me to be held under arrest until we land!\n???:\nYou! How dare you try to waste my time!?\nEdgeworth:\n(You were the one who stuck your nose into my affairs!)\n???:\nI wanted to spend even at least one more second with my precious art! I have no time for other things! I know what you are! I see through you! Insolvent! Yes, I am pretty sure that's how you say it in English!\nEdgeworth:\n(Well, I should hope I'm not monetarily bankrupt (changed from [I'd hope that I don't dissolve in water] in the original release, correcting a mistake where Edgeworth defines insoluble instead of insolvent), but I don't think that's what you meant.) I'm sorry, but I don't think I caught your name.\nLablanc:\nI am Zinc Lablanc II. I am a very wealthy man in the Borginia! But I am not an ordinary rich man! I am an art dealer... a rich seller of beauty!\nTeneiro:\nMr. Lablanc, what did you mean just now?\nLablanc:\nPardon!?\nTeneiro:\nUm, when you said that Mr. Edgeworth was giving me the \"runabout\"?\nLablanc:\nI have to explain!? Unbelievable... I will say it once and only once. I do not have even a second to waste! \"Time is money\" as they say!\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, and yet you continue to blather on...)\nLablanc:\nI saw it, yes I did. I saw the victim go onto the elevator. Going down to the lounge! It was exactly at 6 o'clock!\nEdgeworth:\n......\nTeneiro:\n...... A-And what's the significance of that time...?\nEdgeworth:\n(At 6, he says.........) W-Wait, you saw him at 6!?!?\nTeneiro:\nAaaah! Wh-What's the matter, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nLablanc:\nHe understands, I see. Ms. Attendant! What time did you discover the body!?\nTeneiro:\nWell, it was a little after that patch of turbulence, so I would say around 6:15... Ah!\nLablanc:\n\"Hicks\" was his name, was it? Then I say that man Hicks was killed in the 15 minute time span. And the only person in the lounge at that time was this prosecutor, yes?\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nPassenger:\nY-Yeah! I-I was in my seat the whole time!\nPassenger:\nM-Me, too! I was watching the movie and enjoying a fine glass of grape juice!\nPassenger:\nI was still eating! Still haven't finished, see!\nLablanc:\nThe other passengers have an alibi, so you have no problem with them, I suppose?\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nLablanc:\n\"No compliant\", I see. Not a single word against this, right!?\nEdgeworth:\n...I have no way of discounting what you have put forth at this point, but it wasn't me.\nLablanc:\nOh!? So you say! But do you have, what you say, the evidence?\nTeneiro:\nMr. Edgeworth... Are you really the culprit after all...?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Lablanc. I suppose you are quite certain in what you saw? Enough to give testimony? .........\nLablanc:\nOf course! I was looking at that man the whole time! He was playing with that annoying little... um... small \"machine\" the whole time!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Machine\"...?\nLablanc:\nYes, that's what you people call it in English, yes? It was making me crazy with the click, click, click!\nEdgeworth:\n(From that description, it sounds like some sort of small computer...)\nTeneiro:\nI believe what Mr. Lablanc is talking about is a cell phone. I have to say that I did see him playing with it quite a bit, myself.\nEdgeworth:\n(A simple cell phone? A laptop or organizer I can see, but... That's kind of... low budget.)\nLablanc:\nI hate that noisy little machine in his hand! Not a fragment of beauty! All it produces is ugly sounds! Anyway, I know what I saw!\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Teneiro.\nTeneiro:\nYes?\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering if I might be granted permission to examine the crime scene.\nTeneiro:\nWhat!? You want to... examine the crime scene?\nEdgeworth:\nIf you would grant me a little measure of time, I'm sure I can produce the real culprit.\nLablanc:\nHmph. I don't like the sound of that. \"Fox in the duck pen.\" Yes, I think that is how you say it in English.\nEdgeworth:\nIt's \"Fox guarding the henhouse.\" And I believe my innocence was proven earlier. And if I'm given the chance, I can clear up all the remaining doubts.\nTeneiro:\n.........\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Teneiro! If you wait until we arrive... ...there is a good chance that some evidence will have been destroyed by then.\nTeneiro:\n......... ...I understand. Let me see what the captain has to say.\nLablanc:\nHah! This should not be approved!\nTeneiro:\nPlease, Mr. Lablanc! In an emergency, all decisions are to be made by the captain alone. Now, please wait here while I go ask the captain what to do. I'll be right back.\nLablanc:\nYou are not planning to erase evidence when you are doing your investigation, yes?\nEdgeworth:\nOf course not!\nLablanc:\nHah, we will see!\nTeneiro:\nMr. Edgeworth, you have the captain's permission to investigate the crime scene.\nLablanc:\nWh-What!? Unbelievable!!!\nEdgeworth:\nI am in your debt, Ms. Teneiro.\nTeneiro:\nHowever... there is one condition. I am to supervise you. Can you agree to that?\nEdgeworth:\nOf course, I see no problem with that stipulation. It's only natural as I am still a suspect in this case.\nLablanc:\nGrrrrrr...\nTeneiro:\nI take full responsibility and will watch Mr. Edgeworth's every move. I hope this is reassurance enough that there will be no foul play. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, shall we proceed? If you should need my help with anything, please feel free to use [X / Y / triangle / T] to talk (changed from [touch the Partner Button] in the original release).\nEdgeworth:\n(It's time to head to the scene of the crime... the first floor lounge.)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendant in front of door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me, but may I have a word with you?\n???:\n............\nEdgeworth:\nYou there!\n???:\n............*yawn* ...If you need something, please ask Ms. Rhoda over there, OK?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat the...? Hey! Wake up, you!\nTeneiro:\nI'm terribly sorry that she's being so rude, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nNo need for you to apologize. I just find it hard to believe she's asleep on the job! (If I were her boss, I'd see to it that her salary was cut so low that it was in the red.)\n\n\n\n\nZinc Lablanc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLablanc:\nHurry up and investigate!

D-Don't get-t-t-t near m-m-m-me... y-you criminal!\nTeneiro:\nHe said, \"Don't get near me, you criminal!\"\nEdgeworth:\nI am not the killer, and I intend to prove that starting now.\nPassenger:\nB-B-But th-that's c-c-contrary to th-the f-f-facts!\nTeneiro:\nHe says, \"But that's contrary to the facts!\"\nEdgeworth:\n...I can understand his English just fine, thank you very much.\n\n\n\n\nPassenger in green suit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassenger:\nHey, miss... How about another glass...?\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me, but I was wondering if you know anything about the murder...\nPassenger:\n...How about it? How about a glass together?\nEdgeworth:\nUm, sorry, but I must decline.\nPassenger:\nI wasn't talking to you! I was asking the cute attendant!\nTeneiro:\nI'm sorry, but I'm on the clock right now. But if you need a refill, I'd be happy to bring you another glass at any time.\nPassenger:\nYou got it, toots!\nEdgeworth:\n(Th-That's no way to talk to a lady!)\n\n\n\n\nPassenger eating steak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf I may have a word with you...\nPassenger:\nThis...*munch*...steak... *munch* *munch* so... *munch*...awesome...*munch*\nEdgeworth:\nThat's great to hear, however, I would like to ask you a few questions...\nPassenger:\nI...*munch*...was... here... *munch* *munch*... whole time so...*munch* wouldn't know...\nEdgeworth:\nEat or speak. Please pick one.\nPassenger:\nMUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH\nTeneiro:\nI think he chose to eat...\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, I can hear that.)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoor on right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeneiro:\nThat leads to the emergency escape hatch. You can't go there in mid-flight.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's the probability that the criminal escaped through here?\nTeneiro:\nA hundred percent.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nTeneiro:\n............ Oh! Let me finish my thought. I'm 100% certain they didn't.\nEdgeworth:\n(When I'm searching for an answer, only complete thoughts need apply.)\n\n\n\n\nServing tray\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeneiro:\nHow did you find your meal to be, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nCome to think of it, I forgot all about it. I must have been asleep or something.\nTeneiro:\nOh! I'm terribly sorry! Let me prepare you something right away!\nEdgeworth:\n...What are you apologizing for, Ms. Teneiro?\nTeneiro:\nI've failed in my professional duties by letting a passenger go hungry! Please, help yourself! If you see anything to your fancy, feel free!\nEdgeworth:\nAh, I think I'll take my time later, after I've solved this case. Thanks.\n\n\n\n\nElevator button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeneiro:\nIn order to preserve the crime scene, I'm afraid the elevator is not in service. To get to the first floor lounge, we should take the stairs.\n\n\n\n\nVase on seat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Lablanc seems to be protecting the gargantuan vase on the chair rather closely.\nTeneiro:\nIt's a marvelous vase, though, isn't it? Yes, I dare say so as a professional attendant.\nEdgeworth:\nI don't think there's any real connection between a piece of art and being an attendant...\nTeneiro:\nBut I'm not just any old attendant! I'm a PROFESSIONAL flight attendant.\nEdgeworth:\n(As though there were such a thing as an amateur flight attendant.)\n\n\n\n\nMovie poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a movie poster for... \"License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder\"...\nTeneiro:\nThat's a GoYou (changed from [an iFly] in the original release) Airlines sponsored movie. It's a suspense-hardboiled-action-romantic-horror-comedy flick (changed from [movie] in the original release).\nEdgeworth:\n...Is that the genre listing for this thing (changed from [movie] in the original release)?\nTeneiro:\nYes. It's a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone because it encompasses all those genres!\nEdgeworth:\n...I can't even begin to imagine what the plot would be (changed from [of this movie would be like] in the original release).\nTeneiro:\nBut you have to admit it has piqued your curiosity, right? I heard the main strategy with this genre listing was to make people curious.\nEdgeworth:\n.........Well then, consider the mission a successful one.\n\n\n\n\nSeat next to movie poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis was Mr. Hicks's seat. I don't see the \"machine\" Mr. Lablanc was talking about...\nTeneiro:\nPerhaps it's in the elevator?\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe. We should probably head down to the crime scene now.\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth's seat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's my seat. Unfortunately, I didn't bring anything particularly useful for an investigation. (It's not as if I'm constantly prepared for such a thing to occur...)\n\n\n\n\nChessboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAh, that's right. I was in the middle of recreating a chess game.\nTeneiro:\nJust an observation, but aren't there too many red knights around that lone blue pawn?\nEdgeworth:\n...Nonsense. It simply shows that the blue pawn is no match for the red knights' might.\n\n\n\n\nLifesaver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's a lifesaver doing here...?\nPassenger:\nI-I-I bought it a-at the in-f-f-flight shop just be-beyond the lounge! If-If something sh-should happen, having o-o-one will s-save your life!\nEdgeworth:\n(I think this guy would've been better off not taking a plane to begin with.)\n\n\n\n\nBottles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLook at all these bottles, lined up in a row. It's a miracle they made it through the turbulence without a scratch...\nTeneiro:\nActually, we asked the drink vendor to clean up all the ones that did break earlier.\nEdgeworth:\nThen you mean to tell me he put all these up here after the turbulence...?\nTeneiro:\nWe are simply thrilled to have someone so interested in the variety of drinks available!\nEdgeworth:\n(I don't think anyone should drink this much. There is such a thing as over-hydration...)\n\n\n\n\nParfait\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nOne very large parfait... though I could easily finish it off all by myself.\nTeneiro:\nThis parfait is a GoYou original: the GoYou Parfait (changed from [an iFly original: the iFly Parfait] in the original release)! The \"Go\" comes from \"Gorgeous\", while the \"You\" part comes from \"Yogurt\" (changed from [\"i\" comes from \"I love you\", while the \"Fly\" part comes from \"Flying\"] in the original release). When you combine the two parts, you get \"GoYou\" (changed from [\"iFly\"] in the original release)!\nEdgeworth:\n(Except there's no \"you\" in \"yogurt\"...? (changed from [I fail to see how the \"i\" came from \"I love you\"...!] in the original release))\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeneiro:\nAre you in need of assistance?\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptain's permission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Teneiro, I'd like to ask you about investigating the lounge...\nTeneiro:\nAs long as you have the captain's permission, I can't stop you from looking around.\nEdgeworth:\nIf you could pass a message along, tell him I'm grateful for his spirit of cooperation.\nTeneiro:\nI will. However, please realize that you are still under suspicion. To be honest, I still have my doubts about you.\nEdgeworth:\nOf course, and I take no offense.\nTeneiro:\nDo you really understand what I'm saying?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, verily.\nTeneiro:\nDo you pinky-swear you do, on your honor as a professional prosecutor?\nEdgeworth:\nI-I pinky-swear I do, on my honor as a professional prosecutor.\nTeneiro:\nWell! I guess that settles that.\nEdgeworth:\n(I... I feel my honor as a man slowly diminishing.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeneiro:\nEven if you show that to me, I still cannot allow you free reign. I'm sorry, but I must admit that I still have my doubts about you.\nEdgeworth:\n(Guilty until proven innocent, I see...)\nMarch 12, 7:26 AM\nFlight G-390 (changed from [I-390] in the original release), First Floor - Lounge\nEdgeworth:\nI want to thank you for your help back there, Ms. Teneiro.\nTeneiro:\nIt was nothing. You should thank the captain for granting you permission. And just so everything is perfectly clear... I still don't trust you (changed from [trust you to that extent] in the original release). Your standing with me hasn't changed one iota (changed from [I don't want you to think your standing with me has changed] in the original release).\nEdgeworth:\nI see. I will bear that in mind.\nTeneiro:\nI received an order from the captain earlier. He wanted you to know that... ...we reserve the right to stop your investigation if we feel you are not making progress. And when we do, he asks that you please return to your seat at that time.\nEdgeworth:\n(So my time runs out at his and his crew's discretion, does it? I have to find a way to discredit Mr. Lablanc's testimony before time's up!) I understand. By the way, is there any place you can think of where the killer might hide onboard?\nTeneiro:\nI don't think so. After every First Class passenger was accounted for at his or her seat... ...we made a thorough search of the plane. As for Business and Economy class... ...no one can move between those two classes and First Class without a staff keycard. And we found no record of a keycard being used at all.\nEdgeworth:\n(Which means that I have a First Class Killer on my hands. At least I know that much for sure. And one other thing. No one else has been allowed near this crime scene since the murder was discovered either.)\nBegin Investigation\nFirst Floor Lounge\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, let's get started.\nTeneiro:\nBut where would we start from?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... Let's start with Mr. Lablanc's statements. The crime occurred between 6 AM and 6:15 AM. During that interval, the only person in the lounge was myself. Which would make me the prime suspect. However, since I did not kill Mr. Hicks, it means that the killer was around somewhere (Where was the killer? – What clues point to where the killer could have been?)...\nTeneiro:\nIf we are to believe what you say is true, then yes.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... The first order of business will be to gather information to win your trust.\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeneiro:\nThis door leads to the flight attendants' room. But please understand that it's off limits to unauthorized personnel.\nEdgeworth:\n(The room is giving off the scent of women's perfume. One would think that perfume would \"smell great\", however, to me it simply \"smells\"... Not that I have any interest in what lies behind this door...)\nTeneiro:\nPerhaps we should return to the investigation, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nHm...........................\nTeneiro:\nMr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, I spaced out for a second there.\n\n\n\n\nGlasses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(These bottles and glasses must have been broken by the turbulence.) There is quite a bit of broken glass here. Please be careful when passing through the area.\nTeneiro:\nThank you very much for the warning, Mr. Edgeworth. However, no matter how kind you are towards me... ...know that it does not clear up any suspicions I have about you.\nEdgeworth:\nI-I wasn't warning you for the sake of clearing my name!!\n\n\n\n\nPiano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeneiro:\nThis grand piano is the pride of this plane. It can play the music of whatever CD we insert into its CD drive.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not a piano! It's more like an overgrown music box.\nTeneiro:\nAh, but its keys depress along with the music, as though there really is someone playing it.\nEdgeworth:\n(Some people have entirely too much money to waste on overly-complex toys.)\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(These counter windows offer a glimpse of the sky, but these clouds, they tell me nothing...)\nTeneiro:\nMr. Edgeworth...? You... look like you're talking to the clouds.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so? Then tell me, what do you suppose I said to them?\nTeneiro:\nI don't know, but it looked like a rather one-sided conversation.\nEdgeworth:\n(The clouds... They tell me nothing.)\n\n\n\n\nMagazine rack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere are a few copies of Sky Magazine in the magazine rack.\nTeneiro:\nThis month's special is an English trivia quiz.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not a bad idea. I've heard that the youth of today don't know a particle from a participle.\nTeneiro:\nNow, now, Please don't go around confusing people with made-up words, Mr. Edgeworth. Who's ever heard of such a silly word as \"participle\"?\nEdgeworth:\n(Case in point...)\n\n\n\n\nStatue to left of elevator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat, or who, is this...?\nTeneiro:\nThis is a bronze statue of the founder of GoYou Airlines, Mr. Ugo Hughes (changed from [iFly Airlines, Mr. Hugo Ifly] in the original release). The one on the left is of when he was in his 40's and the other is of him in his 80's.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Did the man age at all over those four decades (changed from [actually age in the span of four decades] in the original release)? Maybe I need to squint more.)\n\n\n\n\nCrime scene in elevator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat floors does this elevator service?\nTeneiro:\nOnly the first and second, although, it can also go down to the cargo hold. However, that requires a flight crew keycard.\nEdgeworth:\n(So the only floors accessible to passengers are the first and second (Elevator - The victim's body was found inside the elevator that connects 1F with 2F.), huh? I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMoney is strewn all over the floor of the elevator. I would guess it was all in Mr. Hicks's wallet at some point.\n\n\n\n\nShoes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no grape juice residue on the soles of his shoes... ...making it highly unlikely that Mr. Hicks entered this elevator after the turbulence.\n\n\n\n\nBody or bloodstain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI doubt anyone was expecting to find a dead body in an elevator on this flight.\nTeneiro:\nSo Mr. Hicks... He's really d-dead?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. (She's trembling, although I can't fault her for that when there's a corpse right there.)\nTeneiro:\nMr. Hicks... If you're really dead, then please answer, \"yes\"...\nEdgeworth:\n(I see she's over the trembling now... although a new symptom seems to have appeared... Anyway, I should focus on the victim's body. Let's see...) There's blood on the back of Mr. Hicks's head... Could this be the cause of death? He appears to have been struck (Blunt force trauma - Wound on the back of Hicks's head suggests blunt force trauma, but what caused it?) very hard... Even his glasses (Broken glasses - The victim's glasses are broken. Were they broken during his murder?) are broken...\n\n\n\n\nLanyard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder what was hanging off of this lanyard? Something's missing from this picture... Now if I could just put my finger on it...)\n\n\n\n\nLanyard (after correctly deducing lanyard)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe \"machine\" that should be hanging off of here must still be somewhere on this plane!\n\n\n\n\nPocket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? There's something sticking out of his pocket. Hope he won't mind if I take a look at what's inside.) .........Hm? It's a picture. It looks like it was taken inside a building somewhere.\nPhoto of Mr. Hicks data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nPocket (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? There's something sticking out of his pocket. Hope he won't mind if I take a look at what's inside.) .........Hm? It's a picture. It looks like it was taken inside a building somewhere.\n\n\n\n\nFigure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this... sinister-looking figure on the floor here?\nTeneiro:\nOh, that's a piggy bank of our company mascot, Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release). It's just one of the many pieces of merchandise we sell at our in-flight shop. This bank is a limited edition, and is so popular that we're down to our last one.\nEdgeworth:\nYou have an in-flight shop...?\nTeneiro:\nYes. It's just beyond the lounge to the right. The shutter to the store is closed at the moment... ...but it was open the whole flight up until Mr. Hicks's body was discovered.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's blood on here... Could this have been the murder weapon (Murder weapon: Capt. Ugo - The blood on it is still fresh... Could this be the murder weapon?)?)\n\n\n\n\n\nDeduce lanyard (after examining pocket)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)\n\n\n\nPresent Photo of Mr. Hicks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Hicks's 'machine' is nowhere to be found.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis crime scene completely contradicts this piece of evidence!\nTeneiro:\n............ I'm sorry, but where?\nEdgeworth:\nAh, I see the truth here in my mind's eye. I'll try to explain it in a simpler fashion for you.\nTeneiro:\nUm, alright...\nEdgeworth:\n(There's something missing from this scene in front of me. And I'll show Ms. Teneiro what's \"off\" through that piece of evidence!)\nLeads back to examination of crime scene\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Hicks's \"machine\" is nowhere to be found.\nTeneiro:\nHis \"machine\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nAhem, his cell phone, Ms. Teneiro.\nTeneiro:\nAh, so I guess because it's not here...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I think we can safely deduce that the killer took it.\nMissing Cell Phone data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime scene in elevator (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nCrime scene in elevator (after examining body and figure, and correctly deducing lanyard)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nPool of juice stain near elevator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's some spilled grape juice in front of the elevator. (I assume it was spilled during the turbulence.)\nTeneiro:\nOh, we must clean that up or someone might get hurt...\nEdgeworth:\nAha!\nTeneiro:\n? What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI've found some very important evidence. What is the important piece of evidence in this scene?\n\n\n\nPresent footprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What is it...?\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent line marks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese lines here... They obviously weren't made naturally.\nTeneiro:\nYou're right! But how were they made then, and why are they here?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know yet... (But I do know they are important to this investigation.) Aha!\nTeneiro:\nWhat is it now, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI've found an even more important piece of evidence in this scene!\nLeads back to:\n\"What is the important piece of evidence in this scene?\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nTeneiro:\n............ I'm not sure what's so important about that, Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nN-No, wait! (Curses. This is no time to get careless!) Allow me to point it out to you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"What is the important piece of evidence in this scene?\"\n\n\nTeneiro:\nWhat is it...?\nEdgeworth:\nThey're a little smudged, but I think we can both agree they are a set of footprints (Spilled grape juice – There is some spilled grape juice on the floor in front of the elevator.).\nTeneiro:\nSo you think...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, these belong to our killer.\nTeneiro:\nOh, then maybe we should check the shoe sizes of everyone in First Class!\nEdgeworth:\nI don't think that will be of any help to us. Unfortunately, the prints are too smudged, which will make it hard to get a definitive match.\nTeneiro:\nOh, I see...\n\n\n\n\nPool of juice stain near elevator (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSpilled grape juice in a pool at my feet... Unfortunately, the delightful scent of grapes is obscured... ...by the unpleasant smell of the crime scene.\nTeneiro:\nThis scent in the air... It's the same smell as the smell of my towels after they come out of my home dryer.\nEdgeworth:\nI-I would've never expected something like that by looking at you... (I suppose everyone has something unpleasant about them...)\n\n\n\n\nStatue to right of elevator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA pity that a bronze statue knows not when good drink has been spilt at its feet.\nTeneiro:\nThis is a statue of our founder, Mr. Ugo Hughes (changed from [Hugo Ifly] in the original release), who was a big fan of grape juice. I'm sure he would be thrilled if he knew so much grape juice was here at his feet.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is that a hint of hero worshipping I detect...?)\n\n\n\n\nChair on ground next to table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(This toppled-over chair... Yet another victim of the turbulence.)\nTeneiro:\nAaaaah!! Nooo! Look at all that grape juice staining the back...! It may not look it, but this chair was extremely valuable.\nEdgeworth:\nIt was?\nTeneiro:\nYes! It was used when the Rocker Pals came to tour this plane. The Rocker Pals' leader sat in this very chair.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but what are these \"Rocker Pals\"?\nTeneiro:\nI can't believe you've never heard of them! They're all the rage! The Rocker Pals are an extremely popular international band. They added the \"Pals\" part as they became more popular, especially among teens.\nEdgeworth:\nAh, that explains it. I'm not really one for the music of today. (Maybe I should ask Detective Gumshoe about them later... On second thought... I can already see how confusing the conversation would get.)\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nGlasses and candles thrown into disarray by the turbulence.\nTeneiro:\nIt's been a while since I've seen this big of a mess. It's terribly embarrassing, but I thought it was an earthquake for a second... ...and I frantically started searching for gas valves to shut off.\nEdgeworth:\n(I guess the shaking of the plane was bad enough to be mistaken for a real earthquake. Not that I would know, since I was unconscious for most of it...)\n\n\n\n\nShutters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeneiro:\nThe in-flight shop is just beyond these shutters. But we don't have permission to open them, so I'm afraid I must leave them closed.\nEdgeworth:\n(There must still be clues to be found here in this lounge! I must remain ever vigilant.)\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Murder weapon: Capt. Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release)\" and \"Blunt force trauma\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA statue with blood on it lying next to the body of a man who was beaten to death...\nTeneiro:\nOh! Mr. Edgeworth! I think I figured something out!\nEdgeworth:\nY-Yes? What is it?\nTeneiro:\nThe way the blood is on this, it looks like it matches up with the wound on his head!\nEdgeworth:\n(Well, aren't we deserving of the Master of the Obvious title...)\nTeneiro:\nWell? What do you think, Mr. Edgeworth? Don't you think that's worth investigating?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... It would appear that this figurine is our murder weapon.\nTeneiro:\nOh, I just knew it! I mean, I can't think of any other connection!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm, perhaps Master of the Oblivious would be more befitting...)\nCaptain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy Bank data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Where was the killer?\" and \"Elevator\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(True, there wasn't anyone else in the lounge other than myself right before the turbulence... ...but if the killer was in the elevator along with the victim (In the elevator with Hicks? - If only I could prove that the killer rode the elevator with Hicks...), then that's a different story.)\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"In the elevator with Hicks?\" and \"Spilled grape juice\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI have it!\nTeneiro:\n? I'm sorry, but I don't understand, Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nI can prove that someone other than myself was here around the time of the murder.\nTeneiro:\nWhat!? R-Really!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. It's rather simple, actually. The proof is in the pudding. Or rather, the grape juice in this case. These footsteps here confess to me this very fact... ...that someone exited the elevator, alive. Seeing as how the victim is dead, that would mean a second person.\nTeneiro:\nBut... couldn't the footprints be from Mr. Hicks himself?\nEdgeworth:\nAh, but if you take a look at our victim's shoes, you can see the soles are spotless.\nTeneiro:\nWhich means...\nEdgeworth:\n...Mr. Hicks wasn't alone in the elevator. In fact, it's quite the opposite. There was actually one other person inside the elevator!\nGrape Juice Footprints data jotted down in my Organizer.\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice anything? (appears after examining pool of juice stain near elevator and presenting footprints) (this Talk option disappears after connecting \"In the elevator with Hicks?\" and \"Spilled grape juice\" Logic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDid you notice anything?\nTeneiro:\nI was wondering whose footprints those are next to the elevator.\nEdgeworth:\nI'd say the killer's, wouldn't you say? Even if they aren't, I'm sure they are a vital clue to solving this case.\nTeneiro:\nOoh, maybe there are other clues waiting to be found in other places. Come on now, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go find them together.\nEdgeworth:\n(A word of advice: nobody likes a credit thief, so stop stealing my lines.)\n\n\n\n\nAbout the victim (appears after examining body and figure)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering if you noticed anything, Ms. Teneiro.\nTeneiro:\nYes... I can't help but notice the sad atmosphere in here.\nEdgeworth:\nUm, hmm, yes... It is a rather tragic crime.\nTeneiro:\nI'll say. Robbing the poor man after bludgeoning him to death, talk about rubbing in the salt! I can't forgive someone who would do this to a passenger of mine! I swear as a professional flight attendant that I will capture the culprit with my own hands!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I promise as a prosecutor to solve this case with logic and deduction. (I should go over all the leads I've collected so far one more time. The key to solving this lies at the intersection of my logic and the evidence.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrape Juice Footprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf these footprints do, in fact, belong to the culprit... ..then I would say it was very careless to leave them.\nTeneiro:\nIf I was [sic] a killer, I swear that as a professional killer, I'd never leave footprints behind!\nEdgeworth:\nThat's all well and good, but I'm afraid it's of little use in our pursuit of the killer. (I feel like I'm still missing a link or two...)\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy Bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt says \"GoYou (changed from [iFly] in the original release) Airlines\". You know, I've seen it occur a lot recently, and it's been bothering me greatly... ...but why do some brands think it's acceptable to simply smash two words together and call it a day (changed from [does nobody know how to properly capitalize and space nouns anymore] in the original release)!?\n\n\n\n\nCoin slit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose this is where you insert your coins. I have to say, for a piggy bank, it's made rather well. So well, in fact, that I'm not sure there is a way to take your money out...\n\n\n\n\nBloodstain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is some blood on one of the corners. Could this piggy bank be the murder weapon?\nAfter connecting all possible Logic and correctly deducing lanyard:\nInvestigation Complete\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? What's going on over there?)\nLablanc:\n[Borginese speaking]! [Borginese speaking]!\n???:\n[Borginese speaking]... [Borginese speaking]...\nLablanc:\nUnforgivable! This is unforgivable!\n???:\n.........\nLablanc:\nDo you understand what I am saying!? The movie is late! It is the same level of bad as if the plane arrived late!\n???:\nUmmmmm... But the movie...\nLablanc:\nWhat!? I will not talk to you anymore! You are just wasting my time!\nTeneiro:\nWhat is the matter, Mr. Lablanc? If there is no emergency, please return to your seat, sir.\nLablanc:\nDo not tell me what to do! I need not to sit down! Well, Mr. Prosecutor!? Did you prove you are innocent yet!?\nEdgeworth:\nIf you would like, I will prove my innocence to you right now.\nLablanc:\nWhat!? Nonsense! Are you saying my eye-witness testimony is mistaken!?\nEdgeworth:\nNot mistaken, merely that there is room for doubt. I'd be most honored if you could please tell me what you saw in detail once more.\nLablanc:\nFine, suit yourself!\nTestimony\n-- What I Saw --\nLablanc:\nI am certain I saw Mr. Hicks enter that elevator!\nIt was when the needles on my pocket watch pointed to the 6 and the 12!\nThe body was discovered 15 minutes after that in the lounge, yes?\nThen you, the only person in the lounge at that time, must be the criminal!\nEdgeworth:\n(Mr. Lablanc's conclusions seem to make logical sense. After all, the only person in the lounge at the supposed time of the murder was me...)\nLablanc:\nSo! My eye-witness testimony! If you think you can destroy it, then come, let me see! Hurry! Do I look like a man who is having the time to wait for you!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Why is HE so irritated? I'm the one accused of murder here! Anyway, I must find a way to discredit Mr. Lablanc's account somehow, and fast!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Lablanc, were you able to get a good look at the inside of the elevator at that time? Lablanc: Of course, I saw what was inside. Edgeworth: And you are sure that the victim was in the elevator alone? Lablanc: Yes! The only person inside was that Mr. Hicks man! Edgeworth: (Hmm, this last outburst is a bit too important to let go...) Adds statement \"The only person inside was that Mr. Hicks man!\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Was he really alone? Lablanc: Of course! I will bet even 1 cent! Edgeworth: (Hmph, a cheap ante... for a cheap testimony. But if that's how you want to play it, I'll happily take your 1 cent!)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I assume the pocket watch in this case is the one you keep checking, is that correct? Lablanc: Oh! You noticed! It is a very expensive antique, I will have you know! The feeling is wonderful when I fully wind it up by hand! Edgeworth: Hmm... It does look very well designed, and quite classy. Lablanc: ...I will have to charge you if you want to touch it! Edgeworth: ......That's quite alright! Let's continue with your testimony. Lablanc: Hmph! What a cheap man you are! Now return the time you wasted back to me! And if we must, I saw Mr. Hicks enter the elevator at 6 o'clock!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: It's true that I found the victim's body at 6:15. Teneiro: And that's when I found the two of them as well. Lablanc: You see! It all matches my testimony!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: That is the most mistaken way of thinking I've ever heard of! Lablanc: Lablanc: No, no, no! Your silly opinion is what is mistaken! Teneiro: Please calm down, the both of you. In a sense, you are both mistaken. Edgeworth: (Well if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black, then I don't know what is.)\nEdgeworth: (He certainly has a lot of confidence in his testimony. If push comes to shove, I may need to press him for more information.)\nEdgeworth: (Hmph... I spy a little hole in his words. As you wish, Mr. Lablanc, I will now show you proof of my innocence!)",

It does look very well designed, and quite classy.\nLablanc:\n...I will have to charge you if you want to touch it!\nEdgeworth:\n......That's quite alright! Let's continue with your testimony.\nLablanc:\nHmph! What a cheap man you are! Now return the time you wasted back to me!

If push comes to shove, I may need to press him for more information.)\nAfter pressing first statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmph... I spy a little hole in his words. As you wish, Mr. Lablanc, I will now show you proof of my innocence!)\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Lablanc.\nLablanc:\nWhat is it!?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is a very glaring contradiction in your testimony!\nLablanc:\nWhat do you mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nPlease take a look at the area in front of the elevator. There, at the spilled grape juice.\nLablanc:\nYes, and!? Will you admit you also spilled it with the blood!?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, it spilled itself during the turbulence. But the interesting thing here is the set of grape juice footprints.\nLablanc:\nF-Footprints!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, the ones that lead from within the elevator out into the lounge itself. It's evidence that proves that someone other than Mr. Hicks exited the elevator, alive!\nLablanc:\nOoooooooonnff!!\nEdgeworth:\nThere must have been another person in the elevator with Mr. Hicks! Now then! I'm done playing games! Why don't you tell us the truth!?\nLablanc:\n[Borginese speaking]! ...[Borginese speaking]!\nEdgeworth:\n............\nTeneiro:\nCan you please translate for us?\n???:\nUmmmmmmmmmmm... \"No way!

He doesn't seem to be lying. But then, what does it mean? What about this contradiction?) Mr. Lablanc. Please, just once more, will you recall the details of what you witnessed for me?\nLablanc:\nMnnnnrgh!\nTestimony\n-- What I Saw, Pt. 2 --\nLablanc:\nI was very upset when Mr. Hicks passed by my seat.\nI was always checking the time, over and over again.\nI happened to follow that man with my eyes when he passed me.\nAnd I saw clearly into the elevator he was entering.\nBut, I swear there was no one else inside! No one!\nTeneiro:\nMr. Lablanc, if you would please calm down...\nLablanc:\nWhat!? Dare you too have an issue with my eye-witness testimony!?\nTeneiro:\nAaaaah! N-No, not at all! Please forget I said anything!\nEdgeworth:\n(Yet again, he doesn't appear to be lying. But I can't let this testimony stand as the truth!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So, are you still upset now? Lablanc: I am always upset! The only time I am not is when I have a piece of art in my hands! Edgeworth: (...It's surprisingly easy to believe that about him.) Lablanc: But I was even more upset when Mr. Hicks walked by me!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Why were you so attentive to the time? Lablanc: Because! Because something unforgivable was happening! Edgeworth: Hmm, come to think of it, you were yelling about something \"unforgivable\" earlier... Lablanc: I was giving a complaint to the attendant about the movie starting time! Return back to me my time!! In money!! ...You understand the point. Edgeworth: (Movie? Is he talking about the in-flight one that's mentioned in the magazine? Hmm... A summary of the plot and its (changed from [the] in the original release) start time... Interesting...) Lablanc: They were supposed to show \"License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder\". I cannot see that movie in my country. You can only see it on international flights. I looked forward greatly to that movie!! I checked my pocket watch whenever possible so I would not miss it! I even set my pocket watch to the destination time when I came onboard. So my watch is not wrong! It matched the schedule! But the movie was still late! Very, very late!

I was so looking forward to watching \"License to Love, Laugh, Maim, and Murder\"! Edgeworth: Ms. Teneiro, was this movie shown on this flight? Teneiro: Yes, it was shown at the scheduled time... Edgeworth: ......Isn't it possible you simply slept through it by accident? Lablanc: Nonsense! You doubt me!? Edgeworth: N-No! Now stop pointing at me like that! (Odd. How did he miss a movie that he was clearly hoping to see...?) Lablanc: I checked my pocket watch a great number of times! That much I know for sure!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You're sure about what you just testified, Mr. Lablanc? Lablanc: Yes, of course! I am a very busy man! I am immediately busy when I land! I have many places to go! And no time to waste adjusting my pocket watch! Edgeworth: I see... That was a very valuable statement you just made. Lablanc: Hmph! Flatter me all you want, but you will not get 1 cent out of me! Edgeworth: Um... That's alright. All I require is this piece of testimony.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Since you only \"happened\" to see him, it's possible that you missed something in that glance! Lablanc: Lablanc: Even if I only \"happened\", I did not miss a thing! Edgeworth: And how can you be so sure? Lablanc: Just because! Edgeworth: I would appreciate it if you didn't take my life so lightly with a simple, \"Just because!\" Lablanc: Hmph! Well, then I was only making a joke! I saw Mr. Hicks, alright?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Is it possible that someone was hiding inside? Lablanc: What!? You dare insult me!? I have belief in my eyesight! When I look for art to sell, I am told often I have \"great sight\" for the arts. Edgeworth: (I think the phrase you were looking for was \"great sense\", although that's debatable.) But isn't it possible someone was just outside of your line of sight...? Lablanc: You are persistent! I tell you, I looked clearly!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Why do you insist that you are absolutely not mistaken!? Lablanc: Because when I say I am not wrong, I am not wrong! Teneiro: Mr. Lablanc, if I may, I think beyond misconceptions and mistakes lies the truth.

I may need to draw more information out of him before I see anything inconsistent.)\nTeneiro: I honestly don't think Mr. Lablanc is lying... Edgeworth: Hmm... I don't think he's lying either. But... I think he might be mistaken about something. Teneiro: Mistaken...? Edgeworth: Yes. And I'm going to correct his mistaken recollection with evidence.

The correct time is worth its 6 cents.\nEdgeworth:\nI would like you to take a look at this. If you believe this Sky Magazine... ...clocks on this flight run in accordance with the time of our departure time zone! Of course, the movie schedule was also created with that in mind. Ms. Teneiro, for confirmation's sake, what time zone is this flight aligned to right now?\nTeneiro:\nWell, we made a short stop at a transfer point.\nEdgeworth:\n(That's right. It was in that small Asian country, the \nRepublic of Zheng Fa...)\nTeneiro:\nBut we didn't re-adjust our onboard clocks at that time. So right now, we are still running on Borginian time!\nLablanc:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nThe time difference between Borginia and our destination is 9 hours. In that case, it's only natural that your watch would be out of sync with the schedule!\nLablanc:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!?\nEdgeworth:\nFurther, with your analog watch set to our destination's time... ...it would appear to be running 3 hours fast when compared to the flight's onboard clocks. It also changes everything about your testimony. And you can bet 1 million cents on that! In light of this information, it means you saw Mr. Hicks \n3 hours prior at 3 AM!\nLablanc:\nNnnnn...ggggggwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! My 1 miiiiiiiiiiiiiiillion ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeents!!!\nEdgeworth:\n(This should clear up all of the remaining accusations...)\nTeneiro:\nSo this basically widens the time frame for the time of death, right...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. Because Mr. Lablanc saw the victim enter the elevator at 3 AM... ...it means that the time of death could be anywhere from 3 to 6:15 AM. The question now is where was Mr. Hicks during that span of time and what was he doing?\n???:\nUm, I've got something to say.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd you are...?\n???:\nYeah, um... Oh! I'm Cammy Meele. I'm a flight attendant.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what is it you wish to say?\nMeele:\nWell, I think your story is a little different from how I remember it.\nTeneiro:\nWhat do you mean, Cammy?\nMeele:\nI saw Mr. Hicks sitting in his seat at 5 AM, you know.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat? How can you be so sure of the time?\nTeneiro:\nOh, that's right! He pushed his call button while we were parked at the transfer point.\nEdgeworth:\nAh, the stop we made for refueling and cargo transfer in Zheng Fa, correct?\nTeneiro:\nYes, it was from 4 to 5 AM according to our clocks.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd during that time, did any of the passengers leave or did any new ones board this flight?\nTeneiro:\nNo. Not a single person got off or on in Zheng Fa.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about the flight crew?\nTeneiro:\nThe few who were handling the cargo transfer might have temporarily gotten on or off... ...but eventually everyone, including Cammy and myself, came back on the plane.\nEdgeworth:\n(So basically, I can assume that no one left or got on since our initial take off. Interesting... I should keep that in mind.)\nRefueling in Zheng Fa data jotted down in my Organizer.\nMeele:\nYeah, and I answered his call. I can tell you Mr. Akbey Hicks was there in his seat when we took off again at 5 AM.\nMs. Meele's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nAlright, then that puts the time of the murder between 5 and 6:15 AM.\nMeele:\nOK, now what time did you come down to the lounge, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, I remember coming down here almost as soon as we left the Republic of Zheng Fa... Aaah!\nLablanc:\nYou! You were here the whole time from 5, yes!? Then you are the only one who could be the killer!\nTeneiro:\nMr. Edgeworth... Were you really here in this lounge the entire time from 5 AM onwards?\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, yes.\nTeneiro:\nBut then, how do we explain the footprints?\nLablanc:\nIs not that obvious!? This man waited for Mr. Hicks here in this lounge. Waited to kill him! And then he put the corpse into the elevator! That is when the turbulence happened! My eye-witness testimony may have been mistaken! But what time I saw Mr. Hicks enter the elevator on the second floor does not matter! Because the entire incident concluded here in this lounge!\nEdgeworth:\n(Everything happened in this lounge...?) Is that what you really believe, Mr. Lablanc?\nLablanc:\nWh...!? Do you have another idea!?\nEdgeworth:\nI simply feel that there is something out of place in the scenario you presented. (Is there something that can tie this crime to a location other than this lounge?)\nPresent Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy Bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The murder weapon...\"\nPresent Grape Juice Footprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese footprints. In which direction do you think these are headed?\nTeneiro:\nThat would be... the in-flight shop.\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect. They are headed in the direction of the shop.\nLablanc:\nBut they look disconnected! They end all of a sudden!\nEdgeworth:\nYou are right to point out that they do not form one continuous trail to the shop. However, there is another piece of evidence that connects the shop to our crime scene. (Besides the footprints, what else points to the in-flight shop?)\n\n\n\nPresent Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy Bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The murder weapon...\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLablanc:\nHmph!

I don't need to hear your wild desperation stories! \"Grasping for weeds\" I think is how you say it, yes!?\nEdgeworth:\nAgnrk...... I didn't mean to pull that piece out! It was a simple slip of the hand, I assure you!\nLeads back to:\n\"Is there something that can tie this crime to a location other than this lounge?\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe murder weapon... This little piggy bank is sold at the in-flight shop. It is sold there and only there, and is not displayed here in this lounge! How, then, did it find its way here? Don't you find that a tiny bit suspicious?\nLablanc:\nHmph! Such a trivial point! It only means you prepared it, taking it from the shop first before coming here. It doesn't prove you are innocent at all!\nEdgeworth:\nNnnrrrgh......... (Is there no way to win with this man!?)\n???:\nTeneiro:\nI-If I may...!\nLablanc:\nWhat is it!?\nTeneiro:\nUm... You see...! Well, it's just as Mr. Edgeworth says!\nLablanc:\nOh? And why do you know this so well?\nTeneiro:\nWell... It's just that... That piggy bank was there in the shop. I saw it with my own eyes.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd when was this?\nTeneiro:\nIt was... maybe around 5:40 AM...?\nEdgeworth:\n...Isn't that just before we hit that patch of turbulence!?\nTeneiro:\nTh-That's right...\nLablanc:\nYou were in the shop just before the turbulence!?\nTeneiro:\nUm............ Yes, I was.\nEdgeworth:\nCome to think of it... Ms. Teneiro, when I found the body... ...I believe you came out of that door.\nTeneiro:\nYes, I did...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what is beyond that door?\nTeneiro:\nThat's the flight attendants' room.\nLablanc:\nTh-Then! You were on the first floor!?\nTeneiro:\nYes... I had to do something at the shop and in the flight attendants' room. So I went to the shop first, and then to the flight attendants' room.\nEdgeworth:\nAre you saying you passed by me at some point?\nTeneiro:\nYes. You seemed really into the issue of Sky Magazine you were reading at the time. I don't suppose you noticed me walking by...\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm, I vaguely recall someone walking by, but I didn't take notice of who it was.)\nTeneiro:\nAnyway! The piggy bank was definitely there at the shop when I went there.\nLablanc:\nWhy did you go to the shop in the first place?\nTeneiro:\nI... went there for a work-related matter.\nLablanc:\nWork, you say?\nTeneiro:\nYes... The upkeep of the shop is also one of my responsibilities.\nLablanc:\nWhy did you not say anything about that until now is what I want to know.\nTeneiro:\n.........\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case, I believe it's clear that the shop needs to be investigated as well.\nTeneiro:\nShall we head over there, then?\n???:\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What is it now!?\nMeele:\nAren't you forgetting something, Ms. Rhoda...? Don't you need the captain's permission to check the shop?\nTeneiro:\nNo, I haven't forgotten. But I have already asked him for permission to search the entire plane. So I think we're alright.\nMeele:\nHuh...? That's weird...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is?\nMeele:\nWell, I just talked to the captain, see... ...and he said that he didn't give you permission to do anything like that at all.\nTeneiro:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Ms. Teneiro!?\nMeele:\nIt means she's lying. Go on, admit that you are. You said you had permission to search all over, but you don't. And yet, here you are!\nTeneiro:\n.........\nLablanc:\n...You, flight attendant! Wh-What are you trying to do!? Pull the sheep over us!?\nMeele:\nThe captain's calling for you, Ms. Rhoda. Oh, but don't worry... I already got permission to search the shop from the captain. See, unlike you, I do things the right way.\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Teneiro... Why would you do such a thing?\nTeneiro:\n.........Please excuse me.\nMeele:\nLooks like I get to be in charge now. Please go back to your seat, Mr. Lablanc. Now then, Mr. Edgeworth... ...if you would follow me, I will be your guide from now on.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's something about Ms. Teneiro that has piqued my curiosity. But right now, investigating the in-flight shop is my top priority.)\nApproach stairs to second floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeele:\nUm... Weren't we going to go to the in-flight shop?\nEdgeworth:\nOf course. I still fully intend to.\nMeele:\nOK, well, the shop is over there. Don't forget now.\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCammy Meele\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Meele! About investigating the in-flight shop...\nMeele:\n............\nEdgeworth:\nYou're of no use to me asleep! Wake up!\nMeele:\n*yawn* Huh? What's up?\nEdgeworth:\nI-I need you to come with me so I can search the shop...\nMeele:\nGo on ahead without me. *yawn* I'll catch up with you later.\nEdgeworth:\n(How has this woman not been fired yet?)\n\n\n\n\nZinc Lablanc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLablanc:\nOoooooh, I am really mad! You had better hurry and bring to me some evidence!\nEdgeworth:\nIf you could wait just a little longer while we look into the shop...\nLablanc:\nHmph! Don't number the birds before they are born!\nEdgeworth:\n(Don't number the... What...? I have no idea what he's trying to say. \"Don't count your chickens before they hatch\" perhaps...?) All I ask of you is your patience and cooperation.\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeele:\nMr. Edgeworth! That's the attendants' room!\nEdgeworth:\nAh, please excuse me. It was a simple mistake.\nMeele:\nYou made a mistake, didn't you!? Why don't you just come out and say it?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's exactly what I just said. I made a small mistake.\nMeele:\n............\nEdgeworth:\nDon't nod off while I'm talking!\n\n\n\n\nGlasses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(These bottles and glasses must have been broken by the turbulence.) There is quite a bit of broken glass here. Please be careful when passing through the area.\nMeele:\n............ Huh? Did you say something?\nEdgeworth:\nI said that there is glass here, and to be careful...\nMeele:\n............ But why?\nEdgeworth:\n(Obviously, common sense does not register, even as a blip, on this girl's radar!)\n\n\n\n\nPiano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(A piano... It's been a while since I played one of these. It might not be a bad idea to brush up a bit after all this time. Of course, that's contingent on the outcome of this case! It's time to get investigating!)\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(These counter windows offer a glimpse of the sky, but these clouds, they tell me nothing... Ack! Now's not the time for me to stand here making up soliloquies! I should be hurrying to the shop and investigating!)\n\n\n\n\nMagazine rack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere are a few copies of Sky Magazine in the magazine rack. The special this month is an English trivia quiz. Of course, I have never uttered a single grammatically incorrect sentence in my life.\nLablanc:\nWhat is it!? Why are you looking at me for? Hurry and go do your investigating! I do not believe in this \"making haste slowly\" saying you have in English!\n\n\n\n\nStatue to left of elevator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's something written on the pedestal... \"Here lies Ugo Hughes (changed from [Hugo Ifly] in the original release)\" ............?

For the victim's sake, I will do anything in my power to bring this to a speedy end.\n\n\n\n\nBloodstain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is blood on the back of Mr. Hicks's head... Could this be the cause of death? He appears to have been struck very hard...\n\n\n\n\nLanyard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe \"machine\" that should be hanging off of here must still be on this plane somewhere!\n\n\n\n\nPocket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like there was just the one picture in this pocket.\n\n\n\n\nFigure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCaptain Ugo (changed from [The Mr. Ifly] in the original release) here was probably used to hit the victim on the back of the head.\n\n\n\n\n\nPool of juice stain near elevator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nConsidering which way these prints are pointed, it's likely the killer went into the shop. I should really make my way over there now.\n\n\n\n\nStatue to right of elevator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA pity that a bronze statue knows not when good drink has been spilt at its feet. Odd... Compared to the one on the left, this statue appears to be slouching a little. ...It must be the altitude. Yes, that's it.\n\n\n\n\nChair on ground next to table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(This toppled-over chair... Yet another victim of the turbulence.) There's something written on the back: \"In honor of Rocker Pals' Day\"...? I have the distinct impression that this chair has nothing to do with this case.\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nGlasses and candles thrown into disarray by the turbulence. Seeing this reminds me of the ferocity of that last patch. And of... ...No, I can't do this anymore. I've overcome that already. I won't let past traumas control me for the rest of my life.\nMarch 12, 8:32 AMFlight G-390 (changed from [I-390] in the original release), First Floor - In-Flight Shop\nEdgeworth:\n(So this is the in-flight shop...) It's quite a mess in here...\nMeele:\nYou think? Guess I'll have to clean things up then, tee hee.\nEdgeworth:\nHold on! You can't \"clean up\" a potential crime scene!\nMeele:\nOhhh, thank goodness! I hate cleaning soooo much.\nEdgeworth:\n(I mustn't rush things here. I must remain cool, calm and collected. Because this piggy bank (Murder weapon: Capt. Ugo - The blood on it is still fresh... Could this be the murder weapon?) was left at the crime scene... ...there is a very good chance that the killer had paid this place a visit.)\nBegin Investigation\nIn-Flight Shop\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCammy Meele\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeele:\nI don't know much about this shop, but you can still ask me about whatever.\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice anything?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo what do you think about what has happened regarding this case?\nMeele:\nOh, I don't know. I guess I think you're the killer, though, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nI can assure you that I'm here in this shop to prove just the opposite...!\nMeele:\nYeah, but it was me that got you the permission to look around, you know. So don't forget that, OK?\nEdgeworth:\nHow am I supposed to thank you properly if you insist on falling asleep!?\nMeele:\nWell, you know what'd really show your thanks? You see that item for sale over there?\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, but you're going to have to make do (changed from [make due] in the original release, correcting the typo) with my words of appreciation.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeele:\nOoh, I'd love to have this piece of jewelry. Can I have it?\nEdgeworth:\nN-No, you may not! This is a Prosecutor's Badge...\nMeele:\nPooey. Then why did you show it to me?\nEdgeworth:\nI wanted to prove to you that I really am a prosecutor. And that it's not possible for a prosecutor like me to commit such a crime as...\nMeele:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\n(I see that I'm just wasting my time with Cousin Hair here.)\n\n\n\n\nCaptain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy Bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeele:\nMs. Rhoda said that this piggy bank was in this shop, right? Don't you find her a tiiiny bit suspicious?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't think I can say either way yet. There's not enough evidence to convince me that she was lying about anything back there.\nMeele:\nAre you sure about that...?\n\n\n\n\nRefueling in Zheng Fa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeele:\nLike I said earlier... ...I was the one answering people's calls while we were refueling in Zheng Fa. And Mr. Hicks was in his seat at that time.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat time was that again?\nMeele:\nHe called at around 5 AM. You were at your seat around then too, you know.\nEdgeworth:\nI do recall people calling for service at around that time. (Even if this turns out to be a waste of time, I must stand firm. I just know that there is a vital clue or two awaiting me here in this shop.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeele:\nSo what is that? Are you going to give it to me? Oh, but I'm not supposed to accept any presents. ...Unless they're really worth something.\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nBeautiful flowers in a beautiful arrangement. (I feel cleansed just by looking at them...)\nMeele:\nWell, you're kinda stepping on a few of them, you know, Mr. Edgeworth (changed from [Mr. Edgeworth, you're getting pollen all over] in the original release).\nEdgeworth:\nOh... Excuse me.\n\n\n\n\nSuitcases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are these...?\nMeele:\nOh, those are our company's completely original line of suitcases! They're practically flying out the door! That's how popular they are! You should buy one and see how you like it! You won't regret it!\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps that's how things work on this flight, but in the real world you try, then buy.\nMeele:\nNo way! But either way, it doesn't really matter.\nEdgeworth:\n(True. Either way, why would anyone buy a suitcase AFTER they've boarded the plane?)\nMeele:\nAnyway, see that? Just look at all the Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) heads painted on there! Cute company mascot, isn't he!? They're painted on with a lot of care. Doesn't he look like he's about to jump out at you?\nEdgeworth:\n...It is certainly making something jump inside my stomach!\nMeele:\nHuh...? Oh, I guess there's no fooling your refined tastes!\nEdgeworth:\n?\nMeele:\nYou looked like you really wanted to get one... ...and I thought I was going to finally make my first sale, but you saw right through it. Glad that's done though. Never make me try to give you a sales pitch ever again, OK?\nEdgeworth:\nBut I never showed any interest in it to begin with!\nMeele:\nTee hee! It really is pretty horrible, isn't it? You want to know something? This suitcase was designed by Ms. Rhoda!\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Teneiro designed this?\nMeele:\nYeah. It was a company-wide contest.\nEdgeworth:\nUm, well... It does have a very sharp design sense.\nMeele:\nHa ha, \"sharp\"? Like stinky sharp cheddar, maybe. I really have no idea why the big wigs decided to go with it. It's so... bleh.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ms. Teneiro designed this, did she? ...It's definitely not what I would've expected...) Aaaaaaaaaah!\nMeele:\nYou OK!?\nEdgeworth:\nI-I'm fine! Please watch yourself, Ms. Meele! (Letting a suitcase (Suitcase - Plane's shaking caused it to roll. In-flight suitcase displays can be hazardous.) freely roll around has got to be a safety violation...)\nMeele:\nHere, I'll put it back.\n\n\n\n\nSuitcases (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Suitcases designed by Ms. Teneiro... That's one sharp design.)\n\n\n\n\nLeft side of brown display case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is a wide selection of souvenirs for sale in these display cases.\nMeele:\nYou know what I'd suggest...?\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, but I have no intention of buying souvenirs on this trip.\nMeele:\nOK, then how about you buy something for me then? As a present!\nEdgeworth:\nI can't think of a single reason why I'd want to buy you anything.\nMeele:\nBut I've had my eye on that pendant for such a loooong time.\nEdgeworth:\nTry paying some attention to me when I ask you something, and then we'll talk.\n\n\n\n\nBroken display case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(The glass from this display case's door is shattered all over the floor. And it looks like there's nothing on display inside either. Hmm? Wait, actually, I think there is something... What's this...? A mini captain's hat (Tiny captain's hat - It's a tiny captain's hat...? Hmm... I swear I've seen one of these before...)...?)\n\n\n\n\nStuffed toy display in lower right corner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nStuffed toys, just like the one Ms. Meele is holding, are on display here. (They're relatively cheap, which explains why they're displayed so haphazardly...)\nMeele:\nHow about it, Mr. Edgeworth? You know you want one, too. They're great for when you're stressed.\nEdgeworth:\n(Why do I envision stuffed animal abuse when she says that...?)\n\n\n\n\nWhite display case, left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nInside this display case is a row of lifesavers and life vests for sale.\nMeele:\nWe sell a lot of those when there's some kind of accident or something. But some people buy them even when nothing's going on. How about it, Mr. Edgeworth? Care to buy one?\nEdgeworth:\n(I sense that this shop is one shopper away from being sued.)\n\n\n\n\nWhite display case, right side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are all kinds of luxury name-brand merchandise for sale in this display case.

So, come on, how should I know anything?\nEdgeworth:\n(I sense that further inspection of this display case is needed.)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCammy Meele\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the shop (appears after examining broken glass or empty shelf in broken display case, before correctly deducing broken glass or empty shelf in the broken display case)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeele:\nI cut my finger on those bad pieces of glass.\nEdgeworth:\nDon't blame the glass for something you did to yourself. Just be more careful.\nMeele:\nSame to you! You're the one walking all over broken glass. You sure you're OK?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm fine. Any glass I walk on, I crush... like this!\nMeele:\nThat's nice. Please be careful around the display case, OK? Wouldn't want you to get hurt.\nEdgeworth:\nCompared to the glass around my feet, the inside of the case is nothing to be afraid of. After all, no glass fragments appear to have ended up inside.\nMeele:\nThen I guess even you can tidy up the case, right?\nEdgeworth:\nPerish the thought!\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroken display case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigurines in left display case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIs this the same man as the one portrayed by the statues around the elevator?\nMeele:\nYeah, that's a paperweight of the founder of GoYou Airlines, Mr. Ugo Hughes (changed from [iFly Airlines, Mr. Hugo Ifly] in the original release). On the bottom shelf we have the cute one, the middle shelf is the realistic one... ...and on the top shelf......... That's the floral version.\nEdgeworth:\nF-Floral...? Are you sure about that? Let me guess.

Perhaps it was the killer who broke it in order to take the piggy bank? But it's a bit odd that the inside of the case is so devoid of glass shards. Plus, the glass broke rather cleanly...)\nMeele:\nAaaaaaaah!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What is it!?\nMeele:\nI...

Yeah, I guess it'd be like that!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, there's not a single piece of glass inside the display case.\nMeele:\nNope! No, there isn't!\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means that the glass was broken from the inside out. The piggy bank must've fallen over from the turbulence and right through the glass.\nMeele:\nYeah, that's for sure. There's so much glass all over the floor.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm willing to bet that this hat was knocked off its head at that time, too.\nMeele:\n.........Eh!? ......That's nice.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich leads me to believe... ...that the killer took the Captain Ugo bank (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) from here after the turbulence (Turbulence - The plane shook so much during it that it made a huge mess of the shop.)!\nCaptain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy Bank data updated in my Organizer.\nMeele:\n..................zzz.\nEdgeworth:\nTake your power naps on your own time, Ms. Meele, and listen when I'm talking!\nMeele:\nWah!\nEdgeworth:\nBut the murder occurred before the turbulence... ...which rules this piggy bank out as the murder weapon.\nMeele:\nSo you mean the bank's not the real murder weapon? It's a fake?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, at this point, that is a very real possibility.\nMeele:\nUm, but then what if when the killer went to take Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release)... ...they broke the glass by accident?\nEdgeworth:\nThe display case is locked, so that's highly unlikely.\nMeele:\n...Yeah, but there's one person who could've.\nEdgeworth:\nOh?

You're scaring me, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nS-Sorry... Ahem. These suitcases are lined up a bit too prim and proper.\nMeele:\nYeah, they look a bit uptight, don't they? But I guess they take after their creator, hee hee.\nEdgeworth:\nAgain, that's not what I meant, Ms. Meele. Don't you find it unusual that these cases are the only things undisturbed by the turbulence? (...Never mind. I'd sooner find an answer by inspecting these suitcases myself.) Upon closer inspection, they really are quite hideous.\nMeele:\nTee hee... I wonder how Ms. Rhoda would've reacted if she'd heard what you just said.\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nMeele:\nWhat's wrong?\nEdgeworth:\n(...She makes a good point. It would be wise of me to watch what I say out loud.) What's this? I've spotted something that's not quite right... (What is so unusual about this suitcase?)\nPresent wheels of left suitcase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's something very peculiar about these wheels.\"\nPresent suitcases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nMeele:\nYeah, I figured you thought the design was odd, too.\nEdgeworth:\nI never said the design was odd...!\nMeele:\nYeah, yeah...\nEdgeworth:\nPlease don't give me that attitude! (Argh! I can't let her get me all riled up. Time to calmly take another good, hard look.)\nLeads back to:\n\"What is so unusual about this suitcase?\"\nPresent price tags of suitcase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nMeele:\nYeah, no matter how you cut it, the price is a bit odd, isn't it?\nEdgeworth:\nTh-That wasn't what I was pointing out to be odd... (The answer should come to me if I think back on all that has happened here!)\nLeads back to:\n\"What is so unusual about this suitcase?\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is what is so odd!\nMeele:\nI don't think it's that strange at all.\nEdgeworth:\nW-Well, maybe not to that extent... ahem. (I mustn't over-think this. I should let the answer come to me.)\nLeads back to:\n\"What is so unusual about this suitcase?\"\nEdgeworth:\nThere's something very peculiar about these wheels.\nMeele:\nHuh? As in?\nEdgeworth:\nAs in... ...there are no stoppers in place on these. Without stoppers, one would think that the turbulence would have sent it flying.\nMeele:\n...And?\nEdgeworth:\n*sigh* And so, it is very likely that this suitcase was placed here after we hit that turbulence! Let's take a closer look at it, shall we?\nLeads to examination of suitcase\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoYou (changed from [iFly] in the original release) Suitcase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLock on side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm, it would appear to be unlocked.\"\n\n\n\n\nFront of suitcase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis was apparently designed by Ms. Teneiro herself. The design has a certain... je ne sais quoi about it. Yes... Perhaps that is the best way to put it...\n\n\n\n\nPrice tag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA $1,200 price tag... Not exactly priced by someone with a conscience, I'd say.\n\n\n\n\nStained wheel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(What's this? The wheel is completely covered in something... This color and this scent... It appears the substance in question is grape juice. But why would there be juice on the wheel of a suitcase?)\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, it would appear to be unlocked. Let's take a look at what's inside. A piece of cloth... ...And it's soaked with blood!\nMeele:\nAaaaah! It's... It's blood!\nEdgeworth:\nIt appears that this suitcase... ...is very strongly tied to our murder after all!\nInvestigation Complete\nMeele:\nSo explain this to me...? What does this suitcase have to do with the murder?\nEdgeworth:\nI believe it's pretty safe to say that the killer used this suitcase in some manner. Such as to move something perhaps?\nMeele:\nEhhhh... But aren't you just talking about the cloth then?\nEdgeworth:\nThat alone is too small. A larger item would be needed to move what I'm thinking of.

My real explanation begins now.\nMeele:\n............\nEdgeworth:\n(Is she really asleep...?)\nLeads back to:\n\"The 'thing' I believe the killer used this suitcase to transport is...\"\nEdgeworth:\nSomething that would fit inside a suitcase that is also covered in blood...

Was the victim wrapped in it at some point? Hmm... There's something very familiar about this fabric pattern...\nEdgeworth:\nIn light of this, I'd say that Mr. Hicks was moved into the elevator from someplace else. Which means that the murder was committed in an entirely different location!\nMeele:\n......... So you're saying that after moving the body into the elevator... ...the killer brought the suitcase in here and just left it?\nEdgeworth:\nExactly.\nMeele:\n.........\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it?\nMeele:\nUm, nothing... Just that... ...I was thinking about what Ms. Rhoda said about coming here for something...\nEdgeworth:\n!\n???:\nExcuse me, Mr. Edgeworth...\nTeneiro:\nI wanted to give you a bit more time... ...but I'm afraid I wasn't able to convince the captain. I'm very sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. but the captain feels that he has allowed you ample time. He says that he'd appreciate it if you could wrap it up here and return to your seat.\nEdgeworth:\nI understand his sentiments, however, if I'm not allowed to complete my investigation... ...the crime scene may become contaminated by the time we land. If I must stop, then I insist I be allowed to oversee the preservation of the two sites. ...Under your supervision, of course.\nTeneiro:\nIf that's your only condition, then I believe we can accommodate your wishes. I'm here to assist you in any way that I can, Mr. Edgeworth.\nMeele:\nSounds like fun! We can camp out and watch over everything together!\nEdgeworth:\n(I've found proof that the real crime scene was not in the lounge... ...and I have enough evidence to prove myself to be innocent of any wrongdoing... And yet... Regarding what Ms. Meele reminded me about Ms. Teneiro... I can't allow my investigation to end here! The truth must come to light!)\nTo be continued\nMarch 12, 1:00 PM Local Time\nHope Springs Airport\nEdgeworth:\n(I know that once we had landed... ...I'm supposed to let the local police take over... And thanks to Ms. Teneiro and Ms. Meele, I was able to preserve the crime scene... But I just can't shake it. I wasn't able to talk with Ms. Teneiro in private... ...so I'm left wondering just what was she up to? Why did she do what she did? There must be a way for me to continue my investigation.)\n???:\nI've been expecting you, Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska? I thought you were still in Germany...\nFranziska:\nI go where I am needed. And wherever there are criminals to be caught.\nEdgeworth:\n(Her name is Franziska von Karma. The daughter of my mentor, Manfred von Karma, she, like myself, is a prosecutor.) Are you heading up this case? It would be a bit of a relief if you are...\nFranziska:\nDon't you try to flatter me! Miles Edgeworth... I'm placing you under arrest.\nEdgeworth:\nWh... What!?\nFranziska:\nIt's quite frustrating, actually. I had hoped to exact my revenge on you in a different venue... ...but I'll have to take what I can get. I never thought I'd see the day... ...when a disciple of the house of Von Karma would become a criminal! Have you no shame!?\nEdgeworth:\nWait! It has all been a big misunderstanding! I didn't kill the victim!\nFranziska:\nA misunderstanding!? I heard all about the murder over the police radio from the captain himself. You waited for the victim on the first floor, and then beat him to death.\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska, do you honestly believe that I killed a man?\nFranziska:\n.................. I suppose I should reserve judgement until after I have investigated this for myself. I can put your arrest on hold until then.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's as it should be.\nFranziska:\nHah! I don't need a lecture on how to perform my duties from you of all people. \"To be perfect in every way.\" The fulfillment of that creed alone is all I strive for!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I have my own creed which I must fulfill, so why don't we solve this together?\nFranziska:\n...I have to get going. The crime scene awaits. Don't you dare leave town.\nEdgeworth:\nTrust me, I had no intention to.\nFranziska:\nDetective Gumshoe!\n???:\nYes, sir!\nFranziska:\nToo slow!\nGumshoe:\nOwww!\nFranziska:\nListen up. I'm leaving you in charge of watching this man. Don't mess up, understand!?\nGumshoe:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth!? I'm supposed to guard him!?\nFranziska:\nA simple yes or no, Detective!\nGumshoe:\nAck! Yes, sir! Understood, sir! You just leave it to me!\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth. If you interfere with my investigation, I'll arrest you on the spot. Are we clear? Now then, if you'll excuse me.\nGumshoe:\nGood to see you again, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Boy am I glad to see you're OK!\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nI believe in you, sir! You can lean on me! I'll get you through this!\nEdgeworth:\n(I have to admit I'm a bit curious as to what Franziska is up to. Maybe I should ask the good detective...) Very well. In that case, I have a few questions for you.\nApproach gate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I should try to get some information out of Detective Gumshoe first.)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo how is the initial investigation going?\nGumshoe:\nWe just shipped the body off to the coroner's office... ...and we're taking statements now, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nThat sounds like Franziska. She was always good at quick responses to a case.\nGumshoe:\nI'd say she was, uh... a little too quick, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nOh? How so?\nGumshoe:\nUh... Um...! I rushed on over as soon as I got word of the affair, sir! But somehow, when I got here... ...Ms. von Karma was already here barking out orders at everyone! It was kinda creepy! As though she knew there had been a murder or something... ...and had come in advance to await your flight's arrival!\nEdgeworth:\n(That is sort of odd. She did show up rather quickly, and out of the blue. Plus, I still don't know why she's here in America... There must be some backstory to all of this.)\n\n\n\n\nFranziska von Karma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nMs. von Karma just kinda popped up at the Prosecutor's Office about a week ago, sir. Something about chasing down leads related to a certain incident...\nEdgeworth:\nNo details?\nGumshoe:\nIt's kinda top-secret, so she can't talk about it, even with me, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Knowing her, the only type of talking she likes to do is with her whip. Plus, I doubt the top-secret part was what stopped her from talking to you, Detective. Although, I wonder if her case has anything to do with mine...?)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey, Mr. Edgeworth, I think something just fell out of your pocket.\nEdgeworth:\nHm? What are you.........gnrk!\nGumshoe:\nS-So did something fall out or not? I didn't, um, get a good look, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n...It doesn't concern you, so don't worry about it. (My Prosecutor's Badge, of all things! Gumshoe must never know that I dropped it!)\n\n\n\n\nCaptain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) Piggy Bank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWh-Wh-Wh-What is this... this raccoon-looking thing!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's not a raccoon. It's the mascot of GoYou (changed from [iFly] in the original release) Airlines. His name is Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release), and apparently, he's supposed to be a monkey.\nGumshoe:\nOoooooooooh! I'm feeling some inspiration coming ooooooon! I'm going to make a piggy bank out of the police mascot, the Blue Badger! Then, whenever there's any loose change lying around the precinct, it can go in there!\nEdgeworth:\nSure, sounds great. (...As long as it isn't any of my money.)\n\n\n\n\nGoYou (changed from [iFly] in the original release) Suitcase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nSo! This design! It's so post-modern, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n...Post-modern, you say?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, especially this alien-shaped handle here. You can really feel a connection.\nEdgeworth:\n...A connection. Right. Detective, please stop with your horrible impression of an art critic.\nGumshoe:\nBut I was only telling you my honest feelings, sir...\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe, this is...\nGumshoe:\nOh! Is that for me!? Aww, you shouldn't have, sir! But I'll gladly take anything you want to give to me!\nEdgeworth:\nHands off, Detective! This item is related to the case!\nGumshoe:\nO-Oh... So, um, what about it did you want to ask me about...?\nEdgeworth:\n...Forget I asked, Detective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoy by window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis child seems to be happily enjoying the sight of so many planes.\nBoy:\nWow!!! I'd love to take a run down that runway!\nEdgeworth:\n............Oh, the youth of today. So much potential, yet so misguided.\n\n\n\n\nMan in blue by window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHm?

He was quite shaken up by the whole affair.\nPassenger:\n*quiver*... I... I did it... I made it the whole flight... I'm not scared of turbulence anymore!\nEdgeworth:\nHe must have been pretty scared. He's repeating the same thing over and over to himself.\n\n\n\n\nMan in green or vendor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... \"Lunchland\"... Not bad. I guess it's gotten big enough to warrant its own branch shops.\nCustomer:\nHmm... Which should I go with?\nVendor:\nI recommend our airport special, World Flags Lunchboxes! Only available for a limited time! We have a variety of lunchboxes made up to look like different countries' flags!\nEdgeworth:\n...I wonder if they're aiming to take Lunchland to the international market?\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI can't believe there's no one manning the counter when a murder has just occurred.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat a view of the planes preparing for takeoff. Besides the turbulence, they're really not all that bad as a mode of transportation.\nAfter clearing all Talk options with Dick Gumshoe:\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, that's about all the info I have, sir. We should find out more as we investigate.\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, it is high time to resume my investigation. Starting with talking to the people involved in this case afresh.)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoy by window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis child seems to be happily enjoying the sight of so many planes.\nGumshoe:\nI'm all excited to see this many planes, too! Just look at the size of these things!\nBoy:\nDo you like planes, too, mister? The balance between the main wings and the tail wings is really something, huh!?\nEdgeworth:\nHah... It seems that this child derives his pleasure from a different aspect.\nGumshoe:\nOh, but I've also got a thing for the shape of the wings, too!\nBoy:\nHere, mister! You can stand next to me! So about that plane's wing...\nEdgeworth:\n(Tsk! Thank you, Detective, for leaving me out of this conversation!)\n\n\n\n\nMan in blue by window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHm? Looking from behind...

I made it the whole flight... I'm not scared of turbulence anymore! *quiver*... This life vest is proof I made it alive. It's now my prized possession.\nEdgeworth:\n...How could you just take that from the plane!?\nGumshoe:\nIt's OK, Mr. Edgeworth. It's got nothing to do with the murder, at least.\n\n\n\n\nMan in green or vendor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... \"Lunchland\"... Not bad.

Thanks! Alright, then I'm really gonna get one! Here I go! Excuse me, miss! I'll take a Star-Spangled Banner Lunchbox, please!\nEdgeworth:\n(...I hope he's aware that's the most expensive one on the menu.)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI can't believe there's no one manning the counter when a murder has just occurred.\nGumshoe:\nRelax, Mr. Edgeworth!

I don't even have a passport! But I've been saving up for that eventual \"someday\"!

I bet the victim used this suitcase as his hiding place!\nEdgeworth:\n...Ex-Excuse me?\nGumshoe:\nYou know! To stow away onto this flight, sir! He must've been inside all along! But someone found him out, and that's when *bam!* he was killed! Actually, that was the plot of a movie I saw recently...!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. Get your head out of the theater and back into reality!\n\n\n\n\nBlood in corner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat's the victim's blood... Right, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nI suspect so, but we won't know much more until it's been processed by forensics.\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's a good thing no one wanted to buy this suitcase!\nEdgeworth:\n...How so?\nGumshoe:\nImagine the shock on their face when they go to open it and out pops a dead body!\nEdgeworth:\n...I suppose.

And who might you be?\nFranziska:\nI am the Prodigy Prosecutor, Franziska von Karma, and I have a few questions for you.\nMeele:\nAhhh, don't you dare, Captain! Getting friendly with another woman... I'll never forgive you if you do!\nCaptain:\nWh-What are you talking about? I-I only have eyes for you, my dear Cammy!\nEdgeworth:\n(I wouldn't bet money on our dear captain to be much of a reputable person.)\nGumshoe:\nSure you don't want to ask the captain some questions, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nHe was in the cockpit the entire time. I highly doubt he would know anything of use. Anyway, I like to leave that type of witness to Franziska and her whip.\nCaptain:\nAaaaaaaaah!!!\nMarch 12, 1:40 PM\nFlight G-390 (changed from [I-390] in the original release), First Floor - Lounge\n???:\nNow see here!!!\nGumshoe:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!

No one is allowed to enter without Ms. von Karma's express permission.\nEdgeworth:\nBut I'm on the case...\nOfficer:\nYes, I understand that, but... ...I also have explicit instructions not to let you through from Ms. von Karma.\nEdgeworth:\n(Grrr... Why would you do this to me, Franziska...?)\n\n\n\n\nZinc Lablanc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDid you finish taking his statement yet?\nGumshoe:\nYup, all done, sir.\nLablanc:\nI do not concern if you're not done examining the cargo hold.

What sort of art?\nGumshoe:\nMr. Lablanc is an art dealer, so he's got a bunch of artwork down in the cargo hold, sir. There's practically a mountain of them, large and small.\nLablanc:\nFrom folk costumes to stone statues, I sell all kinds of arts!\nEdgeworth:\n(Folk costumes...? Speaking of which, Mr. Lablanc's hat... It kind of looks like that other piece of cloth...)\n\n\n\n\nRhoda Teneiro (appears after presenting Bloody Cloth)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"What did you mean by 'that attendant', Mr. Lablanc?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLablanc:\nYou! I can say you have the guts to show me a piece of art at this time. But from a single glance I can already tell it is mostly worthless.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hah. This has much more value as a piece of non-art, I assure you.)\nLablanc:\nYou look like you have something to say! Perhaps you are thinking, \"like casting pearls before swine\"?\nEdgeworth:\n(He actually hit the nail on the head for once!)\n\n\n\n\nMr. Hicks's Travel Wallet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLablanc:\nAh, so you are finally paying my wasted money?\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, but there is absolutely nothing inside this wallet.\nLablanc:\nHow dare you!

I hope not, but in case you are, there is a certain lawyer I can introduce you to.\n\n\n\n\nBloody Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Lablanc, can you please take a look at this for me?\nLablanc:\nHm?

When can I have my cargo moved!?\nGumshoe:\nYou can get your cargo back when we're done investigating, pal!\nLablanc:\nThe stubbornness of you police, it is no good!

When can I have my cargo moved!?\nGumshoe:\nYou can get your cargo back when we're done investigating, pal!\nLablanc:\nThe stubbornness of you police, it is no good! And it is no good that attendant refuses to exit the attendants' room, too!\nEdgeworth:\nThat attendant...? (I wonder if he's talking about Ms. Teneiro?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLablanc:\nWhat is it!? Do you have some use for me? You seem not to understand; I have no time to waste! Let me put it another way! \"Le temps, c'est de l'argent!\" There! Maybe another language will get through your head!\nEdgeworth:\n(I understood you perfectly fine in English.)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficer:\nSir, you can't go in there.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm Miles Edgeworth. I am one of the prosecutors on this case, so please let me through.\nOfficer:\nI'm very sorry, sir. No one is allowed to enter without Ms. von Karma's express permission.\nEdgeworth:\nBut I'm on the case...\nOfficer:\nYes, I understand that, but... ...I also have explicit instructions not to let you through from Ms. von Karma.\nEdgeworth:\n(Grrr... Why would you do this to me, Franziska...?)\n\n\n\n\nPiano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThey've got a piano on this plane!? Hey! Do you think I can try it out, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nI'd think you would know better than to randomly touch things at a crime scene, Detective! Besides, I didn't know you knew how to play.\nGumshoe:\nOf course I do! I'm practically proficient!\nEdgeworth:\n(Interesting... The things you learn about people on a daily basis.)\nGumshoe:\nI can get Do and Re to come out just right, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nTwo notes does not a proficient pianist make, Detective.\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh, man... there's a really pretty lady in that plane over there. Aaaaaaack! She's looking over here! Quick, sir! Wave at her with me, please!\nEdgeworth:\nI refuse to be your wingman on this!\n\n\n\n\nMagazine rack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There are a few copies of Sky Magazine in the magazine rack.)\nGumshoe:\nThis month's special... Oh, looks like it's an English trivia quiz. Oh, I've got one! What starts with \"i\" and means \"boldly rude\" and \"disrespectful\"?\nEdgeworth:\n(The answer is most definitely \"insolent\".)\nGumshoe:\nTime's up! Sorry, sir, but the correct answer is \"insolvent\"!\nEdgeworth:\n(Detective Gumshoe... Don't tell me your English ability is at the same level as \"him\"...)\n\n\n\n\nStatue to left of elevator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey! This statue...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about it, Detective? Did you notice something?\nGumshoe:\nI saw this guy in a dream last night! The resemblance is uncanny, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nYou saw him in your dreams?\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah. I saw him, and then I arrested him! I wanted to show you just how vital I am in our partnership!\nEdgeworth:\n(Being useful in your sleep is of no help to me in the real world, Detective.)\n\n\n\n\nPolice line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLooks like we can't go beyond here, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Plus, the body has been sent off to the medical examiner's office for an autopsy.)\n\n\n\n\nChair on ground next to table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nAh! Mr. Edgeworth! You have to see this chair!! It says, \"In honor of Rocker Pals' Day\".\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what exactly is the big deal with these \"Rocker Pals\"?\nGumshoe:\nThey're a seriously sweet Swiss super-star rock band, sir! Ah... Makes me wanna listen to one of their songs right now.\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, I got lost in that forest of s's just now...\nGumshoe:\nDo you want me to explain it to you again?\nEdgeworth:\nYou know, Detective, I think I'll have to take a raincheck on that, regrettably.\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorginian Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloodstain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nFor there to be this much blood on this piece of cloth... Was the victim wrapped in it at some point? According to Mr. Lablanc, this textile is fairly famous.\nGumshoe:\nWhat a waste...\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice anything?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAnything of interest, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, well, I can say that I don't quite know everything about the situation yet... ...so I was just telling myself that I should go ask someone about the stuff I don't know! I mean, just because I don't know it doesn't mean someone else might not know it, right!?\nEdgeworth:\n(It must be my imagination, but for a second, I think I actually understood his logic!)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat did you mean by \"that attendant\", Mr. Lablanc?\nLablanc:\nShe was taken into the attendants' room for her interview. And then they still have not come out! They make no sign of coming out either! I was finished with my own interview much earlier, quicker than her!\nEdgeworth:\n(Why is Ms. Teneiro's interview the only one that's taking up so much time...?)\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth. You were given free reign [sic] to examine the plane, weren't you?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I was able to obtain the cooperation of the flight attendants. Speaking of attendants, I'd like to speak with Ms. Teneiro. I wonder if you might grant me permission to enter the flight attendants' room?\nFranziska:\nHmph. Before I do... ...you still have to clear up a few issues surrounding your own circumstances.\nEdgeworth:\n...I understand.\nFranziska:\nYou may have tricked those attendants with your sophisticated talking... ...but you can't pull the wool over my eyes, Miles Edgeworth.\nArgument\n-- Franziska's Logic --\nFranziska:\nLet's not complicate things and go with the most obvious conclusion.\nThe scene of the crime was here, in the very lounge the body was discovered.\nFrom the time the victim was seen calling for an attendant until his body was found...\n...the only person in this lounge the entire time was you, Miles Edgeworth!\nThis, unmistakably, makes you the likeliest suspect.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. The \"likeliest suspect\", Franziska?\nFranziska:\nDo you have a problem with that?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, but it's not like you to use such vague wording. You're usually a bit more... absolute.\nFranziska:\nI'm simply trying to watch out for you. Or is my kindness too hard for you to comprehend?\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, but your leniency is unnecessary, for I will prove my innocence soon enough! (If I want to continue my investigation, I'll have to break her line of logic, fast!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Don't you think you're being a bit rash by simply declaring me the culprit? Franziska: Hmph. I like my affairs to be simple. And perfect. I'll show you the meaning of both when I finish this whole thing within three minutes! Gumshoe: Hey! You say that like you're cooking a pack of instant noodles! Threeeeooooooowww! Franziska: I won't allow even three seconds of useless testimony to be uttered in my presence! Edgeworth: (...I see she hasn't changed a bit. But I won't allow her to send me to prison so easily.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So tell me, Franziska, do you know all there is to know about the crime scene? Franziska: I know all that I need to know in order to arrest you. Edgeworth: And nothing more? Franziska: .........Are you saying there is more I need to know!? Gumshoe: Aaaaaaaaah! Wh-Why did you whip me, sir!? Franziska: Sorry, Scruffy. My hand must've slipped. Edgeworth: (It would appear that Franziska doesn't have all the facts of this case yet.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: What do you mean by \"seen\"? Franziska: Please stop pretending like you don't know. It's insulting. Obviously, I'm talking about how Mr. Hicks was seen calling for an attendant at 5 AM. And then, from the time after that call until the body was found...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: While it's true that I was in the lounge the whole time... ...that fact alone does not make me the criminal. Franziska: Franziska: Hah, we'll see about that at the conclusion of this investigation. However, there is one thing that even you must admit at this time.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Under the circumstances, I suppose I can agree that I am the most likely suspect. Gumshoe: B-But I believe in you, sir! I don't think you did it! Ms. von Karma's gotta believe that, too, right! I mean, you two are like siblings...OWWWW! Franziska: Quiet, Scruffy! Even if we were related by blood, that's no guarantee that he's not a criminal! Edgeworth: .........Franziska... Franziska: I demand to see some proof that you are not the guilty party!\nEdgeworth: (The likeliest suspect, huh. What a roundabout euphemism. But it would appear that she doesn't yet know... ...about the new evidence that we acquired, and where we acquired it. I'll take care of the gaps in her logic one hole at a time.)",

A piece that proves that the body was moved from a different location!\nFranziska:\n.........\nEdgeworth:\nThe killer used this suitcase to move the victim's body. Meaning that the real scene of the crime is not this lounge at all!\nFranziska:\nFranziska:\nNow who's the one rashly jumping to conclusions?\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nFranziska:\nAll you did was find this piece of cloth inside the suitcase. That doesn't prove that the body was moved. It could be that the killer simply chose that suitcase as a good place to hide the cloth.\nEdgeworth:\nI expected you would come to that conclusion. It would seem I can't escape that easily.\nFranziska:\nYou should know better than that. A Von Karma is perfect in every way.\nEdgeworth:\nAh, but did you know that the killer definitely wheeled the suitcase around at some point?\nFranziska:\nFranziska:\nAs if there is proof of that!\nEdgeworth:\n(Where is the proof that this suitcase was moved around?)\nPresent Grape Juice Footprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The spilled grape juice in front of the elevator...\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAll it takes is one look at this and you'll have your answer!\nFranziska:\nIndeed, I have my answer now. ......That you are an ignorant whippersnapper!\nEdgeworth:\nAaaaaaaargh! (And you're just an (changed from [Or rather, that you are the] in the original release) unforgiving whipper-snapper. The suitcase ended up in the in-flight shop, but where did it come from? The answer should become clear if I just think about the path the killer took.)\nLeads back to:\n\"Where is the proof that this suitcase was moved around?\"\nFranziska:\nThe spilled grape juice in front of the elevator...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, and I'd like to draw your attention to this area here...

Give me any unrelated evidence, and you will feel the pain of my whip.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's no need to remind me; my body learned that lesson well a long time ago! These prints are important, but there is something else that is even more so!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Where is the evidence that proves the killer dragged the suitcase through here?\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nTake a look at this!\nFranziska:\nAnd what exactly am I looking at here?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't like to repeat myself... ...but I suppose it can't be helped if you didn't spot it on your own. Now then, I'll...\nFranziska:\nGet on with it and tell me the answer already.\nEdgeworth:\n(...I wonder if she saw through my blunder?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Where is the evidence that proves the killer dragged the suitcase through here?\"\nEdgeworth:\nThis mark here... Wouldn't you say that it looks suspiciously like tracks from two wheels?\nFranziska:\nI suppose.\nEdgeworth:\nFurther, there is also grape juice residue on the wheels of the suitcase. This means that the suitcase containing the victim's body definitely passed through here.\nFranziska:\n.........I suppose this means that the killer... ...did move the victim's body from somewhere else.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm glad you've come to your senses.\nFranziska:\nFranziska:\nNot so fast! This still doesn't put you in the clear! Not by a long shot!\nArgument\n-- Franziska's Logic, Pt. 2 --\nFranziska:\nYou prepared yourself and acquired the piggy bank before the plane hit that turbulence.\nAnd then, you waited for the victim in the lounge, where you beat him to death.\nThen, while you were in the elevator with the victim's body stuffed into the suitcase...\n...the plane hit that patch of turbulence, and out flew the body from within the suitcase!\nWith no way out, you hastily put the suitcase back where you had taken it from...\n...and pretended to be the \"discoverer\" of the body.\nEdgeworth:\nNot a bad bit of logic, for something you thought of on the fly.\nFranziska:\nJust what are you insinuating?\nEdgeworth:\nThat I will show you exactly how flawed your logic is. (No matter how strong of a face you put on, not even you can hide your fears from me. I'll expose the flaws in her logic in one fell swoop!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: And how do you suppose I was able to take the piggy bank out of its display case? As I recall, the case was locked. Franziska: That's easy. If the case was locked... ...you simply had to hit the glass... like this! Gumshoe: Eeeeeoww! Y-You've shattered my heart of glass! Edgeworth: (So she wants to talk about the in-flight shop and the Captain Ugo (changed from [Mr. Ifly] in the original release) bank, does she...?) Franziska: That takes care of how you obtained the murder weapon.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I thought there wasn't any of the victim's blood found in the lounge. Franziska: Hmph. I thought you'd say that. What? Did you think I wouldn't have noticed? I think you just found a way to cleverly hide the blood splatter in the lounge! By \"accidentally spilling\" grape juice on top of it! Edgeworth: Gnrgh! Are you accusing me of tampering with the crime scene now!? Franziska: We'll see, won't we? The forensic scientists are hard at work on that as we speak. Edgeworth: .........And? What do you propose I did after that?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So I put the victim's body into the suitcase, and then? Where was I headed, Franziska? Franziska: That's pretty obvious. You were bringing it to First Class where you could safely keep an eye on it! Edgeworth: We're talking about this thing, you know. I'd hardly call it discreet or ordinary. Franziska: Hmph. Annoying brat. Well then, you were intending to leave it inside the elevator. But unfortunately for you, a wrench was thrown into your plans, because...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You've experienced turbulence on a flight before. Franziska: Of course. Many times. You get used to it after a while. Edgeworth: The patch we hit was especially rough... and I passed out briefly, but only for a second. Gumshoe: Good thing it was only for a sec, sir! It'd been bad if you had really blanked out! Edgeworth: Y...Yes, indeed. (Unfortunately, blanking out is exactly what got me into this mess in the first place.) Franziska: That's enough of your idle chatter. I'm not through with you yet, Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph... If I really were a criminal, do you really think I would be so easily caught? Franziska: Franziska: You are certainly in the middle of being caught right now! Edgeworth: Gnaaaaaaargh! (I have to find a contradiction fast or I won't have much of my own hide left to save!) Franziska: I have to say, you are looking rather caught right now. And I'll tell you exactly what you did after that. You loitered around in the lounge...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I didn't pretend to be anything! I really was the first to discover the victim's body! Franziska: ...I suppose that's true. Edgeworth: Hm...? So then... you are yielding to my statements? Franziska: Don't be foolish! I still insist that you are the killer, but... ...in that sense, you really were the first to \"discover the body to be dead.\" Edgeworth: (...No matter what I say, she seems dead set on making me out to be the killer.)\nEdgeworth: (Her logic is reasonably sound... ...and the large majority of it reflects the truth... ...but there is one point about it that is not quite right.)",

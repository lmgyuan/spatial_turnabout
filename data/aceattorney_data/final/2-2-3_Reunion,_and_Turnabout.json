I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini?Maya:I finally get to see you again, and...Phoenix:It's not your fault. You didn't do it.Maya:No, I... I did it... I killed that person.Phoenix:But that wasn't you.Maya:It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me.Phoenix:(I can't believe something like this happened...The events of that gloomy, rainy afternoon that started this whole mess...keep playing through my mind...)Episode 2Reunion, and TurnaboutJune 16, 3:34 PMWright & Co. Law Offices???:What depressing rain... Do you understand how depressed that makes me!? Do you!?Phoenix:Uh, I guess...???:But actually, more than being depressed, I'm angry. Angry at that weather girl on TV. \"I think our little rainy spell will take a break with a day of sun!\"...is what that girl said! I'd stake my life on it!Phoenix:Well, it's the weather...???:But that's why I didn't bother to bring an umbrella today. What nerve, calling herself a weather girl! She's going to hear about my $1500 suit!Phoenix:Um... About your case... Unless you're planning on suing the weather girl...????:... I'm sorry. I thought that before we got down to business, we could have some friendly chatter. My name is Dr. Turner Grey. I'm a surgeon.Phoenix:(Remind me never to end up under his knife...)Grey:I'm here today because of this incident.Phoenix:\"Malpractice at Grey Surgical Clinic. Fourteen In-Patients Lose Their Lives!\" ...Oh. You're... the doctor at...?Grey:It's really quite upsetting. Did you hear me!? UPSETTING!Phoenix:Yes, yes, I heard you. I agree, it's quite upsetting, Dr. Grey.Grey:The one that screwed up was that nurse! It was her that got the medications mixed up and killed those 14 patients! And yet! Now listen good! And yet! That nurse had the nerve to go and die before admitting to her wrongdoing! She didn't even offer any sort of explanation to me! And this is the kicker! She up and has herself a grand ol' accident and crashed her car! Smash! Crunch! Instantly transforming her car into the accordion model!Phoenix:(That's right... About a year ago, all the tabloid shows were talking about it. Fourteen victims of medical malpractice and the nurse's mysterious fatal accident. There were rumors that Dr. Grey had actually caused that crash. People said it was to forever hide the person responsible for the malpractice incident.)Grey:Why would I...? Now, I'm just going to say this once -- Why on Earth would I want to kill that nurse? She's the one who killed those 14 patients! Not me!Phoenix:I think you need to take a deep breath, doctor, and focus... More to the point, this case is over a year old. Why bring it up now...?Grey:That's simple! Because the situation is slipping out of my grasp. This just won't do. My clinic isn't seeing nearly as many patients nowadays. Do you understand what that means!? It means they're not coming to my clinic!Phoenix:(You don't say...? If it were me, I don't think I'd want to go either.) So... what would you like me to do about it...?Grey:I want you to help me prove I'm innocent.Phoenix:Um, you do realize I'm a lawyer, not a private investigator, right?Grey:No, this is something only you can do.Phoenix:...?Grey:Maya Fey. You know this girl, correct?Phoenix:...! (Maya! Why would he know her name...!?)Grey:I heard you were working under her for a little while.Phoenix:Well, yes... I mean... Hey, wait a second here! I worked UNDER her!?Grey:Yes. Am I wrong? She told me, so I'm not quite sure if...Phoenix:Well, we worked a few trials together. But she went back to her hometown to undergo more training.Grey:Ah, yes, I heard. It must be lonely for you.Phoenix:Wh-What!? Wait... I'm not...!Grey:She must be an extraordinary girl to handle such rigid training.Phoenix:Huh?Grey:I have an acquaintance who knows a lot about these mystical sorts of things. She's the one who introduced me to Ms. Fey.Phoenix:(Is Maya... really that famous...?)Grey:And I've already set up an appointment.Phoenix:For what?Grey:What else!? A channeling! I'm going to have her call the spirit of that nurse that went and got herself killed!Phoenix:O-Oh. (Maya... I wonder what she's up to right now...)Maya:We, the women of the Fey clan have always been spirit mediums. (Changed from [We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums.] in the original release) It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us.Phoenix:(That's what she told me... I guess she's learned to accept her responsibilities and become an adult...)Grey:Not counting training, this will be her first time channeling a spirit, so she gave me one condition before accepting my request.Phoenix:A condition...?Grey:The condition is you, Mr. Wright. She said that she wouldn't do the channeling without first seeing you again.Phoenix:Me...?Grey:And that is why I've searched you out! You want to see her too, don't you!?Phoenix:(And so... that is how I ended up visiting Maya's hometown with the doctor...)June 19, 1:25 PMKurain VillagePhoenix:(So this is Kurain Village; Maya's hometown.)???:...Phoenix:W-Why, hello there.???:...Phoenix:Hmm... What an odd little girl.???:Hey! Wait up, Pearly!!Phoenix:(Hm? Someone else is coming this way...)???:Niiiiiiiick!Phoenix:M-Maya. How are you...? It's good to see you again.Maya:Wow, I didn't think you'd really show up!Phoenix:It's not that big a deal. You made it sound like you were soooo far away.Maya:Well, maybe I exaggerated... just a little.Phoenix:It was only 2 hours by train. If I had known you were this close, I'd have visited more.Maya:No! You're not allowed. I already decided, you know. Until I become an adult, I have to work hard and be strong by myself...Phoenix:Oh... well... Anyway, congratulations. I'm glad to hear training is going well for you.Maya:Heh, heh...ExaminePhone boothPhoenix:It's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. My cell phone doesn't get reception up here, so who knows. I may need it later.Bus shelterPhoenix:An old bus stop. It says \"Kurain Village\" on the sign post. The buses seem incredibly inconvenient since they only come 3 times a day.Giant rockPhoenix:A giant rock that seems to be reaching for the sky. Its origins are written on a beat-up, old sign. It looks like this giant rock is called the \"Kurain Boulder\". There's a really complex explanation written here, but long story short, it's a big stone for spirits to live in... Or something like that...Road and houses furtherPhoenix:Rustic, thatch-roofed houses where the other villagers live line the street. They're nowhere near as large or as nice as the manor in front of me. It's kind of odd that I don't see any of the other villagers walking around, though...Fey ManorPhoenix:The biggest, most elegant of the buildings I can see from here. This is Fey Manor; the place Maya calls home. It's easy to be overwhelmed by its presence...TalkToday's channelingPhoenix:Looks like you've finally become a full-fledged medium, taking on your first job.Maya:Yeah. I didn't think it would be this soon.Phoenix:But this case... Do you know the messy story behind it...?Maya:Ha ha ha, behold the power of the Maya Intelligence Network! Let's see. Fourteen people died because of malpractice on Dr. Grey's part, right? And to pin the blame on the nurse, he killed her in what appeared to be a car accident!Phoenix:Huh? Um, so what is this \"Maya Intelligence Network\" anyway...?Maya:The tabloids.Phoenix:That's what I thought.Maya:... Ha ha ha. I'm just pulling your leg, Nick! What really happened is the exact opposite. I heard all about it from Dr. Grey.Phoenix:...Maya:Oh, come on, Nick! I wouldn't take a crazed killer as a client! That's too scary, even for me.Phoenix:(Y-Yeah, I guess so.)Kurain VillagePhoenix:So this is your hometown, huh, Maya?Maya:Yup! Kurain Village... But I've heard people call this place \"Medium Valley\", too.Phoenix:Interesting... So everyone that lives here is a spirit medium?Maya:Pretty much. Most of my ancestors were too, I think...Phoenix:(That's probably true since the Fey ability to communicate with the dead is so strong...)Maya:Actually, only the women of this village are mediums.Phoenix:So what do the men do?Maya:They usually work someplace outside the village.The girl earlierPhoenix:Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you about that girl I saw earlier. Do you know her?Maya:Oh, you mean Pearly?Phoenix:Pearly?Maya:Pearl Fey. She's my cousin. Isn't she adorable? Just like yours truly!Phoenix:Cousin... Wait, then that means... Is she also a...?Maya:Yup. She's a medium, too. Pearly's a real genius when it comes to channeling!Phoenix:Hmm, I see. I hope I didn't scare her when I tried to talk to her earlier.Maya:Nah, it's not you. My aunt drilled it into her head that \"if a suspicious-looking person tries to talk to you, run away\".Phoenix:S-Suspicious-looking...!?Maya:Well, you're not wearing training clothes, for starters...Phoenix:Of course not.Maya:Pearly is my aunt's most valued treasure, so she's not allowed to go outside of town. She doesn't know much about the world outside of Kurain Village.Phoenix:Aunt?Maya:Pearly's mother is my aunt, duh. Come on, Nick.PresentAttorney's BadgeMaya:Ah, it's good to see this tarnished badge again.Phoenix:What do you mean by \"tarnished\"...?Maya:Well, look. This badge is like every other. It's bound to lose its color and shine after years and years. But you know, polishing it up once in a while wouldn't be a bad idea.Maya Fey profileMaya:Ha ha ha. I'm warning you! I'm not the same weak Maya you knew a year ago, Nick!Phoenix:You seem to have a lot of faith in yourself.Maya:You'll see soon enough. I think you'll be totally shocked by how good my hamburgers are now!Phoenix:(Were you training to be a medium or a cook?)Turner Grey profileMaya:Hey, it's my client!Phoenix:\"Client,\" huh? You're really serious about your work, aren't you?Maya:I thought I'd say it once, just to try it out, like how you always say, \"My client.\"Any other evidenceMaya:Hmm, nothing really comes to mind, Nick.Phoenix:Don't say that with such a big smile on your face.Maya:Ha ha. What can I say? I'm in a good mood today.Any other profilePhoenix:What do you think about this person?Maya:Hey, have I told you this one yet, Nick? We have a legend in this village. It goes like this. \"All the woman of the Fey clan are beauties.\" Well?Phoenix:...And that's a legend now?After clearing all Talk options:Maya:Well, Nick, I've got to get going. It's about time for the channeling to start.Phoenix:Huh? Oh, yeah...Maya:I'm doing the channeling in my house, so come on in, OK? After I'm done, we can grill up some juicy burgers!Phoenix:Alright. Good luck, Maya.Maya:Thanks!Phoenix:(Well... At least she's still the same perky Maya.)June 19Fey ManorMeditation RoomGrey:Ah, Mr. Wright. I'm so glad you showed.Phoenix:Some nice weather we're having today. Aren't you happy?Grey:No, not at all. That stupid weather girl made the wrong call again. \"It will rain cats and dogs today!\" she said with a straight face. I can't believe they allow such misguided reports on the public airwaves!Phoenix:(Looks like talking about the weather with this guy is just asking for punishment...)Grey:...But anyway, this is a splendid manor.Phoenix:(No argument there... It's hard to believe that this is Maya's house, though...)Grey:I was given a guidemap to this building. Here, Mr. Wright. I have a copy for you too.Guidemap added to the Court Record.ExamineDoorPhoenix:A door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. It looks like there is a strong lock on this door to top it off.Writing on top of the doorPhoenix:Someone with a lot of skill wrote these four Chinese characters with a brush. Oh look, here's a translation: \"Once in a Lifetime.\" Its message is people should value their ghostly meetings as once in a lifetime chances.Blue boardPhoenix:A piece of cloth with a ton of finely-written characters jammed onto it. Probably esoteric knowledge only mediums should know. ...Hmm, let's see... Here's one in English... It says... \"100 Ways to Save Money\". ... Being a medium sounds like a rough way of life...Door to the Winding WayPhoenix:This door leads out to the Winding Way. The weather outside looks really nice.TalkToday's channelingPhoenix:What are you going to do once the nurse's spirit has been called?Grey:Isn't it obvious? I'm going to have her write a signed confession.Phoenix:A signed confession?Grey:Yes, a confession. Pay attention! I'll have her write this: \"One year ago, on May 2nd, 14 patients died due to my negligence. And then, on May 24th, I fell asleep at the wheel and died in a car accident due to my further negligence. I'm sorry and I apologize for being negligent.\" That's what I'll have her write! With a confession, the rain falling on my soul can finally stop.Phoenix:O-Oh, I see...MayaPhoenix:So, how did you hear about Maya Fey...?Grey:I heard about her from an acquaintance; a girl studying the occult at the college. That girl introduced me to this village. This is the home of the Kurain School of Channeling.Phoenix:The home, huh...?Grey:And Ms. Maya is a daughter of the \"Master\", I hear.Phoenix:Master...?Grey:Anyway, do you see that door? That's the room where people and spirits meet. Ms. Maya's aunt is in there right now. Would you care to meet her...?PresentAttorney's BadgePhoenix:Look, here's my attorney's badge.Grey:Are you trying to compete with me and my profession with that piece of scrap?Phoenix:...Uh...Grey:I am a surgeon. Compared to you lawyers, I'm practically a saint! Yes, well, I don't exactly have any patients right now, but, and listen good! I'm not the one that made the mistake!Phoenix:(This doctor needs his head examined...)Guidemap (Fey Manor)Phoenix:Wow, this manor is really nice, don't you think?Grey:Do you honestly think this place is all that impressive? Don't make me laugh.Phoenix:Huh?Grey:This is the countryside. Land here is dirt cheap. I will have something much greater one day! I will build my own grand mansion! Did you hear me!? A grand MANSION! This manor will seem like nothing!Phoenix:(Uh, could you keep that shaking fist away from my face? Thanks...)Maya Fey profileGrey:She's still young, but one day, she'll bear a big responsibility. She'll be the Master, you know. The MASTER!Phoenix:(I guess there are \"Master\" mediums, too...)Morgan Fey profileGrey:That's Ms. Maya's aunt. Earlier, she made me eat some sort of traditional dessert the size of a tea saucer! Hmm, I wonder if Ms. Morgan ever performs channelings herself...?Any other profilePhoenix:What do you have to say about this person, Dr. Grey?Grey:...This person... Hmm... Judging by their face...Phoenix:W-What is it?Grey:They have a weak stomach.Phoenix:R-Really...June 19Fey ManorChanneling ChamberPhoenix:(Wow... It's such a strange atmosphere in here... These flickering lights... I guess they're candles...)???:Good sir! Who might you be...?Phoenix:Aaah! I-I'm, uh, my name is Phoenix Wright...???:Oh... You must be that good sir...Phoenix:(\"Good sir\"...? Is she talking about me?)???:You are a lawyer, are you not, good sir? I have heard much about you from Mystic Maya.Phoenix:Is that so? (\"Mystic\" Maya...?)???:I am Mystic Maya's aunt, Morgan Fey.Phoenix:N-Nice to meet you.Morgan:Ah, I had wanted to speak with you about a certain incident, good sir. It would seem that perhaps you ask too much of Mystic Maya in performing your duties. Most unbecoming, I'm afraid.Phoenix:Huh?Morgan:Don't tell me you have already forgotten? That was it not for Mystic Maya and her assistance, you would surely not have won...Phoenix:(First a girl that runs away, and now an old lady who says I stink at doing my job... When did I become the poster boy for \"How Not to Make a First Impression\"...?)Morgan:The past is the past though. Let us speak of the present now.Phoenix:...Ah, thank you...ExamineDoorPhoenix:The Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. There is a giant iron lock where the handle is. It feels like a curtain that separates the normal world from the spirit one.Floor panels on leftPhoenix:This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air.AltarPhoenix:I guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement.Morgan:Good sir! I wonder if you would please not touch the sacred objects. Those objects are being offered to the spirits. If you were to touch them, good sir, they would become cursed. Yes, cursed.Phoenix:(She really didn't have to talk down to me. I'm not that much of an idiot...)Folding screenPhoenix:This folding screen is really showing its age. All of its edges are a bit tattered. The lettering is fading too. I think I recognize a few of the characters on here... ...Ku ...ra ...in... I'm pretty sure that's what it says... Maybe I'll ask Maya about it later...Space behind folding screenPhoenix:There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark.TalkMayaPhoenix:So why do you add \"Mystic\" to Maya's name. Isn't that a little... strange?Morgan:Good sir!Phoenix:Yes!Morgan:How dare you be so rude and disrespectful towards Mystic Maya!Phoenix:I-I'm sorry.Morgan:She must be addressed by her proper title, good sir. You must call her \"Mystic Maya\"!Phoenix:Um, uh... So, about Mystic Maya... Uh...Morgan:It is the blood.Phoenix:Excuse me? \"Blood\"?Morgan:Mystic Maya carries the blood of the Master. In actuality, she is the only one remaining.Phoenix:(Only one remaining...? What's that supposed to mean?)Morgan:Mystic Maya is the last of the rightful heirs of the Kurain Channeling Technique.Phoenix:OK... Then... where do you stand...?Morgan:That is a little more complicated... Although a woman of the Fey family, I am merely a member of the branch family.Phoenix:...Branch family? What's that?Morgan:It is as it sounds. For a member of the branch family, no matter her spiritual power, she can never become the Master of the Kurain School.Phoenix:So... how strong are you...?Morgan:... It is a shame, however I will admit. I can not even begin to compare the lowliness of my power to the Master's.Phoenix:(So that's how it is...)Today's channelingPhoenix:So today's channeling will be her first?Morgan:Yes, good sir. Because the spirit of a person who dies in a traffic accident is usually very strong, it is usually easier to call that person to our world.Phoenix:(\"Traffic accident\" indeed.)Morgan:The channeling will take place here, in this Channeling Chamber, good sir. As you can see, I am in the process of preparing.Channeling ChamberPhoenix:So... this room is the... Channeling Chamber...?Morgan:The place where a spirit medium speaks with those who have departed.Phoenix:I don't suppose you'd mind if we observed the session...Morgan:Do not even think of such nonsense! Only the medium and the client may enter here.Phoenix:O-Oh.Morgan:The secrets of the Kurain Techniques can not be seen by just anybody.Phoenix:(That never stopped Maya from doing it in front of me before...)Morgan:It is also for your safety, good sir, if something were to go wrong. That is why, while channeling is being performed, that heavy door is securely locked...Phoenix:Oh, that's what the lock is for...PresentMaya Fey profileMorgan:Good sir!Phoenix:Y-Yes!Morgan:When did you... take a hidden picture of Mystic Maya!?Phoenix:Wh-Wh-What!? Wait... It's not like that at all!Morgan:It is unforgivable!Phoenix:Ow-ow-ow! (Why did she slap me?)Turner Grey profilePhoenix:About this person...Morgan:Oh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man.Phoenix:Insignificant...?Morgan:That would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir.Phoenix:(Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?)Anything elseMorgan:Good sir!Phoenix:Ack!Morgan:We would like to begin the channeling at 3 o'clock. If you don't mind, good sir, would you mind allowing me to make preparations?Phoenix:Uh, um, sure... go ahead... (She's a Fey alright! Just as odd as the rest.)After clearing all Talk options:Morgan:... Oh, yes. I wonder if you have yet to meet Pearl, good sir.Phoenix:Pearl?Morgan:She is an adorable, angelic young girl.Phoenix:Oh, that odd...Morgan:She is my daughter. Now then, what was it you were about to say...?Phoenix:Wh-What a cute daughter you have... Ahaha...Morgan:A pure heart that knows not of the evils in this world is a powerful thing, good sir. Please refrain from affiliating with her, I request.Phoenix:(Well, it's not like I had the chance to anyway...)Morgan:I must insist and stress that you not let it occur.Phoenix:Okay, okay, I get it!June 19Fey ManorWinding WayPhoenix:(Wow. This garden is really breath-taking. Someone put a lot of love into it. What is that over there...? ...Is that an incinerator? It looks a little out of place in a garden like this...)ExamineGardenPhoenix:A splendid garden with a small lamp and traditional decorations. It's a bit small to walk around in... Although, that incinerator piques my curiosity...IncineratorPhoenix:It's a small incinerator. I don't think garbage trucks come all the way out here to a little village like this. So every family has to burn their own trash.Side roomPhoenix:It looks like there's a room over there, too. A peaceful feeling is emanating from it.UrnPhoenix:It's a really old urn. The ashes of a person long dead are inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on.June 19Fey ManorSide RoomPhoenix:(So this is... the Side Room. Looks like it's more of a break room. There is bedding spread out on the floor. It looks like someone's sleeping in one. I shouldn't disturb them...)ExamineWooden bear sculpturePhoenix:It's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir. So does this mean it's easy to spot bears here... And for them to spot you...? *gulp*AlcovePhoenix:It's a small alcove. I have no idea what it's supposed to mean or symbolize. If I had one of these in the office, it would end up as storage space. But here, it's decorated with some pretty flowers and a beautiful hanging scroll.Sliding doorPhoenix:This is the first time I've seen a sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard.Bed on rightPhoenix:There's bedding spread out on the floor. Is that someone sleeping in one over there? She's probably an exhausted medium taking a break and catching some z's. If I wake her up, she might be grumpy and throw a spell on me. It's probably a good idea to not disturb her sleep...Winding Way (after visiting Side Room and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber)???:Hey! You! Hold on, now! This gal's got a few questions to ask!Phoenix:(Hmm... I'm sure I've heard that southern accent somewhere before...)???:Oh, well I'll be! It's Mr. Phoenix Wright! How ya been!? Haven't seen you in, what, a year!?Phoenix:Um... You... are... uh...Lotta HairPhoenix:Um, Lotta Hair, was it????:L-L-Lotta Who!? Wait, you best not be making fun of my hair, now!Phoenix:Ah, no, um, I wasn't \"making fun\"... I was \"complimenting\" you on your fine hair...???:Hmph, I dare say yer one heartless man, Mr. Wright. It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty. But looks like you already forgot that.Phoenix:Hold up... you were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak...???:Minor detail. Stop being so uptight; lettin' little things get in the way. The name's Hart. Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it!Phoenix:Oh yeah! That's it!Lotta:Now listen here. I'm here to take some pictures today. Gonna get myself a real scoop.Phoenix:Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.Lotta:You betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!?Leads to:\"Oh, that's right!\"Lotta HartPhoenix:You're Lotta Hart, right...?Lotta:Bingo! I'm the one and only \"paranormal photographer\", Lotta Hart!Phoenix:Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.Lotta:Of course! And today, I'm gonna get myself a real scoop! You wait and see!Leads to:\"Oh, that's right!\"Who are you again?Phoenix:Sorry, but who are you again????:Oh Lawdy! I've met some cold men in my days, but you... You're in an icebox of yer own!Phoenix:Come on, am I really that bad...????:Put yer noggin to some use! You've gotta remember who I am! It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty.Phoenix:Ah! You're the one from that trial!???:See, I knew you could remember if you tried!Phoenix:You were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak...???:Why don't we let bygones be bygones, now. It's yesterday's news, right? Name's Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it, ya hear!?Phoenix:Um... So what brings you here today?Lotta:Hah! You should already know! I'm here for the big scoop! I can feel it!Phoenix:Ah, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.Lotta:You betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!?Leads to:\"Oh, that's right!\"Lotta:Oh, that's right! This ain't no time to be wastin' time! The channeling's about to get started!Phoenix:Is it that time already!?Lotta:We all should hurry up and get to the Meditation Room. ...What are you waiting around for!? Come on!Phoenix:(Lotta Hart, huh? I've been judging her harshly because of that case, but, I guess looking back, we had some good times, too...)June 19Fey ManorMeditation RoomMorgan:We will now begin the channeling. Mystic Maya and honored guest, please proceed into the Channeling Chamber.Grey:With this, I can finally swat all those pesky flies, once and for all! You hear me!? They won't be able to say a single bad thing about me after this! You would love to hear them apologize, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:Me!? Oh, uh, yeah, I sure would.Morgan:Mystic Maya, do you have the Channeling Chamber key?Maya:Yup, right here.Morgan:That is most satisfactory. That key is one-of-a-kind, so please take care of it well.Maya:It'll be fine, Aunt Morgan. I won't lose it, trust me! OK, Dr. Grey. Let's get started.Grey:Finally! Let's go!*click*Morgan:Now let us wait patiently out here for them. Please have some lovely bitter green tea and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts...Lotta:Hold on, now, granny!Morgan:...Granny?Lotta:How come we ain't allowed in that room!?Morgan:Dear madam, you have an \"impressive\" grasp of English. From where did you learn it?Lotta:What!? I'm from the heart of the heartland!Morgan:Is that so? Then I humbly request that you return to this \"Heart of the Heartland\".Lotta:Wh-What are ya...?Morgan:This is Kurain Village. If you can not follow our traditions and rules, we request that you leave!Lotta:...! ... Sorry.Phoenix:(Wow. She shut Lotta up! Now THAT's impressive!)Morgan:Now then, let us wait.*BANG*Lotta:Hey now! Wh-What was that just now!?Phoenix:(It came from inside the Channeling Chamber...)*BANG*Lotta:Hey! Th-That's a gunshot!Morgan:E-Excuse me!?Lotta:I've heard that sound before. It's a gunshot! I'd bet my afro on it!Phoenix:(M-Maya! Maya's in there!)Break into the ChamberLotta:Well, Mister Lawyer! What's the plan!?Phoenix:What else!? We're going to break in!Lotta:What!? But... But there's only one key and that kid's got it.Phoenix:We're going to have to break the door. Is that alright, Ms. Fey?Morgan:Well, yes... But there is one matter... That is...Phoenix:Don't try to stop me! You can send the repair bill to the Wright & Co. Law Offices later!Leads to:\"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\"Ask Morgan what to doPhoenix:Ms. Fey! What should we do!?Lotta:Yellow-bellied chicken liver! What are ya waiting for!? Kick it down already!Phoenix:But... The key...Morgan:That key is one-of-a-kind. In this world, there is only that one. Even I am powerless to open that door.Phoenix:(Hmm, there is really no other way...) Alright. Stand aside! I'm going to break the door down!Morgan:W-Wait! Please! That sort of recklessness...Leads to:\"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\"Lotta:Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!*SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!*Phoenix:D-Dr. Grey!!*klik*???:...I... ...I was... murdered...Phoenix:M-Maya????:That man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him...Phoenix:Wh-What!?*klik*Phoenix:Lotta! At a time like this!?Lotta:Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!?Step away from there!Morgan:Please leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police!Phoenix:But, but...Morgan:Hurry! Before there are more victims here!Lotta:Hey, let's go, City Boy! Leave this to the granny!June 19Kurain VillagePhoenix:(My cell phone doesn't get reception way out here...

Lotta doesn't know that when Maya is channeling, her whole physical appearance changes.)Lotta:Then again... Weren't there only the two of 'em in there? I reckon she musta done it then...Dr. GreyPhoenix:Lotta, what do you know about Dr. Grey?Lotta:Not much, but I did some digging... That's one gent with a bad reputation.Phoenix:Really?Lotta:I hear he's good at surgery and stuff, but his personality stinks like wet sheep.Phoenix:(I sort of got the same impression myself...)Lotta:He's real controllin'. Soon as his nurse or patients don't do what he says, he starts a-hollerin'. Musta been real rough to work for him.PresentAnythingLotta:Hey, they'll be here soon, right? The police, I mean.

Well, time to check out the crime scene. I'll have to question everyone here later on, so just sit tight, alright?Phoenix:(Why is he grinning at me...?)Morgan:Shall I show you to the scene of the crime, Detective Gymshoe?Gumshoe:Um... My name isn't Gymshoe...Phoenix:(The two of them went into the Channeling Chamber...

Ya really think the cops'll believe that?Turner Grey profileLotta:Hey, it's that Dr. Grey guy. Pity what happened to him. Pretty scary what ghouls and ghosts can do to a man, huh?

She scared me back there. ...Well, only a little, now, ya hear?Dick Gumshoe profileLotta:I swear I've seen his face before. Maybe during that last case... Whenever something happens, this detective guy is always there. I wonder if he's the real baddie behind everything?Phoenix:(Somehow, I highly doubt it...)Anything elseLotta:Nope.

Things that don't catch my eye, don't catch my interest.Phoenix:(And she calls herself a journalist??)Phoenix:Did you see or notice anything that stuck out at you?Lotta:Nah... Well, maybe one thing...Phoenix:What is it!?Lotta:Turns out my poor stomach's not good at handlin' this kind of thing.Phoenix:Huh-what?Lotta:Curses and ghosts and stuff comin' back to get ya... This is just too much, I say.Phoenix:What is too much?Lotta:Being an occult photographer. That's some scary stuff, so I think I'm gonna try being a celebrity photographer, now.Phoenix:Going after photos more within your reach from now on? More glamour, less gore?Lotta:...Phoenix:What's up?Lotta:Oh, yeah!Phoenix:Wh-What is it?Lotta:I took some hot pictures earlier!Phoenix:Huh?Lotta:Remember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside!Phoenix:(Ack! She did! Two even!)Lotta:\"The S\u00e9ance Murder\"... I sure like the ring of that.

But...Phoenix:But...?Gumshoe:But he was also stabbed in the chest with a knife.Phoenix:(...A knife?)Gumshoe:Basically, the vic was first stabbed, then he was shot.

He asked me, like, \"Do you know of a good spirit medium?\"Phoenix:(Hmm, Dr. Grey did say something about being introduced to this place.)Ini:Cause, like, talking to dead people and, like, multiple personalities are my thing...Phoenix:I see... Then why were you taking a nap here?Ini:Like... I wasn't feeling good.Phoenix:Huh?Ini:I'm, like, allergic to sesame seeds. They, like, must've put some in the food they served for lunch.Phoenix:Oh, that doesn't sound fun.Ini:So I, like, felt sick, and came in here to, like, sleep.

It all started right here, in this detention center...)Maya:I finally... I finally get to see you again, and...Phoenix:It's not your fault. You didn't do it.Maya:No, I... I did it... I killed that person.Phoenix:But that wasn't you.Maya:It doesn't matter. It might as well have been me. I was too weak... and I...

But since that title is passed from mother to daughter, I guess I will be someday...Phoenix:But many people think that channeling isn't real, that it's all just an act.Maya:You believe in us, don't you?Phoenix:Yeah... because I've seen it with my own eyes. (When Maya's channeling a spirit... not only her voice, but her whole physical appearance changes. It's a supernatural phenomenon that occurs every time. It happened this time, too... Dr. Grey said that he wanted to call the nurse, so... Maya's body must have taken on that nurse's appearance...)What happenedPhoenix:What exactly happened in the Channeling Chamber?Maya:... I went into that room with Dr. Grey, locked the door... and sat down across from him.Phoenix:OK...Maya:We closed our eyes...and I began the channeling.Phoenix:(This is sounding kind of creepy... like the beginning of a scary story...)Maya:And that's the last thing I remember...Phoenix:What?Maya:After a spirit comes into my body, I lose my self, my consciousness.Phoenix:Then, you don't remember a single thing?Maya:When I came to, I was being held in my aunt's arms. And there was blood... all over my clothes.Phoenix:(Hmm...)Maya:Oh! But... I do remember having a dream.Phoenix:A dream...?\"Dream\" (appears after \"What happened\")Phoenix:What kind of dream did you have while you were channeling...?Maya:Um... I can't remember it all that well, but... I was dead and buried in the ground. I couldn't move... and it was unbearable... Really suffocating... ...It went something like that.Phoenix:I... I see...

Where's that newspaper Dr. Grey brought the other day...? ...Ah, here it is. Right on top of my desk. (This is the only thing he left behind that's going to be of any help...)Newspaper Clipping 1 added to the Court Record.ExamineWindowPhoenix:There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Until recently, it had been a normal, business-class hotel.HouseplantPhoenix:Charley. A quite decorative plant. It's a memento of my boss, Mia... who passed away. The rest of the room may be in shambles, but I always manage to care for this little fella.PosterPhoenix:A poster of the TV action hero, the Steel Samurai. Maya stuck it up here right before she left. I wouldn't say that the Steel Samurai and an attorney's office are a good match, but Maya threatened to curse me with some magic spell... so I guess it can stay.BookshelfPhoenix:Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long, a layer of dust has started to form. One of these days, I should try to build up the courage to read one... Maybe.DeskPhoenix:It's my desk.

But it's pretty deserted today... ...probably because of the murder yesterday...)June 20Fey ManorChanneling ChamberPhoenix:It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today... I should take this chance and thoroughly check this room. If I'm lucky, I might uncover a clue or two...Morgan:Oh, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Good morning.Morgan:I am on my way to go meet Mystic Maya, and I thought to bring her some items to make her feel more at home. Namely, tea so bitter you lose your tongue and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts.Phoenix:I'm sure Maya will be very grateful...Morgan:That's \"Mystic Maya\", good sir!Phoenix:(Urk. She is one scary lady.)Morgan:Oh, dear, sweet Mystic Maya... Pearl wept constantly for you last night, as did I.Phoenix:(I know it's important for me to search the site, but I should ask her some questions too, while I have the chance...)Examine (left side)DoorPhoenix:The Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. The lock on it is broken, because, well... I broke it. It doesn't seem possible, but I managed to break it pretty badly. When we want to do something bad enough, people can do the most amazing things.Floor panels on leftPhoenix:This is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air. No matter what I do, my eyes keep getting drawn to the pool of blood in the center here.AltarPhoenix:I guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement. I'd guess they're used during the channeling...Folding screenPhoenix:It's a beautiful and expensive folding screen. It also looks quite old. There seems to be some sort of sacred text written on it, but I can't read it. ...\u00a0! Th-This is... It's a hole! Could this have been made by a bullet?Folding Screen added to the Court Record.Space behind folding screenPhoenix:There is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. I hope no one is hiding back there.TalkWhat happenedPhoenix:I would like to ask you a few questions about what happened yesterday.Morgan:Do you mean that awful tragedy????:That man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him...Phoenix:M-Maya?Step away from there!Morgan:Please leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police!Phoenix:What happened here in this room after I left?Morgan:Well... First, I struck Mystic Maya on the head.Phoenix:To make her go unconscious, correct?Morgan:That is correct. Next, I performed the Spirit Severing Technique.Phoenix:\"Spirit Severing Technique\"?Morgan:The spirit of that nurse was inside of Mystic Maya's body. I used the technique to send the nurse's spirit back to the other world.Phoenix:(I wonder if this kind of testimony is even admissible in a court of law...)Channeling ChamberPhoenix:By the way, what is this room exactly...?Morgan:The Channeling Chamber? This room was created for the sole purpose of preventing such a tragedy as yesterday.Phoenix:What do you mean?Morgan:Sometimes, when an inexperienced medium calls an especially strong spirit, that spirit may become violent and revolt, as you witnessed yesterday.Phoenix:Revolt? But how?Morgan:When a spirit enters a medium's body, she loses her will and her self steps aside. To put it another way, the spirit is borrowing the medium's body, good sir.Phoenix:But isn't that extremely dangerous?Morgan:An experienced medium has little problem controlling a spirit.Phoenix:But Maya... I mean, Mystic Maya... That was her first channeling...Morgan:And that was why I insisted on locking the door. However, I never thought that would be calling danger upon the client himself... I am grateful that one of our heirlooms was not damaged in this horrible incident.Phoenix:And that would be...? (Changed from [And that is...?] in the original release)Morgan:That folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings. (Changed from [It is that folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings.] in the original release) Along with the Kurain Sacred Urn, they are this village's most treasured possessions. If I ever found out that something had happened to either one... Oh, the inhumanity...Phoenix:(Odd for her to be worrying about the folding screen at a time like this... I guess this isn't just some dilapidated old screen after all...)PearlPhoenix:So... How is Pearl today...?Morgan:Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Y-Yes?Morgan:In this world, Pearl is my most treasured possession. When compared to even Mystic Maya, Pearl has the spiritual power to become a Master.Phoenix:Th-That's very impressive.Morgan:Until now, the women of the branch family have thought themselves to be inferior. .. But. Pearl is different! Her spiritual strength is so great; even greater than some of the main family! Yes, Pearl is a channeling prodigy and is the pride of the branch family!Phoenix:(Wow... She's really fired up now...)Morgan:In any case... Our world is so different from yours, perhaps it is best for you to quit, good sir.Phoenix:\"Quit\"? Quit what?PresentMaya's MagatamaMorgan:...Oh my!Phoenix:Wh-What is it?Morgan:That... That is Mystic Maya's Magatama. Why would you have this in your possession!?Phoenix:I-I'm sorry!Morgan:Return it to Mystic Maya at once!Phoenix:Y-Yes, madam! (Why did I feel like I was being scolded by my own mother just now...?)Folding ScreenMorgan:Ah, so even someone such as yourself can take interest in something like this. This is the Kurain Channeling Technique Sacred Writings. There are 6 panels in all.Phoenix:I see... But that's not what caught my eye. You see this hole here...?Morgan:It is an old screen, you see. It is only logical that perhaps a bug or worm of some sort is the culprit.Phoenix:(Even though this looks nothing like the eating patterns of any bug I know...)Maya Fey profileMorgan:I can hardly believe Mystic Maya has become like this. Directly influenced by the likes of you, and becoming caught up in a situation such as this...Phoenix:I'm sorry... (...Hey, hold on! How is all this MY fault!?)Morgan:I told her so many times, as I have also told Pearl, \"Do not associate with strange old men you don't know\".Phoenix:(Well, that shouldn't apply to me then, especially since I'm hardly an \"old man\" yet!!)Turner Grey profileMorgan:That doctor was one of those people. Those who intend harm upon the spirits receive harm in return; it's karma at work. It seems that he was the one to take the nurse's life, wouldn't you agree?Phoenix:(I guess that's possible...)Pearl Fey profileMorgan:Good sir!Phoenix:Y...Yes?Morgan:When did you take this picture!? This is one of those... what are they called...? Those... \"hidden camera\" pictures!Phoenix:N-No!! It's not one of those at all!!Morgan:Such an unforgivable offense! You will hand it over to me!Phoenix:N-No! I won't! (If I ever want to talk about Pearl again, I should be much more careful...)Morgan Fey profileMorgan:It shows the same face as the one I see in the mirror every day.Phoenix:And? Anything else?Morgan:No. That is all.Phoenix:(Why in the world did I bother to show this to her!?)Any other evidenceMorgan:I will be leaving shortly to meet with Mystic Maya. I simply do not have the time to look at such trivial matters.Any other profileMorgan:We usually do not welcome strangers into our village as they disturb the aura here. Especially people like you, good sir.Phoenix:H-Hey, what do you mean, \"especially people like me?\"Morgan:You selfishly make Mystic Maya help you with your work... You should be thankful I have not taken your life for such a disrespectful act.Phoenix:Y-Yes, madam...Morgan:And even more importantly, remember that if anything were to happen to Pearl...Phoenix:(What is that supposed to mean!?)After clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen:Morgan:Well, then, I do believe it is time for me to take my leave.Phoenix:Alright. Please tell Maya I said hi.Morgan:What was that!?Phoenix:Uh, I mean, Mystic Maya.Morgan:I will tell her.Phoenix:(...*sigh*)June 20Fey ManorWinding WayPhoenix:(Little Pearl isn't here today...

Mr. Smith, Esquire.Phoenix:...That's \"Wright\". Wait, I mean, you're wrong. My name is \"Wright\".Ini:\"Smith\", \"Wright\"... Well, I got, like, three letters, at least.Phoenix:(I don't think she gets the point...) Anyway, why are you here?Ini:So, like, I study this thing called \"parapsychology\" at this college and...Phoenix:Um, you told me about that yesterday. The sesame allergy, too. What I'd really like to know is why you're still here today?Ini:Oh! So, like, that's what you meant! Like, you shoulda been more, like, clear about it!Phoenix:S-Sorry. My bad.Ini:No, it's OK.

There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir.Ini:Isn't it cuuuuute? I, like, totally bought that!Phoenix:Ah... so it's yours, huh?Ini:Yeah. So, like, this village is really famous for, like, channeling and bears.Phoenix:Heh. (...Wait. Famous for bears!?)Ini:But it's, like, OK. If you ever, like, see a bear, you just play dead, and they, like, leave you alone.Phoenix:I-Is that right?Ini:Yeah. Cause, like, fighting back is totally of no use.Phoenix:(Has she actually tried to fight one!?)Yellow boxPhoenix:Hmm, now where did this box come from? I'm sure this wasn't here last night. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom.TalkIni MineyPhoenix:So?

I really look up to her.Phoenix:Wow, I had no idea Maya was so... revered.Pearl:Usually when people don't use Mystic Maya's title, I get mad.Phoenix:O-Oh, sorry.Pearl:But if it's you, Mr. Nick, then it's OK. Because... Because... you're \"special\" to her.Phoenix:(Where in the world did she get an idea like that??)Pearl:By the way... this may be rude, but which channeling school are you from?Phoenix:Which channeling school?Pearl:Yes. For example, I study the Kurain technique.Phoenix:... Ah, I get it! No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. A lawyer.Pearl:...Law...yer?Phoenix:Yup.Pearl:...Is that related to spirit mediums in any way...?Phoenix:(Um... None that I know of...)

There's no way anyone other than Maya Fey could've done it.Phoenix:(...!)Pearl:...Phoenix:(What am I supposed to say to Pearls now...?)The victimPhoenix:About Dr. Grey...Gumshoe:The victim wasn't super famous, but people still knew who he was. His face was all over those tabloid shows last year.Phoenix:Yeah, I know.Gumshoe:I was looking through some newspapers from last year, and... ... Huh? I could've sworn I had... I cut an article out, but I guess I must've lost it...Phoenix:(He's searching through his pockets... And boy, are those big...)Gumshoe:Hmm... It looked really interesting, too. Hey, do you have a copy, pal?Phoenix:(A copy of that article...? I think Dr. Grey might have brought a copy to the office when he came by...)Tomorrow's trialPhoenix:About Maya's trial tomorrow...Gumshoe:I've got two pieces of news for you, pal.Phoenix:Two?Gumshoe:Yeah. \"Bad news\" and \"even worse news.\" So which do you want to hear first?Phoenix:...I don't really care... It doesn't change the fact that I'm not going to like it.Gumshoe:Alright, pal. Well, the prosecutor for the trial is Prosecutor von Karma.Phoenix:WHAT!? Von Karma!?Phoenix:(Manfred von Karma... He was an awe-inspiring veteran prosecutor. He never lost a case in the 40 years of his career, and he raised a fearsome disciple. The horrible aftertaste of the evil he force-fed me is something I'll never forget.)Phoenix:... Wait a sec. But didn't Von Karma stand trial and...Gumshoe:That's where the other piece of bad news comes in... The Von Karma you're facing tomorrow is actually his successor...Phoenix:Successor...?Successor (appears after \"Tomorrow's trial\")Phoenix:So, um... Who is this \"successor\" to Von Karma?Gumshoe:Literally, pal, it's Prosecutor von Karma's kid. His kid became a prosecutor real young... like 13, and hasn't lost a trial since. That's what they call a \"prodigy,\" pal.Phoenix:Hmm... Kid, huh... ... W-W-Wait a sec! Th-Th-Thirteen!? The kid became a prosecutor at the age of THIRTEEN!? I mean, a prodigy like that... I would have heard something about...Gumshoe:Oh, no, no. The kid was born and raised in Germany, pal. That country's got a lot of stuff and is a great place to develop a person's talents.Phoenix:(Germany, huh? That's probably why I've never heard of this person. Ugh... Still, all it takes is someone mentioning the name \"Von Karma\", and I get terrible flashbacks to that case. Stop it! Get a grip on yourself, Phoenix! (Changed from [Stop it! Get over it, Phoenix!] in the original release) None of that matters anymore... now that he's gone...

It's not that important anyway.Maya's MagatamaPhoenix:What do you think about this...?Gumshoe:Hey, that's a pretty nice-looking brooch! You should stop wearing that ugly old attorney's badge, and start wearing that, pal.Pearl:Hee, hee. That detective is so nice! Aren't you happy, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:(Happy?... About what?)Newspaper Clipping 1Phoenix:Um, Dr. Grey brought this over to my office the other day, and...Gumshoe:Hey! It's that news story! The one about the malpractice suit!Phoenix:Fourteen patients died and it caused a huge stink.Gumshoe:Yeah, but that's not all, pal. Things only got worse after that.Phoenix:You mean the car accident the nurse died in?Gumshoe:...Hmm... Oh, here we go. I brought my own clipping with me today. Here, pal, this is for you.Phoenix:Alright. Thanks.Newspaper Clipping 2 added to the Court Record.Newspaper Clipping 1 (subsequent times)Gumshoe:The nurse that killed the patients ended up getting killed in an accident. Dr. Grey wound up on a lot of tabloid shows because of that. Now, there was a smart man. I'm sure that was a great way to advertise for his clinic.Phoenix:(Uh, huh. Scaring people off is always the best way to get more patients.)Black KeyPhoenix:So about this key...Gumshoe:Hey, is that your house key or something, pal?Phoenix:Come on, does this look like a house key to you?Gumshoe:Then what's it for?Phoenix:It's... ... (Hmm, actually, I should probably keep that a secret...) It's my bicycle key.Gumshoe:Oh. Nothing special, huh?Maya Fey profileGumshoe:I'm sorry things had to turn out this way, pal.Phoenix:It's too early to give up! No one's proven her guilty of anything, yet!Gumshoe:Look, even if there were a zillion of you, pal, this is a case you... *sigh*Phoenix:(Now why is he sighing?)Pearl Fey profileGumshoe:Oh, so that's little Pearl.Phoenix:Do you know her?Gumshoe:Only that Ms. Fey was looking for her earlier. Something about being worried that she'll end up talking to the weird guy. So, you have any idea who this \"weird guy\" is, pal?Phoenix:...Nope. Not a clue.Morgan Fey profileGumshoe:That's Maya's aunt, right? I got to eat one of her giant strawberry desserts earlier. It was really good!Phoenix:(Aw, I didn't get to eat one yet...)Dick Gumshoe profileGumshoe:Boy do I look scary in this picture. I guess if I want people to stop thinking cops are scary, I have to change myself. Gotta smile, gotta smile!Phoenix:(There's that classic Gumshoe goofy smile again...)Any other evidenceGumshoe:Ooh, I'd better shut my mouth.Phoenix:Uh, what?Gumshoe:I'm not gonna give you any information about evidence, pal.Phoenix:Oh.Any other profileGumshoe:I don't have anything to tell you about this one, pal.Phoenix:You don't have to be so mean about it.Gumshoe:Not.

But how?Pearl:Please use Mystic Maya's Magatama on this person, and let's remove the lock.Phoenix:(I have no idea what she's talking about, but... Guess I'll give it a try.)Pearl:You must be careful, though, Mr. Nick. If you make a mistake, it will hurt you.

Thanks for coming all this way!Pearl:I was really worried about you...Maya:Hey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together?Pearl:Mother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks.Maya:Huh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself?Pearl:Yup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map.Phoenix:Don't tell me you walked all the way here...Pearl:Of course not! ...I ran!Phoenix:That's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...)Maya:Pearly... What about the train?Pearl:Huh? What's a... \"tray-in\"?Phoenix:(I give up...)Pearl:...It's time, isn't it?Maya:Um... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma!Pearl:Mr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that?Maya:Um, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend. I still remember him as though I'd seen him only yesterday.

(Changed from [Every trial was a scorching fierce battle until the very end.] in the original release) It was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life...Phoenix:Maya! Please don't mention that name ever again...Maya:Huh...? But why, Nick?Phoenix:I'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back...Maya:Whaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!?Bailiff:Court will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom.Phoenix:... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway.Maya:N...Nick...?June 21, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:Court is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared????:...Phoenix:... (What is with this kid...?) (Changed from [... (What is with this girl...?)] in the original release)Judge:... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you prepared!? (Changed from [*Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?] in the original release)Phoenix:Huh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?)???:Mr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:...!???:You must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct?Phoenix:(...Hold on. So SHE'S the famed \"successor\" to Prosecutor von Karma...?) (Changed from [...Hold on. So this kid is the 'famed' Prosecutor von Karma...?] in the original release)von Karma:I am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy.Phoenix:I... see...von Karma:I gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge.Phoenix:Revenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?)Judge:Um... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww!von Karma:I'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me.Phoenix:(Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!!von Karma:Make no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Judge:Prosecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please...von Karma:Those of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is \"perfection\". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch.Judge:V-Very well... What is the defense's position?Phoenix:Your Honor.Judge:Does the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"?Phoenix:...Yes.von Karma:Foolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time.Phoenix:(\"Justified self-defense\"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of themself. (Changed from [A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself.] in the original release) We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of \"not guilty\", Your Honor! (Because to plead \"justified self-defense\" is to say you did kill someone.)von Karma:How foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness.Phoenix:(She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.)von Karma:Witness, your name and occupation?Gumshoe:Yes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!!von Karma:Get to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder.Gumshoe:Y-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room.Judge:What were they doing in there?Gumshoe:Um... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir.Judge:Ch-Channeling a spirit??Phoenix:(That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release)Gumshoe:*ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room.Judge:Ah, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over.Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Judge:So, how was the victim killed?Gumshoe:I was about to get to that...von Karma:Stop wasting my time, then.Witness Testimony-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.The shot was fired from point-blank range.But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Judge:Hmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot...Gumshoe:This is the victim's autopsy report, sir.Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:The court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.Cross Examination-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:The direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:The murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was it?Gumshoe:It was the victim's.Phoenix:The victim? Now, why would he have...von Karma:von Karma:\"Why would he have a pistol?\" Who cares? The point that you are missing is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start.Judge:Fingerprints? There were fingerprints?Gumshoe:Along with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir.Judge:Hmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon...Phoenix:(Argh...! I walked right into her hands there.) (Changed from [Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.] in the original release)Gumshoe:The shot was fired from point-blank range.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Point blank, huh? So about how far away was it?Gumshoe:It was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away.Phoenix:And how do you know he was shot at point blank?von Karma:Tsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country...Phoenix:E-Excuse me!?von Karma:Gunpowder burn.Phoenix:...Gunpowder burn?von Karma:When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.Gumshoe:Gunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead!Phoenix:(Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...)Gumshoe:But before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Stabbed... And what was he stabbed with?Gumshoe:A fruit knife.Judge:I see. And whose knife was it?Gumshoe:It looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it.Judge:Hmm... All over it, huh?Phoenix:(Urk. This does not look good...)von Karma:Ha ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Gumshoe:The wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:How severe was the wound?Gumshoe:If it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand.Phoenix:(This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...)Gumshoe:The murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you sure he was stabbed first, then shot?Gumshoe:Yup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal.von Karma:A fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:(Grr... What a pain...)Phoenix:(Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...)After pressing first, second, third, and fifth statements:Judge:That's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered.Gumshoe:I brought the two murder weapons with me today.Judge:Very well. The court accepts them into evidence.Pistol added to the Court Record.Knife added to the Court Record.von Karma:The date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time.Judge:And two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them, huh... (Changed from [And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...?] in the original release) Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case.von Karma:Naturally!Phoenix:(This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...)von Karma:Your Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there?Judge:That is quite true... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Y-Yes?Judge:Even in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead \"not guilty\"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose.von Karma:See, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes...Judge:What will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to \"justified self-defense\"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance.Phoenix:(This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!)Plead justified self-defensePhoenix:(If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to \"justified self-defense\"...von Karma:Hah.Judge:Understood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea.Phoenix:(...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?)Mia:...You already hold the key... ...If you don't believe, you cannot win...Phoenix:(...! If we plead \"justified self-defense\", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor!Judge:Y-Yes?Phoenix:The defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty!Leads to:\"...You.\"Plead not guiltyPhoenix:(If we plead \"justified self-defense\"... we would basically be confessing to a murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'd be labeled a murderer... I can't let that happen!) Your Honor!Judge:Have you reached a conclusion, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:The defense will not change its plea. We will accept nothing short of complete acquittal!Leads to:\"...You.\"von Karma:...You. You have sealed your fate, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Detective!Gumshoe:Y-Yes, sir!von Karma:Present the final portion of your testimony -- the final strike.Gumshoe:Um... Y-Yes... sir...Judge:N-Now, see here! Proceedings are run by... Eek!von Karma:...Judge:Oh, yes, of course. Go ahead Detective and give your testimony...von Karma:I think the court would like to hear about the other piece of incriminating evidence!Witness Testimony-- Incriminating Evidence --Gumshoe:Sorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.As you can see, it's covered in blood.The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.Judge:So this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this.Gumshoe:This piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir.Judge:I see... The court accepts this into evidence.Maya's Costume added to the Court Record.Judge:Alright, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:(Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??)von Karma:Hah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer. Feel free to sulk off with your tail between your legs, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:(Please stop calling me by my full name. It's disturbing.)Cross Examination-- Incriminating Evidence --Gumshoe:Sorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Why didn't you say so in your testimony earlier!?Gumshoe:Uh... You're kinda scary today, you know, pal?Judge:Come now, Mr. Wright... There is no need for that kind of attitude in my court...Phoenix:...Judge:A-Alright. Just, please stop glaring at me like that...Gumshoe:This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Maya's... costume?Gumshoe:Yeah. She was wearing this when we arrested her.Phoenix:(Maya... She's wearing her channeling costume today too... Is she not allowed to wear anything else...?)Gumshoe:As you can see, it's covered in blood.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:This blood on the costume...Gumshoe:Lab results show that it is the victim's blood.Judge:Hmm... So there is blood from the victim on the defendant's clothes.Phoenix:(Definitely not good...) (Changed from [Definitely not good... Urk.] in the original release) So, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence? (Changed from [Hmm, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence?] in the original release)Gumshoe:Um, well...von Karma:von Karma:If you must change the topic, then the good detective here must testify again. But too bad. Not enough time. Let's move on. (Changed from [But too bad. Not enough time. Time to move on.] in the original release)Judge:Ah, yes, Ms. von Karma is perfectly correct...Phoenix:(Grr... Now even the Judge is on her side! But if I bite off more than I can chew here... What should I do!?)Press furtherPhoenix:(Why is Ms. von Karma suddenly putting up resistance? There must be a reason as to why she suddenly threw out an objection like that... There must be something about this costume...! (Changed from [There must be a clue somewhere on this costume!] in the original release) I just have to look harder!)Judge:Mr. Wright. Ms. von Karma's logic is perfect. There is no way for you to poke a hole in it.Phoenix:(Argh! Looks like my time is up. So, about the costume...)There is nothing wrong.Phoenix:(If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this.Judge:Good. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony.Leads back to cross-examinationThere is one little thing...Phoenix:Your Honor. Actually, there is something very wrong with this piece of evidence.Judge:Wh-What!?Gumshoe:What are you talking about, pal!?von Karma:...Judge:Wh-Where is this problem you are talking about!?Phoenix:(I've come this far... There's no turning back now!) The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!Present bullet hole on left sleevePhoenix:Leads to:\"I ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume.\"Present blood splatterPhoenix:Phoenix:The problem is obviously the blood splatter here!Judge:B-But... We've determined that the blood splatter is from the victim. Where is the problem in that?Gumshoe:Yeah, where, pal?Phoenix:Yeah... I wonder about that too...Judge:That last antic of yours just pushed me over the top, Mr. Wright. I hereby declare this cross-examination over...

I'd better not mess up again...)Leads back to:\"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\"Present anywhere elsePhoenix:Phoenix:There is a problem... somewhere around... here!Judge:Wh-What does he mean, Ms. von Karma?von Karma:There's nothing wrong with it.

No one ever told me!Judge:A hole that smells of gunpowder...Phoenix:(It looks like I've found the \"hole\" I was looking for!) Your Honor, the only logical conclusion you can make is that it must be a bullet hole!Judge:Order! Order! Order!! This is a very grave matter. It's best we correct the Court Record first before anything else.Maya's Costume updated in the Court Record.Gumshoe:Sorry about that. I guess we messed up, sir.von Karma:...Phoenix:...! (I-Is she actually... smiling!? What else is she hiding!?)von Karma:Pull yourself together, Detective. That tiny \"hole\" doesn't change a thing. The strength of the evidence still holds. Continue with your testimony. That, just now, was a fluke. Nothing more.Phoenix:Phoenix:H-How can you say something like that!? This is a huge oversight!Judge:While I agree it is a mistake on the part of the police, what Prosecutor von Karma has said is true. The evidence still stands. If you do not find a more definitive problem with the evidence, then...Phoenix:No way!!Judge:Detective Gumshoe, please continue with your testimony.Gumshoe:Y-Yes, sir.Leads back to cross-examinationLet it goPhoenix:(If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...)

Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony.Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record)Phoenix:Phoenix:Alright. I'll give you that the blood spatter is from the victim, but... what is this hole in the sleeve?Gumshoe:Um... Sorry, pal. We must've thought it was just a tear in the seam...Phoenix:Missing the hole is not what I'm asking you about. I'm talking about the hole itself! The smell of gunpowder  clearly gives away that... it is a bullet hole!von Karma:von Karma:As if little things like that matter.Phoenix:But they do.von Karma:A \"bullet hole\" in the sleeve, blood splatter all over the costume... Neither of these things can change the fact the defendant killed the victim.Phoenix:(...Grr... I know there's something more to that costume.)von Karma:Come now Detective. You're wasting precious time.Gumshoe:... Yes, sir.Gumshoe:The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:He wasn't \"fighting back\"? How do you know if he was or wasn't!?Gumshoe:We could find no evidence that the victim put up any sort of struggle, pal.Judge:Hmm... So did the murderer have a fight with the victim, or not? Depending on this, the circumstances around this murder change drastically.Phoenix:(Ugh... We're in real trouble now... If only I had something to prove that the victim did fight back...)Present Maya's Costume (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record)Phoenix:Leads to:\"Detective Dick Gumshoe!\"Phoenix:(That Von Karma! She thinks she can decide the verdict with this testimony alone! I have to somehow find a critical contradiction and then I'll have her!)Phoenix:Detective Dick Gumshoe!Gumshoe:Y-Yes? Heh, having you call me by my full name is kind of a weird feeling...Phoenix:You said that my client killed \"a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.\"Gumshoe:Yeah, I did.Phoenix:Then what, may I ask, is the bullet hole you police overlooked supposed to mean!?Gumshoe:Eh, um... What does it mean?Phoenix:I'll tell you what it means. It means that the victim had fired off a shot. Is this what it means to \"not fight back\"?Gumshoe:A-Ah! You're right!Judge:It seems you are correct! (Changed from [It would seem that way!] in the original release) If the victim had tried to shoot the defendant, then... it would change everything...

The wind seems to be shifting...)von Karma:Hah.Phoenix:(What is with that \"are you finished yet\" laugh?)von Karma:Are you finished yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Judge:Ms. von Karma?von Karma:It seems... that Maya Fey was shot at by the victim. However, that is only grounds enough to support a \"justified self-defense\" plea.Judge:That is correct.von Karma:But I'm sure you remember, Your Honor, what the defense clearly said. They rejected \"justified self-defense\" and pleaded \"not guilty.\"Phoenix:Ack!Gumshoe:Now that you...Judge:Why, that's right!von Karma:Which means! The defense has yet to prove anything at all!Phoenix:Nooooo!!Judge:W-Well... Yes, that's true...von Karma:Furthermore... just the fact that there is a bullet hole in the costume... is not enough to substantiate even a plea of \"justified self-defense\".Judge:Huh? How so?Gumshoe:Aaah!von Karma:Don't just stand there. Hurry up and tell the court what transpired that day. ...With the new information we acquired added in, of course.Gumshoe:Huh? You mean... By myself...? You want me to put together the scenario all by myself? Aah!von Karma:...Gumshoe:Y-Yes, sir! Right away, sir!Witness Testimony-- What Transpired --Gumshoe:During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.The defendant then picked up on the opening, took the victim's gun, and ended it...Judge:Hmm... This scenario you have put together does make sense...Gumshoe:Yes, sir.Judge:Well, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:(On the surface, it does seem to make sense... (Changed from [Just by listening, it does make sense...] in the original release) However, I won't give up that easily!)Judge:P-Please refrain from glaring at me like that... Now then, your cross-examination, please.Cross Examination-- What Transpired --Gumshoe:During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:There is quite a difference in height between Dr. Grey and the defendant. Add in body strength, and it seems unlikely the defendant could have stabbed the victim!Gumshoe:Now that you mention it... Yeah, I guess...von Karma:von Karma:You think you can get away with such flimsy reasoning? Mr. Phoenix Wright! Maya Fey was in the middle of channeling, was she not?Phoenix:...?von Karma:When channeling with the Kurain Channeling Technique, the medium physically changes. With the nurse's build, the defendant could have easily been a match for the doctor.Phoenix:(I don't believe it... She even studied up on the Kurain Channeling Technique!)von Karma:Like I said before... I am perfect.Judge:Um... Uh... About what you were talking about... I didn't quite get it...Phoenix:...von Karma:...Judge:Um, n-never mind. Let's continue with the testimony...Gumshoe:Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So he was stabbed, but the stab wound didn't kill him.Gumshoe:But if you think about the blood loss, it was pretty bad.Phoenix:How bad would you say it was?Gumshoe:Actually, I went to give blood the other day. And afterward, I felt a little lightheaded and dizzy. ...I guess the damage was maybe... about 10 times the dizziness...? Ack!von Karma:...Gumshoe:S-Sorry!Gumshoe:While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Where in the world did that pistol come from?Gumshoe:It looks like the victim, Dr. Grey had specifically bought it for that day.Phoenix:But a handgun...?Gumshoe:He got it off the black market about 2 days before the murder.Phoenix:(Why did Dr. Grey bring a gun...? Was he taking precautions against something...?)Gumshoe:The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So, you're saying that the bullet hole in this costume was made then?Gumshoe:Sorry, pal, but that's what I'd think. The two of them were already fighting when a shot was fired.Phoenix:(Maya... I'm really glad you weren't hurt...)von Karma:...Present Maya's CostumePhoenix:Leads to:\"Missing the tiny hole on this costume...\"Gumshoe:The defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it...PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Maya has never fired a gun before in her life!Gumshoe:The victim had already taken off the safety. With the safety off, even an amateur like you can fire it by pulling the trigger.Phoenix:(Even me...? I wonder...?)von Karma:Now do you understand? A Von Karma's logic is perfect.Phoenix:(His testimony certainly makes us look very bad, but there's gotta be a contradiction in there somewhere... And uncovering it is going to uncover the truth! I can feel it!)Phoenix:Missing the tiny hole on this costume... will be the prosecution's undoing.Gumshoe:Eh? What do you mean?Phoenix:This little hole has actually created a huge hole in your testimony!Judge:E-Explain yourself, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:You said the two of them were fighting when the victim fired his gun at point blank. If that were true, then where is the gunpowder burn on this costume!?Gumshoe:G-Gunpowder... burn?Phoenix:This is what you testified earlier: \"When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\"Gumshoe:OH!Phoenix:But there is not a single trace of gunpowder burn on this costume!!Judge:That is a very good point. And... what exactly does this mean?Phoenix:It means that when the shot was fired, they were standing apart from each other.Judge:Hmm...von Karma:von Karma:I'm disappointed, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You think you can punch a hole in my logic with that? With wishy-washy thinking like that, anyone can explain anything away!Phoenix:Then I implore you to disprove my line of thinking.von Karma:Let's see... In the middle of their fight, the victim pushed the defendant away. And it was then, when they were separated, that he fired! How was that?Phoenix:Phoenix:As if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that!von Karma:...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself. And then while she was preparing to strike again, the doctor took his shot. There. That sound satisfy even you.Judge:Hmm... That does make an awful lot of sense. What do you think, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:(I must be careful. I can't afford to make a mistake here! Concentrate and think!)It makes sense.Phoenix:(Ack, it's no good. I can't find a \"hole\" in her logic at all this time...) I admit it. Somehow, your reasoning makes logical sense.von Karma:That's it. That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Drat. It's 11:00 AM. I've already missed my morning tea. ...However. At least we were able to arrive at a conclusion.Judge:Hmm... It does look that way.Phoenix:(...Oh boy... If I don't do something soon, it'll be curtains for Maya...)Judge:Well then, I think we can...Phoenix:Phoenix:Your Honor! Please... Wait!Judge:Who was that? Mr. Wright? Please refrain from making unnecessary outbursts!Phoenix:(I don't care how, but I must find something to go on in Von Karma's explanation!)Leads to:\"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\"Something doesn't make sense.Leads to:\"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\"Phoenix:There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!Gumshoe:Fatal...?Judge:Flaw...!? Yeow!von Karma:Very interesting. I would love to see where this \"flaw\" is! Show me something that contradicts my explanation!Phoenix:(There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere! \"She put some distance between them before rushing to make the final blow. And when she was about to strike, the doctor took his shot.\" There must be a piece of evidence that contradicts this line of thinking!)Present Folding ScreenPhoenix:Leads to:\"This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Phoenix:Take a look at this!Gumshoe:Why are you showing this to me, pal?Phoenix:Prosecutor von Karma's explanation and this piece of evidence...Gumshoe:...Do not contradict!Phoenix:...Huh?Gumshoe:Haha, looks like you need to use your brain a little more, pal.Phoenix:(Ugh... Being lectured by Gumshoe, of all people, is so embarrassing...)Gumshoe:Come on! Hurry up and get that thinking cap on!Leads back to:\"There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere!\"Phoenix:This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.Judge:What is that? A folding screen?Phoenix:I would like to point the court's attention to the \"hole\" in this folding screen.von Karma:Aaah!Phoenix:It looks like you already know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:Who? Where? What?Judge:Mr. Wright! Your explanation, please!Phoenix:(Are these two really that clueless...?) The bullet went through the defendant's sleeve first, then the folding screen. It passed through at a height of approximately 8 inches off the ground... Which means! When the shot was fired, Maya... I mean, the defendant, was not getting ready to strike, but was actually squatting low to the ground!Judge:Order! Order! Th-This changes everything!Phoenix:Please look at this diagram of the crime scene. The victim, Dr. Grey was here when he fired the shot. And the bullet hit this folding screen.

At this time, the defendant was in this area.Present area directly in front of bullet holePhoenix:Leads to:\"She was standing here, near the folding screen!\"Present area behind folding screenPhoenix:Phoenix:Here!Judge:Behind the folding screen...?Phoenix:Ack!von Karma:The victim and his attacker were fighting, were they not? Then what would the attacker be doing all the way back there!?Phoenix:Um...von Karma:Besides which, if the attacker was behind the folding screen, then how could the victim even know where to shoot? It's obviously impossible!Phoenix:... Yeah, I guess so...Judge:Mr. Wright!Phoenix:(Boy, did I just screw up royally... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)Leads back to:\"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\"Present anywhere elsePhoenix:Phoenix:Somewhere around here!Judge:...?Phoenix:(Uh oh. The judge's face is scrunched like he just smelled some serious bad breath...) Uhh... Um... That is, I mean...Judge:Wait! I just realized I forgot to brush this morning... Excuse me while I freshen up.Phoenix:Uh, sure...Judge:In the meantime, I want you to think things through again, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:(Ah, of course... Whoops... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)Leads back to:\"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\"Phoenix:She was standing here, near the folding screen!von Karma:W-Wait a second! We know the defendant was close to the ground based on the height of the bullet hole. But... How can you gauge the distance from that!? Isn't it possible that the defendant was standing much closer to the victim?Phoenix:That's impossible.von Karma:B-But why!?Phoenix:You, of all people, should know the answer to that question, Ms. von Karma. If she were shot from somewhere closer, there would be gunpowder burns present. However! There is nothing of the sort around the bullet hole of this costume!von Karma:Aaaaaah! C-Curse you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You...!Judge:Hmm... I believe it has now been proven that the defendant was standing a ways from the victim when she was shot at. But do you think this has changed the defendant's situation...?It doesn't change anything.Phoenix:(Hmm, even with that explanation, it feels like nothing has changed... But I can't give up just yet!)Leads to:\"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\"It changes everything.Leads to:\"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\"Phoenix:Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything! The prosecution has claimed that the defendant was aiming to kill by stabbing. If that were true, delivering the final strike with the knife would be ideal. However! Where and what was the defendant doing at the time...?Gumshoe:...Squatting all the way by the folding screen...?Phoenix:Exactly. If Maya Fey was the real murderer, why would she be by the folding screen instead of preparing to strike?von Karma:Nnngh...Judge:Upon further consideration, it does make very little sense.Gumshoe:Yeah, I figured there had to be a reason.Phoenix:Figuring things out and proving the logic behind everything is YOUR job!Gumshoe:Oof...Phoenix:(Alright! With this, the rest of the trial should be in the b--)von Karma:...Phoenix:(...blast radius of disaster.)von Karma:You are such a smart man, Mr. Phoenix Wright. To think that you've been able to take a completely hopeless case to this point... Now I know why Papa had a tough time with you. Mmm, you amuse me...Phoenix:(Uuugh. Of all the things to inherit, why did it have to be that smarmy smile!?)von Karma:Detective. How dare you damage my perfect logic!?Gumshoe:H-Huh!?... How is it all my fault??von Karma:You can start repairing your standing by first removing that three-strand \"goatee\". Oh, and rest assured your punishment will come later.Gumshoe:...P-Punishment...von Karma:Well then, Your Honor, I think I've had all I can take of this detective's face. I think it's time to call in the next witness.Phoenix:(Next witness...? That's gotta be Lotta!)Judge:Very well. The court will take a 5 minute recess. After we reconvene, we will hear from the next witness.To be continued.June 21, 11:37 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Phoenix:Phew, that was a close one.Maya:I know you were giving it your all to defend me. But I could feel the death penalty hanging in the air...Phoenix:I felt like I was pretty close to dying myself...Pearl:But you were wonderful out there. You listened carefully, made theories, and tricked everyone into believing you.Phoenix:Th-Thanks. Wait... Tricked??Pearl:That must be the \"lawyer's\" secret technique, right?Maya:By the way... Is the next witness who I think it is...?Phoenix:Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's Lotta Hart.Maya:Oh... Guess there's no escaping her, huh? (Changed from [Oh...

After I call my witness, sit there quietly and watch like a good little boy.Judge:Y-Yes, sir.von Karma:Bring in the photographer who witnessed the channeling!von Karma:Witness. Your name and occupation, if you please.Lotta:Hey, Phoenix! How ya doin'?Phoenix:Just fine...Lotta:Sorry 'bout this. Didn't exactly have a choice, ya know...? Yeowza!von Karma:Name and occupation.Lotta:I-I declare! What in tarnation!? Hey, Judge! This here is violence against my fair self!Judge:That's fine.Lotta:\"That's fine!?\" That ain't fine!! That's a whip! Eaaah!von Karma:There's no need for foolish outcries from foolishly foolish fools. Just hurry up and testify about what happened on the day of the murder.Lotta:I haven't even gotten to say my name and job yet...von Karma:...Lotta:The name's Lotta Hart, paranormal photographer, and I'm here to testify!Judge:Now, now, let's all be one big happy family... OK...?Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:Only the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber.We were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot!Mr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room.Inside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around.I swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room.Judge:And did you take a picture of the scene right after the murder took place?Lotta:Reckon course!Phoenix:Eh? ...Excuse me?Lotta:Reckon course! It's short for \"Ya reckon!? Of course I did!\" Aah!von Karma:Does it look like I care? Just hurry up and show your picture to the court.Phoenix:(The moment of truth. What will be in that picture?)Lotta:Umm, let's see here... This here's the picture!Judge:Hmm... It would certainly seem that only the defendant and the victim were in that room.Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:Are you ready, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Phoenix:(I will clear all doubt about Maya through this cross-examination... Just watch me!)Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Lotta:Only the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Was it really only those two that went in!?von Karma:von Karma:What are you blabbering about!? You were there too, were you not!?Phoenix:Urk.von Karma:Why don't you answer that yourself? Was it really just the two of them?Phoenix:...Yes. Dr. Grey and Maya were the only two who went into the room...Judge:H-Hold on! We can't have the defense testifying against its own client!Lotta:Anyway, folks, only the two of 'em went into the Channelin' Chamber, ya hear?von Karma:But you knew that from the very beginning, didn't you? ...Witness, continue.Lotta:We were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Was it really a gunshot!?von Karma:von Karma:Are you insane!? You must have heard it as well!Phoenix:Urk.von Karma:Why don't you testify for the court, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Was it really a gunshot?Phoenix:...Yes. I think it was something that sounded like a gunshot...Judge:And why are we here listening to the defense testify!?Phoenix:(...And the world becomes just a little crueler...)Lotta:I heard a gunshot a long time ago, so I know. And I tell ya that was a gunshot I heard. Now, this -- this is where the story heats up!Lotta:Mr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So, let me get this straight! This \"Mr. Lawyer there\" broke the door down!?von Karma:Honestly, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Why don't you tell us what happened, then?Phoenix:Um... Yes, Ms. von Karma... I broke the door down. Sorry. (Why does this feel like an inquisition?)Lotta:No need for apologizin'! That was great! You're a real man!Judge:Oh, really? That's something I would've liked to see.Phoenix:(The judge is smiling rather openly. I'll take that as a good sign...)von Karma:And? What did you see once you broke in?Lotta:Inside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you sure it was the defendant, Maya Fey!?Lotta:Sure, I'm sure!Phoenix:(Lotta seems awful confident in her testimony...)Press harderPhoenix:Lotta! Please, think back to that day one more time.Lotta:Wh-Whatcha getting' at?Phoenix:Remember what you said when we broke into the room...????:...I was... murdered...*klik*Phoenix:Lotta! At a time like this!?Lotta:Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!?Phoenix:When you saw the murderer at that time, you couldn't even tell if it was Maya Fey or not! Am I correct!?Lotta:Ah, um, well, ya see...Judge:Order! Ms. Hart! You are here to present accurate testimony!Lotta:Yeah, ah, s-sorry.Phoenix:(Good. This shifts things back to my side...)von Karma:For a defense lawyer, your defense is terribly lacking, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:!von Karma:Witness. Think back to when those two entered the Channeling Chamber.Lotta:When they entered...?von Karma:One of those people that entered the chamber was Maya Fey, correct?Lotta:Yeah, that's right!Phoenix:(Yeah... It was Maya that went in.)Judge:Hmm... It looks like we've come to a collective conclusion. The person in this picture is most certainly Maya Fey.von Karma:Exactly.Phoenix:(Rats! And I'm trapped like one... Again!)Leads back to cross-examinationLeave her bePhoenix:(Even I can see that any normal person would know who that was. It's no good. I shouldn't push my luck on this...)Leads back to cross-examinationLotta:I swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you absolutely certain of that!?Lotta:Sure am! But that old witch chased us out of the room, so...Phoenix:(\"Old witch\"? Does she mean Morgan Fey?)Lotta:But there was no one else in there, and you know it!Phoenix:(The Channeling Chamber was very dark, almost pitch black... Was there really no one else in there? What about...?)behind the folding screen?Phoenix:What about... behind the folding screen? Did you check back there?Lotta:Reckgiven!Phoenix:Huh? What in the...?Lotta:Reckgiven! Ya know! \"Ya reckon!? That's a given!\" I took me a good look around the room once! There ain't no way anyone was hangin' out behind that foldin' screen!Judge:Hmm... If I may have a word with you, Ms. Hart...Lotta:Wh-What? Ya got a problem!?Judge:Reckgiven!... I mean, I am having a little difficulty in understanding you. If you would stop saying such things as \"Reckongiven\" and so forth... Aah!von Karma:Now then, Mr. Phoenix Wright, do you see a problem with the testimony or don't you?Leads back to cross-examinationbehind the door?Phoenix:What about... behind the door? Did you check there?Lotta:What do I look like to you? I wasn't born yesterday, ya know! First off, the one that bust that door open was you! With the way ya slammed that door, anyone standin' behind it woulda had more face and less nose, free of charge!von Karma:In any case, there was no one standing behind the door.Phoenix:(She actually had the police investigate that too!?)Leads back to cross-examinationunder the flooring?Phoenix:What about... under the flooring? Did you check there?Lotta:I ain't no ignoramus to make it out here!Phoenix:Huh?... Wh-What are you talking about?Lotta:Don't \"what are ya talkin' about\" me! Under the floorin'? C'mon!, even a bug wouldn't crawl under that!von Karma:Sorry to disappoint, but there was no secret passageway under the flooring.Phoenix:(Oh... Yeah, that was a bit far-fetched, huh...?)Leads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:(Argh! Her story adds up... What's worse, I was there at the scene of the crime with her... (Changed from [What's worse is that I was there at the scene of the crime at that time too,] in the original release) and her story is exactly how I would have told it, too... (Changed from [and her story is exactly how I would have told it...] in the original release))After pressing all statements:Phoenix:(Argh! Just as I thought, there is nothing wrong with her testimony! I was with her, so I know she's telling the truth...)Judge:Enough. It seems that there are no issues with Ms. Hart's testimony.von Karma:At the time of the crime, only two people were in the Channeling Chamber: the victim, Dr. Turner Grey, and the defendant, Maya Fey.Judge:Hmm... The face of the defendant can not be verified in this picture. However, if we think about the circumstances, it would have to be the defendant.Phoenix:(What am I going to do!? If I just let this go...)Judge:What is it, Mr. Wright? You look as if you have something to say...Phoenix:(If I make one wrong move, I'm going to have the judge against me... Is there anything I can present that would prove it's not Maya in that photo?)Present evidencePhoenix:Your Honor!Judge:Mr. Wright!Phoenix:It is possible that the person in this photo is not the defendant!Judge:Wh-Wh-What!? Do you know what you are proposing!?Lotta:Y-Y-Yeah! That's just plain fool's talk!Phoenix:(Thanks guys. Your show of support was just great...)von Karma:...Judge:...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof. Prove to this court that the person in this photo is not Maya Fey!Present anythingPhoenix:Phoenix:Here is your proof!von Karma:von Karma:...Phoenix:Is there a problem?von Karma:Oh, no. I thought I would work on my inflections. Just wondering what an \"Objection!\" with a twist of \"You're wrong!\" sounds like.Judge:Mr. Wright. I'm sorry, but I don't follow your logic.Phoenix:(Shoot. I guess I wasn't showing enough confidence...)Present another pieceLeads back to:\"...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof.\"Give upLeads to:\"Well, Mr. Wright?\"Can't present anything yetLeads to:\"Well, Mr. Wright?\"Judge:Well, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:Nothing, Your Honor...von Karma:That's very smart of you, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You really should give up trying to prove this is not Maya Fey.Phoenix:(I didn't say anything about giving up! I just don't have the right piece of evidence to prove my argument...)Judge:That's enough!Phoenix:(I-Is this it...? Is this all I could do...?)Judge:I think it is quite obvious to this court that a verdict of not guilty is not possible.von Karma:I told you. Totally, 100% impossible.Judge:Ms. von Karma, do you have any further questions for this witness?von Karma:Having established the defendant's guilt, further questioning won't be needed.Judge:What about the defense? No further questions, I presume?Phoenix:(I... I couldn't protect Maya...) The defense... The defense......Phoenix... ...Phoenix, you can't make that kind of face... ...A lawyer is someone who smiles... no matter how bad it gets!...Phoenix:M-Mia!Mia:I guess I made it just in time, wouldn't you say?Phoenix:Y-You... But... P-Pearls!Mia:Her clothes ARE a bit small... Anyway, what are you waiting for, Phoenix!? Let's go!Phoenix:B-But how!? She's already taken away every advantage!Mia:The advantage is still in your hand! Think carefully, one more time, about what you saw in the Channeling Chamber. Do you remember what you told me yesterday?Phoenix:D-Dr. Grey!!*klik*???:...I was... murdered...Phoenix:W-What!?*klik*Phoenix:Lotta! At a time like this!?Lotta:Times like this are perfect for snapping up shots!Mia:You see... There is one final piece to this puzzle. (Changed from [You see... There is one final piece of the puzzle.] in the original release)Phoenix:Mia...?Mia:Question Lotta one more time, Phoenix. I don't know if she's doing it unconsciously or on purpose, but... (Changed from [I don't know if she's doing it subconsciously or on purpose, but...] in the original release) she's not testifying truthfully.Judge:Now then, this court would like to end the cross-examination period.Phoenix:Phoenix:Please wait, Your Honor! The defense would like to request that the witness testify one more time.Judge:Overruled. I'm afraid you're too late, Mr. Wright. The cross-examination has already ended. Furthermore, any unrelated ques- Aah!von Karma:It's fine. I'll allow another testimony. A Von Karma's case is perfect. Absolutely flawless. And what better time than this for you to see that.Judge:B-But... I mean... I have some place I must go after this... Mmph! A-Al-Alright! I'll allow it! Ms. Hart! Hurry and give us another testimony!Lotta:Well... heck... What am I supposed to talk about?Phoenix:Please tell us once more, what happened when you burst into the Channeling Chamber.Lotta:OK! You got it!Mia:See, you got through to the judge somehow, right?Phoenix:(Well, actually it was Von Karma's whip that got through to him...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account, Pt. 2 --Lotta:When we broke into that room, all I could focus on was Maya.I was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it.I'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff.But I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot!Judge:Nothing sounds different from before...Phoenix:(Some parts of her testimony were very vague. I should press her on those sections!)von Karma:Struggle all you like as you taste the bitterness of your defeat. Well, amuse me with your useless questions, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I'm waiting...Cross Examination-- Witness' Account, Pt.2 --Lotta:When we broke into that room, all I could focus on was Maya.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So, what did she look like?Lotta:Ya know, she looked almost like a different person.Judge:A... A different person?von Karma:She may have seemed like a different person, however, she was still Maya Fey. We have already made that point abundantly clear!Judge:Yes, that is true... Well, then, Ms. Hart. Did you happen to see anything else?Lotta:I was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Then perhaps that body was not Dr. Grey's at all!Lotta:Eh!? W-Well... I reckon that's possible...von Karma:von Karma:If the body inside that room was not that of Dr. Grey, then whose body was it, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?Phoenix:Well, what if it was that of Maya Fey after the channeling? Or maybe -- Oww!von Karma:Foolish fool spouting foolish foolishness, just as I expect of a foolish fool such as you. If that were the case, then that would mean that Maya Fey is, in fact, dead. And that would make the defendant's chair quite a lonely place, wouldn't it!?Phoenix:(Urk... Sorry, Maya...)Lotta:Are y'all done here? Can I continue?Lotta:I'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:And even knowing that, you still persist in being a paranormal photographer?Lotta:That's why I'm getting out of this here business. This gal's gonna get the dirt on the stars and be a tabloid photographer from now on!Phoenix:(She goes through jobs faster than a baby through diapers.) Wah!von Karma:Mr. Phoenix Wright. Would it kill you to stay on topic for a change?Judge:Well? Would it, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:(Nice, tag-teamed in stereo. Guess I should be grateful it's not in 5.1...)Lotta:But I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot!PressPhoenix:Leads to:\"Two, right?\"Mia:There must be something we can use in her testimony just now. We must find it! At all costs...Phoenix:Two, right?Lotta:T-Two what?Phoenix:Two shots. You took two shots.Judge:But... Only one has been submitted as evidence!Phoenix:Ms. Hart! Where is the other picture you have been withholding!?Lotta:No, no, no! You've got it all wrong! It's not me! I-I didn't mean anything bad! I know I can be a little mean, but I ain't evil!Phoenix:(Well, at least she knows herself...)Judge:Then why have you not shown this \"other picture\" to this court yet?Lotta:Well, ain't it obvious!? That prosecutor woman told me to shut my trap about it!Phoenix:W-What!? V... Von Karma!!Judge:M-M-Ms. von Karma! Y-Y-You... You're hiding critical evidence...!von Karma:...Phoenix:(Unforgivable, von Karma. Suppressing evidence like this... You're as bad as your father!)Confront FranziskaPhoenix:Your Honor! The defense asks that Prosecutor von Karma be held in contempt of court!Judge:Hmm... Well, yes... Mngh!von Karma:Me? In contempt of court!? You can't be serious.Phoenix:But... But you hid evidence from the court... On purpose! That's... That's... That's not fair!Mia:P-Phoenix!! Are you a lawyer or a school child?Phoenix:(Ack! I was so angry I lost my composure...)Leads to:\"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?\"Leave it to the JudgePhoenix:(...Argh! I'm so mad that even my throat's clenching up! I'd better let the Judge handle this...)Leads to:\"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?\"Judge:Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?von Karma:I thought this picture was not important, and thus, felt no need to submit it. That's all.Phoenix:H-How could you think...!?von Karma:The pictures were more or less the same, so why bother with the second? I mean, it's just so much more trouble than it's worth for me to submit this as evidence.Phoenix:\"M-More trouble that [sic] it's worth!?\" How... How can you say that!?von Karma:If you want to see it that badly, I'll submit it.Lotta's Photo 2 added to the Court Record.Judge:... Wh-What is...? What is this picture!?von Karma:It's obviously the second picture the witness took that day at the scene of the crime. Well, it's a little off-center, but that's what you get with a nervous amateur.Judge:Um... I think the important point here is the person in this picture! (Changed from [Well, I think the important point here is the person in this picture!] in the original release) This is most definitely NOT Maya Fey! What is the meaning of this!?Phoenix:(This might be the break I was looking for... Now, should I or should I not insist that the person in this picture is not Maya?)Drop the issuePhoenix:... (It's no good. We've been through this so many times...)Judge:This is not like you, Mr. Wright! Why are you not objecting!? The person in this photo is clearly not the defendant and yet...von Karma:Ha ha ha... There is no way he can raise an objection and hope to live.Judge:Explain yourself!Leads to:\"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture.\"Insist it's not MayaPhoenix:Your Honor! As you can plainly see, the person in the picture is not Maya Fey!Judge:Y-Yes, I see that... It's not just her face! Her whole body has taken on a different appearance!Phoenix:There is only one conclusion that can be drawn, then. That somehow, this other person snuck in and traded places with the defendant!Judge:Order! Order! Order!! Well, yes, I believe you are correct, Mr. Wright! The person who was inside the Channeling Chamber was not Maya Fey!Phoenix:Mia! We did it!Mia:...You're too soft.Phoenix:Huh?Mia:You're softer than Aunt Morgan's strawberry desserts, Phoenix. Take a look at Prosecutor von Karma's face.Phoenix:(S-She's... smiling...!?)von Karma:I think you had better continue to worry, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Judge:M-Ms. von Karma! What do you mean by that?Leads to:\"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture.\"von Karma:Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture. This was taken yesterday at the Detention Center's Visitor's Room. This is Mr. Phoenix Wright and the defendant, Maya Fey during his visit...Judge:Maya Fey? But... Isn't this a totally different person!?von Karma:She looks this way because she is obviously in the middle of channeling a spirit!Judge:It's unbelievable... That she can...von Karma:Yet, it is the truth. (Changed from [However, it is true.] in the original release) When Maya Fey is in that state, she physically changes into the person she's calling!Judge:...Mia:Ms. von Karma. A word, if I may. (Changed from [I wonder if she knows what she's doing...] in the original release)Phoenix:(M-Mia!?) (Question mark not present in the original release)Mia:Taking pictures of someone during a private visit is illegal. Surely, you must know that that picture can't be submitted as evidence. (Changed from [That picture can't be submitted as evidence.] in the original release)von Karma:... Obviously, I know this picture is illegal. (Changed from [Obviously, this picture is illegal.] in the original release) But I never intended to submit it as evidence in the first place!Phoenix:(Wh-What is she...?)von Karma:From the moment I showed this picture to the court, this case became all mine. After all, this image has now been forever burned into the judge's mind.Judge:...Phoenix:(I... I don't have even a single witty line...)Mia:It looks like we've been had.Judge:I don't claim to understand this, and I still cannot believe it... Are you saying that this person... this person is the defendant, Maya Fey!?Phoenix:(If I give up here, the trial will end! But... If I slip up and say something wrong, it will cost me... Is there any way I can prove that the person in this picture is not Maya!?)I can't prove it.Phoenix:(It's no good! My argument doesn't hold any water!)Judge:I see the defense is staying silent on this one.Phoenix:...Yes... Your Honor...von Karma:And to think. I even gave you this chance to prove your point for free. But you couldn't even point yourself out in a line-up!Judge:Hmm... Yes... Well, then. I believe we have reached a conclusion.Mia:Phoenix!Phoenix:Y-Yes?Mia:You can't give up! Please, for me? Take a look at the Court Record again and try to find some way out of this jam!Phoenix:Yeah... Some way...Mia:The judge is about to close the trial. You can't let that happen!Phoenix:(Argh... It's come down to this!) Your Honor! Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now.Judge:What is it, now, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:Please! Please let me explain!Leads to:\"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\"I can prove it.Phoenix:Your Honor!Judge:Oh!

If that's the case, then it should be in this picture as well!Judge:Ms. von Karma!! Y-You... You intended to hide this valuable piece of evidence!?von Karma:...Judge:You will most certainly be assigned a penalty for this!Phoenix:(Alright. This should do some major damage to her argument...)Mia:Don't celebrate yet.Phoenix:You like to bring down the mood, don't you?Mia:Take a look at Ms. von Karma's face.Phoenix:(Argh! She's got that condescending grin plastered all over her face again.)von Karma:...Tsk, tsk, jumping the gun again, I see. Your Honor! I would like to extend an apology on behalf of those incompetent fools.Judge:Wh-What do you mean? And what \"incompetent fools\"...?von Karma:If those fools down at the precinct hadn't missed the bullet hole, I would have gotten a report about it. As I didn't, I could not have known that this picture was of any value to this case.Judge:Hmm, I see...Phoenix:(She's lying through her teeth! I know it! That woman knew about everything! The bullet hole, the picture -- everything!)Mia:But you can't prove that. Franziska von Karma's idea of a \"perfect case\" is quite fascinating, don't you think?von Karma:Your Honor. You need not worry. If you must assign a penalty, I'll personally make sure that detective gets what's coming. I'm sure there will be a great gnashing of teeth at the next salary discussion.Phoenix:(Poor Gumshoe...)Judge:In any case, this is a very big problem! When the defendant was taken into custody, her costume had a bullet hole in its sleeve. However, from this photo, it would appear that right after the shooting, there was none!von Karma:...Mia:The judge is confused by this strange twist of events. This is your chance, Phoenix! Load all you've got into this one shot, alright!?Phoenix:Got it! (Watch this, Maya!) Your Honor! There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!This picture is a fake.Phoenix:The fact that the defendant's costume has a bullet hole in its sleeve is a fact! Which can only mean one thing. That this picture is a fake!Judge:Wh-What!?Lotta:Hey! You callin' me a forger now!?Phoenix:Well, no, not you exactly... Well, not per se...Lotta:Oh no ya don't! Don't you be scratchin' yer head with that goofy smile like some monkey! Now, why do ya think I'd do somethin' that nasty!? C'mon now!Mia:Phoenix! Use your brain for a change!Phoenix:S-Sorry, Chief...Leads back to:\"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!\"The bullet hole was made later.Phoenix:There is only one explanation for why there is no hole in the sleeve in the picture! The hole was created much later, after the murder took place!Judge:A-After the murder!?Lotta:Hey! Those two gunshots we heard were before we broke in, or did ya forget!?Phoenix:Hmm... I-Is that how it went?von Karma:The pistol fired only two shots. No more, no less.Judge:You do know how to count, right?Mia:Phoenix! What are you doing!? Try it one more time!Phoenix:Y-Yes, Chief...Leads back to:\"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!\"The shooter is someone else.Leads to:\"The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it.\"Phoenix:The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it. However, this person clearly does not. There can be only one explanation. The person who shot Dr. Grey was not the defendant, but a different person altogether!von Karma:Wha-Whaaaat!?Judge:Order! Order! Order! If order is not restored, I will suspend this trial! Oww!Phoenix:Aah!Lotta:Why me!?von Karma:The defense's... The defense's argument is a complete mess!Phoenix:A complete mess? I fail to see how! Please, enlighten us.von Karma:Hey, witness!Lotta:Aah! What the heck!? Is that any way to ask a gal a favor!?von Karma:Be quiet you! You were the one who said it was only the two of them when you entered the room!Lotta:Well, ya know...von Karma:If you were lying, I swear that my whip will be the last thing you see!Lotta:L-Look, sis... You're lookin' mighty scary so why don't we say you... Waah! I-I swear! I wasn't lyin' or nothin'! There wasn't anyone else in there! Honest!von Karma:You see! Now riddle me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where did the defendant vanish to!? And where did this other woman appear from!?Phoenix:Umm... (Why is it lately, all I want to do is cry...?)Judge:Well, if the person in this picture is not the defendant, then this poses 2 very big questions. First, where did the defendant vanish to, and second, where did this person come from?von Karma:That's right! Now hurry up and answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Mia:Come on! You can't fall apart here, Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:(I can't believe that even Mia's calling me by my full name... But... I mean... How am I supposed to prove something like this!?)von Karma:Had enough yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Or do you think you have enough in you to turn things around even now!?Phoenix:(To \"turn things around\"... That's right. Mia would always turn things around and change her perspective!)Mia:Phoenix...?Phoenix:(So, where did this intruder appear from, and where did Maya disappear to? I need to look at this situation from a different angle! Let's see... What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room... And what if Maya had left that room somehow... If I could prove that either one of those conditions were true...)Judge:Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you've come up with.Phoenix:I think what happened before we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber is...a 3rd person had entered it.Phoenix:Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence! I have proof that there was someone else in the room before the murder took place!Present anythingPhoenix:Phoenix:Please take a good look at this!Judge:...Okay...von Karma:I've already seen it.Phoenix:Thank you.Judge:And? What is the purpose of this item?Phoenix:Don't you see, Your Honor?von Karma:I don't think you actually see what you are doing.Phoenix:... *sigh*Judge:I think it is the court that should be sighing at you, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:(Ouch, that stung...)Present another pieceLeads back to:\"Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence!\"Think it over againPhoenix:(I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...)Leads back to:\"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\"Maya had left the room.Phoenix:Maya had left the Channeling Chamber at some point! And the defense can prove this!von Karma:Oh, how a foolish fool makes a foolish face while dreaming foolishly foolish dreams. Maya Fey was being looked after by her aunt, Morgan Fey. The chances of her leaving the crime scene is lower than that detective's salary!Judge:Anyway, let's see some evidence. Prove that from the murder until the time of arrest, the defendant had left the room.Present Black KeyPhoenix:Leads to:\"Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key?\"Present anything elsePhoenix:The evidence you're looking for is... this?Judge:...Lotta:Why the heck is there a \"?\" at the end there for!?Phoenix:Well, actually, I'm not really sure about this evidence, you know...?Judge:Next time, only present evidence you actually do have faith in.Phoenix:(Oww... That burned...)Present another pieceLeads back to:\"Anyway, let's see some evidence.\"Think it over againPhoenix:(I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...)Leads back to:\"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\"something I can't explain yet.Phoenix:I'm sorry, but I simply can't.von Karma:Y-You see!? And the reason is quite simple. Because there is no explanation. That's why!Judge:Hmm... As I thought. Another big waste of this court's time.Mia:Phoenix! You can't just give up like that!Phoenix:But Mia!Mia:Rethink things one more time! There has to be an explanation!von Karma:I'm already \"perfect\". So of course, my conclusions are also \"perfect\".Phoenix:(Grr... Alright, Wright. Calm down and let's try this one more time!)Leads back to:\"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\"Phoenix:Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key?Lotta:Um... Well, I've seen it... Hey! That's the Channeling Chamber key, right? Before the channeling started, Maya locked the door from the inside with that...von Karma:The defendant herself locked the door...?Lotta:Yeah! That's why we all couldn't get the door open. That key's the only one of its kind, after all.Judge:Oh... One of a kind, you say?von Karma:...! Wait... Mr. Phoenix Wright...Phoenix:Yes? (It looks like she's catching on...)von Karma:I'm afraid to ask, but... Why is that key currently in your possession?Judge:Huh? What do you mean?Phoenix:If Maya Fey locked herself in, then the key should have been with her.Judge:Yes, agreed.Phoenix:However, she did not have the key at the time of her arrest!Lotta:Aah! Well, ain't that a kick! So how come you're holdin' it!?Phoenix:I got this as a present from a certain little girl. And that little girl was nowhere near the crime scene at the time!von Karma:Th-Th-That's preposterous!Phoenix:This means that Maya Fey must have left the room! If she had not, then I would not be holding this key you see before you!von Karma:N-Nooooooo!Judge:It seems we have come to an impasse. This picture has clearly captured the face of the murderer. However, is this person the defendant or not? The defense is arguing that this person is not the defendant. Furthermore, as proof, this key has been submitted as evidence. Ms. von Karma.von Karma:How. Can. This. Be!?Judge:At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant's guilt is not possible. (Changed from [At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant is not possible.] in the original release)von Karma:My perfect case! How is there a flaw in my perfect case! Don't think you've won yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright! I am a prodigy! I have never lost a case! And I don't intend to lose here in this courtroom to a fool like you! I don't care what I have to do... I will get my guilty verdict!Judge:That's enough! If you would like to continue, do so in the lobby. Court will reconvene tomorrow at 10 AM. That is all. Court is adjourned.June 21, 1:32 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Maya:Woooow! That was you Pearly!? You summoned my sis!?Pearl:Yes. I felt I had no choice...Maya:Great going, Pearly! I knew you were special! Hey, Nick, did you know?Phoenix:(...Umm, yeah. It's not like anyone else in there could have done that.)Maya:Hmm, Nick... I know you're trying really hard and all, but... I really don't remember ever leaving that room.Pearl:And I don't think that a third person... could have gone into that room.Phoenix:Y-Yeah... Well, at least we have until tomorrow to figure things out. Like, what happened in that room, for instance.Maya:Yeah. I'm counting on you!Pearl:Ah... I envy the two of you...Maya:Oh, by the way, Nick. Do you think you could take Pearly back home for me?Phoenix:Sure. Alright, Pearls. You ready to go buy some tickets?Pearl:Huh? A tik-ket?Phoenix:(Poor thing... So sheltered.)To be continued.Presenting wrong evidence during testimonyPhoenix:Phoenix:Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?Judge:Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.Phoenix:It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...Judge:You don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied.Phoenix:(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimonyPhoenix:Phoenix:Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!Judge:...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...Phoenix:Huh? Really?Judge:Objection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)Presenting wrong evidence during testimonyPhoenix:Phoenix:This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!Judge:How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?Phoenix:They aren't, are they...Judge:Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.Phoenix:(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimonyPhoenix:Phoenix:The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!Judge:... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)Too many penaltiesJudge:That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maya Fey...GuiltyJudge:The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all.

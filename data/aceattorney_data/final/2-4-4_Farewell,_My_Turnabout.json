You're gonna prove me not guilty today, right?Phoenix:\n...Phone:\n...*beep*...Engarde:\nHahaha... If you please, Mister Lawyer. Remember, it's not just me. Your precious friend's life is riding on today's verdict too.Phoenix:\nGrr...!Maya:\nNow listen up! You'd better get Engarde a guilty sentence, OK!? If you get that creepy slimebag a not guilty, I'll never forgive you, ever!Phoenix:\n(...Maya...)???:\nPhoenix... Phoenix!Phoenix:\nM-Mia! Maya! How's Maya!?Mia:\n...I don't know.Phoenix:\nYou don't know...?Mia:\nShe hasn't tried to channel me since yesterday.Phoenix:\nMia... What... What am I supposed to do...?Mia:\n... Well, like I said. For a lawyer, the worst of times are when you have to force your biggest smiles.Phoenix:\nB-But!Mia:\nYou can't give up! There's still some hope left.Phoenix:\nStop it, please!

Then, you have some sort of lead...!?Gumshoe:\nSorry, but right now we've got zero leads on the guy... But we're not going to give up!Phoenix:\nGumshoe...Gumshoe:\nUntil the trial is over... until the verdict is handed down, we're going to do everything we can and find De Killer! If we can get Maya out, then you can get Engarde the guilty verdict he deserves, pal!Phoenix:\n(That's true, I could do that if they found Maya first...)Gumshoe:\nYou got that!? So you have to do whatever you can to make the trial last longer!Phoenix:\nI have to make the trial last longer?Gumshoe:\nIf you go at Mr. Edgeworth with everything you've got, then you two can draw it out!Phoenix:\n(Oh, now I get it...)Gumshoe:\nI believe in you, pal! You and Mr. Edgeworth can do it! So! Believe in us! We're going to give it all we've got, just like you!Phoenix:\nGot it! Thanks Gumshoe!Phone:\n...*beep*...Mia:\n...Hey, Phoenix. You understand now, don't you? You have something money will never be able to buy. Friendship. It's the strongest weapon in the world and you have it in abundance.Phoenix:\n...Yeah! (Looks like we're coming to the end... I have to make the trial last as long as I can! Gumshoe will come through, I know it!)March 23, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Matt Engarde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.Judge:\nNow, as I recall, we concluded yesterday's session with a big mystery on our hands. The mystery being what exactly was Ms. Adrian Andrews' role in this murder? That is to say, is she really connected to the crime itself? Mr. Edgeworth, if you would please inform the court of today's proceedings.Edgeworth:\nAdrian Andrews. She forged evidence that threw suspicion onto Mr. Engarde, and then proceeded to escape the crime scene by wearing a Nickel Samurai costume. The guilt of these actions are those from which she cannot escape.Judge:\nHmm, then you're saying that she is guilty after all...?Edgeworth:\nI'm not finished, Your Honor. Ms. Andrews has nothing to do with committing the actual murder.Phoenix:\n...!Edgeworth:\nI would like to direct the court's attention to this card.Judge:\nWhat is that...? It looks like a shell...Edgeworth:\nThis is the calling card of a certain assassin.Judge:\nA-Assassin, you say!?Edgeworth:\nYes, Juan Corrida was killed by a professional assassin! And the person who hired the assassin, his client so to speak, is Matt Engarde!Judge:\nWh-What a surprising turn of events!Edgeworth:\nI would think it's become commonplace by now, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(I know what's going on this time... So I know that everything Edgeworth has said is true...)Mia:\nBut we still have to hold out as long as we can. At least, until Maya's safe and sound.Phoenix:\nI wonder how the trial will turn out today...?Judge:\nNow then, please call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant's \"mentor\", Mr. Will Powers to the stand.Edgeworth:\nNow then, witness. Your name and occupation, please.Powers:\nO-OK. I'm... Uh... Will Powers. I'm a poor, underpaid action star...Edgeworth:\nAnd what is your relation to the defendant?Powers:\nWell, that's... I guess I'm sort of a lousy mentor to him in a way. Yeah.Judge:\nUm, Mr. Powers. Please... You don't need to put yourself down so much.Powers:\nOh, uh, sorry. Well, but I'm just kind of a nothing sort of guy.Edgeworth:\nOn the night of the murder, you visited the defendant's room. Is this correct?Powers:\nY-Yes.Phoenix:\n...! (I... I didn't know that...)Powers:\nUm, but you know... I didn't actually get to see Matt when I went...Edgeworth:\nAll you need to do is answer what you're asked. Now then, I would like you to please testify about when you went to Mr. Engarde's room.Powers:\nO-OK... Sure...Witness Testimony-- Visit to Matt's Room --Powers:\nAfter the award ceremony, I went by myself to Matt's room.\nMatt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume.\nHe was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.\nI watched the two of them for a while, but then I gave up and went back.\nI had guests with me that night, and I couldn't make them wait for me.Judge:\nHmm... Nothing sounds out of place in Mr. Powers' testimony.Phoenix:\n(And talking with the bellboy is no big deal...)Edgeworth:\nIf one assumes that the person Mr. Engarde was speaking with was an ordinary bellboy...Judge:\nWh-What are you implying?Edgeworth:\nWell, Mr. Wright. Let's have your cross-examination, shall we?Mia:\nLooks like we're in another sticky situation.Phoenix:\nHuh?Mia:\nA trap. Can't you smell it, Phoenix?

Why did you stop?\nPowers:\nM-M-Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What is it?\nPowers:\nYou... You're going to try to trick me into a corner, aren't you?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nPowers:\nI... I know I'm just a poor, underpaid action star, but... But... I... I'm not the killer!\nPhoenix:\nUm, no one said you were, Mr. Powers.\nPowers:\nNo, please! Don't trick me! Every time you do your lawyer thing, the witness suddenly turns into the bad guy...\nPhoenix:\n(\"Every time\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\n...Witness. I will personally talk to the defense at a later time. So for now, please kindly cooperate and continue with your testimony.\nPowers:\nS-Sorry...\nJudge:\nSo, you went to the defendant's room. And then?\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, wait a minute! When and how did I suddenly turn into the bad guy here??)Powers:\nMatt was standing there in front of his room, still in his Nickel Samurai costume.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure that was Matt Engarde?\nPowers:\nYeah, I'm sure. He wasn't wearing the Nickel Samurai mask then.\nPhoenix:\n(If that's the case, then he really can't be mistaken...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd? What was the defendant doing, standing in front of his own room?Powers:\nHe was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"At first\"? What do you mean by that?\nPowers:\nWell, he was in a bellboy-ish uniform and he had a bottle of juice on a tray.\nPhoenix:\n...Sounds like an ordinary bellboy to me.\nPowers:\nUm, yeah, but... I didn't think he was a normal bellboy.\nPhoenix:\nAnd why was that?\nPowers:\nUm... Why did I think that, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nH-How am I supposed to know!?\nPowers:\nSorry, but I can't remember right now. ...Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I'm going to have to wait patiently on this one...)Press (after pressing fourth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"At first\"? What do you mean by that?\nPowers:\nI didn't think he was a normal bellboy.\nPhoenix:\nAnd why was that?\nPowers:\nUm... Why did I think that, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nH-How am I supposed to know!? (...Hey, wait a second...) Actually, Mr. Powers, only a few minutes ago, you stated:\n\n\nPowers:\nUm... You know, I did feel something weird. I think it was because Matt... Well, he gave the bellboy a tip.\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould it be that you felt something \"strange\" about the tip-giving incident itself...?\nPowers:\n... AH! Yeah! That's it! You really know your job!\nJudge:\nHmm... Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nThis bellboy... He wasn't an ordinary one, was he...?\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps we should let the witness tell us.\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Powers. Please amend your testimony.\nPowers:\nYou mean about the bellboy, right?\nChanges statement from \"He was talking with someone. At first, I thought it was the bellboy.\" to \"Matt gave the bellboy a tip.\"Powers:\nMatt gave the bellboy a tip.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo he gave the bellboy a tip. What's so strange about that?\nPowers:\nAh, well, you see, Matt's not a poor penny-pincher like me. I was trying to figure out how much it was because the tip really shocked me.\nPhoenix:\n\"How much it was\"...?\nPowers:\nBut that's when something even more surprising happened! The bellboy was putting the tip he got in his pocket. And that's when I got my first good look at the guy's face... I was really shocked!\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm afraid I don't follow at all.\nPhoenix:\n(It sounds like Mr. Powers was surprised twice by this event. I wonder which of his shocking moments I should ask about...?)\n\n\n\nThe bellboy's face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was so shocking about the bellboy's face, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nWell, he wasn't exactly a \"boy\"... more like an old \"gramps\"...\nJudge:\nAhem! I hope you know that discrimination towards old men is a no-no in my court!\nPowers:\nNo, no, that's not what I meant at all! In the smack middle of the guy's face, there was a line of stitches!\nJudge:\nA line of stitches...?\nPowers:\nYeah! And it went straight from the tippy top of his head to the bottom of his chin! Almost like if that thread snapped, all the stuff in his head would come spilling out.\nPhoenix:\n... Ah! (He was there... At Engarde's house... He was that BUTLER!)\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nA-Ah, nothing, Your Honor! (So that means Engarde was talking with De Killer then. If that fact were to be exposed, Engarde would be declared guilty in a blink!)\nMia:\nPhoenix, you have to play dumb here! Pretend you don't know anything!\nPhoenix:\nYes, Chief!\nJudge:\nYou sure you don't have something you would like to say, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Umm... What did you just say, Your Honor?\nJudge:\n... Nothing, Mr. Wright. Nothing. We're just going around and around in circles. Now then, Mr. Powers. Please continue with your testimony.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nEngarde's tip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The defendant is a huge star. He can afford to give generous tips, wouldn't you agree?\"Powers:\nI watched the two of them for a while, but then I gave up and went back.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou saw the two of them, the bellboy and the defendant, together, correct?\nPowers:\nYeah. The bellboy just wanted to say congrats.\nPhoenix:\nNow, while you were watching the two of them, did you notice anything strange?\nPowers:\nUm... You know, I did feel something weird. I think it was because Matt... Well, he gave the bellboy a tip.\nPhoenix:\nA tip? (But that's a perfectly normal thing to do...)\nJudge:\nSo, how long did you watch the two of them?\nPowers:\nAh, not more than a minute or two, I think.Powers:\nI had guests with me that night, and I couldn't make them wait for me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo who are these \"guests\" you're talking about?\nPowers:\nYou guys, of course. You and Maya and little Pearl. I thought it would be really rude since I invited you guys, if I disappeared on you... So I went back to my seat pretty soon after seeing Matt in the hallway.\nPhoenix:\n(This is like squeezing water from a stone... It's probably pointless to press further...)Mia:\nDo you remember this incident? Did Mr. Powers leave his seat that night?Phoenix:\nI don't remember that happening at all. Maya was making such a racket in her hyper state... I ended up focusing on her.Mia:\n...I see. In any case, from his story, he probably wasn't gone for very long.Phoenix:\nThe defendant is a huge star. He can afford to give generous tips, wouldn't you agree?Powers:\nUm, sure. But giving him that much was maybe a little too much, I think...Phoenix:\n(\"A little too much\"...?)Edgeworth:\nWould you please clarify for the court, about how much would you say the defendant gave to the bellboy?Powers:\nHonestly, I don't know. I can't even begin to guess.Judge:\nAnd why is that?Powers:\nBecause he gave the bellboy a really, really fat roll of cash.Phoenix:\nA ROLL OF CASH!?Judge:\nAh, well... How interesting... That certainly was a very generous tip, wasn't it?Edgeworth:\nA very fat roll of cash... That can hardly be called a \"tip\", Your Honor!Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(The judge is beginning to look awfully suspicious of us...)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant is a superstar! That kind of tip is typical fare for people like him!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you saying that all superstars are super-spenders!? If I could receive large rolls of cash by simply bringing people things on trays... Then why on Earth would I stand around here prosecuting!?\nPhoenix:\n(He's got a point... I don't even get paid, let alone rolls of cash for all my hard work.)\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm, so supposing that roll of cash was not a tip...\"Wait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing I can really object to here. I mean, who can argue that a fat roll of money isn't really odd...?)\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm, so supposing that roll of cash was not a tip...\"Judge:\nHmm, so supposing that roll of cash was not a tip... Then what was it?Edgeworth:\nPayment, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nPayment...?Edgeworth:\nIsn't it obvious? For the murder of Mr. Juan Corrida.Judge:\nThen... Then the bellboy the witness saw...Edgeworth:\nYes, he was the assassin.Judge:\nH-Hold your horses now! Mr. Edgeworth, you don't have any proof of this... do you?Edgeworth:\nHave I ever been unprepared to support my claims, Your Honor? I have here, the card Shelly de Killer left at the scene of the crime.Judge:\nShelly... de Killer...Edgeworth:\nHe is the person the police's special investigations team has been chasing for ages. I am certain that the person the witness saw was this very assassin, Shelly de Killer!Powers:\nR-Really!?Judge:\n...? What's wrong, Mr. Powers?Powers:\nNo, nothing. Something just clicked in my head and I think I just figured something out!Judge:\nOh?Powers:\nActually, I saw that bellboy again later on that night!Phoenix:\nWHAAAT!?Judge:\nMr. Powers! Please testify! Tell us what you saw!Powers:\nYes, sir! Right away!Witness Testimony-- The Second Time --Powers:\nThis time, I was in that hallway because I had to go to the bathroom!\nAnd that's when that bellboy I saw earlier came out of the room!\nOf course, when I say \"room\", I mean Juan Corrida's room!\nNow that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!\nYeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!\nI mean...Edgeworth:\nThank you very much. That is all we need for now.Powers:\nHuh? But I'm not done. There's still more...Edgeworth:\nLet us first establish that the bellboy was truly Mr. de Killer. Then we shall see.Judge:\nHmm... So the bellboy came out of the victim's room... And if that bellboy really was the assassin... Then, I think the answer is fairly obvious.Edgeworth:\nThat would be correct, Your Honor. Well, Mr. Wright. I believe it's your turn... to entertain and make us laugh.Phoenix:\nHa. Ha. Ha. Ha.Mia:\nThis is no laughing matter!Cross Examination",

The award ceremony ended around 8 PM, right? ...And I went to Matt's room pretty soon after that... And then I came back... And then I went to the bathroom... ... So I guess maybe it was around 8:10 PM by that time?\nJudge:\nYou're not one for details, are you Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nS-Sorry...

Why the insipid grin?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe because I have no idea what damaging thing he's going to say next...?)\nPowers:\nUm, well, the bellboy was empty-handed.\nPhoenix:\nEmpty-handed?\nPowers:\nThat bellboy was one of those room-service people, right? But he wasn't pushing a cart and he wasn't holding a tray either! You'd call that \"a little strange\" too, wouldn't you?\nJudge:\nHmm... I agree that it is a bit strange, Mr. Powers.\nPhoenix:\n(But is it really that unusual for a bellboy to be empty-handed? What should I do? Should I let Mr. Powers' testimony slide or...?)\n\n\n\nLet it slide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou're right.

You thought the bellboy was a little suspicious, correct?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nTry to pull a fast one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is nothing strange or unusual about an empty-handed bellboy!\nPowers:\nBut there really, really is!\nPhoenix:\nThere really, really isn't!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf you two are done being schoolchildren... Bellboys are for room service. There is no reason for them to be empty-handed, ever. Your Honor! I ask that the witness' previous statement be supplanted with this new one.\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... Edgeworth... Are you going to do whatever you can to make the bellboy look suspicious?)\nJudge:\nI see. Very well, this court recognizes and grants the prosecution's request. Mr. Powers, if you could amend your testimony, please.\nPowers:\nY-Yes, sir.\nChanges statement from \"Now that I think about it, that bellboy did seem kinda out of place!\" to \"I thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!\"Powers:\nI thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying that it's suspicious for him to be empty-handed?\nPowers:\nYeah, really suspicious. I mean, when I first saw that bellboy, he was holding a tray in his hand! And there was a bottle of juice and a wine glass on it!\nPhoenix:\nJuice...? What kind of juice was it?\nPowers:\nUm, I'm pretty sure it was tomato juice...\nMia:\nIf we could come up with some sort of reason as to why he would come out empty-handed, some sort of proof, then I think we can dodge the bullet on this one for now.\nPhoenix:\nProof, huh? (Sounds like another job for the Court Record!)Present Wine Glass or Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Powers.\"Powers:\nYeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't be so quick to judge!\nPowers:\nAh, but it's kind of a Powers family thing. \"Think of every person as a thief\".\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess a thief and an assassin are both sneaky and silent...)\nMia:\nThat's not the point, Phoenix.Mia:\nIn any case, if that bellboy was the assassin, it would be very bad for us.Phoenix:\nBut... he really is the assassin, you know?Mia:\nYes... But. You can't give in yet. If you want to prolong this trial for as long as possible, you're going to have to pull some cheap tricks on this one.Phoenix:\nMr. Powers.Powers:\nY-Y-Yes?Phoenix:\nYou're easily influenced by other people's words, aren't you? As soon as you heard that the bellboy might have been the killer, you got caught up in believing it must be true.Powers:\nBut... But... Isn't he really suspicious!? He's got all those stitches, and... and...Phoenix:\nSo? A baseball has stitches! Are you saying all baseballs are suspicious because they have stitches!?Powers:\n*gulp!* Well, there's also... I mean, what about him being empty-handed!?Phoenix:\nI would like to ask the court to please take a look here.Judge:\nThis is... the crime scene...Phoenix:\nThere is a wine glass sitting next to Mr. Corrida's body. The liquid inside this glass is tomato juice. And now, if you would look at what is on top of the table in the lower right corner here... Anyone can clearly see that it is a tray with a bottle of tomato juice on it! The bellboy had just brought this to Mr. Corrida's room. He left the tray in the room, which is why he was empty-handed when he left!Powers:\nAah!Judge:\nB-But! That would mean that the bellboy had seen and left a dead body in the room!Phoenix:\nAh, but can you prove that Mr. Corrida was already dead at that time?Judge:\nUh... M-Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\n...Yes?Judge:\nI-I blame you for leading me down this route!Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. I'm terribly sorry...Phoenix:\n(What is with him? Why is he laughing??)Edgeworth:\nWitness. Isn't there one more thing you would like to share with us?Powers:\nI-Is there?Edgeworth:\nThe bellboy was empty-handed... Or should I say empty-\"hand\"ed? I recall you had something interesting to say about his hands...Powers:\nOh yeah! I almost forgot!Phoenix:\nHuh? Wh-What...?Powers:\nThat bellboy -- he was wearing gloves!Phoenix:\nGloves?Powers:\nYeah, pitch black, leather ones. All the other bellboys don't wear gloves like that, right?Judge:\nBlack leather gloves... Why didn't you mention them earlier!?Powers:\nS-Sorry... It slipped my mind.Phoenix:\n(Argh! Boy does this make the bellboy look really suspicious... Alright, got to focus. I can't get lax here!) So what if he had gloves? A lot of bellboys wear gloves!Powers:\nCome on, Mr. Wright! That bellboy was wearing black leather ones!Phoenix:\nSo? A football is made of leather! Are you saying all footballs are suspicious because they are made of leather!?Powers:\n*gulp!*Judge:\nBut that man... He received a large roll of cash from the defendant. And then he was seen leaving the crime scene wearing black leather gloves. I don't think that even someone like myself can believe he was just another bellboy...Phoenix:\nUrgh...Edgeworth:\nIt seems that we have finally come to an understanding... Now then, witness. Please continue with the rest of your testimony.Phoenix:\nThe rest...?Judge:\nOh yes, please tell us more.Powers:\nOK!Witness Testimony-- Their Second Meeting --Powers:\nAfter leaving Juan's room, the bellboy went and knocked on Matt's door, just like that.\nHe gave something to the person inside the room.\nThen the old guy just left, without even going into the room.\nAfter that, I went to the bathroom and then back to my seat.Judge:\nSo the bellboy, after leaving the crime scene, next went to the defendant's room...?Powers:\nYeah. I kinda saw all that by accident...Phoenix:\n(Some accident! I'd say you saw too much! And all of it was suspicious to high heaven...)Judge:\nHmm... I think it's safe to say that we can no longer consider this bellboy to be \"normal\". Now then, let's get started, shall we?

Is all this really that important?\nEdgeworth:\nOf course, Your Honor. I think this is of the utmost importance. This is when whatever was removed from the crime scene was handed over to the client!\nJudge:\nHmm... Mr. Powers, please, try to remember what it was the bellboy handed off.\nPowers:\nUm... Well, let's see... Hmm... I think it was... No...\nJudge:\nIf you remember, please add it to your testimony.\nPowers:\nY-Yes, sir.\nAdds statement \"If I saw it again, I could say for sure, but I think it was some sort of wooden statue.\"\n\n\n\n\nAsk about this \"something\" (before selecting \"Ask about the person inside\" or after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHe gave \"something\" to this person?\nPowers:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was this \"something\"?\nPowers:\nHah hah hah. If I remembered what it was, I wouldn't be calling it a \"something\", would I?\nJudge:\nBut this implies that something was removed from the scene of the crime! Are you sure you really can't remember, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUmm... I think it was something kinda small...\nEdgeworth:\nThis is an incredibly crucial piece of information. Please, try to remember what it was.\nPowers:\nUmm... I'll try...\nEdgeworth:\nIn the meantime, let's talk of another point. Namely, what the bellboy did next.\nPowers:\nOh, so after he gave the person inside the room the thing...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about this \"something\" (after selecting \"Ask about the person inside\", before adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHe gave \"something\" to this person?\nPowers:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was this \"something\"?\nPowers:\nHah hah hah.

Are you sure you really can't remember, Mr. Powers?\nPowers:\nUmm... I think it was something kinda small...\nEdgeworth:\nI would like to summarize the testimony up to this point, if you don't mind. When the bellboy left the crime scene, he immediately went to the defendant's room. There, he handed a small item of some sort to the person inside. As for the person who received the item, all you could see was the person's arm...\nPowers:\nYes, yes! It was just like that!\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth.

I should probably move on to a different topic...) So what did the bellboy do after that?\nLeads back to cross-examinationPowers:\nIf I saw it again, I could say for sure, but I think it was some sort of wooden statue.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA statue?\nPowers:\nYeah... It kinda looked like one I guess. If I saw the actual thing again, I'd probably remember, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like for this trial to proceed... I'm going to have to come up with whatever this \"statue\" thing is and show it to him.)\nMia:\nYou're going to have to trust your instinct on this one and take a chance, Phoenix.\nJudge:\nWell Mr. Powers, let's continue with your testimony. What did the bellboy do after that?Present Figurine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Powers:\nThen the old guy just left, without even going into the room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhere did this bellboy go after he left Mr. Engarde's room?\nPowers:\nHmm... He opened the door to Viola Hall, went in there, and who knows after that, right?\nPhoenix:\n(Nngh... I do...)Powers:\nAfter that, I went to the bathroom and then back to my seat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see anything strange, suspicious, or just out of the ordinary at that time?\nPowers:\nOh yeah, I saw that one thing!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? (He saw something else!?)\nPowers:\nThere was this jittery alien with a ray gun... It was watching Juan's door like some sort of stalker.\nJudge:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... Um, I think we can forget about the alien...Phoenix:\nWell, Mr. Powers' testimony just now was just as vague as his first.Mia:\nIt's a little troublesome, isn't it? But I'm sure if you press him enough, everything will become clearer. Although, that just makes it harder on us, doesn't it?Phoenix:\nUgh... Talk about a lose-lose situation.Phoenix:\n...Powers:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\n...Edgeworth:\nWhat was the point of that pregnant pause!?Judge:\nWhere did that objection come from!? Well, speak up!Phoenix:\nUh, it was me, Your Honor...Mia:\nWhat is it, Phoenix?Phoenix:\nI have a feeling that something bad is going to happen once I show this...Judge:\nMr. Wright! If you have something to say, please spit it out!Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (OK Phoenix, deep breath...) Mr. Powers. The \"something\" you saw... Was it this item?Powers:\nOh, hey! That's it! That's the something! Wow, Mr. Wright. You really figured it out.Edgeworth:\nHmm, I recall we found this at Matt Engarde's mansion...Judge:\nAt the d-defendant's house!? What does this mean!?Edgeworth:\nIt's simple, Your Honor. Shelly de Killer assassinated Juan Corrida in his room. And then he stole this wooden bear from the scene of the crime.Judge:\nThen, the bear being found at Mr. Engarde's mansion would mean...Edgeworth:\nIt goes without saying, Your Honor. Mr. Matt Engarde is De Killer's client!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! ...I said ORDER!!! Mr. Wright. This is a most unfortunate turn of events for you.Phoenix:\nYeah... Sorry, Mia.Mia:\nNo, it's alright. Your judgment was sound. Actually, I figured the bear would come up. If not now, then it would have later on. Even if you hadn't shown it to the court, I'm sure your friend Edgeworth would've.Phoenix:\n(Ah, I almost forgot that he knew about it too...)Judge:\nHmm... I think it is clear that there is no need for us to continue this trial.Phoenix:\n(I... I can't let this happen! I have to do something... There has to be something we've overlooked!) Your Honor! A minute, please!Judge:\nY-Yes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nThere are still a few points left that we have not fully explored!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you trying to pull!?Judge:\nOh... Well, we can't have that. Alright, Mr. Wright. What questionable point would you like to explore further?Powers' testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers' testimony, of course!\nPowers:\nHuh? I know that my testimony was kind of shaky, but --\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour inanity stupefies me, Mr. Wright. We have already clarified all questionable points during the cross-examination just now!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nEdgeworth:\nWasting time like this, calling the testimony questionable... I'd say it's your head that's questionable here!\nPhoenix:\nAaah!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree. The cross-examination went smoothly and there was nothing wrong with the testimony. Now then, I believe --\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nP-Please! Wait!\nJudge:\nYou are being very persistent today.\nPhoenix:\n(Because I can't let it end like this!) I know my outburst just now was a little... questionable.\nEdgeworth:\nQuestionable indeed.\nPhoenix:\nBut! There really are some questionable points left to discuss, Your Honor!\nLeads back to:\n\"What are you trying to pull!?\"The person who received the bear (before selecting \"The bear itself\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere was one thing in Mr. Powers' testimony that was very unclear. And that is the identity of the person who received the bear!\n\n\nPowers:\nHe gave something to the person inside the room.\n\n\nPowers:\nI'm sorry, but I only saw the person's arm.\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs long as we don't know who it was that took the bear, we can't be sure of...\nPowers:\nAaaaaaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nJudge:\n...?\nPowers:\n...............?\nJudge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Powers!? If you're going to scream like that, then at least give us a good reason why!\nPowers:\nO-Oh, yeah... Sorry. Actually... So... I remembered. Um... I remembered who took the bear...\nPhoenix:\nWha--!?\nJudge:\nReally!?\nPowers:\nI mean, I only saw his arm... But... But... The arm... It was the Nickel Samurai's arm! I swear it!\nPhoenix:\nYOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!!\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure of that, Mr. Powers!?\nPowers:\nYeah! I'm sure it was the Nickel Samurai!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! It looks like you've dug your own grave... yet again.\nPhoenix:\n(How many times is that today? ...I've lost count...)\nEdgeworth:\nSo the person who took in this little bear was the Nickel Samurai. And, as we all know, Matt Engarde is the Nickel Samurai!\nJudge:\nThanks to the defense, we've made that all the clearer.\nPhoenix:\nWhat am I supposed to do now!? Mia, help!\nMia:\nYou don't have time to act lost. You've got to find another angle to attack this from! Hurry!\nJudge:\nNow, I will bring this cross-examination to --\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor!\nJudge:\nAgain, Mr. Wright? We've already removed any and all questionable areas of this testimony.\nEdgeworth:\nIt's about time you were removed from this court, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(I have to find something... Even one more little point will do!) There are... There are still questions left unanswered!\nLeads back to:\n\"What are you trying to pull!?\"The person who received the bear (after selecting \"The bear itself\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere was one thing in Mr. Powers' testimony that was very unclear.

Which means that since the murder occurred, he has not had a chance to go home!\nJudge:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nI think Your Honor has already figured out what I'm trying to say. It is not possible that it was Mr. Engarde who took this bear to his mansion!\nJudge:\nWh-Why, that's very true! We didn't consider that point, Mr. Wright! There was no way, timewise, for the defendant to have taken this bear home.\nPhoenix:\n(Phew... Disaster averted it looks--\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou haven't gotten the best of me yet, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nEdgeworth:\nI remember it clear as day.

And De Killer was hiding at Engarde Mansion... as its butler.\nJudge:\nWh-What a... bold move...\nEdgeworth:\nThe bear figurine was brought back to Engarde Mansion by De Killer himself.

The client who hired the assassin to commit the murder was Mr. Matt Engarde! ... I see no reason for this trial to continue. Therefore, I will now hand down my verdict!Edgeworth:\nThank you, Your Honor, for your understanding. You see, Mr. Wright? You could not win against the truth, could you?Phoenix:\n...

He accepted the bear figurine from the assassin. Reason number two. That very same figurine was found at Engarde Mansion. However! It's possible this is all the work of a certain other person!Judge:\nWhat are you saying...?Phoenix:\nWhat I am saying is, it's possible a different person is De Killer's real client!Judge:\nThe \"real\" client...?Phoenix:\nYes.Edgeworth:\nTsk, tsk. Is this all you have?Phoenix:\n...Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear your theory. Who do you say is De Killer's real client, and therefore, the real murderer?

Then the \"Nickel Samurai's arm\" that I saw...Phoenix:\nThat could have very well been Ms. Andrews!Judge:\nBut what about Mr. Engarde?Phoenix:\nIf you would please recall yesterday's testimony, the defendant was taking a nap during the break period.Judge:\nThat's right... Then... finding this figure at Mr. Engarde's mansion...?Phoenix:\nIt was a well-laid trap set by Ms. Andrews.Judge:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Powers:\n...Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth... What is your opinion on this?Edgeworth:\n... I can't even begin to count the flaws in the defense's logic. Besides which, there is no evidence to support it. However... I can't fully discount its possibility either.Judge:\nHmm......What is with this trial...?\n...Come on. Anyone can tell Engarde did it...\n...I can't believe the defense would go so far as to pin the guilt onto someone else...\n...Yeah! Unbelievable! It's not something petty; it's murder of all things...!Phoenix:\n(This is to save Maya... This is to save Maya...

All disruptive parties will be forced to leave the courtroom!Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. ... For the benefit of the defense, I'm willing to play along with his \"what if\" game.Judge:\nHis \"what if\" game, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution is prepared to challenge the defense's theory.Phoenix:\n...!Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright. Even you must have thought it strange and wondered, \"Why would the criminal want this little wooden bear...?\"Phoenix:\n(He's right... De Killer did specially bring that bear to Engarde right away...) Why do you ask? Is there something special about it?Edgeworth:\nAbsolutely. And I'm sure that once the court knows its significance, the true killer's identity will become crystal clear. Your Honor! The prosecution calls upon a witness who will clear all doubts against Ms. Andrews.Judge:\nAnd who would that be!?Edgeworth:\nIt's quite simple, Your Honor. Ms. Adrian Andrews herself.Judge:\nI see... Well then, the court will take a short 10 minute recess. The prosecution will prepare its witness in that time.Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor.March 23, 11:54 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Engarde:\nHahaha...

We still don't have any leads, but...Phoenix:\nWHAT!? We don't have any more time!Gumshoe:\nIf we just had one! Even a single clue would be really helpful...Phoenix:\n(I was only able to come this far because I kept thinking to myself... I've got to keep the trial going until Maya's been rescued... But have I just run out of luck this time...? Is all our hope for naught...?)A tent!Phoenix:\n(Huh? A tent!?)I could see a circus tent!Phoenix:\nM-Mia!Mia:\nIt looks like Maya was unconscious until just a few minutes ago. As soon as she woke up, she called for me.Phoenix:\nSo it was Maya that called you away!Mia:\nShe's locked in a dusty little room right now.

The Berry Big Circus!Phoenix:\nMaya is somewhere within a 300 feet radius of the main tent!Gumshoe:\nWh-What!? ... OK, hold on a sec, pal! Hey! Draw a circle on that map! About a 300 feet radius from the main tent! Hurry!Mia:\nAnd...Phoenix:\nAnd?Mia:\nI could see a mailbox under the window.Phoenix:\nGumshoe! There's also a mailbox!Gumshoe:\nHmm... OK! What else?Phoenix:\nWhat else, Mia!?Mia:\nI'm sorry, but it was a very small window. I couldn't see anything else... It felt like I was in an old office building... Maybe the third floor or so...Gumshoe:\nI heard her! An old office building. Good stuff, pal! OK, just hang in there! Just a little longer, pal!

I just have to make this trial last a little longer!)March 23, 12:05 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene.Edgeworth:\nDe Killer, the man who murdered the victim, handed this to his client. From this, one obvious question arises. \"Why this particular item?\" I believe the answer to that question will provide us with the name of the real culprit. (Changed from [I believe the answer to that question will provide us with the name of the real criminal.] in the original release) Now then, the prosecution calls the defendant's manager, Adrian Andrews, to the stand!Edgeworth:\nCurrently, the witness is accused of tampering and obstruction of justice.Andrews:\n...Edgeworth:\nHowever, you have been called to the witness stand today to ascertain... who exactly is guilty of murder.Andrews:\nI understand.Edgeworth:\nVery good. Now, have you ever seen this bear before, Ms. Andrews?Andrews:\nOf course I have.Judge:\nYou have seen it before?Edgeworth:\nThat's right. It's only natural that the witness has. Ms. Andrews.

It was a puzzle in the shape of a bear, so I thought it would be perfect for Juan.\nPhoenix:\n(So it was a present from Ms. Andrews...)\nEdgeworth:\nWitness, let's continue with your testimony.Andrews:\nBecause of its complexity, if you don't know the order, you can't open the bear.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo who exactly knew how to solve this puzzle?\nAndrews:\nOnly the two of us, Juan and myself. It was a souvenir from Switzerland... So I doubt there are that many people with this same bear in this country.\nJudge:\nBut this looks like it can be easily broken. Especially if someone wanted to get what was inside.\nAndrews:\nWell, it's a toy. But it can never be the same again once it's been broken.Andrews:\nYou really can't tell that it's a small \"jewelry box\" just by looking at it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho else knows that this bear is actually a small container or \"jewelry box\"?\nAndrews:\nI never told anyone. And as long as Juan never told anyone either, then only the two of us knew...\nPhoenix:\nThe two of you, huh... Then of course that means Mr. Engarde didn't know, right?\nAndrews:\n...Mia:\nWe don't know anything about this figurine. So we should try to find out more for now.Phoenix:\nYeah, I'll keep pressing her for more information.After pressing all statements:Phoenix:\n(I think this is about all I'm going to get for now...)Figurine updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nWell, Mr. Wright? I think even you have come to realize...Phoenix:\n...?Edgeworth:\nThat there is one very important fact we have uncovered, and that is this: This bear is actually a \"jewelry box\".Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nNow that we have agreed to this point, there is only one logical question that can come next. And that is this: What is inside this box?Judge:\nWhat's inside!?Edgeworth:\nThat's right. That's what we are going to find out next. Witness.Andrews:\nYes?Edgeworth:\nYou are the only one who can open this. Please...Phoenix:\n(There's a painful silence hanging over the courtroom... All eyes are on Ms. Andrews now as she solves the puzzle, and takes the bear apart...)...*click*...Andrews:\nI've opened it. Is this what you wanted?Judge:\nWh-What is that? It looks like a... note...Edgeworth:\nI don't think we need to guess at what that is... Do we, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n...Edgeworth:\nIt's the suicide note.Judge:\nThe suicide note?Edgeworth:\nThe suicide note left by Juan Corrida's former manager, Celeste Inpax. Until now, no one knew of its whereabouts... But just as we suspected, it was hidden. Hidden by the victim, Juan Corrida himself. It seems Celeste Inpax had very beautiful handwriting. And she just as beautifully signed her own name on this document. This is most definitely the note she left right before she committed suicide!Judge:\nO-ORDER! Witness! Did you know about this...?Andrews:\n...Yes, I did. I heard all about it from Juan. When I discovered his body... I looked for the bear. I wanted to destroy the note before it became public. But... I couldn't find it anywhere.Edgeworth:\nBecause it had already been taken by De Killer.Mia:\nEverything is going at Mr. Edgeworth's pace... So now that the suicide note has been found, what's the next logical question?Phoenix:\n\"What is written on the note...?\"Mia:\nThat's right... At least, that's what I would think...Edgeworth:\nNow then, I believe it is only appropriate the contents of this note be made known.Andrews:\nI can't stop you, can I...? I went through so much... just to get my hands on it. And I was going to burn it... for her sake.Edgeworth:\nI'm deeply sorry, but I can't allow you to persuade me to stop. Your Honor. If you could please read the contents of this note aloud.Judge:\nVery well...Phoenix:\nThe judge's voice rang loud and clear though the dead silent courtroom... In her note, Celeste Inpax left to us a record of all that had happened to her... About being used and then thrown away by Engarde... About being engaged to Corrida, and Engarde's role in destroying that... And about how she decided, in her despair, to end it all.Judge:\n... And that's all Ms. Inpax had to say.Edgeworth:\nThere is one thing I would like to say here. The prosecution has no interest in slandering Mr. Engarde.Judge:\nThen... What...?Edgeworth:\nOur intention, Your Honor, is to establish a motive for murder. Isn't that correct, witness?Andrews:\nYes... On the night of the murder, Juan was going to make the contents of the note public. After the post-ceremony show... he was going to hold a press conference.Judge:\nMy word...Edgeworth:\nMatt Engarde values, above all else, his \"refreshing like a spring breeze\" image. Which is why he had to stop this note from being made public... At any cost!Celeste's Suicide Note added to the Court Record....It's Engarde's fault that woman killed herself...\n...And this time, he even went so far as to kill someone to stop him from revealing that!\n...How terrible...! What a selfish person...!\nI guess there are slimeball lawyers out there who will defend these creeps too!Edgeworth:\nThere is no room for doubt here. (Changed from [There is no margin for doubt here.] in the original release) Mr. de Killer's client's goal was to obtain this suicide note. And the only person who needed this note that badly is the defendant. Let's not forget that the bear with the note inside was found at the defendant's house!Judge:\nIt seems that we have come to the truth at last. The defendant's motives were entirely selfish. He deserves no sympathy from anyone!Phoenix:\nUrk... (How am I supposed to escape from this one!?)Mia:\nWhy the hesitation, Phoenix? Gumshoe hasn't called yet, so you know what you must do.Phoenix:\n(I know. I have to carry on and buy him some more time! OK. There are 2 deadly pieces of evidence: the figurine and the suicide note. Maybe somehow, I can find a way out of this situation through one of those!)Mia:\nThe gavel is already in the judge's hand! Phoenix! Hurry!Phoenix:\n(The suicide note or the figurine!? Which one of these should I pursue??)Celeste's Suicide Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease wait, Your Honor!\n...Oh man, look at that lawyer...\n...He's still going at it...?\n...It's like he doesn't care that he's trying to get a killer off the hook!\nPhoenix:\nI think Your Honor believes that Matt Engarde killed in order to obtain this note.\nJudge:\nYes, that is correct.\nPhoenix:\nBut that seems a little strange. In fact, I think there is a contradiction here!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThis note was hidden by Mr. Corrida until the night of the murder. If that is the case... I say that Matt Engarde could not have known what was written on this note!\nJudge:\nOh! I didn't think of it that way...\nPhoenix:\nExactly. But I did think of it that way, and I thought it was rather strange. No one in their right mind would kill for a note without first knowing what it said!\nLeads to:\n\"Order! Order! Order!\"The Figurine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease wait, Your Honor!\n...Oh man, look at that lawyer...\n...He's still going at it...?\n...It's like he doesn't care that he's trying to get a killer off the hook!\nPhoenix:\nThe assassin took this with him from the crime scene after murdering Mr. Corrida. At the request of his client, of course.\nJudge:\nSo, what's your point, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI don't think it's possible that Mr. de Killer's client was Matt Engarde. In fact, I think there is a contradiction here!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYou can't tell by just looking at it that this bear is really a jewelry box. The chances that Matt Engarde thought the note was inside this bear... Are zero to none!\nJudge:\nOh! I didn't think of it that way...\nPhoenix:\nExactly. But I did think of it that way, and I thought it was rather strange. After all, there is no reason why Mr. Engarde would ever want a jewelry box like this!\nLeads to:\n\"Order! Order! Order!\"Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Y-You make a valid point, Mr. Wright! Mr. Edgeworth! What is your opinion!?Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(It was just a flash, but I think I did rather well on this one...)Mia:\nUnfortunately... I think he believes differently.Edgeworth:\nI believe a show of appreciation is in order.Judge:\nH-Huh?Edgeworth:\nThe defense seems to be in love with wishing more despair upon itself.Phoenix:\n...!Edgeworth:\nI would like to direct the court's attention to this.Judge:\nWhat is that...?Edgeworth:\nIt is a very small video camera, Your Honor. This type of camera is commonly used as a means of spying.Judge:\nS-Spying...?Phoenix:\n(What the...!? I thought that spy camera was in my possession...)Edgeworth:\nMatt Engarde and the victim both thought of the other as their biggest rival. They even went so far as to use this type of item to find each other's weaknesses!Judge:\nAnd...?Edgeworth:\nThe victim, Juan Corrida, was being spied on! His personal life was being watched by none other than Matt Engarde!Judge:\nOrder! Oooooorder!! Ahem! Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou... Don't tell me you knew about your client's spying activities!?Phoenix:\nWell... sort of...Judge:\n\"Sort of\" is not an acceptable answer, Mr. Wright!Edgeworth:\nI see you are confused, Mr. Wright. You're probably thinking, \"But I have the camera that was in the stuffed bear's eye...\"Phoenix:\n...!Edgeworth:\nBut this camera that I have is not that same one. Last night, I searched the victim's house on a hunch... Using this...Phoenix:\n(Gumshoe's bug sweeper...)Edgeworth:\nBy the way, Mr. Wright. The defendant's fingerprints were found on this camera.Judge:\nMatt Engarde's fingerprints were on there!?Mia:\nWell, Phoenix... It looks like those cameras were hidden all over the place, huh?Phoenix:\n(What am I supposed to say to that evidence...?)Edgeworth:\nI think this is the end. It's fairly obvious that Mr. Engarde learned of the suicide note through this. He was watching the victim all along.Phoenix:\n(He got me good this time! I don't have anything to counter that!)...Hey, hey... Now what's that lawyer thinking...?\n...Mommy? Is that man the bad killer guy?\n...Shush! Stop! Don't look at him!\n...The way he's sweating is just so... Eww... Nasty...Mia:\nPhoenix...Phoenix:\nYes, Chief!?Mia:\nHave you figured out what you're going to do next yet?Phoenix:\nWhat I'm going to do next!? (Does running away like a frightened child work?)Mia:\nI know it seems like Mr. Edgeworth is very close to putting the lid on this case. But... In his eagerness to prove his point, he forgot one very important thing.Phoenix:\nWell, what is it, Mia!?Mia:\nThere is a piece of evidence that he really should investigate.Phoenix:\n(Something he should investigate?)Mia:\nI would really hate to see the good prosecutor get scolded... For not remembering to look into the item when he had the chance.Phoenix:\n(Why are you speaking in riddles all of a sudden...?)Judge:\nAlright, I think this time we finally understand everything. Well, Mr. Wright? You don't have any further objections, do you?Phoenix:\n(What is this piece of evidence that Mia is talking about...? Can I figure out what it is that still needs to be looked at, or should I let it go...?)Present evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"...I have an objection, Your Honor.\"No objections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I have no objections to Engarde getting his guilty sentence as he should... But I can't let that happen yet! Mia said there's still something worth examining. If she thinks so, then even if I have to force it, I must find something to bring up!)\nLeads to:\n\"...I have an objection, Your Honor.\"Phoenix:\n...I have an objection, Your Honor.Edgeworth:\nHmph. That was about the weakest objection I've ever heard, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYour Honor! The defense has no intentions of letting this go so easily!Judge:\nYou are beginning to sound desperate...Phoenix:\nThat's just your imagination, Your Honor! Mr. Edgeworth. This is not like you at all.Edgeworth:\n...?Phoenix:\nIn your eagerness to prove your point, you've forgotten one very important thing.Mia:\nHey... Isn't that what I just said!?Edgeworth:\nSo, you're telling me that I forgot something?Phoenix:\nYou're so close, Mr. Edgeworth... But there's something you really should examine about this piece of evidence!Present Celeste's Suicide Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"That is... Ms. Inpax's suicide note, right?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I do believe some special examination is needed... But I think the item that should be examined is the defense's grey matter.\nPhoenix:\nWhoops!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. After this trial is over, I would like to see you in my chambers. I think there are a few things we need to discuss.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. If you're going to speak, at least use your brain to make up something intelligible.\nLeads back to:\n\"So, you're telling me that I forgot something?\"Judge:\nThat is... Ms. Inpax's suicide note, right?Phoenix:\nHmm... Who knows?Edgeworth:\n...!Phoenix:\nI mean, sure, this \"suicide note\" was found inside this bear. But this bear was in my possession until a few moments ago. Which means... The handwriting on this \"suicide note\" has yet to be analyzed!Judge:\nOh...Phoenix:\nSo! As to whether this pivotal piece of evidence was really written by Ms. Inpax or not... That has yet to be even remotely confirmed! (Changed from [Has yet to be even remotely confirmed!] in the original release)Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright! You can't seriously be suggesting...Andrews:\nMr. Wright! You... Are you saying this suicide note is a fake!?Phoenix:\nMs. Andrews... You were the one who tried to pin this murder on Mr. Engarde. Who's to say you didn't create a fake \"suicide note\" and put it into this bear!?Andrews:\nH-How dare you!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. The defense is indiscriminately accusing the witness again! There is no evidence linking the witness to the suicide note whatsoever!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut if this is a fake, then the witness is the only person who could have made it!Edgeworth:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nRecall the witness's testimony concerning this figurine! The only person other than the victim who could solve the puzzle is the witness herself!Andrews:\nAhh!Phoenix:\nMs. Andrews! You wrote this note, didn't you? You wrote it so you could use it to frame Matt Engarde!Andrews:\nI... I did no such thing!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWright! If you're going to pronounce this suicide note a fake... Then show this court some evidence to support your theory!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth! You were the one who presented this scrap of paper as evidence! That means the burden of proof lies with you, the prosecution!Edgeworth:\nUuugn!Judge:\nThat's enough! Mr. Edgeworth. Can you confirm the handwriting on this suicide note...?Edgeworth:\nIt is as the defense has stated! The handwriting has yet to be analyzed!Judge:\nIf that's the case... It seems that yet again we have reached a point where a verdict is impossible.Edgeworth:\nImposs... That's impossible!Mia:\nThis isn't good, Phoenix.Phoenix:\n(The judge is going to carry this trial over one more day. I don't think Maya will physically be able to make it another day!)Judge:\nI didn't want to have to do this, but I don't have a choice. I request that both the prosecution and defense further investigate......Handwriting analysis my butt! That's just the lawyer trying to buy more time!\n...Engarde is guilty! Look, any idiot can tell you that!Mia:\nI think we've reached the end of the line......Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!...Phone:\n...Judge:\nWh-What is that sound!?Phoenix:\n(It's Gumshoe!)Phone:...*beep*...Phoenix:\nHello!? Gumshoe!?Gumshoe:\n... *sigh*...Phoenix:\n(What is with him!? And what's with that sigh!?) Where's Maya!? What happened to De Killer!?Gumshoe:\nHe, uh... He got away...Phoenix:\nWHAT!?Gumshoe:\nI'm sorry, pal! I really am! I don't know what to say besides I'm sorry. I wish there was some way to make it up to you! I really do!Phoenix:\nA-Anyway, what's going on!?Gumshoe:\nWe found his hideout, pal. But... the two of them were already gone...Mia:\n...This is terrible...Gumshoe:\nI'm going to keep looking for them, pal. Don't you worry! I just need a little more time!Phoenix:\nBut...Gumshoe:\nDon't tell me we don't... we don't have any more......Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!... ...Guilty! Guilty!

Oh!Phoenix:\nWh-What is it!?Gumshoe:\nLet me talk to Mr. Edgeworth!Phoenix:\nI-I can't do that!Judge:\nMr. Wright! Would you please get a hold of yourself!?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.Judge:\nI am about to end today's proceedings. You may take your phone calls after...Phoenix:\nHold on, Your Honor! Edgeworth! Catch!Phoenix:Gumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\n...Gumshoe:\nPlease! You've got to buy us some more time!Edgeworth:\n... Court is in session. ...*beep*...Phoenix:\n...!Edgeworth:\nI'm sorry, Your Honor. You were saying?Judge:\nMr. Wright! This is a court of law!Phoenix:\nI'm sorry, Your Honor! But...!Judge:\nI am reluctant to do this, however... It appears that I have no choice but to suspend proceedings until tomorrow!Phoenix:\n(I... This time, I really can't do anything...)Judge:\nCourt is now adjourned for the day!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nPlease wait, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(E-Edgeworth!?)Judge:\nWh-What is it, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI humbly request another 30 minutes of Your Honor's time.Judge:\nFor what purpose?Edgeworth:\nWe can perform the necessary tests on this piece of evidence in that time!Judge:\nHmm... But can you really obtain your results in 30 minutes?Edgeworth:\nI believe we can, Your Honor.Judge:\nBut wouldn't it be better if we adjourned for today and then reconvened tomorrow...?Edgeworth:\nThirty minutes. Please, Your Honor. That's all I am asking for.Phoenix:\nPlease! Your Honor!Judge:\n... Very well.Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nAt the prosecution's request, this court will now take a 30 minute recess. But be advised that I will not allow another recess today.Phoenix:\n(I'm not sure if this is helping... or hurting us...)Judge:\nThe court will now take its final recess of the day!March 23, 2:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Edgeworth:\nWright!

I thought you'd ask, pal!Phoenix:\n...?Gumshoe:\nI've got the things he left with me right now and I'm on my way over!Phoenix:\nReally!?Edgeworth:\nThat's odd. Any items like that are usually sent to the crime lab first...Gumshoe:\nWe don't have time to wait for those guys, sir! When those guys weren't looking, I swiped the stuff and ran!Edgeworth:\nWhat!?Gumshoe:\nWell... I'm not a detective anymore, so I had to... I'm really sorry, sir, but I've got to put the law on hold for now!Phoenix:\n(Sounds bad... I hope he doesn't get in too much trouble over this...)Gumshoe:\nWith my hunk of junk car, I'd say I'll be there in about 20 minutes, sir! Don't worry! I'll be there!

I'm guessing his cell phone broke as well.Phoenix:\nWh-What was he thinking?? We've got to hurry and call for help!Edgeworth:\nBut we have no idea where he is. His cell phone is broken, and he wasn't driving a patrol car, so no radio either. Also... If we don't get to those items before they do, the police will take possessions of them.Phoenix:\nNo! We can't let that happen!Edgeworth:\nWell, if there is a way we can find out where he is, then we stand a chance...Phoenix:\n(Why, oh why did Gumshoe have to get into an accident now!? Is there any way to find out exactly where he is at this moment...!?)There is a way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's right! There is a way!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?

I assume both sides are ready?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...Edgeworth:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...Judge:\n...I can understand the defense acting like this, however, why do you also seem distraught, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nI... that is... It's nothing, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(What's wrong with Edgeworth...?)Mia:\nIt looks like something unexpected just happened to him.Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Edgeworth. If you could please tell the court the results of the handwriting analysis on Ms. Inpax's suicide note...Edgeworth:\nY...Yes, Your Honor. Unfortunately... We have discovered that this suicide note is a forgery.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Judge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:\nThis... This note was not written by Ms. Inpax herself! It is a fake!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! Would you care to explain what is going on!? If this was not written by Ms. Inpax, then who wrote it!?Edgeworth:\nWe would need more time to do a more detailed analysis, however... It appears that the handwriting matches that of the victim, Mr. Juan Corrida.Phoenix:\nMr. C-Corrida...?Mia:\nWell, well... It looks like Ms. Inpax never left a suicide note after all. She never wrote anything about Engarde...Edgeworth:\nHowever! Your Honor. Even though this suicide note is indeed a fake, Mr. Engarde could not have known that, and so that [sic] facts remain unchanged! Acting under the assumption that it was real, he had plotted to possess it!Judge:\nHmm... That does sound very plausible.Phoenix:\n(This theory that Engarde had no idea that the suicide note was fake... Something seems a little wrong with it...)Present evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defense believes that the theory the prosecution has stated contradicts testimony! If everything the prosecution has proven up to this point is true... Then it's impossible for Mr. Engarde to not have know it was a fake!\n\n\n\nPresent Spy Camera, Transmitter, or Stuffed Bear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWhat is this little item called again...?\nPhoenix:\nUm, a video camera, Your Honor. Well, a very small one, but...\nJudge:\nOh, that's right. A camera. Ah, you kids and your fancy toys nowadays...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth! Earlier, you claimed that Mr. Engarde knew of the existence of this note because he was spying on the victim. Isn't that right?\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nIf that were true... Then this means Mr. Engarde would have known that the victim had forged the note!\nEdgeworth:\nAaack!\nLeads to:\n\"So then, the defendant knew this suicide note was a fake.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth?? Your response?\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that even more important than finding out if this note is real or not, is whether the attorney's badge pinned to that man's chest is real... That is the million dollar question!\nJudge:\nYes, I agree.\nMia:\nMe too.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm going to take a wild guess and say that I messed up again...?)\nJudge:\nHmm...

(If only I had kept my mouth shut...)\nLeads to:\n\"So then, the defendant knew this suicide note was a fake.\"Judge:\nSo then, the defendant knew this suicide note was a fake. And if that's true, then the situation has suddenly changed in a very dramatic way.Phoenix:\nExactly, Your Honor! The prosecution's theory as to what Mr. Engarde's motive for murder was... It has suddenly disappeared into thin air!Edgeworth:\nBut Your Honor! It's not as if Mr. Engarde monitored Mr. Corrida 24 hours a day! Perhaps the victim wrote the note in a place Mr. Engarde didn't know of!Phoenix:\nWell, right back at you, Mr. Edgeworth! Why don't you show us some proof that the victim made the forgery at an unknown place!?Edgeworth:\nGnnngh!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! ...Mr. Edgeworth. It looks like this time, it is you who has dug his own grave.Edgeworth:\nUnnnngh... As I figured...Judge:\nHuh? ...As you figured...?Edgeworth:\nAs I figured... It came down to this after all...Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth, you are not making any sense...Edgeworth:\nWhen I heard the results of the handwriting analysis, I thought this might happen. The question is... \"What next?\"Phoenix:\nWhat next...??Edgeworth:\nIf the prosecution can't prove Mr. Engarde's motive through the evidence, then we must prove it from another angle.Judge:\nWell, I agree with you there...Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution... would like to call a witness to the stand at this time...Judge:\nOh. Well, that's fine.Edgeworth:\nHowever... this witness... This witness is a little... unusual...Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth stuttering...? This is not like him at all.)Judge:\nUnusual? Well, what sort of witness is this person, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nThis witness is one who is perfectly fit to answer once and for all the question of, \"Who was it that hired Shelly de Killer to commit murder?\"Phoenix:\nThat's impossible!! Who in the...!? No such person exists who can answer that question with such certainty!Judge:\nY-Yes! Mr. Edgeworth! Who is this witness!?Edgeworth:\nIt is... It's... um...Judge:\nYes!? Go on! Who is it!?Edgeworth:\nThe man himself... Mr. Shelly de Killer.Judge:\nOh, Mr. de Killer. ... W-W-Waaaaait!! Shelly de Killer!? Um, you mean... The killer? Err... I mean the assassin?Edgeworth:\nYes... Your Honor.Judge:\nHe's coming here? To the witness stand...?Edgeworth:\nWell, yes, in a manner of speaking... I recognize that this is a very unusual circumstance, so I ask for your permission.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Judge:\nIs this alright with you?Phoenix:\n(Do I have a choice here...? I can't really do much else to drag this trial out...) The defense has no objections, Your Honor.Judge:\nI wonder if it really is alright to do this...?Edgeworth:\nVery well then. The prosecution calls our witness to the stand!Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth... Is there no other way left to us...?)Edgeworth:\nNow then, witness. ...Um, your name... and your, uh... occupation, please.de Killer:\nVery good, sir. My name is Shelly de Killer, and I am a professional assassin.Judge:\nI... I say!! Wh-What is going on here!?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor?Judge:\nHow can you remain so calm? And what is the meaning of this two-way radio...?Edgeworth:\nActually, Your Honor, it was delivered to me just now... And it came with a condition. As long as we do not trace its source, Mr. de Killer will testify to this court.Phoenix:\n(So this must be what that urgent phone call he got earlier was about...)Judge:\nOh no, this will not do. I cannot allow this in my court. First of all, we can't even be sure this is really Mr. de Killer himself!Edgeworth:\nWitness. Please present some sort of proof that you are in fact Shelly de Killer.de Killer:\nI understand. Please wait a second.Judge:\n...????:\n...Maya:\n... I'm... sooo... hungry...Phoenix:\nM-M-Maya!Mia:\nMaya!Judge:\nA... A voice! Mr. Wright! Can you confirm anything from this!?Phoenix:\nThe defense has no objections to this person! We are satisfied that this man is indeed Shelly de Killer!Judge:\nIt looks like we have run into yet another unexpected turn of events... Well, it doesn't seem like we have too many choices under these circumstances, so...Edgeworth:\n...Now then, witness. There is one thing I would like to confirm before we speak of anything else.de Killer:\nAnd what would that be?Edgeworth:\nAt the request of a client, you killed Mr. Juan Corrida. Is this correct?de Killer:\n... It is as you say. I did indeed kill Mr. Corrida.Judge:\n*gulp*Edgeworth:\nNow that we have answered that, let's move on to the name of your client!de Killer:\n...Very well.Judge:\nThis is all just a bad dream... Yes, that's it, a bad dream...Phoenix:\n(Shelly de Killer... What is he going to say...?)Witness Testimony-- About My Client --de Killer:\nThere is something I must first state.\nTo an assassin, nothing is more important than the trust between a client and himself.\nAnd that is the reason I am here today on this witness stand.\nIt is my wish that you grasp this concept before I give the name of my client.Judge:\nHmm, Mr. de Killer seems to be a very clever man. I'd almost say he seems to be mocking us.Edgeworth:\nWhile he may appear to be our enemy, Your Honor, Mr. de Killer is only stating the truth. He is no hypocrite. He has always stood by this one belief.Judge:\nYou mean about this \"trust between his clients and himself\" thing? Hmm, it seems to be a level of trust beyond what people like me can comprehend. ...Well, Mr. Wright? Are you ready to cross-examine the witness?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Mia:\nThere's no way to know what's coming next, so stay cool and collected, Phoenix.Cross Examination",

All of a sudden, it feels like we can actually win this.Phoenix:\nYeah...Judge:\nThe prosecution has failed to provide a motive and has instead, provided this suicide note, which is a forgery created by the victim. Furthermore, there is a possibility the defendant himself knew it was a fake. But most definitive of all, we have heard from the assassin himself; the name of his client. Mr. de Killer's client who requested the murder was not the defendant at all!Edgeworth:\n...No...Judge:\nWith all this evidence, it is obvious to me that this means that Mr. Matt Engarde... Is innocent!de Killer:\nI seem to have caused you all a bit of confusion. Please, continue your discussion, and call me when you have reached a verdict....*beep*...Judge:\nBailiff! Please bring Ms. Adrian Andrews in immediately!Mia:\nWhat now? With the way this is going, Engarde will be found innocent. This may be our last chance... to save Maya...Phoenix:\nYeah... But... But Edgeworth is right. De Killer is lying! And Engarde... my client... I know he's guilty! (Can I live with myself if I win this!?)Judge:\nWho would've believed that the prosecution's own witness would absolve the defendant!?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor! The prosecution requests permission to further question the witness! Shelly de Killer is certainly lying under oath!Judge:\nHmm...Andrews:\nIt wasn't me! Listen! Everyone! Please! That testimony just now... It was all one big lie!Phoenix:\nMs. Andrews...Andrews:\nThe suicide note may have been a fake. But! That man... Matt... He's the reason Celeste died! And Juan's death... It was all because he got pulled into Matt's twisted world! That testimony just now... You have to believe me... It was a horrible, horrible lie...Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nBut... Mr. de Killer himself has testified... He has named you as his client.Andrews:\nNo! That's not true!Judge:\nAlso, there is quite a bit of evidence that points to you. The knife and button, donning the Nickel Samurai costume... (Changed from [The knife and button, donning the Nickel Samurai's costume...] in the original release)Andrews:\nBut that's... That's...Judge:\nYou even have a motive. We know that Ms. Celeste Inpax was a large part of your life. You wanted to follow her... And you wanted revenge against the two who hurt her. I would say you have plenty of reasons to want them both dead.Andrews:\nI... No... Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\n...!Andrews:\nYou... You know the truth! Tell them! Tell them the real story... Who the real killer is... Tell them! Please... Help me...Phoenix:\n(Yes, I know the truth...)Judge:\nMr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nI believe we have reached the end of this trial. Therefore, I ask the defense for any final words or opinions.Phoenix:\n... (I have to decide... Do I take the not guilty verdict and save Maya... Or do I throw this chance away and wait for Gumshoe's new evidence...? What am I supposed to do!?)Request the verdict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! The defense will make a request... ... ...

I can't let someone else take the fall. If I let Ms. Andrews be convicted, then I am no better than Engarde. And even though I don't want to admit it, I have to face the fact that it is because of Edgeworth that I now know the real truth. He could've gotten Engarde convicted so many times over, but he never took a single one of those chances. If I take this verdict right now... I'd be betraying his trust. (...His trust...?

Actually, how would you like a new life, Mr. Attorney...?\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me? Ah, no no no! I'm fine! Really!\nJudge:\n... Are you really now...?\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what kind of man the judge thinks I am now...)Mia:\nWhat are you going to do now, Phoenix?Phoenix:\nAll I can do now is expose the lies.Mia:\nThat's true... However, you realize that will be very bad for our client, right?Phoenix:\n(Nnngh... I'm so confused... But the one thing I know for sure is I can't let this trial end yet!)Phoenix:\nThank you so much for taking the time to testify, Mr. de Killer.de Killer:\nWhat is the meaning of that attitude?Phoenix:\nWhen Adrian Andrews entered the victim's room, your \"client\" had no idea that Juan Corrida had been murdered!Judge:\nBut how... How do you know that!?Phoenix:\nFrom this wine glass, Your Honor.Judge:\nThe glass...Phoenix:\nMr. de Killer's supposed client thought Mr. Corrida had only fainted. Which is why this glass of tomato juice was poured for the victim!Judge:\nHmm... But isn't that just a part of Adrian Andrews' calculated plan?Phoenix:\nThat is not possible, Your Honor. This glass bears the fingerprints of that person. Had this been planned, they would never have left their fingerprints behind!Judge:\nI see your point... Mr. Edgeworth!? What is your opinion?Edgeworth:\nStrangely enough... I had the same exact thought just now. Witness! How do you explain this strange phenomenon!?de Killer:\nI-Isn't it a waste of time to ask about such a minor detail? It's not a very important point anyway, correct...?Edgeworth:\nI'm afraid you are mistaken. If Adrian Andrews really is your client, as you claim... Then your client should have had knowledge of Mr. Corrida's death. If not... Then that can only mean that Adrian Andrews was never your client at all!de Killer:\n... How strange...Judge:\nYes?de Killer:\nWhy is it that the attorney has yet to raise an objection at this absurd situation...?Phoenix:\n...!Mia:\nPhoenix. If De Killer figures out what we're up to, we're in real trouble!Phoenix:\nYeah, I know...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth! I'm surprised! You know you can't say things like that without any evidence.Edgeworth:\nAh... Sorry.Judge:\n... Th-That sounded like an awfully weak \"Objection!\" to me...Edgeworth:\nAnyway! I am positive there was a contradiction in that testimony. The prosecution requests further testimony concerning when the request was taken!de Killer:\n... Very well.Phoenix:\n(Right now, I have to buy us more time... While we wait for the items De Killer left behind to get here. I just know that the very outcome of this trial lies with those items!)Witness Testimony-- Request Taking --de Killer:\nThis request came to me... oh, about a week ago.\nIt was a request for my services on the night of the awards ceremony.\nWe met at a certain bar to discuss and finalize a few matters.\nThat is what occurred. I trust my memory, and I believe I have made no mistakes.Judge:\nHmm... So you physically met your client, huh?de Killer:\nThat is correct.

When you request my services, Mr. Attorney, I hope you will keep that in mind.\nPhoenix:\nPlease... stop...\nde Killer:\nIn any case, my client this time had a very specific date and time in mind.\nPhoenix:\n(A specific date and time...?)de Killer:\nIt was a request for my services on the night of the awards ceremony.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you ask why on that specific night?\nde Killer:\nNo. I try to fulfill all the conditions of my clients' request.

Why did your client request that night...?\nde Killer:\nI'm sure it was all for the bear.\nPhoenix:\nThe bear...?\nde Killer:\nMy client spoke of it. \"I'm sure there will be a bear-shaped figurine in Juan Corrida's room. I would like you to retrieve that item for me.\"\nPhoenix:\n(He must be talking about this bear puzzle...)\nEdgeworth:\nInside that figurine was a suicide note. Naturally, the victim brought it with him to his hotel room. He was planning to publicly disclose its contents at the press conference, after all.\nde Killer:\nThat is correct. And if I had not done the job that night, I would not have known where that bear figurine was...\nPhoenix:\n(I see...)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Was the testimony just now of any importance?\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe testimony just now has made one thing clear. And that is...

I would like for you to give us a few more details.\nde Killer:\nI always meet my clients as a matter of principle.

Was the testimony just now of any importance?\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course, it was very important, Your Honor.

I did. It was only through talking with him face to face that I began to trust him. That's when I thought, \"I can trust this person as a client.\"\nJudge:\nHmm... It's true what they say about talking face to face. Well, Mr. Wright?

I suppose you are correct.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nSo I would like to check one last time. Are you sure your testimony is accurate?Present Adrian Andrews profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to go over this one more time.\"de Killer:\nThat is what occurred. I trust my memory, and I believe I have made no mistakes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo your client was Adrian Andrews...?\nde Killer:\nThat is correct.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, he says the two of them met... But if they did, then there shouldn't be anything wrong with De Killer's testimony...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Well, there doesn't seem to be anything strange this time around...)Mia:\nYou have to draw more information from him, but you can't draw his suspicion. If you can do that, you should be able to find a flaw in his testimony somewhere.Phoenix:\n(Talk about a delicate balance...)Phoenix:\nI would like to go over this one more time. You met Adrian Andrews at a bar and took the request at that time?de Killer:\nYes, that is correct.Phoenix:\nAnd that's when you thought \"he\" was trustworthy...de Killer:\nHow many times must I repeat myself? Yes, that is correct.Phoenix:\nI'm sorry, but that is an impossible tale.de Killer:\nWh-What!?Phoenix:\nShelly de Killer. You have never met the real Adrian Andrews!de Killer:\n...! Wh-Why would you say that...?Phoenix:\nBecause you made one very big slip-up... ...about her.de Killer:\nSo what is the issue... ...! Wh-What did you say just now...? About \"her\"...?Phoenix:\nIf you had ever met Adrian Andrews in person... One look would have told you that she is a woman!de Killer:\nOhoooooo!Judge:\nO-Order! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?Phoenix:\nThis witness testified to the following: That he always meets face to face with his clients when taking their request.Judge:\nBut he has never met Adrian Andrews in person...Edgeworth:\nYes, Your Honor! That is exactly the point! That means Mr. de Killer's client could not have been Ms. Adrian Andrews!de Killer:\nUgnnn...Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth... I understand your logic on this one... However... Why would the assassin make such a basic mistake?Edgeworth:\nI believe it has to do with her name, Your Honor.Judge:\nHer name?Edgeworth:\nYes. Adrian Andrews is, without a doubt, a very androgynous name.Judge:\nHmm... Yes, I see...Edgeworth:\nUnluckily for Mr. de Killer, the entire time he was on the stand, no one had stated Adrian Andrews' gender. And so, he simply picked the wrong gender to go with.Judge:\nWh-What... What is going on...? Shelly de Killer! This court demands an explanation!de Killer:\nUmm... I-I think somehow... I must have mixed up this client with another.Edgeworth:\nSo does that mean you remember something different now?de Killer:\nYes, of course. Please, if you would allow me to testify once more...Phoenix:\n(Argh! I know he's just going to spit out more lies.)Judge:\nVery well. But this time, please give us the truth, and nothing but the truth!Witness Testimony-- Request Taking, Pt. 2 --de Killer:\nYes, now I remember. I took that request by mail.\nThere have been times when I took a job without having met my client.\nThe request was for the murder of Juan Corrida and 2 or 3 other small things.\nWhen I saw the name at the end of the letter, I thought my client to be a man.Judge:\nHmm... So you took this job through a letter...Phoenix:\n(He didn't mention anything about a letter in his earlier testimony... Which means he is definitely lying!)Mia:\nBe careful, Phoenix. If you break the assassin's testimony completely, it's over for us.Phoenix:\nI know... I can't make him suspicious. But... I think we're OK -- like we can do this. (As long as he's standing there across from me... No matter how strong of a punch I throw, he'll counter it...)Judge:\nNow then, let's begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination",

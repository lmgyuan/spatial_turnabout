Although, I was doing something else entirely for a while there. As for why I decided to formally get back into lawyering... ...let's just say there's unfinished business to take care of. Anyway, I thought I'd reminisce about my first case back on the job. And what a case it was! It happened only a few months after Athena joined our office...Special EpisodeTurnabout ReclaimedAnime cutsceneFemale pirate:Cap'n Orla! Ye made it just in time!\u266a Oh, we be pirates, we love to sail the seven seas. \u266a\u266a Just a bunch o' scallywags who are as free as free can be. \u266a\u266a We swim through storms and waves, all because, you see \u266a\u266a Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me! \u266aJuly 20, 12:37 PMWright Anything Agency (Changed from [July 20, 12:37 AM [sic] Wright Anything Agency] in the original release)Phoenix:(Today is my first day back on the job as a lawyer. Putting this attorney's badge on again really makes it hit home. Boy am I pumped! Even Trucy said, \"Looking good, Daddy!\") So Athena, Apollo, what do you think of the ol' attorney's badge?Athena:Wow! This Shipshape Aquarium's show is great! I can't get enough of it!Phoenix:Um... Athena?Athena:I still can't believe they showed the Swashbuckler Spectacular on TV! Good thing I recorded this! ...Now, who's ready for another viewing!Apollo:You've already watched it five times! Let's watch something else now!Athena:How can you even suggest such a thing?! This show is therapeutic!Phoenix:(Uh, boss here, asking you guys a question...)Apollo:What's so \"therapeutic\" about watching a killer whale?Athena:What?! Don't you know anything?! Animal-assisted therapy is an established psychiatric treatment!Apollo:You're kidding. That kind of thing really exists?Athena:It's a real thing! I've been to the aquarium myself to try it, and it really helps. I still go to there every now and then to further my psychology studies. The last time I went, I saw a dolphin and an orca swimming around together! It was so--Phoenix:Hey, do you two think you could quit goofing off and do some work for a change?Apollo:Work? But we've already cleaned the toilet... Twice. Each. ...Hey, wait a minute. Is that your badge I see?Athena:Wow! Congrats on getting your attorney's badge back, Boss!Phoenix:Thanks. Starting today, I'm officially a lawyer again! (Sheesh. Took 'em long enough to notice...)Apollo:Gee, Mr. Wright... With that badge on, you suddenly look so... capable!Phoenix:Ha ha ha. Um, thanks? (It's not like I was some lazy bum, you know!)Apollo:But what made you suddenly so fired up to get your badge back, anyway?Phoenix:Ah, well... I made a promise to a certain someone... An important promise.Apollo:What could be so important...?Phoenix:Anyway, we have three lawyers now, so we'd better start taking on lots of work!Athena:I'm all for that! Let's get this agency hoppin'!Phoenix:(Well, we have plenty of enthusiasm. All we need now are some clients... It's been eight years since I last wore this badge. I feel like a rookie all over again.)TV:...And this just in... The owner of Shipshape Aquarium, \"Captain\" Jack Shipley... ...has been murdered. The suspect in the case is reportedly already in custody inside the aquarium.Apollo:Isn't that the aquarium we were just watching, Athena?!Athena:It is! ...I can't believe it! A murder at Shipshape Aquarium...?! But I love that place! We need to get to the bottom of this!???:R-Really? I guess I'm in luck, then! I need Phoenix Wright to save my friend!Phoenix:(Wh-Who in the world is this?!) Um... are you a client...?Athena:Wait... That costume... It looks just like... I've got it! You must work at Shipshape Aquarium!Buckler:That's right! You min-now it! I'm Sasha Buckler! I perform like an agile catfish in our pirate show! It'll blowfish your mind!Phoenix:(\"Minnow\"? \"Blowfish\"? Those puns floundered a bit...)Athena:Hee hee! I figured out the client's identity! Chalk one up for analytical psychology!Buckler:My friend is under suspicion of murder, so I really need some help. That's why I've gotta find this \"Phoenix Wright\" guy...Phoenix:Well, I'm Phoenix Wright... And this is Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes. They're lawyers, too.Apollo:If there's anything you need, all you have to do is ask!Athena:The same goes for me too, Ms. Buckler!Buckler:Ha ha! Just call me \"Sasha.\" And I'll call you all by your first names, too, if that's all right. Phoenix, Apollo, Athena, you have to help me! Please save my friend!Phoenix:(Guess we'd better start by asking her more about her defense request.)TalkYour defense requestPhoenix:Ms. Buckler-- Sasha, could you tell us more about why you need our help?Buckler:My friend is suspected of murdering the captain of Shipshape Aquarium.Phoenix:\"Captain\"? I thought the victim was the owner of the aquarium?Buckler:Yeah, well, our aquarium has a pirate ship theme. That's why we call the owner our \"captain.\" We call the employees \"crew,\" too.Phoenix:That's a pretty unusual aquarium you've got there.Buckler:Anyway, one of the crew members, my friend, is being suspected of the captain's murder. They've already decided she's guilty. I think they're going to give her the death penalty!Phoenix:Wh-What?! (What happened to \"due process\"!?)Buckler:But my friend is as sweet and gentle as a whale shark! She wouldn't hurt a guppy! I know there's no way she murdered anyone, but they won't believe me! But with a name like \"Wright,\" I figured you'd be able to help me set them straight!Apollo:Wait a minute... Don't tell me she picked you all because of a bad pun...Phoenix:Ouch. I see my reputation doesn't precede me... (But seriously. My name can't be the real reason she's here...)Why request me? (appears after \"Your defense request\")Leads to:\"What's the real reason you picked me, Sasha?\"PresentAnythingBuckler:Sorry. Sea creatures are the only things I know anything about...Phoenix:That's all right. Don't worry about it. (Gee, I didn't mean to put her in a funk.)Phoenix:What's the real reason you picked me, Sasha?Buckler:...Well, to be honest, I asked a whole slew of lawyers, but they all refused. They said stuff like, \"There's no merit to taking your case,\" or \"I'm not sure I can help.\" They're all as cruel as sharks, with hearts punier than whitebait!Athena:Ooh! I can really feel Sasha's frustration!Phoenix:(With nobody on her side, she must feel all alone... But helping people like her is the whole reason I became a lawyer in the first place.)Buckler:And then I heard about a lawyer named \"Phoenix Wright.\" They say he defends clients to the end, no matter how bleak the circumstances.Phoenix:Hmm, guess my reputation DOES precede me. ...Not sure how well-deserved it is, though.Buckler:I thought to myself, if anybody can save my friend, it's you, Phoenix.Phoenix:(Quite a tall order there for a man who just got his badge back... But I don't want to let Sasha down... or her friend!)Athena:Let's help her, Mr. Wright! Let's save her friend!Phoenix:That's just what I was thinking. Sasha, we'll accept your case.Buckler:Y-You will?! Oh, thank you! You're a lifesaver, literally! Well, no time to stand around and mullet over things! I want you to meet my friend right away! Come to Shipshape Aquarium with me!Athena:You got it!Apollo:And I'll go, too!Phoenix:Sorry, but I need you to stay here and keep an eye on the office until Trucy gets back. You never know when a new client might stop by.Apollo:How come I'M the one who has to stay behind?!Phoenix:Thanks a million, Apollo. Well, ladies, let's move to the aquarium, shall we?TalkWhat to doPhoenix:So what do you think about this case, Apollo?Apollo:The murder of the owner of Shipshape Aquarium? ............Gah. I can't think with you looking at me so expectantly. I don't really have any ideas. Sorry I'm not any help.Athena:But you ARE a help! As long as you're the one playing officesitter, you're \"fine\"!Phoenix:Hey, there's Apollo's favorite word! I think I'll say it a few times, too. I'm fine! I'm fine!Apollo:Are you two making fun of me?Phoenix:Who, us? Of course not. (Just yanking your chain a little.)Any ideas?Phoenix:So, any ideas for us?Apollo:Well, I think you should give that Swashbuckler video a glance.Athena:Starting to become a fan, too, huh? I knew you'd like it if you gave it a chance!Apollo:It's not so much that... I just thought it might give you some leads, seeing as it's the scene of the crime and all.Phoenix:That's a good idea. I'll take a look when I get a second.Apollo:I've got nothing better to do, so maybe I'll watch it a few times myself.Phoenix:Apollo... Please try to find something better to do...PresentAttorney's BadgeApollo:The return of a legendary lawyer! It's kind of exciting.Phoenix:(\"Kind of\"?) So how do I look with it?Apollo:Wow! You present that thing like a real pro! You must've done it a thousand times.Phoenix:It never really seems like enough to just have it pinned to my lapel, for some reason.Apollo:I get wanting to show it off. When I first became a lawyer, I flashed that badge left and right!Phoenix:(Uh, you still do that, actually.)July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua TunnelAthena:Wow, this is gorgeous! It's just like being under the sea!Buckler:Yeah, this is the Aqua Tunnel, our pride and joy. I'm r-EEL-y glad you like it! I'm going to go on ahead and fill the detective in on your arrival. Take a look around the tunnel, and then come meet me at the pool up ahead on the right.Athena:Hey, Boss! Look at this cute little fish!Phoenix:Mmm... I bet it would be delicious grilled.Athena:Seriously? Is that really all you can think of?Phoenix:Well, I didn't get to eat lunch today-- Ooh! And here comes some grilled chicken!Athena:That's not a chicken! It's a penguin! C'mere, little cutie!............*kree*Athena:.........It ignored me...Phoenix:Maybe it was hungry, too... Oh, look. It dropped something.Athena:Ah! It's an ad for the Swashbuckler Spectacular show!Phoenix:That penguin had a whole bunch of these stuffed in its backpack.Athena:So it's passing out flyers, huh? How cute!Phoenix:A carrier penguin that distributes flyers? ...We could use one of those for our office.Swashbuckler Flyer added to the Court Record.Phoenix:Well, can't keep the client waiting! We'd better get going.Athena:Yeah, you're right. Time to roll up our sleeves!July 20Shipshape Aquarium -\u00a0???Phoenix:Huh? I don't see Sasha...???:Ah! Are you two the lawyers Ms. Buckler mentioned?Athena:Detective Fulbright! Are you the lead detective on this case?!Fulbright:That's right. As long as evil exists in this world, there'll be no rest for me! And who is your sea urchin-like friend there? I don't believe we've met...?Phoenix:(Is he talking about me?) I'm the defendant's lawyer, Phoenix Wright.Fulbright:Well, I'm Detective Bobby Fulbright! People don't usually get to see this area. It's only open now because of the investigation. You two are pretty lucky to get this peek behind the scenes of an aquarium!Phoenix:Lucky... Right... (This guy is even louder than Apollo...) So, where is the suspect being questioned? And where is Ms. Buckler????:Here I be, me buckos!Athena:Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!Phoenix:Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!Buckler:Shiver me timbers! There be one of Dread Pirate Nostache's scurvy swabs!Fulbright:I beg your pardon?! I'm not anyone's \"swab,\" \"scurvy\" or otherwise!Buckler:More shameless than a sea lion ye be, tryin' to make off with me best bucko! If ye want to pick a fight with us, ye'd best bring along an army o' great white sharks!???:*squeek*... Fweeeeeeet!Phoenix:S-Sasha, what's going on here...?Buckler:Let me introduce you! This is the friend I was telling you about! Her name is Ora Shipley... ...but she only responds to \"Orla,\" so that's what people call her. I'm her trainer. She's the suspect in the murder, but she'd never hurt anybody.Orla:Fweet!Phoenix:SHE'S the suspect...?!Buckler:Yeah, and thank goodness you came before they put her down! I'm r-EEL-y grateful to the two of you. I just know you'll save Orla!Phoenix:...WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Fulbright:Don't tell me you didn't even know who your client was?Athena:A-An orca is the suspect? Our client is an orca?! Is this for real?!Buckler:Oh, did I forget to mention that? Oopsie!Phoenix:(That's one VERY BIG OOPSIE!) By the way, what was with that mustache earlier...?Buckler:Oh, this be part of me costume for the Swashbuckler Spectacular! When I be wearin' the mustache, I be one of Cap'n Orla's Swashbucklers! A transformation as dramatic as a puffer fish's, wouldn't you say?Phoenix:(I don't think I would ever say that.)Athena:It's a pirate-themed aquarium, so that's why Orla is wearing a pirate hat, right?Buckler:Yup! She really loves wearing hats. She puts them on all the time. But her fake mustache keeps falling off, so that's a problem...Phoenix:I-I see... Well, why don't we start with you telling us a bit more about Orla?TalkOrla the orcaPhoenix:So you're really serious about me defending Orla?Buckler:Of course I am! You're the only one who can do it, Phoenix! I heard you once questioned an animal during a trial, and that got your client off the hook!Athena:No way! You did that?!Phoenix:I, ah... might've tried something like that at one point in my career...Athena:Ooh, you're gonna have to tell me all about this later, or I'll ask Apollo for all the juicy details!Buckler:When I heard you didn't discriminate against animals, I knew you'd hear me out.Phoenix:I have to warn you, though. I don't know anything about orcas. I mean, they don't... eat people, do they...?Orla:Fweet! FWEEEEEEET!Phoenix:YIKES! (I think I made her mad!)Buckler:I won't have you talk that way in front of Orla! Orcas have feelings too, you know!Athena:Yeah, Boss! They have emotions just like we do!Phoenix:S-Sorry! (Is anger the only feeling I inspire in women?)Buckler:Don't worry. She says she forgives you! Besides, orcas are very picky eaters. Orla here only eats fish. The captain went to feed Orla this morning, and then he was found dead in this very room.Phoenix:Could you tell us more about his death?About the murder (appears after \"Orla the orca\")Phoenix:So the owner of the aquarium, Jack Shipley, was discovered murdered...Buckler:Yeah... It was about 10:10 this morning, just after the aquarium opened. A visitor was viewing the orca pool from the visitor's corridor and screamed.Phoenix:The orca pool is this tank here?Buckler:Yeah, that's right. This pool is built so that guests can see into it from the corridor on the first floor. The security guard and I heard the scream and came running into this pool room... ...where we found the captain dead at the side of the pool in his Swashbuckler costume. He was as big and tough as an ol' crocodile, the captain. I still can't believe he's dead...Athena:Mr. Shipley was very important to you, wasn't he?Buckler:Sorry. I didn't mean to get all sad goldfish on you...Phoenix:(Sad goldfish...?)Buckler:Okay. Time to snapper out of it! When it's showtime, it's time to smile! That's what the captain always said.Athena:...By the way, do you know why exactly Orla is being accused of the crime?Why is Orla accused? (appears after \"About the murder\")Leads to:\"Can you think of any reason why Orla would come under suspicion?\"PresentSwashbuckler FlyerSasha:Do you two want to be in the Swashbuckler Spectacular?Phoenix:You have regular people participate?Buckler:Of course! We even have a special tour for people who want to be in it!Athena:What roles would we play if we said yes?Buckler:Let's see... The roles of a blue seahorse and a yellow sea slug are available!Phoenix:Judging by the colors, I must be the seahorse.Athena:A-And I'm the sea slug?! No way! I won't do it!Buckler:But sea slugs are all fluttery and beautiful, Athena!Athena:They're... beautiful? In that case, I'll do it!Phoenix:(Her mind is pretty much an open book.)Buckler:Ha ha ha! I hope we can do a show together someday!Phoenix:Can you think of any reason why Orla would come under suspicion?Buckler:The police think Orla went berserk during practice for the Swashbuckler Spectacular. But Orla would never do anything like that! Right, Orla?Orla:Fweeeeeeet! Fwee, fwee!Athena:Aw, just look at that face! Isn't she adorable! The charges just HAVE to be false!Phoenix:Hate to break it to you, but the police don't usually base its decisions on \"cuteness.\"Fulbright:That's right! We base them on facts! Take a look at this.Phoenix:(A photo of the victim, huh?) He's got a wound on his head.Fulbright:Very perceptive! The victim and the orca were the only ones here. What's more, we couldn't find a weapon of any kind around.Photo of the Body added to the Court Record.Athena:So what's the theory on how Orla supposedly killed the victim?Fulbright:They say orcas sometimes kill their prey by ramming into them underwater. We believe this orca did just that by pulling the victim into this sixty-five-foot pool... (Changed from [We believe this orca did just that by pulling the victim into this 65-foot pool...] in the original release) ...and then ramming into him while they were in the water!Phoenix:(Hmm... Without any suspects besides Orla, this could be one tough case...)Orca Pool Diagram added to the Court Record.Fulbright:No official autopsy has been ordered, but an orca attack makes sense.Phoenix:Why hasn't one been ordered?Fulbright:Accidental death due to a failure to exercise proper oversight over an animal. The medical examiner said it wasn't a homicide, so we don't need an autopsy.Athena:So Orla's going to be put down without a proper investigation?! That isn't fair! That's nothing short of police negligence, Detective Fulbright!Fulbright:The incident wasn't determined a homicide, so there's nothing we can do, Ms. Cykes! Ordinarily, the owner of the aquarium would be held responsible for the oversight failure... ...but the owner is the victim himself, so all we can do is hold the orca responsible.Buckler:Phoenix! Isn't there anything you can do?! They're going to put Orla down!Phoenix:(Sasha and Orla are depending on me. I want to do everything I can to help them! But how do I help an orca? Wait... Yes, I can do this!)Find the real killerPhoenix:...I'll find the real killer!Buckler:Oh, thank you, Phoenix! And I'll do everything I can to help you!Fulbright:Wait just one moment! You're not a police officer or a prosecutor! You're not even officially the defendant's lawyer! You have no right to investigate!Phoenix:(I'm not officially Orla's lawyer, huh...? In that case, I know exactly what I have to do!)Leads back to:\"Yes, I can do this!\"Defend Orla in courtLeads to:\"I got my badge back now, so I know exactly what I have to do.\"Set Orla freePhoenix:...I'll set Orla free.Buckler:Okay! I'll go open the water gate!Fulbright:If you think I'll just let you set the suspect free, you've got another thing coming!Buckler:Pollocks to you, punk!Phoenix:(I guess until I can actually try to prove Orla's innocence... ...I can't truly set her free... Which means...)Leads back to:\"Yes, I can do this!\"Phoenix:(I got my badge back now, so I know exactly what I have to do.) ...I'll defend Orla in court.Fulbright:Huh?Phoenix:Even an orca deserves a fair trial. If the one responsible for Orla is dead... then I'll take responsibility for her!Athena:You'll what?! I guess doing crazy things just once in your career wasn't enough, huh? But what the heck! I'll take responsibility for her, too!Fulbright:Are you two insane?! This is a case of accidental death caused by an animal! It's not a murder case! With no evidence of foul play, this case will never go to court!Phoenix:Then let us investigate the crime scene. If we can prove this was a murder, we might be able to take it to trial. And then Orla would certainly need the help of a few good lawyers!Fulbright:Hmm... I guess so... But who's ever heard of a trial for a killer whale?!Athena:Just because it's never been done before doesn't mean we can't do it now!Fulbright:But... Hmmmmmmmmm...Athena:Please, Detective Fulbright! For justice's sake!Fulbright:............ The police have determined that an animal that has harmed a human should be put down. But I don't know for sure whether that was a just decision... If your sense of justice compels you to take on the defense of this animal... ...then my sense of justice tells me to let this case be reexamined for possible merit!Phoenix:Y-You mean it?!Athena:Really?! That's fantastic! You're not such a bad guy after all, Detective Fulbright!Fulbright:Just remember, this case hasn't been officially recognized as a homicide yet. I'll get in touch with the prosecutor's office, but I'm not making any promises. Anyway, I'd better be off!Buckler:You two are our lifeboat! I'll be right here if you need me!Phoenix:Thanks. I've got a feeling we'll really need your help with this investigation.Athena:We're still not sure if it'll go to trial, but as Orla's lawyers, we'll do everything we can!Phoenix:To get this case into court, we'll need a prosecutor to make an indictment... ...so we have to find enough evidence to prove it's a criminal case.Athena:There just has to be something that shows the culprit was somebody other than Orla!Phoenix:Hmm... Detective Fulbright said there were no weapons in the area, other than her... ...so we'd better look for something to prove him wrong. I'd better make a note of that so I don't forget.Athena:You sure are organized, Boss! Maybe I should get a notebook of my own!Phoenix:I just like to jot down Notes on the case in the Court Record as I go along. We can use it as a sort of \"To Do\" list.Athena:Great idea! I'll add things, too. And whenever we're stuck, we can just refer to the notes!Phoenix:(To read the Notes, I just open the Court Record ([R / RB / E])... ...and then flip to them with [L / LB / Q] or [R / RB / E]. (Changed from [Then I can switch between the tabs by touching them, or with R and L.] in the original release)) There! Note jotted. Now let's investigate this crime scene.Athena:There has to be some evidence here we can use in court! Examining the crime scene from every angle is the key here!Phoenix:That's right. If we change our perspective, we might come across new evidence. Let's first see what we can find using [left analog stick / WASD]... (Changed from [To change perspectives, I can touch the arrows on the bottom screen or use [D-Pad].] in the original release) ...and when we're ready, we can use [right analog stick left/right / left/right arrow keys] to change our perspective. (Line newly added in the Trilogy release)Athena:Or, if there's a particular spot that's got your attention, get right up to it and look away!Phoenix:(Like that outline of the body in the far right there...?)Athena:Of course, talking to everybody involved is one of the keys to good investigation.Phoenix:Exactly. And if we \"Present\" items to people, we might learn even more.Athena:Right! It all boils down to thorough legwork! Well, let's get started!ExamineFront side of OrlaAthena:Is that show makeup above Orla's eye?Buckler:That's right. It's a starfish. Kinda makes her look like a punk-rockin' pirate, dont'cha think?Phoenix:(A punk-rock pirate killer whale...? *groan* It's official -- society's on the road to ruin.)Athena:Well, I think Orla is one hot rockfish! Speaking of rockin', how do you get Orla to do what you want during the show?Buckler:I give her signals with this whistle.Phoenix:Oh? But I didn't hear anything just now.Buckler:The sound's out of the range of human hearing, just like a dog whistle. Orcas have better hearing than people do. They can even hear the whistle underwater.Athena:That's so cool! I wish I could give commands to Orla!Buckler:Anybody can do that. All they'd have to do is learn the signals. Here, Athena. You can have one of our whistles. Consider it a present!Whistle added to the Court Record.Athena:Gee, thanks!Buckler:As for the actual commands, I'm afraid I can't teach them to you. They're top-secret.Front side of Orla (subsequent times)Athena:Is that show makeup above Orla's eye?Buckler:That's right. It's a starfish. Kinda makes her look like a punk-rockin' pirate, dont'cha think?Phoenix:(A punk-rock pirate killer whale...? *groan* It's official -- society's on the road to ruin.)Athena:Well, I think Orla is one hot rockfish! Speaking of rockin', how do you get Orla to do what you want during the show?Buckler:I give her signals with this whistle.Phoenix:Oh? But I didn't hear anything just now.Buckler:The sound's out of the range of human hearing, just like a dog whistle. Orcas have better hearing than people do. They can even hear the whistle underwater.Athena:That's so cool! I wish I could give commands to Orla!Buckler:Anybody can do that. All they'd have to do is learn the signals.Left or right side of OrlaPhoenix:(Orla's not going to notice me from here. I'd better move around to the front...)LadderPhoenix:It doesn't look like the ladder goes all the way down to the bottom of the pool.Athena:But there's usually water in the pool, so it doesn't need to. So apparently, the pool spans two whole floors. Ordinarily, visitors only get to see what they can from the first floor... ...but they said on TV that they sometimes give behind-the-scenes tours!Phoenix:Sounds likes that Swashbuckler Spectacular show you recorded is really coming in handy.OctopusAthena:Yikes! Look at that huge octopus!Phoenix:That must be a show prop, too. One of its legs is missing, though.Athena:Wouldn't it be exciting to take on a huge enemy like that?! I'd like to give it a try, myself -- as a lawyer, that is!Phoenix:(You know you have an insufficient number of limbs to out-object it, right...?)BackdropPhoenix:A setting sun... Sunsets always remind me how quickly the day goes by...Athena:Oh, Boss! It's just a painted backdrop, you know!Phoenix:Down, Athena. Of course I know. I guess they use it for the Swashbuckler Spectacular.Athena:It looks handmade. Ooh, I just got an idea! Why don't we make our own \"not guilty\" backdrop?Phoenix:And present it to the judge when things aren't going our way?Athena:No, we put psychological pressure on the judge by hanging it behind the defendant!Phoenix:I... almost want to see how the judge would respond to that...HoistAthena:Hey, look! There's an apparatus here to hang from.Phoenix:I don't think it's for people to hang from. It looks more like a crane to move things with.Athena:But Sasha was hanging from it during the Swashbuckler Spectacular. I bet there are all kinds of ways to use it, not just to move things. C'mon, Boss! Try thinking outside the box!Phoenix:(Is she trying to say I have a narrow-minded view of things?)Hoop or piece of meatPhoenix:There's a piece of meat and a plastic hoop suspended from the ceiling. Talk about a clashy d\u00e9cor.Athena:I guess Orla really likes meat. Who knew they fed her such huge chunks, though.Phoenix:Uh, all orcas are carnivores. You knew that, right?Athena:Of course, silly! And I love meat, too! Protein is your body's basic building block, after all!Phoenix:But that meat is made out of rubber. I doubt Orla could really eat it, even if she wanted to.Athena:You mean to tell me she jumps all the way up there and doesn't get her reward? The poor girl! After all that effort!Phoenix:I don't think Orla is as dumb as you think she is...DoorPhoenix:The doors are slightly open, and there are police officers standing guard outside.Athena:I guess they're watching to make sure we don't try any funny business.Phoenix:Well, now that you've said it, I suddenly feel the urge to do something.Athena:How about if I suddenly break out some squat exercises? That would be pretty funny.Phoenix:Yeah... that might cause a few raised eyebrows in ways you don't want, Athena...BallPhoenix:Oh, look. There's a ball in the water. Is that another prop for the show?Buckler:That's one of Orla's toys. She plays volleyball with it. It's usually in the bin. Guess I must've forgotten to put it away yesterday.Athena:Wow, I wish I could play volleyball with Orla!Buckler:You have as much fight in you as a mean, old lobster! I like it! There aren't many people who wanna be on the receiving end of Orla's fast ball!Athena:H-Her fast ball?!Buckler:Yeah. She likes to be naughty and slam the ball into things around the pool. You should hear the sound that ball makes when it crashes into stuff!Athena:U-Uh, well, maybe some other time...!Phoenix:(She suddenly went from \"fighting lobster\" to \"reluctant hermit crab\"...)Shark cannonAthena:Hey, there's a cannon in the shape of a shark! I'd love to try firing that thing! Boom!Phoenix:Are these cannonballs supposed to look like fish eggs or something...?Athena:Hm? But why fish eggs? Why not baby sharks? Think about how crazy it would be to have sharks go flying through the air! Watch the thrilling life-or-death struggle as the little tykes fight to stay alive out of water! I can see it now! The drama! The mayhem! The whirlwind of teeth!Phoenix:(A tornado of sharks? Not even Hollywood could conjure up something that insane.)Control panelPhoenix:Looks like the control panel for that crane apparatus. There sure are a lot of buttons...Athena:When I see this many buttons, I start to get fidgety.Phoenix:I know what you mean. You start itching to push them, right?Athena:Nah, I start itching to make a psychological study of people who want to push buttons!Phoenix:...Need I remind you that I'm your boss, not your guinea pig?Boxes and props (from far away)Phoenix:(It's too far away to get a good look. I'd better get a little closer first.)Boxes and props (from close up)Athena:What a mess! Was all this stuff knocked over when the victim struggled with his killer? (Changed from [What a mess! Was all this stuff knocked over when the victim struggle [sic] with his killer?] in the original release)Phoenix:It's possible, but it would be hard to prove. Let's take a closer look, shall we?BoxesAthena:Look at all this stuff scattered everywhere! I see some swords! I wonder if they have anything to do with the case?!Phoenix:They're made of rubber. I doubt they could be used as a weapon.Athena:But I still bet if someone got whapped with one, it would sting quite a bit.Phoenix:...Yeah, I guess it would.Athena:But I think I could stand the pain.Phoenix:Yeah? Good for you... (Oh, look. There's a blow-up dolphin and an anchor, too.)Athena:Mr. Wright! Are you even listening to me? Stop looking at those toys!Phoenix:(Yikes! Guess I've been caught red-faced!)Body outlineAthena:Ugh. So this is where the body was found, huh?Phoenix:If they suspect Orla, maybe they found some evidence of an attack on the victim...?Buckler:Orla didn't attack the captain! She loved him! The captain rescued Orla when she was little, after she got beached on the shore. He tried to release her into the ocean, but she kept coming back. I can tell Orla's sad about losing the captain. She's just not her usual chipper self.Athena:Orla must really love this aquarium and the captain.Buckler:She's the only one around here big and strong enough to play with the big, tough captain. Every day, she made a point of head-butting him and stealing his hat.Phoenix:Yikes! I guess you weren't kidding when you said the captain was a really strong guy.TalkWhy is Orla accused?Phoenix:Okay, let's run through why Orla is under suspicion one more time, shall we?Buckler:The police think Orla went berserk during practice for the Swashbuckler Spectacular.Phoenix:(No official autopsy has been ordered but the victim's head injury can be seen in the photo. The victim and Orla were the only ones here, and there was no weapon of any kind.)Athena:They think Orla dragged the victim into the pool, which is about sixty-five feet deep... (Changed from [They think Orla dragged the victim into the pool, which is about 65 feet deep...] in the original release) ...and then rammed him in the water.Buckler:But Orla would never do anything like that! You two believe me, don't you?!Phoenix:We do. We agreed to take on your case, and we'll believe in you to the very end.Athena:Great! It's all settled, then. Let's start the investigation!After examining front side of Orla, octopus, and body outline:Phoenix:I guess that's about it.Athena:Under different circumstances, I would've loved to see the Swashbuckler Spectacular...Buckler:The three of us always performed the show together -- me, Orla, and the captain... Today's show has been canceled, but we could put on a little performance for you now! We be Cap'n Orla's Swashbucklers, me buckos! We love to sail the seven seas! We've come to rout that mangy blaggard, Dread Pirate Nostache! Avast! There he be, Nostache himself! Prepare to feed the fish!Phoenix:Um... am I playing the role of \"Nostache\"?Athena:Well, Sasha has a \"stache,\" and you don't, so I guess so...Buckler:Hit 'im with yer water cannon, Cap'n, and spare no quarter!Phoenix:Aaaaaaagh!Orla:Fwe fwe fweet. Fwe fwe fwe fweeet! Fwe fwe fwe fweet fwe fwe fweet!Buckler:We swim through storms and wave all because you see... Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me!Athena:Wow! That was awesome! Your performance packed quite a wallop!Phoenix:Yeah... I, for one, feel like I took quite a beating...Buckler:Sorry 'bout that! Can't have a show without a bad-guy role, right?Phoenix:But a singing orca, huh? It must've been tough to train her to do that.Buckler:That's Orla's best trick. She can only sing one song, though.Phoenix:(Well, she's still got one up on a pianist who can't play even one song...) Well, now that we've had a taste of the show, we'd better do some more investigating.Athena:Good idea. Let's go to the Aqua Tunnel!PresentWhistleBuckler:Oh, have you been using the whistle I gave you?Athena:Of course! But I can't get Orla to do any tricks.Phoenix:I can't believe you can command that huge creature. That's pretty impressive, Sasha.Buckler:Pretty cool, huh? I bet there aren't too many people who can say... ...they literally get to \"whistle while they work.\"Phoenix:(That must be pretty nice for you.)Buckler:But Orla is the one who's impressive, really, not me.Athena:It's easy to see how much you care about Orla.Phoenix:You two are a good team.Athena:What...?! But you and I are a great team, right? We can top that!Wright Anything Agency:PresentWhistleApollo:What's this? Something you wear around your neck?Phoenix:It's a whistle they use to make the orca do her tricks.Athena:If I blow it at you, will you do a trick?Apollo:What am I, some kind of circus animal to you two?Phoenix:Well, you ARE one of the talents here at our Wright Anything Agency, after all. The least you could do is learn a trick or two.Apollo:Need I remind I'm a lawyer?! Besides, Athena doesn't know any tricks!Athena:Hee hee! That's what YOU think! I've got a special trick I've been waiting to bust out. I can chug an entire glass of OJ without taking a breath, all while doing squats!Apollo:Well... that's, uh, really something, Athena...Phoenix:(I don't think I want to see Athena do squats...)Anything elseApollo:Evidence...? Does this mean you want me at the defense's bench in court?!Phoenix:No. I just wanted to see what you think.Apollo:Oh. Darn... In that case, I don't think you want to hear what I think.Aqua Tunnel (before examining front side of Orla, octopus, and body outline in Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool)TalkWhat to doAthena:We have to find some evidence that shows the culprit wasn't Orla!Phoenix:You're really fired up for this, aren't you?Athena:Well, I'm getting pretty good at investigating, thanks to that last case. So I want to show you how much I've learned! Vamos a hacer esto! Let's check out the scene!Phoenix:I'm glad to see your enthusiasm, but if you run like that, you're going to fall.Athena:Aaaaaaaaagh!Phoenix:...Too late.Any ideas?Athena:Well... I have noticed there's an amazing chemistry between Orla and Sasha.Phoenix:Not those kinds of ideas. I mean, any thoughts on the case?Athena:My thoughts are that we don't have enough information yet. That is what my heart is telling me.Phoenix:(In other words, you don't have any ideas. Got it.)PresentAttorney's BadgeAthena:I'm so glad you got your attorney's badge back, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:Me too. I guess I was always meant to be a lawyer. I'm going to polish it up, shinier than it's ever been!Athena:I can top that! I'm going to polish mine until the finish comes off!Phoenix:Never mind. You win.Swashbuckler FlyerAthena:Ooh, the Swashbuckler Spectacular is so exciting! I could watch it a hundred times! The fierce fighting, the graceful moves! Oh, Orla and Sasha are so cool!Phoenix:If you love the show so much, why don't you try auditioning to be in it?Athena:Hey, I know! The whole office could be in it together! We could be the \"Anything Pirate Band\"! You know, from the name of the agency!Phoenix:Sounds like a pretty pathetic pirate band to me.Athena:What are you talking about?! It sounds cutthroat! It means we'd do \"anything\" to get our hands on treasure! Anything, no matter how brutal!Phoenix:Yikes. We're a brutal pirate band?!WhistleAthena:Phwiiiiip! Phwiiip, phwiiip!Phoenix:I didn't ask if you could blow it. It's such a weird whistle, anyway. It doesn't even make a proper \"whistle\" sound.Athena:Most people can't hear it, but I think I can hear it a little bit. It's like a message that only Orla's heart can receive! Aw, that's so sweet!Phoenix:It's the same idea as a dog whistle, so I wonder if dogs can hear it, too?Athena:Grr! Now you ruined it! You don't know anything about girls, do you?Anything elseAthena:Oh, I get it. Your current state of mind is: \"Gather all the information we can get.\" But let's concentrate on USEFUL information from now on, okay, Boss?July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua TunnelFulbright:So you all done investigating the pool already?Phoenix:We had a good look around, but now we're moving on to other areas.Athena:How is the police investigation going? Did you -- say, for example -- find any other suspects besides Orla...?Fulbright:Ha ha ha! Wouldn't that be fortunate for you if we did? But no, I'm afraid not. And even more unfortunate for you... ...I'm afraid we found decisive evidence of the orca's guilt.Phoenix:(What?!) P-Please tell us more, Detective!TalkProof the orca did itAthena:So what's this \"decisive evidence\"?! Don't hold out on us now, Detective Fulbright!Fulbright:I'm very sorry, but I can't share classified information with the defense. Especially not security footage that shows the moment the orca attacked the victim! Yup, I'm to personally see to it that this baby stays safe! It will never leave my side!Policeman:'Scuse me, but there's a call for you, Detective.Fulbright:I'll be right there! Sorry guys, you know how it is!Athena:Well, he never said that HE wouldn't leave ITS side, I guess... Now, let's sneak a peek! Wh-What the--?!Phoenix:Is this supposed to be the moment Orla attacked the victim...?Security Footage added to the Court Record.Athena:This little bit of footage doesn't prove anything!Phoenix:I agree. I believe in Orla and Sasha. Let's just continue with our investigation.Athena:Good idea! ...Huh? There's a sticker on this camera that says, \"Return to the Pub O' Danger.\"Phoenix:Guess somebody there manages the cameras? Let's check it out later.Fulbright:Sorry about that. Prosecutor Blackquill called to remind me to go feed Taka. So where were we...? Oh, that's right! You two got any more questions for me?Phoenix:No, we're good. Thank you. (For leaking all your info!)PresentAttorney's BadgeFulbright:So that's your symbol of justice, is it? Well, this is MINE!Phoenix:(...Wow. He can whip that badge out pretty fast...)Athena:We can top that! Take THIS! Twin attorney's badges!Fulbright:Aaagh! No fair! Two against one!Athena:No fair! Your police badge is bigger and flashier!Fulbright:What?! You dare to call me... \"unfair\"?! Me, the very model of justice itself?!Athena:Boss! I'd say we won this round!Phoenix:Athena, in this battle there are no winners...Photo of the BodyFulbright:The poor victim... It's heart-wrenching! Crime cannot go unpunished!Phoenix:We don't want crime to go unpunished, either.Athena:But we'll do our utmost to defend our client.Fulbright:Hmm. Your form of justice or mine... Which is true justice? I guess we'll see how it plays out.Athena:In other words, he doesn't have enough information right now to make up his mind.Phoenix:Thank you for the translation, Athena.Anything elseFulbright:Ha ha ha! I have NOTHING to say about that! If you're lawyers of any mettle, you'll find the answers for yourselves!After clearing \"Proof the orca did it\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel:July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' DangerAthena:This looks like one of those hands-on exhibits. It has a real air of danger, don't you think?!Phoenix:Well, the banner does say it's the \"PUB O' DANGER\"...Athena:Let's see. According to the description, this room is... ...\"A pub where pirates gather. Explore and interact with sea creatures! Actually feel the electricity of electric eels and feed real piranhas! Experience the terror of the seas with these dangerous experiments!\"Phoenix:All of those sounds less like \"terror\" and more like \"torture\" to me!???:Ahem! I'd thank you to keep it down there, blue boy. I'm conducting an experiment! Do not disturb me, unless you wish to be zapped with an electric eel!Phoenix:M-My apologies, ma'am. (Wow. She seems intense...)Athena:Excuse me, but who are you????:Before you ask others, shouldn't you give YOUR name first? Basic manners, young lady.Athena:O-Oh, yes! Of course! My name is--???:Never mind. I will simply call you \"yellow girl.\" It's easier that way.DePlume:I am Norma DePlume. I am very interested in Shipshape Aquarium, and am a frequent visitor here.Athena:B-But... I don't want to be \"yellow girl\"!Phoenix:You think I want to be called \"blue boy\"? ...*sigh* Let's just see what she has to say.TalkNorma DePlumeAthena:You say you're interested in the aquarium, but you don't look like a staff member. Hmm... Let's see... I got it! You're someone completely unrelated to this aquarium!Phoenix:(That's some deductive reasoning there, champ.)DePlume:I am a visitor, a patron, a customer, a guest... And what might you be?Athena:I'm not a \"what\"! I'm a lawyer!Phoenix:(Hey, that's what I was going to say!) A-And I run a law office!DePlume:Well, whatever you are, I don't have the slightest interest.Athena:Grr! Just who does she think she is, Boss?!Phoenix:\"A visitor, a patron, a customer, a guest,\" remember?Why you're here (appears after \"Norma DePlume\")Athena:I thought they closed the aquarium and weren't letting members of the public in?DePlume:Oh ho ho! But I have special permission, you see.Phoenix:And why exactly is that, if I may ask?DePlume:Well, because of the incide-- Heavens! I've said too much.2 PSYCHE-LOCKSPhoenix:I-I remember this...! Psyche-Locks!Athena:Huh? Psychedelic rock? Cyborg clocks? What?!Phoenix:No, no. \"Psyche-Locks.\" It's the power of this magatama. It gives me the ability to see the secrets locked away in somebody's heart. If I can remove the locks, I can uncover their secrets.Athena:I didn't know you had a magical item like that!Phoenix:It looks like this lady knows something about what happened. I'll just use my magatama and undo her Psyche-Locks. (Huh? I can't see the locks anymore!)Athena:Huh? The color of that stone looks different from before.Phoenix:That's funny. Maybe it's just out of juice...?Athena:I-It can do that?Phoenix:Yeah. A certain girl I know poured her spiritual power into it for me. Without that power, I can't undo the Psyche-Locks.Athena:No way!DePlume:Hmph! Why do I have to keep quiet about it, anyway?! I've never been any good at keeping secrets. But I did promise after all, so I guess I had better keep my mouth shut...Phoenix:Who did you promise what to?DePlume:No comment. Now, go away!Phoenix:*sigh* Just when I thought we could find out more about the case...Athena:Let's go try to find some other way! I'm sure we'll find something!Why you're here (subsequent times)Athena:I thought they closed the aquarium and weren't letting members of the public in?DePlume:Oh ho ho! But I have special permission, you see.Phoenix:And why exactly is that, if I may ask?DePlume:Well, because of the incide-- Heavens! I've said too much.Phoenix:(Without some spiritual power, the Magatama can't help me unlock Ms. DePlume's secret. I guess we'll just have to think of some other way.)PresentSwashbuckler FlyerDePlume:A Swashbuckler flyer? I have more than enough of those already. Do you have any idea how many times I've visited this aquarium?!Phoenix:(Hey, what are you yelling at me for?) Don't you ever get tired of coming here?DePlume:Hmph! You obviously don't know anything about Shipshape Aquarium. They feature different marine creatures each month, so visitors never get bored.Athena:So you're a fan of Shipshape Aquarium, like me?DePlume:Oh, please! I'm here to gather information-- the fundamental work of a great writer. But I don't suppose that's something you common folk would understand...Athena:Grr! That woman makes me so mad!Phoenix:Now, now. Why don't we \"common folk\" just get back to our investigation?Security FootageDePlume:Don't thrust that under my nose! I won't watch it!Phoenix:Are you usually pretty photogenic, Ms. DePlume?DePlume:Of course I am! I've been compared to a movie star! It's little wonder, with my perfect makeup and stylish figure. Wouldn't you agree?Phoenix:(She wants me to agree?!) Let's get a woman's opinion on this one.Athena:What? You're asking me?! Well, uh, let's see. I DO think you're very pretty, Ms. DePlume.DePlume:Hmm? I get the distinct impression your words are full of hidden meaning...Athena:Well... I wouldn't say \"full\" so much as \"full-figured\"...Phoenix:A-Athena! I'd stop right there if I were you.Anything elseDePlume:I have no interest in looking at meaningless trifles. As a matter of fact, I have no interest in looking at you, blue boy.Phoenix:(What, so now I'm a \"meaningless trifle,\" too?)After clearing \"Why you're here\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger:July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua TunnelAthena:Hey, Detective Fulbright's gone. It looks like the police investigation is over, too.Phoenix:That's too bad. I was hoping to get a little more out of him.???:Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Cleaner? Nuh uh. Feeder? That's right! Yo girl why you hidin' from me? I'm searching all 'round like this be a bad dream.Phoenix:(Is that somebody... rapping?)???:Rifle yo sometimes you make me so mad. But now that you're gone I'm just so sad. Yo Rifle just come back to me. We can be together and sing kree kree kree!Phoenix:What's with this guy, rapping and making strange bird sounds...????:Yikes! W-Who's there?! ...You didn't hear me rappin', did ya?!Phoenix:Yeah, well... Maybe...???:Arrrrrrr! Look, just do me a favor and pretend ya didn't hear nothin'!Phoenix:Fine by us. And who might you be?Rimes:I'm Marlon Rimes. I'm an animal keeper here. But the aquarium is already closed today. Um, at least, I'm pretty sure it is...Athena:Pretty sure? You don't sound too certain... Oh! Are you new here or something?Rimes:Wow! Yeah, that's right! Pretty good guess! So who are you guys?Phoenix:I'm Phoenix Wright.Athena:And I'm Athena Cykes. We're lawyers, and we're going to represent Orla... ...by taking her case to court and proving she's innocent!Rimes:A-Are ya serious?! You wanna defend an orca in COURT?! ...Oh! But if you're here for Orla, that must make ya friends of Sasha's... Sorry if I came across rude.Phoenix:(Sounds like he's friends with Sasha.)Rimes:Sometimes when I'm by myself, I like to rap to pass the time. Especially when I'm around the animals I love.Athena:Ooh, I love animals, too! Especially marine creatures, like dolphins!Phoenix:I like marine creatures, too. (But just the ones you can eat.)Rimes:Yeah? Well, people who like animals are good people. That's what I always say! If there's anything I can do for you two, just say the word! I just started workin' here, though, so I dunno how much help I can be.Athena:Mr. Rimes seems pretty friendly.Phoenix:Yeah, friendly and agreeable.TalkMarlon RimesAthena:So, what exactly do you do here as an animal keeper?Rimes:Mainly, I clean the place and feed the animals. Wiping all this glass takes forever!Phoenix:(I can imagine... This tunnel alone must take most of the day.)Rimes:I also prep the food the animals eat. That's the hardest part of all.Athena:You mean, it's really difficult to get the hang of?Rimes:Nah, I mean, I'm a vegetarian, so cuttin' fish and meat and stuff up creeps me out.Phoenix:Now there's something I never expected to hear from a pirate.About the murderPhoenix:Do you know anything about the incident that took place this morning?Rimes:Yeah. One of our guests saw what happened and started screamin'. I came runnin', but by the time I got there, I couldn't see the orca or the captain.Athena:Speaking of the captain... what was he like?Rimes:Like a strong captain who can turn a wild bunch of ruffians into some great pirates... He always treated us fairly and equally, human and fishes alike. The real deal, man. ...Hey! Wh-what are YOU cryin' for?!Athena:I-I'm not crying! It's just, I can feel your heart crying, that's all.Rimes:G-Girl, whatchu talkin' about?! I'm not cryin', either!Phoenix:(I guess I won't mention that his eyes are puffier than a pair of pufferfish...)Rimes:I bet Sasha and our vet Dr. Crab are even more upset by his death.Phoenix:Vet? This aquarium has a resident vet?Rimes:Yeah... Yo, hold up! I haven't seen Dr. Crab this morning. Staff are supposed to stay put. The night shift has been on duty since last night, but they won't let us go home. Sasha even had to get special permission to go out looking for a lawyer this morning.Athena:Hmm... We haven't seen anybody who looks like a vet.RifleAthena:Were you rapping something about looking for a weapon earlier? A rifle or something...?Rimes:Ha ha ha! No, not a weapon! \"Rifle\" is the name of one of our penguins.Athena:A penguin? Why would you name a penguin something like that?Rimes:Ahoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Prep for the battle, prep for the war! Little lady Rifle gon' even da score! Y'all think you can escape with your pride? Nuh uh, you just gon' be straight up denied! (Changed from [Ya'll [sic] think you can escape with your pride? Nuh uh, you just gon' be straight up denied!] in the original release) Yo! Yo! Yo ho ho! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Anyway, that's what she's like, so we named her \" Rifle.\"Phoenix:...Okay, but did you have to rap it?Rimes:That's just how I roll.Athena:Does Rifle wear a backpack, by any chance?Rimes:Yeah, that's the one! So you've seen her, huh? She's always runnin' away! She's such a good runner, we decided to put her to work deliverin' flyers.Phoenix:Do you really want a dangerous penguin like that running loose?!Rimes:Aw, Rifle's not dangerous. She only attacks people she doesn't like.Athena:When we ran into her earlier, she didn't attack us. She straight up ignored us, actually.Rimes:Hey, I have an idea! If you run into Rifle again, would ya mind feedin' her for me? She didn't come back to the pool at feedin' time like usual, so I've been lookin' for her. She loves the smell of fish, so she might come over to you if you have some.Athena:Ooh, I would LOVE to feed a penguin! That'd be okay, right, Boss?Phoenix:I don't mind, as long as YOU carry the fish.Fish handed over to Athena.Athena:P-U! It smells so... fishy!Phoenix:(Really? What a shocker...)Rifle (subsequent times)Athena:Were you rapping something about looking for a weapon earlier? A rifle or something...?Rimes:Ha ha ha!

That would be nice, especially if it's free.Athena:That'd be perfect for taking a nap at the office after going for a run or something!Phoenix:I prefer you DIDN'T take naps at the office, actually.Rimes:Yeah, I feel ya! Sometimes I fall asleep when I'm feedin' the animals.Athena:I guess only a newbie can truly understand the feelings of another newbie!Rimes:Heh heh. We're kindred spirits, my sister. Kindred spirits.Athena:Two peas in a pod! Birds of a feather!Phoenix:I suddenly feel so alone.FishPhoenix:Mr. Rimes, about this fish...Rimes:I'm the master keeper! No way you can beat me! You're a pro lawyer, but an amateur feeder! Ya'll [sic] ready for a feeding throw-down? Rifle c'mon! Time to defend da crown!Phoenix:............ Uh, it doesn't look like Rifle's coming...Rimes:............I guess not, huh? Sorry about all that \"throw-down\" stuff, then... I just wanted to show ya the inner secrets of animal feedin'.Phoenix:There are \"inner secrets\"?Rimes:You know, stuff like how to debone a fish. Great care goes into each animal's food. Then of course there's the way of tossin' the food to 'em. It's different for each one.Phoenix:...I see. Sorry to have bothered you with mundane questions from the uninitiated.Anything elseRimes:I'm new here, so I dunno.Phoenix:(I don't really think being \"new here\" has anything to do with it in this instance...)After clearing all Talk options:Rimes:Oh, yeah. Besides Rifle, I've been lookin' for Small Fry, too.Phoenix:\"Small Fry\"? Is that another penguin?Rimes:Nah, she's a friend I made, a high-school girl. She went off lookin' for Rifle somewhere and hasn't been back.Athena:Is she... your girlfriend?Rimes:What?! Nah, no way! Sasha is the one I--Athena:So you like Ms. Buckler, do you!Rimes:Well, I-I really respect her, ya know? We have different tastes in music, but I admire the way she lives her life! It's not like I \"like\" her. It's more complicated than that...Phoenix:(I'm pretty sure that all adds up to \"like\"...)Rimes:She tries to put on a brave face... ...but I think the captain's death is hittin' her hardest of all. After all, it was her human show partner that got killed by that orca.Athena:So you think Orla really did it?Rimes:Well, I can understand how Sasha feels... ...but she's the only one of us who doesn't think the orca did it.Athena:Oh, I see...Phoenix:(I guess it isn't easy to believe in somebody who can't even speak up for herself...)Rimes:Anyway, let me know if you see Rifle or Small Fry, okay? Small Fry said she was gonna go check the orca pool.Phoenix:Maybe we'll head back there, then.Orca Pool (before clearing all Talk options with Marlon Rimes in Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel)PresentFishBuckler:You be givin' me a fish?! So you be challengin' me to a fight, eh?! Arr!Phoenix:What?! No! What kind of rule is that?!Athena:That's how it goes in the Swashbuckler Spectacular! Present a fish. Start fighting. The gauntlet--I mean, the fish--is thrown down, and the glorious battle begins! Ooh, you're so cool when you're up there jumping and slashing!Buckler:Arr! Belay that talk, li'l lassie!

There's something on the left side of the pool that wasn't here before...) It looks like an electronic sword...?Buckler:Hey, you're back!Phoenix:Hi, Sasha. What's with this strange sword here?Buckler:Oh, that's a walkie-talkie. It's probably Rifle's.Athena:R-Rifle can use a walkie-talkie?!Buckler:She's always running away, so we attached a walkie-talkie to her. If we can hear the sounds around her, we can usually guess where she is.Phoenix:(But not if she drops the walkie-talkie on the floor.)Buckler:Every member of the crew has one, too, so we can communicate back and forth. We can even use them to broadcast to specific parts of the aquarium. Cool, huh?Walkie-Talkie added to the Court Record.Athena:Well, if Rifle's walkie-talkie is here, then Rifle might still be here, too! Rifle! Come out, come out, wherever you are!*SPLASH!*Athena:Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!Orla:Fweet?Buckler:Are you okay? You have to be careful around pools, or you might slip right in!Athena:I'm more afraid of my heart jumping right out!Phoenix:Hey, who's that riding on Orla? Isn't that Rifle?Athena:Hey, you're right! C'mere, Rifle!Rifle:............ *kree*Athena:Argh! She ignored mem again! Why doesn't that penguin like me?!

I haven't seen you in ages!Phoenix:(Could Pearls be the \"Small Fry\" Mr. Rimes was talking about?)Pearl:Congratulations on your return to lawyering! I've been thinking about stopping by your office for a visit to congratulate you.Phoenix:(This is Pearl Fey. I call her \"Pearls.\" She may dress a little funny... ...but that's because she's a spirit medium -- a real prodigy with great power, at that. I've known her since she was little, and she sometimes comes to the office to visit. She's just a little older than Trucy, so she's been like a big sister to her.)Pearl:I guess everyone here knows Mr. Nick, then? He's such a nice guy, don't you think?Phoenix:(...Is she trying to be MY big sister too, now?!)TalkPearl FeyPhoenix:What are you doing here, Pearls?Pearl:My summer camp is here on a field trip. I've never been to such a big aquarium before, so I was really looking forward to it! But then that incident happened... and the police just finished questioning me.Phoenix:Oh, I see.Pearl:Um...Mr. Nick...? Who is that lady next to you...?Athena:I'm Athena Cykes! I'm a new lawyer at the Wright Anything Agency!Pearl:Oh, how do you do! My name is Pearl Fey. My cousin and my friends call me \"Pearly.\"Athena:\"Pearly\" it is, then! Nice to meet you!Pearl:So... how did the two of you meet...?Phoenix:Well, you know how I used to travel to Europe to study their legal systems, Pearls? I met Athena on one of those trips.Meeting Athena (appears after \"Pearl Fey\")Pearl:So, tell me more about how the two of you met in Europe.Phoenix:(Hey, I thought I was supposed to be asking the questions here!)Athena:A long time ago, Mr. Wright helped me out of a difficult jam. That's when I started thinking about becoming a lawyer like him.Pearl:So you're like her mentor, huh, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:Yeah, something like that, I guess.Athena:Mr. Wright is the whole reason I am who I am today! He was the one who told me my knowledge of psychology could help people in court!Pearl:Gee, Mr. Nick, it looks like you've become a real adult since the last time I saw you!Phoenix:(I've always been an adult the entire time I've known you, Pearls!)Rifle:*kreeeee*Athena:Well, would you look at that! Rifle loves you!Phoenix:She sure does seem to be attracted to Pearls...Pearl:Hee hee! I'm so glad she likes me! Penguins are so adorable, aren't they! I even bought myself a little penguin calendar here at the aquarium gift shop. I have it hanging from my bag already!Athena:Oh, how cute! A calendar in the shape of a penguin!Buckler:That calendar is a real hit with all our female visitors. I even have one myself! But the rest of the staff thinks it's... too cutesy.Phoenix:I guess it doesn't really fit the whole \"rough-and-tumble pirate\" image very well... But, hmm... why does this calendar smell kind of like fish...?Pearl:Wh-What do you mean, Mr. Nick?! Please don't be rude!Phoenix:(Uh-oh. I got Pearls mad...)Calendar added to the Court Record.Meeting Athena (subsequent times)Pearl:So, tell me more about how the two of you met in Europe.Phoenix:(Hey, I thought I was supposed to be asking the questions here!)Athena:A long time ago, Mr. Wright helped me out of a difficult jam.

I was trying to help Mr. Marlon, the animal keeper.Athena:C'mere, Rifle! C'mon!Rifle:*kree!*Phoenix:She went towards Orla instead.Athena:Grrrrr! Why can't I get Rifle to like me?!Phoenix:Maybe you should quit chasing after her with that scowl of yours...Pearl:Mr. Nick! How could you speak to a lady so rudely?!Phoenix:(Uh-oh. I got Pearls mad... again.) Why don't you try to get Rifle to take some food from you?Athena:Oh, great idea! And I have just the thing to present her, too! (Changed from [Oh, great idea! And I have just the thing to offer her, too!] in the original release)PresentAttorney's BadgePearl:Oh, I'm so happy you get to be a lawyer again, Mr. Nick!Phoenix:Ha ha. Thanks. I let our friends know I was back, too.Pearl:I wish we could all get together. It's been quite a while! Maybe we should throw you a surprise party to celebrate your comeback.Phoenix:That would be really nice. But if you tell me about it, it won't be a surprise, you know.Pearl:Oh! B-But we could spring it on you after you had forgotten, and still surprise you!Swashbuckler FlyerPearl:I was really looking forward to seeing the Swashbuckler Spectacular... It's such a shame.Phoenix:Yeah. I bet you would've really enjoyed it.Pearl:But I was really happy to see such a large marine animal! It was quite an experience! ...I still have yet to see a blue whale, though, the largest marine animal of them all!Phoenix:Yeah, uh... I doubt there are any blue whales at the aquarium.FishPearl:Oh my! Did you go fishing, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:No, this is for Rifle. We were asked to feed her.Pearl:Ooh, that sounds like fun! Do you think she would take food from me?Phoenix:Oh, I'm sure she would--from you.Athena:...So what you're really trying to say is that Rifle wouldn't take food from ME, right?!Phoenix:No, that's not what I meant. (That IS what I meant, though.)Athena:Grr! I won't be bested! Pearly, it's ON!Pearl:Wh-What? What's \"on\"?Phoenix:Now, now, Athena. Let's be adults about this.

I really love this calendar.Phoenix:It's shaped like a penguin. It is pretty cute, isn't it? Maybe I should buy a calendar for the office before I leave. I always run out of room to write appointments in my planner.Athena:Why don't you just put your appointments on your phone?Phoenix:I'm not very good at using electronic devices...Pearl:Oh, neither am I. Hee hee! We have something in common!Athena:Aw, now I feel left out.Anything elsePearl:You know I'd do anything I could to help you! ...But I'm afraid I don't really know anything about that...Phoenix:That's all right, Pearls. No worries.Athena:Rifle! I have a present for you! It's chock-filled with love! Here you go!Orla:Fwee, fweet!Athena:Hey! Orla ate my love-filled fish! At least it looks like she enjoyed it, though.Orla:Fwee, fweet!Athena:I think Orla and I just had a bonding moment!Pearl:Friendship blossoming with the exchange of some food! Oh, isn't it moving, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:I think \"moving\" might be going a bit far... Anyway, how did you get Rifle to come to you so easily, Pearls? I heard Rifle was attracted to the smell of fish...Pearl:M-Mr. Nick! Are you saying I smell like fish?!Phoenix:Uh, maybe just a little, yes...Pearl:Hmm... I guess I need to change my clothes...Phoenix:(That's odd... I wonder why Pearls smells like she's holding a bucket of fish...?)Buckler:Hmm... Orla doesn't usually want to eat at this time of day... And we've even been giving her more food than normal at her regular meal times lately...TalkOrla's feeding habits (Changed from [Orla's eating] in the original release)Phoenix:Is there something wrong with Orla's feeding habits lately?Buckler:Yeah, something's weird. The new guy, Marlon, feeds all the other animals besides Orla. But the captain and I, her trainer, are responsible for feeding Orla. It was the captain's turn to feed Orla this morning.Athena:But Orla keeps coming to me and signaling she's still hungry. She wants my fish, chock-filled with love!Phoenix:How long are you going to keep saying that? (She sure is excited to make a new friend.)Buckler:But I don't think the captain would've forgotten to feed Orla...Orla and RiflePearl:Rifle and that big creature there certainly seem to love each other!Buckler:This is Orla the orca. Rifle and Orla are best friends! They belong together like a clownfish and a sea anemone!Phoenix:(Care to phrase that in a way us non-biology majors can understand...?)Pearl:Oh! So this orca is the suspect. I-I read in a book once that orcas eat penguins...!Buckler:Don't you worry about that. Orla here's really gentle, and she never eats anything but fish.Rifle:*kree!* *kreeeee!*Orla:Fwee... Fwee, fwee...Buckler:She's an ol' sweetheart. As a matter of fact, she even tolerates Rifle picking on her!Phoenix:It's true, she does seem very gentle. She hardly seems like a \"killer\" whale...Athena:As lawyers, we have to do everything we can to save this beautiful, gentle creature!Pearl:Wow, you're going to defend her in court? She's... quite the defendant, isn't she...?Phoenix:She's the biggest defendant we've ever had. (Literally!)After clearing all Talk options:Phoenix:Oh, Pearls. I have a big favor to ask.Pearl:What is it, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:It's about my magatama... Its spiritual power seems to have vanished.Pearl:Oh! That magatama brings back memories! I remember pouring my spiritual power into it. That was so many years ago... I guess that's why it's almost out now. ...There you go, Mr. Nick. It should be fine now.Phoenix:Thank you, Pearls! Now I can break Psyche-Locks again.Pearl:Hee hee. I'm glad I could help! Well, I think I'll go find Mr. Marlon now. I have to bring Rifle to him.Athena:Pearly sure seems right at home at this aquarium.Phoenix:Hmm, you're right. But didn't she say this was her first time here...?Buckler:Apparently, that girl was in the staff corridor earlier this morning. That's why the detective was questioning her.Phoenix:What was Pearls doing in the staff corridor?Buckler:I dunno. I thought she was Marlon's friend or something.Phoenix:The staff corridor, huh...? Something about that doesn't sit well with me...Orca Pool Diagram updated in the Court Record.Athena:Well, if it bothers you, why don't you just ask her about it?Phoenix:Yeah, good idea.

That's one of the basic rules of investigating! \"The lawyer always returns to the scene of the investigation.\"Phoenix:Wasn't that \"The criminal always returns to the scene of the crime\"?Any ideas?Athena:There sure are a lot of interesting characters at Shipshape Aquarium!Phoenix:I'll say. It's like a wild pirate ship.Athena:I guess they really wanted to give the place an authentic piratey flavor.

There is no \"relationship\" between Mr. Marlon and me.

Before I knew it, everyone else had moved on, and I got lost. I was so embarrassed to be lost at my age!Phoenix:Oh, Pearls. I know big, crowded places are hard for you.Pearl:I sort of panicked... and went down the wrong corridor. I ended up in the food prep room, and that's where I met Mr. Marlon. I really startled him when I called out to him. He jumped so much, he startled me, too, and I lost my balance and fell down. Oh, Mr. Nick! I spilled so many fish all over the floor!Phoenix:I guess that explains why you smell fishy, pardon the pun.Pearl:Yes. And my calendar fell off my bag and got buried in all the fish, too.Phoenix:(But it doesn't explain why Pearls wanted to keep it a secret.)Why did you hide it? (appears after \"Relation to Rimes\")Phoenix:Why did you want to hide your meeting with Mr. Rimes?Pearl:Well, I didn't want him to get in trouble over feed sanitation regulations because of me. And Mr. Marlon said he didn't want anyone to know he was in the food prep room.Phoenix:Huh? Why not? What was he doing in there?Pearl:Before I spoke to him, he was staring at a calendar. But, because of me, he dropped his calendar, too. We had to search for it among the fish.Athena:Wait a minute... This calendar of yours... It already has writing in it!Pearl:It does? But I didn't write anything in it yet!Athena:There's something written here under today's date. \"Meet the captain at the orca pool at 7 AM.\"Pearl:Maybe my calendar and Mr. Marlon's got mixed up?Phoenix:Pearls, about what time did you run into Mr. Rimes?Pearl:I think it was about 10:15 when he had the info desk announce that I was lost...

But it has been rumored to attack people...Athena:But rumors are just rumors! They aren't necessarily true!DePlume:Yes, I realize that. But I only write the truth. That is why I questioned the owner directly. But he refused to allow my research, and he even had the audacity to say to me: \"You're nothing but a nuisance, coming here day after day.

Apparently, that speaker is there so visitors can hear the killer whale's sounds. In any case, as I approached the killer whale's tank, I heard its cries. And when I arrived, I saw something terrifying.Phoenix:What did you see?DePlume:The killer whale stealing the Swashbuckler Spectacular hat the owner was wearing... ...and then, the moment it bit him and shook him mercilessly to death within its jaws!Athena:Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!Phoenix:Orla... bit the owner to death...?!Fulbright:In justice we trust! So I take it Ms. DePlume's just finished telling you what she saw?Phoenix:D-Detective Fulbright! I guess you've already heard it, too?Fulbright:Yup, when we took her statement earlier.

And a dangerous creature like that cannot be allowed to harm anyone ever again!Phoenix:B-But she's not dangerous!Fulbright:Sorry, but the Prosecutor's Office said the case didn't have enough merit to go to trial. There was one prosecutor, though, who expressed an interest in the case...Phoenix:Really?! Then could we have that prosecutor take a look at the investigation reports?Fulbright:Unfortunately, I doubt even he'd take action without evidence of a homicide... Look, I understand how you feel, Mr. Lawyer, but maybe you should give up on this one?Phoenix:Not a chance.

You'll see! Let's go, Mr. Wright! Time to check out that crime scene one more time!July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Orca PoolAthena:All right, then! Let's start the re-examination! Pronto! I'm going to go check out that mess in the back one more time!Phoenix:Athena! Wait! No running!Athena:Aaaaaaaaagh!Phoenix:A-Are you okay? (It didn't look like she tripped, but...)Athena:*groan* I slipped.Orla:Fweet!Phoenix:Huh? Orla? What is it, girl?Athena:Aaaaaaah!Phoenix:Athena! Are you all right?! (She crashed into all that stuff behind her.)Athena:*groan* I tried to get out of the way, but all I did was slip and fall... again...Phoenix:That was a pretty amazing wipeout. Are you hurt?Athena:I'm okay... But why did Orla spike that ball at me? After all the fish I gave her, I thought she liked me...Phoenix:Maybe she thought you were the main entr\u00e9e?Athena:Very funny, Boss!Phoenix:Ha ha ha. In any case, let's give the ball back to Orla.Athena:Huh? Looks like everything got shifted around when I fell on it.Phoenix:Hey, you're right. There are things now that we couldn't see before. (Like another ball. I guess Orla really likes them.)Athena:Look! There's something new by the outline of the body, too!Phoenix:We'd better take a good look around.ExamineBoxes and propsBallPhoenix:Orla sure can hit that ball hard!Athena:I didn't think she was gonna spike it at me like that. I guess that must mean she likes me! I gladly accept her expression of affection!Phoenix:...Not how I would've interpreted that, but whatever floats your boat.Octopus legPhoenix:Looks like we just found that giant octopus prop's missing leg.Athena:Wow. I bet you could get a whole lot of Carpaccio from a giant leg like that! Ooh, let's go to the ocean and try and catch a giant octopus of our own!Phoenix:Yeah, but even if we did catch one, how are you planning to slice it up?Athena:Kein Problem! That's what man invented chainsaws for!Phoenix:(I've never seen anyone so hell-bent on chomping down some giant octopus...)    Well, I doubt we could catch one that big anywhere near the shore, anyway...Athena:The more roadblocks you throw up, the more I want to do it, you know. Ooh, I can't wait to get started!Phoenix:(It would appear that Operation Discourage Insanity has backfired...)Footstep iconsAthena:Hey, look at this mark on the floor. What do you suppose it is?Buckler:That's where we stand when we want to play volleyball with Orla.Phoenix:Volleyball, huh?Buckler:Yeah. If we stand there, she'll spike the ball right at us.Athena:So when Orla spiked the ball at me earlier... ...that was one of her tricks?! It doesn't mean she hates me?!Buckler:Nah! She wanted to play with you! She loves volleyball. She used to play with the captain all the time...Athena:Aw... Sasha looks so sad...Buckler:Okay, time to snap out of it! This is no time to be all dejected and mopey like a blobfish!Athena:That's right! Time to put on a smile and stay strong, right?Phoenix:(What's a blobfish? ...Or do I not want to know...)Bloody coinPhoenix:What's this? A coin...?Athena:M-Mr. Wright! There's blood on it!Phoenix:You're right! But it's dried.Athena:Do you think it could be the victim's? And what was it doing all the way over here in the first place?Phoenix:Hmm... I'm not sure, but now that we've found blood outside the pool... ...it just might help us prove that there's more to this case than just \"accidental death.\"Athena:Hey, you're right! Orla certainly can't leave the pool, after all!Bloodstained Coin added to the Court Record.Phoenix:Speaking of coins, take a look at this. There are a few coins around the body here, too.Athena:You're right, Boss! But where did they go? They aren't here anymore. You don't think somebody picked them up, do you?Bloody coin (subsequent times)Phoenix:What's this? A coin...?Athena:M-Mr. Wright! There's blood on it!Phoenix:You're right! But it's dried.Athena:Do you think it could be the victim's? And what was it doing all the way over here in the first place?Phoenix:Hmm... I'm not sure, but now that we've found blood outside the pool... ...it just might help us prove that there's more to this case than just \"accidental death.\"Athena:Hey, you're right! Orla certainly can't leave the pool, after all!Phoenix:Speaking of coins, take a look at this. There are a few coins around the body here, too.Athena:You're right, Boss! But where did they go? They aren't here anymore. You don't think somebody picked them up, do you?Broken swordPhoenix:There's a broken sword here.Athena:Hmm... The tip of the blade is missing. Guess it just broke off.Phoenix:(Don't tell me it happened when Athena fell over...?)Athena:You'd better not be trying to pin the blame on me, Boss!Phoenix:What?! N-No! Of course not!Athena:No use trying to hide it. It's written all over your face! Besides, the broken part isn't even here. How could it have been my fault?!Phoenix:(I'd better watch what I think or I'll get every little thing thrown back in my face.)DummyAthena:Oh no! That child is hurt!Phoenix:What?! Call an ambulance-- Hey, it's just a dummy.Athena:I-It is?! Oh, I mean, of course it is! I was just testing your response to an emergency.Phoenix:Well, I guess we just found that you don't bluff well under pressure.Athena:Grr! I guess I'll just have to keep practicing, then! I wonder what the dummy is for, anyway?Buckler:Oh, that? We use it to train Orla. It's smaller than a human, but it does the job. Some of our tricks can be pretty dangerous, so Orla practices them on the dummy first.Phoenix:(Forget the tricks, those bite marks look pretty dangerous...)After examining footstep icons, bloody coin, and dummy:Phoenix:Hey, Sasha? Would you happen to know anything about this coin?Buckler:Oh, I guess I missed one. I just finished cleaning up the rest of them.Phoenix:You picked up all of the coins already?Buckler:That's right. After the police finished their investigation, they gave me the go-ahead. I haven't found them all yet, though. I'm still missing a few.Athena:Well, if they aren't beside the pool, maybe they're IN the pool. Let's go to that ladder over there and take a peek at the bottom of the pool, Boss!ExamineLeft or right side of ladderPhoenix:(I can't see anything from here. I'll have to take a look when I'm by the ladder...)Front side of ladderBottom of poolLeads to:\"Look! I think I see something on the bottom of the pool.\"Phoenix:Look! I think I see something on the bottom of the pool.Athena:Hee hee! I knew it! Want me to go down and check?Phoenix:You can't jump in dressed like that! You'll drown under the weight of your clothes!Athena:No, I won't! I'm a pretty good swimmer, you know!Phoenix...Be that as it may, that pool's really deep. I doubt you can hold your breath that long. But maybe Sasha can...?Buckler:Whew! Phoenix! Look at all these coins I found at the bottom!Phoenix:Thanks, Sasha. So there really were more of them down there, huh?Athena:We seem to be finding them all over. I wonder how many there are all together?Buckler:Including the ones I put away, there are three hundred of them. They're for the show. (Changed from [Including the ones I put away, there are 300 of them. They're for the show.] in the original release)Phoenix:Hmm... Sounds like they'd be heavy.Buckler:About seven pounds, I'd say. A little lighter than a stringfish. Well, I'd better go put these coins away where they belong!Athena:So, seven pounds of coins, scattered around the scene, one of them with blood on it... They have to be related to the case!Phoenix:(I wonder how the blood got on that one coin? Wait a minute. Could it be...?) Remember how Detective Fulbright said that they couldn't find a murder weapon? Well, what if these coins were the weapon?Athena:Huh? How could a little coin kill a grown man?Phoenix:Well, one coin by itself isn't much of a threat, but... Three hundred coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is... (Changed from [300 coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is...] in the original release)Freeze themPhoenix:I bet a frozen lump of coins would make for a pretty good weapon.Athena:But wouldn't it make more sense to freeze just the water into a block of ice? That way, there'd be no evidence of it ever existing once it melted.Phoenix:...I guess you're right. (But, wait a minute. There IS another way to bundle coins together!)Leads back to:\"Three hundred coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is...\"Put them in a bagLeads to:\"If you put seven pounds of coins in a bag and swung it at somebody...\"Throw themPhoenix:I bet you could kill a man if you threw them hard enough.Athena:Hmm... I dunno about that. I think they'd just bounce off. Besides, how could you throw them that hard all at once?Phoenix:Yeah... (Wait a minute...! Maybe there IS a way to bundle them all together...)Leads back to:\"Three hundred coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is...\"Phoenix:If you put seven pounds of coins in a bag and swung it at somebody... ...it would make a pretty formidable blunt instrument, wouldn't it? It would explain how blood got on this coin.Athena:Oh, I get it! If that bag of coins is the weapon, then we can use it to prove Orla's innocence!Bloodstained Coin updated in the Court Record.Phoenix:But I don't see anything resembling a coin bag around here.Athena:Maybe the killer took it with them.Phoenix:Yeah, it would certainly make it look like Orla did it if they did...Athena:You know what I think, Mr. Wright?! The bloody coin alone should be enough to prove this might have been a murder!Phoenix:I agree. It shows the possibility of a human killer rather than Orla.Athena:Yes! This is just what we needed! Let's go show this coin to Detective Fulbright and Ms. DePlume right away!Phoenix:Good idea. Let's hope they're still at the Pub O' Danger.July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' DangerFulbright:Oh, you're back! So did you find anything?DePlume:Of course he didn't!Fulbright:Remember, even if you don't succeed, it's the effort you make that's important!Phoenix:(Is he trying to console me?)Athena:Let's show them the evidence we found! The one that points to a human culprit!Phoenix:Right. Because we won't let Orla be put down.TalkOrla's violent streakAthena:We won't let you speak badly of Orla! We're going to defend her!DePlume:I'm only stating what I saw with my very own eyes. I came to the aquarium today to observe the killer whale. But on my way to that thing's tank, I heard its cries.Athena:You can hear Orla from the visitor's corridor?DePlume:There are speakers there in the corridor, up near the ceiling. Apparently, that speaker is there so visitors can hear the killer whale's sounds. In any case, as I approached the killer whale's tank, I heard its cries. And when I arrived, I saw something terrifying.Phoenix:What did you see?DePlume:The killer whale stealing the Swashbuckler Spectacular hat the owner was wearing... ...and then, the moment it bit him and shook him mercilessly to death within its jaws!Athena:Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!Phoenix:Orla... bit the owner to death...?!PresentBloodstained CoinLeads to:\"Please take a look at this bloodstained coin.\"Phoenix:Please take a look at this bloodstained coin.DePlume:Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! C-Cease and desist, at once! Wh-What kind of a man shows a lady blood?Phoenix:Urk. (She doesn't have to get so worked up...)Fulbright:What are you terrorizing this lady with?! Come on, now. Let's see it.Phoenix:We found this coin beside the orca pool.Fulbright:We did see a large number of coins beside the pool, but not one with blood on it!Phoenix:We just learned that there's three hundred of these, weighing about seven pounds in total. (Changed from [We just learned that there's 300 of these, weighing about seven pounds all together.] in the original release) Now, what do you suppose would happen if a person was assaulted with that many coins?Fulbright:What?! So you're saying the coins might've been used like some kind of blunt weapon?!Phoenix:If the blood belongs to the victim, then yes, it's entirely possible!Fulbright:Hmm... But I wouldn't call it decisive proof that the real culprit was human...Phoenix:Y-You wouldn't?! Why not?!Fulbright:Because there'd have to be something to put the coins in to make them into a weapon. Without that \"something\", it's just not going to be enough to pass muster. But I will say that your theory does seem to warrant further investigation. I'll call the Prosecutor's Office and ask to reinvestigate from a possible criminal angle.Phoenix:...You will?! Thank you very much!Athena:I really hope Detective Fulbright can convince them...Fulbright:Hmmmm... You won't believe the answer I got. When I explained your passion for this case, and the police's investigation... ...they said that the prosecutor I mentioned earlier would be willing to take this to court.Phoenix:Really?! So does that mean a new suspect has emerged?Fulbright:No, I'm afraid not... To be frank... ...Prosecutor Blackquill said he just wants to prove that orca's guilt in court!Athena:WHAAAAAAAT?! It's Prosecutor Blackquill that wants to prosecute Orla?!Phoenix:...That's fine, Detective. Thanks for arranging this for us.Fulbright:Well, I must say you're taking this rather calmly.Phoenix:Defending Orla in court was my idea from the start. And I'll do whatever it takes to save her.Fulbright:Hmm... In that case, I'll do whatever I can as well to see that justice is served. Ms. DePlume, will you be a witness for the prosecution?DePlume:A trial for a killer whale? I've never heard of such recklessness before in my life! But I will reveal the truth about this killer whale, and then write all about it!Fulbright:Ha ha ha! Sounds like a plan! Now, if you'll just come along with me... We have to prepare for tomorrow, and I still have to arrange for an autopsy.DePlume:Oh ho ho! I look forward to tomorrow! Until then, blue lawyer and yellow fan.Athena:I AM NOT A FAN!Phoenix:...Well, at least we managed to get the case to go to trial.Athena:But how in the world do we defend an orca in court, anyway?Phoenix:To be honest, I'm not really sure myself.Athena:Plus, Ms. DePlume said Orla bit the victim... This trial sure isn't going to be easy... ...but I love a challenge!Phoenix:Ha ha ha. Then we ought to be just fine. Guess I should go over that Swashbuckler Spectacular you were watching this morning.Athena:Yeah! We can have a formal viewing back at the office!Phoenix:(There's nothing decisive against Orla in the security tape, but that doesn't mean much. I'll just have to find a more concrete way to save Orla at tomorrow's trial or else!)To be continuedOrca Pool (before correctly presenting Bloodstained Coin in Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger)ExamineLadderPhoenix:(I guess I've seen enough of the inside the pool...

As a matter of fact, I just ran a few laps around the courthouse to get extra pumped!Phoenix:(And I just splashed my face with some water to get the sleep out of my eyes...)Athena:Oh, I also cued the Swashbuckler video so we can watch it any time.Swashbuckler Video added to the Court Record.Phoenix:Thanks. It just might help our case. By the way, you have some serious dark circles. Did you stay up late watching this?Athena:What?! M-Me? No, I, uh, just woke up early, that's all. ...Guess I need to cover them up. I get ragged on enough as it is by Prosecutor Blackquill.Phoenix:Speaking of being pumped, I'm pretty fired up for this trial, too. It's been a while.Athena:Hee hee.

Must we waste words on this?Phoenix:(Prosecutor Simon Blackquill... Known as the \"Twisted Samurai,\" he's a prosecutor who's also a convicted felon. They say he never conducts a trial without his loyal hawk Taka by his side.)Judge:...Mr. Wright, it's been quite a while since I've seen you like that. The lawyer image suits you. You look younger somehow.Phoenix:Thank you, Your Honor. And you look as young as ever yourself.Judge:Ha ha ha. Well, I have to keep up with you folks, after all. By the way, has the defendant arrived in court yet?Blackquill:...Surely you jest, Your Baldness. Did you not receive the memo? The defendant, Ora Shipley, is an orca at Shipshape Aquarium.Judge:A-An orcaaaaaaaaaaaaa?! Arrangements for this trial were made only yesterday, so I didn't have time to review. But an orca as a defendant? It's patently absurd!Blackquill:Hmph......... Direct your comments to the defense. He's the absurd fellow who insisted on defending the orca in court in the first place.Phoenix:Absurd or not, I will carry out my duty to defend my client.Judge:Your duty to defend your \"crying ant\"? Don't you mean your \"crying orca,\" Mr. Wright?Blackquill:If we are to proceed, we must treat the orca as we would any other defendant. Every soul -- be it of man or beast -- is of equal value. The question is whether that soul is painted in black or white. Take Taka for example. He is as human in spirit as you or I.Taka:Screech!Phoenix:(The real question is, am I in for more pain... as always?)Judge:Hmm... Orca or not, I suppose the defendant is still a defendant. And I vow to render my verdict fairly and impartially! *ahem* Now then, Prosecutor Blackquill, your opening statement, if you would.Blackquill:I suppose I can hardly leave it to someone who knew nothing of the defendant... Very well. Listen carefully. The orca murdered the owner of Shipshape Aquarium in the aquarium's orca pool. The orca apparently toyed with the victim mercilessly as he died.Judge:A sadistic orca... What a chilling thought. And where exactly is this defendant now?Blackquill:Inside this.Judge:A-A cell phone, Prosecutor Blackquill?Blackquill:Hmph... Time marches on, Your Baldness -- with or without us. I borrowed this TV phone from the aquarium, which will allow us to interact with the orca.Judge:A \"TV phone\"? Very well. The court accepts it into evidence.TV Phone added to the Court Record.Blackquill:We will be able to view the defendant in question on this large monitor. Fool Bright, prepare for transmission.Fulbright:Ha ha ha! You've got it, Prosecutor Blackquill!Blackquill:We will proceed with the defendant on telecast.Judge:Hmm... So that is the orca that stands accused, is it?Orla:Fwee, fweet!Phoenix:(Aw. She's waving her flipper at us. Maybe she's cheering us on?)Buckler:Orla, wish Phoenix and Athena luck!Orla:Fweeeet!Judge:Oh, it's quite cute, isn't it? And this adorable creature is suspected of killing a man...?Athena:Orla's really pouring on the charm, huh!Blackquill:She is far from \"cute.\" She is a violent, reckless animal.Fulbright:That's right! The name's Bobby Fulbright, and I'll take over the explaining from here. Now, if I could direct your attention to this diagram of the crime scene. Following the report of an orca attack, we the police raced on over to Shipshape Aquarium. There, we found a guest who says she saw the orca and the victim from the visitor's corridor. As the witness was watching, the orca suddenly went crazy and attacked the victim. The orca was the only one there; therefore, no one else could have committed the crime. It's not quite finished, but I have a portion of the autopsy report here.Shipley's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:I can't imagine the terror of being attacked underwater by such a large creature...Blackquill:But attack it did. Prepare yourself for the grisly details, Your Baldness. The prosecution moves to introduce our witness. ...Fool Bright.Fulbright:You got it, Prosecutor Blackquill! In justice we trust! One brave lady whose fine sense of justice compelled her to speak, coming right up!DePlume:How dare you make me wait? Don't you know I'm a busy woman?! I could have written an entire book for all the time I spent in that lobby!Judge:Um... Prosecutor Blackquill?Blackquill:............Well?DePlume:I am Norma DePlume, and I'm a nonfiction writer.Phoenix:(Am I the only one who isn't telepathic here?)Athena:Looks like she can read into people's words just as well as I can read into people's hearts.Phoenix:Not everything needs to be a competition, Athena...Judge:What?! Norma DePlume?! The great nonfiction writer, Ms. Norma DePlume herself?! I've read all of your works and enjoyed them immensely. Your million seller, \"The Great Grief of the Great Thief,\" is one of my favorites.DePlume:Oh, are you a fan, Your Honor? I could give you my autograph, if you'd like.Judge:Wait a second... I could swear you looked much different in the photos in your book......DePlume:Well, I use ones from ten years ago in my books so that paparazzi won't harass me.Judge:...!Athena:The judge seems so shocked.Phoenix:The visual disconnect must really be doing a number on His Honor's head...DePlume:Could we get started, please? If I find you to be lacking as a judge... ...you will see your debut in my books!Judge:Such harsh comments...! You really MUST be the real Norma DePlume.Phoenix:(Who knew Ms. DePlume was so famous?)Blackquill:Enough jabbering. Tell the court what you saw, and keep it brief.DePlume:I would thank you to not order me around. I am perfectly willing to tell everyone what I witnessed. It was the moment of the murder!Judge:...Very well, then. Please proceed with your testimony.Witness Testimony-- The Moment of the Murder --DePlume:I went to Shipshape Aquarium to see the killer whale.As I was watching the killer whale from the visitor's corridor, it suddenly went crazy!I saw the killer whale bite the victim to death with its huge mouth and deadly teeth!Attempting to remain calm, I reported the incident to the police immediately.Judge:The adorable defendant really did all that?! Hmm... It must be much more vicious than it looks...Blackquill:Now, deliver your judgment so I may carry out the sentence.Phoenix:Phoenix:Umm... the defense would like to do some defending first, if that's all right...Blackquill:Hmph... Must you drag this out with your tomfoolery?Athena:Athena:The defense always has the right to cross-examine the witness, you know!Blackquill:A fellow inmate told me just this morning... \"If you want something signed, all you need is the document and a witness.\"Phoenix:...Let me guess. They were convicted for contract fraud, right?Blackquill:............ All we need in this case is the evidence and a witness to convict. It's as simple as that.Phoenix:(Looks like I guessed right.) Sorry, but as Ms. Cykes said... ...the defense has every right to cross-examine. Isn't that correct, Your Honor?Judge:Yes, of course. You may proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Blackquill:.........I shall relish the sight of you thrashing around in vain.Cross Examination-- The Moment of the Murder --DePlume:I went to Shipshape Aquarium to see the killer whale.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Why did you want to see the orca?DePlume:Well, it IS the featured attraction of the aquarium, after all.Blackquill:Hmph. Why waste energy on such tripe? There is but one attraction in Shipshape Aquarium that is worth anyone's time... ...and that is the penguins. Isn't that right, Taka, my friend?Phoenix:(All righty then. I guess Prosecutor Blackquill is for the birds.)Athena:Guess I should jot that down. Note to self: Prosecutor Blackquill is on Team Rifle.Judge:And so you went to see the orca in its tank?DePlume:Yes, that's right.DePlume:As I was watching the killer whale from the visitor's corridor, it suddenly went crazy!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:The orca suddenly went crazy, did she?DePlume:Yes. It took a look at me, and then, all at once, it started going berserk!Phoenix:Did you do anything to make her angry?DePlume:I did nothing more than simply glare at it from the visitor's corridor!Phoenix:(She glared at Orla?) And that's what caused her to go berserk?Blackquill:Blackquill:The reason the defendant went mad is not the issue here. Only what she did once she entered that state.DePlume:In any case, the killer whale began behaving wildly in front of my very eyes. And then...DePlume:I saw the killer whale bite the victim to death with its huge mouth and deadly teeth!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So you're saying you saw the very moment of the victim's death?DePlume:That is exactly what I'm saying! Oh, it was simply dreadful! It was as frightening as losing one's manuscript just before a deadline!Phoenix:(I suppose for a writer, that would be pretty terrifying...)DePlume:I witnessed the killer whale's horrific act, and I knew I had to do something, so...Present Shipley's Autopsy ReportPhoenix:Leads to:\"It would seem that you are mistaken, Ms. DePlume.\"DePlume:Attempting to remain calm, I reported the incident to the police immediately.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Why were the police the first ones you contacted?DePlume:I was afraid if I told aquarium staff, they might try to cover it up. Of course, I immediately told aquarium security after my call to the police. I believe I deserve praise for my swift decision-making skills under pressure!Phoenix:...Ms. DePlume is the most assertive witness I've ever seen.Athena:We'd better do our best to look like big-shot lawyers if we want to match her intensity!Phoenix:Ms. DePlume, I praise your swift decision-making skills under pressure!Athena:That was more \"kiss up\" than \"big shot\"...Judge:I suppose it was unrealistic to expect \"big shot\" from Mr. Wright...Blackquill:Hmph. How fitting for a small fry to praise a big shot.Phoenix:(How about cutting this small fry some slack, you big meanies?)Phoenix:(The important thing here is, did she really see the \"moment of the murder\"?)Athena:You're raring to go, aren't you, Mr. Wright? I see it in your eyes... and in your heart!Phoenix:Ha ha ha. I guess I really am a lawyer at heart.Phoenix:It would seem that you are mistaken, Ms. DePlume.DePlume:I beg your pardon?!Phoenix:The autopsy report does indeed say, \"Death thought to be result of orca attack\"... ...but the actual cause of death is \"contusion from head trauma,\" not \"being bitten\"!DePlume:What?! B-But...! But... I'm sure the victim was bitten!Phoenix:I don't believe that can be true. The security footage doesn't show anything of the kind.Blackquill:Blackquill:Hmph............ Just as I suspected. I knew you would peek at the footage behind Fool Bright's back.Phoenix:(Well, what did you expect when he wouldn't play nice and share?)Blackquill:But, unfortunately for you... ...the footage you saw was only one small part.Phoenix:Huh?Blackquill:Yesterday, after I decided to take this case to trial, I re-reviewed all of the evidence. Taka, the evidence I gave to you for safekeeping.Taka:Screech!Phoenix:(Guess that hawk is higher up on the pecking order than Fulbright in Blackquill's book.)Judge:Hmm... Very well. Let's view the footage. Wh-What's this?! The orca is biting the victim!Phoenix:N-No waaaaaay!Judge:I have to say that this appears to be very damning evidence.Security Footage updated in the Court Record.Athena:No... I can't believe Orla really bit him!Blackquill:And there is more... Look at this. This photograph was taken while the body was being examined.Judge:Hmm... There seems to be a strange bruise on the victim's right wrist.Blackquill:I'll have the crime lab examine the bruise and calculate its relevance to the case at hand. What's important right now is evidence that points to the orca as the killer. Look at the left side of the body. See the orca's tooth marks in the victim's clothes?Judge:Yes! They do appear to suggest that she did, in fact, bite the victim.Phoenix:...!Photo of the Body updated in the Court Record.DePlume:I told you so! And then the killer whale swam up toward the surface with the victim in its mouth!Phoenix:Phoenix:H-However! In the autopsy report, the cause of death is \"contusion from head trauma\"!Blackquill:Blackquill:You are much too impetuous, Wright-dono. Granted, the orca biting the victim was not the cause of death. The witness was mistaken about that.Judge:Then what explanation is there for what the witness saw?!Blackquill:Did I not say in the beginning, \"The orca toyed with the victim mercilessly\"?Judge:M-My goodness!Blackquill:After killing the victim, the defendant swam around with his dead body in her mouth. Just like any other predator toying with its prey!Phoenix:(Nrgh...!)Athena:M-Mr. Wright! The hearts of the people in the gallery are suddenly filled with fear -- fear of Orla!Judge:So the defendant bit the victim after she had killed him... But if that's the case, then we must still figure out how the defendant killed the victim. Prosecutor Blackquill, do you have a sound theory to give to this court?Blackquill:I wouldn't be standing here if I couldn't prove whether the orca's heart was black or white.Athena:But Orla is black AND white! ...Her body, I mean.Phoenix:Athena, please try not to provoke Prosecutor Blackquill.Blackquill:The witness also observed the actual moment of the murder. Think back, Word Mistress. Think back to what you observed before the orca bit the victim.DePlume:...Ah, I see what you're driving at. So that was the true moment of the murder, was it?Blackquill:Now, explain it in a way that even these simpletons can understand.DePlume:There you go again, ordering me around! Stop that this instant! But whatever... I don't mind telling my story. I saw the killer whale before it toyed with the body as well. I saw it the moment it killed the victim by head-butting him!Phoenix:O-Orla killed the victim by head-butting him?!DePlume:That's right. It rammed the victim over and over again.Blackquill:Recall that the autopsy report stated that there were bruises all over his body. Recall as well, how persistent the defendant can be when she's attacking her prey.DePlume:And we all just saw the killer whale head-butting the victim in the footage, don't forget.Phoenix:(Hmm... That footage backs up Ms. DePlume's testimony... But there's also something very important it does NOT show...!)DePlume:Now do you see what a menace this killer whale is?Phoenix:Phoenix:I'm sorry, but I can't allow your testimony to stand unchallenged. Looking at this footage, the orca certainly seems to be head-butting something... ...but you'll note that the \"something\" is not the victim!DePlume:Oh! ...Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!Phoenix:(I want to look away... but I can't...) Even if it was the victim, you couldn't have seen him from where you were, could you?DePlume:............What? O-Oh. Well... I suppose not...Phoenix:Ms. DePlume, did you actually witness the victim getting head-butted by the defendant?DePlume:Ah, let's see... Oh, I remember now! As I recall, a rock in the shape of a skull was obstructing my view.Judge:So are you admitting that you couldn't see the victim?DePlume:Yes... Yes, I suppose I am. However! Immediately after the head-butting, the victim came floating up! He came up from behind the skull-shaped rock, and his body was all limp. What else could I think except that the killer whale was head-butting the victim?!Phoenix:Phoenix:But if you didn't actually see the moment of attack itself, then it's pure conjecture!Blackquill:Blackquill:*sigh* Must I do everything around here?DePlume:H-How dare you speak so rudely to me?!Blackquill:There's no need for hysterics. Clear your mind and recall how you reached your conclusion. Though you couldn't see what the orca was attacking, you didn't need to, did you? Because you knew she was behaving exactly as she had only one year prior.DePlume:Oh!Phoenix:(One year ago...?)DePlume:That's right! Yes, that's it! That's how I knew the killer whale was head-butting the victim!Phoenix:I'm sorry, but could someone explain exactly what happened a year ago?Blackquill:If you must know, a very similar incident occurred only last year, in which... ...the defendant murdered her trainer.Judge:Wh-Whaaaaaaat?! The orca murdered her trainer, you say?!Phoenix:What?! Is this really true?! (This is not looking good for us!)Blackquill:It's all in this book.Judge:That book... \"The Killer Killer Whale\"...! That's Ms. DePlume's latest work! I was just thinking of picking that up.\"The Killer Killer Whale\" added to the Court Record.Blackquill:Last year, the defendant killed her trainer in the middle of a show. The orca head-butted and bit the victim.Phoenix:(The same thing she's accused of in this case!)Woman:That orca killed two people?!Man:That thing is a menace! Guilty! Guilty, I say!Man:I never want to go to the beach again!Athena:No! Now everyone's even more convinced that Orla did it!Phoenix:(We were doing so well, but now... Now everyone in the room has a bad impression of Orla. I don't want to think she did it... ...but it's hard to keep on believing in somebody who can't even tell me her side...)Orla:Fwee, fweet?Buckler:Phoenix! Athena! You gotta believe in Orla! There's no way she killed anybody! You gotta save her! Please, I'm begging you!Phoenix:Sasha... (What am I doing, doubting my client like this? This is the time to be strong!)Athena:I believe in Orla! And I'm ready to fight for our clients! I'll take everybody in this courtroom on if I have to!Phoenix:Don't you worry, Sasha. We won't give up on Orla. We'll defend her to the very end!Buckler:Thank you! Thank you, both of you!Orla:Fweet, fweet!Phoenix:(We are Orla's lawyers. Who else but us can save her?! We can't give up on her now!)Blackquill:Hmph... For an instant there, you were afraid of the orca, weren't you, Wright-dono. When you saw the photograph of the victim from a year ago, you turned paler than me.Phoenix:! (He saw right through me!)Blackquill:It's obvious you have neither the guts nor the determination to defend the orca.Phoenix:It's true that Orla can't speak, and I don't know her thoughts... ...but there's a certain someone who believes in Orla with all her heart. I respect the trust she has in Orla, so I'm willing to believe in Orla, too.Blackquill:Hmph. And what do you know about orcas? Nothing, that's what. So, allow me to fill you in. Do you have any idea why orcas are also called \"killer whales\"? Because they are cunning and merciless predators that hunt and kill even true whales.Judges:So \"killer whales\" really are \"killers\"! What terrifying creatures indeed...Blackquill:I can't bear to hear any more of such rubbish as \"trusting a killer.\" Can you, Your Baldness?Phoenix:No matter what you say, I will continue to believe. I don't give up that easily, you know.Blackquill:............Dullard. You don't know when to give up, do you? Very well. I shall give you a chance to prove just how determined you are. Witness, spare no quarter and lay the full truth on them.DePlume:Oh ho ho! But of course! That is what I do, after all.Judge:Prosecutor Blackquill, what will you have the witness testify about?Blackquill:I shall have her testify about what she saw, and what she heard.Phoenix:What she heard...?Judge:Very well. Ms. DePlume, please tell the court what you saw and what you heard.Witness Testimony-- What I Saw and What I Heard --DePlume:The killer whale's behavior was exactly the same as a year ago.As I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing.I was calm when I saw it start to head-butt.But when the pirate hat and victim came floating up, I let out a scream!Judge:Hmm... So the orca displayed the same behavior as during the incident a year ago...DePlume:That's right! Those weren't just simple cries. It was singing! As I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing! It kept head-butting while it sang the Swashbuckler Spectacular song! That's right. It was singing the same song it sang in the aquarium's stage show back then. It was singing while it was head-butting! Oh, it was perfectly horrible!Phoenix:(Hmm... I don't see a single obvious inconsistency in this testimony. It's clear I won't be able to take her apart her statements with evidence alone.)Athena:Mr. Wright! Now would be a good time for me to put my skills to work! It's time to show what analytical psychology can really do!Phoenix:You seem pretty confident. Let me guess. You noticed a contradiction between the testimony and her emotions?Athena:You bet I did! And once we expose it, we just might be able to crack her. No, scratch that. Make it, \"we'll definitely be able to\"!Phoenix:Then let's give your knowledge of analytical psychology a try!Athena:You got it, Boss! A complete analysis of Ms. DePlume's heart, coming right up!DePlume:The killer whale's behavior was exactly the same as a year ago.DePlume:As I approached the pool...DePlume:...the killer whale suddenly started singing.DePlume:I was calm when I saw it start to head-butt.Pinpoint Sad markerPhoenix:Leads to:\"Ms. DePlume, Orla really frightened you with her head-butting, didn't she?\"DePlume:But when the pirate hat and victim came floating up, I let out a scream!Athena:Do you see any emotions that seem odd or out of place? Pay attention to not only which emotions you see, but how strong they are, too. An emotion might suddenly get stronger, for example, or you might see it grow weaker.Phoenix:(Okay. Let me listen to her testimony again.)Phoenix:Ms. DePlume, Orla really frightened you with her head-butting, didn't she?DePlume:Don't be absurd! I certainly was NOT frightened by the likes of any killer whale!Athena:It must've been something else that scared her, then, Boss.DePlume:However... I do remember being very afraid for some reason while it was doing that.Athena:It sounds like maybe you saw something we haven't discussed yet. Take your time and try to remember what it was... What did you see?Phoenix:(This is practically turning into a counseling session.)DePlume:............ I... saw something...? ...Oh! Aaaaaaaaaaaagh! I-I remember now!NOISE LEVEL50%Athena:Okay, good! Now, if you could please tell the court what you saw!DePlume:I saw... I saw... I saw... bright red blood! The killer whale's ramming caused the victim to bleed. There was a great cloud of blood!Phoenix:WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!DePlume:Yes, that's it! That's why I was so sure! That's when I knew that killer whale had killed a person for a second time!Judge:Well! That was a very compelling statement indeed. Looking at this again, there does appear to be something that could be a cloud of blood.Phoenix:(So her terror was a reaction to blood, was it? That would certainly explain what happened yesterday...)Phoenix:Please take a look at this bloodstained coin.DePlume:Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! C-Cease and desist, at once! Wh-What kind of man shows a lady blood?Phoenix:Urk. (She doesn't have to get so worked up...)DePlume:I was badly injured during an interview once. Ever since then, I've been terrified of blood. The very sight of it dreadfully upsets my delicate sensibilities.Phoenix:(This is a bad turn... If Ms. DePlume saw blood... ...then does that mean Orla really did attack the victim...?)Blackquill:It would appear that orcas are even more vicious than I am. So, how does it feel to be thoroughly rammed by your own cross-examination, Wright-dono?Athena:Wh-What do we do now, Boss?!Phoenix:Argh... That testimony was not at all what I expected to hear...Athena:Wait a minute... There's still some discord left in Ms. DePlume's heart.Phoenix:What? You mean there's more?Athena:Yes, but there's no telling what it is. It could be something even more damaging...Phoenix:(Ugh... Is there even anything left of our case to damage...? Well, whatever it is, we have to face it head-on.) Athena, you believe in Orla, right? If so, there's no reason for us to shy away from the truth.Athena:...Yeah, you're right!Phoenix:I know we can handle the truth, whatever it is, so let's delve a little deeper!Athena:You've got it, Boss!DePlume:The killer whale's behavior was exactly the same as a year ago.DePlume:As I approached the pool...DePlume:...the killer whale suddenly started singing.DePlume:After it started head-butting, I saw that awful blood and was terrified.DePlume:But when the pirate hat and victim came floating up, I let out a scream!Pinpoint Sad markerPhoenix:Leads to:\"Huh? Her fear appears to lessen here at this statement.\"Athena:Do you see any emotions that seem odd or out of place? Pay attention to not only which emotions you see, but how strong they are, too. An emotion might suddenly get stronger, for example, or you might see it grow weaker.Phoenix:(Okay. Let me listen to her testimony again.)Phoenix:(Huh? Her fear appears to lessen here at this statement.) Ms. DePlume, weren't you afraid when you saw the victim with blood coming out of him?DePlume:My, that's a very good question. I was shaken after witnessing a murder, yes, but then... the blood seemed to disappear...Phoenix:Disappear? And why do you suppose that was?DePlume:Simple! It was because of the pirate hat! After the killer whale put the hat on, the cloud of blood disappeared!Phoenix:Phoenix:And how exactly does that work...?DePlume:How should I know?! I'm just telling you what I remember, blue boy!Phoenix:(Wait a minute... From whom was this blood that Ms. DePlume saw actually coming from?)Present Ora Shipley profilePhoenix:Leads to:\"Consider this.\"Present anyone elsePhoenix:Phoenix:Maybe somebody else was bleeding in the orca pool, somebody such as this!Blackquill:Do you see an injury anywhere on that individual?! And when exactly was this individual supposed to have entered the pool?!Judge:I don't think you're ready to play in the deep end just yet, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:I-I'll be right back with some floaties, Your Honor... (Hold on... \"Entered the pool\"...? What if this individual didn't \"enter\" the pool, but was already \"in\" the pool...? Who else was in the pool besides the victim?)Leads back to:\"From whom was this blood that Ms. DePlume saw actually coming from?\"Phoenix:Consider this. Maybe the one who was bleeding wasn't the victim.DePlume:I beg your pardon? What kind of ridiculous nonsense is that? There was no one else in that pool beside the victim!Phoenix:Oh, I wouldn't say there was no one else. It IS an orca pool, after all.Blackquill:What?! Then where is this alleged injury on the defendant?!Phoenix:I'm not sure. But if simply wearing the pirate hat made the blood \"disappear\"... ...then the blood must've been coming from somewhere on Orla's head!DePlume:Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!Blackquill:The orca's head? What are you prattling on about now?!Athena:Please think about it again, Ms. DePlume! Think back to what you really saw!DePlume:Errr... I... That is... Th-The one who was bleeding was not the victim, but the killer whale...? Ngh... I remember now! There wasn't any blood coming from the victim after all!NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYEAthena:We did it! Analytical psychology got us what we needed from her!Phoenix:That was a huge help, Athena. (It was also pretty dicey for a while, though.)Judge:Well! This is a surprise! The blood the witness saw was the defendant's, not the victim's!Phoenix:That is correct. And since there was no blood coming from the victim... ...there's only one thing we can conclude. That what Ms. DePlume witnessed was not the \"moment of the murder,\" as she claims!Blackquill:Blackquill:I thought you were unarmed, but it turns out you were concealing a sword all along. Nevertheless... it is far too dull to cut to the bone.Phoenix:Meaning...?Blackquill:I grant that what the witness saw was not the victim's blood, but it proves nothing. After all, being rammed doesn't always result in a wound that bleeds, does it? Death from internal hemorrhaging is also a possibility.Phoenix:...! (He has a point there.)Blackquill:If you wish to challenge me to a duel, you'll need a sharper blade than that, Wright-dono. I demand evidence that proves the witness did not see the moment of the murder!Phoenix:Ack! (There must be something. Think, Phoenix! If I'm correct, then the victim's death occurred...)Before DePlume saw itLeads to:\"If the victim was already dead when Orla started her head-butting...\"After DePlume saw itPhoenix:(If the victim was alive when Orla started her head-butting... ...then that would basically make Orla the one who killed him. But since I don't think she did it, then we must be wrong about when it took place.)Leads to:\"If the victim was already dead when Orla started her head-butting...\"Phoenix:(If the victim was already dead when Orla started her head-butting... ...then that would mean he died sometime before Ms. DePlume was watching her. The events Ms. DePlume witnessed took place at around 10:10 AM. I must have something that can tell us about what happened before 10:10 AM!)Present Security FootagePhoenix:Leads to:\"We've only seen the footage from 10:09 to 10:10 AM.\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Phoenix:This is the evidence that proves Ms. DePlume did not see the moment of the murder!Athena:Huh? I'm not sure that's really related to what Ms. DePlume did or didn't witness.Phoenix:............But you're not sure, right...?Blackquill:No, we can be quite sure it's unrelated.Judge:Yes, quite.Phoenix:(Ouch. I guess we can be...)Leads back to:\"The events Ms. DePlume witnessed took place at around 10:10 AM.\"Phoenix:(We've only seen the footage from 10:09 to 10:10 AM. Which means... there's still footage going further back that we need to check!) Your Honor, I request that ALL of the security footage be played for the court.Judge:All of the footage?Phoenix:Ms. DePlume witnessed the cloud of blood at around 10:10 AM. But I believe the victim was already dead by that time.Judge:So your assertion is that the murder took place before Ms. DePlume arrived?Phoenix:Exactly. The security camera footage starts at 10:00 AM when the aquarium opened. And I believe there is vital evidence in the ten minutes before!Blackquill:Hmph............ You are quite the gambling man, Wright-dono. Are you honestly willing to risk everything on those mere ten minutes?Phoenix:(I've bet on slimmer chances before, but when he puts it that way...)Athena:Athena:My boss is no coward, Prosecutor Blackquill, so I suggest you get ready to eat humble pie!Phoenix:(Uh-oh. I can't back down now...)Judge:Well, if the defense is that confident in its importance... Prosecutor Blackquill, the security footage.Blackquill:............Fool Bright.Fulbright:Roger! I have the rest of the security footage right here!Judge:Very well. Please play it for the court.Phoenix:(Please, PLEASE have something for me!)Fulbright:This is what it looked like at 10:10 AM. The witness can be seen here. All right. I'll just back the footage up to the beginning now!Judge:Hmm... It appears Ms. DePlume hasn't arrived yet at this point.Phoenix:(Now to see if I can find something from before this point in time!)Judge:............Blackquill:............Phoenix:............ Is that it?Fulbright:Yep! That's all the footage there is!Judge:Well, Mr. Wright? Did you see what you were looking for?Athena:W-We got nothin'...Blackquill:Hmph............ Well, Wright-dono? Those were the ten minutes you placed your bet on. Did you see anything of significance?Phoenix:(...Did I see anything important? I'd better think about this carefully...) In the footage, we see...!Something importantPhoenix:This is the important thing the footage shows!Present anywherePhoenix:Judge:Hmm? And what is so vital about that point, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:Different things are important to different people. \"Importance\" is a subjective thing!Judge:Yes, just as my decision to assign a penalty is a \"subjective thing.\"Phoenix:Urk. (Wait a minute... What if something that SHOULD be in the footage isn't there...?) P-Please wait, Your Honor! Um... That footage...Leads back to:\"In the footage, we see...!\"Nothing importantLeads to:\"We can see nothing of importance in that footage.\"Phoenix:We can see nothing of importance in that footage.Blackquill:Hmph. Just as I thought.Fulbright:Ha ha ha! You're right about that! That section was completely meaningless! It doesn't show a thing. That's why I didn't submit it as evidence!Phoenix:Phoenix:No. It's just the opposite.Fulbright:Huh? What do you mean by that?Phoenix:In this ten minutes of footage, something important that SHOULD be there isn't there! Detective Fulbright, this footage should have been submitted as evidence.Fulbright:What? Are you questioning the way I carry out my duty to justice?!Judge:Mr. Wright! Explain yourself, please! What is this important thing that you say should be in the footage, but isn't?Present Photo of the BodyPhoenix:Leads to:\"The important thing we should see in the footage is the victim himself, Jack Shipley.\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Blackquill:And what is the problem you perceive if that particular object isn't in the footage?Phoenix:There is no problem, which is exactly why it is a problem, right?!Judge:While I admire your enthusiasm, please don't think you can wing it on enthusiasm alone. I would further like to suggest that your attitude is a problem, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:...My apologies, Your Honor. (If the victim was alive, there's something we should see in the footage...) I still content that there is something important that is not in this footage.Judge:If that is your contention, please back it up with evidence.Leads back to:\"What is this important thing that you say should be in the footage, but isn't?\"Phoenix:The important thing we should see in the footage is the victim himself, Jack Shipley. I don't know about you, but I didn't see him get in the pool in that footage.Judge:Oh!Blackquill:............!Fulbright:Aaaaagh! That's right!Phoenix:If the victim is not shown entering the pool in this footage... ...it means that he must have been there by the skull rock during those ten minutes. But no human being can hold their breath underwater for that long.Fulbright:W-Wait a minute... Are you saying...?!Phoenix:When the security camera started up at 10 AM, the victim was already dead!Fulbright:WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Judge:Order! Order in the court! If that's the case, then when was the victim murdered?!Phoenix:I don't know, Your Honor, but we now know it had to have been sometime before 10 AM. Therefore, this footage can no longer be called decisive evidence against my client!Blackquill:Hmph. But there is no one else who could have killed the victim.Phoenix:Not necessarily. The defense believes that the true culprit may have been human. And we have evidence to back up our theory as well!Blackquill:Do you, now? I would be very interested in seeing this evidence.Phoenix:(The defense's trump card -- that thing we found during our investigation yesterday... I wouldn't go so far as to call it \"decisive,\" but... ...now's the time to play it!)Judge:Very well, Mr. Wright. Please submit your evidence. What evidence shows that the crime may have been committed by a human?Present Bloodstained CoinPhoenix:Leads to:\"What's this? A coin...?\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Judge:And that substantiates your claim how...?Athena:What are you doing?! That's not the right piece at all, Boss!Phoenix:...That's what I was just thinking myself, judging by the judge's expression...Judge:Mr. Wright! You will refrain from presenting evidence you're not sure about just to feel me out!Phoenix:(Ugh... I must still be rusty, but this time, I'll present our real trump card!)Judge:Let's try again, Mr. Wright.Leads back to:\"What evidence shows that the crime may have been committed by a human?\"Judge:What's this? A coin...?Phoenix:Yes, a fake coin used in the aquarium's pirate show. We found it beside the pool. This coin is quite possibly the real murder weapon.Judge:This tiny little coin... is the murder weapon? Mr. Wright! If this is another one of your bluffs...!Blackquill:Hmph. As they say, the bolder the presentation, the less confident the solicitor.Phoenix:This is no bluff, and this isn't the only coin. There are three hundred of these coins in all, weighing a total of about seven pounds. (Changed from [There are 300 of these coins all together, weighing a total of about seven pounds.] in the original release) This one just happens to have blood on it.Blackquill:...Did you have the blood analyzed to see whose it is?Phoenix:Not yet... ...but there were coins scattered all around the body, and the victim had a head wound. Taking these things into account, I believe it has to be the victim's blood. So, to put it together, we have about seven pounds of coins by the side of the pool... ...one of them with a bloodstain on it. I think the answer is pretty clear here. Your Honor! The defense proposes that the victim was killed beside the pool!Judge:The side of the pool?! But if the murder took place there, it would be difficult to say the orca did it...DePlume:I realize you are trying to defend your client, but that theory is preposterous! How could three hundred coins possibly be made to hit someone all at once?! (Changed from [How could 300 coins possibly be made to hit someone all at once?!] in the original release)Phoenix:It'd be pretty easy if they were in a bag or something of that nature.Judge:And so where is this bag the coins were in?Phoenix:Unfortunately, Your Honor, we recovered nothing of the sort from the scene. It's possible the culprit took it with them.Judge:They took it...?Phoenix:The true culprit used the coins as a blunt instrument to commit murder. They then threw the body into the pool before the security cameras started up. And then they left, taking the bag the coins were in with them. They got rid of the evidence that points to a human culprit to pin the blame on Orla!Athena:That was brilliant, Mr. Wright! You found a way to introduce the possibility of a human perpetrator!Phoenix:Yeah, somehow... (Let's hope my luck holds out... Hmm... I wonder why Prosecutor Blackquill hasn't said anything...)Judge:The possibility of a perpetrator other than the defendant has now been suggested. But if we hold this possibility to be true, then what did Ms. DePlume witness?DePlume:Th-That's right! I saw the killer whale attack the victim! Just like it did a year ago, singing a song!Athena:Hmm... I guess there still is that... Even with somebody else as the culprit, Orla's behavior still seems pretty bizarre. (Chhanged from [Even with somebody else as the culprit, Orla's behavior still seem [sic] pretty bizarre.] in the original release) I wonder why she was doing the same things she did a year ago? (Changed from [I wonder why did she [sic] was doing the same things she did a year ago?] in the original release)Phoenix:But is it REALLY that bizarre...? (Changed from [But are they REALLY that bizarre...?] in the original release)Athena:What do you mean?Phoenix:To explain the inexplicable, all we have to do is turn our thinking around.Athena:Turn our thinking around, huh? Sounds good to me!Phoenix:(Time to give the ol' \"turn my thinking around\" method a try! Instead of trying to figure out WHY Orla did the same things she did a year ago... ...I should consider the results that were produced by her behavior this time around. Orla sang a song, did some head-butts, and bit the victim. If the real culprit wanted to shift the suspicion onto Orla... ...then they would've needed to give people a reason to think Orla did it in the first place!)Judge:Mr. Wright, as her lawyer, how do you explain your client's actions?Phoenix:I believe we should think of it in this way, Your Honor: What kind of effect did Orla's actions have on the case?Judge:Hmm... Very well. Then why don't you explain it for the court. How did the defendant's actions affect the case?They created a witnessLeads to:\"Ms. DePlume focused her attention on the orca pool because she heard the song.\"They killed the victimPhoenix:The defendant's actions may have killed the victim.Judge:So your assertion is that... the defendant is guilty...?Phoenix:Oh! What?! No...! I retract my statement, Your Honor!Judge:You may retract your statement, but you will first contract a penalty.Phoenix:(Instead of trying to figure out WHY Orla did the same things she did a year ago... ...I should consider what the result was of her doing the same things as a year ago. That's what I have to focus on now!) Your Honor! Please let me try again!Judge:Very well. Please explain to the court...Leads back to:\"How did the defendant's actions affect the case?\"They got rid of evidencePhoenix:The defendant's actions may have gotten rid of evidence!Judge:Hmm... And what evidence might that be, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:Vital evidence that would prove who the true culprit is! ...At least, that is what I hope.Judge:...I am not asking about your hopes and dreams, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:(Instead of trying to figure out WHY Orla did the same things she did a year ago... ...I should consider what the result was of her doing the same things as a year ago. That's what I have to focus on now!) Your Honor! Please let me try again!Judge:Very well. Please explain to the court...Leads back to:\"How did the defendant's actions affect the case?\"Phoenix:Ms. DePlume focused her attention on the orca pool because she heard the song. The orca's act of singing a song created a witness.Judge:Created a witness...?Phoenix:Isn't it possible... ...that fabricating a witness was the real culprit's true intention? After all, Ms. DePlume witnessed two things: She saw Orla head-butt something over and over, and she saw the orca bite the victim. Those two actions of Orla's might have been... ...the true culprit's plot to make the witness think the orca was attacking the victim!Judge:Are you saying... that the defendant was being manipulated by the true perpetrator?!Phoenix:Exactly. And that would explain Orla's actions perfectly.Judge:But the defendant is an orca. Is it even possible to manipulate her?Phoenix:Yes, there is a way to manipulate Orla's behavior, with this!Present WhistlePhoenix:Leads to:\"Is this... a whistle?\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Judge:THAT can be used to manipulate Orla's behavior?Phoenix:...Sure, maybe it could be, if one knew how!Judge:I wish someone would manipulate YOU into presenting relevant evidence, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:M-My apologies, Your Honor... (Hmm... I know I have something that can be used to control Orla's behavior...)Judge:So, Mr. Wright, is it really possible to manipulate Orla's behavior?Leads back to:\"Yes, there is a way to manipulate Orla's behavior, with this!\"Judge:Is this... a whistle?Phoenix:Yes, Your Honor. Trainers at the aquarium use whistles to issues commands to Orla. But in truth, anyone can do it, provided they know the right signals.Judge:Ah, that must be how they get Orla to do tricks for their pirate shows.Phoenix:The true culprit hid the body in a spot that couldn't be seen from the visitor's corridor. Then, when Ms. DePlume appeared, they gave Orla the commands! In other words, Orla was manipulated by the culprit to perform a series of \"tricks\"!DePlume:Wh-Whaaat...?Phoenix:And, as for you, Ms. DePlume... ...you were manipulated by the true culprit to play the part of the witness!DePlume:I-I, Norma DePlume, was set up...?! I, Norma DePlume, writer extraordinaire, was used...? N-No... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Judge:M-Ms. DePlume...! Please do something about your attire!Phoenix:(Ugh... That was one wardrobe malfunction I did NOT want to see...)Judge:I-It would appear we need to shift our suspicion toward someone other than Orla. Prosecutor Blackquill, please have the bloodstained coin analyzed.Blackquill:...Hmph. You waste your breath.Phoenix:(I guess even Prosecutor Blackquill can't refute the possibility of a human suspect.)Athena:You did it, Boss! If the crime happened beside the pool, there's no way an orca could have done it!Phoenix:Now, if only we could find the bag the coins were in...Judge:Hmm... In light of the new discovery, it would appear that the orca couldn't have done it.Phoenix:Exactly, Your Honor. If the blood on the coin proves to be that of the victim... ...we can unequivocally overturn Orla's accusation.Blackquill:Blackquill:Overturn the defendant's accusation...? Hmph. I think not.Phoenix:ACK! (M-My hair! My beautiful hair!)Blackquill:Yesterday, a new inmate was brought into the prison. He said, \"The moment you relax is when you're most vulnerable.\"Judge:Hmm... And what did this man go in for?Blackquill:...He is merely a sneaky thief who enjoys a spot of fishing now and again. But Wright-dono here would be easier to hook than any fish...Taka:Screech!Phoenix:(That hawk sure does love the judge's head.)Judge:What's this? That coin from before and... some sort of bag?Phoenix:A b-bag...? (I don't think I'm gonna like this...)Blackquill:This is the coin bag the three hundred coins were in. (Changed from [This is the coin bag the 300 coins were in.] in the original release) I believe you were looking for this?Phoenix:H-How did you get that?!Blackquill:I never said we didn't find it at the crime scene. The bag had blood on it, so naturally, I had it sent to the crime lab.Phoenix:And... does the blood belong to the victim?Blackquill:It does indeed, as does the blood on the coin.Phoenix:(I knew it! So the blood on the coin DID belong to the victim!)Blackquill:The bag was open and the coins had all spilled out. But the bag alone wasn't proof enough to say that it was used as the murder weapon. ...However, thanks to the defense and their coin, I am more than satisfied that it was.Judge:Prosecutor Blackquill! Are you conceding that the true culprit committed the murder with the bag of coins?Blackquill:I shall concede that the victim was put into the pool after his death. However, even with the bag... ...it doesn't change the fact it was the orca that killed the victim!Phoenix:What?! How can you still suspect Orla?!Blackquill:You said that the true culprit manipulated Orla's behavior. But Orla isn't the kind of orca that would let someone control her. If anything, Orla used the victim's behavior against him to murder him!Phoenix:What?! But--Judge:A-Are you arguing that the orca manipulated a human being?!Blackquill:Hmph... To prove it, I have summoned another witness. Marlon Rimes, take the stand!Phoenix:(M-Marlon Rimes?! Is a witness...?!)Blackquill:...Well, don't just stand there. State your name.Rimes:............I told ya I didn't wanna be a witness.Blackquill:I thought one witness would be quite enough to prove the defendant's guilt... ...but apparently Wright-dono won't be satisfied until every stone is turned.Rimes:Well, son of a... All right, fine! If I gotta talk, then let's get this over with!Athena:Mr. Rimes doesn't seem like a willing witness.Phoenix:(I wonder what Prosecutor Blackquill is going to have him testify about?)Judge:Um... So could we have your name and occupation for the record, witness?Rimes:............ Ahoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! People of da law! Time to testify! Chillin' with my crew at the Shipshape. Orcas, penguins, and da seascape. Cleanin' n' feedin', there ain't no end. But dem bratty kid's tours, I shall transcend. Noob animal keeper, from the house of Rimes! I'm da master keeper, Marlon with the rhymes!Judge:Oh, my... I'm afraid I couldn't understand a word you said! Is that that \"flip-flop\" music young people nowadays like?Phoenix:(...So close, Your Honor, so close... and yet so far.)Judge:Please proceed with your testimony, witness. Without the flip-flop.Rimes:Okay, fine. But I don't wanna do this, I tell ya. I feel like I'm sellin' Sasha out.Witness Testimony-- The Man-Manipulating Orca --Rimes:At about 10:10 AM, I was in the staff room.I heard a loud noise from the pool room, so I went to the door to look in.I couldn't see the captain or the orca, but I saw a bunch of coins scattered around.The orca knows there's a certain spot people stand to play volleyball with her.I think maybe she knocked down the stuff that was piled up there and hit the captain.Phoenix:(Hmm... So that gives us a little more info about the area around the orca pool.)Orca Pool Diagram updated in the Court Record.Phoenix:The defendant made the stuff fall down...?Blackquill:Overturned crates and assorted props were scattered all over the pool room floor. There is no doubt that it was the orca that caused the mess.Judge:But could she really have done that from within the pool?Blackquill:Hmph. As I said, the orca is the only one that could've performed such a feat. (Changed from [Hmph. As I said, the orca is the only one that could've perform [sic] such a feat.] in the original release) The pool and its room were tidied the night before, including its various odds and ends. But when our rhyming marlin took a look-see, over four hundred pounds of props had fallen. (Changed from [But when our rhyming marlin checked on the scene, over 400 pounds of props had fallen.] in the original release) To move it all in one go would challenge even the brawny prisoner in the cell next to mine.Phoenix:(...What is he? The jail gossip?)Blackquill:So, how did 400 pounds of items fall all at once? I'll tell you how. The orca pulled on the cloth that was underneath them. A weight that would be all but impossible for a human to move... ...was child's play to an orca. During a friendly game of volleyball, the defendant made the crates fall... ...and the bag of coins that was among the items fell on the victim's head and killed him! The orca then toyed with the victim's body underwater, which is what Ms. DePlume saw.Phoenix:Phoenix:But the witness only said he \"heard a loud noise.\" That doesn't automatically make it the sound of Orla making the items fall! Also, why did you only \"look in\" on the pool room, anyway, Mr. Rimes?Rimes:That orca sometimes makes a loud noise to summon her trainer. But I'm still a newbie, so I don't have a security card to get into the pool room yet. So even if she tries to summon somebody, there isn't much I can do about it.Judge:I see. So the witness couldn't enter the crime scene...Phoenix:Phoenix:If Mr. Rimes couldn't enter the room, there's at least one thing he can't be sure about! His statement that the orca was playing volleyball is purely speculation!Blackquill:Blackquill:Whether the orca was actually playing volleyball or not is not the issue. Traces of the orca's saliva were found on the cloth that was underneath the crates. The important point is that the orca is the only one that could have moved the items!Phoenix:(Argh! I have to discredit that statement somehow! If I don't, it'd mean that Orla was the culprit, even if the victim died beside the pool!)Cross Examination-- The Man-Manipulating Orca --Rimes:At about 10:10 AM, I was in the staff room.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you sure about the time you were in the staff room?Rimes:What?! Y-Yes, I'm sure! I'm pretty good with time. I've never been late to work once.Phoenix:(Hmm... If he's sure about the time, then there's something wrong with that statement. I'd better take another look through the Court Record...)Judge:All right. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Rimes.Present CalendarPhoenix:Leads to:\"You say you were in the staff room...\"Rimes:I heard a loud noise from the pool room, so I went to the door to look in.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You heard the noise all the way in the staff room?Rimes:That's right. The orca pool room and the staff room are pretty close to each other. Anyway, I heard the noise, so I went to the door of the pool room. But I don't have a security card, so all I could do was look through the door crack.Phoenix:What kind of noise did you hear?Rimes:Want me to describe it? Awww yiiiiis! Yo word up Courtroom Numbah Fouuuuurrr! Da crash, boom, bowing to relativity! Everything fallin' with sweet simplicity! This testimony yo, it ain't got no fallacies! Things fallin' n' breakin', was pure insanity! ...Kinda like that.Phoenix:(Okay... But why the need to rap it...?)Judge:Well, I didn't really get all of that, but, in any case, I gather it was a very loud noise... Very well. Please describe what you saw at the scene.Rimes:I couldn't see the captain or the orca, but I saw a bunch of coins scattered around.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You couldn't see the victim?Rimes:I was just lookin' through the door crack. I guess all that stuff was blockin' my view. I did notice a whole bunch of coins scattered all over the place, though... But, at the time, I had no idea the captain was dead.Blackquill:Hmph... Killed by gold coins. Ironic, isn't it? Perhaps the orca wanted to be paid for her labor, paid in coins raining from the skies.Athena:Coins raining from the skies? He makes it sound... almost poetic.Phoenix:But the hard truth is that those coins were actually the murder weapon...Blackquill:We all deserve to be paid for our work, do we not? I shall have a fine meal tonight...Phoenix:If you find our client guilty, that is. Mr. Rimes, do you have a theory on how the things got knocked down?Rimes:Of course I do.Rimes:The orca knows there's a certain spot people stand to play volleyball with her.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:She uses this ball and does a spike, right? We had a nice little demonstration of Orla's spike for ourselves just yesterday.Rimes:If you stand on the mark on the floor, the orca spikes the ball at you.Blackquill:Hmph. Taka is good at flying straight at his target as well. And I see plenty of targets right here in this room.Judge:?Phoenix:?Rimes:?Athena:Everyone's so busy protecting their head, they forgot about the trial...Phoenix:Including you.Blackquill:Tell them what the defendant caused to happen.Rimes:Well, the orca knows people stand in a certain spot for volleyball...Rimes:I think maybe she knocked down the stuff that was piled up there and hit the captain.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you saying you think she knocked down the items on purpose?Rimes:I don't wanna believe it, myself, but that orca's pretty smart... It'd be easy for her to pull the cloth the stuff was on while she was playin' volleyball. Orcas are really strong. One good pull and all those things would come crashin' down.Phoenix:(I guess maybe an orca could be strong enough to make that much stuff fall...)Blackquill:I've never seen an orca play tug of war, myself. But the fact is, this one did. The traces of the orca's saliva found on the cloth prove it. How long do you plan to walk tightrope on those shaky theories of yours?Phoenix:(Wait until you see me do acrobatics! Moments like these are what I became a lawyer again for!)Phoenix:(I don't know why, but Mr. Rimes is lying. I'm afraid I have to expose that secret he and Pearls were keeping to resolve this...)Phoenix:You say you were in the staff room, but is that really true?Rimes:Of course it's true. Why would I lie about a thing like that?Phoenix:Mr. Rimes, have you ever seen this calendar before?Rimes:Hey! That's...!Phoenix:I see you recognize it.Rimes:Yeah, that's the Rifle calendar. It's a big hit at the Shipshape Aquarium gift shop. Thank you for shoppin' at Shipshape!Judge:Mr. Rimes! Please refrain from scattering fish around the witness stand!Blackquill:...Not to worry, Your Baldness. Taka will have them cleaned up in no time.Taka:Screech!Phoenix:(...I guess that bird comes in handy now and then.)Judge:All right, Mr. Wright. We have all seen your cute souvenir. Now, if you wouldn't mind...Phoenix:Uh, no, Your Honor! This isn't my calendar. It was originally the witness's, but it came into the possession of a certain young lady.Rimes:Wh-What?!Phoenix:Mr. Rimes and this young lady first met each other in the food prep room. After a mishap, their calendars got switched around. They ran into each other at about 10:10 AM in the food prep room. So clearly, the witness was not in the staff room. In other words, there's no way he could have heard the noise in the pool room upstairs!Rimes:Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!Blackquill:What's this?! This is the first I'm hearing about any calendar!Phoenix:(That's because Mr. Rimes and Pearls were keeping it a secret.)Blackquill:You lied to ME?! This transgression will not go unpunished!Rimes:Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!Judge:So, Mr. Rimes, you didn't hear the noise of the equipment falling after all, did you?Rimes:...Okay. I admit it. I didn't hear the noise in the orca pool room, myself. But somebody told me about it.Phoenix:Who told you about it?Rimes:............It was... uh...Phoenix:Unless you tell the truth, Mr. Rimes, I can't save Orla. And I'm sure you know how sad that would make Ms. Buckler.Rimes:............ ............I heard about it... from Sasha.Phoenix:What?! From Ms. Buckler?!Athena:B-But that doesn't make sense!Phoenix:(What is going on here?)Blackquill:Hmph... Now it's the trainer's own words that drive the orca into a corner. How do you like being bitten by your own client, Wright-dono?!Phoenix:(Ugh! I certainly didn't see this coming!)Blackquill:What perfect timing. There was something I wanted to ask Ms. Buckler about the orca. The prosecution calls the trainer, Ms. Sasha Buckler, to the stand!Judge:Yes, I suppose it would be a good idea to hear what the orca's trainer has to say.Phoenix:(I don't know what Sasha is going to say... ...but I'll just have to meet it head-on, whatever it is!)Judge:We will take a twenty minute recess while the witness is summoned.To be continuedJuly 21, 10:39 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3Athena:Mr. Wright... are you going to cross-examine Sasha?Phoenix:I guess I'll have to ask her about the noise from the stuff falling down.Rimes:Mr. Wright...Phoenix:Mr. Rimes, why did you lie?Rimes:I... I didn't want Sasha to have to appear in court. I thought if anybody had to testify, I should be the one to do it for her.Athena:But why would you go to all those lengths...?Rimes:............ Did you see the entry for the twentieth on that calendar?Phoenix:The note about meeting the captain at the orca pool?Rimes:Yeah. I found that calendar in the nap room. I think it's probably Sasha's.Athena:What?! Then that means...!Phoenix:(I guess it does look like more of a woman's calendar than a man's...)Calendar updated in the Court Record.Rimes:I didn't want suspicion to fall on Sasha... Mr. Wright... I gotta go back to the aquarium to look after the orca in Sasha's place. I'll be rootin' for ya on the other end of that TV phone. Please take care of Sasha...Athena:Okay! We can't let Prosecutor Blackquill get the best of us! Time to refocus!Phoenix:You're right. After all, we're the only ones who can save Orla.July 21, 11:02 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4Judge:The court will now reconvene. Prosecutor Blackquill, please call the witness to the stand.Blackquill:............Again, you waste your breath.Buckler:Me name be Sasha! And I be one of Cap'n Orla's Swashbucklers! I come to rescue me bucko from the false charges put on her by Dread Pirate Nostache!Blackquill:............\"Nostache\"...?Athena:I guess \"Nostache\" refers to Prosecutor Blackquill this time.Phoenix:...Well, it can't be the judge. He HAS a mustache... and a full beard.Buckler:Now then, Cap'n Judge... shall we begin the pirate court?!Judge:\"C-Cap'n Judge\"...! Hmm... I rather like that. It makes me feel like a salty old sea dog.Buckler:And scene! How was that for a self-intro?Blackquill:............The court is not a show. State your full name and occupation.Buckler:I'm Sasha Buckler. I work at Shipshape Aquarium. I perform in our Swashbuckler Spectacular pirate show alongside Orla, as her trainer.Judge:Well! You seem like a completely different person now.Buckler:You r-EEL-y think so? Thanks! I was in my pirate show persona just then! Prosecutor Blackquill said I could introduce myself any way I like.Phoenix:(I'd bet money he didn't think you were going to do it like THAT...)Judge:And what will this witness testify about?Blackquill:The orca manipulated the victim into playing volleyball and then knocked the items down. The witness will report about hearing the noise that caused the victim's death.Buckler:Now wait just a minute! Sure, Orla uses the ball to break props sometimes... She even spiked the ball at the giant octopus's leg yesterday when I was cleaning.Phoenix:(...So Orla was the one who broke that leg, huh?)Buckler:But she couldn't have knocked down that huge stack of equipment with her little ball!Blackquill:Hmph. I thought you were paying attention to the trial over the telecast... ...but you apparently know nothing of what we have been discussing. The orca knocked down the equipment by pulling on the cloth that was underneath it. No one said anything about the orca knocking it down with a ball!Buckler:Whaaaaaat?! I-Is THAT what we're talking about?! Ngh... I came in here to give Prosecutor Nostache a good keelhauling... ...but I'm the one getting the cat-o'-nine-tails! Ooh, he's as vicious as a tiger shark!Athena:Ms. Buckler! Just focus on your testimony and you'll be all right! Don't worry. We'll take care of that tiger shark for you!Buckler:Thank you, Athena! Okay, I can do this! My testimony will be fin-omenal!Judge:All right, Ms. Buckler. Please proceed with your testimony.Witness Testimony-- Hearing the Noise --Buckler:I admit I heard Orla summoning me with a loud noise.But the aquarium guest's scream I heard over the walkie-talkie was more urgent.I talked to Norma DePlume first and then went to the pool room with the security guard.The equipment was everywhere, and... the captain was lying in the middle of it all.Judge:Hmm... Her story doesn't seem to be much different from Marlon Rimes's testimony.Phoenix:Or does it...? The circumstances are different. The actual order of Orla's actions depend on the order the witness heard the two noises. If she heard the scream first, the prosecution's claims don't stand up!Blackquill:Blackquill:Hmph. Unfortunately for you, she doesn't remember the order of what she heard.Phoenix:............Sh-She doesn't...?Buckler:I was distracted at the time... so I don't really recall which one I heard first... I was lost in thought until the guard brought me back to myself... Sorry I'm no help.Blackquill:As long as the order remains unclear, I shall not alter the prosecution's claims. After killing the victim with the bag of coins, the orca toyed with the body in the water.Phoenix:(I have to turn things around here somehow! Unless I can prove the sound Sasha heard was NOT the sound of the victim's murder... ...Blackquill's claim that Orla pulled down the equipment to kill the victim will stand. If I want to save Orla, I have to find a contradiction, no matter how small!)Judge:Very well. Your cross-examination, please, Mr. Wright.Cross Examination-- Hearing the Noise --Buckler:I admit I heard Orla summoning me with a loud noise.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What made you think Orla was summoning you?Buckler:Orla knows the sound of her cries doesn't carry far enough. So sometimes she summons people by making a loud noise. Heh heh. That Orla is smarter than the average whale, I tell you!Blackquill:Hmph. Taka would not be bested in a battle of wits.Athena:Athena:Wait a minute! Widget is the smartest one of all!Widget:Mirror, mirror, on the wall. Who's the smartest one of all? Widget!Phoenix:(Am I expected to enter Trucy into this \"my kid is better than yours\"-apalooza...?) And did you heed the summons of this very intelligent Orla immediately?Buckler:I couldn't right away, although I was concerned about her, of course.Buckler:But the aquarium guest's scream I heard over the walkie-talkie was more urgent.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You heard Ms. DePlume scream?Buckler:That's right. I heard her through the walkie-talkie of a guard making his rounds. \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!\" I can still hear it in my head. It was so loud, I thought it was a sea lion.Phoenix:Ms. DePlume sort of reminds me of a sea lion, actually.Athena:I know, right? Ooh, I should call her \"sea lion lady\" and see how she likes it!Phoenix:(I guess Athena is still upset about being called \"yellow girl.\")Judge:What did you do after hearing the visitor's scream?Buckler:I talked to Norma DePlume first and then went to the pool room with the security guard.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You and the security guard headed to the orca pool room?Buckler:Yeah. Apparently, that obnoxious writer lady said she didn't trust me by myself. That's why, after talking to her, the guard and I went to the pool room together. Why the wench be so suspicious?! Arrrrr! I demand a swordfish duel! That's what I felt like saying to her, anyway.Judge:............I'm afraid I don't get it.Athena:That was a line from the show when Orla and Sasha quarrel with each other! Didn't you do your Swashbuckler Spectacular homework, Your Honor?Judge:Why am I getting scolded, Mr. Wright?!Phoenix:And why am I getting scolded here, Your Honor...? Ms. Buckler, please tell me what happened after you headed to the pool room.Buckler:All right. When the guard and I got there, we saw that...Buckler:The equipment was everywhere, and... the captain was lying in the middle of it all.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What do you recall about the scene exactly?Buckler:I don't remember much, to be honest... I was in total shock from seeing the captain like that. If you ask me something specific, I might be able to remember, though.Phoenix:(Specific questions, huh? Okay, let's see. What should I ask her about?)The things scattered aroundPhoenix:Could you tell me more about the things that were scattered around?Buckler:They were equipment and props for the new show.Phoenix:The new show?Buckler:Yeah. We were supposed to debut a brand-new Swashbuckler Spectacular yesterday. We already defeated the giant octopus and Nostache, after all. We were going to have a new nemesis, Redstache. He's on the flyer.Athena:Oh! That's the flyer Rifle was distributing! \"Who will obtain the gold coins hidden in the skull rock?!\" Ooh, I wish it could be me!Buckler:Leave it to you, Athena, to know all about it! Orla's even got some new tricks for the new show.Swashbuckler Flyer updated in the Court Record.Phoenix:So all the stuff that fell down was for the new show, is that it?Buckler:That's right. A bunch of props in crates and other equipment, stacked up.Phoenix:Your Honor, for the record, I'd like that information added to the witness's testimony.Judge:Very well. Ms. Buckler, please append what you just said to your testimony.Buckler:Sure thing!Changes statement from \"The equipment was everywhere, and... the captain was lying in the middle of it all.\" to \"The props for the new show were everywhere, and... the captain was in the middle of it all.\"Jack ShipleyPhoenix:Could you tell me more about the state you found the victim in?Buckler:It's so hard to even think about right now...Athena:Sasha is deeply traumatized by the victim's death...Phoenix:I guess I shouldn't push her on it, then. (Poor Sasha... She must've really adored him.)Leads back to cross-examinationBuckler:The props for the new show were everywhere, and... the captain was in the middle of it all.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:These props for the new show... What kind of things were they?Buckler:A blow-up dolphin and anchor, Redstache's costume, the bag of coins... Stuff like that. The captain was wearing his usual costume, and the new props were all there.Phoenix:(Wait a minute... Something about that doesn't seem right... (Changed from [What [sic] a minute... Something about that doesn't seem right...] in the original release) Is there a problem with Sasha's testimony?)No, no problemPhoenix:(I guess there isn't any particular problem. I'd better get on with the cross-examination.)Leads back to cross-examinationYes, there isLeads to:\"You say the captain was wearing his \"usual costume,\" but is that completely accurate?\"Athena:Do you think Orla really did make that stuff fall down?Phoenix:I think we probably need more information before we can know what really happened. Let's be careful not to let a single inconsistency slip by us.Phoenix:You say you the captain was wearing his \"usual costume,\" but is that completely accurate?Buckler:Come on, Phoenix! What are you nitpicking my testimony for?!Phoenix:If we look at the body, we see that there's a discrepancy between that and your statement. You stated that the victim was wearing his usual costume. But you'll notice that the victim was wearing a red scarf around his neck. I imagine this red scarf is part of his costume for the new pirate show.Judge:Oh, you're right. It's written right here in the flyer for the new show. \"Featuring the dashing Redstache, with a fluttering red scarf!\"Athena:Although, I have to say, it just looks like a red scarf was added to his OLD costume...Buckler:Yeah, well, the captain was never one to spend too much money on costumes... But, you know, the captain wasn't WEARING that red scarf...Phoenix:But in this photo, I believe I see a red scarf...Buckler:Yeah, but it's not wrapped around his neck. It's just draped on top of his neck. That red scarf was packed away with the rest of the new show's equipment. It must've fallen on top of the captain when the equipment fell down.Phoenix:Oh... I see...Judge:It looks like your \"discrepancy\" wasn't really a \"discrepancy\" after all.Phoenix:(So the scarf doesn't have anything to do with the case? But there's something about the timing of the stuff falling that bothers me... Hold on. The timing of the stuff falling... The timing... Maybe... my theory has been all wrong from the beginning! Maybe... the bag of coins isn't the murder weapon!)Blackquill:Heh heh. And so your last cross-examination ends in failure as well. You should know that such a feeble slash will never hurt me. As I said... the orca made the equipment fall and then toyed with the body in the water.Phoenix:Phoenix:I'm sorry, Prosecutor Blackquill, but based on the circumstances at the scene... ...the defendant couldn't have dragged the body into the water after the equipment fell.Blackquill:...Hmm? And why, pray tell, is that?Phoenix:Oh, I'll tell you all right. (If my theory has been all wrong... then I'll just have to fix it!)Judge:Yes, Mr. Wright. Please do tell the court. What indicates that the body was not dragged into the water after the items fell?Present red scarfPhoenix:Leads to:\"This red scarf fell at the same time as the bag of coins.\"Present anywhere elsePhoenix:Phoenix:Please focus on this point!Judge:That point? I don't see any particular problem there.Phoenix:Right here! No... uh, I mean... right AROUND here! To, uh... somewhere over there-ish... And please also take a look at this area over here as well...Judge:Mr. Wright! Your \"point\" is gradually expanding to include the entire photograph!Phoenix:(...Okay. I deserved that. The items that fell were props for the new show. A blow-up dolphin and anchor, the bag of coins, the red scarf, swords... If the body was dragged into the pool AFTER the items fell... ...then a certain piece of evidence shouldn't still be in this photograph.)Judge:All right. Please try that again.Leads back to:\"What indicates that the body was not dragged into the water after the items fell?\"Phoenix:This red scarf fell at the same time as the bag of coins. But if the body was dragged into the pool after the bag of coins fell... ...then the red scarf wouldn't still be on top of the body!Blackquill:Wh-What...?!Phoenix:In other words, the victim was already dead when the equipment came crashing down! Therefore, the bag of coins that fell with the red scarf was NOT the murder weapon!Blackquill:Blackquill:But it was the defense who claimed the bag of coins was the murder weapon to begin with!Phoenix:Well... yes, that's true.Blackquill:Do you intend to abandon your original argument?Phoenix:After hearing the testimony, I realized my theory about the murder weapon was wrong. Please recall the facts we have learned so far. It's a fact that what Orla bit was the victim's dead body.Judge:After all, when we saw the victim on the security footage, he was already dead.Phoenix:But then, Orla carried the victim's body to the side of the pool... ...and knocked down the equipment for the new pirate show that was piled up there. Maybe Orla was trying to alert the humans to the victim's condition. If Orla knocked the items down on the victim after he was already dead... ...then it means the defendant didn't kill the victim with those items!Blackquill:BUT THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS! ............Even still, your argument is lacking... If neither the orca's head-butting nor the bag of coins were the manner of death... ...then how do you propose the victim was killed?Phoenix:Aaaaaaagh!Judge:A very good point. If the defense is now abandoning its original theory... ...then we would need a new theory as to what the murder weapon was.Phoenix:Ugh... A-All right... (I doubt \"I have no clue\" would go over well.)Athena:All right! Let's go over what we still need to find out about the victim's body.Phoenix:What we don't know is how he died and why his body was at the bottom of the pool. I wonder if there's something that would explain both of those things at once?Athena:Hmm... How did the victim's body sink to the bottom of the pool...? On a diagram, it's easy enough to move the body to the bottom of the pool... ...but in real life, the water would just cause the body to float.Phoenix:Right... (Hold on... Water? Okay. Then what if we flip that around? What if there was no water? Then the body would go right down in an instant. ...So could the real manner of death be...?!) Thanks for the great hint, Athena.Athena:What? I helped you, and I didn't even know it?!Phoenix:Your Honor! I think we know the real manner of the victim's death!Judge:\"I think\" won't do, Mr. Wright. I expect a clear answer. Now then, what was the real manner of Jack Shipley's death?Phoenix:(What's the manner of death that moved the victim to the bottom of the pool in an instant?)FallingLeads to:\"Please take a look at this diagram of the pool.\"DrowningPhoenix:We believe the victim drowned, Your Honor.Blackquill:Blackquill:............Autopsy report.Judge:Ah, of course! Let's see... Cause of death was \"instant death from a brain contusion.\" Your answer is completely wrong, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:...You're right, Your Honor. Please let me try that again.Leads back to:\"What's the manner of death that moved the victim to the bottom of the pool in an instant?\"AssaultPhoenix:We believe the victim was assaulted with a blunt instrument, Your Honor!Blackquill:Blackquill:...But nothing like that was found at the crime scene, other than the bag of coins. So if it wasn't the coins, then what was the murder weapon?!Phoenix:Um... could we just forget I said that...? You know, about the blunt instrument...?Judge:\"Forget\"...? Very well. I'll try to forget it, but I won't forget to give you a penalty!Phoenix:Gah... Please let me try that again.Leads back to:\"What's the manner of death that moved the victim to the bottom of the pool in an instant?\"Phoenix:Please take a look at this diagram of the pool. If there was no water in the pool... ...then it would be very easy to move the victim's body to the bottom of the pool.Judge:He would drop straight down... Oh, my! Could that be the true manner of death...?!Phoenix:The orca pool is about sixty-five feet deep. (Changed from [The orca pool is about 65 feet deep.] in the original release) If the victim were to go from the top of the pool to the bottom when there was no water... ...then he would, without question, have fallen to his death!Judge:...Death from a fall...!Blackquill:Ngh... And that's your answer...?Athena:It all makes perfect sense! If he fell, that would explain the \"signs of blunt force trauma all over the body,\" too!Phoenix:The culprit pushed the victim into the pool when there was no water in it. After doing something to keep the body from floating up, they filled the pool with water. The pool water washed away any signs of blood, so no one would realize that he fell!Judge:S-Surprisingly, that actually makes sense! Order! Order in the court! I'm just as surprised as you are, but I must have order! If falling was the manner of death, then does that mean the defendant's behavior... ...was the result of being manipulated by the true culprit, as the defense claimed?!Phoenix:Yes, it would have to be. All that needs to be explained now is how the real culprit commanded Orla! Ms. Buckler, is there a way to instruct Orla to bite someone?Buckler:What?! What kind of trick would that be?! Of course not!Phoenix:Then could you tell us about the tricks Orla does know?Buckler:Well, there's jumping, dancing, and playing volleyball. And she can spin, do the rock 'n' roll trick, and sing the Swashbuckler Spectacular song.Phoenix:(Those sound like pretty nice tricks, but I doubt they're related to this case.)Buckler:She's also practicing two new, top-secret tricks. There's the \"human rocket,\" where she shoots somebody up into the air. And then there's the \"lifesaver\" trick, where she brings a drowning person to the surface.Phoenix:(Hey! One of these \"top-secret\" tricks might have something to do with the case! Now, which of these two tricks sounds relevant to the case?)The human rocket trickPhoenix:The human rocket trick shoots a person up into the air. That means Orla shot the victim's body, which had sunk to the bottom, up to the surface!Judge:Hmm... Are you implying that's how the victim's body got to the surface? In that case, when did the bite marks get onto the victim's clothes?Phoenix:Huh? (Oops. I forgot about those.)Judge:I can't accept your theory unless it explains all of the circumstances of this case.Phoenix:(Orla has two \"top-secret\" tricks. The human rocket trick, where she shoots somebody up into the air. And the lifesaver trick, where she brings a drowning person to the surface.)Leads back to:\"Now, which of these two tricks sounds relevant to the case?\"The lifesaver trickLeads to:\"So, in the lifesaver trick, Orla brings a drowning person to the surface, correct?\"Phoenix:So, in the lifesaver trick, Orla brings a drowning person to the surface, correct?Buckler:You cod it! Orla's still learning how to hold someone gently in her mouth... ...so she sometimes bites into their clothes, but she's never hurt a person's skin.Athena:She brings a drowning person to the surface?! Then that must be it...!DePlume:And then the killer whale swam up toward the surface with the victim in its mouth!Judge:That matches up perfectly with what Ms. DePlume said in her testimony!Phoenix:The real culprit must have used the lifesaver trick command to manipulate Orla!Judge:Hmm... I still find this very hard to believe.Phoenix:Then let's see it for ourselves. Let's have Orla show us her trick using a practice dummy.Blackquill:...Hmph. As you wish.Judge:The prosecution doesn't appear to have any objection. Ms. Buckler, please proceed.Buckler:Okay, sure! I'll show you Orla's fin-omenal trick! Hey, Marlon! Are you ready over there?Rimes:Okay, lemme just go get the practice dummy... ...There! It's in the pool! Ready and standin' by, Sasha!Buckler:Here goes! Orla's secret new trick, the lifesaver!Anime cutsceneRimes:The clothes got torn up a little, but the dummy doesn't have any new marks on it!Orla:Fwee, fweet! Fwee, fweeeeet!Buckler:And there you have it! Orla's secret new trick!Man:Wow! That orca is really something!Woman:A cute thing like that wouldn't hurt anybody!Phoenix:(Sounds like the gallery loved Orla's performance!)Athena:That was great! That awesome trick captured everybody's heart!Judge:Ho ho ho! Wonderful! I wish I could see more!Blackquill:............Athena:Looks like we silenced Prosecutor Blackquill!Phoenix:Thank you, Orla and Ms. Buckler. And thank you, too, Mr. Rimes. And so now you can clearly see that Orla was manipulated. The bottom of the orca pool needs to be examined immediately! We might still find some evidence of the victim falling to his death!Judge:Prosecutor Blackquill, please have that taken care of at once!Blackquill:............Judge:Uh, excuse me, Prosecutor Blackquill, but I am requesting further investigation...Blackquill:............ GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!Fulbright:Tsk, tsk, Prosecutor Blackquill! You have to answer the nice judge politely! Oh, that's right! I almost forgot! The thing you asked for just came in.Blackquill:Ngh... And you couldn't be bothered to think of a less violent way to deliver it...?Phoenix:(What did Prosecutor Blackquill ask for?)Blackquill:Hmph............ I've been waiting for this.Judge:Oh? And what is that?Blackquill:............An updated autopsy report.Phoenix:What?! Why did it have to come now?!Blackquill:During the recess, I ordered the body to be re-examined. Something started nagging at me during the course of the trial, you see. ............Here.Judge:I take it you'd like me to read it? Very well. \"Cause of Death... Thought to be from 65-foot fall\"!Shipley's Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Judge:B-But this...! But this is decisive evidence that substantiates Mr. Wright's theory!Phoenix:What?! (It's something... GOOD for a change?!)Judge:If the manner of death was falling into an empty pool, the orca can't be responsible. It seems Orla's complete innocence has been proven.Blackquill:Hmph............ I suppose I can't deny that.Athena:This is fantastic! You did it, Mr. Wright! Prosecutor Blackquill isn't even trying to refute it! Orla is saved!Phoenix:Y-Yeah... (Is it really safe to celebrate...?)Judge:It would appear more investigation into this case is necessary. But first allow me to render my verdict. The court finds the defendant, Ora Shipley...Not GuiltyBuckler:You did it! Thank you so much, Phoenix! Thank you, Athena! Orla and Marlon thank you, too!Rimes:Congrats, Sasha!Orla:Fwee, fweet!Rimes:Time to celebrate! Go on! Eat up!Orla:Fwee, fwee, fweet!Athena:Hee hee! Glad to see everybody so happy! And I'm absolutely thrilled about the verdict!Blackquill:............ ...Thank you, Wright-dono.Phoenix:Huh?! For what?Blackquill:Hmph... The drained pool... Thanks to you, the truth is finally clear. Fool Bright............ Arrest this woman.Fulbright:Certainly! Right away, Prosecutor Blackquill! Sasha Buckler, you are hereby under arrest for the murder of Jack Shipley!Buckler:WHAAAT?!Phoenix:Wh-What are you talking about?! What reason could you possibly have?!Blackquill:Come now. You must have had some idea in the back of your dull, little mind. The true culprit manipulated the orca in order to have false charges brought upon her. ...And who is the only one with the ability to accomplish that? It can only be the orca's trainer!Phoenix:But I'm sure there's some other explanation!Blackquill:Blackquill:I don't need any of your baseless counterarguments... Have you forgotten? In order to enter the orca pool room, a security card is necessary. A security card that only the victim and Sasha Buckler possessed! Ms. Buckler is the only one who could have caused the victim to fall to his death!Phoenix:Aaaaaaagh!Judge:Wh-What?!Athena:No! I don't believe it! Ms. Buckler was so upset by Mr. Shipley's death! She couldn't have done it!Blackquill:............Fool Bright.Fulbright:We asked the security company yesterday to check their security card logs. Their report just came in during the recess. The night before the incident, Sasha Buckler used her card to enter the orca pool room. After that, not a single person entered the pool room! Not until the incident was discovered, when Ms. Buckler and the guard ran in.Phoenix:Phoenix:But no one would commit murder where their card usage was being recorded!Fulbright:Apparently, the aquarium employees don't know that their card usage is tracked. What's more, Ms. Buckler was seen arguing with the victim before the incident. So, Ms. Trainer, what were you arguing about?Buckler:It was... a private matter... But it wasn't anything I would kill him over! That's ridiculous!Blackquill:Ms. Buckler is the only one who entered the room, and she knows how to command Orla. Besides, I thought her suspicious from the very beginning.Phoenix:You suspected Ms. Buckler from the start?Blackquill:The orca did tricks because someone commanded her to do so. Possibly someone with a heart so black as to make her own partner the murder weapon! The possibility the orca killed the victim... The possibility a human manipulated the orca... I looked into both.Phoenix:(So he suspected both Sasha and Orla all along...)Blackquill:Hmph... My gratitude to you. After all... ...you were the one who drew out that information about the lifesaver trick. The orca you saved was an unwitting victim. A victim made to look like the weapon that killed Jack Shipley.Phoenix:Ungg... N-NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Fulbright:All right, come along, then. Let's have a good, long talk...Buckler:Wait! I didn't kill the captain! And I would never try to frame Orla! Why would I hurt the ones I love like that?!Athena:Sasha...!Buckler:Phoenix! Athena! You gotta believe me! I--Athena:Sasha didn't kill him! I believe that with all my heart! There's gotta be something we can do!Phoenix:(I feel the same way... Could I have done something differently? But never in my wildest dreams did I imagine things turning out like this!)Judge:Hmm... It would appear that this case has taken on an entirely new aspect. But this trial is only concerned with a ruling on the defendant, Ora Shipley. So I'm afraid this concludes today's trial. Court is adjourned!To be continuedPresenting wrong evidence during testimonyPhoenix:Phoenix:This piece of evidence clearly exposes the witness's lie!Judge:It does? In what way...?Blackquill:It does indeed expose something... the defense's boneheadedness. There is nothing untoward about that evidence, no matter how you bluster.Judge:I agree. There is nothing compelling in that evidence.Phoenix:(I'm definitely losing the judge's confidence in me here...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimonyPhoenix:Phoenix:Your Honor! What is your opinion on the witness's statement just now?Judge:My opinion? My opinion is that there is nothing wrong with it.Phoenix:Oh... This is my first trial in eight years. It looks like I made a little mistake...Judge:That is no excuse, Mr. Wright. I should give you eight years' worth of penalties!Phoenix:(It's been eight years. Can't he go easy on me?)Presenting wrong evidence during testimonyPhoenix:Phoenix:That statement is clearly inconsistent with this evidence, Your Honor!Blackquill:I hope you don't think waving your finger about aimlessly... ...is going to help you win this trial!Judge:Hmm... I agree. I see nothing inconsistent with that evidence.Phoenix:Urk! (I must have the wrong evidence...)Consult (when evidence must be presented)Athena:Mr. Wright! I think I have something here!Phoenix:You sensed something wrong with the testimony?Athena:That's right. Let me show you which statement I thought was strange!Phoenix:Thanks. That would be a big help! (Then I'll just have to compare the evidence with the statement she shows me!)Consult (when statements must be pressed)Athena:Mr. Wright, I don't see any inconsistencies in the testimony. This might be a good time to--Phoenix:Press for more information? I think you're right.Athena:I just can't help but feel that there's more to this statement than meets the eye.Phoenix:(I'll put my faith in Athena and press on that statement, then!)Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment \"What I Saw and What I Heard\")Phoenix:Phoenix:When we view your emotions alongside your testimony, we find the unexpected emotion-- (Wait a minute... There really isn't anything strange here.)Athena:I don't know, but I think maybe we made a mistake, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:......I think maybe you're right.Athena:Let's take another look! There must be an unexpected emotion here somewhere!Too many penaltiesJudge:That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial.

Not cool...Phoenix:Wait a minute! Talk about false accusations! We were able to prove the defendant's innocence...Athena:...But then Sasha got arrested instead.Trucy:So that's what happened.

Where are youuu?Orla:...Fweet...Phoenix:I can hear her at the bottom of the pool. Maybe there's some water down there.Athena:Orla sounds so sad. Maybe she misses Sasha.???:Careful, there! You shouldn't get right up to the edge like that!Fulbright:You don't want to end up like the victim! Besides, the police are still conducting their investigation here. Don't go poking around!Athena:Detective Fulbright...! Grrr!Fulbright:Is something wrong, Ms. Lawyer? You look angry.Athena:I object to you arresting Ms. Buckler!Phoenix:Detective, I'd like to ask you some questions about the case, if you don't mind.Fulbright:Go right ahead!TalkWhy arrest Buckler?Athena:Ms. Buckler is one-hundred-percent innocent, so why did you arrest her?!Fulbright:I understand your desire to believe in her. But the fact remains that she's suspicious! Right now, there are investigators on the scene, so you can come in as you please... ...but ordinarily, a security card is required to enter this orca pool room. The victim and Sasha Buckler were the only ones who possessed this card. And yesterday, the day of the incident, there's proof the suspect's card was used.Security Card added to the Court Record.Athena:O-Objection! Somebody else could have used Ms. Buckler's card!Fulbright:Oh, my! I guess that would be one possible explanation...Athena:Hee hee! Didn't I sound just like a lawyer right there?Phoenix:...Yeah. (We'd kinda be in trouble if you didn't...)Fulbright:Except! The suspect confirmed she entered the room at the time the record states. She said she was here from 3:00 to 6:00 AM on July 20th. Apparently, she was giving the orca pool room a good cleaning.Phoenix:Cleaning, in the middle of the night?Fulbright:Yes, she said that a lot of the heavy-duty cleaning is done at night. The suspect also admits that she was fighting with the owner before his murder. What's more, nobody saw the victim again after he met with the suspect.Athena:O-Objection...! Um, there must be something I can object to in there somewhere...Phoenix:Save your objections for tomorrow's trial. By the way, Detective Fulbright, do you think Ms. Buckler's questioning is over?Fulbright:No, not yet. But I told the guy in charge to take it easy on her...Athena:Why? Is something wrong?Fulbright:...Oops! Forget I said anything. It doesn't concern you two anyway.Phoenix:But it does concern us. We intend to represent Ms. Buckler.Fulbright:What? You do? In that case, I have a favor to ask. Could you get this medicine to her?Phoenix:Medicine...? Looks like a prescription from Hickfield Clinic... (I've spent some time at that hospital, myself.)Fulbright:We confiscated it from her home when we were doing a search. I can't get away here, so if you could make sure she gets it, that would be great.Athena:Medicine, huh...? Does Ms. Buckler have some illness?Fulbright:Um... I think that's the kind of question you'd better ask her. In justice we trust! Now I need to get back to the investigation.Prescription Bag added to the Court Record.Phoenix:We can give it to her as soon as they let us talk to her. (And we have to return her calendar to her as well. If we can't see Sasha or investigate, we should question people at the aquarium...)Why arrest Buckler?

All kinds of people try to buy the police's favor... A politician once even sent me some raw meat as a bribe.Phoenix:Raw meat? So what did you do with it?Fulbright:It goes without saying! I returned it to him, and then I arrested him! The meat was rotten by the time he got it back, though...Phoenix:(Must've been a pretty rotten day for the politician altogether...)Prescription BagFulbright:Please give that to Sasha Buckler!

Or cat whiskers...Phoenix:Well, if you think that will help your act, I say go for it.Any ideas?Trucy:Remember, investigation and questioning people are a lawyer's two main tools! Even if you've already checked a place, you might find something new if you look again.Phoenix:Well, listen to you!

Just when we prove Orla innocent, Sasha gets arrested! I'll never forgive that Prosecutor Blackquill and Detective Fulbright! This stress on my heart is just too much!Phoenix:(Poor Athena. She's really upset...) We'd better do some more investigating if we want to save Sasha. Let's check the orca pool room again and question everybody involved.Athena:Gee, Mr. Wright! You sure know how to stay calm in a crisis! I can top that! LOOK HOW CALM I CAN BE!Phoenix:(Yes, the very definition of \"calm,\" I'd say...) Good for you. Now let's get back to the investigation.Any ideas?Athena:I had a thought. How about if I try getting on Taka's good side? Then maybe he wouldn't attack when that awful Prosecutor Blackquill told him to!Phoenix:(Not sure it's that simple, but, anyway...) How are you going to get on his good side?Athena:Well, if I made myself smell like meat, he'd start to like me! The way to a bird's heart is through his nose, right?Phoenix:I'd rather you didn't smell like meat while you were standing next to me at the bench.Present\"The Killer Killer Whale\"Athena:It's just horrible! How could Ms. DePlume write such mean things about Orla?! This awful book made the judge doubt her innocence!Phoenix:Especially since he's a fan of Ms. DePlume's work.Athena:I read the book, too, you know... I hate to admit it, but it's a real page-turner. It really brought the scenes to life. Ms. DePlume is a powerful writer. She knows how to capture the reader's imagination. ...Maybe I'll ask her to sign the book for me.Phoenix:Well, what do you know. Looks like you really DID become a fan.After clearing \"Why arrest Buckler?\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool:July 21Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' DangerAthena:Huh? That door is open.

I'm not feeling super good at the moment... We're not making any progress on this murder investigation, and--???:...Hey, Miss? Where is the patient? Don't you have your pet with you? ...Oh, wait a minute. That was my last job. This is the aquarium... I was exhausted from all that questioning... I must've fallen asleep.Phoenix:(Wh-What's with this guy...?)???:...My apologies. I just woke up, and I was a little groggy.Crab:I'm Dr. Herman Crab. I'm Shipshape Aquarium's resident veterinarian.Athena:Oh! You're the \"Dr. Crab\" Mr. Rimes mentioned yesterday!Phoenix:(And Rimes also mentioned he hadn't seen Dr. Crab around... I wonder where he was?)Crab:...Son of a gun. This little thing doesn't let me get any sleep.???:*peep!* *peep, peep, peep!*Athena:Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw! What a cute little thing! Who is it?Crab:A penguin chick, a member of the Little Penguin species. She lives in my hair.Athena:Oh, you're so lucky! I wish I had a pet to live in my hair!Phoenix:Athena, no pets allowed in my office.Athena:Aww, you're no fun...Crab:If you two don't have any particular business with me, please leave. I have to get ready to make my rounds. ...Back in you go, little one.Phoenix:Wait! We'd like to ask you a few questions, to save Ms. Buckler!Crab:Hold on... Don't tell me you're the curious pair who defended Orla?Phoenix:That's right. Please let us ask you a little about the case.TalkHerman CrabPhoenix:Dr. Crab, were you gone from the aquarium yesterday?Crab:That's right. I had some minor business at the Supermarine Aquarium.Phoenix:\"S-Supermarine\"? That's a funny name for an aquarium.Athena:The Supermarine Aquarium is the nation's biggest dolphin therapy treatment center! I go there, myself. I'm friends with their dolphins!Phoenix:You and Apollo were talking about animal-assisted therapy yesterday, weren't you?Crab:I go to the Supermarine once a month, but I live here, of course.Phoenix:You LIVE here at the aquarium?!Crab:That's right. I have a sleeping bag here, and sometimes I use the nap room. I'm responsible for the health and well-being of all the marine creatures here. If any of them have a sudden medical emergency, I'll be here to help them.Athena:Wow. You're kind of rough around the edges, Dr. Crab, but you care about your work!Crab:...Hey, buddy? Is this young lady trying to pick a fight with me?Phoenix:...I apologize for her, sir. She tends to be too honest.Crab:Well, you're no paragon of politeness, either, apparently.The penguin chickAthena:Can we see the penguin chick again?!Crab:Stop! Don't come any closer!???:*peeeeeeep!*Athena:OWWWWW!Crab:I'm sorry she attacked you. She doesn't like anyone but me, I'm afraid. I was the first one she saw when she hatched, so she thinks I'm her parent. She targets people from my hair, so please be careful.Phoenix:She's just like a little sniper, isn't she?Crab:Exactly. That's why I named her \"Sniper.\" Her mother's name is \"Rifle.\"Phoenix:(\"Sniper\" and \"Rifle,\" huh? What a dangerous-sounding mother and daughter.)Athena:So this is Rifle's daughter! ...Which means both mother and daughter now hate me.Crab:Little Penguins are generally belligerent little creatures. It's hard to get them to warm up. But they're nocturnal, so you might be able to touch them during the day.Phoenix:You and Sniper get along well, don't you? Just like Sasha and Orla.Crab:But unlike Sniper and me, the two of them seem to truly understand one another. This one keeps me awake every night! Looks like I won't sleep until she leaves the nest.Phoenix:(It must be rough for him... but it's pretty cute to watch for us...)About the murderPhoenix:Can you tell me anything about Jack Shipley's murder?Crab:Gah! ...I still can't believe Jack is gone... He's the one who brought me on board. How could he up and die on me?!Athena:Did you and Mr. Shipley get along?Crab:He loved all animals and fish, but I'm not like that. ...But I still took pride in my work as a vet, nonetheless. We got along well enough as business associates. And it's thanks to him my laboratory is what it is today.Phoenix:It IS a pretty amazing laboratory.Crab:Ah, you have discerning taste, I see. I could tell you more about my lab, if you'd like.Dr. Crab's lab (appears after \"About the murder\")Athena:This place is just filled with electronics! What are those monitors for?Crab:Essentially, they're digital medical records for all the creatures here. I can also view the feed from the visitor's corridor security camera here. That way, I can see that silly mother penguin when she tries to escape.Phoenix:So you were the one who gave this security footage to the police?Crab:No, I wasn't here yesterday, but I did give my permission for them to take it. And I gave them a statement about Jack and Sasha arguing.Athena:Oh! So you were the one who witnessed it?Crab:That's right. It was late in the evening of the 19th, maybe about midnight. I saw them fighting near the Aqua Tunnel. I don't know what their argument was about, though.Phoenix:Are you sure you should be talking to us about this?Crab:I'm not taking sides. I'll give information to anyone who wants it. What you do with that information at Sasha's trial is up to you.Athena:Wow. You're kind of rough around the edges, Dr. Crab, but you're a pretty nice guy!Crab:Hmph! You ARE trying to pick a fight, aren't you, young lady?!Athena:Aww, isn't that cute! He's easily embarrassed!PresentPhoto of the Body or Shipley's Autopsy ReportCrab:Son of a gun! How could you die before fulfilling your promise to me?!Phoenix:Mr. Shipley promised you something?Crab:He promised he would make Shipshape Aquarium the greatest aquarium in the world. It was because of that promise that I agreed to become the resident vet here.Athena:So you were just a regular veterinarian before this?Crab:That's right. Big or small, there is no living creature I cannot treat! Would you like me to examine you?Athena:What?! You can treat people, too? You're amazing, Dr. Crab!Crab:...I was joking, of course. Ooh, you walked right into that one!Athena:GRRRRRRRRRRR! You're awful, Dr. Crab!Phoenix:(Okay, so that makes him... amazingly awful...?)Anything elseCrab:Hmm? Don't waste my time with useless nonsense. I'm sleepy, I tell you!Phoenix:(He won't even glance at it.)After clearing all Talk options:Sniper:*peep*... *peep, peep, peep!*Crab:Huh? Son of a gun. Are you hungry again already? And that silly mother penguin's nowhere to be found again...Sniper:*peep* *peep, peep, peep!*Crab:Gaaaaagh! Would you quit peeping in my ear?! According to her walkie-talkie, Rifle is somewhere around the Aqua Tunnel. If you see her, could you bring her to me? I have to go examine some other creatures...Athena:No sweat! And this time, I'll get her to like me, too!Phoenix:(Rifle has escaped again? What is she, she the Houdini of the penguin world?) There's no guarantee we'll find her right away but let's head for the Aqua Tunnel.July 21Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua TunnelDePlume:Aaaaagh! It's you two! The blue and yellow duo! I'm very angry about what you did this morning!Phoenix:(Uh-oh. We ran into the sea lion before our penguin...)DePlume:I write the truth. And I will find the truth with my own eyes! I won't be bested by the likes of the blue and yellow duo!Phoenix:(When did we become the \"blue and yellow duo\"...?)Widget:Athena will never give up!Phoenix:In that case, I'll leave the questioning to you, Athena.Athena:Thanks a lot, Widget. Well, at least she's a worthy adversary! Okay! Let's do this!Phoenix:Ha ha ha. You'll do great! (You know, being the boss isn't half bad.)TalkLast year's scoopAthena:Have you been gathering material about last year's incident ever since?DePlume:That is correct. An acquaintance of the victim asked me to look into it, you see.Phoenix:An acquaintance of the victim?DePlume:I refuse to divulge any information about my clients. The aquarium is saying it was an accident, but I don't believe that's the truth. It seems to me they're all hiding something -- every last one of them! The only thing I can think is that the killer whale murdered that poor girl.Athena:But you don't even know if that's true or not!DePlume:That's enough out of you, yellow girl! As I said, I'm still investigating the matter... Once I learn the truth, I plan to write a sequel to this book.Phoenix:(She's completely taken with her \"investigation\"...)DePlume:I came to make a report on the anniversary of the previous trainer's death... ...only to find the aquarium owner murdered! I was deeply shocked.Phoenix:(So this incident happened on the exact same date as the last one...? It can't be a coincidence... Anyway, we'd better ask Ms. DePlume about today's trial.)Today's trial (appears after \"Last year's scoop\")Athena:So you heard Orla singing, and that's when you realized something was happening?DePlume:Correct! ...Ooh, it's all so galling! I still can't believe the culprit used ME, Norma DePlume! In any case, I swear that killer whale song brings misfortune. First last year, now again...Athena:A fun song like that?! How could it bring misfortune to anyone?!DePlume:You think that barbaric song is \"fun\"? I'll never understand the tastes of children...Phoenix:...I don't remember that Swashbuckler Spectacular song being all that \"barbaric\"...DePlume:Well, if you don't remember it, I will gladly sing it for you!Anime cutsceneDePlume:\u266a Avast, mateys! Landlubbers, ho! \u266a\u266a Hand o'er all yer gold! \u266a\u266a Pillage, plunder, then feast like kings! \u266a\u266a Them's the joys of pirating! \u266aDePlume:...That's how it goes. Now, what is \"fun\" about those lyrics, pray tell?Phoenix:(She seemed to be enjoying it well enough...)Athena:Wait a minute! That isn't the Swashbuckler Spectacular song! THIS is the song from the Swashbuckler Spectacular!Anime cutsceneAthena:\u266a Oh, we be pirates, we love to sail the seven seas. \u266a\u266a Just a bunch o' scallywags who are as free as free can be. \u266a\u266a We swim through storms and waves, all because, you see \u266a\u266a Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me! \u266aDePlume:............What was that? I've never heard that song before.Athena:What? It's the song they use in the Swashbuckler Spectacular! Oh, we be pirates, we love to sail the seven seas. Just a bunch o' scallywags who are as free as free can be. We swim through storms and waves, all because, you see Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me!DePlume:But that can't be! It's completely different from the song a year ago! Avast, mateys! Landlubbers, ho! Hand o'er all yer gold! Pillage, plunder, then feast like kings! Them's the joys of pirating! Unless you show me some proof, I won't believe your song is right!Athena:Grr! She's so stubborn!Phoenix:Well, if it's proof she wants, it's proof she'll get of the Swashbuckler Spectacular song.Dangerous Animal Control (appears after \"Today's trial\", then presenting Swashbuckler Video)Phoenix:Can you tell us about this \"Center for Dangerous Animal Control\"?DePlume:Just as the name implies, it's an organization that monitors dangerous animals. The center demanded that the aquarium put the killer whale down a year ago.Athena:P-Put her down?!DePlume:But the aquarium owner refused their demand, saying it was an accidental death. But I hardly think a persistent organization like that would just give up and go away. I'm quite sure the power of money helped convince them!Phoenix:What makes you think that?DePlume:Once a month, the owner and the vet disappear from this aquarium. And I came to find out that, each time, a large amount of money was being paid out!Athena:Oh! And you think the money was going to this Center for Dangerous Animal Control?DePlume:...I'm looking into it now. You'll have to wait until my book comes out to see! In any case, I can't catch that man out on anything... ...but that veterinarian is not to be trusted.Phoenix:(Dr. Herman Crab... There's still so much we don't know about him...)Athena:Well, I don't see Rifle here. What do you want to do next?Phoenix:I think we'd better stop by the office and discuss a plan of action.PresentSwashbuckler Video (after clearing \"Today's trial\" Talk option)Phoenix:This recording contains the Swashbuckler Spectacular song. In it, you can hear Ms. Buckler and Orla singing together. (Changed from [In it, you can see Ms. Buckler and Orla singing together.] in the original release)Orla:Fwe fwe fweet, fwe fwe fwe fweeet!

B-But I've never heard this song before!Athena:Huh? But they always sing this song during the Swashbuckler Spectacular...DePlume:Well, I haven't seen the show recently... A year ago, they used the song that I sang to you. I'd recognize it anywhere! Perhaps that killer whale can sing two songs?Phoenix:According to Ms. Buckler, Orla only knows one song.DePlume:Then... what was that song that I heard...?Athena:We wish we knew...Phoenix:(The orca sang a song she isn't supposed to know how to sing...?)Swashbuckler Video updated in the Court Record.DePlume:It's obvious I have a lot more investigating to do on Shipshape Aquarium. And perhaps I'd better look into the Center for Dangerous Animal Control as well...Phoenix:(The Center for Dangerous Animal Control? What's that?)Swashbuckler Video (after clearing \"Today's trial\" Talk option; subsequent times)DePlume:I can't believe it! A song I've never heard before... Of course, I haven't seen the show since the incident a year ago...Phoenix:Why not?DePlume:Because the owner was in the show, and I thought it best he didn't see me. I've been banned from the aquarium, after all.Athena:Being able to say that with your head held high proves you're somebody who matters!Phoenix:(And being able to say that right in front of somebody proves you're a newbie, Athena.)\"The Killer Killer Whale\"DePlume:If it's an autograph you want, I give them out to anyone, no matter who it is. But make sure you've read the entire book before you ask. After all, the worth of a book is not who the writer is or what the cover looks like.Phoenix:(Huh. That actually made sense.) ...I'll be sure to read it.Athena:I read it! I hate to admit it, but I thought it was very well-written.DePlume:Well, well, yellow girl. I just might have to learn your name.Athena:Really?! It's Athena Cykes!DePlume:I simply wrote \"to banana girl\" when I signed your book. Because of the yellow, you see.Athena:\"B-Banana girl\"?! That's the worst one yet!Phoenix:So, do you regret being a fan now?After clearing \"Dangerous Animal Control\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel:July 21Wright Anything AgencyTrucy:3, 2, 1...

That's all for Trucy's magic show! Come back and see me next time!Apollo:Great job, Trucy. You never fail to impress. I have no idea how you did that, either.Phoenix:We're back... Oh, Pearls! Stopping by for a visit?Pearl:Hee hee. Hello, Mr. Nick. Are you missing something...?Phoenix:Uh, thanks... (From out of the ol' Magic Panties, huh...)Apollo:How is the investigation going, Mr. Wright?TalkThe investigationLeads to:\"We don't have much time, but we didn't get a chance to check out the crime scene yet.\"PresentSwashbuckler VideoApollo:Athena already made me watch it so many times, I remember the whole show.Phoenix:When this case is over, we should go see the show live.Apollo:I bet Trucy would like it.Athena:Gee, I sure would like to see a head-to-head between Sasha and Trucy!Apollo:Magician versus pirate, huh? That would be one wild show, I bet.Athena:And we could join the fray as a band of lawyers! Right, Boss?Phoenix:That would be even wilder than a day in court, I bet...Phoenix:We don't have much time, but we didn't get a chance to check out the crime scene yet.Apollo:I see...Trucy:Oh! Speaking of checking out the crime scene, Daddy... You should bring your forensics kit with you! Fingerprint powder to check for prints, and luminol testing fluid to look for blood!Athena:Wow, Trucy! I didn't know you had stuff like that, too!Trucy:Hee hee! I got them from a detective friend of mine.Pearl:Mr. Nick! I'd like to help you with your investigation! Can I borrow your forensicking kit?Phoenix:I feel bad making you work when you're supposed to be here having fun.Pearl:I don't mind. And I'd like to see Rifle again, too.Apollo:If you have anything for me to do, I'd like to help, too.Phoenix:Yeah? Thanks. I'll be sure to ask you if anything comes up, then.Apollo:Well, I'll be right here... hanging around watering Charley... if you think of anything!Phoenix:Ha ha. I appreciate that, Apollo. (I've got some good kids, here.) All right, team, let's do our best! I have faith we can save Sasha all together.Athena:It sure feels nice to be part of a great group like this! I just want to say that I really love working here, with all of you fabulous people. Thank you for bringing me aboard, Boss!Phoenix:S-Same here, Athena. (She's so earnest, she's making me blush.)Athena:Okay! Let's all run over to the aquarium!Pearl:I hope I can be of some use with the forensicking kit!Phoenix:H-Hey, wait up, you two! (They left without me...)July 21Shipshape Aquarium - Orca PoolFulbright:In justice we trust! Good timing! We're done with the crime scene for now... ...and we're just about to examine the show stage. Marlon Rimes helped with the cleaning, so we've got to go talk with him.Phoenix:(...I thought he'd be more tight-lipped than this, but hey...)Fulbright:You're welcome to look around here now, if you'd like!Phoenix:Thank you. I think we'll do just that.Fulbright:Oh, by the way... If you want to examine the bottom of the pool... ...I recommend using that hoist over by the ladder to get down there.Phoenix:(That crane-like thing hanging from the ceiling, right? Got it.)Fulbright:Just stand on the ladder platform, and the police guard will operate it for you.Phoenix:Thanks. (Why couldn't the pool be less deep...?)Fulbright:Well, good luck to us both! In justice we trust!Athena:Now that Detective Fulbright's gone, we can do anything we want here!Phoenix:The guard is still here, so keep your voice down when you say stuff like that, Athena...ExaminePirate flagAthena:So Orla pulled this pirate flag and made the stuff fall down, huh?Phoenix:Hey. Doesn't this pirate flag look like a transport stretcher to you? And judging by the size, it's probably for Orla.Athena:Hey, you're right. There are holes for her flippers, too.Phoenix:But that pirate flag design... Mr. Shipley sure was into the whole \"pirate\" thing.Athena:We need to get serious about the whole \"lawyer\" thing, too. We can't let Prosecutor Blackquill outdo us!PoolPhoenix:It looks like the water was drained for the police investigation. It seems kind of... sad, somehow, without the water.Athena:When something that was there before is suddenly gone, it has a psychological effect. Like, for example, if all the magic props in the office were suddenly put away neatly.Phoenix:I don't think that's ever gonna happen as long as Trucy continues to practice magic.Athena:Well, she might not always be interested in magic, you know. She's at the age when young women start to worry about their future. The same thing happened to me, and I ended up becoming a lawyer.Phoenix:(I'm pretty sure Trucy will always be interested in magic.)OctopusAthena:One of the giant octopus's legs has been broken off.Phoenix:Orla's spikes sure can do a lot of damage. Mr. Shipley must've been really strong to be able to return those hits.Athena:I'm pretty amazing, myself, when it comes to strength! I run every day, and I go mountain climbing, too! I bet I could return Orla's spike... Well, I'll be able to someday, anyway!Phoenix:Do you really have to turn every little thing into a competition?HoistAthena:Yesterday, I asked around about this orca pool room, you know. They said that this hoist is used to move equipment and even Orla herself.Phoenix:How do they move Orla?Athena:Hee hee! I thought you'd ask that! Apparently, they use a stretcher made especially for an orca.Phoenix:...Well, what do you know. (Athena looks pleased with herself.)DoorPhoenix:Only the victim and Sasha had security cards for this door. And Sasha was the only one who had entered the room up until the time of discovery.Athena:Hmm... It won't be easy, but we can do this! Kein Problem! Sasha was devastated by Mr. Shipley's death. That means the true culprit has to be somebody else. So, chin up, Boss! Onward and upward!Phoenix:(As the boss, shouldn't I be the one giving her a pep talk?)OutlineAthena:The victim fell to his death and was kept down at the bottom of the pool. But Orla brought him up to the edge of the pool with her lifesaver trick.Phoenix:I wonder if Orla was actually trying to save him? I'm convinced she knocked down the equipment to call for help, too.Athena:Yeah, I bet that's what really happened. Because she loved him...LadderPhoenix:(Let's use the hoist to go down to the bottom of the pool...)OrlaPhoenix:This must be Orla's bedroom. There's even a sofa and everything.Athena:Orla! Congratulations on your \"not guilty\" verdict! But... we have bad news... Now Sasha has been arrested instead.Orla:Fweeeeet...Phoenix:Orla seems sad.Athena:I'm sure she is. I can sense the sadness filling her heart. Don't worry, Orla! We'll save Sasha!Orla:Fweet, fweet!Athena:I think Orla's wishing us good luck!Phoenix:Orla really seems to understand what we're saying.Athena:She can't understand our words, but I bet she can understand our hearts.TreasureAthena:Wow! Look at all that treasure! Those jewels and that crown are huge!Phoenix:They sure are. I guess everything is size \"large\" around here.Athena:No, everything is size \"Orla.\"Phoenix:(I stand corrected.)Skull rock, compass, or mapAthena:A map, a compass... and a spooky, skull-shaped rock! Orla's room is filled with pirate pizzazz!Phoenix:But that skull rock seems out of place. It doesn't go with the other things...Athena:Yeah, it does seem pretty weird to have a big skull rock next to your desk...Phoenix:Maybe Sasha wasn't finished arranging the set?Athena:When it comes to Orla, Sasha doesn't seem like the type to leave something half done... Her state of mind when she put it there... That could be the key to this mystery! And I bet it's a mystery I can solve!Phoenix:Never mind that mystery. Let's get back to the investigation.LanternAthena:They called this the \"Captain's Cabin\" on TV! Every night, by the light of the lantern, Orla pores over her treasures.Phoenix:Hmm... Sounds more like a miserly housewife going over the family finances...After examining Orla and treasure:Pearl:Is this a good time to get started, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:Huh? Started with what?Pearl:This is the crime scene, right? So this should be the perfect place to start forensicking!Phoenix:(She wants to use the forensics kit so badly, she's practically beaming.) Okay, let's do it. Forensicking, it is!Pearl:Hooray! I get to help!Phoenix:All right. We'll need these...Athena:Um... what's with the glasses, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:It's not like they're a fashion statement! We need them to see if there's any blood! All right, Pearls. You spray the luminol wherever I need it, okay?Pearl:Got it, Mr. Nick! I won't miss an inch!Phoenix:Got your glasses on, everybody...? Good. Now to check out the bottom of the pool.Spray OrlaPearl:Oh no! I'm so sorry! I got some on Orla by mistake!Athena:Calm down, Pearly! It's okay!Phoenix:Look! There are luminol reactions on Orla, too.Athena:The poor thing was bleeding yesterday... The luminol must be showing her injuries.Phoenix:But wait a minute. Ms. DePlume said the blood disappeared when Orla put on her hat.Athena:Huh? So shouldn't her injuries be under her hat?Phoenix:(If this blood isn't from Orla's injuries, then what could it be?)Spray Orla (subsequent times)Phoenix:There are luminol reactions on Orla, too.Athena:The poor thing was bleeding yesterday... The luminol must be showing her injuries.Phoenix:But wait a minute. Ms. DePlume said the blood disappeared when Orla put on her hat.Athena:Huh? So shouldn't her injuries be under her hat?Phoenix:(If this blood isn't from Orla's injuries, then what could it be?)Spray skull rockPearl:Look! I see something!Athena:If your deductions are correct, Boss, I guess this luminol reaction means... ...that the victim hit this skull-shaped rock when he fell to his death...Phoenix:I guess so.Skull Rock added to the Court Record.Spray skull rock (subsequent times)Athena:If your deductions are correct, Boss, I guess this luminol reaction means... ...that the victim hit this skull-shaped rock when he fell to his death...Phoenix:I guess so. The luminol doesn't lie, after all.After spraying Orla and skull rock:Phoenix:I guess that's about it for inside the pool.Athena:Then let me just get a quick photo to remember the occasion by! It's not every day we get to see the bottom of an aquarium pool! Yeah! That's a good shot!Pearl:I'll mark where the luminol reactions were.Athena:Yay! My first collaborative work with Pearly!Pool Bottom Photo added to the Court Record.Phoenix:(Huh? I hear something...)Orla:Fweet............Athena:Orla...? Boss! Something's wrong with Orla!Phoenix:What?! You're right! She's listless... and she's sinking!Pearl:Oh no! Maybe it's because of that luminol I got on her! Wh-What do we do, Mr. Nick?!Phoenix:We can't do anything for her ourselves! Let's get Dr. Crab!Athena:I'll run and get him!Crab:What's Orla's condition?!Phoenix:She's listless and sinking! Maybe she's unconscious?Crab:The pool is drained. Son of a gun! Who did this?! She'll drown unless we do something. ...Here. Give me a hand.Phoenix:Huh? Us?Crab:No, I meant the Steel Samurai. Of course you! Just help me!Athena:What...? A-All right! What do you want us to do?Crab:There's no time to fill the pool to get her up to the top. Get the orca stretcher! It's a piece of black cloth with a skull and crossbones on it. Looks like a pirate flag. When the stretcher is ready, press the hoist button!Phoenix:Okay! We're on it!ExaminePirate flagPhoenix:So this pirate flag is a stretcher for the orca, huh?!Athena:We can't use it with all this stuff on it! Let's clear it off!Crab:Good! Now push the hoist button and lower the stretcher! The control panel is on the wall to your right!Control panel (after examining pirate flag)Leads to:\"Ah! This must be the button to move the hoist...!\"TalkOrla's conditionCrab:No time for chit-chat! Get going on that stretcher! Both Orla's right- and left-brain hemispheres are completely asleep now! She'll drown if we don't do something!Phoenix:What does the stretcher look like again?Crab:It's a piece of black cloth with a skull and crossbones on it. Looks like a pirate flag. Once the stretcher is ready, press the button on the control panel to move the hoist! And hurry! I have to get back to prepping her!Phoenix:Ah! This must be the button to move the hoist...!Phoenix:Dr. Crab! The stretcher is ready!Crab:Good! Let's get it under Orla!Crab:I'll take it from here. Stand back. I have to treat her immediately... Hmm... There's something in her stomach...Crab:There. I got it all out.Athena:Will Orla be all right, Dr. Crab?!Crab:Yes, she'll be fine. She's just sleeping now. Orcas are mammals, so they won't die if they're out of the water for a little while. But their own weight puts stress on their organs, and their skin starts to dry out. I put some of my special handmade cream on her skin as an emergency measure.Athena:Feel better soon, Orla...Pearl:Oh, if only I hadn't gotten that luminol on her...!Crab:Luminol? Nah, no problem there. That stuff just washes right off. Orla's condition has nothing to do with you, young lady.Pearl:Really? Then what is wrong with Orla?Crab:I don't need to share that information with you people! It's none of your business. ...I have to get back to my rounds, so I'll leave the rest to the crew. Please keep an eye on Orla while I rouse up some crew members.Phoenix:(Dr. Crab sure is acting funny... He seems to be hiding something... Maybe we should check on Orla's condition before the staff get here.)ExamineLadderPhoenix:(I guess we don't need to examine the bottom of the pool again.)Control panelPhoenix:(This is the button we used to raise Orla in the stretcher. There's no need to push it now.)OrlaAthena:Orla! Open your eyes!Phoenix:I know how you feel, Athena, but we'd better let Orla rest right now.Athena:How did this happen? Mr. Wright! We have to examine her ourselves, right now!Phoenix:I wish we could, but we're lawyers, remember?Athena:But there must be something we can do!Phoenix:Well, we can investigate the cause of her condition. (Didn't we have evidence that might tell us something about the cause...?)HatsPhoenix:Look at all those pirate hats! Orla must really love those things.Athena:The pirate hat, the star above her eye, and her white mustache are her trademarks! Without those things, she'd look just like any other orca.Phoenix:Even with a hat, she still looks like any other orca to me...Athena:I bet no ordinary orca could do that lifesaver trick! Hmph! How could you lump Orla in with all the other orcas like that, Mr. Wright?!Phoenix:(Oops. I forgot how much of a fan Athena is.)Wanted posterAthena:Hey, there's a poster of Mr. Rimes here.Phoenix:\"Wanted,\" huh? Very piratey. Looks like they list the staff's likes and nicknames and other stats, too.Athena:And there's a reward amount listed, too.Phoenix:A reward?Athena:Yeah, they have this special event where they give you a prize for tagging a staff member. The bigger the reward listed, the better the prize. The crew tries hard not to get tagged... Sounds like my type of event! I would totally DOMINATE in a game like that!Phoenix:(Uh-oh. Her competitive fire is starting to blaze out of control.)Extracted fishLeads to:\"We should check out the contents of Orla's stomach... I guess...\"Phoenix:We should check out the contents of Orla's stomach... I guess... Hey, I see something mixed in with the fish.Athena:It looks like a medicine capsule. There's something written on it. I think it says... \"3 Zs\"... What would it be doing in Orla's stomach?Mysterious Capsule added to the Court Record.Athena:I wonder what kind of medicine it is? Let's ask Dr. Crab. It might have something to do with Orla's condition!Phoenix:...Maybe we'd better not ask. He must've noticed it himself, yet he didn't mention it. I think he's hiding something about Orla's condition. If we show him the capsule, he might try to take it away from us.Athena:Yeah, I guess he was acting pretty sketchy. Okay, let's look into it ourselves, then.Phoenix:Good idea. When we get back to the office, we can ask for Apollo's help.Athena:I guess that wraps up our investigation here. Orla still isn't fully awake yet... Oh, here comes some staff! Looks like they're going to put Orla back into the pool.Phoenix:And I guess they're going to fill the pool back up. I bet that will take a while... Well, I guess we can leave Orla in the staff's capable hands now.Athena:...Right! So, where to now?!Phoenix:Let's head to the show stage next. If we're lucky, the police will be done with the place.TalkWhat to doPhoenix:We're starting to get quite a bit of evidence. I still can't figure out who the culprit is, though...Athena:Maybe we should look for information in other places besides the crime scene! Investigating is key, but questioning people is vital, too! I know! Let's make it a competition to see which of us can find the best evidence! The loser buys the winner a glass of OJ!Phoenix:All right. Fine. (Whatever.)Any ideas?Athena:Why are the Swashbuckler Spectacular songs Ms. DePlume and I know different? I get the feeling it has something to do with this case...Phoenix:Hmm... Why would there be two songs...? It must mean something...Athena:I hate it when I don't know the answer! I'm going to go for a little run to let off steam!Phoenix:Athena, wait! Better not. You might forget what made you want to let off steam in the first place.PresentMysterious CapsuleAthena:That's the capsule from Orla's stomach, isn't it? It says \"3 Zs\" on it. I wonder what this drug does?Phoenix:I don't know, but maybe it had something to do with Orla's mysterious condition.Athena:Who would do such a thing to Orla?! If I get my hands on them, I'll... I'll rip them to shreds, that's what I'll do!!Phoenix:Let's just stick to lawful acts, shall we?Wright Anything Agency (after examining extracted fish in Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool)TalkThe investigationPhoenix:Would you like to help out with the investigation, Apollo?Apollo:You bet I would!

Sorry I got upset... If there's anythin' I can do to help Sasha, just say the word.Pearl:Marlon, you can trust in Mr. Nick. I'm going to do what I can, too, with this forensicking kit! I'm going to cover this whole area with forensicking!Rimes:Thatta girl, Small Fry! You can have free rein of this place!Phoenix:(I want to check this place out, but I'd better talk to Mr. Rimes, too.)ExamineSkeletonAthena:Eeeeek! There's a skeleton adrift!Phoenix:!Athena:Heh heh. It's just a prop. Were you really scared?Phoenix:A little bit... (...by your screaming.) Is this skeleton an enemy defeated by Orla's pirates?Athena:No, he's an informant named The Skeleton Kid. A dashing, spirited character, neither friend nor foe!Phoenix:So you're saying he's alive in the show?Pirate shipPhoenix:This galleon was in the Swashbuckler Spectacular, too, wasn't it?Athena:Look at that cute figurehead! It looks just like Orla!Phoenix:It is cute, but it looks like it's also a cannon.Athena:The enemy lets their guard down and then, blam! Very piratey, don't you think?Phoenix:I thought Orla and Sasha were supposed to be the good guys?Athena:We should do the same thing in court! Lure 'em in and then, blam! Present evidence!Phoenix:I don't think the judge would appreciate any \"blamming\" in his court.WaterAthena:Look at this pool! It's huge! So this is where they do the Swashbuckler Spectacular.Rimes:This show pool is the same depth as the orca pool. They practice the tricks in the orca pool, and then do the real show here. Are ya interested in the Swashbuckler Spectacular?Athena:Oh, of course! I've only seen it on TV, though.Rimes:Well, I'm new here, so I've never even seen it once.Phoenix:Athena is a big fan. She watches the recording over and over.Athena:I love the show and the ocean! Standing here makes me feel like I'm at the beach!Phoenix:Especially with it open to the sky. You can even hear the sound of the surf nearby. Why don't you take a dip in the pool?Athena:Really?! I can?! In that case...Rimes:What?! What are ya talkin' about?! You can't swim here!Phoenix:We were just joking.Athena:Right...... O-Of course! I was just joking, too!Phoenix:(Don't tell me she was actually going to do it...)LadderPhoenix:This ladder only goes down to the surface of the water.Athena:Well, it's not like a public pool. Everybody who gets into this pool knows how to swim. Just like in the courtroom! It's sink or swim in there! A newbie could really get hurt. You know, like last time in court... I could've really gotten injured. I was an inch away from getting attacked by a witness.Phoenix:(Yeah... A trial with Apollo can be a pretty dangerous affair...)HoistPhoenix:We saw this same device in the orca pool room, too, huh?Athena:Yeah, we used it to lift Orla when she was on the stretcher. In the show, Sasha makes her grand entrance by hanging from this thing! Ooh! We should think of a cool, grand entrance for us, too!Phoenix:I've always wanted to burst into the middle of somebody else's trial with a loud bang!Athena:I've always wanted to crash in through the ceiling! I bet that would really knock the socks off the judge and the gallery!Phoenix:(Just what exactly was this girl learning while she was in Europe?)SignPhoenix:This colorful sign... Did Ms. Buckler make it? (Changed from [This colorful sign... Did Ms. Bucker [sic] make it?] in the original release)Rimes:Wow! How did ya know? Yeah, that sign is for the new show. Before she went to clean, she painted it and left it to dry. She told me to keep an eye on it while I was takin' care of the orca.Athena:Huh? Isn't that the skull rock there on the right?Phoenix:Mr. Rimes, is the skull rock a part of the set for the new show?Rimes:Yeah, I guess so.Phoenix:(If they were going to use it in the show, what's it doing in the orca pool?)Skull Rock updated in the Court Record.Athena:This sign is so eye-catching, with all those twinkling stars!Rimes:I think they're supposed to be starfish. It's for the pirate show, after all.Phoenix:(Hmm... A few of them look more like leaves to me...)Handmade Sign added to the Court Record.Rimes:Sasha put so much effort into makin' this sign for the new show... No wonder she was mad about what happened...Phoenix:(Huh? I wonder what he's talking about? I'd better ask...Sign (subsequent times)Phoenix:This colorful sign... Did Ms. Buckler make it?

No wonder she was mad about what happened...Phoenix:(Huh? I wonder what he's talking about? I'd better ask...After examining water and sign:Phoenix:(We've examined pretty much everything here, but...)TalkHelping with cleaningPhoenix:I hear you helped Sasha with the cleaning, Mr. Rimes.Rimes:Well, not really \"helped.\" I was just takin' care of the orca here while she cleaned. Sasha felt bad for making Orla stay up so late, so she asked me to give her a snack. It was a little bit less than her ordinary meals, but she seemed satisfied. Oh, yeah. And I put Orla on the transport stretcher, too.Phoenix:Transport stretcher?Rimes:See that hoist up there on the right? The stretcher can be suspended from it. This stage show is right next to the orca pool room... ...and we use the hoist to move the orca or cargo between the two areas.Phoenix:So the rail we saw in the orca pool room runs all the way here, huh?Rimes:Why? Did ya wanna take a ride?Athena:Aerial investigation, huh? Sounds good to me!Phoenix:No, no. That's okay. (I like my investigations on sweet terra firma.)Rimes:Actually, the hoist can only be operated from the orca pool room.Phoenix:(Oh, that's right. I remember seeing the hoist control panel in there...)Rimes:So, I'm sorry, but I can't give ya a ride without somebody on the other end.Phoenix:No need to be sorry. (Whew... Dodged that bullet...)About the murderAthena:If it wasn't Ms. Buckler or Orla... who else could've killed Mr. Shipley?Rimes:Well, I know Sasha is innocent, but I'm not so sure about the orca...Phoenix:What? But we proved her innocence in court this morning.Rimes:But a few days ago, that orca attacked Sasha right here in the show pool! I saw that orca take Sasha's body into her mouth and squeeze her chest!Phoenix:(Her chest...?)Athena:They were probably practicing the lifesaver trick.Rimes:But Sasha was being crushed so bad, she couldn't even blow the whistle. I wanted to help her right away, but... I hate to admit it, but I froze. I... I'm a weak man. I can't protect anyone...Phoenix:I doubt there are many people who would pit themselves against an orca.Rimes:Everybody tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn't give up on practicin'. When we said Orla could kill her, she said she trusted Orla!Athena:Yeah... While everybody else seems to think Orla is a killer...Rimes:How can ya trust a creature that can't speak? You can't even know what it's thinkin'.Athena:But with orcas and dolphins, you can have communication of the heart.The new show (appears after examining sign)Phoenix:You say Ms. Buckler was mad... Was it because of the new show?Rimes:Ugh... Me and my big mouth. Okay, but ya never heard it from me! There was a rumor that the captain wasn't gonna let Sasha be in the new show.Athena:Whaaaaaaat?! But why not?!Rimes:I dunno. It was just a rumor. I don't know if it was true...Phoenix:So Mr. Shipley was going to do the show all by himself?Swashbuckler Flyer updated in the Court Record.Athena:I can't even imagine the show without Ms. Buckler! It would be like, \"Where's the beef?\"Phoenix:(Is she trying to say it would be like bones without any meat on them...?)Rimes:Sasha wanted to go back to the old Swashbuckler Spectacular. But now that the captain's gone... who knows what's gonna happen with the show...The new show (subsequent times)Phoenix:You say Ms. Buckler was mad... Was it because of the new show?Rimes:Ugh...

But now that the captain's gone... who knows what's gonna happen with the show...PresentCalendarRimes:That's Sasha's calendar. ...Sorry I didn't tell ya sooner.Phoenix:Well, I guess you were worried about Ms. Buckler. It's understandable.Rimes:I dunno why she was supposed to meet with the captain... ...but I know she definitely didn't kill him. She'd never do anythin' like that.Athena:We know that. And we're going to prove it in court!Rimes:If ya mess up, I'm gonna write a rap dissin' you two! And even before it comes out on CD, I'm gonna play it all over the place!Phoenix:...What does \"dissing\" mean?Athena:To \"diss\" somebody means to insult them or put them down. It's short for \"disrespect.\"Phoenix:...Ouch. That's harsh.After clearing all Talk options and examining water:Pearl:Mr. Nick! I found some peculiar fingerprints.Phoenix:(Pearls! I almost forgot she's been \"forensicking\" for me all this time.)Pearl:Oh! Who's that?Phoenix:Prosecutor Blackquill! What are you doing here?!Blackquill:............Just some business to attend to.Fulbright:Prosecutor Blackquill insisted, so I brought him along to get a little exercise.Athena:Is it business with us...?Blackquill:...No, not you. My business is with that animal keeper there. Marlon Rimes... You will be a witness for the prosecution tomorrow.Rimes:Ya gotta be kiddin'! Why would I wanna testify against Sasha?!Blackquill:What you \"want\" does not matter. ...Now, come along.Rimes:But if I leave, who's gonna feed the orca? The other animal keepers are too scared to go near her now.Pearl:Um, maybe I can help? I'm concerned about Orla's health... and this way, I can stay close and look after her. I can feed her and do a telecast, too, if you need me to! I'll do anything to help!Phoenix:(Sounds like Pearls wants to do something nice for Orla and make sure she's okay.)Rimes:Small Fry! Are you trippin'? That orca is... dangerous, ya know.Pearl:Hee hee. I'll be fine. I'm just happy to help. Oh! But I don't have a TV phone... I won't be able to contact you if I have to do a telecast... Marlon, may I please borrow yours?Rimes:What? ...Sure, Small Fry. Anythin' for you! Especially when you're goin' out of your way to help like this. I dunno if I'm gonna testify, but I guess I can at least hear what the police have to say.Fulbright:Thanks for your cooperation! Now, justice will be served... with a strategy meeting!Athena:Grrr! C'mon, Mr. Wright! Let's get back to our investigation!Blackquill:............Hmph. How sad. The police have already investigated all there is to investigate. Your efforts are a waste of time.Phoenix:Nothing we do to try and save our client is a waste of time, Prosecutor Blackquill.Blackquill:Today, the orca. Tomorrow, Sasha Buckler. You intend to save them both? Hmph. You say you \"believe\" in your clients, but isn't money really your true motivation? Why not admit you're only doing this for your own benefit? I could understand that much more readily than your empty, righteous talk.Athena:Our own benefit?! That's not why we're doing it!Phoenix:Now, Athena. Try not to let him get to you.Fulbright:All right! We should be off, Prosecutor Blackquill! In justice we trust!Athena:Grrr! I've never been so insulted! Be right back! I need some water to wash away the anger.Phoenix:(Uh-oh. She hit Prosecutor Blackquill with that water... He doesn't seem to care, though.)Pearl:Hmm... I guess prosecutors these days are more about harsh monochrome than fancy frills...Phoenix:Oh, wait! What about those peculiar fingerprints you said you found, Pearls?Pearl:Hee hee. I'll tell you all about them!ExamineWaterAthena:Wow! This pool is about the same size as the orca pool! This is where they do the Swashbuckler Spectacular.Phoenix:You're a big fan, aren't you, Athena? You watch that recording every chance you get.Athena:I get so excited watching the pirates do battle! It makes me want to put just as much passion into our battles in court!Phoenix:That's what I like to hear.Athena:Maybe I should get a pirate outfit to wear in the courtroom?Phoenix:I don't think you have to go quite that far.SignPhoenix:This colorful sign... So Sasha was the one who made it, right?Athena:Yup. Before she went to clean, she apparently painted it and left it to dry. There's a picture of that skull rock for the new show on the right.Phoenix:(If they were going to use it in the show, what's it doing in the orca pool?)Athena:It's really eye-catching, with all those twinkling starfish!Phoenix:I don't think you can say \"twinkling\" when you're talking about starfish... Besides, a few of them look more like leaves to me.Athena:Oh, you're right. Maybe Sasha forgot to finish painting them?TalkPeculiar printsLeads to:\"So tell me about this big discovery you made.\"Phoenix:So tell me about this big discovery you made.Pearl:Well, I don't know if it's a \"big\" discovery, but... ...I found some odd fingerprints on the pool ladder over there.Phoenix:Okay... So what's so peculiar about them?Pearl:Well, they're on the left side of the ladder, but they're right-hand prints. Wouldn't a person usually hold the left side of a ladder with their left hand? Plus, I think they were made from above by grasping the ladder with the right hand.Phoenix:Hmm... Now that you mention it, that IS strange. I wonder whose prints they are?Pearl:I compared them with the prints on file, and they turned out to be Marlon's.Phoenix:(How did he manage to leave prints in such an awkward position?)Pearl:So, Mr. Nick, was I helpful?Phoenix:Yes, you were. Thank you very much, Pearls. (I don't know if they're related to the case yet, but I'll keep them in mind...)Ladder Prints added to the Court Record.Athena:Hee hee. I bet Detective Fulbright doesn't know about these prints! I imagine their search wasn't as thorough here as it was at the crime scene.Phoenix:You're probably right. I'm sure they checked everything at the actual crime scene. But I guess they can't do forensics on every inch of the rest of the aquarium.Athena:But we could, thanks to Pearly! And now we have a new piece of information!Pearl:Ooh, you're embarrassing me, Athena!Rifle:*kree!*Athena:Hey, it's Rifle! We've got to catch her!Pearl:Don't worry. She's being a good girl right here on my lap.Phoenix:Ha ha! Well, I'm glad she's been found. (I forgot we were looking for her, actually.)Athena:............ Yeah, thanks again to Pearly...Phoenix:(I think somebody's jealous...)Pearl:Well, I think I'll go talk to the staff about Orla.Phoenix:All right. Good luck, Pearls! And thanks again!Phoenix:Well, I guess we're done with things here. What do you want to do next?If Mysterious Capsule was presented in Wright Anything AgencyAthena:They ought to be done with Sasha by now, too.Phoenix:True. Let's stop by the detention center and let her know we can take on her defense.Leads to:\"July 21Detention Center - Visitor's Room\"If Mysterious Capsule was not presented in Wright Anything AgencyAthena:How about if we have Apollo check out our mystery evidence?Phoenix:(Oh, that's right. We haven't done that yet.) Good idea. Let's stop by the office.July 21Wright Anything AgencyApollo:Oh, you're back! How is the investigation going?Phoenix:It's going pretty well, but there are still things we need answers to.Apollo:Let me know if there's anything I can do to help!After presenting Mysterious Capsule:Athena:I wonder if they'll let us see Sasha now?Phoenix:It has been quite a while. Let's stop by the detention center and see. We have something to deliver to her, too, don't forget.Leads to:\"July 21Detention Center - Visitor's Room\"July 21Detention Center - Visitor's RoomAthena:All right, Boss! Chin up! We have to lift Sasha's spirits!Phoenix:Ha ha ha! I like your enthusiasm!Buckler:Ahoy there, me hearties! Thank ye for comin'! Arr! I be in good spirits! Worry not about me!Athena:............She's trying to cheer us up.Buckler:Well, that went over like a lead balloon... I was trying to make up for all your trouble.Phoenix:Maybe the two of you need to take it easy. (I guess they both had the same idea.)Athena:We came to let you know that we can take on your defense, if you'll have us!Buckler:WHAAAAAAAAAT?! ............!Phoenix:I-Is something wrong? (Why is she hiding from us?)Buckler:P-Prosecutor Blackquill said... ...th-that you two would... abandon me... But here you are... t-to my rescue...! That's why... I-I'm so happy...!Phoenix:(It sounds like she's crying back there.)Athena:O-Of course we wouldn't abandon you...! Uuuuuugh... Sasha...! Don't cry!Phoenix:Maybe the two of you need to take it easy. (Great, now I've got crying in stereo...) (Changed from [Maybe the two of you need to take it easy. (Great, now I have crybabies in stereo...)] in the original release)Buckler:Okay! I'm all right now! Thank you for taking on my case!Athena:We're glad to do it!Phoenix:Well, now that you're smiling again, we have a few questions to ask you.TalkAbout the murderPhoenix:On the night before the murder, did you enter the orca pool room alone?Buckler:That's right. On July 20th, from 3:00 to 6:00 AM, I was there cleaning and organizing. The captain and I were actually supposed to clean together starting at 4:00 AM, but... ...we got in a fight. I couldn't face him, so I went an hour early and started cleaning.Athena:What does the orca pool room cleaning involve?Buckler:Well, first we have to move Orla to the show stage pool before we get started.Phoenix:(Mr. Rimes mentioned he took care of Orla in the show stage pool.)Buckler:After Orla was moved, I drained the pool and rearranged the equipment and props.Phoenix:And did the captain ever show up?Buckler:4:00 AM came and went, but he never showed. I bet he was mad at me... I wish I'd apologized to him, instead of being all prickly and angry like a scorpionfish...Orla (before presenting Prescription Bag)Athena:I'm glad we could prove Orla's innocence, but we didn't know you would get arrested.Buckler:Ha ha ha. As long as Orla is safe, I'm happy. I'm so glad I found you two! You guys are the best!Athena:I'm glad you found us, too! YOU'RE the best, Sasha!Buckler:I never imagined Orla's tricks would ever be used to commit a crime...Phoenix:Could you tell us more about the lifesaver trick?Buckler:Yeah, sure! There's a little speaker on the captain's clothes and on the training dummies. That speaker can emit sound waves. When a trick command is issued with the whistle... ...Orla uses the sound waves as a guide to find the person she's supposed to rescue.Phoenix:I see. Does anybody else know about how that trick works?Buckler:The entire crew knows about it. But it takes quite a bit of practice to be able to command the lifesaver trick. It wouldn't be easy to do for anybody who wasn't a trainer.Phoenix:(And that's why they suspected Sasha...)Buckler:And Orla can only perform one trick per signal. In other words, she can't perform two tricks at a time.Whistle updated in the Court Record.Phoenix:(Wait... So she can't do the singing trick and the lifesaver trick at the same time...? So what was that song Ms. DePlume heard?)Athena:Oh, Mr. Wright! I just remembered! We have to return something to Sasha.Phoenix:Oh, yeah. You're right. (I have it right here in evidence... And we have to give Sasha that item Detective Fulbright gave us, too.)Orla (before presenting Prescription Bag; subsequent times)Athena:I'm glad we could prove Orla's innocence, but we didn't know you would get arrested.Buckler:Ha ha ha.

So he said he wouldn't put me in the new show. See? I'm not in the new flyer.Athena:Oh, you're right! It's just Orla and the new adversary, Redstache.Buckler:I was so upset and frustrated... I was still crying when I went to do the cleaning. And I cried for quite a while before I drained the pool, too. But then, you know what? Orla did a trick to try and cheer me up. She acted out the scene where she defeats the giant octopus by spiking a ball at it! She spiked that ball so hard, she even ended up breaking off one of the octopus's legs.Phoenix:...What a dramatic way to cheer up a friend.Buckler:So that's why we argued, because he wasn't going to put me in the new show. But I was determined to be in the show yesterday. It was July 20th, you see... The anniversary of the death of the trainer before me... ...Azura Summers.Phoenix:...The person Norma DePlume wrote about in her book.Buckler:I wanted to explain to the audience that it was an accident, not murder. That's why I wanted... that's why I NEEDED to be in that show so bad... So during the cleaning, I moved the skull rock to the orca pool.Athena:What? But why?Buckler:It was a key prop. I figured the new show couldn't go on without it. I thought they'd be forced to switch back to the old show.Phoenix:(Wow... That was pretty extreme...)Skull Rock updated in the Court Record.Phoenix:(So Sasha moved the skull rock to the orca pool at the time of the cleaning... And if there's blood on that rock... ...then that must mean that the victim's death occurred after the rock was moved.) Around what time did you finish up the cleaning?Buckler:It was about 6:00 AM.Phoenix:(So that places suspicion on whoever met with the victim after 6:00 AM...)Reason for the fight (subsequent times)Phoenix:Why were you arguing with Mr. Shipley?Buckler:The captain knew about my heart condition, and he was worried about me.

She was a year older than me. She taught me all about how to command Orla.Phoenix:(I bet Azura and Sasha were like sisters to one another.)Buckler:She was the one who taught me the signals for the singing and lifesaver tricks, too. After she died... I swore on this charm... I vowed to become a great trainer someday, just like Azura!Phoenix:What is that charm?Buckler:It's a keepsake to remember Azura by. She always wore it. She told me once that she and her boyfriend had matching charms... I never found out who he was, so I couldn't give this one to him... I've had it ever since.Phoenix:You're keeping the memory of Ms. Summers alive.Buckler:The captain always carried around a memento of Azura, too: her walkie-talkie.Phoenix:(Huh? Did the victim have a walkie-talkie on him? Maybe I should show Sasha the victim's photos and see what she has to say.)The ship's doctor? (appears after \"Azura Summers\", then presenting Photo of the Body)Phoenix:What did you mean by \"protect Orla from the ship's doctor\"?Buckler:You know, Herman Crab. Ever since the accident a year ago, he's been completely different. When Azura died, he said he was going to \"euthanize the orca\"! Before that, he always used to say that euthanizing animals was a despicable act!Athena:Euthanize the orca...? That's horrible...Buckler:They all thought that Azura's death was the orca's fault. Nobody believed in her but me... The ship's doctor always keeps poison to euthanize the orca with on hand. And if Orca had been pronounced guilty in yesterday's trial, he would've used it!Phoenix:He was going to put her down right away?Buckler:That ship's doctor was close with both the captain and Azura, you know... I think he hates Orla...PresentCalendarPhoenix:This is your calendar, isn't it, Sasha?Buckler:Huh? No, mine's at the aquarium.Phoenix:Yeah? Mr. Rimes said he found this one in the nap room.Buckler:Huh. I didn't think anybody else at the aquarium used a calendar like that...Phoenix:(The owner of this calendar had a meeting scheduled with the victim. This mystery person might be the killer! We'd better find the calendar's owner...)Calendar updated in the Court Record.Calendar (subsequent times)Phoenix:This is your calendar, isn't it, Sasha?Buckler:Huh?

We'd better find the calendar's owner...)\"The Killer Killer Whale\"Buckler:Grr! That lady! Do you know what kind of terrible things she wrote about Orla?!Phoenix:So you knew about this book?Buckler:Yeah. I wish I didn't, but all kinds of people kept showing it to me. I tell you, I've haddock enough of that woman and her book!Phoenix:(Ah, okay. I see what you did there...) So what do you think about what happened that day?Buckler:...It must've been some kind of accident. I believe in Orla's innocence.Athena:I can sense you really do believe in her, from the bottom of your heart. Well, we believe in her, too!Phoenix:That's right. After all, she was proven \"not guilty\" in this case, too. We believe in the both of you.Prescription BagPhoenix:Detective Fulbright asked us to give you this medicine.Buckler:Arr! That bilge-suckin' blaggard had the spine to send me a gift?! Dread Pirate Nostache! Don't stand there gapin' like a weak li'l minnow! Have at ye!Athena:Ooh, a real swashbuckling battle! ...Arr! If it be a fight ye want, a fight ye shall have!Phoenix:Could you two please not drop into show mode out of the blue?!Buckler:Okay, sorry about that. ...Yeah, I'll take that medicine.Phoenix:(She's acting kind of funny...) What is the medicine for, by the way?Buckler:Ugh... Well, I guess I can't keep it a secret from you two... I... I suffer from a heart condition.Athena:A h-heart condition...? Then you'd better get to the hospital right away!Phoenix:Take it easy, Athena. She's in detention, remember?Buckler:Don't worry. it's not as serious as it sounds. They can fix it with surgery...Athena:NOT SERIOUS?! A heart condition is a heart condition! Don't tell us not to worry!Buckler:Yeah, I'm sorry... The captain was just as mad at me the day before yesterday... We both got so worked up, at one point, it was like a shark-eat-shark situation.Phoenix:(Whew. That sounds scary...) Do you mind if I ask more about that fight?Prescription Bag (subsequent times)Buckler:! How did you...?Phoenix:Detective Fulbright gave it to us.Buckler:Arr! That bilge-suckin' blaggard had the spine to send me a gift?!Phoenix:Whaaaaaaat?! S-Sasha...?Buckler:Dread Pirate Nostache! Don't stand there gapin' like a weak li'l minnow! Have at ye!Athena:Arr! If it be a fight ye want, a fight ye shall have!Phoenix:Could you two please not drop into show mode out of the blue?!Buckler:Oops! Sorry about that. Now what were we talking about? Orla...?Phoenix:(...Hmm. I get the feeling Sasha was trying to divert the topic away from that medicine...)Photo of the Body (after clearing \"Azura Summers\" Talk option)Phoenix:The victim didn't appear to have a walkie-talkie with him at the time of his death.Buckler:Huh? But I talked to the captain on his walkie-talkie before I started the cleaning.Phoenix:But there's no walkie-talkie shown in these crime scene photos.Buckler:I don't understand it... The captain always kept that walkie-talkie with him...Athena:Maybe the culprit took it away?Phoenix:(Hmm. Maybe... But what would be the point of that? I'd better organize the data I have on the victim in the Court Record...)Shipley's Autopsy Report and Photo of the Body consolidated.Buckler:The captain always kept that walkie-talkie by his side. It was the walkie-talkie Azura used right up until her death. In the middle of the show, the orca brought Azura up to the surface in her mouth. She left tooth marks in Azura's walkie-talkie... The captain said he always kept that walkie-talkie with him so he'd never forget...Phoenix:(So the walkie-talkie was really important to the victim...)Buckler:But... now the captain is dead, too... I'm the only one left who can protect Orla from the ship's doctor!Phoenix:(Protect Orla from the ship's doctor? I wonder what Sasha means?)After clearing all Talk options and presenting Calendar:Phoenix:(I guess we'd better look into Dr. Crab a little more.)Athena:Boss, let's go see Dr. Crab!Phoenix:I was just thinking the same thing. We have a lot of questions to ask him.Before clearing all Talk options and presenting Calendar in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:July 21Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' DangerAthena:Dr. Crab! We found Rifle!............Athena:No answer.Phoenix:I guess nobody's here. Why don't we come back later?July 21Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' DangerPhoenix:Oh, it's Pearls... and Rifle. What are you doing here?Pearl:Rifle came in here, so I followed her.Phoenix:(Oh, that's right. We were supposed to deliver Rifle to him. I completely forgot.)Pearl:Oh! Rifle!Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! What are you doing? Stop that!Crab:You silly mother penguin! What if you injured my spectacular, genius brain?!Phoenix:D-Dr. Crab...? Are you all right?Crab:Huh? Oh. It's you people. I see you brought Rifle for me.Phoenix:Uh... Rifle was really laying into you...Crab:Well, she hates me because she thinks I took her baby away from her.Sniper:Peep!Rifle:*kree!* *kree!* *kree, kree!*Phoenix:(Gee, Rifle looks so... happy... Is she actually playing with Sniper...?)Rifle:*kree, kree, kree!* *kree, kree!* *kree, kree, kree!*Crab:Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Stop all this cacophony!Athena:The biological parent and the caregiver parent, locked in a struggle over the child...Crab:*panting* Do you think you could hold this silly mother penguin down for me?Pearl:All right! I will try!Rifle:*kree*... *kree, kree!*Phoenix:Um, what are you doing? (I think Rifle just threw something up.)Crab:Oh, I'm getting food for Sniper out of Rifle. Mother penguins stock up food for their babies in their stomachs. They break it down in there so that it's easier for the baby to eat.Athena:Wow. You sure know a lot about animals.Crab:...You're trying to pick a fight with me again, aren't you, young lady? Yes, I know a lot about animals. I am a licensed veterinarian. Hmm... Rifle certainly is in a bad mood, even for her.TalkRifle's conditionPhoenix:Is Rifle okay?Crab:...Hold on. I'm checking her now. Girl in the strange outfit... Could you turn Rifle over on her back, please?Pearl:All right. Rifle, I'm just going to turn you over, okay?Crab:Hmm? What's this? The bottom of her feet are pink.Athena:Oh, no! Wh-What kind of sickness is that?! We have to get her to a doctor!Phoenix:Athena, get a hold of yourself. Dr. Crab is a veterinarian, remember?Crab:...It's just something she stepped in, by the looks of it. It's her stomach that's the problem. There's still something in there... Here we go!Rifle:*kree, kree*... *KREEEEEEE!*Crab:...Hmm. Looks like she swallowed something odd. I know this penguin will eat anything, but where did she pick up something like this? Son of a gun... I'll have to talk to Marlon about her care...Athena:Dr. Crab, may we see what was in Rifle's stomach?Crab:Huh? Please be quiet. I'm busy right now.Athena:Busy? But you're just staring at that weird machine.Crab:I'm checking to see when Rifle ingested the foreign object!Athena:He just keeps looking at that machine. He won't even glance our way.Phoenix:(Now I'm really curious to know more about his monitoring system.)Monitoring system (appears after \"Rifle's condition\")Phoenix:Could you tell us about the monitoring system you have here?Crab:It's a collection of electronic medical records for all the creatures here. With this system and the camera footage, I can monitor the creatures 24/7. I won't tell you any more than that. It's private, company business.Phoenix:But medical records are usually just a history of past medical exams and data. I never heard of any that could monitor 24/7.Crab:............Good point, Mr. Lawyer. I can see there's no fooling you.Phoenix:But why would you want to fool me?2 PSYCHE-LOCKSPhoenix:(This guy's going to be a tough nut to crack.)Crab:............I have my reasons.The charm (appears after \"Rifle's condition\")Phoenix:(Huh? This looks like the charm Sasha had...) Dr. Crab, do you know anything about this charm?Crab:Charm...? Hey! Leave that alone! That belonged to Azura! What was Azura's charm doing in Rifle's stomach...?!Phoenix:(That's odd... When Sasha was telling us about the charm earlier... ...Sasha said that she had Azura's charm. But that charm is still at the detention center... Hey, wait a minute! Didn't Sasha say Azura and her boyfriend had matching charms? So this second charm must be the one that belongs to Azura's boyfriend.) Dr. Crab, is it possible this charm belongs to Azura's boyfriend...?Crab:I refuse to talk about such personal details of the deceased. Subject closed!Phoenix:A-All right... (He sure is touchy when it comes to Azura...)Charm added to the Court Record.Phoenix:Azura Summers... Yesterday was the anniversary of her death, wasn't it?Crab:...That's right. She was killed by the orca.Athena:Do you really think Orla killed her? I... I don't believe it!Crab:Who can say if the orca did it on purpose? But the fact remains that she killed Azura. I was right there, the day of her death a year ago... I saw the orca bite Azura with my own eyes.Athena:But... is that really the whole truth of what happened...?Phoenix:I guess only Orla knows what really happened... both a year ago and this time...The charm (subsequent times)Phoenix:(Huh? This looks like the charm Sasha had...) Dr. Crab, do you know anything about this charm?Crab:Charm...? Hey! Leave that alone! That belonged to Azura!

They're just electronic medical records and feeds from security cameras. With these, I can monitor all of the animals 24/7.Phoenix:...And I say that's not true. I have proof that you can't monitor the animals 24/7 with this system.Present Security FootagePhoenix:Leads to:\"The security camera doesn't begin recording until 10 AM.\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Phoenix:This is the evidence that you can't monitor the animals 24/7!Crab:The only thing that evidence proves is that you are mistaken, Mr. Lawyer.Phoenix:Ugh... (I guess I got it wrong.) But I still say it can't be true. And that's because...Leads back to:\"I have proof that you can't monitor the animals 24/7 with this system.\"Phoenix:The security camera doesn't begin recording until 10 AM. If that's the case, how could you possibly monitor the animals 24/7?!Crab:Okay. You got me. I guess that was a pretty weak explanation.1 LOCK BROKENCrab:You're right. I guess I can't monitor the animals 24/7. But if I see anything unusual on the camera feeds, I can spring to action right away. And if I can examine an animal, I can usually tell exactly what is going on with them.Phoenix:(Wow. He's really confident in his abilities.) But I still say you can't do that 24/7.Crab:But I'm here at the aquarium most of the time. And I can go anywhere at any time to examine an animal.Phoenix:Anywhere? I say that's not true, either. I have proof that there's a place you can't go!Present Security CardPhoenix:Leads to:\"The only people who have access to the orca pool room are the owner and Sasha.\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Crab:...Do me a favor and come back later, would you? I'm going to get a little more sleep.Phoenix:W-Wait! (I guess I got it wrong...)Crab:I'm telling you, I can go anywhere at any time to examine an animal. Why are you trying to argue that I can't?Phoenix:Because I know it can't be true.Leads back to:\"I have proof that there's a place you can't go!\"Phoenix:The only people who have access to the orca pool room are the owner and Sasha. So how can you say you monitor all of the animals?Crab:Son of a gun. So you knew about the security card, did you?1 LOCK BROKENUnlock SuccessfulCrab:Yes, tighter security was imposed on the orca a year ago as a precaution. Due to Sasha's objections, I wasn't allowed to have a card.Phoenix:(I guess she was trying to protect Orla from him...) So you're monitoring the animals with a system that's \"private, company business.\" But I have to insist you tell me about this monitoring system.Crab:Now YOU'RE trying to pick a fight with me?! Very well. I suppose it's only fitting that the spoils go to the victor. I'll tell you about Shipshape Aquarium's ecological data organization system.Monitoring system (after breaking Psyche-Locks)Phoenix:So what does that machine you were using do?Crab:It's a system of ecological data organization developed in Europe. I call it the TORPEDO! What do you think? Pretty impressive name, isn't it?Athena:\"Torpedo\"? As in \"Man the battle stations!\" and all that?Crab:No, no! It's the name I gave to this data organization system. \"TORPEDO.\" It stands for \"TeleObservation Realtime PErtinent Data Organizer.\"Phoenix:(Okaaay... But is it SuPer-Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected?) (Changed from [Quite a name... I wonder if it's super admin restricted desktop access pass-protected.] in the original release)Crab:The TORPEDO collects data through sensors placed on or near the subjects. Temperature, heartbeat, vocalizations, etc. It gathers this information 24 hours a day. All of this data is then sent to my terminal and these monitors.Athena:Wow! This TORPEDO sounds amazing! Does Rifle have a sensor on her, too?Crab:Yes, she does. Where and what kind of sensor is attached depends on the animal. The penguins have theirs attached to the ID tag at the base of their flipper. The TORPEDO doesn't tell me where Rifle is when she escapes, though. It's hard to attach sensors to the orca or fish, so theirs are on the tanks themselves. Places where the creatures don't normally live, like the show stage, don't have sensors. ...Okay, here we go. It's telling me the time Rifle swallowed the foreign object... \"Approximately 4:00 AM on July 20th\"... What an odd time...Phoenix:(That was when Sasha was doing the cleaning.)Athena:Maybe that's why she wouldn't take my fish, because she was full from the night before. But at least Orla ate it, so that's okay.Crab:Orla ate another animal's food? That's odd. She's never done that before. And then she had that episode, too... I'd better take a look at her data... ...Huh? She didn't eat anything from the evening of the 19th to yesterday afternoon.Phoenix:So Rifle had a late-night snack, but Orla went hungry, huh?Crab:It appears so... But let's see... She's been eating normally since yesterday afternoon. ...Come to think of it, Jack was supposed to feed Orla yesterday morning... Maybe he died before he had the chance...Phoenix:(I'm worried about Orla's condition. I'd better remember this TORPEDO data...)TORPEDO Data added to the Court Record.Phoenix:(Hmm... I still wonder why he wouldn't tell us about the TORPEDO...)Monitoring system (after breaking Psyche-Locks; subsequent times)Phoenix:So what does that machine you were using do?Crab:It's a system of ecological data organization developed in Europe.

(appears after \"Monitoring system\")Phoenix:Dr. Crab, why did you want to hide the existence of the TORPEDO system?Crab:...Well, it's a safe system that has been approved for use in other countries... ...but it hasn't been legally approved in this country yet. That's why I always carry this terminal around with me. It's not something I want the police poking their nose into...Athena:You mean... you're breaking the law?!Crab:Which is why I was keeping it a secret. It would create a problem for the aquarium. I had Jack's permission. He felt the animals' care was more important than the legality. But we wanted to shield the rest of the staff, so we kept it a secret.Athena:But breaking the law is breaking the law!Crab:...But, in some cases, lives can be saved by breaking the law. Do we simply allow the lives of our animals to be lost while we wait for laws to change?Athena:............Ugh. Now you're twisting things around...Phoenix:I'd like to use this evidence during the trial tomorrow. But it may result in you and Shipshape Aquarium being brought up on charges...Crab:Well, I followed my own convictions, and I have no regrets. You're only doing your job. I can't blame you for that, Mr. Lawyer.Phoenix:...I appreciate that.*peep, peep, peep.* *peep, peep, peep.*Phoenix:What's that sound? Another penguin...?Crab:............That's my ringtone.Athena:Gee, Dr. Crab sure likes cute things.Phoenix:...Maybe he wanted it to sound like Sniper?Crab:Hello? Crab speaking... Son of a gun! You people again?! Stop harassing this aquarium! Orla was found not guilty! Why on earth should she be put down?! Huh? Come there on the 26th and explain? Fine. Just let me write it down in my... Son of a gun! Where did my calendar go?Phoenix:(His calendar! Could he be talking about THAT calendar...?)Crab:...I realize that. If it comes to that, I'll use that drug to euthanize her.Phoenix:!Athena:Mr. Wright! He s-said, \"euthanize her\"!Phoenix:We'd better ask him more about this.

You heard that?Phoenix:(Who didn't hear that?)Crab:It was the Center for Dangerous Animal Control, calling with a demand. They said that the orca may have been found not guilty this time... ...but that if she ever attacked a human again, we would have to put her down.Athena:Put her down?! But that's horrible! Did you agree to their demand?Crab:...Animals sometimes do attack humans. And, of course, humans sometimes do kill animals to protect themselves. If it comes to that, yes, as a veterinarian, I am prepared to carry out euthanization... ...using this poison.Phoenix:(Huh?! That capsule... It has the same letters on it as the one that was in Orla's stomach!

I guess you're crazy about penguins?Crab:Somebody gave it to me, okay?! Now, please don't tell anybody about it. It's embarrassing. Azura designed this calendar. This one here is a prototype. She designed a calendar for this year, and then she died before it went on sale...Athena:Were you and Ms. Summers... romantically involved?Crab:What?!

I just thought I sensed a hint of romantic feelings...Crab:She was my co-worker. Nothing more than that. Now, if you ask me any more inane questions, I will lose my patience!Athena:Sorry about that. I guess I touched a nerve.Phoenix:It seems everybody here at the aquarium loved Azura Summers.TORPEDO DataCrab:Ah, you're interested in my TeleObservation Realtime PErtinent Data Organizer?Phoenix:Your \"TORPEDO,\" huh? So it allows you to gather data and observe all the animals?Athena:Gee, Dr. Crab. The names you pick all seem to have something to do with weapons.Crab:Well, I do make a hobby of collecting air guns in my spare time. I picked \"Sniper\" and \"Rifle\" from a list of over one hundred gun name candidates.Phoenix:What were some of the other names on the list?Crab:\"Grenade\" and \"Launcher.\" \"Revol\" and \"Ver.\" Things like that.Athena:Couldn't you come up with anything a little cuter?!Crab:What? But those names are so cool! The young lady apparently just doesn't understand the masculine spirit.Phoenix:Oh, well... You know... (Apparently, I don't, either.)After clearing all Talk options and correctly presenting Calendar:Phoenix:Please let me ask you one more question, Dr. Crab.Crab:What is it, Mr. Lawyer? You look so grave.Phoenix:I heard something disturbing from the writer Norma DePlume...DePlume:The center demanded that the aquarium put the killer whale down a year ago.Athena:P-Put her down?!DePlume:But the aquarium owner refused their demand, saying it was an accidental death. But I hardly think a persistent organization like that would just give up and go away. I'm quite sure the power of money helped convince them!Phoenix:What makes you think that?DePlume:Once a month, the owner and the vet disappear from this aquarium. And I came to find out that, each time, a large amount of money was being paid out!Phoenix:I think Shipshape Aquarium might be keeping some kind of secret... ...and that it has something to do with the recent murder!Crab:............!5 PSYCHE-LOCKSPhoenix:(F-Five Psyche-Locks?!)Crab:That writer...

You couldn't possibly have any more questions for me!Fulbright:Well, you see, we're having a little problem... We were going to call the animal keeper as a witness for the prosecution... ...but he's being very stubborn and refusing to testify.

Now, if you would please come along with me!Crab:Well, it looks like we'll have to continue our talk at the trial tomorrow.Phoenix:I don't know what secret you and this aquarium are hiding... ...but I'll uncover it if it'll help save Ms. Buckler.Crab:Give it your best shot, then. I'll see you tomorrow.Athena:Well, it looks like we'll be going up against Dr. Crab in tomorrow's trial.Phoenix:I bet he'll be one tough customer.Athena:Okay, we'd better get our evidence organized for tomorrow!Phoenix:(I'll have Athena hold on to the evidence I don't think I'll need in court.)Evidence has been re-organized................ ............Beep.Phoenix:Hello?Apollo:Mr. Wright!

Trucy and I will be here!Phoenix:Well, we'd better get back to the office and get ready for tomorrow. What are you going to do, Pearls?Pearl:I thought I'd stay overnight here and be with Orla and Rifle. I'll be ready for a telecast during the trial tomorrow! Good luck to both of you!Athena:Thanks, Pearly!! That way, when we prove Sasha's innocent she can see Orla right away!Phoenix:(I'd love to see Sasha and Orla back together again, both free and clear!

But I do admit... they were friends... But would Azura send Dr. Crab videos, I wonder...?Phoenix:Videos? What do you mean?Buckler:Azura used to send her boyfriend videos of herself teaching the orca tricks. I used to help Azura take the videos on her TV phone.Phoenix:(Hmm. This is an interesting bit of information...)TV Phone updated in the Court Record.Phoenix:So TV phones can shoot videos, too, huh? My dumb phone sure can't.Buckler:These TV phones are amazing! They can even record sounds you and I can't hear! All the equipment we use at Shipshape Aquarium is high-tech. The ship's doctor sends away for all kinds of electronics.Phoenix:(So all the high-tech stuff is Dr. Crab's doing, huh?)Buckler:Anyway, I still highly trout Azura's boyfriend was the ship's doctor.Phoenix:But Dr. Crab found a charm yesterday, and he was really shaken by it.Crab:Charm...? Hey! Leave that alone! That belonged to Azura! What was Azura's charm doing in Rifle's stomach...?!Phoenix:That charm looked just like your keepsake of Azura.Buckler:Yeah, well... She did say she and her boyfriend had matching charms... Was the ship's doctor and Azura really a couple...? I-I can't believe it!Phoenix:I think Dr. Crab will be called as a witness today. There are still so many unanswered questions... ...but I hope to solve them all in today's trial.Buckler:I believe in you two! I know you can do it.Athena:And we WILL, Sasha! We promise!July 22, 9:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4Day 2Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge: Court is now in session for the trial of Sasha Buckler.Phoenix:The defense is ready-- AAAAAGH!Blackquill:............Ready.Phoenix:(...Now I'm completely thrown off...)Judge:Very good. It appears both the prosecution and the defense are ready. Yesterday, it was proven that the orca was not guilty and that the victim fell to his death. Prosecutor Blackquill, did your investigation of the orca pool area turn up anything?Blackquill:............Hmph. It did. We found a bloodstain from the victim at the bottom of the pool. ...On this.Judge:Oh, my. What a frightening-looking rock. And you say it has a bloodstain on it? Hmm. Just looking at it gives me the willies. So can we assume that there was no water in the pool at the time of the incident?Blackquill:............Very good. What a clever little deduction.Judge:Ho ho! Well, it's nice to get a compliment from the prosecution for a change.Athena:Prosecutor Blackquill has completely tamed the judge with his carrot-and-stick approach.Phoenix:(...I guess I should've brought a few carrots of my own.)Blackquill:Right. Moving along. I have prepared a witness. Buckler was the only one who entered that room when there was no water in the pool. The witness will prove that. ............Come to the stand, witness.Blackquill:............Name and occupation.Crab:Dr. Herman Cr--Sniper:Peep!Crab:Sniper! Stay in there!Judge:And who is that cute little creature?Blackquill:Hmph. Such a restless bird. Quite unlike Taka.Taka:Graaaaaw!Sniper:Peep!Phoenix:(Wow... Chalk one up for Taka... He shut Sniper up with a single sound.)Crab:Son of a gun... Dr. Herman Crab, Shipshape Aquarium's veterinarian.Judge:...And could you tell us the name of your cute little friend there, as well?Athena:Your Honor, please focus on the case!Judge:But it's important to learn all we can about the witness!Crab:This is Sniper.Sniper:*peep!* *peep, peeeeep!* *peep, peep, peep, peep!*Crab:She's the offspring of a penguin named Rifle. Sniper lives in my hair. She might cause a commotion now and then, but please try to ignore her.Blackquill:I was originally going to call the animal keeper to the stand... ...but he refused to testify, so I settled on the veterinarian. ............Now tell us. Why was the defendant in the orca pool room when the water was drained?Witness Testimony-- Cleaning the Orca Pool Room --Crab: In the early morning hours of July 20th, Sasha was cleaning the orca pool room.Sasha and Jack Shipley, the owner, were scheduled to do the cleaning together.During cleaning, the pool water is drained.While the cleaning was going on, Marlon was taking care of the orca in the show pool.The pool water would never be drained unless the pool was being cleaned.Judge:Hmm. And your claim is that the victim was made to fall to his death during the cleaning?Blackquill:............Hmph. Only Buckler and the owner had the security card necessary to enter the orca pool room. And we already know from the security company's record of card usage... ...that the defendant was in the orca pool room during the time of cleaning. The witness's testimony and the record of security card usage are conclusive evidence.Judge:So no one beside the defendant was at the scene, and the water in the pool was drained.Phoenix:Uh-oh... The judge already seems to be leaning toward the other side.Athena:We have to strike fast... Your Honor, we're ready for our cross-examination now!Judge:Oh! Yes, of course... Please proceed, then.Phoenix:(The power of youth comes in handy at times like these.)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Cleaning the Orca Pool Room --Crab: In the early morning hours of July 20th, Sasha was cleaning the orca pool room.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Why is the cleaning done so early in the morning--essentially the middle of the night?Crab:Our aquarium is open every day of the year, without break. So of course the cleaning has to be done at night when there are no visitors. Blackquill:Hmph... No days off, is that it? I can relate to that...Phoenix:(Yeah, I guess prisoners don't get to take days off...) Athena:Things SURE are different around OUR office, huh, Boss?!Phoenix:You don't have to rub it in quite so enthusiastically. Blackquill:So, was the defendant cleaning alone?Crab:No.Crab: Sasha and Jack Shipley, the owner, were scheduled to do the cleaning together.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:But Ms. Buckler said that Mr. Shipley never showed up to help with the cleaning!Crab:I don't know anything about that. All I know is what was on the schedule. Maybe they changed plans. They probably felt awkward with each other after their fight.Phoenix:In any case, there's no proof the victim entered the orca pool room during cleaning!Blackquill:Blackquill:If you don't stop your yammering, I will pull your tongue out and barbecue it.Phoenix:Gah... (Do you have to be so violent...?) Blackquill:Proof or none, the victim must have entered the pool room during cleaning. Witness, tell him why.Crab:Jack must have entered the orca pool room. The reason I think so is because...Adds statement \"The record of card usage shows that Sasha entered the orca pool room.\" if not already addedCrab: The record of card usage shows that Sasha entered the orca pool room.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Don't you mean to say that the record shows both of their cards being used?Crab:No, only Sasha's. But they must have gone in together. Jack's body was found in that room, so that's the only logical explanation. Blackquill:We talked about this just yesterday. What purpose does that brain of yours serve?Phoenix:Gak!Crab:You're even more birdbrained than Rifle.Blackquill:Blackquill:Witness, I will not allow birds to be belittled in my presence! Limit your disparaging comments to the defense alone!Phoenix:(So I get disparaged either way. Great.) Crab:Hmph. Bird lover, huh? I guess we're not destined to become best friends.Blackquill:That is fine. All I need is for you to talk about the state of the scene during cleaning.Crab:All right. Fine.Phoenix:(Oh, I don't know.

They use the hoist there to lower themselves to the bottom of the pool. They can do regular cleaning with water in the pool, but this was an intensive session. I never clean my own lab, however...Phoenix:...Don't you think it might be due, then...? (I guess I can't talk, though...) Crab:Well, Sasha and Marlon come in and clean it for me on occasion. But I'm too busy, myself. I have animals to look after. Like this one, for example. Judge:Such an adorable little creature! It lends cheer to this bleak courtroom. Blackquill:...Your reaction to Taka was very different, as I recall...Judge:O-Oh, T-Taka is a fine bird, too, of course! ...Please continue, Dr. Crab. Quickly, now. Crab:As I was saying, Sasha was cleaning the orca pool room...Crab: While the cleaning was going on, Marlon was taking care of the orca in the show pool.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So Orla was moved all the way over to the show pool? Why is that?Crab:Well, it wouldn't do to get her covered in cleanser, would it? Of course she was moved! You don't take a bath while you're cleaning the tub, do you?Judge:Excellent point. I usually clean the tub after I take a bath, myself. Blackquill:Hmph... I was assigned to clean the shower stalls yesterday. They were cleaner than an Edo bathhouse by the time I was done.

Without water, Orla would be all right for a short period of time. But anything longer than that would pose serious risks. She could even die. Phoenix:So the fact that Orla is alive and well is proof the water wasn't drained on her?Crab:That's right. The orca pool and the show stage pool are next door to each other.

So of course the cleaning has to be done at night when there are no visitors. Blackquill:Hmph... No days off, is that it? I can relate to that...Phoenix:(Yeah, I guess prisoners don't get to take days off...) Athena:Things SURE are different around OUR office, huh, Boss?!Phoenix:You don't have to rub it in quite so enthusiastically. Blackquill:So, was the defendant cleaning alone?Crab:No.Crab: Sasha and Jack Shipley, the owner, were scheduled to do the cleaning together.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:But Ms. Buckler said that Mr. Shipley never showed up to help with the cleaning!Crab:I don't know anything about that. All I know is what was on the schedule. Maybe they changed plans. They probably felt awkward with each other after their fight.Phoenix:In any case, there's no proof the victim entered the orca pool room during cleaning!Blackquill:Blackquill:If you don't stop your yammering, I will pull your tongue out and barbecue it.Phoenix:Gah...

But they must have gone in together. Jack's body was found in that room, so that's the only logical explanation. Blackquill:We talked about this just yesterday.

Limit your disparaging comments to the defense alone!Phoenix:(So I get disparaged either way. Great.) Crab:Hmph. Bird lover, huh?

Your Honor, please allow me to submit this photograph.Judge:............Oh! This is...!Phoenix:As you can see, there is no water around the skull rock area. With the pool in this state, the victim could have been made to fall to his death.

I would like you to make note of the entry for the day of the incident!Judge:Let me see, here... \"Meet the captain at the orca pool at 7 AM.\" This note is about a meeting planned with the victim!Blackquill:What?!Phoenix:The defense would like to argue that, at the time of that meeting... ...the pool may have been drained of its water!Judge:Wh-Whose calendar is that?!Phoenix:............It belongs to Dr. Herman Crab. Isn't that right, Dr. Crab?Crab:Son of a gun... So you suspect me, do you?!Judge:What is the meaning of this calendar entry, Dr. Crab? Explain yourself!Crab:Fine. I was supposed to meet Jack at the orca pool at that time. But... I ended up not going.Phoenix:So you're saying you simply broke your promise? You can't get out of it that easily. I believe you have some explaining to do.Blackquill:Blackquill:Your blade is sharper than I thought, Wright-dono. But your cut was shallow--a mere surface scratch. There's a saying amongst prisoners. \"Do not see, hear nor speak to smooth-talking lawyers.\" If you think the witness is suspicious, show your proof!Phoenix:Ack! (The calendar alone isn't good enough, huh? I have to prove the victim could have fallen to his death at that 7 AM meeting time!)Athena:Let's put our heads together, Boss! The victim could've fallen during cleaning, when the pool was completely drained... ...or, using the partition, it could've been at 7 AM, with the water partially drained. What would be the major difference in circumstance between these two possibilities?Phoenix:(Hmm... What circumstance was different...? The answer could really tell us something... What circumstance was different between the two possibilities of cleaning and 7 AM?)The pool was half filledPhoenix:If the murder was at a time other than during cleaning, the pool must've been half filled!Blackquill:I suppose there's half a possibility the pool was only half filled... ...but if you wish to make that claim, let me see your proof!Phoenix:Ack! Proof...? I... don't have any proof.Judge:In that case, there's much more than half a possibility that I will assign you a penalty.Phoenix:(I'd better rethink that. There must be some other circumstance that was different...)Leads back to:\"What circumstance was different between the two possibilities of cleaning and 7 AM?\"The orca was thereLeads to:\"If the murder occurred at a time other than during cleaning, the orca must've been there!\"The time of day was differentPhoenix:The murder must have been at a different time of day than the cleaning time!Blackquill:Wright-dono...

Stop yammering to each other and show me how you wield your sword!Phoenix:All right, then. My sword is poised and ready. If the murder was committed at a time other than during cleaning time... ...then Orla must have been present at the scene. If I can prove that the murder happened right in front of Orla... ...then I can prove that Ms. Buckler is not guilty!Judge:Order! Order in the court...! Mr. Wright! Are you implying that the orca was a witness to the crime?!Phoenix:That is exactly what I'm implying!Blackquill:Hmph. And...? How do you intend to prove the orca witnessed the murder...? What are you going to do, put the orca on the stand and cross-examine her?!Phoenix:(This is a critical point. I'd better think about it carefully...) The defense will...Cross-examine OrlaPhoenix:If I asked Orla if she witnessed the murder, I'm sure she would tell me everything!Blackquill:Really? How interesting... And how do you propose to communicate with the orca?Phoenix:Well, I... I'd have to think about that...Judge:Unlike some birds, an orca is incapable of human speech. No, I'm afraid I cannot allow you to cross-examine a creature that cannot speak. Unless the defense has some other way of communicating with the orca...?Phoenix:No... I'm afraid I don't, Your Honor.

Please let me try again, Your Honor!Leads back to:\"The defense will...\"Continue with CrabPhoenix:I'll continue my cross-examination of Dr. Crab!Crab:............Hmph. That's fine with me, but I've already said everything I have to say.

Let's see this evidence, then.

I have no idea how that evidence is relevant...Phoenix:(Hmm. I thought maybe if I presented it with confidence, it would all work out somehow...)Judge:Nothing to say for yourself, is that it, Mr. Wright?!Phoenix:(I must have some evidence here somewhere that shows Orla witnessed the murder!) Your Honor! Please allow me to present a different piece of evidence!Judge:Very well. Let's see this evidence, then.Leads back to:\"What evidence shows that the murder took place right in front of the orca?\"Phoenix:This photo indicates where we discovered luminol reactions yesterday. By accident, we got some of the luminol testing fluid on Orla. We were then very surprised to see... ...luminol reactions on Orla's body!Blackquill:Blackquill:So what of it? There's nothing odd about that. As was discussed in yesterday's trial, the orca was bleeding. Traces of the orca's blood were also found on the skull rock. The orca must have injured herself when she rammed the rock.Phoenix:(So that cloud of blood Ms. DePlume saw... ...was from Orla head-butting the skull rock, was it?)Skull Rock updated in the Court Record.Blackquill:Those luminol reactions you saw on the orca are most likely from her head-butting.Phoenix:Phoenix:But what's odd is the position of those bloodstains. Please take a good look at the photograph. Yesterday, Ms. DePlume said the blood disappeared when Orla put on the hat. That testimony indicated that Orla's injuries were under the hat area. However, these luminol reactions are in two entirely separate areas from her injuries. These bloodstains can't be Orla's own blood from when she was head-butting!Judge:Th-Then where did the blood come from...?Phoenix:It's my firm belief that it's the victim's blood. The victim was killed right in front of Orla... ...and the victim's blood splattered onto Orla's body!Blackquill:Gaaaaaaaaagh!Phoenix:(Now it finally all makes sense! Orla was a witness to the murder...! So THAT'S why...!)Athena:Orla? Boss! Something's wrong with Orla!Phoenix:What?! You're right! She's listless... and she's sinking!Phoenix:There's one more fact that indicates Orla was a witness to the murder.Judge:There's more?!Phoenix:(The culprit was afraid Orla could somehow reveal what she witnessed... ...and that's why they did what they did. It's the only thing that makes sense! I have to present that evidence...! ...That evidence that proves the culprit thought Orla was a dangerous witness!)Present \"3 Zs\" Sleeping PillPhoenix:Leads to:\"The defense would like to submit this evidence.\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Judge:And what is this?Phoenix:...Evidence, Your Honor!Judge:What I'm asking you is, what does that evidence have to do with anything?! Phoenix:............Judge:M-Mr. Wright! You don't even have an answer for me?! Your silence will be rewarded with a penalty. Phoenix:(The culprit was afraid Orla could somehow reveal what she witnessed... ...and that's why they did what they did. I have to present evidence to prove that!)Leads back to:\"...That evidence that proves the culprit thought Orla was a dangerous witness!\"Phoenix:The defense would like to submit this evidence.Judge:What's that? It looks like some sort of medicine...Phoenix:It's a sleeping drug, Your Honor, a very powerful one. The sleeping drug was discovered in Orla's stomach yesterday. The culprit tried to drown Orla by putting her into a deep sleep!Judge:Tried to drown the orca?! B-But... why?Blackquill:Wright-dono... are you trying to tell this court... ...that the perpetrator tried to kill the orca off to prevent a witness from talking?! Do you really expect to defeat me with that feeble attack?!Phoenix:My sword has been drawn. I'm not about to sheathe my evidence now. Orcas have an enormous potential for intelligence. The possibility that Orla could somehow manage to reveal the truth can't be denied. The culprit believed in this possibility... and that's why they tried to kill her! ............Dr. Herman Crab. You purchased this sleeping drug, didn't you?Crab:!Judge:Wh-What?! Does this mean the veterinarian tried to do away with the orca?!Phoenix:Who but a veterinarian would better know how to disguise an orca's death? He could even prevent the police from examining Orla's body!Crab:............Why, you... Are you actually accusing me of trying to murder the orca?! HOW DARE YOU?! HOW DARE YOU slander the noble profession of VETERINARIAN?!Athena:Eeeeeeek!Phoenix:(E-Eeek...!)Judge:My goodness! One could cut the tension in this courtroom with a knife.Crab:YES! I admit to purchasing that sleeping drug! However............ it was subsequently stolen from my lab.Athena:That's such a flimsy excuse!Crab:It's the truth. What else can I say? Any one of the crew members could have entered my lab.Phoenix:(I guess that weakens my evidence quite a bit...)Crab:...Besides, think about it for a minute. Who was it that treated Orla after she swallowed the drug? It was I!Phoenix:But as I recall, it took you quite a while to give that treatment. You didn't even come on your own. We had to go get you.Crab:............Son of a gun. You just remember all sorts of little details, don't you, Mr. Lawyer?Blackquill:The orca pool and the lab are far apart. It's little wonder he didn't know Orla's condition.Phoenix:Phoenix:Didn't know...? That's highly doubtful. As far apart as they were, Dr. Crab still had a way to know all about Orla's condition. The defense would like to submit evidence that the witness knew about Orla's condition.Present TORPEDO DataPhoenix:Leads to:\"The TORPEDO...\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Crab:You're on fire, Mr. Lawyer. It's too bad you're wrong. I couldn't tell the condition of a sardine with that, let alone an orca!Phoenix:Urk... No, huh...?Judge:What happened to your fire now, Mr. Wright? Let me rekindle it... with a penalty!Phoenix:(No matter how far away Dr. Crab may have been, there's one piece of evidence... ...that should have allowed him to realize Orla's condition!)Leads back to:\"The defense would like to submit evidence that the witness knew about Orla's condition.\"Phoenix:The TORPEDO...Crab:Gah! You just had to bring that up, didn't you?!Phoenix:With this advanced data system, surely you would have known Orla's condition!Blackquill:Blackquill:...Wait just one minute. What is this \"TORPEDO\"?Judge:Dr. Crab! How dare you bring a weapon of mass destruction into my courtroom!Phoenix:The TORPEDO, or \"TeleObservation Realtime PErtinent Data Organizer,\" is a data system. Until yesterday, only Dr. Crab and Mr. Shipley knew about the TORPEDO. It isn't legally approved in this country, so it was kept secret from the police.Judge:I-It's illegal?! Dr. Crab! I demand an explanation!Crab:............Son of a gun! You and your big mouth, Mr. Lawyer! Yes, it's true... I'm using an illegal system to monitor the creatures at the aquarium. The system uses sensors like these, and, yes, there's one in the orca pool, too. These sensors send sound waves through the water to gather data on the creatures. If it finds abnormalities in their condition, the TORPEDO alerts me with a sound.Judge:Oh, my goodness! How very high-tech! But if it's illegal, I will not turn a blind eye. This matter will be appropriately dealt with at a separate time. Now then, Mr. Wright. Please continue.Phoenix:With the TORPEDO, I'm sure Dr. Crab noticed the danger Orla was in... ...but he made no attempt to come to her aid on his own! And the reason for that is... that Dr. Crab wanted Orla dead!Crab:............The TORPEDO didn't give me a warning message. That's why I didn't know there was anything wrong with Orla. The sensor in the orca pool wasn't working during the police's investigation.Phoenix:Phoenix:Can you prove that statement?!Blackquill:Blackquill:............Heh heh. Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!Phoenix:(Wh-What's with him?)Athena:I guess this is all so high-tech for Prosecutor Blackquill that it's making him a little \"funny.\"Blackquill:\"Funny\"...? Yes, I find this all very \"funny.\" Witness, those \"sensors\" send sound waves through the water, correct? But what if there isn't any water?Crab:Then they wouldn't work. They would automatically switch off.Blackquill:I see... And where is the sensor in the orca pool located?Crab:I don't know. Jack is the one who attached it for me.Blackquill:You don't know? Then I will tell you. The police found a sensor just like the one you just showed us. They found it attached to the table at the bottom of the pool.Phoenix:Table...? Do you mean the table in this photograph?Blackquill:That's right. ............Don't you get it yet, Wright-dono? The table is on the skull rock side of the partition. It's affixed to the bottom of the pool, and can't be moved.Judge:Oh! And so if the water was drained from the skull rock side of the pool...!Blackquill:Precisely. Without water, the TORPEDO sensor would not work. Witness, when did that sensor automatically switch off?Crab:Hang on. I'll look it up. The only times lately were during cleaning two days ago and the investigation yesterday. Of course I knew the pool would be drained while they cleaned it... ...but I had no idea they drained it for the investigation. No one let me know. That's why I didn't know about Orla's condition yesterday.Phoenix:(So Dr. Crab really did want to save Orla...?)Blackquill:Heh heh. Did you hear that, Wright-dono? Yes, the water can be drained without harm to the orca if the partition is used. But if the water is drained from the skull rock side, the sensor turns itself off. If the sensor was always on except for during the cleaning and the investigation... ...it means there must have been water in the pool at all other times. It was never drained. In other words... no one but the defendant could have committed the crime!Phoenix:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!Judge:Order! Order in the court! This completely shatters the defense's argument!Phoenix:Ggg... B-B-But... The fact still remains that Orla was nearly killed with Dr. Crab's sleeping drug!Blackquill:Blackquill:But aren't you forgetting one important question? When was the sleeping drug given to the orca?Phoenix:...You're right. That hasn't been discussed yet, has it?Blackquill:The orca pool is the scene of the murder. The police were there all day yesterday. The only way to give the drug to the orca undetected is to put it in her food. Yesterday, someone gave the orca food during the trial.Judge:Someone did? I'm afraid I don't remember that.Blackquill:You don't remember? You're not THAT old yet, are you? ............It was the defendant, Sasha Buckler!Phoenix:Aaaaagh!Judge:Hmm... So that is the orca that stands accused, is it?Orla:Fwee, fweet!Phoenix:(Aw. She's waving her flipper at us. Maybe she's cheering us on?)Buckler:Orla, wish Phoenix and Athena luck!Orla:Fweeeet!Judge:So your argument is that Ms. Buckler is the one who gave the orca the drug?Blackquill:The prosecution's argument hasn't changed. Buckler made the victim fall to his death and then manipulated the orca to pin it on her. Still not satisfied, she further planned to kill the orca with the sleeping drug!Phoenix:(Hmm. I didn't hear any reports of Dr. Crab feeding Orla... Maybe he didn't have a hand in Orla's attempted murder after all... But is there anybody else who could've fed Orla, besides Sasha?)Judge:Hmm. If it's true the defendant is the one who fed the sleeping drug to the orca... ...then that places even more suspicion on her than ever.Phoenix:Phoenix:The defense objects to the prosecution's claims!Blackquill:Well, well. You still haven't admitted defeat?Phoenix:Prosecutor Blackquill. I don't appreciate the way you only mention the parts that are convenient for you.Blackquill:............Hmph.Judge:What do you mean by that, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:The prosecutor failed to mention that Ms. Buckler wasn't the only one who fed Orla! As you will all recall, there was another person who gave Orla food.Athena:O-Oh! You mean, that person...?Phoenix:(Looks like Athena remembers now, too.)???:Congrats, Sasha!Orla:Fwee, fweet!???:Time to celebrate! Go on! Eat up! (Changed from [This is to celebrate! Eat it all up!] in the original release)Orla:Fwee, fwee, fweet!Athena:Oh, Mr. Wright! No...Phoenix:(I don't want to believe it, either, but we can't ignore the truth... The other person who fed Orla during the trial was...)Present Marlon Rimes profilePhoenix:Leads to:\"Please recall when Orla was found not guilty yesterday.\"Present Sasha Buckler profilePhoenix:Phoenix:The person who fed Orla was... Sasha Buckler! (Changed from [The person who feed [sic] Orla was... Sasha Buckler!] in the original release)Blackquill:............That's what I've been saying all along! After the orca was falsely accused, the defendant planned to kill the orca. Phoenix:Oh, wait a minute...! I, uh... Huh? I was just trying to, er... confirm... that the defendant ALSO fed the orca...!Judge:That was already clearly established, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:Ugh... It was just a simple attempt at confirmation, Your Honor... (But there WAS another person who fed Orla during the trial...) Leads back to:\"The other person who fed Orla during the trial was...\"Present anyone elsePhoenix:Blackquill:I don't remember that person feeding the orca. Phoenix:...Oops. Uh, my finger slipped.Judge:You'll receive a penalty for that, Mr. Wright. Phoenix:(But, other than Sasha... ...there was one other person who fed Orla during the trial...) Leads back to:\"The other person who fed Orla during the trial was...\"Phoenix:Please recall when Orla was found not guilty yesterday. ...Marlon Rimes gave the orca a large quantity of food. If the sleeping drug was mixed in with that food... ...it could be given to the orca without arousing police suspicion!Judge:N-Now that you mention it, I do remember that flip-flopper feeding the orca!Blackquill:Blackquill:Hmph! So you remembered, did you? I see the time for a true sword fight has come. I call Marlon Rimes to the stand!Crab:............Mr. Lawyer. Both Miss Orca Lover and Marlon Rimes are important members of our crew. I don't want to suspect either of them, but I'm ready to accept whatever truth you find. Here. Take this.Phoenix:! That charm...!Athena:It's the charm that matches the one Azura Summers had, isn't it? So you and Ms. Summers WERE romantically involved, weren't you, Dr. Crab?Crab:What? No, of course not. Sorry to disappoint you, but this doesn't belong to me. At the time, I thought it was Azura's, so I grabbed it... ...But it wasn't hers. Now it's up to you, Mr. Lawyer, to figure out whose charm it is.Phoenix:...I will. Thank you, Dr. Crab.Crab:After all, I'm interested in the outcome of this trial, too...Judge:Now, then. Please summon Marlon Rimes to the witness stand!Rimes:Wh-What's going on? What's everybody makin' that face for? I haven't been watchin' the trial and nobody's told me anythin'.Judge:Marlon Rimes. You are under suspicion for the attempted murder of the orca.Rimes:............ I see... Well, if it's already out...Phoenix:M-Mr. Rimes...? (Is he really going to admit it?)Rimes:Fine. I'll tell the truth.Witness Testimony-- The Truth --Rimes:Sasha is lyin' to protect that orca.At 3:30 AM on the 20th, there was still water in the orca pool.The incident happened before the orca was moved to the show pool!Orla killed the captain by bashin' him thirty feet high and makin' him slam into the water! (Changed from [Orla killed the captain by bashin' him 30 feet high and makin' him slam down on the water!] in the original release)So I thought the orca should pay the consequences.Judge:Now we're back to the orca again?!Phoenix:(............ I did not see THAT testimony coming...)Athena:Now wait just one minute! Yesterday, Orla was proven innocent! Besides, you said Orla was in the show pool during the cleaning!Rimes:I didn't wanna sell Sasha out... That's I didn't tell the truth... But the fact is, all three of us -- the captain, Sasha and me -- were cleanin' the pool room. (Changed from [But the fact is, all three of us--Sasha, the captain and me--were cleanin' the pool room.] in the original release)Athena:But Dr. Crab and Ms. Buckler both said you were at the show stage...!Rimes:...Well, the only thing Dr. Crab knew about the cleanin' was what I told him. I didn't give him a whole lot of details, either. Maybe he misunderstood. And Sasha is lyin' to protect the orca. She can't tell the truth. Sasha put blood on the skull rock herself to make a fake bloodstain. I think it's pretty brave of her to let herself get arrested to protect the orca.Athena:Mr. Rimes! How can you lie like that?!Rimes:It's the truth! Besides, wouldn't it be better for you if I wasn't lyin'? If the orca did it, you win your case!Athena:What?!Judge:............ This is all very hard to believe... ...but if Mr. Rimes's story is true... ...Ms. Buckler would be innocent, and the orca would be the killer.Phoenix:! (Meaning, if we turned our backs on Orla... ...we could save Sasha...?!)Blackquill:Having a witness lie to save your own client? What a dirty, underhanded tactic, Wright-dono!Phoenix:Phoenix:Yesterday, the defense proved Orla was not guilty. We have no intention of going back on our assertions now!Rimes:What are ya sayin', Mr. Wright?! All ya gotta do is admit the orca did it, and Sasha goes free! Isn't a lawyer supposed to act in his client's best interest?!Phoenix:But that wouldn't be acting in her interest. Ms. Buckler believes Orla is innocent. And we, of course, believe that Ms. Buckler herself is innocent, too. Acting in the client's best interest is an important part of our job as lawyers. Using dirty means to win a verdict would destroy our client's faith in us.Athena:That's right! We believe in both Ms. Buckler's AND Orla's innocence!Rimes:Huh?! I just don't understand how ya can treat a human and an orca equally. Sasha or the orca? You can only save one of them!Phoenix:Ha ha ha. I don't know about that. I think I can save them both. All I have to do is disprove your testimony!Rimes:Oh, yeah? Then go ahead and try.Phoenix:I will do just that. (If I can't tear down his testimony, I won't be able to save both of them. I have to find a weak spot and start tearing!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Truth --Rimes: Sasha is lyin' to protect that orca.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What exactly do you claim Ms. Buckler is lying about?!Rimes:Sasha put that bloodstain on the skull rock and stuff herself, as false evidence. She left fake traces to try and save the orca! Blackquill:Blackquill:Witness, if you keep talking nonsense, I will seal your mouth shut. Phoenix:The defense supports the prosecution's idea!Rimes:But, Mr. Wright! My testimony helps your client! You oughta be happy... Phoenix:I want to save both Orla and Ms. Buckler.

Dr. Crab said that you were at the show stage. Blackquill:Blackquill:But it's possible that Dr. Crab was misinformed or that he misunderstood. The witness already explained this. Why are you taking this meaningless tack? If you want to play games, Taka here would be more than happy to \"play\" with you.Taka:Graaaaaw!Athena:We'd better be careful how we press the witness. Taka is watching us like a hawk...Blackquill:Witness. Continue.Rimes: The incident happened before the orca was moved to the show pool!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So you're saying the incident took place before the cleaning began?Rimes:Yeah, I guess so. The captain, Sasha and I were gonna do the cleanin' together. It's much more efficient than tryin' to have just one person do it alone. Blackquill:In the defense's case, however, more lawyers means simply... more lawyers. Nothing more. Athena:What?! You're one to talk! All you have on your side is a cantankerous bird!Judge:What about me?! I'm up here all alone!Rimes:...Are you people done?Blackquill:Hmph. You need the witness to keep you focused? For shame, Wright-dono.Phoenix:(Hey, I was the only one who kept my mouth shut!) Rimes:...Anyway, the incident happened in the orca pool before the cleanin' got started.Rimes: Orla killed the captain by bashin' him thirty feet high and makin' him slam into the water!

Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Sasha could be found guilty if we let her be! But if the orca died, Sasha could go free! I thought if the orca was already dead, Sasha might tell the truth and free herself. It might seem cruel, but a man-killin' animal has to be put down!Phoenix:The culprit must have tried to do away with Orla because she was a witness to the crime. But if Mr. Rimes is the culprit... why would he try to protect Sasha?Athena:Hmm... I'm sensing some very complex emotions from Mr. Rimes... I need more information before I can do a proper analysis!Phoenix:(If I'm going to tear down his testimony, then I guess I have to present evidence.)Phoenix:Of course we don't believe Mr. Rimes's testimony...Athena:But he's suggesting the murder took place in the orca pool...

(Changed from [The pool is about 65 feet deep and there's about 30 feet between the water and ceiling.] in the original release) If the pool was full of water as you claimed... ...it would be impossible for the victim to fall about sixty-five feet, as the autopsy states.

Such desperation. You look pale. Are you sure you're prepared to make this counterargument?Phoenix:(\"The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles...\" (Changed from ['A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets...'] in the original release) I'll never forget those words, no matter how many years go by. Even though it's probably just a bluff, I'll give it to them with a smile!) ...What if the scene of the crime was somewhere else?Judge:The scene of the crime?Rimes:Somewhere else...?Blackquill:What? You're finding fault with the police investigation now?Phoenix:As I understand it, the prosecution's argument is as follows. The scene of the crime was the orca pool room. Only the defendant and victim entered that room when there was no water in the pool. Therefore, only the defendant could have committed the crime.Blackquill:...That is correct.Phoenix:But if the scene of the crime was NOT the orca pool room... ...then somebody other than the defendant could have committed the crime!Athena:A-Are you sure you know where you're going with this?!Phoenix:I might not be too sure, but I can't back down now!Judge:Mr. Wright... I hope that I'm wrong, but this isn't one of your bluffs, by any chance...?Phoenix:Ha ha ha! Of course not! (...The judge knows me far too well.)Judge:And do you have a theory on where the actual scene of the crime was?Phoenix:Yes, of course! (Think, Phoenix! Think! Think of a place -- other than the orca pool room -- where one could fall to one's death!)Judge:Then, by all means, please share your theory with the court! Where was the real scene of the murder?Present Show PoolPhoenix:Leads to:\"The show stage pool might have been drained of water at some point as well!\"Present anywhere elsePhoenix:Phoenix:THIS was the actual scene of the murder!Judge:Really? Do you actually believe the victim was killed there?Phoenix:Well, when you put it like that... my response would have to be... a definite \"maybe.\"Judge:In that case... you will definitely be getting a penalty. No \"maybe\" about it.Phoenix:Ack...! This time, I promise to point out the true scene of the murder, Your Honor! Judge:You sound very sure of yourself for a man who just received a penalty. I hope you are right this time.Leads back to:\"Where was the real scene of the murder?\"Phoenix:The show stage pool might have been drained of water at some point as well! And, if so, it would be just as possible to fall to one's death there as the orca pool!Blackquill:............Wright-dono. What you're doing is a disgrace to your profession. I sincerely hope you have some basis for what you're suggesting!Phoenix:O-Of course I do! (I will... as soon as I think of something...!)Blackquill:The victim's body was found in the orca pool! How do you explain that?!Phoenix:Phoenix:How about if, after the victim was killed in the show stage pool... ...his body was moved to the orca pool...?Judge:\"How about if...\" What kind of presentation of your argument is that?! You had better have a reasonable explanation of how the body was moved!Phoenix:(There's no turning back now! I have to think of a way the body could've been moved! Was there something at the scene that could've been used to move the body?)Present hoistPhoenix:Leads to:\"The hoist runs between the orca pool room and the show stage.\"Present anywhere elsePhoenix:Blackquill:Totally misguided, completely wrong and astonishingly foolish!Phoenix:...Huh?Blackquill:How could anyone move a body with that?! Judge:Mr. Wright, please make it a habit to think before you speak!Phoenix:(Even though the two pools aren't all that far apart... ...it would still be pretty hard to carry a body all that distance. So the culprit must've used some kind of tool to move the body.) Leads back to:\"Was there something at the scene that could've been used to move the body?\"Phoenix:The hoist runs between the orca pool room and the show stage. The stretcher can be hung from the hoist to move things like Orla or the skull rock. The stretcher could also have been used to move the dead body!Judge:Hmm. Yes, if the stretcher can move the orca or the skull rock... ...it seems likely it could also move a dead body as well.Phoenix:(Wow! Somehow, that worked! I just might be able to pull this off!) If the show pool was the scene of the crime, somebody else could have done it!Blackquill:Blackquill:Hmph. You desperately spew conjecture and now you even make up a crime scene?Phoenix:Aaaaaaaaaaagh!Judge:Eeeeeeeeeeek!Athena:Not again?!Blackquill:You don't have the soul of a warrior. You don't deserve to be on the battlefield! And even your fabrication is half-baked. It's a disgrace!Phoenix:Wh-What do you mean, \"half-baked\"?Blackquill:The hoist can be operated from the orca pool room only.Phoenix:Gah...Blackquill:And the only person who entered the orca pool room was the defendant. So even if the body was moved... ...the only one who could have moved it was the defendant herself!Phoenix:NAAAAAAAARGH!Judge:Order...! So it comes back to the defendant, no matter which pool it was?Phoenix:(Meaning... I can't clear Sasha either way...? Sasha said she moved Orla and the skull rock... ...and I believe her. So could it be possible that she moved the body herself without being aware of it?!)Judge:Mr. Wright? Do you have an objection to Prosecutor Blackquill's claim?Phoenix:(Do I have an objection to the claim that the defendant moved the body?)You bet I have one!Phoenix:The defense has an objection!Blackquill:...Hmph. All right, fine. Let's hear this \"objection,\" then. Phoenix:Er... well... My objection is... (I can't admit I hadn't thought of one...)Judge:Mr. Wright, you just FELT like saying you had an objection, didn't you?Phoenix:...Yes, Your Honor.Judge:Well, I just FEEL like giving you a penalty!Blackquill:The hoist could only be operated from the orca pool room. Furthermore, the defendant is the only one who entered the orca pool room. Therefore, the defendant is the only one who could have moved the body. Phoenix:(There are no inconsistencies in Prosecutor Blackquill's claim itself. But the only things Sasha moved are Orla and the skull rock. So that must mean...

Leads to:\"Ms. Buckler must have been the one who moved the body...\"I have no objectionsPhoenix:I have............ no objections.Leads to:\"Ms. Buckler must have been the one who moved the body...\"Phoenix:Ms. Buckler must have been the one who moved the body...Blackquill:Wh-What?Judge:Mr. Wright! Are you admitting the defendant committed the murder?!Phoenix:...No. I'm simply conceding that she was the only one who could have moved the body. However, I contend Ms. Buckler was not aware that is what she was doing. The culprit made her move it, unbeknownst to her!Judge:The defendant moved a dead body without recognizing that it was a dead body? How could that be possible?!Phoenix:(The body was found in the orca pool. It must have been moved there somehow. I might find some kind of hint in the things she moved with the stretcher!) The culprit made Ms. Buckler move the body along with this piece of evidence!Present Skull RockPhoenix:Leads to:\"The skull rock...?\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Judge:Y-You're claiming the defendant moved the body with that?!Phoenix:It might seem surprising, but it's true.Blackquill:...Hmph. It's not \"surprising.\" It's \"absurd,\" which is no surprise, coming from you. Judge:I'm afraid I have to agree. Indeed, there's nothing else to call it but \"absurd.\"Phoenix:(Oops. Looks like I got it wrong. The only two things Sasha moved are Orla and the skull rock. Why was Orla ramming the skull rock? There must be an answer that explains everything!) Your Honor! Please let me give that another try!Leads back to:\"The culprit made Ms. Buckler move the body along with this piece of evidence!\"Judge:The skull rock...?Phoenix:Ms. Buckler told me yesterday that she moved the skull rock when she was cleaning. The only two things Ms. Buckler moved to the orca pool are Orla and the skull rock. I would like to suggest that the victim's body may have been inside the skull rock!Judge:Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!Blackquill:!Phoenix:Hidden inside the rock, the body could have been moved to the orca pool with the hoist. At the show stage, Marlon Rimes loaded up the skull rock, with the body inside... ...and then he used the walkie-talkie to let Ms. Buckler know the rock was loaded. Ms. Buckler operated the hoist from the orca pool room and moved the stretcher! She moved the rock without knowing the body was inside!Judge:Do you really think there's enough space inside the skull rock to place a body?Phoenix:The Swashbuckler flyer indicates it could be possible. Please focus on the question at the bottom left.Judge:Oh! It says, \"Who will obtain the gold coins hidden in the skull rock?!\" Hmm. In that case, I suppose the rock is most likely hollow.Phoenix:What's more, if the body was inside the skull rock... ...it explains the remaining unanswered questions.Judge:Such as...?Phoenix:Please take a look at the security footage of the scene Ms. DePlume witnessed. Where did the body that Ms. DePlume saw come from? Please recall... What was Orla doing to the skull rock at this time? She was head-butting it.Judge:Oh!Phoenix:That's right. Orla's ramming released the body from the skull rock! The body had been placed inside the skull rock and moved there from the show stage. I assert that the real murder scene was, in fact, the show stage pool!Blackquill:Blackquill:Hmph! What rubbish is this now? You don't have a single scrap of evidence!Phoenix:Phoenix:It's easy enough to verify what I say. Take a look inside the skull rock for yourself! You should find some kind of proof that the body was there. Blood, fibers, hair...Blackquill:Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Wright-dono...!Athena:Mr. Wright! Th-That was incredible! You turned things completely around! And to think! It all started with that half-baked bluff, too!Phoenix:Whew! That was a close one! (Did you really have to add that last bit?)Judge:If the murder took place at the show stage, then who is the perpetrator?Phoenix:It is, naturally, the person who was at the show stage.Rimes:............Phoenix:Mr. Rimes... Weren't you the one who loaded the skull rock onto the stretcher at the show stage?Rimes:........................ ............Heh heh. Wow, Mr. Wright. That was some pretty smart brainwork ya did there. To be honest, I never thought you could figure it out... I tried to protect myself, but I guess it came back to bite me...Judge:Are you confessing you gave false testimony before, Mr. Rimes?! That's perjury!Rimes:Yeah... What Mr. Wright says is true. The body WAS inside the skull rock. And it's true the captain was killed in the show pool, too.Phoenix:(What? He's admitting it that easily?!)Rimes:This time, I'm gonna tell ya the whole truth about what happened that day!Witness Testimony-- The Whole Truth --Rimes:In the show pool, the orca shot the captain up into the air!Then the captain came down and slammed into the water!I can still remember the spectators' screams clearly...All Sasha did was move the body! She was tryin' to protect the orca.When Ms. DePlume witnessed the orca findin' the body, I freaked.Judge:Hmm... So now we're back to the orca again, I see!Blackquill:If you were going to give testimony like that, why did I bother putting you on the stand?Rimes:All I'm doin' is tellin' the truth! That day, Sasha wanted to do the old version of the Swashbuckler Spectacular. So I suggested she hide the body in the skull rock and move it to the orca pool. I was gonna figure out what to do with the body after the show was over. The orca is the one that killed the captain! It wasn't me, and it wasn't Sasha!Phoenix:(So it was Mr. Rimes's idea to hide the body in the skull rock? But if Mr. Rimes is the culprit, why would he protect Sasha? False charges against Sasha would mean he himself would escape suspicion. So why...?)Athena:Mr. Wright, how about if you leave this to me?Phoenix:Athena! Do you mean... you heard something?!Athena:Yup, noise! Discord in Mr. Rimes's heart.Phoenix:So that means, somewhere in his testimony, there's an inconsistency in his emotions... All right, Athena! Give him a good counseling session!Athena:You got it, Boss! Huh? What's this?Phoenix:What are you getting, Athena?Athena:...Hmm... This testimony is pretty complex. Feelings of deep sadness and intense anger are being called up. Those two emotions appear to be running out of control!Phoenix:Out-of-control emotions...? Is that going to be a problem?Athena:We'll have to probe their cause if we want to get to his true emotions and testimony. There might even be odd or unnatural spots in his testimony he isn't even aware of.Phoenix:All right. Let's probe the cause of his out-of-control emotions, then!Athena:I'll explain how to probe. Let's find the root cause together. When you see something off in a statement, press \"Probe\" ([L / LB / Q])!

Let's concentrate on probing just one. He did make one odd statement I was wondering about... I highly doubt there were any spectators at the scene of the crime.Phoenix:Hey, good point! That just doesn't fit. It might be the cause of his out-of-control emotions. Let's try pointing to the spectators. (Changed from [It might be the cause of his out-of-control emotions.

That made the sadness subside. So maybe the \"spectators\" part was what was making him sad?Phoenix:I wonder why he would make that mistake, saying spectators were there? How strange.Athena:The only thing I can think of... is that he was mixing up one memory with another. Like... he was in a similar situation before, and it was deeply imprinted on his heart.Phoenix:(A situation where an orca killed somebody and there were spectators there...? Hey!

He's right... He wanted to kill the orca, and yet it was Jack Shipley who fell to his death. How did that happen? ...Wait a minute...! What if...?

Enough of these reckless words, without any basis in fact!Phoenix:Phoenix:They aren't reckless words! The basis for my claim is at the real murder scene... the show pool!Blackquill:What are you talking about?Phoenix:It's my contention that two incidents happened at the show pool. The attempted murder of the orca, and the victim falling to his death. First of all, in order to kill the orca, Mr. Rimes removed something from the scene. And, by so doing, he made it possible for Mr. Shipley to fall to his death.Judge:He did what now? (Changed from [What did he remove?] in the original release) Mr. Wright!

After all, Orla wasn't given anything to eat during that time.Rimes:How would ye know such a thing?!Phoenix:I know because of Orla's record here in the TORPEDO data system. This system continuously records data on the subjects it monitors. From Orla's record, we can tell exactly when she ate... or didn't eat.Rimes:Sink me! Nobody ever told me 'bout that dastardly contraption!Phoenix:Only a few of the Shipshape Aquarium staff know about this system. According to Orla's record, she never ate in those early morning hours of the 20th. You planned to kill Orla, and that's why you didn't feed her!Blackquill:Blackquill:Hmph. You're wasting time. What proof do you have of that? Perhaps the orca simply wasn't hungry?Phoenix:(Ack, he's right. I don't have any proof...)Athena:If Orla simply didn't eat, then that would create an inconsistency. Where did her fish go?Phoenix:(Her fish? Good question. Where did it disappear to?)Blackquill:Fish? What does it matter? What relevance does it have to the case? Cease this stalling with inconsequential questions! (Changed from [Cease this stalling by asking inconsequential questions!] in the original release) Stop delving into the depths of the orca's stomach and delve into the case instead!Phoenix:Phoenix:But wait! It may seem like a small inconsistency... ...but it's an issue of great importance. (I think.)Judge:What are you driving at, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:(How could the fish disappear? Somebody must have eaten it... So who came to the show stage and ate Orla's fish? I think I might have a pretty good idea...) I believe there must have been a visitor to the show stage that Mr. Rimes didn't notice.Blackquill:............Visitor? Are you trying to introduce yet another suspect at this eleventh hour? If you utter more of your careless remarks, Taka won't look favorably upon it!Phoenix:I don't plan to utter any \"careless\" remarks. (Whether my remarks will actually be related to the case or not, I don't yet know...)Athena:Don't worry, Boss. If Taka comes this way, I'll fend him off!

This was the visitor to the show stage!Sasha BucklerPhoenix:I believe that Sasha Buckler visited the show stage!Blackquill:The defendant...? What basis do you have for that claim?Phoenix:The fact that Orla's fish disappeared. Ms. Buckler must have eaten up all of the fish meant for Orla!Blackquill:...Is this some kind of jest?

Orla's snack was a small quantity of fish. Even a penguin could have eaten it all.Rimes:Begad! Rifle ate Orla's fish...? Who be ye to say Rifle ate Orla's fish? She could have picked up food anywhere! But that doesn't change the fact that I really WAS at the show stage. After all, I had to help move the skull rock. It couldn't have been moved without me!Blackquill:The witness claims he never saw the penguin. How do you explain this contradiction?Phoenix:(Both Mr. Rimes and Rifle were at the show stage, but Mr. Rimes didn't see her. So where could Mr. Rimes have been at the time?)Blackquill:Wright-dono, if you aren't up to the task... ...I could disprove this witness's testimony for you...Phoenix:(If I leave it to Prosecutor Blackquill, Sasha will be declared guilty. I can't let him interrupt this line of reasoning!)Athena:Mr. Wright! Let's try to figure out how things looked when Rifle came to the show stage.Phoenix:Mr. Rimes was at the show stage, keeping an eye on Orla and the sign.Athena:And we know it must be true, because he helped move the skull rock.Phoenix:And then Rifle came in and walked over the sign...Athena:But wouldn't Mr. Rimes notice Rifle if he was right there?Phoenix:Well, let's think about where Mr. Rimes could have been... Is there a place in the show stage area from which Rifle couldn't have been seen?Present waterPhoenix:Leads to:\"What?! Inside the pool?\"Present anywhere elsePhoenix:Athena:Do you really think he was there? That doesn't seem right to me, somehow...Phoenix:Hmm. Now that you mention it, maybe you're right. Athena:Come on, Mr. Wright! We're all counting on you, here! Try to imagine yourself as a high-powered attorney!Phoenix:Okay, I'll do my best. (Um, what's with the \"imagine\" part?) Okay, let me try to figure out where Mr. Rimes must have been.Leads back to:\"Is there a place in the show stage area from which Rifle couldn't have been seen?\"Athena:What?! Inside the pool? But, you're right. If he was inside the pool, he wouldn't have noticed Rifle. So are you saying Mr. Rimes was underwater the whole time Rifle was eating?Phoenix:No, not underwater. (When I think about what he was trying to do, the answer is clear. Now I'm finally starting to get the whole picture!)Blackquill:Hmph. Just like yesterday... Must you two always be whispering to each other? Why don't you admit that resorting to a penguin will get you nowhere!Phoenix:Phoenix:Oh, I don't know about that. The fact that Mr. Rimes didn't notice Rifle is such a small inconsistency... ...but it's a key point that proves what Mr. Rimes was trying to do.Blackquill:The penguin is a \"key point\"?Phoenix:The show stage pool is very deep. If Rifle came to visit while Mr. Rimes was at the bottom of this pool... ...he would have never noticed Rifle!Rimes:...Arrrrr!Phoenix:Orcas can be out of the water for a short time without sustaining damage. But if they're out of the water for a long time, they weaken and eventually die. In order to kill Orla, Mr. Rimes had to drain the pool. And while the pool was drained of water, Mr. Shipley fell to his death. The show stage pool is about sixty-five feet deep, just like the orca pool. (Changed from [The show stage pool is about 65 feet deep, just like the orca pool.] in the original release) Without water in the pool, a person could be made to fall sixty-five feet. (Changed from [Without water in the pool, a person could be made to fall 65 feet.] in the original release)Blackquill:............!Phoenix:Mr. Rimes probably wondered what to do. If he continued with his plan to kill Orla, how would he dispose of Mr. Shipley's body? So he devised a plan to kill two birds with one stone.Judge:What? How...?Phoenix:Mr. Rimes went down to the bottom of the pool and put the victim's body in the rock. He then had Ms. Buckler move the rock and the body together.Blackquill:Blackquill:And the witness made the defendant do this somehow without arousing her suspicion?!Phoenix:That's right. Mr. Shipley told Ms. Buckler that she couldn't perform in the new show. Ms. Buckler became upset, and wanted to switch back to the old version of the show. So Mr. Rimes conveniently suggested that she take and hide a prop for the new show. Mr. Rimes then manipulated Orla, using her singing and lifesaver tricks. He schemed to have Orla find the body while Ms. DePlume would be standing witness. He saddled Orla with the false charge of murder so that Orla would be put down!Blackquill:WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Rimes:Arrrrr............! Raaaaarrr! GRAAAAAAAAARRR!Judge:So the fact that the witness didn't see the penguin...?Phoenix:...Shows that when Rifle visited the show stage, Rimes was putting the body in the rock. At the bottom of the pool, that is.Judge:Who would have thought the presence of a penguin could prove the witness's actions!Phoenix:(It's working! Just a little further now and Sasha will be proven not guilty!)Blackquill:Blackquill:If you think you've won this battle, you are sorely mistaken. Your theory is based on the notion that the witness could manipulate the orca. Witness, can you control the orca's actions?Rimes:............! Of course not. What kind of bilge be that? I be but a simple animal keeper!Judge:If my memory serves... ...wasn't Ms. Buckler the only one who could issue commands to the orca?Phoenix:............Ugh...Blackquill:Hmph. The judge's blade is sharper than the lawyer's. If you wish to do battle with a witness, you'll need a honed blade. Where is your sword of evidence that Marlon Rimes could manipulate the orca?!Phoenix:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! (Rimes had to have manipulated Orla in order for his plan to work. But how can I prove it?)Judge:Well, it appears this line of reasoning has become unsustainable...Athena:Judge:Well, it appears that I was mistaken...Phoenix:A-Athena?Athena:I've analyzed the hearts of all kinds of people. I have enough experience to see when I look into your heart that you haven't given up. So that objection was my way of speaking up for your heart!Phoenix:............! (She's right. Why would I become a lawyer again, only to give up? I have to keep fighting!) Athena, thank you. With your help, I've remembered the old \"Wright way.\"Athena:The \"Wright way\"...?Phoenix:Your Honor! I'm not finished with presenting my argument!Judge:Hmm. Do you have anything else to ask this witness?Blackquill:You've cross-examined all the witnesses and presented all your evidence!Phoenix:Phoenix:All the witnesses...? Hmm. I don't think so. I haven't cross-examined the most important one, the central figure in both cases.Blackquill:The central figure...?Phoenix:(The one involved in not only the case a year ago, but this current case, too... I've never called her as a witness, but it's time to do so now!)Judge:Wh-Who are you talking about? I demand you tell the court immediately! Who is this \"central figure\" in both cases?Present Ora Shipley profilePhoenix:Leads to:\"The defense calls the central figure in both cases... Orla the orca!\"Present anyone elsePhoenix:Blackquill:If that's your \"central figure,\" the one who holds the key to it all... ...then even Taka here could win a \"guilty\" verdict against you!Phoenix:AAAAAAAAAAAAGH!Judge:I have the final say over the verdict. Just as I have final say over assigning penalties.Phoenix:(Gah...! But there's no way I can give up now! There's one figure at the heart of both the case a year ago and this recent case... Even if this individual can't speak, she can still help me!)Judge:Now, Mr. Wright. Please give us a proper answer this time.Leads back to:\"Who is this \"central figure\" in both cases?\"Phoenix:The defense calls the central figure in both cases... Orla the orca!Judge:Y-You intend to cross-examine an orca?!Rimes:Arr! Cross-examine an orca? Ye must be addled! It be impossible, says I!Blackquill:Blackquill:This absurdity is beyond the pale. How do you expect to question an orca, a creature incapable of speech?!Phoenix:Phoenix:Orla is intricately involved in this case. I have every right to cross-examine her! Besides, even if she can't speak, I think cross-examining her will be invaluable!Blackquill:Very well! Do what you will, then! But if you fail to garner anything from this little exercise with the orca... ...I hope you realize the reward for your efforts will be the defendant's guilty verdict!Phoenix:............I'm ready and confident.Athena:So... Cross-examining Orla, huh? That was a bold move, Boss. Now all we have to do is figure out how Mr. Rimes manipulated Orla!Phoenix:That's right. Now it's Orla's turn to help us save Sasha!Judge:An orca defendant yesterday, an orca witness today! This is truly unprecedented. But even though this is highly unusual, I'm prepared to allow it. Bailiff! Ready the witness telecast! We'll have a ten-minute recess while the telecast is being set up.To be continuedJuly 22, 11:21 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3Athena:Leave it to you to think of something like calling Orla, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:Well, she's the only one who knows all the answers, after all. I just talked to Pearls, and she said Orla seems to be feeling fine. Now we have to try and figure out how Mr. Rimes manipulated Orla.Athena:If we put Mr. Rimes and Orla together, maybe we can get some kind of clue.Phoenix:(And I can't forget about that strange set of prints of Rimes's, either...)Buckler:I r-EEL-y appreciate your trying to save both Orla and me. I had no idea Marlon hated Orla like that... I feel like I've been shocked by a torpedo ray.DePlume:Of course he would hate the killer whale that murdered his girlfriend right in front of him!Athena:Oh! Ms. DePlume! You've been watching the trial?DePlume:Oh, yes! I came to make a declaration of war!Phoenix:A d-declaration of war...?DePlume:No matter what the results of today's trial, I will report the truth in my new book. Even if that truth goes against what I wrote in \"The Killer Killer Whale.\"Crab:I don't know what the truth is... Not even about what happened a year ago...Phoenix:Dr. Crab...Crab:Azura died right in front of my eyes, in the middle of a pirate show... She suddenly fell from the orca's back and began to thrash around in pain. The orca was singing a song, and then started head-butting Azura over and over. Finally, the orca took Azura in her mouth and brought her to the side of the pool. Just before she died, Azura was holding her chest, in obvious pain...Phoenix:(...She was holding her chest...? Wait a minute... Could it be...?) ...I don't think Orla was to blame for the incident a year ago, either.Crab:What?Phoenix:I think the cause of Ms. Summers's death might have been... ...her heart condition.Crab:Heart condition? What heart condition?! I never heard anything about it!Phoenix:Ms. Summers had a prescription with Hickfield Clinic for a heart condition. The orca didn't kill her. I think it's possible her heart condition did!Buckler:What?! Azura had a heart condition, too?! I guess she hid it from everybody, just like I did...Crab:............! So that means... ...the orca was innocent a year ago, too!Phoenix:It's just a theory, but... I think the orca head-butted Azura to check on her... ...and then did the lifesaver trick to rescue her.Crab:............So there was no need to put the orca down after all...?Phoenix:So... you really did intend to put Orla down...?Crab:...No. Jack and I... ...were against such a thing from the start.Athena:B-But you said you were going to \"euthanize the orca\"!Phoenix:(Yeah... I've been wondering about that...) Dr. Crab... About this capsule... It's not a poison, but a sleeping drug, right...?Crab:That's right. Even if Orla attacks someone... ...or even if the Center for Dangerous Animal Control demands she be put down... ...I never had any intention of killing her. I would use sleeping pills to make it look like she was dead, and then set her free. That's why I purchased so many sleeping capsules.Athena:Oh! THAT'S why?DePlume:............! I never considered the possibility that that poor woman's death was illness...Phoenix:(She seems pretty disturbed to be wrong...)DePlume:............I simply want to know the truth. That is why I will tell you who my client is. The day I witnessed the owner's death, I was there at the request of the animal keeper.Phoenix:Marlon Rimes...?DePlume:That is correct. That day, my client called me to ask me to investigate the orca pool.Athena:H-he must have wanted you to witness what Orla was going to do!Phoenix:...Why did you decide to tell us this?DePlume:My desire to protect my client was standing in the way of the truth. I couldn't allow that. I will be watching to see how this all unfolds. Good luck to you, blue and yellow duo.Athena:Well, that was quite a bombshell she just dropped, and so casually, too.Phoenix:(That woman really is a free spirit.)Crab:Do you remember what you said yesterday, Mr. Lawyer? That you'd expose any secret if it would help save Sasha?Phoenix:I remember. It's my duty as a lawyer.Crab:Well, I just wanted you to know that I don't blame you for exposing the aquarium's secret. It may put me in hot water, but if it helps save the orca... Let me clue you in on another secret. Focus on the orca's song.Phoenix:The orca's song, huh...? (What could he be hinting at?)Athena:Oh, Mr. Wright! Looks like it's time!Phoenix:All right. Let's go back in.Athena:You've got it, Boss! We're gonna go in there and save Sasha and Orla -- together!July 22, 11:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4Judge:The court will now reconvene. Is the witness, Ora Shipley, commonly known as \"Orla,\" ready?Blackquill:Well, the orca is present, but I highly doubt she understands what's going on.Orla:Fweet? Fweeeeet!Judge:Ho ho! Just as adorable as yesterday!Phoenix:(...I distinctly remember you being afraid of her on several occasions...)Judge:Now then, Mr. Wright. How do you propose to cross-examine the witness?Phoenix:I intend to have the young lady there with Orla help me.Pearl:Hello, everyone.Judge:That young lady... Didn't I meet her once before, a long time ago?Phoenix:Yes, that's Pearl Fey, my old friend.Judge:Well, well. Didn't she grow up to be a lovely young lady! Aaaaagh!Blackquill:I have no interest in this chit-chat. On with the cross-examination!Judge:M-Mr. Wright! This is all your fault! Why are you dawdling?!Phoenix:(How is this my fault?)Judge:The court will now hear the testimony of Ora Shipley!Witness Testimony-- How Orla was Manipulated --Orla:Fweet... Fwe fweet.

It appears this will be another one of those times.Phoenix:(Yes! He's given me the go-ahead.) I'd now like to put the witness and Mr. Rimes together to see how he manipulated the orca. (Hopefully, Orla will have some kind of reaction...)Rimes:Arr! Fine by me! But naught will happen, I tell ye!Orla:Fweet? Fwe fwe fweeeeet!Athena:............ Mr. Rimes was right. Nothing happened...Phoenix:I guess I shouldn't have expected it to be easy... Hmm. How DID he manipulate her...?Blackquill:Wright-dono, I hope you realize... ...that if you can't prove with this cross-examination how Rimes controlled the orca... (Changed from [...that if you can't prove how Rimes manipulated the orca with this cross-exam...] in the original release) ...your defendant will be declared guilty immediately!Phoenix:............Yes. I realize that. (This is my last chance. I have to figure out how Rimes commanded Orla to do her tricks!)Judge:Please begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- How Orla was Manipulated --Orla: Fweet...

Are you implying he used an app?!Phoenix:Ms. Fey, see if you can issue Orla a command.Pearl:Me? Can I do such a thing?Phoenix:You might be able to, if you play a video with a whistle signal in it.

It sank to the bottom. Now I'll play a video.Orla:Fweet!Pearl:Orla is diving down, heading straight for the dummy!Orla:Fwe fweet!Pearl:Hee hee! What a smart girl you are, Orla!

You actually pulled it off...Judge:That was... the lifesaver trick we saw yesterday! Is Ms. Fey an orca trainer now?!Phoenix:No, Your Honor. I'll explain after we try one more trick. Now let's see if we can command Orla to do the singing trick. ...Ms. Fey. If there's a video of the singing trick, please play that.Pearl:Certainly! ...Let's see. Is it this video?Orla:Fweet!

That was the Swashbuckler Spectacular song!Judge:Ho ho. What a lovely singing voice!Blackquill:Hmph............ It wasn't bad.Judge:By the way, how did Ms. Fey give the orca those commands?Phoenix:Marlon Rimes has something on his phone that his girlfriend, Azura Summers, sent him. They're videos of Ms. Summers issuing commands to Orla with a whistle. If they have Orla listen to the sounds of the signals, anyone at all could command Orla!Judge:Oh, my! Anyone at all?!Phoenix:Yes, I believe so, Your Honor. All they would have to do is play those videos.Judge:Mr. Wright! Please submit those videos as evidence!Phoenix:(I'm getting the sneaking suspicion the judge just wants to try it out for himself...) Ms. Fey, could you send those videos to the TV phone here?Pearl:All right. Certainly!Athena:...Got them! All right, I'll try playing one.Anime cutscenePhoenix:(So this was a training session a year ago, huh? But wait a minute... There's something about that song that bothers me...)TV Phone updated in the Court Record.Judge:If the orca can be commanded using videos on a cell phone... ...then that means that Marlon Rimes could have manipulated the creature!Rimes:Arrrrrrrrrr!Phoenix:Mr. Rimes! You can't talk your way out of it now!Blackquill:Blackquill:Hmph............ I have to commend you. That was very good proof. I concede Marlon Rimes could have manipulated the orca. But isn't it true that the defendant could have done it as well? All she would have to do is use the whistle, the whistle she knows how to use so well. And she wouldn't have had to use those videos... Surely you admit it's a possibility? She could have easily had Norma DePlume witness the singing and the lifesaver trick!Phoenix:(So he's trying to argue it was equally possible for Sasha as it was for Rimes, is he? But is that true? Let me think about that for a minute...)DePlume:That's right! Those weren't just simple cries. It was singing! As I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing! It kept head-butting while it sang the Swashbuckler Spectacular song!Phoenix:(The culprit made sure Ms. DePlume heard the song and saw the lifesaver trick. Could Sasha have shown these two tricks to the witness?)She could havePhoenix:As Prosecutor Blackquill said... Ms. Buckler could have shown these tricks as well.Blackquill:...Just as I claimed! And isn't it much more natural to assume that it was the defendant who did it?!Phoenix:............Huh? Judge:Hmm, yes. It does appear that way to me, too.Phoenix:...W-Wait! Can I take that back?! Please let me have a do-over!Judge:\"Take it back\"?! \"Do-over\"?! Mr. Wright, are you trying to make a mockery of my court? Phoenix:(...But hold on. Could Sasha really have created those exact same conditions?) But, come to think of it, I doubt Ms. Buckler could have produced those exact conditions. Blackquill:And on what basis do you make that claim?! Show your sword if you want to challenge me!Leads to:\"Don't you worry...\"She couldn't havePhoenix:No, I don't think Ms. Buckler could have created the same conditions as the culprit.Blackquill:You challenge me to a battle? I hope your sword is sharpened... Let me see those sword skills of yours!Leads to:\"Don't you worry...\"Phoenix:(Don't you worry... My sword is drawn and ready! My sword is... evidence that the two tricks couldn't have been shown at the same time!)Present WhistlePhoenix:Leads to:\"Ms. DePlume said in her testimony that she witnessed these two tricks at the same time.\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Blackquill:...What, pray tell, is that?Phoenix:(...Maybe if I just don't say anything, it'll all work out somehow...)Judge:Mr. Wright! Are you giving us your best imitation of Prosecutor Blackquill?! Speak up and give the court your answer!Phoenix:............Judge:...I see. Silence, is it? Then I will reward your silence with a penalty. Phoenix:(Well, I guess it didn't \"all work out somehow\"... Ms. DePlume said she saw these two tricks at the same time. But didn't I have a piece of evidence that contradicts that possibility? I think my sword is finally ready now...)Leads back to:\"My sword is... evidence that the two tricks couldn't have been shown at the same time!\"Phoenix:Ms. DePlume said in her testimony that she witnessed these two tricks at the same time. However, that fact is inconsistent with how Orla performs tricks.Blackquill:How Orla performs tricks? What are you talking about?Phoenix:Orla can't perform two tricks at once. She performs only one trick per whistle signal. That's how she's been trained.Judge:Hmm. In other words, it would be just like, with a dog... ...if you tell him to both \"sit\" and \"shake,\" he won't do them at the same time. Am I understanding it correctly?Phoenix:Yes, that's the idea, Your Honor. (I wonder if the judge has a dog?)Blackquill:Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! What a farce! So are you saying that the witness somehow managed to produce an impossible scenario?Rimes:Arr! If the creature's own trainer couldn't do it, how could I?!Phoenix:............ Yes, it's a mystery, isn't it?Athena: B-Boss, you don't have to agree so cheerfully...Blackquill:The defense is claiming that Marlon Rimes manipulated the orca... ...but if you cannot explain fully how this was done, your argument doesn't hold water! If you can't straighten out your own theory, would you like me to straighten you out?!Phoenix:Um... no, thank you!Athena:Hmm. So Orla can't do two tricks at a time, but Ms. DePlume saw her do it... This logical inconsistency means there's a flaw somewhere.Phoenix:Was Ms. DePlume lying...? Or is it not true that Orla can't do two tricks at a time..?Athena:But Ms. DePlume had no reason to lie about such a thing.Phoenix:If it really is impossible for Orla to perform two tricks at once... ...then maybe either the lifesaver trick or the singing trick was... faked?Blackquill:\"Faked\"...?Phoenix:Yes. Maybe Orla only performed one of the tricks... ...but it was made to look like she performed two!Blackquill:Blackquill:\"Maybe\"?! How do you expect to conduct a sword battle with conjecture?!Phoenix:(Sounds like I'd better present some evidence here, and fast.)Judge:Although I am concerned about your profuse sweating, Mr. Wright, allow me to ask you... Which of the two was faked, the lifesaver trick, or the singing trick?The lifesaver trickPhoenix:The lifesaver trick was faked!Blackquill:The security footage plainly shows the orca performing the lifesaver trick. Norma DePlume also stated in her testimony that the orca was singing. There's no indication that either one of these tricks was \"faked\"!Phoenix:............Gah. Judge:The defense appears to be at a loss for words. Phoenix:(But Sasha said that Orla couldn't perform two tricks at once. If the lifesaver trick is clearly shown on the security footage... ...then that means...)Judge:Allow me to ask you one more time.Leads back to:\"Which of the two was faked, the lifesaver trick, or the singing trick?\"The songLeads to:\"The defense wishes to argue that the singing trick was faked.\"They were both fakedPhoenix:Surprisingly enough, they were BOTH faked!Blackquill:If that's true... then what was the orca doing?Phoenix:...What? Oh, um, she was performing some other trick!Blackquill:The singing trick was faked. The lifesaver trick was faked. Are your qualifications as a lawyer also faked?Judge:Yes, I'm beginning to wonder about that point, myself. Phoenix:(Orla was obviously performing some kind of trick. But which of the two was faked, the lifesaver trick, or the singing trick?)Judge:Allow me to ask you one more time.Leads back to:\"Which of the two was faked, the lifesaver trick, or the singing trick?\"Phoenix:The defense wishes to argue that the singing trick was faked.Judge:And on what grounds do you base your assertion that the singing trick was faked?Present Swashbuckler VideoPhoenix:Leads to:\"This is a recording of a recent Swashbuckler Spectacular.\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Judge:That item proves the singing trick was faked?Phoenix:No, Your Honor. This piece of evidence will not prove that. In other words... this piece of evidence is... a fake-out! And if this evidence is a fake-out, then the singing trick was a fake-out as well!Athena:Boss, I don't think that makes any sense...Phoenix:Momentum is key at times like these. Judge:I can hear every word you're saying, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:(I'm still confident it was the singing trick that was faked. Wasn't somebody looking at something and saying the songs were different...?)Judge:I ask you once again, Mr. Wright...Leads back to:\"And on what grounds do you base your assertion that the singing trick was faked?\"Phoenix:This is a recording of a recent Swashbuckler Spectacular. In this recording, Orla sings the same song she sang for Ms. Fey earlier. But Ms. DePlume said this song is different from the one that was sung a year ago.

(Changed from [Fweet! Fweet! Fwe fweet! Fwe fwe fwe fweet!] in the original release)Judge:Hmm, yes. It sounds quite different from the song Orla sang for Ms. Fey earlier.Phoenix:And yet, this is the same video Ms. Fey used to issue the command to Orla to sing. By having Ms. DePlume listen to the song recorded in the cell phone video... ...the true culprit made Ms. DePlume think Orla was singing the song from a year ago! Only Marlon Rimes, the owner of the cell phone videos, could have done this!Blackquill:Blackquill:But Ms. DePlume said she heard the orca singing right in front of her! How do you claim he made her think that? How was the song recording played?!Phoenix:...I intend to explain that, too, of course.Blackquill:What...?!Phoenix:The answer lies somewhere in the orca pool visitor's corridor.

There's only one answer...) Prosecutor Blackquill! This time, I'll explain how the song recording was played properly.Leads back to:\"Marlon Rimes played the song recording by using this!\"Phoenix:Ms. DePlume heard the song while she was in the orca pool visitor's corridor. There's a speaker in that corridor, so that visitors can hear the orca's sounds.Blackquill:And you claim the song was played from that speaker?

And he could get Orla to do a trick by letting her hear Ms. Summers's whistle signal, too. He played the singing through the speaker, and he made Orla do the lifesaver trick.

But, either way, me walkie-talkie was broken, and that be the truth.Press (after pressing third statement)Phoenix:Phoenix:Are you SURE it was your walkie-talkie? You could have stolen a broken walkie-talkie from somebody else. Rimes:Arr! If ye be accusin' me of thievery, let me see yer proof!Phoenix:...All right. This evidence tells who you stole the walkie-talkie from! Present Shipley's DataPhoenix:Leads to:\"According to the defendant's statement...\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Phoenix:This evidence tells the truth about this walkie-talkie! Rimes:Arr... Har har har! *chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp* AHOY! YO! YO! YO HO HOOOOOOO! YO ME BUCKO, YOU BE TRIPPIN'!? AIN'T WORTH GOING ALL IN! Ye say the walkie-talkie be not mine? The \"proof\" ye just presented doesn't prove aught!Phoenix:............I guess you're right. Judge:I agree. That piece of evidence doesn't tell us anything.Phoenix:(Wasn't there somebody involved in the case who lost their walkie-talkie...? I'd better take a look at the evidence again.)Leads back to cross-examinationPresent Shipley's Data (after pressing third statement)Phoenix:Phoenix:The walkie-talkie that the witness brought with him to court today... ...maybe have been stolen from the victim, Mr. Jack Shipley.Rimes:Our aquarium may look like a band of pirates, but thievery...? Arr!Leads to:\"According to the defendant's statement...\"Rimes:BROKE B4 DEPLUME ON DA SCENE! BROKE B4 WRIGHT COULD EVA DREAM!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Do you have some way of proving that statement?Blackquill:Blackquill:The burden of proof is on you! If you can't do that, then we can end this cross-examination right now.Phoenix:Ngh!Rimes:AHOY! YO! YO! YO HO HOOOOO! PROOF THAT IT BROKE? BRO YOU A JOKE! LAG EVEN A SECOND & YOU GON' CHOKE! WRIGHT WANNA PRESS ON EVERY WORD? NOPE! JUDGE GON' JUDGE UNDETERRED! YOU GON' FRONT? THEN BRING THE PAIN! OR STOP AND WALK AWAY IN SHAME!Athena:Ooh, he makes me so mad! We gotta come up with our own freestyle, Boss!Phoenix:...Let's get him back with evidence instead, shall we? No singing.Judge:Witness, please continue your testimony about the walkie-talkie.Rimes:LEGIT GOOFED DURING CLEANING TIME AYE. BUT BILGE-SUCKING LAWYER SPITTIN' LIES!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You made a big blunder? What happened?Rimes:After I helped Sasha with the cleanin', I dropped it by accident and broke it. Ye wish to see it? I still have it with me!Judge:Hmm... It does indeed appear to be broken.Rimes:Heh heh. With me walkie-talkie broken, there be no way I could have done what ye said! I couldn't have given the orca any commands!Athena:Ooh, your walkie-talkie broke! Isn't that just SO convenient?! Mr. Rimes, I think you broke it on purpose!Rimes:Miss Lawyer, none o' yer false accusations, if ye please! I broke it on purpose? Where be yer proof?Athena:Ungh... I-I don't have any proof...Phoenix:(If his walkie-talkie was broken, it throws a monkey wrench into my whole theory. When he let Pearls borrow his cell phone so casually yesterday... ...he must've already been confident I wouldn't be able to prove anything!)Rimes:Har har! Ye'll ne'er get me to agree that that poxed orca be innocent! If somethin' be not done about her, she'll get Sasha one day, too! The orca killed the cap'n! It weren't me!Blackquill:Hmph............ So you intend to continue to claim that the defendant is innocent, do you? But I won't stand for that... Now, then, Wright-dono, what's your next move?!Phoenix:Your Honor, I would like to examine that walkie-talkie, if you don't mind!Judge:Certainly. Here you are.Phoenix:Let's see if there's any way to tell when the walkie-talkie was broken.Athena:If he gave Orla that command, then it couldn't have been broken at the time.Phoenix:I can use [right analog stick / arrow keys] to rotate the evidence. (Changed from [Tap and slide on the bottom screen to rotate the evidence.] in the original 3DS release and [Slide the screen to rotate the evidence.] in the original mobile release) And [A / Space] to examine if I notice anything of interest. (Changed from [Tap again if you notice anything of interest.] in the original release)Athena:You can also zoom in and out with [X / B] and [B / M] to get a better look. (Changed from [You can also zoom in and out to get a better look.] in the original release) Now, let's check every last inch of it for anything \"off\"!Examine front of \"blade\"Phoenix:A walkie-talkie shaped like a sword... Pretty clever. But I don't see anything odd. Athena:Well, a sword walkie-talkie in and of itself is pretty odd, I guess. But let's keep checking it out!Examine handlePhoenix:Darn. It IS broken. It doesn't seem to work... ...Wonder what would happen if I thump it?Athena:H-Hey, it's not an old TV, you know! Please don't break it any further! Let's keep looking!Examine holes on back sideLeads to:\"Huh? Look at these. They look like... tooth marks.\"Athena:Huh? Look at these. They look like... tooth marks.Phoenix:Hey, you're right. A bite this big... I wonder if it was Orla?Phoenix:(Wait... A walkie-talkie... with tooth marks...? Didn't we hear a story like that just yesterday?)Buckler:It was the walkie-talkie Azura used right up until her death. In the middle of the show, the orca brought Azura up to the surface in her mouth. She left tooth marks in Azura's walkie-talkie... The captain said he always kept that walkie-talkie with him so he'd never forget...Phoenix:(Rimes said this walkie talkie was his... but could it be...?)Rimes:Heh heh. Naught odd about it, don't ye agree? Arr! Time to give it up, Mr. Lawyer! Forget the orca! Just save Sasha, says I!Phoenix:...I can't do that. Now that I'm finally a lawyer again... ...how could I hold my head up if I made my client so miserable?Rimes:Arr! A stubborn one, ye be.Press (subsequent times)Phoenix:Phoenix:You made a big blunder? What happened?Rimes:After I helped Sasha with the cleanin', I dropped it by accident and broke it. Heh heh. With me walkie-talkie broken, I couldn't have given the orca any commands! Athena:This walkie-talkie has Orla's tooth marks on it. Does that give us any kind of lead...?Phoenix:I think these tooth marks change the meaning of another piece of evidence... (I won't stop until I find the clue I need to save both Sasha and Orla! I have to uncover the truth about this walkie-talkie!)Rimes:DAT ORCA YO DON'T LISTEN TO ME, 'KAY? KILL THE CAPT? YO YOU SO CRAY-CRAY!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:There could've been some other way besides the walkie-talkie to issue the command!Blackquill:Blackquill:Yes... The orca could have received a signal from the defendant's whistle... Is this the point you're trying to concede?Phoenix:Phoenix:No, that's not what I'm saying! Some other way, besides the whistle...Rimes:ROTTEN LAWYER! BLACK-EYED SAMURAI! TIME FOR A FREESTYLE DRIVE-BY! SASHA IS LEGIT. THAT THE TRUTH. ORCA IS GUILTY. YOU GOTTA ADMIT. I tell ye, it be all the orca's doin'! If ye don't belay all this bilge, I shall dis ye with some rap!Phoenix:(Uh... I believe you've already been doing that...)Before pressing third statementAthena:I'm not even sure where to start with testimony like this... I mean, how can we possibly prove when his walkie-talkie broke?! Phoenix:Yeah, it's all pretty convenient for him, I have to say. All we can do is stay calm and keep pressing him for as much as we can. Maybe we'll find a place we can break through somewhere.After pressing third statementAthena:Hmm, we tried pressing him, but it didn't change anything.Phoenix:Oh, I don't know about that... His statements might not have changed, but the meaning of one of them may have...Athena:Really?! You caught something?!Phoenix:(And that one statement just might be the breakthrough we need!)"

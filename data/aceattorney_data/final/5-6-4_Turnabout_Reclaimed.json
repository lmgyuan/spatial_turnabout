Although, I was doing something else entirely for a while there. As for why I decided to formally get back into lawyering... ...let's just say there's unfinished business to take care of. Anyway, I thought I'd reminisce about my first case back on the job. And what a case it was! It happened only a few months after Athena joined our office...\nSpecial EpisodeTurnabout Reclaimed\nAnime cutscene\nFemale pirate:\nCap'n Orla! Ye made it just in time!\n\u266a Oh, we be pirates, we love to sail the seven seas. \u266a\n\u266a Just a bunch o' scallywags who are as free as free can be. \u266a\n\u266a We swim through storms and waves, all because, you see \u266a\n\u266a Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me! \u266a\nJuly 20, 12:37 PMWright Anything Agency (Changed from [July 20, 12:37 AM [sic] Wright Anything Agency] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Today is my first day back on the job as a lawyer. Putting this attorney's badge on again really makes it hit home. Boy am I pumped! Even Trucy said, \"Looking good, Daddy!\") So Athena, Apollo, what do you think of the ol' attorney's badge?\nAthena:\nWow! This Shipshape Aquarium's show is great! I can't get enough of it!\nPhoenix:\nUm... Athena?\nAthena:\nI still can't believe they showed the Swashbuckler Spectacular on TV! Good thing I recorded this! ...Now, who's ready for another viewing!\nApollo:\nYou've already watched it five times! Let's watch something else now!\nAthena:\nHow can you even suggest such a thing?! This show is therapeutic!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh, boss here, asking you guys a question...)\nApollo:\nWhat's so \"therapeutic\" about watching a killer whale?\nAthena:\nWhat?! Don't you know anything?! Animal-assisted therapy is an established psychiatric treatment!\nApollo:\nYou're kidding. That kind of thing really exists?\nAthena:\nIt's a real thing! I've been to the aquarium myself to try it, and it really helps. I still go to there every now and then to further my psychology studies. The last time I went, I saw a dolphin and an orca swimming around together! It was so--\nPhoenix:\nHey, do you two think you could quit goofing off and do some work for a change?\nApollo:\nWork? But we've already cleaned the toilet... Twice. Each. ...Hey, wait a minute. Is that your badge I see?\nAthena:\nWow! Congrats on getting your attorney's badge back, Boss!\nPhoenix:\nThanks. Starting today, I'm officially a lawyer again! (Sheesh. Took 'em long enough to notice...)\nApollo:\nGee, Mr. Wright... With that badge on, you suddenly look so... capable!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. Um, thanks? (It's not like I was some lazy bum, you know!)\nApollo:\nBut what made you suddenly so fired up to get your badge back, anyway?\nPhoenix:\nAh, well... I made a promise to a certain someone... An important promise.\nApollo:\nWhat could be so important...?\nPhoenix:\nAnyway, we have three lawyers now, so we'd better start taking on lots of work!\nAthena:\nI'm all for that! Let's get this agency hoppin'!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, we have plenty of enthusiasm. All we need now are some clients... It's been eight years since I last wore this badge. I feel like a rookie all over again.)\nTV:\n...And this just in... The owner of Shipshape Aquarium, \"Captain\" Jack Shipley... ...has been murdered. The suspect in the case is reportedly already in custody inside the aquarium.\nApollo:\nIsn't that the aquarium we were just watching, Athena?!\nAthena:\nIt is! ...I can't believe it! A murder at Shipshape Aquarium...?! But I love that place! We need to get to the bottom of this!\n???:\nR-Really? I guess I'm in luck, then! I need Phoenix Wright to save my friend!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-Who in the world is this?!) Um... are you a client...?\nAthena:\nWait... That costume... It looks just like... I've got it! You must work at Shipshape Aquarium!\nBuckler:\nThat's right! You min-now it! I'm Sasha Buckler! I perform like an agile catfish in our pirate show! It'll blowfish your mind!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Minnow\"? \"Blowfish\"? Those puns floundered a bit...)\nAthena:\nHee hee! I figured out the client's identity! Chalk one up for analytical psychology!\nBuckler:\nMy friend is under suspicion of murder, so I really need some help. That's why I've gotta find this \"Phoenix Wright\" guy...\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'm Phoenix Wright... And this is Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes. They're lawyers, too.\nApollo:\nIf there's anything you need, all you have to do is ask!\nAthena:\nThe same goes for me too, Ms. Buckler!\nBuckler:\nHa ha! Just call me \"Sasha.\" And I'll call you all by your first names, too, if that's all right. Phoenix, Apollo, Athena, you have to help me! Please save my friend!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess we'd better start by asking her more about her defense request.)\nTalk\nYour defense request\nPhoenix:\nMs. Buckler-- Sasha, could you tell us more about why you need our help?\nBuckler:\nMy friend is suspected of murdering the captain of Shipshape Aquarium.\nPhoenix:\n\"Captain\"? I thought the victim was the owner of the aquarium?\nBuckler:\nYeah, well, our aquarium has a pirate ship theme. That's why we call the owner our \"captain.\" We call the employees \"crew,\" too.\nPhoenix:\nThat's a pretty unusual aquarium you've got there.\nBuckler:\nAnyway, one of the crew members, my friend, is being suspected of the captain's murder. They've already decided she's guilty. I think they're going to give her the death penalty!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What?! (What happened to \"due process\"!?)\nBuckler:\nBut my friend is as sweet and gentle as a whale shark! She wouldn't hurt a guppy! I know there's no way she murdered anyone, but they won't believe me! But with a name like \"Wright,\" I figured you'd be able to help me set them straight!\nApollo:\nWait a minute... Don't tell me she picked you all because of a bad pun...\nPhoenix:\nOuch. I see my reputation doesn't precede me... (But seriously. My name can't be the real reason she's here...)\nWhy request me? (appears after \"Your defense request\")\nLeads to:\n\"What's the real reason you picked me, Sasha?\"\nPresent\nAnything\nBuckler:\nSorry. Sea creatures are the only things I know anything about...\nPhoenix:\nThat's all right. Don't worry about it. (Gee, I didn't mean to put her in a funk.)\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the real reason you picked me, Sasha?\nBuckler:\n...Well, to be honest, I asked a whole slew of lawyers, but they all refused. They said stuff like, \"There's no merit to taking your case,\" or \"I'm not sure I can help.\" They're all as cruel as sharks, with hearts punier than whitebait!\nAthena:\nOoh! I can really feel Sasha's frustration!\nPhoenix:\n(With nobody on her side, she must feel all alone... But helping people like her is the whole reason I became a lawyer in the first place.)\nBuckler:\nAnd then I heard about a lawyer named \"Phoenix Wright.\" They say he defends clients to the end, no matter how bleak the circumstances.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, guess my reputation DOES precede me. ...Not sure how well-deserved it is, though.\nBuckler:\nI thought to myself, if anybody can save my friend, it's you, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\n(Quite a tall order there for a man who just got his badge back... But I don't want to let Sasha down... or her friend!)\nAthena:\nLet's help her, Mr. Wright! Let's save her friend!\nPhoenix:\nThat's just what I was thinking. Sasha, we'll accept your case.\nBuckler:\nY-You will?! Oh, thank you! You're a lifesaver, literally! Well, no time to stand around and mullet over things! I want you to meet my friend right away! Come to Shipshape Aquarium with me!\nAthena:\nYou got it!\nApollo:\nAnd I'll go, too!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but I need you to stay here and keep an eye on the office until Trucy gets back. You never know when a new client might stop by.\nApollo:\nHow come I'M the one who has to stay behind?!\nPhoenix:\nThanks a million, Apollo. Well, ladies, let's move to the aquarium, shall we?\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSo what do you think about this case, Apollo?\nApollo:\nThe murder of the owner of Shipshape Aquarium? ............Gah. I can't think with you looking at me so expectantly. I don't really have any ideas. Sorry I'm not any help.\nAthena:\nBut you ARE a help! As long as you're the one playing officesitter, you're \"fine\"!\nPhoenix:\nHey, there's Apollo's favorite word! I think I'll say it a few times, too. I'm fine! I'm fine!\nApollo:\nAre you two making fun of me?\nPhoenix:\nWho, us? Of course not. (Just yanking your chain a little.)\nAny ideas?\nPhoenix:\nSo, any ideas for us?\nApollo:\nWell, I think you should give that Swashbuckler video a glance.\nAthena:\nStarting to become a fan, too, huh? I knew you'd like it if you gave it a chance!\nApollo:\nIt's not so much that... I just thought it might give you some leads, seeing as it's the scene of the crime and all.\nPhoenix:\nThat's a good idea. I'll take a look when I get a second.\nApollo:\nI've got nothing better to do, so maybe I'll watch it a few times myself.\nPhoenix:\nApollo... Please try to find something better to do...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nApollo:\nThe return of a legendary lawyer! It's kind of exciting.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Kind of\"?) So how do I look with it?\nApollo:\nWow! You present that thing like a real pro! You must've done it a thousand times.\nPhoenix:\nIt never really seems like enough to just have it pinned to my lapel, for some reason.\nApollo:\nI get wanting to show it off. When I first became a lawyer, I flashed that badge left and right!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh, you still do that, actually.)\nJuly 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel\nAthena:\nWow, this is gorgeous! It's just like being under the sea!\nBuckler:\nYeah, this is the Aqua Tunnel, our pride and joy. I'm r-EEL-y glad you like it! I'm going to go on ahead and fill the detective in on your arrival. Take a look around the tunnel, and then come meet me at the pool up ahead on the right.\nAthena:\nHey, Boss! Look at this cute little fish!\nPhoenix:\nMmm... I bet it would be delicious grilled.\nAthena:\nSeriously? Is that really all you can think of?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I didn't get to eat lunch today-- Ooh! And here comes some grilled chicken!\nAthena:\nThat's not a chicken! It's a penguin! C'mere, little cutie!\n............*kree*\nAthena:\n.........It ignored me...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe it was hungry, too... Oh, look. It dropped something.\nAthena:\nAh! It's an ad for the Swashbuckler Spectacular show!\nPhoenix:\nThat penguin had a whole bunch of these stuffed in its backpack.\nAthena:\nSo it's passing out flyers, huh? How cute!\nPhoenix:\nA carrier penguin that distributes flyers? ...We could use one of those for our office.\nSwashbuckler Flyer added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nWell, can't keep the client waiting! We'd better get going.\nAthena:\nYeah, you're right. Time to roll up our sleeves!\nJuly 20Shipshape Aquarium -\u00a0???\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I don't see Sasha...\n???:\nAh! Are you two the lawyers Ms. Buckler mentioned?\nAthena:\nDetective Fulbright! Are you the lead detective on this case?!\nFulbright:\nThat's right. As long as evil exists in this world, there'll be no rest for me! And who is your sea urchin-like friend there? I don't believe we've met...?\nPhoenix:\n(Is he talking about me?) I'm the defendant's lawyer, Phoenix Wright.\nFulbright:\nWell, I'm Detective Bobby Fulbright! People don't usually get to see this area. It's only open now because of the investigation. You two are pretty lucky to get this peek behind the scenes of an aquarium!\nPhoenix:\nLucky... Right... (This guy is even louder than Apollo...) So, where is the suspect being questioned? And where is Ms. Buckler?\n???:\nHere I be, me buckos!\nAthena:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nPhoenix:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!\nBuckler:\nShiver me timbers! There be one of Dread Pirate Nostache's scurvy swabs!\nFulbright:\nI beg your pardon?! I'm not anyone's \"swab,\" \"scurvy\" or otherwise!\nBuckler:\nMore shameless than a sea lion ye be, tryin' to make off with me best bucko! If ye want to pick a fight with us, ye'd best bring along an army o' great white sharks!\n???:\n*squeek*... Fweeeeeeet!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sasha, what's going on here...?\nBuckler:\nLet me introduce you! This is the friend I was telling you about! Her name is Ora Shipley... ...but she only responds to \"Orla,\" so that's what people call her. I'm her trainer. She's the suspect in the murder, but she'd never hurt anybody.\nOrla:\nFweet!\nPhoenix:\nSHE'S the suspect...?!\nBuckler:\nYeah, and thank goodness you came before they put her down! I'm r-EEL-y grateful to the two of you. I just know you'll save Orla!\nPhoenix:\n...WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nFulbright:\nDon't tell me you didn't even know who your client was?\nAthena:\nA-An orca is the suspect? Our client is an orca?! Is this for real?!\nBuckler:\nOh, did I forget to mention that? Oopsie!\nPhoenix:\n(That's one VERY BIG OOPSIE!) By the way, what was with that mustache earlier...?\nBuckler:\nOh, this be part of me costume for the Swashbuckler Spectacular! When I be wearin' the mustache, I be one of Cap'n Orla's Swashbucklers! A transformation as dramatic as a puffer fish's, wouldn't you say?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think I would ever say that.)\nAthena:\nIt's a pirate-themed aquarium, so that's why Orla is wearing a pirate hat, right?\nBuckler:\nYup! She really loves wearing hats. She puts them on all the time. But her fake mustache keeps falling off, so that's a problem...\nPhoenix:\nI-I see... Well, why don't we start with you telling us a bit more about Orla?\nTalk\nOrla the orca\nPhoenix:\nSo you're really serious about me defending Orla?\nBuckler:\nOf course I am! You're the only one who can do it, Phoenix! I heard you once questioned an animal during a trial, and that got your client off the hook!\nAthena:\nNo way! You did that?!\nPhoenix:\nI, ah... might've tried something like that at one point in my career...\nAthena:\nOoh, you're gonna have to tell me all about this later, or I'll ask Apollo for all the juicy details!\nBuckler:\nWhen I heard you didn't discriminate against animals, I knew you'd hear me out.\nPhoenix:\nI have to warn you, though. I don't know anything about orcas. I mean, they don't... eat people, do they...?\nOrla:\nFweet! FWEEEEEEET!\nPhoenix:\nYIKES! (I think I made her mad!)\nBuckler:\nI won't have you talk that way in front of Orla! Orcas have feelings too, you know!\nAthena:\nYeah, Boss! They have emotions just like we do!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry! (Is anger the only feeling I inspire in women?)\nBuckler:\nDon't worry. She says she forgives you! Besides, orcas are very picky eaters. Orla here only eats fish. The captain went to feed Orla this morning, and then he was found dead in this very room.\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell us more about his death?\nAbout the murder (appears after \"Orla the orca\")\nPhoenix:\nSo the owner of the aquarium, Jack Shipley, was discovered murdered...\nBuckler:\nYeah... It was about 10:10 this morning, just after the aquarium opened. A visitor was viewing the orca pool from the visitor's corridor and screamed.\nPhoenix:\nThe orca pool is this tank here?\nBuckler:\nYeah, that's right. This pool is built so that guests can see into it from the corridor on the first floor. The security guard and I heard the scream and came running into this pool room... ...where we found the captain dead at the side of the pool in his Swashbuckler costume. He was as big and tough as an ol' crocodile, the captain. I still can't believe he's dead...\nAthena:\nMr. Shipley was very important to you, wasn't he?\nBuckler:\nSorry. I didn't mean to get all sad goldfish on you...\nPhoenix:\n(Sad goldfish...?)\nBuckler:\nOkay. Time to snapper out of it! When it's showtime, it's time to smile! That's what the captain always said.\nAthena:\n...By the way, do you know why exactly Orla is being accused of the crime?\nWhy is Orla accused? (appears after \"About the murder\")\nLeads to:\n\"Can you think of any reason why Orla would come under suspicion?\"\nPresent\nSwashbuckler Flyer\nSasha:\nDo you two want to be in the Swashbuckler Spectacular?\nPhoenix:\nYou have regular people participate?\nBuckler:\nOf course! We even have a special tour for people who want to be in it!\nAthena:\nWhat roles would we play if we said yes?\nBuckler:\nLet's see... The roles of a blue seahorse and a yellow sea slug are available!\nPhoenix:\nJudging by the colors, I must be the seahorse.\nAthena:\nA-And I'm the sea slug?! No way! I won't do it!\nBuckler:\nBut sea slugs are all fluttery and beautiful, Athena!\nAthena:\nThey're... beautiful? In that case, I'll do it!\nPhoenix:\n(Her mind is pretty much an open book.)\nBuckler:\nHa ha ha! I hope we can do a show together someday!\nPhoenix:\nCan you think of any reason why Orla would come under suspicion?\nBuckler:\nThe police think Orla went berserk during practice for the Swashbuckler Spectacular. But Orla would never do anything like that! Right, Orla?\nOrla:\nFweeeeeeet! Fwee, fwee!\nAthena:\nAw, just look at that face! Isn't she adorable! The charges just HAVE to be false!\nPhoenix:\nHate to break it to you, but the police don't usually base its decisions on \"cuteness.\"\nFulbright:\nThat's right! We base them on facts! Take a look at this.\nPhoenix:\n(A photo of the victim, huh?) He's got a wound on his head.\nFulbright:\nVery perceptive! The victim and the orca were the only ones here. What's more, we couldn't find a weapon of any kind around.\nPhoto of the Body added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nSo what's the theory on how Orla supposedly killed the victim?\nFulbright:\nThey say orcas sometimes kill their prey by ramming into them underwater. We believe this orca did just that by pulling the victim into this sixty-five-foot pool... (Changed from [We believe this orca did just that by pulling the victim into this 65-foot pool...] in the original release) ...and then ramming into him while they were in the water!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Without any suspects besides Orla, this could be one tough case...)\nOrca Pool Diagram added to the Court Record.\nFulbright:\nNo official autopsy has been ordered, but an orca attack makes sense.\nPhoenix:\nWhy hasn't one been ordered?\nFulbright:\nAccidental death due to a failure to exercise proper oversight over an animal. The medical examiner said it wasn't a homicide, so we don't need an autopsy.\nAthena:\nSo Orla's going to be put down without a proper investigation?! That isn't fair! That's nothing short of police negligence, Detective Fulbright!\nFulbright:\nThe incident wasn't determined a homicide, so there's nothing we can do, Ms. Cykes! Ordinarily, the owner of the aquarium would be held responsible for the oversight failure... ...but the owner is the victim himself, so all we can do is hold the orca responsible.\nBuckler:\nPhoenix! Isn't there anything you can do?! They're going to put Orla down!\nPhoenix:\n(Sasha and Orla are depending on me. I want to do everything I can to help them! But how do I help an orca? Wait... Yes, I can do this!)\nFind the real killer\nPhoenix:\n...I'll find the real killer!\nBuckler:\nOh, thank you, Phoenix! And I'll do everything I can to help you!\nFulbright:\nWait just one moment! You're not a police officer or a prosecutor! You're not even officially the defendant's lawyer! You have no right to investigate!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not officially Orla's lawyer, huh...? In that case, I know exactly what I have to do!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, I can do this!\"\nDefend Orla in court\nLeads to:\n\"I got my badge back now, so I know exactly what I have to do.\"\nSet Orla free\nPhoenix:\n...I'll set Orla free.\nBuckler:\nOkay! I'll go open the water gate!\nFulbright:\nIf you think I'll just let you set the suspect free, you've got another thing coming!\nBuckler:\nPollocks to you, punk!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess until I can actually try to prove Orla's innocence... ...I can't truly set her free... Which means...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, I can do this!\"\nPhoenix:\n(I got my badge back now, so I know exactly what I have to do.) ...I'll defend Orla in court.\nFulbright:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nEven an orca deserves a fair trial. If the one responsible for Orla is dead... then I'll take responsibility for her!\nAthena:\nYou'll what?! I guess doing crazy things just once in your career wasn't enough, huh? But what the heck! I'll take responsibility for her, too!\nFulbright:\nAre you two insane?! This is a case of accidental death caused by an animal! It's not a murder case! With no evidence of foul play, this case will never go to court!\nPhoenix:\nThen let us investigate the crime scene. If we can prove this was a murder, we might be able to take it to trial. And then Orla would certainly need the help of a few good lawyers!\nFulbright:\nHmm... I guess so... But who's ever heard of a trial for a killer whale?!\nAthena:\nJust because it's never been done before doesn't mean we can't do it now!\nFulbright:\nBut... Hmmmmmmmmm...\nAthena:\nPlease, Detective Fulbright! For justice's sake!\nFulbright:\n............ The police have determined that an animal that has harmed a human should be put down. But I don't know for sure whether that was a just decision... If your sense of justice compels you to take on the defense of this animal... ...then my sense of justice tells me to let this case be reexamined for possible merit!\nPhoenix:\nY-You mean it?!\nAthena:\nReally?! That's fantastic! You're not such a bad guy after all, Detective Fulbright!\nFulbright:\nJust remember, this case hasn't been officially recognized as a homicide yet. I'll get in touch with the prosecutor's office, but I'm not making any promises. Anyway, I'd better be off!\nBuckler:\nYou two are our lifeboat! I'll be right here if you need me!\nPhoenix:\nThanks. I've got a feeling we'll really need your help with this investigation.\nAthena:\nWe're still not sure if it'll go to trial, but as Orla's lawyers, we'll do everything we can!\nPhoenix:\nTo get this case into court, we'll need a prosecutor to make an indictment... ...so we have to find enough evidence to prove it's a criminal case.\nAthena:\nThere just has to be something that shows the culprit was somebody other than Orla!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Detective Fulbright said there were no weapons in the area, other than her... ...so we'd better look for something to prove him wrong. I'd better make a note of that so I don't forget.\nAthena:\nYou sure are organized, Boss! Maybe I should get a notebook of my own!\nPhoenix:\nI just like to jot down Notes on the case in the Court Record as I go along. We can use it as a sort of \"To Do\" list.\nAthena:\nGreat idea! I'll add things, too. And whenever we're stuck, we can just refer to the notes!\nPhoenix:\n(To read the Notes, I just open the Court Record ([R / RB / E])... ...and then flip to them with [L / LB / Q] or [R / RB / E]. (Changed from [Then I can switch between the tabs by touching them, or with R and L.] in the original release)) There! Note jotted. Now let's investigate this crime scene.\nAthena:\nThere has to be some evidence here we can use in court! Examining the crime scene from every angle is the key here!\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. If we change our perspective, we might come across new evidence. Let's first see what we can find using [left analog stick / WASD]... (Changed from [To change perspectives, I can touch the arrows on the bottom screen or use [D-Pad].] in the original release) ...and when we're ready, we can use [right analog stick left/right / left/right arrow keys] to change our perspective. (Line newly added in the Trilogy release)\nAthena:\nOr, if there's a particular spot that's got your attention, get right up to it and look away!\nPhoenix:\n(Like that outline of the body in the far right there...?)\nAthena:\nOf course, talking to everybody involved is one of the keys to good investigation.\nPhoenix:\nExactly. And if we \"Present\" items to people, we might learn even more.\nAthena:\nRight! It all boils down to thorough legwork! Well, let's get started!\nExamine\nFront side of Orla\nAthena:\nIs that show makeup above Orla's eye?\nBuckler:\nThat's right. It's a starfish. Kinda makes her look like a punk-rockin' pirate, dont'cha think?\nPhoenix:\n(A punk-rock pirate killer whale...? *groan* It's official -- society's on the road to ruin.)\nAthena:\nWell, I think Orla is one hot rockfish! Speaking of rockin', how do you get Orla to do what you want during the show?\nBuckler:\nI give her signals with this whistle.\nPhoenix:\nOh? But I didn't hear anything just now.\nBuckler:\nThe sound's out of the range of human hearing, just like a dog whistle. Orcas have better hearing than people do. They can even hear the whistle underwater.\nAthena:\nThat's so cool! I wish I could give commands to Orla!\nBuckler:\nAnybody can do that. All they'd have to do is learn the signals. Here, Athena. You can have one of our whistles. Consider it a present!\nWhistle added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nGee, thanks!\nBuckler:\nAs for the actual commands, I'm afraid I can't teach them to you. They're top-secret.\nFront side of Orla (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nIs that show makeup above Orla's eye?\nBuckler:\nThat's right. It's a starfish. Kinda makes her look like a punk-rockin' pirate, dont'cha think?\nPhoenix:\n(A punk-rock pirate killer whale...? *groan* It's official -- society's on the road to ruin.)\nAthena:\nWell, I think Orla is one hot rockfish! Speaking of rockin', how do you get Orla to do what you want during the show?\nBuckler:\nI give her signals with this whistle.\nPhoenix:\nOh? But I didn't hear anything just now.\nBuckler:\nThe sound's out of the range of human hearing, just like a dog whistle. Orcas have better hearing than people do. They can even hear the whistle underwater.\nAthena:\nThat's so cool! I wish I could give commands to Orla!\nBuckler:\nAnybody can do that. All they'd have to do is learn the signals.\nLeft or right side of Orla\nPhoenix:\n(Orla's not going to notice me from here. I'd better move around to the front...)\nLadder\nPhoenix:\nIt doesn't look like the ladder goes all the way down to the bottom of the pool.\nAthena:\nBut there's usually water in the pool, so it doesn't need to. So apparently, the pool spans two whole floors. Ordinarily, visitors only get to see what they can from the first floor... ...but they said on TV that they sometimes give behind-the-scenes tours!\nPhoenix:\nSounds likes that Swashbuckler Spectacular show you recorded is really coming in handy.\nOctopus\nAthena:\nYikes! Look at that huge octopus!\nPhoenix:\nThat must be a show prop, too. One of its legs is missing, though.\nAthena:\nWouldn't it be exciting to take on a huge enemy like that?! I'd like to give it a try, myself -- as a lawyer, that is!\nPhoenix:\n(You know you have an insufficient number of limbs to out-object it, right...?)\nBackdrop\nPhoenix:\nA setting sun... Sunsets always remind me how quickly the day goes by...\nAthena:\nOh, Boss! It's just a painted backdrop, you know!\nPhoenix:\nDown, Athena. Of course I know. I guess they use it for the Swashbuckler Spectacular.\nAthena:\nIt looks handmade. Ooh, I just got an idea! Why don't we make our own \"not guilty\" backdrop?\nPhoenix:\nAnd present it to the judge when things aren't going our way?\nAthena:\nNo, we put psychological pressure on the judge by hanging it behind the defendant!\nPhoenix:\nI... almost want to see how the judge would respond to that...\nHoist\nAthena:\nHey, look! There's an apparatus here to hang from.\nPhoenix:\nI don't think it's for people to hang from. It looks more like a crane to move things with.\nAthena:\nBut Sasha was hanging from it during the Swashbuckler Spectacular. I bet there are all kinds of ways to use it, not just to move things. C'mon, Boss! Try thinking outside the box!\nPhoenix:\n(Is she trying to say I have a narrow-minded view of things?)\nHoop or piece of meat\nPhoenix:\nThere's a piece of meat and a plastic hoop suspended from the ceiling. Talk about a clashy d\u00e9cor.\nAthena:\nI guess Orla really likes meat. Who knew they fed her such huge chunks, though.\nPhoenix:\nUh, all orcas are carnivores. You knew that, right?\nAthena:\nOf course, silly! And I love meat, too! Protein is your body's basic building block, after all!\nPhoenix:\nBut that meat is made out of rubber. I doubt Orla could really eat it, even if she wanted to.\nAthena:\nYou mean to tell me she jumps all the way up there and doesn't get her reward? The poor girl! After all that effort!\nPhoenix:\nI don't think Orla is as dumb as you think she is...\nDoor\nPhoenix:\nThe doors are slightly open, and there are police officers standing guard outside.\nAthena:\nI guess they're watching to make sure we don't try any funny business.\nPhoenix:\nWell, now that you've said it, I suddenly feel the urge to do something.\nAthena:\nHow about if I suddenly break out some squat exercises? That would be pretty funny.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... that might cause a few raised eyebrows in ways you don't want, Athena...\nBall\nPhoenix:\nOh, look. There's a ball in the water. Is that another prop for the show?\nBuckler:\nThat's one of Orla's toys. She plays volleyball with it. It's usually in the bin. Guess I must've forgotten to put it away yesterday.\nAthena:\nWow, I wish I could play volleyball with Orla!\nBuckler:\nYou have as much fight in you as a mean, old lobster! I like it! There aren't many people who wanna be on the receiving end of Orla's fast ball!\nAthena:\nH-Her fast ball?!\nBuckler:\nYeah. She likes to be naughty and slam the ball into things around the pool. You should hear the sound that ball makes when it crashes into stuff!\nAthena:\nU-Uh, well, maybe some other time...!\nPhoenix:\n(She suddenly went from \"fighting lobster\" to \"reluctant hermit crab\"...)\nShark cannon\nAthena:\nHey, there's a cannon in the shape of a shark! I'd love to try firing that thing! Boom!\nPhoenix:\nAre these cannonballs supposed to look like fish eggs or something...?\nAthena:\nHm? But why fish eggs? Why not baby sharks? Think about how crazy it would be to have sharks go flying through the air! Watch the thrilling life-or-death struggle as the little tykes fight to stay alive out of water! I can see it now! The drama! The mayhem! The whirlwind of teeth!\nPhoenix:\n(A tornado of sharks? Not even Hollywood could conjure up something that insane.)\nControl panel\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the control panel for that crane apparatus. There sure are a lot of buttons...\nAthena:\nWhen I see this many buttons, I start to get fidgety.\nPhoenix:\nI know what you mean. You start itching to push them, right?\nAthena:\nNah, I start itching to make a psychological study of people who want to push buttons!\nPhoenix:\n...Need I remind you that I'm your boss, not your guinea pig?\nBoxes and props (from far away)\nPhoenix:\n(It's too far away to get a good look. I'd better get a little closer first.)\nBoxes and props (from close up)\nAthena:\nWhat a mess! Was all this stuff knocked over when the victim struggled with his killer? (Changed from [What a mess! Was all this stuff knocked over when the victim struggle [sic] with his killer?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt's possible, but it would be hard to prove. Let's take a closer look, shall we?\nBoxes\nAthena:\nLook at all this stuff scattered everywhere! I see some swords! I wonder if they have anything to do with the case?!\nPhoenix:\nThey're made of rubber. I doubt they could be used as a weapon.\nAthena:\nBut I still bet if someone got whapped with one, it would sting quite a bit.\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, I guess it would.\nAthena:\nBut I think I could stand the pain.\nPhoenix:\nYeah? Good for you... (Oh, look. There's a blow-up dolphin and an anchor, too.)\nAthena:\nMr. Wright! Are you even listening to me? Stop looking at those toys!\nPhoenix:\n(Yikes! Guess I've been caught red-faced!)\nBody outline\nAthena:\nUgh. So this is where the body was found, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIf they suspect Orla, maybe they found some evidence of an attack on the victim...?\nBuckler:\nOrla didn't attack the captain! She loved him! The captain rescued Orla when she was little, after she got beached on the shore. He tried to release her into the ocean, but she kept coming back. I can tell Orla's sad about losing the captain. She's just not her usual chipper self.\nAthena:\nOrla must really love this aquarium and the captain.\nBuckler:\nShe's the only one around here big and strong enough to play with the big, tough captain. Every day, she made a point of head-butting him and stealing his hat.\nPhoenix:\nYikes! I guess you weren't kidding when you said the captain was a really strong guy.\nTalk\nWhy is Orla accused?\nPhoenix:\nOkay, let's run through why Orla is under suspicion one more time, shall we?\nBuckler:\nThe police think Orla went berserk during practice for the Swashbuckler Spectacular.\nPhoenix:\n(No official autopsy has been ordered but the victim's head injury can be seen in the photo. The victim and Orla were the only ones here, and there was no weapon of any kind.)\nAthena:\nThey think Orla dragged the victim into the pool, which is about sixty-five feet deep... (Changed from [They think Orla dragged the victim into the pool, which is about 65 feet deep...] in the original release) ...and then rammed him in the water.\nBuckler:\nBut Orla would never do anything like that! You two believe me, don't you?!\nPhoenix:\nWe do. We agreed to take on your case, and we'll believe in you to the very end.\nAthena:\nGreat! It's all settled, then. Let's start the investigation!\nAfter examining front side of Orla, octopus, and body outline:\nPhoenix:\nI guess that's about it.\nAthena:\nUnder different circumstances, I would've loved to see the Swashbuckler Spectacular...\nBuckler:\nThe three of us always performed the show together -- me, Orla, and the captain... Today's show has been canceled, but we could put on a little performance for you now! We be Cap'n Orla's Swashbucklers, me buckos! We love to sail the seven seas! We've come to rout that mangy blaggard, Dread Pirate Nostache! Avast! There he be, Nostache himself! Prepare to feed the fish!\nPhoenix:\nUm... am I playing the role of \"Nostache\"?\nAthena:\nWell, Sasha has a \"stache,\" and you don't, so I guess so...\nBuckler:\nHit 'im with yer water cannon, Cap'n, and spare no quarter!\nPhoenix:\nAaaaaaagh!\nOrla:\nFwe fwe fweet. Fwe fwe fwe fweeet! Fwe fwe fwe fweet fwe fwe fweet!\nBuckler:\nWe swim through storms and wave all because you see... Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me!\nAthena:\nWow! That was awesome! Your performance packed quite a wallop!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I, for one, feel like I took quite a beating...\nBuckler:\nSorry 'bout that! Can't have a show without a bad-guy role, right?\nPhoenix:\nBut a singing orca, huh? It must've been tough to train her to do that.\nBuckler:\nThat's Orla's best trick. She can only sing one song, though.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, she's still got one up on a pianist who can't play even one song...) Well, now that we've had a taste of the show, we'd better do some more investigating.\nAthena:\nGood idea. Let's go to the Aqua Tunnel!\nPresent\nWhistle\nBuckler:\nOh, have you been using the whistle I gave you?\nAthena:\nOf course! But I can't get Orla to do any tricks.\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe you can command that huge creature. That's pretty impressive, Sasha.\nBuckler:\nPretty cool, huh? I bet there aren't too many people who can say... ...they literally get to \"whistle while they work.\"\nPhoenix:\n(That must be pretty nice for you.)\nBuckler:\nBut Orla is the one who's impressive, really, not me.\nAthena:\nIt's easy to see how much you care about Orla.\nPhoenix:\nYou two are a good team.\nAthena:\nWhat...?! But you and I are a great team, right? We can top that!\nWright Anything Agency:\nPresent\nWhistle\nApollo:\nWhat's this? Something you wear around your neck?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a whistle they use to make the orca do her tricks.\nAthena:\nIf I blow it at you, will you do a trick?\nApollo:\nWhat am I, some kind of circus animal to you two?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you ARE one of the talents here at our Wright Anything Agency, after all. The least you could do is learn a trick or two.\nApollo:\nNeed I remind I'm a lawyer?! Besides, Athena doesn't know any tricks!\nAthena:\nHee hee! That's what YOU think! I've got a special trick I've been waiting to bust out. I can chug an entire glass of OJ without taking a breath, all while doing squats!\nApollo:\nWell... that's, uh, really something, Athena...\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think I want to see Athena do squats...)\nAnything else\nApollo:\nEvidence...? Does this mean you want me at the defense's bench in court?!\nPhoenix:\nNo. I just wanted to see what you think.\nApollo:\nOh. Darn... In that case, I don't think you want to hear what I think.\nAqua Tunnel (before examining front side of Orla, octopus, and body outline in Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool)\nTalk\nWhat to do\nAthena:\nWe have to find some evidence that shows the culprit wasn't Orla!\nPhoenix:\nYou're really fired up for this, aren't you?\nAthena:\nWell, I'm getting pretty good at investigating, thanks to that last case. So I want to show you how much I've learned! Vamos a hacer esto! Let's check out the scene!\nPhoenix:\nI'm glad to see your enthusiasm, but if you run like that, you're going to fall.\nAthena:\nAaaaaaaaagh!\nPhoenix:\n...Too late.\nAny ideas?\nAthena:\nWell... I have noticed there's an amazing chemistry between Orla and Sasha.\nPhoenix:\nNot those kinds of ideas. I mean, any thoughts on the case?\nAthena:\nMy thoughts are that we don't have enough information yet. That is what my heart is telling me.\nPhoenix:\n(In other words, you don't have any ideas. Got it.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nAthena:\nI'm so glad you got your attorney's badge back, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nMe too. I guess I was always meant to be a lawyer. I'm going to polish it up, shinier than it's ever been!\nAthena:\nI can top that! I'm going to polish mine until the finish comes off!\nPhoenix:\nNever mind. You win.\nSwashbuckler Flyer\nAthena:\nOoh, the Swashbuckler Spectacular is so exciting! I could watch it a hundred times! The fierce fighting, the graceful moves! Oh, Orla and Sasha are so cool!\nPhoenix:\nIf you love the show so much, why don't you try auditioning to be in it?\nAthena:\nHey, I know! The whole office could be in it together! We could be the \"Anything Pirate Band\"! You know, from the name of the agency!\nPhoenix:\nSounds like a pretty pathetic pirate band to me.\nAthena:\nWhat are you talking about?! It sounds cutthroat! It means we'd do \"anything\" to get our hands on treasure! Anything, no matter how brutal!\nPhoenix:\nYikes. We're a brutal pirate band?!\nWhistle\nAthena:\nPhwiiiiip! Phwiiip, phwiiip!\nPhoenix:\nI didn't ask if you could blow it. It's such a weird whistle, anyway. It doesn't even make a proper \"whistle\" sound.\nAthena:\nMost people can't hear it, but I think I can hear it a little bit. It's like a message that only Orla's heart can receive! Aw, that's so sweet!\nPhoenix:\nIt's the same idea as a dog whistle, so I wonder if dogs can hear it, too?\nAthena:\nGrr! Now you ruined it! You don't know anything about girls, do you?\nAnything else\nAthena:\nOh, I get it. Your current state of mind is: \"Gather all the information we can get.\" But let's concentrate on USEFUL information from now on, okay, Boss?\nJuly 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel\nFulbright:\nSo you all done investigating the pool already?\nPhoenix:\nWe had a good look around, but now we're moving on to other areas.\nAthena:\nHow is the police investigation going? Did you -- say, for example -- find any other suspects besides Orla...?\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Wouldn't that be fortunate for you if we did? But no, I'm afraid not. And even more unfortunate for you... ...I'm afraid we found decisive evidence of the orca's guilt.\nPhoenix:\n(What?!) P-Please tell us more, Detective!\nTalk\nProof the orca did it\nAthena:\nSo what's this \"decisive evidence\"?! Don't hold out on us now, Detective Fulbright!\nFulbright:\nI'm very sorry, but I can't share classified information with the defense. Especially not security footage that shows the moment the orca attacked the victim! Yup, I'm to personally see to it that this baby stays safe! It will never leave my side!\nPoliceman:\n'Scuse me, but there's a call for you, Detective.\nFulbright:\nI'll be right there! Sorry guys, you know how it is!\nAthena:\nWell, he never said that HE wouldn't leave ITS side, I guess... Now, let's sneak a peek! Wh-What the--?!\nPhoenix:\nIs this supposed to be the moment Orla attacked the victim...?\nSecurity Footage added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nThis little bit of footage doesn't prove anything!\nPhoenix:\nI agree. I believe in Orla and Sasha. Let's just continue with our investigation.\nAthena:\nGood idea! ...Huh? There's a sticker on this camera that says, \"Return to the Pub O' Danger.\"\nPhoenix:\nGuess somebody there manages the cameras? Let's check it out later.\nFulbright:\nSorry about that. Prosecutor Blackquill called to remind me to go feed Taka. So where were we...? Oh, that's right! You two got any more questions for me?\nPhoenix:\nNo, we're good. Thank you. (For leaking all your info!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nFulbright:\nSo that's your symbol of justice, is it? Well, this is MINE!\nPhoenix:\n(...Wow. He can whip that badge out pretty fast...)\nAthena:\nWe can top that! Take THIS! Twin attorney's badges!\nFulbright:\nAaagh! No fair! Two against one!\nAthena:\nNo fair! Your police badge is bigger and flashier!\nFulbright:\nWhat?! You dare to call me... \"unfair\"?! Me, the very model of justice itself?!\nAthena:\nBoss! I'd say we won this round!\nPhoenix:\nAthena, in this battle there are no winners...\nPhoto of the Body\nFulbright:\nThe poor victim... It's heart-wrenching! Crime cannot go unpunished!\nPhoenix:\nWe don't want crime to go unpunished, either.\nAthena:\nBut we'll do our utmost to defend our client.\nFulbright:\nHmm. Your form of justice or mine... Which is true justice? I guess we'll see how it plays out.\nAthena:\nIn other words, he doesn't have enough information right now to make up his mind.\nPhoenix:\nThank you for the translation, Athena.\nAnything else\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! I have NOTHING to say about that! If you're lawyers of any mettle, you'll find the answers for yourselves!\nAfter clearing \"Proof the orca did it\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel:\nJuly 20Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger\nAthena:\nThis looks like one of those hands-on exhibits. It has a real air of danger, don't you think?!\nPhoenix:\nWell, the banner does say it's the \"PUB O' DANGER\"...\nAthena:\nLet's see. According to the description, this room is... ...\"A pub where pirates gather. Explore and interact with sea creatures! Actually feel the electricity of electric eels and feed real piranhas! Experience the terror of the seas with these dangerous experiments!\"\nPhoenix:\nAll of those sounds less like \"terror\" and more like \"torture\" to me!\n???:\nAhem! I'd thank you to keep it down there, blue boy. I'm conducting an experiment! Do not disturb me, unless you wish to be zapped with an electric eel!\nPhoenix:\nM-My apologies, ma'am. (Wow. She seems intense...)\nAthena:\nExcuse me, but who are you?\n???:\nBefore you ask others, shouldn't you give YOUR name first? Basic manners, young lady.\nAthena:\nO-Oh, yes! Of course! My name is--\n???:\nNever mind. I will simply call you \"yellow girl.\" It's easier that way.\nDePlume:\nI am Norma DePlume. I am very interested in Shipshape Aquarium, and am a frequent visitor here.\nAthena:\nB-But... I don't want to be \"yellow girl\"!\nPhoenix:\nYou think I want to be called \"blue boy\"? ...*sigh* Let's just see what she has to say.\nTalk\nNorma DePlume\nAthena:\nYou say you're interested in the aquarium, but you don't look like a staff member. Hmm... Let's see... I got it! You're someone completely unrelated to this aquarium!\nPhoenix:\n(That's some deductive reasoning there, champ.)\nDePlume:\nI am a visitor, a patron, a customer, a guest... And what might you be?\nAthena:\nI'm not a \"what\"! I'm a lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, that's what I was going to say!) A-And I run a law office!\nDePlume:\nWell, whatever you are, I don't have the slightest interest.\nAthena:\nGrr! Just who does she think she is, Boss?!\nPhoenix:\n\"A visitor, a patron, a customer, a guest,\" remember?\nWhy you're here (appears after \"Norma DePlume\")\nAthena:\nI thought they closed the aquarium and weren't letting members of the public in?\nDePlume:\nOh ho ho! But I have special permission, you see.\nPhoenix:\nAnd why exactly is that, if I may ask?\nDePlume:\nWell, because of the incide-- Heavens! I've said too much.\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nI-I remember this...! Psyche-Locks!\nAthena:\nHuh? Psychedelic rock? Cyborg clocks? What?!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no. \"Psyche-Locks.\" It's the power of this magatama. It gives me the ability to see the secrets locked away in somebody's heart. If I can remove the locks, I can uncover their secrets.\nAthena:\nI didn't know you had a magical item like that!\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like this lady knows something about what happened. I'll just use my magatama and undo her Psyche-Locks. (Huh? I can't see the locks anymore!)\nAthena:\nHuh? The color of that stone looks different from before.\nPhoenix:\nThat's funny. Maybe it's just out of juice...?\nAthena:\nI-It can do that?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. A certain girl I know poured her spiritual power into it for me. Without that power, I can't undo the Psyche-Locks.\nAthena:\nNo way!\nDePlume:\nHmph! Why do I have to keep quiet about it, anyway?! I've never been any good at keeping secrets. But I did promise after all, so I guess I had better keep my mouth shut...\nPhoenix:\nWho did you promise what to?\nDePlume:\nNo comment. Now, go away!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* Just when I thought we could find out more about the case...\nAthena:\nLet's go try to find some other way! I'm sure we'll find something!\nWhy you're here (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nI thought they closed the aquarium and weren't letting members of the public in?\nDePlume:\nOh ho ho! But I have special permission, you see.\nPhoenix:\nAnd why exactly is that, if I may ask?\nDePlume:\nWell, because of the incide-- Heavens! I've said too much.\nPhoenix:\n(Without some spiritual power, the Magatama can't help me unlock Ms. DePlume's secret. I guess we'll just have to think of some other way.)\nPresent\nSwashbuckler Flyer\nDePlume:\nA Swashbuckler flyer? I have more than enough of those already. Do you have any idea how many times I've visited this aquarium?!\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, what are you yelling at me for?) Don't you ever get tired of coming here?\nDePlume:\nHmph! You obviously don't know anything about Shipshape Aquarium. They feature different marine creatures each month, so visitors never get bored.\nAthena:\nSo you're a fan of Shipshape Aquarium, like me?\nDePlume:\nOh, please! I'm here to gather information-- the fundamental work of a great writer. But I don't suppose that's something you common folk would understand...\nAthena:\nGrr! That woman makes me so mad!\nPhoenix:\nNow, now. Why don't we \"common folk\" just get back to our investigation?\nSecurity Footage\nDePlume:\nDon't thrust that under my nose! I won't watch it!\nPhoenix:\nAre you usually pretty photogenic, Ms. DePlume?\nDePlume:\nOf course I am! I've been compared to a movie star! It's little wonder, with my perfect makeup and stylish figure. Wouldn't you agree?\nPhoenix:\n(She wants me to agree?!) Let's get a woman's opinion on this one.\nAthena:\nWhat? You're asking me?! Well, uh, let's see. I DO think you're very pretty, Ms. DePlume.\nDePlume:\nHmm? I get the distinct impression your words are full of hidden meaning...\nAthena:\nWell... I wouldn't say \"full\" so much as \"full-figured\"...\nPhoenix:\nA-Athena! I'd stop right there if I were you.\nAnything else\nDePlume:\nI have no interest in looking at meaningless trifles. As a matter of fact, I have no interest in looking at you, blue boy.\nPhoenix:\n(What, so now I'm a \"meaningless trifle,\" too?)\nAfter clearing \"Why you're here\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger:\nJuly 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel\nAthena:\nHey, Detective Fulbright's gone. It looks like the police investigation is over, too.\nPhoenix:\nThat's too bad. I was hoping to get a little more out of him.\n???:\nYo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Cleaner? Nuh uh. Feeder? That's right! Yo girl why you hidin' from me? I'm searching all 'round like this be a bad dream.\nPhoenix:\n(Is that somebody... rapping?)\n???:\nRifle yo sometimes you make me so mad. But now that you're gone I'm just so sad. Yo Rifle just come back to me. We can be together and sing kree kree kree!\nPhoenix:\nWhat's with this guy, rapping and making strange bird sounds...?\n???:\nYikes! W-Who's there?! ...You didn't hear me rappin', did ya?!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well... Maybe...\n???:\nArrrrrrr! Look, just do me a favor and pretend ya didn't hear nothin'!\nPhoenix:\nFine by us. And who might you be?\nRimes:\nI'm Marlon Rimes. I'm an animal keeper here. But the aquarium is already closed today. Um, at least, I'm pretty sure it is...\nAthena:\nPretty sure? You don't sound too certain... Oh! Are you new here or something?\nRimes:\nWow! Yeah, that's right! Pretty good guess! So who are you guys?\nPhoenix:\nI'm Phoenix Wright.\nAthena:\nAnd I'm Athena Cykes. We're lawyers, and we're going to represent Orla... ...by taking her case to court and proving she's innocent!\nRimes:\nA-Are ya serious?! You wanna defend an orca in COURT?! ...Oh! But if you're here for Orla, that must make ya friends of Sasha's... Sorry if I came across rude.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like he's friends with Sasha.)\nRimes:\nSometimes when I'm by myself, I like to rap to pass the time. Especially when I'm around the animals I love.\nAthena:\nOoh, I love animals, too! Especially marine creatures, like dolphins!\nPhoenix:\nI like marine creatures, too. (But just the ones you can eat.)\nRimes:\nYeah? Well, people who like animals are good people. That's what I always say! If there's anything I can do for you two, just say the word! I just started workin' here, though, so I dunno how much help I can be.\nAthena:\nMr. Rimes seems pretty friendly.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, friendly and agreeable.\nTalk\nMarlon Rimes\nAthena:\nSo, what exactly do you do here as an animal keeper?\nRimes:\nMainly, I clean the place and feed the animals. Wiping all this glass takes forever!\nPhoenix:\n(I can imagine... This tunnel alone must take most of the day.)\nRimes:\nI also prep the food the animals eat. That's the hardest part of all.\nAthena:\nYou mean, it's really difficult to get the hang of?\nRimes:\nNah, I mean, I'm a vegetarian, so cuttin' fish and meat and stuff up creeps me out.\nPhoenix:\nNow there's something I never expected to hear from a pirate.\nAbout the murder\nPhoenix:\nDo you know anything about the incident that took place this morning?\nRimes:\nYeah. One of our guests saw what happened and started screamin'. I came runnin', but by the time I got there, I couldn't see the orca or the captain.\nAthena:\nSpeaking of the captain... what was he like?\nRimes:\nLike a strong captain who can turn a wild bunch of ruffians into some great pirates... He always treated us fairly and equally, human and fishes alike. The real deal, man. ...Hey! Wh-what are YOU cryin' for?!\nAthena:\nI-I'm not crying! It's just, I can feel your heart crying, that's all.\nRimes:\nG-Girl, whatchu talkin' about?! I'm not cryin', either!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I won't mention that his eyes are puffier than a pair of pufferfish...)\nRimes:\nI bet Sasha and our vet Dr. Crab are even more upset by his death.\nPhoenix:\nVet? This aquarium has a resident vet?\nRimes:\nYeah... Yo, hold up! I haven't seen Dr. Crab this morning. Staff are supposed to stay put. The night shift has been on duty since last night, but they won't let us go home. Sasha even had to get special permission to go out looking for a lawyer this morning.\nAthena:\nHmm... We haven't seen anybody who looks like a vet.\nRifle\nAthena:\nWere you rapping something about looking for a weapon earlier? A rifle or something...?\nRimes:\nHa ha ha! No, not a weapon! \"Rifle\" is the name of one of our penguins.\nAthena:\nA penguin? Why would you name a penguin something like that?\nRimes:\nAhoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Prep for the battle, prep for the war! Little lady Rifle gon' even da score! Y'all think you can escape with your pride? Nuh uh, you just gon' be straight up denied! (Changed from [Ya'll [sic] think you can escape with your pride? Nuh uh, you just gon' be straight up denied!] in the original release) Yo! Yo! Yo ho ho! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Anyway, that's what she's like, so we named her \" Rifle.\"\nPhoenix:\n...Okay, but did you have to rap it?\nRimes:\nThat's just how I roll.\nAthena:\nDoes Rifle wear a backpack, by any chance?\nRimes:\nYeah, that's the one! So you've seen her, huh? She's always runnin' away! She's such a good runner, we decided to put her to work deliverin' flyers.\nPhoenix:\nDo you really want a dangerous penguin like that running loose?!\nRimes:\nAw, Rifle's not dangerous. She only attacks people she doesn't like.\nAthena:\nWhen we ran into her earlier, she didn't attack us. She straight up ignored us, actually.\nRimes:\nHey, I have an idea! If you run into Rifle again, would ya mind feedin' her for me? She didn't come back to the pool at feedin' time like usual, so I've been lookin' for her. She loves the smell of fish, so she might come over to you if you have some.\nAthena:\nOoh, I would LOVE to feed a penguin! That'd be okay, right, Boss?\nPhoenix:\nI don't mind, as long as YOU carry the fish.\nFish handed over to Athena.\nAthena:\nP-U! It smells so... fishy!\nPhoenix:\n(Really? What a shocker...)\nRifle (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nWere you rapping something about looking for a weapon earlier? A rifle or something...?\nRimes:\nHa ha ha! No, not a weapon! \"Rifle\" is the name of one of our penguins.\nAthena:\nA penguin? Why would you name a penguin something like that?\nRimes:\nAhoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo!

What a shocker...)\nPresent\nSwashbuckler Flyer\nRimes:\nWith this flyer, you can get a penguin sleep mask the next time you come in.\nPhoenix:\nOh, yeah? That would be nice, especially if it's free.\nAthena:\nThat'd be perfect for taking a nap at the office after going for a run or something!\nPhoenix:\nI prefer you DIDN'T take naps at the office, actually.\nRimes:\nYeah, I feel ya! Sometimes I fall asleep when I'm feedin' the animals.\nAthena:\nI guess only a newbie can truly understand the feelings of another newbie!\nRimes:\nHeh heh. We're kindred spirits, my sister. Kindred spirits.\nAthena:\nTwo peas in a pod! Birds of a feather!\nPhoenix:\nI suddenly feel so alone.\nFish\nPhoenix:\nMr. Rimes, about this fish...\nRimes:\nI'm the master keeper! No way you can beat me! You're a pro lawyer, but an amateur feeder! Ya'll [sic] ready for a feeding throw-down? Rifle c'mon! Time to defend da crown!\nPhoenix:\n............ Uh, it doesn't look like Rifle's coming...\nRimes:\n............I guess not, huh? Sorry about all that \"throw-down\" stuff, then... I just wanted to show ya the inner secrets of animal feedin'.\nPhoenix:\nThere are \"inner secrets\"?\nRimes:\nYou know, stuff like how to debone a fish. Great care goes into each animal's food. Then of course there's the way of tossin' the food to 'em. It's different for each one.\nPhoenix:\n...I see. Sorry to have bothered you with mundane questions from the uninitiated.\nAnything else\nRimes:\nI'm new here, so I dunno.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't really think being \"new here\" has anything to do with it in this instance...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nRimes:\nOh, yeah. Besides Rifle, I've been lookin' for Small Fry, too.\nPhoenix:\n\"Small Fry\"? Is that another penguin?\nRimes:\nNah, she's a friend I made, a high-school girl. She went off lookin' for Rifle somewhere and hasn't been back.\nAthena:\nIs she... your girlfriend?\nRimes:\nWhat?! Nah, no way! Sasha is the one I--\nAthena:\nSo you like Ms. Buckler, do you!\nRimes:\nWell, I-I really respect her, ya know? We have different tastes in music, but I admire the way she lives her life! It's not like I \"like\" her. It's more complicated than that...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm pretty sure that all adds up to \"like\"...)\nRimes:\nShe tries to put on a brave face... ...but I think the captain's death is hittin' her hardest of all. After all, it was her human show partner that got killed by that orca.\nAthena:\nSo you think Orla really did it?\nRimes:\nWell, I can understand how Sasha feels... ...but she's the only one of us who doesn't think the orca did it.\nAthena:\nOh, I see...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it isn't easy to believe in somebody who can't even speak up for herself...)\nRimes:\nAnyway, let me know if you see Rifle or Small Fry, okay? Small Fry said she was gonna go check the orca pool.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe we'll head back there, then.\nOrca Pool (before clearing all Talk options with Marlon Rimes in Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel)\nPresent\nFish\nBuckler:\nYou be givin' me a fish?! So you be challengin' me to a fight, eh?! Arr!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! No! What kind of rule is that?!\nAthena:\nThat's how it goes in the Swashbuckler Spectacular! Present a fish. Start fighting. The gauntlet--I mean, the fish--is thrown down, and the glorious battle begins! Ooh, you're so cool when you're up there jumping and slashing!\nBuckler:\nArr! Belay that talk, li'l lassie! Compliments will get ye naught!\nAthena:\nOoh! You sound just exactly like a real pirate! Hee hee!\nPhoenix:\n(Athena just eats this stuff up.)\nJuly 20Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? There's something on the left side of the pool that wasn't here before...) It looks like an electronic sword...?\nBuckler:\nHey, you're back!\nPhoenix:\nHi, Sasha. What's with this strange sword here?\nBuckler:\nOh, that's a walkie-talkie. It's probably Rifle's.\nAthena:\nR-Rifle can use a walkie-talkie?!\nBuckler:\nShe's always running away, so we attached a walkie-talkie to her. If we can hear the sounds around her, we can usually guess where she is.\nPhoenix:\n(But not if she drops the walkie-talkie on the floor.)\nBuckler:\nEvery member of the crew has one, too, so we can communicate back and forth. We can even use them to broadcast to specific parts of the aquarium. Cool, huh?\nWalkie-Talkie added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nWell, if Rifle's walkie-talkie is here, then Rifle might still be here, too! Rifle! Come out, come out, wherever you are!\n*SPLASH!*\nAthena:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nOrla:\nFweet?\nBuckler:\nAre you okay? You have to be careful around pools, or you might slip right in!\nAthena:\nI'm more afraid of my heart jumping right out!\nPhoenix:\nHey, who's that riding on Orla? Isn't that Rifle?\nAthena:\nHey, you're right! C'mere, Rifle!\nRifle:\n............ *kree*\nAthena:\nArgh! She ignored mem again! Why doesn't that penguin like me?! Graaaaagh!\nPhoenix:\nNow you've scared Rifle away with all that yelling...\nAthena:\nWell, I'm not giving up! I'll MAKE that penguin like me if it's the last thing I do!\nAnime cutscene\nAthena:\nHey! Get back here, you little pipsqueak!\nRifle:\n*kree!*\nPearl:\nOh! Sorry, Rifle. But at least you seem alright.\nPhoenix:\n(Hey... It's... It's...) Pearls?!\nPearl:\nOh! Mr. Nick! I haven't seen you in ages!\nPhoenix:\n(Could Pearls be the \"Small Fry\" Mr. Rimes was talking about?)\nPearl:\nCongratulations on your return to lawyering! I've been thinking about stopping by your office for a visit to congratulate you.\nPhoenix:\n(This is Pearl Fey. I call her \"Pearls.\" She may dress a little funny... ...but that's because she's a spirit medium -- a real prodigy with great power, at that. I've known her since she was little, and she sometimes comes to the office to visit. She's just a little older than Trucy, so she's been like a big sister to her.)\nPearl:\nI guess everyone here knows Mr. Nick, then? He's such a nice guy, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n(...Is she trying to be MY big sister too, now?!)\nTalk\nPearl Fey\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you doing here, Pearls?\nPearl:\nMy summer camp is here on a field trip. I've never been to such a big aquarium before, so I was really looking forward to it! But then that incident happened... and the police just finished questioning me.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see.\nPearl:\nUm...Mr. Nick...? Who is that lady next to you...?\nAthena:\nI'm Athena Cykes! I'm a new lawyer at the Wright Anything Agency!\nPearl:\nOh, how do you do! My name is Pearl Fey. My cousin and my friends call me \"Pearly.\"\nAthena:\n\"Pearly\" it is, then! Nice to meet you!\nPearl:\nSo... how did the two of you meet...?\nPhoenix:\nWell, you know how I used to travel to Europe to study their legal systems, Pearls? I met Athena on one of those trips.\nMeeting Athena (appears after \"Pearl Fey\")\nPearl:\nSo, tell me more about how the two of you met in Europe.\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, I thought I was supposed to be asking the questions here!)\nAthena:\nA long time ago, Mr. Wright helped me out of a difficult jam. That's when I started thinking about becoming a lawyer like him.\nPearl:\nSo you're like her mentor, huh, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, something like that, I guess.\nAthena:\nMr. Wright is the whole reason I am who I am today! He was the one who told me my knowledge of psychology could help people in court!\nPearl:\nGee, Mr. Nick, it looks like you've become a real adult since the last time I saw you!\nPhoenix:\n(I've always been an adult the entire time I've known you, Pearls!)\nRifle:\n*kreeeee*\nAthena:\nWell, would you look at that! Rifle loves you!\nPhoenix:\nShe sure does seem to be attracted to Pearls...\nPearl:\nHee hee! I'm so glad she likes me! Penguins are so adorable, aren't they! I even bought myself a little penguin calendar here at the aquarium gift shop. I have it hanging from my bag already!\nAthena:\nOh, how cute! A calendar in the shape of a penguin!\nBuckler:\nThat calendar is a real hit with all our female visitors. I even have one myself! But the rest of the staff thinks it's... too cutesy.\nPhoenix:\nI guess it doesn't really fit the whole \"rough-and-tumble pirate\" image very well... But, hmm... why does this calendar smell kind of like fish...?\nPearl:\nWh-What do you mean, Mr. Nick?! Please don't be rude!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh. I got Pearls mad...)\nCalendar added to the Court Record.\nMeeting Athena (subsequent times)\nPearl:\nSo, tell me more about how the two of you met in Europe.\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, I thought I was supposed to be asking the questions here!)\nAthena:\nA long time ago, Mr. Wright helped me out of a difficult jam. That's when I started thinking about becoming a lawyer like him.\nPearl:\nSo you're like her mentor, huh, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, something like that, I guess.\nAthena:\nMr. Wright is the whole reason I am who I am today! He was the one who told me my knowledge of psychology could help people in court!\nPearl:\nGee, Mr. Nick, it looks like you've become a real adult since the last time I saw you!\nPhoenix:\n(I've always been an adult the entire time I've known you, Pearls!)\nRifle (appears after \"Meeting Athena\")\nPhoenix:\nSo you were looking for Rifle, too?\nPearl:\nThat's right. I was trying to help Mr. Marlon, the animal keeper.\nAthena:\nC'mere, Rifle! C'mon!\nRifle:\n*kree!*\nPhoenix:\nShe went towards Orla instead.\nAthena:\nGrrrrr! Why can't I get Rifle to like me?!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you should quit chasing after her with that scowl of yours...\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! How could you speak to a lady so rudely?!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh. I got Pearls mad... again.) Why don't you try to get Rifle to take some food from you?\nAthena:\nOh, great idea! And I have just the thing to present her, too! (Changed from [Oh, great idea! And I have just the thing to offer her, too!] in the original release)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nOh, I'm so happy you get to be a lawyer again, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha. Thanks. I let our friends know I was back, too.\nPearl:\nI wish we could all get together. It's been quite a while! Maybe we should throw you a surprise party to celebrate your comeback.\nPhoenix:\nThat would be really nice. But if you tell me about it, it won't be a surprise, you know.\nPearl:\nOh! B-But we could spring it on you after you had forgotten, and still surprise you!\nSwashbuckler Flyer\nPearl:\nI was really looking forward to seeing the Swashbuckler Spectacular... It's such a shame.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I bet you would've really enjoyed it.\nPearl:\nBut I was really happy to see such a large marine animal! It was quite an experience! ...I still have yet to see a blue whale, though, the largest marine animal of them all!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, uh... I doubt there are any blue whales at the aquarium.\nFish\nPearl:\nOh my! Did you go fishing, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNo, this is for Rifle. We were asked to feed her.\nPearl:\nOoh, that sounds like fun! Do you think she would take food from me?\nPhoenix:\nOh, I'm sure she would--from you.\nAthena:\n...So what you're really trying to say is that Rifle wouldn't take food from ME, right?!\nPhoenix:\nNo, that's not what I meant. (That IS what I meant, though.)\nAthena:\nGrr! I won't be bested! Pearly, it's ON!\nPearl:\nWh-What? What's \"on\"?\nPhoenix:\nNow, now, Athena. Let's be adults about this. You've got poor Pearls here all confused.\nFish (after clearing \"Rifle\" Talk option)\nLeads to:\n\"Rifle! I have a present for you! It's chock-filled with love! Here you go!\"\nCalendar\nPearl:\nIsn't it cute? I really love this calendar.\nPhoenix:\nIt's shaped like a penguin. It is pretty cute, isn't it? Maybe I should buy a calendar for the office before I leave. I always run out of room to write appointments in my planner.\nAthena:\nWhy don't you just put your appointments on your phone?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not very good at using electronic devices...\nPearl:\nOh, neither am I. Hee hee! We have something in common!\nAthena:\nAw, now I feel left out.\nAnything else\nPearl:\nYou know I'd do anything I could to help you! ...But I'm afraid I don't really know anything about that...\nPhoenix:\nThat's all right, Pearls. No worries.\nAthena:\nRifle! I have a present for you! It's chock-filled with love! Here you go!\nOrla:\nFwee, fweet!\nAthena:\nHey! Orla ate my love-filled fish! At least it looks like she enjoyed it, though.\nOrla:\nFwee, fweet!\nAthena:\nI think Orla and I just had a bonding moment!\nPearl:\nFriendship blossoming with the exchange of some food! Oh, isn't it moving, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think \"moving\" might be going a bit far... Anyway, how did you get Rifle to come to you so easily, Pearls? I heard Rifle was attracted to the smell of fish...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick! Are you saying I smell like fish?!\nPhoenix:\nUh, maybe just a little, yes...\nPearl:\nHmm... I guess I need to change my clothes...\nPhoenix:\n(That's odd... I wonder why Pearls smells like she's holding a bucket of fish...?)\nBuckler:\nHmm... Orla doesn't usually want to eat at this time of day... And we've even been giving her more food than normal at her regular meal times lately...\nTalk\nOrla's feeding habits (Changed from [Orla's eating] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIs there something wrong with Orla's feeding habits lately?\nBuckler:\nYeah, something's weird. The new guy, Marlon, feeds all the other animals besides Orla. But the captain and I, her trainer, are responsible for feeding Orla. It was the captain's turn to feed Orla this morning.\nAthena:\nBut Orla keeps coming to me and signaling she's still hungry. She wants my fish, chock-filled with love!\nPhoenix:\nHow long are you going to keep saying that? (She sure is excited to make a new friend.)\nBuckler:\nBut I don't think the captain would've forgotten to feed Orla...\nOrla and Rifle\nPearl:\nRifle and that big creature there certainly seem to love each other!\nBuckler:\nThis is Orla the orca. Rifle and Orla are best friends! They belong together like a clownfish and a sea anemone!\nPhoenix:\n(Care to phrase that in a way us non-biology majors can understand...?)\nPearl:\nOh! So this orca is the suspect. I-I read in a book once that orcas eat penguins...!\nBuckler:\nDon't you worry about that. Orla here's really gentle, and she never eats anything but fish.\nRifle:\n*kree!* *kreeeee!*\nOrla:\nFwee... Fwee, fwee...\nBuckler:\nShe's an ol' sweetheart. As a matter of fact, she even tolerates Rifle picking on her!\nPhoenix:\nIt's true, she does seem very gentle. She hardly seems like a \"killer\" whale...\nAthena:\nAs lawyers, we have to do everything we can to save this beautiful, gentle creature!\nPearl:\nWow, you're going to defend her in court? She's... quite the defendant, isn't she...?\nPhoenix:\nShe's the biggest defendant we've ever had. (Literally!)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nOh, Pearls. I have a big favor to ask.\nPearl:\nWhat is it, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt's about my magatama... Its spiritual power seems to have vanished.\nPearl:\nOh! That magatama brings back memories! I remember pouring my spiritual power into it. That was so many years ago... I guess that's why it's almost out now. ...There you go, Mr. Nick. It should be fine now.\nPhoenix:\nThank you, Pearls! Now I can break Psyche-Locks again.\nPearl:\nHee hee. I'm glad I could help! Well, I think I'll go find Mr. Marlon now. I have to bring Rifle to him.\nAthena:\nPearly sure seems right at home at this aquarium.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, you're right. But didn't she say this was her first time here...?\nBuckler:\nApparently, that girl was in the staff corridor earlier this morning. That's why the detective was questioning her.\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Pearls doing in the staff corridor?\nBuckler:\nI dunno. I thought she was Marlon's friend or something.\nPhoenix:\nThe staff corridor, huh...? Something about that doesn't sit well with me...\nOrca Pool Diagram updated in the Court Record.\nAthena:\nWell, if it bothers you, why don't you just ask her about it?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, good idea. Let's go catch up with her.\nWright Anything Agency\nPresent\nFish\nPhoenix:\nHey, Apollo. Think you could whip us up a little meal with these?\nApollo:\nFish? I haven't had fish for a while, come to think of it... ...The obvious question, though, is \"What are you doing with a bunch of raw fish?!\"\nAthena:\nIt's to feed the penguin with!\nApollo:\nPenguin?! So why are you giving it to me to cook?!\nPhoenix:\nOh, I dunno. I just happened to think of it, and I was hungry.\nApollo:\nThen why don't we all go out for sushi when you wrap up the investigation?\nAthena:\nOh, you're going to treat us?! How sweet of you! I'll start with tuna!\nPhoenix:\nThat's really generous of you, Apollo. Don't forget to invite Trucy, too.\nApollo:\n...Why did I even open my mouth?\nAqua Tunnel (before clearing all Talk options with Pearl Fey and Sasha Buckler in Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool)\nTalk\nWhat to do\nAthena:\nChecking out the scene is important, but we can't forget to question people, too! We need to get some insight on how people are feeling.\nPhoenix:\nBut we should give the scene another look, too, though. We might've missed something.\nAthena:\nOf course! That's one of the basic rules of investigating! \"The lawyer always returns to the scene of the investigation.\"\nPhoenix:\nWasn't that \"The criminal always returns to the scene of the crime\"?\nAny ideas?\nAthena:\nThere sure are a lot of interesting characters at Shipshape Aquarium!\nPhoenix:\nI'll say. It's like a wild pirate ship.\nAthena:\nI guess they really wanted to give the place an authentic piratey flavor. Like the sea-bottom Aqua Tunnel, and the Exploration Corner, \"where pirates gather\"!\nWidget:\nArr! Let's have some fun, me hearties!\nAthena:\nY-Yikes! Widget, you scared me!\nPhoenix:\n...Let's save the pirate fun for AFTER the investigation, shall we?\nPresent\nFish\nAthena:\nUgh. That smells awful! Please keep it away from me!\nPhoenix:\nBut you're the one who wanted it. Why do I have to carry it?\nAthena:\nOrla sure eats a lot, doesn't she? I used to eat a lot when I was a kid. Took lots of naps, too!\nPhoenix:\nAnd you still take lots of naps, right here at the office.\nAthena:\nWhat?! You knew about that?! I-It's this new thing I'm trying out! Um... sleep learning! Yeah, that's the ticket!\nPhoenix:\n(Not buying it.)\nJuly 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Mr. Rimes and Pearls are talking.)\nRimes:\nAhoy! Based Small Fry was so clutch with the assist! Rimes n' Rifle reunion, a tale endin' in bliss! Now animal keeper Rimes ain't gonna get cut! Mad props, Small Fry, this case is now shut! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo!\nPearl:\nHee hee. It was my pleasure. See you again sometime, Rifle!\nRifle:\nKree...\nRimes:\nOkay, let's go Rifle. See ya, Small Fry!\nPearl:\nOh, Mr. Nick! I didn't see you there.\nTalk\nRelation to Rimes\nAthena:\nHey, Pearly, you and Mr. Rimes seem to be really good friends.\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell us more about your relationship?\nPearl:\n! W-Well, I...\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nPhoenix:\nUm, Pearls, why do I see a Psyche-Lock?\nPearl:\nUm... I'm sorry, Mr. Nick... But I really shouldn't talk about it...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I don't really feel right about digging into Pearls's affairs... But she was here at the aquarium at the time of the incident... Whatever she's hiding could help us in court! Sorry Pearls, but I'll have to use my magatama ([X / Y / R]) on you.)\nPresent Magatama\nPhoenix:\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nPhoenix:\n(A Psyche-Lock... A lock on a person's heart that only I can see... The deeper the secret is hidden, the more locks there will be. Pearls only has one lock, so I should be able to undo it fairly easily. But if I make a mistake, I'll be locked in a loop and won't be able to move forward. Okay, time to give it a try.)\n-- Relation to Rimes --\nPhoenix:\nPearls, you have to tell me about your relationship with Mr. Rimes.\nPearl:\n\"Relationship\"? There is no \"relationship\" between Mr. Marlon and me. We're just a visitor to the aquarium and an animal keeper at the aquarium, that's all.\nPhoenix:\nBut there are areas where ordinary \"visitors to the aquarium\" don't get to go... You were here before the incident occurred, weren't you?\nPresent Staff Corridor\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Yes! That's right...\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nPearl:\nDo you have any proof I was there?\nPhoenix:\nProof...? No, can't say that I do... (Hmm... I'd better give it another try...)\nLeads back to:\n\"You were here before the incident occurred, weren't you?\"\nPearl:\nYes! That's right... ...But how did you know?\nPhoenix:\nSomeone told me you were there.\nPearl:\nI got confused and went the wrong way. I didn't know it was a corridor just for the staff. But that's all it was, Mr. Nick! It didn't have anything to do with Mr. Marlon.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds reasonable. I guess I'd better move on to my next topic.) Actually, there's something else I've been wondering about, Pearls... Why do you smell like fish?\nPearl:\nF-Fish? Wh-What makes you think I smell like fish?\nPhoenix:\nWell, there's a certain someone who convinced me it wasn't my imagination.\nPresent Rifle profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"R-Rifle...?!\"\nPresent anyone else\nPhoenix:\nPearl:\nIs there something you want to say about that person...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Oh, I guess not... (When it comes to sniffing out the smell of fish, there's only one nose that I can rely on!) Pearls, I want you to be honest with me.\nLeads back to:\n\"Why do you smell like fish?\"\nPearl:\nR-Rifle...?!\nPhoenix:\nShe's apparently very attracted to the smell of fish. Rifle didn't want anything to do with Athena, even though she had a bunch of fish. So why then, was Rifle so attracted to you, Pearls?\nPearl:\nErrr... I don't know...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Looks like she's still not ready to talk about it.) You had an object with you that smelled fishy, too. In fact, I think this has something to do with your secret.\nPresent Calendar\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The fishy smelling calendar has something to do with your secret, doesn't it, Pearls?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Nick... ...but I don't see how that relates to me.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that wasn't it. The key here is something that smells fishy.) Let me try that again, Pearls.\nLeads back to:\n\"In fact, I think this has something to do with your secret.\"\nPhoenix:\nThe fishy-smelling calendar has something to do with your secret, doesn't it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nA-Aaaaaaah! I... I can't lie to you, Mr. Nick... I'll tell you about me and Mr. Marlon, and about the calendar.\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nPhoenix:\n(Whew. It was only one lock, but it sure took some work!)\nRelation to Rimes (after breaking Psyche-Lock)\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell me about your relationship with Mr. Rimes.\nPearl:\nI became distracted by the gift shop almost as soon as we got to the aquarium. Before I knew it, everyone else had moved on, and I got lost. I was so embarrassed to be lost at my age!\nPhoenix:\nOh, Pearls. I know big, crowded places are hard for you.\nPearl:\nI sort of panicked... and went down the wrong corridor. I ended up in the food prep room, and that's where I met Mr. Marlon. I really startled him when I called out to him. He jumped so much, he startled me, too, and I lost my balance and fell down. Oh, Mr. Nick! I spilled so many fish all over the floor!\nPhoenix:\nI guess that explains why you smell fishy, pardon the pun.\nPearl:\nYes. And my calendar fell off my bag and got buried in all the fish, too.\nPhoenix:\n(But it doesn't explain why Pearls wanted to keep it a secret.)\nWhy did you hide it? (appears after \"Relation to Rimes\")\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you want to hide your meeting with Mr. Rimes?\nPearl:\nWell, I didn't want him to get in trouble over feed sanitation regulations because of me. And Mr. Marlon said he didn't want anyone to know he was in the food prep room.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Why not? What was he doing in there?\nPearl:\nBefore I spoke to him, he was staring at a calendar. But, because of me, he dropped his calendar, too. We had to search for it among the fish.\nAthena:\nWait a minute... This calendar of yours... It already has writing in it!\nPearl:\nIt does? But I didn't write anything in it yet!\nAthena:\nThere's something written here under today's date. \"Meet the captain at the orca pool at 7 AM.\"\nPearl:\nMaybe my calendar and Mr. Marlon's got mixed up?\nPhoenix:\nPearls, about what time did you run into Mr. Rimes?\nPearl:\nI think it was about 10:15 when he had the info desk announce that I was lost... So I must have first gone into the prep room at about 10:10.\nPhoenix:\nI see... Do you mind if I hang on to this calendar for a while? It might be a clue to the victim's movements before he was killed.\nPearl:\n...All right. But be sure to give it back to Mr. Marlon later, okay?\nCalendar updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(Good. Now maybe I'm ready to remove Ms. DePlume's Psyche-Locks, too.)\nWhy did you hide it? (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you want to hide your meeting with Mr. Rimes?\nPearl:\nWell, I didn't want him to get in trouble over feed sanitation regulations because of me. And Mr. Marlon said he didn't want anyone to know he was in the food prep room.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Why not? What was he doing in there?\nPearl:\nBefore I spoke to him, he was staring at a calendar.

Now maybe I'm ready to remove Ms. DePlume's Psyche-Locks, too.)\nAfter clearing \"Why did you hide it?\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel:\nJuly 20Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger\nDePlume:\nYou people again? You're becoming quite the nuisance. If that veterinarian won't come out, then I might just have to give up and leave.\nAthena:\nVeterinarian...? Is that the \"Dr. Crab\" Mr. Rimes was talking about?\nDePlume:\nYou are correct. He likes to shut himself up in that back room there and won't come out. But I don't think he's even in there today, so I'm about ready to go home.\nPhoenix:\n(She sure seems to know a lot about the workings of this aquarium. And maybe a little something about the incident this morning, too.)\nAthena:\nMr. Wright! This is no time to be standing there thinking to yourself! It's time to put your psychedelic clock skills to work and uncover her secret!\nPhoenix:\nThat's \"Psyche-Lock,\" Athena. \"Psyche-Lock.\"\nTalk\nWhy you're here\nAthena:\nI thought they closed the aquarium and weren't letting members of the public in?\nDePlume:\nOh ho ho! But I have special permission, you see.\nPhoenix:\nAnd why exactly is that, if I may ask?\nDePlume:\nWell, because of the incide-- Heavens! I've said too much.\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(All right. Now that I can see her Psyche-Locks again... ...I just have to tap my Magatama to start removing them!)\nPresent Magatama\nPhoenix:\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- Why You're Here --\nPhoenix:\nMs. DePlume, I want you to tell me the secret you're hiding.\nDePlume:\nI'll do nothing of the sort! It would mean breaking my promise.\nPhoenix:\nI don't know who you made this promise to... but you WILL tell me. You're not an aquarium employee, and yet, here you are, after the place has closed. That must mean you're connected to the incident involving the owner somehow.\nDePlume:\nOh ho ho! I don't know anything about any \"incident\" involving the owner.\nPhoenix:\nNo, I think you do. I have a piece of evidence here that suggests you DO know something.\nPresent Security Footage\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"According to Detective Fulbright, this shows the orca attacking the victim.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou won't be able to evade my question once you've seen this!\nDePlume:\n...What is the point of showing me that, blue boy?\nPhoenix:\nEr... (I guess this wasn't it. I know I have something here somewhere that shows Ms. DePlume knows something.) ...All right, then. Let me try one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"I have a piece of evidence here that suggests you DO know something.\"\nPhoenix:\nAccording to Detective Fulbright, this shows the orca attacking the victim. And the person in this footage... is wearing an outfit just like yours, Ms. DePlume.\nDePlume:\nOh! I suppose there is no hiding this bombshell figure, is there? Yes, it is I.\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nPhoenix:\nAnd I think I can guess why you're here at the aquarium. You aren't simply a visitor to the aquarium; what you really are is...\nA police investigator\nPhoenix:\nYou are a police investigator.\nDePlume:\nOh ho ho! You're completely off the mark. I think you know full well that I am NOT a police investigator.\nPhoenix:\n(I full well did NOT know that.)\nLeads back to:\n\"You aren't simply a visitor to the aquarium; what you really are is...\"\nA witness to the murder\nLeads to:\n\"You are a visitor who also happened to witness the death of owner Jack Shipley.\"\nA Shipshape employee\nPhoenix:\nI've got it! You are... (Now, what did they call them here again...?) You're a \"crew member\" of Shipshape Aquarium!\nDePlume:\nOh ho ho! What amusing jokes you tell, blue boy. Even a child could tell you I am NOT an employee here. And please don't call them \"crew members.\" Have you no self-respect at all?\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! All right, fine. It's not like I wanted to call them that in the first place!)\nLeads back to:\n\"You aren't simply a visitor to the aquarium; what you really are is...\"\nPhoenix:\nYou are a visitor who also happened to witness the death of owner Jack Shipley.\nDePlume:\nThat is cor-- Oh, I want to say it! But I promised the police...\nPhoenix:\nIt's not good for you to keep things inside, you know. I'm sure you'll feel much better once you get it all out.\nDePlume:\nI-I-I... I give up! I'll tell you everythiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nPhoenix:\n(If she wanted to tell me this badly, why couldn't she have just done so from the top?)\nDePlume:\nI think anyone would agree that I held it in for as long as I could! But I couldn't be expected to withstand this commoner's badgering any longer!\nPhoenix:\nP-Please calm yourself, Ms. DePlume! (And that's \"top-class badgering\" to you!)\nDePlume:\nYou are correct. I witnessed the killer whale's crime with my own eyes! You got a problem with that, blue boy?!\nAthena:\nBoss, Ms. DePlume's anger is so powerful... ...even I feel like I'm about to explode! You have to do something! Quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Please don't explode on me...)\nWhy you're here (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nPhoenix:\nCould you start with telling me what you saw?\nDePlume:\nI witnessed the very moment the killer whale attacked the victim. I told the police what I saw as well. I'm the sort of person who simply can't rest until the truth is known.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... So both Ms. DePlume's statement and the footage point to Orla's guilt...)\nAthena:\nHm? Pardon me, but you seem pretty pleased that you witnessed this incident...\nDePlume:\nWhat? \"Pleased\"? Shame on you! Are you implying that I am happy about an innocent man's death?!\nAthena:\nN-No, of course not! I... I just don't get the sense that you were afraid of Orla. It's more like you were... interested in her.\nDePlume:\nAre you...? You know, I wasn't sure, but I was thinking that maybe... Are you perhaps one of my fans? Is that how you knew... ...that I am THE nonfiction writer, Norma DePlume?!\nAthena:\nOh! THAT Norma DePlume!\nPhoenix:\nSo... big fan, huh?\nAthena:\nNo! I've never even heard of her!\nDePlume:\nWell, now that you've figured me out, there's no sense in trying to hide who I am, I suppose. Talking to fans is part of a writer's duty, after all! Oh ho ho!\nAthena:\nB-But I'm not a fan, I tell you...\nNonfiction writer (appears after \"Why you're here\")\nPhoenix:\nSo what exactly have you written, Ms. DePlume?\nDePlume:\nOh, my. You mean to say you truly aren't familiar with my work? I write the truth. I take great pride in my craft, you know. I've been gathering information on Orla the killer whale for a year now. I've been very worried about Orla's violent tendencies... And today, my concern was proven to be well justified!\nAthena:\nOrla isn't violent! She's a sweet and gentle soul!\nDePlume:\nOh ho ho! The moment you let your guard down with that killer whale... CHOMP! Shipshape Aquarium has always denied the killer whale's violent streak. But it has been rumored to attack people...\nAthena:\nBut rumors are just rumors! They aren't necessarily true!\nDePlume:\nYes, I realize that. But I only write the truth. That is why I questioned the owner directly. But he refused to allow my research, and he even had the audacity to say to me: \"You're nothing but a nuisance, coming here day after day. Don't ever come back again!\"\nPhoenix:\n(It sounds like her \"research\" was a bit too much to take...)\nAthena:\nBut then... how did you get in here if you've been blacklisted?\nDePlume:\nI have my methods. Oh ho ho!\nPhoenix:\n(This lady is shameless.)\nOrla's violent streak (appears after \"Nonfiction writer\")\nLeads to:\n\"We won't let you speak badly of Orla! We're going to defend her!\"\nAthena:\nWe won't let you speak badly of Orla! We're going to defend her!\nDePlume:\nI'm only stating what I saw with my very own eyes. I came to the aquarium today to observe the killer whale. But on my way to that thing's tank, I heard its cries.\nAthena:\nYou can hear Orla from the visitor's corridor?\nDePlume:\nThere are speakers there in the corridor, up near the ceiling. Apparently, that speaker is there so visitors can hear the killer whale's sounds. In any case, as I approached the killer whale's tank, I heard its cries. And when I arrived, I saw something terrifying.\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you see?\nDePlume:\nThe killer whale stealing the Swashbuckler Spectacular hat the owner was wearing... ...and then, the moment it bit him and shook him mercilessly to death within its jaws!\nAthena:\nWh-Whaaaaaaat?!\nPhoenix:\nOrla... bit the owner to death...?!\nFulbright:\nIn justice we trust! So I take it Ms. DePlume's just finished telling you what she saw?\nPhoenix:\nD-Detective Fulbright! I guess you've already heard it, too?\nFulbright:\nYup, when we took her statement earlier. As you heard, I'm afraid that accidental death is really the only thing it could be.\nDePlume:\nYes! And a dangerous creature like that cannot be allowed to harm anyone ever again!\nPhoenix:\nB-But she's not dangerous!\nFulbright:\nSorry, but the Prosecutor's Office said the case didn't have enough merit to go to trial. There was one prosecutor, though, who expressed an interest in the case...\nPhoenix:\nReally?! Then could we have that prosecutor take a look at the investigation reports?\nFulbright:\nUnfortunately, I doubt even he'd take action without evidence of a homicide... Look, I understand how you feel, Mr. Lawyer, but maybe you should give up on this one?\nPhoenix:\nNot a chance. We'll just re-examine the crime scene and strengthen our case.\nFulbright:\nWell, if that's your version of justice, I won't stop you.\nAthena:\nAnd we won't rest until we find proof it wasn't \"accidental death,\" Detective! You'll see! Let's go, Mr. Wright! Time to check out that crime scene one more time!\nJuly 20Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool\nAthena:\nAll right, then! Let's start the re-examination! Pronto! I'm going to go check out that mess in the back one more time!\nPhoenix:\nAthena! Wait! No running!\nAthena:\nAaaaaaaaagh!\nPhoenix:\nA-Are you okay? (It didn't look like she tripped, but...)\nAthena:\n*groan* I slipped.\nOrla:\nFweet!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Orla? What is it, girl?\nAthena:\nAaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nAthena! Are you all right?! (She crashed into all that stuff behind her.)\nAthena:\n*groan* I tried to get out of the way, but all I did was slip and fall... again...\nPhoenix:\nThat was a pretty amazing wipeout. Are you hurt?\nAthena:\nI'm okay... But why did Orla spike that ball at me? After all the fish I gave her, I thought she liked me...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe she thought you were the main entr\u00e9e?\nAthena:\nVery funny, Boss!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. In any case, let's give the ball back to Orla.\nAthena:\nHuh? Looks like everything got shifted around when I fell on it.\nPhoenix:\nHey, you're right. There are things now that we couldn't see before. (Like another ball. I guess Orla really likes them.)\nAthena:\nLook! There's something new by the outline of the body, too!\nPhoenix:\nWe'd better take a good look around.\nExamine\nBoxes and props\nBall\nPhoenix:\nOrla sure can hit that ball hard!\nAthena:\nI didn't think she was gonna spike it at me like that. I guess that must mean she likes me! I gladly accept her expression of affection!\nPhoenix:\n...Not how I would've interpreted that, but whatever floats your boat.\nOctopus leg\nPhoenix:\nLooks like we just found that giant octopus prop's missing leg.\nAthena:\nWow. I bet you could get a whole lot of Carpaccio from a giant leg like that! Ooh, let's go to the ocean and try and catch a giant octopus of our own!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but even if we did catch one, how are you planning to slice it up?\nAthena:\nKein Problem! That's what man invented chainsaws for!\nPhoenix:\n(I've never seen anyone so hell-bent on chomping down some giant octopus...)    Well, I doubt we could catch one that big anywhere near the shore, anyway...\nAthena:\nThe more roadblocks you throw up, the more I want to do it, you know. Ooh, I can't wait to get started!\nPhoenix:\n(It would appear that Operation Discourage Insanity has backfired...)\nFootstep icons\nAthena:\nHey, look at this mark on the floor. What do you suppose it is?\nBuckler:\nThat's where we stand when we want to play volleyball with Orla.\nPhoenix:\nVolleyball, huh?\nBuckler:\nYeah. If we stand there, she'll spike the ball right at us.\nAthena:\nSo when Orla spiked the ball at me earlier... ...that was one of her tricks?! It doesn't mean she hates me?!\nBuckler:\nNah! She wanted to play with you! She loves volleyball. She used to play with the captain all the time...\nAthena:\nAw... Sasha looks so sad...\nBuckler:\nOkay, time to snap out of it! This is no time to be all dejected and mopey like a blobfish!\nAthena:\nThat's right! Time to put on a smile and stay strong, right?\nPhoenix:\n(What's a blobfish? ...Or do I not want to know...)\nBloody coin\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? A coin...?\nAthena:\nM-Mr. Wright! There's blood on it!\nPhoenix:\nYou're right! But it's dried.\nAthena:\nDo you think it could be the victim's? And what was it doing all the way over here in the first place?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I'm not sure, but now that we've found blood outside the pool... ...it just might help us prove that there's more to this case than just \"accidental death.\"\nAthena:\nHey, you're right! Orla certainly can't leave the pool, after all!\nBloodstained Coin added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nSpeaking of coins, take a look at this. There are a few coins around the body here, too.\nAthena:\nYou're right, Boss! But where did they go? They aren't here anymore. You don't think somebody picked them up, do you?\nBloody coin (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? A coin...?\nAthena:\nM-Mr. Wright! There's blood on it!\nPhoenix:\nYou're right! But it's dried.\nAthena:\nDo you think it could be the victim's? And what was it doing all the way over here in the first place?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I'm not sure, but now that we've found blood outside the pool... ...it just might help us prove that there's more to this case than just \"accidental death.\"\nAthena:\nHey, you're right! Orla certainly can't leave the pool, after all!\nPhoenix:\nSpeaking of coins, take a look at this. There are a few coins around the body here, too.\nAthena:\nYou're right, Boss! But where did they go? They aren't here anymore. You don't think somebody picked them up, do you?\nBroken sword\nPhoenix:\nThere's a broken sword here.\nAthena:\nHmm... The tip of the blade is missing. Guess it just broke off.\nPhoenix:\n(Don't tell me it happened when Athena fell over...?)\nAthena:\nYou'd better not be trying to pin the blame on me, Boss!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! N-No! Of course not!\nAthena:\nNo use trying to hide it. It's written all over your face! Besides, the broken part isn't even here. How could it have been my fault?!\nPhoenix:\n(I'd better watch what I think or I'll get every little thing thrown back in my face.)\nDummy\nAthena:\nOh no! That child is hurt!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! Call an ambulance-- Hey, it's just a dummy.\nAthena:\nI-It is?! Oh, I mean, of course it is! I was just testing your response to an emergency.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess we just found that you don't bluff well under pressure.\nAthena:\nGrr! I guess I'll just have to keep practicing, then! I wonder what the dummy is for, anyway?\nBuckler:\nOh, that? We use it to train Orla. It's smaller than a human, but it does the job. Some of our tricks can be pretty dangerous, so Orla practices them on the dummy first.\nPhoenix:\n(Forget the tricks, those bite marks look pretty dangerous...)\nAfter examining footstep icons, bloody coin, and dummy:\nPhoenix:\nHey, Sasha? Would you happen to know anything about this coin?\nBuckler:\nOh, I guess I missed one. I just finished cleaning up the rest of them.\nPhoenix:\nYou picked up all of the coins already?\nBuckler:\nThat's right. After the police finished their investigation, they gave me the go-ahead. I haven't found them all yet, though. I'm still missing a few.\nAthena:\nWell, if they aren't beside the pool, maybe they're IN the pool. Let's go to that ladder over there and take a peek at the bottom of the pool, Boss!\nExamine\nLeft or right side of ladder\nPhoenix:\n(I can't see anything from here. I'll have to take a look when I'm by the ladder...)\nFront side of ladder\nBottom of pool\nLeads to:\n\"Look! I think I see something on the bottom of the pool.\"\nPhoenix:\nLook! I think I see something on the bottom of the pool.\nAthena:\nHee hee! I knew it! Want me to go down and check?\nPhoenix:\nYou can't jump in dressed like that! You'll drown under the weight of your clothes!\nAthena:\nNo, I won't! I'm a pretty good swimmer, you know!\nPhoenix\n...Be that as it may, that pool's really deep. I doubt you can hold your breath that long. But maybe Sasha can...?\nBuckler:\nWhew! Phoenix! Look at all these coins I found at the bottom!\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Sasha. So there really were more of them down there, huh?\nAthena:\nWe seem to be finding them all over. I wonder how many there are all together?\nBuckler:\nIncluding the ones I put away, there are three hundred of them. They're for the show. (Changed from [Including the ones I put away, there are 300 of them. They're for the show.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Sounds like they'd be heavy.\nBuckler:\nAbout seven pounds, I'd say. A little lighter than a stringfish. Well, I'd better go put these coins away where they belong!\nAthena:\nSo, seven pounds of coins, scattered around the scene, one of them with blood on it... They have to be related to the case!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder how the blood got on that one coin? Wait a minute. Could it be...?) Remember how Detective Fulbright said that they couldn't find a murder weapon? Well, what if these coins were the weapon?\nAthena:\nHuh? How could a little coin kill a grown man?\nPhoenix:\nWell, one coin by itself isn't much of a threat, but... Three hundred coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is... (Changed from [300 coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is...] in the original release)\nFreeze them\nPhoenix:\nI bet a frozen lump of coins would make for a pretty good weapon.\nAthena:\nBut wouldn't it make more sense to freeze just the water into a block of ice? That way, there'd be no evidence of it ever existing once it melted.\nPhoenix:\n...I guess you're right. (But, wait a minute. There IS another way to bundle coins together!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Three hundred coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is...\"\nPut them in a bag\nLeads to:\n\"If you put seven pounds of coins in a bag and swung it at somebody...\"\nThrow them\nPhoenix:\nI bet you could kill a man if you threw them hard enough.\nAthena:\nHmm... I dunno about that. I think they'd just bounce off. Besides, how could you throw them that hard all at once?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... (Wait a minute...! Maybe there IS a way to bundle them all together...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Three hundred coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is...\"\nPhoenix:\nIf you put seven pounds of coins in a bag and swung it at somebody... ...it would make a pretty formidable blunt instrument, wouldn't it? It would explain how blood got on this coin.\nAthena:\nOh, I get it! If that bag of coins is the weapon, then we can use it to prove Orla's innocence!\nBloodstained Coin updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nBut I don't see anything resembling a coin bag around here.\nAthena:\nMaybe the killer took it with them.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it would certainly make it look like Orla did it if they did...\nAthena:\nYou know what I think, Mr. Wright?! The bloody coin alone should be enough to prove this might have been a murder!\nPhoenix:\nI agree. It shows the possibility of a human killer rather than Orla.\nAthena:\nYes! This is just what we needed! Let's go show this coin to Detective Fulbright and Ms. DePlume right away!\nPhoenix:\nGood idea. Let's hope they're still at the Pub O' Danger.\nJuly 20Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger\nFulbright:\nOh, you're back! So did you find anything?\nDePlume:\nOf course he didn't!\nFulbright:\nRemember, even if you don't succeed, it's the effort you make that's important!\nPhoenix:\n(Is he trying to console me?)\nAthena:\nLet's show them the evidence we found! The one that points to a human culprit!\nPhoenix:\nRight. Because we won't let Orla be put down.\nTalk\nOrla's violent streak\nAthena:\nWe won't let you speak badly of Orla! We're going to defend her!\nDePlume:\nI'm only stating what I saw with my very own eyes. I came to the aquarium today to observe the killer whale. But on my way to that thing's tank, I heard its cries.\nAthena:\nYou can hear Orla from the visitor's corridor?\nDePlume:\nThere are speakers there in the corridor, up near the ceiling. Apparently, that speaker is there so visitors can hear the killer whale's sounds. In any case, as I approached the killer whale's tank, I heard its cries. And when I arrived, I saw something terrifying.\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you see?\nDePlume:\nThe killer whale stealing the Swashbuckler Spectacular hat the owner was wearing... ...and then, the moment it bit him and shook him mercilessly to death within its jaws!\nAthena:\nWh-Whaaaaaaat?!\nPhoenix:\nOrla... bit the owner to death...?!\nPresent\nBloodstained Coin\nLeads to:\n\"Please take a look at this bloodstained coin.\"\nPhoenix:\nPlease take a look at this bloodstained coin.\nDePlume:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeek! C-Cease and desist, at once! Wh-What kind of a man shows a lady blood?\nPhoenix:\nUrk. (She doesn't have to get so worked up...)\nFulbright:\nWhat are you terrorizing this lady with?! Come on, now. Let's see it.\nPhoenix:\nWe found this coin beside the orca pool.\nFulbright:\nWe did see a large number of coins beside the pool, but not one with blood on it!\nPhoenix:\nWe just learned that there's three hundred of these, weighing about seven pounds in total. (Changed from [We just learned that there's 300 of these, weighing about seven pounds all together.] in the original release) Now, what do you suppose would happen if a person was assaulted with that many coins?\nFulbright:\nWhat?! So you're saying the coins might've been used like some kind of blunt weapon?!\nPhoenix:\nIf the blood belongs to the victim, then yes, it's entirely possible!\nFulbright:\nHmm... But I wouldn't call it decisive proof that the real culprit was human...\nPhoenix:\nY-You wouldn't?! Why not?!\nFulbright:\nBecause there'd have to be something to put the coins in to make them into a weapon. Without that \"something\", it's just not going to be enough to pass muster. But I will say that your theory does seem to warrant further investigation. I'll call the Prosecutor's Office and ask to reinvestigate from a possible criminal angle.\nPhoenix:\n...You will?! Thank you very much!\nAthena:\nI really hope Detective Fulbright can convince them...\nFulbright:\nHmmmm... You won't believe the answer I got. When I explained your passion for this case, and the police's investigation... ...they said that the prosecutor I mentioned earlier would be willing to take this to court.\nPhoenix:\nReally?! So does that mean a new suspect has emerged?\nFulbright:\nNo, I'm afraid not... To be frank... ...Prosecutor Blackquill said he just wants to prove that orca's guilt in court!\nAthena:\nWHAAAAAAAT?! It's Prosecutor Blackquill that wants to prosecute Orla?!\nPhoenix:\n...That's fine, Detective. Thanks for arranging this for us.\nFulbright:\nWell, I must say you're taking this rather calmly.\nPhoenix:\nDefending Orla in court was my idea from the start. And I'll do whatever it takes to save her.\nFulbright:\nHmm... In that case, I'll do whatever I can as well to see that justice is served. Ms. DePlume, will you be a witness for the prosecution?\nDePlume:\nA trial for a killer whale? I've never heard of such recklessness before in my life! But I will reveal the truth about this killer whale, and then write all about it!\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! Sounds like a plan! Now, if you'll just come along with me... We have to prepare for tomorrow, and I still have to arrange for an autopsy.\nDePlume:\nOh ho ho! I look forward to tomorrow! Until then, blue lawyer and yellow fan.\nAthena:\nI AM NOT A FAN!\nPhoenix:\n...Well, at least we managed to get the case to go to trial.\nAthena:\nBut how in the world do we defend an orca in court, anyway?\nPhoenix:\nTo be honest, I'm not really sure myself.\nAthena:\nPlus, Ms. DePlume said Orla bit the victim... This trial sure isn't going to be easy... ...but I love a challenge!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. Then we ought to be just fine. Guess I should go over that Swashbuckler Spectacular you were watching this morning.\nAthena:\nYeah! We can have a formal viewing back at the office!\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing decisive against Orla in the security tape, but that doesn't mean much. I'll just have to find a more concrete way to save Orla at tomorrow's trial or else!)\nTo be continued\nOrca Pool (before correctly presenting Bloodstained Coin in Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger)\nExamine\nLadder\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I've seen enough of the inside the pool...

Chipper as ever this morning, I see.\nAthena:\nI'm just thankful we actually get to have a trial for Orla. As a matter of fact, I just ran a few laps around the courthouse to get extra pumped!\nPhoenix:\n(And I just splashed my face with some water to get the sleep out of my eyes...)\nAthena:\nOh, I also cued the Swashbuckler video so we can watch it any time.\nSwashbuckler Video added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThanks. It just might help our case. By the way, you have some serious dark circles. Did you stay up late watching this?\nAthena:\nWhat?! M-Me? No, I, uh, just woke up early, that's all. ...Guess I need to cover them up. I get ragged on enough as it is by Prosecutor Blackquill.\nPhoenix:\nSpeaking of being pumped, I'm pretty fired up for this trial, too. It's been a while.\nAthena:\nHee hee. That explains why your hair is spikier than usual. I mean, look at it! It's all super pokey and prickly and stuff. It's amazing!\nPhoenix:\n(...That was a compliment... right?)\nPearl:\nGood luck, Mr. Nick! I'll be cheering you on from the gallery.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Pearls. It's been so long, I'm actually a little nervous.\nRimes:\nGood morning, Mr. Lawyer!\nAthena:\nOh, Mr. Rimes! You came to watch the trial?\nRimes:\nYeah. Sasha is back at the aquarium with the orca... ...so I thought I'd better come here to watch for her.\nAthena:\nWell, don't you worry! We're going to win for Orla! Isn't that right, Boss?!\nPhoenix:\n(Right. One unprecedented trial, coming right up!)\nJuly 21, 9:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4\nDay 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Orla Shipley.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nBlackquill:\nHmph............ Must we waste words on this?\nPhoenix:\n(Prosecutor Simon Blackquill... Known as the \"Twisted Samurai,\" he's a prosecutor who's also a convicted felon. They say he never conducts a trial without his loyal hawk Taka by his side.)\nJudge:\n...Mr. Wright, it's been quite a while since I've seen you like that. The lawyer image suits you. You look younger somehow.\nPhoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. And you look as young as ever yourself.\nJudge:\nHa ha ha. Well, I have to keep up with you folks, after all. By the way, has the defendant arrived in court yet?\nBlackquill:\n...Surely you jest, Your Baldness. Did you not receive the memo? The defendant, Ora Shipley, is an orca at Shipshape Aquarium.\nJudge:\nA-An orcaaaaaaaaaaaaa?! Arrangements for this trial were made only yesterday, so I didn't have time to review. But an orca as a defendant? It's patently absurd!\nBlackquill:\nHmph......... Direct your comments to the defense. He's the absurd fellow who insisted on defending the orca in court in the first place.\nPhoenix:\nAbsurd or not, I will carry out my duty to defend my client.\nJudge:\nYour duty to defend your \"crying ant\"? Don't you mean your \"crying orca,\" Mr. Wright?\nBlackquill:\nIf we are to proceed, we must treat the orca as we would any other defendant. Every soul -- be it of man or beast -- is of equal value. The question is whether that soul is painted in black or white. Take Taka for example. He is as human in spirit as you or I.\nTaka:\nScreech!\nPhoenix:\n(The real question is, am I in for more pain... as always?)\nJudge:\nHmm... Orca or not, I suppose the defendant is still a defendant. And I vow to render my verdict fairly and impartially! *ahem* Now then, Prosecutor Blackquill, your opening statement, if you would.\nBlackquill:\nI suppose I can hardly leave it to someone who knew nothing of the defendant... Very well. Listen carefully. The orca murdered the owner of Shipshape Aquarium in the aquarium's orca pool. The orca apparently toyed with the victim mercilessly as he died.\nJudge:\nA sadistic orca... What a chilling thought. And where exactly is this defendant now?\nBlackquill:\nInside this.\nJudge:\nA-A cell phone, Prosecutor Blackquill?\nBlackquill:\nHmph... Time marches on, Your Baldness -- with or without us. I borrowed this TV phone from the aquarium, which will allow us to interact with the orca.\nJudge:\nA \"TV phone\"? Very well. The court accepts it into evidence.\nTV Phone added to the Court Record.\nBlackquill:\nWe will be able to view the defendant in question on this large monitor. Fool Bright, prepare for transmission.\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! You've got it, Prosecutor Blackquill!\nBlackquill:\nWe will proceed with the defendant on telecast.\nJudge:\nHmm... So that is the orca that stands accused, is it?\nOrla:\nFwee, fweet!\nPhoenix:\n(Aw. She's waving her flipper at us. Maybe she's cheering us on?)\nBuckler:\nOrla, wish Phoenix and Athena luck!\nOrla:\nFweeeet!\nJudge:\nOh, it's quite cute, isn't it? And this adorable creature is suspected of killing a man...?\nAthena:\nOrla's really pouring on the charm, huh!\nBlackquill:\nShe is far from \"cute.\" She is a violent, reckless animal.\nFulbright:\nThat's right! The name's Bobby Fulbright, and I'll take over the explaining from here. Now, if I could direct your attention to this diagram of the crime scene. Following the report of an orca attack, we the police raced on over to Shipshape Aquarium. There, we found a guest who says she saw the orca and the victim from the visitor's corridor. As the witness was watching, the orca suddenly went crazy and attacked the victim. The orca was the only one there; therefore, no one else could have committed the crime. It's not quite finished, but I have a portion of the autopsy report here.\nShipley's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nI can't imagine the terror of being attacked underwater by such a large creature...\nBlackquill:\nBut attack it did. Prepare yourself for the grisly details, Your Baldness. The prosecution moves to introduce our witness. ...Fool Bright.\nFulbright:\nYou got it, Prosecutor Blackquill! In justice we trust! One brave lady whose fine sense of justice compelled her to speak, coming right up!\nDePlume:\nHow dare you make me wait? Don't you know I'm a busy woman?! I could have written an entire book for all the time I spent in that lobby!\nJudge:\nUm... Prosecutor Blackquill?\nBlackquill:\n............Well?\nDePlume:\nI am Norma DePlume, and I'm a nonfiction writer.\nPhoenix:\n(Am I the only one who isn't telepathic here?)\nAthena:\nLooks like she can read into people's words just as well as I can read into people's hearts.\nPhoenix:\nNot everything needs to be a competition, Athena...\nJudge:\nWhat?! Norma DePlume?! The great nonfiction writer, Ms. Norma DePlume herself?! I've read all of your works and enjoyed them immensely. Your million seller, \"The Great Grief of the Great Thief,\" is one of my favorites.\nDePlume:\nOh, are you a fan, Your Honor? I could give you my autograph, if you'd like.\nJudge:\nWait a second... I could swear you looked much different in the photos in your book......\nDePlume:\nWell, I use ones from ten years ago in my books so that paparazzi won't harass me.\nJudge:\n...!\nAthena:\nThe judge seems so shocked.\nPhoenix:\nThe visual disconnect must really be doing a number on His Honor's head...\nDePlume:\nCould we get started, please? If I find you to be lacking as a judge... ...you will see your debut in my books!\nJudge:\nSuch harsh comments...! You really MUST be the real Norma DePlume.\nPhoenix:\n(Who knew Ms. DePlume was so famous?)\nBlackquill:\nEnough jabbering. Tell the court what you saw, and keep it brief.\nDePlume:\nI would thank you to not order me around. I am perfectly willing to tell everyone what I witnessed. It was the moment of the murder!\nJudge:\n...Very well, then. Please proceed with your testimony.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Moment of the Murder --\nDePlume:\nI went to Shipshape Aquarium to see the killer whale.\nAs I was watching the killer whale from the visitor's corridor, it suddenly went crazy!\nI saw the killer whale bite the victim to death with its huge mouth and deadly teeth!\nAttempting to remain calm, I reported the incident to the police immediately.\nJudge:\nThe adorable defendant really did all that?! Hmm... It must be much more vicious than it looks...\nBlackquill:\nNow, deliver your judgment so I may carry out the sentence.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUmm... the defense would like to do some defending first, if that's all right...\nBlackquill:\nHmph... Must you drag this out with your tomfoolery?\nAthena:\nAthena:\nThe defense always has the right to cross-examine the witness, you know!\nBlackquill:\nA fellow inmate told me just this morning... \"If you want something signed, all you need is the document and a witness.\"\nPhoenix:\n...Let me guess. They were convicted for contract fraud, right?\nBlackquill:\n............ All we need in this case is the evidence and a witness to convict. It's as simple as that.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I guessed right.) Sorry, but as Ms. Cykes said... ...the defense has every right to cross-examine. Isn't that correct, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nYes, of course. You may proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nBlackquill:\n.........I shall relish the sight of you thrashing around in vain.\nCross Examination\n-- The Moment of the Murder --\nDePlume:\nI went to Shipshape Aquarium to see the killer whale.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you want to see the orca?\nDePlume:\nWell, it IS the featured attraction of the aquarium, after all.\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Why waste energy on such tripe? There is but one attraction in Shipshape Aquarium that is worth anyone's time... ...and that is the penguins. Isn't that right, Taka, my friend?\nPhoenix:\n(All righty then. I guess Prosecutor Blackquill is for the birds.)\nAthena:\nGuess I should jot that down. Note to self: Prosecutor Blackquill is on Team Rifle.\nJudge:\nAnd so you went to see the orca in its tank?\nDePlume:\nYes, that's right.\nDePlume:\nAs I was watching the killer whale from the visitor's corridor, it suddenly went crazy!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe orca suddenly went crazy, did she?\nDePlume:\nYes. It took a look at me, and then, all at once, it started going berserk!\nPhoenix:\nDid you do anything to make her angry?\nDePlume:\nI did nothing more than simply glare at it from the visitor's corridor!\nPhoenix:\n(She glared at Orla?) And that's what caused her to go berserk?\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nThe reason the defendant went mad is not the issue here. Only what she did once she entered that state.\nDePlume:\nIn any case, the killer whale began behaving wildly in front of my very eyes. And then...\nDePlume:\nI saw the killer whale bite the victim to death with its huge mouth and deadly teeth!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying you saw the very moment of the victim's death?\nDePlume:\nThat is exactly what I'm saying! Oh, it was simply dreadful! It was as frightening as losing one's manuscript just before a deadline!\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose for a writer, that would be pretty terrifying...)\nDePlume:\nI witnessed the killer whale's horrific act, and I knew I had to do something, so...\nPresent Shipley's Autopsy Report\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"It would seem that you are mistaken, Ms. DePlume.\"\nDePlume:\nAttempting to remain calm, I reported the incident to the police immediately.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhy were the police the first ones you contacted?\nDePlume:\nI was afraid if I told aquarium staff, they might try to cover it up. Of course, I immediately told aquarium security after my call to the police. I believe I deserve praise for my swift decision-making skills under pressure!\nPhoenix:\n...Ms. DePlume is the most assertive witness I've ever seen.\nAthena:\nWe'd better do our best to look like big-shot lawyers if we want to match her intensity!\nPhoenix:\nMs. DePlume, I praise your swift decision-making skills under pressure!\nAthena:\nThat was more \"kiss up\" than \"big shot\"...\nJudge:\nI suppose it was unrealistic to expect \"big shot\" from Mr. Wright...\nBlackquill:\nHmph. How fitting for a small fry to praise a big shot.\nPhoenix:\n(How about cutting this small fry some slack, you big meanies?)\nPhoenix:\n(The important thing here is, did she really see the \"moment of the murder\"?)\nAthena:\nYou're raring to go, aren't you, Mr. Wright? I see it in your eyes... and in your heart!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. I guess I really am a lawyer at heart.\nPhoenix:\nIt would seem that you are mistaken, Ms. DePlume.\nDePlume:\nI beg your pardon?!\nPhoenix:\nThe autopsy report does indeed say, \"Death thought to be result of orca attack\"... ...but the actual cause of death is \"contusion from head trauma,\" not \"being bitten\"!\nDePlume:\nWhat?! B-But...! But... I'm sure the victim was bitten!\nPhoenix:\nI don't believe that can be true. The security footage doesn't show anything of the kind.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph............ Just as I suspected. I knew you would peek at the footage behind Fool Bright's back.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, what did you expect when he wouldn't play nice and share?)\nBlackquill:\nBut, unfortunately for you... ...the footage you saw was only one small part.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nBlackquill:\nYesterday, after I decided to take this case to trial, I re-reviewed all of the evidence. Taka, the evidence I gave to you for safekeeping.\nTaka:\nScreech!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess that hawk is higher up on the pecking order than Fulbright in Blackquill's book.)\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Let's view the footage. Wh-What's this?! The orca is biting the victim!\nPhoenix:\nN-No waaaaaay!\nJudge:\nI have to say that this appears to be very damning evidence.\nSecurity Footage updated in the Court Record.\nAthena:\nNo... I can't believe Orla really bit him!\nBlackquill:\nAnd there is more... Look at this. This photograph was taken while the body was being examined.\nJudge:\nHmm... There seems to be a strange bruise on the victim's right wrist.\nBlackquill:\nI'll have the crime lab examine the bruise and calculate its relevance to the case at hand. What's important right now is evidence that points to the orca as the killer. Look at the left side of the body. See the orca's tooth marks in the victim's clothes?\nJudge:\nYes! They do appear to suggest that she did, in fact, bite the victim.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nPhoto of the Body updated in the Court Record.\nDePlume:\nI told you so! And then the killer whale swam up toward the surface with the victim in its mouth!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nH-However! In the autopsy report, the cause of death is \"contusion from head trauma\"!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nYou are much too impetuous, Wright-dono. Granted, the orca biting the victim was not the cause of death. The witness was mistaken about that.\nJudge:\nThen what explanation is there for what the witness saw?!\nBlackquill:\nDid I not say in the beginning, \"The orca toyed with the victim mercilessly\"?\nJudge:\nM-My goodness!\nBlackquill:\nAfter killing the victim, the defendant swam around with his dead body in her mouth. Just like any other predator toying with its prey!\nPhoenix:\n(Nrgh...!)\nAthena:\nM-Mr. Wright! The hearts of the people in the gallery are suddenly filled with fear -- fear of Orla!\nJudge:\nSo the defendant bit the victim after she had killed him... But if that's the case, then we must still figure out how the defendant killed the victim. Prosecutor Blackquill, do you have a sound theory to give to this court?\nBlackquill:\nI wouldn't be standing here if I couldn't prove whether the orca's heart was black or white.\nAthena:\nBut Orla is black AND white! ...Her body, I mean.\nPhoenix:\nAthena, please try not to provoke Prosecutor Blackquill.\nBlackquill:\nThe witness also observed the actual moment of the murder. Think back, Word Mistress. Think back to what you observed before the orca bit the victim.\nDePlume:\n...Ah, I see what you're driving at. So that was the true moment of the murder, was it?\nBlackquill:\nNow, explain it in a way that even these simpletons can understand.\nDePlume:\nThere you go again, ordering me around! Stop that this instant! But whatever... I don't mind telling my story. I saw the killer whale before it toyed with the body as well. I saw it the moment it killed the victim by head-butting him!\nPhoenix:\nO-Orla killed the victim by head-butting him?!\nDePlume:\nThat's right. It rammed the victim over and over again.\nBlackquill:\nRecall that the autopsy report stated that there were bruises all over his body. Recall as well, how persistent the defendant can be when she's attacking her prey.\nDePlume:\nAnd we all just saw the killer whale head-butting the victim in the footage, don't forget.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... That footage backs up Ms. DePlume's testimony... But there's also something very important it does NOT show...!)\nDePlume:\nNow do you see what a menace this killer whale is?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, but I can't allow your testimony to stand unchallenged. Looking at this footage, the orca certainly seems to be head-butting something... ...but you'll note that the \"something\" is not the victim!\nDePlume:\nOh! ...Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nPhoenix:\n(I want to look away... but I can't...) Even if it was the victim, you couldn't have seen him from where you were, could you?\nDePlume:\n............What? O-Oh. Well... I suppose not...\nPhoenix:\nMs. DePlume, did you actually witness the victim getting head-butted by the defendant?\nDePlume:\nAh, let's see... Oh, I remember now! As I recall, a rock in the shape of a skull was obstructing my view.\nJudge:\nSo are you admitting that you couldn't see the victim?\nDePlume:\nYes... Yes, I suppose I am. However! Immediately after the head-butting, the victim came floating up! He came up from behind the skull-shaped rock, and his body was all limp. What else could I think except that the killer whale was head-butting the victim?!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut if you didn't actually see the moment of attack itself, then it's pure conjecture!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\n*sigh* Must I do everything around here?\nDePlume:\nH-How dare you speak so rudely to me?!\nBlackquill:\nThere's no need for hysterics. Clear your mind and recall how you reached your conclusion. Though you couldn't see what the orca was attacking, you didn't need to, did you? Because you knew she was behaving exactly as she had only one year prior.\nDePlume:\nOh!\nPhoenix:\n(One year ago...?)\nDePlume:\nThat's right! Yes, that's it! That's how I knew the killer whale was head-butting the victim!\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, but could someone explain exactly what happened a year ago?\nBlackquill:\nIf you must know, a very similar incident occurred only last year, in which... ...the defendant murdered her trainer.\nJudge:\nWh-Whaaaaaaat?! The orca murdered her trainer, you say?!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! Is this really true?! (This is not looking good for us!)\nBlackquill:\nIt's all in this book.\nJudge:\nThat book... \"The Killer Killer Whale\"...! That's Ms. DePlume's latest work! I was just thinking of picking that up.\n\"The Killer Killer Whale\" added to the Court Record.\nBlackquill:\nLast year, the defendant killed her trainer in the middle of a show. The orca head-butted and bit the victim.\nPhoenix:\n(The same thing she's accused of in this case!)\nWoman:\nThat orca killed two people?!\nMan:\nThat thing is a menace! Guilty! Guilty, I say!\nMan:\nI never want to go to the beach again!\nAthena:\nNo! Now everyone's even more convinced that Orla did it!\nPhoenix:\n(We were doing so well, but now... Now everyone in the room has a bad impression of Orla. I don't want to think she did it... ...but it's hard to keep on believing in somebody who can't even tell me her side...)\nOrla:\nFwee, fweet?\nBuckler:\nPhoenix! Athena! You gotta believe in Orla! There's no way she killed anybody! You gotta save her! Please, I'm begging you!\nPhoenix:\nSasha... (What am I doing, doubting my client like this? This is the time to be strong!)\nAthena:\nI believe in Orla! And I'm ready to fight for our clients! I'll take everybody in this courtroom on if I have to!\nPhoenix:\nDon't you worry, Sasha. We won't give up on Orla. We'll defend her to the very end!\nBuckler:\nThank you! Thank you, both of you!\nOrla:\nFweet, fweet!\nPhoenix:\n(We are Orla's lawyers. Who else but us can save her?! We can't give up on her now!)\nBlackquill:\nHmph... For an instant there, you were afraid of the orca, weren't you, Wright-dono. When you saw the photograph of the victim from a year ago, you turned paler than me.\nPhoenix:\n! (He saw right through me!)\nBlackquill:\nIt's obvious you have neither the guts nor the determination to defend the orca.\nPhoenix:\nIt's true that Orla can't speak, and I don't know her thoughts... ...but there's a certain someone who believes in Orla with all her heart. I respect the trust she has in Orla, so I'm willing to believe in Orla, too.\nBlackquill:\nHmph. And what do you know about orcas? Nothing, that's what. So, allow me to fill you in. Do you have any idea why orcas are also called \"killer whales\"? Because they are cunning and merciless predators that hunt and kill even true whales.\nJudges:\nSo \"killer whales\" really are \"killers\"! What terrifying creatures indeed...\nBlackquill:\nI can't bear to hear any more of such rubbish as \"trusting a killer.\" Can you, Your Baldness?\nPhoenix:\nNo matter what you say, I will continue to believe. I don't give up that easily, you know.\nBlackquill:\n............Dullard. You don't know when to give up, do you? Very well. I shall give you a chance to prove just how determined you are. Witness, spare no quarter and lay the full truth on them.\nDePlume:\nOh ho ho! But of course! That is what I do, after all.\nJudge:\nProsecutor Blackquill, what will you have the witness testify about?\nBlackquill:\nI shall have her testify about what she saw, and what she heard.\nPhoenix:\nWhat she heard...?\nJudge:\nVery well. Ms. DePlume, please tell the court what you saw and what you heard.\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Saw and What I Heard --\nDePlume:\nThe killer whale's behavior was exactly the same as a year ago.\nAs I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing.\nI was calm when I saw it start to head-butt.\nBut when the pirate hat and victim came floating up, I let out a scream!\nJudge:\nHmm... So the orca displayed the same behavior as during the incident a year ago...\nDePlume:\nThat's right! Those weren't just simple cries. It was singing! As I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing! It kept head-butting while it sang the Swashbuckler Spectacular song! That's right. It was singing the same song it sang in the aquarium's stage show back then. It was singing while it was head-butting! Oh, it was perfectly horrible!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I don't see a single obvious inconsistency in this testimony. It's clear I won't be able to take her apart her statements with evidence alone.)\nAthena:\nMr. Wright! Now would be a good time for me to put my skills to work! It's time to show what analytical psychology can really do!\nPhoenix:\nYou seem pretty confident. Let me guess. You noticed a contradiction between the testimony and her emotions?\nAthena:\nYou bet I did! And once we expose it, we just might be able to crack her. No, scratch that. Make it, \"we'll definitely be able to\"!\nPhoenix:\nThen let's give your knowledge of analytical psychology a try!\nAthena:\nYou got it, Boss! A complete analysis of Ms. DePlume's heart, coming right up!\nDePlume:\nThe killer whale's behavior was exactly the same as a year ago.\nDePlume:\nAs I approached the pool...\nDePlume:\n...the killer whale suddenly started singing.\nDePlume:\nI was calm when I saw it start to head-butt.\nPinpoint Sad marker\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. DePlume, Orla really frightened you with her head-butting, didn't she?\"\nDePlume:\nBut when the pirate hat and victim came floating up, I let out a scream!\nAthena:\nDo you see any emotions that seem odd or out of place? Pay attention to not only which emotions you see, but how strong they are, too. An emotion might suddenly get stronger, for example, or you might see it grow weaker.\nPhoenix:\n(Okay. Let me listen to her testimony again.)\nPhoenix:\nMs. DePlume, Orla really frightened you with her head-butting, didn't she?\nDePlume:\nDon't be absurd! I certainly was NOT frightened by the likes of any killer whale!\nAthena:\nIt must've been something else that scared her, then, Boss.\nDePlume:\nHowever... I do remember being very afraid for some reason while it was doing that.\nAthena:\nIt sounds like maybe you saw something we haven't discussed yet. Take your time and try to remember what it was... What did you see?\nPhoenix:\n(This is practically turning into a counseling session.)\nDePlume:\n............ I... saw something...? ...Oh! Aaaaaaaaaaaagh! I-I remember now!\nNOISE LEVEL50%\nAthena:\nOkay, good! Now, if you could please tell the court what you saw!\nDePlume:\nI saw... I saw... I saw... bright red blood! The killer whale's ramming caused the victim to bleed. There was a great cloud of blood!\nPhoenix:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nDePlume:\nYes, that's it! That's why I was so sure! That's when I knew that killer whale had killed a person for a second time!\nJudge:\nWell! That was a very compelling statement indeed. Looking at this again, there does appear to be something that could be a cloud of blood.\nPhoenix:\n(So her terror was a reaction to blood, was it? That would certainly explain what happened yesterday...)\nPhoenix:\nPlease take a look at this bloodstained coin.\nDePlume:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeek! C-Cease and desist, at once! Wh-What kind of man shows a lady blood?\nPhoenix:\nUrk. (She doesn't have to get so worked up...)\nDePlume:\nI was badly injured during an interview once. Ever since then, I've been terrified of blood. The very sight of it dreadfully upsets my delicate sensibilities.\nPhoenix:\n(This is a bad turn... If Ms. DePlume saw blood... ...then does that mean Orla really did attack the victim...?)\nBlackquill:\nIt would appear that orcas are even more vicious than I am. So, how does it feel to be thoroughly rammed by your own cross-examination, Wright-dono?\nAthena:\nWh-What do we do now, Boss?!\nPhoenix:\nArgh... That testimony was not at all what I expected to hear...\nAthena:\nWait a minute... There's still some discord left in Ms. DePlume's heart.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? You mean there's more?\nAthena:\nYes, but there's no telling what it is. It could be something even more damaging...\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Is there even anything left of our case to damage...? Well, whatever it is, we have to face it head-on.) Athena, you believe in Orla, right? If so, there's no reason for us to shy away from the truth.\nAthena:\n...Yeah, you're right!\nPhoenix:\nI know we can handle the truth, whatever it is, so let's delve a little deeper!\nAthena:\nYou've got it, Boss!\nDePlume:\nThe killer whale's behavior was exactly the same as a year ago.\nDePlume:\nAs I approached the pool...\nDePlume:\n...the killer whale suddenly started singing.\nDePlume:\nAfter it started head-butting, I saw that awful blood and was terrified.\nDePlume:\nBut when the pirate hat and victim came floating up, I let out a scream!\nPinpoint Sad marker\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Huh? Her fear appears to lessen here at this statement.\"\nAthena:\nDo you see any emotions that seem odd or out of place? Pay attention to not only which emotions you see, but how strong they are, too. An emotion might suddenly get stronger, for example, or you might see it grow weaker.\nPhoenix:\n(Okay. Let me listen to her testimony again.)\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? Her fear appears to lessen here at this statement.) Ms. DePlume, weren't you afraid when you saw the victim with blood coming out of him?\nDePlume:\nMy, that's a very good question. I was shaken after witnessing a murder, yes, but then... the blood seemed to disappear...\nPhoenix:\nDisappear? And why do you suppose that was?\nDePlume:\nSimple! It was because of the pirate hat! After the killer whale put the hat on, the cloud of blood disappeared!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd how exactly does that work...?\nDePlume:\nHow should I know?! I'm just telling you what I remember, blue boy!\nPhoenix:\n(Wait a minute... From whom was this blood that Ms. DePlume saw actually coming from?)\nPresent Ora Shipley profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Consider this.\"\nPresent anyone else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMaybe somebody else was bleeding in the orca pool, somebody such as this!\nBlackquill:\nDo you see an injury anywhere on that individual?! And when exactly was this individual supposed to have entered the pool?!\nJudge:\nI don't think you're ready to play in the deep end just yet, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nI-I'll be right back with some floaties, Your Honor... (Hold on... \"Entered the pool\"...? What if this individual didn't \"enter\" the pool, but was already \"in\" the pool...? Who else was in the pool besides the victim?)\nLeads back to:\n\"From whom was this blood that Ms. DePlume saw actually coming from?\"\nPhoenix:\nConsider this. Maybe the one who was bleeding wasn't the victim.\nDePlume:\nI beg your pardon? What kind of ridiculous nonsense is that? There was no one else in that pool beside the victim!\nPhoenix:\nOh, I wouldn't say there was no one else. It IS an orca pool, after all.\nBlackquill:\nWhat?! Then where is this alleged injury on the defendant?!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure. But if simply wearing the pirate hat made the blood \"disappear\"... ...then the blood must've been coming from somewhere on Orla's head!\nDePlume:\nWh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nBlackquill:\nThe orca's head? What are you prattling on about now?!\nAthena:\nPlease think about it again, Ms. DePlume! Think back to what you really saw!\nDePlume:\nErrr... I... That is... Th-The one who was bleeding was not the victim, but the killer whale...? Ngh... I remember now! There wasn't any blood coming from the victim after all!\nNOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE\nAthena:\nWe did it! Analytical psychology got us what we needed from her!\nPhoenix:\nThat was a huge help, Athena. (It was also pretty dicey for a while, though.)\nJudge:\nWell! This is a surprise! The blood the witness saw was the defendant's, not the victim's!\nPhoenix:\nThat is correct. And since there was no blood coming from the victim... ...there's only one thing we can conclude. That what Ms. DePlume witnessed was not the \"moment of the murder,\" as she claims!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nI thought you were unarmed, but it turns out you were concealing a sword all along. Nevertheless... it is far too dull to cut to the bone.\nPhoenix:\nMeaning...?\nBlackquill:\nI grant that what the witness saw was not the victim's blood, but it proves nothing. After all, being rammed doesn't always result in a wound that bleeds, does it? Death from internal hemorrhaging is also a possibility.\nPhoenix:\n...! (He has a point there.)\nBlackquill:\nIf you wish to challenge me to a duel, you'll need a sharper blade than that, Wright-dono. I demand evidence that proves the witness did not see the moment of the murder!\nPhoenix:\nAck! (There must be something. Think, Phoenix! If I'm correct, then the victim's death occurred...)\nBefore DePlume saw it\nLeads to:\n\"If the victim was already dead when Orla started her head-butting...\"\nAfter DePlume saw it\nPhoenix:\n(If the victim was alive when Orla started her head-butting... ...then that would basically make Orla the one who killed him. But since I don't think she did it, then we must be wrong about when it took place.)\nLeads to:\n\"If the victim was already dead when Orla started her head-butting...\"\nPhoenix:\n(If the victim was already dead when Orla started her head-butting... ...then that would mean he died sometime before Ms. DePlume was watching her. The events Ms. DePlume witnessed took place at around 10:10 AM. I must have something that can tell us about what happened before 10:10 AM!)\nPresent Security Footage\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"We've only seen the footage from 10:09 to 10:10 AM.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis is the evidence that proves Ms. DePlume did not see the moment of the murder!\nAthena:\nHuh? I'm not sure that's really related to what Ms. DePlume did or didn't witness.\nPhoenix:\n............But you're not sure, right...?\nBlackquill:\nNo, we can be quite sure it's unrelated.\nJudge:\nYes, quite.\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch. I guess we can be...)\nLeads back to:\n\"The events Ms. DePlume witnessed took place at around 10:10 AM.\"\nPhoenix:\n(We've only seen the footage from 10:09 to 10:10 AM. Which means... there's still footage going further back that we need to check!) Your Honor, I request that ALL of the security footage be played for the court.\nJudge:\nAll of the footage?\nPhoenix:\nMs. DePlume witnessed the cloud of blood at around 10:10 AM. But I believe the victim was already dead by that time.\nJudge:\nSo your assertion is that the murder took place before Ms. DePlume arrived?\nPhoenix:\nExactly. The security camera footage starts at 10:00 AM when the aquarium opened. And I believe there is vital evidence in the ten minutes before!\nBlackquill:\nHmph............ You are quite the gambling man, Wright-dono. Are you honestly willing to risk everything on those mere ten minutes?\nPhoenix:\n(I've bet on slimmer chances before, but when he puts it that way...)\nAthena:\nAthena:\nMy boss is no coward, Prosecutor Blackquill, so I suggest you get ready to eat humble pie!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh. I can't back down now...)\nJudge:\nWell, if the defense is that confident in its importance... Prosecutor Blackquill, the security footage.\nBlackquill:\n............Fool Bright.\nFulbright:\nRoger! I have the rest of the security footage right here!\nJudge:\nVery well. Please play it for the court.\nPhoenix:\n(Please, PLEASE have something for me!)\nFulbright:\nThis is what it looked like at 10:10 AM. The witness can be seen here. All right. I'll just back the footage up to the beginning now!\nJudge:\nHmm... It appears Ms. DePlume hasn't arrived yet at this point.\nPhoenix:\n(Now to see if I can find something from before this point in time!)\nJudge:\n............\nBlackquill:\n............\nPhoenix:\n............ Is that it?\nFulbright:\nYep! That's all the footage there is!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Did you see what you were looking for?\nAthena:\nW-We got nothin'...\nBlackquill:\nHmph............ Well, Wright-dono? Those were the ten minutes you placed your bet on. Did you see anything of significance?\nPhoenix:\n(...Did I see anything important? I'd better think about this carefully...) In the footage, we see...!\nSomething important\nPhoenix:\nThis is the important thing the footage shows!\nPresent anywhere\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nHmm? And what is so vital about that point, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nDifferent things are important to different people. \"Importance\" is a subjective thing!\nJudge:\nYes, just as my decision to assign a penalty is a \"subjective thing.\"\nPhoenix:\nUrk. (Wait a minute... What if something that SHOULD be in the footage isn't there...?) P-Please wait, Your Honor! Um... That footage...\nLeads back to:\n\"In the footage, we see...!\"\nNothing important\nLeads to:\n\"We can see nothing of importance in that footage.\"\nPhoenix:\nWe can see nothing of importance in that footage.\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Just as I thought.\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! You're right about that! That section was completely meaningless! It doesn't show a thing. That's why I didn't submit it as evidence!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nNo. It's just the opposite.\nFulbright:\nHuh? What do you mean by that?\nPhoenix:\nIn this ten minutes of footage, something important that SHOULD be there isn't there! Detective Fulbright, this footage should have been submitted as evidence.\nFulbright:\nWhat? Are you questioning the way I carry out my duty to justice?!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Explain yourself, please! What is this important thing that you say should be in the footage, but isn't?\nPresent Photo of the Body\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The important thing we should see in the footage is the victim himself, Jack Shipley.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nBlackquill:\nAnd what is the problem you perceive if that particular object isn't in the footage?\nPhoenix:\nThere is no problem, which is exactly why it is a problem, right?!\nJudge:\nWhile I admire your enthusiasm, please don't think you can wing it on enthusiasm alone. I would further like to suggest that your attitude is a problem, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n...My apologies, Your Honor. (If the victim was alive, there's something we should see in the footage...) I still content that there is something important that is not in this footage.\nJudge:\nIf that is your contention, please back it up with evidence.\nLeads back to:\n\"What is this important thing that you say should be in the footage, but isn't?\"\nPhoenix:\nThe important thing we should see in the footage is the victim himself, Jack Shipley. I don't know about you, but I didn't see him get in the pool in that footage.\nJudge:\nOh!\nBlackquill:\n............!\nFulbright:\nAaaaagh! That's right!\nPhoenix:\nIf the victim is not shown entering the pool in this footage... ...it means that he must have been there by the skull rock during those ten minutes. But no human being can hold their breath underwater for that long.\nFulbright:\nW-Wait a minute... Are you saying...?!\nPhoenix:\nWhen the security camera started up at 10 AM, the victim was already dead!\nFulbright:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court! If that's the case, then when was the victim murdered?!\nPhoenix:\nI don't know, Your Honor, but we now know it had to have been sometime before 10 AM. Therefore, this footage can no longer be called decisive evidence against my client!\nBlackquill:\nHmph. But there is no one else who could have killed the victim.\nPhoenix:\nNot necessarily. The defense believes that the true culprit may have been human. And we have evidence to back up our theory as well!\nBlackquill:\nDo you, now? I would be very interested in seeing this evidence.\nPhoenix:\n(The defense's trump card -- that thing we found during our investigation yesterday... I wouldn't go so far as to call it \"decisive,\" but... ...now's the time to play it!)\nJudge:\nVery well, Mr. Wright. Please submit your evidence. What evidence shows that the crime may have been committed by a human?\nPresent Bloodstained Coin\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"What's this? A coin...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nAnd that substantiates your claim how...?\nAthena:\nWhat are you doing?! That's not the right piece at all, Boss!\nPhoenix:\n...That's what I was just thinking myself, judging by the judge's expression...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! You will refrain from presenting evidence you're not sure about just to feel me out!\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... I must still be rusty, but this time, I'll present our real trump card!)\nJudge:\nLet's try again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"What evidence shows that the crime may have been committed by a human?\"\nJudge:\nWhat's this? A coin...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, a fake coin used in the aquarium's pirate show. We found it beside the pool. This coin is quite possibly the real murder weapon.\nJudge:\nThis tiny little coin... is the murder weapon? Mr. Wright! If this is another one of your bluffs...!\nBlackquill:\nHmph. As they say, the bolder the presentation, the less confident the solicitor.\nPhoenix:\nThis is no bluff, and this isn't the only coin. There are three hundred of these coins in all, weighing a total of about seven pounds. (Changed from [There are 300 of these coins all together, weighing a total of about seven pounds.] in the original release) This one just happens to have blood on it.\nBlackquill:\n...Did you have the blood analyzed to see whose it is?\nPhoenix:\nNot yet... ...but there were coins scattered all around the body, and the victim had a head wound. Taking these things into account, I believe it has to be the victim's blood. So, to put it together, we have about seven pounds of coins by the side of the pool... ...one of them with a bloodstain on it. I think the answer is pretty clear here. Your Honor! The defense proposes that the victim was killed beside the pool!\nJudge:\nThe side of the pool?! But if the murder took place there, it would be difficult to say the orca did it...\nDePlume:\nI realize you are trying to defend your client, but that theory is preposterous! How could three hundred coins possibly be made to hit someone all at once?! (Changed from [How could 300 coins possibly be made to hit someone all at once?!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nIt'd be pretty easy if they were in a bag or something of that nature.\nJudge:\nAnd so where is this bag the coins were in?\nPhoenix:\nUnfortunately, Your Honor, we recovered nothing of the sort from the scene. It's possible the culprit took it with them.\nJudge:\nThey took it...?\nPhoenix:\nThe true culprit used the coins as a blunt instrument to commit murder. They then threw the body into the pool before the security cameras started up. And then they left, taking the bag the coins were in with them. They got rid of the evidence that points to a human culprit to pin the blame on Orla!\nAthena:\nThat was brilliant, Mr. Wright! You found a way to introduce the possibility of a human perpetrator!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, somehow... (Let's hope my luck holds out... Hmm... I wonder why Prosecutor Blackquill hasn't said anything...)\nJudge:\nThe possibility of a perpetrator other than the defendant has now been suggested. But if we hold this possibility to be true, then what did Ms. DePlume witness?\nDePlume:\nTh-That's right! I saw the killer whale attack the victim! Just like it did a year ago, singing a song!\nAthena:\nHmm... I guess there still is that... Even with somebody else as the culprit, Orla's behavior still seems pretty bizarre. (Chhanged from [Even with somebody else as the culprit, Orla's behavior still seem [sic] pretty bizarre.] in the original release) I wonder why she was doing the same things she did a year ago? (Changed from [I wonder why did she [sic] was doing the same things she did a year ago?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nBut is it REALLY that bizarre...? (Changed from [But are they REALLY that bizarre...?] in the original release)\nAthena:\nWhat do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nTo explain the inexplicable, all we have to do is turn our thinking around.\nAthena:\nTurn our thinking around, huh? Sounds good to me!\nPhoenix:\n(Time to give the ol' \"turn my thinking around\" method a try! Instead of trying to figure out WHY Orla did the same things she did a year ago... ...I should consider the results that were produced by her behavior this time around. Orla sang a song, did some head-butts, and bit the victim. If the real culprit wanted to shift the suspicion onto Orla... ...then they would've needed to give people a reason to think Orla did it in the first place!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, as her lawyer, how do you explain your client's actions?\nPhoenix:\nI believe we should think of it in this way, Your Honor: What kind of effect did Orla's actions have on the case?\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Then why don't you explain it for the court. How did the defendant's actions affect the case?\nThey created a witness\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. DePlume focused her attention on the orca pool because she heard the song.\"\nThey killed the victim\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant's actions may have killed the victim.\nJudge:\nSo your assertion is that... the defendant is guilty...?\nPhoenix:\nOh! What?! No...! I retract my statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nYou may retract your statement, but you will first contract a penalty.\nPhoenix:\n(Instead of trying to figure out WHY Orla did the same things she did a year ago... ...I should consider what the result was of her doing the same things as a year ago. That's what I have to focus on now!) Your Honor! Please let me try again!\nJudge:\nVery well. Please explain to the court...\nLeads back to:\n\"How did the defendant's actions affect the case?\"\nThey got rid of evidence\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant's actions may have gotten rid of evidence!\nJudge:\nHmm... And what evidence might that be, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nVital evidence that would prove who the true culprit is! ...At least, that is what I hope.\nJudge:\n...I am not asking about your hopes and dreams, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Instead of trying to figure out WHY Orla did the same things she did a year ago... ...I should consider what the result was of her doing the same things as a year ago. That's what I have to focus on now!) Your Honor! Please let me try again!\nJudge:\nVery well. Please explain to the court...\nLeads back to:\n\"How did the defendant's actions affect the case?\"\nPhoenix:\nMs. DePlume focused her attention on the orca pool because she heard the song. The orca's act of singing a song created a witness.\nJudge:\nCreated a witness...?\nPhoenix:\nIsn't it possible... ...that fabricating a witness was the real culprit's true intention? After all, Ms. DePlume witnessed two things: She saw Orla head-butt something over and over, and she saw the orca bite the victim. Those two actions of Orla's might have been... ...the true culprit's plot to make the witness think the orca was attacking the victim!\nJudge:\nAre you saying... that the defendant was being manipulated by the true perpetrator?!\nPhoenix:\nExactly. And that would explain Orla's actions perfectly.\nJudge:\nBut the defendant is an orca. Is it even possible to manipulate her?\nPhoenix:\nYes, there is a way to manipulate Orla's behavior, with this!\nPresent Whistle\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Is this... a whistle?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nTHAT can be used to manipulate Orla's behavior?\nPhoenix:\n...Sure, maybe it could be, if one knew how!\nJudge:\nI wish someone would manipulate YOU into presenting relevant evidence, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nM-My apologies, Your Honor... (Hmm... I know I have something that can be used to control Orla's behavior...)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Wright, is it really possible to manipulate Orla's behavior?\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, there is a way to manipulate Orla's behavior, with this!\"\nJudge:\nIs this... a whistle?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. Trainers at the aquarium use whistles to issues commands to Orla. But in truth, anyone can do it, provided they know the right signals.\nJudge:\nAh, that must be how they get Orla to do tricks for their pirate shows.\nPhoenix:\nThe true culprit hid the body in a spot that couldn't be seen from the visitor's corridor. Then, when Ms. DePlume appeared, they gave Orla the commands! In other words, Orla was manipulated by the culprit to perform a series of \"tricks\"!\nDePlume:\nWh-Whaaat...?\nPhoenix:\nAnd, as for you, Ms. DePlume... ...you were manipulated by the true culprit to play the part of the witness!\nDePlume:\nI-I, Norma DePlume, was set up...?! I, Norma DePlume, writer extraordinaire, was used...? N-No... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nM-Ms. DePlume...! Please do something about your attire!\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... That was one wardrobe malfunction I did NOT want to see...)\nJudge:\nI-It would appear we need to shift our suspicion toward someone other than Orla. Prosecutor Blackquill, please have the bloodstained coin analyzed.\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. You waste your breath.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess even Prosecutor Blackquill can't refute the possibility of a human suspect.)\nAthena:\nYou did it, Boss! If the crime happened beside the pool, there's no way an orca could have done it!\nPhoenix:\nNow, if only we could find the bag the coins were in...\nJudge:\nHmm... In light of the new discovery, it would appear that the orca couldn't have done it.\nPhoenix:\nExactly, Your Honor. If the blood on the coin proves to be that of the victim... ...we can unequivocally overturn Orla's accusation.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nOverturn the defendant's accusation...? Hmph. I think not.\nPhoenix:\nACK! (M-My hair! My beautiful hair!)\nBlackquill:\nYesterday, a new inmate was brought into the prison. He said, \"The moment you relax is when you're most vulnerable.\"\nJudge:\nHmm... And what did this man go in for?\nBlackquill:\n...He is merely a sneaky thief who enjoys a spot of fishing now and again. But Wright-dono here would be easier to hook than any fish...\nTaka:\nScreech!\nPhoenix:\n(That hawk sure does love the judge's head.)\nJudge:\nWhat's this? That coin from before and... some sort of bag?\nPhoenix:\nA b-bag...? (I don't think I'm gonna like this...)\nBlackquill:\nThis is the coin bag the three hundred coins were in. (Changed from [This is the coin bag the 300 coins were in.] in the original release) I believe you were looking for this?\nPhoenix:\nH-How did you get that?!\nBlackquill:\nI never said we didn't find it at the crime scene. The bag had blood on it, so naturally, I had it sent to the crime lab.\nPhoenix:\nAnd... does the blood belong to the victim?\nBlackquill:\nIt does indeed, as does the blood on the coin.\nPhoenix:\n(I knew it! So the blood on the coin DID belong to the victim!)\nBlackquill:\nThe bag was open and the coins had all spilled out. But the bag alone wasn't proof enough to say that it was used as the murder weapon. ...However, thanks to the defense and their coin, I am more than satisfied that it was.\nJudge:\nProsecutor Blackquill! Are you conceding that the true culprit committed the murder with the bag of coins?\nBlackquill:\nI shall concede that the victim was put into the pool after his death. However, even with the bag... ...it doesn't change the fact it was the orca that killed the victim!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! How can you still suspect Orla?!\nBlackquill:\nYou said that the true culprit manipulated Orla's behavior. But Orla isn't the kind of orca that would let someone control her. If anything, Orla used the victim's behavior against him to murder him!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! But--\nJudge:\nA-Are you arguing that the orca manipulated a human being?!\nBlackquill:\nHmph... To prove it, I have summoned another witness. Marlon Rimes, take the stand!\nPhoenix:\n(M-Marlon Rimes?! Is a witness...?!)\nBlackquill:\n...Well, don't just stand there. State your name.\nRimes:\n............I told ya I didn't wanna be a witness.\nBlackquill:\nI thought one witness would be quite enough to prove the defendant's guilt... ...but apparently Wright-dono won't be satisfied until every stone is turned.\nRimes:\nWell, son of a... All right, fine! If I gotta talk, then let's get this over with!\nAthena:\nMr. Rimes doesn't seem like a willing witness.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what Prosecutor Blackquill is going to have him testify about?)\nJudge:\nUm... So could we have your name and occupation for the record, witness?\nRimes:\n............ Ahoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! People of da law! Time to testify! Chillin' with my crew at the Shipshape. Orcas, penguins, and da seascape. Cleanin' n' feedin', there ain't no end. But dem bratty kid's tours, I shall transcend. Noob animal keeper, from the house of Rimes! I'm da master keeper, Marlon with the rhymes!\nJudge:\nOh, my... I'm afraid I couldn't understand a word you said! Is that that \"flip-flop\" music young people nowadays like?\nPhoenix:\n(...So close, Your Honor, so close... and yet so far.)\nJudge:\nPlease proceed with your testimony, witness. Without the flip-flop.\nRimes:\nOkay, fine. But I don't wanna do this, I tell ya. I feel like I'm sellin' Sasha out.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Man-Manipulating Orca --\nRimes:\nAt about 10:10 AM, I was in the staff room.\nI heard a loud noise from the pool room, so I went to the door to look in.\nI couldn't see the captain or the orca, but I saw a bunch of coins scattered around.\nThe orca knows there's a certain spot people stand to play volleyball with her.\nI think maybe she knocked down the stuff that was piled up there and hit the captain.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... So that gives us a little more info about the area around the orca pool.)\nOrca Pool Diagram updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant made the stuff fall down...?\nBlackquill:\nOverturned crates and assorted props were scattered all over the pool room floor. There is no doubt that it was the orca that caused the mess.\nJudge:\nBut could she really have done that from within the pool?\nBlackquill:\nHmph. As I said, the orca is the only one that could've performed such a feat. (Changed from [Hmph. As I said, the orca is the only one that could've perform [sic] such a feat.] in the original release) The pool and its room were tidied the night before, including its various odds and ends. But when our rhyming marlin took a look-see, over four hundred pounds of props had fallen. (Changed from [But when our rhyming marlin checked on the scene, over 400 pounds of props had fallen.] in the original release) To move it all in one go would challenge even the brawny prisoner in the cell next to mine.\nPhoenix:\n(...What is he? The jail gossip?)\nBlackquill:\nSo, how did 400 pounds of items fall all at once? I'll tell you how. The orca pulled on the cloth that was underneath them. A weight that would be all but impossible for a human to move... ...was child's play to an orca. During a friendly game of volleyball, the defendant made the crates fall... ...and the bag of coins that was among the items fell on the victim's head and killed him! The orca then toyed with the victim's body underwater, which is what Ms. DePlume saw.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut the witness only said he \"heard a loud noise.\" That doesn't automatically make it the sound of Orla making the items fall! Also, why did you only \"look in\" on the pool room, anyway, Mr. Rimes?\nRimes:\nThat orca sometimes makes a loud noise to summon her trainer. But I'm still a newbie, so I don't have a security card to get into the pool room yet. So even if she tries to summon somebody, there isn't much I can do about it.\nJudge:\nI see. So the witness couldn't enter the crime scene...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIf Mr. Rimes couldn't enter the room, there's at least one thing he can't be sure about! His statement that the orca was playing volleyball is purely speculation!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nWhether the orca was actually playing volleyball or not is not the issue. Traces of the orca's saliva were found on the cloth that was underneath the crates. The important point is that the orca is the only one that could have moved the items!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! I have to discredit that statement somehow! If I don't, it'd mean that Orla was the culprit, even if the victim died beside the pool!)\nCross Examination\n-- The Man-Manipulating Orca --\nRimes:\nAt about 10:10 AM, I was in the staff room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about the time you were in the staff room?\nRimes:\nWhat?! Y-Yes, I'm sure! I'm pretty good with time. I've never been late to work once.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... If he's sure about the time, then there's something wrong with that statement. I'd better take another look through the Court Record...)\nJudge:\nAll right. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Rimes.\nPresent Calendar\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"You say you were in the staff room...\"\nRimes:\nI heard a loud noise from the pool room, so I went to the door to look in.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou heard the noise all the way in the staff room?\nRimes:\nThat's right. The orca pool room and the staff room are pretty close to each other. Anyway, I heard the noise, so I went to the door of the pool room. But I don't have a security card, so all I could do was look through the door crack.\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of noise did you hear?\nRimes:\nWant me to describe it? Awww yiiiiis! Yo word up Courtroom Numbah Fouuuuurrr! Da crash, boom, bowing to relativity! Everything fallin' with sweet simplicity! This testimony yo, it ain't got no fallacies! Things fallin' n' breakin', was pure insanity! ...Kinda like that.\nPhoenix:\n(Okay... But why the need to rap it...?)\nJudge:\nWell, I didn't really get all of that, but, in any case, I gather it was a very loud noise... Very well. Please describe what you saw at the scene.\nRimes:\nI couldn't see the captain or the orca, but I saw a bunch of coins scattered around.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou couldn't see the victim?\nRimes:\nI was just lookin' through the door crack. I guess all that stuff was blockin' my view. I did notice a whole bunch of coins scattered all over the place, though... But, at the time, I had no idea the captain was dead.\nBlackquill:\nHmph... Killed by gold coins. Ironic, isn't it? Perhaps the orca wanted to be paid for her labor, paid in coins raining from the skies.\nAthena:\nCoins raining from the skies? He makes it sound... almost poetic.\nPhoenix:\nBut the hard truth is that those coins were actually the murder weapon...\nBlackquill:\nWe all deserve to be paid for our work, do we not? I shall have a fine meal tonight...\nPhoenix:\nIf you find our client guilty, that is. Mr. Rimes, do you have a theory on how the things got knocked down?\nRimes:\nOf course I do.\nRimes:\nThe orca knows there's a certain spot people stand to play volleyball with her.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nShe uses this ball and does a spike, right? We had a nice little demonstration of Orla's spike for ourselves just yesterday.\nRimes:\nIf you stand on the mark on the floor, the orca spikes the ball at you.\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Taka is good at flying straight at his target as well. And I see plenty of targets right here in this room.\nJudge:\n?\nPhoenix:\n?\nRimes:\n?\nAthena:\nEveryone's so busy protecting their head, they forgot about the trial...\nPhoenix:\nIncluding you.\nBlackquill:\nTell them what the defendant caused to happen.\nRimes:\nWell, the orca knows people stand in a certain spot for volleyball...\nRimes:\nI think maybe she knocked down the stuff that was piled up there and hit the captain.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you saying you think she knocked down the items on purpose?\nRimes:\nI don't wanna believe it, myself, but that orca's pretty smart... It'd be easy for her to pull the cloth the stuff was on while she was playin' volleyball. Orcas are really strong. One good pull and all those things would come crashin' down.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess maybe an orca could be strong enough to make that much stuff fall...)\nBlackquill:\nI've never seen an orca play tug of war, myself. But the fact is, this one did. The traces of the orca's saliva found on the cloth prove it. How long do you plan to walk tightrope on those shaky theories of yours?\nPhoenix:\n(Wait until you see me do acrobatics! Moments like these are what I became a lawyer again for!)\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know why, but Mr. Rimes is lying. I'm afraid I have to expose that secret he and Pearls were keeping to resolve this...)\nPhoenix:\nYou say you were in the staff room, but is that really true?\nRimes:\nOf course it's true. Why would I lie about a thing like that?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Rimes, have you ever seen this calendar before?\nRimes:\nHey! That's...!\nPhoenix:\nI see you recognize it.\nRimes:\nYeah, that's the Rifle calendar. It's a big hit at the Shipshape Aquarium gift shop. Thank you for shoppin' at Shipshape!\nJudge:\nMr. Rimes! Please refrain from scattering fish around the witness stand!\nBlackquill:\n...Not to worry, Your Baldness. Taka will have them cleaned up in no time.\nTaka:\nScreech!\nPhoenix:\n(...I guess that bird comes in handy now and then.)\nJudge:\nAll right, Mr. Wright. We have all seen your cute souvenir. Now, if you wouldn't mind...\nPhoenix:\nUh, no, Your Honor! This isn't my calendar. It was originally the witness's, but it came into the possession of a certain young lady.\nRimes:\nWh-What?!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Rimes and this young lady first met each other in the food prep room. After a mishap, their calendars got switched around. They ran into each other at about 10:10 AM in the food prep room. So clearly, the witness was not in the staff room. In other words, there's no way he could have heard the noise in the pool room upstairs!\nRimes:\nArrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!\nBlackquill:\nWhat's this?! This is the first I'm hearing about any calendar!\nPhoenix:\n(That's because Mr. Rimes and Pearls were keeping it a secret.)\nBlackquill:\nYou lied to ME?! This transgression will not go unpunished!\nRimes:\nArrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Rimes, you didn't hear the noise of the equipment falling after all, did you?\nRimes:\n...Okay. I admit it. I didn't hear the noise in the orca pool room, myself. But somebody told me about it.\nPhoenix:\nWho told you about it?\nRimes:\n............It was... uh...\nPhoenix:\nUnless you tell the truth, Mr. Rimes, I can't save Orla. And I'm sure you know how sad that would make Ms. Buckler.\nRimes:\n............ ............I heard about it... from Sasha.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! From Ms. Buckler?!\nAthena:\nB-But that doesn't make sense!\nPhoenix:\n(What is going on here?)\nBlackquill:\nHmph... Now it's the trainer's own words that drive the orca into a corner. How do you like being bitten by your own client, Wright-dono?!\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh! I certainly didn't see this coming!)\nBlackquill:\nWhat perfect timing. There was something I wanted to ask Ms. Buckler about the orca. The prosecution calls the trainer, Ms. Sasha Buckler, to the stand!\nJudge:\nYes, I suppose it would be a good idea to hear what the orca's trainer has to say.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know what Sasha is going to say... ...but I'll just have to meet it head-on, whatever it is!)\nJudge:\nWe will take a twenty minute recess while the witness is summoned.\nTo be continued\nJuly 21, 10:39 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3\nAthena:\nMr. Wright... are you going to cross-examine Sasha?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll have to ask her about the noise from the stuff falling down.\nRimes:\nMr. Wright...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Rimes, why did you lie?\nRimes:\nI... I didn't want Sasha to have to appear in court. I thought if anybody had to testify, I should be the one to do it for her.\nAthena:\nBut why would you go to all those lengths...?\nRimes:\n............ Did you see the entry for the twentieth on that calendar?\nPhoenix:\nThe note about meeting the captain at the orca pool?\nRimes:\nYeah. I found that calendar in the nap room. I think it's probably Sasha's.\nAthena:\nWhat?! Then that means...!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it does look like more of a woman's calendar than a man's...)\nCalendar updated in the Court Record.\nRimes:\nI didn't want suspicion to fall on Sasha... Mr. Wright... I gotta go back to the aquarium to look after the orca in Sasha's place. I'll be rootin' for ya on the other end of that TV phone. Please take care of Sasha...\nAthena:\nOkay! We can't let Prosecutor Blackquill get the best of us! Time to refocus!\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. After all, we're the only ones who can save Orla.\nJuly 21, 11:02 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nThe court will now reconvene. Prosecutor Blackquill, please call the witness to the stand.\nBlackquill:\n............Again, you waste your breath.\nBuckler:\nMe name be Sasha! And I be one of Cap'n Orla's Swashbucklers! I come to rescue me bucko from the false charges put on her by Dread Pirate Nostache!\nBlackquill:\n............\"Nostache\"...?\nAthena:\nI guess \"Nostache\" refers to Prosecutor Blackquill this time.\nPhoenix:\n...Well, it can't be the judge. He HAS a mustache... and a full beard.\nBuckler:\nNow then, Cap'n Judge... shall we begin the pirate court?!\nJudge:\n\"C-Cap'n Judge\"...! Hmm... I rather like that. It makes me feel like a salty old sea dog.\nBuckler:\nAnd scene! How was that for a self-intro?\nBlackquill:\n............The court is not a show. State your full name and occupation.\nBuckler:\nI'm Sasha Buckler. I work at Shipshape Aquarium. I perform in our Swashbuckler Spectacular pirate show alongside Orla, as her trainer.\nJudge:\nWell! You seem like a completely different person now.\nBuckler:\nYou r-EEL-y think so? Thanks! I was in my pirate show persona just then! Prosecutor Blackquill said I could introduce myself any way I like.\nPhoenix:\n(I'd bet money he didn't think you were going to do it like THAT...)\nJudge:\nAnd what will this witness testify about?\nBlackquill:\nThe orca manipulated the victim into playing volleyball and then knocked the items down. The witness will report about hearing the noise that caused the victim's death.\nBuckler:\nNow wait just a minute! Sure, Orla uses the ball to break props sometimes... She even spiked the ball at the giant octopus's leg yesterday when I was cleaning.\nPhoenix:\n(...So Orla was the one who broke that leg, huh?)\nBuckler:\nBut she couldn't have knocked down that huge stack of equipment with her little ball!\nBlackquill:\nHmph. I thought you were paying attention to the trial over the telecast... ...but you apparently know nothing of what we have been discussing. The orca knocked down the equipment by pulling on the cloth that was underneath it. No one said anything about the orca knocking it down with a ball!\nBuckler:\nWhaaaaaat?! I-Is THAT what we're talking about?! Ngh... I came in here to give Prosecutor Nostache a good keelhauling... ...but I'm the one getting the cat-o'-nine-tails! Ooh, he's as vicious as a tiger shark!\nAthena:\nMs. Buckler! Just focus on your testimony and you'll be all right! Don't worry. We'll take care of that tiger shark for you!\nBuckler:\nThank you, Athena! Okay, I can do this! My testimony will be fin-omenal!\nJudge:\nAll right, Ms. Buckler. Please proceed with your testimony.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Hearing the Noise --\nBuckler:\nI admit I heard Orla summoning me with a loud noise.\nBut the aquarium guest's scream I heard over the walkie-talkie was more urgent.\nI talked to Norma DePlume first and then went to the pool room with the security guard.\nThe equipment was everywhere, and... the captain was lying in the middle of it all.\nJudge:\nHmm... Her story doesn't seem to be much different from Marlon Rimes's testimony.\nPhoenix:\nOr does it...? The circumstances are different. The actual order of Orla's actions depend on the order the witness heard the two noises. If she heard the scream first, the prosecution's claims don't stand up!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Unfortunately for you, she doesn't remember the order of what she heard.\nPhoenix:\n............Sh-She doesn't...?\nBuckler:\nI was distracted at the time... so I don't really recall which one I heard first... I was lost in thought until the guard brought me back to myself... Sorry I'm no help.\nBlackquill:\nAs long as the order remains unclear, I shall not alter the prosecution's claims. After killing the victim with the bag of coins, the orca toyed with the body in the water.\nPhoenix:\n(I have to turn things around here somehow! Unless I can prove the sound Sasha heard was NOT the sound of the victim's murder... ...Blackquill's claim that Orla pulled down the equipment to kill the victim will stand. If I want to save Orla, I have to find a contradiction, no matter how small!)\nJudge:\nVery well. Your cross-examination, please, Mr. Wright.\nCross Examination\n-- Hearing the Noise --\nBuckler:\nI admit I heard Orla summoning me with a loud noise.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat made you think Orla was summoning you?\nBuckler:\nOrla knows the sound of her cries doesn't carry far enough. So sometimes she summons people by making a loud noise. Heh heh. That Orla is smarter than the average whale, I tell you!\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Taka would not be bested in a battle of wits.\nAthena:\nAthena:\nWait a minute! Widget is the smartest one of all!\nWidget:\nMirror, mirror, on the wall. Who's the smartest one of all? Widget!\nPhoenix:\n(Am I expected to enter Trucy into this \"my kid is better than yours\"-apalooza...?) And did you heed the summons of this very intelligent Orla immediately?\nBuckler:\nI couldn't right away, although I was concerned about her, of course.\nBuckler:\nBut the aquarium guest's scream I heard over the walkie-talkie was more urgent.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou heard Ms. DePlume scream?\nBuckler:\nThat's right. I heard her through the walkie-talkie of a guard making his rounds. \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!\" I can still hear it in my head. It was so loud, I thought it was a sea lion.\nPhoenix:\nMs. DePlume sort of reminds me of a sea lion, actually.\nAthena:\nI know, right? Ooh, I should call her \"sea lion lady\" and see how she likes it!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess Athena is still upset about being called \"yellow girl.\")\nJudge:\nWhat did you do after hearing the visitor's scream?\nBuckler:\nI talked to Norma DePlume first and then went to the pool room with the security guard.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou and the security guard headed to the orca pool room?\nBuckler:\nYeah. Apparently, that obnoxious writer lady said she didn't trust me by myself. That's why, after talking to her, the guard and I went to the pool room together. Why the wench be so suspicious?! Arrrrr! I demand a swordfish duel! That's what I felt like saying to her, anyway.\nJudge:\n............I'm afraid I don't get it.\nAthena:\nThat was a line from the show when Orla and Sasha quarrel with each other! Didn't you do your Swashbuckler Spectacular homework, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWhy am I getting scolded, Mr. Wright?!\nPhoenix:\nAnd why am I getting scolded here, Your Honor...? Ms. Buckler, please tell me what happened after you headed to the pool room.\nBuckler:\nAll right. When the guard and I got there, we saw that...\nBuckler:\nThe equipment was everywhere, and... the captain was lying in the middle of it all.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you recall about the scene exactly?\nBuckler:\nI don't remember much, to be honest... I was in total shock from seeing the captain like that. If you ask me something specific, I might be able to remember, though.\nPhoenix:\n(Specific questions, huh? Okay, let's see. What should I ask her about?)\nThe things scattered around\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me more about the things that were scattered around?\nBuckler:\nThey were equipment and props for the new show.\nPhoenix:\nThe new show?\nBuckler:\nYeah. We were supposed to debut a brand-new Swashbuckler Spectacular yesterday. We already defeated the giant octopus and Nostache, after all. We were going to have a new nemesis, Redstache. He's on the flyer.\nAthena:\nOh! That's the flyer Rifle was distributing! \"Who will obtain the gold coins hidden in the skull rock?!\" Ooh, I wish it could be me!\nBuckler:\nLeave it to you, Athena, to know all about it! Orla's even got some new tricks for the new show.\nSwashbuckler Flyer updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nSo all the stuff that fell down was for the new show, is that it?\nBuckler:\nThat's right. A bunch of props in crates and other equipment, stacked up.\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, for the record, I'd like that information added to the witness's testimony.\nJudge:\nVery well. Ms. Buckler, please append what you just said to your testimony.\nBuckler:\nSure thing!\nChanges statement from \"The equipment was everywhere, and... the captain was lying in the middle of it all.\" to \"The props for the new show were everywhere, and... the captain was in the middle of it all.\"\nJack Shipley\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me more about the state you found the victim in?\nBuckler:\nIt's so hard to even think about right now...\nAthena:\nSasha is deeply traumatized by the victim's death...\nPhoenix:\nI guess I shouldn't push her on it, then. (Poor Sasha... She must've really adored him.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nBuckler:\nThe props for the new show were everywhere, and... the captain was in the middle of it all.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThese props for the new show... What kind of things were they?\nBuckler:\nA blow-up dolphin and anchor, Redstache's costume, the bag of coins... Stuff like that. The captain was wearing his usual costume, and the new props were all there.\nPhoenix:\n(Wait a minute... Something about that doesn't seem right... (Changed from [What [sic] a minute... Something about that doesn't seem right...] in the original release) Is there a problem with Sasha's testimony?)\nNo, no problem\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there isn't any particular problem. I'd better get on with the cross-examination.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nYes, there is\nLeads to:\n\"You say the captain was wearing his \"usual costume,\" but is that completely accurate?\"\nAthena:\nDo you think Orla really did make that stuff fall down?\nPhoenix:\nI think we probably need more information before we can know what really happened. Let's be careful not to let a single inconsistency slip by us.\nPhoenix:\nYou say you the captain was wearing his \"usual costume,\" but is that completely accurate?\nBuckler:\nCome on, Phoenix! What are you nitpicking my testimony for?!\nPhoenix:\nIf we look at the body, we see that there's a discrepancy between that and your statement. You stated that the victim was wearing his usual costume. But you'll notice that the victim was wearing a red scarf around his neck. I imagine this red scarf is part of his costume for the new pirate show.\nJudge:\nOh, you're right. It's written right here in the flyer for the new show. \"Featuring the dashing Redstache, with a fluttering red scarf!\"\nAthena:\nAlthough, I have to say, it just looks like a red scarf was added to his OLD costume...\nBuckler:\nYeah, well, the captain was never one to spend too much money on costumes... But, you know, the captain wasn't WEARING that red scarf...\nPhoenix:\nBut in this photo, I believe I see a red scarf...\nBuckler:\nYeah, but it's not wrapped around his neck. It's just draped on top of his neck. That red scarf was packed away with the rest of the new show's equipment. It must've fallen on top of the captain when the equipment fell down.\nPhoenix:\nOh... I see...\nJudge:\nIt looks like your \"discrepancy\" wasn't really a \"discrepancy\" after all.\nPhoenix:\n(So the scarf doesn't have anything to do with the case? But there's something about the timing of the stuff falling that bothers me... Hold on. The timing of the stuff falling... The timing... Maybe... my theory has been all wrong from the beginning! Maybe... the bag of coins isn't the murder weapon!)\nBlackquill:\nHeh heh. And so your last cross-examination ends in failure as well. You should know that such a feeble slash will never hurt me. As I said... the orca made the equipment fall and then toyed with the body in the water.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, Prosecutor Blackquill, but based on the circumstances at the scene... ...the defendant couldn't have dragged the body into the water after the equipment fell.\nBlackquill:\n...Hmm? And why, pray tell, is that?\nPhoenix:\nOh, I'll tell you all right. (If my theory has been all wrong... then I'll just have to fix it!)\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright. Please do tell the court. What indicates that the body was not dragged into the water after the items fell?\nPresent red scarf\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This red scarf fell at the same time as the bag of coins.\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nPlease focus on this point!\nJudge:\nThat point? I don't see any particular problem there.\nPhoenix:\nRight here! No... uh, I mean... right AROUND here! To, uh... somewhere over there-ish... And please also take a look at this area over here as well...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Your \"point\" is gradually expanding to include the entire photograph!\nPhoenix:\n(...Okay. I deserved that. The items that fell were props for the new show. A blow-up dolphin and anchor, the bag of coins, the red scarf, swords... If the body was dragged into the pool AFTER the items fell... ...then a certain piece of evidence shouldn't still be in this photograph.)\nJudge:\nAll right. Please try that again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What indicates that the body was not dragged into the water after the items fell?\"\nPhoenix:\nThis red scarf fell at the same time as the bag of coins. But if the body was dragged into the pool after the bag of coins fell... ...then the red scarf wouldn't still be on top of the body!\nBlackquill:\nWh-What...?!\nPhoenix:\nIn other words, the victim was already dead when the equipment came crashing down! Therefore, the bag of coins that fell with the red scarf was NOT the murder weapon!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nBut it was the defense who claimed the bag of coins was the murder weapon to begin with!\nPhoenix:\nWell... yes, that's true.\nBlackquill:\nDo you intend to abandon your original argument?\nPhoenix:\nAfter hearing the testimony, I realized my theory about the murder weapon was wrong. Please recall the facts we have learned so far. It's a fact that what Orla bit was the victim's dead body.\nJudge:\nAfter all, when we saw the victim on the security footage, he was already dead.\nPhoenix:\nBut then, Orla carried the victim's body to the side of the pool... ...and knocked down the equipment for the new pirate show that was piled up there. Maybe Orla was trying to alert the humans to the victim's condition. If Orla knocked the items down on the victim after he was already dead... ...then it means the defendant didn't kill the victim with those items!\nBlackquill:\nBUT THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS! ............Even still, your argument is lacking... If neither the orca's head-butting nor the bag of coins were the manner of death... ...then how do you propose the victim was killed?\nPhoenix:\nAaaaaaagh!\nJudge:\nA very good point. If the defense is now abandoning its original theory... ...then we would need a new theory as to what the murder weapon was.\nPhoenix:\nUgh... A-All right... (I doubt \"I have no clue\" would go over well.)\nAthena:\nAll right! Let's go over what we still need to find out about the victim's body.\nPhoenix:\nWhat we don't know is how he died and why his body was at the bottom of the pool. I wonder if there's something that would explain both of those things at once?\nAthena:\nHmm... How did the victim's body sink to the bottom of the pool...? On a diagram, it's easy enough to move the body to the bottom of the pool... ...but in real life, the water would just cause the body to float.\nPhoenix:\nRight... (Hold on... Water? Okay. Then what if we flip that around? What if there was no water? Then the body would go right down in an instant. ...So could the real manner of death be...?!) Thanks for the great hint, Athena.\nAthena:\nWhat? I helped you, and I didn't even know it?!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I think we know the real manner of the victim's death!\nJudge:\n\"I think\" won't do, Mr. Wright. I expect a clear answer. Now then, what was the real manner of Jack Shipley's death?\nPhoenix:\n(What's the manner of death that moved the victim to the bottom of the pool in an instant?)\nFalling\nLeads to:\n\"Please take a look at this diagram of the pool.\"\nDrowning\nPhoenix:\nWe believe the victim drowned, Your Honor.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\n............Autopsy report.\nJudge:\nAh, of course! Let's see... Cause of death was \"instant death from a brain contusion.\" Your answer is completely wrong, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n...You're right, Your Honor. Please let me try that again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What's the manner of death that moved the victim to the bottom of the pool in an instant?\"\nAssault\nPhoenix:\nWe believe the victim was assaulted with a blunt instrument, Your Honor!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\n...But nothing like that was found at the crime scene, other than the bag of coins. So if it wasn't the coins, then what was the murder weapon?!\nPhoenix:\nUm... could we just forget I said that...? You know, about the blunt instrument...?\nJudge:\n\"Forget\"...? Very well. I'll try to forget it, but I won't forget to give you a penalty!\nPhoenix:\nGah... Please let me try that again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What's the manner of death that moved the victim to the bottom of the pool in an instant?\"\nPhoenix:\nPlease take a look at this diagram of the pool. If there was no water in the pool... ...then it would be very easy to move the victim's body to the bottom of the pool.\nJudge:\nHe would drop straight down... Oh, my! Could that be the true manner of death...?!\nPhoenix:\nThe orca pool is about sixty-five feet deep. (Changed from [The orca pool is about 65 feet deep.] in the original release) If the victim were to go from the top of the pool to the bottom when there was no water... ...then he would, without question, have fallen to his death!\nJudge:\n...Death from a fall...!\nBlackquill:\nNgh... And that's your answer...?\nAthena:\nIt all makes perfect sense! If he fell, that would explain the \"signs of blunt force trauma all over the body,\" too!\nPhoenix:\nThe culprit pushed the victim into the pool when there was no water in it. After doing something to keep the body from floating up, they filled the pool with water. The pool water washed away any signs of blood, so no one would realize that he fell!\nJudge:\nS-Surprisingly, that actually makes sense! Order! Order in the court! I'm just as surprised as you are, but I must have order! If falling was the manner of death, then does that mean the defendant's behavior... ...was the result of being manipulated by the true culprit, as the defense claimed?!\nPhoenix:\nYes, it would have to be. All that needs to be explained now is how the real culprit commanded Orla! Ms. Buckler, is there a way to instruct Orla to bite someone?\nBuckler:\nWhat?! What kind of trick would that be?! Of course not!\nPhoenix:\nThen could you tell us about the tricks Orla does know?\nBuckler:\nWell, there's jumping, dancing, and playing volleyball. And she can spin, do the rock 'n' roll trick, and sing the Swashbuckler Spectacular song.\nPhoenix:\n(Those sound like pretty nice tricks, but I doubt they're related to this case.)\nBuckler:\nShe's also practicing two new, top-secret tricks. There's the \"human rocket,\" where she shoots somebody up into the air. And then there's the \"lifesaver\" trick, where she brings a drowning person to the surface.\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! One of these \"top-secret\" tricks might have something to do with the case! Now, which of these two tricks sounds relevant to the case?)\nThe human rocket trick\nPhoenix:\nThe human rocket trick shoots a person up into the air. That means Orla shot the victim's body, which had sunk to the bottom, up to the surface!\nJudge:\nHmm... Are you implying that's how the victim's body got to the surface? In that case, when did the bite marks get onto the victim's clothes?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? (Oops. I forgot about those.)\nJudge:\nI can't accept your theory unless it explains all of the circumstances of this case.\nPhoenix:\n(Orla has two \"top-secret\" tricks. The human rocket trick, where she shoots somebody up into the air. And the lifesaver trick, where she brings a drowning person to the surface.)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now, which of these two tricks sounds relevant to the case?\"\nThe lifesaver trick\nLeads to:\n\"So, in the lifesaver trick, Orla brings a drowning person to the surface, correct?\"\nPhoenix:\nSo, in the lifesaver trick, Orla brings a drowning person to the surface, correct?\nBuckler:\nYou cod it! Orla's still learning how to hold someone gently in her mouth... ...so she sometimes bites into their clothes, but she's never hurt a person's skin.\nAthena:\nShe brings a drowning person to the surface?! Then that must be it...!\nDePlume:\nAnd then the killer whale swam up toward the surface with the victim in its mouth!\nJudge:\nThat matches up perfectly with what Ms. DePlume said in her testimony!\nPhoenix:\nThe real culprit must have used the lifesaver trick command to manipulate Orla!\nJudge:\nHmm... I still find this very hard to believe.\nPhoenix:\nThen let's see it for ourselves. Let's have Orla show us her trick using a practice dummy.\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. As you wish.\nJudge:\nThe prosecution doesn't appear to have any objection. Ms. Buckler, please proceed.\nBuckler:\nOkay, sure! I'll show you Orla's fin-omenal trick! Hey, Marlon! Are you ready over there?\nRimes:\nOkay, lemme just go get the practice dummy... ...There! It's in the pool! Ready and standin' by, Sasha!\nBuckler:\nHere goes! Orla's secret new trick, the lifesaver!\nAnime cutscene\nRimes:\nThe clothes got torn up a little, but the dummy doesn't have any new marks on it!\nOrla:\nFwee, fweet! Fwee, fweeeeet!\nBuckler:\nAnd there you have it! Orla's secret new trick!\nMan:\nWow! That orca is really something!\nWoman:\nA cute thing like that wouldn't hurt anybody!\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like the gallery loved Orla's performance!)\nAthena:\nThat was great! That awesome trick captured everybody's heart!\nJudge:\nHo ho ho! Wonderful! I wish I could see more!\nBlackquill:\n............\nAthena:\nLooks like we silenced Prosecutor Blackquill!\nPhoenix:\nThank you, Orla and Ms. Buckler. And thank you, too, Mr. Rimes. And so now you can clearly see that Orla was manipulated. The bottom of the orca pool needs to be examined immediately! We might still find some evidence of the victim falling to his death!\nJudge:\nProsecutor Blackquill, please have that taken care of at once!\nBlackquill:\n............\nJudge:\nUh, excuse me, Prosecutor Blackquill, but I am requesting further investigation...\nBlackquill:\n............ GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\nFulbright:\nTsk, tsk, Prosecutor Blackquill! You have to answer the nice judge politely! Oh, that's right! I almost forgot! The thing you asked for just came in.\nBlackquill:\nNgh... And you couldn't be bothered to think of a less violent way to deliver it...?\nPhoenix:\n(What did Prosecutor Blackquill ask for?)\nBlackquill:\nHmph............ I've been waiting for this.\nJudge:\nOh? And what is that?\nBlackquill:\n............An updated autopsy report.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! Why did it have to come now?!\nBlackquill:\nDuring the recess, I ordered the body to be re-examined. Something started nagging at me during the course of the trial, you see. ............Here.\nJudge:\nI take it you'd like me to read it? Very well. \"Cause of Death... Thought to be from 65-foot fall\"!\nShipley's Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nB-But this...! But this is decisive evidence that substantiates Mr. Wright's theory!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! (It's something... GOOD for a change?!)\nJudge:\nIf the manner of death was falling into an empty pool, the orca can't be responsible. It seems Orla's complete innocence has been proven.\nBlackquill:\nHmph............ I suppose I can't deny that.\nAthena:\nThis is fantastic! You did it, Mr. Wright! Prosecutor Blackquill isn't even trying to refute it! Orla is saved!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah... (Is it really safe to celebrate...?)\nJudge:\nIt would appear more investigation into this case is necessary. But first allow me to render my verdict. The court finds the defendant, Ora Shipley...\nNot Guilty\nBuckler:\nYou did it! Thank you so much, Phoenix! Thank you, Athena! Orla and Marlon thank you, too!\nRimes:\nCongrats, Sasha!\nOrla:\nFwee, fweet!\nRimes:\nTime to celebrate! Go on! Eat up!\nOrla:\nFwee, fwee, fweet!\nAthena:\nHee hee! Glad to see everybody so happy! And I'm absolutely thrilled about the verdict!\nBlackquill:\n............ ...Thank you, Wright-dono.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?! For what?\nBlackquill:\nHmph... The drained pool... Thanks to you, the truth is finally clear. Fool Bright............ Arrest this woman.\nFulbright:\nCertainly! Right away, Prosecutor Blackquill! Sasha Buckler, you are hereby under arrest for the murder of Jack Shipley!\nBuckler:\nWHAAAT?!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you talking about?! What reason could you possibly have?!\nBlackquill:\nCome now. You must have had some idea in the back of your dull, little mind. The true culprit manipulated the orca in order to have false charges brought upon her. ...And who is the only one with the ability to accomplish that? It can only be the orca's trainer!\nPhoenix:\nBut I'm sure there's some other explanation!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nI don't need any of your baseless counterarguments... Have you forgotten? In order to enter the orca pool room, a security card is necessary. A security card that only the victim and Sasha Buckler possessed! Ms. Buckler is the only one who could have caused the victim to fall to his death!\nPhoenix:\nAaaaaaagh!\nJudge:\nWh-What?!\nAthena:\nNo! I don't believe it! Ms. Buckler was so upset by Mr. Shipley's death! She couldn't have done it!\nBlackquill:\n............Fool Bright.\nFulbright:\nWe asked the security company yesterday to check their security card logs. Their report just came in during the recess. The night before the incident, Sasha Buckler used her card to enter the orca pool room. After that, not a single person entered the pool room! Not until the incident was discovered, when Ms. Buckler and the guard ran in.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut no one would commit murder where their card usage was being recorded!\nFulbright:\nApparently, the aquarium employees don't know that their card usage is tracked. What's more, Ms. Buckler was seen arguing with the victim before the incident. So, Ms. Trainer, what were you arguing about?\nBuckler:\nIt was... a private matter... But it wasn't anything I would kill him over! That's ridiculous!\nBlackquill:\nMs. Buckler is the only one who entered the room, and she knows how to command Orla. Besides, I thought her suspicious from the very beginning.\nPhoenix:\nYou suspected Ms. Buckler from the start?\nBlackquill:\nThe orca did tricks because someone commanded her to do so. Possibly someone with a heart so black as to make her own partner the murder weapon! The possibility the orca killed the victim... The possibility a human manipulated the orca... I looked into both.\nPhoenix:\n(So he suspected both Sasha and Orla all along...)\nBlackquill:\nHmph... My gratitude to you. After all... ...you were the one who drew out that information about the lifesaver trick. The orca you saved was an unwitting victim. A victim made to look like the weapon that killed Jack Shipley.\nPhoenix:\nUngg... N-NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\nFulbright:\nAll right, come along, then. Let's have a good, long talk...\nBuckler:\nWait! I didn't kill the captain! And I would never try to frame Orla! Why would I hurt the ones I love like that?!\nAthena:\nSasha...!\nBuckler:\nPhoenix! Athena! You gotta believe me! I--\nAthena:\nSasha didn't kill him! I believe that with all my heart! There's gotta be something we can do!\nPhoenix:\n(I feel the same way... Could I have done something differently? But never in my wildest dreams did I imagine things turning out like this!)\nJudge:\nHmm... It would appear that this case has taken on an entirely new aspect. But this trial is only concerned with a ruling on the defendant, Ora Shipley. So I'm afraid this concludes today's trial. Court is adjourned!\nTo be continued\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis piece of evidence clearly exposes the witness's lie!\nJudge:\nIt does? In what way...?\nBlackquill:\nIt does indeed expose something... the defense's boneheadedness. There is nothing untoward about that evidence, no matter how you bluster.\nJudge:\nI agree. There is nothing compelling in that evidence.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm definitely losing the judge's confidence in me here...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! What is your opinion on the witness's statement just now?\nJudge:\nMy opinion? My opinion is that there is nothing wrong with it.\nPhoenix:\nOh... This is my first trial in eight years. It looks like I made a little mistake...\nJudge:\nThat is no excuse, Mr. Wright. I should give you eight years' worth of penalties!\nPhoenix:\n(It's been eight years. Can't he go easy on me?)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThat statement is clearly inconsistent with this evidence, Your Honor!\nBlackquill:\nI hope you don't think waving your finger about aimlessly... ...is going to help you win this trial!\nJudge:\nHmm... I agree. I see nothing inconsistent with that evidence.\nPhoenix:\nUrk! (I must have the wrong evidence...)\nConsult (when evidence must be presented)\nAthena:\nMr. Wright! I think I have something here!\nPhoenix:\nYou sensed something wrong with the testimony?\nAthena:\nThat's right. Let me show you which statement I thought was strange!\nPhoenix:\nThanks. That would be a big help! (Then I'll just have to compare the evidence with the statement she shows me!)\nConsult (when statements must be pressed)\nAthena:\nMr. Wright, I don't see any inconsistencies in the testimony. This might be a good time to--\nPhoenix:\nPress for more information? I think you're right.\nAthena:\nI just can't help but feel that there's more to this statement than meets the eye.\nPhoenix:\n(I'll put my faith in Athena and press on that statement, then!)\nPinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment \"What I Saw and What I Heard\")\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhen we view your emotions alongside your testimony, we find the unexpected emotion-- (Wait a minute... There really isn't anything strange here.)\nAthena:\nI don't know, but I think maybe we made a mistake, Mr. Wright...\nPhoenix:\n......I think maybe you're right.\nAthena:\nLet's take another look! There must be an unexpected emotion here somewhere!\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Ora Shipley...\nGuilty\nTurnabout Reclaimed\nImage Gallery\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nJuly 21, 1:13 PMWright Anything Agency\nAthena:\n*siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh*\nTrucy:\nThat was a big sigh, Athena.\nApollo:\nDid you... lose the case?\nPhoenix:\nNo, we won. The defendant was found not guilty.\nApollo:\nHuh? Then why are you so dejected?\nTrucy:\nDaddy... were you being mean to her?\nApollo:\nWhat?! Picking on the new kid? Not cool, Mr. Wright. Not cool...\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute! Talk about false accusations! We were able to prove the defendant's innocence...\nAthena:\n...But then Sasha got arrested instead.\nTrucy:\nSo that's what happened. That's too bad...\nApollo:\nSo what are you two going to do now?\nPhoenix:\n...We're going to get to the bottom of this. I don't believe for a second that Sasha did what they're accusing her of.\nAthena:\nI-I don't believe it, either! I won't give up! Boss, let's go see Sasha and tell her we want to represent her!\nPhoenix:\nRight now, I imagine she's still being questioned by the police. Let's get started on the investigation first, and look for proof of her innocence.\nAthena:\nSounds like a plan!\nTrucy:\nJust leave the office to me and Polly, Daddy.\nApollo:\nIf there's anything I can do to help, just say the word!\nPhoenix:\nThanks. If you could organize the evidence and clean the office, that'd be great.\nApollo:\n...I meant, anything I could do as a lawyer...\nUnnecessary evidence given to Apollo.\nPhoenix:\n(That takes care of that. Time to head to the scene of the crime!)\nJuly 21Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool\nAthena:\nHuh? There's no water in this pool. Orlaaa! Where are youuu?\nOrla:\n...Fweet...\nPhoenix:\nI can hear her at the bottom of the pool. Maybe there's some water down there.\nAthena:\nOrla sounds so sad. Maybe she misses Sasha.\n???:\nCareful, there! You shouldn't get right up to the edge like that!\nFulbright:\nYou don't want to end up like the victim! Besides, the police are still conducting their investigation here. Don't go poking around!\nAthena:\nDetective Fulbright...! Grrr!\nFulbright:\nIs something wrong, Ms. Lawyer? You look angry.\nAthena:\nI object to you arresting Ms. Buckler!\nPhoenix:\nDetective, I'd like to ask you some questions about the case, if you don't mind.\nFulbright:\nGo right ahead!\nTalk\nWhy arrest Buckler?\nAthena:\nMs. Buckler is one-hundred-percent innocent, so why did you arrest her?!\nFulbright:\nI understand your desire to believe in her. But the fact remains that she's suspicious! Right now, there are investigators on the scene, so you can come in as you please... ...but ordinarily, a security card is required to enter this orca pool room. The victim and Sasha Buckler were the only ones who possessed this card. And yesterday, the day of the incident, there's proof the suspect's card was used.\nSecurity Card added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nO-Objection! Somebody else could have used Ms. Buckler's card!\nFulbright:\nOh, my! I guess that would be one possible explanation...\nAthena:\nHee hee! Didn't I sound just like a lawyer right there?\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah. (We'd kinda be in trouble if you didn't...)\nFulbright:\nExcept! The suspect confirmed she entered the room at the time the record states. She said she was here from 3:00 to 6:00 AM on July 20th. Apparently, she was giving the orca pool room a good cleaning.\nPhoenix:\nCleaning, in the middle of the night?\nFulbright:\nYes, she said that a lot of the heavy-duty cleaning is done at night. The suspect also admits that she was fighting with the owner before his murder. What's more, nobody saw the victim again after he met with the suspect.\nAthena:\nO-Objection...! Um, there must be something I can object to in there somewhere...\nPhoenix:\nSave your objections for tomorrow's trial. By the way, Detective Fulbright, do you think Ms. Buckler's questioning is over?\nFulbright:\nNo, not yet. But I told the guy in charge to take it easy on her...\nAthena:\nWhy? Is something wrong?\nFulbright:\n...Oops! Forget I said anything. It doesn't concern you two anyway.\nPhoenix:\nBut it does concern us. We intend to represent Ms. Buckler.\nFulbright:\nWhat? You do? In that case, I have a favor to ask. Could you get this medicine to her?\nPhoenix:\nMedicine...? Looks like a prescription from Hickfield Clinic... (I've spent some time at that hospital, myself.)\nFulbright:\nWe confiscated it from her home when we were doing a search. I can't get away here, so if you could make sure she gets it, that would be great.\nAthena:\nMedicine, huh...? Does Ms. Buckler have some illness?\nFulbright:\nUm... I think that's the kind of question you'd better ask her. In justice we trust! Now I need to get back to the investigation.\nPrescription Bag added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nWe can give it to her as soon as they let us talk to her. (And we have to return her calendar to her as well. If we can't see Sasha or investigate, we should question people at the aquarium...)\nWhy arrest Buckler? (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nMs. Buckler is one-hundred-percent innocent, so why did you arrest her?!\nFulbright:\nI understand your desire to believe in her. But the fact remains that she's suspicious! Right now, there are investigators on the scene, so you can come in as you please... ...but ordinarily, a security card is required to enter this orca pool room.

Um, there must be something I can object to in there somewhere...\nPhoenix:\nSave your objections for tomorrow's trial.\nPresent\nFish\nFulbright:\nAre you trying to bribe me?! What a heinous act! I'll bring justice down upon you!\nPhoenix:\nThis is food for the penguin. I wasn't trying to give it to you.\nAthena:\nWhat kind of a person gives fish as a bribe?!\nFulbright:\nOh, you'd be surprised. All kinds of people try to buy the police's favor... A politician once even sent me some raw meat as a bribe.\nPhoenix:\nRaw meat? So what did you do with it?\nFulbright:\nIt goes without saying! I returned it to him, and then I arrested him! The meat was rotten by the time he got it back, though...\nPhoenix:\n(Must've been a pretty rotten day for the politician altogether...)\nPrescription Bag\nFulbright:\nPlease give that to Sasha Buckler! It's very important that she has it!\nAthena:\nYou're pretty considerate, aren't you, even to a suspect.\nFulbright:\nOf course! I treat everyone justly and fairly, no matter who they are!\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, you'll share the prosecution's information with us, right? It's only fair.\nFulbright:\nHmm. You've got a point there, but... Hmmmmmmmm... Quite the pickle...\nAthena:\n...His heart is filled with confusion. I don't think we'll get him to listen now.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I didn't really think that was going to work...\nWright Anything Agency\nTalk\nWhat to do\nTrucy:\nSo Sasha Buckler got arrested, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Do you know Sasha?\nTrucy:\nOne of my magician friends told me about her. He said she was a great performer. He said she was like a different person when she gets on stage.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well... she does wear a mustache during her act...\nTrucy:\nWhat? A mustache? Maybe I should wear a mustache, too. Or cat whiskers...\nPhoenix:\nWell, if you think that will help your act, I say go for it.\nAny ideas?\nTrucy:\nRemember, investigation and questioning people are a lawyer's two main tools! Even if you've already checked a place, you might find something new if you look again.\nPhoenix:\nWell, listen to you! You sound like a regular little lawyer lady all of a sudden.\nTrucy:\nWell, you haven't worked as a lawyer for a long time. I'm worried about you! It's just like magic. If you don't keep practicing, you get rusty.\nAthena:\nYou have a good point there, Trucy. So we lawyers have to keep mowing the prosecutors down, to stay sharp?\nPhoenix:\nI guess that's one way of putting it.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nTrucy:\nCongratulations on your big comeback, Daddy! You look sharp in your suit! ...But I'm a little sad, too. Now I'm the only entertainer left in our agency...\nPhoenix:\nThat's not true. We still have Apollo.\nAthena:\nI bet Apollo could be a first-rate talent in no time!\nTrucy:\nOh, you're right! He'd be great as my magician's assistant, for example.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, we're all basically entertainers here when we don't have a legal case to work on.\nAthena:\nR-Really?! I'd better start working on an act, then!\nPhoenix:\n(I was just kidding.)\nSwashbuckler Flyer or Swashbuckler Video\nTrucy:\nThat Swashbuckler Spectacular at Shipshape Aquarium is my number-one competition!\nPhoenix:\nOh, is it, now?\nTrucy:\nThey talk about that show a lot at the Wonder Bar. I've been studying up on their format, you know.\nPhoenix:\nI think your magic show is pretty great just as it is.\nTrucy:\nThanks, Daddy! But I'd like to do an underwater magic show someday, too. For example, I'd love to do one of those underwater escape acts!\nPhoenix:\nAbsolutely not! Too dangerous!\nFish\nTrucy:\nYou want me to do that magic trick where I instantly turn a whole fish into just bones?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean that \"magic trick\" where you EAT the fish?\nTrucy:\nHow about the trick where I turn a fish into a dish?\nPhoenix:\nNow you're just rhyming words.\nTrucy:\nI can turn a fish into a fist, too!\nPhoenix:\n...I'm starting to wonder how far you're going to run with this one.\nTrucy:\nThere are unlimited possibilities when it comes to my Magic Panties trick!\nAnything else\nTrucy:\nOoh! Did you buy that for me to do a magic trick with?!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but this is evidence. I'll have Apollo buy you something instead.\nAqua Tunnel or Pub O' Danger (before clearing \"Why arrest Buckler?\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool)\nTalk\nWhat to do\nAthena:\nI can't believe it! Just when we prove Orla innocent, Sasha gets arrested! I'll never forgive that Prosecutor Blackquill and Detective Fulbright! This stress on my heart is just too much!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Athena. She's really upset...) We'd better do some more investigating if we want to save Sasha. Let's check the orca pool room again and question everybody involved.\nAthena:\nGee, Mr. Wright! You sure know how to stay calm in a crisis! I can top that! LOOK HOW CALM I CAN BE!\nPhoenix:\n(Yes, the very definition of \"calm,\" I'd say...) Good for you. Now let's get back to the investigation.\nAny ideas?\nAthena:\nI had a thought. How about if I try getting on Taka's good side? Then maybe he wouldn't attack when that awful Prosecutor Blackquill told him to!\nPhoenix:\n(Not sure it's that simple, but, anyway...) How are you going to get on his good side?\nAthena:\nWell, if I made myself smell like meat, he'd start to like me! The way to a bird's heart is through his nose, right?\nPhoenix:\nI'd rather you didn't smell like meat while you were standing next to me at the bench.\nPresent\n\"The Killer Killer Whale\"\nAthena:\nIt's just horrible! How could Ms. DePlume write such mean things about Orla?! This awful book made the judge doubt her innocence!\nPhoenix:\nEspecially since he's a fan of Ms. DePlume's work.\nAthena:\nI read the book, too, you know... I hate to admit it, but it's a real page-turner. It really brought the scenes to life. Ms. DePlume is a powerful writer. She knows how to capture the reader's imagination. ...Maybe I'll ask her to sign the book for me.\nPhoenix:\nWell, what do you know. Looks like you really DID become a fan.\nAfter clearing \"Why arrest Buckler?\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool:\nJuly 21Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger\nAthena:\nHuh? That door is open. It was closed yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you know what we have to do, right?\nAthena:\nOf course, Boss! We sneak in and check it out!\n???:\nHey, you two! Who barges into a person's lab without permission?!\nAthena:\nEeek! We're sorry!\nPhoenix:\nMy apologies, sir. She insisted...\nAthena:\nDon't throw me under the bus, Mr. Wright!\n???:\nThe polite thing to do is nock and ask if you can come in! Now, start over!\nAthena:\nY-Yes, siiir!\n*knock, knock*\n???:\nCome in.\nAthena:\nThank you! Sorry to bother you!\n???:\nNow, what can I do for you? Medical problems?\nAthena:\nUm, well, yes... I'm not feeling super good at the moment... We're not making any progress on this murder investigation, and--\n???:\n...Hey, Miss? Where is the patient? Don't you have your pet with you? ...Oh, wait a minute. That was my last job. This is the aquarium... I was exhausted from all that questioning... I must've fallen asleep.\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What's with this guy...?)\n???:\n...My apologies. I just woke up, and I was a little groggy.\nCrab:\nI'm Dr. Herman Crab. I'm Shipshape Aquarium's resident veterinarian.\nAthena:\nOh! You're the \"Dr. Crab\" Mr. Rimes mentioned yesterday!\nPhoenix:\n(And Rimes also mentioned he hadn't seen Dr. Crab around... I wonder where he was?)\nCrab:\n...Son of a gun. This little thing doesn't let me get any sleep.\n???:\n*peep!* *peep, peep, peep!*\nAthena:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw! What a cute little thing! Who is it?\nCrab:\nA penguin chick, a member of the Little Penguin species. She lives in my hair.\nAthena:\nOh, you're so lucky! I wish I had a pet to live in my hair!\nPhoenix:\nAthena, no pets allowed in my office.\nAthena:\nAww, you're no fun...\nCrab:\nIf you two don't have any particular business with me, please leave. I have to get ready to make my rounds. ...Back in you go, little one.\nPhoenix:\nWait! We'd like to ask you a few questions, to save Ms. Buckler!\nCrab:\nHold on... Don't tell me you're the curious pair who defended Orla?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. Please let us ask you a little about the case.\nTalk\nHerman Crab\nPhoenix:\nDr. Crab, were you gone from the aquarium yesterday?\nCrab:\nThat's right. I had some minor business at the Supermarine Aquarium.\nPhoenix:\n\"S-Supermarine\"? That's a funny name for an aquarium.\nAthena:\nThe Supermarine Aquarium is the nation's biggest dolphin therapy treatment center! I go there, myself. I'm friends with their dolphins!\nPhoenix:\nYou and Apollo were talking about animal-assisted therapy yesterday, weren't you?\nCrab:\nI go to the Supermarine once a month, but I live here, of course.\nPhoenix:\nYou LIVE here at the aquarium?!\nCrab:\nThat's right. I have a sleeping bag here, and sometimes I use the nap room. I'm responsible for the health and well-being of all the marine creatures here. If any of them have a sudden medical emergency, I'll be here to help them.\nAthena:\nWow. You're kind of rough around the edges, Dr. Crab, but you care about your work!\nCrab:\n...Hey, buddy? Is this young lady trying to pick a fight with me?\nPhoenix:\n...I apologize for her, sir. She tends to be too honest.\nCrab:\nWell, you're no paragon of politeness, either, apparently.\nThe penguin chick\nAthena:\nCan we see the penguin chick again?!\nCrab:\nStop! Don't come any closer!\n???:\n*peeeeeeep!*\nAthena:\nOWWWWW!\nCrab:\nI'm sorry she attacked you. She doesn't like anyone but me, I'm afraid. I was the first one she saw when she hatched, so she thinks I'm her parent. She targets people from my hair, so please be careful.\nPhoenix:\nShe's just like a little sniper, isn't she?\nCrab:\nExactly. That's why I named her \"Sniper.\" Her mother's name is \"Rifle.\"\nPhoenix:\n(\"Sniper\" and \"Rifle,\" huh? What a dangerous-sounding mother and daughter.)\nAthena:\nSo this is Rifle's daughter! ...Which means both mother and daughter now hate me.\nCrab:\nLittle Penguins are generally belligerent little creatures. It's hard to get them to warm up. But they're nocturnal, so you might be able to touch them during the day.\nPhoenix:\nYou and Sniper get along well, don't you? Just like Sasha and Orla.\nCrab:\nBut unlike Sniper and me, the two of them seem to truly understand one another. This one keeps me awake every night! Looks like I won't sleep until she leaves the nest.\nPhoenix:\n(It must be rough for him... but it's pretty cute to watch for us...)\nAbout the murder\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me anything about Jack Shipley's murder?\nCrab:\nGah! ...I still can't believe Jack is gone... He's the one who brought me on board. How could he up and die on me?!\nAthena:\nDid you and Mr. Shipley get along?\nCrab:\nHe loved all animals and fish, but I'm not like that. ...But I still took pride in my work as a vet, nonetheless. We got along well enough as business associates. And it's thanks to him my laboratory is what it is today.\nPhoenix:\nIt IS a pretty amazing laboratory.\nCrab:\nAh, you have discerning taste, I see. I could tell you more about my lab, if you'd like.\nDr. Crab's lab (appears after \"About the murder\")\nAthena:\nThis place is just filled with electronics! What are those monitors for?\nCrab:\nEssentially, they're digital medical records for all the creatures here. I can also view the feed from the visitor's corridor security camera here. That way, I can see that silly mother penguin when she tries to escape.\nPhoenix:\nSo you were the one who gave this security footage to the police?\nCrab:\nNo, I wasn't here yesterday, but I did give my permission for them to take it. And I gave them a statement about Jack and Sasha arguing.\nAthena:\nOh! So you were the one who witnessed it?\nCrab:\nThat's right. It was late in the evening of the 19th, maybe about midnight. I saw them fighting near the Aqua Tunnel. I don't know what their argument was about, though.\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure you should be talking to us about this?\nCrab:\nI'm not taking sides. I'll give information to anyone who wants it. What you do with that information at Sasha's trial is up to you.\nAthena:\nWow. You're kind of rough around the edges, Dr. Crab, but you're a pretty nice guy!\nCrab:\nHmph! You ARE trying to pick a fight, aren't you, young lady?!\nAthena:\nAww, isn't that cute! He's easily embarrassed!\nPresent\nPhoto of the Body or Shipley's Autopsy Report\nCrab:\nSon of a gun! How could you die before fulfilling your promise to me?!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Shipley promised you something?\nCrab:\nHe promised he would make Shipshape Aquarium the greatest aquarium in the world. It was because of that promise that I agreed to become the resident vet here.\nAthena:\nSo you were just a regular veterinarian before this?\nCrab:\nThat's right. Big or small, there is no living creature I cannot treat! Would you like me to examine you?\nAthena:\nWhat?! You can treat people, too? You're amazing, Dr. Crab!\nCrab:\n...I was joking, of course. Ooh, you walked right into that one!\nAthena:\nGRRRRRRRRRRR! You're awful, Dr. Crab!\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, so that makes him... amazingly awful...?)\nAnything else\nCrab:\nHmm? Don't waste my time with useless nonsense. I'm sleepy, I tell you!\nPhoenix:\n(He won't even glance at it.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nSniper:\n*peep*... *peep, peep, peep!*\nCrab:\nHuh? Son of a gun. Are you hungry again already? And that silly mother penguin's nowhere to be found again...\nSniper:\n*peep* *peep, peep, peep!*\nCrab:\nGaaaaagh! Would you quit peeping in my ear?! According to her walkie-talkie, Rifle is somewhere around the Aqua Tunnel. If you see her, could you bring her to me? I have to go examine some other creatures...\nAthena:\nNo sweat! And this time, I'll get her to like me, too!\nPhoenix:\n(Rifle has escaped again? What is she, she the Houdini of the penguin world?) There's no guarantee we'll find her right away but let's head for the Aqua Tunnel.\nJuly 21Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel\nDePlume:\nAaaaagh! It's you two! The blue and yellow duo! I'm very angry about what you did this morning!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh. We ran into the sea lion before our penguin...)\nDePlume:\nI write the truth. And I will find the truth with my own eyes! I won't be bested by the likes of the blue and yellow duo!\nPhoenix:\n(When did we become the \"blue and yellow duo\"...?)\nWidget:\nAthena will never give up!\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, I'll leave the questioning to you, Athena.\nAthena:\nThanks a lot, Widget. Well, at least she's a worthy adversary! Okay! Let's do this!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. You'll do great! (You know, being the boss isn't half bad.)\nTalk\nLast year's scoop\nAthena:\nHave you been gathering material about last year's incident ever since?\nDePlume:\nThat is correct. An acquaintance of the victim asked me to look into it, you see.\nPhoenix:\nAn acquaintance of the victim?\nDePlume:\nI refuse to divulge any information about my clients. The aquarium is saying it was an accident, but I don't believe that's the truth. It seems to me they're all hiding something -- every last one of them! The only thing I can think is that the killer whale murdered that poor girl.\nAthena:\nBut you don't even know if that's true or not!\nDePlume:\nThat's enough out of you, yellow girl! As I said, I'm still investigating the matter... Once I learn the truth, I plan to write a sequel to this book.\nPhoenix:\n(She's completely taken with her \"investigation\"...)\nDePlume:\nI came to make a report on the anniversary of the previous trainer's death... ...only to find the aquarium owner murdered! I was deeply shocked.\nPhoenix:\n(So this incident happened on the exact same date as the last one...? It can't be a coincidence... Anyway, we'd better ask Ms. DePlume about today's trial.)\nToday's trial (appears after \"Last year's scoop\")\nAthena:\nSo you heard Orla singing, and that's when you realized something was happening?\nDePlume:\nCorrect! ...Ooh, it's all so galling! I still can't believe the culprit used ME, Norma DePlume! In any case, I swear that killer whale song brings misfortune. First last year, now again...\nAthena:\nA fun song like that?! How could it bring misfortune to anyone?!\nDePlume:\nYou think that barbaric song is \"fun\"? I'll never understand the tastes of children...\nPhoenix:\n...I don't remember that Swashbuckler Spectacular song being all that \"barbaric\"...\nDePlume:\nWell, if you don't remember it, I will gladly sing it for you!\nAnime cutscene\nDePlume:\n\u266a Avast, mateys! Landlubbers, ho! \u266a\n\u266a Hand o'er all yer gold! \u266a\n\u266a Pillage, plunder, then feast like kings! \u266a\n\u266a Them's the joys of pirating! \u266a\nDePlume:\n...That's how it goes. Now, what is \"fun\" about those lyrics, pray tell?\nPhoenix:\n(She seemed to be enjoying it well enough...)\nAthena:\nWait a minute! That isn't the Swashbuckler Spectacular song! THIS is the song from the Swashbuckler Spectacular!\nAnime cutscene\nAthena:\n\u266a Oh, we be pirates, we love to sail the seven seas. \u266a\n\u266a Just a bunch o' scallywags who are as free as free can be. \u266a\n\u266a We swim through storms and waves, all because, you see \u266a\n\u266a Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me! \u266a\nDePlume:\n............What was that? I've never heard that song before.\nAthena:\nWhat? It's the song they use in the Swashbuckler Spectacular! Oh, we be pirates, we love to sail the seven seas. Just a bunch o' scallywags who are as free as free can be. We swim through storms and waves, all because, you see Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me!\nDePlume:\nBut that can't be! It's completely different from the song a year ago! Avast, mateys! Landlubbers, ho! Hand o'er all yer gold! Pillage, plunder, then feast like kings! Them's the joys of pirating! Unless you show me some proof, I won't believe your song is right!\nAthena:\nGrr! She's so stubborn!\nPhoenix:\nWell, if it's proof she wants, it's proof she'll get of the Swashbuckler Spectacular song.\nDangerous Animal Control (appears after \"Today's trial\", then presenting Swashbuckler Video)\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell us about this \"Center for Dangerous Animal Control\"?\nDePlume:\nJust as the name implies, it's an organization that monitors dangerous animals. The center demanded that the aquarium put the killer whale down a year ago.\nAthena:\nP-Put her down?!\nDePlume:\nBut the aquarium owner refused their demand, saying it was an accidental death. But I hardly think a persistent organization like that would just give up and go away. I'm quite sure the power of money helped convince them!\nPhoenix:\nWhat makes you think that?\nDePlume:\nOnce a month, the owner and the vet disappear from this aquarium. And I came to find out that, each time, a large amount of money was being paid out!\nAthena:\nOh! And you think the money was going to this Center for Dangerous Animal Control?\nDePlume:\n...I'm looking into it now. You'll have to wait until my book comes out to see! In any case, I can't catch that man out on anything... ...but that veterinarian is not to be trusted.\nPhoenix:\n(Dr. Herman Crab... There's still so much we don't know about him...)\nAthena:\nWell, I don't see Rifle here. What do you want to do next?\nPhoenix:\nI think we'd better stop by the office and discuss a plan of action.\nPresent\nSwashbuckler Video (after clearing \"Today's trial\" Talk option)\nPhoenix:\nThis recording contains the Swashbuckler Spectacular song. In it, you can hear Ms. Buckler and Orla singing together. (Changed from [In it, you can see Ms. Buckler and Orla singing together.] in the original release)\nOrla:\nFwe fwe fweet, fwe fwe fwe fweeet! Fwe fwe fwe fweet, fwe fwe fwe fweet! (Changed from [Fwe fwe fweet. Fwe fwe fwe fweeet!

B-But I've never heard this song before!\nAthena:\nHuh? But they always sing this song during the Swashbuckler Spectacular...\nDePlume:\nWell, I haven't seen the show recently... A year ago, they used the song that I sang to you. I'd recognize it anywhere! Perhaps that killer whale can sing two songs?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to Ms. Buckler, Orla only knows one song.\nDePlume:\nThen... what was that song that I heard...?\nAthena:\nWe wish we knew...\nPhoenix:\n(The orca sang a song she isn't supposed to know how to sing...?)\nSwashbuckler Video updated in the Court Record.\nDePlume:\nIt's obvious I have a lot more investigating to do on Shipshape Aquarium. And perhaps I'd better look into the Center for Dangerous Animal Control as well...\nPhoenix:\n(The Center for Dangerous Animal Control? What's that?)\nSwashbuckler Video (after clearing \"Today's trial\" Talk option; subsequent times)\nDePlume:\nI can't believe it! A song I've never heard before... Of course, I haven't seen the show since the incident a year ago...\nPhoenix:\nWhy not?\nDePlume:\nBecause the owner was in the show, and I thought it best he didn't see me. I've been banned from the aquarium, after all.\nAthena:\nBeing able to say that with your head held high proves you're somebody who matters!\nPhoenix:\n(And being able to say that right in front of somebody proves you're a newbie, Athena.)\n\"The Killer Killer Whale\"\nDePlume:\nIf it's an autograph you want, I give them out to anyone, no matter who it is. But make sure you've read the entire book before you ask. After all, the worth of a book is not who the writer is or what the cover looks like.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh. That actually made sense.) ...I'll be sure to read it.\nAthena:\nI read it! I hate to admit it, but I thought it was very well-written.\nDePlume:\nWell, well, yellow girl. I just might have to learn your name.\nAthena:\nReally?! It's Athena Cykes!\nDePlume:\nI simply wrote \"to banana girl\" when I signed your book. Because of the yellow, you see.\nAthena:\n\"B-Banana girl\"?! That's the worst one yet!\nPhoenix:\nSo, do you regret being a fan now?\nAfter clearing \"Dangerous Animal Control\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel:\nJuly 21Wright Anything Agency\nTrucy:\n3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! (Changed from [3, 2, 1...... Ta-da!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nWow! You pulled Mr. Nick's cell phone from your Magic Panties! That's Amazing!\nTrucy:\nHee hee. That's all for Trucy's magic show! Come back and see me next time!\nApollo:\nGreat job, Trucy. You never fail to impress. I have no idea how you did that, either.\nPhoenix:\nWe're back... Oh, Pearls! Stopping by for a visit?\nPearl:\nHee hee. Hello, Mr. Nick. Are you missing something...?\nPhoenix:\nUh, thanks... (From out of the ol' Magic Panties, huh...)\nApollo:\nHow is the investigation going, Mr. Wright?\nTalk\nThe investigation\nLeads to:\n\"We don't have much time, but we didn't get a chance to check out the crime scene yet.\"\nPresent\nSwashbuckler Video\nApollo:\nAthena already made me watch it so many times, I remember the whole show.\nPhoenix:\nWhen this case is over, we should go see the show live.\nApollo:\nI bet Trucy would like it.\nAthena:\nGee, I sure would like to see a head-to-head between Sasha and Trucy!\nApollo:\nMagician versus pirate, huh? That would be one wild show, I bet.\nAthena:\nAnd we could join the fray as a band of lawyers! Right, Boss?\nPhoenix:\nThat would be even wilder than a day in court, I bet...\nPhoenix:\nWe don't have much time, but we didn't get a chance to check out the crime scene yet.\nApollo:\nI see...\nTrucy:\nOh! Speaking of checking out the crime scene, Daddy... You should bring your forensics kit with you! Fingerprint powder to check for prints, and luminol testing fluid to look for blood!\nAthena:\nWow, Trucy! I didn't know you had stuff like that, too!\nTrucy:\nHee hee! I got them from a detective friend of mine.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I'd like to help you with your investigation! Can I borrow your forensicking kit?\nPhoenix:\nI feel bad making you work when you're supposed to be here having fun.\nPearl:\nI don't mind. And I'd like to see Rifle again, too.\nApollo:\nIf you have anything for me to do, I'd like to help, too.\nPhoenix:\nYeah? Thanks. I'll be sure to ask you if anything comes up, then.\nApollo:\nWell, I'll be right here... hanging around watering Charley... if you think of anything!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha. I appreciate that, Apollo. (I've got some good kids, here.) All right, team, let's do our best! I have faith we can save Sasha all together.\nAthena:\nIt sure feels nice to be part of a great group like this! I just want to say that I really love working here, with all of you fabulous people. Thank you for bringing me aboard, Boss!\nPhoenix:\nS-Same here, Athena. (She's so earnest, she's making me blush.)\nAthena:\nOkay! Let's all run over to the aquarium!\nPearl:\nI hope I can be of some use with the forensicking kit!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey, wait up, you two! (They left without me...)\nJuly 21Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool\nFulbright:\nIn justice we trust! Good timing! We're done with the crime scene for now... ...and we're just about to examine the show stage. Marlon Rimes helped with the cleaning, so we've got to go talk with him.\nPhoenix:\n(...I thought he'd be more tight-lipped than this, but hey...)\nFulbright:\nYou're welcome to look around here now, if you'd like!\nPhoenix:\nThank you. I think we'll do just that.\nFulbright:\nOh, by the way... If you want to examine the bottom of the pool... ...I recommend using that hoist over by the ladder to get down there.\nPhoenix:\n(That crane-like thing hanging from the ceiling, right? Got it.)\nFulbright:\nJust stand on the ladder platform, and the police guard will operate it for you.\nPhoenix:\nThanks. (Why couldn't the pool be less deep...?)\nFulbright:\nWell, good luck to us both! In justice we trust!\nAthena:\nNow that Detective Fulbright's gone, we can do anything we want here!\nPhoenix:\nThe guard is still here, so keep your voice down when you say stuff like that, Athena...\nExamine\nPirate flag\nAthena:\nSo Orla pulled this pirate flag and made the stuff fall down, huh?\nPhoenix:\nHey. Doesn't this pirate flag look like a transport stretcher to you? And judging by the size, it's probably for Orla.\nAthena:\nHey, you're right. There are holes for her flippers, too.\nPhoenix:\nBut that pirate flag design... Mr. Shipley sure was into the whole \"pirate\" thing.\nAthena:\nWe need to get serious about the whole \"lawyer\" thing, too. We can't let Prosecutor Blackquill outdo us!\nPool\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like the water was drained for the police investigation. It seems kind of... sad, somehow, without the water.\nAthena:\nWhen something that was there before is suddenly gone, it has a psychological effect. Like, for example, if all the magic props in the office were suddenly put away neatly.\nPhoenix:\nI don't think that's ever gonna happen as long as Trucy continues to practice magic.\nAthena:\nWell, she might not always be interested in magic, you know. She's at the age when young women start to worry about their future. The same thing happened to me, and I ended up becoming a lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm pretty sure Trucy will always be interested in magic.)\nOctopus\nAthena:\nOne of the giant octopus's legs has been broken off.\nPhoenix:\nOrla's spikes sure can do a lot of damage. Mr. Shipley must've been really strong to be able to return those hits.\nAthena:\nI'm pretty amazing, myself, when it comes to strength! I run every day, and I go mountain climbing, too! I bet I could return Orla's spike... Well, I'll be able to someday, anyway!\nPhoenix:\nDo you really have to turn every little thing into a competition?\nHoist\nAthena:\nYesterday, I asked around about this orca pool room, you know. They said that this hoist is used to move equipment and even Orla herself.\nPhoenix:\nHow do they move Orla?\nAthena:\nHee hee! I thought you'd ask that! Apparently, they use a stretcher made especially for an orca.\nPhoenix:\n...Well, what do you know. (Athena looks pleased with herself.)\nDoor\nPhoenix:\nOnly the victim and Sasha had security cards for this door. And Sasha was the only one who had entered the room up until the time of discovery.\nAthena:\nHmm... It won't be easy, but we can do this! Kein Problem! Sasha was devastated by Mr. Shipley's death. That means the true culprit has to be somebody else. So, chin up, Boss! Onward and upward!\nPhoenix:\n(As the boss, shouldn't I be the one giving her a pep talk?)\nOutline\nAthena:\nThe victim fell to his death and was kept down at the bottom of the pool. But Orla brought him up to the edge of the pool with her lifesaver trick.\nPhoenix:\nI wonder if Orla was actually trying to save him? I'm convinced she knocked down the equipment to call for help, too.\nAthena:\nYeah, I bet that's what really happened. Because she loved him...\nLadder\nPhoenix:\n(Let's use the hoist to go down to the bottom of the pool...)\nOrla\nPhoenix:\nThis must be Orla's bedroom. There's even a sofa and everything.\nAthena:\nOrla! Congratulations on your \"not guilty\" verdict! But... we have bad news... Now Sasha has been arrested instead.\nOrla:\nFweeeeet...\nPhoenix:\nOrla seems sad.\nAthena:\nI'm sure she is. I can sense the sadness filling her heart. Don't worry, Orla! We'll save Sasha!\nOrla:\nFweet, fweet!\nAthena:\nI think Orla's wishing us good luck!\nPhoenix:\nOrla really seems to understand what we're saying.\nAthena:\nShe can't understand our words, but I bet she can understand our hearts.\nTreasure\nAthena:\nWow! Look at all that treasure! Those jewels and that crown are huge!\nPhoenix:\nThey sure are. I guess everything is size \"large\" around here.\nAthena:\nNo, everything is size \"Orla.\"\nPhoenix:\n(I stand corrected.)\nSkull rock, compass, or map\nAthena:\nA map, a compass... and a spooky, skull-shaped rock! Orla's room is filled with pirate pizzazz!\nPhoenix:\nBut that skull rock seems out of place. It doesn't go with the other things...\nAthena:\nYeah, it does seem pretty weird to have a big skull rock next to your desk...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe Sasha wasn't finished arranging the set?\nAthena:\nWhen it comes to Orla, Sasha doesn't seem like the type to leave something half done... Her state of mind when she put it there... That could be the key to this mystery! And I bet it's a mystery I can solve!\nPhoenix:\nNever mind that mystery. Let's get back to the investigation.\nLantern\nAthena:\nThey called this the \"Captain's Cabin\" on TV! Every night, by the light of the lantern, Orla pores over her treasures.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Sounds more like a miserly housewife going over the family finances...\nAfter examining Orla and treasure:\nPearl:\nIs this a good time to get started, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Started with what?\nPearl:\nThis is the crime scene, right? So this should be the perfect place to start forensicking!\nPhoenix:\n(She wants to use the forensics kit so badly, she's practically beaming.) Okay, let's do it. Forensicking, it is!\nPearl:\nHooray! I get to help!\nPhoenix:\nAll right. We'll need these...\nAthena:\nUm... what's with the glasses, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt's not like they're a fashion statement! We need them to see if there's any blood! All right, Pearls. You spray the luminol wherever I need it, okay?\nPearl:\nGot it, Mr. Nick! I won't miss an inch!\nPhoenix:\nGot your glasses on, everybody...? Good. Now to check out the bottom of the pool.\nSpray Orla\nPearl:\nOh no! I'm so sorry! I got some on Orla by mistake!\nAthena:\nCalm down, Pearly! It's okay!\nPhoenix:\nLook! There are luminol reactions on Orla, too.\nAthena:\nThe poor thing was bleeding yesterday... The luminol must be showing her injuries.\nPhoenix:\nBut wait a minute. Ms. DePlume said the blood disappeared when Orla put on her hat.\nAthena:\nHuh? So shouldn't her injuries be under her hat?\nPhoenix:\n(If this blood isn't from Orla's injuries, then what could it be?)\nSpray Orla (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThere are luminol reactions on Orla, too.\nAthena:\nThe poor thing was bleeding yesterday... The luminol must be showing her injuries.\nPhoenix:\nBut wait a minute. Ms. DePlume said the blood disappeared when Orla put on her hat.\nAthena:\nHuh? So shouldn't her injuries be under her hat?\nPhoenix:\n(If this blood isn't from Orla's injuries, then what could it be?)\nSpray skull rock\nPearl:\nLook! I see something!\nAthena:\nIf your deductions are correct, Boss, I guess this luminol reaction means... ...that the victim hit this skull-shaped rock when he fell to his death...\nPhoenix:\nI guess so.\nSkull Rock added to the Court Record.\nSpray skull rock (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nIf your deductions are correct, Boss, I guess this luminol reaction means... ...that the victim hit this skull-shaped rock when he fell to his death...\nPhoenix:\nI guess so. The luminol doesn't lie, after all.\nAfter spraying Orla and skull rock:\nPhoenix:\nI guess that's about it for inside the pool.\nAthena:\nThen let me just get a quick photo to remember the occasion by! It's not every day we get to see the bottom of an aquarium pool! Yeah! That's a good shot!\nPearl:\nI'll mark where the luminol reactions were.\nAthena:\nYay! My first collaborative work with Pearly!\nPool Bottom Photo added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? I hear something...)\nOrla:\nFweet............\nAthena:\nOrla...? Boss! Something's wrong with Orla!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! You're right! She's listless... and she's sinking!\nPearl:\nOh no! Maybe it's because of that luminol I got on her! Wh-What do we do, Mr. Nick?!\nPhoenix:\nWe can't do anything for her ourselves! Let's get Dr. Crab!\nAthena:\nI'll run and get him!\nCrab:\nWhat's Orla's condition?!\nPhoenix:\nShe's listless and sinking! Maybe she's unconscious?\nCrab:\nThe pool is drained. Son of a gun! Who did this?! She'll drown unless we do something. ...Here. Give me a hand.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Us?\nCrab:\nNo, I meant the Steel Samurai. Of course you! Just help me!\nAthena:\nWhat...? A-All right! What do you want us to do?\nCrab:\nThere's no time to fill the pool to get her up to the top. Get the orca stretcher! It's a piece of black cloth with a skull and crossbones on it. Looks like a pirate flag. When the stretcher is ready, press the hoist button!\nPhoenix:\nOkay! We're on it!\nExamine\nPirate flag\nPhoenix:\nSo this pirate flag is a stretcher for the orca, huh?!\nAthena:\nWe can't use it with all this stuff on it! Let's clear it off!\nCrab:\nGood! Now push the hoist button and lower the stretcher! The control panel is on the wall to your right!\nControl panel (after examining pirate flag)\nLeads to:\n\"Ah! This must be the button to move the hoist...!\"\nTalk\nOrla's condition\nCrab:\nNo time for chit-chat! Get going on that stretcher! Both Orla's right- and left-brain hemispheres are completely asleep now! She'll drown if we don't do something!\nPhoenix:\nWhat does the stretcher look like again?\nCrab:\nIt's a piece of black cloth with a skull and crossbones on it. Looks like a pirate flag. Once the stretcher is ready, press the button on the control panel to move the hoist! And hurry! I have to get back to prepping her!\nPhoenix:\nAh! This must be the button to move the hoist...!\nPhoenix:\nDr. Crab! The stretcher is ready!\nCrab:\nGood! Let's get it under Orla!\nCrab:\nI'll take it from here. Stand back. I have to treat her immediately... Hmm... There's something in her stomach...\nCrab:\nThere. I got it all out.\nAthena:\nWill Orla be all right, Dr. Crab?!\nCrab:\nYes, she'll be fine. She's just sleeping now. Orcas are mammals, so they won't die if they're out of the water for a little while. But their own weight puts stress on their organs, and their skin starts to dry out. I put some of my special handmade cream on her skin as an emergency measure.\nAthena:\nFeel better soon, Orla...\nPearl:\nOh, if only I hadn't gotten that luminol on her...!\nCrab:\nLuminol? Nah, no problem there. That stuff just washes right off. Orla's condition has nothing to do with you, young lady.\nPearl:\nReally? Then what is wrong with Orla?\nCrab:\nI don't need to share that information with you people! It's none of your business. ...I have to get back to my rounds, so I'll leave the rest to the crew. Please keep an eye on Orla while I rouse up some crew members.\nPhoenix:\n(Dr. Crab sure is acting funny... He seems to be hiding something... Maybe we should check on Orla's condition before the staff get here.)\nExamine\nLadder\nPhoenix:\n(I guess we don't need to examine the bottom of the pool again.)\nControl panel\nPhoenix:\n(This is the button we used to raise Orla in the stretcher. There's no need to push it now.)\nOrla\nAthena:\nOrla! Open your eyes!\nPhoenix:\nI know how you feel, Athena, but we'd better let Orla rest right now.\nAthena:\nHow did this happen? Mr. Wright! We have to examine her ourselves, right now!\nPhoenix:\nI wish we could, but we're lawyers, remember?\nAthena:\nBut there must be something we can do!\nPhoenix:\nWell, we can investigate the cause of her condition. (Didn't we have evidence that might tell us something about the cause...?)\nHats\nPhoenix:\nLook at all those pirate hats! Orla must really love those things.\nAthena:\nThe pirate hat, the star above her eye, and her white mustache are her trademarks! Without those things, she'd look just like any other orca.\nPhoenix:\nEven with a hat, she still looks like any other orca to me...\nAthena:\nI bet no ordinary orca could do that lifesaver trick! Hmph! How could you lump Orla in with all the other orcas like that, Mr. Wright?!\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. I forgot how much of a fan Athena is.)\nWanted poster\nAthena:\nHey, there's a poster of Mr. Rimes here.\nPhoenix:\n\"Wanted,\" huh? Very piratey. Looks like they list the staff's likes and nicknames and other stats, too.\nAthena:\nAnd there's a reward amount listed, too.\nPhoenix:\nA reward?\nAthena:\nYeah, they have this special event where they give you a prize for tagging a staff member. The bigger the reward listed, the better the prize. The crew tries hard not to get tagged... Sounds like my type of event! I would totally DOMINATE in a game like that!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh. Her competitive fire is starting to blaze out of control.)\nExtracted fish\nLeads to:\n\"We should check out the contents of Orla's stomach... I guess...\"\nPhoenix:\nWe should check out the contents of Orla's stomach... I guess... Hey, I see something mixed in with the fish.\nAthena:\nIt looks like a medicine capsule. There's something written on it. I think it says... \"3 Zs\"... What would it be doing in Orla's stomach?\nMysterious Capsule added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nI wonder what kind of medicine it is? Let's ask Dr. Crab. It might have something to do with Orla's condition!\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe we'd better not ask. He must've noticed it himself, yet he didn't mention it. I think he's hiding something about Orla's condition. If we show him the capsule, he might try to take it away from us.\nAthena:\nYeah, I guess he was acting pretty sketchy. Okay, let's look into it ourselves, then.\nPhoenix:\nGood idea. When we get back to the office, we can ask for Apollo's help.\nAthena:\nI guess that wraps up our investigation here. Orla still isn't fully awake yet... Oh, here comes some staff! Looks like they're going to put Orla back into the pool.\nPhoenix:\nAnd I guess they're going to fill the pool back up. I bet that will take a while... Well, I guess we can leave Orla in the staff's capable hands now.\nAthena:\n...Right! So, where to now?!\nPhoenix:\nLet's head to the show stage next. If we're lucky, the police will be done with the place.\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nWe're starting to get quite a bit of evidence. I still can't figure out who the culprit is, though...\nAthena:\nMaybe we should look for information in other places besides the crime scene! Investigating is key, but questioning people is vital, too! I know! Let's make it a competition to see which of us can find the best evidence! The loser buys the winner a glass of OJ!\nPhoenix:\nAll right. Fine. (Whatever.)\nAny ideas?\nAthena:\nWhy are the Swashbuckler Spectacular songs Ms. DePlume and I know different? I get the feeling it has something to do with this case...\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Why would there be two songs...? It must mean something...\nAthena:\nI hate it when I don't know the answer! I'm going to go for a little run to let off steam!\nPhoenix:\nAthena, wait! Better not. You might forget what made you want to let off steam in the first place.\nPresent\nMysterious Capsule\nAthena:\nThat's the capsule from Orla's stomach, isn't it? It says \"3 Zs\" on it. I wonder what this drug does?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know, but maybe it had something to do with Orla's mysterious condition.\nAthena:\nWho would do such a thing to Orla?! If I get my hands on them, I'll... I'll rip them to shreds, that's what I'll do!!\nPhoenix:\nLet's just stick to lawful acts, shall we?\nWright Anything Agency (after examining extracted fish in Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool)\nTalk\nThe investigation\nPhoenix:\nWould you like to help out with the investigation, Apollo?\nApollo:\nYou bet I would! What do you want me to work on?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. Let's see... Do I actually have anything for him to do...?)\nApollo:\nOkay... And it's suddenly crickets...\nAthena:\nOh, I know, Boss! Let's have Apollo look at the evidence we collected!\nPhoenix:\nOh, good idea. He might notice something that will help us win the case.\nPresent\nMysterious Capsule\nPhoenix:\nApollo, there's something I'd like your help with.\nApollo:\nYou have work for me?! What is it?\nPhoenix:\nCould you have this capsule checked out? I think it's some kind of medicine.\nApollo:\nSure thing, Mr. Wright! I'll go to a hospital or something and have somebody take a look. Let's see... I'm pretty sure the closest one is Hickfield Clinic.\nPhoenix:\nGood luck, Apollo. And thanks. I guess we should head back to the aquarium and check out the show stage.\nJuly 21Shipshape Aquarium - Show Stage\nPhoenix:\n(So this is where they hold the Swashbuckler Spectacular, huh... Looks like the police are done with their work here.)\nRimes:\nHey! It's you lawyers! How could ya let Sasha get arrested?! Didn't I ask ya to take care of her?!\nPhoenix:\nWe're sorry we couldn't prevent her from getting arrested... ...but, as her lawyers, we'll do everything we can for her.\nRimes:\n............ Sorry I got upset... If there's anythin' I can do to help Sasha, just say the word.\nPearl:\nMarlon, you can trust in Mr. Nick. I'm going to do what I can, too, with this forensicking kit! I'm going to cover this whole area with forensicking!\nRimes:\nThatta girl, Small Fry! You can have free rein of this place!\nPhoenix:\n(I want to check this place out, but I'd better talk to Mr. Rimes, too.)\nExamine\nSkeleton\nAthena:\nEeeeek! There's a skeleton adrift!\nPhoenix:\n!\nAthena:\nHeh heh. It's just a prop. Were you really scared?\nPhoenix:\nA little bit... (...by your screaming.) Is this skeleton an enemy defeated by Orla's pirates?\nAthena:\nNo, he's an informant named The Skeleton Kid. A dashing, spirited character, neither friend nor foe!\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying he's alive in the show?\nPirate ship\nPhoenix:\nThis galleon was in the Swashbuckler Spectacular, too, wasn't it?\nAthena:\nLook at that cute figurehead! It looks just like Orla!\nPhoenix:\nIt is cute, but it looks like it's also a cannon.\nAthena:\nThe enemy lets their guard down and then, blam! Very piratey, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nI thought Orla and Sasha were supposed to be the good guys?\nAthena:\nWe should do the same thing in court! Lure 'em in and then, blam! Present evidence!\nPhoenix:\nI don't think the judge would appreciate any \"blamming\" in his court.\nWater\nAthena:\nLook at this pool! It's huge! So this is where they do the Swashbuckler Spectacular.\nRimes:\nThis show pool is the same depth as the orca pool. They practice the tricks in the orca pool, and then do the real show here. Are ya interested in the Swashbuckler Spectacular?\nAthena:\nOh, of course! I've only seen it on TV, though.\nRimes:\nWell, I'm new here, so I've never even seen it once.\nPhoenix:\nAthena is a big fan. She watches the recording over and over.\nAthena:\nI love the show and the ocean! Standing here makes me feel like I'm at the beach!\nPhoenix:\nEspecially with it open to the sky. You can even hear the sound of the surf nearby. Why don't you take a dip in the pool?\nAthena:\nReally?! I can?! In that case...\nRimes:\nWhat?! What are ya talkin' about?! You can't swim here!\nPhoenix:\nWe were just joking.\nAthena:\nRight...... O-Of course! I was just joking, too!\nPhoenix:\n(Don't tell me she was actually going to do it...)\nLadder\nPhoenix:\nThis ladder only goes down to the surface of the water.\nAthena:\nWell, it's not like a public pool. Everybody who gets into this pool knows how to swim. Just like in the courtroom! It's sink or swim in there! A newbie could really get hurt. You know, like last time in court... I could've really gotten injured. I was an inch away from getting attacked by a witness.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... A trial with Apollo can be a pretty dangerous affair...)\nHoist\nPhoenix:\nWe saw this same device in the orca pool room, too, huh?\nAthena:\nYeah, we used it to lift Orla when she was on the stretcher. In the show, Sasha makes her grand entrance by hanging from this thing! Ooh! We should think of a cool, grand entrance for us, too!\nPhoenix:\nI've always wanted to burst into the middle of somebody else's trial with a loud bang!\nAthena:\nI've always wanted to crash in through the ceiling! I bet that would really knock the socks off the judge and the gallery!\nPhoenix:\n(Just what exactly was this girl learning while she was in Europe?)\nSign\nPhoenix:\nThis colorful sign... Did Ms. Buckler make it? (Changed from [This colorful sign... Did Ms. Bucker [sic] make it?] in the original release)\nRimes:\nWow! How did ya know? Yeah, that sign is for the new show. Before she went to clean, she painted it and left it to dry. She told me to keep an eye on it while I was takin' care of the orca.\nAthena:\nHuh? Isn't that the skull rock there on the right?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Rimes, is the skull rock a part of the set for the new show?\nRimes:\nYeah, I guess so.\nPhoenix:\n(If they were going to use it in the show, what's it doing in the orca pool?)\nSkull Rock updated in the Court Record.\nAthena:\nThis sign is so eye-catching, with all those twinkling stars!\nRimes:\nI think they're supposed to be starfish. It's for the pirate show, after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... A few of them look more like leaves to me...)\nHandmade Sign added to the Court Record.\nRimes:\nSasha put so much effort into makin' this sign for the new show... No wonder she was mad about what happened...\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? I wonder what he's talking about? I'd better ask...\nSign (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis colorful sign... Did Ms. Buckler make it?

No wonder she was mad about what happened...\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? I wonder what he's talking about? I'd better ask...\nAfter examining water and sign:\nPhoenix:\n(We've examined pretty much everything here, but...)\nTalk\nHelping with cleaning\nPhoenix:\nI hear you helped Sasha with the cleaning, Mr. Rimes.\nRimes:\nWell, not really \"helped.\" I was just takin' care of the orca here while she cleaned. Sasha felt bad for making Orla stay up so late, so she asked me to give her a snack. It was a little bit less than her ordinary meals, but she seemed satisfied. Oh, yeah. And I put Orla on the transport stretcher, too.\nPhoenix:\nTransport stretcher?\nRimes:\nSee that hoist up there on the right? The stretcher can be suspended from it. This stage show is right next to the orca pool room... ...and we use the hoist to move the orca or cargo between the two areas.\nPhoenix:\nSo the rail we saw in the orca pool room runs all the way here, huh?\nRimes:\nWhy? Did ya wanna take a ride?\nAthena:\nAerial investigation, huh? Sounds good to me!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no. That's okay. (I like my investigations on sweet terra firma.)\nRimes:\nActually, the hoist can only be operated from the orca pool room.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, that's right. I remember seeing the hoist control panel in there...)\nRimes:\nSo, I'm sorry, but I can't give ya a ride without somebody on the other end.\nPhoenix:\nNo need to be sorry. (Whew... Dodged that bullet...)\nAbout the murder\nAthena:\nIf it wasn't Ms. Buckler or Orla... who else could've killed Mr. Shipley?\nRimes:\nWell, I know Sasha is innocent, but I'm not so sure about the orca...\nPhoenix:\nWhat? But we proved her innocence in court this morning.\nRimes:\nBut a few days ago, that orca attacked Sasha right here in the show pool! I saw that orca take Sasha's body into her mouth and squeeze her chest!\nPhoenix:\n(Her chest...?)\nAthena:\nThey were probably practicing the lifesaver trick.\nRimes:\nBut Sasha was being crushed so bad, she couldn't even blow the whistle. I wanted to help her right away, but... I hate to admit it, but I froze. I... I'm a weak man. I can't protect anyone...\nPhoenix:\nI doubt there are many people who would pit themselves against an orca.\nRimes:\nEverybody tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn't give up on practicin'. When we said Orla could kill her, she said she trusted Orla!\nAthena:\nYeah... While everybody else seems to think Orla is a killer...\nRimes:\nHow can ya trust a creature that can't speak? You can't even know what it's thinkin'.\nAthena:\nBut with orcas and dolphins, you can have communication of the heart.\nThe new show (appears after examining sign)\nPhoenix:\nYou say Ms. Buckler was mad... Was it because of the new show?\nRimes:\nUgh... Me and my big mouth. Okay, but ya never heard it from me! There was a rumor that the captain wasn't gonna let Sasha be in the new show.\nAthena:\nWhaaaaaaat?! But why not?!\nRimes:\nI dunno. It was just a rumor. I don't know if it was true...\nPhoenix:\nSo Mr. Shipley was going to do the show all by himself?\nSwashbuckler Flyer updated in the Court Record.\nAthena:\nI can't even imagine the show without Ms. Buckler! It would be like, \"Where's the beef?\"\nPhoenix:\n(Is she trying to say it would be like bones without any meat on them...?)\nRimes:\nSasha wanted to go back to the old Swashbuckler Spectacular. But now that the captain's gone... who knows what's gonna happen with the show...\nThe new show (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou say Ms. Buckler was mad... Was it because of the new show?\nRimes:\nUgh... Me and my big mouth. Okay, but ya never heard it from me! There was a rumor that the captain wasn't gonna let Sasha be in the new show.\nAthena:\nWhaaaaaaat?! But why not?!\nRimes:\nI dunno. It was just a rumor. I don't know if it was true...\nPhoenix:\nSo Mr. Shipley was going to do the show all by himself?\nAthena:\nI can't even imagine the show without Ms. Buckler! It would be like, \"Where's the beef?\"\nPhoenix:\n(Is she trying to say it would be like bones without any meat on them...?)\nRimes:\nSasha wanted to go back to the old Swashbuckler Spectacular. But now that the captain's gone... who knows what's gonna happen with the show...\nPresent\nCalendar\nRimes:\nThat's Sasha's calendar. ...Sorry I didn't tell ya sooner.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess you were worried about Ms. Buckler. It's understandable.\nRimes:\nI dunno why she was supposed to meet with the captain... ...but I know she definitely didn't kill him. She'd never do anythin' like that.\nAthena:\nWe know that. And we're going to prove it in court!\nRimes:\nIf ya mess up, I'm gonna write a rap dissin' you two! And even before it comes out on CD, I'm gonna play it all over the place!\nPhoenix:\n...What does \"dissing\" mean?\nAthena:\nTo \"diss\" somebody means to insult them or put them down. It's short for \"disrespect.\"\nPhoenix:\n...Ouch. That's harsh.\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining water:\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I found some peculiar fingerprints.\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls! I almost forgot she's been \"forensicking\" for me all this time.)\nPearl:\nOh! Who's that?\nPhoenix:\nProsecutor Blackquill! What are you doing here?!\nBlackquill:\n............Just some business to attend to.\nFulbright:\nProsecutor Blackquill insisted, so I brought him along to get a little exercise.\nAthena:\nIs it business with us...?\nBlackquill:\n...No, not you. My business is with that animal keeper there. Marlon Rimes... You will be a witness for the prosecution tomorrow.\nRimes:\nYa gotta be kiddin'! Why would I wanna testify against Sasha?!\nBlackquill:\nWhat you \"want\" does not matter. ...Now, come along.\nRimes:\nBut if I leave, who's gonna feed the orca? The other animal keepers are too scared to go near her now.\nPearl:\nUm, maybe I can help? I'm concerned about Orla's health... and this way, I can stay close and look after her. I can feed her and do a telecast, too, if you need me to! I'll do anything to help!\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like Pearls wants to do something nice for Orla and make sure she's okay.)\nRimes:\nSmall Fry! Are you trippin'? That orca is... dangerous, ya know.\nPearl:\nHee hee. I'll be fine. I'm just happy to help. Oh! But I don't have a TV phone... I won't be able to contact you if I have to do a telecast... Marlon, may I please borrow yours?\nRimes:\nWhat? ...Sure, Small Fry. Anythin' for you! Especially when you're goin' out of your way to help like this. I dunno if I'm gonna testify, but I guess I can at least hear what the police have to say.\nFulbright:\nThanks for your cooperation! Now, justice will be served... with a strategy meeting!\nAthena:\nGrrr! C'mon, Mr. Wright! Let's get back to our investigation!\nBlackquill:\n............Hmph. How sad. The police have already investigated all there is to investigate. Your efforts are a waste of time.\nPhoenix:\nNothing we do to try and save our client is a waste of time, Prosecutor Blackquill.\nBlackquill:\nToday, the orca. Tomorrow, Sasha Buckler. You intend to save them both? Hmph. You say you \"believe\" in your clients, but isn't money really your true motivation? Why not admit you're only doing this for your own benefit? I could understand that much more readily than your empty, righteous talk.\nAthena:\nOur own benefit?! That's not why we're doing it!\nPhoenix:\nNow, Athena. Try not to let him get to you.\nFulbright:\nAll right! We should be off, Prosecutor Blackquill! In justice we trust!\nAthena:\nGrrr! I've never been so insulted! Be right back! I need some water to wash away the anger.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh. She hit Prosecutor Blackquill with that water... He doesn't seem to care, though.)\nPearl:\nHmm... I guess prosecutors these days are more about harsh monochrome than fancy frills...\nPhoenix:\nOh, wait! What about those peculiar fingerprints you said you found, Pearls?\nPearl:\nHee hee. I'll tell you all about them!\nExamine\nWater\nAthena:\nWow! This pool is about the same size as the orca pool! This is where they do the Swashbuckler Spectacular.\nPhoenix:\nYou're a big fan, aren't you, Athena? You watch that recording every chance you get.\nAthena:\nI get so excited watching the pirates do battle! It makes me want to put just as much passion into our battles in court!\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I like to hear.\nAthena:\nMaybe I should get a pirate outfit to wear in the courtroom?\nPhoenix:\nI don't think you have to go quite that far.\nSign\nPhoenix:\nThis colorful sign... So Sasha was the one who made it, right?\nAthena:\nYup. Before she went to clean, she apparently painted it and left it to dry. There's a picture of that skull rock for the new show on the right.\nPhoenix:\n(If they were going to use it in the show, what's it doing in the orca pool?)\nAthena:\nIt's really eye-catching, with all those twinkling starfish!\nPhoenix:\nI don't think you can say \"twinkling\" when you're talking about starfish... Besides, a few of them look more like leaves to me.\nAthena:\nOh, you're right. Maybe Sasha forgot to finish painting them?\nTalk\nPeculiar prints\nLeads to:\n\"So tell me about this big discovery you made.\"\nPhoenix:\nSo tell me about this big discovery you made.\nPearl:\nWell, I don't know if it's a \"big\" discovery, but... ...I found some odd fingerprints on the pool ladder over there.\nPhoenix:\nOkay... So what's so peculiar about them?\nPearl:\nWell, they're on the left side of the ladder, but they're right-hand prints. Wouldn't a person usually hold the left side of a ladder with their left hand? Plus, I think they were made from above by grasping the ladder with the right hand.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Now that you mention it, that IS strange. I wonder whose prints they are?\nPearl:\nI compared them with the prints on file, and they turned out to be Marlon's.\nPhoenix:\n(How did he manage to leave prints in such an awkward position?)\nPearl:\nSo, Mr. Nick, was I helpful?\nPhoenix:\nYes, you were. Thank you very much, Pearls. (I don't know if they're related to the case yet, but I'll keep them in mind...)\nLadder Prints added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nHee hee. I bet Detective Fulbright doesn't know about these prints! I imagine their search wasn't as thorough here as it was at the crime scene.\nPhoenix:\nYou're probably right. I'm sure they checked everything at the actual crime scene. But I guess they can't do forensics on every inch of the rest of the aquarium.\nAthena:\nBut we could, thanks to Pearly! And now we have a new piece of information!\nPearl:\nOoh, you're embarrassing me, Athena!\nRifle:\n*kree!*\nAthena:\nHey, it's Rifle! We've got to catch her!\nPearl:\nDon't worry. She's being a good girl right here on my lap.\nPhoenix:\nHa ha! Well, I'm glad she's been found. (I forgot we were looking for her, actually.)\nAthena:\n............ Yeah, thanks again to Pearly...\nPhoenix:\n(I think somebody's jealous...)\nPearl:\nWell, I think I'll go talk to the staff about Orla.\nPhoenix:\nAll right. Good luck, Pearls! And thanks again!\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess we're done with things here. What do you want to do next?\nIf Mysterious Capsule was presented in Wright Anything Agency\nAthena:\nThey ought to be done with Sasha by now, too.\nPhoenix:\nTrue. Let's stop by the detention center and let her know we can take on her defense.\nLeads to:\n\"July 21Detention Center - Visitor's Room\"\nIf Mysterious Capsule was not presented in Wright Anything Agency\nAthena:\nHow about if we have Apollo check out our mystery evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, that's right. We haven't done that yet.) Good idea. Let's stop by the office.\nJuly 21Wright Anything Agency\nApollo:\nOh, you're back! How is the investigation going?\nPhoenix:\nIt's going pretty well, but there are still things we need answers to.\nApollo:\nLet me know if there's anything I can do to help!\nAfter presenting Mysterious Capsule:\nAthena:\nI wonder if they'll let us see Sasha now?\nPhoenix:\nIt has been quite a while. Let's stop by the detention center and see. We have something to deliver to her, too, don't forget.\nLeads to:\n\"July 21Detention Center - Visitor's Room\"\nJuly 21Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nAthena:\nAll right, Boss! Chin up! We have to lift Sasha's spirits!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha! I like your enthusiasm!\nBuckler:\nAhoy there, me hearties! Thank ye for comin'! Arr! I be in good spirits! Worry not about me!\nAthena:\n............She's trying to cheer us up.\nBuckler:\nWell, that went over like a lead balloon... I was trying to make up for all your trouble.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe the two of you need to take it easy. (I guess they both had the same idea.)\nAthena:\nWe came to let you know that we can take on your defense, if you'll have us!\nBuckler:\nWHAAAAAAAAAT?! ............!\nPhoenix:\nI-Is something wrong? (Why is she hiding from us?)\nBuckler:\nP-Prosecutor Blackquill said... ...th-that you two would... abandon me... But here you are... t-to my rescue...! That's why... I-I'm so happy...!\nPhoenix:\n(It sounds like she's crying back there.)\nAthena:\nO-Of course we wouldn't abandon you...! Uuuuuugh... Sasha...! Don't cry!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe the two of you need to take it easy. (Great, now I've got crying in stereo...) (Changed from [Maybe the two of you need to take it easy. (Great, now I have crybabies in stereo...)] in the original release)\nBuckler:\nOkay! I'm all right now! Thank you for taking on my case!\nAthena:\nWe're glad to do it!\nPhoenix:\nWell, now that you're smiling again, we have a few questions to ask you.\nTalk\nAbout the murder\nPhoenix:\nOn the night before the murder, did you enter the orca pool room alone?\nBuckler:\nThat's right. On July 20th, from 3:00 to 6:00 AM, I was there cleaning and organizing. The captain and I were actually supposed to clean together starting at 4:00 AM, but... ...we got in a fight. I couldn't face him, so I went an hour early and started cleaning.\nAthena:\nWhat does the orca pool room cleaning involve?\nBuckler:\nWell, first we have to move Orla to the show stage pool before we get started.\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Rimes mentioned he took care of Orla in the show stage pool.)\nBuckler:\nAfter Orla was moved, I drained the pool and rearranged the equipment and props.\nPhoenix:\nAnd did the captain ever show up?\nBuckler:\n4:00 AM came and went, but he never showed. I bet he was mad at me... I wish I'd apologized to him, instead of being all prickly and angry like a scorpionfish...\nOrla (before presenting Prescription Bag)\nAthena:\nI'm glad we could prove Orla's innocence, but we didn't know you would get arrested.\nBuckler:\nHa ha ha. As long as Orla is safe, I'm happy. I'm so glad I found you two! You guys are the best!\nAthena:\nI'm glad you found us, too! YOU'RE the best, Sasha!\nBuckler:\nI never imagined Orla's tricks would ever be used to commit a crime...\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell us more about the lifesaver trick?\nBuckler:\nYeah, sure! There's a little speaker on the captain's clothes and on the training dummies. That speaker can emit sound waves. When a trick command is issued with the whistle... ...Orla uses the sound waves as a guide to find the person she's supposed to rescue.\nPhoenix:\nI see. Does anybody else know about how that trick works?\nBuckler:\nThe entire crew knows about it. But it takes quite a bit of practice to be able to command the lifesaver trick. It wouldn't be easy to do for anybody who wasn't a trainer.\nPhoenix:\n(And that's why they suspected Sasha...)\nBuckler:\nAnd Orla can only perform one trick per signal. In other words, she can't perform two tricks at a time.\nWhistle updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(Wait... So she can't do the singing trick and the lifesaver trick at the same time...? So what was that song Ms. DePlume heard?)\nAthena:\nOh, Mr. Wright! I just remembered! We have to return something to Sasha.\nPhoenix:\nOh, yeah. You're right. (I have it right here in evidence... And we have to give Sasha that item Detective Fulbright gave us, too.)\nOrla (before presenting Prescription Bag; subsequent times)\nAthena:\nI'm glad we could prove Orla's innocence, but we didn't know you would get arrested.\nBuckler:\nHa ha ha. As long as Orla is safe, I'm happy. I'm so glad I found you two! You guys are the best!\nAthena:\nI'm glad you found us, too!

So what was that song Ms. DePlume heard?)\nReason for the fight (appears after presenting Prescription Bag)\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you arguing with Mr. Shipley?\nBuckler:\nThe captain knew about my heart condition, and he was worried about me. So he said he wouldn't put me in the new show. See? I'm not in the new flyer.\nAthena:\nOh, you're right! It's just Orla and the new adversary, Redstache.\nBuckler:\nI was so upset and frustrated... I was still crying when I went to do the cleaning. And I cried for quite a while before I drained the pool, too. But then, you know what? Orla did a trick to try and cheer me up. She acted out the scene where she defeats the giant octopus by spiking a ball at it! She spiked that ball so hard, she even ended up breaking off one of the octopus's legs.\nPhoenix:\n...What a dramatic way to cheer up a friend.\nBuckler:\nSo that's why we argued, because he wasn't going to put me in the new show. But I was determined to be in the show yesterday. It was July 20th, you see... The anniversary of the death of the trainer before me... ...Azura Summers.\nPhoenix:\n...The person Norma DePlume wrote about in her book.\nBuckler:\nI wanted to explain to the audience that it was an accident, not murder. That's why I wanted... that's why I NEEDED to be in that show so bad... So during the cleaning, I moved the skull rock to the orca pool.\nAthena:\nWhat? But why?\nBuckler:\nIt was a key prop. I figured the new show couldn't go on without it. I thought they'd be forced to switch back to the old show.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... That was pretty extreme...)\nSkull Rock updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(So Sasha moved the skull rock to the orca pool at the time of the cleaning... And if there's blood on that rock... ...then that must mean that the victim's death occurred after the rock was moved.) Around what time did you finish up the cleaning?\nBuckler:\nIt was about 6:00 AM.\nPhoenix:\n(So that places suspicion on whoever met with the victim after 6:00 AM...)\nReason for the fight (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you arguing with Mr. Shipley?\nBuckler:\nThe captain knew about my heart condition, and he was worried about me.

She was a year older than me. She taught me all about how to command Orla.\nPhoenix:\n(I bet Azura and Sasha were like sisters to one another.)\nBuckler:\nShe was the one who taught me the signals for the singing and lifesaver tricks, too. After she died... I swore on this charm... I vowed to become a great trainer someday, just like Azura!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is that charm?\nBuckler:\nIt's a keepsake to remember Azura by. She always wore it. She told me once that she and her boyfriend had matching charms... I never found out who he was, so I couldn't give this one to him... I've had it ever since.\nPhoenix:\nYou're keeping the memory of Ms. Summers alive.\nBuckler:\nThe captain always carried around a memento of Azura, too: her walkie-talkie.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? Did the victim have a walkie-talkie on him? Maybe I should show Sasha the victim's photos and see what she has to say.)\nThe ship's doctor? (appears after \"Azura Summers\", then presenting Photo of the Body)\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you mean by \"protect Orla from the ship's doctor\"?\nBuckler:\nYou know, Herman Crab. Ever since the accident a year ago, he's been completely different. When Azura died, he said he was going to \"euthanize the orca\"! Before that, he always used to say that euthanizing animals was a despicable act!\nAthena:\nEuthanize the orca...? That's horrible...\nBuckler:\nThey all thought that Azura's death was the orca's fault. Nobody believed in her but me... The ship's doctor always keeps poison to euthanize the orca with on hand. And if Orca had been pronounced guilty in yesterday's trial, he would've used it!\nPhoenix:\nHe was going to put her down right away?\nBuckler:\nThat ship's doctor was close with both the captain and Azura, you know... I think he hates Orla...\nPresent\nCalendar\nPhoenix:\nThis is your calendar, isn't it, Sasha?\nBuckler:\nHuh? No, mine's at the aquarium.\nPhoenix:\nYeah? Mr. Rimes said he found this one in the nap room.\nBuckler:\nHuh. I didn't think anybody else at the aquarium used a calendar like that...\nPhoenix:\n(The owner of this calendar had a meeting scheduled with the victim. This mystery person might be the killer! We'd better find the calendar's owner...)\nCalendar updated in the Court Record.\nCalendar (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis is your calendar, isn't it, Sasha?\nBuckler:\nHuh? No, mine's at the aquarium.\nPhoenix:\nYeah? Mr. Rimes said he found this one in the nap room.\nBuckler:\nHuh. I didn't think anybody else at the aquarium used a calendar like that...\nPhoenix:\n(The owner of this calendar had a meeting scheduled with the victim. This mystery person might be the killer! We'd better find the calendar's owner...)\n\"The Killer Killer Whale\"\nBuckler:\nGrr! That lady! Do you know what kind of terrible things she wrote about Orla?!\nPhoenix:\nSo you knew about this book?\nBuckler:\nYeah. I wish I didn't, but all kinds of people kept showing it to me. I tell you, I've haddock enough of that woman and her book!\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, okay. I see what you did there...) So what do you think about what happened that day?\nBuckler:\n...It must've been some kind of accident. I believe in Orla's innocence.\nAthena:\nI can sense you really do believe in her, from the bottom of your heart. Well, we believe in her, too!\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. After all, she was proven \"not guilty\" in this case, too. We believe in the both of you.\nPrescription Bag\nPhoenix:\nDetective Fulbright asked us to give you this medicine.\nBuckler:\nArr! That bilge-suckin' blaggard had the spine to send me a gift?! Dread Pirate Nostache! Don't stand there gapin' like a weak li'l minnow! Have at ye!\nAthena:\nOoh, a real swashbuckling battle! ...Arr! If it be a fight ye want, a fight ye shall have!\nPhoenix:\nCould you two please not drop into show mode out of the blue?!\nBuckler:\nOkay, sorry about that. ...Yeah, I'll take that medicine.\nPhoenix:\n(She's acting kind of funny...) What is the medicine for, by the way?\nBuckler:\nUgh... Well, I guess I can't keep it a secret from you two... I... I suffer from a heart condition.\nAthena:\nA h-heart condition...? Then you'd better get to the hospital right away!\nPhoenix:\nTake it easy, Athena. She's in detention, remember?\nBuckler:\nDon't worry. it's not as serious as it sounds. They can fix it with surgery...\nAthena:\nNOT SERIOUS?! A heart condition is a heart condition! Don't tell us not to worry!\nBuckler:\nYeah, I'm sorry... The captain was just as mad at me the day before yesterday... We both got so worked up, at one point, it was like a shark-eat-shark situation.\nPhoenix:\n(Whew. That sounds scary...) Do you mind if I ask more about that fight?\nPrescription Bag (subsequent times)\nBuckler:\n! How did you...?\nPhoenix:\nDetective Fulbright gave it to us.\nBuckler:\nArr! That bilge-suckin' blaggard had the spine to send me a gift?!\nPhoenix:\nWhaaaaaaat?! S-Sasha...?\nBuckler:\nDread Pirate Nostache! Don't stand there gapin' like a weak li'l minnow! Have at ye!\nAthena:\nArr! If it be a fight ye want, a fight ye shall have!\nPhoenix:\nCould you two please not drop into show mode out of the blue?!\nBuckler:\nOops! Sorry about that. Now what were we talking about? Orla...?\nPhoenix:\n(...Hmm. I get the feeling Sasha was trying to divert the topic away from that medicine...)\nPhoto of the Body (after clearing \"Azura Summers\" Talk option)\nPhoenix:\nThe victim didn't appear to have a walkie-talkie with him at the time of his death.\nBuckler:\nHuh? But I talked to the captain on his walkie-talkie before I started the cleaning.\nPhoenix:\nBut there's no walkie-talkie shown in these crime scene photos.\nBuckler:\nI don't understand it... The captain always kept that walkie-talkie with him...\nAthena:\nMaybe the culprit took it away?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. Maybe... But what would be the point of that? I'd better organize the data I have on the victim in the Court Record...)\nShipley's Autopsy Report and Photo of the Body consolidated.\nBuckler:\nThe captain always kept that walkie-talkie by his side. It was the walkie-talkie Azura used right up until her death. In the middle of the show, the orca brought Azura up to the surface in her mouth. She left tooth marks in Azura's walkie-talkie... The captain said he always kept that walkie-talkie with him so he'd never forget...\nPhoenix:\n(So the walkie-talkie was really important to the victim...)\nBuckler:\nBut... now the captain is dead, too... I'm the only one left who can protect Orla from the ship's doctor!\nPhoenix:\n(Protect Orla from the ship's doctor? I wonder what Sasha means?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Calendar:\nPhoenix:\n(I guess we'd better look into Dr. Crab a little more.)\nAthena:\nBoss, let's go see Dr. Crab!\nPhoenix:\nI was just thinking the same thing. We have a lot of questions to ask him.\nBefore clearing all Talk options and presenting Calendar in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nJuly 21Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger\nAthena:\nDr. Crab! We found Rifle!\n............\nAthena:\nNo answer.\nPhoenix:\nI guess nobody's here. Why don't we come back later?\nJuly 21Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger\nPhoenix:\nOh, it's Pearls... and Rifle. What are you doing here?\nPearl:\nRifle came in here, so I followed her.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, that's right. We were supposed to deliver Rifle to him. I completely forgot.)\nPearl:\nOh! Rifle!\nGaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! What are you doing? Stop that!\nCrab:\nYou silly mother penguin! What if you injured my spectacular, genius brain?!\nPhoenix:\nD-Dr. Crab...? Are you all right?\nCrab:\nHuh? Oh. It's you people. I see you brought Rifle for me.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Rifle was really laying into you...\nCrab:\nWell, she hates me because she thinks I took her baby away from her.\nSniper:\nPeep!\nRifle:\n*kree!* *kree!* *kree, kree!*\nPhoenix:\n(Gee, Rifle looks so... happy... Is she actually playing with Sniper...?)\nRifle:\n*kree, kree, kree!* *kree, kree!* *kree, kree, kree!*\nCrab:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Stop all this cacophony!\nAthena:\nThe biological parent and the caregiver parent, locked in a struggle over the child...\nCrab:\n*panting* Do you think you could hold this silly mother penguin down for me?\nPearl:\nAll right! I will try!\nRifle:\n*kree*... *kree, kree!*\nPhoenix:\nUm, what are you doing? (I think Rifle just threw something up.)\nCrab:\nOh, I'm getting food for Sniper out of Rifle. Mother penguins stock up food for their babies in their stomachs. They break it down in there so that it's easier for the baby to eat.\nAthena:\nWow. You sure know a lot about animals.\nCrab:\n...You're trying to pick a fight with me again, aren't you, young lady? Yes, I know a lot about animals. I am a licensed veterinarian. Hmm... Rifle certainly is in a bad mood, even for her.\nTalk\nRifle's condition\nPhoenix:\nIs Rifle okay?\nCrab:\n...Hold on. I'm checking her now. Girl in the strange outfit... Could you turn Rifle over on her back, please?\nPearl:\nAll right. Rifle, I'm just going to turn you over, okay?\nCrab:\nHmm? What's this? The bottom of her feet are pink.\nAthena:\nOh, no! Wh-What kind of sickness is that?! We have to get her to a doctor!\nPhoenix:\nAthena, get a hold of yourself. Dr. Crab is a veterinarian, remember?\nCrab:\n...It's just something she stepped in, by the looks of it. It's her stomach that's the problem. There's still something in there... Here we go!\nRifle:\n*kree, kree*... *KREEEEEEE!*\nCrab:\n...Hmm. Looks like she swallowed something odd. I know this penguin will eat anything, but where did she pick up something like this? Son of a gun... I'll have to talk to Marlon about her care...\nAthena:\nDr. Crab, may we see what was in Rifle's stomach?\nCrab:\nHuh? Please be quiet. I'm busy right now.\nAthena:\nBusy? But you're just staring at that weird machine.\nCrab:\nI'm checking to see when Rifle ingested the foreign object!\nAthena:\nHe just keeps looking at that machine. He won't even glance our way.\nPhoenix:\n(Now I'm really curious to know more about his monitoring system.)\nMonitoring system (appears after \"Rifle's condition\")\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell us about the monitoring system you have here?\nCrab:\nIt's a collection of electronic medical records for all the creatures here. With this system and the camera footage, I can monitor the creatures 24/7. I won't tell you any more than that. It's private, company business.\nPhoenix:\nBut medical records are usually just a history of past medical exams and data. I never heard of any that could monitor 24/7.\nCrab:\n............Good point, Mr. Lawyer. I can see there's no fooling you.\nPhoenix:\nBut why would you want to fool me?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(This guy's going to be a tough nut to crack.)\nCrab:\n............I have my reasons.\nThe charm (appears after \"Rifle's condition\")\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? This looks like the charm Sasha had...) Dr. Crab, do you know anything about this charm?\nCrab:\nCharm...? Hey! Leave that alone! That belonged to Azura! What was Azura's charm doing in Rifle's stomach...?!\nPhoenix:\n(That's odd... When Sasha was telling us about the charm earlier... ...Sasha said that she had Azura's charm. But that charm is still at the detention center... Hey, wait a minute! Didn't Sasha say Azura and her boyfriend had matching charms? So this second charm must be the one that belongs to Azura's boyfriend.) Dr. Crab, is it possible this charm belongs to Azura's boyfriend...?\nCrab:\nI refuse to talk about such personal details of the deceased. Subject closed!\nPhoenix:\nA-All right... (He sure is touchy when it comes to Azura...)\nCharm added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nAzura Summers... Yesterday was the anniversary of her death, wasn't it?\nCrab:\n...That's right. She was killed by the orca.\nAthena:\nDo you really think Orla killed her? I... I don't believe it!\nCrab:\nWho can say if the orca did it on purpose? But the fact remains that she killed Azura. I was right there, the day of her death a year ago... I saw the orca bite Azura with my own eyes.\nAthena:\nBut... is that really the whole truth of what happened...?\nPhoenix:\nI guess only Orla knows what really happened... both a year ago and this time...\nThe charm (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? This looks like the charm Sasha had...) Dr. Crab, do you know anything about this charm?\nCrab:\nCharm...? Hey! Leave that alone! That belonged to Azura!

They're just electronic medical records and feeds from security cameras. With these, I can monitor all of the animals 24/7.\nPhoenix:\n...And I say that's not true. I have proof that you can't monitor the animals 24/7 with this system.\nPresent Security Footage\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The security camera doesn't begin recording until 10 AM.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis is the evidence that you can't monitor the animals 24/7!\nCrab:\nThe only thing that evidence proves is that you are mistaken, Mr. Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nUgh... (I guess I got it wrong.) But I still say it can't be true. And that's because...\nLeads back to:\n\"I have proof that you can't monitor the animals 24/7 with this system.\"\nPhoenix:\nThe security camera doesn't begin recording until 10 AM. If that's the case, how could you possibly monitor the animals 24/7?!\nCrab:\nOkay. You got me. I guess that was a pretty weak explanation.\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nCrab:\nYou're right. I guess I can't monitor the animals 24/7. But if I see anything unusual on the camera feeds, I can spring to action right away. And if I can examine an animal, I can usually tell exactly what is going on with them.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. He's really confident in his abilities.) But I still say you can't do that 24/7.\nCrab:\nBut I'm here at the aquarium most of the time. And I can go anywhere at any time to examine an animal.\nPhoenix:\nAnywhere? I say that's not true, either. I have proof that there's a place you can't go!\nPresent Security Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The only people who have access to the orca pool room are the owner and Sasha.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nCrab:\n...Do me a favor and come back later, would you? I'm going to get a little more sleep.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait! (I guess I got it wrong...)\nCrab:\nI'm telling you, I can go anywhere at any time to examine an animal. Why are you trying to argue that I can't?\nPhoenix:\nBecause I know it can't be true.\nLeads back to:\n\"I have proof that there's a place you can't go!\"\nPhoenix:\nThe only people who have access to the orca pool room are the owner and Sasha. So how can you say you monitor all of the animals?\nCrab:\nSon of a gun. So you knew about the security card, did you?\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nCrab:\nYes, tighter security was imposed on the orca a year ago as a precaution. Due to Sasha's objections, I wasn't allowed to have a card.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess she was trying to protect Orla from him...) So you're monitoring the animals with a system that's \"private, company business.\" But I have to insist you tell me about this monitoring system.\nCrab:\nNow YOU'RE trying to pick a fight with me?! Very well. I suppose it's only fitting that the spoils go to the victor. I'll tell you about Shipshape Aquarium's ecological data organization system.\nMonitoring system (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nPhoenix:\nSo what does that machine you were using do?\nCrab:\nIt's a system of ecological data organization developed in Europe. I call it the TORPEDO! What do you think? Pretty impressive name, isn't it?\nAthena:\n\"Torpedo\"? As in \"Man the battle stations!\" and all that?\nCrab:\nNo, no! It's the name I gave to this data organization system. \"TORPEDO.\" It stands for \"TeleObservation Realtime PErtinent Data Organizer.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Okaaay... But is it SuPer-Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected?) (Changed from [Quite a name... I wonder if it's super admin restricted desktop access pass-protected.] in the original release)\nCrab:\nThe TORPEDO collects data through sensors placed on or near the subjects. Temperature, heartbeat, vocalizations, etc. It gathers this information 24 hours a day. All of this data is then sent to my terminal and these monitors.\nAthena:\nWow! This TORPEDO sounds amazing! Does Rifle have a sensor on her, too?\nCrab:\nYes, she does. Where and what kind of sensor is attached depends on the animal. The penguins have theirs attached to the ID tag at the base of their flipper. The TORPEDO doesn't tell me where Rifle is when she escapes, though. It's hard to attach sensors to the orca or fish, so theirs are on the tanks themselves. Places where the creatures don't normally live, like the show stage, don't have sensors. ...Okay, here we go. It's telling me the time Rifle swallowed the foreign object... \"Approximately 4:00 AM on July 20th\"... What an odd time...\nPhoenix:\n(That was when Sasha was doing the cleaning.)\nAthena:\nMaybe that's why she wouldn't take my fish, because she was full from the night before. But at least Orla ate it, so that's okay.\nCrab:\nOrla ate another animal's food? That's odd. She's never done that before. And then she had that episode, too... I'd better take a look at her data... ...Huh? She didn't eat anything from the evening of the 19th to yesterday afternoon.\nPhoenix:\nSo Rifle had a late-night snack, but Orla went hungry, huh?\nCrab:\nIt appears so... But let's see... She's been eating normally since yesterday afternoon. ...Come to think of it, Jack was supposed to feed Orla yesterday morning... Maybe he died before he had the chance...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm worried about Orla's condition. I'd better remember this TORPEDO data...)\nTORPEDO Data added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I still wonder why he wouldn't tell us about the TORPEDO...)\nMonitoring system (after breaking Psyche-Locks; subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo what does that machine you were using do?\nCrab:\nIt's a system of ecological data organization developed in Europe.

(appears after \"Monitoring system\")\nPhoenix:\nDr. Crab, why did you want to hide the existence of the TORPEDO system?\nCrab:\n...Well, it's a safe system that has been approved for use in other countries... ...but it hasn't been legally approved in this country yet. That's why I always carry this terminal around with me. It's not something I want the police poking their nose into...\nAthena:\nYou mean... you're breaking the law?!\nCrab:\nWhich is why I was keeping it a secret. It would create a problem for the aquarium. I had Jack's permission. He felt the animals' care was more important than the legality. But we wanted to shield the rest of the staff, so we kept it a secret.\nAthena:\nBut breaking the law is breaking the law!\nCrab:\n...But, in some cases, lives can be saved by breaking the law. Do we simply allow the lives of our animals to be lost while we wait for laws to change?\nAthena:\n............Ugh. Now you're twisting things around...\nPhoenix:\nI'd like to use this evidence during the trial tomorrow. But it may result in you and Shipshape Aquarium being brought up on charges...\nCrab:\nWell, I followed my own convictions, and I have no regrets. You're only doing your job. I can't blame you for that, Mr. Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n...I appreciate that.\n*peep, peep, peep.* *peep, peep, peep.*\nPhoenix:\nWhat's that sound? Another penguin...?\nCrab:\n............That's my ringtone.\nAthena:\nGee, Dr. Crab sure likes cute things.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe he wanted it to sound like Sniper?\nCrab:\nHello? Crab speaking... Son of a gun! You people again?! Stop harassing this aquarium! Orla was found not guilty! Why on earth should she be put down?! Huh? Come there on the 26th and explain? Fine. Just let me write it down in my... Son of a gun! Where did my calendar go?\nPhoenix:\n(His calendar! Could he be talking about THAT calendar...?)\nCrab:\n...I realize that. If it comes to that, I'll use that drug to euthanize her.\nPhoenix:\n!\nAthena:\nMr. Wright! He s-said, \"euthanize her\"!\nPhoenix:\nWe'd better ask him more about this. (And I should try presenting that calendar to him, too.)\nWhy hide the TORPEDO?

You heard that?\nPhoenix:\n(Who didn't hear that?)\nCrab:\nIt was the Center for Dangerous Animal Control, calling with a demand. They said that the orca may have been found not guilty this time... ...but that if she ever attacked a human again, we would have to put her down.\nAthena:\nPut her down?! But that's horrible! Did you agree to their demand?\nCrab:\n...Animals sometimes do attack humans. And, of course, humans sometimes do kill animals to protect themselves. If it comes to that, yes, as a veterinarian, I am prepared to carry out euthanization... ...using this poison.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh?! That capsule... It has the same letters on it as the one that was in Orla's stomach! Did Dr. Crab... try to kill Orla...?)\nPresent\nCalendar (after clearing \"Why hide the TORPEDO?\" Talk option)\nPhoenix:\nDr. Crab, isn't this your calendar?\nCrab:\n! Yes, it's mine. What are you doing with it?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Rimes found it in the nap room.\nCrab:\nOh... I must've forgotten it there when I tried to get some rest...\nAthena:\nIt sure is a cute calendar. I guess you're crazy about penguins?\nCrab:\nSomebody gave it to me, okay?! Now, please don't tell anybody about it. It's embarrassing. Azura designed this calendar. This one here is a prototype. She designed a calendar for this year, and then she died before it went on sale...\nAthena:\nWere you and Ms. Summers... romantically involved?\nCrab:\nWhat?! What gave you that idea?!\nAthena:\nIt's just that I sensed... sadness in your heart when you talked about the calendar...\nCrab:\nOf course we weren't romantically involved! I don't believe in romantic feelings!\nPhoenix:\n(He looks shaken, though...) By the way, did you meet Mr. Shipley at 7:00 AM on July 20th, as scheduled?\nCrab:\n............No. We were supposed to meet, but Jack didn't show up.\nPhoenix:\n(Is that really true? Sasha finished cleaning the orca pool room at 6:00 AM. If Dr. Crab managed to get in the pool room somehow and meet with the victim... ...then he would have had the opportunity to kill Mr. Shipley!)\nCalendar updated in the Court Record.\nCalendar (after clearing \"Why hide the TORPEDO?\" Talk option; subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDr. Crab, isn't this your calendar?\nCrab:\n!

It meant a lot to her.\nPhoenix:\nAzura Summers... The trainer who died a year ago, right?\nAthena:\nWas Ms. Summers special to you, Dr. Crab?\nCrab:\nHmm? What are you talking about?\nAthena:\nOh, I'm sorry! I just thought I sensed a hint of romantic feelings...\nCrab:\nShe was my co-worker. Nothing more than that. Now, if you ask me any more inane questions, I will lose my patience!\nAthena:\nSorry about that. I guess I touched a nerve.\nPhoenix:\nIt seems everybody here at the aquarium loved Azura Summers.\nTORPEDO Data\nCrab:\nAh, you're interested in my TeleObservation Realtime PErtinent Data Organizer?\nPhoenix:\nYour \"TORPEDO,\" huh? So it allows you to gather data and observe all the animals?\nAthena:\nGee, Dr. Crab. The names you pick all seem to have something to do with weapons.\nCrab:\nWell, I do make a hobby of collecting air guns in my spare time. I picked \"Sniper\" and \"Rifle\" from a list of over one hundred gun name candidates.\nPhoenix:\nWhat were some of the other names on the list?\nCrab:\n\"Grenade\" and \"Launcher.\" \"Revol\" and \"Ver.\" Things like that.\nAthena:\nCouldn't you come up with anything a little cuter?!\nCrab:\nWhat? But those names are so cool! The young lady apparently just doesn't understand the masculine spirit.\nPhoenix:\nOh, well... You know... (Apparently, I don't, either.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and correctly presenting Calendar:\nPhoenix:\nPlease let me ask you one more question, Dr. Crab.\nCrab:\nWhat is it, Mr. Lawyer? You look so grave.\nPhoenix:\nI heard something disturbing from the writer Norma DePlume...\nDePlume:\nThe center demanded that the aquarium put the killer whale down a year ago.\nAthena:\nP-Put her down?!\nDePlume:\nBut the aquarium owner refused their demand, saying it was an accidental death. But I hardly think a persistent organization like that would just give up and go away. I'm quite sure the power of money helped convince them!\nPhoenix:\nWhat makes you think that?\nDePlume:\nOnce a month, the owner and the vet disappear from this aquarium. And I came to find out that, each time, a large amount of money was being paid out!\nPhoenix:\nI think Shipshape Aquarium might be keeping some kind of secret... ...and that it has something to do with the recent murder!\nCrab:\n............!\n5 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(F-Five Psyche-Locks?!)\nCrab:\nThat writer... She just has to stick her nose in everyone's business. Son of a gun... I should have dealt with it all more carefully...\nPhoenix:\n(How am I ever going to remove all those locks?)\n???:\nPhoenix:\n(H-Huh?!)\nFulbright:\nSorry to interrupt, but Prosecutor Blackquill wants Dr. Crab.\nPhoenix:\nD-Detective Fulbright!\nCrab:\nYou again? You couldn't possibly have any more questions for me!\nFulbright:\nWell, you see, we're having a little problem... We were going to call the animal keeper as a witness for the prosecution... ...but he's being very stubborn and refusing to testify. And so we thought we'd ask you to be a witness in tomorrow's trial!\nCrab:\n...Hmph. Did you really, now? Well, I'm not taking sides. I'll tell what I know. No more, no less.\nFulbright:\nThat would be fine! Now, if you would please come along with me!\nCrab:\nWell, it looks like we'll have to continue our talk at the trial tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nI don't know what secret you and this aquarium are hiding... ...but I'll uncover it if it'll help save Ms. Buckler.\nCrab:\nGive it your best shot, then. I'll see you tomorrow.\nAthena:\nWell, it looks like we'll be going up against Dr. Crab in tomorrow's trial.\nPhoenix:\nI bet he'll be one tough customer.\nAthena:\nOkay, we'd better get our evidence organized for tomorrow!\nPhoenix:\n(I'll have Athena hold on to the evidence I don't think I'll need in court.)\nEvidence has been re-organized.\n............... ............Beep.\nPhoenix:\nHello?\nApollo:\nMr. Wright! I went to Hickfield Clinic!\nPhoenix:\nA-Apollo, use your indoor voice.\nApollo:\nS-Sorry about that! Anyway, I found out a lot, so I wanted to tell you right away! It turns out that mysterious capsule is a powerful sleeping drug. Apparently, the brand name is \"3 Zs.\"\nPhoenix:\nOkay, yeah. It says \"3 Zs\" right on it.\nApollo:\nAnd they said the Shipshape Aquarium vet recently bought a large quantity from them!\nPhoenix:\nThe vet...! (Dr. Herman Crab...)\nApollo:\n\"3 Zs\" is supposed to be for people. But Dr. Crab told them it would work on other mammals, like orcas and dolphins, too.\nPhoenix:\n(So Dr. Crab's \"euthanization poison\"... was actually sleeping pills...? When Orla almost drowned today... was it because she'd been given sleeping pills...?)\n\"3 Zs\" Sleeping Pill updated in the Court Record.\nApollo:\nAnd I found out more than just about that capsule! Dr. Hickfield himself gave me some information. Shipshape Aquarium had someone on their staff named Azura Summers, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, the one who died a year ago.\nApollo:\nWell, Azura Summers was getting a certain medication from Hickfield Clinic last year... ...the same heart medication as Sasha Buckler!\nPhoenix:\nReally?! (Azura Summers had the same heart condition as Sasha...?) Nice work, Apollo. Thank you. We'll be coming back to the office soon.\nApollo:\nOkay. Trucy and I will be here!\nPhoenix:\nWell, we'd better get back to the office and get ready for tomorrow. What are you going to do, Pearls?\nPearl:\nI thought I'd stay overnight here and be with Orla and Rifle. I'll be ready for a telecast during the trial tomorrow! Good luck to both of you!\nAthena:\nThanks, Pearly!! That way, when we prove Sasha's innocent she can see Orla right away!\nPhoenix:\n(I'd love to see Sasha and Orla back together again, both free and clear! But before that can happen, I have to prove Sasha's innocence!)\nTo be continued\nWright Anything Agency (before clearing all Talk options and correctly presenting Calendar in Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger):\nPresent\nCharm\nTrucy:\nThat looks like an old charm. Is it yours?\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's evidence. But I have a charm of my own, actually.\nTrucy:\nYou do? Better keep it safe, then.\nAthena:\nYou're talking about that locket, right? The pendant you keep in your pocket? ...The one with Trucy's picture in it?\nPhoenix:\nHa ha. So you knew about that, huh? I'm a little embarrassed, so don't tell Trucy about it, okay?\nNothing to examine during investigation (any point other than when Orla must be rescued)\nPhoenix:\n(Nothing special here.)\nNothing to examine during investigation (when Orla must be rescued)\nPhoenix:\n(This is no time to be examining this!)\nArea already examined (during chapter \"Revisiting the Orca Pool\")\nPhoenix:\n(I guess we already examined this area, but let's take another look around.)\nArea already examined (during chapter \"The Show Stage\")\nPhoenix:\n(We already checked this out, but another round wouldn't hurt.)\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I think I have enough evidence, but maybe I'd better think about it a little more.)",

The ship's doctor and Azura were romantically involved?!Athena:\nWell, that's my theory, but I don't actually know if it's really true.Buckler:\nAzura would never get involved with that cod-awful ship's doctor! But I do admit... they were friends... But would Azura send Dr. Crab videos, I wonder...?Phoenix:\nVideos? What do you mean?Buckler:\nAzura used to send her boyfriend videos of herself teaching the orca tricks. I used to help Azura take the videos on her TV phone.Phoenix:\n(Hmm. This is an interesting bit of information...)TV Phone updated in the Court Record.Phoenix:\nSo TV phones can shoot videos, too, huh? My dumb phone sure can't.Buckler:\nThese TV phones are amazing! They can even record sounds you and I can't hear! All the equipment we use at Shipshape Aquarium is high-tech. The ship's doctor sends away for all kinds of electronics.Phoenix:\n(So all the high-tech stuff is Dr. Crab's doing, huh?)Buckler:\nAnyway, I still highly trout Azura's boyfriend was the ship's doctor.Phoenix:\nBut Dr. Crab found a charm yesterday, and he was really shaken by it.Crab:\nCharm...? Hey! Leave that alone! That belonged to Azura! What was Azura's charm doing in Rifle's stomach...?!Phoenix:\nThat charm looked just like your keepsake of Azura.Buckler:\nYeah, well... She did say she and her boyfriend had matching charms... Was the ship's doctor and Azura really a couple...? I-I can't believe it!Phoenix:\nI think Dr. Crab will be called as a witness today. There are still so many unanswered questions... ...but I hope to solve them all in today's trial.Buckler:\nI believe in you two! I know you can do it.Athena:\nAnd we WILL, Sasha! We promise!July 22, 9:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4Day 2Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge: \nCourt is now in session for the trial of Sasha Buckler.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready-- AAAAAGH!Blackquill:\n............Ready.Phoenix:\n(...Now I'm completely thrown off...)Judge:\nVery good. It appears both the prosecution and the defense are ready. Yesterday, it was proven that the orca was not guilty and that the victim fell to his death. Prosecutor Blackquill, did your investigation of the orca pool area turn up anything?Blackquill:\n............Hmph. It did. We found a bloodstain from the victim at the bottom of the pool. ...On this.Judge:\nOh, my. What a frightening-looking rock. And you say it has a bloodstain on it? Hmm. Just looking at it gives me the willies. So can we assume that there was no water in the pool at the time of the incident?Blackquill:\n............Very good. What a clever little deduction.Judge:\nHo ho! Well, it's nice to get a compliment from the prosecution for a change.Athena:\nProsecutor Blackquill has completely tamed the judge with his carrot-and-stick approach.Phoenix:\n(...I guess I should've brought a few carrots of my own.)Blackquill:\nRight. Moving along. I have prepared a witness. Buckler was the only one who entered that room when there was no water in the pool. The witness will prove that. ............Come to the stand, witness.Blackquill:\n............Name and occupation.Crab:\nDr. Herman Cr--Sniper:\nPeep!Crab:\nSniper! Stay in there!Judge:\nAnd who is that cute little creature?Blackquill:\nHmph. Such a restless bird. Quite unlike Taka.Taka:\nGraaaaaw!Sniper:\nPeep!Phoenix:\n(Wow... Chalk one up for Taka... He shut Sniper up with a single sound.)Crab:\nSon of a gun... Dr. Herman Crab, Shipshape Aquarium's veterinarian.Judge:\n...And could you tell us the name of your cute little friend there, as well?Athena:\nYour Honor, please focus on the case!Judge:\nBut it's important to learn all we can about the witness!Crab:\nThis is Sniper.Sniper:\n*peep!* *peep, peeeeep!* *peep, peep, peep, peep!*Crab:\nShe's the offspring of a penguin named Rifle. Sniper lives in my hair. She might cause a commotion now and then, but please try to ignore her.Blackquill:\nI was originally going to call the animal keeper to the stand... ...but he refused to testify, so I settled on the veterinarian. ............Now tell us. Why was the defendant in the orca pool room when the water was drained?Witness Testimony-- Cleaning the Orca Pool Room --Crab: \nIn the early morning hours of July 20th, Sasha was cleaning the orca pool room.\nSasha and Jack Shipley, the owner, were scheduled to do the cleaning together.\nDuring cleaning, the pool water is drained.\nWhile the cleaning was going on, Marlon was taking care of the orca in the show pool.\nThe pool water would never be drained unless the pool was being cleaned.Judge:\nHmm. And your claim is that the victim was made to fall to his death during the cleaning?Blackquill:\n............Hmph. Only Buckler and the owner had the security card necessary to enter the orca pool room. And we already know from the security company's record of card usage... ...that the defendant was in the orca pool room during the time of cleaning. The witness's testimony and the record of security card usage are conclusive evidence.Judge:\nSo no one beside the defendant was at the scene, and the water in the pool was drained.Phoenix:\nUh-oh... The judge already seems to be leaning toward the other side.Athena:\nWe have to strike fast... Your Honor, we're ready for our cross-examination now!Judge:\nOh! Yes, of course... Please proceed, then.Phoenix:\n(The power of youth comes in handy at times like these.)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Cleaning the Orca Pool Room --Crab: \nIn the early morning hours of July 20th, Sasha was cleaning the orca pool room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy is the cleaning done so early in the morning--essentially the middle of the night?\nCrab:\nOur aquarium is open every day of the year, without break. So of course the cleaning has to be done at night when there are no visitors. \nBlackquill:\nHmph... No days off, is that it? I can relate to that...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I guess prisoners don't get to take days off...) \nAthena:\nThings SURE are different around OUR office, huh, Boss?!\nPhoenix:\nYou don't have to rub it in quite so enthusiastically. \nBlackquill:\nSo, was the defendant cleaning alone?\nCrab:\nNo.Crab: \nSasha and Jack Shipley, the owner, were scheduled to do the cleaning together.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut Ms. Buckler said that Mr. Shipley never showed up to help with the cleaning!\nCrab:\nI don't know anything about that. All I know is what was on the schedule. Maybe they changed plans. They probably felt awkward with each other after their fight.\nPhoenix:\nIn any case, there's no proof the victim entered the orca pool room during cleaning!\nBlackquill:\n\nBlackquill:\nIf you don't stop your yammering, I will pull your tongue out and barbecue it.\nPhoenix:\nGah... (Do you have to be so violent...?) \nBlackquill:\nProof or none, the victim must have entered the pool room during cleaning. Witness, tell him why.\nCrab:\nJack must have entered the orca pool room. The reason I think so is because...\nAdds statement \"The record of card usage shows that Sasha entered the orca pool room.\" if not already addedCrab: \nThe record of card usage shows that Sasha entered the orca pool room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDon't you mean to say that the record shows both of their cards being used?\nCrab:\nNo, only Sasha's. But they must have gone in together. Jack's body was found in that room, so that's the only logical explanation. \nBlackquill:\nWe talked about this just yesterday.

Your Honor, please allow me to submit this photograph.Judge:\n............Oh! This is...!Phoenix:\nAs you can see, there is no water around the skull rock area. With the pool in this state, the victim could have been made to fall to his death.

Please take a look at this calendar.Judge:\nAh, you waved that around in court yesterday. No need to drag out your souvenir today.Phoenix:\nActually... I would like you to make note of the entry for the day of the incident!Judge:\nLet me see, here... \"Meet the captain at the orca pool at 7 AM.\" This note is about a meeting planned with the victim!Blackquill:\nWhat?!Phoenix:\nThe defense would like to argue that, at the time of that meeting... ...the pool may have been drained of its water!Judge:\nWh-Whose calendar is that?!Phoenix:\n............It belongs to Dr. Herman Crab. Isn't that right, Dr. Crab?Crab:\nSon of a gun... So you suspect me, do you?!Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of this calendar entry, Dr. Crab? Explain yourself!Crab:\nFine. I was supposed to meet Jack at the orca pool at that time. But... I ended up not going.Phoenix:\nSo you're saying you simply broke your promise? You can't get out of it that easily.

There's a saying amongst prisoners. \"Do not see, hear nor speak to smooth-talking lawyers.\" If you think the witness is suspicious, show your proof!Phoenix:\nAck! (The calendar alone isn't good enough, huh? I have to prove the victim could have fallen to his death at that 7 AM meeting time!)Athena:\nLet's put our heads together, Boss! The victim could've fallen during cleaning, when the pool was completely drained... ...or, using the partition, it could've been at 7 AM, with the water partially drained.

Stop yammering to each other and show me how you wield your sword!Phoenix:\nAll right, then. My sword is poised and ready. If the murder was committed at a time other than during cleaning time... ...then Orla must have been present at the scene. If I can prove that the murder happened right in front of Orla... ...then I can prove that Ms. Buckler is not guilty!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court...! Mr. Wright! Are you implying that the orca was a witness to the crime?!Phoenix:\nThat is exactly what I'm implying!Blackquill:\nHmph. And...? How do you intend to prove the orca witnessed the murder...? What are you going to do, put the orca on the stand and cross-examine her?!Phoenix:\n(This is a critical point. I'd better think about it carefully...) The defense will...Cross-examine Orla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf I asked Orla if she witnessed the murder, I'm sure she would tell me everything!\nBlackquill:\nReally? How interesting... And how do you propose to communicate with the orca?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I... I'd have to think about that...\nJudge:\nUnlike some birds, an orca is incapable of human speech. No, I'm afraid I cannot allow you to cross-examine a creature that cannot speak. Unless the defense has some other way of communicating with the orca...?\nPhoenix:\nNo... I'm afraid I don't, Your Honor. (I guess that was a silly idea...)

Your Honor! Please allow me to present a different piece of evidence!\nJudge:\nVery well. Let's see this evidence, then.\nLeads back to:\n\"What evidence shows that the murder took place right in front of the orca?\"Phoenix:\nThis photo indicates where we discovered luminol reactions yesterday. By accident, we got some of the luminol testing fluid on Orla. We were then very surprised to see... ...luminol reactions on Orla's body!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nSo what of it? There's nothing odd about that. As was discussed in yesterday's trial, the orca was bleeding. Traces of the orca's blood were also found on the skull rock. The orca must have injured herself when she rammed the rock.Phoenix:\n(So that cloud of blood Ms. DePlume saw... ...was from Orla head-butting the skull rock, was it?)Skull Rock updated in the Court Record.Blackquill:\nThose luminol reactions you saw on the orca are most likely from her head-butting.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut what's odd is the position of those bloodstains. Please take a good look at the photograph. Yesterday, Ms. DePlume said the blood disappeared when Orla put on the hat. That testimony indicated that Orla's injuries were under the hat area. However, these luminol reactions are in two entirely separate areas from her injuries. These bloodstains can't be Orla's own blood from when she was head-butting!Judge:\nTh-Then where did the blood come from...?Phoenix:\nIt's my firm belief that it's the victim's blood. The victim was killed right in front of Orla... ...and the victim's blood splattered onto Orla's body!Blackquill:\nGaaaaaaaaagh!Phoenix:\n(Now it finally all makes sense! Orla was a witness to the murder...! So THAT'S why...!)Athena:\nOrla? Boss! Something's wrong with Orla!Phoenix:\nWhat?! You're right! She's listless... and she's sinking!Phoenix:\nThere's one more fact that indicates Orla was a witness to the murder.Judge:\nThere's more?!Phoenix:\n(The culprit was afraid Orla could somehow reveal what she witnessed... ...and that's why they did what they did.

B-But... why?Blackquill:\nWright-dono... are you trying to tell this court... ...that the perpetrator tried to kill the orca off to prevent a witness from talking?! Do you really expect to defeat me with that feeble attack?!Phoenix:\nMy sword has been drawn. I'm not about to sheathe my evidence now. Orcas have an enormous potential for intelligence. The possibility that Orla could somehow manage to reveal the truth can't be denied. The culprit believed in this possibility... and that's why they tried to kill her! ............Dr. Herman Crab. You purchased this sleeping drug, didn't you?Crab:\n!Judge:\nWh-What?! Does this mean the veterinarian tried to do away with the orca?!Phoenix:\nWho but a veterinarian would better know how to disguise an orca's death? He could even prevent the police from examining Orla's body!Crab:\n............Why, you... Are you actually accusing me of trying to murder the orca?! HOW DARE YOU?! HOW DARE YOU slander the noble profession of VETERINARIAN?!Athena:\nEeeeeeek!Phoenix:\n(E-Eeek...!)Judge:\nMy goodness! One could cut the tension in this courtroom with a knife.Crab:\nYES! I admit to purchasing that sleeping drug! However............ it was subsequently stolen from my lab.Athena:\nThat's such a flimsy excuse!Crab:\nIt's the truth. What else can I say? Any one of the crew members could have entered my lab.Phoenix:\n(I guess that weakens my evidence quite a bit...)Crab:\n...Besides, think about it for a minute. Who was it that treated Orla after she swallowed the drug? It was I!Phoenix:\nBut as I recall, it took you quite a while to give that treatment. You didn't even come on your own. We had to go get you.Crab:\n............Son of a gun. You just remember all sorts of little details, don't you, Mr. Lawyer?Blackquill:\nThe orca pool and the lab are far apart. It's little wonder he didn't know Orla's condition.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nDidn't know...? That's highly doubtful. As far apart as they were, Dr. Crab still had a way to know all about Orla's condition. The defense would like to submit evidence that the witness knew about Orla's condition.Present TORPEDO Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The TORPEDO...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nCrab:\nYou're on fire, Mr. Lawyer. It's too bad you're wrong. I couldn't tell the condition of a sardine with that, let alone an orca!\nPhoenix:\nUrk... No, huh...?\nJudge:\nWhat happened to your fire now, Mr. Wright? Let me rekindle it... with a penalty!\nPhoenix:\n(No matter how far away Dr. Crab may have been, there's one piece of evidence... ...that should have allowed him to realize Orla's condition!)\nLeads back to:\n\"The defense would like to submit evidence that the witness knew about Orla's condition.\"Phoenix:\nThe TORPEDO...Crab:\nGah! You just had to bring that up, didn't you?!Phoenix:\nWith this advanced data system, surely you would have known Orla's condition!Blackquill:Blackquill:\n...Wait just one minute. What is this \"TORPEDO\"?Judge:\nDr. Crab! How dare you bring a weapon of mass destruction into my courtroom!Phoenix:\nThe TORPEDO, or \"TeleObservation Realtime PErtinent Data Organizer,\" is a data system. Until yesterday, only Dr. Crab and Mr. Shipley knew about the TORPEDO. It isn't legally approved in this country, so it was kept secret from the police.Judge:\nI-It's illegal?! Dr. Crab! I demand an explanation!Crab:\n............Son of a gun! You and your big mouth, Mr. Lawyer! Yes, it's true... I'm using an illegal system to monitor the creatures at the aquarium. The system uses sensors like these, and, yes, there's one in the orca pool, too. These sensors send sound waves through the water to gather data on the creatures. If it finds abnormalities in their condition, the TORPEDO alerts me with a sound.Judge:\nOh, my goodness! How very high-tech! But if it's illegal, I will not turn a blind eye. This matter will be appropriately dealt with at a separate time. Now then, Mr. Wright. Please continue.Phoenix:\nWith the TORPEDO, I'm sure Dr. Crab noticed the danger Orla was in... ...but he made no attempt to come to her aid on his own! And the reason for that is... that Dr. Crab wanted Orla dead!Crab:\n............The TORPEDO didn't give me a warning message. That's why I didn't know there was anything wrong with Orla. The sensor in the orca pool wasn't working during the police's investigation.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nCan you prove that statement?!Blackquill:Blackquill:\n............Heh heh. Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!Phoenix:\n(Wh-What's with him?)Athena:\nI guess this is all so high-tech for Prosecutor Blackquill that it's making him a little \"funny.\"Blackquill:\n\"Funny\"...? Yes, I find this all very \"funny.\" Witness, those \"sensors\" send sound waves through the water, correct? But what if there isn't any water?Crab:\nThen they wouldn't work. They would automatically switch off.Blackquill:\nI see... And where is the sensor in the orca pool located?Crab:\nI don't know. Jack is the one who attached it for me.Blackquill:\nYou don't know? Then I will tell you. The police found a sensor just like the one you just showed us. They found it attached to the table at the bottom of the pool.Phoenix:\nTable...? Do you mean the table in this photograph?Blackquill:\nThat's right. ............Don't you get it yet, Wright-dono? The table is on the skull rock side of the partition. It's affixed to the bottom of the pool, and can't be moved.Judge:\nOh! And so if the water was drained from the skull rock side of the pool...!Blackquill:\nPrecisely. Without water, the TORPEDO sensor would not work. Witness, when did that sensor automatically switch off?Crab:\nHang on. I'll look it up. The only times lately were during cleaning two days ago and the investigation yesterday. Of course I knew the pool would be drained while they cleaned it... ...but I had no idea they drained it for the investigation. No one let me know. That's why I didn't know about Orla's condition yesterday.Phoenix:\n(So Dr. Crab really did want to save Orla...?)Blackquill:\nHeh heh. Did you hear that, Wright-dono? Yes, the water can be drained without harm to the orca if the partition is used. But if the water is drained from the skull rock side, the sensor turns itself off. If the sensor was always on except for during the cleaning and the investigation... ...it means there must have been water in the pool at all other times. It was never drained. In other words... no one but the defendant could have committed the crime!Phoenix:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! This completely shatters the defense's argument!Phoenix:\nGgg... B-B-But... The fact still remains that Orla was nearly killed with Dr. Crab's sleeping drug!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nBut aren't you forgetting one important question? When was the sleeping drug given to the orca?Phoenix:\n...You're right. That hasn't been discussed yet, has it?Blackquill:\nThe orca pool is the scene of the murder. The police were there all day yesterday. The only way to give the drug to the orca undetected is to put it in her food. Yesterday, someone gave the orca food during the trial.Judge:\nSomeone did? I'm afraid I don't remember that.Blackquill:\nYou don't remember? You're not THAT old yet, are you? ............It was the defendant, Sasha Buckler!Phoenix:\nAaaaagh!Judge:\nHmm... So that is the orca that stands accused, is it?Orla:\nFwee, fweet!Phoenix:\n(Aw. She's waving her flipper at us. Maybe she's cheering us on?)Buckler:\nOrla, wish Phoenix and Athena luck!Orla:\nFweeeet!Judge:\nSo your argument is that Ms. Buckler is the one who gave the orca the drug?Blackquill:\nThe prosecution's argument hasn't changed. Buckler made the victim fall to his death and then manipulated the orca to pin it on her. Still not satisfied, she further planned to kill the orca with the sleeping drug!Phoenix:\n(Hmm. I didn't hear any reports of Dr. Crab feeding Orla... Maybe he didn't have a hand in Orla's attempted murder after all... But is there anybody else who could've fed Orla, besides Sasha?)Judge:\nHmm. If it's true the defendant is the one who fed the sleeping drug to the orca... ...then that places even more suspicion on her than ever.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThe defense objects to the prosecution's claims!Blackquill:\nWell, well. You still haven't admitted defeat?Phoenix:\nProsecutor Blackquill. I don't appreciate the way you only mention the parts that are convenient for you.Blackquill:\n............Hmph.Judge:\nWhat do you mean by that, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nThe prosecutor failed to mention that Ms. Buckler wasn't the only one who fed Orla! As you will all recall, there was another person who gave Orla food.Athena:\nO-Oh! You mean, that person...?Phoenix:\n(Looks like Athena remembers now, too.)???:\nCongrats, Sasha!Orla:\nFwee, fweet!???:\nTime to celebrate! Go on! Eat up! (Changed from [This is to celebrate! Eat it all up!] in the original release)Orla:\nFwee, fwee, fweet!Athena:\nOh, Mr. Wright! No...Phoenix:\n(I don't want to believe it, either, but we can't ignore the truth... The other person who fed Orla during the trial was...)Present Marlon Rimes profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Please recall when Orla was found not guilty yesterday.\"Present Sasha Buckler profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe person who fed Orla was... Sasha Buckler! (Changed from [The person who feed [sic] Orla was... Sasha Buckler!] in the original release)\nBlackquill:\n............That's what I've been saying all along! After the orca was falsely accused, the defendant planned to kill the orca. \nPhoenix:\nOh, wait a minute...! I, uh... Huh? I was just trying to, er... confirm... that the defendant ALSO fed the orca...!\nJudge:\nThat was already clearly established, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nUgh... It was just a simple attempt at confirmation, Your Honor... (But there WAS another person who fed Orla during the trial...) \nLeads back to:\n\"The other person who fed Orla during the trial was...\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nBlackquill:\nI don't remember that person feeding the orca. \nPhoenix:\n...Oops. Uh, my finger slipped.\nJudge:\nYou'll receive a penalty for that, Mr. Wright. \nPhoenix:\n(But, other than Sasha... ...there was one other person who fed Orla during the trial...) \nLeads back to:\n\"The other person who fed Orla during the trial was...\"Phoenix:\nPlease recall when Orla was found not guilty yesterday. ...Marlon Rimes gave the orca a large quantity of food. If the sleeping drug was mixed in with that food... ...it could be given to the orca without arousing police suspicion!Judge:\nN-Now that you mention it, I do remember that flip-flopper feeding the orca!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nHmph! So you remembered, did you? I see the time for a true sword fight has come. I call Marlon Rimes to the stand!Crab:\n............Mr. Lawyer. Both Miss Orca Lover and Marlon Rimes are important members of our crew. I don't want to suspect either of them, but I'm ready to accept whatever truth you find. Here. Take this.Phoenix:\n! That charm...!Athena:\nIt's the charm that matches the one Azura Summers had, isn't it? So you and Ms. Summers WERE romantically involved, weren't you, Dr. Crab?Crab:\nWhat? No, of course not. Sorry to disappoint you, but this doesn't belong to me. At the time, I thought it was Azura's, so I grabbed it... ...But it wasn't hers. Now it's up to you, Mr. Lawyer, to figure out whose charm it is.Phoenix:\n...I will. Thank you, Dr. Crab.Crab:\nAfter all, I'm interested in the outcome of this trial, too...Judge:\nNow, then. Please summon Marlon Rimes to the witness stand!Rimes:\nWh-What's going on? What's everybody makin' that face for? I haven't been watchin' the trial and nobody's told me anythin'.Judge:\nMarlon Rimes. You are under suspicion for the attempted murder of the orca.Rimes:\n............ I see... Well, if it's already out...Phoenix:\nM-Mr. Rimes...? (Is he really going to admit it?)Rimes:\nFine. I'll tell the truth.Witness Testimony-- The Truth --Rimes:\nSasha is lyin' to protect that orca.\nAt 3:30 AM on the 20th, there was still water in the orca pool.\nThe incident happened before the orca was moved to the show pool!\nOrla killed the captain by bashin' him thirty feet high and makin' him slam into the water!

I did not see THAT testimony coming...)Athena:\nNow wait just one minute! Yesterday, Orla was proven innocent! Besides, you said Orla was in the show pool during the cleaning!Rimes:\nI didn't wanna sell Sasha out... That's I didn't tell the truth... But the fact is, all three of us -- the captain, Sasha and me -- were cleanin' the pool room. (Changed from [But the fact is, all three of us--Sasha, the captain and me--were cleanin' the pool room.] in the original release)Athena:\nBut Dr. Crab and Ms. Buckler both said you were at the show stage...!Rimes:\n...Well, the only thing Dr. Crab knew about the cleanin' was what I told him. I didn't give him a whole lot of details, either. Maybe he misunderstood. And Sasha is lyin' to protect the orca. She can't tell the truth. Sasha put blood on the skull rock herself to make a fake bloodstain. I think it's pretty brave of her to let herself get arrested to protect the orca.Athena:\nMr. Rimes! How can you lie like that?!Rimes:\nIt's the truth! Besides, wouldn't it be better for you if I wasn't lyin'? If the orca did it, you win your case!Athena:\nWhat?!Judge:\n............ This is all very hard to believe... ...but if Mr. Rimes's story is true... ...Ms. Buckler would be innocent, and the orca would be the killer.Phoenix:\n! (Meaning, if we turned our backs on Orla... ...we could save Sasha...?!)Blackquill:\nHaving a witness lie to save your own client? What a dirty, underhanded tactic, Wright-dono!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYesterday, the defense proved Orla was not guilty. We have no intention of going back on our assertions now!Rimes:\nWhat are ya sayin', Mr. Wright?! All ya gotta do is admit the orca did it, and Sasha goes free! Isn't a lawyer supposed to act in his client's best interest?!Phoenix:\nBut that wouldn't be acting in her interest. Ms. Buckler believes Orla is innocent. And we, of course, believe that Ms. Buckler herself is innocent, too. Acting in the client's best interest is an important part of our job as lawyers. Using dirty means to win a verdict would destroy our client's faith in us.Athena:\nThat's right! We believe in both Ms. Buckler's AND Orla's innocence!Rimes:\nHuh?! I just don't understand how ya can treat a human and an orca equally. Sasha or the orca? You can only save one of them!Phoenix:\nHa ha ha. I don't know about that. I think I can save them both. All I have to do is disprove your testimony!Rimes:\nOh, yeah? Then go ahead and try.Phoenix:\nI will do just that. (If I can't tear down his testimony, I won't be able to save both of them.

There has to be a way to prove Sasha is innocent!Phoenix:\n(At a time like this............ the thing to do is turn my thinking around! Instead of trying to prove that Sasha couldn't have done it... ...I have to think about what made it possible for somebody else to have done it. As long as the crime scene is the orca pool room... ...then Sasha is the only one who could have committed the crime.)Blackquill:\n............No need for pity, Your Baldness. Just finish him off with a swift verdict.Judge:\nIt appears the defense has no objections. Very well. I will give my verdict--Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYour Honor! Please hold off on that verdict!Judge:\nBut you were so quiet, Mr. Wright. Do you have something to say now?Phoenix:\nThe defense has a counterargument!Judge:\nY-You do?!Blackquill:\nHmph... Pitiful. Such desperation. You look pale. Are you sure you're prepared to make this counterargument?Phoenix:\n(\"The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles...\" (Changed from ['A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets...'] in the original release) I'll never forget those words, no matter how many years go by. Even though it's probably just a bluff, I'll give it to them with a smile!) ...What if the scene of the crime was somewhere else?Judge:\nThe scene of the crime?Rimes:\nSomewhere else...?Blackquill:\nWhat? You're finding fault with the police investigation now?Phoenix:\nAs I understand it, the prosecution's argument is as follows. The scene of the crime was the orca pool room. Only the defendant and victim entered that room when there was no water in the pool. Therefore, only the defendant could have committed the crime.Blackquill:\n...That is correct.Phoenix:\nBut if the scene of the crime was NOT the orca pool room... ...then somebody other than the defendant could have committed the crime!Athena:\nA-Are you sure you know where you're going with this?!Phoenix:\nI might not be too sure, but I can't back down now!Judge:\nMr. Wright... I hope that I'm wrong, but this isn't one of your bluffs, by any chance...?Phoenix:\nHa ha ha! Of course not! (...The judge knows me far too well.)Judge:\nAnd do you have a theory on where the actual scene of the crime was?Phoenix:\nYes, of course! (Think, Phoenix! Think! Think of a place -- other than the orca pool room -- where one could fall to one's death!)Judge:\nThen, by all means, please share your theory with the court! Where was the real scene of the murder?Present Show Pool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The show stage pool might have been drained of water at some point as well!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nTHIS was the actual scene of the murder!\nJudge:\nReally? Do you actually believe the victim was killed there?\nPhoenix:\nWell, when you put it like that... my response would have to be... a definite \"maybe.\"\nJudge:\nIn that case... you will definitely be getting a penalty. No \"maybe\" about it.\nPhoenix:\nAck...! This time, I promise to point out the true scene of the murder, Your Honor! \nJudge:\nYou sound very sure of yourself for a man who just received a penalty. I hope you are right this time.\nLeads back to:\n\"Where was the real scene of the murder?\"Phoenix:\nThe show stage pool might have been drained of water at some point as well! And, if so, it would be just as possible to fall to one's death there as the orca pool!Blackquill:\n............Wright-dono. What you're doing is a disgrace to your profession. I sincerely hope you have some basis for what you're suggesting!Phoenix:\nO-Of course I do! (I will... as soon as I think of something...!)Blackquill:\nThe victim's body was found in the orca pool! How do you explain that?!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nHow about if, after the victim was killed in the show stage pool... ...his body was moved to the orca pool...?Judge:\n\"How about if...\" What kind of presentation of your argument is that?! You had better have a reasonable explanation of how the body was moved!Phoenix:\n(There's no turning back now! I have to think of a way the body could've been moved! Was there something at the scene that could've been used to move the body?)Present hoist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The hoist runs between the orca pool room and the show stage.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nBlackquill:\nTotally misguided, completely wrong and astonishingly foolish!\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nBlackquill:\nHow could anyone move a body with that?! \nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please make it a habit to think before you speak!\nPhoenix:\n(Even though the two pools aren't all that far apart... ...it would still be pretty hard to carry a body all that distance. So the culprit must've used some kind of tool to move the body.) \nLeads back to:\n\"Was there something at the scene that could've been used to move the body?\"Phoenix:\nThe hoist runs between the orca pool room and the show stage. The stretcher can be hung from the hoist to move things like Orla or the skull rock. The stretcher could also have been used to move the dead body!Judge:\nHmm. Yes, if the stretcher can move the orca or the skull rock... ...it seems likely it could also move a dead body as well.Phoenix:\n(Wow! Somehow, that worked! I just might be able to pull this off!) If the show pool was the scene of the crime, somebody else could have done it!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nHmph. You desperately spew conjecture and now you even make up a crime scene?Phoenix:\nAaaaaaaaaaagh!Judge:\nEeeeeeeeeeek!Athena:\nNot again?!Blackquill:\nYou don't have the soul of a warrior. You don't deserve to be on the battlefield! And even your fabrication is half-baked. It's a disgrace!Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean, \"half-baked\"?Blackquill:\nThe hoist can be operated from the orca pool room only.Phoenix:\nGah...Blackquill:\nAnd the only person who entered the orca pool room was the defendant. So even if the body was moved... ...the only one who could have moved it was the defendant herself!Phoenix:\nNAAAAAAAARGH!Judge:\nOrder...! So it comes back to the defendant, no matter which pool it was?Phoenix:\n(Meaning... I can't clear Sasha either way...? Sasha said she moved Orla and the skull rock... ...and I believe her. So could it be possible that she moved the body herself without being aware of it?!)Judge:\nMr. Wright? Do you have an objection to Prosecutor Blackquill's claim?Phoenix:\n(Do I have an objection to the claim that the defendant moved the body?)You bet I have one!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defense has an objection!\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. All right, fine. Let's hear this \"objection,\" then. \nPhoenix:\nEr... well... My objection is... (I can't admit I hadn't thought of one...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, you just FELT like saying you had an objection, didn't you?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nWell, I just FEEL like giving you a penalty!\nBlackquill:\nThe hoist could only be operated from the orca pool room. Furthermore, the defendant is the only one who entered the orca pool room. Therefore, the defendant is the only one who could have moved the body. \nPhoenix:\n(There are no inconsistencies in Prosecutor Blackquill's claim itself. But the only things Sasha moved are Orla and the skull rock. So that must mean... Sasha moved the body without realizing it...) ...I admit, I don't see any problems with Prosecutor Blackquill's claim per se... \nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Buckler must have been the one who moved the body...\"I have no objections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI have............ no objections.\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Buckler must have been the one who moved the body...\"Phoenix:\nMs. Buckler must have been the one who moved the body...Blackquill:\nWh-What?Judge:\nMr. Wright! Are you admitting the defendant committed the murder?!Phoenix:\n...No. I'm simply conceding that she was the only one who could have moved the body. However, I contend Ms. Buckler was not aware that is what she was doing. The culprit made her move it, unbeknownst to her!Judge:\nThe defendant moved a dead body without recognizing that it was a dead body? How could that be possible?!Phoenix:\n(The body was found in the orca pool. It must have been moved there somehow. I might find some kind of hint in the things she moved with the stretcher!) The culprit made Ms. Buckler move the body along with this piece of evidence!Present Skull Rock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The skull rock...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nY-You're claiming the defendant moved the body with that?!\nPhoenix:\nIt might seem surprising, but it's true.\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. It's not \"surprising.\" It's \"absurd,\" which is no surprise, coming from you. \nJudge:\nI'm afraid I have to agree. Indeed, there's nothing else to call it but \"absurd.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. Looks like I got it wrong. The only two things Sasha moved are Orla and the skull rock. Why was Orla ramming the skull rock? There must be an answer that explains everything!) Your Honor! Please let me give that another try!\nLeads back to:\n\"The culprit made Ms. Buckler move the body along with this piece of evidence!\"Judge:\nThe skull rock...?Phoenix:\nMs. Buckler told me yesterday that she moved the skull rock when she was cleaning. The only two things Ms. Buckler moved to the orca pool are Orla and the skull rock. I would like to suggest that the victim's body may have been inside the skull rock!Judge:\nWh-Whaaaaaaat?!Blackquill:\n!Phoenix:\nHidden inside the rock, the body could have been moved to the orca pool with the hoist. At the show stage, Marlon Rimes loaded up the skull rock, with the body inside... ...and then he used the walkie-talkie to let Ms. Buckler know the rock was loaded. Ms. Buckler operated the hoist from the orca pool room and moved the stretcher! She moved the rock without knowing the body was inside!Judge:\nDo you really think there's enough space inside the skull rock to place a body?Phoenix:\nThe Swashbuckler flyer indicates it could be possible. Please focus on the question at the bottom left.Judge:\nOh! It says, \"Who will obtain the gold coins hidden in the skull rock?!\" Hmm. In that case, I suppose the rock is most likely hollow.Phoenix:\nWhat's more, if the body was inside the skull rock... ...it explains the remaining unanswered questions.Judge:\nSuch as...?Phoenix:\nPlease take a look at the security footage of the scene Ms. DePlume witnessed. Where did the body that Ms. DePlume saw come from? Please recall... What was Orla doing to the skull rock at this time? She was head-butting it.Judge:\nOh!Phoenix:\nThat's right. Orla's ramming released the body from the skull rock! The body had been placed inside the skull rock and moved there from the show stage. I assert that the real murder scene was, in fact, the show stage pool!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nHmph! What rubbish is this now? You don't have a single scrap of evidence!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nIt's easy enough to verify what I say. Take a look inside the skull rock for yourself! You should find some kind of proof that the body was there. Blood, fibers, hair...Blackquill:\nGaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Wright-dono...!Athena:\nMr. Wright! Th-That was incredible! You turned things completely around! And to think! It all started with that half-baked bluff, too!Phoenix:\nWhew! That was a close one! (Did you really have to add that last bit?)Judge:\nIf the murder took place at the show stage, then who is the perpetrator?Phoenix:\nIt is, naturally, the person who was at the show stage.Rimes:\n............Phoenix:\nMr. Rimes... Weren't you the one who loaded the skull rock onto the stretcher at the show stage?Rimes:\n........................ ............Heh heh. Wow, Mr. Wright. That was some pretty smart brainwork ya did there. To be honest, I never thought you could figure it out... I tried to protect myself, but I guess it came back to bite me...Judge:\nAre you confessing you gave false testimony before, Mr. Rimes?! That's perjury!Rimes:\nYeah... What Mr. Wright says is true. The body WAS inside the skull rock. And it's true the captain was killed in the show pool, too.Phoenix:\n(What? He's admitting it that easily?!)Rimes:\nThis time, I'm gonna tell ya the whole truth about what happened that day!Witness Testimony-- The Whole Truth --Rimes:\nIn the show pool, the orca shot the captain up into the air!\nThen the captain came down and slammed into the water!\nI can still remember the spectators' screams clearly...\nAll Sasha did was move the body! She was tryin' to protect the orca.\nWhen Ms. DePlume witnessed the orca findin' the body, I freaked.Judge:\nHmm... So now we're back to the orca again, I see!Blackquill:\nIf you were going to give testimony like that, why did I bother putting you on the stand?Rimes:\nAll I'm doin' is tellin' the truth! That day, Sasha wanted to do the old version of the Swashbuckler Spectacular. So I suggested she hide the body in the skull rock and move it to the orca pool. I was gonna figure out what to do with the body after the show was over. The orca is the one that killed the captain! It wasn't me, and it wasn't Sasha!Phoenix:\n(So it was Mr. Rimes's idea to hide the body in the skull rock? But if Mr. Rimes is the culprit, why would he protect Sasha? False charges against Sasha would mean he himself would escape suspicion. So why...?)Athena:\nMr. Wright, how about if you leave this to me?Phoenix:\nAthena! Do you mean... you heard something?!Athena:\nYup, noise! Discord in Mr. Rimes's heart.Phoenix:\nSo that means, somewhere in his testimony, there's an inconsistency in his emotions... All right, Athena! Give him a good counseling session!Athena:\nYou got it, Boss! Huh? What's this?Phoenix:\nWhat are you getting, Athena?Athena:\n...Hmm... This testimony is pretty complex. Feelings of deep sadness and intense anger are being called up. Those two emotions appear to be running out of control!Phoenix:\nOut-of-control emotions...? Is that going to be a problem?Athena:\nWe'll have to probe their cause if we want to get to his true emotions and testimony. There might even be odd or unnatural spots in his testimony he isn't even aware of.Phoenix:\nAll right. Let's probe the cause of his out-of-control emotions, then!Athena:\nI'll explain how to probe. Let's find the root cause together. When you see something off in a statement, press \"Probe\" ([L / LB / Q])! (Changed from [When you see something off in a statement, tap the Probe button!] in the original release) Next, point to what's causing Mr. Rimes's out-of-control emotions. Finally, press \"Probe\" ([X / Y / R]) to complete the process! (Changed from [Finally, tap Probe to complete the process!] in the original release) When emotions are out of control, memories can be recalled incorrectly. If you still haven't found anything after all the statements and images, I'll help.Phoenix:\nGreat! All right. I'll get started comparing the statements with the images.Rimes:\nIn the show pool, the orca shot the captain up into the air!Probe Orla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Rimes, you're angry with Orla, aren't you?\nRimes:\nAngry? At an orca? Why would I be? If ya think I have some reason to be mad, then show me some proof.\nPhoenix:\n(Do I have proof that Mr. Rimes has a reason to be mad...?) \n\n\n\nI've got your proof!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI've got your proof right here! Uh, somewhere... I'm just not sure where at the moment...\nRimes:\nYou're accusin' me without any proof? That's low, man. If ya wanna fight with just words, why not settle this with a rap battle? \nPhoenix:\nUm, no, thanks. Maybe some other time... (Well, THIS isn't working... If I can't uncover the reason for his anger, I'd better think of a new approach.)\nLeads back to Mood Matrix segment\n\n\n\n\nUm... No?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm afraid I don't have any proof.

Let's concentrate on probing just one. He did make one odd statement I was wondering about... I highly doubt there were any spectators at the scene of the crime.Phoenix:\nHey, good point! That just doesn't fit. It might be the cause of his out-of-control emotions. Let's try pointing to the spectators. (Changed from [It might be the cause of his out-of-control emotions. Point to the spectators.] in the original release)Athena: \nJust to be sure, I'll explain how to probe one more time. Press \"Probe\" ([L / LB / Q]) at the statement that seems off!

That made the sadness subside. So maybe the \"spectators\" part was what was making him sad?Phoenix:\nI wonder why he would make that mistake, saying spectators were there? How strange.Athena:\nThe only thing I can think of... is that he was mixing up one memory with another. Like... he was in a similar situation before, and it was deeply imprinted on his heart.Phoenix:\n(A situation where an orca killed somebody and there were spectators there...? Hey! I think I know why he's mixing up his memories...

(Ouch. She dismissed that pretty fast.)\nAthena:\nLet's look for something that shows he suffered intense emotional pain in the past. \nPhoenix:\n(When it comes to psychology, I can really count on Athena! Hmm. An orca attacking somebody in front of spectators... Hey! I think I've got it now!)\nLeads back to:\n\"The reason why Mr. Rimes mixed up his memories is...\"Phoenix:\nMr. Rimes, I think I know what happened. Could you have been mixing up what happened a year ago with this incident? Maybe that's why you slipped and said the owner was killed in front of spectators?Rimes:\nWhat?! How did you...?! You're right... I did see the orca kill somebody a year ago... But what about it? I was just one of the spectators.Athena:\nReally? Just another spectator? There must a reason why you feel great sadness about that incident last year.Blackquill:Blackquill:\nStop this nonsensical scrutiny of feelings! Just present evidence to prove your point!Athena:\nEeep! B-Boss, do we have any kind of evidence that would back us up here?Phoenix:\nHmm. There IS one piece that comes to mind that might explain his sadness...Blackquill:\nWell?! I'm waiting!

Hmm. One can only wonder. \nJudge:\nMr. Wright! How dare you roll the dice when you accuse someone of intent to murder?!\nPhoenix:\nI-I apologize, Your Honor... I'll do better next time. (Who did Mr. Rimes bear a grudge against? There's only one answer!)\nLeads back to:\n\"I will now reveal the identity of the individual Mr. Rimes meant to kill from the start!\"Judge:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaat?! So the witness's intent was to kill the orca?!Phoenix:\nExactly. The witness's intended victim was not Jack Shipley. From the start, it was all a scheme to kill Orla!Blackquill:\nThe orca was his true target? But Jack Shipley is the one who died! The orca is alive and quite well!Phoenix:\n............ (Hmm. He's right... He wanted to kill the orca, and yet it was Jack Shipley who fell to his death. How did that happen? ...Wait a minute...! What if...? What if Mr. Rimes wanting to kill Orla was somehow connected to Mr. Shipley's death?)Blackquill:\nHmph... At a loss for words, are you? What happened to your bravado of a moment ago? Enough of these reckless words, without any basis in fact!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThey aren't reckless words! The basis for my claim is at the real murder scene... the show pool!Blackquill:\nWhat are you talking about?Phoenix:\nIt's my contention that two incidents happened at the show pool. The attempted murder of the orca, and the victim falling to his death. First of all, in order to kill the orca, Mr. Rimes removed something from the scene. And, by so doing, he made it possible for Mr. Shipley to fall to his death.Judge:\nHe did what now? (Changed from [What did he remove?] in the original release) Mr. Wright! What did Mr. Rimes remove in an attempt to kill Orla?! (Changed from [This is what Mr. Rimes removed in an attempt to kill Orla!] in the original release)Present water\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Don't tell me you're trying to claim he tried to kill the orca by draining the pool water?!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nBlackquill:\nIf you could kill a giant orca with that, you would be the king of the ocean! ...Clearly, you lack respect for the sea!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch. That remark was as salty as sea water... But wait a minute... Orla is a creature of the sea... And how would one kill a sea creature...? So THAT'S the answer!)\nRimes:\nSo what be yer answer? Smartly now, Mr. Lawyer! How did I try to kill the orca?\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Wright! What did Mr. Rimes remove in an attempt to kill Orla?!\"Blackquill:\nDon't tell me you're trying to claim he tried to kill the orca by draining the pool water?!Phoenix:\nThat's exactly what I'm claiming. To help the defendant with the cleaning, Marlon Rimes took charge of Orla... ...with the plan to kill Orla in the show pool! And because the pool water was drained... ...it made it possible for Jack Shipley to fall to his death in the show pool!???:Rimes:\nArr! I tried to kill the orca, ye say? Can ye even prove there was nary a drop of water in the pool?! That day, I was simply lookin' after the orca. Why would I have the monstrous thought of killin' it?!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYou claim you were looking after Orla in the early morning hours of July 20th... ...but I don't think you were doing a very good job of it. After all, Orla wasn't given anything to eat during that time.Rimes:\nHow would ye know such a thing?!Phoenix:\nI know because of Orla's record here in the TORPEDO data system. This system continuously records data on the subjects it monitors. From Orla's record, we can tell exactly when she ate... or didn't eat.Rimes:\nSink me! Nobody ever told me 'bout that dastardly contraption!Phoenix:\nOnly a few of the Shipshape Aquarium staff know about this system. According to Orla's record, she never ate in those early morning hours of the 20th. You planned to kill Orla, and that's why you didn't feed her!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nHmph. You're wasting time. What proof do you have of that? Perhaps the orca simply wasn't hungry?Phoenix:\n(Ack, he's right. I don't have any proof...)Athena:\nIf Orla simply didn't eat, then that would create an inconsistency. Where did her fish go?Phoenix:\n(Her fish? Good question. Where did it disappear to?)Blackquill:\nFish? What does it matter? What relevance does it have to the case? Cease this stalling with inconsequential questions! (Changed from [Cease this stalling by asking inconsequential questions!] in the original release) Stop delving into the depths of the orca's stomach and delve into the case instead!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut wait! It may seem like a small inconsistency... ...but it's an issue of great importance. (I think.)Judge:\nWhat are you driving at, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(How could the fish disappear? Somebody must have eaten it... So who came to the show stage and ate Orla's fish? I think I might have a pretty good idea...) I believe there must have been a visitor to the show stage that Mr. Rimes didn't notice.Blackquill:\n............Visitor? Are you trying to introduce yet another suspect at this eleventh hour? If you utter more of your careless remarks, Taka won't look favorably upon it!Phoenix:\nI don't plan to utter any \"careless\" remarks. (Whether my remarks will actually be related to the case or not, I don't yet know...)Athena:\nDon't worry, Boss. If Taka comes this way, I'll fend him off! But do try to keep your remarks \"careful\"!Phoenix:\n(Somehow, Orla's fish disappeared... Somebody must've visited the show stage, but who?) This was the visitor to the show stage!Sasha Buckler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe that Sasha Buckler visited the show stage!\nBlackquill:\nThe defendant...? What basis do you have for that claim?\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that Orla's fish disappeared. Ms. Buckler must have eaten up all of the fish meant for Orla!\nBlackquill:\n...Is this some kind of jest? Do you actually believe the defendant ate the orca's fish?\nPhoenix:\nI believe it could be a possibility!\nJudge:\n...No. No, I don't believe it could.\nPhoenix:\n(How did Orla's fish disappear? I'd better think about it a little more.)\nLeads back to:\n\"This was the visitor to the show stage!\"Herman Crab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe Dr. Crab visited the show stage!\nBlackquill:\n...The witness from before? Do you have any basis for that claim?\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that Orla's fish disappeared. He most likely decided to feed Orla some fresher fish... ...and took the old fish away somewhere. \nBlackquill:\n\"Somewhere\"? Where? And where is this \"fresher fish\" he was going to give her?\nPhoenix:\nWhere...? Yes. Hmm. Good question.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, there is no \"question\" about \"where\" this penalty is going!\nPhoenix:\n(How did Orla's fish disappear? I'd better think about it a little more.)\nLeads back to:\n\"This was the visitor to the show stage!\"Rifle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I believe Rifle the penguin visited the show stage!\"Phoenix:\nI believe Rifle the penguin visited the show stage!Judge:\nFirst an orca, now a penguin?Rimes:\nWhy would ye be sayin' such a thing, Mr. Lawyer? I didn't see Rifle durin' the wee early mornin' hours. Do ye have any proof Rifle visited the show stage? If ye be a lawyer of any salt, show me yer evidence!Phoenix:\n(The bottom of Rifle's feet were pink for some reason... That fact is a clue that Rifle was indeed at the show stage. I have to present that piece of evidence that connects Rifle to the show stage!) Now to prove I'm a lawyer worth my salt! This is the proof that Rifle visited the show stage!Present Handmade Sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Oh, my! What a cute little sign.

YO HO HOOOOOO! DAT EVIDENCE, FAKE. YER A DISGRACE! YE BE SHARK BAIT! GET OUTTA MA FACE!\nJudge:\nHmm, yes. I quite agree. That evidence doesn't support your claim, Mr. Wright.\nRimes:\nWell, shiver me timbers, Your Honor! Ye have a fair sense of rap music!\nPhoenix:\n(The bottom of Rifle's feet were pink for some reason... That fact is a clue that Rifle was indeed at the show stage. I have to present that evidence that connects Rifle to the show stage!) ...I promise to present some much more credible evidence this time, Your Honor!\nLeads back to:\n\"This is the proof that Rifle visited the show stage!\"Judge:\nOh, my! What a cute little sign. Look at all of those adorable stars!Phoenix:\nThese stars are actually starfish. Ms. Buckler painted this sign. In the early morning hours of the 20th, she left this sign at the show stage to dry. Mr. Rimes kept an eye on the sign for Ms. Buckler while the paint was drying.Rimes:\nAye, that be true! But what be yer point?Phoenix:\nOn this sign... ...is proof that Rifle visited the show stage.Judge:\nProof of the penguin's visit? I'm afraid I don't see it... Where is this proof that the penguin visited the show stage? Please point it out.Present pink prints at top left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"A couple of the pink starfish are shaped a little differently from the others.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWhat? Does that really prove the penguin visited the show stage?\nPhoenix:\nIt might prove it, but then, on the other hand, it might not. No one can say for sure!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! I can say for sure that you are getting a penalty!\nAthena:\nUngh... Do you really think this sign proves Rifle was at the show stage?\nPhoenix:\nI do. If you take a good look, you'll see the marks of her passage. And if you check out Rifle's data in the court record, you'll get another clue.\nJudge:\nI expect a better answer out of you this time, Mr. Wright. \nLeads back to:\n\"Where is this proof that the penguin visited the show stage?\"Phoenix:\nA couple of the pink starfish are shaped a little differently from the others.Judge:\nAh, you're right! They look almost like little leaves.Phoenix:\nRifle had pink paint on the bottom of her feet. These little leaf-like shapes on this sign are actually Rifle's footprints. Rifle made these footprints by walking on the sign before it was dry!Judge:\nHo ho! What cute little pink penguin prints!Blackquill:\nSo there are footprints... What of them?Phoenix:\nMarlon Rimes was watching over this sign at the show stage while the paint dried. And during that time, the penguin paid a visit. According to the TORPEDO data system... ...we know that Rifle ate something that morning of the 20th. Most likely, Rifle ate the fish meant for Orla that was at the show stage. Orla's snack was a small quantity of fish. Even a penguin could have eaten it all.Rimes:\nBegad! Rifle ate Orla's fish...? Who be ye to say Rifle ate Orla's fish? She could have picked up food anywhere! But that doesn't change the fact that I really WAS at the show stage. After all, I had to help move the skull rock. It couldn't have been moved without me!Blackquill:\nThe witness claims he never saw the penguin. How do you explain this contradiction?Phoenix:\n(Both Mr. Rimes and Rifle were at the show stage, but Mr. Rimes didn't see her. So where could Mr. Rimes have been at the time?)Blackquill:\nWright-dono, if you aren't up to the task... ...I could disprove this witness's testimony for you...Phoenix:\n(If I leave it to Prosecutor Blackquill, Sasha will be declared guilty. I can't let him interrupt this line of reasoning!)Athena:\nMr. Wright! Let's try to figure out how things looked when Rifle came to the show stage.Phoenix:\nMr. Rimes was at the show stage, keeping an eye on Orla and the sign.Athena:\nAnd we know it must be true, because he helped move the skull rock.Phoenix:\nAnd then Rifle came in and walked over the sign...Athena:\nBut wouldn't Mr. Rimes notice Rifle if he was right there?Phoenix:\nWell, let's think about where Mr. Rimes could have been... Is there a place in the show stage area from which Rifle couldn't have been seen?Present water\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What?! Inside the pool?\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nAthena:\nDo you really think he was there? That doesn't seem right to me, somehow...\nPhoenix:\nHmm. Now that you mention it, maybe you're right. \nAthena:\nCome on, Mr. Wright! We're all counting on you, here! Try to imagine yourself as a high-powered attorney!\nPhoenix:\nOkay, I'll do my best. (Um, what's with the \"imagine\" part?) Okay, let me try to figure out where Mr. Rimes must have been.\nLeads back to:\n\"Is there a place in the show stage area from which Rifle couldn't have been seen?\"Athena:\nWhat?! Inside the pool? But, you're right. If he was inside the pool, he wouldn't have noticed Rifle. So are you saying Mr. Rimes was underwater the whole time Rifle was eating?Phoenix:\nNo, not underwater. (When I think about what he was trying to do, the answer is clear. Now I'm finally starting to get the whole picture!)Blackquill:\nHmph. Just like yesterday... Must you two always be whispering to each other? Why don't you admit that resorting to a penguin will get you nowhere!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nOh, I don't know about that. The fact that Mr. Rimes didn't notice Rifle is such a small inconsistency... ...but it's a key point that proves what Mr. Rimes was trying to do.Blackquill:\nThe penguin is a \"key point\"?Phoenix:\nThe show stage pool is very deep. If Rifle came to visit while Mr. Rimes was at the bottom of this pool... ...he would have never noticed Rifle!Rimes:\n...Arrrrr!Phoenix:\nOrcas can be out of the water for a short time without sustaining damage. But if they're out of the water for a long time, they weaken and eventually die. In order to kill Orla, Mr. Rimes had to drain the pool. And while the pool was drained of water, Mr. Shipley fell to his death. The show stage pool is about sixty-five feet deep, just like the orca pool. (Changed from [The show stage pool is about 65 feet deep, just like the orca pool.] in the original release) Without water in the pool, a person could be made to fall sixty-five feet. (Changed from [Without water in the pool, a person could be made to fall 65 feet.] in the original release)Blackquill:\n............!Phoenix:\nMr. Rimes probably wondered what to do. If he continued with his plan to kill Orla, how would he dispose of Mr. Shipley's body? So he devised a plan to kill two birds with one stone.Judge:\nWhat? How...?Phoenix:\nMr. Rimes went down to the bottom of the pool and put the victim's body in the rock. He then had Ms. Buckler move the rock and the body together.Blackquill:Blackquill:\nAnd the witness made the defendant do this somehow without arousing her suspicion?!Phoenix:\nThat's right. Mr. Shipley told Ms. Buckler that she couldn't perform in the new show. Ms. Buckler became upset, and wanted to switch back to the old version of the show. So Mr. Rimes conveniently suggested that she take and hide a prop for the new show. Mr. Rimes then manipulated Orla, using her singing and lifesaver tricks. He schemed to have Orla find the body while Ms. DePlume would be standing witness. He saddled Orla with the false charge of murder so that Orla would be put down!Blackquill:\nWH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Rimes:\nArrrrr............! Raaaaarrr! GRAAAAAAAAARRR!Judge:\nSo the fact that the witness didn't see the penguin...?Phoenix:\n...Shows that when Rifle visited the show stage, Rimes was putting the body in the rock. At the bottom of the pool, that is.Judge:\nWho would have thought the presence of a penguin could prove the witness's actions!Phoenix:\n(It's working! Just a little further now and Sasha will be proven not guilty!)Blackquill:Blackquill:\nIf you think you've won this battle, you are sorely mistaken. Your theory is based on the notion that the witness could manipulate the orca. Witness, can you control the orca's actions?Rimes:\n............! Of course not. What kind of bilge be that? I be but a simple animal keeper!Judge:\nIf my memory serves... ...wasn't Ms. Buckler the only one who could issue commands to the orca?Phoenix:\n............Ugh...Blackquill:\nHmph. The judge's blade is sharper than the lawyer's. If you wish to do battle with a witness, you'll need a honed blade. Where is your sword of evidence that Marlon Rimes could manipulate the orca?!Phoenix:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! (Rimes had to have manipulated Orla in order for his plan to work. But how can I prove it?)Judge:\nWell, it appears this line of reasoning has become unsustainable...Athena:Judge:\nWell, it appears that I was mistaken...Phoenix:\nA-Athena?Athena:\nI've analyzed the hearts of all kinds of people. I have enough experience to see when I look into your heart that you haven't given up. So that objection was my way of speaking up for your heart!Phoenix:\n............! (She's right. Why would I become a lawyer again, only to give up? I have to keep fighting!) Athena, thank you. With your help, I've remembered the old \"Wright way.\"Athena:\nThe \"Wright way\"...?Phoenix:\nYour Honor! I'm not finished with presenting my argument!Judge:\nHmm. Do you have anything else to ask this witness?Blackquill:\nYou've cross-examined all the witnesses and presented all your evidence!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nAll the witnesses...? Hmm. I don't think so. I haven't cross-examined the most important one, the central figure in both cases.Blackquill:\nThe central figure...?Phoenix:\n(The one involved in not only the case a year ago, but this current case, too... I've never called her as a witness, but it's time to do so now!)Judge:\nWh-Who are you talking about? I demand you tell the court immediately! Who is this \"central figure\" in both cases?Present Ora Shipley profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The defense calls the central figure in both cases... Orla the orca!\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nBlackquill:\nIf that's your \"central figure,\" the one who holds the key to it all... ...then even Taka here could win a \"guilty\" verdict against you!\nPhoenix:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\nJudge:\nI have the final say over the verdict. Just as I have final say over assigning penalties.\nPhoenix:\n(Gah...! But there's no way I can give up now! There's one figure at the heart of both the case a year ago and this recent case... Even if this individual can't speak, she can still help me!)\nJudge:\nNow, Mr. Wright. Please give us a proper answer this time.\nLeads back to:\n\"Who is this \"central figure\" in both cases?\"Phoenix:\nThe defense calls the central figure in both cases... Orla the orca!Judge:\nY-You intend to cross-examine an orca?!Rimes:\nArr! Cross-examine an orca? Ye must be addled! It be impossible, says I!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nThis absurdity is beyond the pale. How do you expect to question an orca, a creature incapable of speech?!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nOrla is intricately involved in this case. I have every right to cross-examine her! Besides, even if she can't speak, I think cross-examining her will be invaluable!Blackquill:\nVery well! Do what you will, then! But if you fail to garner anything from this little exercise with the orca... ...I hope you realize the reward for your efforts will be the defendant's guilty verdict!Phoenix:\n............I'm ready and confident.Athena:\nSo... Cross-examining Orla, huh? That was a bold move, Boss. Now all we have to do is figure out how Mr. Rimes manipulated Orla!Phoenix:\nThat's right. Now it's Orla's turn to help us save Sasha!Judge:\nAn orca defendant yesterday, an orca witness today! This is truly unprecedented. But even though this is highly unusual, I'm prepared to allow it. Bailiff! Ready the witness telecast! We'll have a ten-minute recess while the telecast is being set up.To be continuedJuly 22, 11:21 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3Athena:\nLeave it to you to think of something like calling Orla, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nWell, she's the only one who knows all the answers, after all. I just talked to Pearls, and she said Orla seems to be feeling fine. Now we have to try and figure out how Mr. Rimes manipulated Orla.Athena:\nIf we put Mr. Rimes and Orla together, maybe we can get some kind of clue.Phoenix:\n(And I can't forget about that strange set of prints of Rimes's, either...)Buckler:\nI r-EEL-y appreciate your trying to save both Orla and me. I had no idea Marlon hated Orla like that... I feel like I've been shocked by a torpedo ray.DePlume:\nOf course he would hate the killer whale that murdered his girlfriend right in front of him!Athena:\nOh! Ms. DePlume! You've been watching the trial?DePlume:\nOh, yes! I came to make a declaration of war!Phoenix:\nA d-declaration of war...?DePlume:\nNo matter what the results of today's trial, I will report the truth in my new book. Even if that truth goes against what I wrote in \"The Killer Killer Whale.\"Crab:\nI don't know what the truth is... Not even about what happened a year ago...Phoenix:\nDr. Crab...Crab:\nAzura died right in front of my eyes, in the middle of a pirate show... She suddenly fell from the orca's back and began to thrash around in pain. The orca was singing a song, and then started head-butting Azura over and over. Finally, the orca took Azura in her mouth and brought her to the side of the pool. Just before she died, Azura was holding her chest, in obvious pain...Phoenix:\n(...She was holding her chest...? Wait a minute... Could it be...?) ...I don't think Orla was to blame for the incident a year ago, either.Crab:\nWhat?Phoenix:\nI think the cause of Ms. Summers's death might have been... ...her heart condition.Crab:\nHeart condition? What heart condition?! I never heard anything about it!Phoenix:\nMs. Summers had a prescription with Hickfield Clinic for a heart condition. The orca didn't kill her. I think it's possible her heart condition did!Buckler:\nWhat?! Azura had a heart condition, too?! I guess she hid it from everybody, just like I did...Crab:\n............! So that means... ...the orca was innocent a year ago, too!Phoenix:\nIt's just a theory, but... I think the orca head-butted Azura to check on her... ...and then did the lifesaver trick to rescue her.Crab:\n............So there was no need to put the orca down after all...?Phoenix:\nSo... you really did intend to put Orla down...?Crab:\n...No. Jack and I... ...were against such a thing from the start.Athena:\nB-But you said you were going to \"euthanize the orca\"!Phoenix:\n(Yeah... I've been wondering about that...) Dr. Crab... About this capsule... It's not a poison, but a sleeping drug, right...?Crab:\nThat's right. Even if Orla attacks someone... ...or even if the Center for Dangerous Animal Control demands she be put down... ...I never had any intention of killing her. I would use sleeping pills to make it look like she was dead, and then set her free. That's why I purchased so many sleeping capsules.Athena:\nOh! THAT'S why?DePlume:\n............! I never considered the possibility that that poor woman's death was illness...Phoenix:\n(She seems pretty disturbed to be wrong...)DePlume:\n............I simply want to know the truth. That is why I will tell you who my client is. The day I witnessed the owner's death, I was there at the request of the animal keeper.Phoenix:\nMarlon Rimes...?DePlume:\nThat is correct. That day, my client called me to ask me to investigate the orca pool.Athena:\nH-he must have wanted you to witness what Orla was going to do!Phoenix:\n...Why did you decide to tell us this?DePlume:\nMy desire to protect my client was standing in the way of the truth. I couldn't allow that. I will be watching to see how this all unfolds. Good luck to you, blue and yellow duo.Athena:\nWell, that was quite a bombshell she just dropped, and so casually, too.Phoenix:\n(That woman really is a free spirit.)Crab:\nDo you remember what you said yesterday, Mr. Lawyer? That you'd expose any secret if it would help save Sasha?Phoenix:\nI remember. It's my duty as a lawyer.Crab:\nWell, I just wanted you to know that I don't blame you for exposing the aquarium's secret. It may put me in hot water, but if it helps save the orca... Let me clue you in on another secret. Focus on the orca's song.Phoenix:\nThe orca's song, huh...? (What could he be hinting at?)Athena:\nOh, Mr. Wright! Looks like it's time!Phoenix:\nAll right.

Should I continue the cross-examination?)\n\n\n\nContinue cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBut I'm not finished with my cross-examination!\nBlackquill:\nHmph... You have just about exhausted my patience, Wright-dono!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! Please finish as quickly as you can!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... But I'm not really sure how to continue, to tell the truth...\nAthena:\nMr. Rimes had to have commanded Orla somehow! \nPhoenix:\nHmm. Do we have anything in evidence he could've used...? (With Orla, it's not like I can present evidence that contradicts a particular statement... Guess it doesn't matter which statement... Hmm. What could be used to command Orla?)\nJudge:\nWitness, please continue with your testimony!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nStop here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm done playing games! I will now explain how Orla was manipulated by Mr. Rimes! (In order to respond to a command, Orla needs to hear the sound of a whistle. But Mr. Rimes isn't a trainer. I doubt he'd know how to give the signals himself. So that means... he must've had help! So how did Mr. Rimes issue commands to Orla...?)\n\n\n\nPresent TV Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Sasha told me an interesting story about Ms. Summers...\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nBlackquill:\nI'm weary of this comedy of errors. Your Baldness, bring down your hammer of justice!\nJudge:\nHmm. I agree that evidence seems patently wrong. I enjoyed the comedy of errors, myself, but I must give you a penalty, Mr. Wright.\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. No verdict yet?\nPhoenix:\n(Rimes isn't a trainer. I doubt he'd know how to give Orla signals with a whistle himself. So that means... he must've had help! I'd better rethink this...)\nLeads back to:\n\"What should I do? Should I continue the cross-examination?\"Present TV Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Sasha told me an interesting story about Ms. Summers...\"Phoenix:\nIf I could actually communicate with Orla, this case would be solved in an instant.Athena:\nEven if we can't understand what she's saying, at least we can understand her heart! If we can just figure out how Mr. Rimes commanded her, I'm sure Orla will confirm it!Phoenix:\n(How did Mr. Rimes make Orla do those tricks...? We have to find the answer somehow!)Phoenix:\n(Sasha told me an interesting story about Ms. Summers...)Buckler:\nAzura used to send her boyfriend videos of herself teaching the orca tricks. I used to help Azura take the videos on her TV phone.Phoenix:\n(Most likely, Mr. Rimes still has these videos of Ms. Summers.) ...Ms. Fey, could I ask for your help?Pearl:\nOf course, Mr. Nick. What is it?Phoenix:\nYou're using Mr. Rimes's TV phone, correct? I'd like you to examine it for me. Please look for videos of Azura Summers issuing whistle commands to Orla.Pearl:\nUm... videos...? I'm not too sure how to do that, but I'll give it a try... My apologies to Marlon...Blackquill:\nWright-dono... what are you up to?Phoenix:\nYou'll see in a moment. (If Pearls can find those videos for me!)Pearl:\nMr. Nick! I found them! I found some videos like you described.Phoenix:\nYou did? Thank you, Ms. Fey! (Just as I suspected!) How did Marlon Rimes get Orla to do those tricks? I will now show you... ...with Mr. Rimes's cell phone!Blackquill:\nHis cell phone?! Are you implying he used an app?!Phoenix:\nMs. Fey, see if you can issue Orla a command.Pearl:\nMe? Can I do such a thing?Phoenix:\nYou might be able to, if you play a video with a whistle signal in it. If there's a video of the lifesaver trick, please play that. Before you do, though, please put the practice dummy in the pool.Pearl:\nThe practice dummy? All right... In it goes! ...There. It sank to the bottom. Now I'll play a video.Orla:\nFweet!Pearl:\nOrla is diving down, heading straight for the dummy!Orla:\nFwe fweet!Pearl:\nHee hee! What a smart girl you are, Orla! The lifesaver trick was a complete success, Mr. Nick!Phoenix:\nThank you, Ms. Fey. You were a big help. (Now I have proof!)Blackquill:\nHmph... Unbelievable! You actually pulled it off...Judge:\nThat was... the lifesaver trick we saw yesterday! Is Ms. Fey an orca trainer now?!Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor. I'll explain after we try one more trick. Now let's see if we can command Orla to do the singing trick. ...Ms. Fey. If there's a video of the singing trick, please play that.Pearl:\nCertainly! ...Let's see. Is it this video?Orla:\nFweet! Fwe fwe fweet. Fwe fwe fwe fweeet! Fwe fwe fwe fweet fwe fwe fweet! Fwe fwe fweet, fwe fwe fweeet! Fwe fwe fwe fweet fwe fwe fwe fweet!Pearl:\nOh my! Isn't she wonderful! That was the Swashbuckler Spectacular song!Judge:\nHo ho. What a lovely singing voice!Blackquill:\nHmph............ It wasn't bad.Judge:\nBy the way, how did Ms. Fey give the orca those commands?Phoenix:\nMarlon Rimes has something on his phone that his girlfriend, Azura Summers, sent him. They're videos of Ms. Summers issuing commands to Orla with a whistle. If they have Orla listen to the sounds of the signals, anyone at all could command Orla!Judge:\nOh, my! Anyone at all?!Phoenix:\nYes, I believe so, Your Honor. All they would have to do is play those videos.Judge:\nMr. Wright! Please submit those videos as evidence!Phoenix:\n(I'm getting the sneaking suspicion the judge just wants to try it out for himself...) Ms. Fey, could you send those videos to the TV phone here?Pearl:\nAll right. Certainly!Athena:\n...Got them! All right, I'll try playing one.Anime cutscenePhoenix:\n(So this was a training session a year ago, huh? But wait a minute... There's something about that song that bothers me...)TV Phone updated in the Court Record.Judge:\nIf the orca can be commanded using videos on a cell phone... ...then that means that Marlon Rimes could have manipulated the creature!Rimes:\nArrrrrrrrrr!Phoenix:\nMr. Rimes! You can't talk your way out of it now!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nHmph............ I have to commend you. That was very good proof. I concede Marlon Rimes could have manipulated the orca. But isn't it true that the defendant could have done it as well? All she would have to do is use the whistle, the whistle she knows how to use so well. And she wouldn't have had to use those videos... Surely you admit it's a possibility? She could have easily had Norma DePlume witness the singing and the lifesaver trick!Phoenix:\n(So he's trying to argue it was equally possible for Sasha as it was for Rimes, is he? But is that true? Let me think about that for a minute...)DePlume:\nThat's right! Those weren't just simple cries. It was singing! As I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing! It kept head-butting while it sang the Swashbuckler Spectacular song!Phoenix:\n(The culprit made sure Ms. DePlume heard the song and saw the lifesaver trick. Could Sasha have shown these two tricks to the witness?)She could have\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs Prosecutor Blackquill said... Ms. Buckler could have shown these tricks as well.\nBlackquill:\n...Just as I claimed! And isn't it much more natural to assume that it was the defendant who did it?!\nPhoenix:\n............Huh? \nJudge:\nHmm, yes. It does appear that way to me, too.\nPhoenix:\n...W-Wait! Can I take that back?! Please let me have a do-over!\nJudge:\n\"Take it back\"?! \"Do-over\"?! Mr. Wright, are you trying to make a mockery of my court? \nPhoenix:\n(...But hold on. Could Sasha really have created those exact same conditions?) But, come to think of it, I doubt Ms. Buckler could have produced those exact conditions. \nBlackquill:\nAnd on what basis do you make that claim?! Show your sword if you want to challenge me!\nLeads to:\n\"Don't you worry...\"She couldn't have\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, I don't think Ms. Buckler could have created the same conditions as the culprit.\nBlackquill:\nYou challenge me to a battle? I hope your sword is sharpened... Let me see those sword skills of yours!\nLeads to:\n\"Don't you worry...\"Phoenix:\n(Don't you worry... My sword is drawn and ready! My sword is... evidence that the two tricks couldn't have been shown at the same time!)Present Whistle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. DePlume said in her testimony that she witnessed these two tricks at the same time.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nBlackquill:\n...What, pray tell, is that?\nPhoenix:\n(...Maybe if I just don't say anything, it'll all work out somehow...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Are you giving us your best imitation of Prosecutor Blackquill?! Speak up and give the court your answer!\nPhoenix:\n............\nJudge:\n...I see. Silence, is it? Then I will reward your silence with a penalty. \nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess it didn't \"all work out somehow\"... Ms. DePlume said she saw these two tricks at the same time. But didn't I have a piece of evidence that contradicts that possibility? I think my sword is finally ready now...)\nLeads back to:\n\"My sword is... evidence that the two tricks couldn't have been shown at the same time!\"Phoenix:\nMs. DePlume said in her testimony that she witnessed these two tricks at the same time. However, that fact is inconsistent with how Orla performs tricks.Blackquill:\nHow Orla performs tricks? What are you talking about?Phoenix:\nOrla can't perform two tricks at once. She performs only one trick per whistle signal. That's how she's been trained.Judge:\nHmm. In other words, it would be just like, with a dog... ...if you tell him to both \"sit\" and \"shake,\" he won't do them at the same time. Am I understanding it correctly?Phoenix:\nYes, that's the idea, Your Honor. (I wonder if the judge has a dog?)Blackquill:\nHeh heh heh heh heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! What a farce! So are you saying that the witness somehow managed to produce an impossible scenario?Rimes:\nArr! If the creature's own trainer couldn't do it, how could I?!Phoenix:\n............ Yes, it's a mystery, isn't it?Athena: \nB-Boss, you don't have to agree so cheerfully...Blackquill:\nThe defense is claiming that Marlon Rimes manipulated the orca... ...but if you cannot explain fully how this was done, your argument doesn't hold water! If you can't straighten out your own theory, would you like me to straighten you out?!Phoenix:\nUm... no, thank you!Athena:\nHmm. So Orla can't do two tricks at a time, but Ms. DePlume saw her do it... This logical inconsistency means there's a flaw somewhere.Phoenix:\nWas Ms. DePlume lying...? Or is it not true that Orla can't do two tricks at a time..?Athena:\nBut Ms. DePlume had no reason to lie about such a thing.Phoenix:\nIf it really is impossible for Orla to perform two tricks at once... ...then maybe either the lifesaver trick or the singing trick was... faked?Blackquill:\n\"Faked\"...?Phoenix:\nYes. Maybe Orla only performed one of the tricks... ...but it was made to look like she performed two!Blackquill:Blackquill:\n\"Maybe\"?! How do you expect to conduct a sword battle with conjecture?!Phoenix:\n(Sounds like I'd better present some evidence here, and fast.)Judge:\nAlthough I am concerned about your profuse sweating, Mr. Wright, allow me to ask you... Which of the two was faked, the lifesaver trick, or the singing trick?The lifesaver trick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe lifesaver trick was faked!\nBlackquill:\nThe security footage plainly shows the orca performing the lifesaver trick. Norma DePlume also stated in her testimony that the orca was singing. There's no indication that either one of these tricks was \"faked\"!\nPhoenix:\n............Gah. \nJudge:\nThe defense appears to be at a loss for words. \nPhoenix:\n(But Sasha said that Orla couldn't perform two tricks at once. If the lifesaver trick is clearly shown on the security footage... ...then that means...)\nJudge:\nAllow me to ask you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"Which of the two was faked, the lifesaver trick, or the singing trick?\"The song\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The defense wishes to argue that the singing trick was faked.\"They were both faked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSurprisingly enough, they were BOTH faked!\nBlackquill:\nIf that's true... then what was the orca doing?\nPhoenix:\n...What? Oh, um, she was performing some other trick!\nBlackquill:\nThe singing trick was faked. The lifesaver trick was faked. Are your qualifications as a lawyer also faked?\nJudge:\nYes, I'm beginning to wonder about that point, myself. \nPhoenix:\n(Orla was obviously performing some kind of trick. But which of the two was faked, the lifesaver trick, or the singing trick?)\nJudge:\nAllow me to ask you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"Which of the two was faked, the lifesaver trick, or the singing trick?\"Phoenix:\nThe defense wishes to argue that the singing trick was faked.Judge:\nAnd on what grounds do you base your assertion that the singing trick was faked?Present Swashbuckler Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is a recording of a recent Swashbuckler Spectacular.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nThat item proves the singing trick was faked?\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor. This piece of evidence will not prove that. In other words... this piece of evidence is... a fake-out! And if this evidence is a fake-out, then the singing trick was a fake-out as well!\nAthena:\nBoss, I don't think that makes any sense...\nPhoenix:\nMomentum is key at times like these. \nJudge:\nI can hear every word you're saying, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm still confident it was the singing trick that was faked. Wasn't somebody looking at something and saying the songs were different...?)\nJudge:\nI ask you once again, Mr. Wright...\nLeads back to:\n\"And on what grounds do you base your assertion that the singing trick was faked?\"Phoenix:\nThis is a recording of a recent Swashbuckler Spectacular. In this recording, Orla sings the same song she sang for Ms. Fey earlier. But Ms. DePlume said this song is different from the one that was sung a year ago. (Changed from [But Ms. DePlume said this song is different from the one sang a year ago.] in the original release)Judge:\nThe song is different...?Phoenix:\nPlease listen to the song in the video from a year ago, sent to this cell phone.Orla:\nFwe fweet!

(Changed from [Fweet! Fweet! Fwe fweet! Fwe fwe fwe fweet!] in the original release)Judge:\nHmm, yes. It sounds quite different from the song Orla sang for Ms. Fey earlier.Phoenix:\nAnd yet, this is the same video Ms. Fey used to issue the command to Orla to sing. By having Ms. DePlume listen to the song recorded in the cell phone video... ...the true culprit made Ms. DePlume think Orla was singing the song from a year ago! Only Marlon Rimes, the owner of the cell phone videos, could have done this!Blackquill:Blackquill:\nBut Ms. DePlume said she heard the orca singing right in front of her! How do you claim he made her think that? How was the song recording played?!Phoenix:\n...I intend to explain that, too, of course.Blackquill:\nWhat...?!Phoenix:\nThe answer lies somewhere in the orca pool visitor's corridor.

How could anyone play a song recording with that?!\nPhoenix:\nWell... he could have used it with some kind of... thing, and played it... somehow...\nBlackquill:\nThat \"somehow\" is what I'm asking you to explain!\nJudge:\nYour ambiguous answer has earned you a very unambiguous penalty, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(So where DID he play the song recording from...? There's only one answer...) Prosecutor Blackquill! This time, I'll explain how the song recording was played properly.\nLeads back to:\n\"Marlon Rimes played the song recording by using this!\"Phoenix:\nMs. DePlume heard the song while she was in the orca pool visitor's corridor. There's a speaker in that corridor, so that visitors can hear the orca's sounds.Blackquill:\nAnd you claim the song was played from that speaker?

Maybe we'll find a place we can break through somewhere.After pressing third statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\nHmm, we tried pressing him, but it didn't change anything.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I don't know about that... His statements might not have changed, but the meaning of one of them may have...\nAthena:\nReally?! You caught something?!\nPhoenix:\n(And that one statement just might be the breakthrough we need!)"

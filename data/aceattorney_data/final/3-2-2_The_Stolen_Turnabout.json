You can clean the toilet later! This is important!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* What are you freaking out about now?\nMaya:\nHey hee. Today will be the last time you talk to me that way!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nWe're about to hit the big time!\nPhoenix:\n\"Big time\"? And what do you mean by \"we\"? You don't mean you and me are...?\nMaya:\nHa! Don't be silly. I'm talking about me and Pearly, of course!\nPearl:\nHello. It's a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nPearls!

You can laugh all you want... But you'll be singing another tune tonight!\nPhoenix:\nTonight? What about tonight?\nPearl:\nThe \"Treasures of Kurain\" exhibit doesn't actually start until next week, but... ...the promoter sent us some special VIP entry passes!\nMaya:\nThat's why I dressed up extra special today! What do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Heh. Same Maya. Different day.) This young lady here is Maya Fey... The younger sister of Mia Fey... ...My friend and mentor. I first met her two years ago... I was working on the case surrounding Mia's death, and ever since then...\nMaya:\nI've been the one who's been keeping this law office afloat from behind the scenes.\nPhoenix:\nActually that's just a cover for her true identity... In reality, she's a spirit medium, and a bit of a shady character.\nMaya:\nHey! Who are you calling \"shady\"!?\nPhoenix:\nAnd this little girl is Pearl Fey, but I usually call her \"Pearls\". She's Maya's cousin and a spirit medium in training herself.\nPearl:\nI know I'm a bit young, but I want to help in any way I can, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nKurain Village is the home of the mysterious Kurain Channelling Technique. And Maya here is the daughter of the Kurain School of Channeling's Master. ...I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's no joke. I've seen her power with my own eyes... It's the real thing alright.\nMaya:\nEarth to Nick! How long are you going to make two gorgeous women like us wait!?\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! I can't wait any longer!

Shall we head upstairs, then?\nPhoenix: \nAfter that pleasant evening, all that remained was to wait for the exhibition's opening. It was wonderful seeing Ms. Andrews looking so happy.

Bad guy, huh.\n???: \nHey! You can't poke around here, pal!\nPhoenix: \nWait a minute... that voice. Oh no! Not him again!\n???: \nIt's YOU!! And I'm the one who should be saying \"not again\"!

What are you doing hanging around here?\nPhoenix: \nHey, I asked you first. Why are you here any--\nMaya: \nAlright, alright, we got it!

I guess so... In a way...\n???:\nUmm...\nMaya:\nI'm so used to thinking of the victim as a dead person 'cause we're always on murder cases.\n???:\nEx-Excuse me...\nMaya:\nBut anyway!

Can I ask you something, Nicky boy?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nDesirée:\nI know I may seem like a \"bad girl\" on the outside...

Nobody knows more about the thief than me, pal! It's true! I'm a... Zvarri...! \"Author on thieves\"!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nAn \"author\"...? He's written books about thieves?\nPhoenix:\nUm, I think he probably meant to say \"authority\".\nGumshoe:\nThe fact that this guy can slip through even my fingers shows how good he is, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(It's easy when those fingers happen to be \"butter fingers\"...)\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo nobody knows more about the thief than you, huh...?\nGumshoe:\nYou got it, pal! Except maybe for the thief's mom, that is!\nPhoenix:\nBut isn't there someone who knows even more about him than the police?\nGumshoe:\nYou don't mean... \"Detective Zvarri\", do you?\nJudge:\nHmm... Who is this person? Zvarri? He sounds German...\nGumshoe:\nHis name is Luke Atmey, sir. I guess I shouldn't have made up such a silly name for him.\nPhoenix:\n(What the heck? I guess he's not all that famous after all...)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, it's true that he did manage to retrieve the last item the thief stole.\nJudge:\n...Oh, I see. It seems you're not the expert you claim to be.\nGumshoe:\n...Urk! I-It looks like the thief is playing with me, even now!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(The real \"authority\" on the thief is the other detective. I don't need to ask this one any more questions...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nHe's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHave you seen all of these so-called \"calling cards\"?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I have. Except... The person in charge of the Treasure Exhibit never brought their card to the police... So I didn't see this one until after the crime occurred.\nMaya:\nThat's because Detective Atmey stopped Ms. Andrews from taking it to the police.\nJudge:\nWas the calling card that Lordly Tailor received authentic?\nGumshoe:\nWell, all the cards have one common, identifying feature. But we're not releasing that information to the general public...\nJudge:\nBut you're absolutely certain that this card is real?\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe can't say it out loud but I bet he's talking about Mask\u2606DeMasque's emblem...)Gumshoe:\nThis was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHis fifth heist... And your fifth screw up, huh?\nGumshoe:\nObjection, pal! That ain't fair! Maybe you could say I screwed up four times! But this last time wasn't my fault! I didn't know about the calling card this time!\nPhoenix:\n(You of all people shouldn't be chuckling about this, Detective Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nI just want everyone here in the courtroom to know something! If you ever get a calling card from this guy, don't call some stupid private eye! Call your local police right away. Got me?\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like he's really got it in for Detective Atmey.Gumshoe:\nHis pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nArt pieces? Like what, for example?\nGumshoe:\nWell, his first target was the famous \"Tear of Emanon\".\nJudge:\nWhat's that? Some kind of especially salty teardrop?\nGumshoe:\nN-No, sir. It's a blue diamond. A single, rare diamond. Next was the \"Crown of Bongora\"... You know, the thing you put on your head. After that was the \"Left Hand of Hades\" and then the \"Portrait of Mejeena\", sir. Detective Atmey retrieved the \"Portrait of Mejeena\" and returned it to the museum.\nPhoenix:\nAnd the target of his fifth and last robbery was the \"Sacred Urn\"... right?\nJudge:\nBut isn't it difficult for him to dispose of such famous art pieces...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we assume he must have some underworld connections.\nMaya:\nSomehow, Mr. DeLite doesn't look the type...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, he's a little too sunny to be hanging out in the underworld...)Present Sacred Urn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"Gumshoe:\nThat's why we're sure it was Mask\u2606DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean when you say, \"it fits his M. O. to a T\"?\nJudge:\nI was thinking of asking the same thing myself.\nGumshoe:\nUgh... I wish you would listen a little more closely, pal. First of all, there's the calling card. We're 100% certain it's authentic. Then there's the fact that he seemed to know all about the security system. And finally, his target was an art piece. These are all part of the thief's modus operandi.\nJudge:\nAnd so, since this robbery seems to fit all those conditions...?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right! It means that Mask\u2606DeMasque is behind it!Present Sacred Urn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"Maya:\nNick! It definitely looks like it was Mask\u2606DeMasque who stole the urn!Phoenix:\nBut there's no real evidence either way as to whether Ron DeLite is Mask\u2606DeMasque.Maya:\nBut... But...Phoenix:\nAlso, the urn hasn't turned up yet, let alone in connection to Mr. DeLite himself.Maya:\nSo even though we know it was Mask\u2606DeMasque that did it...Phoenix:\n(Maybe for the time being, I should try to show it wasn't Mask\u2606DeMasque that did it!)Phoenix:\n...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?Gumshoe:\n...Just hearing the \"little\" in that question is making me nervous.Phoenix:\nYou said that he always \"goes after the most precious art pieces\", right?Gumshoe:\nThat's right, pal.Phoenix:\nBut there's one problem... That's not what he did in this case. The supposedly \"priceless\" urn doesn't exactly rise to the level of \"precious art\"!Gumshoe:\nWh-What do you mean!?Maya:\nN-Nick! How can you say such a terrible thing!?Phoenix:\nNo! I meant from a financial point of view! I mean, it wouldn't fetch a good price.Judge:\nWell, Prosecutor Godot? What is the value of that urn?Godot:\nThe appraisers I spoke to said they couldn't attach a price to it. And I mean that in the worst sense.Phoenix:\nSo in other words... It was not the kind of item that Mask\u2606DeMasque would normally go after!Gumshoe:\nUrk!Judge:\nHmm... If I understand you correctly, Mr. Wright... ...you're saying that the theft of the Sacred Urn was not the work of Mask\u2606DeMasque...!Phoenix:\nY-Yes... That's what I'm saying. (Actually all I did was point out the contradiction. The argument made itself, but...)Judge:\nWell... First of all, we need to get this issue cleared up. Was this last robbery the work of Mask\u2606DeMasque or not? What do you have to say about this, Mr. Godot?Godot:\nThis coffee here... It's my own special blend. I call it Godot #107. I'm trying to decide whether to cut down on the acidity or the bitterness... That's the only thing I've got on my mind right now... ...Mr. Trite!Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Godot:\nIf you're really a man, you should clean up your own mess.Phoenix:\nUmm... Sorry, but I didn't get what you mean.Godot:\nIf you're saying it wasn't Mask\u2606DeMasque that stole the urn... ...then it must be someone imitating Mask\u2606DeMasque's methods... A fake.Judge:\nA-A Fake\u2606DeMasque?Maya:\nFake\u2606DeMasque? That sounds so ridiculous. ...But I like it.Godot:\nNow, before I decide on my coffee, I believe some proof is in order, Mr. Trite. Proof that the person who appeared at Lordly Tailor that night was actually a fake.Judge:\nHmm... Though I don't approve of Mr. Godot's behavior, his point is valid. Mr. Wright. ...We're waiting.Phoenix:\n(It looks like I'm going to have to prove it... I need proof that the person at Lordly Tailor that night was in fact, Fake\u2606DeMasque!)Present Security Camera Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The proof is right here.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWhat is this evidence supposed to prove?\nGodot:\nHa...! Well, it proves someone here is a fake alright. ...It proves that this lawyer is a fake.\nPhoenix:\n(These prosecutors sure know how to twist the knife...)\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be impressed! Think it over again! When he stole the urn, his photo was taken, right? Who knows? Maybe there's something on there that shows he's a fake...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Is she talking about that photo we got from Atmey?)\nJudge:\nAre you ready yet, Mr. Wright? \nLeads back to:\n\"It looks like I'm going to have to prove it...\"Phoenix:\nThe proof is right here.Judge:\nThis looks like... a photo taken by a security camera.Phoenix:\nBut if you look closely... you'll notice something peculiar about it.Godot:\nHa...! Well then, why don't you go ahead and show us what it is. Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".Present front of DeMasque's neck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's right here, of course!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's right here. ...I think.\nJudge:\nIs that what was so \"peculiar\"?\nGodot:\nHa...! The place that you're pointing to is all wrong.\nPhoenix:\nWh... What do you mean!\nGodot:\nThe only thing \"peculiar\" in this courtroom... is on top of your head.\nMaya:\nNick! Are you going to let him get away making fun of your hair!?\nPhoenix:\n(Yes... At least until I know he can't use his goggles to fry me or something...) W-Well anyway! There is a strange spot in this photo!\nGodot:\nHa...! Still haven't given up? So what is it then?\nLeads back to:\n\"Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".\"Phoenix:\nIt's right here, of course!Judge:\nYou mean... Mask\u2606DeMasque?Phoenix:\nI have here a piece of reference I would like the court to take a look at.Maya:\nIsn't that the publicity photo I bought this morning...?Phoenix:\nThe problem I have with the security camera photo is the broach on DeMasque's chest.Judge:\nA Breach? Here!? Bailiff! Get my steed! We need to retreat at once!Phoenix:\n...A broach, Your Honor. It's a sort of clasp for holding one's cape on.Judge:\nA clasp, eh... Ah! I see now!Gumshoe:\nBut the Mask\u2606DeMasque in the security camera photo... Ahh!! He has no broach!!Phoenix:\nThat broach is the same as the emblem on DeMasque's calling card and serves as his symbol. But the thief that broke into Lordly Tailor wasn't wearing a broach... In other words, this \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\" is a fake!Gumshoe:\n...! I-I've been fooled agaaaaaain!Judge:\nO-Order! It's true... Undeniably true... Detective Gumshoe! How... How could you have overlooked this!?Gumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! I don't know how I...Godot:\nHey now... ...If you're gonna have a pity party, invite me, too!Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot! You deserve some blame in this, too! How could you have overlooked such a large broach...?Godot:\nHa...! The broach you're talking about... Do you mean this?Gumshoe:\nAh...!Phoenix:\nTh-That's...! Mask\u2606DeMasque's broach!Judge:\nWh-Where did you find it!?Godot:\nWell I've always had a good nose for evidence... I got it at the crime scene. It was hidden in the shadow of a big female Buddha statue.Phoenix:\n(\"Buddha statue\"...? He must mean the Ami Fey statue.)Gumshoe:\nWh-Why didn't you tell me about that, sir!?Godot:\n...I always put evidence away in my pocket. ...After all, it's the safest place for crucial evidence.Maya:\nGrrr... This guy is one cool customer.Godot:\nIt's a little early to be shaken up, isn't it, little lady? ...That friend of yours left pretty little hickeys on there, too.Judge:\nH-Hickeys?Godot:\nFiguratively speaking, of course... I'm referring to Ron DeLite's fingerprints.Gumshoe:\nWhaaa...?Judge:\nWhat!? The defendant's fingerprints are on the broach!? Order! Order in the court! Mr. Godot! Let's see that broach!Godot:\nI've grown attached to my metallic girlfriend here. ...Take good care of her.Judge:\nHmm... She-- I mean, it appears to have been torn off some clothing. There's a little bit of cloth left on the back.Godot:\nObviously there must have been a big struggle that night at the crime scene.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh... Phoenix, we have a problem...)DeMasque's Broach added to the Court Record.Godot:\nHa...! You mess with Godot... ...and you get burned.Phoenix:\n(Grr... He's been playing me like a violin...)Godot:\nWell Judge, I'm about ready to call my next witness.Gumshoe:\nHuh? You're done with me? But I haven't proved anything yet.Godot:\nYou've proven your own incompetence. That's good enough.Gumshoe:\n...That doesn't sound good at all.Judge:\nBailiff! Bring the next witness into the courtroom!Phoenix:\n(Finally time for the Ace Detective to make his appearance, huh...?)Godot:\nOne second is one drip of the coffee pot. Let's hurry it up.Atmey:\nSHHH! SILENCE!... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.Judge:\nWh-What's clear?Atmey:\n...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! What we have here is... A judge and a prosecutor. ...A coffee maniac, at that! ...Am I correct?Judge:\nW-Well, yes. That's right.Godot:\nHa...! Not bad. Not bad at all. You're the first person that's ever been able to penetrate my secret veil.Atmey:\nWell, Sir Prosecutor. Let me introduce myself. My name is Luke Atmey, Ace Detective and rising star illuminating the heavens.Maya:\nBoy, these two make a perfect pair...Phoenix:\nThey'd either be best friends or they'd tear each other's heads off.Judge:\nI've heard that on the night of the crime, you were all alone on security detail.Atmey:\n...You have heard correctly. My specially-made monocle is worth more than a hundred Detective Gumshoes. ...If Detective Gumshoe was worth anything, that is.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Why was this guy all by himself anyway...? There must be some reason. I'm sure of it!)Judge:\nWell then, tell us what this special monocle of yours witnessed!Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Atmey:\nIt was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.\nThat's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask\u2606DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!\nJust as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!\nDarkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.\nThirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!Judge:\nSo you didn't get a clear look at the criminal?Atmey:\nMy specially-made monocle never misses a thing. However! That is limited to things that fall within my own visual range! But of course, that's only natural.Judge:\n...I fall to see why the witness seems so proud of his performance that evening.Atmey:\nWell, Sir Old-Timer, let me explain. We are not speaking of any ordinary thief... ...but of the kings of thieves! The great Mask\u2606DeMasque, my arch-enemy! That is what my instincts and my years of experience tell me!Judge:\nHmm...

Where exactly were you at the time?\nAtmey:\nA penetrating question! I was in the basement warehouse, near the computer.\nPhoenix:\n(Near the computer, huh...)\nJudge:\nSo then you weren't trying to remain hidden, I take it?\nAtmey:\nUp to this point, I have tried to remain concealed while waiting for the thief...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, he said the same thing yesterday, too.)\nMaya:\nGumshoe also said that he never saw him at the crime scene...\nAtmey:\nPrecisely! That is precisely why I chose NOT to hide last night. I knew that by NOT concealing myself, I would be putting pressure on the thief.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like the thief was the one applying pressure... On your pidgeony head, that is.)\nAtmey:\nIn any case!Atmey:\nThat's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask\u2606DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Dancingly descended\"...? From where exactly?\nAtmey:\nWell... From the entrance, I suppose. Where else?\nPhoenix:\n(So in actuality, he neither \"danced\" nor \"descended\"! ...Someone please save me.) Um... So how is it that you didn't notice the thief?\nAtmey:\nMy eyes were looking for the thief's shadow while my ears listened for his footfalls. But even so, the dastardly criminal managed to sneak up on me... It can only be due to his subtly camouflaged cape and soft-soled shoes.\nPhoenix:\n(... I hereby dub you \"Ace Dunce\".)Atmey:\nJust as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't see the criminal's face when that happened?\nAtmey:\n...Well, that's difficult part. How should I put it... I saw his mask... That's all that I can recall.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's not very solid as far as testimony goes.\nAtmey:\nHowever... Fortunately I had my third monocle, the security camera, at the ready. It captured his image perfectly... This should be sufficient, I believe?\nJudge:\nHmm, well, as long as this photo is authentic, I don't see a problem here. Well, Mr. Godot? Do you have a problem with the photo? Good. Then let's continue with the testimony.Present DeMasque's Broach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Mr. Atmey.\"Atmey:\nDarkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike.

There's certainly some very impressive detective work.\nAtmey:\nHmph! Well, Sir Lawyer! Have you ever been suddenly struck on the head?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? W-Well.. Actually, yes. By a fire extinguisher.\nAtmey:\nAnd what happened?\nPhoenix:\n...I-I was knocked out.\nMaya:\nAnd you lost your memory, too!\nAtmey:\nYou see? You have no right to look down on me then, do you? The only reason I didn't lose my memory was because I have more brains to begin with.\nPhoenix:\n(He may have brains, but the wiring to the self-reflection part seems to be served...)\nAtmey:\nIn any case, that was how I was knocked senseless. And then...Present DeMasque's Broach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Mr. Atmey.\"Atmey:\nThirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout this \"30 minutes\"...\nAtmey:\nMy silver cord was loosened and my soul fled to the Golden Halls of Elysium...\nMaya:\nAs usual, I have no idea what this guy is saying.\nPhoenix:\nI think he's saying that he was out cold.\nJudge:\nSo... What happened during these 30 minutes?\nAtmey:\nNo one can say, Your Honor... That span of time has truly vanished into the ether!\nPhoenix:\n(Just what is he going on about!?)Maya:\nThere's something suspicious about Detective Atmey... How could he not have noticed when the thief came in?Phoenix:\nAlso, he says he was knocked unconscious before he could fight back... But that can't be right. It contradicts the evidence.Maya:\nHuh? Which piece...?Phoenix:\n(The real question is... Why would he tell such an obvious lie?)Phoenix:\n...Mr. Atmey. Could you take a look at this with that special monocle of yours?Atmey:\nAha! This belongs to the criminal mastermind, my arch-nemesis, Mask\u2606DeMasque! It is, in point of fact, Mask\u2606DeMasque's broach!Phoenix:\nIt was found on the floor of the basement warehouse. I wonder how that happened?Atmey:\nHa... Elementary, my dear lawyer. Obviously it wasn't glued on well enough.Phoenix:\nNot quite. It clearly shows signs of having been ripped off a piece of clothing.Judge:\nRipped off...? Aha!Phoenix:\n...We can only deduce that the thief struggled with someone that night! That's the only thing I can think of. And there's only one person that was in a position to have a struggle with the thief. The only person that was on security duty that night...You, Detective Atmey!Atmey:\n...Urk!Phoenix:\nDetective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief that night! (Changed from [Detective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief last night!] in the original release) So, why did you lie in your testimony to the court?Judge:\nWitness! Giving false testimony is a serious crime!Atmey:\nErr, I... N-No! W-Wait just a moment, Sir Old-Timer!Judge:\nDon't talk to me like I'm living in a nursing home!Atmey:\nHee hee hee he he he... I just remembered, Your Honor. I was just confused because I've been dealing with so many cases lately.Godot:\nThe true measure of a man is in the amount of work he does. That's what I always say.Maya:\nNick, you can only handle one case at a time... Isn't that right?Phoenix:\nYou talk too much.Judge:\nWitness! So are you now saying that you and the thief fought?Godot:\nHold on. That's quite enough... Your Honor.Judge:\nE-Excuse me...?Godot:\nSave the big questions for the testimony. That's one of my rules.Atmey:\nIndeed! I understand! I, Luke Atmey, agree completely!Witness Testimony-- Fight With The Thief --Atmey:\nIndeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.\nHowever... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!\nUnfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.\nA true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.\nHis first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.Judge:\nSo in the end, you did catch a glimpse of Mask\u2606DeMasque?Atmey:\nCorrect. It was during his third crime that he struck me from behind. It seems that my memory has become a tad jumbled, so to speak.Judge:\nHmmm... Well, that's certainly understandable.

The alarm on one of those had gone off, so I had to check the data. That's why I went to the computer! ...Elegantly, of course!\nPhoenix:\nSo you were momentarily vulnerable when you were working on the computer? (What should I do? Should I ask some more questions...?)\n\n\n\nThat's enough\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Well, we know for sure that Atmey looked away from the door. I think I should ask about something else now...) Alright. So you looked away from the door. ...And then?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAbout the sensor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of sensors are you talking about?\nAtmey:\nThere are other places in the basement that someone could enter and exit from. There are air conditioner ducts, sewer pipes... And a cat door as well. I hooked up heat-detecting, infrared and ultra-violet sensors to each of them.\nPhoenix:\nThat's a lot of hardware... Was it all yours?\nAtmey:\nLordly Tailor Department Store was kind enough to provide the monitoring hardware. Naturally, the security camera that look the photo belongs to them as well.\nPhoenix:\n(In other words, he couldn't have rigged the equipment, huh...?)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... Has that cleared up any doubts you had about me, Sir Lawyer?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAbout the computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo did that computer belong to Lordly Tailor as well?\nAtmey:\nCorrect. Well, except for the program that manages the data. That was specially designed by me, Luke Atmey!\nPhoenix:\n(In that case, he could have easily manipulated the data.)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... What's wrong, Sir Lawyer?\nLeads back to cross-examinationAtmey:\nHowever... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... What does that mean? \"Discombobulated\"?\nJudge:\nHmm... Young people these days... They really irritate me. They allow perfectly good old words to die until everyone forgets what they mean.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but what exactly DOES it mean anyway?\nJudge:\n...Now I've forgotten. What was I saying?\nPhoenix:\n(Jeez. It's better than old people who forget what they were saying 5 seconds ago!)\nGodot:\n...Well, it looks like we've cleared that up. You can go on with your testimony.Atmey:\nUnfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by \"weapon from the side\"?\nAtmey:\nNaturally, that thief had no idea that I, Luke Atmey, was hiding in the area! He grabbed the sword from the statue that was standing by the door to the warehouse.\nPhoenix:\nSword...? You mean the sword that was all twisted like a tree branch?\nAtmey:\nCorrect. Fortunately for me, the blade was not sharp.\nPhoenix:\n(OK. so he IS talking about the Shichishito...)\nJudge:\nSo the thief armed himself with a sword. And what about yourself, witness?Atmey:\nA true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou had that much faith in your own fighting abilities?\nAtmey:\nBut of course. In college, I was the 2nd in-charge of the boxing club.\nJudge:\nI'm sorry if I fail to find that appropriately impressive.\nAtmey:\nHowever! My opponent in the ring this time was my arch-nemesis, Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\n(This guy is a real piece of work...)Atmey:\nHis first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell us a little more about what happened?\nAtmey:\nMy opponent was both powerful and vicious. You might say he was... \"powericious\".\nPhoenix:\n(\"P-Powericious\"?)\nAtmey:\nI assumed the \"Atmey Fighting Stance\", but a sudden flash of light blinded me! That of course was checkmate! My opponent had bested me.\nPhoenix:\n(What do I do now? Should I ask more about this...?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess it's true that Atmey was knocked senseless after all. I'd better ask him about something else instead...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\"You were blinded\"?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo what was this flash of light that blinded you?\nAtmey:\n...I was bathed in a golden light that seemed to come from the statue of the woman.\nPhoenix:\n(The statue of Ami Fey, I'm guessing...)\nMaya:\nWell that wasn't very much help at all...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\"Atmey Fighting Style\"?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat is this \"Atmey Fighting Style\"?\nAtmey:\nI'm sorry but that's a trade secret... I really can't say any more. But, I suppose I can tell you if I absolutely must. The main thing is to put your back to the wall. That way no one can get behind you.\nPhoenix:\n(That's it...? That's the \"Atmey Fighting Style\"?)\nJudge:\nHmmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What about that testimony...?\n\n\n\nIt was a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess it's true that Atmey was knocked senseless after all. I'd better ask him about something else instead...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt was very important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course it's important! We've learned a detective's SECRET technique, after all.\nJudge:\nYes, indeed... I'll remember to use it if I ever take a walk alone late at night.\nPhoenix:\n(Why the heck is he eye-balling me like that...? It's creeping me out...)\nJudge:\n...Now then, witness! We'll go ahead and add that secret information to your official testimony!\nChanges statement from \"His first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\" to \"I put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.\"Atmey:\nI put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Where is this \"third eye\" you're talking about?\nAtmey:\nOh... it's right between my right and left eye brows. ...It's quite invisible to the unenlightened. You may call it the forehead, if you like.\nPhoenix:\n(Why didn't you just say that in the first place!?)\nAtmey:\nSir Lawyer! It looks like the creases in your own forehead are getting deeper!\nMaya:\nSo Mr. Atmey got hit on the forehead then?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he says.\nMaya:\nHmm... I've got a funny feeling about that.\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, so do I.)Present Shichishito\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards.\"Maya:\nWell what do you think, Nick?Phoenix:\nWell, there's one thing that I'm absolutely sure of now.Maya:\nYeah? What is it!?Phoenix:\nThe Luke Atmey guy... He's definitely hiding something!Maya:\nB-But why?Phoenix:\nI think I'm starting to figure out what really happened that night. (...And about the true nature of this \"detective\".)Phoenix:\nDetective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards.Atmey:\nWhat fun this is, Sir Lawyer! It is truly a pleasure to cross swords with you! And now, once again, you have thrown down the gauntlet at my armored feet...Phoenix:\nI believe this is what you said yesterday.Atmey:\nNo, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head from behind with this gruesome item here!Judge:\nFrom behind, huh?Phoenix:\nBut just now you testified that he struck you on the forehead... I hardly think you could forget where you were hit on the head!Atmey:\n...Urk! It seems... I-I've made another mistake.Phoenix:\n...Detective Atmey. That's not the only strange part of your testimony.Judge:\nWh-What do you mean by that?Phoenix:\nFor example... The very fact that you hid the calling card from the police itself is strange! It's almost as if... You were afraid they were going to help with security!Atmey:\nU-Urk...! Geniuses such as myself have always been misunderstood! How sad...Phoenix:\nThat's wrong!Godot:Godot:\n...To err is human, to forgive divine. Humans aren't machines... They have souls, feelings. They live, they die, they love, they hate... And yes, they even make mistakes...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nHey, hold on! It-It's not as pretty as that!Godot:\nReally? What is it like then!?Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nAlways chase a riddle down to the end. That's one of my rules.Phoenix:\n(This is it... This might just be my chance to turn things around!)Judge:\n...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?Phoenix:\nVery well, Your Honor. The defense asserts that...Mr. Atmey is no Ace Detective!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe truth is... this witness is no Ace Detective at all!\nAtmey:\n...So then what exactly are you saying that I am?\nPhoenix:\nUh, umm... Well, an average detective...?\nJudge:\nI hardly see the relevance of that.\nMaya:\nWh-What are you doing, Nick!? Weren't you going to go on the attack?\nPhoenix:\nI was planning on it, but it looks I'm the one who got attacked instead.\nJudge:\nThink harder next time!\nLeads back to:\n\"...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?\"this Mr. Atmey is a fake!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis witness isn't Luke Atmey... He's a fake!\nAtmey:\n...So now it's not just Mask\u2606DeMasque. You're saying I'm a fake, too?\nPhoenix:\nAn Ace Detective could never be as forgetful as this guy!\nGodot:\nImposters like you are often suspicious of others as well.\nJudge:\nReally, this is too much. Next you'll be calling me a fake, too!\nLeads back to:\n\"...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?\"Mr. Atmey is Mask\u2606DeMasque!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The answer is simple! It's all clear to me now!\"Phoenix:\nThe answer is simple! It's all clear to me now! Detective Luke Atmey's true identity is actually... Mask\u2606DeMasque!Atmey:\nYeeeeaaargggh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?Phoenix:\nThere are too many unnatural parts to Mr. Atmey's story. He says he was \"hiding\" at the crime scenes, which is why no one ever saw him there. And then, in his last case, he manages to outperform Detective Gumshoe and... ...the entire police force to \"miraculously\" retrieve the stolen treasure.Atmey:\nTh-That's because... I analyzed the crime scene data and made an exquisitely elegant deduction. I picked up clues that the police overlooked in order to arrive at a...Phoenix:\nOh, please! The explanation is far simpler than that, \"Detective Atmey\"! The truth is that you are, in fact, Mask\u2606DeMasque.Atmey:\nGurk...!Judge:\nB-But Mr. Wright! Th-This photo! It clearly shows Mask\u2606DeMasque! This security camera belongs to Lordly Tailor Department Store! He shouldn't have been able to manipulate it...Phoenix:\nHe didn't need to manipulate it! He gained access to the warehouse under the pretense of providing \"security\"... Then he simply dressed as the \"thief\" and stole the urn.Judge:\nSo... the Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief! Is this true, witness!?Atmey:\n... Aha... Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee! DeMasque's M. O. is pure genius! And so am I, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective!! You're very clever to have come to such a conclusion! I am impressed, Sir Lawyer!Judge:\nWh-Whaaaaat!? Witness! You... You're admitting it!?Maya:\nN-Nick! Now's your chance!Phoenix:\nYes! Time to put the last nail in this guy's coffin! Detective Atmey! When you assumed the thief's identity--Godot:Godot:\nGodot Blend #102... ...My personal favorite.Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!Godot:\n\"The Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief!\" I smell a best-selling novel! There's only one problem... It simply isn't true.Judge:\nB-But Mr. Godot! Mr. Wright has made some very strong points and I...Godot:\nI will admit my opponent has woven a compelling narrative out of whole cloth. But it is, in fact, nothing more than a patchwork quilt. Mr. Trite... If this detective really is the thief, then show us the proof of your claim. But it had better be as hot... and as perfect as the coffee dripping down your face!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright!? Don't just stand there! This court would like to see this decisive proof you have! Quickly!Phoenix:\nHuh!? Oh! Y-Yes, of course! (Wh-What's the big rush...?)Maya:\nAre you alright, Nick?Phoenix:\n(Atmey looks pretty rattled right now... I'd like to finish this right now if I can. But can I really do it?) The decisive evidence that proves Mr. Luke Atmey is in fact Mask\u2606DeMasque...is right here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs usual, the defense comes prepared, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nVery well then... Let's see what you've got. Please present proof that Mask\u2606DeMasque is actually Mr. Luke Atmey!\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere's your proof!\nJudge:\nWhat do you think, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nIt looks to me like Mr. Trite is still a mite sleepy. Perhaps he'd like a big mug of my special Godot blend? Well?\nPhoenix:\nN-No thanks, I'm fine! Really! (What do I do now? Another mistake like that and I'm through! Without some decisive evidence, I could be risking everything...)\n\n\n\nI've got all I need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads back to:\n\"As usual, the defense comes prepared, Your Honor!\"\n\n\n\n\nI don't have a thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Proof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.\"has yet to be found!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Proof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.\"Phoenix:\nProof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.Godot:\nHa...! Just what I thought. A man has to told his head up high no matter how bad things get, after all.Phoenix:\nUuugh...Judge:\nI see... I thought perhaps you had some evidence to back up your assertion...Phoenix:\n(This is no good! I've got to stay on the attack! I'll never get another chance to prove that this guy is the thief!)Maya:\nDon't give up, Nick! Think harder and try again!Phoenix:\nIt's no good... I'm just not ready yet...Maya:\nB-But... Are you going to just give up and let us lose this?Atmey:\nSo, you've come to your senses, have you, Sir Lawyer?Phoenix:\nI... Unnngh... (Argh! I can't think of a counter-attack at all...)Judge:\nIt seems the cloud of suspicion surrounding this witness has lifted. Mr. Godot. If you have anything further to add, then--???:Judge:\nWh... Wh-Who... ...Who are you?Desir\u00e9e:\nThat doesn't really matter right now, does it?Phoenix:\nMs. DeLite! What are you doing here?Desir\u00e9e:\nNicky boy! The thing you've been looking for... I think I found it!Judge:\nYou mean... that bag!?Desir\u00e9e:\nNo, not the bag! What's in the bag! ...Well?Judge:\nTh-That's...Maya:\nThe Sacred Urn!! Nick! It's the urn!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! ...You! Madame...! That urn... Where did you find it!?Desir\u00e9e:\nYou'll never believe it... It was in the office of Mr. Fancy Pants Ace Detective! ...Luke Atmey!Ron:\nOh, Dessie! You're the best!Sacred Urn updated in the Court Record.Phoenix:\nWell? How do you explain that one, Mr. Atmey!?Atmey:\n...Phoenix:\nEven you are going to have a hard time weaseling out of this one!Godot:Godot:\nHa...! Pathetic...Judge:\nMr. Godot...? Do you have something you wish to say?Godot:\nYes, Your Honor... It simply amazes me how quickly times change... In the old days, a man was to be taken at his word. It's truly sad...Judge:\nYou're still denying that Mr. Atmey was involved!?Godot:\nBefore casting aspersions at Detective Atmey, consider the young lady here. Your name is Desir\u00e9e... Desir\u00e9e DeLite. Is that correct?Desir\u00e9e:\nY-Yes! What about it?Godot:\nHa...! How charming... The lengths that a woman is willing to go to save her husband is truly inspiring.Desir\u00e9e:\nWh-What are you insinuating!?Godot:\nAs the wife of the criminal, you could have \"discovered\" that stolen urn anywhere. Including the office of the good detective here. So you found the urn. What does that prove? It certainly doesn't prove where the urn was before you \"found\" it.Desir\u00e9e:\nWhat...? I just brought it here from the detective's office!Godot:\nPlease Madame... This town is already filled to the brim with lies. Any more could only compound the tragedy we have been witness to.Desir\u00e9e:\nYou're wrong! I would never...! I would never do such a thing!Phoenix:\nMs. DeLite...Desir\u00e9e:\nPlease, Nicky boy! You've got to help me talk some sense into these people!Phoenix:\n(There must be some way! I've got to prove that urn was actually in the Atmey Detective Agency...)Testify about what I saw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nWhat's wrong? Isn't it your job to come up with something to say...?\nMaya:\nNick! Come on! It should be easy to prove! After all, we checked out that bag, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. I remember doing that. Whatever was in there, it was hard and round... And smooth, too.\nMaya:\nYes! It must have been the urn! It must have!\nPhoenix:\nBut... I never actually saw it with my own eyes.\nMaya:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nAtmey walked in just when I was about to have a look at it... So even if it was the urn in there, I can't testify that it was.\nMaya:\nAck! You're right!!\nGodot:\nHa...! It looks like I was wrong about you, Mr. Trite. In this town overflowing with lies, there's still a single flickering candle of truth.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nNicky boy...!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it's true that I never actually saw the urn... But maybe I can still testify about it from another angle!)\nJudge:\nWhat about it, Mr. Wright? Have you given up yet...?\nLeads back to:\n\"There must be some way!\"Show fingerprints on the urn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI can prove where the urn was... ...by the fingerprints on it!\nJudge:\nFingerprints, eh...\nAtmey:\nOh come now! Now you're really making me laugh, Sir Lawyer! Fingerprints indeed!\nPhoenix:\n...\nAtmey:\nMay I go on? Good. Now it would be perfectly understandable if my fingerprints were on the urn. After all, it was I who was guarding the urn in the first place! In any case, I am always in the habit of wearing gloves as you can see. So unfortunately, my fingerprints wouldn't be evidence of anything.\nJudge:\nWhat about it, Mr. Wright? This witness's fingerprints would mean nothing anyway.\nMaya:\nN-Nick, what are you going to do now?\nPhoenix:\n(I've come too far to turn back now! Atmey must have brought the urn back to his office yesterday... And there, I'm sure someone must have left their fingerprints on it...!) The defense proposes that the fingerprints of this person should be on the urn!\n\n\n\nPresent Phoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"So what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nLet me give you an important piece of advice. The one who keeps a cool head all the way until the game's end is the winner.\nJudge:\nLet me give you an even more important piece of advice, Mr. Wright... You are not going to win this game with that answer.\nMaya:\nWow... Even the judge is making cool, snappy remarks now...\nPhoenix:\n(D-Does that mean I was wrong again? Hmm... The urn was put in that bag and carried to the detective's office yesterday. That means the person I should be fingering is... the person who left their prints on the urn yesterday at the Atmey Detective Agency!)\nMaya:\nDo you really think there's someone that could fit the bill?\n\n\n\nName another person\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? What have you decided?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Please give me just one more chance!\nLeads back to:\n\"The defense proposes that the fingerprints of this person should be on the urn!\"\n\n\n\n\nThink it over again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? What have you decided to do?\nPhoenix:\nForgive me, Your Honor. I've decided to think the whole thing over again.\nLeads back to:\n\"There must be some way!\"I can't prove anything yet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI can't prove anything yet.\nMaya:\nBut Nick!\nJudge:\nVery well... It looks like that's all then.\nGodot:\nExactly... And this urn is all the proof I need to make my case...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGodot:\nYou still don't get it, huh? Listen closely, Mr. Trite. This is the urn that Mask\u2606DeMasque stole, right? Now the wife of the accused comes strolling in here with the very same urn, correct? Now, who would you think is the thief?\nPhoenix:\nAh...!\nDesir\u00e9e:\nNo! That's wrong! That's not why I've got it...\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Y-You can't let him do this...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, this isn't good... There has to be another way around this...) Your Honor! Please let me think it over one more time!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. It's high time that you learn your lesson. The courtroom is no place for poorly thought-out or rash declarations!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to be careful... He won't be so nice next time...)\nLeads back to:\n\"There must be some way!\"Atmey:\nSo what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?Phoenix:\nMr. Atmey... Do you recall the events of yesterday?Maya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! Open it up!Phoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property!Maya:\nDon't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation! Well? What's in there?Phoenix:\nH-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...)Atmey:\n...Well, hello there!!Phoenix:\nIt's true that I didn't get a chance to look in the bag at that time. But! I did touch what was inside.Atmey:\nWh-What!? Y-You touched it...?Phoenix:\nAnd I remember it very well. It was \"smooth and hard\".Atmey:\nW-Well, err... Th-That was just...Phoenix:\nYour Honor! I'd like the court to examine the fingerprints on that urn. If my fingerprints are on there... Then it proves that the urn was in Detective Atmey's office!Godot:Godot:\nWell, even if your fingerprints are on the urn... ...it still doesn't prove when they were put there, does it?Phoenix:\nOf course it does.Godot:\nWh-What did you just say!?Phoenix:\nIt's not what I say, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said. (Changed from [Not what I said, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said.] in the original release)Andrews:\nI polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it looks more valuable!Phoenix:\nIf she polished it that much, she must have removed any and all fingerprints on it. And the only chance I had to get my fingerprints on it after that was... Yesterday! At the Atmey Detective Agency!Godot:\nHa...! This blend... Godot Blend #107... I've decided... It's a little too bitter after all!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I accept the defense's request! Bailiff! Take this urn and...Atmey:\nWait! Wait a moment, Your Honor! ...There's no need for that.Judge:\nN-No need you say...?Atmey:\nPrecisely... I already know Mr. Wright's fingerprints are on the urn...Judge:\nWh-What are you saying!Phoenix:\n(Yes! I've finally broken him down!)Atmey:\nHee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...Maya:\nThis guy is nuttier than a fruitcake...Atmey:\nYou see! It was me all along! I am the one and only Mask\u2606DeMasque! Ha ha! I hope you all enjoyed my little performance! Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Godot... What's Mr. Atmey's condition?Godot:\nHe's still in the lobby, laughing insanely, Your Honor. I wish I could enjoy the joke as much as he seems to be.Judge:\nWell, it looks like the matter has been settled. I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of \"thief\"!Maya:\nNick, you were right after all!Phoenix:\n(Yeah! I guess Mr. DeLite really wasn't the thief!)Judge:\nThe court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...???:Ron:\nYou're wrong! Wrong I tell you! Err, umm, I mean...

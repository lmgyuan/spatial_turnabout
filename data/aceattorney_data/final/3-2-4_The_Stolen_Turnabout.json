We made it!\nWhew... What a relief. Glad the jewel is still safe.\nHo ho! You said it, pal. It musta been our rock solid security that scared him off!\nWould you mind opening the safe just to double check?\nAaaaaaaaaah! We've been had!\nO-Out front! Guards! Turn on the searchlights!\nAha ha ha ha ha ha ha... Better luck next time, gentlemen! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha... Excuse me, but I'm afraid I must be leaving now! We shall meet again... When the next moon is full! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha... Ahaaaa ha ha ha ha ha ha...\nOctober 11, 3:24 PMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Get a load of this! Hey, are you listening to me!? You can clean the toilet later! This is important!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* What are you freaking out about now?\nMaya:\nHey hee. Today will be the last time you talk to me that way!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nWe're about to hit the big time!\nPhoenix:\n\"Big time\"? And what do you mean by \"we\"? You don't mean you and me are...?\nMaya:\nHa! Don't be silly. I'm talking about me and Pearly, of course!\nPearl:\nHello. It's a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nPearls! You haven't changed a bit! Wait... What are you doing here anyway?\nPearl:\nHee hee. Haven't you heard, Mr. Nick? Here! Take a look at this!\nPhoenix:\n(What's this...? Some kind of poster?) Kurain Village... Isn't that...?\nMaya:\nThat's right. It's our hometown... Pearly and mine, that is.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this about \"treasures\" from the boonies?\nMaya:\nHa ha ha. Very funny. You can laugh all you want... But you'll be singing another tune tonight!\nPhoenix:\nTonight? What about tonight?\nPearl:\nThe \"Treasures of Kurain\" exhibit doesn't actually start until next week, but... ...the promoter sent us some special VIP entry passes!\nMaya:\nThat's why I dressed up extra special today! What do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Heh. Same Maya. Different day.) This young lady here is Maya Fey... The younger sister of Mia Fey... ...My friend and mentor. I first met her two years ago... I was working on the case surrounding Mia's death, and ever since then...\nMaya:\nI've been the one who's been keeping this law office afloat from behind the scenes.\nPhoenix:\nActually that's just a cover for her true identity... In reality, she's a spirit medium, and a bit of a shady character.\nMaya:\nHey! Who are you calling \"shady\"!?\nPhoenix:\nAnd this little girl is Pearl Fey, but I usually call her \"Pearls\". She's Maya's cousin and a spirit medium in training herself.\nPearl:\nI know I'm a bit young, but I want to help in any way I can, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nKurain Village is the home of the mysterious Kurain Channelling Technique. And Maya here is the daughter of the Kurain School of Channeling's Master. ...I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's no joke. I've seen her power with my own eyes... It's the real thing alright.\nMaya:\nEarth to Nick! How long are you going to make two gorgeous women like us wait!?\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! I can't wait any longer! I want to see the exhibit!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* Looks like I don't get a choice here. Might as well head on out...)\nTreasure Exhibit Poster added to the Court Record.\nOctober 11, 7:18 PMLordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall\nPhoenix:\n(\"Lordly Tailor\"... The city's fanciest and most expensive department store. Treasure Exhibit, huh... I have to admit I'm pretty impressed.)\nMaya:\nWow... This is awesome!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... You can make even the cheapest junk look great... It all depends on how you display it.\nPearl:\nOh! They even have the dusty old hanging scroll that was in the Fey Manor storeroom!\nMaya:\nOh yeah, I remember scribbling on it when I was a little girl!\nPhoenix:\n(On a family heirloom...!?)\nMaya:\nSay, Nick... The person in charge of this exhibition is waiting for us in the basement warehouse.\nPhoenix:\nAlright... (I guess we should go and say hello...)\nExamine\nBlue board\nPhoenix:\nA piece of cloth with a ton of finely-written characters jammed onto it. Probably esoteric knowledge only mediums would know. ...Hmm, let's see... Here's the title in English... \"108 Ways to Save Money.\" ... I'm pretty sure the number has gone up since the last time I saw it.\nMaya:\nWell, we're always looking for new ways you know!\nPhoenix:\nBeing a medium sounds like a rough way of life...\nCushion\nPhoenix:\nWhat's with this big cushion? It's just lying around, with nothing on it.\nMaya:\nHmm... Well it must be for the greatest treasure of all!\nPhoenix:\n\"Greatest treasure\"...? Is there something like that?\nMaya:\nHuh? Why... Of course there is! Right, Pearly?\nPearl:\nOh! Um, yeah! Of course!\nMaya:\nYeah, I'll bet it would really take your breath away!\nFolding screen\nPhoenix:\nI think I remember this old folding screen here... I'm pretty sure it was an important piece of evidence... ...in that murder case that happened in Kurain Village.\nPearl:\nThis folding screen is the greatest of all the spirit channeling secrets... The Six Leaf Kurain Sacred Writings folding screen!\nPhoenix:\n(If it's so secret, why is it the most prominent thing in the exhibit?)\nUrns\nPhoenix:\nThey're just a bunch of old urns... Are these really \"treasures\", too?\nMaya:\nOf course they are! This is a \"Treasure Exhibit\", isn't it!?\nPhoenix:\nWell yeah, I guess so. ... (So all it takes to be a \"treasure\" is age? No wonder nobody like museums...)\nKurain Village diorama\nPearl:\nOh! Mystic Maya, look! I can't believe it!\nMaya:\nAh! It's so cute! It's a little diorama of Kurain Village!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, look at that. But somehow, it seems to reek of dreariness.\nPearl:\nOh! Mystic Maya, It's your house! It even says, \"Fey Manor\" on it!\nMaya:\nYikes! You're right! I kinda want to add \"The Famous\" in front of it!\nPhoenix:\nDon't do it, Maya. ...They might get mad.\nOctober 11Lordly TailorBasement Warehouse\nPhoenix:\n(Yup. This is a basement warehouse alright...)\nPearl:\nTh-This place is scary... I feel like a monster could jump out at any time...\nMaya:\nDon't be scared, Pearly! I'll protect you!\n???:\n...Oh... ...Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nEeeeeeeek!! A monster! You were right!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? A monster...?)\n???:\nGood evening. ...It's good to see you again.\nPhoenix:\nY-You... I know you...\n???:\nHa ha. Nice to see you again too, little miss.\nPearl:\nAh! H-Hello!\nMaya:\nIs she a friend of yours, Nick? ...And how do you know her, Pearly?\nAndrews:\nNice to meet you. I'm Adrian Andrews. I'm in charge of the promotion and planning for this Treasure Exhibit. I'm also responsible for the security arrangements.\nMaya:\nOh, um... N-Nice to meet you.\nPhoenix:\n(Adrian sure has changed since we last met...)\nAndrews:\nSo this is the warehouse. The really valuable exhibit items are still stored away in here.\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nIt's a security camera. It's trained on the warehouse door.\nAndrews:\nIt's set up to take a picture of anyone that enters or exits the door. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, they say.\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nThis computer... It looks like it's hooked up to the security camera above.\nMaya:\nAnd that means what?\nPhoenix:\nThe camera is set up to take a photo of anyone that goes in or out of the storeroom... Then the data from the camera gets uploaded to this computer here. That's what.\nMaya:\nI see... That's some pretty high-tech stuff.\nBig signboard\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like a part of a big signboard. All I can read on it is the \"bur\".\nMaya:\nAha! I've got it! Maybe it's supposed to say, \"Hamburger\"!\nPhoenix:\nWhy would anyone write \"Hamburger\" that big?\nMaya:\nLike, maybe for the \"World Hamburger Festival\" or something?\nPhoenix:\nI kinda doubt it.\nMaya:\nAha! I've got it! Maybe it said, \"Spaghetti\"!\nPhoenix:\n...Why are you talking about food? Oh, wait. That's normal for you. Anyway, it says, \"bur\". There's no way it could be \"Spaghetti\".\nMaya:\nWell, maybe it was a typo! It might have said, \"Spaghetti Festival\". What do you think?\nPhoenix:\nOK to me... Besides, Spaghetti is the only thing more tangled than your reasoning.\n(Step)ladder\nMaya:\nLook, a ladder!\nPhoenix:\nThat's a \"step\"-ladder.\nMaya:\nSo? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nR-Right... sorry. (Why do I feel like we've had this exact same conversation before somewhere...?)\nDoor to the storeroom\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's that big door over there?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's the door to the actual storeroom. I can see lots of big boxes and stuff back there.\nMaya:\nReally? Let's go in! I wanna take a look!\nAndrews:\nOh... I'm sorry! Unauthorized personnel aren't allowed in there.\nMaya:\n...Did you hear that, Nick? We're unauthorized personnel.\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you telling me that?\nAmi Fey statue\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! Take a look next to the door! That... That's Mystic Ami, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's a statue of the woman who invented the Kurain Channeling Technique, Ami Fey. This statue is on loan from one of the training halls of the Fey branch family. In fact, it just arrived this morning.\nAmi Fey's Golden Statue added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's that creepy-looking thing she's holding?\nMaya:\nDon't ask me! How should I know...?\nPhoenix:\n...Well, you ARE the future Master, right?\nMaya:\nMaybe so, but this is the first time I've ever seen this statue.\nAndrews:\nThat \"thing\" is the Kurain Shichishito. It's a ceremonial sword. It's not a real weapon, so the blade isn't sharp.\nMaya:\n...Aww, phooey. I wanted to cut something!\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you eyeing me for!?\nAmi Fey statue (subsequent times)\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! Take a look next to the door! That... That's Mystic Ami, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's a statue of the woman who invented the Kurain Channeling Technique, Ami Fey. This statue is on loan from one of the training halls of the Fey branch family. In fact, it just arrived this morning.\n\"ORGANI\" panels\nPhoenix:\nIt says \"ORGANI\".\nMaya:\nNo it doesn't, Nick! It says, \"ORGANIZE\"! You just can't see the last two letters.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well I guess no one else could read it either, because this place is a mess.\nMaya:\nYeah. You must feel right at home, huh?\nTalk\nAdrian Andrews\nAndrews:\nIt really has been a long time, hasn't it, Mr. Wright?\nMaya:\nNick! What's going on!? Who is this woman!?\nPhoenix:\nWh-Why are you freaking out on me!? (Changed from [Wh-Why are you spazzing out on me!?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat? I just thought it'd be more dramatic if I got all worked up. That's all.\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! You shouldn't let him of the hook so easily!\nPhoenix:\n(Please, Maya, don't say anything that'll needle Pearls further...)\nAndrews:\nMr. Wright was there for me when I really needed help. It... It was something that happened 7 months ago.\nPhoenix:\nYou remember, don't you? The \"Nickel Samurai\" case.\nMaya:\nNot really... I was stuck in a dark wine cellar... Did that escape your memory, Nick?\nAndrews:\nAfter that, I quit being a manager and started this job.\nPhoenix:\nWow, that's tough. I'm sorry, Ms. Andrews. If it wasn't for us...\nAndrews:\nNo! Don't say that! I'm glad the whole thing happened. Thanks to you and everyone else that was involved, I was able to change my whole life. ...I really am grateful.\nPhoenix:\n(Whew, that's a relief...)\nLordly Tailor\nPhoenix:\nI'm really impressed, Ms. Andrews. Handling a huge exhibition like this must be very tiring.\nAndrews:\nWell, Lordly Tailor is celebrating their 200th anniversary this year. The works on display in the main exhibition hall are worthy of the finest museums.\nMaya:\nWoohoo! Did you hear that, Pearly!? The finest museums!\nPearl:\nYes, I did! That's really wonderful.\nPhoenix:\nSo this basement warehouse is pretty well-protected, huh?\nAndrews:\n...Of course it is. After all, there are some priceless treasures here. The security guards are very highly trained as well...\nPhoenix:\n(That sounds good... So, what is with that face she's making...?)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nAndrews:\nI owe a great deal of thanks to that badge... ...It's the only reason that I'm still here today.\nPhoenix:\nOh, come on now. That's not true...\nMaya:\nI think what Nick means to say is, \"It wasn't thanks to the badge, it was thanks to ME!\" Tell the truth, Nick! I know that's what you were thinking!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way, Maya!\nTreasure Exhibit Poster\nAndrews:\nI wanted to do something nice for you and your friends, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nSo that's why you arranged this exhibit...?\nAndrews:\nI knew that Kurain Village was the hometown of your assistant, Maya. I thought it would be great to let the rest of the world know about it, too.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... But that's not exactly thanking me, per se, is it?\nMaya:\nMaybe, but who'd wanna see an exhibit on the \"Treasures of Phoenix Wright\"?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I can't argue with that one.\nPhoenix Wright profile\nAndrews:\nYou've certainly changed since I last saw you 7 months ago.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?\nAndrews:\nYes, you look like you're bulked up a little.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, now that she mentions it... I guess I have gotten a little stronger...)\nMaya:\nYou're such a dork, Nick.\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI've finally managed to put the events of 7 months ago behind me. I really love the work that I'm doing now... Honestly, I owe it all to you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nOh, it was nothing.\nAndrews:\nAnd to this little girl, too.\nPearl:\nTh-Thank you for saying so!\nMaya:\n... ...I guess I wasn't much of a help, huh?\nAndrews:\nN-No, that's not true! You were ALL a big help to me!\nPhoenix:\n(She shouldn't take it so personally. It's not like she was exactly \"free\" to help...)\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nUm... So what about this?\nAndrews:\nSorry I can't be of more help, but I really don't have anything to say about that.\nAny other profile\nAndrews:\nI'm sorry, I don't know as many people as I used to. So there really isn't anything I can tell you about that person.\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining Ami Fey statue:\nAndrews:\nOh, look! It's already 8:00! Have you all eaten yet?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well actually...\nAndrews:\nI've already made a reservation at the restaurant on the 12th floor. Why don't we all dine together?\nMaya:\nOoh! I like the sound of that! \"Dine\"... It sounds so fancy!\nPearl:\nI'll have the \"Kid's Lunch\"!\nMaya:\nHa ha ha. Pearly, it's dinner, not lunch. Why don't you go for it and really eat your fill with a \"Kid's Dinner\"?\nPearl:\nOK! In that case, one \"Kid's Dinner\" for me!\nAndrews:\nHa ha. Shall we head upstairs, then?\nPhoenix:\nAfter that pleasant evening, all that remained was to wait for the exhibition's opening. It was wonderful seeing Ms. Andrews looking so happy. None of us could have imagined... ...that the very next day, something terrible would happen...\nOctober 12, 10:09 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nN-Nick! This is terrible! ...What the--!? You're cleaning the toilet again!? I never knew you were such a toilet freak!\nPhoenix:\nGimme a break, would you? My brain just hit the snooze button for the fifth time...\nPearl:\nUm... I'm going to turn on the TV!\nAnnouncer:\n...We've got an update on the recent treasure heist! Based on clues found at the scene of the crime, authorities have announced... that they believe it was the work of the renowned phantom thief, Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\n...M-Masque the Mask...?\nAnnouncer:\nAccording to a spokesperson, Lordly Tailor received a threat letter some days ago. This is the fifth heist by the phantom thief, who only targets rare treasures.\nPhoenix:\nL-Lordly Tailor...!?\nMaya:\nWell, Nick!? What are you going to do!? Don't you dare go back to scrubbing the toilet!\nPhoenix:\nTreasure...? Lordly Tailor...? You don't think...!?\nMaya:\nYes! Now, get up, Nick! It was stolen! By Mask\u2606DeMasque! Our most valuable treasure... The Kurain Sacred Urn was STOLEN!!\nPhoenix:\nWhaaat!?\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they brought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...And to think that two years ago, it was just a little hotel for businessmen.\nMovie poster\nPhoenix:\nAn old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I'll have to check it out one of these days.\nCharley the plant\nPhoenix:\nCharley. A quite decorative plant. When she was alive, Mia really loved it. She even went so far as to make it our mascot. It must be nice to be a plant, being able to just sit in the sun and photosynthesize...\nMaya:\nHey! Nick! No time for daydreaming!\nPearl:\nThat's right, Mr. Nick! No time for daydreaming!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh man. Until I find that urn, they're not gonna give me a second of peace...)\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nIt's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so the dust bunnies are starting to mount their assault. Maybe I should wipe them out with a few well-placed swipes of my cleaning rag...\nMaya:\nHey! Nick! Are you trying to make me upset!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! If you're worried about the cleaning, please leave it up to me!\nPhoenix:\n(At least Pearls is good at cleaning. *sigh* Guess I'd better go find that urn...)\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least read them once in a while.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! This is no time for reading!\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! You can always read later!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I won't be getting any peace and quiet to even read until I find that urn...)\nTalk\nSacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nRefresh my memory a little... What's this \"Sacred Urn\"...?\nMaya:\nIt's only the most important treasure in Kurain Village! That's all! Look! It's right here on the poster! Don't you remember what's inside? The urn contains a very important soul! Namely, the soul of Mystic Ami Fey, the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Right, Pearly?\nPearl:\nAh, yes! Th-That's right!\nMaya:\n... Hold up... I thought that urn had the name \"AMI\", written on it... Now it says \"I AM\"... Hm... Any idea how that happened, Pearly?\nPearl:\nHuh!? Um, I... W-Well... Tee hee... There are some things left unsolved, wouldn't you say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That's right! One year ago, there was a murder in Kurain Village, Maya's hometown. The Sacred Urn... It turned out to be an important clue in that case.)\nSacred Urn added to the Court Record.\nSacred Urn (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nRefresh my memory a little... What's this \"Sacred Urn\"...?\nMaya:\nIt's only the most important treasure in Kurain Village! That's all! Look! It's right here on the poster! Don't you remember what's inside? The urn contains a very important soul! Namely, the soul of Mystic Ami Fey, the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Right, Pearly?\nPearl:\nAh, yes! Th-That's right!\nMaya:\n... Hold up... I thought that urn had the name \"AMI\", written on it... Now it says \"I AM\"... Hm... Any idea how that happened, Pearly?\nPearl:\nHuh!? Um, I... W-Well... Tee hee... There are some things left unsolved, wouldn't you say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That's right! One year ago, there was a murder in Kurain Village, Maya's hometown. The Sacred Urn... It turned out to be an important clue in that case.)\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nOK, the toilet is shinier than the judge's head, so let's see what's next...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong with you, Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean what do I--\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Your beloved Mystic Maya's treasure has been stolen! Doesn't that ever bother you!?\nPhoenix:\nBut I thought the urn was the village's treasure, so I don't see how...\nPearl:\nThe village IS Mystic Maya! She's the future master of the Kurain School of Channeling! You know what I'm talking about, Mr. Nick! I won't let you say you don't!\nPhoenix:\nO-OK OK! I do! ...So what am I supposed to do about it?\nPearl:\nIsn't it obvious? Go and find the bad guy who did this!\nMaya:\nYeah! And get the Sacred Urn back!\nPhoenix:\nB-But... I'm not a detective... I'm a lawyer--\nPearl:\nThat has nothing to do with this! If you're a real gentlemen, you would find it for your beloved Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\n(Man, oh man... There's no winning against Pearls's fairy-tale image if love...) ...So what's the name of this bad guy again?\nMaya:\nMask\u2606DeMasque, Nick! Make a note of it! Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nLast year's incident (appears after \"Sacred Urn\")\nMaya:\nAh, it was terrible! I was arrested and everything!\nPhoenix:\nOne year ago... The murder in Kurain Village. A man was killed during one of Maya's spirit channelings. And this urn wound up being the key piece of evidence that proved her innocence.\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? Would you mind not telling Maya about that? You promised, remember? You said you wouldn't tell anyone I broke the urn...\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah, that's right. (Now I remember. This urn used to say \"AMI\" on it... Until Pearls accidentally broke it into a million pieces. She tried to secretly fix it... Let's just say it didn't work out so well.)\nPearl:\nSorry... I'm not so good at arts and crafts... Spelling either...\nPhoenix:\n...Anyway, this is how her gluing project turned out. She put the pieces together wrong and now, instead of \"AMI\", it says, \"I AM\". ...I can't believe no one's noticed this until now, a whole year later.\nPearl:\nI can't believe it myself...\nPresent\nMagatama\nMaya:\nOh, hey! It's my Magatama! So what do you think, Nick? Isn't it neat?\nPhoenix:\nIt sure is. Being able to peek into people's minds is definitely a nice advantage.\nMaya:\nWhat? How do you do that!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean? You gave me this thing...\nMaya:\nWell, I knew Pearly put some sort of spiritual power into it... But I had no idea that it let you do something as cool as that!\nPhoenix:\n...Some future leader you are.\nMaya:\nNext time you use it, let me know, OK!? I want to see into people's minds, too!\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nIs this thing really all that valuable? It looks kinda... well... junky, if you ask me.\nMaya:\nBut it's got the soul of Mystic Ami, the founder of our channeling technique!\nPhoenix:\nSo how much do you think you could get for it?\nMaya:\nWhat!? Sell the Sacred Urn!? You know, I never thought about that... Hey Pearly... Make a note of that. \"Ways to Save Money, Tip 109: Sell treasures whenever possible.\"\nPearl:\n...Whenever possible, check!\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I think Maya's going to be searching for a buyer for a long time...)\nAmi Fey's Golden Statue\nMaya:\nYou know, even I didn't know this statue existed until a little while ago.\nPhoenix:\nDidn't Adrian say it's from a Fey branch family's training hall or something?\nMaya:\nYes, there are actually a lot of training halls scattered all over the country. Hidden away deep in desolate mountains...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does it always have to be \"desolate\" mountains...?)\nPhoenix Wright profile\nMaya:\nYou're not very photogenic, are you?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nPearl:\nI guess that's the end of that conversation!\nMia Fey profile\nMaya:\nS-Sis... *sniffle* I really miss her...\nPearl:\nWas Mystic Mia... Was she a really good lawyer?\nMaya:\nYeah, she was awesome! She taught Nick everything he knows.\nPearl:\nYou should train hard and try to make her proud, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I'll do my best.\nPearl:\nYou can join me on my next trip to a freezing waterfall!\nPhoenix:\n(I hate to break it to her, but I don't think being frozen to the bone helps in court...)\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nI'm going to have to really buckle down and get serious.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're the future Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, after all.\nMaya:\nYeah... That, and I have to play the part of big sister, too. For Pearly... and you, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWha-?? Do I look like I was born yesterday!?\nPearl Fey profile\nMaya:\nPearly is such a cutie, isn't she Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nMaya:\nAnd she's smart too, just like yours truly! She's got quite a future ahead of her! I bet she could be President some day!\nPhoenix:\n(A President that can channel past Presidents... Hmm... That just might come in handy...)\nAdrian Andrews profile\nMaya:\nShe certainly seems grateful to you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWell, she was in a pretty tight spot during that terrible ordeal. Actually, I'm grateful to her, too.\nMaya:\nHmm... It sounds like you're not telling me something. I'm going to take a good look at the case file next chance I get...\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you think about this?\nMaya:\nHmm... What about it, Pearly?\nPearl:\nI'm not certain. What do you think, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe three heads aren't better than one...)\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you think about this person?\nMaya:\nHmm... What do you think, Pearly?\nPearl:\nI'm not certain. What do you think, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(I think the saying I'm looking for is, \"never seen them before in my life\"...)\nOctober 12Lordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall\nPearl:\nRight! Let's see if we can find some clues that might lead us to the bad guy!\nPhoenix:\n...But it doesn't look like anything has been disturbed.\nMaya:\nYeah, it looks pretty much the same as it did last night.\nPearl:\nHmmm... Bad guy, huh.\n???:\nHey! You can't poke around here, pal!\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute... that voice. Oh no! Not him again!\n???:\nIt's YOU!! And I'm the one who should be saying \"not again\"! Why is it that every time something bad happens, you always show up, pal?\nPhoenix:\nI should be asking you that. Aren't there any other detectives?\n???:\nNo, I should be asking YOU that. What are you doing hanging around here?\nPhoenix:\nHey, I asked you first. Why are you here any--\nMaya:\nAlright, alright, we got it! Why don't you two kiss and make up already?\nPearl:\n...Um, hello. It's been a long time, Mr. Scruffy Detective!\n???:\nOh! It's you, little missy! ...Um, ahh...\nGumshoe:\nActually, my name is Gumshoe. \"Detective Dick Gumshoe\"! Now is a good chance for you to try to remember it right!\nMaya:\nAnd if it's too long for you, you can just call him \"Dick\".\nPearl:\nOkay! It's good to see you again, Mr. Detective Dick!\nGumshoe:\nUm... Yeah... Good to see you again, too, I guess.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPearl:\nUmm, Mr. Detective Dick! Can you tell us about what happened?\nGumshoe:\nOh, you're trying to remember my name! Atta girl! ...Um, just... It's \"Gumshoe\", OK? Anyway, the thief stole something called the \"Sacred Urn\"...\nPearl:\nI know about that.\nGumshoe:\nOh. W-Well, the criminal's name is Mask\u2606DeMasque...\nPearl:\nI know about that, too.\nMaya:\nDetective, can't you tell us something other than that?\nGumshoe:\nW-Well... I guess I sorta kinda owe you guys... in a way... The crime occurred last night at around 1:30 in the morning.\nPhoenix:\nHow exactly do you know that?\nGumshoe:\nWe got an emergency phone call from a guard at the scene of crime, pal. He said, \"The urn was just stolen!\"\nMaya:\nThe scene of the crime... You mean here, right?\nGumshoe:\nWrong. That urn was being kept under careful guard in the basement warehouse.\nPhoenix:\n(Basement warehouse, huh...)\nPearl:\nUmm, so who was guarding the basement warehouse...?\nGumshoe:\nThat guy! It's all his fault that the thief got away, pal! He solves one case and gets a swelled head, thinking that he's an Ace Detective!\nMaya:\nA-Ace Detective...?\nMask\u2606DeMasque\nPhoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe, about this Mask\u2606DeMasque... Is he famous?\nMaya:\nWhaaaat!? You're joking, right Nick? Mask\u2606DeMasque is the hottest thing since sliced bread!\nGumshoe:\nSometimes he appears as a museum guard! Sometimes he appears as a big brown bear known to surprise unsuspecting victims. But underneath those disguises is... the true Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\n...So he's some kind of master of disguise, huh.\nGumshoe:\nAnd he only goes after the finest work of art, pal. Last night was his 5th heist! If Lordly Tailor had only cooperated, I could have caught him this time...\nMaya:\nWhat!? Then you knew he was planning on stealing the Sacred Urn!?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I did! The guy always sends his calling card before he steals something.\nPhoenix:\n(Calling card, huh... They mentioned that on TV...)\nAce Detective (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nSo why do you call him an \"Ace Detective\" anyway?\nGumshoe:\nThat's what he calls himself, pal... I didn't make it up.\nMaya:\nSo? What's he like?\nGumshoe:\nWell, like I told you, Mask\u2606DeMasque has made five heists so far. On the 4th heist, Mr. Ace Detective managed to get the stolen treasure back.\nPearl:\nWow, that is impressive! All by himself!?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I gotta admit it, pal. Maybe he really is as good as he says. Every time the thief sends one of his calling cards, we send our men on a stakeout... But none of us has ever gotten so much as a glimpse of the guy...\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Ace Detective was able to retrieve the stolen treasure from the thief...\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, he's at the scene of crime right now, looking for clues.\nPhoenix:\n(So he's down in the basement warehouse, huh...?)\nCalling card (appears after \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\")\nPhoenix:\nSo what's this \"calling card\"?\nGumshoe:\nHere it is. But don't show it to anyone! It's top-secret, OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this mark on the front?\nGumshoe:\nThat's Mask\u2606DeMasque's signature emblem, pal. You could say it's his \"mark\". All of his calling cards have got it on them.\nMaya:\nThey didn't mention THAT on the news flash.\nGumshoe:\nWe're withholding that detail from the public for \"operational reasons\"... The only way we can tell if a calling card is real or not is by this emblem.\nCalling Card added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\n...That makes sense. When you get famous, there are always imitators.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, if you work a little harder, maybe you can have your own copycats someday!\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh, thanks... I guess.\nCalling card (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo what's this \"calling card\"?\nGumshoe:\nHere it is. But don't show it to anyone! It's top-secret, OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this mark on the front?\nGumshoe:\nThat's Mask\u2606DeMasque's signature emblem, pal. You could say it's his \"mark\". All of his calling cards have got it on them.\nMaya:\nThey didn't mention THAT on the news flash.\nGumshoe:\nWe're withholding that detail from the public for \"operational reasons\"... The only way we can tell if a calling card is real or not is by this emblem.\nMaya:\n...That makes sense. When you get famous, there are always imitators.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, if you work a little harder, maybe you can have your own copycats someday!\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh, thanks... I guess.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nHere, take a look at my attorney's badge.\nGumshoe:\nAre you still showing that cheap little thing off? A real man keeps his mouth shut... and carries a suave police badge, pal.\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nGumshoe:\n...To be honest, pal, there's something that bugs me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's that?\nGumshoe:\nAll the other items that were stolen by Mask\u2606DeMasque were ones even I had heard of. They were all world-famous treasures. The \"Tear of Emanon\" or the \"Crown of Bongora\"...\nMaya:\nThe \"Sacred Urn of Kurain\" is famous, too! ...Right, Pearly!?\nPearl:\nOf course! Everyone in Kurain Village knows about it!\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like we've got an unpredictable thief on our hands...)\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nGumshoe:\nRemember! Don't tell anyone about that emblem. OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\nDoes the thief ever send these to the police?\nGumshoe:\nNo, always to the victims. Up until now, the victims have always come to us looking for help though.\nMaya:\n...That's not what happened this time, you mean?\nGumshoe:\nYou got that right, pal. Listen up! If you guys ever get one of these calling cards... ...I want you to come to us right away! Got me?\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, sure.\nPhoenix Wright profile\nGumshoe:\nPretty goofy-looking face, if you ask me.\nPhoenix:\nHey...!\nMaya:\nWhat are you doing carrying that around with you anyway? It's not like we ever need it.\nPhoenix:\n(She has got a point...)\nMia Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nOh! That's Ms. Mia Fey! She was a truly beautiful person, pal.\nMaya:\nHuh? You knew her? You knew my sis?\nGumshoe:\nSure. Everybody in the police force knew her. ...We all lost a great friend that day...\nPearl:\nMr. Scruffy Detective...\nGumshoe:\nI-I just got something in my eye...! ...I'm not crying!\nMask\u2606DeMasque profile\nGumshoe:\nI've been on this guy's tail ever since his first heist, pal!\nMaya:\nYeah, you're doing a really great job. I can see.\nGumshoe:\n...Oof! Listen pal, if you wanna jump high, first you gotta crouch down, right? I'm a little frustrated now, but it'll make it that much sweeter when I catch him! ...Anyway, that's what I keep telling myself every day.\nPearl:\nWell good luck, Mr. Detective Dick! I believe in you!\nGumshoe:\nAww, ain't you sweet. You're the only one that's ever said that!\nPhoenix:\n(...The only one? That's kinda sad if you think about it.)\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nUmm, what about this...?\nGumshoe:\n...Sorry, pal. I didn't get much sleep last night and my brain's not really working right.\nMaya:\nSomehow I don't think sleep would really fix the problem.\nPhoenix:\nHey, keep it down. He might have really good hearing for all you know, and might get mad if he heard.\nGumshoe:\nUmmm... I can hear everything you are saying, pal.\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nUmm, what about this person...?\nGumshoe:\n...Sorry, pal. I didn't get much sleep last night and my brain's not really working right.\nMaya:\nSomehow I don't think sleep would really fix the problem.\nPhoenix:\nHey, keep it down. He might have really good hearing for all you know, and might get mad if he heard.\nGumshoe:\nUmmm... I can hear everything you are saying, pal.\nAfter clearing \"What happened\" Talk option in Lordly Tailor - Main Exhibition Hall:\nOctober 12Lordly TailorBasement Warehouse\nMaya:\nNo matter how many times we come here, this place always give me the chills.\nPhoenix:\nThat's probably because it's air-conditioned... To protect the art pieces, you know.\n???:\n...Welcome! To my private little \"Banquet of Chaos\".\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What the heck does THAT mean...?)\n???:\nI'm afraid I have very little to offer, but please... make yourself at home.\nMaya:\nErr, umm... Who are you anyway...?\n???:\nSHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see! It's all becoming clear!\nMaya:\nWh-What do you see?\n???:\n...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. Neither very advanced at their trade! ...Am I wrong?\nMaya:\nYikes! Th-That's scary! H-How did you know that!?\n???:\n\"How\" you say? The universal skeptic would say that how is nothing but a question of why. I am traveler of both time and space, and a swimmer of dreams.\nMaya:\nWhat is he talking about? I can't make heads or tails of it...\n???:\nWithout further ado, let me fulfill what should be the first duty of any gentleman...\nAtmey:\n...and introduce myself. The name is Atmey... Luke Atmey! ...Ace Detective.\nPhoenix:\nOh... Umm... Hi.\nMaya:\nDon't let him intimidate you, Nick! Stand up and show him what you're made of!\nPhoenix:\nErr, umm... The name's Wright. Phoenix Wright... ...Ace Attorney.\nMaya:\nI'm Maya Fey! Ace Spirit Medium!\nPearl:\nAnd I'm, ummm... Pearl Fey. I'm Mystic Maya's cousin and umm... spirit medium Ace Apprentice.\nAtmey:\nExcellent! Well then, shall we begin our little game?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Game\"? Why does the phrase \"one short of a baker's dozen\" come to mind with this guy?)\nExamine\nAnywhere\nAtmey:\nTsk! Sir Lawyer! Please refrain from such crude behavior.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Wh-What do you mean?\nAtmey:\nThis criminal is an artist! The crime scene is the canvas upon which he paints! Only I, Ace Detective Atmey, have an eye which is educated enough to read the signs!\nMaya:\n...Could you translate that for me, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think he pretty much said, \"Don't touch anything amateurs!\"\nAtmey:\nIf there's something you wish to know about, you have but to ask Atmey! ...I know everything there is to know about my rival, Mask\u2606DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\n(What do I do now...?)\nMaya:\nDoes he have any top-secret information? Stuff that only a real crime buff would know?\nPhoenix:\n(I'll think about what to ask while I listen to what Mr. Ace Detective has to say...)\nTalk\nAce Detective\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So are you really as famous as you say?\nAtmey:\nOf course! For a lawyer, you have a rather shocking lack of knowledge about the world. I had no idea anyone was left in this city that had not heard of me! Look at me! I am Mask\u2606DeMasque's arch-enemy, the Ace Detective Luke Atmey! At this moment, there are two mighty figures which loom large over this grand city! One embodies the nefarious forces of darkness. The other the angelic cherubs of light!\nMaya:\n...Boy, now I'm really lost. What is he saying, Nick?\nAtmey:\nI have been personally on the heels of this villain since his first crime. After learning this criminal's patterns, I thwarted his very latest loathsome larceny! I even returned the target of his tyranny, the \"Portrait of Mejeena\" to the crime scene! And I did it all by myself! I took it back from Mask\u2606DeMasque... With my brawny mind and my brilliant muscles!\nMaya:\nYeah! They mentioned it on the news, in the \"Great People Around Town\" segment. (Changed from [Yeah! They mentioned it on the news, in the 'Great People of the Town' segment.] in the original release) They said that the museum gave you an incredible jewel as a reward!\nAtmey:\n...Well, compared to the treasure that I retrieved for them, it's not much.\nPhoenix:\n(So... in the end, the only thing that makes you great is your own self-praise...)\nMask\u2606DeMasque\nMaya:\nOh! Tell us what you know about Mask\u2606DeMasque! ...And keep it simple, please!\nAtmey:\nLike about how I have devoted my life to thwarting his dastardly deeds? Last night, here in the bowels of this store, we were locked in a most glorious battle.\nPhoenix:\nI see... ...Huh!? Hang on a second! You were here last night? Here? In Lordly Tailor!?\nAtmey:\nNaturally! Wherever DeMasque goes, you will find Atmey laying his elegant traps.\nPhoenix:\n(Elegant traps? More like DeMasque out-eleganced you and made a beautiful getaway.)\nAtmey:\nBut this time, I allowed him to escape with the illusion of victory.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if I should ask him about what happened last night in more detail...)\nThe night of the crime (appears after \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\")\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Can you tell us exactly what happened here last night?\nAtmey:\nBut of course. After all, I always say there should be no secrets between \"aces\".\nPhoenix:\n(Flattery will get you nowhere, Pinocchio...)\nAtmey:\nI first received the request for my services 20 days ago. And it was 10 days ago that we received Mask\u2606DeMasque's calling card...\nMaya:\nHuh? You were hired BEFORE the calling card even arrived?\nAtmey:\nYes. You see, the person who hired me is quite rigorous and thorough.\nPhoenix:\n(That's Adrian for you...)\nAtmey:\nA mere 10 days after hiring me, her worst premonitions were realized!\nMaya:\nA calling card arrived, right?\nAtmey:\nYes! So, Ace Detective that I am, I set a trap for the thief right in the warehouse. And waited for him... alone.\nMaya:\nAlone? ...But why? Why didn't you go to the police for help?\nAtmey:\nRidiculous! Why would I seek help from such a singularly useless group of nincompoops?\nPhoenix:\n(You've got a lot of nerve. After all, it was you that let DeMasque get away.)\nAtmey:\nI always operate alone and concealed. Out of the sight of others.\nPearl:\n...? \"Corn Sealed\"...?\nAtmey:\nPrecisely! Even the guards on duty here were unaware of my presence. \"To fool your enemies, first you must fool your friends.\" It's my own original proverb!\nMaya:\nAnyway, back to what happened last night...\nAtmey:\nAs I was saying, I hid here in the warehouse and waited for the thief to arrive. But I swear to you... Not a solitary soul came through that entrance! Nevertheless... The Sacred Urn disappeared!\nPhoenix:\nB-But that's impossible! How could it just disappear!?\nAtmey:\n\"How?\" you ask? Don't be ridiculous, Sir Lawyer. If I knew the answer to that question, I wouldn't be here!\nPhoenix:\n(For someone who seriously messed up his own stakeout, he's rather full of himself.)\nPearl:\nSo you're saying that even though on [sic] one came through those doors last night... ...our precious urn still somehow vanished from under your nose?\nPhoenix:\n(Th-That's just not possible!)\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nAtmey:\nDo not fear, young lady. I promise I shall retrieve your urn!\nMaya:\nThank you, Detective Atmey! I'm counting on you!\nAtmey:\nThe final round between Detective Luke Atmey and Mask\u2606DeMasque is set to begin.\nPhoenix:\nStill, there's something funny about this guy...\nMaya:\nYeah, but don't forget he managed to retrieve the treasure from the last heist.\nAtmey:\nYes, I even have a video that details my role in the whole affair. I recorded it directly from the news on TV. Can I interest you in a copy?\nPhoenix:\n...No thanks.\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nPhoenix:\nMask\u2606DeMasque's calling card... It's got his emblem printed on it, right?\nAtmey:\n...Quite impressive! But I would expect nothing less from my arch-rival! I'm surprised to see you in possession of such a top-secret piece of information.\nMaya:\nWell, we've got an Ace Lawyer, an Ace Spirit Medium and an Ace Cousin-Apprentice here.\nAtmey:\nYes, indeed... I think I could learn to like you, my fellow ace professionals!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know if I really want this guy to like us... ever.)\nPhoenix Wright profile\nPhoenix:\nThat's pretty amazing the way you were able to tell what I do for a living.\nAtmey:\nOh, it's elementary, my dear Wright, elementary. If you're really interested, the first clue was the hair. ...It points backward. It shows you're prepared to take on an attack. Such as from a criminal, for example. From your clothes, I knew you weren't a policeman, so I deduced you were a lawyer. After a combination of cold logic and intuition... Zvarri! Only the truth remains.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, impressive...)\nMaya:\nOr maybe he just took a look at the attorney's badge on your lapel, genius.\nMia Fey profile\nAtmey:\nThis woman... She is a true beauty.\nPhoenix:\n...You don't say.\nAtmey:\nI would be honored if you would introduce her to me.\nPhoenix:\n...\nAtmey:\nI assure you, Sir Lawyer, that my interest is strictly professional!\nMaya:\nEww, this guy's even creepier than I thought.\nAtmey:\nI assure you, my dear, all Ace Detectives are perfect gentlemen!\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nUmm... So how did you know I was a spirit medium?\nAtmey:\nOh, that was child's play. First, your hair. It's not of the type one sees every day. Both rare and enchanting... Almost... otherworldly. I thought it likely that you were either a fortune teller or a spirit medium. But I didn't quite detect the wisdom one usually sees in a fortune teller... And so... Zvarri! That left only one possibility.\nMaya:\nWell, they also have a bio about me on the Treasure Exhibit Poster...\nPearl Fey profile\nAtmey:\nAs for this child... Zvarri! Elementary school student.\nPearl:\nWow! That's right!\nAtmey:\nI can also see that you will be a middle-school student within the next few years!\nPearl:\nTh-That's incredible!\nPhoenix:\n(No doubt about it. This guy is good!)\nAtmey:\nNow you can see how I have earned my reputation as an Ace Detective.\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAtmey:\nAh, the charming young lady responsible for security, Ms. Adrian Andrews.\nMaya:\nHuh? You know her?\nAtmey:\nYes, well I should... She was the person who hired me for this job. A very intelligent woman. After all, she hired Detective Luke Atmey, did she not?\nPhoenix:\n(...I'm not entirely convinced that was an intelligent move on her part.)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nAtmey:\n...Oh, him. Yes, well I saw him earlier. That wretched detective has let the thief slip through his fingers every single time.\nMaya:\nWretched, huh...\nAtmey:\n...Now that I think about it, I wonder if they aren't working together.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nAtmey:\nIf you ask me, Luke Atmey, I believe the two of them are \"co-conspirators\".\nMaya:\nIf Detective Gumshoe heard that, he'd probably cry.\nPhoenix:\nHe is a surprisingly sensitive guy...\nMask\u2606DeMasque profile\nAtmey:\nThis will surely be Mask\u2606DeMasque's final heist! Last time I came close and managed to retrieve the stolen treasure! Mark my words, this criminal of humanity will be found guilty in due time! And then I, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective, will dance with joy!\nPhoenix:\nI have no clue what you're blabbering about... But I guess I'll find out soon.\nLuke Atmey profile\nAtmey:\nThis person is... Zvarri! A great Ace Detective! Am I correct?\nPhoenix:\nUm, but I was the one asking you...\nAtmey:\nThis photo simply isn't enough information. I'm afraid I can't be absolutely certain... But the intelligence in those eyes indicates a man of deep wisdom and insight.\nMaya:\nStop messing around, Nick, and just ask him already!\nPhoenix:\nB-But this guy is scary.\nAnything else\nAtmey:\n...I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. But I have no interest save that of finding evidence against my arch-rival!\nMaya:\nNah, it's OK. Nick is just a bit of a piddling evidence hog. That's his defense style.\nAtmey:\nA \"piddling evidence hog\", you say? In that case, I'd simply be wasting my breath!\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Maya. Why couldn't you have said I was a \"rival\", and not a \"piddling evidence hog\"?\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting DeMasque's Calling Card:\nAtmey:\n... ...Well, Sir Lawyer. I've been told that you too are pursuing the mysterious thief.\nPhoenix:\n...Well, I'm not sure would say that exact--\nMaya:\nThat's right! We're going to find the Sacred Urn no matter what we have to do!\nAtmey:\n...Excellent. I will trust you. I permit you to take a look around while I investigate elsewhere. If, perchance, you should discover something of value, return then to my office... My office of Earthly Delights, the \"Atmey Detective Agency\"! (Changed from [To my office of Earthly Delights, the 'Atmey Detective Agency'!] in the original release)\nMaya:\nOf-Office of Earthly D-Delights...?\nAtmey:\nWell then Sir Lawyer, if you'll excuse me, I have much to do!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a minute...!\nPearl:\nHe's gone.\nPhoenix:\nI don't like the idea of doing this guy's work for him.\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick. Don't worry about it. It's no big deal. Let's hurry up and investigate before he changes his mind!\nPearl:\nI wanna go to his office, too! Take me with you, OK?\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nIt's a security camera. It's trained on the big door to the storeroom. It's set up to take a photo of anyone that goes in or out.\nPearl:\nA \"se-kure-ity\" camera...?\nMaya:\nYeah, go stand in front of that door and it'll snap your photo too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nUmm... Mystic Maya... Do you think I should smile?\nMaya:\nNah. It's for criminals, so I think you should make a really scary face!\nPearl:\nL-Like this...?\nComputer\nMaya:\nHey, Pearly, do you know what this is? It's a computer!\nPearl:\nA \"kom-pu-ter\"...? Oh! I've heard of those! It has such a cute name!\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like this computer is for storing the data from the security camera. When someone comes in or out of the warehouse, the camera takes a photo of them.\nPearl:\nIt's probably the \"trap\" that the detective set up.\nMaya:\nLet's see if we can find last night's data on this thing. We might even find a photo of Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, let see here... (Man, I really stink at working these things...) ...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick? You're sweating an awful lot.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know how to pull up the photos...\nMaya:\nI had no idea you were so pathetic with high-tech stuff, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, well I managed to print out the camera data anyway.\nMaya:\nI guess you have to learn to crawl before you can walk, right, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, sure... Anyway, it looks like the camera only went off once last night.\nCamera Data added to the Court Record.\nComputer (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nHey, Pearly, do you know what this is? It's a computer!\nPearl:\nA \"kom-pu-ter\"...? Oh! I've heard of those! It has such a cute name!\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like this computer is for storing the data from the security camera. When someone comes in or out of the warehouse, the camera takes a photo of them.\nPearl:\nIt's probably the \"trap\" that the detective set up.\nWooden box\nPhoenix:\nThat pathetic-looking wooden box...\nMaya:\nAhh!! That's the box that had the Sacred Urn on it!\nPhoenix:\nDon't touch it! There may be clues to the thief's identity on there!\nMaya:\nGrr... I worked so hard to make that box!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? You MADE that poor excuse for a box, Maya?\nMaya:\nWhat's that supposed to mean!?\nPearl:\nThat urn has always been on its stand in the Winding Way of Fey Manor. So there was no box suitable for it, Mr. Nick.\nMaya:\nAnd I-I was so proud of it... *sniffle sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Maya. Maybe it'd have been better if Mask\u2606DeMasque had taken the box, too...)\nShichishito\nMaya:\nWow, this is awesome. What did Ms. Andrews say it was called again?\nPhoenix:\n\"Shichishito\". It's literally \"7 Branch Sword\" in Japanese. Or so says Ms. Andrews. Whoa... It's pretty heavy.\nMaya:\n\"One hit, seven times the fun!\" Pretty catchy, huh? I bet it'd sell like hotcakes!\nPearl:\nUm, there's something about it that bothers me...\nMaya:\nWow! You're really firing on all cylinders today, Pearly!\nPearl:\nThis sword... Wasn't Mystic Ami holding it last night?\nMaya:\nAh...\nPearl:\nAnd another thing... The sword wasn't bent last night like it is now.\nPhoenix:\nY-You're right...\nMaya:\nAwesome, Pearly! I wouldn't expect any less from my little Ace Apprentice!\nPhoenix:\n(The sword is bent, so that must mean... Last night, someone \"used it\" somehow...)\nMaya:\nAha. I just thought of something! Maybe Detective Atmey smashed Mask\u2606DeMasque with it. Like this!\nPhoenix:\nYEOOOOOUCCCH!! WHAT THE HECK!\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Pearly?\nPearl:\nI think it's even more bent than it was before.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh man... My head...

MY HAIR!)\nDoor to the storeroom\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's that big door over there?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's the door to the actual storeroom. I can see lots of big boxes and stuff back there.\nMaya:\nI guess that's where they were keeping the Sacred Urn.\nPhoenix:\nRemember, Maya. Ms. Andrews said we're not allowed in there.\nSpilled paint\nMaya:\nLook what you did, Nick! You spilled paint over here!\nPhoenix:\nI didn't do that!\nMaya:\nWell it wasn't here last night. I would have noticed a color this outrageous.\nPearl:\nBut this paint has already dried up.\nMaya:\nWell then, you should have cleaned it up before it dried, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nPaint doesn't dry that fast! Besides, I told you it wasn't me! (It looks like it's been several days since it was spilt.) Hey, look at this!\nPearl:\nWhat is it?\nPhoenix:\nThere's some kind of shape left in the bottom left side of this stain.\nMaya:\nHuh? ...You're right. I wonder what it could be...?\nAmi Fey statue\nMaya:\nThis statue of Mystic Ami is sooo cool. I want a gold statue of myself! We could put it in the office!\nPhoenix:\nHey! It's WRIGHT & Co.! How about a gold statue of ME?\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? I'm sorry, but I noticed something strange...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What is it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nThe statue of Mystic Ami... Was this where it was last night?\nMaya:\nAh...\nPearl:\nI'm pretty sure it was closer to the door...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I think you're right.\nMaya:\nGreat job, Pearly!

Gumshoe.\nPhoenix:\nGumshoe! What is it? What's so funny!?\nGumshoe:\nI'll tell you what's funny, pal! I finally beat him! I beat Mr. Ace Detective! Finally! This underdog is the alpha dog today! That stuck-up detective's met his match! Yup! I finally caught him! Lock, stock and barrel! There's no escape for him!\nMaya:\nYou \"caught him\"? ...Are you saying...? You... You captured Mask\u2606DeMasque!?\nGumshoe:\nBingoooo! Well... Actually, he surrendered... ...But I still got him!\nPhoenix:\n(Mask\u2606DeMasque surrendered?)\nPearl:\nThat's great! So when can we come and pick up the Sacred Urn?\nGumshoe:\nUm, ahh, well ya see... I was gonna tell you...\nPhoenix:\nWhat...? Something wrong?\nGumshoe:\nDo you think you can swing by the detention center sometime?\nPhoenix:\nThe detention center...? (Changed from [Detention center...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nHe wants to talk to you... Mask\u2606DeMasque, that is.\nMaya:\nWhaaaat!? He wants to talk to Nick?\nGumshoe:\nI'll be waiting for you, pal. So get over here soon.\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n(The detention center, huh?)\nOctober 12Atmey Detective Agency\nPhoenix:\nThis is a detective agency? Looks like more like the set of some B-grade horror movie.\nMaya:\nH-Hello? Is anyone here...?\n...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like nobody's home.\nMaya:\nHmph. What a waste of time. Hey! I know! Let's take that framed picture back with us as a memento!\nPhoenix:\nDon't you dare, Maya! (Guess we'll have to try back later...)\nExamine\nGramophone\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. What's this thing here?\nPhoenix:\nIt's called a \"gramophone\". In the old days, people used them to listen to music.\nMaya:\nYou can't be serious! I think it's probably for purifying the air or something. I'll bet you 50 cents! Come on, what do you say?\nPhoenix:\nForget it. You never pay up when you lose.\nLuke Atmey painting\nPhoenix:\nWhat a creepy painting. It's like he's looking right at me.\nMaya:\nMaybe we should put up a big portrait of you in the office, Nick! I can even paint it for you. Maybe you can pose while cleaning the toilet?\nPhoenix:\n...I think I'd prefer something a bit more dignified.\nFireplace\nMaya:\nWhoa! It's a huge hearth!\nPhoenix:\nThat's a fireplace.\nMaya:\nSo? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nR-Right... sorry.\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nThat's one impressive bookshelf filled with some very impressive books!\nMaya:\n\"My Life as an Ace Detective: Unabridged Edition\" by Luke Atmey, Ace Detective.\nPhoenix:\nHey, he's even got one of those ships in a bottle thingies.\nMaya:\nAh! Would you look at that! There's a little Luke Atmey doll at the helm! How cute!\nPhoenix:\nThere's a microscope here, too. I wonder if he was researching something. The glass slides have different names on them.\nMaya:\nThis one says... \"Atmey Virus\", ...Hmm. This guy is just dying to make a name for himself, huh.\nPhoenix:\nIt's getting kind of irritating, actually.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nThis desk is literally covered with all sorts of chemistry equipment.\nMaya:\nOh, I just love chemistry! Say, Nick, I bet you didn't know this, but... Water is made up of carbon and hydrogen!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no. Not carbon! Oxygen! Oxygen and hydrogen!\nMaya:\nOh? Well, there are always alternative theories, I guess.\nPhoenix:\n(If by \"alternative theories\" you mean the ones you make up inside that head of yours.)\nOctober 12\nDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal! Welcome to the detention center!\nPhoenix:\nYou're sure in a happy mood, aren't you?\nGumshoe:\nYup. After all, we got Mask\u2606DeMasq--\nMaya:\nRight, but... Um... So where's the Sacred Urn?\nGumshoe:\nOh, Sorry about that, pal... I guess I didn't really think about it before... But you're the \"victim\" in this case.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I guess I should let you guys hear the story straight from the horse's mouth.\nMaya:\nYou know, he's right, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nHe is?\nMaya:\nIf you think about it reeeeal hard, we are the victims!\nPhoenix:\nWell... I guess so... In a way...\n???:\nUmm...\nMaya:\nI'm so used to thinking of the victim as a dead person 'cause we're always on murder cases.\n???:\nEx-Excuse me...\nMaya:\nBut anyway! I have to get the Sacred Urn back!\n???:\nPleeeeease! Don't just ignore meeeeee! ...Err.\nMaya:\n...Um, who are you?\n???:\n...I, err, umm. I-I-I... I-I'm Ma-Ma-Ma... Mask\u2606DeMasque...? ...O-OK?\nMaya:\n... Hey, Nick... Doesn't he look kind of... well, gangly?\nRon:\nI'm Ron DeLite... Th-The famous Mask\u2606DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\n(...I don't think this guy could punch his way out of a wet paper bag.)\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera.\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He looks nervous being this close to an alleged thief.\nTalk\nMask\u2606DeMasque\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're the Masque DeMask guy?\nRon:\nY-Yes! You bet! ... No... Err, that's wrong. You see... it's complicated. Sort of yes, and sort of no. If you know what I mean\nPearl:\nHm? What's wrong?\nRon:\nWell when I say \"wrong\", what I really mean to say is that it's \"not right\", per se. You see it's not spelled \"Masque DeMask\", it's actually \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\"...\nMaya:\n...What's with this guy?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, he's a timid little weakling, we know that much.)\nRon:\nD-Don't do that... Don't look at me like that! I don't need your pityyyyy!\nPhoenix:\n(And a major crybaby, too.) So... Why did you give yourself up?\nRon:\nWell, you see... It's because... Well...\nMaya:\nI know why! It's because you stole such a priceless treasure! And now you're overwhelmed with guilt. Am I right!?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Priceless treasure\"? That broken old urn...?)\nRon:\nUmm... I have a little favor to ask...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes? What is it?\nRon:\nCould you... go and talk to Dessie?\nMaya:\n...D-Dessie?\nSacred Urn\nMaya:\nLook, we really want our urn back, so where is it?\nRon:\nI'm sorry! I'll give it back! I really will! ...Err, maybe not. No, I can't... I can't make promises I can't keep... I'll just end up hurting people\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick...? I couldn't hear what he just said... Especially the last part.\nPhoenix:\nUm, Mr. DeMasque? Do you think you could speak up a little?\nRon:\nY-Y-Y-Yes, sir! I will... I promise! ...Err, maybe not. You see, I'm already speaking in my normal voice, so I really can't do anything\nMaya:\nMr. DeMasque? About the urn...\nRon:\nOh! Yes! The urn! Right away! ...Err, actually no. I wouldn't mind telling you, but actually I'm afraid you wouldn't believe me anyway\nMaya:\nEnough already! Just tell it to us straight!\nRon:\nPlease... Please don't yell at meeee! *huff huff huff* I... I... I'm sorry... That urn... I... I-I lost it!\nMaya:\nWh-Wha-What!?\nLost it? (appears after \"Sacred Urn\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you just say? Did you say you \"lost it\"?\nRon:\nYes... Er, no. Umm... Maybe so. I mean, yes, I lost it!\nMaya:\nWh-What do you mean...?\nRon:\nWell, you know... I lost it, like I said... These things just happen... You're on the train and you get distracted and you forgot your bag. You know...\nMaya:\nWhat!? You forgot our Sacred Urn on a train!?\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute! You went on the train dressed like that!?\nRon:\nN-No! I... I... I was just speaking hypothetically, that's all. A-Anyway... I'm sooooorry! I just lost it somewhere! I don't know where!\nPhoenix:\n... (This guy's story is more surreal than a Dali painting.)\nMaya:\nAre you really sure this creep is Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nMaya, don't call him a \"creep\". (Although I do have to admit, I understand your doubts about this guy...)\nDessie (appears after \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this Dessie person?\nRon:\n...! Pleeeease don't talk about my wife like that!\nMaya:\n...I-I guess she must be his wife...\nRon:\n*huff huff huff* I'm sorry! The truth is... It was my wife that told me to have you all come here... Um... Do you think you could go and visit her at my hideout?\nPhoenix:\nH... Hideout?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What does he mean by \"hideout\"...?\nRon:\nOh, sorry. Naturally, I meant to say my \"secret base\".\nPhoenix:\nS-Secret base?\nRon:\nWell, my apartment actually. Palazzo Pelpepe, 3rd floor...\nMaya:\nLet's go have a look, Nick! To Mask\u2606DeMasque's hideout!\nPhoenix:\n(Something tells me she just likes the sound of the word \"hideout\".)\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nRon:\nI'm really sorry I caused so much trouble.\nMaya:\nIf you're so sorry, then you shouldn't have stolen it in the first place!\nRon:\nB-But... The only thing I did wrong was lose it! ...Err, that's not right. I was wrong either way. I'm sure the owners of the other treasures fell the same\nMaya:\n...He sure seems sorry.\nPearl:\nWho would have imagined that such a famous thief would have such a pure heart...\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nRon:\nOh! That's Mask\u2606DeMasque's calling card! Pretty nice-looking, huh!?\nMaya:\nHe looks so happy...\nRon:\nI'm not very good at writing, you see... So I bought a book called \"How to Write Business Letters\" and studied hard!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess you could call thievery a type of business...)\nMask\u2606DeMasque profile\nRon:\nEver since I was a little boy, I've always been interested in mysterious masked men!\nPhoenix:\nSo that's what you wanted to be when you grew up?\nRon:\nYes! ...Err, no. Sort of, but not exactly... I never imagined I'd feel as bad as I do now about the treasures being stolen...\nPhoenix:\n(...People sure can be complicated, can't they.)\nLuke Atmey profile\nRon:\nH-Him...!\nPhoenix:\nDo you know him? He claims to be your arch-enemy and rival.\nRon:\nTh-That person... He... He's not my arch-enemy OR my rival! ...Well, actually, no. Now that I think about it, the terms arch-enemy and rival are the same thing\nMaya:\nThey ARE rivals! Only people who have it out for each other would disagree like this!\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this?\nRon:\nHmm... I don't really think I can help you with that. Err, no, that's not it... Well... The thing is... I don't really know if I can say one way or the other\nMaya:\nI didn't really catch that.\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry, you didn't miss anything.\nAfter clearing \"Dessie\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nOctober 12\nMask\u2606DeMasque's Hideout\nPhoenix:\n... Wow, check this place out!\nMaya:\nNo doubt about it, this is Mask\u2606DeMasque's hideout alright.\n???:\nWho is it? Is that you, Ronnie? Huh? Who are you people?\nPhoenix:\nErr, umm... Are you \"Dessie\" DeLite? (Changed from [Err, umm... Are you Desir\u00e9e DeLite?] in the original release)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nThat's right. I'm Desir\u00e9e. ... Ah! Oh! You must be the lawyer... and the victim!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's us. Your husband told us to stop by and speak with you. (Changed from [Y-Yeah, that's us. Your husband told us that you wanted us to stop by.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nI'm Maya Fey, and this is Phoenix Wright, attorney at law.\nDesir\u00e9e:\n\"Nicky boy\" and Maya, huh? I can't tell you how grateful I am that you decided to help my Ronnie.\nMaya:\nWell, um... Aha ha... You're welcome.\nPhoenix:\n(Did she really call me \"Nicky boy\"?)\nExamine\nHot air balloon\nMaya:\nOh, that's so cute! It's called a hot air balloon, you know!\nPhoenix:\n...Wow! There's no fooling you!\nMaya:\nI want to make my own balloon now! I'll even let you ride in it, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(That emblem on the balloon is supposed to be top-secret. That's proof enough that Ron DeLite really is Mask\u2606DeMasque. I'd better not tell Maya. She gets kinda... scary when it comes to \"celebrities\"...)\nPiled stuff on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a whole bunch of stuff piled up over here.\nMaya:\nDuck and cover! It-It's a missile! Did you know there's d-dynamite in missiles!?\nPhoenix:\nBut they're not heavy enough to be real... Oh wait. They're just really well-made toys.\nMaya:\nWhat are these rolls of paper stuck in the trash can? \"Theft of the Mazarin Stone: The Great Albatross Strategy\" \"Theft of the Immortal Goddess Statue: The Great Knucklebomber Strategy\"\nPhoenix:\n... (Did the police even investigate this place...?)\nGreen envelope\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Look on top of the chair!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like an envelope... And a letter.\nMaya:\nWell, don't just stand there! Come on, let's read it!\nPhoenix:\nMaya, you know we shouldn't do that!\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about? That letter could be an important clue!\nPhoenix:\nNo way. You can't just go reading a private letter because you feel like it.\nMaya:\n...Hmph! It's not just because I \"feel like it\". It really could be important!\nPhoenix:\n(If I was sure it was a clue, I guess I wouldn't mind...)\nMasks and beard\nPhoenix:\nIt's a bunch of cheap costume pieces arranged inside a nice frame.\nMaya:\nL-Look, Nick! It's a fake beard!\nPhoenix:\nThere's also a mask made out of cardboard...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Try on this fake beard! Come on! Try it on!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey! Cut it out...\nMaya:\nNow put on the mask! ... Aha ha ha ha ha ha! It's Phoenix\u2606DeMasque! Let's borrow it for a while.\nPhoenix:\n(No way! I'm not stealing from a thief! I have enough bad karma as is!)\nHelmet and transceiver\nPhoenix:\n(Hmmm... This thing looks vaguely familiar.)\nMaya:\nOh, I know! It's a fishbowl! Well, an upside-down one, anyway...\nPhoenix:\nI think it's a helmet. ...An alien helmet.\nMaya:\nAnd that looks like a tape recorder or something next to it.\nPhoenix:\nI think it's a transceiver. ...An alien transceiver.\nMaya:\nNick... Do you think maybe you could act like a grown-up for a little bit?\nPhoenix:\n(Getting lectured by Maya to be more of an adult. That's a new low...)\nMask\u2606DeMasque model\nMaya:\nIt's Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\nThere's a tape recorder hanging from his neck.\nMaya:\nLet me see that!\n...click...\nDeMasque:\nAha ha ha ha ha ha ha... I'll be taking this crown now! Better luck next time, gentlemen! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha...\nMaya:\n... I don't get it... What's this supposed to be, Nick?\nTorpedo\nMaya:\nNick! It-It's a torpedo!\nPhoenix:\n...It's hard to believe, but it sure looks real.\nMaya:\nWhere could he have picked up something like this?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't say that torpedoes are things people just leave lying around.\nBooks\nPhoenix:\nThere are a bunch of books lying here. They're all romantic-sounding novels about famous heists and fantastic thieves.\nMaya:\nWow! Look at all the bookmarks and notes stuck into them!\nPhoenix:\nLet's see here... \"Note: Must remember this thief's way of laughing. Very useful.\" \"Note: A calling card is an important part of any good thief's modus operandi!\"\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nW-Wow, Ron really studied his stuff!\nTalk\nRon DeLite\nPhoenix:\nUmm, about your husband...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nHee hee, isn't he cutest? A bit weak sometimes though...\nPhoenix:\n...\"A bit\"?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nBy the way, did you know they mentioned Maya on TV?\nMaya:\nHuh? Really!?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nThey said you own the urn and that you're doing some shady training at a law office now.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me not to watch that channel's news program.)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nAfter I saw that, I thought it might be a good idea to meet the lawyer they mentioned.\nPhoenix:\n...I see.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nMy Ronnie... He has a powerful imagination and gets deluded easily. He kept insisting he was going to surrender to the police. I didn't know what to do! \"It was me! I stole that urn!\" he kept saying! As if it was even possible!\nMaya:\nHuh...? B-But... Are you saying he didn't?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nHa ha ha. Of course he didn't! Why would my Ronnie ever do something like that?\nMaya:\nW-Well, you know... It's a p-priceless treasure! And-And he's... You know...\nPhoenix:\n(...Is it possible his own wife doesn't know his secret identity?)\nDesir\u00e9e DeLite\nDesir\u00e9e:\nMe? I'm the kind of woman that needs excitement in her life!\nMaya:\nOh... Excitement, huh?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYes. I'm at my happiest when I'm racing along with my bike going at full throttle. Riding a motorcycle is like putting your life on the line. You know what I mean?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I think that depends on how you ride it...)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nI'm the type that can't stand living a boring, dreary old life with no action.\nMaya:\nNo offense, but your husband, Ron, doesn't exactly look like the risk-taking type himself.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYou're right about that. He's definitely not one for thrills and danger. But I do have to say that he makes up for it in other ways.\nPhoenix:\nOther ways...?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYes, money... Ronnie is incredibly rich... And super generous. He bought me a bike that's so fast it would make your head spin. And shopping? I like to shop so much it makes Ron's head spin. The other day, it actually happened. His head actually started to spin.\nPhoenix:\n(Man, talk about a high maintenance wife...)\nMaya:\nSo where does Mr. DeLite get all this money from?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nRonnie is a security guard. They put their lives on the line, right? So they get paid tons of money in return. Tons of it.\nPhoenix:\n(He's a security guard...? I think it's my turn for my head to spin...)\nThe night of the crime (appears after \"Desir\u00e9e DeLite\")\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell us about what happened last night?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nHmm, what time did that incident take place again?\nPhoenix:\nWhat time was it again, Maya?\nMaya:\nWell, according to Detective Gumshoe, it was around 1:30 in the morning.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nAh, last night was horrible. I got pulled over!\nMaya:\nP-Pulled over?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYes... I always do my best flying at night!\nPhoenix:\n\"Flying\"...? Um, you're talking about your motorcycle, right?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYes. Anyway, last night I got pulled over. By a policeman. I can't believe he caught up to me! It was a great chase, let me tell you! When he finally caught me, the poor man was as white as a sheet. It was about three in the morning when I finally got home.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like she's got an airtight alibi...)\nMaya:\nWell, what about Mr. DeLite?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nI don't really know... We weren't together at that time of the night. But when I got home, he was already fast asleep.\nPhoenix:\n(So basically he's got no alibi...)\nDelusions (appears after presenting Mask\u2606DeMasque profile)\nPhoenix:\nSo... When did Ron first become Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nWhat are you talking about? He's not Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? But... W-Wait a second! Look around at this room! This place is obviously Mask\u2606DeMasque's hideout...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nNo no, you're totally wrong. A real thief's hideout wouldn't look like this! It's because Ronnie is so timid himself that he looks up to heroic figures.\nMaya:\nHeroic figures? But Mask\u2606DeMasque is a bad guy.\nPhoenix:\n(So he's \"deluded\", huh... Could that really be true?)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nAnyway, if he really had stolen the urn, wouldn't he still have it?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, I suppose so...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nThen why don't you ask him if he has the urn or not?\nPhoenix:\n(She has a point. Mr. DeLite isn't exactly the criminal type... But something about Ron's behavior bothers me.)\nMaya:\nMaybe it's true... Maybe Mr. DeLite isn't Mask\u2606DeMasque after all.\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster, Ami Fey's Golden Statue, Sacred Urn, or Shichishito\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOoh! That's so mysterious looking... I love old stuff like this!\nMaya:\nReally!? That's one of our most treasured possessions! There's going to be a whole exhibit at Lordly Tailor with these types of things!\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks so happy. She's lit up like a 1,000 watt bulb.)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nTerrific! You can count on Ronnie and me to be there! Sounds like fun!\nMaya:\nHuh! ...Oh, err, yeah... Ha ha ha...\nPhoenix:\n(Oops, looks like that light bulb is starting to flicker.)\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nPhoenix:\nUmm, so what do you know about this...?\nMaya:\nNo! You can't show her that, Nick! That emblem is top-secret! Don't you remember!?\nPhoenix:\n...Doh! Oops, sorry about that. (But the way she just said \"top-secret\" was a worse giveaway than what I did...)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOoh! When I hear the word \"top-secret\", it just piques my interest like nothing else!\nPhoenix Wright profile\nDesir\u00e9e:\nSo, Nicky boy, you're a lawyer, huh?\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nHow do you like it? I bet it's SO exciting!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, sometimes. Actually, a little too exciting at times.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOooh! I just love a good thrill. Hmm... Nicky boy... It sounds like you have it so nice...\nPhoenix:\n(Um... This is starting to get awkward.)\nMaya Fey profile\nDesir\u00e9e:\nThat's really amazing! A \"Master\" at your age!\nMaya:\nOh no, you've got it wrong. It's my mother that's the current Master!\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOh, I see... So what exactly is she the master of anyway?\nMaya:\nWell, you see, it's li-\nPhoenix:\nDon't say it, Maya. If you say \"spirit channeling\", she'll laugh.\nMaya:\nOuch... That hurt.\nMask\u2606DeMasque profile\nPhoenix:\n...Um, Ms. DeLite. You must know, right? About your husband and Mask\u2606DeMasque...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nMask\u2606DeMasque? Of course. I know all about it. My husband is his biggest fan.\nMaya:\nYup... Wha...? ...Huh?\nPhoenix:\nB-Biggest fan?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYes, and Ronnie can be pretty delusional sometimes. That's how this whole misunderstanding happened.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a minute! Did you say \"delusional\"!?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYes, that's right. I just don't know what I'm going to do with him... You see, Ronnie actually believes that HE is Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nMaya:\nWH-WHAAAAT!? What are you talking about!?\nRon DeLite profile\nDesir\u00e9e:\nI know he doesn't look it... But he can really get things done when he puts his mind to it.\nMaya:\nReally? So when exactly does he put his mind to it?\nDesir\u00e9e:\n...Well. Not very often, I admit.\nPhoenix:\n(What exactly does Ms. DeLite see in her husband anyway?)\nMaya:\nWow, you must've really seen skyrockets when you first met to love him so much!\nPhoenix:\nSkyrockets...? I didn't know people still used that word.\nDesir\u00e9e DeLite profile\nDesir\u00e9e:\nAs long as I've got my motorcycle and my Ronnie, I'm happy.\nMaya:\nOh! That's so sweet!\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOh, that plus a little excitement and a little shopping money! ...THEN I'm happy.\nMaya:\nNow she's starting to sound a bit greedy... Don't you think, Nick?\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, but would you take a look at this...?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOh, I'm sorry... I haven't the faintest idea. I guess I just don't get out enough.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nDesir\u00e9e:\nSay... Can I ask you something, Nicky boy?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nI know I may seem like a \"bad girl\" on the outside... But the one thing I won't stand for is illegal activity.\nMaya:\nI had the feeling you wouldn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart. (Changed from [I had the feeling you didn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart.] in the original release)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nSomebody framed my poor Ronnie, I just know it. Umm... Could you give this to Ronnie for me?\nMaya:\nA letter?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYes, for Ronnie. I want him to fight back.\nMaya:\nMs. DeLite... OK, you've got it! Just relax and leave it all to us!\nDesir\u00e9e's Letter added to the Court Record.\nPresent\nDesir\u00e9e's Letter\nDesir\u00e9e:\nCould you please give that to my Ronnie? The contents are very important.\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* Back to the detention center I go...)\nDetention Center\nPresent\nDesir\u00e9e DeLite profile\nRon:\nThat's my lovely wife! Isn't she beautiful?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she sure is...\nPearl:\n... *glare*\nPhoenix:\n(Whoo boy. The one topic I didn't want to get into in front of Pearls...)\nRon:\nBut... Dessie doesn't approve of my... \"interests\". So I'm afraid she doesn't like me anymore... What should I do? If I want to win her back, I'm really going to have to be super honest.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy. he's gone back into his own little world again...)\nDesir\u00e9e's Letter\nPhoenix:\n...Oh, that's right! Here. This is from your wife.\nRon:\nOh? From Dessie!? Thank you!\nLetter given to Mask\u2606DeMasque. ... Actually, more like \"taken\".\nRon:\n\"My dear Ronnie, how are you? I'm doing fine...\" ...\nPhoenix:\n(He's clutching onto that letter so hard, the ink is going to be squeezed out...)\nMaya:\nHe looks so happy...\nPearl:\nYou should write a letter to Mystic Maya too, Mr. Nick!\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Desir\u00e9e's Letter:\nRon:\n... Umm... Mr. Lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nRon:\nIn the letter that Dessie wrote, she said... \"Ask this guy to be your lawyer!\"\nMaya:\nHuh...?\nRon:\nErr, umm... I know this would be asking a lot, but... Could you please take my case? My trial starts tomorrow...\nMaya:\nHey, hang on a second! He can't be your lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nWhy not?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean, \"why not\"!? We're the victims in this case, right!? Victims of this DeMasque guy!\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah... But according to Desir\u00e9e, he didn't do it...\nPearl:\nShe said, \"Poor man, he's deluded himself into thinking he did it.\" Right, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nCome on! She could be lying to protect her husband!\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, that's true. ...Err, no actually not. Actually it's hard to say (...Oh no, it's spreading!)\nRon:\nOh, please! I'll give you the treasure of your choice in return...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... What should I do?)\nTake his case\nPhoenix:\n...Well, Mr. DeLite, I've decided to give it a try. I'll defend you.\nRon:\nReally? You will?\nMaya:\nHey! What're you doing, Nick!?\nPearl:\nHe... He's a thief! You can't trust him!\nPhoenix:\nWell, he may be a thief... But I think there's more to this case than meets the eye.\nLeads to:\n\"M-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\"\nRefuse his case\nMaya:\nDon't do it, Nick! He's a thief!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I agree with Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I admit something about this guy stinks like last week's sushi. I guess I really should say no. But... If I do that, this poor guy will have nobody on his side!) ...Well, Mr. DeLite, I've decided to take your case.\nRon:\nReally? You will?\nLeads to:\n\"M-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\"\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\nPhoenix:\nP-Pearls...?\nPearl:\nI can't believe you'd defend this person after what he did to Mystic Maya...! I-I... I'll never forgive you... EVER! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\nMaya:\nP-! Pearly...! Wait!\nPhoenix:\n(This is going to be ugly...)\nMaya:\nI-I'll go after her!\nRon:\nUmm... Sorry about that. I didn't mean to cause any trouble...\nPhoenix:\nWell... You couldn't have known she'd react like that. (I guess I might as well start investigating...) Oh, Maya... Where's Pearls?\nMaya:\nShe said she's going back to the office. Go check in on her later, would you?\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about you...? Are you OK with me taking Mr. DeLite's case...?\nMaya:\nY-Yeah... I'm fine, Nick. I believe in you.\nPhoenix:\n... *sniffle* (I think I'm going to cry.)\nRon:\nUmm... I, err... I know you have a lot of work to do... I... I really appreciate it.\nMaya:\nOK, Nick! Let's get this show on the road!\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. The camera doesn't seem to have a lot to tape right now. The only thing it's watching now is that guard over there.\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. It looks like he doesn't have much to do right now. I can tell because he's looking at the camera and making funny faces.\nOctober 12Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nAh... Mr. Nick! W-Welcome back!\nPhoenix:\nOh, hey Pearls. You're back too, I see.\nPearl:\nI, um... I went and bought us a strawberry cake! I'll go make some tea to go with it!\nPhoenix:\nHey, uh Pearls... ...\nMaya:\nIt looks like she feels really bad about what happened at the detention center...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\nPearl:\nI-I... I'll never forgive you... EVER!\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! The tea is ready!\nMaya:\nOh... Thanks...\nPearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Please have some of this cake!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Thanks. Umm, Pearls?\nPearl:\nOh! Ex-Excuse me... I was in the middle of cleaning the toilet...!\nPhoenix:\nHey, it's OK! I just cleaned it this morning...\nMaya:\nToo late...\nPhoenix:\n(...This might be a good time for me to ask about her.)\nExamine\nCharley the plant\nPhoenix:\nCharley. A quite decorative plant. When she was alive, Mia really loved it. She even went so far as to make it our mascot. No matter how busy I get, I never forget to water this little fella.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nIt's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so the dust bunnies are starting to mount their assault. Hm? Today it's sparkly clean. I guess Pearls must've wiped them out for me.\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. These were all Mia's... Wow, I just realized I didn't buy a single one of these.\nTalk\nPearl\nPhoenix:\n(I first met Pearls a year ago... It was when that murder happened at Kurain Village. I still remember what she said to me when we first met...)\nPearl:\nYou... You're Mr. Nick, right? You're... You're Mystic Maya's... \"special someone\"...\nPhoenix:\n...Hey, Maya. I've always thought it was because she was young, but...\nMaya:\nBut what...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls... I think she's got the wrong idea. About... you and me. (Changed from [About... you and I.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nHuh!? Err, I... ...Umm...There's something you need to understand...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nMaya:\nUmm... It's kind of like a Kurain Village custom... Sort of.\nMaya\nPhoenix:\nPearls seems to love you a lot.\nMaya:\nWell, it's because I'm her only cousin. And... well... Because of the murder case last year, Pearly's mother is...\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah...\nPhoenix:\n(I remember now... Pearls's mother, Morgan Fey... She's serving a prison term in isolation right now...)\nMaya:\nSo you see? I'm the only family Pearly has right now... But... It's the same for me, too.\nPhoenix:\nMaya...\nMaya:\nMy mother's gone, too...\nKurain Village Custom (appears after \"Pearl\")\nMaya:\nThere are hardly any men in Kurain Village.\nPhoenix:\nNow that you mention it, I never actually saw any men there when I visited.\nMaya:\nI'm pretty sure I told you about it a long time ago... About how spiritual powers run very strong in the Fey family.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you did. And that's why you're undergoing training to be a spirit medium, right?\nMaya:\nYeah... The thing is, only women can actually inherit the spiritual power. That's why the whole culture of Kurain Village kinda revolves around its women.\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's understandable... Nothing wrong with that.\nMaya:\nYeah, but because of that... There tends to be a lot of unsuccessful marriages.\nPhoenix:\nOh?\nMaya:\nWell, men start to feel left out after a while, and then they just start leaving. ...Especially if the man has a daughter.\nPhoenix:\nAre you saying that Pearls's father...?\nMaya:\n...He's gone. He left the village when she was very young.\nPhoenix:\nBoy, that's tough...\nMaya:\nYeah, and she grew up seeing nothing but unhappy marriages all around her. That's why she's so sensitive to things like that.\nMaya's mother (appears after \"Maya\")\nPhoenix:\nSo your mother's still missing...?\nMaya:\nYeah... And no one has any idea where she is.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's mother... Misty Fey. The current Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She disappeared 17 years ago after getting involved in a certain police case.)\nPhoenix:\n...But you're sure she's still alive, right?\nMaya:\nYeah... I know she is... It's sort of a spirit medium thing...\nPhoenix:\nAnd if your mother doesn't come back, then what...?\nMaya:\nThen according to the laws of the village, I'll become the next Master.\nPhoenix:\nMystic Maya... The Master of the Kurain Technique... Sounds like a heavy responsibility.\nMaya:\nYeah, but there's no one else with the blood of the Fey main family who's a spirit medium.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nSo you've still got that badge, I see.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I?\nMaya:\nYeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job.\nPhoenix:\n(...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.)\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nMaya:\nYou know, I thought we'd finally found the urn.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, if only Ron DeLite were Mask\u2606DeMasque, we'd have figured it all out.\nMaya:\nHuh? You mean he's NOT Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Desir\u00e9e says he isn't and I believe her.\nMaya:\nHmm... The mystery gets deeper and deeper.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and the trial starts tomorrow... as usual.\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nPhoenix:\nSo this was made by the real Mask\u2606DeMasque, huh?\nMaya:\nYup, Detective Gumshoe said it was the real thing. \"One look at this mark and you know it's the real deal, pal.\"\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but you do realize whose deductive reasoning skills we're talking about, right...?\nShichishito\nMaya:\nThis sword... It has a strange aura surrounding it. It's like it's infused with a spirit of both anger and tragedy.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'd be mad too if somebody bent me the way they bent this sword.\nMaya:\n...Yeah, I guess that could be it.\nPhoenix Wright profile\nMaya:\nWhen did you first get that porcupine cut?\nPhoenix:\n...Um, it's been like this ever since I was a little kid.\nMaya:\nWhat!? You mean that's the way your hair is naturally? I thought you had some sort of special \"Phoenix Cut\" deal with the barber. I mean... You usually only see hair like that in a video game.\nMia Fey profile\nPhoenix:\nIf it wasn't for Mia, I wouldn't be the person I am today.\nMaya:\nYeah, she told me you used to really be useless. Compared to how unreliable you were then, you actually seem responsible now. ...Actually, you haven't changed that much, I guess.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya praised me for a change! ...Hey, wait a second...)\nPearl Fey profile\nMaya:\nI'm so sorry that Pearly said what she did.\nPhoenix:\nOh, It's fine... It-It was nothing... (I'm going to have to smooth things over with Pearls later somehow...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe's on this case too, huh.\nPhoenix:\nHe seems to show up during all of our cases. It can't be a coincidence.\nMaya:\nMaybe it's a sign that our fates are destined to be woven together for all time!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that'd be a real Beauty and the Beast kind of fairy tale, wouldn't it.\nMask\u2606DeMasque or Ron DeLite profile\nMaya:\nSo the real identity of Mask\u2606DeMasque is... ...Ron DeLite, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what Mr. DeLite claims. ...But I'm not too convinced about something he said.\nMaya:\nHuh? About what?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the Sacred Urn. Didn't he sound a little vague on the subject?\nMaya:\nYeah, now that you mention it, he said that he simply \"lost it\", right?\nPhoenix:\n(I have this distinct feeling that he's hiding something. I just know it...)\nLuke Atmey profile\nMaya:\nThat Detective Atmey guy really surprised me. There was this certain something about the way he said, \"Zvarri!\"\nPhoenix:\nWell he did manage to get back the treasure that the Mask guy stole last time, right? And he did it by himself, too.\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess. ...That case has certainly made him famous.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he does deserve to be called \"Ace Detective\" after all.\nDesir\u00e9e DeLite profile\nMaya:\nThat Desir\u00e9e sure is cool! I love that whole motorcycle thing! The way she laughs in the face of death... I want to try it myself!\nPhoenix:\nI thought you only knew how to ride a bike...\nMaya:\nHey! Don't forget, Nick, that it's an electric bike!\nPhoenix:\n...E-Electric? So young and already so lazy. Whatever happened to good old exercise?\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this?\nMaya:\nHmmm... It seems like it has something to do with this case... But I'm not really sure...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\nWell, Nick! Why don't we go out and start investigating? We're not going to learn anything just sitting around the office!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know... But... First I want to talk to Pearls...\nPearl:\n...Umm, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah...?\nPearl:\nI... I acted like a baby.\nPhoenix:\nPearls...\nPearl:\nI doubted you... Even though Mystic Maya trusted you completely... I guess I still have a lot of training to do. Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nPearl:\nI... From the bottom of my heart, I apologize for what I said!\nPhoenix:\nAww, it's OK! I'm the one that should be apologizing!\nPearl:\nWell, I'm going out now for a little bit.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Wh-Where are you going...?\nPearl:\nI may be small, but I still have a lot of spirit channeling power! So I'm going to show you I can be useful too... By finding some evidence!\nPhoenix:\nHey! W-Wait a...! (Ack! She sure runs fast...)\nMaya:\nNick... Let's back off and give her some room, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah.\nOctober 12Lordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall\nAndrews:\nM-Maya...!\nMaya:\nOh, Ms. Andrews...\nAndrews:\nI'm so sorry! It's my fault! ...Your precious urn! Your... precious... UUUUURNNN!!!\nPhoenix:\nPlease! C-Calm down! What's wrong?\nAndrews:\n*sniffle* It never ends! Everything I touch ends in failure! Maya, I'm sorry...! I'll do anything to make it up to you!\nMaya:\nN-No, it's okay, don--\nAndrews:\nI know I don't look it, but I'm good with my hands. I could make you another urn.\nMaya:\nHold on, just wait, OK? Breathe, calm down and talk to us.\nAndrews:\nF-Forgive me! Forgive me!\nExamine\nCushion\nPhoenix:\nThat's probably where the Sacred Urn was going to be displayed.\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess so...\nPhoenix:\nShould I put my attorney's badge there? You know, as a replacement?\nMaya:\nHmm... I think it's a little too small for that. What about my Magatama?\nPhoenix:\nNow you're being silly... That's definitely too small.\nFolding screen\nMaya:\nIt's the folding screen of Kurain Sacred Writings. But I can't read what it says on it.\nPhoenix:\nReally? But I thought it was some kind of important spell!\nMaya:\nAhh, yeah. My mother read it and taught me to memorize it. I'll be in trouble if I ever forget it.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like the Kurain Channeling School is teetering dangerously on the edge...)\nKurain Village diorama\nMaya:\nWow, this is incredible! It's a tiny version of my Kurain Village! Hey! I've got a great idea! We can make a miniature of your office, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI don't know about that. The whole place is overflowing with junk. You'd die before you finish painstakingly recreating that mess.\nMaya:\nWell, we could always clean it up first.\nPhoenix:\n*shrug* True.\nTalk\nDeMasque's calling card\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So when did you get the calling card from Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nAndrews:\nLet's see... Exactly 10 days ago. I was going to show it to the police... But that detective stopped me.\nMaya:\nUm, so you asked Detective Atmey to help with security?\nAndrews:\nYes. In fact, it was about 20 days ago that I hired him. He seemed to know much more about Mask\u2606DeMasque than the police.\nPhoenix:\nSo you hired him for security even before the calling card arrived?\nAndrews:\nWell, yes. I had a premonition that something bad might happen... I've learned to trust my hunches!\nPhoenix:\nSo that's why there are security cameras, even in the basement warehouse?\nAndrews:\nYes. Lordly Tailor is very serious about their security measures. It was their way of saying, \"Bring it on!\" to any potential thieves...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, he sure \"brought it\" last night... And even left with a nice souvenir.)\nThe security\nMaya:\nUm, can you tell us a bit about the security for the Treasure Exhibit?\nAndrews:\nIt was all my fault! I never should have called this paltry little collection a \"treasure exhibit\" anyway...\nPhoenix:\nWhy do you say that? The urn that was stolen is a pretty important object...\nAndrews:\nMaybe, but it's actual value after appraisal was... well, practically zero.\nMaya:\nZero!?\nAndrews:\nI polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it look more valuable!\nMaya:\nB-But that urn contains the soul of Mystic Ami...\nAndrews:\nAnyway, I left all the security arrangements to Detective Atmey. But... Five days ago, I began receiving all sorts of other exhibit items from Kurain. Lots of people started going in and out of the warehouse down there.\nMaya:\nSo maybe one of them was actually Mask\u2606DeMasque in disguise...!\nAndrews:\nNo, I personally checked out everyone that came through here, so that's not possible.\nPhoenix:\n(Knowing Adrian, she probably even checked out what they ate for breakfast that morning.)\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nI know, I know! It's all my fault! But what's done is done... I'll make it up by making a new urn for you...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm just wasting my time. She's too far gone...)\nBasement Warehouse\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nI wonder if that detective brought this camera in with him?\nMaya:\nGood question! Let's take a look at it. ...Huh? It says \"Property of Lordly Tailor\" on it.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's borrowed...?\nMaya:\nKind of strange for an \"Ace Detective\", don't you think?\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nAccording to the computer data... ...someone did in fact go through those big doors last night, right?\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess so. The shutter did go off once, you know.\nWooden box\nPhoenix:\nThat pathetic-looking wooden box...\nMaya:\nAhh!! That's the box that had the Sacred Urn on it!\nPhoenix:\nDon't touch it! There may be clues to the thief's identity on there!\nMaya:\nGrr... I worked so hard to make that box!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? You MADE that poor excuse for a box, Maya?\nMaya:\nWhat's that supposed to mean!? And I-I was so proud of it... *sniffle sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Maya. Maybe it'd have been better if Mask\u2606DeMasque had taken the box, too...)\nShichishito\nMaya:\nI'm really starting to like this thing. It's so cool-looking. I'd like to strap it to my waist and walk around town like a samurai.\nPhoenix:\nCareful. Gumshoe will lock you up and throw away the key if you're caught.\nDoor to the storeroom\nMaya:\nOur precious urn was right there on the other side of these doors.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. and according to the security computer data...\nMaya:\nSomeone was in there last night. Grrr... What I'd like to do to him...!\nSpilled paint\nPhoenix:\nIt looks to me like it's been dry for several days.\nMaya:\nThere's something suspicious about this paint mark. The bottom left part of it is shaped oddly and it's shocking pink.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't see how the color of the paint is in any way important.\nAmi Fey statue\nPhoenix:\nWhen we were here with Ms. Andrews last night, the statue wasn't there it is now.\nMaya:\nYeah, it was right next to the door, wasn't it?\nPhoenix:\nWell, if someone moved it, it was probably the criminal.\nMaya:\nMaybe he didn't like being watched by Mystic Ami while he stole the urn.\nPhoenix:\n...Hey! Cut it out! You're giving me the creeps with that kind of talk!\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co. Law Offices and clearing \"The security\" Talk option in Lordly Tailor - Main Exhibition Hall:\nOctober 12Atmey Detective Agency\nMaya:\nHello?\n...Well, well. How lovely it is to see you again, my dear.\nAtmey:\nWelcome to my abode! Relax! and soak up the atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\nErr, umm... We're actually kind of...\nAtmey:\nSHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee... Precisely as I expected.\nMaya:\nWh-What is?\nAtmey:\n...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. ...Am I correct?\nMaya:\n...Umm. I think we've already been through this.\nAtmey:\nHa! So my estimation was correct! Zvarri! ...How truly elegant. Now then, what can I do for you?\nExamine\nGramophone\nMaya:\nAaah! So the music in this room is coming from here!\nAtmey:\n\"Luke Atmey Elegy\" composed by Luke Atmey. This lovely device is called a \"gramophone\". In days of yore, people listened to music on them.\nMaya:\nAha! That's just what I thought! I told you so, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n...\nLuke Atmey painting\nMaya:\nThat's quite a large portrait of yourself you have there...\nAtmey:\nYes. I wanted it to say to everyone who saw it, \"Look at me, Luke Atmey!\" With a model so fine, I knew the portrait would also be aesthetically pleasing!\nMaya:\n...Um, that's nice.\nFireplace\nMaya:\nAaah! There's a cold breeze coming from this hearth!\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee... It seems you've fallen for my little deception. You see, this fireplace conceals a rather unexpected device. ...Yes! A high-tech air conditioner!\nMaya:\nWh-Why would you put an air conditioner in there?\nAtmey:\nIn the summer it acts as an air conditioner and in the winter, it's a heater. Clever?\nTalk\nThe night of the crime\nPhoenix:\nYou mentioned before that you were on guard all alone last night.\nAtmey:\nPrecisely. This is my fifth encounter with my arch-enemy. I refuse to allow anyone to interfere with the rightful pursuit of my prey.\nMaya:\nI heard you've been after Mask\u2606DeMasque since his very first theft?\nAtmey:\nYes, my dear. I see you've done your homework. In his very first heist, that vile thief pilfered the famous jewel, the \"Tear of Emanon\"! I first encountered him in the museum's sacred hall. The crime scene itself!\nMaya:\nSo... that's why you were hired as security for the Treasure Exhibit?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm pretty sure he said that Adrian Andrews hired him...)\nAtmey:\nYes, I borrowed some equipment from Lordly Tailor and set the perfect trap.\nPhoenix:\nYou must mean the security camera...\nMaya:\nBut I thought you were watching the area yourself, too. So how did Mask\u2606DeMasque manage to steal the urn?\nPhoenix:\nThat's the million dollar question... What is DeMasque's modus operandi?\nSacred Urn\nMaya:\nUmm... Mr. Atmey? Did you know about the Sacred Urn?\nAtmey:\nI'm interested in only one thing my dear, and that is Mask\u2606DeMasque! Sacred Urn...? Pfft! That has nothing to do with this case.\nPhoenix:\nBut... wasn't that what Mask\u2606DeMasque stole this time?\nAtmey:\nI am a hunter, sir! That urn was nothing more than a lure to catch my prey. Do you yourselves remember the shape of the individual peanuts you throw to pigeons?\nMaya:\n...I don't think I like this guy's attitude, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWell anyway, it looks like he doesn't know about the urn.\nDeMasque's M.O. (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\nMaya:\nUmm... There's something that's kind of bothering me.\nAtmey:\nPlease, my dear, ask me anything you like. After all, we are all but seekers, wandering alone in the dark.\nMaya:\nWell, I was wondering how Mask\u2606DeMasque managed to steal the urn. I mean, isn't it strange that you don't seem to know?\nAtmey:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, now that you mention it, it is strange. After all, you were on guard that night at the scene of the crime. Unless you were sound asleep, you should have at least seen Mask\u2606DeMasque.\nAtmey:\n...\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nPhoenix:\nWh-What the!? It's a Psyche-Lock...\nMaya:\nPs-Psyche Lock...?\nDeMasque's M.O. (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nMr. Atmey... You must know more than you're letting on. How did Mask\u2606DeMasque manage to steal the Sacred Urn...?\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nAtmey:\nIn order for a secret to remain a secret, it must be kept secret.\nPhoenix:\n(Last night Luke Atmey must have encountered Mask\u2606DeMasque... But why would he be trying to hide it...?)\nMaya:\nNick! Go for it! Let's break that Psyche-Lock of his!\nPhoenix:\n(...I don't really think she understands what she's talking about. Well, it's been a while, but let's give this a shot...)\nPsyche-Lock (appears after \"DeMasque's M.O.\", before breaking Psyche-Lock)\nMaya:\nHey, Nick, what is this Psyche-Lock thing?\nPhoenix:\nWell, your magatama lets me see when people are keeping secrets. By breaking their mental \"locks\", I can find out what those secrets are.\nMaya:\nWhaaaaat!? This Magatama has THAT kind of power!?\nPhoenix:\n... Maya, you're the one who gave me this Magatama last year...\nMaya:\n...Well, it's true that this Magatama is a prized Fey family heirloom, but... Pearly was the one that actually imbued it with spiritual powers, right? That's why I don't really know much about what it can do.\nPhoenix:\n(This is the woman that's going to take over the Kurain Channeling School someday!?)\nMaya:\nSo how do you do it? How do you break the Psyche-Lock thing?\nPhoenix:\n...Well, you present the Magatama to the person with the secret.\nMaya:\n...Cool! I can't wait to see it in action! Come on! Try it out!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy... I think the future Master still needs to learn how to be patient...)\nDeMasque's M.O. (after breaking Psyche-Lock)\nAtmey:\nI can't deny that there may be a small hint of \"truth\" in what you say.\nMaya:\nSo, you were knocked out when the thief first clobbered you?\nAtmey:\nClobber... What an ugly way of saying it. But I suppose you could put it that way. The coward struck at the precise moment that I turned to look at the computer.\nMaya:\nSo you never noticed that the thief had entered the warehouse?\nAtmey:\nNo, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Perhaps the air ducts or the sewer pipes... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head from behind with this gruesome item here!\nMaya:\nOuch. Mr. Atmey should have his poor head examined. (Changed from [Ouch. He should have his poor head examined.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou can say that again. How could he have underestimated the thief that badly?\nShichishito updated in the Court Record.\nDeMasque's M.O.

O.  --\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey, you were standing guard at the scene of the crime... There's no way you didn't see Mask\u2606DeMasque commit the crime.\nAtmey:\nWell now, I can hardly see why you're so positive about that. Yes, indeed I was guarding the warehouse. That much is true. But I can tell you for certain that not a single person passed through that door.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure why... But this Atmey guy is lying through his teeth. ...I know. I'll show him some proof!) Detective Atmey, I have here proof that someone went through that door last night!\nPresent Camera Data\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"There was a security camera set up at the scene of the crime.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nAtmey:\nHow very interesting that you would present such a thing to me, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective. Unfortunately... It is meaningless. You need to go home, take a long, cold shower and get a good night's rest, Sir Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that's a miss...)\nAtmey:\nWell then...? Is there something else I can do for you?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Maybe I don't have enough evidence yet. If that's true, it could be dangerous for me to push on. But I need to break him!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Detective Atmey, I have here proof that someone went through that door last night!\"\nPhoenix:\nThere was a security camera set up at the scene of the crime. It should have automatically taken a photo of anyone that went through that door.\nAtmey:\n...Precisely.\nPhoenix:\nI hope you don't mind, but we've already gotten our hands on the camera data. As you can see, the camera went off exactly once last night.\nAtmey:\nWha...! B-But my monocle didn't catch anyone in its flash! It must be some kind of computer malfunction... It-It must be...!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe it was your monocle that malfunctioned.\nAtmey:\nWh-What!? Are you saying that I didn't do my duty properly?\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey. You must have seen the thief last night. The question is why are you trying to hide it! (If he's hiding it, there must be some reason! Some reason that he desperately wants to keep hidden... And I've got just the piece of evidence that should prove it!) OK, let's suppose you didn't manage to see Mask\u2606DeMasque. In that case, the reason you didn't at that time was because you were...\nfast asleep.\nAtmey:\n...I'm afraid that making a guess is not enough. Time to put your money where your mouth is. Show me your evidence!\nPresent anything\nPhoenix:\nAtmey:\n...May I give you a piece of good advice, Sir Lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nAtmey:\n...A guess is not the same as a theory. Not scientifically, anyway. You need to go home, take a long, cold shower and get a good night's rest, Sir Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh!

You were knocked unconscious by the thief, weren't you!?\nAtmey:\nHa ha ha! Surely you must be joking... You think that I, Luke Atmey, could be knocked unconscious so easily!?\nPhoenix:\nThis sword proves it!\nAtmey:\n...! Th-That's...\nPhoenix:\nBefore the theft, this sword was in the hand of the statue of Ami Fey. Furthermore... at that time, it was not bent.\nAtmey:\nAaah... Err...\nPhoenix:\n...There's only one explanation. You were struck on the head and knocked unconscious by this sword! Well, Detective!? How about it!? (Changed from [Well, Detective!? What about it!?] in the original release)\nAtmey:\n...I'm impressed. You truly are an \"Ace Attorney\"...\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nRon DeLite profile\nAtmey:\nThis man surrendered to the police, admitting that he was Mask\u2606DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe so... But I'm not convinced that he's really behind the thefts.\nAtmey:\nHe is.\nMaya:\n...He sounds pretty sure.\nAtmey:\nJust look at his forehead. It's all in the shape of his mouth and eyes... This is the classic face of a thief. It is unmistakable!\nMaya:\nIs there anything that isn't \"unmistakable\" to you...\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this person here, Detective Atmey?\nAtmey:\n...\nMaya:\nIs something wrong? Did the cat get your tongue or something?\nAtmey:\nThat photo leaves me with a distinctly indistinct feeling.\nPhoenix:\nUmmm...\nAtmey:\nIn this case, I'm afraid my perspicacity has been left wanting.\nPhoenix:\n(I think he's trying to say that he doesn't have any information...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nWell it looks like we got one thing cleared up anyway.\nMaya:\nHuh? What? That Atmey is the greatest Ace Detective in the world?\nPhoenix:\nNo, that he never actually saw the thief.\nMaya:\nOh... that's right! So the thief may not even be Mask\u2606DeMasque...\nAtmey:\nJust one moment, Sir Lawyer! The thief was unquestionably Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nMaya:\nBut you never actually saw him!\nAtmey:\nPerhaps so, but I installed a security camera for just such a contingency.\nMaya:\nOh...\nAtmey:\nLast night, the camera went off exactly once. Behold! This is a photo of the dastardly thief, taken by the security camera!\nPhoenix:\n...Th-That's him!\nMaya:\nM-Mask\u2606DeMasque...!\nSecurity Camera Photo added to the Court Record.\nAtmey:\nThe thief can be none other than the arch-criminal, Mask\u2606DeMasque. After all, he has a very good reason for committing such brazen crimes.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you talking about?\nTalk\nDeMasque's reason\nPhoenix:\nSo... What did you mean by he had a \"very good reason\"?\nAtmey:\nExactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes. There should be a green envelope somewhere in his room. ...You'll need to go and investigate.\nMaya:\nB-But how would you know about that...?\nAtmey:\nHmph. Have you forgotten? You're speaking to the finest Ace Detective ever to walk on the face of the earth! The most brilliant mind since ...well, EVER!

Nick, do you and this girl have... you know... something going on?\nPhoenix:\n\"S-Something\"? If you mean what I thin--\nButz:\nI underestimated you, Nick! A gorgeous lady like this? ...And married, too? Way to go, dude!\nPhoenix:\n(I knew it. Just when things can't get any worse, it's time to cue in the Butz.) Larry Butz... Ever since grade school, he's been... Not exactly a close friend, but yeah, we know each other.\nButz:\nHey, man, that wasn't nice! I was your very first client!\nPhoenix:\nWe've got quite the... storied history, he and I.

You're embarrassing me! And in front of this pretty little thing here...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nSo you two are old childhood friends, I see. That's so sweet! You two go ahead and catch up on old times. I'm going to go check on my bike.\nButz:\nNice girl, that Dessie... So how have ya been, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Too busy if you really want to know...)\nExamine\nGreen envelope\nPhoenix:\nSo Ron received a blackmail letter, huh?\nMaya:\nDo you think Ms. DeLite knows about this?\nPhoenix:\nWell if she did, I don't think she would've been smiling like that.\nMaya:\nI wonder if we should tell her about it...\nPhoenix:\nI think it'd be smarter if we didn't.\nTalk\nLarry Butz\nPhoenix:\nSo what have you been up to this whole time?

Women. ...I don't trust'em anymore.\nPhoenix:\nYou got dumped again?\nButz:\nWell, you know Bennifer? I followed her all the way to Tibet 2 years ago. That's where I met the famous Katty Tom, and my whole life changed.\nPhoenix:\n\"Bennifer\"? \"Katty Tom\"? I never heard of either of them.\nButz:\nAnyway... Dude! Katty Tom chose Hollywood over me! Can you believe it?\nMaya:\nWell, actually... Anyway sounds like you had quite the adventure.\nButz:\nWomen! They're so... so... Aaaah! Oh... B-But you're different, Maya. You're not like the rest.\nPhoenix:\n(...Looks like he's still the same old Larry.)\nWhy are you here? (Changed from [Why you came here] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSo what are you doing here anyway?\nButz:\nHuh...? What do you mean by that? I'm just a natural-born nice guy, that's all. Well, actually... I picked this up last night while I was working.\nPhoenix:\n...A wallet? You say you found this last night?\nButz:\nYeah, it had a driver's license in it, so I figured I'd just return it myself.\nRon's Wallet added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nHang on... Let me see that for a minute. ... I know it. Dessie's picture is in here.\nButz:\nYeah, I guess he really digs his wife, huh? ... Hey, Nick... It's not what you're thinking at all!\nPhoenix:\nNo, I'm pretty sure it is. You haven't changed a bit.\nButz:\nAw, no way man! I mean, she's a married woman! That's just bad news!\nPhoenix:\n(He really IS here just to check out Ms. DeLite...)\nMaya:\nSo you said you found it at your job, right?\nButz:\nYeah!

About 30 minutes by car, I guess... Well, if you fly down the road, anyway.\nPhoenix:\nHmm.

If you truly are who you say, I'm sure you've heard of him. ...His name is \"Godot\".\nPhoenix:\nG-Godot...?\nDeMasque's identity\nAtmey:\nYou have taken a step down the path of foolishness.

But Ace Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth is currently traveling abroad.\nMaya:\nHuh...?\nAtmey:\nIn fact, it was Mr. Edgeworth who acknowledged Godot as the best in this country.\nPearl:\nAnd you agree with that?\nAtmey:\nMost certainly. In fact, you could call him the Luke Atmey of the Prosecutor's Office.\nMaya:\nWell, that's good to hear! The prosecution has a fighting chance tomorrow!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, is this \"Godot\" really that strong?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I seem to remember hearing about something like that...\nAtmey:\nNot surprising... Some people spend their entire lives idly waiting for his appearance.\nPresent\nAnything\nMaya:\nUmmm, Mr. Atmey...? Could you take a look at this?\nAtmey:\nOh please. You can drop the pretense already.\nMaya:\nHuh...?\nAtmey:\nYou and I are already fated to fight each other... And the only true weapon for warriors in a court of law is information! Surely you don't expect me to sharpen your sword for you!\nMaya:\n...Creep.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like we're done investigating for the day.)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... Sir Lawyer... The stage has been set and all the pieces are finally in place. All that remains now... is for the dance to begin!\nPhoenix:\n(A new prosecutor, an Ace Detective and a thief... This will be one tough trial.)\nTo be continued.\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)\nToo many errors during Magatama session\n...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...\nPhoenix:\n(Nnrgh!

Is something wrong...?\nMaya:\nNah. But did you see all the people here? It's crazy! Oh! So, check out the Mask\u2606DeMasque glossy I bought! (Changed from [Oh! Look at this! I bought this Mask\u2606DeMasque publicity photo!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou bought this... where? (Changed from [You bought that...? Where!?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nFrom the little tents in front of the courthouse. They have all sorts of things for sale!\nMaya:\nYou know I'm sucker for this kind of stuff!\nMask\u2606DeMasque Publicity Photo stuck into the Court Record.\nCome on! I'm guilty! Throw the book at meeee!\nPearl:\n...Who's screaming like that?\nRon:\n...Oh! Mr. Wright! You made it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I did. But it doesn't look like things are going to get any less ugly for you...\nRon:\nBecause I did it!! I'm the criminal! Me! Me! Meeeeeee!\nMaya:\nUngh... He's at it again.\nRon:\nI sent the calling card to Lordly Tailor! I admit iiiit!!\nPhoenix:\nBut... You don't have the Sacred Urn, right?\nRon:\nWell, that's true, but... That doesn't mean that I didn't commit the crime.\nPhoenix:\n(Normally, when I say \"Of course you didn't\" I'm being sarcastic, but you... Yikes!)\nRon:\nAnyway, I admit that I'm guilty... So make sure they give me a guilty verdict! Pleeeeease!?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOh, there you are Ronnie! Bonjour, sweetie!\nRon:\nOh! D-Dessie honey! B-Bonjour! ...Well, actually... I don't really know why I should be speaking French to you at a time like this\nDesir\u00e9e:\nLeave it all to me, Ronnie! I swear I'll protect you!\nRon:\nUmmm, errr... Aaah... Well, ahh... You see... Actually the thief is err, me\nDesir\u00e9e:\nCan I tell you something, Nicky boy? I can guarantee that my Ronnie is innocent! If he's declared guilty, I'll be ever so cross with you!\nPhoenix:\n(So why are you smiling when you say it?)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nWell, if you'll excuse me! I've got some errands I need to take care of! I'm counting on you, Nicky boy! Good luck!\nPhoenix:\n(To be honest, I really don't know whether Ron is Mask\u2606DeMasque or not. But there's only one thing I AM sure of. He doesn't have the Sacred Urn right now...)\nBailiff:\nMr. DeLite! It's time for you to enter the courtroom!\nPhoenix:\n(For the time being, I guess I'll have to trust Desir\u00e9e...)\nOctober 13, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 6\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Ron DeLite.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your honor.\n???:\n...\nJudge:\nWhat about the prosecution? Are you prepared to...\n???:\n...What a stupid question!\nJudge:\nWh-What did you say!\n???:\nFine. Let me ask you then, Your Honor. Are YOU ready? Are you ready to pass judgement?\nJudge:\nWh...! N-No, I... I'm not! I will pass judgement after I hear arguments from both sides.\n???:\nWell, if you're not ready yourself, you shouldn't expect others to be. That's a rule to live by.\nJudge:\n...Um, wh-who are you?\nGodot:\nI am Godot. Legendary prosecutor. I've never lost a case.\nMaya:\nAh! He's the one that Detective Atmey was talking about...\nJudge:\nYes, your reputation precedes you. What kind of cases have you dealt with so far?\nGodot:\nHa...! None.\nJudge:\nWhat did you say...?\nGodot:\nI've never prosecuted a case before.\nJudge:\nN-Never? But you said you've never lost before.\nGodot:\n...Exactly. I've never lost. I've never won before either.\nJudge:\nQuite arrogant for a beginner, aren't you?\nGodot:\nEven the mightiest of redwoods begin their lives as mere saplings.\nJudge:\nYes, but... A mask? In a court of law?\nGodot:\nHa...! Don't you know anything? No matter the man, we all wear masks... Either on our faces or ever our hearts.\nJudge:\n...!\nMaya:\nThis guy is the real deal alright, Nick...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does it seem like all prosecutors are the \"real deal\"...?)\nGodot:\nSo we finally meet... Mr. Phoenix Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Is he a friend of yours?\nPhoenix:\nNo. I don't have any friends that call me \"Trite\". (Just who is this masked man...?)\nGodot:\nI've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you.\nJudge:\nWell then, err, Prosecutor Gobo.\nGodot:\nIt's not \"Gobo\". It's Godot... Your Honor.\nJudge:\nIn any case, please give your opening statement.\nGodot:\nOpening statement? Those things are not fit for even dogs to consume. I have only one thing to say before we start. To you... Mr. Trite.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nGodot:\nAre you familiar with the saying, \"A chain is only as strong as its weakest link\"? I wonder... how much you can withstand before you and your case break in two...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nHmm... Well then, let's hear from the first witness!\nGumshoe:\nUm, my name is...\nGodot:\nNo one asked for your name, witness.\nGumshoe:\n...Urk.\nGodot:\nThe important thing is what you know... That's all. Start talking. ...We're listening.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir.\nJudge:\nAlright, witness. First, let's hear about... What you know about the thief that stole the urn.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Mask\u2606DeMasque's Crimes --\nGumshoe:\nMask\u2606DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.\nHe's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!\nThis was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.\nHis pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.\nThat's why we're sure it was Mask\u2606DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!\nJudge:\nHmm... So then the actual identity of this Mask\u2606DeMasque is... M-Mr. Godot! W-What are you--!? (Changed from [M-Mr. Godot! Y-You!] in the original release) W-We're in the middle of a trial here, Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\nBlacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than Hell itself... That is coffee. I'm sure you can grant me at least this much... Your Honor. Oh, please. Proceed.\nJudge:\n... Very well. It's only coffee, after all.\nPhoenix:\n(What!? You can't be letting him slide this early in the trial!)\nJudge:\nProceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? What are you going to do?\nPhoenix:\nAs long as they haven't brought up Mr. DeLite's identity... ...all we can do is show that it wasn't Mask\u2606DeMasque who stole the urn.\nCross Examination\n-- Mask\u2606DeMasque's Crimes --\nGumshoe:\nMask\u2606DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHave you been involved in the investigation from the beginning?\nGumshoe:\nYup! Nobody knows more about the thief than me, pal! It's true! I'm a... Zvarri...! \"Author on thieves\"!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nAn \"author\"...? He's written books about thieves?\nPhoenix:\nUm, I think he probably meant to say \"authority\".\nGumshoe:\nThe fact that this guy can slip through even my fingers shows how good he is, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(It's easy when those fingers happen to be \"butter fingers\"...)\nPress harder\nPhoenix:\nSo nobody knows more about the thief than you, huh...?\nGumshoe:\nYou got it, pal! Except maybe for the thief's mom, that is!\nPhoenix:\nBut isn't there someone who knows even more about him than the police?\nGumshoe:\nYou don't mean... \"Detective Zvarri\", do you?\nJudge:\nHmm... Who is this person? Zvarri? He sounds German...\nGumshoe:\nHis name is Luke Atmey, sir. I guess I shouldn't have made up such a silly name for him.\nPhoenix:\n(What the heck? I guess he's not all that famous after all...)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, it's true that he did manage to retrieve the last item the thief stole.\nJudge:\n...Oh, I see. It seems you're not the expert you claim to be.\nGumshoe:\n...Urk! I-It looks like the thief is playing with me, even now!\nLeads back to cross-examination\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(The real \"authority\" on the thief is the other detective. I don't need to ask this one any more questions...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nGumshoe:\nHe's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHave you seen all of these so-called \"calling cards\"?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I have. Except... The person in charge of the Treasure Exhibit never brought their card to the police... So I didn't see this one until after the crime occurred.\nMaya:\nThat's because Detective Atmey stopped Ms. Andrews from taking it to the police.\nJudge:\nWas the calling card that Lordly Tailor received authentic?\nGumshoe:\nWell, all the cards have one common, identifying feature. But we're not releasing that information to the general public...\nJudge:\nBut you're absolutely certain that this card is real?\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe can't say it out loud but I bet he's talking about Mask\u2606DeMasque's emblem...)\nGumshoe:\nThis was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHis fifth heist... And your fifth screw up, huh?\nGumshoe:\nObjection, pal! That ain't fair! Maybe you could say I screwed up four times! But this last time wasn't my fault! I didn't know about the calling card this time!\nPhoenix:\n(You of all people shouldn't be chuckling about this, Detective Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nI just want everyone here in the courtroom to know something! If you ever get a calling card from this guy, don't call some stupid private eye! Call your local police right away. Got me?\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like he's really got it in for Detective Atmey.\nGumshoe:\nHis pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nArt pieces? Like what, for example?\nGumshoe:\nWell, his first target was the famous \"Tear of Emanon\".\nJudge:\nWhat's that? Some kind of especially salty teardrop?\nGumshoe:\nN-No, sir. It's a blue diamond. A single, rare diamond. Next was the \"Crown of Bongora\"... You know, the thing you put on your head. After that was the \"Left Hand of Hades\" and then the \"Portrait of Mejeena\", sir. Detective Atmey retrieved the \"Portrait of Mejeena\" and returned it to the museum.\nPhoenix:\nAnd the target of his fifth and last robbery was the \"Sacred Urn\"... right?\nJudge:\nBut isn't it difficult for him to dispose of such famous art pieces...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we assume he must have some underworld connections.\nMaya:\nSomehow, Mr. DeLite doesn't look the type...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, he's a little too sunny to be hanging out in the underworld...)\nPresent Sacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"\nGumshoe:\nThat's why we're sure it was Mask\u2606DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean when you say, \"it fits his M. O. to a T\"?\nJudge:\nI was thinking of asking the same thing myself.\nGumshoe:\nUgh... I wish you would listen a little more closely, pal. First of all, there's the calling card. We're 100% certain it's authentic. Then there's the fact that he seemed to know all about the security system. And finally, his target was an art piece. These are all part of the thief's modus operandi.\nJudge:\nAnd so, since this robbery seems to fit all those conditions...?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right! It means that Mask\u2606DeMasque is behind it!\nPresent Sacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"\nMaya:\nNick! It definitely looks like it was Mask\u2606DeMasque who stole the urn!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's no real evidence either way as to whether Ron DeLite is Mask\u2606DeMasque.\nMaya:\nBut... But...\nPhoenix:\nAlso, the urn hasn't turned up yet, let alone in connection to Mr. DeLite himself.\nMaya:\nSo even though we know it was Mask\u2606DeMasque that did it...\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe for the time being, I should try to show it wasn't Mask\u2606DeMasque that did it!)\nPhoenix:\n...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\n...Just hearing the \"little\" in that question is making me nervous.\nPhoenix:\nYou said that he always \"goes after the most precious art pieces\", right?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal.\nPhoenix:\nBut there's one problem... That's not what he did in this case. The supposedly \"priceless\" urn doesn't exactly rise to the level of \"precious art\"!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! How can you say such a terrible thing!?\nPhoenix:\nNo! I meant from a financial point of view! I mean, it wouldn't fetch a good price.\nJudge:\nWell, Prosecutor Godot? What is the value of that urn?\nGodot:\nThe appraisers I spoke to said they couldn't attach a price to it. And I mean that in the worst sense.\nPhoenix:\nSo in other words... It was not the kind of item that Mask\u2606DeMasque would normally go after!\nGumshoe:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nHmm... If I understand you correctly, Mr. Wright... ...you're saying that the theft of the Sacred Urn was not the work of Mask\u2606DeMasque...!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes... That's what I'm saying. (Actually all I did was point out the contradiction. The argument made itself, but...)\nJudge:\nWell... First of all, we need to get this issue cleared up. Was this last robbery the work of Mask\u2606DeMasque or not? What do you have to say about this, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nThis coffee here... It's my own special blend. I call it Godot #107. I'm trying to decide whether to cut down on the acidity or the bitterness... That's the only thing I've got on my mind right now... ...Mr. Trite!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nGodot:\nIf you're really a man, you should clean up your own mess.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Sorry, but I didn't get what you mean.\nGodot:\nIf you're saying it wasn't Mask\u2606DeMasque that stole the urn... ...then it must be someone imitating Mask\u2606DeMasque's methods... A fake.\nJudge:\nA-A Fake\u2606DeMasque?\nMaya:\nFake\u2606DeMasque? That sounds so ridiculous. ...But I like it.\nGodot:\nNow, before I decide on my coffee, I believe some proof is in order, Mr. Trite. Proof that the person who appeared at Lordly Tailor that night was actually a fake.\nJudge:\nHmm... Though I don't approve of Mr. Godot's behavior, his point is valid. Mr. Wright. ...We're waiting.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I'm going to have to prove it... I need proof that the person at Lordly Tailor that night was in fact, Fake\u2606DeMasque!)\nPresent Security Camera Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The proof is right here.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nWhat is this evidence supposed to prove?\nGodot:\nHa...! Well, it proves someone here is a fake alright. ...It proves that this lawyer is a fake.\nPhoenix:\n(These prosecutors sure know how to twist the knife...)\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be impressed! Think it over again! When he stole the urn, his photo was taken, right? Who knows? Maybe there's something on there that shows he's a fake...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Is she talking about that photo we got from Atmey?)\nJudge:\nAre you ready yet, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"It looks like I'm going to have to prove it...\"\nPhoenix:\nThe proof is right here.\nJudge:\nThis looks like... a photo taken by a security camera.\nPhoenix:\nBut if you look closely... you'll notice something peculiar about it.\nGodot:\nHa...! Well then, why don't you go ahead and show us what it is. Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".\nPresent front of Mask\u2606DeMasque's neck\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"It's right here, of course!\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt's right here. ...I think.\nJudge:\nIs that what was so \"peculiar\"?\nGodot:\nHa...! The place that you're pointing to is all wrong.\nPhoenix:\nWh... What do you mean!\nGodot:\nThe only thing \"peculiar\" in this courtroom... is on top of your head.\nMaya:\nNick! Are you going to let him get away making fun of your hair!?\nPhoenix:\n(Yes... At least until I know he can't use his goggles to fry me or something...) W-Well anyway! There is a strange spot in this photo!\nGodot:\nHa...! Still haven't given up? So what is it then?\nLeads back to:\n\"Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".\"\nPhoenix:\nIt's right here, of course!\nJudge:\nYou mean... Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nI have here a piece of reference I would like the court to take a look at.\nMaya:\nIsn't that the publicity photo I bought this morning...?\nPhoenix:\nThe problem I have with the security camera photo is the broach on DeMasque's chest.\nJudge:\nA Breach? Here!? Bailiff! Get my steed! We need to retreat at once!\nPhoenix:\n...A broach, Your Honor. It's a sort of clasp for holding one's cape on.\nJudge:\nA clasp, eh... Ah! I see now!\nGumshoe:\nBut the Mask\u2606DeMasque in the security camera photo... Ahh!! He has no broach!!\nPhoenix:\nThat broach is the same as the emblem on DeMasque's calling card and serves as his symbol. But the thief that broke into Lordly Tailor wasn't wearing a broach... In other words, this \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\" is a fake!\nGumshoe:\n...! I-I've been fooled agaaaaaain!\nJudge:\nO-Order! It's true... Undeniably true... Detective Gumshoe! How... How could you have overlooked this!?\nGumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! I don't know how I...\nGodot:\nHey now... ...If you're gonna have a pity party, invite me, too!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot! You deserve some blame in this, too! How could you have overlooked such a large broach...?\nGodot:\nHa...! The broach you're talking about... Do you mean this?\nGumshoe:\nAh...!\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's...! Mask\u2606DeMasque's broach!\nJudge:\nWh-Where did you find it!?\nGodot:\nWell I've always had a good nose for evidence... I got it at the crime scene. It was hidden in the shadow of a big female Buddha statue.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Buddha statue\"...? He must mean the Ami Fey statue.)\nGumshoe:\nWh-Why didn't you tell me about that, sir!?\nGodot:\n...I always put evidence away in my pocket. ...After all, it's the safest place for crucial evidence.\nMaya:\nGrrr... This guy is one cool customer.\nGodot:\nIt's a little early to be shaken up, isn't it, little lady? ...That friend of yours left pretty little hickeys on there, too.\nJudge:\nH-Hickeys?\nGodot:\nFiguratively speaking, of course... I'm referring to Ron DeLite's fingerprints.\nGumshoe:\nWhaaa...?\nJudge:\nWhat!? The defendant's fingerprints are on the broach!? Order! Order in the court! Mr. Godot! Let's see that broach!\nGodot:\nI've grown attached to my metallic girlfriend here. ...Take good care of her.\nJudge:\nHmm... She-- I mean, it appears to have been torn off some clothing. There's a little bit of cloth left on the back.\nGodot:\nObviously there must have been a big struggle that night at the crime scene.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... Phoenix, we have a problem...)\nDeMasque's Broach added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nHa...! You mess with Godot... ...and you get burned.\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... He's been playing me like a violin...)\nGodot:\nWell Judge, I'm about ready to call my next witness.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? You're done with me? But I haven't proved anything yet.\nGodot:\nYou've proven your own incompetence. That's good enough.\nGumshoe:\n...That doesn't sound good at all.\nJudge:\nBailiff! Bring the next witness into the courtroom!\nPhoenix:\n(Finally time for the Ace Detective to make his appearance, huh...?)\nGodot:\nOne second is one drip of the coffee pot. Let's hurry it up.\nAtmey:\nSHHH! SILENCE!... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.\nJudge:\nWh-What's clear?\nAtmey:\n...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! What we have here is... A judge and a prosecutor. ...A coffee maniac, at that! ...Am I correct?\nJudge:\nW-Well, yes. That's right.\nGodot:\nHa...! Not bad. Not bad at all. You're the first person that's ever been able to penetrate my secret veil.\nAtmey:\nWell, Sir Prosecutor. Let me introduce myself. My name is Luke Atmey, Ace Detective and rising star illuminating the heavens.\nMaya:\nBoy, these two make a perfect pair...\nPhoenix:\nThey'd either be best friends or they'd tear each other's heads off.\nJudge:\nI've heard that on the night of the crime, you were all alone on security detail.\nAtmey:\n...You have heard correctly. My specially-made monocle is worth more than a hundred Detective Gumshoes. ...If Detective Gumshoe was worth anything, that is.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(Why was this guy all by himself anyway...? There must be some reason. I'm sure of it!)\nJudge:\nWell then, tell us what this special monocle of yours witnessed!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Witnessed --\nAtmey:\nIt was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.\nThat's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask\u2606DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!\nJust as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!\nDarkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.\nThirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!\nJudge:\nSo you didn't get a clear look at the criminal?\nAtmey:\nMy specially-made monocle never misses a thing. However! That is limited to things that fall within my own visual range! But of course, that's only natural.\nJudge:\n...I fall to see why the witness seems so proud of his performance that evening.\nAtmey:\nWell, Sir Old-Timer, let me explain. We are not speaking of any ordinary thief... ...but of the kings of thieves! The great Mask\u2606DeMasque, my arch-enemy! That is what my instincts and my years of experience tell me!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Proceed with the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Witnessed --\nAtmey:\nIt was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo that would be one o'clock on the morning of the 12th, correct?\nAtmey:\nThat's an impressive deduction, Sir Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nYou were on security duty that night. Where exactly were you at the time?\nAtmey:\nA penetrating question! I was in the basement warehouse, near the computer.\nPhoenix:\n(Near the computer, huh...)\nJudge:\nSo then you weren't trying to remain hidden, I take it?\nAtmey:\nUp to this point, I have tried to remain concealed while waiting for the thief...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, he said the same thing yesterday, too.)\nMaya:\nGumshoe also said that he never saw him at the crime scene...\nAtmey:\nPrecisely! That is precisely why I chose NOT to hide last night. I knew that by NOT concealing myself, I would be putting pressure on the thief.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like the thief was the one applying pressure... On your pidgeony head, that is.)\nAtmey:\nIn any case!\nAtmey:\nThat's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask\u2606DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n\"Dancingly descended\"...? From where exactly?\nAtmey:\nWell... From the entrance, I suppose. Where else?\nPhoenix:\n(So in actuality, he neither \"danced\" nor \"descended\"! ...Someone please save me.) Um... So how is it that you didn't notice the thief?\nAtmey:\nMy eyes were looking for the thief's shadow while my ears listened for his footfalls. But even so, the dastardly criminal managed to sneak up on me... It can only be due to his subtly camouflaged cape and soft-soled shoes.\nPhoenix:\n(... I hereby dub you \"Ace Dunce\".)\nAtmey:\nJust as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't see the criminal's face when that happened?\nAtmey:\n...Well, that's difficult part. How should I put it... I saw his mask... That's all that I can recall.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's not very solid as far as testimony goes.\nAtmey:\nHowever... Fortunately I had my third monocle, the security camera, at the ready. It captured his image perfectly... This should be sufficient, I believe?\nJudge:\nHmm, well, as long as this photo is authentic, I don't see a problem here. Well, Mr. Godot? Do you have a problem with the photo? Good. Then let's continue with the testimony.\nPresent DeMasque's Broach\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...Mr. Atmey.\"\nAtmey:\nDarkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAttacked and knocked unconscious? And you weren't able to do a thing? There's certainly some very impressive detective work.\nAtmey:\nHmph! Well, Sir Lawyer! Have you ever been suddenly struck on the head?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? W-Well.. Actually, yes. By a fire extinguisher.\nAtmey:\nAnd what happened?\nPhoenix:\n...I-I was knocked out.\nMaya:\nAnd you lost your memory, too!\nAtmey:\nYou see? You have no right to look down on me then, do you? The only reason I didn't lose my memory was because I have more brains to begin with.\nPhoenix:\n(He may have brains, but the wiring to the self-reflection part seems to be served...)\nAtmey:\nIn any case, that was how I was knocked senseless. And then...\nPresent DeMasque's Broach\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...Mr. Atmey.\"\nAtmey:\nThirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAbout this \"30 minutes\"...\nAtmey:\nMy silver cord was loosened and my soul fled to the Golden Halls of Elysium...\nMaya:\nAs usual, I have no idea what this guy is saying.\nPhoenix:\nI think he's saying that he was out cold.\nJudge:\nSo... What happened during these 30 minutes?\nAtmey:\nNo one can say, Your Honor... That span of time has truly vanished into the ether!\nPhoenix:\n(Just what is he going on about!?)\nMaya:\nThere's something suspicious about Detective Atmey... How could he not have noticed when the thief came in?\nPhoenix:\nAlso, he says he was knocked unconscious before he could fight back... But that can't be right. It contradicts the evidence.\nMaya:\nHuh? Which piece...?\nPhoenix:\n(The real question is... Why would he tell such an obvious lie?)\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Atmey. Could you take a look at this with that special monocle of yours?\nAtmey:\nAha! This belongs to the criminal mastermind, my arch-nemesis, Mask\u2606DeMasque! It is, in point of fact, Mask\u2606DeMasque's broach!\nPhoenix:\nIt was found on the floor of the basement warehouse. I wonder how that happened?\nAtmey:\nHa... Elementary, my dear lawyer. Obviously it wasn't glued on well enough.\nPhoenix:\nNot quite. It clearly shows signs of having been ripped off a piece of clothing.\nJudge:\nRipped off...? Aha!\nPhoenix:\n...We can only deduce that the thief struggled with someone that night! That's the only thing I can think of. And there's only one person that was in a position to have a struggle with the thief. The only person that was on security duty that night...You, Detective Atmey!\nAtmey:\n...Urk!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief that night! (Changed from [Detective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief last night!] in the original release) So, why did you lie in your testimony to the court?\nJudge:\nWitness! Giving false testimony is a serious crime!\nAtmey:\nErr, I... N-No! W-Wait just a moment, Sir Old-Timer!\nJudge:\nDon't talk to me like I'm living in a nursing home!\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee he he he... I just remembered, Your Honor. I was just confused because I've been dealing with so many cases lately.\nGodot:\nThe true measure of a man is in the amount of work he does. That's what I always say.\nMaya:\nNick, you can only handle one case at a time... Isn't that right?\nPhoenix:\nYou talk too much.\nJudge:\nWitness! So are you now saying that you and the thief fought?\nGodot:\nHold on. That's quite enough... Your Honor.\nJudge:\nE-Excuse me...?\nGodot:\nSave the big questions for the testimony. That's one of my rules.\nAtmey:\nIndeed! I understand! I, Luke Atmey, agree completely!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Fight With The Thief --\nAtmey:\nIndeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.\nHowever... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!\nUnfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.\nA true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.\nHis first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\nJudge:\nSo in the end, you did catch a glimpse of Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nAtmey:\nCorrect. It was during his third crime that he struck me from behind. It seems that my memory has become a tad jumbled, so to speak.\nJudge:\nHmmm... Well, that's certainly understandable. I, myself, always get confused about which testimony goes with which case.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-That can't be good...)\nCross Examination\n-- Fight With The Thief --\nAtmey:\nIndeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo why did you look away from the door anyway?\nAtmey:\nIn addition to the camera, I had prepared a variety of other sensors as well. The alarm on one of those had gone off, so I had to check the data. That's why I went to the computer! ...Elegantly, of course!\nPhoenix:\nSo you were momentarily vulnerable when you were working on the computer? (What should I do? Should I ask some more questions...?)\nThat's enough\nPhoenix:\n(Well, we know for sure that Atmey looked away from the door. I think I should ask about something else now...) Alright. So you looked away from the door. ...And then?\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAbout the sensor\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of sensors are you talking about?\nAtmey:\nThere are other places in the basement that someone could enter and exit from. There are air conditioner ducts, sewer pipes... And a cat door as well. I hooked up heat-detecting, infrared and ultra-violet sensors to each of them.\nPhoenix:\nThat's a lot of hardware... Was it all yours?\nAtmey:\nLordly Tailor Department Store was kind enough to provide the monitoring hardware. Naturally, the security camera that look the photo belongs to them as well.\nPhoenix:\n(In other words, he couldn't have rigged the equipment, huh...?)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... Has that cleared up any doubts you had about me, Sir Lawyer?\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAbout the computer\nPhoenix:\nSo did that computer belong to Lordly Tailor as well?\nAtmey:\nCorrect. Well, except for the program that manages the data. That was specially designed by me, Luke Atmey!\nPhoenix:\n(In that case, he could have easily manipulated the data.)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... What's wrong, Sir Lawyer?\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAtmey:\nHowever... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUmm... What does that mean? \"Discombobulated\"?\nJudge:\nHmm... Young people these days... They really irritate me. They allow perfectly good old words to die until everyone forgets what they mean.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but what exactly DOES it mean anyway?\nJudge:\n...Now I've forgotten. What was I saying?\nPhoenix:\n(Jeez. It's better than old people who forget what they were saying 5 seconds ago!)\nGodot:\n...Well, it looks like we've cleared that up. You can go on with your testimony.\nAtmey:\nUnfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by \"weapon from the side\"?\nAtmey:\nNaturally, that thief had no idea that I, Luke Atmey, was hiding in the area! He grabbed the sword from the statue that was standing by the door to the warehouse.\nPhoenix:\nSword...? You mean the sword that was all twisted like a tree branch?\nAtmey:\nCorrect. Fortunately for me, the blade was not sharp.\nPhoenix:\n(OK. so he IS talking about the Shichishito...)\nJudge:\nSo the thief armed himself with a sword. And what about yourself, witness?\nAtmey:\nA true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou had that much faith in your own fighting abilities?\nAtmey:\nBut of course. In college, I was the 2nd in-charge of the boxing club.\nJudge:\nI'm sorry if I fail to find that appropriately impressive.\nAtmey:\nHowever! My opponent in the ring this time was my arch-nemesis, Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\n(This guy is a real piece of work...)\nAtmey:\nHis first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell us a little more about what happened?\nAtmey:\nMy opponent was both powerful and vicious. You might say he was... \"powericious\".\nPhoenix:\n(\"P-Powericious\"?)\nAtmey:\nI assumed the \"Atmey Fighting Stance\", but a sudden flash of light blinded me! That of course was checkmate! My opponent had bested me.\nPhoenix:\n(What do I do now? Should I ask more about this...?)\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess it's true that Atmey was knocked senseless after all. I'd better ask him about something else instead...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\"You were blinded\"?\nPhoenix:\nSo what was this flash of light that blinded you?\nAtmey:\n...I was bathed in a golden light that seemed to come from the statue of the woman.\nPhoenix:\n(The statue of Ami Fey, I'm guessing...)\nMaya:\nWell that wasn't very much help at all...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\"Atmey Fighting Style\"?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is this \"Atmey Fighting Style\"?\nAtmey:\nI'm sorry but that's a trade secret... I really can't say any more. But, I suppose I can tell you if I absolutely must. The main thing is to put your back to the wall. That way no one can get behind you.\nPhoenix:\n(That's it...? That's the \"Atmey Fighting Style\"?)\nJudge:\nHmmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What about that testimony...?\nIt was a waste of time.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess it's true that Atmey was knocked senseless after all. I'd better ask him about something else instead...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nIt was very important.\nPhoenix:\nOf course it's important! We've learned a detective's SECRET technique, after all.\nJudge:\nYes, indeed... I'll remember to use it if I ever take a walk alone late at night.\nPhoenix:\n(Why the heck is he eye-balling me like that...? It's creeping me out...)\nJudge:\n...Now then, witness! We'll go ahead and add that secret information to your official testimony!\nChanges statement from \"His first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\" to \"I put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.\"\nAtmey:\nI put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Where is this \"third eye\" you're talking about?\nAtmey:\nOh... it's right between my right and left eye brows. ...It's quite invisible to the unenlightened. You may call it the forehead, if you like.\nPhoenix:\n(Why didn't you just say that in the first place!?)\nAtmey:\nSir Lawyer! It looks like the creases in your own forehead are getting deeper!\nMaya:\nSo Mr. Atmey got hit on the forehead then?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he says.\nMaya:\nHmm... I've got a funny feeling about that.\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, so do I.)\nPresent Shichishito\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards.\"\nMaya:\nWell what do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWell, there's one thing that I'm absolutely sure of now.\nMaya:\nYeah? What is it!?\nPhoenix:\nThe Luke Atmey guy... He's definitely hiding something!\nMaya:\nB-But why?\nPhoenix:\nI think I'm starting to figure out what really happened that night. (...And about the true nature of this \"detective\".)\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards.\nAtmey:\nWhat fun this is, Sir Lawyer! It is truly a pleasure to cross swords with you! And now, once again, you have thrown down the gauntlet at my armored feet...\nPhoenix:\nI believe this is what you said yesterday.\nAtmey:\nNo, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head from behind with this gruesome item here!\nJudge:\nFrom behind, huh?\nPhoenix:\nBut just now you testified that he struck you on the forehead... I hardly think you could forget where you were hit on the head!\nAtmey:\n...Urk! It seems... I-I've made another mistake.\nPhoenix:\n...Detective Atmey. That's not the only strange part of your testimony.\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean by that?\nPhoenix:\nFor example... The very fact that you hid the calling card from the police itself is strange! It's almost as if... You were afraid they were going to help with security!\nAtmey:\nU-Urk...! Geniuses such as myself have always been misunderstood! How sad...\nPhoenix:\nThat's wrong!\nGodot:\nGodot:\n...To err is human, to forgive divine. Humans aren't machines... They have souls, feelings. They live, they die, they love, they hate... And yes, they even make mistakes...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHey, hold on! It-It's not as pretty as that!\nGodot:\nReally? What is it like then!?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nAlways chase a riddle down to the end. That's one of my rules.\nPhoenix:\n(This is it... This might just be my chance to turn things around!)\nJudge:\n...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?\nPhoenix:\nVery well, Your Honor. The defense asserts that...\nMr. Atmey is no Ace Detective!\nPhoenix:\nThe truth is... this witness is no Ace Detective at all!\nAtmey:\n...So then what exactly are you saying that I am?\nPhoenix:\nUh, umm... Well, an average detective...?\nJudge:\nI hardly see the relevance of that.\nMaya:\nWh-What are you doing, Nick!? Weren't you going to go on the attack?\nPhoenix:\nI was planning on it, but it looks I'm the one who got attacked instead.\nJudge:\nThink harder next time!\nLeads back to:\n\"...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?\"\nthis Mr. Atmey is a fake!\nPhoenix:\nThis witness isn't Luke Atmey... He's a fake!\nAtmey:\n...So now it's not just Mask\u2606DeMasque. You're saying I'm a fake, too?\nPhoenix:\nAn Ace Detective could never be as forgetful as this guy!\nGodot:\nImposters like you are often suspicious of others as well.\nJudge:\nReally, this is too much. Next you'll be calling me a fake, too!\nLeads back to:\n\"...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?\"\nMr. Atmey is Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nLeads to:\n\"The answer is simple! It's all clear to me now!\"\nPhoenix:\nThe answer is simple! It's all clear to me now! Detective Luke Atmey's true identity is actually... Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nAtmey:\nYeeeeaaargggh!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nThere are too many unnatural parts to Mr. Atmey's story. He says he was \"hiding\" at the crime scenes, which is why no one ever saw him there. And then, in his last case, he manages to outperform Detective Gumshoe and... ...the entire police force to \"miraculously\" retrieve the stolen treasure.\nAtmey:\nTh-That's because... I analyzed the crime scene data and made an exquisitely elegant deduction. I picked up clues that the police overlooked in order to arrive at a...\nPhoenix:\nOh, please! The explanation is far simpler than that, \"Detective Atmey\"! The truth is that you are, in fact, Mask\u2606DeMasque.\nAtmey:\nGurk...!\nJudge:\nB-But Mr. Wright! Th-This photo! It clearly shows Mask\u2606DeMasque! This security camera belongs to Lordly Tailor Department Store! He shouldn't have been able to manipulate it...\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't need to manipulate it! He gained access to the warehouse under the pretense of providing \"security\"... Then he simply dressed as the \"thief\" and stole the urn.\nJudge:\nSo... the Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief! Is this true, witness!?\nAtmey:\n... Aha... Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee! DeMasque's M. O. is pure genius! And so am I, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective!! You're very clever to have come to such a conclusion! I am impressed, Sir Lawyer!\nJudge:\nWh-Whaaaaat!? Witness! You... You're admitting it!?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Now's your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYes! Time to put the last nail in this guy's coffin! Detective Atmey! When you assumed the thief's identity--\nGodot:\nGodot:\nGodot Blend #102... ...My personal favorite.\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\n\"The Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief!\" I smell a best-selling novel! There's only one problem... It simply isn't true.\nJudge:\nB-But Mr. Godot! Mr. Wright has made some very strong points and I...\nGodot:\nI will admit my opponent has woven a compelling narrative out of whole cloth. But it is, in fact, nothing more than a patchwork quilt. Mr. Trite... If this detective really is the thief, then show us the proof of your claim. But it had better be as hot... and as perfect as the coffee dripping down your face!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright!? Don't just stand there! This court would like to see this decisive proof you have! Quickly!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Oh! Y-Yes, of course! (Wh-What's the big rush...?)\nMaya:\nAre you alright, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Atmey looks pretty rattled right now... I'd like to finish this right now if I can. But can I really do it?) The decisive evidence that proves Mr. Luke Atmey is in fact Mask\u2606DeMasque...\nis right here!\nPhoenix:\nAs usual, the defense comes prepared, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nVery well then... Let's see what you've got. Please present proof that Mask\u2606DeMasque is actually Mr. Luke Atmey!\nPresent anything\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere's your proof!\nJudge:\nWhat do you think, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nIt looks to me like Mr. Trite is still a mite sleepy. Perhaps he'd like a big mug of my special Godot blend? Well?\nPhoenix:\nN-No thanks, I'm fine! Really! (What do I do now? Another mistake like that and I'm through! Without some decisive evidence, I could be risking everything...)\nI've got all I need.\nLeads back to:\n\"As usual, the defense comes prepared, Your Honor!\"\nI don't have a thing.\nLeads to:\n\"Proof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.\"\nhas yet to be found!\nLeads to:\n\"Proof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.\"\nPhoenix:\nProof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.\nGodot:\nHa...! Just what I thought. A man has to told his head up high no matter how bad things get, after all.\nPhoenix:\nUuugh...\nJudge:\nI see... I thought perhaps you had some evidence to back up your assertion...\nPhoenix:\n(This is no good! I've got to stay on the attack! I'll never get another chance to prove that this guy is the thief!)\nMaya:\nDon't give up, Nick! Think harder and try again!\nPhoenix:\nIt's no good... I'm just not ready yet...\nMaya:\nB-But... Are you going to just give up and let us lose this?\nAtmey:\nSo, you've come to your senses, have you, Sir Lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nI... Unnngh... (Argh! I can't think of a counter-attack at all...)\nJudge:\nIt seems the cloud of suspicion surrounding this witness has lifted. Mr. Godot. If you have anything further to add, then--\n???:\nJudge:\nWh... Wh-Who... ...Who are you?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nThat doesn't really matter right now, does it?\nPhoenix:\nMs. DeLite! What are you doing here?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nNicky boy! The thing you've been looking for... I think I found it!\nJudge:\nYou mean... that bag!?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nNo, not the bag! What's in the bag! ...Well?\nJudge:\nTh-That's...\nMaya:\nThe Sacred Urn!! Nick! It's the urn!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! ...You! Madame...! That urn... Where did you find it!?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYou'll never believe it... It was in the office of Mr. Fancy Pants Ace Detective! ...Luke Atmey!\nRon:\nOh, Dessie! You're the best!\nSacred Urn updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nWell? How do you explain that one, Mr. Atmey!?\nAtmey:\n...\nPhoenix:\nEven you are going to have a hard time weaseling out of this one!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nHa...! Pathetic...\nJudge:\nMr. Godot...? Do you have something you wish to say?\nGodot:\nYes, Your Honor... It simply amazes me how quickly times change... In the old days, a man was to be taken at his word. It's truly sad...\nJudge:\nYou're still denying that Mr. Atmey was involved!?\nGodot:\nBefore casting aspersions at Detective Atmey, consider the young lady here. Your name is Desir\u00e9e... Desir\u00e9e DeLite. Is that correct?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nY-Yes! What about it?\nGodot:\nHa...! How charming... The lengths that a woman is willing to go to save her husband is truly inspiring.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nWh-What are you insinuating!?\nGodot:\nAs the wife of the criminal, you could have \"discovered\" that stolen urn anywhere. Including the office of the good detective here. So you found the urn. What does that prove? It certainly doesn't prove where the urn was before you \"found\" it.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nWhat...? I just brought it here from the detective's office!\nGodot:\nPlease Madame... This town is already filled to the brim with lies. Any more could only compound the tragedy we have been witness to.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYou're wrong! I would never...! I would never do such a thing!\nPhoenix:\nMs. DeLite...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nPlease, Nicky boy! You've got to help me talk some sense into these people!\nPhoenix:\n(There must be some way! I've got to prove that urn was actually in the Atmey Detective Agency...)\nTestify about what I saw\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nWhat's wrong? Isn't it your job to come up with something to say...?\nMaya:\nNick! Come on! It should be easy to prove! After all, we checked out that bag, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. I remember doing that. Whatever was in there, it was hard and round... And smooth, too.\nMaya:\nYes! It must have been the urn! It must have!\nPhoenix:\nBut... I never actually saw it with my own eyes.\nMaya:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nAtmey walked in just when I was about to have a look at it... So even if it was the urn in there, I can't testify that it was.\nMaya:\nAck! You're right!!\nGodot:\nHa...! It looks like I was wrong about you, Mr. Trite. In this town overflowing with lies, there's still a single flickering candle of truth.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nNicky boy...!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it's true that I never actually saw the urn... But maybe I can still testify about it from another angle!)\nJudge:\nWhat about it, Mr. Wright? Have you given up yet...?\nLeads back to:\n\"There must be some way!\"\nShow fingerprints on the urn\nPhoenix:\nI can prove where the urn was... ...by the fingerprints on it!\nJudge:\nFingerprints, eh...\nAtmey:\nOh come now! Now you're really making me laugh, Sir Lawyer! Fingerprints indeed!\nPhoenix:\n...\nAtmey:\nMay I go on? Good. Now it would be perfectly understandable if my fingerprints were on the urn. After all, it was I who was guarding the urn in the first place! In any case, I am always in the habit of wearing gloves as you can see. So unfortunately, my fingerprints wouldn't be evidence of anything.\nJudge:\nWhat about it, Mr. Wright? This witness's fingerprints would mean nothing anyway.\nMaya:\nN-Nick, what are you going to do now?\nPhoenix:\n(I've come too far to turn back now! Atmey must have brought the urn back to his office yesterday... And there, I'm sure someone must have left their fingerprints on it...!) The defense proposes that the fingerprints of this person should be on the urn!\nPresent Phoenix Wright profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"So what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nGodot:\nLet me give you an important piece of advice. The one who keeps a cool head all the way until the game's end is the winner.\nJudge:\nLet me give you an even more important piece of advice, Mr. Wright... You are not going to win this game with that answer.\nMaya:\nWow... Even the judge is making cool, snappy remarks now...\nPhoenix:\n(D-Does that mean I was wrong again? Hmm... The urn was put in that bag and carried to the detective's office yesterday. That means the person I should be fingering is... the person who left their prints on the urn yesterday at the Atmey Detective Agency!)\nMaya:\nDo you really think there's someone that could fit the bill?\nName another person\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? What have you decided?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Please give me just one more chance!\nLeads back to:\n\"The defense proposes that the fingerprints of this person should be on the urn!\"\nThink it over again\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? What have you decided to do?\nPhoenix:\nForgive me, Your Honor. I've decided to think the whole thing over again.\nLeads back to:\n\"There must be some way!\"\nI can't prove anything yet\nPhoenix:\nI can't prove anything yet.\nMaya:\nBut Nick!\nJudge:\nVery well... It looks like that's all then.\nGodot:\nExactly... And this urn is all the proof I need to make my case...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGodot:\nYou still don't get it, huh? Listen closely, Mr. Trite. This is the urn that Mask\u2606DeMasque stole, right? Now the wife of the accused comes strolling in here with the very same urn, correct? Now, who would you think is the thief?\nPhoenix:\nAh...!\nDesir\u00e9e:\nNo! That's wrong! That's not why I've got it...\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Y-You can't let him do this...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, this isn't good... There has to be another way around this...) Your Honor! Please let me think it over one more time!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. It's high time that you learn your lesson. The courtroom is no place for poorly thought-out or rash declarations!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to be careful... He won't be so nice next time...)\nLeads back to:\n\"There must be some way!\"\nAtmey:\nSo what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Atmey... Do you recall the events of yesterday?\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! Open it up!\nPhoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property!\nMaya:\nDon't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation! Well? What's in there?\nPhoenix:\nH-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...)\nAtmey:\n...Well, hello there!!\nPhoenix:\nIt's true that I didn't get a chance to look in the bag at that time. But! I did touch what was inside.\nAtmey:\nWh-What!? Y-You touched it...?\nPhoenix:\nAnd I remember it very well. It was \"smooth and hard\".\nAtmey:\nW-Well, err... Th-That was just...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I'd like the court to examine the fingerprints on that urn. If my fingerprints are on there... Then it proves that the urn was in Detective Atmey's office!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nWell, even if your fingerprints are on the urn... ...it still doesn't prove when they were put there, does it?\nPhoenix:\nOf course it does.\nGodot:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's not what I say, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said. (Changed from [Not what I said, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said.] in the original release)\nAndrews:\nI polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it looks more valuable!\nPhoenix:\nIf she polished it that much, she must have removed any and all fingerprints on it. And the only chance I had to get my fingerprints on it after that was... Yesterday! At the Atmey Detective Agency!\nGodot:\nHa...! This blend... Godot Blend #107... I've decided... It's a little too bitter after all!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I accept the defense's request! Bailiff! Take this urn and...\nAtmey:\nWait! Wait a moment, Your Honor! ...There's no need for that.\nJudge:\nN-No need you say...?\nAtmey:\nPrecisely... I already know Mr. Wright's fingerprints are on the urn...\nJudge:\nWh-What are you saying!\nPhoenix:\n(Yes! I've finally broken him down!)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...\nMaya:\nThis guy is nuttier than a fruitcake...\nAtmey:\nYou see! It was me all along! I am the one and only Mask\u2606DeMasque! Ha ha! I hope you all enjoyed my little performance! Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot... What's Mr. Atmey's condition?\nGodot:\nHe's still in the lobby, laughing insanely, Your Honor. I wish I could enjoy the joke as much as he seems to be.\nJudge:\nWell, it looks like the matter has been settled. I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of \"thief\"!\nMaya:\nNick, you were right after all!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah! I guess Mr. DeLite really wasn't the thief!)\nJudge:\nThe court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...\n???:\nRon:\nYou're wrong! Wrong I tell you! Err, umm, I mean... Not exactly wrong so much, but actually not right is what I really trying to say\nPhoenix:\n(Oh no... He's not... This can't be happening...)\nRon:\nThe thief... The sneaky, odious thief who's been stealing all the treasures... It's me! I'm him! I'm the one you want! I'm the thief I tell you! So do it...! Pronounce me guilty! Pleeeease!!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\n...\n............\nJudge:\nI don't know what kind of a kangaroo court you all think this is, but...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe true identity of the thief has already been proven! Please hurry and pass judg--\nRon:\nWhat are you talking about!? I already confessed! I'm the thief I tell you!\nJudge:\n...Mr. Godot! Don't just stand there drinking coffee!\nGodot:\nHa...! Hey there, Mr. Thief...\nRon:\nY-Yes! Yes, sir!?\nGodot:\nIf you're really a man, then clean up your own mess.\nRon:\nI-I'm sorry... I'm afraid I just don't have any idea what do you mean.\nGodot:\nIf you are Mask\u2606DeMasque... then prove it. That's what it means.\nRon:\nY-Yes, sir! I'll be happy to!\nMaya:\nHe says he'll be happy to, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nIt's kinda cute... He's 100% committed to his fantasy.\nGodot:\nGood boy! Just remember one thing. A boy only gets one chance in his life to become a man!\nRon:\nI-I know that! I-I won't fail! I swear!\nGodot:\nOK, then... Talk! ...We're all listening.\nJudge:\nOh well... Let's all have a listen to this \"confession\"...\nWitness Testimony\n-- Mask\u2606DeMasque's Identity --\nRon:\nThe truth is, I've been Mask\u2606DeMasque all along!\nI mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask\u2606DeMasque, can you?\nI don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!\nI donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!\nLook! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!\nAs for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't like the direction this trial has taken...\nPhoenix:\n(But this is how every trial goes... At least with me, anyway...)\nGodot:\nHa...! You're doing great!\nRon:\nHee hee hee... Stop it, Mr. Godot... You're embarrassing me.\nGodot:\nLike I said, you're only going to get one chance to testify, alright? But if you make it through this with flying colors, I'll keep my promise, too. I'll make sure you stay locked up in prison as the one and only true Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nRon:\nThanks so much, Mr. Godot! I... I'll do my best!\nJudge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. I'm afraid it's time for the cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*\nCross Examination\n-- Mask\u2606DeMasque's Identity --\nRon:\nThe truth is, I've been Mask\u2606DeMasque all along!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou may think you're real Mask\u2606DeMasque... but your wife thinks you're delusional.\nRon:\nI haven't told Dessie yet... About my true identity, I mean... Believe me, I've got my reasons.\nPhoenix:\n(With the way your room is decked out, how could she NOT know about it...?)\nJudge:\nHmm... Even thieves have complicated family situations, I suppose.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? It sounds like we're about to get sidetracked... again.)\nPress harder\nPhoenix:\nSo why are you withholding the truth from your wife?\nRon:\nWell... first of all, I don't think she'd believe me anyway... And second... If there's one thing that Dessie absolutely detests... ...it's criminals.\nJudge:\nIf that's the case, then why did you ever start thieving to begin with?\nRon:\nWell, Dessie is crazy about shopping. She's a real shopaholic... But she's the love of my life, Your Honor. I guess you could say I'm a \"Dessie-aholic\"...\nJudge:\nHmm... So you do have a complicated family situation after all.\nPhoenix:\n...Alright, that's enough. Please continue with your testimony. I beg of you.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(There's no point in digging through any more of their dirty laundry...) Well, why don't you continue with your testimony for now.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nRon:\nI mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask\u2606DeMasque, can you?\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I thought you were going to be the one to show US the proof. You know, that you're the real Mask\u2606DeMasque and not just some kind of obsessed fanboy.\nRon:\nHey now, that's not fair. Why do I have to do all the hard work anywaaaaay!?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe because you're the one making the outrageous claim... for a change.)\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You know that Mr. DeLite couldn't have committed the crime! You're the one with the fancy law degree! It's time to put it to work already!\nPhoenix:\nI need some kind of proof that Ron couldn't possibly be Mask\u2606DeMasque...\nMaya:\nWell, I guess if you had that kind of proof, we wouldn't still be here, would we...?\nPhoenix:\n(For the time being, maybe I need to shift strategy... I should try to show that Mr. DeLite couldn't have stolen the urn.)\nRon:\nAnyway, I...\nPresent Ron's Wallet or Key Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\"\nRon:\nI don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou've got no alibi...?\nJudge:\nI've been a judge for a long time... And this is the first time I've ever heard a defendant brag about having no alibi.\nRon:\nBut I tell you I was in Lordly Tailor that night! ...Errr, no. That's too vague, even for me. To be more precise, I was down in the basement warehouse.\nPhoenix:\n(Hold on...)\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was Ron DeLite when the crime happened anyway...? If we can prove he had an alibi after all, this case will be a piece of cake.\nMaya:\nW-Well, you're right, but...\nGodot:\nHa...! You think you can prove that? Wake up and smell the coffee!\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, I think maybe I can...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, do you have any evidence that shows the defendant has an alibi?\nNo, I have no evidence.\nPhoenix:\nOf course not! Don't be ridiculous!\nJudge:\nI-I'm sorry! ...Say! What am I apologizing for!? You! Witness! Hurry up with your testimony already!\nRon:\nI-I'm sorry! ...Why is it that I'm always the one that has to apologize to everyone in the end.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nYes, I have evidence.\nPhoenix:\nI have the evidence! Or do you think I'm still some sort of third-rate rookie!?\nJudge:\nOh...! I-I've never seen you this angry before!\nGodot:\n...I'm not surprised. Anger is the last refuge of the pathetic.\nPhoenix:\n(I thought I was more confident than angry...)\nJudge:\nWell then, let's see this evidence already. Show to this court evidence that proves where your client was on the night of the crime!\nPresent Ron's Wallet or Key Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere's the evidence!\nGodot:\nHa...! It looks like I was right. ...Mr. Trite. The more pathetic a man is, the more likely he is to start pointing fingers!\nPhoenix:\nFor some reason, the good Prosecutor really wants to prove that I'm \"pathetic\"...\nJudge:\nThat's because you are pathetic! And so is your \"evidence\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. I guess I was wrong... Again.)\nRon:\nAha! I told you I didn't have an alibi!\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPresent Ron's Wallet or Key Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\"\nRon:\nI donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n\"Dancingly descended\"...? From where exactly?\nRon:\nWell... From the entrance, I suppose. Where else?\nPhoenix:\n(So in actuality, he neither \"danced\" nor \"descended\"! ...Someone save me. Again.)\nMaya:\nI guess he thinks \"descended\" sounds more heroic or thief-like or something.\nRon:\nA-Anyway! I was there at the crime scene! Just like I said!\nRon:\nLook! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis is the photo that was taken by the security camera at the crime scene...\nJudge:\nNo doubt about it. That's Mask\u2606DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\nYes, but don't forget there's something important missing. The real Mask\u2606DeMasque has a big broach on his chest!\nRon:\nAs for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't notice it when your broach was torn off?\nRon:\nHuh!? W-Well... I'm always a little nervous when I'm working.\nPhoenix:\n(There's a bit of clothing left on the back side of the broach. I don't think it could have been torn off that easily...)\nMaya:\nYes, but... I don't see what that has to do with anything. Right now we're trying to prove that Mr. DeLite isn't the thief, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I guess so. (Let me hear that testimony one more time.)\nMaya:\nWhy does Mr. DeLite want to be Mask\u2606DeMasque so badly anyway? It's kinda disturbing. He doesn't seem like your typical attention whore to me. Unlike, say... you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nI am nothing of the sort, thank you very much. (But I gotta admit it is kinda scary the way Ron acts...)\nMaya:\nAnyway... Time to poke some holes in that testimony of his!\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\nRon:\nAh! Y-Yes. It-It does. I-I had lost it somewhere!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! When you find a wallet, you should report it to the police right away!\nPhoenix:\nAh! No! You don't understand. This is an important piece of evidence.\nJudge:\n\"Evidence\"...?\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... When did you first notice that you'd lost your wallet?\nRon:\nErr, let's see... I think it was on the night of the crime... But I know I still had it when Dessie and I went out for dinner.\nPhoenix:\nThis wallet was found at approximately 1:00 AM at KB Security headquarters.\nJudge:\nWhat...!? Surely you're not serious!?\nPhoenix:\nYes... I am serious. This proves that Mr. DeLite was, in fact, at KB Security that night!\nRon:\nNoooooo!\nPhoenix:\nSo if the defendant was at KB Security at 1 o'clock in the morning... ...then that proves that he has a watertight alibi!\nRon:\nNoooooo!\nPhoenix:\nFurthermore, considering the distance between Lordly Tailor and KB Security... ...it would have taken 30 minutes to get there by car! (According to Larry anyway...)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot!? Do you have anything to say? And stop drinking that coffee!\nGodot:\n...Come on, Mr. Thief. Don't let this guy beat you! Tell him why he's wrong!\nRon:\nYou're the only one who calls me \"thief\", Mr. Godot... ...Alright, I'll try! I-I'll do it! I will!\nMaya:\n...He's really got Mr. DeLite all worked up...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he's like a kid at his first day of school...\nRon:\nLook, it's just ridiculous! Why would I have dropped my wallet at KB Security!? Someone must have planted it there to make it LOOK like I was there and not at the heist.\nMaya:\n\"Planted it there\"? He's really reaching now...\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite. You probably dropped your wallet when you took it out to use this, didn't you? The key card to KB Security's CEO's office.\nRon:\nNoooo!\nGodot:\nHa...! That was a pretty good try, Mr. Trite... Unfortunately, you've overlooked one small thing.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What...?\nGodot:\n\"Motive\" of course! Why would this thief go to KB Security in the middle of the night anyway!?\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright? It looks like you need some more evidence after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr! This stupid kid...!)\nJudge:\nNow then. Let's see your evidence. The evidence that shows why Mr. DeLite went to KB Security at 1 AM that night!\nPresent Blackmail Letter\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite... I believe you've seen this before, correct?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere is your evidence!\nRon:\n...What is this supposed to mean, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Well, um... Don't you know?\nRon:\nMr. Wright... If you're a real man, you should clean up your own mess.\nPhoenix:\nDoh...! (For some reason, it bothers me more when HE says it!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then. Let's see your evidence.\"\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... I believe you've seen this before, correct?\nRon:\nAh...! Th-That's...!\nJudge:\nWhat is it?\nPhoenix:\nA blackmail letter. That's what it looks like from the contents.\nGodot:\nB-Blackmail...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, basically it says, \"bring $50,000 dollars\". [sic]\nJudge:\nHmm... That certainly sounds like blackmail alright...\nPhoenix:\nAt the time of the theft, Mr. DeLite was dealing with the blackmailer himself... ...in KB Security's CEO office, a full half an hour away from the scene of the crime!\nGodot:\n...Ungh... Urk... No No No No No NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! OOOOORDER!! So when the theft of the urn occurred, the defendant was at KB Security... It looks like a perfect case for the defense!\nGodot:\nGodot:\n...You may see it as a perfect case, Judge, but to me... Well, let's just say that my Godot Blend #107 impresses me a lot more.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you trying to say?\nGodot:\nYou say the thief was being blackmailed by the CEO of a security company... But... Did you actually investigate this CEO at all?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Well, umm... No... I guess not.\nGodot:\nAccusing a man of blackmail with no proof? I'm not sure what I think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(\"Not sure what I think of that\"...? At least I know what I think of you...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Good point. I'm not sure what I think of it myself... You claim that the defendant entered the CEO's office... ...but you will need at least one witness to corroborate your claim, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nNick! I think we're going to have to track down the CEO guy...\nPhoenix:\nNo, we don't have to track down the CEO at all.\nGodot:\nWhat do you mean by that, Mr. Trite?\nPhoenix:\nThere is someone else who can testify. This is the person who can testify that the key card was used at 1 AM that night!\nPresent Larry Butz profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Wh-Who is this useless-looking young man?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nGodot:\nHa...! That's the first time one of your jokes actually made me truly laugh.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm, I haven't actually made any jokes... Not intentionally anyway...)\nJudge:\nWell, perhaps you find it funny, but I fail to see any humor in it!\nPhoenix:\n(The problem is the key card that was in Ron's wallet... Somehow I need to prove that the card was used at 1 o'clock in the morning.)\nLeads back to:\n\"There is someone else who can testify.\"\nJudge:\nWh-Who is this useless-looking young man?\nPhoenix:\nYou don't remember him, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nHmmmm... Not exactly... But just looking at his picture makes the bile start to rise in my throat.\nMaya:\nIt looks like he doesn't remember the case from 2 years ago...\nPhoenix:\nHe probably blocked out that memory on purpose. Anyway, this man was working as a guard at KB Security that night.\nGodot:\nOh...?\nPhoenix:\nThe question at hand is this key card.\nButz:\nYup. That's the key card they use at the building I work in. According to the serial number, this one is for the CEO's office. You need it to get into that room, and every time you use that card, it leaves a record.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nAs you can see, there's no need to investigate the CEO of KB Security! We should be able to discover the truth simply by analyzing this key card's data!\nGodot:\nBwaaaah...!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nThe name of the CEO of KB Security is Kane Bullard. I was unable to contact him directly, but... I got the key card data. ...Here.\nJudge:\nS-So what does it show!?\nGodot:\nEach key card has its own serial number and they leave detailed records of their use. According to this data... this card was used at 1 AM on the morning of the crime.\nKey Card updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nBut that means... it can't be Mr. DeLite dressed as Mask\u2606DeMasque in this photo!\nGodot:\nHa...! It looks like you're right. Two minutes isn't even enough time to brew a good cup o' Joe...\nPhoenix:\nSo... So then...!\nGodot:\nRon DeLite was clearly in the office of KB Security's CEO at the time of the crime. ...The prosecutor's office is ready to admit that fact. Therefore, it's impossible for the defendant to be Mask\u2606DeMasque.\nMaya:\nGood job! You did it, Nick!\nJudge:\n...That's enough! I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of \"thief\"! ...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI'm ready to pass judgement... But before I do that, do you have any further objections?\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor!\nGodot:\nHrpmh...!\nRon:\nUnnnggh...\nJudge:\n...Very well. The court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...\nNot Guilty\nJudge:\nCourt is now adjourned!

I'm a little bit ashamed of myself.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nNicky boy!\nPhoenix:\nOh! Ms. DeLite...!\nDesir\u00e9e:\nI knew you could do it! I believed in you all along, Nicky boy! ...I don't know how I can ever repay you.\nPhoenix:\nAww... Shucks... Thanks, Ms. DeLite. (I just know I'm blushing...)\nPearl:\nCongratulations, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nOh! P-Pearls...! (I've got a bad feeling about this...)\nPearl:\n*gasp!* Wh-Who is this woman!\nPhoenix:\nOh, she... She's nobody... She's just ahh...\nPearl:\nYou're blushing! How dare you do this in front of Mystic Maya! You should be ashamed of yourself!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeowch! She slapped me...)\nMaya:\nUmm, Pearly... This woman is Ms. Desir\u00e9e DeLite. She's our client's wife.\nPearl:\n*gasp!* Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes!?\nPearl:\nYou're even worse than I thought! Going behind the back of your own client...!\nPhoenix:\nN-N-No! You've got it all wrong!\nPearl:\nI'll never forgive you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww... A double slap...)\nMaya:\nWell, anyway, All's well that ends well, right? We got the Sacred Urn back and the thief has been caught!\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYou're so right! And it's all thanks to Nicky boy here!\nMaya:\nBut actually it was you, Ms. DeLite, that brought us our urn back! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOh, please... You're embarrassing me!\nPhoenix:\n(If we won the case... ...then why does this guy still look so glum...?)\nRon:\nUgggh... But I am the thief... Actually, what's the point now\nDesir\u00e9e:\n...What is it, honey? I did my best for you, Ronnie!\nRon:\nI-I know that and I appreciate it, Dessie... But the thing is...\nGodot:\nCome on... Give the kid some time. He's just got a little touch of the blues. You know about feeling blue, right, amigo?\nPhoenix:\nM-Mr. Godot! What are you doing here!?\nGodot:\nOh come on! I just came here to say thanks to my newest buddy... ...You, Mr. Trite.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe you should learn my name before you call me \"buddy\"...)\nGodot:\nWell, playtime is over.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nGodot:\nEarly this morning... the body of Kane Bullard was discovered.\nMaya:\nKane Bullard...? Where have I heard that name before?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nIsn't that... the name of the CEO of KB Security?\nMaya:\nWait. B-Body...!? (Changed from [B-Body...?] in the original release)\nGodot:\nThe estimated time of death was 1 AM on October 12th.\nPhoenix:\n1 AM on October 12th...? Y-You don't mean!?\nGodot:\n...That's right, amigo. At the same time that a cheap little urn was being stolen... ...the CEO of KB Security was being murdered.\nPhoenix:\nS-So then... What are you doing here?\nGodot:\nOh come on. You've figured it out already, haven't you amigo? Or... Have you already forgotten about that piece of info I helped you out with today?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Helped me out\"? What!?)\nGodot:\nOn October 12th, at 1 o'clock in the morning... Ron DeLite was in the CEO's office... ...The scene of the murder. After getting that blackmail letter, he must have been imbrued with utter rage.\nMaya:\nWh-What are you saying!? Imbrued with rage...?\nGodot:\nCome on! Don't tell me you didn't know! (Changed from [Come on! Don't tell me you didn't know it!] in the original release) Ron DeLite was once an employee of KB Security... He was a professional security guard.\nPhoenix:\n(An employee of KB Security!?)\nGodot:\nIt looks like the alibi that saved him from being convicted as a thief... ...is going to be the noose that gets him hanged. Kind of an \"anti-alibi\".\nMaya:\nNo way...\nGodot:\nHe can't be the thief because he was at the murder scene when the murder occurred!\nDesir\u00e9e:\nN-No! Th-That's a lie! It can't be true!\nRon:\nOh! Ohhhh! B-But I... I am a thief I tell you!\nGodot:\nRon DeLite. You're going back to prison again. This time the charge is much more serious. This time you'll be tried for murder.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!? This can't... This is impossible!\nGodot:\nI'm looking forward to another exciting showdown, Mr. Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou and I aren't through with each other yet. Surely you won't back down from a challenge! You've never been a coward!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Is there something personal between you two...?\nGodot:\nI've returned from the depths of Hell to do battle with you. ...At least let me have some fun while I'm here!\nPhoenix:\n(This guy... Who the heck is he!? He may be quiet... But he's the most dangerous enemy I've ever faced...)\nGodot:\nWell then... Time to say goodbye to Mr. DeLite.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nN-Nick...! How could this be happening?\nPhoenix:\nRight in front of our every eyes, our client has been arrested for murder. And the one who established his presence at the scene... was me.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nEEEEEYYYAAAAHHH! R-RONNNIEEEEEEEE!\nPhoenix:\n(Arrested for murder on the very same day he's declared innocent of larceny... What the heck's going to happen next!?)\nTo be continued.\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?\nJudge:\nUh... I'm not sure I follow you.\nPhoenix:\nIt clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...\nJudge:\nYou don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!\nJudge:\n...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really?\nJudge:\nObjection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHow exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?\nPhoenix:\nThey aren't, are they...\nJudge:\nNot at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts.

Law Offices\nMaya:\nYou know, I'm glad we found the urn and all, but poor Mr. DeLite got arrested again.\nPhoenix:\nWell, supposedly, Mr. DeLite was in the CEO's office when the murder occurred.\nMaya:\nNo way, Jose! I don't buy it!\nPearl:\nBut the one who proved that Mr. DeLite was there... ...was Mr. Nick himself... ...At least, from what I can understand. (Changed from [It was Mr. Nick himself... ...At least, from what I can understand.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nLooks like you did too good of a job this time, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nUm, ah... well, how about we get started looking into the KB Security murder?\nPearl:\nI think I'm going to head back to Kurain Village for a little while, if that's alright.\nMaya:\nSure. But why?\nPearl:\nI'm going to bring the Sacred Urn back and have some people take a look at it!\nMaya:\nOh, that's a good idea! I think I'll go with--\nPearl:\nNo! Mystic Maya! You should stay here! I want you to spend some special quality time together, full of love and happiness!\nPhoenix:\n(...Maybe Pearls is so caught up in her fantasy she forgot there's a murder to solve.)\nSacred Urn given to Pearls.\nPearl:\nNow remember! No fighting, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...She's gone.\nMaya:\nOK, Nick! Time to get doing on this murder investigation!\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do we do now?\nMaya:\nIsn't it obvious!? We should get out there and investigate the murder!\nPhoenix:\nWell first, we need to find out exactly where KB Security is located.\nMaya:\n...Hey! Why don't we ask Ms. DeLite! She should know! Besides, I want to ask her some stuff about motorcycles!\nPhoenix:\nMotorcycles...? You're not thinking of getting one, are you?\nMaya:\nI'm not the same little Maya who used to be happy with her dinky little bike, Nicky boy.\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*... Speaking of asking around, I've got a few questions of my own for Mr. DeLite...\nMaya:\nOK, well, let's make sure to go to the detention center, too!\nSacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nYou must be relieved we got the Sacred Urn back, huh?\nMaya:\nYou bet! ...But there's something a little different about it.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nMaya:\nDon't \"...?\" at me! It's pretty obvious, isn't it? I mean, take a look at this. It clearly says, \"I AM\" on the urn in the poster. But the urn we got back says, \"AMI\", like it always used to.\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah... You're right.\nMaya:\nPlus, the vase has pink splotches on it now... ...I'm sure they wasn't there before!\nPhoenix:\n(Maya doesn't know, but 1 year ago... when the urn was broken... ...the repairer accidentally turned Mystic Ami's name into \"I AM\". And that repairer was one mechanically unskilled little Pearls. But still... I don't remember ever seeing pink splotches on it.)\nMaya:\nIs it possible that urn is a fake?\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure Pearls'll find out about that once she gets back to Kurain Village.\nMaya:\nYeah, I suppose...\nPhoenix:\n(Now that I think about it... Maya hasn't been back to Kurain Village in a long time...)\nKurain Village (appears after \"Sacred Urn\")\nPhoenix:\nSo... I guess people still go to Kurain Village to do their training, right?\nMaya:\nYup. If you want to become a spirit medium, you need to undergo severe training.\nPhoenix:\nSo why haven't you been training lately, Maya?\nMaya:\nWell... Lately I've been thinking of heading to a channeling dojo to do just that.\nPhoenix:\nA \"channeling dojo\", huh...? Sounds pretty serious, whatever that is.\nMaya:\nIf you're going to train, you have to be serious. Otherwise real tragedies can happen.\nPhoenix:\nIs what happened last year still bothering you...?\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(That murder in her village... It happened because the power of channeling was misused.)\nMaya:\nWhen a medium uses the Kurain Technique, she temporarily loses her own will.\nPhoenix:\nSo when an especially strong spirit is summoned... ...the spirit medium can get taken over and even forced to commit terrible crimes. What's worse, in those cases, the spirit medium has no memory of what happened.\n*BANG*\nPhoenix:\nThat murder... it wasn't your fault, Maya. You know that, don't you?\nMaya:\nI suppose not, but... ...I guess I'm still a bit shaken up. That's all.\nPhoenix:\n(It sounds like being the Master of Kurain is going to be a heavy responsibility...)\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster\nMaya:\nI'm glad we got the Sacred Urn back and all...\nPhoenix:\nSo then how come you don't look any happier?\nMaya:\nWhy should I!? I don't know if it should say \"AMI\" or \"I AM\" on it anymore... ...and now it's got big pink polka dots on it that weren't there anymore!\nPhoenix:\nDon't you think you're overreacting just a little?\nMaya:\nOverreacting!? Nick! I can't believe you said that! I mean, it's like... like... I got it! It's like if I came in wearing polka dots on my acolyte costume every day and said... \"Hi, Nick! I'm Ayam!\" Well!? Do you still think it's no big deal?\nPhoenix:\n...I guess... it would be... um... a real disaster...?\nMaya:\nYou see! You see! Well that's how I feel!\nCamera Data\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this data, the thief showed up at the basement warehouse at...\nMaya:\nUm, 1 o'clock in the morning, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but remember, this data came from Atmey... For all we know, he might have somehow tampered with it.\nMaya:\nBut... But then, what about this photo? It's got the time on it, too!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, and the security camera belonged to Lordly Tailor. Atmey couldn't have tampered with the photo's timestamp to show the wrong time...)\nMaya:\nI guess that means this data is accurate after all.\nSecurity Camera Photo\nMaya:\nSo the Mask\u2606DeMasque in this photo... ...is Detective Atmey in disguise, huh?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks that way. (Atmey knew there was a security camera set up in the basement... So I'm guessing this photo was probably a part of his elaborate plan...)\nShichishito\nPhoenix:\nIt's still bent, isn't it?\nMaya:\nDetective Atmey said it got bent when the thief hit him on the head with it.\nPhoenix:\nWell, it looks like he ended up the bent one after he turned out to be the thief. He must have damaged the sword himself to back up his phony story.\nMaya:\nYeah... I guess he really does have a brawny mind, huh?\nBlackmail Letter\nMaya:\nSo Mr. DeLite was being blackmailed, huh? By the CEO of the security company he used to work for.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it looks like it. (Sounds like we still need to do some more poking around...)\nMaya:\nYou'd better watch yourself and not do anything naughty either, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(Was that a threat? Is she trying to blackmail ME now...?)\nRon's Wallet or CEO Office Key Card\nPhoenix:\nThis was found in the building where the crime took place on the very night of the murder. And according to the time record on the key card inside...\nMaya:\nYeah, it was used right around the time of the murder... Doesn't sound very good, huh?\nPublicity Photo, Ron DeLite profile, or Mask\u2606DeMasque profile\nMaya:\nSo Detective Atmey was Mask\u2606DeMasque after all, huh?\nPhoenix:\nI guess so... After all, he did admit it.\nMaya:\nYes, but Mr. DeLite still hasn't changed his tune. He's still claiming that he's the real Mask\u2606DeMasque. You don't think he's just saying that to avoid the murder charge, do you?\nPhoenix:\n(I-I'm not sure...)\nDeMasque's Broach\nMaya:\nThis was found on the floor of the basement warehouse. So does that mean... Detective Atmey put it there himself?\nPhoenix:\nThat's the only explanation I can think of. I guess he wanted to make sure it looked like he'd struggled with the thief that night.\nPhoenix Wright profile\nMaya:\nYou're not very photogenic, are you?\nPhoenix:\n...! (Maybe I shouldn't show this picture to too many people... And yet... I've walked around my whole life, showing this face of mine to the world... I wonder if I've just been making a fool of myself with this silly face...)\nMaya:\nUm, I was only joking, Nick... Don't make such a sad face. You're making me feel guilty.\nPearl Fey profile\nMaya:\nPearly sure is a good kid.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. But she tends to let her imagination get the best of her, though.\nMaya:\nThat's one of the things I like about her, silly! Slapping you the way she did! She's a tough one alright!\nPhoenix:\nYou're telling me! I think she knocked a few teeth loose. (Pearls is only 9, but it's amazing how emotionally strong she is. After all... the only \"family\" she has left is her only cousin, Maya.)\nLuke Atmey profile\nMaya:\nI can hardly believe that guy was really the thief in disguise! I never saw that coming! Then again, I stink at spotting those \"plot twist\" things.\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey seemed to really enjoy himself today. Maybe a little too much.\nMaya:\nHa ha, yeah. Today was pretty wild. Like the plot of some crazy comic book!\nPhoenix:\nGreat, glad you had fun while I was getting abused by the prosecutor... as always.\nLarry Butz profile\nMaya:\nOh, it's Larry. He's your childhood friend, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I've known him since elementary school.\nMaya:\nWow...! That's even longer than I've known Pearly. You two must have lots of good memories together!\nPhoenix:\nI guess so. But I can hardly remember them... They've been erased by all the traumatic ones.\nGodot profile\nMaya:\nSay, Nick... What do you think that thing attached to his face is anyway?\nPhoenix:\nDon't ask me.\nMaya:\nWhy not? You know him, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nI've never met that guy before in my life! And believe me, he's not exactly forgettable.\nMaya:\nYeah, but at the trial today, he said...\nGodot:\nSo we finally meet... Mr. Phoenix Trite!\nGodot:\nI've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right about one thing. He sure acts like he knows me.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick? I was just thinking... Maybe you should try to stop making people you've never met before into your enemies.\nPhoenix:\nTrust me, I'd like to stop doing that, too. My poor body can only take so much. (Who is that guy anyway? And what's his story? I wonder if I'll ever find out...)\nOctober 13Lordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall\nMaya:\nThe Treasures of Kurain exhibit is all ruined now...\nPhoenix:\nMaya...\nMaya:\nI'm sorry, it's just so sad... This was our big chance for everyone to learn about spirit channeling...\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe I can cheer her up somehow...) Well, now that we've got the Sacred Urn back, maybe they can reopen it?\nMaya:\nR-Really...?\nPhoenix:\nSure! Maybe we can label it, \"The Urn of Mask\u2606DeMasque's Desires\"! That would probably attract a lot of attention!\nMaya:\n...Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!! That's brilliant, Nick! We could clean up! And be filthy rich! Woohoo!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, that was surprisingly easy...)\nOctober 13Lordly TailorBasement Warehouse\nAndrews:\nOh...! It's you, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews... (What's she still hanging around down here for?)\nAndrews:\nUm, so! How is it going!? What about the Sacred Urn...?\nPhoenix:\nThe urn...? Oh, that. It's been taken care of already.\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean, \"Oh, that\"!?\nAndrews:\n\"Taken care of\"...? Do you mean... It's been found!?\nMaya:\nYes! It was brought in during the trial today!\nAndrews:\nWow! Really!? You really are the greatest, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\n\"Mr. Wright\" had nothing to do with it. It was Mask\u2606DeMasque's wife that found it!\nAndrews:\nWell, anyway, I'm... I'm so relieved!\nExamine\nSecurity camera or computer\nMaya:\nThis is the camera and computer that Detective Atmey set up, huh?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he said.\nMaya:\nAnd yet he still let it take a picture of him. I guess he's not as smart as he pretends to be!\nPhoenix:\n(The camera belonged to Lordly Tailor, so he knew he couldn't tamper with it... So then why would Atmey, I mean, Mask\u2606DeMasque, allow that to happen...?)\nShichishito\nMaya:\nDetective Atmey said he got hit on the back of the head with this by the thief. But that was obviously a lie.\nAndrews:\nBecause it turned out that Atmey was the real thief... It's still hard to believe...\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like Adrian feels really bad about it...)\nAndrews:\nI'm going to take full responsibility and fix that sword myself! I know I don't look it, but I have complete confidence that I can fix it right up! I promise I'll fix it so you never knew it was bent in the first place!\nMaya:\nP-Please be gentle with it...\nDoor to the storeroom\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like the door to the actual storeroom. I can see lots of big boxes and stuff back there.\nMaya:\nI guess that's where they were keeping the Sacred Urn.\nPhoenix:\nRemember, Maya. Ms. Andrews said we're not allowed in there.\nAmi Fey statue\nPhoenix:\nThe statue wasn't where it is now when we first came here, right?\nMaya:\nYeah, it was right next to the door, wasn't it?\nPhoenix:\nWell, if someone moved it, it was probably Mask\u2606DeMasque.\nMaya:\nMaybe he didn't like being watched by Mystic Ami while he stole the urn.\nPhoenix:\n...Hey! Cut it out! You're giving me the creeps with that kind of talk!\n\"ORGANIZE\" panels\nPhoenix:\nIt says \"ORGANI\".\nMaya:\nNo it doesn't, Nick! It says, \"ORGANIZE\"! You just can't see the last two letters.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well I guess no one else could read it either, because this place is a mess.\nMaya:\nYeah. So you should feel right at home, right?\nTalk\nDeMasque's identity\nAndrews:\nI just heard all about it on the news... So that detective was actually the thief all along!\nPhoenix:\nIt looks that way right now.\nAndrews:\nIt-It's my fault. I'm the one who ended up hiring DeMasque to guard the treasures...\nPhoenix:\nDon't blame yourself. You were just doing your job.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick, if she wants to apologize, you should let her. So... When was it that you hired Detective Atmey again...?\nAndrews:\nAbout 20 days ago.\nPhoenix:\nAnd when was it that Mask\u2606DeMasque's calling card arrived?\nAndrews:\nThat was about 10 days ago.\nPhoenix:\nSo he sent a calling card to the very place he was hired to guard...\nMaya:\nI guess that's it then. Detective Atmey must have really wanted the Sacred Urn after all.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess so...)\nThe night of the crime\nAndrews:\nWhat!? So Mask\u2606DeMasque m-murdered someone as well...?\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's how things look right now.\nAndrews:\nYes, but... I thought that he was here stealing the urn at the time...?\nPhoenix:\nWell... We're talking about a criminal mastermind, so anything is possible.\nMaya:\nNick, let's get down to business already. On the night of the theft, did you notice anything suspicious about Detective Atmey?\nAndrews:\nNo... I couldn't have. After all, he was hidden the entire time. I never even caught a glimpse of him.\nPhoenix:\nHe claims that's the way he always operates...\nMaya:\nThat's just what he says so he can have an alibi while he commits the thefts himself.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he was caught on the crime scene photo dressed up as Mask\u2606DeMasque pretty well.\nSacred Urn\nAndrews:\nI'm so glad that you got your Sacred Urn back...\nPhoenix:\nYes... But there's still something that bothers me about it.\nAndrews:\nWh-What is it?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not exactly sure... But somehow the urn that came back seems different...\nAndrews:\nR-Really...?\nMaya:\nYou wouldn't know anything about that, would you Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nN-No, I don't know anything! Wh-Why would I?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(Psyche-Locks...!) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock...!] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat do you think this means, Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nIt means the person that holds the secret to the mystery of the Sacred Urn... ...is our very own Ms. Andrews!\nSacred Urn (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo... Do you know anything about the Sacred Urn?\nAndrews:\nWh-Who? M-Me?\nMaya:\nIn court today, Ms. DeLite brought the urn back... But... It's a little different from the urn I remember.\nAndrews:\n...!\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(So Adrian does know something that she's not telling us...)\nMaya:\nNick, I want to find out about the murder, but I also want to know about the urn.\nPhoenix:\n(I'd like to know myself. Another loose end to tie up, I guess.)\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster\nAndrews:\nThe Treasures of Kurain exhibit is my first job after last year's ordeal. And I really wanted it to be a success!\nPhoenix:\nI've got an idea! Why don't you redo the whole poster?\nMaya:\nYou could put something like, \"Voted Best Treasure Exhibit by Mask\u2606DeMasque\"!\nAndrews:\n...Why Maya! That's a fantastic idea!\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nAndrews:\nI heard Detective Atmey for security before we even received a calling card... I suppose that was a mistake...\nPhoenix:\nAtmey... I mean, Mask\u2606DeMasque... He sent a calling card to the very exhibit he was hired to guard...\nMaya:\nI wonder if it was because he knew it would be easy to steal.\nAndrews:\nYes, but he should have also known that he could easily become a suspect.\nAmi Fey's Golden Statue\nAndrews:\nI thought the whole exhibit would be brightened up by something shiny and gold. That's why I went to the trouble of borrowing it from a branch family training hall.\nMaya:\nA gold statue is totally cool in my book.\nAndrews:\nIt arrived rather late, so I thought I wouldn't be able to put it on display.\nPhoenix:\nBy the way, it looks like this statue was moved on the night of the theft... Do you know anything about that?\nAndrews:\nHuh! N-No! It-It certainly wasn't me that moved it!\nPhoenix:\n(Why is she so flustered all of a sudden...?)\nCamera Data or Security Camera Photo\nAndrews:\nThe security camera was provided by Lordly Tailor Department Store. I took a close look at it on the day after the theft... The timestamp on the photo is definitely real.\nShichishito\nMaya:\nDetective Atmey said he got hit on the back of the head with this by the thief. But that was obviously a lie.\nAndrews:\nBecause it turned out that Atmey was the real thief... It's still hard to believe...\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like Adrian feels really bad about it...)\nAndrews:\nI'm going to take full responsibility and fix that sword myself! I know I don't look it, but I have complete confidence that I can fix it right up! I promise I'll fix it so you never knew it was bent in the first place!\nMaya:\nP-Please be gentle with it...\nMaya Fey profile\nAndrews:\nMs. Fey, I'd love to introduce you at the exhibit, if you don't mind.\nMaya:\nReally? I'd really happy to do whatever I can to help! Oh, I have an idea! Maybe I could sing a song? \"The Master of Kurain\" or \"The Spirit Song\" or perhaps \"Maya's Theme\"?\nAndrews:\nThat sounds wonderful! I had no idea such songs actually existed.\nMaya:\nWell they don't... yet. I was going to make Nick write them.\nPhoenix:\n...Be serious.\nPearl Fey profile\nAndrews:\nShe's such a cute little girl. I'm deeply in her debt for what she did 7 months ago.\nMaya:\nHer name is Pearl. She's training to be a spirit medium!\nAndrews:\nTraining at such a young age... That's very impressive. Well, as a fellow career woman, I salute her!\nMaya:\nCareer woman, huh...?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that's one way to look at spirit mediums... since they're all women...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nAndrews:\nNow I realize I should have called the police. As soon as I got that calling card from Mask\u2606DeMasque, I mean.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I guess you should have.\nMaya:\nWell, now Detective Gumshoe has one more failure to add to his list.\nAndrews:\nOh? You mean he's not a very good detective?\nPhoenix:\n(It's a good thing he's not here to hear us talking about him...)\nLuke Atmey profile\nAndrews:\nSo Detective Atmey was actually Mask\u2606DeMasque... ...\nMaya:\nShe really seems depressed.\nPhoenix:\nI can't say I blame her. She's the one who hired the fox to guard the henhouse.\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\n...I'm really terrible at judging people, I guess. I should have learned my lesson after what happened 7 months ago... But I didn't! I got taken in by this... this... flimflam detective!\nMaya:\nDon't feel so sad. After we're here to help!\nAndrews:\nYes! Mr. Wright is a really wonderful man, isn't he?\nPhoenix:\nThat should've made me happy. but she just admitted she's terrible at judging people...\nMaya:\nOh, come on... I can tell you're happy anyway.\nAnything else\nAndrews:\nI'm sorry I can't help more, but I'm so busy taking care of everything in front of me. I still haven't given up on the Treasures of Kurain exhibit.\nMaya:\nOh, Ms. Andrews! I'm so happy to hear you say that!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like the Treasure Exhibit is the only thing she has on her mind...)\nOctober 13Atmey Detective Agency\nPhoenix:\nWhoa, this place is literally crawling with cops!\nMaya:\nWhat did you expect? Now that they know he was actually Mask\u2606DeMasque... This must be incredibly embarrassing for them, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I guess they're trying to make up for it by tearing the place apart. Hey, I just noticed... Gumshoe is nowhere to be seen.\nMaya:\nWell, he is a homicide detective. He's probably working on the murder case.\nPhoenix:\nBut wasn't he in charge of the Mask\u2606DeMasque investigation all the way up to yesterday?\nMaya:\nWell, a murder case is a lot more exciting, isn't it? He'd say something like: \"There's nothin' like a good murder case, pal.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Points for the quality of the impression, but I'm not sure Gumshoe has bloodlust, Maya.)\nExamine\nAnything\nOfficer:\nHey! You guys!\nMaya:\nEeek!\nOfficer:\nWe're investigating this place! So keep your hands to yourselves!\nMaya:\nBoy! These policemen sure are a bunch of sourpusses!\nPhoenix:\nWell, Mr. Ace Detective did make complete and utter fools out of them...\nOfficer:\nWhat's all this now! Move it along! The show's over!\nMaya:\nAww... It doesn't look like they're going to let us investigate.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess we might as well call it a day for this place and go look somewhere else.)\nOctober 13Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nRon:\nI already told you! It's not meeeeeeeee\nMaya:\nA sad, pitiful whine that tapers into silence...\nPhoenix:\nSounds like they're interrogating Mr. DeLite right now.\nMaya:\nMan, and we don't have enough time as it is.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well, I guess the police are going crazy just like we are. Yesterday they thought he was just a thief, but now they got a murder case on their hands.\nMaya:\nI guess you're right... That guard over there looks a bit on edge, too.\nPhoenix:\nCome on. We'll just have to come back later.\nMaya:\nOK! Let's go check out some other place, Nick!\nOctober 13Mask\u2606DeMasque's Hideout\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOh! Nicky boy! Maya!\nPhoenix:\nMs. DeLite...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nAll I wanted to do was help my dear Ronnie...!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... but I guess it ended up hurting his case...\nMaya:\nDon't say that, Nick! She don't need your help beating herself up.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nHey, Nicky boy! Please! Please help Ronnie! He's not a killer, I swear! My Ronnie wouldn't hurt a fly!\nPhoenix:\n...Alright. I'll poke around and see what I can find out.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nReally! Are you serious!? Oh, I'm so happy! I knew asking for your help was the right thing to do. I... I don't know what I can do to help anymore...\nPhoenix:\n(I had no idea Ms. DeLite had such a vulnerable side.)\nExamine\nPiled stuff on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a whole bunch of stuff piled up over here.\nMaya:\nWhat are these rolls of paper stuck in the trash can? \"Theft of the Mazarin Stone: The Great Albatross Strategy\" \"Theft of the Immortal Goddess Statue: The Great Knucklebomber Strategy\"\nPhoenix:\n... (Did the police even investigate this place...?)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nThe police took a look at all of that, you know.\nMaya:\nReally!? Did they say anything?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nThey said it wasn't important.\nPhoenix:\nOh?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nDon't worry about it, Nicky boy. After all, my Ronnie is just an amateur.\nMaya:\nAmateur or not, this is cool! \"Knucklebomber\"! How cool is that!?\nMasks and beard\nPhoenix:\nIt's a bunch of cheap costume pieces arranged inside a nice frame.\nMaya:\nL-Look, Nick! It's a fake beard!\nPhoenix:\nThere's also a mask made out of cardboard...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Try on this fake beard! Come on! Try it on!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey! Cut it out...\nMaya:\nNow put on the mask! ... Aha ha ha ha ha ha! It's Phoenix\u2606DeMasque!\nDesir\u00e9e:\nIf you like it, feel free to take it home with you.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, but no thanks!\nHelmet and transceiver\nPhoenix:\n(Hmmm... This thing looks vaguely familiar.)\nMaya:\nOh, I know! It's a fishbowl! Well, an upside-down one, anyway...\nPhoenix:\nI think it's a helmet. ...An alien helmet.\nMaya:\nAnd that looks like a tape recorder or something next to it.\nPhoenix:\nI think it's a transceiver. ...An alien transceiver.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOh, that. Ronnie brought that home one day. He asked one of his friends from work if he could have it. It's a Space Ranger uniform. I've never seen Ronnie happier in his whole time.\nMaya:\nOh, man... Now I want one, too!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if KB Security was in charge of security at the event from that old case?)\nDeMasque model\nMaya:\nIt's Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\nThere's a tape recorder hanging from his neck.\nMaya:\nLet me see that!\n...click...\nDeMasque:\nAha ha ha ha ha ha ha... I'll be taking this crown now! Better luck next time, gentlemen! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nRonnie used to say that \"a happy laugh is the lifeblood of a thief\".\nMaya:\nWell, that certainly is a happy-sounding laugh alright.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYes, and laughing isn't as easy as it sounds. The harder you try, the more fake it sounds.\nMaya:\nYeah. Mr. DeLite really works hard at his craft, huh?\nBooks\nPhoenix:\nThere are a bunch of books lying here. They're all romantic-sounding novels about famous heists and fantastic thieves.\nMaya:\nWow! Look at all the bookmarks and notes stuck into them!\nPhoenix:\nLet's see here... \"Note: Must remember this thief's way of laughing. Very useful.\" \"Note: A calling card is an important part of any good thief's modus operandi!\"\nDesir\u00e9e:\nIt was always Ronnie's dream to become a thief.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess you can chalk that one down as fulfilled...)\nMaya:\nI wonder why Mr. DeLite never talked to his wife about it?\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, well I think she deserves some of the blame for not bringing it up either.\nTalk\nRon DeLite\nDesir\u00e9e:\nListen carefully, Nicky boy! My Ronnie would never, ever kill anyone! It's just not in him!\nMaya:\n...I don't think he would either, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but you have to admit he's got a bit of a temper to him. It's not that hard to imagine him just snapping and screaming, \"Please diiiiie!\"\nMaya:\nHe would never say that! Anyway, Ms. DeLite, he might not be a killer... ...but he's still going around saying that he's a \"thief\"...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nI already told you, that's just a fantasy for him...\nPhoenix:\nMs. DeLite, I hate to say it, but you're the one living in a fantasy world.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nWh-Wh-What!? How dare you say that to me, Nicky boy! I know everything about my Ronnie! We don't have any secrets between us! Ronnie isn't the thieving type! He's so honest that he wouldn't even sneak a nap! (Changed from [Ronnie isn't the thief type! He's so honest that he wouldn't even sneak a nap!] in the original release) He-He's so honest that he wouldn't even steal a glance! A thief! Ha! The very idea...! (Changed from [He-He's so honest that he wouldn't even steal a glance! Thief! Ha! The very idea...!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I guess I just don't get it...\nMaya:\nHuh? Get what?\nPhoenix:\nI just can't understand how they can be so different, and yet, be such a happy couple!\nMaya:\nYeah, they sure are different.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nCome on now, Nicky boy! It's not that mysterious, is it? It was love at first sight! ...For me, anyway.\nMaya:\nWhat!? F-For you?\nDetective Atmey\nDesir\u00e9e:\nI hate these kinds of people more than anything!\nMaya:\nUmm... You mean Ace Detectives?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nNo, I'm fine with Ace Detectives.\nMaya:\nOh... So then you must mean thieves?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nNo, they're alright, too. I just hate thieves that pretend to be Ace Detectives! There's nothing I hate more than cowardly men!\nMaya:\nBy the way, why did you go to Detective Atmey's office anyway?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nWell, as the trial went on, I started to get more and more nervous. I went there to try to find out more about the \"real criminal\".\nMaya:\nThe \"real criminal\"...?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYes! Obviously, the real Mask\u2606DeMasque is not my Ronnie, right?\nMaya:\nY-Yeah...?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nAnd Detective Atmey knew more about Mask\u2606DeMasque than anyone else... They mentioned him on the \"Great People of the Town\" segment on TV.\nPhoenix:\nSo then... you went there to ask him some questions?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nThat's right. I'll do whatever it takes to save my man! His secretary said, \"The Ace Detective isn't in right now!\" But I forced my way past her and into his hideout.\nPhoenix:\n(I wouldn't exactly call that office of his a \"hideout\"...)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nThat bag was sitting right there on top of the table.\nMaya:\nOh yeah, we saw that bag there yesterday, too.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nThere's nothing lower than someone who would try to pin a crime on someone else.\nKB Security\nMaya:\nMs. DeLite, do you know about KB Security?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nDon't be silly, of course I do. That's where my Ronnie works.\nPhoenix:\n(So she thinks he still works there, huh... And yet, according to what we heard today... (Changed from [Oh, that's right. According to what we heard today...] in the original release))\nGodot:\nCome on! Don't tell me you didn't know! (Changed from [Come on! Don't tell me you didn't know it!] in the original release) Ron DeLite was once an employee of KB Security... He was a professional security guard.\nPhoenix:\n(...Ron quit. He doesn't work there anymore.) (Changed from [...But he quit. He doesn't work there anymore.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nIt looks like Ms. DeLite doesn't know...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nKB Security is only about 20 minutes away. By motorcycle, that is.\nPhoenix:\nLarry told me it takes 30 minutes by car...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nWell, I have to admit I tend to fly pretty fast on my bike.\nPhoenix:\n(To make it to KB Security that fast, are you sure you aren't literally flying...?)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nWhy don't I give you a ride sometime? Or better yet, how about now?\nPhoenix:\nUm, ahh... N-No...! I'll pass, th-thanks! Wh-Why don't you just tell us where it is and we'll go ourselves.\nMaya:\nHa ha, what a scaredy-cat you are, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Ms. DeLite told us the location of KB Security.)\nMaya:\nOK. Let's head over there right away, Nick!\nLove at first sight? (appears after \"Ron DeLite\")\nMaya:\nUmm... So was it really love at first sight when you first met Mr. DeLite?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nWell, maybe not at first sight, but Ronnie saved my life.\nMaya:\nSaved your life...?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nI was at work one day when two robbers suddenly rushed in. Well, I'm not the kind to just curl into a little ball in a corner, so I fought back.\nPhoenix:\nR-Robbers?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYes, they took me hostage. I was so frightened. They were both carrying these huge knives and... I-I broke down into tears.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... I would too, if I were in that situation.)\nMaya:\nOh! I think I get it! Did Mr. DeLite come running to save you?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYes! Exactly! I remember he looked so handsome in that guard uniform of his! He went right up to those two knife-wielding robbers... and screamed in their faces! \"PLEASE, STOP IIIIIIIIIIT!\" he screamed. I could see the robbers' faces turn pale...\nPhoenix:\n(That high-pitched shriek of his does have a surprisingly strong effect on people...)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nThen, crying and swinging his arms like crazy, he attacked the two robbers. All by himself... He came to save me, a total stranger, all by himself... He was so scared that he was crying and shaking, but he still risked his life for me.\nMaya:\n...Wow. That's a great story...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYes. He may not look it, but in a tough situation, there's no one better... ...That's why I fell in love with him like I did.\nPhoenix:\n*sniff sniff* Th-That's so romantic... I'd fall in love too, I guess.\nMaya:\nNick, I hope you'll do the same for me if I ever get taken hostage...\nPhoenix:\n(With Maya, that possibility always seems to loom in the not so distant future. *gulp*)\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster\nDesir\u00e9e:\nI'm so happy that you got your Sacred Urn back.\nMaya:\nWell, I have you to thank for that, Ms. DeLite! ...A-And I'm sorry.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nHuh...? What are you apologizing for?\nMaya:\nBecause I mistakenly blamed your husband for taking it...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nHa! I told you, didn't I? My Ronnie could never do such a thing.\nBlackmail Letter\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Do you know about this?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOh, is that a letter addressed to my Ronnie? Sorry, but I hate it when people poke their noses into other people's business.\nMaya:\nIt looks like Ms. DeLite doesn't know about it... Which means she has no idea that her husband was being blackmailed...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nHuh...? What are you apologizing for?\nMaya:\nBecause I mistakenly blamed your husband for taking it...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nHa! I told you, didn't I? My Ronnie could never do such a thing.\nRon's Wallet\nDesir\u00e9e:\nThat's Ronnie's wallet.\nMaya:\nIt was found at KB Security on the night of the murder...\nDesir\u00e9e:\nRonnie and I went out to dinner early that evening... I'm sure he had his wallet with him then.\nPhoenix:\n(So it's true then. He must have dropped it at the crime scene...)\nCEO Office Key Card\nDesir\u00e9e:\nAh! I know what that is! That's one of those key cards from Ronnie's company. ...Come to think of it, it's been a long time since I've seen one.\nPhoenix:\n(That's probably because Ron doesn't work there anymore...)\nPublicity Photo or Mask\u2606DeMasque profile\nDesir\u00e9e:\nSo this is Mask\u2606DeMasque, huh? I wonder what kind of a house he lives in.\nPhoenix:\nWho knows... Maybe it's exactly like this house.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nHa ha ha, you're so funny sometimes, Nicky boy. But if I was a famous thief, I'd live in a great big, gorgeous mansion.\nPhoenix:\n...I'll be sure to tell that to your husband.\nPearl Fey profile\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOh, this girl. I saw her slap Nicky boy right across the face.\nPhoenix:\nUm, ah, yeah, she did... (Of all the ways she could remember Pearls by... Why?)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nShe's such a little cutie. If you could bring her by, I'd love to meet her.\nMaya:\nSure! Of course!\nPhoenix:\n(Great... I can tell I'm in for a reprise of the \"Hundred Hand Slap\"...)\nMaya:\n...?\nRon DeLite profile\nDesir\u00e9e:\nI know he doesn't look it... But he can really get things done when he puts his mind to it.\nMaya:\nReally? So when exactly does he put his mind to it?\nDesir\u00e9e:\n...Well. Not very often, I admit. ...But I'll never forget the first time we met as long as I live.\nMaya:\nIt must be nice to have such a fond memory like that...\nLuke Atmey profile\nDesir\u00e9e:\nI'll never forgive this man. He tried to pin his own crimes on my Ronnie.\nMaya:\nI don't blame you!\nDesir\u00e9e:\nAll criminals are the same! They're nothing but filthy, sneaking liars! I hate their guts!\nPhoenix:\n(*gulp* OK, I think I get it... ...And I think I can see why Ron didn't tell her how he was earning that money.)\nLarry Butz profile\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOh, this is the guy who delivered Ronnie's wallet. He's got some \"issues\". doesn't he?\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nLet's just say his flirting style is pretty obvious. ...Pretty stale too, actually. It's pretty sad when the only thing you remember about a man are his lame pick-up lines.\nPhoenix:\n(What's even more sad is said man probably believes in those like they're his life-lines.)\nMaya:\n...Looks like he blew it again, huh?\nGodot profile\nDesir\u00e9e:\nGrrr, I don't like this man one bit. He's had it in for my Ronnie from the very beginning. It's his fault that Ronnie is under suspicion of committing murder.\nPhoenix:\nPlus, he lobbed a coffee grenade at me!\nMaya:\nYou looked pretty silly wearing that mug on your head like a birthday hat... Oh, I know! We can get him back tomorrow by returning fire with a milk grenade!\nAfter clearing \"KB Security\" Talk option in Mask\u2606DeMasque's Hideout:\nOctober 13KB SecurityCEO's Office\nPhoenix:\nSo I guess this is where it all went down, huh...?\nMaya:\nThe walls in here look thick... just you'd expect in a CEO's office.\nPhoenix:\n(What has that got to do with anything...?)\nGumshoe:\nHey! It's you guys!\nPhoenix:\nOh, it's Detective Gumshoe.\nGumshoe:\nToday was a real train wreck for you guys, huh?\nMaya:\nSure was, pal! That prosecutor made real fools out of us...\nGumshoe:\nYeah... I feel for you.\nMaya:\nWow, that's not like you at all... I thought you'd be more like... \"Oh, that was great! You guys got what you deserved, pal! Ho ho ho ho!\" Or something to that effect.\nGumshoe:\nD-Do I really sound like that to you, pal?\nMaya:\nIf the Gumshoe fits...\nGumshoe:\nUm... Well, anyway... The point is I can tell when someone puts their heart into their jobs. And I can sympathize when things don't go your way. ...Sometimes, I feel like \"wrong\" is the only way things go for us detectives.\nMaya:\nWow, I had no idea Detective Gumshoe was such a nice guy.\nPhoenix:\n(Now if this little love-fest is over, maybe we can start investigating...)\nExamine\nSafe\nMaya:\nWow! This safe is unbelievable...\nPhoenix:\nI bet four Pearls would fit in there.\nMaya:\nAnd it's got a bunch of doohickeys attached to it.\nPhoenix:\nIt's pretty amazing alright. Motion sensors, heat sensors, weight sensors...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. Come on! Let's open it and take a look!\nPhoenix:\nIf I broke into one of these, wouldn't that set me down the path to hoodlumville?\nWhite string\nMaya:\nThis rope... You think it fell out of the safe when it was opened?\nPhoenix:\n...I don't think so.\nMaya:\nSo, you mean...?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think this string shows where and how the corpse was lying.\nMaya:\nY-Y-You mean... The victim... H-He was killed by being crushed by the safe door?\nPhoenix:\n(Sh-She can't be serious... Can she...?)\nPhoto\nMaya:\nWow! Look at that huge framed photo!\nPhoenix:\nTall mountains rising majestically against a dark and cloudy sky...\nMaya:\nThere's a title written at the bottom of the photo. \"The Greatest Sunrise of My Life\"... This is it? This was his best sunrise?\nPhoenix:\nEither this guy didn't get out enough or he had really rotten luck with the weather.\nMaya:\nMaybe if he had lived a little longer, he would have seen some better days.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the CEO's desk. It's a lot simpler than I would have thought.\nMaya:\nHey, that looks like a super soft chair. Let me try it out, just for a second... Ooh. Nice... I feel just like a CEO. Hey, you! Whip me up a cup of some really expensive import tea and some scones! Move it! ...Ahhh, this is the life.\nGumshoe:\nUm, the victim sat in that chair just before he was brutally killed, you know.\nMaya:\nEEEEEEEK!\nBinder\nPhoenix:\nCheck out this big, thick binder here...\nMaya:\nLeave the heavy lifting to me, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(Reading a file isn't exactly back-breaking work, just a little hard on the eyes...) ...Ah!\nMaya:\nWh-What did you find out, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThis file... It's not about any sort of security operations or anything! This huge file is all about Mask\u2606DeMasque! It's filled with info on him!\nMaya:\nWhat!? What kind of info?\nPhoenix:\nIt's filled with incredibly detailed information about his methods and the crime scenes.\nMaya:\n...? Hey, Nick. Look at the last page!\nPhoenix:\nIt's a list. Let's see... \"Tear of Emanon... $100,000\" ...This looks like a list of all the treasures that Mask\u2606DeMasque stole.\nMaya:\nSo then \"$100,000\" is the value of the stolen item?\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know, that number sounds kind of low to me. (I think I'd better secretly make a copy of this list.)\nKane's List added to the Court Record.\nBinder (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nCheck out this big, thick binder here...\nMaya:\nLeave the heavy lifting to me, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(Reading a file isn't exactly back-breaking work, just a little hard on the eyes...) ...Ah!\nMaya:\nWh-What did you find out, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThis file...

Let's see...\nBuzzer:\n*BEEP BEEP BEEEEEEEEEP!!*\nGumshoe:\nHey! Cut it out! Don't press that!\nMaya:\nHa ha ha! That was pretty funny. I never knew Detective Gumshoe could jump like that!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is that button anyway?\nGumshoe:\nIt's an emergency buzzer! It says it right there on the panel!\nMaya:\nOops, you're right! It's written right there! Nick, how many times have I told you to read the instructions first!?\nGumshoe:\nThis alarm's connected to the basement guard room. It's used to summon security up here.\nPhoenix:\n...Really? Then it's possible on the night of the crime...\nMaya:\nOoh! So when the CEO was attacked... ...do you think that maybe he pressed the buzzer...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I thought about that, so I asked around down there... ...but they said that the buzzer never went off that night. Also, we couldn't find any fingerprints on the buzzer. Mr. Bullard, the victim, wasn't wearing any gloves, by the way. Just so you know.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I think we'd better go and talk to that guard about this emergency buzzer.)\nEmergency Buzzer added to the Court Record.\nButton (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nOh, there's a button here. Let's see...\nBuzzer:\n*BEEP BEEP BEEEEEEEEEP!!*\nGumshoe:\nHey! Cut it out! Don't press that!\nMaya:\nHa ha ha! That was pretty funny.

I think we'd better go and talk to that guard about this emergency buzzer.)\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nThese look like some kind of bookshelf/rolling cabinet hybrid.\nMaya:\n...Nnnnnf! I can't get in between these two shelves!\nPhoenix:\nDon't strain yourself trying. It looks like the shelves are controlled by a special panel.\nMaya:\nSo I guess it's one shelf at a time, huh? Looks like they're filled with bunches of files.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, files filled with data about security jobs they were hired to handle.\nMaya:\nIt'd be a good night's reading. ...If you've got insomnia. I was hoping for something a little bit more exciting... Like UFOs or something.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe. Tell us what you know about the murder!\nGumshoe:\nUmm, OK. But the thing is, I'm really not supposed to...\nMaya:\nHey, come on! What about how we \"put our hearts into our work\"? Things are really \"working against us\" right now and we need help...!\nGumshoe:\nOK, OK! I tell you! Just don't start crying on me, OK pal?\nMaya:\nOK. I won't cry on you, pal.\nGumshoe:\nThe victim's name is Kane Bullard. He was the CEO of KB Security and a pretty big fella in his own right. His corpse was discovered at 9:00 this morning... His estimated time of death was 1:00 in the morning on October 12th. Cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head. Probably an object in this room.\nPhoenix:\n(It happened at exactly the same time that Mask\u2606DeMasque was stealing the urn, huh...)\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\nSo why did it take almost an entire day to discover the body?\nGumshoe:\nThere's a good explanation for that one. Bullard's body was stashed away inside that safe.\nPhoenix:\nSafe...? (Well, it is pretty big...)\nGumshoe:\nNobody had heard from him, and when they opened the safe this morning, out he came...\nPhoenix:\nOh, so the body fell out... (That white string must be the shape from when he fell out.)\nMaya:\nI think we still need some more information about Mr. Billiard...\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe you could start by getting the man's name right.)\nWhat happened (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe. Tell us what you know about the murder!\nGumshoe:\nUmm, OK. But the thing is, I'm really not supposed to...\nMaya:\nHey, come on! What about how we \"put our hearts into our work\"? Things are really \"working against us\" right now and we need help...!\nGumshoe:\nOK, OK! I tell you! Just don't start crying on me, OK pal?\nMaya:\nOK.

What happened to Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nGumshoe:\nHe's at the detention center screaming like a madman... \"Investigate me agaaaaain!\" he keeps yelling.\nPhoenix:\nAh, no no. I didn't mean him. He's not the real thief anyway, right?\nGumshoe:\nOh, you mean that \"Detective\" Atmey? Ho ho ho ho ho... Oh, that was great! That guy got what he deserved! Ho ho ho ho!\nMaya:\nNow that's the Detective I know and love.\nGumshoe:\nThink about it... Atmey was always around when a calling card showed up. But he always mysteriously disappeared when the heists took place! \"I was hiding at the crime scene\"... Heh! Yeah right! That's the lamest thing I've ever heard! That's how you just knew he was the thief!\nPhoenix:\nThat would explain how he was able to retrieve the stolen item he keeps bragging about.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he just did that to make himself look like a great detective. That's all. ...But there's this one thing I can't figure out about his first heist...\nPhoenix:\nHis first heist...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, the \"Tear of Emanon\" case. There was a witness on that one.\nMaya:\nA witness...?\nGumshoe:\nHere, I saved the newspaper clipping... Since the thief is already under arrest, you guys can keep it.\nMaya:\nHey, this guard here... Haven't I seen him somewhere before?\nPhoenix:\n(It's pretty small so it's kind of hard to see, but now that she mentions it...)\nNewspaper Clipping added to the Court Record.\nDetective Atmey (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nSo, umm... What happened to Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nGumshoe:\nHe's at the detention center screaming like a madman... \"Investigate me agaaaaain!\" he keeps yelling.\nPhoenix:\nAh, no no. I didn't mean him.

Haven't I seen him somewhere before?\nPhoenix:\n(It's pretty small so it's kind of hard to see, but now that she mentions it...)\nProsecutor Godot\nMaya:\nOoh! That prosecutor! I really don't like that guy! The way he used our own evidence to do that to Mr. DeLite...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I think he did it that way just 'cause he knew it'd hurt more... That's what my gut tells me anyway.\nPhoenix:\nSo who is that java addicted, masked maniac anyway?\nGumshoe:\nProsecutor Godot? He's quite the enigma, huh? The thing is, pal... I never even heard of the guy before. He just showed up one day at the prosecutor's office. ...Came outta nowhere.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, he said this was his first case as a prosecutor!\nGumshoe:\nAnd it's true... According to the records, anyway. But! No way he's an amateur. He's an iceman in court, a maverick that give [sic] me goosebumps.\nMaya:\nGoosebumps...? You?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I knew something was off about him, so I asked around... Nobody would talk to me... They all just turned the other way.\nMaya:\nPoor Detective Gumshoe... I had no idea you were so unpopular...\nGumshoe:\nAh, no. That's not what I meant...\nPhoenix:\n(That Godot guy acts like he knows me and has a grudge against me... I get the feeling he's hiding some kind of dark secret...)\nThe victim (appears after presenting Kane Bullard profile)\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell us some more about Mr. Bullard?\nMaya:\nHe was the CEO of KB Security, right? What kind of company is it anyway?\nGumshoe:\nWell, the company basically sends security teams out to buildings to guard them. Mr. Bullard must've had the chance to learn a lot of secrets doing this kinda work.\nPhoenix:\nOh? And?\nGumshoe:\nAnd... I don't know how to put this, but the guy was kind of a moneygrubber.\nMaya:\nReally? Me too! I just love money! I can't ever get enough!\nPhoenix:\n(Please stop leaning in towards me like that... You aren't getting to my wallet.)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, it looks like he did some pretty shifty stuff to earn his millions.\nMaya:\nOh! So that's my problem! I think I need to be shiftier!\nPhoenix:\n(Lemme go already...)\nGumshoe:\nApparently he was involved in selling trade secrets between rival companies.\nMaya:\nOoh, that's pretty dirty and underhanded.\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Oh! KB Security used to head security operations against Mask\u2606DeMasque.\nMaya:\nWhat? Really?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, and after screwing up so many times... ...the company's reputation really took a nosedive.\nPhoenix:\n(So it really was Bullard who sent Ron the blackmail letter, huh...?)\nPresent\nMagatama\nMaya:\nUmm, so about this...?\nGumshoe:\nHey! Thanks, pal! How did you know I had a sore throat anyway? ...*chomp*\nMaya:\nHey! What are you doing!?\nGumshoe:\nAck! Sorry, that thing's all smooth and shiny, so I thought it was a piece of candy or something.\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe you ate the whole thing in one go...\nGumshoe:\nI almost swallowed it too, pal...\nMaya:\nOhh... My poor Magatama...\nTreasure Exhibit Poster\nGumshoe:\nI still got no idea why Mask\u2606DeMasque would go after a broken old pot like...\nMaya:\n*glare*\nGumshoe:\nAh, I mean this tasteful, old family heirloom...\nPhoenix:\nGood point. Why go after a worthless piece of junk like...\nMaya:\n*glare*\nPhoenix:\nI, um... I mean worthless in a good way I mean, this is a first for the guy... (Adrian Andrews hired Atmey as security before the calling card even came... I wonder if that has anything to do with how things played out...?)\nCamera Data or Security Camera Photo\nPhoenix:\nThe thief in the photo taken by the security camera is missing his broach...\nGumshoe:\nYup. The thing is, there's no evidence that the photo was tampered with. It was definitely taken at 12:58 AM.\nPhoenix:\n(I turned the tables at the trial today with the mystery of this missing broach. I wonder if there's something more to this missing piece of costume jewelry?)\nShichishito\nMaya:\nSo Detective Atmey wasn't hit in the back of the head after all?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right. Because he was the real thief! He wanted it to look like he was knocked out... So he bent it on purpose. I'd stake my reputation on it.\nMaya:\nGrrr... What kind of a creep would ruin an antique for that...?\nBlackmail Letter\nPhoenix:\nAbout this blackmail letter...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I've been thinking a lot about it, too, pal. Why would Kane Bullard have been blackmailing Ron DeLite anyway...?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Mr. DeLite used to work at KB Security, right? But what was it that made him quit?\nMaya:\nNick, that's it! Maybe that's the same reason he's being blackmailed!\nGumshoe:\nWell... I'm in the middle of investigating that right now.\nMaya:\nOh... Alright.\nRon's Wallet or CEO Office Key Card\nGumshoe:\nThis is proof that Ron DeLite was here at the crime scene when the murder happened.\nPhoenix:\n(His wallet... and this key card, huh...)\nMaya:\nI think we need to ask Mr. DeLite some more about those two things.\nKane's List\nMaya:\nUmm, so about this...\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What's that?\nPhoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute, Maya!\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong?\nPhoenix:\nWe copied that data without permission... Don't show it to him. He might get mad at us.\nGumshoe:\nSo? What are you whispering about?\nMaya:\nErr... Oh, it's nothing. It's just my billfold.\nGumshoe:\nThat's a pretty thick billfold you got there, pal. ...Now I really want you to show it to me.\nNewspaper Clipping\nGumshoe:\nThis was his first heist, and I guess I underestimated him. I was sure I was going to get him, so I was careless and lost the info on the witness.\nPhoenix:\nBy witness, do you mean the guard in this photo?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he and the detective worked together to try catching Mask\u2606DeMasque...\nMaya:\nBut, he got away anyway, huh?\nGumshoe:\nThat guard... I got the weird feeling that I've seen him around lately.\nMia Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nOh! That's Ms. Mia Fey! She was a truly beautiful person, pal.\nMaya:\nHuh? You knew her? You knew my sis?\nGumshoe:\nSure. Everybody in the police force knew her. ...We all lost a great friend that day... I-I just got something in my eye...! ...I'm not crying!\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nYou're such a familiar face to me now, you know? And now that I think about it, you're the real victim in this case, right? But for some strange reason, it's hard to think of you as a victim, pal.\nMaya:\nYou're darn right I'm the victim! That was our most precious treasure!\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. You know, pal... I think I know why I can't think of you as a victim, ever.\nRon DeLite profile\nGumshoe:\nI kind of feel sorry for him. He's kind of a sad young guy.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and he seems to have a habit of always getting arrested prematurely.\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's just my personal opinion, but... I think the police should've investigated the whole thing more carefully.\nMaya:\nBut weren't YOU the one that arrested him with a giant goofy smile on your face...?\nPhoenix:\nCome on, we don't have time to start with that. Let's just leave it alone.\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nI know I look a little rough around the edges. But the truth is, I'm a lot more \"detective-like\" than I used to be.\nMaya:\nReally? Like what part?\nGumshoe:\n...Like the color of my coat.\nMaya:\nAh! You're right!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, but what about what's inside the coat...?)\nMask\u2606DeMasque or Luke Atmey profile\nGumshoe:\nI always knew there was something suspicious about this guy! And I was right! It turned out that DeMasque was really that \"Ace Detective\" in disguise!\nMaya:\nYou really thought that?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Of course! It's the stone-cold truth! Sooner or later, a guy like that always shows his true colors...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well I think we saw a little too much of his colors today...\nGumshoe:\nYeah... I gotta agree with you on that one.\nGodot profile\nGumshoe:\nThe guy is a real puzzle, if you ask me. Then maybe I should be asking you! Do YOU know something about him?\nPhoenix:\nWhy would I know something?\nGumshoe:\nWell, it sure sounded like you two each other from the way you acted today.\nMaya:\nIt's Mr. Godot that acts like he knows Nick, not the other way around.\nPhoenix:\n(Exactly. You'd think I'd remember someone like him...)\nGumshoe:\nI still say the whole thing's a bit suspect.\nKane Bullard profile\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe! Tell us more about Mr. Shane Bluebard!\nGumshoe:\nThat's \"Kane Bullard\", not \"Shane Bluebard\", pal.\nMaya:\nOh yeah... The victim in this case just doesn't make much of an impression on me.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you were the victim up until Mr. Bullard was found dead.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, and his body wasn't discovered until this morning.\nPhoenix:\nAnyway, we don't have enough information yet. Can you help us out?\nGumshoe:\nSorry... I'm actually a little confused myself. For some reason, I'm just blabbing like an idiot right now...\nMaya:\nOK, Nick! Now is our chance to get more info about the victim, so hurry up and ask!\nAny other evidence\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe... About this right here...\nGumshoe:\nSorry... It's hard to believe, but there's a limit to how much my brain can hold. I got two ears and two eyes, but I only got one brain.\nPhoenix:\n(I can see your eyes and the years... ...but the jury is still out on the brain thing...)\nMaya:\nHey, Nick, if you have something to say, just come out and say it.\nAny other profile\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe. What about this person?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal... To be honest, my head is so full right now it feels like it's gonna burst.\nPhoenix:\n(Note to self: Keep hair away from Gumshoe's head.)\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nKane Bullard profile\nMaya:\nHe's the victim in this case. \"Lame Blowhard\"...\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's \"Kane Bullard\"!\nMaya:\nI know, but he looks so ugly!\nPhoenix:\nWell, why don't you remember at least the \"Bull\" part of his name and riff off of that?\nMaya:\n...Now that you mention it, I guess he does kinda look like an ugly old bull.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... We still don't know very much about this victim.)\nMaya:\nSo, he's the one who sent the blackmail letter to Mr. DeLite, right?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks that way. (But we still need to look into this guy some more.)\nDeMasque's Hideout\nPresent\nKane Bullard profile\nDesir\u00e9e:\nOh, I know him... This is Ronnie's boss, the CEO guy.\nPhoenix:\nWell, now he's an ex-boss. Someone killed him last night.\nDesir\u00e9e:\nNaturally, I know that. He was a pretty sly man, let me tell you.\nMaya:\nOh really...?\nDesir\u00e9e:\nYou bet he was. He made Ronnie \"Chief\" of one of the security teams. But that was just so he could work him like a slave.\nMaya:\nDid Mr. DeLite ever have a problem with Mr. Bullard himself?\nPhoenix:\n(Even if he did, you think she'd ever tell you about it...?)\nDesir\u00e9e:\nWell Ronnie isn't the type to complain about that kind of thing. I tried to get him to talk to me about work, but he never would.\nOctober 13KB SecuritySecurity Guard Office\nPhoenix:\nWow... This is really something else.\nMaya:\nFor a security guard office, it sure doesn't feel very secure.\nPhoenix:\n(\"KB Security Guard\"...! Uh oh, I just remembered... Larry might be...)\nButz:\nHey, Nick! Wassup!\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh! So he IS here...)\nButz:\nYo! How's it hanging, dude? And you got my sweet little Maya with you, too!\nMaya:\nHi, Larry!\nButz:\nHere I was working my fingers to the bone... And in walks an angel! I've got no problems with a daytime date. It's all good!\nPhoenix:\nNo, that's not what we're here for. We're investigating the Bullard murder case.\nButz:\n...Huh? Oh yeah! That's right! You're a lawyer, aren't you?\nPhoenix:\n(He's so hopelessly clueless.)\nButz:\nWell, if it's about the murder case, boy have I got some good info for you!\nMaya:\nReally!? What is it!?\nButz:\nHmm... Well, I don't mind sharing with my sweet little Maya. But Nick here is a different story!\nMaya:\nBut Larry, I thought you two were old school buddies...\nButz:\nThat was then and this is now.\nExamine\nDesk on left\nButz:\nThat's my partner's seat.\nPhoenix:\nYour... partner?\nButz:\nWell, that's what I call her. She's my superior, actually. ...Kind of a weird old lady.\nMaya:\nUmm... There's tea spilled all over that machine, you know!\nButz:\nOh, don't worry about it. Just the other day, I spilled some chocolate milk on mine. It still works fine, more or less. They really know how to build them, I guess.\nPoster on wall\nPhoenix:\nSomething is written on this poster in fine print.\nMaya:\n\"A Guard's 5 Commandments\" ...Wow, this sounds serious. Let's see what it says... #1: Obey thy superior #2: Respect thy superior #3: Smile at thy superior #4: Salute thy superior #5: Buy donuts for thy superior upon command It's signed, \"Wendy Oldbag, Head Supervisor\".\nButz:\nShe's one tough old bird, let me tell you. Cross her and you come face-to-face with her real, genuine ray gun!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, sounds scary alright.\nButz:\nWell, fortunately she's on vacation. That's why I'm so relaxed right now.\nJacket\nPhoenix:\n...Hey, Larry. That's your jacket, isn't it?\nButz:\nThat's right.\nMaya:\nUmm... Did you know you hung it right on top of some kind of lever?\nButz:\nYeah, sure. I was told to never, ever, touch that lever. She scowled and huffed at me, \"Something terrible will happen if you do! Got it, greenhorn?\"\nMaya:\n...So why hang your jacket on such an important lever?\nButz:\nBecause it got me curious. If the jacket's weight pulls the lever down, that's what they call an \"accident\". Doesn't the suspense just kill you? Don't you want to know what'll happen? Huh?\nMaya:\nIt's true... It's killing me, too! What about you, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but for a different reason...\nWall next to screens\nMaya:\nWow! Take a look at these things here! Hey! Hey, Larry! What are they!?\nButz:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nDid you say, \"Hmm\"?\nButz:\nHey, man. It's not like I have to know what they are to do my job. I... I always thought they were just some kind of decoration or something.\nMaya:\nOh boy...\nPhoenix:\n(How did this guy ever get a job here anyway...?)\nScreens\nButz:\nThose screens there show what's going on all over the building. Everywhere. And it's my job to keep a steady eye on them. All of them.\nPhoenix:\nI wouldn't sound so smug if I were you.\nMaya:\nCan you watch regular TV on these, too?\nPhoenix:\n(If anyone would sit here and watch TV instead of working, it's Larry.)\nButz:\nHey, Maya, I'm a pro. OK? Besides, you can't get regular TV on it.\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know that, Larry?\nButz:\nBecause that was my first bit of investigation, if you know what I mean. ... I know what you're thinking! It was a professional investigation, alright!?\nChair on right\nButz:\nThat's my workstation. Pretty cool, huh? I keep a steady eye on the monitors and use that mic for communicating.\nMaya:\nLook at all this equipment. It must be hard to operate.\nButz:\nNo biggie. I think there's an instruction manual somewhere in this room.\nMaya:\n\"Somewhere\"...?\nPhoenix:\n\"Instruction manual\"...? What are you going to do in an emergency?\nButz:\nWell, I guess I'd start by calmly looking for the instruction manual. During that time, my partner, the old lady, would calmly look for her reading glasses. That's what us security professionals call \"teamwork\".\nPhoenix:\n(Even Maya and Pearls could run this place better.)\nMaya:\nHey! What's that supposed to mean!\nTalk\nGood info\nPhoenix:\nSo what's this \"good info\" you were talking about, Larry?\nButz:\nHey! I'm a guard! A pro! I can't just give away information for free!\nPhoenix:\n(He wants a bribe? I thought professionals were more, I don't know... HONEST!?) ...Can you talk to him, Maya?\nMaya:\nLarry! Tell us already! What's the \"good info\"!?\nButz:\nHey, I like that! This kitten has got some claws! OK, you really want to know?\nMaya:\nYes, yes! So tell me!\nButz:\nOK. So the thing is... Ron DeLite was an employee here. And naturally since I'm a pro, I looked into his background. Follow me?\nMaya:\nYes, you're a pro! I follow you! Go on!\nButz:\nWell one year ago, Ron DeLite was fired! And there was no warning at all! It just happened all of a sudden! I know this is a small company, but I think that was pretty awful.\nMaya:\nI guess he must have done something bad to have gotten fired like that.\nButz:\nLike maybe skipping out of work to go pick up hot chicks or something...\nPhoenix:\n(No, that's just you...)\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nSo what is it like to be a part-time security guard?\nButz:\nLemme tell you, it's tough. Well, you know me... I get by alright, I guess. First, I have to keep my eye on those monitors. All the time.\nMaya:\nMonitors?\nButz:\nThere are security cameras set in each room around the building. It's really hard! Sometimes I feel like my eyes are gonna fell out!\nMaya:\nOh...\nButz:\nAnd if I see something suspicious, I have to contact one of the teams.\nMaya:\nWhat \"teams\"?\nButz:\nThe security teams for this company. They're supposedly the best in the business. But I'm no amateur either, so if it's something small, I don't bother calling them.\nPhoenix:\n(So in other words, you basically watch TV screens all day long...)\nThe night of the crime\nPhoenix:\nYou were in this office when the murder took place, weren't you?\nButz:\nWh-Why do you say that? This is just a part-time job for me! And I can't operate the equipment! And I'm dumb!\nPhoenix:\nEven if it is part-time and you are dumb, you're still in charge of security here!\nButz:\nHey gimme a break! Don't try to pin the whole thing on me! That's not fair, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nMaya:\nI don't think you can expect someone like him to take any responsibility.\nPhoenix:\nAnyway, the point is you were here that night, right?\nButz:\n...\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(Oh no, I knew something smelled bad, and it was the Butz after all...)\nButz:\nWell, it's like I always say. That was then and this is now. OK?\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I'm going to have to break his Psyche-Locks after all.) (Changed from [It looks like I'm going to have to break his Psyche-Lock after all.] in the original release)\nThe night of the crime (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Locks)\nMaya:\nLarry, I want you to tell me about the night of the murder.\nButz:\nAw, man. Why do we have to talk about that?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nButz:\nWh-Why don't we talk about what we're gonna do tonight instead, Maya!?\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I won't get anywhere if I can't break these Psyche-Locks... (Changed from [Argh... I won't get anywhere if I can't break this Psyche-Lock...] in the original release) I think I have to present Maya's Magatama to get the ball rolling here...)\nThe night of the crime (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nButz:\nOooh... I knew it...! It's all my fault! It's my fault that the Boss was killed! My fault!!\nMaya:\nLarry...\nButz:\nThere was nothing I could do! I have important issues to deal with too, man!\nPhoenix:\nWhat happened that night anyway?\nButz:\nAaah... My Donna happened.\nMaya:\nHuh? Your Donna?\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nButz:\nYeah, my Donna called and said, \"I have to talk to you right away...\" So I went to see her and... he was standing right there next to her!\nMaya:\nUm, who was?\nButz:\nHer new boyfriend! It was like some horrible joke! Before I knew what was going on, the guy socked me right in the kisser! Normally I'm the one that does the punching! Isn't that right, Maya!?\nMaya:\nY-Yeah...\nPhoenix:\nS-So is that why you left the security guard office?\nButz:\nWAAAAAAH!! I'M SORRRRY! It-It-It's all my faaaaault! H-How can I ever make up for it, Nick!? What can I do!? Whaaat!? Wah haa waa...\nMaya:\nHe's curled up on the floor, crying like a baby.\nPhoenix:\nOh boy...\nButz:\n...Nick! Is there anything I can do!? Anything! Just name it! I'll do whatever I have to do to make up for it! I swear I will!\nPhoenix:\nLarry...\nMaya:\nHey Nick, as long as he's offering, why don't you show him the evidence we've got?\nPhoenix:\n(She's right. Maybe we'll get at least one bit of useful information from him...)\nButz:\nNiiiiiick...\nEmergency buzzer (appears after breaking Psyche-Locks, clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option, and presenting CEO Office Buzzer)\nMaya:\nUmm, I accidentally pressed the buzzer earlier...\nButz:\nYeah, I heard it. So that was you, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYou're a security guard, aren't you? Why didn't you come to the CEO's office!?\nButz:\nWell, this is the 3rd floor of the basement. The CEO's office is on the 1st floor... I thought it would be a good idea to, um... adopt a wait and see approach. Plus, there's a police detective here, right!? I just didn't think it was necessary!\nPhoenix:\n(It's as if he's trying to win an award for the laziest person on the planet...)\nMaya:\nUmm... Let's get back to talking about the night of the murder, OK? Is it true that the buzzer didn't go off that night?\nPhoenix:\nThere must be a record, right? You must have had a look at it, right?\nButz:\nOf course I did! And I couldn't possibly have made a mistake either!\nMaya:\nDo you think you could take just one more look for me? Pretty please?\nButz:\nOh, OK... I just can't say no to you, Maya.\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nHe's probably right... I don't think even Larry could make a mistake like that...\nButz:\nWAAAAAAAAAAH!!\nMaya:\nWh-What is it? What's wrong?\nButz:\nI-I made a mistake!\nMaya:\nHuh? B-But how...?\nButz:\nIt can't be... It's impossible!\nPhoenix:\nOK, enough already! What about the records?\nButz:\nThat night... It went off just once... In the morning... At around 1 AM...\nMaya:\n1 AM...? Th-That's when the m-murder happened!\nButz:\nR-Really? Are you serious!? That's terrible! It can't be!\nBuzzer Record added to the Court Record.\nEmergency buzzer (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nUmm, I accidentally pressed the buzzer earlier...\nButz:\nYeah, I heard it.

I don't think even Larry could make a mistake like that...\nButz:\nWAAAAAAAAAAH!!\nMaya:\nWh-What is it? What's wrong?\nButz:\nI-I made a mistake!\nMaya:\nHuh? B-But how...?\nButz:\nIt can't be... It's impossible!\nPhoenix:\nOK, enough already! What about the records?\nButz:\nThat night... It went off just once... In the morning... At around 1 AM...\nMaya:\n1 AM...? Th-That's when the m-murder happened!\nButz:\nR-Really? Are you serious!? That's terrible! It can't be!\nPresent\nMagatama (after clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option, before breaking Psyche-Locks)\nPhoenix:\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- The Night of the Crime --\nPhoenix:\nOn the night of the crime, were you working hard like you were supposed to?\nButz:\nWhat? Huh? Of-Of-Of Of course I was! Why wouldn't I have been?\nPhoenix:\nBut didn't you sneak out of work just yesterday to go see Ms. DeLite?\nButz:\nAh...! B-But that was that... and-and this is this!\nPhoenix:\nIs there any chance that you snuck out of work last night, too...?\nButz:\nNever! I didn't sneak out! I tell you what! I'll even bet you a dollar!\nPhoenix:\n(A dollar, wow! Now that's confidence!)\nButz:\nWhat's with that drenched in the rain puppy look on your face!? Do you have evidence that I left my position or are you just pulling my chain!?\nPhoenix:\n(The evidence that Larry was not manning his station when the murder happened is...)\nPresent Ron's Wallet\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This wallet... You know about this, right?\"\nPresent CEO Office Key Card\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis is the key card to the CEO's office, right?\nButz:\nY-Yeah, that's right.\nPhoenix:\nThis key card was found inside a wallet.\nLeads to:\n\"This wallet... You know about this, right?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nButz:\nWhew... I was scared for a minute...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmmm... Larry seems pretty relieved...)\nButz:\nBut I tell you I'm not relieved! I'll even bet you 70 cents!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm going to break this Psyche-Lock if it's the last thing I do!)\nButz:\nWhat's with that baby who had his favorite toy taken away from him look on your face?\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have evidence that I left my position or are you just pulling my chain!?\"\nPhoenix:\nThis wallet... You know about this, right?\nButz:\nI've never seen it before.\nPhoenix:\nLiar! You hand delivered this wallet to Ms. DeLite just yesterday!\nButz:\nGimme a break! You can't just expect me to remember every little thing that happens!\nPhoenix:\nWell, I do expect you to remember something that happened just yesterday!\nPhoenix:\nWhat time was it when you found this last night?\nButz:\nI guess it was around 1:00 in the morning on the first floor of our company building.\nButz:\nOne o'clock... In the morning...? (Changed from [1 o'clock... In the morning...?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. In other words, Larry... At the time the of the murder, you were away from the security guard office!\nButz:\nAAAAAAAAH!!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nButz:\nY-Y-Yeah, b-b-but! th-there's [sic] something you didn't think about!\nPhoenix:\nWhat's that?\nButz:\nMy shift that day didn't start until 10:00 PM! The murderer might have snuck in before then!\nPhoenix:\n...What do you mean by that?\nButz:\nIf the murderer had snuck in before 10:00 PM... ...then it wasn't my fault! It was the fault of the guy whose shift was before mine!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I have the feeling that he still doesn't get the seriousness of this...?) Listen up, Larry. We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that... the killer \"snuck\" into the CEO's office after 10:00 PM, during your shift!\nPresent CEO Office Key Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Larry... When you use this key card, does it leave a record?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nButz:\nWhew... Boy, you really had me scared!\nPhoenix:\n(I've never seen anyone look so relieved in my whole life...)\nButz:\nWhat's with that little lamb that can't get to sleep look on your face?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I'm gonna have to rattle his cage a little bit more...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Listen up, Larry.\"\nPhoenix:\nLarry... When you use this key card, does it leave a record?\nButz:\nYeah, it does. But I can't show the record to just anyone you know...\nPhoenix:\nThat key card data was already made public in the trial today.\nButz:\nWhat!? I didn't know that! Any kind of request for info like that is supposed to go through me!\nPhoenix:\n(Boy does that sound a bit arrogant coming from a part time guard...) Anyway, according to the data, the door to the CEO's office was opened with this card... Furthermore, it was most definitely used at 1 AM, the time of the murder!\nButz:\nNo way!\nPhoenix:\nYes, someone used this to get into the CEO's office. That happened at 1 AM on the night of the crime. Right in the middle of your shift!\nButz:\nOoooh...\nPhoenix:\nLarry, you can't duck your responsibility this time!\nButz:\nGYYYYYAAAAAAR!

I told you. I'm a pro. And you don't interrupt a pro when he's working. I don't have time to sit and chat with you, alright?\nMaya:\nOh, is that right...?\nButz:\nOh! Heh heh, naturally I've got time for YOU though, Maya!\nPhoenix:\n(We're gonna have to squeeze this guy if we want to get more info out of him, huh?)\nAttorney's Badge (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\nButz:\nThat's not necessary, Nick. You don't have to threaten me. I'll tell you what I know. I know it's tough to tell, but I'm really sorry about what happened...\nPhoenix:\nWow, I've never seen Larry look so serious. I actually believe him...\nMaya:\nYeah... He's like a totally different person...\nButz:\nIn that case, maybe you and I should get reacquainted.\nTreasure Exhibit Poster, Ami Fey's Golden Statue or Shichishito (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\nPhoenix:\nThis is one of Kurain's greatest treasures.\nButz:\nI used to have zero interest in all of this old, junky stuff... But, now that I'm a new person, well... I can kinda see the appeal. Hey! I got it!

Listen carefully, OK, Nick? I know you don't think much of me as a person... But I'm no thief. And I would never wear a goofy getup like that!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Nobody ever accused you of being a thief.\nButz:\nIt's too much work for me. Making plans, writing calling cards, etc., etc... I'd rather just pull a dine and dash at a burger joint.\nMaya:\nBurgers!? I love burgers, too!\nButz:\nReally? Well, how about it? Wanna go on a burger date tonight?\nPhoenix:\n...At least pay for the food, because I'm not defending you again.\nBlackmail Letter (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\nMaya:\nUmm, so what about for this...?\nButz:\nHuh!? Maya, you shouldn't have! A love letter for me!?\nMaya:\nUh, no. Sorry. This is a blackmail letter.\nButz:\nWhaaaaat!? How do you know about that, Maya!?\nMaya:\nHuh?\nButz:\nHow much is Alexis demanding this time!?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Who is this \"Alexis\"?\nMaya:\nDidn't we show him this letter yesterday, too? I'm pretty sure we did...\nRon's Wallet (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\nButz:\nAh! That's the wallet I found!\nMaya:\nYou found it when you snuck out of work to get socked in the kisser, right?\nButz:\n...I didn't \"sneak out of work to get socked in the kisser\". If only I had been more responsible at work... I might have spotted the murderer on the monitor like I was supposed to...\nMaya:\nLarry... You really do feel bad, don't you?\nButz:\nYeah, well... Maybe it's all for the best. ...I think it's brought Dessie and I closer together. Just like they say, \"Every cloud has a silver lining\". \"You gotta see that old water glass as half-full\", Am I right...?\nPhoenix:\n...

Half-full!\nCEO Office Key Card (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\nPhoenix:\nSo was this the card that was used by the culprit that night...?\nButz:\nWell, going off the serial number, then yeah.

Press the buzzer in your heart! I promise I'll come running to your rescue, like the professional guard I am!\nMaya:\nWow... That was pretty good.\nButz:\nHeh heh, thanks.

Even when you grow up, you gotta keep the part of your heart that's still pure...\nMaya:\nYou're so right about that!\nPhoenix:\nI'm impressed that you can still think like that, Larry. After all, you went through some pretty tough times as a kid...\nButz:\nHuh? I did?\nPhoenix:\n(Something tells me it's more about self-induced amnesia than having a pure heart...)\nDick Gumshoe profile (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\nButz:\nOh, this guy? The detective? He was here before, drilling me with a ton of questions.\nMaya:\nReally? Like, what did he ask?\nButz:\nUm, let's see... I can't remember.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nButz:\nWell, you know... just a bunch of boring stuff.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Detective Gumshoe...)\nAdrian Andrews profile (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\nButz:\nWHOA! WHO is this! Come on, man, don't hold out on me!\nPhoenix:\nForget about it. You don't need to know and I'm not telling you.\nButz:\nHey now! I thought we were pals! I got a MAJOR thing for girls with black sleeveless shirts and glasses!\nPhoenix:\nHow do you know that!?\nButz:\nAnd if they have an orange-colored memo pad, I really lose my cool!\nPhoenix:\n(He has to be making that up... He can't really know Adrian... Can he...?)\nLarry Butz profile (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\nButz:\nI'm 25 now. It's about time I started giving some serious thought to my life.\nPhoenix:\nGood! That's the way you be! ...What exactly are you thinking about, though?\nButz:\nWell, you know... My future, my dreams...\nMaya:\nLarry, when exactly does this \"future\" of yours start?\nButz:\nA man's life begins at 30! ...That's my theory anyway. I figure I got another 5 years of guilt-free screw-ups before I have to buckle down.\nPhoenix:\nLarry, I think... Forget it. We're just gonna have to have a nice long talk next time...\nKane Bullard profile (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\nButz:\nThe CEO of our company. He was a pretty good guy.\nMaya:\nHuh? Really?\nButz:\nYeah, you bet! You know how I'm not very good about working hard, right?\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah, I kinda noticed...\nButz:\nWell, guess what the boss said to me about that? \"I don't expect much work from you, Larry. In return, just don't expect much pay.\"\nMaya:\nI see...\nButz:\nI guess he had to follow some kind of dumb law about having security here in the building.\nPhoenix:\n(So, in order to pay the lowest wage possible, he went to the bottom of the barrel.)\nButz:\nTo be honest, I really looked up to the boss. If I ever grow up to be a CEO, I wanna be just like him! And don't worry, Nick! I promise I'll hire you for security!\nAny other evidence (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\nButz:\nUmm... I think you know how much I want to help you guy, but... I really don't know what to say about it.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt's just that he seems so... I don't know... \"pleasant\".\nAny other profile (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option)\nButz:\nI'm really sorry, Nick! I swear I want to change my ways.

M-Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nMr. DeLite... Did they finish their interrogation?\nRon:\nYes, but...! P-Please don't leave me alone anymoooooore!\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. DeLite, you lied to us before, didn't you?\nRon:\nW-Well... Err, you see...\nPhoenix:\nOn the same night the Sacred Urn was stolen from Lordly Tailor Department Store... ...a blackmail letter you got summoned you to KB Security to hand over some money. And then, that's where the CEO, Kane Bullard, was murdered. But... there's only one Ron DeLite, am I right? So the only question is... Where were you that night? This time I want to hear the whole truth... Your life depends on it.\nRon:\nO-OK...\nExamine\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He looks pretty nervous... ...standing near someone who went from thief to murderer overnight.\nTalk\nMask\u2606DeMasque (disappears after \"Blackmail letter\")\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite, do you still insist that you are Mask\u2606DeMasque...?\nRon:\nIsn't that what I've been saying since yesterday?\nMaya:\nThat was a quick response...\nPhoenix:\nTell me about it. To be honest, it's starting to get irritating.\nMaya:\nB-But listen, Mr. DeLite! At the trial today, we learned the true identity of the thief, didn't we!?\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...\nRon:\nI guess it's true... I wasn't the one who stole that urn...\nMaya:\nOf course not. After all, you were at KB Security at the time.\nPhoenix:\nSo then the person dressed up as Mask\u2606DeMasque in this photo...\nMaya:\n...It's gotta be Detective Atmey.\nThe night of the crime\nPhoenix:\nSo that night, you didn't go to Lordly Tailor, you went to KB Security, right?\nRon:\nYes... I went to KB Security at the time the blackmail note said I should.\nMaya:\nAlright... What happened next?\nRon:\nWell, I used to work there, so I knew where the CEO's office was. I knocked... but there was no answer. So then I used the key card to unlock the door.\nPhoenix:\n(That's probably when he dropped his wallet...)\nRon:\nWhen I went into the CEO's office... someone was in there.\nPhoenix:\n\"Someone\"...?\nRon:\nThen suddenly they bashed me over the head! Bam!\nMaya:\nWas it Kane Bullard that hit you...?\nRon:\nI don't know. The person ran away while I was still stunned. When I came to my senses, the sight I saw left me speechless. The dead body of the CEO was right there in front of me! I thought I'd die myself! Anyway, I thought I should do something with the body...\nPhoenix:\nSo that's why you put it in the safe...?\nRon:\n...Yes, that's right. I used to be the chief of one of the security teams, so I knew how to open it.\nMaya:\nOK... And what did you do after that?\nRon:\nWell, I got out of there, for starters! I was the one who set up the security cameras in that building... ...so I knew how to avoid being spotted by them!\nMaya:\nNick... All of a sudden, Mr. DeLite kinda sounds like the murderer to me...\nPhoenix:\n(Please don't say that...)\nWhy you were fired\nMaya:\nMr. DeLite, is it true that one year ago... ...you were forced to quit KB Security?\nRon:\nAh! H-How did you...!? I-I'm begging you! Please don't tell Dessie! Pleeeease!\nMaya:\nD-Don't worry. We haven't told anyone yet...\nRon:\nWhew! Thank goodness... Err, no... I umm... But I suppose I'll have to tell her sometime... She'll find out eventually\nMaya:\nWhy have you been hiding it from her anyway?\nRon:\nDessie would despise me if she ever found out I was living a life of crime. A criminal, a thief... She'd never forgive me! My marriage would be over!\nMaya:\nKnowing that, why did you become a thief in the first place?\nRon:\nBecause Dessie spends money like it's water. There's no job in the world that could bring in enough money... Except being a thief. At least, that's what I thought anyway.\nPhoenix:\n(So he became Mask\u2606DeMasque for Desir\u00e9e, huh...?)\nBlackmail letter (appears after presenting Newspaper Clipping)\nMaya:\nThis blackmail letter... Is this the first one you got?\nRon:\nNo, of course not! But this is the first one that ever called me out to a specific location.\nPhoenix:\nSo, did you start receiving blackmail letters after this incident...?\nRon:\nYes. Just a few days after the \"Tear of Emanon\" heist... That first letter... It said, \"I know you did it\".\nMaya:\nSo someone found out about your true identity? Just like that?\nRon:\nAh, it's not easy being a master thief, you know! \"I've got proof that it was you, so give up!\" it went on to say. So in the end, I had to give up the treasure I went through all that trouble to steal...\nPhoenix:\nIs that right... Hey! Hang on a second! What do you mean you had to \"give it up\"?\nRon:\nOh, don't worry. After I put the jewel in the safe-deposit box the letter specified... ...someone sent me $10,000!\nPhoenix:\n(No one said anything about me being worried, you know...)\nRon:\nAfter that, I started getting the plans in the mail.\nMaya:\nP-Plans...?\nHeist plans (appears after \"Blackmail letter\")\nMaya:\nWhat are these \"plans\" you're talking about?\nRon:\nThey were instructions on how to steal a crown or painting or some other rare treasure. They showed security blind spots, escape routes and even suggested training methods.\nMaya:\nSo you mean that the one who planned the heists wasn't you...?\nRon:\nNo, it wasn't. I only planned the very first one. After that, I received plans from some very kind person! Incredibly detailed plans!\nMaya:\nIt sounds like Mr. DeLite is thankful to the person that was blackmailing him.\nPhoenix:\n(So Ron DeLite was Mask\u2606DeMasque after all...? But... Someone else is behind the thefts. Someone who planned it all out in detail!)\nRon:\nAll I had to do was deposit the treasures I stole into the safe-deposit box. Then I just waited for the cash to come in the mail.\nPhoenix:\n(Could you try not to look so gleeful about it...?)\nMaya:\nSo you went after the Sacred Urn because of one of those plans, too?\nRon:\nWell, see... truth is, I've never seen the urn. All I did was follow the instructions and steal what I was told to steal.\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... Is everything you've just told me the truth?\nRon:\nYes... B-But please don't tell Dessie. OK?\nRon's Testimony added to the Court Record.\nHeist plans (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nWhat are these \"plans\" you're talking about?\nRon:\nThey were instructions on how to steal a crown or painting or some other rare treasure. They showed security blind spots, escape routes and even suggested training methods.\nMaya:\nSo you mean that the one who planned the heists wasn't you...?\nRon:\nNo, it wasn't.

OK?\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster\nRon:\nThat's kind of strange...\nMaya:\nWhat is?\nRon:\nUp until now, Mask\u2606DeMasque has gone after famous works of art or treasures. Why did he suddenly decide to steal this plain-looking urn that nobody would want?\nPhoenix:\nYou make it sound like you had nothing to do with the theft.\nRon:\nWell... It wasn't me that chose to steal this urn.\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nPhoenix:\nThis calling card... Did you send this?\nRon:\nNo...! Err, that is... I don't know anything about that. I mean, I had other plans for that night already...\nPhoenix:\n(That's true... He did get that blackmail letter, after all...)\nMaya:\nWhat about Detective Atmey...? Could he be the one that sent it?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks that way. I can't think of anyone else.\nRon:\nYeah... That night, because of the letter, I had no choice but to go to KB Security.\nAmi Fey's Golden Statue or Shichishito\nRon:\nWow, this is cool! I'm really into this kind of stuff.\nMaya:\nOh yeah? It's one of our most valuable treasures!\nRon:\nIf I ever get out of here, me and Dessie will go to Lordly Tailor... ...to check out the whole Treasures of Kurain Exhibit!\nMaya:\nUm, OK, I guess... Just promise me you won't steal anything, OK?\nRon:\nOh don't worry! We'd going when I'm not on the job as Mask\u2606DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, that's reassuring...)\nSecurity Camera Photo\nMaya:\nThis photo... This has got to be the real Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nRon:\nI'm sure it is. I know Mask\u2606DeMasque when I see him.\nPhoenix:\nYes, but... This isn't you, right Mr. DeLite?\nRon:\nWell, err... No... I was at KB Security then.\nMaya:\nSo then... I guess it really is Detective Atmey, after all.\nBlackmail Letter\nMaya:\nSo was this blackmail letter written by KB Security's CEO, Kane Bullard?\nRon:\nI-I think so... Probably. You can only get into the CEO's office if you have a key card.\nPhoenix:\n(And the blackmail letter said to meet at KB Security...) (Changed from [The blackmail letter said to meet at KB Security...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nThen no one else other than Mr. Bullard could've have written the letter...\nRon's Wallet\nRon:\nI was at KB Security at around 1 o'clock that night... I took out my wallet to open the door with the key card...\nPhoenix:\nSo is that when you dropped it?\nRon:\nI-I'm so sorry... I should have told you the truth earlier.\nCEO Office Key Card\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you still doing with this key card anyway? Didn't you return it when you left your job at KB Security?\nRon:\nOf course I returned it! Don't be silly! Umm... But it got sent back to me along with the blackmail letter.\nMaya:\nWith the blackmail letter...?\nRon:\nYes, it said... \"Use this to enter the CEO's office\".\nPublicity Photo\nRon:\nOh! I didn't know Mask\u2606DeMasque had become so famous!\nMaya:\nYeah, I actually bought this publicity photo!\nRon:\nReally? Well, I'd be happy to sign it if you like! I'll even add, \"Behind Bars!\"\nMaya:\nYes! Please! Please!\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like Ron had totally forgotten about what happened at the trial today... That he was declared \"not guilty\" of being Mask\u2606DeMasque...)\nKane's List\nPhoenix:\nThis list... We found it in the office of the CEO, Mr. Bullard.\nRon:\nHey! This is a list of all the things Mask\u2606DeMasque stole!\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's the value of each item listed next to them. \"100,000 dollars\"... \"150,000 dollars\"...\nMaya:\nAre you sure that's the value of the stolen items?\nRon:\nHmm... The numbers seem a little low to me. Even on the black market, the prices should be at least three times higher than that.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he knows about that stuff because he used to be a security guard...)\nCEO Office Buzzer\nRon:\nThat's the emergency buzzer from the CEO's office. Don't press it! It makes a terrible racket!\nMaya:\nHee hee. Sorry. I just love making a lot of noise.\nRon:\nErr, umm... Does this buzzer have something to do with this case?\nPhoenix:\nWell, at this point, I don't really know yet. (After all, there were no prints on it, or anything else for that matter.)\nNewspaper Clipping\nRon:\nHey! This is an article about my debut heist! Boy, that was a tough one. Before I knew it, they were hot on my trail.\nMaya:\nBut Mask\u2606DeMasque... He must have gotten away, right? It says in the article that he \"disappeared\"...\nRon:\nThat's right! I got a sudden burst of inspiration! I hid my Mask\u2606DeMasque costume in a nearby plastic bucket... Then I quickly changed into my security guard uniform. ...Pretty clever, eh?\nMaya:\nWow... Awesome! ...Hey, hold the phone! The guard in this photo... Is that you, Mr. DeLite?\nRon:\nHee hee. That's right. Nice trick if I do say so myself!\nPhoenix:\n(Nice and easy to figure out! Even Pearls could see through that in a heartbeat.)\nNewspaper Clipping updated in the Court Record.\nRon:\nBut as you might expect, Detective Atmey found the disguise... He truly deserves the title of \"Ace Detective\".\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey found the Mask\u2606DeMasque disguise? (Hmm, that's interesting...)\nRon:\nYes, and I heard that he brought it home with him.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's it... That's when Atmey got his hands on this.)\nRon:\nThanks to that, I got the chance to remake my costume.\nMaya:\nThat must have been really time-consuming, huh?\nRon:\nYes, it took quite a while to complete. Anyway, a few days after that... I received the first of the blackmail letters...\nMaya:\nB-Blackmail letters!?\nPhoenix:\nY-You got them starting WHEN!? Tell me more! Now!

Th-That's scary!\nPhoenix:\nDo you know anything about that, Mr. DeLite?\nRon:\n...Sorry, I'm afraid I don't.\nPhoenix:\n(Why am I not surprised by how clueless he is anymore...)\nRon's Testimony\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite, are you absolutely sure about this testimony? That you stole the treasures as you were directed by a series of blackmail letters...\nRon:\nYes, and I got money for them in return. It seemed like a good deal.\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't look like he's lying...)\nMaya:\nSo then how do you explain Detective Atmey's crazy confession...?\nPhoenix Wright profile\nRon:\nA great lawyer and so young! You really are an inspiration! I bet you make lots and lots of money, don't you?\nMaya:\nThat doesn't sound right coming from a thief, if you know what I mean...\nMaya Fey profile\nRon:\n... I'm sorry... I suppose you could say I'm nothing but a terrible lowlife\nMaya:\nWh-Why do you say that?\nRon:\n...This is the first time I've ever had to actually face a victim of one of my crimes.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he's talking about the Sacred Urn...)\nMaya:\nYeah, but I thought that you weren't the one who stole my urn...\nRon:\nTh-That's true about the urn, I guess... Maybe I should give up this life of crime and try becoming a professional cowbell player\nRon DeLite profile\nRon:\nI'm ashamed to admit it... ...but sometimes I wonder if I'm really cut out to be a thief.\nPhoenix:\nWell, isn't that obvious?\nMaya:\nIt doesn't suit you at all!\nRon:\nUuugh... I knew it... I guess I'm not the only one who came to that conclusion.\nDick Gumshoe profile\nRon:\nThis is the detective that was in charge of the Mask\u2606DeMasque investigations. He was so happy when I surrendered yesterday that he actually shed tears of joy.\nMaya:\nWhat? Gumshoe cried!? Really!? Was it a single manly tear or did he let loose and sob?\nRon:\nSobbed. I started weeping myself, too. It was truly infectious! A truly moving moment, if I do say so myself.\nMaya:\n...That must've been one heck of a beautiful scene.\nPhoenix:\n(If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I'm convinced that these two are blind.)\nMask\u2606DeMasque profile\nRon:\nOnce I decided to become a thief, I started studying like crazy.\nPhoenix:\nStudying!? Like what? Pretty Larceny 101? The History of Pilfering?\nRon:\nHa. No, but I watched a lot of movies and read a lot of novels about great thieves.\nMaya:\nOh yeah? I admire you for doing your homework, if for nothing else.\nRon:\nAll the great ones had their own trademarks. Flashy costumes, calling cards... ...unique laughs, and catchy slogans, like, \"Farewell, my friends!\" I figured I needed to do a good job with that if I was going to make a splash.\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess you really can't say goofy stuff like that unless you're a master thief. \"Farewell\" or \"We shall meet again\"... You know, hokey stuff like that.\nLuke Atmey profile\nRon:\nHe's an Ace Detective, alright. He's been hot on my trail ever since the first heist.\nMaya:\nYes, but... He made a pretty stunning confession in court today. \"It was me all along! I am Mask\u2606DeMasque!\"...\nRon:\nI don't know what to say... I guess he's just delusional.\nPhoenix:\n(That's exactly what your wife said about you...)\nDesir\u00e9e DeLite profile\nRon:\nDessie... She really has a thing against criminals.\nMaya:\nDo you have any idea why that is, Mr. DeLite?\nRon:\nWell... if you want to know the details, you'll have to ask her. But the thing is, after I lost my job at KB Security... I needed to earn money to keep Dessie satisfied... Lots of money. But... I just couldn't seem to find a good job. That's why I wound up becoming the thing that Dessie hates most... A thief.\nGodot profile\nRon:\nIsn't he great! I wish I could be half as cool as him! Besides, he's the only one that really believed me when I said I was the thief!\nPhoenix:\nHey, hang on a second! This is the guy that had you arrested for murder!\nRon:\nWell, I still don't think that makes him a bad person...\nPhoenix:\n(What in the world do you see in that coffee-crazed prosecutor!?)\nKane Bullard profile\nRon:\nMr. Bullard... my old boss. It's so sad...\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any idea what might have happened? Was there anyone that might have wanted him dead?\nRon:\nOh yeah, sure... Mr. Bullard was the type of guy who made lots of enemies. He did lots of threatening things to people...\nPhoenix:\nWait, wait, do you mean he scared people, or that he threaten them with blackmail?\nRon:\nWell, I guess they're kind of the same, right?\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this?\nRon:\nHmm... I don't really think I can help you with that. Err, no, that's not it... It's just that the thing is I don't really know if I can say one way or the other\nMaya:\nI didn't really catch that.\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry, you didn't miss anything.\nAfter clearing \"The night of the crime\", \"Why you were fired\", and \"Heist plans\" Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nRon, before we go, there's one more thing I want to ask you.\nRon:\nY-Yes...? B-But please don't hurt me...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kane Bullard... Do you swear that it wasn't you who killed him?\nRon:\nY-Yes, of course! I could never...! I-I'm not lying! All I did was hide his body in the safe! But then I was afraid they'd discover what I did. So I turned myself in yesterday!\nMaya:\nUm, why?\nRon:\nWell, if the judge had ruled that I was guilty of robbery, then I'd have an alibi, right?\nMaya:\nHmm... I guess so. You're really clever, Mr. DeLite.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I have no choice but to take Mr. DeLite at his word.)\n???:\nMystic Maya!\nMaya:\nHey...! Pearly!\nPearl:\nI'm back!\nPhoenix:\nHey Pearls. So what have you been up to this whole time...?\nPearl:\nThe Sacred Urn, Mr. Nick! I took it back to Kurain Village to have it examined!\nMaya:\nAnd? And? What did you find out?\nPearl:\nWell there's no need to worry! They said it's the real urn!\nMaya:\nWhew! That's a relief! I was really worried!\nPearl:\nBut there's one small problem.\nMaya:\nProblem?\nPearl:\nUm, these cute little pink splotches... They said that it's paint... And that they were put on the urn recently!\nPhoenix:\nWhy are we talking about the pink splotches again? What's the big deal?\nMaya:\nWhat's the big deal!? We've gotta find out how they got there! That's the big deal!\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! We've gotta find out how they got there!\nPhoenix:\nO-OK, OK! We'll go find out how they got there!\nRon:\nP-Please don't forget about me...\nSacred Urn refiled into the Court Record.\nOctober 13Lordly TailorBasement Warehouse\nAndrews:\nOh, Pearl.

I see.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe if we take another good look at this urn... ...we can figure out the mystery of what actually happened here...)\nMaya:\nNick! Let's look around one more time!\nExamine\nWooden box\nPhoenix:\nThis box, there's something about it that's bothering me.\nMaya:\nThat's the box that the Sacred Urn was in!\nPearl:\nIt looks like there's some pink paint on it, too...\nMaya:\nAnd it's definitely the same color as the stuff on the urn!\nPhoenix:\nI think I know how the paint got on it now...\nMaya:\nAlright!

I... know just how she feels!\nAndrews:\nIt happened about 2 weeks ago.

I can totally see how that could've happened.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, as clumsy as she is, I'm sure Maya understands...)\nAndrews:\nWell, I knew it was the most important treasure in all of Kurain Village... ...so I tried as hard as I could to fix it.

I'm in charge of the entire Treasure Exhibit!\nPhoenix:\nThe urn that was submitted before the court today... ...It's obviously not the same urn as before!\nAndrews:\nW-Well, that's... That's um... ...True! Maybe it isn't the same! It could be... It could be a fake!\nPhoenix:\n...A fake?\nAndrews:\nYou're the one who said it wasn't the same! So that's the most obvious explanation! Do you have any evidence the urn that was submitted at the trial was genuine?\nPresent Sacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Sorry to break it to you, but the urn is the genuine article.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWell, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nSee, look! It was a fake after all!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nAndrews:\nI mean, your evidence is fake too, as I expected!\nPhoenix:\n(Oops, I guess this isn't going to help me much...)\nAndrews:\nSo I have convinced you? Or...\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have any evidence the urn that was submitted at the trial was genuine?\"\nPhoenix:\nSorry to break it to you, but the urn is the genuine article. Pearls went back to Kurain Village and had it examined.\nAndrews:\nIs-Is that right? That's nice, but I don't see how...\nPhoenix:\nWhat she discovered was that the vase was broken... again.\nAndrews:\nD-Did you say... \"again\"?\nPhoenix:\nYes. It was broken once a year ago. And now it looks like the same thing has happened. And quite recently, too...\nAndrews:\nR-Recently!? Are you saying that this urn was broken recently!?\nPhoenix:\nYes. That's exactly what I'm saying.\nAndrews:\nWhy do you think it was broken recently? How do you know?\nPresent Treasure Exhibit Poster\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This poster... It was made recently, right?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nAndrews:\n... So, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nAndrews:\nWhy do you think it was broken recently again?\nPhoenix:\nUh, well... B-Because... ...Umm, I just think so.\nAndrews:\nSorry, but that's not a valid explanation.\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... The hunter has become the hunted!) W-Well it was! It was broken recently! Come on! You know it! I'm not willing to yield to you on this point!\nAndrews:\nG-Get a grip, please! ...Now. I'll ask you one more time, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"Why do you think it was broken recently? How do you know?\"\nPhoenix:\nThis poster... It was made recently, right?\nAndrews:\nPoster...? Ah! The poster for the exhibit!\nPhoenix:\nAt the time when this photo was taken, the urn said, \"I AM\" on it. But now, for some mysterious reason, it says, \"AMI\"! When the urn was fixed, the letters were transposed!\nAndrews:\nAAAAAAH!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nAndrews:\n\"I AM\"...? What does that ever mean? I don't know anything about that! I wasn't even there when the photo for this poster was taken.\nPhoenix:\nThat was a mistake. Now... Tell the truth.\nAndrews:\nAh! W-Wait!\nPhoenix:\nFor?\nAndrews:\nEv-Even if the urn was broken, I had nothing to do with it!\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nAndrews:\nY-Yes, that's it! It must have been one of the people at the photo shoot! They probably dropped it! I'm sure that's what happened!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... It looks like she's not going to give up that last Psyche-Lock so easily...) (Changed from [Hmm... It looks like I still haven't broken the entire Psyche-Lock...] in the original release)\nAndrews:\nDo you have any proof the urn was broken here at Lordly Tailor?\nPresent Urn Box\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWell, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nUmm... What is this supposed to mean?\nPhoenix:\nThis urn has these pretty little pink paint splotches on it.\nAndrews:\nNngh...\nPhoenix:\nAnd there's some on the box the urn was stored in, too! No matter how you look at it, the paint seems to be exactly the same, wouldn't you say?\nAndrews:\nS-So? What does that prove?\nPhoenix:\nThat the urn was dropped along with the box! That's when they both got paint on them. ...Are you with me so far?\nAndrews:\nY-Yes...\nPhoenix:\nThe rest of story is obvious. \"This box was dropped right here in Lordly Tailor's basement warehouse.\" ...If I can prove that, it means that the urn was broken here, too.\nAndrews:\nSo can you prove that? Can you prove that box was dropped here in the basement warehouse?\nPresent Paint Marks\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Ah...!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWell, Ms. Andrews!?\nAndrews:\nUm... Actually, I think I should be the one asking the questions.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nAndrews:\nAre you feeling ill, Mr. Wright? Have you been getting enough sleep?

I knew you'd never hurt me on purpose. What a relief...\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr, I guess that wasn't the right piece of evidence.) I-I think you're mixing up the me of a year ago and the me of today, Ms. Andrews!\nAndrews:\nWell then... Prove me wrong by coming up with the right answer!\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have any proof the urn was broken here at Lordly Tailor?\"\nAndrews:\nY-Yes...\nPhoenix:\nIf you put this box into the impression in the paint, you can see it fits perfectly.\nAndrews:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means this box was dropped right over there!

Adrian's not one of them.)\nPaint Marks (before breaking Psyche-Locks)\nPhoenix:\nMs. Andrews, about the paint that's all over the wall...\nAndrews:\nOh! Look at that! It looks like paint alright! Is-Isn't that funny!? I never noticed that before!\nMaya:\n... That has to be the most pathetic acting I have ever seen in my life.\nPearl:\nI'm beginning to get very frustrated.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh. I'd better do something to calm them down, and fast!)\nPhoenix:\nThe first time that we came down here... It was on the night that the Sacred Urn was stolen.\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Nick... There were no paint marks on the walls or floor of the warehouse when we were here.\nAndrews:\nWell, there's a good reason for that. On the day of the crime, around noon... ...that golden statue just happened to arrive from the mountain training hall.\nMaya:\nA-And?\nAndrews:\nI realized that the statue would be the perfect size for covering up the paint stains. That's why... I put it where you first saw it.\nMaya:\nI see... Now it makes perfect sense.\nPearl:\nUm, but there's still one thing I find strange...\nAndrews:\nWhat is it, Pearl?\nPearl:\nThe day after the urn was stolen, we came here again... At that time, the statue had been moved and the paint was clearly visible.\nPhoenix:\n(She's right about that...) Well, Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nHuh! What? I, err... I don't know anything about that! I placed it there to cover the paint, so why would I move it again?\nMaya:\nWell then who was it? Who would have done it and why...?\nPhoenix:\n(On the day before the theft, the statue was definitely closer to the door! Then the next day, it was moved. But why...?)\nAmi Fey's Golden Statue updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like... ...there's some connection between the Sacred Urn and the murder case.\nMaya:\nWh-Why? Why do you think so, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nBecause that night... the real thief, Ron DeLite, was at KB Security. ...So then why did another Mask\u2606DeMasque show up here? A lot of different things are pointing to one undeniable fact.\nPearl:\nOne undeniable fact...?\nPhoenix:\n(The murder trial is starting tomorrow, but... (Changed from [The murder trial is starting tomorrow...] in the original release) It looks like that thief is going to be making another appearance...)\nTo be continued.\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)\nToo many errors during Magatama session\n...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...\nPhoenix:\n(Nnrgh!

Nick!Phoenix:\nWhat is it this time?Maya:\nYou won't believe how many people are here for the trial!Phoenix:\nWell... It is a murder case.Maya:\nWhat are you talking about? They're here for the trial next door!Phoenix:\n\"Next door\"...?Maya:\nWhy don't you know this, Nick? *sigh* They're having Detective Atmey's trial today!Phoenix:\nDetective Atmey...?Maya:\nThey say they're going to try him as Mask\u2606DeMasque.Phoenix:\nAlready? That was fast...Maya:\nBoy, I'd love to see Mask\u2606DeMasque's trial.???:\n...I know...Phoenix:\nBy the way, where's Pearls?Maya:\nOh, she went back home. She said she can't neglect her training anymore.???:\n...I know you don't like me...Phoenix:\nPearls has really gotten into her training lately, huh?Maya:\nYeah... Ever since... ...that incident last year.Ron:\nPleeeeease! Don't ignore meeee!Maya:\n...Oh, Mr. DeLite! Good morning!Ron:\nNo one likes me... No one would notice me, even if I killed someone...Maya:\nCome on, don't be silly! ... W-Wait a sec!Phoenix:\nYou don't mean... You're the murderer...!?Ron:\nN-N-N-No, no! I'm just a poor thief! ... No, wait, that's not right. A thief can't really be \"poor\"Phoenix:\n(Now, let's see... According to Mr. DeLite... From his second crime on, he was following a bunch of set plans. Plans that someone had been sending to him to \"help\" him commit the heists.)Maya:\nDo you think there's a connection between the thief and the murder, Nick?Phoenix:\nIt's possible... But today's trial is a race against the clock.Maya:\nHuh? How come? Let's just take our time like always.Phoenix:\nI'm afraid... That's not an option.Maya:\n...?October 14, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 6Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Ron DeLite.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\nYou're \"ready\"? Preparation is the last refuge of the week.Judge:\n...OK, settle down everyone. Let's begin with your opening statement, Mr. Godot.Phoenix:\n(Ugh... He's got the judge in the palm of his hands... Yet again...)Godot:\nRon DeLite is simply too young to be sent to war. ...That's all.Judge:\n... I'm afraid I have no idea what that means, Mr. Godot.Godot:\nHa...! Then you need to get out more, Your Honor. Life is war. But that is exactly why you must be more precise in your wording. That's all my statement means. You understand now, right?Judge:\n...Yes. Well then, let me briefly summarize the details of this case.Phoenix:\n(Wow... The judge is taking charge like he knows what's going on for a change...)Judge:\nThe victim is Kane Bullard, CEO of KB Security. His body was found in a safe at approximately 9 AM on the morning of the 13th. However, the time of death was estimated as 1 AM of the previous day.Godot:\nAnd... that's when our little lost kitten dropped the ball. That little lost kitten is, of course, the defendant.Judge:\nVery well then, Mr. Godot. Please call your first witness.Godot:\nI never drink more than 17 cups of coffee during any given trial. But the first one... is always the best.Judge:\nUm, Mr. Godot... Your witness...?Godot:\n...OK, then. Let's hear what the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite, has to say for himself.Judge:\nThe defendant...? Well, Mr. Wright? Does the defense have any objections? It may be a bit of a disadvantage having the defendant testify, but...Phoenix:\n(I remember when Mia was defending me... She allowed me to testify so she could do the cross-examination... She put a lot of trust in me back then...) We have no objections, Your Honor. The defense will allow Mr. DeLite to testify.Godot:\nHa...! You've got guts, Trite.Judge:\nAlright then, Mr. Ron DeLite, please take the stand!Godot:\n...You did it. Didn't you?Ron:\nYes.Phoenix:\nWhat?Ron:\nUh... No no no no no no no! Th-Th-Th-That's not true!Judge:\n...Hmm. For a moment there I thought we'd set the record for the shortest trial ever.Maya:\n*sigh* Well, Mr. DeLite already looks plenty guilty with that face he's making...Phoenix:\nAnd once he opens his big mouth he'll probably put the last nail in his own coffin...Godot:\nHa...! Very well. Now then... Can you tell me something? If you didn't kill Bullard, why did you go to KB Security?Ron:\nW-W-Well, I... That's kind of hard to say. Boy, I wish I could go homeJudge:\nNow then, let's hear some testimony about what happened!Witness Testimony-- My Visit To KB Security --Ron:\nThat evening, around 1 AM, I went to see Mr. Bullard in his office at KB Security.\nThe blackmail letter I got... It ordered me to go there.\nI'd been working for KB Security until a year ago, so I knew where his office was.Judge:\n1 AM... The exact time the murder took place.Godot:\nThe weak get washed away by the tides of fate... The strong drink it up. Ha...! It's bitter today, too... Just like my destiny.Maya:\nYou'd never know that from the way he's chugging it down.Judge:\nMr. Wright... Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- My Visit To KB Security --Ron:\nThat evening, around 1 AM, I went to see Mr. Bullard in his office at KB Security.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n1 AM, huh... You're absolutely sure about that?\nRon:\nYes. That's what my watch said when I was entering the CEO's office... Err, no... Actually, I'm not really sure. My watch was slow, and my internal clock was also a bit\nJudge:\n1 AM... That's the exact time the victim, Mr. Bullard was murdered, correct?\nGodot:\nIt's too late for a coffee date, that's for sure.Ron:\nThe blackmail letter I got... It ordered me to go there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt \"ordered you there\"?\nRon:\nIt was the first time I'd gotten a blackmail letter that ordered me to go somewhere.\nJudge:\nDoes that mean you've gotten other blackmail letters then?\nRon:\nOh, of course. They'd say things like, \"Steal this\" or, \"Take that\".\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAha ha! Why don't you save those for later, Mr. DeLite? (Pleeease don't say any more! ...Now, what should do I do?)\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo what did the blackmail letter in question say...?\nRon:\nIt said to bring $50,000.\nGodot:\nMoney, eh. A perfect motive for committing murder.\nRon:\nOh! But! W-Wait! Waaaaaaaaait! I never intended to pay that money anyway!\nJudge:\nOh...? Is that right?\nRon:\nAfter all, he had nothing to hold over my head! I had nothing to be afraid of!\nJudge:\nHmm... An important point indeed. Witness, let's have that added to your testimony.\nRon:\nYes, sir!\nGodot:\nHa...!\nPhoenix:\n(A muddy mudskipper in outer space has a better chance of surviving than I do.)\nAdds statement \"The blackmail threat didn't scare me. It wasn't going to cause me trouble or anything.\"\n\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I can't press Ron too hard... It could ruin the case. I'll just take this one slowly...)\nMaya:\nWow Nick, you kind of look like a politician, planning out your next move...\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement \"The blackmail threat didn't scare me.

(Pleeease don't say any more!)Ron:\nThe blackmail threat didn't scare me. It wasn't going to cause me trouble or anything.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nJust what were you being \"blackmailed\" about anyway?\nJudge:\nThe blackmail letter said, \"If you don't want your identity revealed,\" correct?\nRon:\nI'm sure it was referring to the whole Mask\u2606DeMasque thing. But I wasn't worried. Mr. Bullard didn't have anything on me.\nJudge:\nHe didn't...?\nRon:\nAnyway, I don't care what anyone says about me. Just as long as Dessie believes in me.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's why Ms. DeLite didn't believe he was Mask\u2606DeMasque.)\nRon:\nThat's why I knew they were just hollow threats!\nJudge:\nHmm...Press (after adding statement \"He fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nJust what were you being \"blackmailed\" about anyway?\nJudge:\nThe blackmail letter said, \"If you don't want your identity revealed,\" correct?\nRon:\nI'm sure it was referring to the whole Mask\u2606DeMasque thing. \nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nTsk, tsk. I'm afraid that reason isn't going to hold up anymore.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nGodot:\nThe victim had no proof the defendant was Mask\u2606DeMasque. But... You were the one who stole company secrets only one year earlier.\nRon:\nB-B-But... That was all over with once I was fired! But it is true that the fact I stole secrets was kept under wraps... Even so, there was no reason for me to pay up now, a whole year later!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Is that really true?)\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that Ron was stealing company data... I wonder if he would've had a problem if that ever became public knowledge...?\n\n\n\nNot especially.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...Nah, I guess not.\nMaya:\nBut didn't you just say he might!?\nPhoenix:\nAlways avoid unpleasant or inconvenient facts... That's one of my rules.\nMaya:\nDon't try to get out of this by acting all cool!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nYes, he would.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... I believe you would have been in considerable trouble... ...if your identity as a company data thief was made public.\nRon:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! What are you trying to do by bullying your own client!?\nGodot:\nHa...! Men are like colonies of bacteria. The more heat you apply, the faster they grow.\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's exactly right!\nGodot:\nWell then, feel free to keep up the heat, my little lawyer amigo!\nPhoenix:\nL-Little lawyer amigo...?\nGodot:\nYes, now come on. Provide some evidence to back up your assertion. Why would Mr. DeLite want to keep his data stealing secret from going public!?\n\n\n\nPresent Desir\u00e9e DeLite profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite...

Well, Mr. Defendant?\nRon:\n...!\nJudge:\n...You heard the defendant.\nPhoenix:\n(Just when I thought it wasn't possible, a whole new level of irritation rises before me...)\nJudge:\nIt looks like the defense was just playing with himself.\nPhoenix:\n(Do you think you could rephrase that, Your Honor...? For my sake...?)\nJudge:\nWell, let's get back to the testimony, shall we?\nLeads back to cross-examinationPresent Desir\u00e9e DeLite profile (after adding statement \"He fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite...

You?\nGodot:\nAnd yet... A year ago, you were fired without notice... Revenge for an old grudge? A perfect motive for murder, wouldn't you say?\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(This isn't good. Maybe I should change the subject...?)\n\n\n\nLike after being fired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you do after being fired from KB Security?\nRon:\nI spent a lot of time looking for work... But then I decided I wanted to start something myself.\nPhoenix:\n(Not good! This is going from bad to worse...)\nRon:\nSo I started looking at books, TV, and movies, learning all I could about masked men.\nJudge:\nM-Masked men...?\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nS-So you wanted to try drawing a comic, right? ...About masked men!\nRon:\nNo no, that's not right. I wanted to become--\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Let's move along, shall we!?\nJudge:\nBut you asked the question... You're being quite odd today, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Way to bring the spinning buzz saw one notch closer to your own neck, Ace Attorney.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhy he was fired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite. Please tell us why you were fired from your job.\nRon:\nW-Well...\nGodot:\nThe world is filled with those who have said, \"I wish I had never asked that.\"\nPhoenix:\nO-OK, then I take it ba--\nJudge:\n...Defendant. Please answer the question.\nRon:\nI... Well. I needed money.\nJudge:\nYou needed money...?\nRon:\nUm, well, you see... Dessie loves to spend it. It's kind of her hobby...\nMaya:\nNot exactly the best hobby in the world, huh, Nick?\nRon:\nMy salary wasn't nearly enough... So, I stole data from the company.\nPhoenix:\n...Come again?\nRon:\nKB Security has a lot of security info on all sorts of companies... And since I was a security team chief...\nGodot:\nYou stole some data... and sold it.\nRon:\nMr. Bullard found out, and I was fired immediately.\nPhoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaa! (I wish I had never asked that...)\nRon:\nI was somehow able to keep it secret, and made it seem like I had quit on my own.\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick? You don't look so good.\nGodot:\nSomeone who brings harm to their company is fired as punishment. You'd well to remember that.\nMaya:\n...He sure told you.\nJudge:\nSo you admit that you stole data from your company, is that correct?\nRon:\nY-Yes. I'm sorry...\nJudge:\nThis is a very important fact. Please add it to your testimony!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh man... This whole thing just took a big turn for the worse, crashed, and blew up. ...It's gonna take the jaws of life to rip this case from the clutches of disaster.)\nAdds statement \"He fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that.\"\n\n\n\n\nDon't say anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I should just avoid this whole subject... At least for now.)\nJudge:\nHmm... As the defense appears to have nothing to say, it seems that this is indeed your motive.\nRon:\nWh-What? That's not true! I didn't have any hard feelings towards Mr. Bullard!\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! I knew I should've said something!)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement \"He fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou used to be a security chief for KB Security, right?\nRon:\n...Yes, that's right.\nJudge:\nA security chief?

What else?\nPhoenix:\nWasting money, huh...?\nRon:\nIt's not a waaaaaste!\nMaya:\nSo Ms. DeLite doesn't know that her husband was fired, does she?\nPhoenix:\nSo it would seem.\nMaya:\nI'm not sure what to think about couples who keep secrets like that from each other.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe it. This case has gotten even Maya to think seriously about couples...)\nJudge:\nPlease try to stay focused, Mr. Wright.Maya:\nHmm... There wasn't much to his testimony, was there?Phoenix:\nSounds like he's avoiding something... At least, that's what it sounds like to me.Maya:\nUh oh. I've got a bad feeling about this... We'd better be careful.Phoenix:\nBut if we don't find a way to make him spill the beans... ...we'll never get closer to the truth.Maya:\nYeah...",

It wasn't going to cause me trouble or anything.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nJust what were you being \"blackmailed\" about anyway?\nJudge:\nThe blackmail letter said, \"If you don't want your identity revealed,\" correct?\nRon:\nI'm sure it was referring to the whole Mask\u2606DeMasque thing. But I wasn't worried. Mr. Bullard didn't have anything on me.\nJudge:\nHe didn't...?\nRon:\nAnyway, I don't care what anyone says about me. Just as long as Dessie believes in me.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's why Ms. DeLite didn't believe he was Mask\u2606DeMasque.)\nRon:\nThat's why I knew they were just hollow threats!\nJudge:\nHmm...Press (after adding statement \"He fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nJust what were you being \"blackmailed\" about anyway?\nJudge:\nThe blackmail letter said, \"If you don't want your identity revealed,\" correct?\nRon:\nI'm sure it was referring to the whole Mask\u2606DeMasque thing. \nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nTsk, tsk. I'm afraid that reason isn't going to hold up anymore.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nGodot:\nThe victim had no proof the defendant was Mask\u2606DeMasque. But... You were the one who stole company secrets only one year earlier.\nRon:\nB-B-But... That was all over with once I was fired! But it is true that the fact I stole secrets was kept under wraps... Even so, there was no reason for me to pay up now, a whole year later!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Is that really true?)\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that Ron was stealing company data... I wonder if he would've had a problem if that ever became public knowledge...?\n\n\n\nNot especially.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...Nah, I guess not.\nMaya:\nBut didn't you just say he might!?\nPhoenix:\nAlways avoid unpleasant or inconvenient facts... That's one of my rules.\nMaya:\nDon't try to get out of this by acting all cool!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nYes, he would.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... I believe you would have been in considerable trouble... ...if your identity as a company data thief was made public.\nRon:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! What are you trying to do by bullying your own client!?\nGodot:\nHa...! Men are like colonies of bacteria. The more heat you apply, the faster they grow.\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's exactly right!\nGodot:\nWell then, feel free to keep up the heat, my little lawyer amigo!\nPhoenix:\nL-Little lawyer amigo...?\nGodot:\nYes, now come on. Provide some evidence to back up your assertion. Why would Mr. DeLite want to keep his data stealing secret from going public!?\n\n\n\nPresent Desir\u00e9e DeLite profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite...

Well, Mr. Defendant?\nRon:\n...!\nJudge:\n...You heard the defendant.\nPhoenix:\n(Just when I thought it wasn't possible, a whole new level of irritation rises before me...)\nJudge:\nIt looks like the defense was just playing with himself.\nPhoenix:\n(Do you think you could rephrase that, Your Honor...? For my sake...?)\nJudge:\nWell, let's get back to the testimony, shall we?\nLeads back to cross-examinationPresent Desir\u00e9e DeLite profile (after adding statement \"He fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite...

You?\nGodot:\nAnd yet... A year ago, you were fired without notice... Revenge for an old grudge? A perfect motive for murder, wouldn't you say?\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(This isn't good. Maybe I should change the subject...?)\n\n\n\nLike after being fired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you do after being fired from KB Security?\nRon:\nI spent a lot of time looking for work... But then I decided I wanted to start something myself.\nPhoenix:\n(Not good! This is going from bad to worse...)\nRon:\nSo I started looking at books, TV, and movies, learning all I could about masked men.\nJudge:\nM-Masked men...?\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nS-So you wanted to try drawing a comic, right? ...About masked men!\nRon:\nNo no, that's not right. I wanted to become--\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Let's move along, shall we!?\nJudge:\nBut you asked the question... You're being quite odd today, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Way to bring the spinning buzz saw one notch closer to your own neck, Ace Attorney.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhy he was fired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite. Please tell us why you were fired from your job.\nRon:\nW-Well...\nGodot:\nThe world is filled with those who have said, \"I wish I had never asked that.\"\nPhoenix:\nO-OK, then I take it ba--\nJudge:\n...Defendant. Please answer the question.\nRon:\nI... Well. I needed money.\nJudge:\nYou needed money...?\nRon:\nUm, well, you see... Dessie loves to spend it. It's kind of her hobby...\nMaya:\nNot exactly the best hobby in the world, huh, Nick?\nRon:\nMy salary wasn't nearly enough... So, I stole data from the company.\nPhoenix:\n...Come again?\nRon:\nKB Security has a lot of security info on all sorts of companies... And since I was a security team chief...\nGodot:\nYou stole some data... and sold it.\nRon:\nMr. Bullard found out, and I was fired immediately.\nPhoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaa! (I wish I had never asked that...)\nRon:\nI was somehow able to keep it secret, and made it seem like I had quit on my own.\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick? You don't look so good.\nGodot:\nSomeone who brings harm to their company is fired as punishment. You'd well to remember that.\nMaya:\n...He sure told you.\nJudge:\nSo you admit that you stole data from your company, is that correct?\nRon:\nY-Yes. I'm sorry...\nJudge:\nThis is a very important fact. Please add it to your testimony!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh man... This whole thing just took a big turn for the worse, crashed, and blew up. ...It's gonna take the jaws of life to rip this case from the clutches of disaster.)\nAdds statement \"He fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that.\"\n\n\n\n\nDon't say anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I should just avoid this whole subject... At least for now.)\nJudge:\nHmm... As the defense appears to have nothing to say, it seems that this is indeed your motive.\nRon:\nWh-What? That's not true! I didn't have any hard feelings towards Mr. Bullard!\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! I knew I should've said something!)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement \"He fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou used to be a security chief for KB Security, right?\nRon:\n...Yes, that's right.\nJudge:\nA security chief?

What else?\nPhoenix:\nWasting money, huh...?\nRon:\nIt's not a waaaaaste!\nMaya:\nSo Ms. DeLite doesn't know that her husband was fired, does she?\nPhoenix:\nSo it would seem.\nMaya:\nI'm not sure what to think about couples who keep secrets like that from each other.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe it. This case has gotten even Maya to think seriously about couples...)\nJudge:\nPlease try to stay focused, Mr. Wright.Maya:\nHmm... There wasn't much to his testimony, was there?Phoenix:\nSounds like he's avoiding something... At least, that's what it sounds like to me.Maya:\nUh oh. I've got a bad feeling about this... We'd better be careful.Phoenix:\nBut if we don't find a way to make him spill the beans... ...we'll never get closer to the truth.Maya:\nYeah...Phoenix:\nMr. DeLite...

Of having a certain person find out your secret...Ron:\n*gulp*Judge:\nA certain person...?Phoenix:\nMs. Desir\u00e9e DeLite. The defendant's wife.Ron:\nWaah! But I-I...! L-Listen to me! My Dessie! She's...!Godot:\n...Looks like if I just sit back and relax, the fun will end before it truly begins.Phoenix:\n(Grr! Godot!)Godot:\nYes, we know. It was all your wife's fault.Judge:\nWhat do you mean...?Godot:\nMr. DeLite stole company data to pay for his wife's spending habit, for which he was fired. Unable to face his own wife, someone used this dirty little secret to blackmail him. And that is how this murder came about!Judge:\nOh... Hmm...!Phoenix:\n(No! Everything is falling neatly into place for him!)Ron:\nD-Don't talk about my Dessie like that... Or you'll be sooooooorry!!Judge:\nWell, it seems... ...that we've learned a great deal of things here, so far.Maya:\nWhat do you think, Nick?Phoenix:\nI didn't think it was possible to get so thoroughly whipped in just 20 minutes...Judge:\nClearly there was sufficient motive for murder. He stole data for his wife, and he killed to protect his secret... A family man who cared just a little too much.Godot:\nThe motive is clear. Let's move on.Phoenix:\nUgggh...Godot:\nWhat happened at the crime scene at 1 in the morning, Mr. DeLite? Come now! Tell us! We're all ears.Witness Testimony-- At the CEO's Office --Ron:\nWhen I entered the office, there was a suspicious shadow there...\nSuddenly, I was hit on the forehead. After that, I remember being a bit dazed.\nIf I hadn't been wearing that, I would have been killed!\nWhen I came to... Mr. Bullard was lying there... dead!Judge:\nI see... Suddenly hit on the forehead, huh? I believe the detective from yesterday provided similar testimony. He said that Mask\u2606DeMasque struck him on the head from behind.Phoenix:\n(Of course, since Atmey turned out to be the culprit himself, that was all a lie.)Godot:\nHa...! No one's going to believe a pathetic lie like that.Ron:\nWh-What are you saying!? I really was attacked!Judge:\nWe'll find out if what you say is true or not during the cross-examination.Godot:\nGot that, Mr. Trite? Don't go easy just because he's your client. If I see any sign that you are, I'll treat you to another cup of my special blend!Phoenix:\nYou don't need to worry about that, Mr. Godot... (I have faith in Ron... I know he didn't do it...!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- At the CEO's Office --Ron:\nWhen I entered the office, there was a suspicious shadow there...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho was this \"suspicious shadow\"?\nRon:\nIf there were a thousand of me, and if even one knew, I'd tell you. Trust me.\nMaya:\n...His dodging all of our questions is NOT helping us win his case.\nPhoenix:\nOK, then how was the victim, Mr. Bullard, at that time?\nRon:\nWhat do you mean by \"how was he\"?\nPhoenix:\nWas he already dead? Was he still alive? Maybe he was the one who hit you in the first place.\nRon:\nThat's a good question... What do you think, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n...F-Forget it.Ron:\nSuddenly, I was hit on the forehead. After that, I remember being a bit dazed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour forehead...?\nRon:\nYes. I was hit on the forehead as soon as I entered the room. It was an amazingly fast and powerful attack.\nPhoenix:\nDo you remember anything about who hit you?\nRon:\nWell, like I said... It was a fast and powerful hit. So I think I was a little dazed for a while.\nMaya:\nI don't think Mr. DeLite even grasped what you were asking...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I'd like to show him a fast and powerful attack himself. Maybe that would knock some sense back into him...Ron:\nIf I hadn't been wearing that, I would have been killed!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"That\"? Could you please clarify what you are referring to?\nRon:\nWhy, my Mask\u2606DeMasque costume, of course!\nJudge:\nW-Wait just a moment! \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\"...?\nRon:\nHuh? Oh, did I forget to mention it before...? Just to be on the safe side, I dressed as Mask\u2606DeMasque! And then, I descended upon the office of the CEO of KB Security!\nJudge:\nWhaaaaaat!?\nMaya:\nNick! Did you know about this? He never told me this!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't recall him ever mentioning it to me either...)\nGodot:\nEven I didn't know that. It seems our little friend really loves to keep secrets.\nRon:\nI'm sorry. I just never had a chance to mention it up until now... Wait. That's not right. Umm... You know how sometimes things just slip your mind\nGodot:\nHa...! My 6th cup of coffee is staring up at me coldly.\nJudge:\nAt any rate, we can't ignore this new piece of information. Witness! Please correct your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"If I hadn't been wearing that, I would have been killed!\" to \"I'd have been killed if I hadn't been wearing my Mask\u2606DeMasque costume!\"Ron:\nI'd have been killed if I hadn't been wearing my Mask\u2606DeMasque costume!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you dressed up as Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nRon:\nWhy... because I'm Mask\u2606DeMasque, of course.\nJudge:\nW-What are you talking about!? Mask\u2606DeMasque's trial is being held next door!\nRon:\nAh... Y-Yes, I guess so. Anyway, at that time... ...I thought I was being blackmailed over the Mask\u2606DeMasque issue. So I thought I should go as him, just to be safe.\nPhoenix:\nOh boy...\nRon:\nLet me tell you, it's a real pain to move around with that cape... That's why it took a lot longer than I'd expected.\nPhoenix:\n\"Took a lot longer\"...? (What is he talking about...?)\n\n\n\nWait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll wait and see how this develops...)\nMaya:\nHey, why aren't you doing anything?\nPhoenix:\nBecause it'll probably end up causing more trouble. I'll tackle it once I'm mentally prepared.\nMaya:\n... I guess I should prepare myself for the worst, too.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... What do you mean by \"took a lot longer\"...?\nRon:\nOh, opening the safe, of course. My cape got caught on the safe door, you see. This all happened when I was hiding Mr. Bullard's body...\nJudge:\nWh-Wh-What was that!? Back up a second!\nRon:\n...Yes?\nJudge:\nYou were the one that hid the body in the safe!?\nRon:\nUm, well... Yeah.\nJudge:\nInconceivablllllle! Why!? Just... Why!? What reason could you have!? What were you thinking!?\nGodot:\nQuestion. When does someone toss their dirty shorts in the washing machine?\nJudge:\nUh... What?\nGodot:\nThe answer is simple. When they take them off.\nJudge:\n... As usual, I have no idea what you're saying.\nPhoenix:\nDo you mean that Mr. DeLite hid the body because he's the murderer?\nGodot:\nHa...! So you're not as stupid as you look!\nMaya:\nHis metaphor this time was really obscure...\nJudge:\n... Mr. Wright, you don't mean... ...that you knew about this whole safe business, do you!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, well... Yes.\nJudge:\nWhy am I the only one not in the loop here!? Witness! Make sure you add this to the testimony!\nRon:\nY-Yes, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... Looks like a storm front is moving in over the fair-weather judge.)\nAdds statement \"I panicked and hid the body in the safe. It took about 10 minutes.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you dressed up as Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nRon:\nWhy... because I'm Mask\u2606DeMasque, of course.\nJudge:\nW-What are you talking about!?

Mr. Bullard was lying there... dead!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"When you came to\"...?\nRon:\nYes. I was passed out in the corner of the room.\nPhoenix:\nDo you know when your assailant made their escape, and to where...?\nRon:\nI-I'm afraid... I don't really remember.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nRon:\nOnce they hit me, I lost all track of what was going on. I think that's when they made their escape...\nGodot:\nHa...! That's certainly a convenient story for you, isn't it?\nJudge:\nIt certainly is, isn't it, Mr. Wright? It almost sounds... practiced.\nPhoenix:\nI-I don't know why you're telling me...Ron:\nI panicked and hid the body in the safe. It took about 10 minutes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you hide the body in the safe anyway?\nRon:\nWell... Because it wouldn't fit in a drawer.\nPhoenix:\nUh, that's not exactly what I meant...\nRon:\nWhen I saw that corpse, I kind of lost it. I thought, \"If they find his corpse, they'll think I did it!\"\nGodot:\nHa...! I think you had a simpler reason than that. It's because you killed him! That's why you spent 10 minutes hiding the body.\nJudge:\nHmmm... That certainly makes more sense.\nPhoenix:\nNngh... (Hold on... \"10 minutes\"...?)\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI just had a thought... Under those circumstances, would you normally try to hide the body...? And spend 10 whole minutes to do it?\nMaya:\nUnder \"those circumstances\"? What circumstances...? ...Oh! Hey, Nick! If you think his behavior was so strange... ...why don't you present some evidence that would show just what those circumstances were!\nPhoenix:\n(That's it! I'll take a look at the Court Record, and present some evidence!)Present CEO Office Buzzer, Buzzer Record, or Larry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, could you please take a look at this record?\"Maya:\nWe heard this from Mr. DeLite yesterday, didn't we?Phoenix:\nThere's not much in this testimony either.Maya:\nI betcha he's still hiding something.Phoenix:\nI wouldn't be surprised.

When does someone toss their dirty shorts in the washing machine?\nJudge:\nUh... What?\nGodot:\nThe answer is simple. When they take them off.\nJudge:\n... As usual, I have no idea what you're saying.\nPhoenix:\nDo you mean that Mr. DeLite hid the body because he's the murderer?\nGodot:\nHa...! So you're not as stupid as you look!\nMaya:\nHis metaphor this time was really obscure...\nJudge:\n... Mr. Wright, you don't mean... ...that you knew about this whole safe business, do you!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, well... Yes.\nJudge:\nWhy am I the only one not in the loop here!? Witness! Make sure you add this to the testimony!\nRon:\nY-Yes, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... Looks like a storm front is moving in over the fair-weather judge.)\nAdds statement \"I panicked and hid the body in the safe. It took about 10 minutes.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you dressed up as Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nRon:\nWhy... because I'm Mask\u2606DeMasque, of course.\nJudge:\nW-What are you talking about!? Mask\u2606DeMasque's trial is being held next door!\nRon:\nAh... Y-Yes, I guess so. Anyway, at that time... ...I thought I was being blackmailed over the Mask\u2606DeMasque issue. So I thought I should go as him, just to be safe.\nPhoenix:\nOh boy...Ron:\nWhen I came to... Mr. Bullard was lying there... dead!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"When you came to\"...?\nRon:\nYes. I was passed out in the corner of the room.\nPhoenix:\nDo you know when your assailant made their escape, and to where...?\nRon:\nI-I'm afraid... I don't really remember.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nRon:\nOnce they hit me, I lost all track of what was going on. I think that's when they made their escape...\nGodot:\nHa...! That's certainly a convenient story for you, isn't it?\nJudge:\nIt certainly is, isn't it, Mr. Wright? It almost sounds... practiced.\nPhoenix:\nI-I don't know why you're telling me...Ron:\nI panicked and hid the body in the safe. It took about 10 minutes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you hide the body in the safe anyway?\nRon:\nWell... Because it wouldn't fit in a drawer.\nPhoenix:\nUh, that's not exactly what I meant...\nRon:\nWhen I saw that corpse, I kind of lost it. I thought, \"If they find his corpse, they'll think I did it!\"\nGodot:\nHa...! I think you had a simpler reason than that. It's because you killed him! That's why you spent 10 minutes hiding the body.\nJudge:\nHmmm... That certainly makes more sense.\nPhoenix:\nNngh... (Hold on... \"10 minutes\"...?)\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI just had a thought... Under those circumstances, would you normally try to hide the body...? And spend 10 whole minutes to do it?\nMaya:\nUnder \"those circumstances\"? What circumstances...? ...Oh! Hey, Nick! If you think his behavior was so strange... ...why don't you present some evidence that would show just what those circumstances were!\nPhoenix:\n(That's it! I'll take a look at the Court Record, and present some evidence!)Present CEO Office Buzzer, Buzzer Record, or Larry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, could you please take a look at this record?\"Maya:\nWe heard this from Mr. DeLite yesterday, didn't we?Phoenix:\nThere's not much in this testimony either.Maya:\nI betcha he's still hiding something.Phoenix:\nI wouldn't be surprised. We'll just have to draw it out of him.Maya:\nI just hope he doesn't make things any more complicated...Phoenix:\nYour Honor, could you please take a look at this record?Judge:\nAnd what might this be?Phoenix:\nThe record for the emergency buzzer that connects the CEO's office to security. If the button in the office is pressed, a security team is supposed to come running...Godot:\n...Phoenix:\nAnd according to this record, the buzzer was pushed once, at 1:02 AM!Judge:\nWh... Whaaat?Phoenix:\nIf Mr. Ron DeLite truly was the murderer... ...he would have ran as soon as that buzzer sounded! After all, a security guard would've been heading his way!Godot:Godot:\nHa...! Let's remember who we're dealing with here. He probably had no idea there were security personnel in the building!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nUp until one year ago, my client was working as a chief of security! There's no way he wouldn't have known about them!Godot:Godot:\nBut! As it turns out, the guard never came.Phoenix:\nThat was nothing more than a coincidence! The fact that the guard was a pathetic loser... ...who had just gotten punched in the face by his ex's new boyfriend... ...and wasn't anywhere in the vicinity was not something Mr. DeLite could have known!Godot:Godot:\nHa...! Again, remember who we're dealing with here. It's a sure bet that Mr. DeLite didn't even notice the buzzer going off!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThis buzzer is extremely loud. There is no way he could've ignored something like that! IF he had been conscious, that is.Judge:\n\"Conscious\"...? What do you mean by that!?Godot:\n... Ugh...! Fine. Let's hear your theory.Phoenix:\nRemember the defendant's testimony. The moment he entered the victim's office, someone attacked him... Mr. DeLite said he felt \"dazed\"... I'm willing to wager that he was knocked unconscious for at least a few minutes.Judge:\nUnconscious...? So he fainted!?Phoenix:\nThat's why Mr. DeLite didn't know that the buzzer had sounded. And that's why... he thought he had time to hide the body!Godot:\nS-So what are you trying to say...!?Phoenix:\nMr. DeLite was knocked out, and the buzzer went off soon afterwards... Now, unless my client was able to hit the buzzer while he was unconscious... It can only mean that there was another person in that room! That's right! Whoever it was knocked out Ron DeLite and then pressed the buzzer!Judge:\nO-Order in the court! Mr. Wright! This... This is...!Godot:Godot:\nTh-This is preposterous! It was this kid... ...Ron DeLite, is the one who killed Kane Bullard!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThen who pressed the buzzer?Godot:\nI-It was... The victim, of course! He pressed the buzzer when the defendant attacked him! He didn't die right away! He must have held on long enough to push that button!Phoenix:\nACK!!Judge:\nHmmm... So Kane Bullard sounded the buzzer himself... What is your opinion on this, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n(I need to prove that the real criminal was there at the scene! But how? Can I prove that it wasn't Kane Bullard who sounded the buzzer?)I can prove it alright.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The defense's opinion is this, Your Honor!\"I'm not ready yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defense... admits there is no evidence to the contrary. It is possible that the victim himself sounded the buzzer...\nGodot:\nHa...! \"Possible\"? More like \"definite\", Mr. Trite.\nJudge:\nWhich means... Only two people were there at the crime scene after all.\nGodot:\nThe victim, Kane Bullard, and his killer... Mr. DeLite.\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! If you can't prove that the \"real killer was there\"... ...this trial is as good as finished!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! I guess I need to show some sort of evidence after all...!)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense's opinion is this, Your Honor!\"Phoenix:\nThe defense's opinion is this, Your Honor! This piece of evidence proves that it wasn't the victim who sounded the buzzer!Present CEO Office Buzzer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I believe this is the piece of incontrovertible evidence you were looking for!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWell, what do you think, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nHa...! I can hear it... The sound of a buzzer!\nJudge:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nIt's going off inside your head at this very moment. ...The emergency buzzer of your heart!\nMaya:\nIs it really?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe just a little.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! You need to think more carefully!\nMaya:\nOof... Guess there goes your chance to become an \"Ace Detective\".\nPhoenix:\nCome, listen more carefully! Maybe the truth will be elegantly revealed...?\nMaya:\nCreepy... You sound like Detective Atmey...\nLeads back to:\n\"The defense's opinion is this, Your Honor!\"Phoenix:\nI believe this is the piece of incontrovertible evidence you were looking for!Judge:\nTh-The emergency buzzer...? Is there some kind of clue on it?Phoenix:\nAbsolutely not.Godot:\nHey, come on now... At least give some thought to what you say before opening your mouth.Phoenix:\nThe fact that there are absolutely no clues... is itself the clue.Judge:\nNow I'm the one who's clueless!Phoenix:\nThis button has no fingerprints on it. If Mr. Bullard had really pressed it himself... ...naturally, he would have left his fingerprints behind!Godot:\nPhwoooooooooooh!!Godot:Godot:\nR...Ron DeLite... obviously wiped them off!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nWhy would he? A guard could have come in at any moment!Godot:\nHe touched that button! I know he did!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThe defendant, Mr. DeLite, was dressed as Mask\u2606DeMasque. And Mask\u2606DeMasque... always wears gloves! What reason could he possibly have had to wipe the button free of fingerprints!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!Godot:\nHa...! It would seem... I've been forced to eat crow!Maya:\nI wonder what blend number crow-flavored coffee is?Judge:\nHowever, if the real killer was there at the scene... ...why would that person press the emergency buzzer?Phoenix:\n...Judge:\nShouldn't they have run away without putting themselves in extra danger?Phoenix:\n...Judge:\n......Phoenix:\n.........Judge:\nWhat's with this awkward silence all of a sudden!?Godot:\nHa...! It looks like you're fresh out of parlor tricks.Maya:\nThey're on to you, Nick!Phoenix:\nJ-Just give me a minute to collect my thoughts...! The real culprit killed Mr. Bullard at around 1 AM.Maya:\nAnd Mr. DeLite just happened to waltz in when the murder was taking place, right?Phoenix:\nThe killer clobbered Mr. DeLite, and then sounded the buzzer.Maya:\nEven though security was supposed to respond right away if the buzzer was pressed.Phoenix:\n(\"Security was supposed to respond\"? Hmm...)Judge:\n...Time's up, Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you have to say.Phoenix:\nVery well then...Godot:\nOh ho... You've got some guts. I like that in an opponent.Judge:\nWhy did the \"real killer\" sound the emergency buzzer?They didn't mean to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIn all probability... the killer didn't mean to press it.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's possible that they simply pressed it by accident. It could have been with their back during the scuffle, for example.\nRon:\nAha! That must be why there weren't any fingerprints!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Is there a functioning brain underneath all that ridiculous hair, Mr. Trite?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nThe accused testified that he was hit as soon as he entered the room. In other words, as far away from the buzzer as he could possibly be at the time!\nPhoenix:\n...Ack!\nJudge:\nIt would seem you've been taken for a ride, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! One more time! I've got to calm down and think quick!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Why did the \"real killer\" sound the emergency buzzer?\"To call the security guard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The killer knew that if they pressed that button, a guard would come running.\"To find out what it did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIn all probability... the killer didn't know what the button was for.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean...?\nPhoenix:\nThe killer probably thought, \"I wonder what this does?\" and pressed it to find out!\nRon:\nOh! That's exactly how I make a lot of my mistakes, too!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Is there a functioning brain underneath all that ridiculous hair, Mr. Trite?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nThe panel around the button is labeled quite clearly. It says, \"Emergency Buzzer\".\nPhoenix:\nDoh!\nGodot:\nLet me guess. Maybe next, you'll want to claim this mysterious \"killer\" was illiterate?\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! One more time! I've got to calm down and think quick!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Why did the \"real killer\" sound the emergency buzzer?\"Phoenix:\nThe killer knew that if they pressed that button, a guard would come running. And that was exactly what they wanted.Judge:\nD-Do you mean to say the killer called the guard on purpose!?Phoenix:\nYes... Although as it turned out, he never showed up.Maya:\nBecause he was getting his clock cleaned at the time...Godot:\nHa...! What a touching story! You're saying the killer had a change of heart and called the guard to turn himself in?Phoenix:\nNo, I'm not. When that buzzer sounded, there were three people in that office. The victim, Kane Bullard, who was already dead. The defendant, Ron DeLite, who was out cold. And... The third person. The real killer.Judge:\n...Hypothetically, yes.Phoenix:\nNow then... In this situation, if the real killer made an escape, what would happen? The only ones left in the room would be the victim, and Ron DeLite...Ron:\nAnd... And if any security guards came running in at that time... They would think that I was the murderer!Phoenix:\nYes! That was precisely the real killer's objective. To frame Ron DeLite for the murder!Godot:\nPhwooooooooooh!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!Godot:\nHa...! It would seem... I've been made to eat my words once again!Maya:\nActually you've been made to do a spit-take... with a cup of coffee.Ron:\nM-Mr. Wright! Who was it!? Who was it that tried to frame me!? Err... Wait. Wait a second... I'm the one and only Mask\u2606DeMasque, soMaya:\nNick! You mean the real killer is...!?Phoenix:\nWe're going to drag that person in here right now!Maya:\nBut, but! Who is it?Phoenix:\nI don't have any solid proof yet... but think about it. The killer knew Mr. DeLite's identity. And they also knew... ...that he had been called to KB Security that night... So, the killer used him to execute a well-crafted plan to murder Kane Bullard!Judge:\nHmm, now then. Let's hear your accusation, Mr. Wright. Who was it framed Mr. Ron DeLite for the murder of Kane Bullard!?Present Luke Atmey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Luke Atmey... He's the only one who could have done it.\"Present Desir\u00e9e DeLite profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNaturally... the true culprit was none other than...

Have you gone insane...!?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nAren't you forgetting something, Mr. Trite?\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me?\nGodot:\nWhere was Desir\u00e9e DeLite at 1:00 AM that night...?\nMaya:\nAh! That's right! She was at the police station! For almost the entire night!\nGodot:\nShe was being questioned after being stopped for reckless riding... ...I have a record of it here.\nPhoenix:\nAaaah!! (I forgot all about that...)\nJudge:\nIt seems that senility may be setting in early for you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Talk about things you never want to hear this judge say to you...)\nMaya:\nIt looks like you'd better think again.\nLeads back to:\n\"Hmm, now then. Let's hear your accusation, Mr. Wright.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMaya:\nH-Hang on, Nick! Are you saying this is the person who tried to frame Mr. DeLite for the murder?\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah. Who else could it be?\nMaya:\nDid they even know that Mr. DeLite was Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I wonder...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Need I warn you about what will happen of you present irrelevant evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I'd better think this through again...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Hmm, now then.

Mask\u2606DeMasque did it...?Phoenix:\nYour Honor, the person being tried in the court next to us... ...is not Mask\u2606DeMasque at all. He is, in actuality... the true murderer of Kane Bullard!Judge:\nOrder! Order!! M-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!Phoenix:\nTheft and murder... Which is the more serious crime?Judge:\nThey're not even close. Murder is the more serious crime, of course! It's a capital crime subject to a capital punishment.Phoenix:\nPlease remember the trial from yesterday, if you would. When Luke Atmey confessed, there was a huge commotion in the courtroom.Godot:\nOf course. A famous detective was unmasked as... well, as Mask\u2606DeMasque.Phoenix:\nInstead of being convicted of murder, he was found guilty of grand larceny. ...That was his true objective all along.Judge:\nTo be found \"guilty\"...Phoenix:\nMask\u2606DeMasque had the perfect alibi for when the murder took place. He was stealing the urn at Lordly Tailor. ...In other words! Being found guilty as Mask\u2606DeMasque... ...was Luke Atmey's airtight, watertight, and unassailable alibi.Judge:\nA guilty verdict... AS AN ALIBI!?Godot:\nYou know... It's almost time.Judge:\nF-For what?Godot:\nFor Luke Atmey's verdict. It was a pretty simple trial, after all. If we're going to stop this trial and stall that one, we need to do it now. Of course... That's assuming you have proof that the detective was the one who committed the murder.Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nMr. Luke Atmey's trial has indeed attracted the attention of the entire country. If we were to intrude, and failed to provide adequate proof of his true crime...  Mr. DeLite would be left with no grounds for appeal.Phoenix:\n... (Am I really sure about this...?)Godot:\nHa...! A bet's only good when your life's the ante.Ron:\nMr. Wright! I... I believe in you!Phoenix:\nMr. DeLite...Ron:\nSo... So... Please. I'M BEGGING YOOOOOOU!!Phoenix:\n(Thanks... But... My decision will determine the rest of your life! Can I really risk your life like this...?)...Phoenix...Phoenix:\n...! (Wh-What was that...?)...Don't stray Phoenix......For your client...

Please take the stand.Atmey:\nWell well... How do you do, Sir Lawyer? I never would have thought to see you acting so recklessly.Phoenix:\nI couldn't let them hand down your verdict just yet. Not when it would have given you your perfect alibi. An alibi by the name of \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\"...Atmey:\nI'm sorry. I'm afraid even the great Luke Atmey has no idea what you mean. Of course, I have been in the next courtroom ever since 10 o'clock this morning. ...I'm afraid there's no way I could know what's been going on in here.Judge:\nYou've been in the defendant's seat all day long, correct? Being tried as Mask\u2606DeMasque...Atmey:\nIndeed... It's truly child's play to fool the ignorant masses. Not only did the poor fools ask me to \"protect\" their valuables... ...they even gave me a generous reward upon returning their own property to them. Take this red diamond ring that sparkles upon my divine finger, for example...Phoenix:\nSo you continue to insist that you are, in fact, \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\"?Atmey:\n...Of course.Judge:\nVery well then, Luke Atmey. Let us begin with this simple question. On October 12th at 1 AM. Kane Bullard was murdered. Where were you at that time?Atmey:\nOne without knowledge lacks even the knowledge that he should be ashamed of himself. ...But don't worry. I will not hold it against you, Sir Judge.Judge:\nUm, thanks...Godot:\nAlright, Mr. Atmey... The night of the murder... Speak! ...We're all ears!

Sir Prosecutor.Witness Testimony-- The Alibi --Atmey:\nI was stealing the urn as Mask\u2606DeMasque, just as I announced I would...\nI had more than enough time to prepare. It was a pathetically easy job.\nA photograph contains no words... But in this case, one turned out to be my witness.\nThe time at which the camera captured Mask\u2606DeMasque was the same time as the murder!Judge:\nHmm... It seems the main point of discussion will be this photo of the crime scene.Phoenix:\n(Everything else up until now was all part of his plan. There has to be a secret to this picture as well!)Atmey:\nEven the great Mask\u2606DeMasque cannot be in two places at once. Now then, if you'll excuse me. I have a verdict to receive.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Atmey, we still have to do your cross-examination.Atmey:\n...A fool is too foolish to know that he is a fool...Maya:\nI think he's trying to say that you're full of it, Nick.Phoenix:\nThe only thing that's full of it is his alibi!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Alibi --Atmey:\nI was stealing the urn as Mask\u2606DeMasque, just as I announced I would...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo this photograph is the proof, correct?\nAtmey:\nIndeed it is.\nPhoenix:\nAnd the man in the photo is certainly wearing a mask.\nAtmey:\nThat is why I am called \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\".\nPhoenix:\nBut conveniently, that also means that there is no way to tell who this really is.\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Are you saying that this is not, in fact, Luke Atmey? That it could be an accomplice dressed up as Mask\u2606DeMasque to create an alibi...?\nAtmey:\nOh ho... What an interesting idea. Are you saying that I, Lone Wolf Luke, had an accomplice?\n\n\n\nName the accomplice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Luke Atmey was at KB Security during the murder... ...then the Mask\u2606DeMasque in this picture has to be a fake.) ...Exactly. You had an accomplice!\nGodot:\nNow remember you've said that, Mr. Trite, because there's no going back. If you're making baseless claims, I'll treat you to a penalty itself!\nMaya:\nThat penalty is probably boiling hot, too...\nGodot:\nSo who was it, Mr. Trite!? Who was the accomplice!?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... It was this person.\nGodot:\nHa...! That's quite the prank you're trying to pull... Do you have any evidence that this person is, in fact, the accomplice?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... T-The aura! The aura that this person has around them is...\nJudge:\nIf you're going to judge someone by their aura... ...you'd be right up there as the number one suspect, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Nnrgh... I jumped the gun on that one!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Luke Atmey was at KB Security during the murder... ...then the Mask\u2606DeMasque in this picture has to be a fake.)\nMaya:\nThen there really was an accomplice!\nPhoenix:\nBut right now, I have no idea who it was.\nMaya:\nHmm... I don't have any idea right now either. \nPhoenix:\n(Baseless objections are just what that guy wants... There's got to be another way... And I'm going to find it!)\nLeads back to cross-examinationAtmey:\nI had more than enough time to prepare. It was a pathetically easy job.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe Adrian Andrews hired you at one point?\nAtmey:\nThat's right... That was over 20 days ago, if I'm not mistaken.\nPhoenix:\nYou sent the calling card to Lordly Tailor 10 days before the heist... That would mean you seat out the card after you began your security watch, right?\nAtmey:\nIndeed. There was no reason why I couldn't do both jobs at once. It was the perfect opportunity to steal my latest target.\nJudge:\nI see... You truly are evil, aren't you?\nAtmey:\nYes. Evil is what I am...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... Isn't there something odd about this?\nPhoenix:\nHm?\nMaya:\nDetective Atmey was always proud of his \"Ace Detective\" skills, right? But if the urn was stolen from Lordly Tailor while he was the only one watching it... ...he'd have no way to maintain his perfect \"Ace Detective\" persona.\nPhoenix:\n(You know, that's true... It is kind of odd.)\nAtmey:\n...Atmey:\nA photograph contains no words... But in this case, one turned out to be my witness.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo by \"photograph\", you mean this piece of evidence here. Is that correct?\nAtmey:\nIndeed it is. That is it! The very thing that proves I committed the crime.\nPhoenix:\nThe very thing... that proves you committed the crime... (When you think about it... It's really odd...) You say that almost as if you had this picture taken on purpose...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHe was simply caught by the very camera that he had set up... We all have days like that.\nAtmey:\nIndeed... It turned out that there was no such thing as the perfect crime after all. Life is truly an ironic thing. A sad, blue melody...\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I'd better gather more information for now... If he's truly the killer... there's got to be something phony in that video.)Press (after pressing second and fourth statements)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo by \"photograph\", you mean this piece of evidence here. Is that correct?\nAtmey:\nIndeed it is. That is it! The very thing that proves I committed the crime.\nPhoenix:\nThe very thing... that proves you committed the crime...\nGodot:\nSurely even you understand by now.\nAtmey:\nLordly Tailor provided that camera. There's no way I could have tampered with it. That means I could not have killed Kane Bullard... unless I had an accomplice.\nJudge:\nHmmm...\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, think long and hard about that night...

There's definitely something strange about this picture. We took a look around the basement warehouse that night, before the theft took place.

And peach-colored at that.\nPhoenix:\n(From blood to peaches... The judge sure loves going on his wild tangents.) The problem with this photograph is not the paint.

Are you saying that this is not, in fact, Luke Atmey? That it could be an accomplice dressed up as Mask\u2606DeMasque to create an alibi...?\nAtmey:\nOh ho... What an interesting idea. Are you saying that I, Lone Wolf Luke, had an accomplice?\n\n\n\nName the accomplice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Luke Atmey was at KB Security during the murder... ...then the Mask\u2606DeMasque in this picture has to be a fake.) ...Exactly. You had an accomplice!\nGodot:\nNow remember you've said that, Mr. Trite, because there's no going back. If you're making baseless claims, I'll treat you to a penalty itself!\nMaya:\nThat penalty is probably boiling hot, too...\nGodot:\nSo who was it, Mr. Trite!? Who was the accomplice!?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... It was this person.\nGodot:\nHa...! That's quite the prank you're trying to pull... Do you have any evidence that this person is, in fact, the accomplice?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... T-The aura! The aura that this person has around them is...\nJudge:\nIf you're going to judge someone by their aura... ...you'd be right up there as the number one suspect, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Nnrgh... I jumped the gun on that one!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Luke Atmey was at KB Security during the murder... ...then the Mask\u2606DeMasque in this picture has to be a fake.)\nMaya:\nThen there really was an accomplice!\nPhoenix:\nBut right now, I have no idea who it was.\nMaya:\nHmm... I don't have any idea right now either. \nPhoenix:\n(Baseless objections are just what that guy wants... There's got to be another way... And I'm going to find it!)\nLeads back to cross-examinationAtmey:\nI had more than enough time to prepare. It was a pathetically easy job.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe Adrian Andrews hired you at one point?\nAtmey:\nThat's right... That was over 20 days ago, if I'm not mistaken.\nPhoenix:\nYou sent the calling card to Lordly Tailor 10 days before the heist... That would mean you seat out the card after you began your security watch, right?\nAtmey:\nIndeed. There was no reason why I couldn't do both jobs at once. It was the perfect opportunity to steal my latest target.\nJudge:\nI see... You truly are evil, aren't you?\nAtmey:\nYes. Evil is what I am...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... Isn't there something odd about this?\nPhoenix:\nHm?\nMaya:\nDetective Atmey was always proud of his \"Ace Detective\" skills, right? But if the urn was stolen from Lordly Tailor while he was the only one watching it... ...he'd have no way to maintain his perfect \"Ace Detective\" persona.\nPhoenix:\n(You know, that's true... It is kind of odd.)\nAtmey:\n...Atmey:\nA photograph contains no words... But in this case, one turned out to be my witness.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo by \"photograph\", you mean this piece of evidence here. Is that correct?\nAtmey:\nIndeed it is. That is it! The very thing that proves I committed the crime.\nPhoenix:\nThe very thing... that proves you committed the crime... (When you think about it... It's really odd...) You say that almost as if you had this picture taken on purpose...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHe was simply caught by the very camera that he had set up... We all have days like that.\nAtmey:\nIndeed... It turned out that there was no such thing as the perfect crime after all. Life is truly an ironic thing. A sad, blue melody...\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I'd better gather more information for now... If he's truly the killer... there's got to be something phony in that video.)Press (after pressing second and fourth statements)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo by \"photograph\", you mean this piece of evidence here. Is that correct?\nAtmey:\nIndeed it is. That is it! The very thing that proves I committed the crime.\nPhoenix:\nThe very thing... that proves you committed the crime...\nGodot:\nSurely even you understand by now.\nAtmey:\nLordly Tailor provided that camera. There's no way I could have tampered with it. That means I could not have killed Kane Bullard... unless I had an accomplice.\nJudge:\nHmmm...\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, think long and hard about that night...

I'm not really spotting anything unusual.Phoenix:\nThere are two possibilities... Either the Mask\u2606DeMasque in the photo is a fake... Or the photo itself is.Phoenix:\nThe supervisor of the Treasure Exhibit stated the following.Andrews:\nWell, there's a good reason for that. On the day of the crime, around noon... ...that golden statue just happened to arrive from the mountain training hall.Andrews:\nI realized that the statue would be the perfect size for covering up the paint stains. That's why... I put it where you first saw it.Phoenix:\nI myself was there the night the theft took place, and saw the statue in that spot. If this picture was truly taken on that night, then that statue should've been there!Godot:Godot:\nBut when I went there the day after the theft... ...that statue of the old bag was sitting in the corner.Judge:\nHmmm... Perhaps it was somehow pushed there accidentally...?Phoenix:\nYour Honor, this statue is slightly larger than yourself and quite heavy. It would take more than an accidental push to move it that distance!Godot:\nHa...! In that case... Can you prove it? Can you give us the \"rhyme and reason\" as to why that statue was moved that night?Maya:\nC-Can you do it, Nick?Phoenix:\n(Never mind who moved it... The real question is \"why did they move it\"...)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright. I hope you are prepared with your answer. Now then, who was the one that moved the golden statue on the night of the crime?Present Luke Atmey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The one who moved the statue is none other than... Luke Atmey!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWhat do you think, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nA man should be able to answer his own questions. That's what I think. Right now I'm busy trying to come up with two answers of my own. Why is coffee black? And... Why is it bitter...?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... To put it simply, you've messed up.\nMaya:\nWhat are you doing, Nick!? You need to think about why that statue was moved!\nPhoenix:\n(The good thing about when everyone chews me out is that it gives me time to think!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright. I hope you are prepared with your answer.\"Phoenix:\nThe one who moved the statue is none other than... Luke Atmey!Atmey:\nCome now, Sir Lawyer! There you go again on one of your strange delusions...Judge:\nMr. Wright! What basis do you have for your strange delusions!?Phoenix:\n...It's very simple. The witness was the only one in the basement warehouse that night.Atmey:\nThat is indeed very simple... However! Why would I want to move a heavy golden statue?Phoenix:\n(The reason for moving the golden statue... Here's where our battle really begins.)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? What reason did the witness have to move that statue!?Phoenix:\nThe reason can be found here in this photograph.Atmey:\n...!Phoenix:\nLuke Atmey, You pretended to be Mask\u2606DeMasque... ...to create an alibi by showing you were \"at Lordly Tailor that night\".Atmey:\n...Phoenix:\nBut this photograph contains a single, fatal flaw. If the statue had been there, your lie would be exposed like cheap film at a drug store... That is why you had to move the statue! (Changed from [That is why you moved the statue!] in the original release)Judge:\nA single, fatal flaw? ([flaw] highlighted in the original release)Godot:\nInteresting theory... Please enlighten us. Just where in this picture does this \"lie\" exist!?Present timestamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Naturally... the lie in this photo is the timestamp!\"Present Mask\u2606DeMasque\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe lie... is Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nJudge:\nA-Are you saying that this Mask\u2606DeMasque is a fake!?\nGodot:\nHa...! You know... I really wish you would start acting more responsibly...\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nGodot:\nThe current question is, \"why was the golden statue moved?\" So what possible connection could there with Mask\u2606DeMasque's identity?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh buggers!)\nJudge:\nYour face has \"Oh buggers!\" written all over it. That's a penalty for you!\nGodot:\nI'll ask you again, Mr. Trite.\nLeads back to:\n\"Just where in this picture does this \"lie\" exist!?\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe lie in this photo is somewhere around here!\nGodot:\nJumping to conclusions again? I think you need to take a gander in your logical mirror.\nAtmey:\nAs the Yiddish proverb goes, \"A half-truth is a whole lie\".\nJudge:\nKeep lying like this and you'll be the one on trial.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh man, now they're calling me a liar...!)\nMaya:\nThe question is why was the statue moved, right?\nPhoenix:\nThere was some reason the culprit didn't want the statue in the picture... At least, that's what I thought.\nGodot:\nI'll ask you again, Mr. Trite.\nLeads back to:\n\"Just where in this picture does this \"lie\" exist!?\"Phoenix:\nNaturally... the lie in this photo is the timestamp!Judge:\nWh-What do you mean!?Phoenix:\nI'll tell you exactly what I mean! On the night in question, Luke Atmey went to KB Security and murdered Kane Bullard! Therefore, it's obvious! It would have been impossible for him to have been at Lordly Tailor at this time!Atmey:\n...!Judge:\nBut what does that have to do with the statue being moved...?Phoenix:\nRemember if you will, Your Honor. When was this statue placed besides the warehouse door...?Judge:\nW-Well...Godot:\nThe statue was taken down to the warehouse on the day of the crime... ...and it was placed there in order to cover up the paint.Phoenix:\n...Exactly. Luke Atmey had already decided on the time when he was going to kill the victim. And so, in order to create an alibi for that time... ...he took this picture days before the murder took place!Godot:\nWh-What the...!?Phoenix:\nOf course, the statue hadn't yet been brought down to the basement warehouse yet.Judge:\nAh...Phoenix:\nSo, on the day of the crime, Mr. Atmey must have been quite nervous! As nervous as a long-tailed cat in a rocking chair factory, so to speak. Why? Because something that wasn't supposed to be there... ...had been brought down and placed where it wasn't supposed to be. And that... ...is why Luke Atmey had to move the statue on the night of the murder! He did it to make the room match with the way it had been in his photo!Atmey:\n... GWAAAAAAAH!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Atmey! Is this true!?Atmey:\nOne moment, Your Honor! H-Have you forgotten this?Judge:\nWh-What's that...?Atmey:\nThe data for the basement warehouse computer! According to this, the camera did indeed go off on the night of the crime!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nIt's true that the camera had been set up by the Lordly Tailor staff. However! The program used to manage that data was yours! That alone would have allowed you to tamper with the data!Atmey:\nAh... AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Godot! What is the meaning of this!? Godot! I warned you about making me wait! Now put that coffee down!Godot:\n...My 11th cup. I've promised to drink no more than 17 during a trial. Which means... I'm still good 'til the last drop.Judge:\nHowever, the defense has a very good point!Godot:\n\"A good point\"...? So what? We are all but travelers on a road of infinite points.Maya:\nUm, I think he's got his \"points\" mixed up with his other \"points\"... (Changed from [Um, I think you've got your 'points' mixed up with your other 'points'...] in the original release)Godot:\n...So you say this photograph was taken ahead of time. And that the statue was moved in order to make it match... That's a very interesting idea. However. There's one point that can't be denied.Phoenix:\nWhich is...?Godot:\nThat it's only... a \"possibility\". Men that are trapped by the chains of \"maybe\"... ...can never reach their dreams!Judge:\nTh-That's very true!Phoenix:\nN-No way! Don't fall for that, Your Honor!Godot:\nHey! Mr. DeMasque!Atmey:\nY-Yes!?Godot:\nIf there's no funny business in your actions as Mask\u2606DeMasque... ...there should be no problem with you telling us your strategy. So let's hear it.Judge:\nYes. Please provide this court with your testimony.

You're sure there are no mistakes this time?Atmey:\n...Zvarri.Judge:\nVery well then! Mr. Wright!

It seemed that they had heard of my Zvarrikling reputation.\nPhoenix:\n(I see Ms. Andrews is still attracting the weirdos.) You'd better watch out too, Maya.Atmey:\nThe urn was placed in a box, and Zvarri! It was then sent to the warehouse.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean... this box?\nAtmey:\nYes.

I was looking forward to one of his long-winded stories!\nLeads back to cross-examinationAtmey:\nIt was Mr. Bullard who wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean this blackmail letter right here?\nJudge:\nIt says, \"Bring $50,000\"...\nPhoenix:\nAnd the handwriting is, without a doubt, the victim's?\nGodot:\nThere's no mistake. We have an official report to prove it.\nJudge:\nBut, I don't see an addressee on this letter anywhere.\nPhoenix:\n(An addressee...?)\nGodot:\nThe letter was discovered in Ron DeLite's apartment. And Mr. DeLite did show up at the designated place and time. The fact that there is no addressee is irrelevant.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder...)\nMaya:\nWhat's up, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI just had a thought. What if that blackmail letter wasn't meant for Mr. DeLite?\nMaya:\nWhoa... Do you have any evidence of that?\nPhoenix:\n(For some reason, I just can't shake the feeling... ...that there's something not quite right about this blackmail letter...)\nAtmey:\nWell, everyone? Are you quite satisfied?Present Blackmail Letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMind if I ask you a few questions, Detective Atmey?\nAtmey:\nWell... If-If it's just a \"few\", I guess it's alright.\nPhoenix:\nWhen you said that this letter was \"addressed to Ron DeLite\"... ...I couldn't help but notice one major contradiction.\nAtmey:\nC-Contradiction...?\nGodot:\nI don't know where a walking contradiction like you gets off saying things like that...\nPhoenix:\n(You're one to talk!)\nGodot:\nAt times like these, men are made to express themselves with their fists. Why don't you show us what you've got there, junior?\nJudge:\nIndeed! Time to man up, Mr. Wright. Show us the contradicting evidence in the content of the blackmail letter!\n\n\n\nPresent Newspaper Clipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Take a good look at this newspaper clipping.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! A little two-one punch like that wouldn't even faze me...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI think you mean \"one-two\" punch..\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Try thinking things through a little more before finding fault with others!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... I sure felt that punch, Your Honor... Anyway... Let's try reading the blackmail letter one more time... There's got to be something off about it somewhere...)\nJudge:\nVery well then, witness. Please proceed with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPresent Newspaper Clipping\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Take a good look at this newspaper clipping.\"Atmey:\nAnd it was again Mr. Bullard who harbored a grudge against Mr. DeLite for his betrayal!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by that!?\nAtmey:\nOh my, I was certain you were already aware. ...Zvarri!\n\n\nRon:\nKB Security has a lot of security info on all sorts of companies... And since I was a security team chief... I stole data from the company.\n\n\nAtmey:\n...Kane Bullard had yet to forgive young Mr. DeLite! Which is why he sent him that letter upon mistakenly believing he was the thief.\nGodot:\nHere is a file that we discovered in Me. Bullard's office. Evidence that Mr. Bullard was receiving money through blackmail..\nJudge:\nHmmm... H-However! Isn't this a bit odd!? Why did the defendant pay Mr. Bullard the money... ...even though he wasn't actually Mask\u2606DeMasque...?\nAtmey:\nOn that point, there was an unfortunate bit of chance.Atmey:\nMr. Bullard's mistake is quite excusable. The defendant truly believes he is Mask\u2606DeMasque.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... Do you really think that story is going to hold up?\nAtmey:\nThat assertion is not merely my own, I'm afraid.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nGodot:\nI have here a memo from Ron DeLite's wife, Desir\u00e9e DeLite. \"Ronnie thinks he's Mask\u2606DeMasque! Don't you feel sorry for him? Please don't think too badly of him!\" Ha...! Well, Mr. Trite?\nPhoenix:\nUgh... Was he trying to act like Ms. DeLite just now?\nMaya:\nI thought he was actually pretty convincing.Atmey:\nThat is why Mr. DeLite saw it fit to kill Kane Bullard. Truly a tragedy...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNow that's just your imagination talking!\nAtmey:\nCome now, Sir Lawyer! I'm afraid \"imagination\" isn't the right word for it! This is a deduction. The result of carefully applied reasoning...\nJudge:\nCan we hear that careful reasoning for ourselves?\nAtmey:\n... It's a long story, and better saved for another time.\nJudge:\nHmmm... Very well, another time.\nPhoenix:\n(Those so called \"long stories\" aren't usually all that long. At least, not in my experience.)Maya:\nSo you're going to try to connect Detective Atmey to Mr. Bullard, right?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right. Hopefully it won't require surgery either...Maya:\nIn that case, you'll have to talk about the blackmail...Phoenix:\nThat's true. (Was that blackmail letter really intended for Ron?)Maya:\nSince we don't have enough information, you should press him for more testimony!Phoenix:\n(Maybe I'll able to shake some contradictions loose that way!)Phoenix:\nTake a good look at this newspaper clipping. It contains a picture of the \"Tear of Emanon\", the stolen jewel.Judge:\nWh-What about it?Phoenix:\nThe problem is this jewel's color.Godot:\nColor...? I'm not much for discussing color myself...Phoenix:\nAccording to the clipping, the color of the stolen jewel was \"blue\". However, in the blackmail letter, a totally different jewel is mentioned. \"I'll take that red diamond you received the other day.\"Judge:\nR-Red...!?Phoenix:\nWhich means! The \"red diamond\" described in the blackmail letter... ...is not the \"Tear of Emanon\" that Mask\u2606DeMasque stole at all!Godot:Godot:\nAnd your point is, Mr. Trite!? So you are trying to say that this blackmail letter was intended for someone else. ...That is what you're trying to say!? Right, Trite?Judge:\nThat is what you're trying to say!? Right, Mr. Wright?Maya:\nWell? That is what you're trying to say!? Right, Nick!?Phoenix:\n...Yes. This is who Kane Bullard was actually blackmailing!Present Luke Atmey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Naturally... It was you, Detective Atmey!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\n... I'm impressed, Mr. Wright. That was a first-class joke.\nAtmey:\nI'm afraid I can only rate it second-class myself.\nGodot:\nActually I don't think it had any class at all.\nMaya:\nI could laugh... if I tried.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks everyone, for your undying support... Especially you, Maya. Argh! OK, we've come this far, and I'm definitely not about to let him slide!)\nGodot:\nHey... It looks like you've got some life in you yet... \nLeads back to:\n\"So you are trying to say that this blackmail letter was intended for someone else.\"Phoenix:\nNaturally... It was you, Detective Atmey!Atmey:\n... Do you have some sort of basis for that claim?Phoenix:\nYou have been personally involved in every single Mask\u2606DeMasque case. And in the last case, you \"recovered\" what was stolen... ...and received a \"jewel\"... ...as your reward.Godot:\nA-A jewel...?Phoenix:\nProbably the one wrapped conspicuously around your finger. That red diamond ring!Atmey:\nUnn... Ggg...!Phoenix:\nThat is the diamond referred to in the letter! Which means that Kane Bullard wrote that letter in order to blackmail YOU!Atmey:\nAaaaahhhhh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Um, um... Order, I say...Godot:Godot:\nIt seems... You've gone too far with your childish pranks, Mr. Trite.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh... I don't like the way he said that...)Godot:\nKane Bullard blackmailing Luke Atmey? Are you for real?Phoenix:\nY-Yes. I am.Maya:\nNick! Come on, stand up to him!Godot:\nThen answer me this! The blackmail letter contains the following passage. \"If you don't want your identity revealed to the world\"...!Judge:\nYes, it certainly does.Godot:\nKane Bullard threatened to make Luke Atmey's \"identity\" public knowledge! An \"identity\" he wanted to keep a secret. So just what was that identity!?Phoenix:\n(Atmey killed Kane Bullard because he was afraid of his secret becoming known...! What was the \"identity\" he wanted to keep secret...?)Maya:\nThis is what it all comes down to, Nick!Phoenix:\nThe \"identity\" that Luke Atmey wanted to so desperately keep secret was his identity as...an Ace Detective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLuke Atmey... was an Ace Detective!\nAtmey:\nThank you for the kind introduction. I am Luke Atmey, Ace Detective. One embodies the nefarious forces of darkness. The other the angelic cherubs of light!\nJudge:\n...I am completely lost. Someone get me a translator. *ahem* But anyway, everyone already knows you're an Ace Detective!\nMaya:\nCome on Nick... Are you even trying anymore?\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, I kind of wonder myself...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Kane Bullard threatened to make Luke Atmey's \"identity\" public knowledge!\"Mask\u2606DeMasque.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLuke Atmey... was Mask\u2606DeMasque! ... Wh-What?\nGodot:\nThat's my line.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's that supposed to mean?\nGodot:\n...That's my line, too. Listen up, you. This is what you've been saying up to this point in time. \"The witness pretended to be Mask\u2606DeMasque in order to pin the murder on the defendant.\" In which case! You'll want to insist, up to and beyond the day you die... ...that Ron DeLite was in fact Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nJudge:\nI must say, this sudden change of heart doesn't reflect well on you.\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Wasn't Mr. DeLite the one who was actually Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nOof... OK, I'll try thinking about this again.\nLeads back to:\n\"Kane Bullard threatened to make Luke Atmey's \"identity\" public knowledge!\"a blackmailer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Luke Atmey... was a blackmailer!\"Phoenix:\nLuke Atmey... was a blackmailer!Atmey:\n...!Godot:Godot:\nHey now... Isn't that a little different from what you've been saying? You said that Kane Bullard was the one blackmailing Luke Atmey. Are you saying that Atmey was blackmailing someone else on top of that?Maya:\nUgh... You have to admit, that does sound a little odd...Phoenix:\nIt's not odd. ...It's the only thing that makes any sense. Kane Bullard was blackmailing Luke Atmey. But! Ron DeLite was also being blackmailed by a certain someone!Phoenix:\nSo did you start to receive blackmail letters starting after this incident...?Ron:\nYes. Just a few days after the \"Tear of Emanon\" heist...Ron:\nAfter that, I started getting the plans in the mail. I received plans from some very kind person! Incredibly detailed plans!Judge:\n\"Detailed plans\"... In which case, that would mean that Ron DeLite was actually Mask\u2606DeMasque...Phoenix:\nThat is what we are claiming. Someone else came up with the plans, and had Mr. DeLite steal his targets for him. And that someone... was none other than Luke Atmey!Atmey:\nSHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.Phoenix:\nWh-What is?Atmey:\nWhen you were in grade school, you received the same report card every year. \"Careless, with the tendency to jump to conclusions\"... Am I wrong?Phoenix:\nH-H-H-How did you...!?Atmey:\nYou say that I, Luke Atmey, was blackmailing Ron DeLite...? In which case, I would naturally know all about his relation to Mask\u2606DeMasque...Phoenix:\nWell, yes.Atmey:\nRon DeLite started receiving plans from his second crime onward, correct? Which means... I learned of his identity when he committed that first crime.Judge:\nGood point.. You certainly couldn't have blackmailed him otherwise.Godot:\nIn that case, let's see some hot, bitter evidence. During the first crime, how did Luke Atmey know that Ron DeLite was Mask\u2606DeMasque?Present Newspaper Clipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I think I see it...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please don't just throw out any piece of evidence you like.\nGodot:\nThe only thing a man should throw when he's frustrated is a hissy fit.\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, there's no need to overthink this! How did Luke Atmey find out who Mask\u2606DeMasque was...? That answer has got to be staring me right in the face!)\nJudge:\nHmm... Judging by your expression, it seems you haven't given up.\nLeads back to:\n\"In that case, let's see some hot, bitter evidence.\"Phoenix:\nI think I see it...Atmey:\nSee what...?Phoenix:\nWhen you were in grade school, you received the same report card every year. \"Gets into lots of mischief trying to be the center of attention.\"Atmey:\nWh-What do you mean...!?Phoenix:\n...This newspaper clipping. It has a picture of you and Ron DeLite on his guard uniform. It seems that Mask\u2606DeMasque didn't just disappear into thin air. He just took off his outfit... and hid it in a bucket.Judge:\nThat... That sounds far too stupid to be true.Phoenix:\nCorrect. With tricks like that he couldn't fool a baby, let alone an Ace Detective. And that's when you figured it out, Mr. Atmey! That's when you learned that under his mask, Mask\u2606DeMasque was really Ron DeLite!Atmey:\nGgg... Nnn... Urkk...What the... Wasn't he supposed to be Mask\u2606DeMasque...?\nNot only that... it looks like he wasn't even an Ace Detective!\nI can't believe it. He was just a slimy blackmailer...\nWhat a fraud! Trying to pass himself off as an Ace Detective...Atmey:\n............ Why you! How dare you expose me like that...!Phoenix:\n...Atmey:\nWhy I... I mean, I've never blackmailed anyone in my life...! I-I'm a famous and proud Ace Detective, and... and also Mask\u2606DeMasque! Why can't you understand that!?Phoenix:\nI'm afraid you are neither a proud thief, nor an Ace Detective.

What do you...!? (Changed from [Wh... Where do you...!?] in the original release)Godot:\nIt's true that you've proven a lot of things. ...Things like Luke Atmey was a filthy blackmailer. ...And that he wasn't at Lordly Tailor the night of the murder.Phoenix:\nThat's right! That's why he's the one who killed Mr. Bull--Godot:\nBut... There's still one thing you have yet to prove.Judge:\nWhat's that...?Godot:\nJust because he wasn't at the warehouse doesn't mean he was at the murder scene. Therefore, if you can't prove that this pitiful excuse for a man was at KB Security... ...then I don't see how a verdict can be delivered!Phoenix:\nNo... No waaaaaaaaaay!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! ...Well, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n(Th-This is it... This is the final round...!) I've got to prove that Atmey was at Mr. Bullard's office on that night...Maya:\nB-But...! Can you really prove that?Godot:\nThat's long enough. Mr. Trite... I want to hear your answer.Phoenix:\nThat night, Luke Atmey was at KB Security, and the defense...can prove it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defense can prove it! With evidence!\nJudge:\nAre you sure?\nGodot:\nHa...! Don't you worry. I'll watch over you. ...As you break down and fall to pieces.\nJudge:\nVery well then, let's see this proof!

It seems that love wins out in the end after all! I am the Ace Detective as well as Mask\u2606DeMasque! My verdict will verify that! Just as Ron DeLite's will verify that he is the true murderer!

At this rate, Ron is...)Maya:\nD-Don't give up now, Nick! We still have tomorrow! We can look for more evidence and...Phoenix:\nBy then, it'll be too late...Maya:\nHuh? Wh-Why!?Godot:\n\"Double Jeopardy\"... One of the basic rules of any court of law.Maya:\n\"Double Jeopardy\"...?Judge:\n\"Should a defendant be tried and found innocent in court... That defendant cannot be tried again for the same crime.\" This is a fundamental rule of all courts. And it applies to this witness as much as it applies to anyone else.Godot:\nMr. Atmey will be found guilty in a matter of minutes. Guilty as \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\". Which means...Judge:\nHe will be innocent as far as the murder of Kane Bullard is concerned.Maya:\nNo way...Judge:\nThe fact that you were unable to prove Mr. Atmey's guilt of that crime here... ...means that he will never again be tried as Kane Bullard's murderer.Phoenix:\nU... Uwaaaaaaaaaah!Phoenix:\n(Now there's nothing I can possibly do to win... Even if Ron is proclaimed to be innocent... ...the real killer, Luke Atmey, will go free.)Judge:\nYou have cross-examined every statement the witness has made here today. And as long as there is no more testimony... I'm afraid I have to declare that there will be no further questioning of this witness! Are there any objections? Then I hereby end the cross-examination of Luke Atmey!???:???:\nI think... I see it. Your Honor.

The testimony's not over yet.Phoenix:\nWh... What do you mean?Mia:\nYour Honor! Just now you said something very interesting. \"You have cross-examined every statement the witness has made here today.\"Judge:\nY-Yes, that's true, but...Mia:\nUnfortunately, Your Honor, you're forgetting something. Earlier, after the last cross-examination... ...this witness made a number of remarks!Atmey:\nWell now, Sir Lawyer! It seems that love wins out in the end after all! I am the Ace Detective as well as Mask\u2606DeMasque! My verdict will verify that! Just as Ron DeLite's will verify that he is the true murderer! I declare that with the full force of my Ace Detective-ness!Judge:\nY-Yes, but... These comments appear to have no importance whatso--Mia:\nVery well... Then we shall prove their importance via cross-examination. At any rate! As long as the witness has made these remarks... ...we, the defense, assert our right to question them! Is that alright with you... Prosecutor?Godot:\n......Judge:\nIs something the matter? Mr. Godot...Godot:\n...! Ah, nothing.Atmey:\nOh, Sir Lawyer! It looks like you're one step too late! If you think such falsehoods will do anything to me, Luke At--Godot:\n...Let's hear it.Atmey:\nHuh...?Godot:\nIt's true that the witness made some \"remarks\". So then... Let's hear this last bit of cross-examination.Atmey:\nM-Mr. Godot! What are you...?Judge:\nVery well then. Mr. Luke Atmey.

Why?\nThe victim would have left prints if he sounded it.

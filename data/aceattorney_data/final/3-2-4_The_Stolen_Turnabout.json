They're here for the trial next door!Phoenix:\n\"Next door\"...?Maya:\nWhy don't you know this, Nick? *sigh* They're having Detective Atmey's trial today!Phoenix:\nDetective Atmey...?Maya:\nThey say they're going to try him as Mask\u2606DeMasque.Phoenix:\nAlready? That was fast...Maya:\nBoy, I'd love to see Mask\u2606DeMasque's trial.???:\n...I know...Phoenix:\nBy the way, where's Pearls?Maya:\nOh, she went back home. She said she can't neglect her training anymore.???:\n...I know you don't like me...Phoenix:\nPearls has really gotten into her training lately, huh?Maya:\nYeah... Ever since... ...that incident last year.Ron:\nPleeeeease! Don't ignore meeee!Maya:\n...Oh, Mr. DeLite! Good morning!Ron:\nNo one likes me... No one would notice me, even if I killed someone...Maya:\nCome on, don't be silly! ... W-Wait a sec!Phoenix:\nYou don't mean... You're the murderer...!?Ron:\nN-N-N-No, no! I'm just a poor thief! ... No, wait, that's not right. A thief can't really be \"poor\"Phoenix:\n(Now, let's see... According to Mr. DeLite... From his second crime on, he was following a bunch of set plans. Plans that someone had been sending to him to \"help\" him commit the heists.)Maya:\nDo you think there's a connection between the thief and the murder, Nick?Phoenix:\nIt's possible... But today's trial is a race against the clock.Maya:\nHuh? How come? Let's just take our time like always.Phoenix:\nI'm afraid... That's not an option.Maya:\n...?October 14, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 6Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Ron DeLite.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\nYou're \"ready\"? Preparation is the last refuge of the week.Judge:\n...OK, settle down everyone. Let's begin with your opening statement, Mr. Godot.Phoenix:\n(Ugh... He's got the judge in the palm of his hands... Yet again...)Godot:\nRon DeLite is simply too young to be sent to war. ...That's all.Judge:\n... I'm afraid I have no idea what that means, Mr. Godot.Godot:\nHa...! Then you need to get out more, Your Honor. Life is war. But that is exactly why you must be more precise in your wording. That's all my statement means. You understand now, right?Judge:\n...Yes. Well then, let me briefly summarize the details of this case.Phoenix:\n(Wow... The judge is taking charge like he knows what's going on for a change...)Judge:\nThe victim is Kane Bullard, CEO of KB Security. His body was found in a safe at approximately 9 AM on the morning of the 13th. However, the time of death was estimated as 1 AM of the previous day.Godot:\nAnd... that's when our little lost kitten dropped the ball. That little lost kitten is, of course, the defendant.Judge:\nVery well then, Mr. Godot. Please call your first witness.Godot:\nI never drink more than 17 cups of coffee during any given trial. But the first one... is always the best.Judge:\nUm, Mr. Godot... Your witness...?Godot:\n...OK, then. Let's hear what the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite, has to say for himself.Judge:\nThe defendant...? Well, Mr. Wright? Does the defense have any objections? It may be a bit of a disadvantage having the defendant testify, but...Phoenix:\n(I remember when Mia was defending me... She allowed me to testify so she could do the cross-examination... She put a lot of trust in me back then...) We have no objections, Your Honor. The defense will allow Mr. DeLite to testify.Godot:\nHa...! You've got guts, Trite.Judge:\nAlright then, Mr. Ron DeLite, please take the stand!Godot:\n...You did it. Didn't you?Ron:\nYes.Phoenix:\nWhat?Ron:\nUh... No no no no no no no! Th-Th-Th-That's not true!Judge:\n...Hmm. For a moment there I thought we'd set the record for the shortest trial ever.Maya:\n*sigh* Well, Mr. DeLite already looks plenty guilty with that face he's making...Phoenix:\nAnd once he opens his big mouth he'll probably put the last nail in his own coffin...Godot:\nHa...! Very well. Now then... Can you tell me something? If you didn't kill Bullard, why did you go to KB Security?Ron:\nW-W-Well, I... That's kind of hard to say. Boy, I wish I could go homeJudge:\nNow then, let's hear some testimony about what happened!Witness Testimony-- My Visit To KB Security --Ron:\nThat evening, around 1 AM, I went to see Mr. Bullard in his office at KB Security.\nThe blackmail letter I got... It ordered me to go there.\nI'd been working for KB Security until a year ago, so I knew where his office was.Judge:\n1 AM... The exact time the murder took place.Godot:\nThe weak get washed away by the tides of fate... The strong drink it up. Ha...! It's bitter today, too... Just like my destiny.Maya:\nYou'd never know that from the way he's chugging it down.Judge:\nMr. Wright... Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross Examination",

You were the one who stole company secrets only one year earlier.\nRon:\nB-B-But... That was all over with once I was fired! But it is true that the fact I stole secrets was kept under wraps... Even so, there was no reason for me to pay up now, a whole year later!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Is that really true?)\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that Ron was stealing company data... I wonder if he would've had a problem if that ever became public knowledge...?\n\n\n\nNot especially.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...Nah, I guess not.\nMaya:\nBut didn't you just say he might!?\nPhoenix:\nAlways avoid unpleasant or inconvenient facts... That's one of my rules.\nMaya:\nDon't try to get out of this by acting all cool!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nYes, he would.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... I believe you would have been in considerable trouble... ...if your identity as a company data thief was made public.\nRon:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Wright! What are you trying to do by bullying your own client!?\nGodot:\nHa...! Men are like colonies of bacteria. The more heat you apply, the faster they grow.\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's exactly right!\nGodot:\nWell then, feel free to keep up the heat, my little lawyer amigo!\nPhoenix:\nL-Little lawyer amigo...?\nGodot:\nYes, now come on. Provide some evidence to back up your assertion. Why would Mr. DeLite want to keep his data stealing secret from going public!?\n\n\n\nPresent Desir\u00e9e DeLite profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite...

Well, Mr. Defendant?\nRon:\n...!\nJudge:\n...You heard the defendant.\nPhoenix:\n(Just when I thought it wasn't possible, a whole new level of irritation rises before me...)\nJudge:\nIt looks like the defense was just playing with himself.\nPhoenix:\n(Do you think you could rephrase that, Your Honor...? For my sake...?)\nJudge:\nWell, let's get back to the testimony, shall we?\nLeads back to cross-examinationPresent Desir\u00e9e DeLite profile (after adding statement \"He fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite...

You?\nGodot:\nAnd yet... A year ago, you were fired without notice... Revenge for an old grudge? A perfect motive for murder, wouldn't you say?\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(This isn't good. Maybe I should change the subject...?)\n\n\n\nLike after being fired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you do after being fired from KB Security?\nRon:\nI spent a lot of time looking for work... But then I decided I wanted to start something myself.\nPhoenix:\n(Not good! This is going from bad to worse...)\nRon:\nSo I started looking at books, TV, and movies, learning all I could about masked men.\nJudge:\nM-Masked men...?\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nS-So you wanted to try drawing a comic, right? ...About masked men!\nRon:\nNo no, that's not right. I wanted to become--\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Let's move along, shall we!?\nJudge:\nBut you asked the question... You're being quite odd today, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Way to bring the spinning buzz saw one notch closer to your own neck, Ace Attorney.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhy he was fired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite. Please tell us why you were fired from your job.\nRon:\nW-Well...\nGodot:\nThe world is filled with those who have said, \"I wish I had never asked that.\"\nPhoenix:\nO-OK, then I take it ba--\nJudge:\n...Defendant. Please answer the question.\nRon:\nI... Well. I needed money.\nJudge:\nYou needed money...?\nRon:\nUm, well, you see... Dessie loves to spend it. It's kind of her hobby...\nMaya:\nNot exactly the best hobby in the world, huh, Nick?\nRon:\nMy salary wasn't nearly enough... So, I stole data from the company.\nPhoenix:\n...Come again?\nRon:\nKB Security has a lot of security info on all sorts of companies... And since I was a security team chief...\nGodot:\nYou stole some data... and sold it.\nRon:\nMr. Bullard found out, and I was fired immediately.\nPhoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaa! (I wish I had never asked that...)\nRon:\nI was somehow able to keep it secret, and made it seem like I had quit on my own.\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick? You don't look so good.\nGodot:\nSomeone who brings harm to their company is fired as punishment. You'd well to remember that.\nMaya:\n...He sure told you.\nJudge:\nSo you admit that you stole data from your company, is that correct?\nRon:\nY-Yes. I'm sorry...\nJudge:\nThis is a very important fact. Please add it to your testimony!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh man... This whole thing just took a big turn for the worse, crashed, and blew up. ...It's gonna take the jaws of life to rip this case from the clutches of disaster.)\nAdds statement \"He fired me for selling company secrets... but Dessie doesn't know about that.\"\n\n\n\n\nDon't say anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I should just avoid this whole subject...

What else?\nPhoenix:\nWasting money, huh...?\nRon:\nIt's not a waaaaaste!\nMaya:\nSo Ms. DeLite doesn't know that her husband was fired, does she?\nPhoenix:\nSo it would seem.\nMaya:\nI'm not sure what to think about couples who keep secrets like that from each other.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe it. This case has gotten even Maya to think seriously about couples...)\nJudge:\nPlease try to stay focused, Mr. Wright.Maya:\nHmm... There wasn't much to his testimony, was there?Phoenix:\nSounds like he's avoiding something... At least, that's what it sounds like to me.Maya:\nUh oh. I've got a bad feeling about this... We'd better be careful.Phoenix:\nBut if we don't find a way to make him spill the beans... ...we'll never get closer to the truth.Maya:\nYeah...Phoenix:\nMr. DeLite... What you said just now doesn't match what you told me yesterday.Ron:\nHuh...? What doesn't?Phoenix:\nI think you must have been scared... Very scared.

She's...!Godot:\n...Looks like if I just sit back and relax, the fun will end before it truly begins.Phoenix:\n(Grr! Godot!)Godot:\nYes, we know. It was all your wife's fault.Judge:\nWhat do you mean...?Godot:\nMr. DeLite stole company data to pay for his wife's spending habit, for which he was fired. Unable to face his own wife, someone used this dirty little secret to blackmail him. And that is how this murder came about!Judge:\nOh... Hmm...!Phoenix:\n(No! Everything is falling neatly into place for him!)Ron:\nD-Don't talk about my Dessie like that... Or you'll be sooooooorry!!Judge:\nWell, it seems... ...that we've learned a great deal of things here, so far.Maya:\nWhat do you think, Nick?Phoenix:\nI didn't think it was possible to get so thoroughly whipped in just 20 minutes...Judge:\nClearly there was sufficient motive for murder. He stole data for his wife, and he killed to protect his secret... A family man who cared just a little too much.Godot:\nThe motive is clear. Let's move on.Phoenix:\nUgggh...Godot:\nWhat happened at the crime scene at 1 in the morning, Mr. DeLite? Come now! Tell us!

Suddenly hit on the forehead, huh? I believe the detective from yesterday provided similar testimony. He said that Mask\u2606DeMasque struck him on the head from behind.Phoenix:\n(Of course, since Atmey turned out to be the culprit himself, that was all a lie.)Godot:\nHa...! No one's going to believe a pathetic lie like that.Ron:\nWh-What are you saying!? I really was attacked!Judge:\nWe'll find out if what you say is true or not during the cross-examination.Godot:\nGot that, Mr. Trite? Don't go easy just because he's your client. If I see any sign that you are, I'll treat you to another cup of my special blend!Phoenix:\nYou don't need to worry about that, Mr. Godot... (I have faith in Ron...

Oh, did I forget to mention it before...? Just to be on the safe side, I dressed as Mask\u2606DeMasque!

He never told me this!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't recall him ever mentioning it to me either...)\nGodot:\nEven I didn't know that. It seems our little friend really loves to keep secrets.\nRon:\nI'm sorry. I just never had a chance to mention it up until now... Wait. That's not right. Umm... You know how sometimes things just slip your mind\nGodot:\nHa...! My 6th cup of coffee is staring up at me coldly.\nJudge:\nAt any rate, we can't ignore this new piece of information. Witness!

What do you mean by \"took a lot longer\"...?\nRon:\nOh, opening the safe, of course. My cape got caught on the safe door, you see. This all happened when I was hiding Mr. Bullard's body...\nJudge:\nWh-Wh-What was that!? Back up a second!\nRon:\n...Yes?\nJudge:\nYou were the one that hid the body in the safe!?\nRon:\nUm, well... Yeah.\nJudge:\nInconceivablllllle! Why!? Just... Why!? What reason could you have!? What were you thinking!?\nGodot:\nQuestion. When does someone toss their dirty shorts in the washing machine?\nJudge:\nUh... What?\nGodot:\nThe answer is simple. When they take them off.\nJudge:\n... As usual, I have no idea what you're saying.\nPhoenix:\nDo you mean that Mr. DeLite hid the body because he's the murderer?\nGodot:\nHa...! So you're not as stupid as you look!\nMaya:\nHis metaphor this time was really obscure...\nJudge:\n... Mr. Wright, you don't mean... ...that you knew about this whole safe business, do you!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, well... Yes.\nJudge:\nWhy am I the only one not in the loop here!? Witness! Make sure you add this to the testimony!\nRon:\nY-Yes, sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh...

It took about 10 minutes.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you dressed up as Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nRon:\nWhy... because I'm Mask\u2606DeMasque, of course.\nJudge:\nW-What are you talking about!?

Mr. Bullard was lying there... dead!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"When you came to\"...?\nRon:\nYes. I was passed out in the corner of the room.\nPhoenix:\nDo you know when your assailant made their escape, and to where...?\nRon:\nI-I'm afraid... I don't really remember.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nRon:\nOnce they hit me, I lost all track of what was going on. I think that's when they made their escape...\nGodot:\nHa...! That's certainly a convenient story for you, isn't it?\nJudge:\nIt certainly is, isn't it, Mr. Wright? It almost sounds... practiced.\nPhoenix:\nI-I don't know why you're telling me...Ron:\nI panicked and hid the body in the safe. It took about 10 minutes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you hide the body in the safe anyway?\nRon:\nWell... Because it wouldn't fit in a drawer.\nPhoenix:\nUh, that's not exactly what I meant...\nRon:\nWhen I saw that corpse, I kind of lost it. I thought, \"If they find his corpse, they'll think I did it!\"\nGodot:\nHa...! I think you had a simpler reason than that. It's because you killed him! That's why you spent 10 minutes hiding the body.\nJudge:\nHmmm... That certainly makes more sense.\nPhoenix:\nNngh... (Hold on... \"10 minutes\"...?)\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI just had a thought... Under those circumstances, would you normally try to hide the body...? And spend 10 whole minutes to do it?\nMaya:\nUnder \"those circumstances\"? What circumstances...? ...Oh! Hey, Nick! If you think his behavior was so strange... ...why don't you present some evidence that would show just what those circumstances were!\nPhoenix:\n(That's it! I'll take a look at the Court Record, and present some evidence!)Present CEO Office Buzzer, Buzzer Record, or Larry Butz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, could you please take a look at this record?\"Maya:\nWe heard this from Mr. DeLite yesterday, didn't we?Phoenix:\nThere's not much in this testimony either.Maya:\nI betcha he's still hiding something.Phoenix:\nI wouldn't be surprised. We'll just have to draw it out of him.Maya:\nI just hope he doesn't make things any more complicated...Phoenix:\nYour Honor, could you please take a look at this record?Judge:\nAnd what might this be?Phoenix:\nThe record for the emergency buzzer that connects the CEO's office to security. If the button in the office is pressed, a security team is supposed to come running...Godot:\n...Phoenix:\nAnd according to this record, the buzzer was pushed once, at 1:02 AM!Judge:\nWh... Whaaat?Phoenix:\nIf Mr. Ron DeLite truly was the murderer... ...he would have ran as soon as that buzzer sounded! After all, a security guard would've been heading his way!Godot:Godot:\nHa...! Let's remember who we're dealing with here. He probably had no idea there were security personnel in the building!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nUp until one year ago, my client was working as a chief of security! There's no way he wouldn't have known about them!Godot:Godot:\nBut! As it turns out, the guard never came.Phoenix:\nThat was nothing more than a coincidence! The fact that the guard was a pathetic loser... ...who had just gotten punched in the face by his ex's new boyfriend... ...and wasn't anywhere in the vicinity was not something Mr. DeLite could have known!Godot:Godot:\nHa...! Again, remember who we're dealing with here. It's a sure bet that Mr. DeLite didn't even notice the buzzer going off!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThis buzzer is extremely loud. There is no way he could've ignored something like that! IF he had been conscious, that is.Judge:\n\"Conscious\"...? What do you mean by that!?Godot:\n... Ugh...! Fine. Let's hear your theory.Phoenix:\nRemember the defendant's testimony. The moment he entered the victim's office, someone attacked him... Mr. DeLite said he felt \"dazed\"... I'm willing to wager that he was knocked unconscious for at least a few minutes.Judge:\nUnconscious...? So he fainted!?Phoenix:\nThat's why Mr. DeLite didn't know that the buzzer had sounded. And that's why... he thought he had time to hide the body!Godot:\nS-So what are you trying to say...!?Phoenix:\nMr. DeLite was knocked out, and the buzzer went off soon afterwards... Now, unless my client was able to hit the buzzer while he was unconscious... It can only mean that there was another person in that room! That's right! Whoever it was knocked out Ron DeLite and then pressed the buzzer!Judge:\nO-Order in the court! Mr. Wright! This... This is...!Godot:Godot:\nTh-This is preposterous! It was this kid... ...Ron DeLite, is the one who killed Kane Bullard!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThen who pressed the buzzer?Godot:\nI-It was... The victim, of course! He pressed the buzzer when the defendant attacked him! He didn't die right away! He must have held on long enough to push that button!Phoenix:\nACK!!Judge:\nHmmm... So Kane Bullard sounded the buzzer himself... What is your opinion on this, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n(I need to prove that the real criminal was there at the scene! But how? Can I prove that it wasn't Kane Bullard who sounded the buzzer?)I can prove it alright.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The defense's opinion is this, Your Honor!\"I'm not ready yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defense... admits there is no evidence to the contrary. It is possible that the victim himself sounded the buzzer...\nGodot:\nHa...! \"Possible\"? More like \"definite\", Mr. Trite.\nJudge:\nWhich means... Only two people were there at the crime scene after all.\nGodot:\nThe victim, Kane Bullard, and his killer... Mr. DeLite.\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! If you can't prove that the \"real killer was there\"... ...this trial is as good as finished!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! I guess I need to show some sort of evidence after all...!)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense's opinion is this, Your Honor!\"Phoenix:\nThe defense's opinion is this, Your Honor! This piece of evidence proves that it wasn't the victim who sounded the buzzer!Present CEO Office Buzzer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I believe this is the piece of incontrovertible evidence you were looking for!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWell, what do you think, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nHa...! I can hear it... The sound of a buzzer!\nJudge:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nIt's going off inside your head at this very moment. ...The emergency buzzer of your heart!\nMaya:\nIs it really?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe just a little.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! You need to think more carefully!\nMaya:\nOof... Guess there goes your chance to become an \"Ace Detective\".\nPhoenix:\nCome, listen more carefully! Maybe the truth will be elegantly revealed...?\nMaya:\nCreepy... You sound like Detective Atmey...\nLeads back to:\n\"The defense's opinion is this, Your Honor!\"Phoenix:\nI believe this is the piece of incontrovertible evidence you were looking for!Judge:\nTh-The emergency buzzer...? Is there some kind of clue on it?Phoenix:\nAbsolutely not.Godot:\nHey, come on now... At least give some thought to what you say before opening your mouth.Phoenix:\nThe fact that there are absolutely no clues... is itself the clue.Judge:\nNow I'm the one who's clueless!Phoenix:\nThis button has no fingerprints on it. If Mr. Bullard had really pressed it himself... ...naturally, he would have left his fingerprints behind!Godot:\nPhwoooooooooooh!!Godot:Godot:\nR...Ron DeLite... obviously wiped them off!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nWhy would he? A guard could have come in at any moment!Godot:\nHe touched that button! I know he did!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThe defendant, Mr. DeLite, was dressed as Mask\u2606DeMasque. And Mask\u2606DeMasque... always wears gloves! What reason could he possibly have had to wipe the button free of fingerprints!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!Godot:\nHa...! It would seem... I've been forced to eat crow!Maya:\nI wonder what blend number crow-flavored coffee is?Judge:\nHowever, if the real killer was there at the scene... ...why would that person press the emergency buzzer?Phoenix:\n...Judge:\nShouldn't they have run away without putting themselves in extra danger?Phoenix:\n...Judge:\n......Phoenix:\n.........Judge:\nWhat's with this awkward silence all of a sudden!?Godot:\nHa...! It looks like you're fresh out of parlor tricks.Maya:\nThey're on to you, Nick!Phoenix:\nJ-Just give me a minute to collect my thoughts...! The real culprit killed Mr. Bullard at around 1 AM.Maya:\nAnd Mr. DeLite just happened to waltz in when the murder was taking place, right?Phoenix:\nThe killer clobbered Mr. DeLite, and then sounded the buzzer.Maya:\nEven though security was supposed to respond right away if the buzzer was pressed.Phoenix:\n(\"Security was supposed to respond\"? Hmm...)Judge:\n...Time's up, Mr. Wright. Let's hear what you have to say.Phoenix:\nVery well then...Godot:\nOh ho... You've got some guts. I like that in an opponent.Judge:\nWhy did the \"real killer\" sound the emergency buzzer?They didn't mean to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIn all probability... the killer didn't mean to press it.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean...?\nPhoenix:\nIt's possible that they simply pressed it by accident. It could have been with their back during the scuffle, for example.\nRon:\nAha! That must be why there weren't any fingerprints!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Is there a functioning brain underneath all that ridiculous hair, Mr. Trite?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nThe accused testified that he was hit as soon as he entered the room. In other words, as far away from the buzzer as he could possibly be at the time!\nPhoenix:\n...Ack!\nJudge:\nIt would seem you've been taken for a ride, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! One more time! I've got to calm down and think quick!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Why did the \"real killer\" sound the emergency buzzer?\"To call the security guard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The killer knew that if they pressed that button, a guard would come running.\"To find out what it did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIn all probability... the killer didn't know what the button was for.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean...?\nPhoenix:\nThe killer probably thought, \"I wonder what this does?\" and pressed it to find out!\nRon:\nOh! That's exactly how I make a lot of my mistakes, too!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Is there a functioning brain underneath all that ridiculous hair, Mr. Trite?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nThe panel around the button is labeled quite clearly. It says, \"Emergency Buzzer\".\nPhoenix:\nDoh!\nGodot:\nLet me guess. Maybe next, you'll want to claim this mysterious \"killer\" was illiterate?\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! One more time! I've got to calm down and think quick!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Why did the \"real killer\" sound the emergency buzzer?\"Phoenix:\nThe killer knew that if they pressed that button, a guard would come running. And that was exactly what they wanted.Judge:\nD-Do you mean to say the killer called the guard on purpose!?Phoenix:\nYes... Although as it turned out, he never showed up.Maya:\nBecause he was getting his clock cleaned at the time...Godot:\nHa...! What a touching story! You're saying the killer had a change of heart and called the guard to turn himself in?Phoenix:\nNo, I'm not. When that buzzer sounded, there were three people in that office. The victim, Kane Bullard, who was already dead. The defendant, Ron DeLite, who was out cold. And... The third person. The real killer.Judge:\n...Hypothetically, yes.Phoenix:\nNow then... In this situation, if the real killer made an escape, what would happen? The only ones left in the room would be the victim, and Ron DeLite...Ron:\nAnd... And if any security guards came running in at that time... They would think that I was the murderer!Phoenix:\nYes! That was precisely the real killer's objective. To frame Ron DeLite for the murder!Godot:\nPhwooooooooooh!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!Godot:\nHa...! It would seem... I've been made to eat my words once again!Maya:\nActually you've been made to do a spit-take... with a cup of coffee.Ron:\nM-Mr. Wright! Who was it!? Who was it that tried to frame me!? Err... Wait. Wait a second... I'm the one and only Mask\u2606DeMasque, soMaya:\nNick! You mean the real killer is...!?Phoenix:\nWe're going to drag that person in here right now!Maya:\nBut, but! Who is it?Phoenix:\nI don't have any solid proof yet... but think about it. The killer knew Mr. DeLite's identity. And they also knew... ...that he had been called to KB Security that night... So, the killer used him to execute a well-crafted plan to murder Kane Bullard!Judge:\nHmm, now then. Let's hear your accusation, Mr. Wright. Who was it framed Mr. Ron DeLite for the murder of Kane Bullard!?Present Luke Atmey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Luke Atmey... He's the only one who could have done it.\"Present Desir\u00e9e DeLite profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNaturally... the true culprit was none other than... Ron DeLite's wife, Desir\u00e9e!\nJudge:\nWh-Whaaaat!? Why that's simply--\nRon:\nM-Mr. Wright!! Have you gone insane...!?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nAren't you forgetting something, Mr. Trite?\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me?\nGodot:\nWhere was Desir\u00e9e DeLite at 1:00 AM that night...?\nMaya:\nAh! That's right! She was at the police station! For almost the entire night!\nGodot:\nShe was being questioned after being stopped for reckless riding... ...I have a record of it here.\nPhoenix:\nAaaah!! (I forgot all about that...)\nJudge:\nIt seems that senility may be setting in early for you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Talk about things you never want to hear this judge say to you...)\nMaya:\nIt looks like you'd better think again.\nLeads back to:\n\"Hmm, now then. Let's hear your accusation, Mr. Wright.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMaya:\nH-Hang on, Nick! Are you saying this is the person who tried to frame Mr. DeLite for the murder?\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah. Who else could it be?\nMaya:\nDid they even know that Mr. DeLite was Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I wonder...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Need I warn you about what will happen of you present irrelevant evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I'd better think this through again...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Hmm, now then. Let's hear your accusation, Mr. Wright.\"Phoenix:\nDetective Luke Atmey... He's the only one who could have done it.Godot:\nAce Detective...Ron:\nLuke Atmey...Judge:\nYou mean... Mask\u2606DeMasque did it...?Phoenix:\nYour Honor, the person being tried in the court next to us... ...is not Mask\u2606DeMasque at all. He is, in actuality... the true murderer of Kane Bullard!Judge:\nOrder! Order!! M-Mr. Wright! Explain yourself!Phoenix:\nTheft and murder... Which is the more serious crime?Judge:\nThey're not even close. Murder is the more serious crime, of course! It's a capital crime subject to a capital punishment.Phoenix:\nPlease remember the trial from yesterday, if you would. When Luke Atmey confessed, there was a huge commotion in the courtroom.Godot:\nOf course. A famous detective was unmasked as... well, as Mask\u2606DeMasque.Phoenix:\nInstead of being convicted of murder, he was found guilty of grand larceny. ...That was his true objective all along.Judge:\nTo be found \"guilty\"...Phoenix:\nMask\u2606DeMasque had the perfect alibi for when the murder took place. He was stealing the urn at Lordly Tailor. ...In other words! Being found guilty as Mask\u2606DeMasque... ...was Luke Atmey's airtight, watertight, and unassailable alibi.Judge:\nA guilty verdict... AS AN ALIBI!?Godot:\nYou know... It's almost time.Judge:\nF-For what?Godot:\nFor Luke Atmey's verdict. It was a pretty simple trial, after all. If we're going to stop this trial and stall that one, we need to do it now. Of course... That's assuming you have proof that the detective was the one who committed the murder.Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nMr. Luke Atmey's trial has indeed attracted the attention of the entire country. If we were to intrude, and failed to provide adequate proof of his true crime...  Mr. DeLite would be left with no grounds for appeal.Phoenix:\n... (Am I really sure about this...?)Godot:\nHa...! A bet's only good when your life's the ante.Ron:\nMr. Wright! I... I believe in you!Phoenix:\nMr. DeLite...Ron:\nSo... So... Please. I'M BEGGING YOOOOOOU!!Phoenix:\n(Thanks... But... My decision will determine the rest of your life! Can I really risk your life like this...?)...Phoenix...Phoenix:\n...! (Wh-What was that...?)...Don't stray Phoenix......For your client... Take the path of trust...Phoenix:\n(Th-That voice... It-It sounds like... M-Mia...!) Your Honor! The defense requests an immediate recess!Godot:\nHa...! So that's your answer, huh?Judge:\nVery well. I've decided as well. This court will now take a 20 minute recess. ...Mr. Wright.

But he's the only one who could have done it.Desir\u00e9e:\nBut, wasn't he at Lordly Tailor that night?Maya:\nNot to mention, we don't exactly know his motive.

Please take the stand.Atmey:\nWell well... How do you do, Sir Lawyer? I never would have thought to see you acting so recklessly.Phoenix:\nI couldn't let them hand down your verdict just yet. Not when it would have given you your perfect alibi. An alibi by the name of \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\"...Atmey:\nI'm sorry. I'm afraid even the great Luke Atmey has no idea what you mean. Of course, I have been in the next courtroom ever since 10 o'clock this morning. ...I'm afraid there's no way I could know what's been going on in here.Judge:\nYou've been in the defendant's seat all day long, correct? Being tried as Mask\u2606DeMasque...Atmey:\nIndeed... It's truly child's play to fool the ignorant masses. Not only did the poor fools ask me to \"protect\" their valuables... ...they even gave me a generous reward upon returning their own property to them. Take this red diamond ring that sparkles upon my divine finger, for example...Phoenix:\nSo you continue to insist that you are, in fact, \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\"?Atmey:\n...Of course.Judge:\nVery well then, Luke Atmey. Let us begin with this simple question. On October 12th at 1 AM. Kane Bullard was murdered. Where were you at that time?Atmey:\nOne without knowledge lacks even the knowledge that he should be ashamed of himself. ...But don't worry. I will not hold it against you, Sir Judge.Judge:\nUm, thanks...Godot:\nAlright, Mr. Atmey... The night of the murder... Speak! ...We're all ears!

Are you saying that this is not, in fact, Luke Atmey? That it could be an accomplice dressed up as Mask\u2606DeMasque to create an alibi...?\nAtmey:\nOh ho... What an interesting idea. Are you saying that I, Lone Wolf Luke, had an accomplice?\n\n\n\nName the accomplice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Luke Atmey was at KB Security during the murder... ...then the Mask\u2606DeMasque in this picture has to be a fake.) ...Exactly. You had an accomplice!\nGodot:\nNow remember you've said that, Mr. Trite, because there's no going back. If you're making baseless claims, I'll treat you to a penalty itself!\nMaya:\nThat penalty is probably boiling hot, too...\nGodot:\nSo who was it, Mr. Trite!? Who was the accomplice!?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... It was this person.\nGodot:\nHa...! That's quite the prank you're trying to pull... Do you have any evidence that this person is, in fact, the accomplice?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well... T-The aura! The aura that this person has around them is...\nJudge:\nIf you're going to judge someone by their aura... ...you'd be right up there as the number one suspect, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Nnrgh... I jumped the gun on that one!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Luke Atmey was at KB Security during the murder... ...then the Mask\u2606DeMasque in this picture has to be a fake.)\nMaya:\nThen there really was an accomplice!\nPhoenix:\nBut right now, I have no idea who it was.\nMaya:\nHmm... I don't have any idea right now either. \nPhoenix:\n(Baseless objections are just what that guy wants... There's got to be another way... And I'm going to find it!)\nLeads back to cross-examinationAtmey:\nI had more than enough time to prepare. It was a pathetically easy job.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe Adrian Andrews hired you at one point?\nAtmey:\nThat's right... That was over 20 days ago, if I'm not mistaken.\nPhoenix:\nYou sent the calling card to Lordly Tailor 10 days before the heist... That would mean you seat out the card after you began your security watch, right?\nAtmey:\nIndeed. There was no reason why I couldn't do both jobs at once. It was the perfect opportunity to steal my latest target.\nJudge:\nI see... You truly are evil, aren't you?\nAtmey:\nYes. Evil is what I am...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... Isn't there something odd about this?\nPhoenix:\nHm?\nMaya:\nDetective Atmey was always proud of his \"Ace Detective\" skills, right? But if the urn was stolen from Lordly Tailor while he was the only one watching it... ...he'd have no way to maintain his perfect \"Ace Detective\" persona.\nPhoenix:\n(You know, that's true... It is kind of odd.)\nAtmey:\n...Atmey:\nA photograph contains no words... But in this case, one turned out to be my witness.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo by \"photograph\", you mean this piece of evidence here. Is that correct?\nAtmey:\nIndeed it is. That is it! The very thing that proves I committed the crime.\nPhoenix:\nThe very thing... that proves you committed the crime... (When you think about it... It's really odd...) You say that almost as if you had this picture taken on purpose...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHe was simply caught by the very camera that he had set up... We all have days like that.\nAtmey:\nIndeed... It turned out that there was no such thing as the perfect crime after all. Life is truly an ironic thing. A sad, blue melody...\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I'd better gather more information for now... If he's truly the killer... there's got to be something phony in that video.)Press (after pressing second and fourth statements)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo by \"photograph\", you mean this piece of evidence here. Is that correct?\nAtmey:\nIndeed it is. That is it! The very thing that proves I committed the crime.\nPhoenix:\nThe very thing... that proves you committed the crime...\nGodot:\nSurely even you understand by now.\nAtmey:\nLordly Tailor provided that camera. There's no way I could have tampered with it. That means I could not have killed Kane Bullard... unless I had an accomplice.\nJudge:\nHmmm...\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, think long and hard about that night... The basement warehouse, and this picture that supposedly captures it... It's got to be here... Isn't there something \"funny\" about this picture?)\n\n\n\nYou bet there is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmey:\nAre you implying that this picture is a fake?\nPhoenix:\nYou bet I am. There's definitely something strange about this picture. We took a look around the basement warehouse that night, before the theft took place. And there's something in this photo that doesn't match my memory of that night!\nJudge:\n...Very well, then let's hear what you have to say! What about this photograph do you find \"funny\"?\n\n\n\nPresent spilled paint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe funny part... is right here!\nJudge:\nWhy, this... this is a bloodstain! Ah! Blood! Now this case is getting interesting!\nPhoenix:\nUmm, not exactly... This stain is actually pink paint.\nJudge:\nOh, just paint... And peach-colored at that.\nPhoenix:\n(From blood to peaches... The judge sure loves going on his wild tangents.) The problem with this photograph is not the paint. The problem is, when you consider the layout of the basement warehouse... It turns out that \"something\" that should be there is nowhere to be seen!\nAtmey:\n...\nJudge:\n...Well, Mr. Wright? What is supposed to be in this picture instead of the paint stains?\n\n\n\nPresent Ami Fey's Golden Statue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The supervisor of the Treasure Exhibit stated the following.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWhat do you think, Mr. Godot?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I thought I'd just kind of throw this out and see... \nJudge:\nI'll have you know I am not a trashcan!\nPhoenix:\n(And I was so close, too...)\nJudge:\nIt seems you've just been wasting our time!\nGodot:\nThat's nothing unusual for this guy...\nJudge:\nVery well then, witness. Proceed with your testimony.\nAtmey:\n...Certainly.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent timestamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis part here!\nJudge:\nYou mean the \"date stamp\"...?\nPhoenix:\nUnfortunately... I'm afraid you can't call this a \"date stamp\"! ...Because there is no sign of \"date\" here at all!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nUnfortunately, I'm afraid you can't call that \"funny\" either, Mr. Trite!\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nGodot:\nWhile a security camera that only records the time leaves something to be desired... ...the Lordly Tailor staff are the ones who set up the camera. It is not the fault of this witness. \nJudge:\nHmm... That's certainly true.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... It looks like I need to approach this from a different angle...)\nJudge:\nVery well then, witness! Let's return to your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPerhaps THIS is the area in question!\nJudge:\nThis \"area\"...? Could you be any more vague?\nGodot:\nHa...! Today's java has a little extra kick to it...\nAtmey:\nIt seems that the funny part... ...lies in the \"area\" of the defense!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch... I better think this through, or I'm gonna fall victim to another drubbing.)\nJudge:\nVery well then, witness! Let's return to your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nNot that I can see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUnfortunately... I don't see anything wrong.\nJudge:\nThat is indeed unfortunate.\nGodot:\nMen, as a species, are doomed to a life of bitterness and frustration.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. I've been thinking...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it, Maya?\nMaya:\nThis photo was taken in that basement warehouse, right? And if this was taken on the same night as when we went to see the Treasure Exhibit... ...then there's one thing here that doesn't add up.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I need to approach this from a different angle...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationAtmey:\nThe time at which the camera captured Mask\u2606DeMasque was the same time as the murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout the camera that took this photograph...\nAtmey:\nOh come now! It's all too clear what you're thinking!\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nAtmey:\nYou think I altered the timestamp on the photograph, don't you?\nGodot:\nI'm afraid that's impossible. The camera was set up by Lordly Tailor. And on top of that... ...it was Lordly Tailor staff that printed that picture's data. Unfortunately for the defense, there's no way that picture could have been altered.\nJudge:\nI see...\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I'd better find something else that could be suspicious...)Maya:\nSo, this alibi is false?Phoenix:\nIt has to be, or he couldn't have killed Mr. Bullard at KB Security.Maya:\nBut... I'm not really spotting anything unusual.Phoenix:\nThere are two possibilities... Either the Mask\u2606DeMasque in the photo is a fake... Or the photo itself is.Phoenix:\nThe supervisor of the Treasure Exhibit stated the following.Andrews:\nWell, there's a good reason for that. On the day of the crime, around noon... ...that golden statue just happened to arrive from the mountain training hall.Andrews:\nI realized that the statue would be the perfect size for covering up the paint stains. That's why... I put it where you first saw it.Phoenix:\nI myself was there the night the theft took place, and saw the statue in that spot. If this picture was truly taken on that night, then that statue should've been there!Godot:Godot:\nBut when I went there the day after the theft... ...that statue of the old bag was sitting in the corner.Judge:\nHmmm... Perhaps it was somehow pushed there accidentally...?Phoenix:\nYour Honor, this statue is slightly larger than yourself and quite heavy. It would take more than an accidental push to move it that distance!Godot:\nHa...! In that case... Can you prove it? Can you give us the \"rhyme and reason\" as to why that statue was moved that night?Maya:\nC-Can you do it, Nick?Phoenix:\n(Never mind who moved it... The real question is \"why did they move it\"...)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright. I hope you are prepared with your answer. Now then, who was the one that moved the golden statue on the night of the crime?Present Luke Atmey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The one who moved the statue is none other than... Luke Atmey!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWhat do you think, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nA man should be able to answer his own questions. That's what I think. Right now I'm busy trying to come up with two answers of my own. Why is coffee black? And... Why is it bitter...?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... To put it simply, you've messed up.\nMaya:\nWhat are you doing, Nick!? You need to think about why that statue was moved!\nPhoenix:\n(The good thing about when everyone chews me out is that it gives me time to think!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright. I hope you are prepared with your answer.\"Phoenix:\nThe one who moved the statue is none other than... Luke Atmey!Atmey:\nCome now, Sir Lawyer! There you go again on one of your strange delusions...Judge:\nMr. Wright! What basis do you have for your strange delusions!?Phoenix:\n...It's very simple. The witness was the only one in the basement warehouse that night.Atmey:\nThat is indeed very simple... However! Why would I want to move a heavy golden statue?Phoenix:\n(The reason for moving the golden statue... Here's where our battle really begins.)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? What reason did the witness have to move that statue!?Phoenix:\nThe reason can be found here in this photograph.Atmey:\n...!Phoenix:\nLuke Atmey, You pretended to be Mask\u2606DeMasque... ...to create an alibi by showing you were \"at Lordly Tailor that night\".Atmey:\n...Phoenix:\nBut this photograph contains a single, fatal flaw.

At least, that's what I thought.\nGodot:\nI'll ask you again, Mr. Trite.\nLeads back to:\n\"Just where in this picture does this \"lie\" exist!?\"Phoenix:\nNaturally... the lie in this photo is the timestamp!Judge:\nWh-What do you mean!?Phoenix:\nI'll tell you exactly what I mean! On the night in question, Luke Atmey went to KB Security and murdered Kane Bullard! Therefore, it's obvious! It would have been impossible for him to have been at Lordly Tailor at this time!Atmey:\n...!Judge:\nBut what does that have to do with the statue being moved...?Phoenix:\nRemember if you will, Your Honor. When was this statue placed besides the warehouse door...?Judge:\nW-Well...Godot:\nThe statue was taken down to the warehouse on the day of the crime... ...and it was placed there in order to cover up the paint.Phoenix:\n...Exactly. Luke Atmey had already decided on the time when he was going to kill the victim. And so, in order to create an alibi for that time... ...he took this picture days before the murder took place!Godot:\nWh-What the...!?Phoenix:\nOf course, the statue hadn't yet been brought down to the basement warehouse yet.Judge:\nAh...Phoenix:\nSo, on the day of the crime, Mr. Atmey must have been quite nervous! As nervous as a long-tailed cat in a rocking chair factory, so to speak. Why? Because something that wasn't supposed to be there... ...had been brought down and placed where it wasn't supposed to be. And that... ...is why Luke Atmey had to move the statue on the night of the murder! He did it to make the room match with the way it had been in his photo!Atmey:\n... GWAAAAAAAH!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Atmey! Is this true!?Atmey:\nOne moment, Your Honor! H-Have you forgotten this?Judge:\nWh-What's that...?Atmey:\nThe data for the basement warehouse computer! According to this, the camera did indeed go off on the night of the crime!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nIt's true that the camera had been set up by the Lordly Tailor staff. However! The program used to manage that data was yours! That alone would have allowed you to tamper with the data!Atmey:\nAh... AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Godot! What is the meaning of this!? Godot! I warned you about making me wait! Now put that coffee down!Godot:\n...My 11th cup. I've promised to drink no more than 17 during a trial. Which means... I'm still good 'til the last drop.Judge:\nHowever, the defense has a very good point!Godot:\n\"A good point\"...? So what? We are all but travelers on a road of infinite points.Maya:\nUm, I think he's got his \"points\" mixed up with his other \"points\"... (Changed from [Um, I think you've got your 'points' mixed up with your other 'points'...] in the original release)Godot:\n...So you say this photograph was taken ahead of time. And that the statue was moved in order to make it match... That's a very interesting idea. However. There's one point that can't be denied.Phoenix:\nWhich is...?Godot:\nThat it's only... a \"possibility\". Men that are trapped by the chains of \"maybe\"... ...can never reach their dreams!Judge:\nTh-That's very true!Phoenix:\nN-No way! Don't fall for that, Your Honor!Godot:\nHey! Mr. DeMasque!Atmey:\nY-Yes!?Godot:\nIf there's no funny business in your actions as Mask\u2606DeMasque... ...there should be no problem with you telling us your strategy.

To be honest, even if a photo was taken... I didn't think it would matter terribly much.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. If this photo is a fake...

But so what?Phoenix:\nTruth be told, there is no way that Mask\u2606DeMasque could have known about this pattern.Atmey:\nWhat do you mean...?Phoenix:\nThis pink, spotted pattern on the urn... is actually nothing more than paint stains.Judge:\nPaint stains...?Phoenix:\nAnd these stains did not appear... ...until after the urn had been taken to Lordly Tailor!Atmey:\nHhhmph...!Godot:\nI'm not finding this joke to be very funny, Mr. Trite!Phoenix:\nThe day that the Sacred Urn was taken to the warehouse... ...the urn was broken due to human error, or should I say an error-prone human.

Do you really think that story is going to hold up?\nAtmey:\nThat assertion is not merely my own, I'm afraid.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nGodot:\nI have here a memo from Ron DeLite's wife, Desir\u00e9e DeLite. \"Ronnie thinks he's Mask\u2606DeMasque! Don't you feel sorry for him? Please don't think too badly of him!\" Ha...! Well, Mr. Trite?\nPhoenix:\nUgh... Was he trying to act like Ms. DeLite just now?\nMaya:\nI thought he was actually pretty convincing.Atmey:\nThat is why Mr. DeLite saw it fit to kill Kane Bullard. Truly a tragedy...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNow that's just your imagination talking!\nAtmey:\nCome now, Sir Lawyer! I'm afraid \"imagination\" isn't the right word for it! This is a deduction. The result of carefully applied reasoning...\nJudge:\nCan we hear that careful reasoning for ourselves?\nAtmey:\n... It's a long story, and better saved for another time.\nJudge:\nHmmm... Very well, another time.\nPhoenix:\n(Those so called \"long stories\" aren't usually all that long. At least, not in my experience.)Maya:\nSo you're going to try to connect Detective Atmey to Mr. Bullard, right?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's right. Hopefully it won't require surgery either...Maya:\nIn that case, you'll have to talk about the blackmail...Phoenix:\nThat's true. (Was that blackmail letter really intended for Ron?)Maya:\nSince we don't have enough information, you should press him for more testimony!Phoenix:\n(Maybe I'll able to shake some contradictions loose that way!)Phoenix:\nTake a good look at this newspaper clipping. It contains a picture of the \"Tear of Emanon\", the stolen jewel.Judge:\nWh-What about it?Phoenix:\nThe problem is this jewel's color.Godot:\nColor...? I'm not much for discussing color myself...Phoenix:\nAccording to the clipping, the color of the stolen jewel was \"blue\". However, in the blackmail letter, a totally different jewel is mentioned. \"I'll take that red diamond you received the other day.\"Judge:\nR-Red...!?Phoenix:\nWhich means! The \"red diamond\" described in the blackmail letter... ...is not the \"Tear of Emanon\" that Mask\u2606DeMasque stole at all!Godot:Godot:\nAnd your point is, Mr. Trite!? So you are trying to say that this blackmail letter was intended for someone else. ...That is what you're trying to say!? Right, Trite?Judge:\nThat is what you're trying to say!? Right, Mr. Wright?Maya:\nWell? That is what you're trying to say!? Right, Nick!?Phoenix:\n...Yes. This is who Kane Bullard was actually blackmailing!Present Luke Atmey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Naturally... It was you, Detective Atmey!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\n... I'm impressed, Mr. Wright. That was a first-class joke.\nAtmey:\nI'm afraid I can only rate it second-class myself.\nGodot:\nActually I don't think it had any class at all.\nMaya:\nI could laugh... if I tried.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks everyone, for your undying support... Especially you, Maya. Argh! OK, we've come this far, and I'm definitely not about to let him slide!)\nGodot:\nHey... It looks like you've got some life in you yet... \nLeads back to:\n\"So you are trying to say that this blackmail letter was intended for someone else.\"Phoenix:\nNaturally... It was you, Detective Atmey!Atmey:\n... Do you have some sort of basis for that claim?Phoenix:\nYou have been personally involved in every single Mask\u2606DeMasque case. And in the last case, you \"recovered\" what was stolen... ...and received a \"jewel\"... ...as your reward.Godot:\nA-A jewel...?Phoenix:\nProbably the one wrapped conspicuously around your finger. That red diamond ring!Atmey:\nUnn... Ggg...!Phoenix:\nThat is the diamond referred to in the letter! Which means that Kane Bullard wrote that letter in order to blackmail YOU!Atmey:\nAaaaahhhhh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Um, um... Order, I say...Godot:Godot:\nIt seems... You've gone too far with your childish pranks, Mr. Trite.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh... I don't like the way he said that...)Godot:\nKane Bullard blackmailing Luke Atmey? Are you for real?Phoenix:\nY-Yes. I am.Maya:\nNick! Come on, stand up to him!Godot:\nThen answer me this! The blackmail letter contains the following passage. \"If you don't want your identity revealed to the world\"...!Judge:\nYes, it certainly does.Godot:\nKane Bullard threatened to make Luke Atmey's \"identity\" public knowledge! An \"identity\" he wanted to keep a secret. So just what was that identity!?Phoenix:\n(Atmey killed Kane Bullard because he was afraid of his secret becoming known...! What was the \"identity\" he wanted to keep secret...?)Maya:\nThis is what it all comes down to, Nick!Phoenix:\nThe \"identity\" that Luke Atmey wanted to so desperately keep secret was his identity as...an Ace Detective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLuke Atmey... was an Ace Detective!\nAtmey:\nThank you for the kind introduction. I am Luke Atmey, Ace Detective. One embodies the nefarious forces of darkness. The other the angelic cherubs of light!\nJudge:\n...I am completely lost. Someone get me a translator. *ahem* But anyway, everyone already knows you're an Ace Detective!\nMaya:\nCome on Nick... Are you even trying anymore?\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, I kind of wonder myself...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Kane Bullard threatened to make Luke Atmey's \"identity\" public knowledge!\"Mask\u2606DeMasque.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLuke Atmey... was Mask\u2606DeMasque! ... Wh-What?\nGodot:\nThat's my line.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's that supposed to mean?\nGodot:\n...That's my line, too. Listen up, you. This is what you've been saying up to this point in time. \"The witness pretended to be Mask\u2606DeMasque in order to pin the murder on the defendant.\" In which case! You'll want to insist, up to and beyond the day you die... ...that Ron DeLite was in fact Mask\u2606DeMasque!\nJudge:\nI must say, this sudden change of heart doesn't reflect well on you.\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Wasn't Mr. DeLite the one who was actually Mask\u2606DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nOof... OK, I'll try thinking about this again.\nLeads back to:\n\"Kane Bullard threatened to make Luke Atmey's \"identity\" public knowledge!\"a blackmailer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Luke Atmey... was a blackmailer!\"Phoenix:\nLuke Atmey... was a blackmailer!Atmey:\n...!Godot:Godot:\nHey now... Isn't that a little different from what you've been saying? You said that Kane Bullard was the one blackmailing Luke Atmey. Are you saying that Atmey was blackmailing someone else on top of that?Maya:\nUgh... You have to admit, that does sound a little odd...Phoenix:\nIt's not odd. ...It's the only thing that makes any sense. Kane Bullard was blackmailing Luke Atmey. But! Ron DeLite was also being blackmailed by a certain someone!Phoenix:\nSo did you start to receive blackmail letters starting after this incident...?Ron:\nYes. Just a few days after the \"Tear of Emanon\" heist...Ron:\nAfter that, I started getting the plans in the mail. I received plans from some very kind person! Incredibly detailed plans!Judge:\n\"Detailed plans\"... In which case, that would mean that Ron DeLite was actually Mask\u2606DeMasque...Phoenix:\nThat is what we are claiming. Someone else came up with the plans, and had Mr. DeLite steal his targets for him. And that someone... was none other than Luke Atmey!Atmey:\nSHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.Phoenix:\nWh-What is?Atmey:\nWhen you were in grade school, you received the same report card every year. \"Careless, with the tendency to jump to conclusions\"... Am I wrong?Phoenix:\nH-H-H-How did you...!?Atmey:\nYou say that I, Luke Atmey, was blackmailing Ron DeLite...? In which case, I would naturally know all about his relation to Mask\u2606DeMasque...Phoenix:\nWell, yes.Atmey:\nRon DeLite started receiving plans from his second crime onward, correct? Which means... I learned of his identity when he committed that first crime.Judge:\nGood point.. You certainly couldn't have blackmailed him otherwise.Godot:\nIn that case, let's see some hot, bitter evidence. During the first crime, how did Luke Atmey know that Ron DeLite was Mask\u2606DeMasque?Present Newspaper Clipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I think I see it...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please don't just throw out any piece of evidence you like.\nGodot:\nThe only thing a man should throw when he's frustrated is a hissy fit.\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, there's no need to overthink this! How did Luke Atmey find out who Mask\u2606DeMasque was...? That answer has got to be staring me right in the face!)\nJudge:\nHmm... Judging by your expression, it seems you haven't given up.\nLeads back to:\n\"In that case, let's see some hot, bitter evidence.\"Phoenix:\nI think I see it...Atmey:\nSee what...?Phoenix:\nWhen you were in grade school, you received the same report card every year. \"Gets into lots of mischief trying to be the center of attention.\"Atmey:\nWh-What do you mean...!?Phoenix:\n...This newspaper clipping. It has a picture of you and Ron DeLite on his guard uniform. It seems that Mask\u2606DeMasque didn't just disappear into thin air. He just took off his outfit... and hid it in a bucket.Judge:\nThat... That sounds far too stupid to be true.Phoenix:\nCorrect. With tricks like that he couldn't fool a baby, let alone an Ace Detective. And that's when you figured it out, Mr. Atmey! That's when you learned that under his mask, Mask\u2606DeMasque was really Ron DeLite!Atmey:\nGgg... Nnn... Urkk...What the... Wasn't he supposed to be Mask\u2606DeMasque...?\nNot only that... it looks like he wasn't even an Ace Detective!\nI can't believe it. He was just a slimy blackmailer...\nWhat a fraud! Trying to pass himself off as an Ace Detective...Atmey:\n............ Why you! How dare you expose me like that...!Phoenix:\n...Atmey:\nWhy I... I mean, I've never blackmailed anyone in my life...! I-I'm a famous and proud Ace Detective, and... and also Mask\u2606DeMasque! Why can't you understand that!?Phoenix:\nI'm afraid you are neither a proud thief, nor an Ace Detective. You're a blackmailer and a murderer. That is your true identity!Atmey:\nWh-Wh-Why YOUUUUUU! How dare you even dare toimplythatonesosmartandcapableasIcouldeverfalltosuchlowlydepths!

It's enough to make one laugh...!Judge:\nIt would seem we've finally gotten to the real answer.Maya:\nThat was... quite a performance by Mr. Atmey...Judge:\nBailiff! Please prepare a cell for Mr. Atmey...Godot:Godot:\nThe hammer that strikes too fast has no time to aim.Judge:\nWh-What do you mean! I'm already prepared to deliver my ruling... (Changed from [Wh-What do you mean! I'm already prepared to deliver my sentence...] in the original release)Godot:\nAllow me to say one thing. I... will be the one to judge!Judge:\n...!Maya:\nYou don't get much more in your face than that...Godot:\nIt appears... that your claws weren't quite sharp enough, Mr. Trite.Phoenix:\nWh... What do you...!? (Changed from [Wh... Where do you...!?] in the original release)Godot:\nIt's true that you've proven a lot of things. ...Things like Luke Atmey was a filthy blackmailer. ...And that he wasn't at Lordly Tailor the night of the murder.Phoenix:\nThat's right! That's why he's the one who killed Mr. Bull--Godot:\nBut... There's still one thing you have yet to prove.Judge:\nWhat's that...?Godot:\nJust because he wasn't at the warehouse doesn't mean he was at the murder scene. Therefore, if you can't prove that this pitiful excuse for a man was at KB Security... ...then I don't see how a verdict can be delivered!Phoenix:\nNo... No waaaaaaaaaay!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! ...Well, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n(Th-This is it... This is the final round...!) I've got to prove that Atmey was at Mr. Bullard's office on that night...Maya:\nB-But...! Can you really prove that?Godot:\nThat's long enough. Mr. Trite... I want to hear your answer.Phoenix:\nThat night, Luke Atmey was at KB Security, and the defense...can prove it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defense can prove it! With evidence!\nJudge:\nAre you sure?\nGodot:\nHa...! Don't you worry. I'll watch over you. ...As you break down and fall to pieces.\nJudge:\nVery well then, let's see this proof! Proof that Luke Atmey was at KB Security that night!\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is the proof!\nJudge:\nIt's true... That is very important. However, I'm not so foolish as to think that will pass for evidence here!\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... It's time you learned the true flavor of life... The flavor of my special Godot Blend #49!\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n... It's bitter. ...Very bitter.\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Don't give up now!\nPhoenix:\n(What do I do...!? If I make a mistake here, it's over...)\n\n\n\nProve with evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads back to:\n\"The defense can prove it! With evidence!\"\n\n\n\n\nCan't prove it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I... I can't prove it.\"can't prove it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I... I can't prove it.\"Phoenix:\nI... I can't prove it.Judge:\nJust as I thought.Phoenix:\n...But! If we hear more of Detective Atmey's testimony...Godot:Godot:\nUnfortunately... That's as far as you go, Mr. Trite.Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean?Godot:\nI won't allow for any more testimony... That's what I mean.Phoenix:\nWhat...?Godot:\nHave you forgotten? Luke Atmey is here after we interrupted his own trial. And you have failed to prove that he committed the murder! I think it's time for this witness to return to his own trial... ...and face his guilty verdict as Mask\u2606DeMasque.Phoenix:\nN-No...Atmey:\nWell now, Sir Lawyer! It seems that love wins out in the end after all! I am the Ace Detective as well as Mask\u2606DeMasque! My verdict will verify that! Just as Ron DeLite's will verify that he is the true murderer! I declare that with the full force of my Ace Detective-ness!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! That's enough deliberation over this witness!Phoenix:\n(I-I can't believe this...! At this rate, Ron is...)Maya:\nD-Don't give up now, Nick! We still have tomorrow! We can look for more evidence and...Phoenix:\nBy then, it'll be too late...Maya:\nHuh? Wh-Why!?Godot:\n\"Double Jeopardy\"... One of the basic rules of any court of law.Maya:\n\"Double Jeopardy\"...?Judge:\n\"Should a defendant be tried and found innocent in court... That defendant cannot be tried again for the same crime.\" This is a fundamental rule of all courts. And it applies to this witness as much as it applies to anyone else.Godot:\nMr. Atmey will be found guilty in a matter of minutes. Guilty as \"Mask\u2606DeMasque\". Which means...Judge:\nHe will be innocent as far as the murder of Kane Bullard is concerned.Maya:\nNo way...Judge:\nThe fact that you were unable to prove Mr. Atmey's guilt of that crime here... ...means that he will never again be tried as Kane Bullard's murderer.Phoenix:\nU... Uwaaaaaaaaaah!Phoenix:\n(Now there's nothing I can possibly do to win... Even if Ron is proclaimed to be innocent... ...the real killer, Luke Atmey, will go free.)Judge:\nYou have cross-examined every statement the witness has made here today. And as long as there is no more testimony... I'm afraid I have to declare that there will be no further questioning of this witness! Are there any objections? Then I hereby end the cross-examination of Luke Atmey!???:???:\nI think... I see it. Your Honor. When you were a child, this is what was on your report card every year. \"Has poor hearing, and often makes mistakes as a result.\"Judge:\nH-H-H-H-How did you...!????:\n...Phoenix. Raise your head up high. Have you forgotten what I used to tell you? A lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets.Phoenix:\n(Th-That voice... No way!)Mia:\nLong time no see, Phoenix.Phoenix:\nM... Mia! (This is the true power of the Kurain Channeling Technique... I know that it's really \"Maya\" who's standing before me... But right now, she's my mentor, Mia Fey.)Mia:\nNow... Let's do this!Phoenix:\nB-But...! There's nothing more we can do, Mia! Without any more testimony, I can't cross-examine...Mia:\nNot yet... The testimony's not over yet.Phoenix:\nWh... What do you mean?Mia:\nYour Honor! Just now you said something very interesting. \"You have cross-examined every statement the witness has made here today.\"Judge:\nY-Yes, that's true, but...Mia:\nUnfortunately, Your Honor, you're forgetting something. Earlier, after the last cross-examination... ...this witness made a number of remarks!Atmey:\nWell now, Sir Lawyer! It seems that love wins out in the end after all! I am the Ace Detective as well as Mask\u2606DeMasque! My verdict will verify that! Just as Ron DeLite's will verify that he is the true murderer! I declare that with the full force of my Ace Detective-ness!Judge:\nY-Yes, but... These comments appear to have no importance whatso--Mia:\nVery well... Then we shall prove their importance via cross-examination. At any rate! As long as the witness has made these remarks... ...we, the defense, assert our right to question them! Is that alright with you... Prosecutor?Godot:\n......Judge:\nIs something the matter? Mr. Godot...Godot:\n...! Ah, nothing.Atmey:\nOh, Sir Lawyer! It looks like you're one step too late! If you think such falsehoods will do anything to me, Luke At--Godot:\n...Let's hear it.Atmey:\nHuh...?Godot:\nIt's true that the witness made some \"remarks\". So then... Let's hear this last bit of cross-examination.Atmey:\nM-Mr. Godot! What are you...?Judge:\nVery well then. Mr. Luke Atmey. (Changed from [Very well then, Luke Atmey.] in the original release) I'm going to allow the defense to cross-examine your earlier remarks. (Changed from [I'll allow the defense to cross-examine your earlier remarks.] in the original release)Mia:\nThe defense would like to hear why you declare the defendant to be the true murderer.Judge:\nSo please, give us one last bit of testimony!Atmey:\nI... Err...Mia:\nPhoenix? This is it. This is our absolute last chance.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Chief!Witness Testimony-- The Last Testimony --Atmey:\nIndeed, it is true that I was not at Lordly Tailor.\nI had to leave to see about another vitally important job request.\nI had known about the date beforehand, so I had this photograph readied.\nMy brilliant deduction was what informed me that the true culprit was Ron DeLite.\nAnd thanks to the Key Card and Wallet, it was abundantly clear that he was there.\nI was also able to make a deduction from the buzzer, which only sounded once.\nThe button did not have any fingerprints on it... Why?\nThe victim would have left prints if he sounded it. Which means the killer sounded it.\nMr. DeLite was wearing his Mask\u2606DeMasque outfit, which is why he left no prints.\nAnd, the blackmail letter? The victim likely just mistook the color of the jewel.\nZvarri! Therefore, all the evidence points to that poor boy!Phoenix:\n(This testimony actually seems to hold up pretty well...)Judge:\nThe witness's earlier remarks do not appear to have been hastily prepared. All of his points have been explained, and none of them seem to contradict anything.Atmey:\n...But of course.Judge:\nBut... How did you know about the emergency buzzer?Atmey:\nThe police investigation documents went directly through me... And I always look over all the documents. It's elementary, Sir Lawyer!Phoenix:\nGrr...Godot:\nAre you going to make even more trouble for us now, Sir Lawyer...?Judge:\nI will not allow any of your usual shenanigans, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.Judge:\nWe cannot postpone Luke Atmey's trial any longer. This is... your last chance!Phoenix:\nH-Hang on a sec! Just one chance...!?Godot:\nHa...! It seems that the party's about to begin.Mia:\n...Well, Phoenix?Phoenix:\nThere isn't any evidence that contradicts with that testimony!Mia:\n...So it would seem.Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean, \"So it would seem\"...?Mia:\nListen, Phoenix. Pointing out contradictions... ...doesn't always mean you have to present evidence... does it? At any rate, this is our chance. If you can't point out a case-breaking contradiction... ...you lose. That's all there is to it.Godot:\n...Cup number 17. The last cup. It seems like the time has come to put an end to this trial.Phoenix:\n(I have to find a fatal contradiction in this testimony... And... I need to point it out without presenting evidence! Which means all I can do is find the contradictory remark and press it...!)Mia:\nRemember! You only get one chance!Judge:\nVery well then, Mr. Wright. Please begin your final cross-examination!Cross Examination",

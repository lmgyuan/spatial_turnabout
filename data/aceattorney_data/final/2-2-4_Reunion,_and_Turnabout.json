Ongoing investigation has revealed that the driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. -Ms. Ini Miney Holds Interview About Crash- I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash, and like, I woke up in a huge sea of flames. I was like, still half-asleep, but I opened the right door and like, got out. I don't, like, remember anything else. -Doctor Lurking in the Shadows? If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney.

Nick...Phoenix:\nYeah?Maya:\nDid you know that Von Karma's daughter is only 18... Just like me...?Phoenix:\nUm, yeah. ...Why?Maya:\nI was just thinking about how strong she is... I mean, she's been in Germany all this time all by herself, and she's so grown up!Phoenix:\n...Yeah, and I'm sure she felt a lot of pressure from her father's reputation.Maya:\n...And then you look at me, and, well... I'm the daughter of the Master, but I'm still just a little girl. And on top of that, I'm the suspect in a murder trial.Phoenix:\n(Um... But I think you're really strong too, Maya, for all you've gone through...)Pearl:\nGood morning! The two of you look like you're doing well today. I'm happy for you!Maya:\nHey! Morning, Pearly!Pearl:\nYou'll be safe today, Mystic Maya!Maya:\nHuh? What do you mean?Pearl:\nMy mother is coming today to show her support!Maya:\nY-Yeah... Yeah! That's right, Pearly!Phoenix:\nHey, Pearls...Pearl:\n...? Yes, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\nUm, do you think you could do me a big favor? Could you channel Mia today too?Pearl:\nHuh? ...I was sort of hoping to sit in the audience today and watch...Phoenix:\n...Please. It's very important to me. I don't feel confident enough without her help...Pearl:\nMr. Nick! That's enough! You can't show weakness in front of the person you love!Maya:\nP-Pearly! N-Not this again...Phoenix:\nPlease, can you do this for us, Pearls?Pearl:\nUm... Alright. I'll do it. I'll do it for Mystic Maya's sake. See you later, then! I'll leave you two to your alone time!Phoenix:\n...Phew, thank goodness.Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\nThis way, Pearls won't be able to see today's trial...Maya:\n...Wh-What do you mean...? What's going on...?June 22, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.von Karma:\nLet's start already. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I look forward to tonight's news with great joy. The image of your defeated face will be transmitted all over the world!Mia:\nAll over the world, huh? Sounds like you've made quite a name for yourself, Phoenix.von Karma:\nDon't be foolish, you foolish fool wearing the foolishly foolish clothes. The famous one is me! I'm the prodigy who has never lost a case since becoming a prosecutor five years ago. Naturally, the world's eyes are on me, as I conduct my first trial in this country!Mia:\nUh, huh... That's nice, Ms. von Karma.von Karma:\nHmph. Glad to see you're in such good \"spirits\" today, Ms. Fey.Phoenix:\n(Uhh... It's true what they say... Women really are scary when they fight... *gulp*)Judge:\nNow then. A very interesting theory was presented during yesterday's session.von Karma:\nThat the defendant could have left the Channeling Chamber, correct?Judge:\nYes. And this key is proof of that. This key, the only key to the Channeling Chamber, was not where it should have been.von Karma:\nYour Honor, I would like to say one thing before we begin.Judge:\nA-Alright... Let's hear it.von Karma:\nThe prosecution has determined that from the time of the murder to the time of arrest, the defendant did indeed leave the room at one point.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Judge:\nBut... Ms. von Karma! Then... How do you explain this picture? Are you saying then, that the person in this picture is not the defendant...?von Karma:\nI never said that wasn't the defendant.Judge:\nTh-Then what is the meaning of this...?von Karma:\nAll I am saying is that Maya Fey, after killing the victim, exited the room. And I believe that is when she dropped this key.Judge:\nCan you substantiate your claim?von Karma:\nIsn't that what I'm here for? The prosecution would like to call the defendant's aunt, Morgan Fey, to the stand.Mia:\n...Just as I suspected. Aunt Morgan...Phoenix:\n(Poor Mia... She seems really torn by this...)von Karma:\nWitness. Name and occupation.Morgan:\nMy name is Morgan Fey, and I am a spirit medium, in a manner of speaking...Judge:\nI'm sorry, but what do you mean, \"in a manner of speaking\"...? Aaah!von Karma:\nI don't think anyone really cares. Now then, after the murder took place, you kept watch over the defendant, correct?Morgan:\nYes, that is correct. I performed the Spirit Severing Technique on Mystic Maya then.Judge:\nS-Spirit Severing Technique?Morgan:\nA technique to remove a spirit from a body and send it back to the other world. That is...Judge:\nYes...? That is...? Mmfph!von Karma:\nYou. Be quiet. Now, witness. Something happened while you were performing this technique, correct?Morgan:\n...Yes, that is correct.Phoenix:\nWh-What in the world could've...!?Morgan:\nMystic Maya... She escaped from the room...Judge:\nWh-What!?von Karma:\nAnd here we come to the heart of the matter. Maya Fey, while in a possessed state, managed to escape from the Channeling Chamber!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Ms. Fey! Please testify to this court what happened during that time!Morgan:\nYour Honor, I will try my best...Mia:\nI think someone just upped the ante on this trial...Witness Testimony-- Maya's Escape --Morgan:\nAfter we heard the gunshots, those two broke the door open and entered the Chamber.\nI requested that Mr. Wright and the other lady please contact the police.\nA pistol was hanging from Mystic Maya's hand and she was in a daze...\nThen, quite suddenly, she thrusted me away from herself and escaped from the room.\nWith great strength, she hit the base of my neck and I fainted for a short while...\nI'm afraid I have no knowledge of where she went after that.Phoenix:\nWhy have you hidden this until now!?Morgan:\nI... I did not wish to cause more trouble for Mystic Maya. However... I must correct falsities when they arise.von Karma:\nThat's right. She is simply correcting a falsity, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:\n(Why is she making it a point to take a stab at me...

Witness, elaborate on that point for us.Morgan:\nI'm afraid I have no knowledge of where she went after that.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs that because you were unconscious?\nMorgan:\nWhy, yes...\nPhoenix:\n(Great, well, now what...?)\n\n\n\nQuestion further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo while you were unconscious, you have absolutely no idea where the defendant went?\nMorgan:\nI would think that's obvious, good sir.\nPhoenix:\nIf that's true... then how can you know for sure that the defendant left the Channeling Chamber at all!?\nJudge:\nNow that you mention it... I have to wonder myself!\nvon Karma:\nIt's true that this witness is not able to confirm this. But the key word here is \"this\" witness.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by that!?\nMia:\nIt means she has another witness up her sleeve. That's what. It looks like Ms. von Karma is ready to move on to her next witness.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave her be (before pressing second, third, and fourth statements)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If she fainted, then there's no way she can testify any more than she has... If I press her, I'm not going to get anything useful anyway...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, then... Let's continue on with the testimony, shall we?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave her be (after pressing second, third, and fourth statements)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If she fainted, then there's no way she can testify any more than she has... If I press her, I'm not going to get anything useful anyway...)\nLeads to:\n\"That's enough!\"Mia:\nI can't see a crack in her testimony...Phoenix:\nWh-What should we do...?Mia:\nFor now, we should try and get more information out of her. After we get more information from her we may be able to use it later to our advantage.After pressing second, third, fourth, and sixth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! From what I can tell, there is nothing wrong with this witness's testimony. And from what she has said, we can establish that Maya Fey did leave the Chamber.Phoenix:\n(Hmm... I hope this isn't going to come back and bite us in the butt...)von Karma:\nNow, let's take the next logical step and ask, \"Where did the defendant go after leaving the Channeling Chamber?\"Judge:\nYes, yes... That is exactly what we should b-- Eeek!von Karma:\nBe quiet, you! Now then, what the escapee had done was she had gone to speak with a certain person!Phoenix:\nShe... She went to speak with someone!?Judge:\nWh-Who was it!?von Karma:\nThe prosecution calls Ms. Ini Miney, who was sleeping in the Side Room at the time.Phoenix:\nI-Ini Miney...?Mia:\nI think you can see where this is headed...von Karma:\nWitness. Name and occupation.Ini:\nUm... OK, so my name is, like, Ini Miney. I'm, like, researching, like, parapsychology stuff at the, um, university.Judge:\nWhat is this \"parapsychology\"?Ini:\nUm... Let's see... It's, like, I guess, most people call it \"occult stuff\".Judge:\nEven if that's what most people call it, I can't say I understand what that means...von Karma:\nThen I suggest you go home and research it yourself.Judge:\nYes, sir.von Karma:\nNow then, Ms. Miney, after the murder took place, you spoke with the defendant, Maya Fey. Is this correct?Ini:\nUm... Well... Hmm... Like, I guess...von Karma:\nIf that's the case, then let's hear your testimony. That IS alright, isn't it, Your Honor?Judge:\nYes, sir.Phoenix:\n(For the love of all things good, Your Honor, have some spine... For my sake...)Witness Testimony-- After the Murder --Ini:\nLike, when the channeling started, I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room.\nLike, a little later, someone came into the room, like, really suddenly.\nIt was, like, oh my gawd, totally my sister!\nI, like, hadn't seen her in like, so long... I was so happy in, like, a sad way...\nMy sister... She, like, told me something, like, totally terrible.Judge:\nNow hold your horses, young lady! You're saying the person that entered was your sister!? Don't you mean the defendant, Maya Fey...?von Karma:\nReally, now... Your Honor. Maya Fey was still in the middle of channeling at that time.Judge:\nA-Are you saying that the spirit was the spirit of this witness's sister!?von Karma:\nYes, Mimi Miney. She was a nurse at Dr. Grey's clinic.Judge:\nOh... W-Well... This is...von Karma:\nWitness.Ini:\nLike, yeah?von Karma:\nIn your testimony, you mentioned a \"terrible\" thing. Why don't you tell the court what this terrible thing was? I'm sure we'd love to hear about it.Ini:\n...Um, like... Do I totally, like, really have to?von Karma:\nOf course.Judge:\nMs. Miney... please.Ini:\n... My sister... Like, this is what she said to me.That was... no accident... I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini?Judge:\nShe \"took her revenge?\" Are you sure that's what she said?Ini:\nY-Yes...von Karma:\nThere, are you satisfied, Your Honor?Judge:\n...I still can't believe it. I can't believe that a spirit would go so far as to use a medium to get revenge...von Karma:\nIt is a bit hard to swallow, however, all the evidence and testimonies point to this as the truth! ...The end.Judge:\n...What do you think, Mr. Wright? It certainly seems like all the loose ends are accounted for...Phoenix:\n(This... This testimony just now... Was it all made up? Was it just one huge lie...?)Mia:\nOf course it was, Phoenix.Phoenix:\n...Mia! What do you mean?Mia:\nIt's well constructed... but that's all it is. But even the most well-spun lies can be undone. We can do it, Phoenix. Let's find that one loose thread and unwind this tapestry of lies.Phoenix:\nYour Honor! There is room for doubt, so the defense will cross-examine this witness. We believe that our cross-examination will reveal the real truth behind this murder!von Karma:\nYet again the foolish fool spouts out more foolishly foolish drabble...

What about this child?\nPhoenix:\nIt just so happens that at the time of the murder, Pearl was playing in the center garden.\nvon Karma:\nThe garden...?\nPhoenix:\nYup!

So, Ms. Miney, what do you have to say to that!?\nIni:\nNnaaawrr!\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nAs the court can see... she's a bit of an airhead. Also, she was leading her \"sister\" at that time.

Tell us the truth!Ini:\nA-About what!?Phoenix:\nAbout what!? About where you really were at the time of the murder, of course!von Karma:von Karma:\nThe witness just testified about that!Ini:\nTh-That's right!

Did I miss something again?\nMia:\nYou shouldn't let up on this line of questioning.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Why not?\nMia:\nWho is the only person you didn't see with your own eyes at the time of the murder?\nPhoenix:\nIt was Ini Miney, correct?\nMia:\nWhich means, you can safely assume... She is the real murderer.\nPhoenix:\nThat's a pretty daring assumption...\nMia:\nBut it's the most obvious, isn't it? I mean, is there anyone else?\nPhoenix:\nWell, no, I guess not.\nMia:\nIt's worth a shot, even if it's in the dark. So, let's try to prove that Ms. Miney was not in the Side Room at the time!\nPhoenix:\n(Umm, this is bluff number...? We've done this so many times in this case I've lost count.)\nLeads to:\n\"Your lies end here!\"There is no way!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your lies end here!\"Phoenix:\nYour lies end here!Ini:\nWh-What do you!?Phoenix:\nThe witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room.

Is there really a contradiction somewhere...?)\nMia:\nDon't worry, you're on the right path, Phoenix. It might be a little hard for you to see the contradiction, but it's there. So, just this once, do you want me to help you out?\n\n\n\nYes, please help me!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease, I need your help right now!\nMia:\nH-Hold on... First, calm down, Phoenix. ...Good. ...That girl...

I can't just accept her help without thinking it through myself!)\nMia:\nHa ha, that's the spirit. Give it another try.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. What is your answer?\nPhoenix:\n(Argh!

We had gone to call the police.Ini:\n...S-So? Like, what does that, like, have to do with anything!?Phoenix:\nIt's very simple. Ms. Miney, how did you know that fact?Ini:\n...H-How...?Phoenix:\nI concede that Ms. Fey was the only person in the Channeling Chamber. However, someone who was \"asleep\" in the Side Room could not have known that!Ini:\n...!Phoenix:\nWhich means, Ms. Miney! You did, in fact, go to the Channeling Chamber. But you didn't go there by way of the Winding Way! (Changed from [However, you didn't go there by way of the Winding Way!] in the original release)Ini:\nGwaaaaaaaaaaaa!Judge:\nB-But! Look at the manor guidemap! If one were to go between the Side Room and the Channeling Chamber, one would have to use the Winding Way!Phoenix:\nYes, that's right, Your Honor. Which is why... Which is why I ask this very important question! Where was the witness at the time of the murder!?Ini:\n...Umm... Urrrr...Phoenix:\nMs. Miney! Please answer the question!von Karma:von Karma:\n... Don't ask a question off of a baseless assumption, if you please...Phoenix:\n...!von Karma:\nWell, I suppose since you've put it out on the table, Mr. Phoenix Wright... you might as well answer the question for us! Where was the witness at the time of the murder!?Mia:\nNow's your chance, Phoenix.Phoenix:\nYeah!Mia:\nThe only person who could have killed Dr. Grey was Ini Miney!

She would kill Dr. Grey, and pin the blame on my client!Ini:\n...N...No... S-Stop...von Karma:\n...I can't stand to listen to any more of this foolishness! If that's the case, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I have a proposition! This whole idea that the witness moved the clothing box to the crime scene, pretended to be the defendant, killed the victim, and then fled the scene of the crime; It's not possible for one person to do all that by herself!Correct.

How about the wig!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, I wasn't talking about that exact point... I meant, people, humans. If we want to do something bad enough, then...\nJudge:\nThat's enough! Beyond simply proposing that it is possible for one person to commit this crime, it is the duty of a lawyer to back up his or her claims.\nIni:\nYeah, it's your duty!\nJudge:\nIf you can't do that, then your proposal falls flat.\nIni:\nYeah, it totally falls flat!\nPhoenix:\n(...Why... Why do you have to hurt me so...?)\nMia:\nIt's alright, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nIt isn't possible for one person to commit this crime, but...\nPhoenix:\n(... Ack! That's...

Grrrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix:\nYou shot Dr. Grey with your own two hands! Do you deny it!?Ini:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!Phoenix:\nI think this is what really happened. The murderer had planted herself at the scene of the crime long beforehand. Dressed in a medium's costume and wearing a wig, she pretended to be the defendant. And then, the channeling started. The murderer crept silently towards the other two, both of whom had their eyes closed. ...First, she drugged Maya Fey with a strong sleeping agent. Then, she stabbed Dr. Grey with the knife! Next, she hid my client inside the clothing box... She did that so she could take Maya's place and frame her for the crime.Mia:\n...But that's when something unexpected happened.Judge:\nUnexpected...?Phoenix:\nYes.*bang!*Phoenix:\nDr. Grey was actually not yet dead! With the last of his strength, he fired a shot at his attacker! And that is why the hole in the folding screen was so low to the ground! The murderer then took the gun from Dr. Grey, and...*bang!*Judge:\nAfter that, you and the other lady thought to break into the room...?Phoenix:\nYes, a gunshot is certainly something you wouldn't expect to hear. Which is why, upon hearing the shots, we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber.*klik*Phoenix:\nMs. Miney... She immediately covered her own costume with blood...*klik*Phoenix:\nAnd pretended to be Maya Fey.von Karma:\nB-But! That sort of deception would have been easy to see through!Phoenix:\nWhich is precisely why Ms. Morgan Fey chased us out.Morgan:\nPlease leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police! Hurry! Before there are more victims here!Judge:\nWh-What is one supposed to say...?Phoenix:\nThis is the real truth behind this murder....Ha... ...Ahahahaha...Judge:\nWh-Who is that!? Laughing at a time like this...!? Ack!von Karma:\nOh, you simpleminded fools. I'm sorry, are you still by chance, evolving?Phoenix:\nWh-What is it this time...?Judge:\nM-Ms. von Karma... Surely...von Karma:\nOf course it was me! Do you really think someone of Von Karma blood would lose due to something this petty?Phoenix:\nWHAT IN THE WORLD!?von Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! Your argument is flawed in one very crucial area!Phoenix:\nAnd that is...?von Karma:\nIf this witness is the real murderer... why would she go through all this trouble?Phoenix:\n...Huh?von Karma:\nWorking together with a medium, pretending to be one, putting on this whole act... What reason would she have to do such foolish things?Phoenix:\nEh? Well, that's... Uh...Ini:\nYeah, that's right! That's exactly what I was gonna say!von Karma:\nOh, and one other thing. Why would Ms. Ini Miney want to kill Dr. Grey? Where is her motive?Ini:\nYeah! That's exactly what I wanted to say too! Yeah! Motive! I don't have a motive!Phoenix:\nA... motive... That's... (I can't say she has no motive here! I have to think of a motive now! What is her reason for wanting Dr. Grey dead...?) The reason you wanted Dr. Grey dead is this!Present Newspaper Clipping 2 or Mimi Miney profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Hah!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nIni:\nHo-hum, ho-hum...

My breathing is becoming labored...\nMia:\nMy eyesight is failing me...\nvon Karma:\nMakes you not want to get old, doesn't it, Mr. Phoenix Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(...Ack! I've got to take my time and think carefully about this...)\nMia:\nPhoenix, think back! What kind of ax would Ini have to grind with Dr. Grey? ... There is only one reason, right?\nPhoenix:\n(...Only one...?)\nLeads back to:\n\"A... motive... That's... (I can't say she has no motive here!)\"Ini:\n...Hah! Just as I thought. You bore me with your silly answers, Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\n(Just great. Now even SHE is calling me by my full name...)Ini:\nYou think I did this to get revenge for my sister's death?Phoenix:\nYes! Because through that accident, you suffered a lot of hurt and pain yourself!Ini:\nDon't be stupid! No one has proof that Dr. Grey drugged my sister, right? And you want to say I wanted to take revenge based on nothing?Judge:\nWh-What do you mean by that...?Ini:\nSenile, stupid gramps. ... I'm, like, going to explain, so, like, please listen, OK? It's been over half a year since I was discharged from the hospital. If I, like, wanted revenge, then, like, I wouldn't have waited this long. Um, and 'sides, like, the guy that thought of the spirit thing, was, like, Dr. Grey. It was, like, a total coincidence he asked me about it, you know?Phoenix:\n(She... She's back to her airhead persona...!) (Changed from [She... She's back to her airhead self...!] in the original release) H-However, you see-- Eeeowch!von Karma:\nPathetic, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You failed to support your own theory. ...The end.Judge:\nI think we have our answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. What Ms. Miney has stated is very true. The revenge plan is overly complicated, and she has no motive in the first place. Furthermore, there is no reason for Ms. Morgan Fey to cooperate with this plan. You don't even have any truly decisive pieces of evidence to demonstrate your point.von Karma:\nTsk, tsk. So many faults, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You should really learn your place.Phoenix:\nNnghuuurk! (Wh-What happened!? I thought I had her for sure!...)Ini:\nHee hee... See, like, that's what I, like, told you!Phoenix:\n...?Ini:\nI hope you liked your slice of humble pie! (Changed from [I'm going to serve you a slice of humble pie!] in the original release)Judge:\nVery well, I now conclude the cross-examination of Ms. Ini Miney!???:Mia:\nYour Honor. Please, allow the defense one more minute.Judge:\nAlright.Mia:\nYou can't lose here. Have faith in yourself, Phoenix!Phoenix:\nMia...Mia:\nYes, it does sound like a ridiculously messed up plan for a murder, but you know, regardless, that girl trained for this crime.Phoenix:\n...R-Really?Mia:\n... Listen, Phoenix. Everything happens for a reason. There is a reason for why she had to kill Dr. Grey. And it is also the reason she had no choice but to kill him in this fashion.Judge:\nTime is up, Mr. Wright. Your final answer, please. If you want to say that you can prove Ms. Miney had a motive, then... why did she kill the victim in this way? Can you provide the reason?Phoenix:\n(...Can I... Can I really do this...?)Yes, I can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I am not totally confident here, but I know that I must press on no matter what...\"No, I can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I am not totally confident here, but I know that I must press on no matter what...\"Phoenix:\n(I am not totally confident here, but I know that I must press on no matter what...)Mia:\nThat's right, Phoenix! Only you can do this now!Phoenix:\nI will show and substantiate the fact that Ms. Miney had a motive!Ini:\nHa ha ha. Too bad. You're too late! My cross-examination has already ended, after all. Eeek!von Karma:\n...Interesting. I'll let you have your chance, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Ini:\nWh-What!? Y-You're supposed to be on my side! Aiiiii!von Karma:\nA Von Karma only cares about the perfect win. As long as you have the will to fight, I will knock you down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\n...von Karma:\nAnd I don't care if you are my witness! So help me, I will throw you out of my way! (Changed from [And I don't care if you are my witness! So help me, I will blow you out of my way!] in the original release)Ini:\nN-No way...Judge:\nVery well. The court will take a 5 minute recess. We will continue the cross-examination after we reconvene.Ini:\nH-Hey! W-Wait a sec, here!To be continued.June 22, 12:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Maya:\n...Is it really true... about my aunt...?Phoenix:\nI'm afraid so, Maya. There is no way Ini could've killed Dr. Grey by herself. And under the circumstances, there's no one else other than your aunt, Morgan.Maya:\nThat... That's terrible... Why? Why would my aunt...?Everything is going just as I predicted, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:\nAck! Ms. von Karma!Maya:\nWhy are you doing this!? Why are you trying to take revenge on Nick!? Nick had nothing to do with what happened to your dad.von Karma:\nDon't you have something better to be worrying about? Say, your own situation?Maya:\nUgnn... ...Looking down on me, even though we're the same age...Phoenix:\nAre you done yet? You've caused me enough pain and suffering.von Karma:\nNot yet. My goal is to defeat you, and let the whole world know of your defeat.Phoenix:\n...But even if you do that, it won't bring your father back...von Karma:\n... Hmph. ...Whatever. In the meantime, let's bring this match to its conclusion. And then we'll know who the real winner is.June 22, 12:10 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nCan you prove Ms. Ini Miney had a motive?Phoenix:\nYes, I believe I can. (Ini Miney and Dr. Grey have only one point of connection. And that is the car accident one year ago. The motive I'm looking for must be there...) Ms. Miney. Please testify to this court about your car accident last year.Ini:\nHuh? I thought, like, you wanted to, like, ask about my, like, motive. I, like, don't see the point in, like, bringing up the past.Judge:\nMs. Miney, if you please.Ini:\n...OK, OK. Like, I totally don't think it'll do any good, but...Witness Testimony-- Last Year's Accident --Ini:\nThat was... like, last year, in May.\nLike, something really bad had happened at, like, my sister's clinic around then...\nAnd like, the night of the accident, my sis was totally tired while she was driving.\nI was, like, totally pooped too, so I, like, fell asleep in the passenger's seat...\nI, like, woke up 'cause of a jolt, and, like, it was a sea of flames around me.\nI, like, opened the door and, like, got away.Judge:\nHmm... I think I've heard of this incident.Phoenix:\nIt was all the talk on the tabloid shows, day after day, last year.Judge:\nYes, and there was talk about Dr. Grey... drugging your sister...? Gwuugh!von Karma:\nThose were merely \"rumors\". ...Totally baseless gossip.Judge:\nHmm, yes... Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.Mia:\nRight now, it's impossible to prove that Dr. Grey did in fact drug Ms. Miney's sister.Phoenix:\nYeah...

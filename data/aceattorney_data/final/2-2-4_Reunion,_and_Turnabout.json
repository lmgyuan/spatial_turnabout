  "previousContext": "Reunion, and Turnabout\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nThat was... no accident... I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini?\nMaya:\nI finally get to see you again, and...\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault. You didn't do it.\nMaya:\nNo, I... I did it... I killed that person.\nPhoenix:\nBut that wasn't you.\nMaya:\nIt doesn't matter. It might as well have been me.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe something like this happened...The events of that gloomy, rainy afternoon that started this whole mess...keep playing through my mind...)\nEpisode 2Reunion, and Turnabout\nJune 16, 3:34 PMWright & Co. Law Offices\n???:\nWhat depressing rain... Do you understand how depressed that makes me!? Do you!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, I guess...\n???:\nBut actually, more than being depressed, I'm angry. Angry at that weather girl on TV. \"I think our little rainy spell will take a break with a day of sun!\"...is what that girl said! I'd stake my life on it!\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's the weather...\n???:\nBut that's why I didn't bother to bring an umbrella today. What nerve, calling herself a weather girl! She's going to hear about my $1500 suit!\nPhoenix:\nUm... About your case... Unless you're planning on suing the weather girl...?\n???:\n... I'm sorry. I thought that before we got down to business, we could have some friendly chatter. My name is Dr. Turner Grey. I'm a surgeon.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me never to end up under his knife...)\nGrey:\nI'm here today because of this incident.\nPhoenix:\n\"Malpractice at Grey Surgical Clinic. Fourteen In-Patients Lose Their Lives!\" ...Oh. You're... the doctor at...?\nGrey:\nIt's really quite upsetting. Did you hear me!? UPSETTING!\nPhoenix:\nYes, yes, I heard you. I agree, it's quite upsetting, Dr. Grey.\nGrey:\nThe one that screwed up was that nurse! It was her that got the medications mixed up and killed those 14 patients! And yet! Now listen good! And yet! That nurse had the nerve to go and die before admitting to her wrongdoing! She didn't even offer any sort of explanation to me! And this is the kicker! She up and has herself a grand ol' accident and crashed her car! Smash! Crunch! Instantly transforming her car into the accordion model!\nPhoenix:\n(That's right... About a year ago, all the tabloid shows were talking about it. Fourteen victims of medical malpractice and the nurse's mysterious fatal accident. There were rumors that Dr. Grey had actually caused that crash. People said it was to forever hide the person responsible for the malpractice incident.)\nGrey:\nWhy would I...? Now, I'm just going to say this once -- Why on Earth would I want to kill that nurse? She's the one who killed those 14 patients! Not me!\nPhoenix:\nI think you need to take a deep breath, doctor, and focus... More to the point, this case is over a year old. Why bring it up now...?\nGrey:\nThat's simple! Because the situation is slipping out of my grasp. This just won't do. My clinic isn't seeing nearly as many patients nowadays. Do you understand what that means!? It means they're not coming to my clinic!\nPhoenix:\n(You don't say...? If it were me, I don't think I'd want to go either.) So... what would you like me to do about it...?\nGrey:\nI want you to help me prove I'm innocent.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you do realize I'm a lawyer, not a private investigator, right?\nGrey:\nNo, this is something only you can do.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nGrey:\nMaya Fey. You know this girl, correct?\nPhoenix:\n...! (Maya! Why would he know her name...!?)\nGrey:\nI heard you were working under her for a little while.\nPhoenix:\nWell, yes... I mean... Hey, wait a second here! I worked UNDER her!?\nGrey:\nYes. Am I wrong? She told me, so I'm not quite sure if...\nPhoenix:\nWell, we worked a few trials together. But she went back to her hometown to undergo more training.\nGrey:\nAh, yes, I heard. It must be lonely for you.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!? Wait... I'm not...!\nGrey:\nShe must be an extraordinary girl to handle such rigid training.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGrey:\nI have an acquaintance who knows a lot about these mystical sorts of things. She's the one who introduced me to Ms. Fey.\nPhoenix:\n(Is Maya... really that famous...?)\nGrey:\nAnd I've already set up an appointment.\nPhoenix:\nFor what?\nGrey:\nWhat else!? A channeling! I'm going to have her call the spirit of that nurse that went and got herself killed!\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh. (Maya... I wonder what she's up to right now...)\nMaya:\nWe, the women of the Fey clan have always been spirit mediums. (Changed from [We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums.] in the original release) It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us.\nPhoenix:\n(That's what she told me... I guess she's learned to accept her responsibilities and become an adult...)\nGrey:\nNot counting training, this will be her first time channeling a spirit, so she gave me one condition before accepting my request.\nPhoenix:\nA condition...?\nGrey:\nThe condition is you, Mr. Wright. She said that she wouldn't do the channeling without first seeing you again.\nPhoenix:\nMe...?\nGrey:\nAnd that is why I've searched you out! You want to see her too, don't you!?\nPhoenix:\n(And so... that is how I ended up visiting Maya's hometown with the doctor...)\nJune 19, 1:25 PMKurain Village\nPhoenix:\n(So this is Kurain Village; Maya's hometown.)\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\nW-Why, hello there.\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\nHmm... What an odd little girl.\n???:\nHey! Wait up, Pearly!!\nPhoenix:\n(Hm? Someone else is coming this way...)\n???:\nNiiiiiiiick!\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya. How are you...? It's good to see you again.\nMaya:\nWow, I didn't think you'd really show up!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not that big a deal. You made it sound like you were soooo far away.\nMaya:\nWell, maybe I exaggerated... just a little.\nPhoenix:\nIt was only 2 hours by train. If I had known you were this close, I'd have visited more.\nMaya:\nNo! You're not allowed. I already decided, you know. Until I become an adult, I have to work hard and be strong by myself...\nPhoenix:\nOh... well... Anyway, congratulations. I'm glad to hear training is going well for you.\nMaya:\nHeh, heh...\nExamine\nPhone booth\nPhoenix:\nIt's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. My cell phone doesn't get reception up here, so who knows. I may need it later.\nBus shelter\nPhoenix:\nAn old bus stop. It says \"Kurain Village\" on the sign post. The buses seem incredibly inconvenient since they only come 3 times a day.\nGiant rock\nPhoenix:\nA giant rock that seems to be reaching for the sky. Its origins are written on a beat-up, old sign. It looks like this giant rock is called the \"Kurain Boulder\". There's a really complex explanation written here, but long story short, it's a big stone for spirits to live in... Or something like that...\nRoad and houses further\nPhoenix:\nRustic, thatch-roofed houses where the other villagers live line the street. They're nowhere near as large or as nice as the manor in front of me. It's kind of odd that I don't see any of the other villagers walking around, though...\nFey Manor\nPhoenix:\nThe biggest, most elegant of the buildings I can see from here. This is Fey Manor; the place Maya calls home. It's easy to be overwhelmed by its presence...\nTalk\nToday's channeling\nPhoenix:\nLooks like you've finally become a full-fledged medium, taking on your first job.\nMaya:\nYeah. I didn't think it would be this soon.\nPhoenix:\nBut this case... Do you know the messy story behind it...?\nMaya:\nHa ha ha, behold the power of the Maya Intelligence Network! Let's see. Fourteen people died because of malpractice on Dr. Grey's part, right? And to pin the blame on the nurse, he killed her in what appeared to be a car accident!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Um, so what is this \"Maya Intelligence Network\" anyway...?\nMaya:\nThe tabloids.\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I thought.\nMaya:\n... Ha ha ha. I'm just pulling your leg, Nick! What really happened is the exact opposite. I heard all about it from Dr. Grey.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nOh, come on, Nick! I wouldn't take a crazed killer as a client! That's too scary, even for me.\nPhoenix:\n(Y-Yeah, I guess so.)\nKurain Village\nPhoenix:\nSo this is your hometown, huh, Maya?\nMaya:\nYup! Kurain Village... But I've heard people call this place \"Medium Valley\", too.\nPhoenix:\nInteresting... So everyone that lives here is a spirit medium?\nMaya:\nPretty much. Most of my ancestors were too, I think...\nPhoenix:\n(That's probably true since the Fey ability to communicate with the dead is so strong...)\nMaya:\nActually, only the women of this village are mediums.\nPhoenix:\nSo what do the men do?\nMaya:\nThey usually work someplace outside the village.\nThe girl earlier\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah, I wanted to ask you about that girl I saw earlier. Do you know her?\nMaya:\nOh, you mean Pearly?\nPhoenix:\nPearly?\nMaya:\nPearl Fey. She's my cousin. Isn't she adorable? Just like yours truly!\nPhoenix:\nCousin... Wait, then that means... Is she also a...?\nMaya:\nYup. She's a medium, too. Pearly's a real genius when it comes to channeling!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I see. I hope I didn't scare her when I tried to talk to her earlier.\nMaya:\nNah, it's not you. My aunt drilled it into her head that \"if a suspicious-looking person tries to talk to you, run away\".\nPhoenix:\nS-Suspicious-looking...!?\nMaya:\nWell, you're not wearing training clothes, for starters...\nPhoenix:\nOf course not.\nMaya:\nPearly is my aunt's most valued treasure, so she's not allowed to go outside of town. She doesn't know much about the world outside of Kurain Village.\nPhoenix:\nAunt?\nMaya:\nPearly's mother is my aunt, duh. Come on, Nick.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nAh, it's good to see this tarnished badge again.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by \"tarnished\"...?\nMaya:\nWell, look. This badge is like every other. It's bound to lose its color and shine after years and years. But you know, polishing it up once in a while wouldn't be a bad idea.\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nHa ha ha. I'm warning you! I'm not the same weak Maya you knew a year ago, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nYou seem to have a lot of faith in yourself.\nMaya:\nYou'll see soon enough. I think you'll be totally shocked by how good my hamburgers are now!\nPhoenix:\n(Were you training to be a medium or a cook?)\nTurner Grey profile\nMaya:\nHey, it's my client!\nPhoenix:\n\"Client,\" huh? You're really serious about your work, aren't you?\nMaya:\nI thought I'd say it once, just to try it out, like how you always say, \"My client.\"\nAny other evidence\nMaya:\nHmm, nothing really comes to mind, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nDon't say that with such a big smile on your face.\nMaya:\nHa ha. What can I say? I'm in a good mood today.\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this person?\nMaya:\nHey, have I told you this one yet, Nick? We have a legend in this village. It goes like this. \"All the woman of the Fey clan are beauties.\" Well?\nPhoenix:\n...And that's a legend now?\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\nWell, Nick, I've got to get going. It's about time for the channeling to start.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Oh, yeah...\nMaya:\nI'm doing the channeling in my house, so come on in, OK? After I'm done, we can grill up some juicy burgers!\nPhoenix:\nAlright. Good luck, Maya.\nMaya:\nThanks!\nPhoenix:\n(Well... At least she's still the same perky Maya.)\nJune 19Fey ManorMeditation Room\nGrey:\nAh, Mr. Wright. I'm so glad you showed.\nPhoenix:\nSome nice weather we're having today. Aren't you happy?\nGrey:\nNo, not at all. That stupid weather girl made the wrong call again. \"It will rain cats and dogs today!\" she said with a straight face. I can't believe they allow such misguided reports on the public airwaves!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like talking about the weather with this guy is just asking for punishment...)\nGrey:\n...But anyway, this is a splendid manor.\nPhoenix:\n(No argument there... It's hard to believe that this is Maya's house, though...)\nGrey:\nI was given a guidemap to this building. Here, Mr. Wright. I have a copy for you too.\nGuidemap added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nDoor\nPhoenix:\nA door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. It looks like there is a strong lock on this door to top it off.\nWriting on top of the door\nPhoenix:\nSomeone with a lot of skill wrote these four Chinese characters with a brush. Oh look, here's a translation: \"Once in a Lifetime.\" Its message is people should value their ghostly meetings as once in a lifetime chances.\nBlue board\nPhoenix:\nA piece of cloth with a ton of finely-written characters jammed onto it. Probably esoteric knowledge only mediums should know. ...Hmm, let's see... Here's one in English... It says... \"100 Ways to Save Money\". ... Being a medium sounds like a rough way of life...\nDoor to the Winding Way\nPhoenix:\nThis door leads out to the Winding Way. The weather outside looks really nice.\nTalk\nToday's channeling\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you going to do once the nurse's spirit has been called?\nGrey:\nIsn't it obvious? I'm going to have her write a signed confession.\nPhoenix:\nA signed confession?\nGrey:\nYes, a confession. Pay attention! I'll have her write this: \"One year ago, on May 2nd, 14 patients died due to my negligence. And then, on May 24th, I fell asleep at the wheel and died in a car accident due to my further negligence. I'm sorry and I apologize for being negligent.\" That's what I'll have her write! With a confession, the rain falling on my soul can finally stop.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, I see...\nMaya\nPhoenix:\nSo, how did you hear about Maya Fey...?\nGrey:\nI heard about her from an acquaintance; a girl studying the occult at the college. That girl introduced me to this village. This is the home of the Kurain School of Channeling.\nPhoenix:\nThe home, huh...?\nGrey:\nAnd Ms. Maya is a daughter of the \"Master\", I hear.\nPhoenix:\nMaster...?\nGrey:\nAnyway, do you see that door? That's the room where people and spirits meet. Ms. Maya's aunt is in there right now. Would you care to meet her...?\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nLook, here's my attorney's badge.\nGrey:\nAre you trying to compete with me and my profession with that piece of scrap?\nPhoenix:\n...Uh...\nGrey:\nI am a surgeon. Compared to you lawyers, I'm practically a saint! Yes, well, I don't exactly have any patients right now, but, and listen good! I'm not the one that made the mistake!\nPhoenix:\n(This doctor needs his head examined...)\nGuidemap (Fey Manor)\nPhoenix:\nWow, this manor is really nice, don't you think?\nGrey:\nDo you honestly think this place is all that impressive? Don't make me laugh.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGrey:\nThis is the countryside. Land here is dirt cheap. I will have something much greater one day! I will build my own grand mansion! Did you hear me!? A grand MANSION! This manor will seem like nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh, could you keep that shaking fist away from my face? Thanks...)\nMaya Fey profile\nGrey:\nShe's still young, but one day, she'll bear a big responsibility. She'll be the Master, you know. The MASTER!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there are \"Master\" mediums, too...)\nMorgan Fey profile\nGrey:\nThat's Ms. Maya's aunt. Earlier, she made me eat some sort of traditional dessert the size of a tea saucer! Hmm, I wonder if Ms. Morgan ever performs channelings herself...?\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you have to say about this person, Dr. Grey?\nGrey:\n...This person... Hmm... Judging by their face...\nPhoenix:\nW-What is it?\nGrey:\nThey have a weak stomach.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really...\nJune 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... It's such a strange atmosphere in here... These flickering lights... I guess they're candles...)\n???:\nGood sir! Who might you be...?\nPhoenix:\nAaah! I-I'm, uh, my name is Phoenix Wright...\n???:\nOh... You must be that good sir...\nPhoenix:\n(\"Good sir\"...? Is she talking about me?)\n???:\nYou are a lawyer, are you not, good sir? I have heard much about you from Mystic Maya.\nPhoenix:\nIs that so? (\"Mystic\" Maya...?)\n???:\nI am Mystic Maya's aunt, Morgan Fey.\nPhoenix:\nN-Nice to meet you.\nMorgan:\nAh, I had wanted to speak with you about a certain incident, good sir. It would seem that perhaps you ask too much of Mystic Maya in performing your duties. Most unbecoming, I'm afraid.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMorgan:\nDon't tell me you have already forgotten? That was it not for Mystic Maya and her assistance, you would surely not have won...\nPhoenix:\n(First a girl that runs away, and now an old lady who says I stink at doing my job... When did I become the poster boy for \"How Not to Make a First Impression\"...?)\nMorgan:\nThe past is the past though. Let us speak of the present now.\nPhoenix:\n...Ah, thank you...\nExamine\nDoor\nPhoenix:\nThe Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. There is a giant iron lock where the handle is. It feels like a curtain that separates the normal world from the spirit one.\nFloor panels on left\nPhoenix:\nThis is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air.\nAltar\nPhoenix:\nI guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement.\nMorgan:\nGood sir! I wonder if you would please not touch the sacred objects. Those objects are being offered to the spirits. If you were to touch them, good sir, they would become cursed. Yes, cursed.\nPhoenix:\n(She really didn't have to talk down to me. I'm not that much of an idiot...)\nFolding screen\nPhoenix:\nThis folding screen is really showing its age. All of its edges are a bit tattered. The lettering is fading too. I think I recognize a few of the characters on here... ...Ku ...ra ...in... I'm pretty sure that's what it says... Maybe I'll ask Maya about it later...\nSpace behind folding screen\nPhoenix:\nThere is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark.\nTalk\nMaya\nPhoenix:\nSo why do you add \"Mystic\" to Maya's name. Isn't that a little... strange?\nMorgan:\nGood sir!\nPhoenix:\nYes!\nMorgan:\nHow dare you be so rude and disrespectful towards Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry.\nMorgan:\nShe must be addressed by her proper title, good sir. You must call her \"Mystic Maya\"!\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... So, about Mystic Maya... Uh...\nMorgan:\nIt is the blood.\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me? \"Blood\"?\nMorgan:\nMystic Maya carries the blood of the Master. In actuality, she is the only one remaining.\nPhoenix:\n(Only one remaining...? What's that supposed to mean?)\nMorgan:\nMystic Maya is the last of the rightful heirs of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nPhoenix:\nOK... Then... where do you stand...?\nMorgan:\nThat is a little more complicated... Although a woman of the Fey family, I am merely a member of the branch family.\nPhoenix:\n...Branch family? What's that?\nMorgan:\nIt is as it sounds. For a member of the branch family, no matter her spiritual power, she can never become the Master of the Kurain School.\nPhoenix:\nSo... how strong are you...?\nMorgan:\n... It is a shame, however I will admit. I can not even begin to compare the lowliness of my power to the Master's.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's how it is...)\nToday's channeling\nPhoenix:\nSo today's channeling will be her first?\nMorgan:\nYes, good sir. Because the spirit of a person who dies in a traffic accident is usually very strong, it is usually easier to call that person to our world.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Traffic accident\" indeed.)\nMorgan:\nThe channeling will take place here, in this Channeling Chamber, good sir. As you can see, I am in the process of preparing.\nChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\nSo... this room is the... Channeling Chamber...?\nMorgan:\nThe place where a spirit medium speaks with those who have departed.\nPhoenix:\nI don't suppose you'd mind if we observed the session...\nMorgan:\nDo not even think of such nonsense! Only the medium and the client may enter here.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh.\nMorgan:\nThe secrets of the Kurain Techniques can not be seen by just anybody.\nPhoenix:\n(That never stopped Maya from doing it in front of me before...)\nMorgan:\nIt is also for your safety, good sir, if something were to go wrong. That is why, while channeling is being performed, that heavy door is securely locked...\nPhoenix:\nOh, that's what the lock is for...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nMorgan:\nGood sir!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes!\nMorgan:\nWhen did you... take a hidden picture of Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!? Wait... It's not like that at all!\nMorgan:\nIt is unforgivable!\nPhoenix:\nOw-ow-ow! (Why did she slap me?)\nTurner Grey profile\nPhoenix:\nAbout this person...\nMorgan:\nOh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man.\nPhoenix:\nInsignificant...?\nMorgan:\nThat would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?)\nAnything else\nMorgan:\nGood sir!\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nMorgan:\nWe would like to begin the channeling at 3 o'clock. If you don't mind, good sir, would you mind allowing me to make preparations?\nPhoenix:\nUh, um, sure... go ahead... (She's a Fey alright! Just as odd as the rest.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMorgan:\n... Oh, yes. I wonder if you have yet to meet Pearl, good sir.\nPhoenix:\nPearl?\nMorgan:\nShe is an adorable, angelic young girl.\nPhoenix:\nOh, that odd...\nMorgan:\nShe is my daughter. Now then, what was it you were about to say...?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What a cute daughter you have... Ahaha...\nMorgan:\nA pure heart that knows not of the evils in this world is a powerful thing, good sir. Please refrain from affiliating with her, I request.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it's not like I had the chance to anyway...)\nMorgan:\nI must insist and stress that you not let it occur.\nPhoenix:\nOkay, okay, I get it!\nJune 19Fey ManorWinding Way\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. This garden is really breath-taking. Someone put a lot of love into it. What is that over there...? ...Is that an incinerator? It looks a little out of place in a garden like this...)\nExamine\nGarden\nPhoenix:\nA splendid garden with a small lamp and traditional decorations. It's a bit small to walk around in... Although, that incinerator piques my curiosity...\nIncinerator\nPhoenix:\nIt's a small incinerator. I don't think garbage trucks come all the way out here to a little village like this. So every family has to burn their own trash.\nSide room\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like there's a room over there, too. A peaceful feeling is emanating from it.\nUrn\nPhoenix:\nIt's a really old urn. The ashes of a person long dead are inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on.\nJune 19Fey ManorSide Room\nPhoenix:\n(So this is... the Side Room. Looks like it's more of a break room. There is bedding spread out on the floor. It looks like someone's sleeping in one. I shouldn't disturb them...)\nExamine\nWooden bear sculpture\nPhoenix:\nIt's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir. So does this mean it's easy to spot bears here... And for them to spot you...? *gulp*\nAlcove\nPhoenix:\nIt's a small alcove. I have no idea what it's supposed to mean or symbolize. If I had one of these in the office, it would end up as storage space. But here, it's decorated with some pretty flowers and a beautiful hanging scroll.\nSliding door\nPhoenix:\nThis is the first time I've seen a sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard.\nBed on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's bedding spread out on the floor. Is that someone sleeping in one over there? She's probably an exhausted medium taking a break and catching some z's. If I wake her up, she might be grumpy and throw a spell on me. It's probably a good idea to not disturb her sleep...\nWinding Way (after visiting Side Room and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber)\n???:\nHey! You! Hold on, now! This gal's got a few questions to ask!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I'm sure I've heard that southern accent somewhere before...)\n???:\nOh, well I'll be! It's Mr. Phoenix Wright! How ya been!? Haven't seen you in, what, a year!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... You... are... uh...\nLotta Hair\nPhoenix:\nUm, Lotta Hair, was it?\n???:\nL-L-Lotta Who!? Wait, you best not be making fun of my hair, now!\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, um, I wasn't \"making fun\"... I was \"complimenting\" you on your fine hair...\n???:\nHmph, I dare say yer one heartless man, Mr. Wright. It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty. But looks like you already forgot that.\nPhoenix:\nHold up... you were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak...\n???:\nMinor detail. Stop being so uptight; lettin' little things get in the way. The name's Hart. Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it!\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah! That's it!\nLotta:\nNow listen here. I'm here to take some pictures today. Gonna get myself a real scoop.\nPhoenix:\nAh, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.\nLotta:\nYou betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!?\nLeads to:\n\"Oh, that's right!\"\nLotta Hart\nPhoenix:\nYou're Lotta Hart, right...?\nLotta:\nBingo! I'm the one and only \"paranormal photographer\", Lotta Hart!\nPhoenix:\nAh, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.\nLotta:\nOf course! And today, I'm gonna get myself a real scoop! You wait and see!\nLeads to:\n\"Oh, that's right!\"\nWho are you again?\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but who are you again?\n???:\nOh Lawdy! I've met some cold men in my days, but you... You're in an icebox of yer own!\nPhoenix:\nCome on, am I really that bad...?\n???:\nPut yer noggin to some use! You've gotta remember who I am! It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty.\nPhoenix:\nAh! You're the one from that trial!\n???:\nSee, I knew you could remember if you tried!\nPhoenix:\nYou were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak...\n???:\nWhy don't we let bygones be bygones, now. It's yesterday's news, right? Name's Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it, ya hear!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... So what brings you here today?\nLotta:\nHah! You should already know! I'm here for the big scoop! I can feel it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.\nLotta:\nYou betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!?\nLeads to:\n\"Oh, that's right!\"\nLotta:\nOh, that's right! This ain't no time to be wastin' time! The channeling's about to get started!\nPhoenix:\nIs it that time already!?\nLotta:\nWe all should hurry up and get to the Meditation Room. ...What are you waiting around for!? Come on!\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta Hart, huh? I've been judging her harshly because of that case, but, I guess looking back, we had some good times, too...)\nJune 19Fey ManorMeditation Room\nMorgan:\nWe will now begin the channeling. Mystic Maya and honored guest, please proceed into the Channeling Chamber.\nGrey:\nWith this, I can finally swat all those pesky flies, once and for all! You hear me!? They won't be able to say a single bad thing about me after this! You would love to hear them apologize, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nMe!? Oh, uh, yeah, I sure would.\nMorgan:\nMystic Maya, do you have the Channeling Chamber key?\nMaya:\nYup, right here.\nMorgan:\nThat is most satisfactory. That key is one-of-a-kind, so please take care of it well.\nMaya:\nIt'll be fine, Aunt Morgan. I won't lose it, trust me! OK, Dr. Grey. Let's get started.\nGrey:\nFinally! Let's go!\n*click*\nMorgan:\nNow let us wait patiently out here for them. Please have some lovely bitter green tea and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts...\nLotta:\nHold on, now, granny!\nMorgan:\n...Granny?\nLotta:\nHow come we ain't allowed in that room!?\nMorgan:\nDear madam, you have an \"impressive\" grasp of English. From where did you learn it?\nLotta:\nWhat!? I'm from the heart of the heartland!\nMorgan:\nIs that so? Then I humbly request that you return to this \"Heart of the Heartland\".\nLotta:\nWh-What are ya...?\nMorgan:\nThis is Kurain Village. If you can not follow our traditions and rules, we request that you leave!\nLotta:\n...! ... Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. She shut Lotta up! Now THAT's impressive!)\nMorgan:\nNow then, let us wait.\n*BANG*\nLotta:\nHey now! Wh-What was that just now!?\nPhoenix:\n(It came from inside the Channeling Chamber...)\n*BANG*\nLotta:\nHey! Th-That's a gunshot!\nMorgan:\nE-Excuse me!?\nLotta:\nI've heard that sound before. It's a gunshot! I'd bet my afro on it!\nPhoenix:\n(M-Maya! Maya's in there!)\nBreak into the Chamber\nLotta:\nWell, Mister Lawyer! What's the plan!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat else!? We're going to break in!\nLotta:\nWhat!? But... But there's only one key and that kid's got it.\nPhoenix:\nWe're going to have to break the door. Is that alright, Ms. Fey?\nMorgan:\nWell, yes... But there is one matter... That is...\nPhoenix:\nDon't try to stop me! You can send the repair bill to the Wright & Co. Law Offices later!\nLeads to:\n\"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\"\nAsk Morgan what to do\nPhoenix:\nMs. Fey! What should we do!?\nLotta:\nYellow-bellied chicken liver! What are ya waiting for!? Kick it down already!\nPhoenix:\nBut... The key...\nMorgan:\nThat key is one-of-a-kind. In this world, there is only that one. Even I am powerless to open that door.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, there is really no other way...) Alright. Stand aside! I'm going to break the door down!\nMorgan:\nW-Wait! Please! That sort of recklessness...\nLeads to:\n\"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\"\nLotta:\nYeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\n*SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!*\nPhoenix:\nD-Dr. Grey!!\n*klik*\n???:\n...I... ...I was... murdered...\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya?\n???:\nThat man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\n*klik*\nPhoenix:\nLotta! At a time like this!?\nLotta:\nTimes like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!?\nStep away from there!\nMorgan:\nPlease leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police!\nPhoenix:\nBut, but...\nMorgan:\nHurry! Before there are more victims here!\nLotta:\nHey, let's go, City Boy! Leave this to the granny!\nJune 19Kurain Village\nPhoenix:\n(My cell phone doesn't get reception way out here... So I ended up using the phone booth to call the police...)\nLotta:\nAnd...?\nPhoenix:\nThey're on their way.\nLotta:\nThat's good. Lawdy, I saw a genuine \"mysterious phenomenon\"...\nPhoenix:\n(She seems really on edge because of all this... Not that I blame her... I'm scared to death by what's going on...)\nTalk\nWhat you witnessed\nLotta:\nHey, Mister. That gal... Maya. She wasn't the one that pulled the trigger, was she...?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah... Lotta doesn't know that when Maya is channeling, her whole physical appearance changes.)\nLotta:\nThen again... Weren't there only the two of 'em in there? I reckon she musta done it then...\nDr. Grey\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what do you know about Dr. Grey?\nLotta:\nNot much, but I did some digging... That's one gent with a bad reputation.\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nLotta:\nI hear he's good at surgery and stuff, but his personality stinks like wet sheep.\nPhoenix:\n(I sort of got the same impression myself...)\nLotta:\nHe's real controllin'. Soon as his nurse or patients don't do what he says, he starts a-hollerin'. Musta been real rough to work for him.\nPresent\nAnything\nLotta:\nHey, they'll be here soon, right? The police, I mean. I reckon you should be gettin' back to the crime scene, now.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I guess so...)\nJune 19Fey ManorMeditation Room\nMorgan:\nAh, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nMs. Fey! How's, um... Mystic... Maya?\nMorgan:\nShe has returned to \"this world\". The Spirit Severing Technique was successful.\nPhoenix:\nLet me see her, please!\nMorgan:\nShe is still unconscious. I humbly request that you wait outside for her recovery.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I just have to wait... *sigh*)\nGumshoe:\nThe police are here! Sorry to keep you waiting! Huh? ...You again!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you doing all the way out here, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nIt's actually kinda funny. I was in the area for a business trip, pal. Well, time to check out the crime scene. I'll have to question everyone here later on, so just sit tight, alright?\nPhoenix:\n(Why is he grinning at me...?)\nMorgan:\nShall I show you to the scene of the crime, Detective Gymshoe?\nGumshoe:\nUm... My name isn't Gymshoe...\nPhoenix:\n(The two of them went into the Channeling Chamber... I guess all I can do for now is see what everyone else has to say...)\nJune 19Kurain Village\nLotta:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(She's probably scared out of her wits after having a murder take place right near her.) Lotta?\nLotta:\nGAWDDON'TLETITBEMENEXT!\nPhoenix:\nEek! Don't scare me like that!\nLotta:\nWhat do you mean!? Yer the one scaring me! If I weren't so tough, you'd have another dead body on yer hands -- mine!\nTalk\nAny ideas\nLeads to:\n\"Did you see or notice anything that stuck out at you?\"\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nLotta:\nMust be an awful thing to see each other again and have this happen. Never woulda guessed that gal would end up being a murderer.\nPhoenix:\nThat wasn't Maya! She was being controlled by a spirit...\nLotta:\nCome on, now, City Boy. Ya really think the cops'll believe that?\nTurner Grey profile\nLotta:\nHey, it's that Dr. Grey guy. Pity what happened to him. Pretty scary what ghouls and ghosts can do to a man, huh? Gawd rest his poor soul.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Since when was Lotta so religious...?)\nMorgan Fey profile\nLotta:\nThat old lady sure can be forceful. She scared me back there. ...Well, only a little, now, ya hear?\nDick Gumshoe profile\nLotta:\nI swear I've seen his face before. Maybe during that last case... Whenever something happens, this detective guy is always there. I wonder if he's the real baddie behind everything?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I highly doubt it...)\nAnything else\nLotta:\nNope. Don't know nothin' about that. Things that don't catch my eye, don't catch my interest.\nPhoenix:\n(And she calls herself a journalist??)\nPhoenix:\nDid you see or notice anything that stuck out at you?\nLotta:\nNah... Well, maybe one thing...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it!?\nLotta:\nTurns out my poor stomach's not good at handlin' this kind of thing.\nPhoenix:\nHuh-what?\nLotta:\nCurses and ghosts and stuff comin' back to get ya... This is just too much, I say.\nPhoenix:\nWhat is too much?\nLotta:\nBeing an occult photographer. That's some scary stuff, so I think I'm gonna try being a celebrity photographer, now.\nPhoenix:\nGoing after photos more within your reach from now on? More glamour, less gore?\nLotta:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's up?\nLotta:\nOh, yeah!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nLotta:\nI took some hot pictures earlier!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nLotta:\nRemember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside!\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! She did! Two even!)\nLotta:\n\"The Séance Murder\"... I sure like the ring of that. It'll be a sensational story!\nPhoenix:\nL-Lotta!\nLotta:\nSorry, but my journalistic sense is burnin' inside me! Hate to cut and run, but I'm headin' back in! Gotta beat those cops to the scoop of the century! UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhahahahahahahahahahaha... ...\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know who's scarier... Lotta or the spirits... And why does it feel like we've been through this before...?)\nJune 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\n(The police are busily running here and there, and I don't see Maya anywhere...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, you! Don't touch anything!\nPhoenix:\nLook, I really need to ask you some questions!\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Don't look at me like I'm some sort of uncaring jerk... Tell you what, pal. I'll let you ask me a few questions, alright?\nExamine\nAnywhere\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal! No touching without my permission!\nPhoenix:\nI'm just looking at it.\nGumshoe:\nHey, I can't be too careful if a kid like her can be a murder suspect, now can I?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess if I want to search this room, I'm going to have to come back later...)\nTalk\nMaya\nPhoenix:\nUm, about Maya...\nGumshoe:\nI hate to break this to you, pal, but... with the way things look now, that girl's the only one who could've done it.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah. Only Maya and the victim were inside this room, after all...) But Maya is...\nGumshoe:\nYou can ask more about her later, pal. Right now, I've got a job to do and that's collecting evidence.\nPhoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe looks like a real professional. And yet, something about his expression still looks the same...)\nCause of death\nPhoenix:\nSo... Dr. Grey was shot with a gun, huh?\nGumshoe:\nHe was shot in the forehead. But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nBut he was also stabbed in the chest with a knife.\nPhoenix:\n(...A knife?)\nGumshoe:\nBasically, the vic was first stabbed, then he was shot. (Changed from [After being stabbed, the final blow was a shot from a gun.] in the original release)\nPresent\nAnything\nGumshoe:\nAh, I'm really busy right now. I can take a look at it later, alright, pal?\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't even take a glance at it...)\nJune 19Fey ManorSide Room\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I'm pretty sure there was someone sleeping here earlier...)\n???:\nLike, how can I help you?\nPhoenix:\nAck! Ah, I'm, uh... That is... I...\n???:\nUm, like, so isn't it about time to start?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Time to start what?\n???:\nYou know, like, the channeling!\nPhoenix:\nChanneling...? Oh, oh, oh, oh!! No, actually, the situation has kind of changed...\n???:\nHuh? Like, what do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nPlease stay calm, but... there has been a murder! (Changed from [Please stay calm, but... a murder has taken place!] in the original release)\n???:\n... Um, so, like... A murder is that thing where, like, one person kills another, right?\nPhoenix:\nYes! A person has killed another person!\n???:\nOh, that's... Uh... What are the words I'm looking for...? It's like... ...like totally a bummer.\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah... (After all that effort, that's all she had to say?)\n???:\nOh, I'm sorry. I forgot to, like, introduce myself.\nIni:\nMy name is Ini Miney. Um... At the college, I'm researching and studying \"parapsychology\".\nPhoenix:\n\"Parapsychology\"?\nIni:\nThat's right. Um... I think people, like, usually call it, \"occult studies\" or something. Like supernatural phenomenon, ESP and psychic powers. That sort of stuff.\nPhoenix:\n(That's pretty out there...) I'm Phoenix Wright, attorney at law.\nExamine\nBed on right\nPhoenix:\nYou left the blanket a mess. Are you going to fold it?\nIni:\nLike I had a really good nap, and, like... I was thinking of leaving it like this, so, like, it's all set for tonight.\nTalk\nIni Miney\nPhoenix:\nSo what brings you here today?\nIni:\nUm, like, so... I was the one who told Dr. Grey about this place. He asked me, like, \"Do you know of a good spirit medium?\"\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, Dr. Grey did say something about being introduced to this place.)\nIni:\nCause, like, talking to dead people and, like, multiple personalities are my thing...\nPhoenix:\nI see... Then why were you taking a nap here?\nIni:\nLike... I wasn't feeling good.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nIni:\nI'm, like, allergic to sesame seeds. They, like, must've put some in the food they served for lunch.\nPhoenix:\nOh, that doesn't sound fun.\nIni:\nSo I, like, felt sick, and came in here to, like, sleep. I totally feel, like, I've wasted my time 'cause I, like, slept a long time.\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo you were sleeping here the entire time?\nIni:\nYeah. Ever since lunch...\nPhoenix:\nSo you don't know anything about the murder that took place?\nIni:\nLike, what? Oh, that! I, like, totally know nothing. So who was, like, you know, killed...?\nPhoenix:\nThe surgeon that requested the channeling, Dr. Grey.\nIni:\n...\nThe victim (appears after \"Ini Miney\" and \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nYou and Dr. Grey knew each other, right?\nIni:\n...! I don't know any Dr. Grey!\nPhoenix:\nOh really...? Then what was all that talk about him earlier? (Changed from [That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...] in the original release)\nIni:\nHuh!? ...Well, uh... Like, a long, long time ago... I was, like, a patient, yeah.\nPhoenix:\n(She sounds like she's trying to hide something...)\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nIni:\nOh, hey! That's, like, Maya Fey, right? She's, like, totally waaaay famous! Like, well, for people like us, like, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Waaaay famous\"? Maya?)\nIni:\nI mean, like, she's, like, the daughter of the Master, right?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Well, at least she remembers some things.)\nIni Miney profile\nIni:\nUm... This face... Like, I think I've seen it somewhere before...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? ...Y-You're joking, right?\nIni:\nHa ha, like, of course I am, silly!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, thank goodness...)\nAny other evidence\nIni:\nLike, I'm really sorry, but I'm not all that smart... so I don't, like, get it.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. Why does it feel like she's just putting on an act?)\nAny other profile\nIni:\nI'm, like, totally bad at remembering people's names.\nPhoenix:\nOh?\nIni:\nBut I, like, remember seeing that face somewhere before, like, I think...\nPhoenix:\nWell, thanks for trying. (I didn't think it was possible for someone to be this much of an airhead...)\nJune 19Fey ManorWinding Way\nPhoenix:\n(There's no one here... as usual.) Ack! ...H-Hey... How are you?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYou're Pearl, right?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. Silent as ever... ...? What's that she's got in her hand? I've seen it somewhere before...)\nTalk\nAny option\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?)\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?)\nAfter clearing \"Any ideas\" Talk option in Kurain Village and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber and Fey Manor - Side Room:\nJune 19Fey ManorMeditation Room\nMorgan:\nOh, dear madam... You have such impeccable timing.\nIni:\nLike, what's all the buzz?\nGumshoe:\nAhem. Alright everyone, listen up! You too, pal! I'm going to give you all a brief update! Right now, it looks like the investigation's not going to be done until real late...\nMorgan:\nThat is a terrible shame. I propose that everyone sleep here under the roof of the Fey Manor tonight.\nPhoenix:\n(What a mess. I can't believe how crazy this day turned out... Maya was arrested and taken away by the police. And I don't see myself getting any sleep tonight...)\nJune 20, 8:02 AMFey ManorMeditation Room\nPhoenix:\n(*yawn* Uuugh... Morning... I guess I must have nodded off at some point... I hope Maya's OK. I should hurry and get to the Detention Center, ASAP!)\nJune 20, 10:34 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nN... Nick! Nick! I...!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nWhat am I going to do!? I never imagined it would turn out like this!\nPhoenix:\nCalm down, Maya! Take deep breaths. (Come to think of it, the first time I met her... It all started right here, in this detention center...)\nMaya:\nI finally... I finally get to see you again, and...\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault. You didn't do it.\nMaya:\nNo, I... I did it... I killed that person.\nPhoenix:\nBut that wasn't you.\nMaya:\nIt doesn't matter. It might as well have been me. I was too weak... and I... I couldn't control the spirit's power, so...\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to bring up the case quite yet, but...)\nMaya:\n...You don't have to be nice to me. I understand.\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera.\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. I wonder if he's bored. Not that I can tell since he never looks over this way.\nTalk\nChanneling\nPhoenix:\nSo you're the Master or something of the Kurain School of Channeling...?\nMaya:\nActually, my mother is for now. But since that title is passed from mother to daughter, I guess I will be someday...\nPhoenix:\nBut many people think that channeling isn't real, that it's all just an act.\nMaya:\nYou believe in us, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... because I've seen it with my own eyes. (When Maya's channeling a spirit... not only her voice, but her whole physical appearance changes. It's a supernatural phenomenon that occurs every time. It happened this time, too... Dr. Grey said that he wanted to call the nurse, so... Maya's body must have taken on that nurse's appearance...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nWhat exactly happened in the Channeling Chamber?\nMaya:\n... I went into that room with Dr. Grey, locked the door... and sat down across from him.\nPhoenix:\nOK...\nMaya:\nWe closed our eyes...and I began the channeling.\nPhoenix:\n(This is sounding kind of creepy... like the beginning of a scary story...)\nMaya:\nAnd that's the last thing I remember...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nAfter a spirit comes into my body, I lose my self, my consciousness.\nPhoenix:\nThen, you don't remember a single thing?\nMaya:\nWhen I came to, I was being held in my aunt's arms. And there was blood... all over my clothes.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nMaya:\nOh! But... I do remember having a dream.\nPhoenix:\nA dream...?\n\"Dream\" (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of dream did you have while you were channeling...?\nMaya:\nUm... I can't remember it all that well, but... I was dead and buried in the ground. I couldn't move... and it was unbearable... Really suffocating... ...It went something like that.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see... (I have no idea what to say to that...)\nMaya:\nThere was a really familiar smell too...\nPhoenix:\nUnder the ground?\nMaya:\nYeah, I can't quite place it, but I know I've smelled that same scent before...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nI... I can't face myself...\nPhoenix:\n(I should've known better...)\nTurner Grey profile\nMaya:\n!! T-The... That's the guy I k-killed...\nPhoenix:\nAck! I'm sorry! (Why did I pull this picture out!?)\nPearl Fey profile\nMaya:\nPearly... She definitely has more than me...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What are you talking about?\nMaya:\nWho I think the next Master should be... I mean, she's got more spiritual power than me, and she really works hard at her training...\nPhoenix:\n(Talk about bringing the mood down even further... *sigh*)\nMorgan Fey profile\nMaya:\nI... I can't face my aunt right now... Not now... that this has happened...\nPhoenix:\nIt's alright, Maya. I'm sure she understands. She's on our side, after all.\nMaya:\nYeah, I know... But still...\nLotta Hart profile\nMaya:\nThat's Lotta Hart... right?\nPhoenix:\nThat girl is still after the next sensational photo.\nMaya:\nHa ha. I guess some things never change.\nDick Gumshoe profile\nMaya:\nI felt terrible during the questioning session... I mean, Gumshoe kept looking at me... with these really sad eyes... ...\nAny other evidence\nMaya:\nSorry, Nick, but there's nothing really special about it.\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nSo... what do you think about this person...?\nMaya:\n...?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I can't expect her to know anything about this person.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all the information I'm going to gather for today...) I'll be back later, Maya. In the meantime, please make sure you prepare it, OK?\nMaya:\nHuh? \"It\"? What is \"it\"?\nPhoenix:\nThe document requesting me to be your attorney, of course.\nMaya:\n...! But...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's wrong?\nMaya:\nAre you sure? I mean, I'm guilty! I'm a murderer!\nPhoenix:\nNo one's decided that yet.\nMaya:\nBut I did! I killed that person... with these... two hands...!\nPhoenix:\nThat's enough, Maya.\nMaya:\nIt's hopeless! If you defend me, you'll lose, I'm sure...\nPhoenix:\nStop it!\nMaya:\n... ...Help me... Nick, help me... I'm scared...\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry, I will. When is the trial?\nMaya:\nIt sounds like tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\n(As usual, zero prep time...) Alright. I'm going now.\nMaya:\nWait.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nMaya:\nThis jewel... This is called a Magatama. It's a magical charm and it's always protected me. Give this to Pearly... And I'm sure she'll lend you her spiritual powers.\nMagatama received from Maya.\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nMaya:\nMake sure you show that to Pearly, OK, Nick? I'm sure she'll be a big help to you.\nJune 20Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nPhew. It feels like I've been gone forever. But it's only been one day... (Oh, that's right!) Where's that newspaper Dr. Grey brought the other day...? ...Ah, here it is. Right on top of my desk. (This is the only thing he left behind that's going to be of any help...)\nNewspaper Clipping 1 added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Until recently, it had been a normal, business-class hotel.\nHouseplant\nPhoenix:\nCharley. A quite decorative plant. It's a memento of my boss, Mia... who passed away. The rest of the room may be in shambles, but I always manage to care for this little fella.\nPoster\nPhoenix:\nA poster of the TV action hero, the Steel Samurai. Maya stuck it up here right before she left. I wouldn't say that the Steel Samurai and an attorney's office are a good match, but Maya threatened to curse me with some magic spell... so I guess it can stay.\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long, a layer of dust has started to form. One of these days, I should try to build up the courage to read one... Maybe.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nIt's my desk. I keep it neat for those rare occasions when I actually have a client in the office.\nAfter visiting Wright & Co. Law Offices or Kurain Village:\nJune 20Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(Maya must still be in questioning... I hope the detectives are taking it easy on her, but... these kinds of cases aren't taken lightly. I guess I'll come back later.)\nJune 20Kurain Village\nPhoenix:\n(I have to save Maya, no matter what! It's her life on the line! What in the world happened in that room yesterday?)\nJune 20Fey ManorMeditation Room\nPhoenix:\n(The Meditation Room nurtures all mediums young and old. Even mediums in training, I'd wager. But it's pretty deserted today... ...probably because of the murder yesterday...)\nJune 20Fey ManorChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today... I should take this chance and thoroughly check this room. If I'm lucky, I might uncover a clue or two...\nMorgan:\nOh, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nGood morning.\nMorgan:\nI am on my way to go meet Mystic Maya, and I thought to bring her some items to make her feel more at home. Namely, tea so bitter you lose your tongue and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure Maya will be very grateful...\nMorgan:\nThat's \"Mystic Maya\", good sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. She is one scary lady.)\nMorgan:\nOh, dear, sweet Mystic Maya... Pearl wept constantly for you last night, as did I.\nPhoenix:\n(I know it's important for me to search the site, but I should ask her some questions too, while I have the chance...)\nExamine (left side)\nDoor\nPhoenix:\nThe Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. The lock on it is broken, because, well... I broke it. It doesn't seem possible, but I managed to break it pretty badly. When we want to do something bad enough, people can do the most amazing things.\nFloor panels on left\nPhoenix:\nThis is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air. No matter what I do, my eyes keep getting drawn to the pool of blood in the center here.\nAltar\nPhoenix:\nI guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement. I'd guess they're used during the channeling...\nFolding screen\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful and expensive folding screen. It also looks quite old. There seems to be some sort of sacred text written on it, but I can't read it. ... ! Th-This is... It's a hole! Could this have been made by a bullet?\nFolding Screen added to the Court Record.\nSpace behind folding screen\nPhoenix:\nThere is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. I hope no one is hiding back there.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nI would like to ask you a few questions about what happened yesterday.\nMorgan:\nDo you mean that awful tragedy?\n???:\nThat man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him...\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya?\nStep away from there!\nMorgan:\nPlease leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police!\nPhoenix:\nWhat happened here in this room after I left?\nMorgan:\nWell... First, I struck Mystic Maya on the head.\nPhoenix:\nTo make her go unconscious, correct?\nMorgan:\nThat is correct. Next, I performed the Spirit Severing Technique.\nPhoenix:\n\"Spirit Severing Technique\"?\nMorgan:\nThe spirit of that nurse was inside of Mystic Maya's body. I used the technique to send the nurse's spirit back to the other world.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if this kind of testimony is even admissible in a court of law...)\nChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\nBy the way, what is this room exactly...?\nMorgan:\nThe Channeling Chamber? This room was created for the sole purpose of preventing such a tragedy as yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nMorgan:\nSometimes, when an inexperienced medium calls an especially strong spirit, that spirit may become violent and revolt, as you witnessed yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nRevolt? But how?\nMorgan:\nWhen a spirit enters a medium's body, she loses her will and her self steps aside. To put it another way, the spirit is borrowing the medium's body, good sir.\nPhoenix:\nBut isn't that extremely dangerous?\nMorgan:\nAn experienced medium has little problem controlling a spirit.\nPhoenix:\nBut Maya... I mean, Mystic Maya... That was her first channeling...\nMorgan:\nAnd that was why I insisted on locking the door. However, I never thought that would be calling danger upon the client himself... I am grateful that one of our heirlooms was not damaged in this horrible incident.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that would be...? (Changed from [And that is...?] in the original release)\nMorgan:\nThat folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings. (Changed from [It is that folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings.] in the original release) Along with the Kurain Sacred Urn, they are this village's most treasured possessions. If I ever found out that something had happened to either one... Oh, the inhumanity...\nPhoenix:\n(Odd for her to be worrying about the folding screen at a time like this... I guess this isn't just some dilapidated old screen after all...)\nPearl\nPhoenix:\nSo... How is Pearl today...?\nMorgan:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMorgan:\nIn this world, Pearl is my most treasured possession. When compared to even Mystic Maya, Pearl has the spiritual power to become a Master.\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's very impressive.\nMorgan:\nUntil now, the women of the branch family have thought themselves to be inferior. .. But. Pearl is different! Her spiritual strength is so great; even greater than some of the main family! Yes, Pearl is a channeling prodigy and is the pride of the branch family!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... She's really fired up now...)\nMorgan:\nIn any case... Our world is so different from yours, perhaps it is best for you to quit, good sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Quit\"? Quit what?\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nMorgan:\n...Oh my!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nMorgan:\nThat... That is Mystic Maya's Magatama. Why would you have this in your possession!?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry!\nMorgan:\nReturn it to Mystic Maya at once!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, madam! (Why did I feel like I was being scolded by my own mother just now...?)\nFolding Screen\nMorgan:\nAh, so even someone such as yourself can take interest in something like this. This is the Kurain Channeling Technique Sacred Writings. There are 6 panels in all.\nPhoenix:\nI see... But that's not what caught my eye. You see this hole here...?\nMorgan:\nIt is an old screen, you see. It is only logical that perhaps a bug or worm of some sort is the culprit.\nPhoenix:\n(Even though this looks nothing like the eating patterns of any bug I know...)\nMaya Fey profile\nMorgan:\nI can hardly believe Mystic Maya has become like this. Directly influenced by the likes of you, and becoming caught up in a situation such as this...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry... (...Hey, hold on! How is all this MY fault!?)\nMorgan:\nI told her so many times, as I have also told Pearl, \"Do not associate with strange old men you don't know\".\nPhoenix:\n(Well, that shouldn't apply to me then, especially since I'm hardly an \"old man\" yet!!)\nTurner Grey profile\nMorgan:\nThat doctor was one of those people. Those who intend harm upon the spirits receive harm in return; it's karma at work. It seems that he was the one to take the nurse's life, wouldn't you agree?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that's possible...)\nPearl Fey profile\nMorgan:\nGood sir!\nPhoenix:\nY...Yes?\nMorgan:\nWhen did you take this picture!? This is one of those... what are they called...? Those... \"hidden camera\" pictures!\nPhoenix:\nN-No!! It's not one of those at all!!\nMorgan:\nSuch an unforgivable offense! You will hand it over to me!\nPhoenix:\nN-No! I won't! (If I ever want to talk about Pearl again, I should be much more careful...)\nMorgan Fey profile\nMorgan:\nIt shows the same face as the one I see in the mirror every day.\nPhoenix:\nAnd? Anything else?\nMorgan:\nNo. That is all.\nPhoenix:\n(Why in the world did I bother to show this to her!?)\nAny other evidence\nMorgan:\nI will be leaving shortly to meet with Mystic Maya. I simply do not have the time to look at such trivial matters.\nAny other profile\nMorgan:\nWe usually do not welcome strangers into our village as they disturb the aura here. Especially people like you, good sir.\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey, what do you mean, \"especially people like me?\"\nMorgan:\nYou selfishly make Mystic Maya help you with your work... You should be thankful I have not taken your life for such a disrespectful act.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, madam...\nMorgan:\nAnd even more importantly, remember that if anything were to happen to Pearl...\nPhoenix:\n(What is that supposed to mean!?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen:\nMorgan:\nWell, then, I do believe it is time for me to take my leave.\nPhoenix:\nAlright. Please tell Maya I said hi.\nMorgan:\nWhat was that!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, I mean, Mystic Maya.\nMorgan:\nI will tell her.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh*)\nJune 20Fey ManorWinding Way\nPhoenix:\n(Little Pearl isn't here today... Maybe she's at school?)\nJune 20Fey ManorSide Room\nIni:\nOh, hey! Like, you're that guy from yesterday... The, uh, dentist guy...\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, I'm a lawyer.\nIni:\nThat's right! Um... Mr. Smith, Esquire.\nPhoenix:\n...That's \"Wright\". Wait, I mean, you're wrong. My name is \"Wright\".\nIni:\n\"Smith\", \"Wright\"... Well, I got, like, three letters, at least.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think she gets the point...) Anyway, why are you here?\nIni:\nSo, like, I study this thing called \"parapsychology\" at this college and...\nPhoenix:\nUm, you told me about that yesterday. The sesame allergy, too. What I'd really like to know is why you're still here today?\nIni:\nOh! So, like, that's what you meant! Like, you shoulda been more, like, clear about it!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry. My bad.\nIni:\nNo, it's OK. Like, it's really...\nPhoenix:\n...\nIni:\n...?\nPhoenix:\n...That's it? Why'd you stop mid-sentence!?\nIni:\nDid I? ...So, like... what was I talking about again...?\nPhoenix:\n... (If Lotta ever wanted another \"genuine mysterious phenomenon\", it's right here.)\nExamine\nWooden bear sculpture\nPhoenix:\nIt's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir.\nIni:\nIsn't it cuuuuute? I, like, totally bought that!\nPhoenix:\nAh... so it's yours, huh?\nIni:\nYeah. So, like, this village is really famous for, like, channeling and bears.\nPhoenix:\nHeh. (...Wait. Famous for bears!?)\nIni:\nBut it's, like, OK. If you ever, like, see a bear, you just play dead, and they, like, leave you alone.\nPhoenix:\nI-Is that right?\nIni:\nYeah. Cause, like, fighting back is totally of no use.\nPhoenix:\n(Has she actually tried to fight one!?)\nYellow box\nPhoenix:\nHmm, now where did this box come from? I'm sure this wasn't here last night. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom.\nTalk\nIni Miney\nPhoenix:\nSo? Why are you still here today?\nIni:\nLike, there's so much for me to, like, study here!\nPhoenix:\nLike what?\nIni:\nLike, the medium's training, or like, how they inherit their spiritual power.\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose... This village is the real thing, after all.)\nIni:\nSo, like, I asked if I could stay here for, like, a little longer.\nPhoenix:\n(She sure seems like the care-free type, at least, on the surface...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nHave you heard about the murder?\nIni:\nIt's, like, totally scary.\nPhoenix:\n(...she says, with a silly smile plastered on her face...) ...So do you know anything about it that might help?\nIni:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think she has a grip on reality, let alone what's going on here.)\nThe victim\nPhoenix:\nAbout the victim, Dr. Grey...\nIni:\nI don't know who you're talking about. ...Like... Wait, I think you asked about him, like, yesterday, too...\nPhoenix:\n(That's right... Her reaction yesterday when I asked was...)\nPhoenix:\nYou and Dr. Grey knew each other, right?\nIni:\n...! I don't know any Dr. Grey!\nPhoenix:\nOh really...? Then what was all that talk about him earlier? (Changed from [That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...] in the original release)\nIni:\nHuh!? ...Well, uh... Like, a long, long time ago... I was, like, a patient, yeah.\nPhoenix:\n(OK, she is definitely hiding something from me...)\nIni:\n...Like, is something wrong?\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nWould you take a look at this?\nIni:\nHey! It's, like, one of those little badges people in Congress all wear...\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no. I'm a lawyer. L-A-W-Y-E-R!!\nIni:\n...? Like, so is that what you are?\nMaya's Magatama\nIni:\nWow! It's a Magatama! Aww, you shouldn't have!\nPhoenix:\nIt's so totally not for you!\nIni:\nHey! Like, it's not nice to freak me out like that!\nPhoenix:\n(That should be my line...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about this girl...\nIni:\nOh, that's, like, Maya Fey. She's, like, the Master's daughter.\nPhoenix:\nYou surprise me. You knew that?\nIni:\nWell, like, I totally know everyone related to the occult. Maya is, like, an idol among spirit mediums.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya an idol? I guess stranger things have happened.)\nMorgan Fey profile\nIni:\nThat's Morgan Fey. Like, she's been totally helpful.\nPhoenix:\n(Did she just bow to the picture...?)\nIni:\nSo what about her?\nPhoenix:\nOh, nothing in particular. I just wanted to know what you knew about her.\nIni:\nUm... Well, she's, like, a really good person.\nPhoenix:\nI see.\nIni:\nLike totally.\nPhoenix:\nOK. (This is going nowhere...)\nIni Miney profile\nIni:\nUm... This face... Like, I think I've seen it somewhere before...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? ...Y-You're joking, right?\nIni:\nHa ha, like, of course I am, silly!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, thank goodness...)\nAny other evidence\nIni:\nLike, I'm really sorry, but... And I know, like, you totally had your heart set on it, but I can't, like, take it.\nPhoenix:\n(Who said anything about giving this to you!?)\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you know about this person...?\nIni:\nI'm, like, sorry, but it's totally, like, time for my nap...\nPhoenix:\n*yawn* (Ack! She's even got ME yawning!)\nIni:\nAnd I, like, totally don't care about that person anyway...\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber, and clearing \"The victim\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Side Room:\nJune 20Fey ManorWinding Way\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAck! Y-You surprised me!\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd how are you today?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I guess she isn't open to friendly chatting... Huh? She's still holding something in her hand... ...It looks like the same thing she had yesterday...)\nTalk\nAny option\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nPearl:\nAaaah!\nPhoenix:\nH-Huh?? (If only I had something that would catch her interest. Maybe then she'd talk to me.)\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nLeads to:\n\"Oh yeah. Maya said to give this to you...\"\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nCan you take a look at this? Please?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... She's really scrutinizing my face...)\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Th-That's enough already! I'm not that shifty-looking, am I!?)\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah. Maya said to give this to you...\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! I'm in trouble now!! If Morgan sees us like this, I'll be the next one they're channeling...)\nPearl:\nTh-That's... That's Mystic Maya's...\nPhoenix:\n...Huh!? (Sh-She actually spoke!)\nPearl:\nWho are you...?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm Phoenix Wright. I, uh, worked with Maya...\nPearl:\n...Y-You worked with Mystic Maya...? You... You're Mr. Nick, right?\nPhoenix:\n...Uh, excuse me? (I bet I know who she picked \"Nick\" up from...)\nPearl:\nI know who you are. You're... You're Mystic Maya's... \"special someone\"...\nPhoenix:\nWH-WH-WH-WHAT!?\nPearl:\nSo then... Of course! You're going to help Mystic Maya, aren't you? That's what you're going to do, right?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, yeah... I will...\nPearl:\nOh wow... It's like a beautiful fairy tale! That earnest look shining brightly in your eyes... It must be true love...\nPhoenix:\n...Wh-What!? (Why am I being boiled into a bright red lobster by this little kid!?)\nPearl:\nI'm so jealous of Mystic Maya! Ah, what a wonderful relationship...\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait... I... uhh... I mean... We aren't... Things aren't like...\nPearl:\nHee hee, I can tell you're a good person. Alright, Mr. Nick! I may be small, but I'm going to help you in any way I can!\nTalk\nPearl\nPhoenix:\nPearl, are you friends with Maya?\nPearl:\nI feel very grateful to be friends with her... She's so great. I want to be like Mystic Maya when I grow up. I really look up to her.\nPhoenix:\nWow, I had no idea Maya was so... revered.\nPearl:\nUsually when people don't use Mystic Maya's title, I get mad.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, sorry.\nPearl:\nBut if it's you, Mr. Nick, then it's OK. Because... Because... you're \"special\" to her.\nPhoenix:\n(Where in the world did she get an idea like that??)\nPearl:\nBy the way... this may be rude, but which channeling school are you from?\nPhoenix:\nWhich channeling school?\nPearl:\nYes. For example, I study the Kurain technique.\nPhoenix:\n... Ah, I get it! No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. A lawyer.\nPearl:\n...Law...yer?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nPearl:\n...Is that related to spirit mediums in any way...?\nPhoenix:\n(Um... None that I know of...) Wait, are you telling me you don't know what a lawyer is?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but I have no idea.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya did say Pearl doesn't know much about the outside world...)\nThe item in your hand\nPhoenix:\nSo what's that you've got there, Pearl?\nPearl:\nOh, this? I found it yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nPearl:\nIf you want it, I can give it to you.\nAccept it\nLeads to:\n\"Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\"\nDon't accept it\nPhoenix:\nI can't take something this important from you, Pearl.\nPearl:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\n(But I'm sure I've seen that key somewhere before... ...and it might be an important clue later on...)\nLeads to:\n\"Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\"\nPhoenix:\nAlright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\nPearl:\nHee hee. You look like a child at a toy store, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(...She not only speaks in a refined manner, but laughs in one, too!)\nBlack Key added to the Court Record.\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nPhoenix:\nSo this is...\nPearl:\nThat is Mystic Maya's Magatama. It's one of the most important heirlooms of Kurain Village. Please make sure to take good care of it.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I will. (Is it really OK for me to have such a priceless object?)\nFolding Screen\nPearl:\nAre you interested in Kurain's traditional things too, Mr. Nick? The Kurain Sacred Writings are on this folding screen.\nPhoenix:\nOh? Is that what's written on it? Actually, what caught my eye was this \"hole\" in it...\nPearl:\nIt's a very old screen, so I think that maybe bugs made it by eating through it.\nPhoenix:\n(...It sure doesn't look like something bugs can make...)\nBlack Key\nPhoenix:\nAbout this key...\nPearl:\nI found it while I was playing in the garden yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nI've seen it before too, you know?\nPearl:\n...? Really?\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nI look up to Mystic Maya a lot. She's my role model. She's so smart, and pretty, and kind, and loving. She's always cheerful, never gets sick, isn't picky, and has good sleeping habits. She always wakes up before me, and always eats breakfast before me too. And she has you; such a wonderful person with whom she can share a lo-\nPhoenix:\nAck! OK, OK! I get the idea! (She really thinks the world of Maya, doesn't she?)\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nTo tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother won't let me.\nPhoenix:\nYour hair now suits you quite well, though, I think.\nPearl:\nR-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*\nPhoenix:\n*fidget, fidget*\nMorgan Fey profile\nPearl:\nOh, it's my mother! She takes really good care of me and loves me very much. She says I'm the \"pride of the branch family\"... But I don't know what that means.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Branch family\"... That concept is probably still too hard for little Pearl...)\nAny other evidence\nPearl:\nI'm sure it is helpful to you in some way, but I'm still in training, so I don't know anything about it. I'm really, deeply sorry.\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no, it's OK. I shouldn't have shown you something so trivial anyway. I'm very sorry. (This feels so weird, talking to a kid like this...)\nAny other profile\nPearl:\nHmm, I'm sorry I don't know who this person is.\nPhoenix:\nI guess that makes sense... You've never left Kurain village, after all.\nPearl:\nI'm really sorry, Mr. Nick. I just don't really know anyone outside the village.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Pearls? I can call you that, right? You're too cute to just call you Pearl.\nPearl:\nSure, Mr. Nick... Umm... Are you sure it's OK for me to have this Magatama?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it's OK. I was told to give it to you.\nPearl:\nBut, I can't accept something like this! ...All I really should do is charge this Magatama with spiritual energy...\nPhoenix:\nSpiritual energy?\nPearl:\nPlease take this. I'm sure it will be helpful.\nPhoenix:\n...What do you mean?\nPearl:\nIt will let you see people's secrets.\nPhoenix:\nSee people's... secrets...?\nPearl:\nYes. ...If it's alright with you, I would like to accompany you for a little while. I can explain the Magatama's power to you when we meet someone hiding a secret.\nJune 20Fey ManorMeditation Room\nGumshoe:\nHey, it's you, pal! So you're going to be her lawyer, I bet.\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nGumshoe:\nOh... I really feel bad for you, pal. Just this once, I wish I could be on your side.\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but I shouldn't be saying that kind of stuff to you. Hey! You're a cute kid.\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nHa ha ha. I'm not scary. Honest!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, I never knew Gumshoe liked kids...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol...\nPhoenix:\nD-Detective Gumshoe!! What are you doing showing her something that dangerous!\nGumshoe:\nOh, sorry...\nTalk\nMaya's guilt\nPhoenix:\nWhat about Maya and the charges against her?\nGumshoe:\nI don't think you can win, pal. If you're talking about proof, we've got a few pieces.\nPhoenix:\nYou've got proof...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal. That puffy-haired photographer's going to testify tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\n(He must be talking about Lotta. Actually... speaking of Lotta...)\nLotta:\nI took some hot pictures earlier!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nLotta:\nRemember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside!\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta's \"hot pictures\"... I wonder what her camera captured...?)\nGumshoe:\n...Besides, you must've realized by now, pal. There's no way anyone other than Maya Fey could've done it.\nPhoenix:\n(...!)\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(What am I supposed to say to Pearls now...?)\nThe victim\nPhoenix:\nAbout Dr. Grey...\nGumshoe:\nThe victim wasn't super famous, but people still knew who he was. His face was all over those tabloid shows last year.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know.\nGumshoe:\nI was looking through some newspapers from last year, and... ... Huh? I could've sworn I had... I cut an article out, but I guess I must've lost it...\nPhoenix:\n(He's searching through his pockets... And boy, are those big...)\nGumshoe:\nHmm... It looked really interesting, too. Hey, do you have a copy, pal?\nPhoenix:\n(A copy of that article...? I think Dr. Grey might have brought a copy to the office when he came by...)\nTomorrow's trial\nPhoenix:\nAbout Maya's trial tomorrow...\nGumshoe:\nI've got two pieces of news for you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nTwo?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. \"Bad news\" and \"even worse news.\" So which do you want to hear first?\nPhoenix:\n...I don't really care... It doesn't change the fact that I'm not going to like it.\nGumshoe:\nAlright, pal. Well, the prosecutor for the trial is Prosecutor von Karma.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!? Von Karma!?\nPhoenix:\n(Manfred von Karma... He was an awe-inspiring veteran prosecutor. He never lost a case in the 40 years of his career, and he raised a fearsome disciple. The horrible aftertaste of the evil he force-fed me is something I'll never forget.)\nPhoenix:\n... Wait a sec. But didn't Von Karma stand trial and...\nGumshoe:\nThat's where the other piece of bad news comes in... The Von Karma you're facing tomorrow is actually his successor...\nPhoenix:\nSuccessor...?\nSuccessor (appears after \"Tomorrow's trial\")\nPhoenix:\nSo, um... Who is this \"successor\" to Von Karma?\nGumshoe:\nLiterally, pal, it's Prosecutor von Karma's kid. His kid became a prosecutor real young... like 13, and hasn't lost a trial since. That's what they call a \"prodigy,\" pal.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Kid, huh... ... W-W-Wait a sec! Th-Th-Thirteen!? The kid became a prosecutor at the age of THIRTEEN!? I mean, a prodigy like that... I would have heard something about...\nGumshoe:\nOh, no, no. The kid was born and raised in Germany, pal. That country's got a lot of stuff and is a great place to develop a person's talents.\nPhoenix:\n(Germany, huh? That's probably why I've never heard of this person. Ugh... Still, all it takes is someone mentioning the name \"Von Karma\", and I get terrible flashbacks to that case. Stop it! Get a grip on yourself, Phoenix! (Changed from [Stop it! Get over it, Phoenix!] in the original release) None of that matters anymore... now that he's gone... (Changed from [That person is already gone...] in the original release))\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nHey, look. It's my attorney's badge.\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge.\nPearl:\nUh, um... Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nI was wondering if I could see it, too?\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, it's OK. It's not that important anyway.\nMaya's Magatama\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, that's a pretty nice-looking brooch! You should stop wearing that ugly old attorney's badge, and start wearing that, pal.\nPearl:\nHee, hee. That detective is so nice! Aren't you happy, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Happy?... About what?)\nNewspaper Clipping 1\nPhoenix:\nUm, Dr. Grey brought this over to my office the other day, and...\nGumshoe:\nHey! It's that news story! The one about the malpractice suit!\nPhoenix:\nFourteen patients died and it caused a huge stink.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but that's not all, pal. Things only got worse after that.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the car accident the nurse died in?\nGumshoe:\n...Hmm... Oh, here we go. I brought my own clipping with me today. Here, pal, this is for you.\nPhoenix:\nAlright. Thanks.\nNewspaper Clipping 2 added to the Court Record.\nNewspaper Clipping 1 (subsequent times)\nGumshoe:\nThe nurse that killed the patients ended up getting killed in an accident. Dr. Grey wound up on a lot of tabloid shows because of that. Now, there was a smart man. I'm sure that was a great way to advertise for his clinic.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh, huh. Scaring people off is always the best way to get more patients.)\nBlack Key\nPhoenix:\nSo about this key...\nGumshoe:\nHey, is that your house key or something, pal?\nPhoenix:\nCome on, does this look like a house key to you?\nGumshoe:\nThen what's it for?\nPhoenix:\nIt's... ... (Hmm, actually, I should probably keep that a secret...) It's my bicycle key.\nGumshoe:\nOh. Nothing special, huh?\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry things had to turn out this way, pal.\nPhoenix:\nIt's too early to give up! No one's proven her guilty of anything, yet!\nGumshoe:\nLook, even if there were a zillion of you, pal, this is a case you... *sigh*\nPhoenix:\n(Now why is he sighing?)\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nOh, so that's little Pearl.\nPhoenix:\nDo you know her?\nGumshoe:\nOnly that Ms. Fey was looking for her earlier. Something about being worried that she'll end up talking to the weird guy. So, you have any idea who this \"weird guy\" is, pal?\nPhoenix:\n...Nope. Not a clue.\nMorgan Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nThat's Maya's aunt, right? I got to eat one of her giant strawberry desserts earlier. It was really good!\nPhoenix:\n(Aw, I didn't get to eat one yet...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nBoy do I look scary in this picture. I guess if I want people to stop thinking cops are scary, I have to change myself. Gotta smile, gotta smile!\nPhoenix:\n(There's that classic Gumshoe goofy smile again...)\nAny other evidence\nGumshoe:\nOoh, I'd better shut my mouth.\nPhoenix:\nUh, what?\nGumshoe:\nI'm not gonna give you any information about evidence, pal.\nPhoenix:\nOh.\nAny other profile\nGumshoe:\nI don't have anything to tell you about this one, pal.\nPhoenix:\nYou don't have to be so mean about it.\nGumshoe:\nNot. A. Word.\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nH-H-Hey! Don't look at me like that!\nPhoenix:\n(That girl has one intense stare... *gulp*)\nJune 20Fey ManorSide Room\nPhoenix:\nHello again. We seem to be seeing a lot of each other today.\nIni:\nAww, she's, like, tooootally cute! Is she, like, your daughter?\nPhoenix:\nW-What!? NO! (How old do you think I am!?)\nTalk\nThe victim\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about the victim, Dr. Grey.\nIni:\nI, like, totally don't know him.\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nPhoenix:\nAaack! What is that!?\nIni:\n...?\nPearl:\nYou can see it, can't you, Mr. Nick? You can see the \"lock\" on that person's heart.\nPhoenix:\nHuh, what...?\nPearl:\nThis is the power of the Magatama. Only you can see these \"Psyche-Locks\", Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(Psyche-Locks, huh...)\nPearl:\nThe more someone wants to hide their secret, the more locks you will see. If it's only one, I think you can easily unlock it.\nPhoenix:\n\"Unlock\"...? But how?\nPearl:\nPlease use Mystic Maya's Magatama on this person, and let's remove the lock.\nPhoenix:\n(I have no idea what she's talking about, but... Guess I'll give it a try.)\nPearl:\nYou must be careful, though, Mr. Nick. If you make a mistake, it will hurt you. If you don't think you have the proof you need, you must have the courage to stop.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I've got to start somewhere. Let's give this Psyche-Lock thing a try.)\nThe victim (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIim going to ask you again. Did you know Dr. Grey?\nIni:\nI totally don't know that guy. Like, you're totally more presistent than a roach!\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nPhoenix:\n(This girl is hiding something! I'm sure of it! I guess I have no choice but to remove this lock.

I believe you do know who Dr. Grey is!\nIni:\nI told you! Like, how many times do I, like, have to repeat myself? If you're, like, so totally sure, then where's, like, your proof?\nPhoenix:\nWhile it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person, I do believe you might have at least, indirectly known of him.\nIni:\nLike, what do you mean, like, \"indirectly\"...?\nPhoenix:\n(I should try to show that the possibility existed for now...) (Hmm, so, something that shows a possible connection between Ini and Dr. Grey...)\nPresent Newspaper Clipping 2\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Take a look at this newspaper clipping.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere is your proof!\nIni:\nLike, what is that...?\nPhoenix:\nOuch... I guess it doesn't have anything to do with it, huh? (Pearls did warn me... \"If you make a mistake, it will hurt you,\" she said. If I don't have enough evidence, I should probably \"stop\". I should take another look at the Court Record and think it through one more time.)\nLeads back to:\n\"While it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person,\"\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this newspaper clipping.\nIni:\nLike, what is it? ... A story about an accident?\nPhoenix:\nPlease read the victim's name.\nIni:\nUm...\"Mimi Miney\"...\nPhoenix:\n\"Miney\" is a pretty rare last name, wouldn't you say? Ms. Mimi Miney wouldn't happen to be a relative of yours, would she?\nIni:\n...! So you noticed. Sh-She was my older sister.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry about your loss... Your sister... Was she a nurse... Perhaps at Dr. Grey's surgical clinic?\nIni:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nGrey Surgical Clinic... I don't think I need to tell you that the clinic was run by the victim, Dr. Turner Grey. Which is how you knew of Dr. Grey; you knew him through your sister!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nPhoenix:\nPlease, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey.\nIni:\nMy... My sister's name was Mimi Miney. She was, like, a nurse at Dr. Grey's clinic.\nPhoenix:\n(That's what I thought...)\nIni:\nI heard that, like, Dr. Grey was really tough on people. Like, a total slave driver. My sis was, like, always coming home totally wiped out 'cause she was overworked.\nPhoenix:\nWiped out? So is that why she fell asleep at the wheel?\nIni:\nThat guy, like, drove my sis so hard, so, like, that's why the accident happened.\nPhoenix:\nThe one where 14 patients died from malpractice?\nIni:\nYeah, like, I think that was the doctor's fault, too. My sis was pushed by, like, everyone's expectations and, like, her duties and stuff. And that pushed her to her death.\nPhoenix:\nOh... I'm sorry...\nIni:\nSo, like, are we done? I've, like, already told my story to, like, everyone...\nPearl:\nDo you understand now, Mr. Nick? This is how a Psyche-Lock works.\nPhoenix:\n...Well, I don't plan to pry into people's hearts unless I absolutely need to...\nPearl:\nThe lock this time was pretty easy, but... you might meet people who aren't as willing to give in later on.

Please tell her I said hi.\nPhoenix:\nHey, wait! (She ran off... Again. Well, I know Ini's secret now, but... I still don't have any idea how I'm going to save Maya.

Can I really do anything? Can I really save her...?)\n???:\nSorry to keep you waiting.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? Must be Maya...)\n???:\nIt's been a long time, hasn't it, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\n...! (That voice...) M-Mia!\nMia:\nEven without me being here, it looks like you've learned to stand on your own.\nPhoenix:\n(Mia... She's Maya's older sister, and my mentor. She was a top-notch defense lawyer, but a certain case forced her into \"retirement\". But... whenever I'm in trouble, she comes to help, just like this. Her spirit comes back from the other world and borrows Maya's body for a bit...)\nMia:\nPhoenix, you can't make that kind of face in front of your client.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nMia:\nA lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets, and especially when it's bad.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nYou can't smile at the end if you haven't been smiling the whole way there. In any case, the face you're making now is no face to show a client, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nB-But!\nMia:\nSo, tell me all about it. I'm going to guess that my sister is in a lot of trouble again...\nPhoenix:\n(I told her everything about what had happened in the last two days. Mia closed her eyes, deep in thought, while she listened...)\nMia:\n...I see...\nPhoenix:\nMia... What am I supposed to do?\nMia:\n... It's pretty clear what a good lawyer does in this situation.\nPhoenix:\nA-And that is!? Tell me, please!\nMia:\nBelieve in your convictions. And fight for the complete acquittal of your client.\nTalk\nNot guilty\nPhoenix:\nYou think Maya's not guilty!? How can you be so sure!?\nMia:\nI know she is. And I'll give you a hint as to why.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nMediums can't have dreams.\nPhoenix:\nCan't have \"dreams\"...?\nMia:\nFrom what you told me, it sounds like Maya was having a dream while channeling.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... She said she dream that she had died and had been buried in the ground.\nMia:\nBut that is impossible. You've heard it from her, I'm sure. When a medium channels, her own spirit disappears. Which means that it's impossible for her to dream during that time.\nPhoenix:\n...! Then... What does this mean!?\nMia:\nI think it's safe to bet that Maya was set-up.\nPhoenix:\nA set-up!?\nMia:\nIt's up to you to blow the lid on this case tomorrow and show how she was set-up.\nEvidence?\nPhoenix:\nHow am I supposed to prove her innocence when I have nothing to go on!?\nMia:\nIf you're looking for a clue, it's already in your hands.\nPhoenix:\nI-It is!?\nMia:\nJust as it sounds, Phoenix, you already hold the \"key\".\nPhoenix:\n(R-Really...?)\nMia:\nCome on, show me the \"key\" to this case.\nPhoenix:\n(The \"key\", huh?

Take good care of it, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(She looks at it with such a soft look in her eyes...)\nBlack Key\nPhoenix:\nMia, have you seen this key before?\nMia:\nAhh, the key... It's literally, the key to understanding everything that's happened in this case.\nPhoenix:\nThis key?\nMia:\nPhoenix, listen. Right now, that key is sitting in your hand. However, it shouldn't be. ... It contradicts the \"facts\".\nPhoenix:\n(What does she mean...?)\nMia:\nI'm certain this key will be the piece of evidence that makes your case tomorrow.\nMaya Fey profile\nMia:\nI can't see Maya... when I'm in her body like this...

I left Kurain Village a long time ago. She probably doesn't remember a thing about me by now...\nMorgan Fey profile\nMia:\nI'm afraid I might have caused Aunt Morgan a lot of stress. When I left Kurain, I left Maya in my aunt's care. And now something like this happens...\nDick Gumshoe profile\nMia:\nI've seen this man somewhere before...

I'm already dead.

He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor...

Thanks for coming all this way!\nPearl:\nI was really worried about you...\nMaya:\nHey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together?\nPearl:\nMother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks.\nMaya:\nHuh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself?\nPearl:\nYup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map.\nPhoenix:\nDon't tell me you walked all the way here...\nPearl:\nOf course not! ...I ran!\nPhoenix:\nThat's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...)\nMaya:\nPearly... What about the train?\nPearl:\nHuh? What's a... \"tray-in\"?\nPhoenix:\n(I give up...)\nPearl:\n...It's time, isn't it?\nMaya:\nUm... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma!\nPearl:\nMr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that?\nMaya:\nUm, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend. I still remember him as though I'd seen him only yesterday.

And he's not coming back...\nMaya:\nWhaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!?\nBailiff:\nCourt will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom.\nPhoenix:\n... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway.\nMaya:\nN...Nick...?\nJune 21, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared?\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... (What is with this kid...?) (Changed from [... (What is with this girl...?)] in the original release)\nJudge:\n... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you prepared!? (Changed from [*Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nHuh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?)\n???:\nMr. Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\n...!\n???:\nYou must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct?\nPhoenix:\n(...Hold on. So SHE'S the famed \"successor\" to Prosecutor von Karma...?) (Changed from [...Hold on. So this kid is the 'famed' Prosecutor von Karma...?] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nI am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy.\nPhoenix:\nI... see...\nvon Karma:\nI gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge.\nPhoenix:\nRevenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?)\nJudge:\nUm... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww!\nvon Karma:\nI'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me.\nPhoenix:\n(Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!!\nvon Karma:\nMake no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nJudge:\nProsecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please...\nvon Karma:\nThose of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is \"perfection\". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch.\nJudge:\nV-Very well... What is the defense's position?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor.\nJudge:\nDoes the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes.\nvon Karma:\nFoolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Justified self-defense\"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of themself. (Changed from [A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself.] in the original release) We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of \"not guilty\", Your Honor! (Because to plead \"justified self-defense\" is to say you did kill someone.)\nvon Karma:\nHow foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness.\nPhoenix:\n(She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.)\nvon Karma:\nWitness, your name and occupation?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!!\nvon Karma:\nGet to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room.\nJudge:\nWhat were they doing in there?\nGumshoe:\nUm... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir.\nJudge:\nCh-Channeling a spirit??\nPhoenix:\n(That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\n*ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room.\nJudge:\nAh, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over.\nFloor Plans added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nSo, how was the victim killed?\nGumshoe:\nI was about to get to that...\nvon Karma:\nStop wasting my time, then.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Cause of Death --\nGumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.\nJudge:\nHmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot...\nGumshoe:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report, sir.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nThe court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.\nCross Examination\n-- Cause of Death --\nGumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim? Now, why would he have...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\n\"Why would he have a pistol?\" Who cares? The point that you are missing is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start.\nJudge:\nFingerprints? There were fingerprints?\nGumshoe:\nAlong with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir.\nJudge:\nHmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...! I walked right into her hands there.) (Changed from [Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nPoint blank, huh? So about how far away was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away.\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know he was shot at point blank?\nvon Karma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me!?\nvon Karma:\nGunpowder burn.\nPhoenix:\n...Gunpowder burn?\nvon Karma:\nWhen something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\nGumshoe:\nGunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...)\nGumshoe:\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nStabbed... And what was he stabbed with?\nGumshoe:\nA fruit knife.\nJudge:\nI see. And whose knife was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it.\nJudge:\nHmm... All over it, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. This does not look good...)\nvon Karma:\nHa ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright?\nGumshoe:\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHow severe was the wound?\nGumshoe:\nIf it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand.\nPhoenix:\n(This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...)\nGumshoe:\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure he was stabbed first, then shot?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal.\nvon Karma:\nA fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... What a pain...)\nPhoenix:\n(Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...)\nAfter pressing first, second, third, and fifth statements:\nJudge:\nThat's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered.\nGumshoe:\nI brought the two murder weapons with me today.\nJudge:\nVery well. The court accepts them into evidence.\nPistol added to the Court Record.\nKnife added to the Court Record.\nvon Karma:\nThe date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time.\nJudge:\nAnd two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them, huh... (Changed from [And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...?] in the original release) Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case.\nvon Karma:\nNaturally!\nPhoenix:\n(This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...)\nvon Karma:\nYour Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there?\nJudge:\nThat is quite true... Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nJudge:\nEven in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead \"not guilty\"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose.\nvon Karma:\nSee, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes...\nJudge:\nWhat will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to \"justified self-defense\"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance.\nPhoenix:\n(This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!)\nPlead justified self-defense\nPhoenix:\n(If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to \"justified self-defense\"...\nvon Karma:\nHah.\nJudge:\nUnderstood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea.\nPhoenix:\n(...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?)\nMia:\n...You already hold the key... ...If you don't believe, you cannot win...\nPhoenix:\n(...! If we plead \"justified self-defense\", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor!\nJudge:\nY-Yes?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty!\nLeads to:\n\"...You.\"\nPlead not guilty\nPhoenix:\n(If we plead \"justified self-defense\"... we would basically be confessing to a murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'd be labeled a murderer... I can't let that happen!) Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHave you reached a conclusion, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense will not change its plea. We will accept nothing short of complete acquittal!\nLeads to:\n\"...You.\"\nvon Karma:\n...You. You have sealed your fate, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Detective!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!\nvon Karma:\nPresent the final portion of your testimony -- the final strike.\nGumshoe:\nUm... Y-Yes... sir...\nJudge:\nN-Now, see here! Proceedings are run by... Eek!\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nOh, yes, of course. Go ahead Detective and give your testimony...\nvon Karma:\nI think the court would like to hear about the other piece of incriminating evidence!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Incriminating Evidence --\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.\nThis is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.\nAs you can see, it's covered in blood.\nThe defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.\nJudge:\nSo this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this.\nGumshoe:\nThis piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir.\nJudge:\nI see... The court accepts this into evidence.\nMaya's Costume added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??)\nvon Karma:\nHah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer. Feel free to sulk off with your tail between your legs, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Please stop calling me by my full name. It's disturbing.)\nCross Examination\n-- Incriminating Evidence --\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you say so in your testimony earlier!?\nGumshoe:\nUh... You're kinda scary today, you know, pal?\nJudge:\nCome now, Mr. Wright... There is no need for that kind of attitude in my court...\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nA-Alright. Just, please stop glaring at me like that...\nGumshoe:\nThis is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMaya's... costume?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. She was wearing this when we arrested her.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... She's wearing her channeling costume today too... Is she not allowed to wear anything else...?)\nGumshoe:\nAs you can see, it's covered in blood.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis blood on the costume...\nGumshoe:\nLab results show that it is the victim's blood.\nJudge:\nHmm... So there is blood from the victim on the defendant's clothes.\nPhoenix:\n(Definitely not good...) (Changed from [Definitely not good... Urk.] in the original release) So, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence? (Changed from [Hmm, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nUm, well...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nIf you must change the topic, then the good detective here must testify again. But too bad. Not enough time. Let's move on. (Changed from [But too bad. Not enough time. Time to move on.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nAh, yes, Ms. von Karma is perfectly correct...\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... Now even the Judge is on her side! But if I bite off more than I can chew here... What should I do!?)\nPress further\nPhoenix:\n(Why is Ms. von Karma suddenly putting up resistance? There must be a reason as to why she suddenly threw out an objection like that... There must be something about this costume...! (Changed from [There must be a clue somewhere on this costume!] in the original release) I just have to look harder!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Ms. von Karma's logic is perfect. There is no way for you to poke a hole in it.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! Looks like my time is up. So, about the costume...)\nThere is nothing wrong.\nPhoenix:\n(If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this.\nJudge:\nGood. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nThere is one little thing...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. Actually, there is something very wrong with this piece of evidence.\nJudge:\nWh-What!?\nGumshoe:\nWhat are you talking about, pal!?\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nWh-Where is this problem you are talking about!?\nPhoenix:\n(I've come this far...

The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\nPresent bullet hole on left sleeve\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume.\"\nPresent blood splatter\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe problem is obviously the blood splatter here!\nJudge:\nB-But... We've determined that the blood splatter is from the victim. Where is the problem in that?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, where, pal?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I wonder about that too...\nJudge:\nThat last antic of yours just pushed me over the top, Mr. Wright. I hereby declare this cross-examination over...

The only thing wrong here is the defense's head.\nJudge:\nWell said. You certainly do take after your father!\nPhoenix:\n(I've just been made to look like a fool again... Alright... Focus, Phoenix!)\nLeads back to:\n\"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\"\nPhoenix:\nI ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume.\nJudge:\nThe sleeve? ...! There is a tiny hole here...\nGumshoe:\n..A... A hole...? But that wasn't in the report.\nJudge:\nHold on! What's this around the hole? I-It smells faintly of gunpowder!\nGumshoe:\nG-Gunpowder!? No one ever told me!\nJudge:\nA hole that smells of gunpowder...\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I've found the \"hole\" I was looking for!) Your Honor, the only logical conclusion you can make is that it must be a bullet hole!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! This is a very grave matter. It's best we correct the Court Record first before anything else.\nMaya's Costume updated in the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nSorry about that. I guess we messed up, sir.\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...! (I-Is she actually... smiling!? What else is she hiding!?)\nvon Karma:\nPull yourself together, Detective. That tiny \"hole\" doesn't change a thing. The strength of the evidence still holds. Continue with your testimony. That, just now, was a fluke. Nothing more.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nH-How can you say something like that!? This is a huge oversight!\nJudge:\nWhile I agree it is a mistake on the part of the police, what Prosecutor von Karma has said is true. The evidence still stands. If you do not find a more definitive problem with the evidence, then...\nPhoenix:\nNo way!!\nJudge:\nDetective Gumshoe, please continue with your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nLet it go\nPhoenix:\n(If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this.\nJudge:\nGood. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPress (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAlright. I'll give you that the blood spatter is from the victim, but... what is this hole in the sleeve?\nGumshoe:\nUm... Sorry, pal. We must've thought it was just a tear in the seam...\nPhoenix:\nMissing the hole is not what I'm asking you about. I'm talking about the hole itself! The smell of gunpowder  clearly gives away that... it is a bullet hole!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nAs if little things like that matter.\nPhoenix:\nBut they do.\nvon Karma:\nA \"bullet hole\" in the sleeve, blood splatter all over the costume... Neither of these things can change the fact the defendant killed the victim.\nPhoenix:\n(...Grr... I know there's something more to that costume.)\nvon Karma:\nCome now Detective. You're wasting precious time.\nGumshoe:\n... Yes, sir.\nGumshoe:\nThe defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHe wasn't \"fighting back\"? How do you know if he was or wasn't!?\nGumshoe:\nWe could find no evidence that the victim put up any sort of struggle, pal.\nJudge:\nHmm... So did the murderer have a fight with the victim, or not? Depending on this, the circumstances around this murder change drastically.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... We're in real trouble now... If only I had something to prove that the victim did fight back...)\nPresent Maya's Costume (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record)\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Dick Gumshoe!\"\nPhoenix:\n(That Von Karma! She thinks she can decide the verdict with this testimony alone! I have to somehow find a critical contradiction and then I'll have her!)\nPhoenix:\nDetective Dick Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes? Heh, having you call me by my full name is kind of a weird feeling...\nPhoenix:\nYou said that my client killed \"a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.\"\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I did.\nPhoenix:\nThen what, may I ask, is the bullet hole you police overlooked supposed to mean!?\nGumshoe:\nEh, um... What does it mean?\nPhoenix:\nI'll tell you what it means. It means that the victim had fired off a shot. Is this what it means to \"not fight back\"?\nGumshoe:\nA-Ah! You're right!\nJudge:\nIt seems you are correct! (Changed from [It would seem that way!] in the original release) If the victim had tried to shoot the defendant, then... it would change everything... (Changed from [If the victim tried to shoot the defendant, then... It would change everything...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! The wind seems to be shifting...)\nvon Karma:\nHah.\nPhoenix:\n(What is with that \"are you finished yet\" laugh?)\nvon Karma:\nAre you finished yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright?\nJudge:\nMs. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nIt seems... that Maya Fey was shot at by the victim. However, that is only grounds enough to support a \"justified self-defense\" plea.\nJudge:\nThat is correct.\nvon Karma:\nBut I'm sure you remember, Your Honor, what the defense clearly said. They rejected \"justified self-defense\" and pleaded \"not guilty.\"\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nGumshoe:\nNow that you...\nJudge:\nWhy, that's right!\nvon Karma:\nWhich means! The defense has yet to prove anything at all!\nPhoenix:\nNooooo!!\nJudge:\nW-Well... Yes, that's true...\nvon Karma:\nFurthermore... just the fact that there is a bullet hole in the costume... is not enough to substantiate even a plea of \"justified self-defense\".\nJudge:\nHuh? How so?\nGumshoe:\nAaah!\nvon Karma:\nDon't just stand there. Hurry up and tell the court what transpired that day. ...With the new information we acquired added in, of course.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? You mean... By myself...? You want me to put together the scenario all by myself? Aah!\nvon Karma:\n...\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Right away, sir!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What Transpired --\nGumshoe:\nDuring the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.\nOf course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.\nWhile the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.\nThe victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.\nThe defendant then picked up on the opening, took the victim's gun, and ended it...\nJudge:\nHmm... This scenario you have put together does make sense...\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir.\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(On the surface, it does seem to make sense... (Changed from [Just by listening, it does make sense...] in the original release) However, I won't give up that easily!)\nJudge:\nP-Please refrain from glaring at me like that... Now then, your cross-examination, please.\nCross Examination\n-- What Transpired --\nGumshoe:\nDuring the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThere is quite a difference in height between Dr. Grey and the defendant. Add in body strength, and it seems unlikely the defendant could have stabbed the victim!\nGumshoe:\nNow that you mention it... Yeah, I guess...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nYou think you can get away with such flimsy reasoning? Mr. Phoenix Wright! Maya Fey was in the middle of channeling, was she not?\nPhoenix:\n...?\nvon Karma:\nWhen channeling with the Kurain Channeling Technique, the medium physically changes. With the nurse's build, the defendant could have easily been a match for the doctor.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't believe it... She even studied up on the Kurain Channeling Technique!)\nvon Karma:\nLike I said before... I am perfect.\nJudge:\nUm... Uh... About what you were talking about... I didn't quite get it...\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nUm, n-never mind. Let's continue with the testimony...\nGumshoe:\nOf course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo he was stabbed, but the stab wound didn't kill him.\nGumshoe:\nBut if you think about the blood loss, it was pretty bad.\nPhoenix:\nHow bad would you say it was?\nGumshoe:\nActually, I went to give blood the other day. And afterward, I felt a little lightheaded and dizzy. ...I guess the damage was maybe... about 10 times the dizziness...? Ack!\nvon Karma:\n...\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry!\nGumshoe:\nWhile the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhere in the world did that pistol come from?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Dr. Grey had specifically bought it for that day.\nPhoenix:\nBut a handgun...?\nGumshoe:\nHe got it off the black market about 2 days before the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(Why did Dr. Grey bring a gun...? Was he taking precautions against something...?)\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're saying that the bullet hole in this costume was made then?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's what I'd think. The two of them were already fighting when a shot was fired.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... I'm really glad you weren't hurt...)\nvon Karma:\n...\nPresent Maya's Costume\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Missing the tiny hole on this costume...\"\nGumshoe:\nThe defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMaya has never fired a gun before in her life!\nGumshoe:\nThe victim had already taken off the safety. With the safety off, even an amateur like you can fire it by pulling the trigger.\nPhoenix:\n(Even me...? I wonder...?)\nvon Karma:\nNow do you understand? A Von Karma's logic is perfect.\nPhoenix:\n(His testimony certainly makes us look very bad, but there's gotta be a contradiction in there somewhere... And uncovering it is going to uncover the truth! I can feel it!)\nPhoenix:\nMissing the tiny hole on this costume... will be the prosecution's undoing.\nGumshoe:\nEh? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nThis little hole has actually created a huge hole in your testimony!\nJudge:\nE-Explain yourself, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nYou said the two of them were fighting when the victim fired his gun at point blank. If that were true, then where is the gunpowder burn on this costume!?\nGumshoe:\nG-Gunpowder... burn?\nPhoenix:\nThis is what you testified earlier: \"When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\"\nGumshoe:\nOH!\nPhoenix:\nBut there is not a single trace of gunpowder burn on this costume!!\nJudge:\nThat is a very good point. And... what exactly does this mean?\nPhoenix:\nIt means that when the shot was fired, they were standing apart from each other.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nI'm disappointed, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You think you can punch a hole in my logic with that? With wishy-washy thinking like that, anyone can explain anything away!\nPhoenix:\nThen I implore you to disprove my line of thinking.\nvon Karma:\nLet's see... In the middle of their fight, the victim pushed the defendant away. And it was then, when they were separated, that he fired! How was that?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAs if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that!\nvon Karma:\n...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself. And then while she was preparing to strike again, the doctor took his shot. There. That sound satisfy even you.\nJudge:\nHmm... That does make an awful lot of sense. What do you think, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(I must be careful. I can't afford to make a mistake here! Concentrate and think!)\nIt makes sense.\nPhoenix:\n(Ack, it's no good. I can't find a \"hole\" in her logic at all this time...) I admit it. Somehow, your reasoning makes logical sense.\nvon Karma:\nThat's it. That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Drat. It's 11:00 AM. I've already missed my morning tea. ...However. At least we were able to arrive at a conclusion.\nJudge:\nHmm... It does look that way.\nPhoenix:\n(...Oh boy... If I don't do something soon, it'll be curtains for Maya...)\nJudge:\nWell then, I think we can...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Please... Wait!\nJudge:\nWho was that? Mr. Wright? Please refrain from making unnecessary outbursts!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't care how, but I must find something to go on in Von Karma's explanation!)\nLeads to:\n\"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\"\nSomething doesn't make sense.\nLeads to:\n\"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\"\nPhoenix:\nThere is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\nGumshoe:\nFatal...?\nJudge:\nFlaw...!? Yeow!\nvon Karma:\nVery interesting. I would love to see where this \"flaw\" is! Show me something that contradicts my explanation!\nPhoenix:\n(There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere! \"She put some distance between them before rushing to make the final blow. And when she was about to strike, the doctor took his shot.\" There must be a piece of evidence that contradicts this line of thinking!)\nPresent Folding Screen\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this!\nGumshoe:\nWhy are you showing this to me, pal?\nPhoenix:\nProsecutor von Karma's explanation and this piece of evidence...\nGumshoe:\n...Do not contradict!\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nGumshoe:\nHaha, looks like you need to use your brain a little more, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Being lectured by Gumshoe, of all people, is so embarrassing...)\nGumshoe:\nCome on! Hurry up and get that thinking cap on!\nLeads back to:\n\"There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere!\"\nPhoenix:\nThis is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.\nJudge:\nWhat is that? A folding screen?\nPhoenix:\nI would like to point the court's attention to the \"hole\" in this folding screen.\nvon Karma:\nAaah!\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like you already know what I'm talking about.\nGumshoe:\nWho? Where? What?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Your explanation, please!\nPhoenix:\n(Are these two really that clueless...?) The bullet went through the defendant's sleeve first, then the folding screen. It passed through at a height of approximately 8 inches off the ground... Which means! When the shot was fired, Maya... I mean, the defendant, was not getting ready to strike, but was actually squatting low to the ground!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Th-This changes everything!\nPhoenix:\nPlease look at this diagram of the crime scene. The victim, Dr. Grey was here when he fired the shot. And the bullet hit this folding screen. It hit at this location, about 8 inches off the ground. At this time, the defendant was in this area.\nPresent area directly in front of bullet hole\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"She was standing here, near the folding screen!\"\nPresent area behind folding screen\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere!\nJudge:\nBehind the folding screen...?\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nvon Karma:\nThe victim and his attacker were fighting, were they not? Then what would the attacker be doing all the way back there!?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nvon Karma:\nBesides which, if the attacker was behind the folding screen, then how could the victim even know where to shoot? It's obviously impossible!\nPhoenix:\n... Yeah, I guess so...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Boy, did I just screw up royally... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)\nLeads back to:\n\"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSomewhere around here!\nJudge:\n...?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh. The judge's face is scrunched like he just smelled some serious bad breath...) Uhh... Um... That is, I mean...\nJudge:\nWait! I just realized I forgot to brush this morning... Excuse me while I freshen up.\nPhoenix:\nUh, sure...\nJudge:\nIn the meantime, I want you to think things through again, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, of course... Whoops... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)\nLeads back to:\n\"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\"\nPhoenix:\nShe was standing here, near the folding screen!\nvon Karma:\nW-Wait a second! We know the defendant was close to the ground based on the height of the bullet hole. But... How can you gauge the distance from that!? Isn't it possible that the defendant was standing much closer to the victim?\nPhoenix:\nThat's impossible.\nvon Karma:\nB-But why!?\nPhoenix:\nYou, of all people, should know the answer to that question, Ms. von Karma. If she were shot from somewhere closer, there would be gunpowder burns present. However! There is nothing of the sort around the bullet hole of this costume!\nvon Karma:\nAaaaaah! C-Curse you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You...!\nJudge:\nHmm... I believe it has now been proven that the defendant was standing a ways from the victim when she was shot at. But do you think this has changed the defendant's situation...?\nIt doesn't change anything.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, even with that explanation, it feels like nothing has changed... But I can't give up just yet!)\nLeads to:\n\"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\"\nIt changes everything.\nLeads to:\n\"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\"\nPhoenix:\nHonestly, Your Honor! This changes everything! The prosecution has claimed that the defendant was aiming to kill by stabbing. If that were true, delivering the final strike with the knife would be ideal. However! Where and what was the defendant doing at the time...?\nGumshoe:\n...Squatting all the way by the folding screen...?\nPhoenix:\nExactly. If Maya Fey was the real murderer, why would she be by the folding screen instead of preparing to strike?\nvon Karma:\nNnngh...\nJudge:\nUpon further consideration, it does make very little sense.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I figured there had to be a reason.\nPhoenix:\nFiguring things out and proving the logic behind everything is YOUR job!\nGumshoe:\nOof...\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! With this, the rest of the trial should be in the b--)\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(...blast radius of disaster.)\nvon Karma:\nYou are such a smart man, Mr. Phoenix Wright. To think that you've been able to take a completely hopeless case to this point... Now I know why Papa had a tough time with you. Mmm, you amuse me...\nPhoenix:\n(Uuugh. Of all the things to inherit, why did it have to be that smarmy smile!?)\nvon Karma:\nDetective. How dare you damage my perfect logic!?\nGumshoe:\nH-Huh!?... How is it all my fault??\nvon Karma:\nYou can start repairing your standing by first removing that three-strand \"goatee\". Oh, and rest assured your punishment will come later.\nGumshoe:\n...P-Punishment...\nvon Karma:\nWell then, Your Honor, I think I've had all I can take of this detective's face. I think it's time to call in the next witness.\nPhoenix:\n(Next witness...? That's gotta be Lotta!)\nJudge:\nVery well. The court will take a 5 minute recess. After we reconvene, we will hear from the next witness.\nTo be continued.\nJune 21, 11:37 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nPhoenix:\nPhew, that was a close one.\nMaya:\nI know you were giving it your all to defend me. But I could feel the death penalty hanging in the air...\nPhoenix:\nI felt like I was pretty close to dying myself...\nPearl:\nBut you were wonderful out there. You listened carefully, made theories, and tricked everyone into believing you.\nPhoenix:\nTh-Thanks. Wait... Tricked??\nPearl:\nThat must be the \"lawyer's\" secret technique, right?\nMaya:\nBy the way... Is the next witness who I think it is...?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I'm pretty sure it's Lotta Hart.\nMaya:\nOh... Guess there's no escaping her, huh? (Changed from [Oh... Another jam, like always...] in the original release) Remember, Nick! You promised you'd save me! If you lose, me and my sis's ghosts will come after you and haunt you! (Changed from [If you lose, my ghost will come after you with my sis', and we'll haunt you!] in the original release)\nPearl:\nYour sister...? Um, are you talking about Mystic Mia?\nMaya:\nYeah. Do you remember her, Pearly? My sister was a super good lawyer! She was also Nick's teacher.\nPearl:\n...Oh, I didn't know that...\nJune 21, 11:43 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Now, the first order of... Oww!\nvon Karma:\nI don't want to hear it, old man. After I call my witness, sit there quietly and watch like a good little boy.\nJudge:\nY-Yes, sir.\nvon Karma:\nBring in the photographer who witnessed the channeling!\nvon Karma:\nWitness. Your name and occupation, if you please.\nLotta:\nHey, Phoenix! How ya doin'?\nPhoenix:\nJust fine...\nLotta:\nSorry 'bout this. Didn't exactly have a choice, ya know...? Yeowza!\nvon Karma:\nName and occupation.\nLotta:\nI-I declare! What in tarnation!? Hey, Judge! This here is violence against my fair self!\nJudge:\nThat's fine.\nLotta:\n\"That's fine!?\" That ain't fine!! That's a whip! Eaaah!\nvon Karma:\nThere's no need for foolish outcries from foolishly foolish fools. Just hurry up and testify about what happened on the day of the murder.\nLotta:\nI haven't even gotten to say my name and job yet...\nvon Karma:\n...\nLotta:\nThe name's Lotta Hart, paranormal photographer, and I'm here to testify!\nJudge:\nNow, now, let's all be one big happy family... OK...?\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witness's Account --\nLotta:\nOnly the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber.\nWe were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot!\nMr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room.\nInside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around.\nI swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room.\nJudge:\nAnd did you take a picture of the scene right after the murder took place?\nLotta:\nReckon course!\nPhoenix:\nEh? ...Excuse me?\nLotta:\nReckon course! It's short for \"Ya reckon!? Of course I did!\" Aah!\nvon Karma:\nDoes it look like I care? Just hurry up and show your picture to the court.\nPhoenix:\n(The moment of truth. What will be in that picture?)\nLotta:\nUmm, let's see here... This here's the picture!\nJudge:\nHmm... It would certainly seem that only the defendant and the victim were in that room.\nLotta's Photo added to the Court Record.\nvon Karma:\nAre you ready, Mr. Phoenix Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(I will clear all doubt about Maya through this cross-examination... Just watch me!)\nCross Examination\n-- Witness's Account --\nLotta:\nOnly the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWas it really only those two that went in!?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nWhat are you blabbering about!? You were there too, were you not!?\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nvon Karma:\nWhy don't you answer that yourself? Was it really just the two of them?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes. Dr. Grey and Maya were the only two who went into the room...\nJudge:\nH-Hold on! We can't have the defense testifying against its own client!\nLotta:\nAnyway, folks, only the two of 'em went into the Channelin' Chamber, ya hear?\nvon Karma:\nBut you knew that from the very beginning, didn't you? ...Witness, continue.\nLotta:\nWe were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWas it really a gunshot!?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nAre you insane!? You must have heard it as well!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nvon Karma:\nWhy don't you testify for the court, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Was it really a gunshot?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes. I think it was something that sounded like a gunshot...\nJudge:\nAnd why are we here listening to the defense testify!?\nPhoenix:\n(...And the world becomes just a little crueler...)\nLotta:\nI heard a gunshot a long time ago, so I know. And I tell ya that was a gunshot I heard. Now, this -- this is where the story heats up!\nLotta:\nMr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, let me get this straight! This \"Mr. Lawyer there\" broke the door down!?\nvon Karma:\nHonestly, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Why don't you tell us what happened, then?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Yes, Ms. von Karma... I broke the door down. Sorry. (Why does this feel like an inquisition?)\nLotta:\nNo need for apologizin'! That was great! You're a real man!\nJudge:\nOh, really? That's something I would've liked to see.\nPhoenix:\n(The judge is smiling rather openly. I'll take that as a good sign...)\nvon Karma:\nAnd? What did you see once you broke in?\nLotta:\nInside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was the defendant, Maya Fey!?\nLotta:\nSure, I'm sure!\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta seems awful confident in her testimony...)\nPress harder\nPhoenix:\nLotta! Please, think back to that day one more time.\nLotta:\nWh-Whatcha getting' at?\nPhoenix:\nRemember what you said when we broke into the room...?\n???:\n...I was... murdered...\n*klik*\nPhoenix:\nLotta! At a time like this!?\nLotta:\nTimes like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!?\nPhoenix:\nWhen you saw the murderer at that time, you couldn't even tell if it was Maya Fey or not! Am I correct!?\nLotta:\nAh, um, well, ya see...\nJudge:\nOrder! Ms. Hart! You are here to present accurate testimony!\nLotta:\nYeah, ah, s-sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Good. This shifts things back to my side...)\nvon Karma:\nFor a defense lawyer, your defense is terribly lacking, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\n!\nvon Karma:\nWitness. Think back to when those two entered the Channeling Chamber.\nLotta:\nWhen they entered...?\nvon Karma:\nOne of those people that entered the chamber was Maya Fey, correct?\nLotta:\nYeah, that's right!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... It was Maya that went in.)\nJudge:\nHmm... It looks like we've come to a collective conclusion. The person in this picture is most certainly Maya Fey.\nvon Karma:\nExactly.\nPhoenix:\n(Rats! And I'm trapped like one... Again!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nLeave her be\nPhoenix:\n(Even I can see that any normal person would know who that was. It's no good. I shouldn't push my luck on this...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nLotta:\nI swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain of that!?\nLotta:\nSure am! But that old witch chased us out of the room, so...\nPhoenix:\n(\"Old witch\"? Does she mean Morgan Fey?)\nLotta:\nBut there was no one else in there, and you know it!\nPhoenix:\n(The Channeling Chamber was very dark, almost pitch black... Was there really no one else in there? What about...?)\nbehind the folding screen?\nPhoenix:\nWhat about... behind the folding screen? Did you check back there?\nLotta:\nReckgiven!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What in the...?\nLotta:\nReckgiven! Ya know! \"Ya reckon!? That's a given!\" I took me a good look around the room once! There ain't no way anyone was hangin' out behind that foldin' screen!\nJudge:\nHmm... If I may have a word with you, Ms. Hart...\nLotta:\nWh-What? Ya got a problem!?\nJudge:\nReckgiven!... I mean, I am having a little difficulty in understanding you. If you would stop saying such things as \"Reckongiven\" and so forth... Aah!\nvon Karma:\nNow then, Mr. Phoenix Wright, do you see a problem with the testimony or don't you?\nLeads back to cross-examination\nbehind the door?\nPhoenix:\nWhat about... behind the door? Did you check there?\nLotta:\nWhat do I look like to you? I wasn't born yesterday, ya know! First off, the one that bust that door open was you! With the way ya slammed that door, anyone standin' behind it woulda had more face and less nose, free of charge!\nvon Karma:\nIn any case, there was no one standing behind the door.\nPhoenix:\n(She actually had the police investigate that too!?)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nunder the flooring?\nPhoenix:\nWhat about... under the flooring? Did you check there?\nLotta:\nI ain't no ignoramus to make it out here!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?... Wh-What are you talking about?\nLotta:\nDon't \"what are ya talkin' about\" me! Under the floorin'? C'mon!, even a bug wouldn't crawl under that!\nvon Karma:\nSorry to disappoint, but there was no secret passageway under the flooring.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh... Yeah, that was a bit far-fetched, huh...?)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! Her story adds up... What's worse, I was there at the scene of the crime with her... (Changed from [What's worse is that I was there at the scene of the crime at that time too,] in the original release) and her story is exactly how I would have told it, too...

Just as I thought, there is nothing wrong with her testimony! I was with her, so I know she's telling the truth...)\nJudge:\nEnough. It seems that there are no issues with Ms. Hart's testimony.\nvon Karma:\nAt the time of the crime, only two people were in the Channeling Chamber: the victim, Dr. Turner Grey, and the defendant, Maya Fey.\nJudge:\nHmm... The face of the defendant can not be verified in this picture. However, if we think about the circumstances, it would have to be the defendant.\nPhoenix:\n(What am I going to do!? If I just let this go...)\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Mr. Wright? You look as if you have something to say...\nPhoenix:\n(If I make one wrong move, I'm going to have the judge against me... Is there anything I can present that would prove it's not Maya in that photo?)\nPresent evidence\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nIt is possible that the person in this photo is not the defendant!\nJudge:\nWh-Wh-What!? Do you know what you are proposing!?\nLotta:\nY-Y-Yeah! That's just plain fool's talk!\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks guys. Your show of support was just great...)\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\n...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof. Prove to this court that the person in this photo is not Maya Fey!\nPresent anything\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere is your proof!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\nIs there a problem?\nvon Karma:\nOh, no. I thought I would work on my inflections. Just wondering what an \"Objection!\" with a twist of \"You're wrong!\" sounds like.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I'm sorry, but I don't follow your logic.\nPhoenix:\n(Shoot. I guess I wasn't showing enough confidence...)\nPresent another piece\nLeads back to:\n\"...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof.\"\nGive up\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright?\"\nCan't present anything yet\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright?\"\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nNothing, Your Honor...\nvon Karma:\nThat's very smart of you, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You really should give up trying to prove this is not Maya Fey.\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't say anything about giving up! I just don't have the right piece of evidence to prove my argument...)\nJudge:\nThat's enough!\nPhoenix:\n(I-Is this it...? Is this all I could do...?)\nJudge:\nI think it is quite obvious to this court that a verdict of not guilty is not possible.\nvon Karma:\nI told you. Totally, 100% impossible.\nJudge:\nMs. von Karma, do you have any further questions for this witness?\nvon Karma:\nHaving established the defendant's guilt, further questioning won't be needed.\nJudge:\nWhat about the defense? No further questions, I presume?\nPhoenix:\n(I... I couldn't protect Maya...) The defense... The defense...\n...Phoenix... ...Phoenix, you can't make that kind of face... ...A lawyer is someone who smiles... no matter how bad it gets!...\nPhoenix:\nM-Mia!\nMia:\nI guess I made it just in time, wouldn't you say?\nPhoenix:\nY-You... But... P-Pearls!\nMia:\nHer clothes ARE a bit small... Anyway, what are you waiting for, Phoenix!? Let's go!\nPhoenix:\nB-But how!? She's already taken away every advantage!\nMia:\nThe advantage is still in your hand! Think carefully, one more time, about what you saw in the Channeling Chamber. Do you remember what you told me yesterday?\nPhoenix:\nD-Dr. Grey!!\n*klik*\n???:\n...I was... murdered...\nPhoenix:\nW-What!?\n*klik*\nPhoenix:\nLotta! At a time like this!?\nLotta:\nTimes like this are perfect for snapping up shots!\nMia:\nYou see... There is one final piece to this puzzle. (Changed from [You see... There is one final piece of the puzzle.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nMia...?\nMia:\nQuestion Lotta one more time, Phoenix. I don't know if she's doing it unconsciously or on purpose, but... (Changed from [I don't know if she's doing it subconsciously or on purpose, but...] in the original release) she's not testifying truthfully.\nJudge:\nNow then, this court would like to end the cross-examination period.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nPlease wait, Your Honor! The defense would like to request that the witness testify one more time.\nJudge:\nOverruled. I'm afraid you're too late, Mr. Wright. The cross-examination has already ended. Furthermore, any unrelated ques- Aah!\nvon Karma:\nIt's fine. I'll allow another testimony. A Von Karma's case is perfect. Absolutely flawless. And what better time than this for you to see that.\nJudge:\nB-But... I mean... I have some place I must go after this... Mmph! A-Al-Alright! I'll allow it! Ms. Hart! Hurry and give us another testimony!\nLotta:\nWell... heck... What am I supposed to talk about?\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell us once more, what happened when you burst into the Channeling Chamber.\nLotta:\nOK! You got it!\nMia:\nSee, you got through to the judge somehow, right?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, actually it was Von Karma's whip that got through to him...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witness's Account, Pt. 2 --\nLotta:\nWhen we broke into that room, all I could focus on was Maya.\nI was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it.\nI'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff.\nBut I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot!\nJudge:\nNothing sounds different from before...\nPhoenix:\n(Some parts of her testimony were very vague. I should press her on those sections!)\nvon Karma:\nStruggle all you like as you taste the bitterness of your defeat. Well, amuse me with your useless questions, Mr. Phoenix Wright. I'm waiting...\nCross Examination\n-- Witness' Account, Pt.2 --\nLotta:\nWhen we broke into that room, all I could focus on was Maya.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, what did she look like?\nLotta:\nYa know, she looked almost like a different person.\nJudge:\nA... A different person?\nvon Karma:\nShe may have seemed like a different person, however, she was still Maya Fey. We have already made that point abundantly clear!\nJudge:\nYes, that is true... Well, then, Ms. Hart. Did you happen to see anything else?\nLotta:\nI was... uh, kinda scared of the dead body, so I didn't take a good look at it.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThen perhaps that body was not Dr. Grey's at all!\nLotta:\nEh!? W-Well... I reckon that's possible...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nIf the body inside that room was not that of Dr. Grey, then whose body was it, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, what if it was that of Maya Fey after the channeling? Or maybe -- Oww!\nvon Karma:\nFoolish fool spouting foolish foolishness, just as I expect of a foolish fool such as you. If that were the case, then that would mean that Maya Fey is, in fact, dead. And that would make the defendant's chair quite a lonely place, wouldn't it!?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... Sorry, Maya...)\nLotta:\nAre y'all done here? Can I continue?\nLotta:\nI'm really bad when it comes to blood and ghosts and stuff.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd even knowing that, you still persist in being a paranormal photographer?\nLotta:\nThat's why I'm getting out of this here business. This gal's gonna get the dirt on the stars and be a tabloid photographer from now on!\nPhoenix:\n(She goes through jobs faster than a baby through diapers.) Wah!\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright. Would it kill you to stay on topic for a change?\nJudge:\nWell? Would it, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Nice, tag-teamed in stereo. Guess I should be grateful it's not in 5.1...)\nLotta:\nBut I still managed to point my camera at Maya and take a shot!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Two, right?\"\nMia:\nThere must be something we can use in her testimony just now. We must find it! At all costs...\nPhoenix:\nTwo, right?\nLotta:\nT-Two what?\nPhoenix:\nTwo shots. You took two shots.\nJudge:\nBut... Only one has been submitted as evidence!\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart! Where is the other picture you have been withholding!?\nLotta:\nNo, no, no! You've got it all wrong! It's not me! I-I didn't mean anything bad! I know I can be a little mean, but I ain't evil!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, at least she knows herself...)\nJudge:\nThen why have you not shown this \"other picture\" to this court yet?\nLotta:\nWell, ain't it obvious!? That prosecutor woman told me to shut my trap about it!\nPhoenix:\nW-What!? V... Von Karma!!\nJudge:\nM-M-Ms. von Karma! Y-Y-You... You're hiding critical evidence...!\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Unforgivable, von Karma. Suppressing evidence like this... You're as bad as your father!)\nConfront Franziska\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! The defense asks that Prosecutor von Karma be held in contempt of court!\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, yes... Mngh!\nvon Karma:\nMe? In contempt of court!? You can't be serious.\nPhoenix:\nBut... But you hid evidence from the court... On purpose! That's... That's... That's not fair!\nMia:\nP-Phoenix!! Are you a lawyer or a school child?\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! I was so angry I lost my composure...)\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?\"\nLeave it to the Judge\nPhoenix:\n(...Argh! I'm so mad that even my throat's clenching up! I'd better let the Judge handle this...)\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?\"\nJudge:\nMs. von Karma. Would you care to explain yourself to this court?\nvon Karma:\nI thought this picture was not important, and thus, felt no need to submit it. That's all.\nPhoenix:\nH-How could you think...!?\nvon Karma:\nThe pictures were more or less the same, so why bother with the second? I mean, it's just so much more trouble than it's worth for me to submit this as evidence.\nPhoenix:\n\"M-More trouble that [sic] it's worth!?\" How... How can you say that!?\nvon Karma:\nIf you want to see it that badly, I'll submit it.\nLotta's Photo 2 added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\n... Wh-What is...? What is this picture!?\nvon Karma:\nIt's obviously the second picture the witness took that day at the scene of the crime. Well, it's a little off-center, but that's what you get with a nervous amateur.\nJudge:\nUm... I think the important point here is the person in this picture! (Changed from [Well, I think the important point here is the person in this picture!] in the original release) This is most definitely NOT Maya Fey! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\n(This might be the break I was looking for... Now, should I or should I not insist that the person in this picture is not Maya?)\nDrop the issue\nPhoenix:\n... (It's no good. We've been through this so many times...)\nJudge:\nThis is not like you, Mr. Wright! Why are you not objecting!? The person in this photo is clearly not the defendant and yet...\nvon Karma:\nHa ha ha... There is no way he can raise an objection and hope to live.\nJudge:\nExplain yourself!\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture.\"\nInsist it's not Maya\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! As you can plainly see, the person in the picture is not Maya Fey!\nJudge:\nY-Yes, I see that... It's not just her face! Her whole body has taken on a different appearance!\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion that can be drawn, then. That somehow, this other person snuck in and traded places with the defendant!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! Well, yes, I believe you are correct, Mr. Wright! The person who was inside the Channeling Chamber was not Maya Fey!\nPhoenix:\nMia! We did it!\nMia:\n...You're too soft.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nYou're softer than Aunt Morgan's strawberry desserts, Phoenix. Take a look at Prosecutor von Karma's face.\nPhoenix:\n(S-She's... smiling...!?)\nvon Karma:\nI think you had better continue to worry, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nJudge:\nM-Ms. von Karma! What do you mean by that?\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture.\"\nvon Karma:\nYour Honor. I would like for you to take a look at this picture. This was taken yesterday at the Detention Center's Visitor's Room. This is Mr. Phoenix Wright and the defendant, Maya Fey during his visit...\nJudge:\nMaya Fey? But... Isn't this a totally different person!?\nvon Karma:\nShe looks this way because she is obviously in the middle of channeling a spirit!\nJudge:\nIt's unbelievable... That she can...\nvon Karma:\nYet, it is the truth. (Changed from [However, it is true.] in the original release) When Maya Fey is in that state, she physically changes into the person she's calling!\nJudge:\n...\nMia:\nMs. von Karma. A word, if I may. (Changed from [I wonder if she knows what she's doing...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(M-Mia!?) (Question mark not present in the original release)\nMia:\nTaking pictures of someone during a private visit is illegal. Surely, you must know that that picture can't be submitted as evidence. (Changed from [That picture can't be submitted as evidence.] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\n... Obviously, I know this picture is illegal. (Changed from [Obviously, this picture is illegal.] in the original release) But I never intended to submit it as evidence in the first place!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What is she...?)\nvon Karma:\nFrom the moment I showed this picture to the court, this case became all mine. After all, this image has now been forever burned into the judge's mind.\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(I... I don't have even a single witty line...)\nMia:\nIt looks like we've been had.\nJudge:\nI don't claim to understand this, and I still cannot believe it... Are you saying that this person... this person is the defendant, Maya Fey!?\nPhoenix:\n(If I give up here, the trial will end! But... If I slip up and say something wrong, it will cost me... Is there any way I can prove that the person in this picture is not Maya!?)\nI can't prove it.\nPhoenix:\n(It's no good! My argument doesn't hold any water!)\nJudge:\nI see the defense is staying silent on this one.\nPhoenix:\n...Yes... Your Honor...\nvon Karma:\nAnd to think. I even gave you this chance to prove your point for free. But you couldn't even point yourself out in a line-up!\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes... Well, then. I believe we have reached a conclusion.\nMia:\nPhoenix!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nYou can't give up! Please, for me? Take a look at the Court Record again and try to find some way out of this jam!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Some way...\nMia:\nThe judge is about to close the trial. You can't let that happen!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... It's come down to this!) Your Honor! Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now.\nJudge:\nWhat is it, now, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nPlease! Please let me explain!\nLeads to:\n\"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\"\nI can prove it.\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor!\nJudge:\nOh! The fire has returned to your eyes, I see.\nPhoenix:\nThis picture... Within this picture lies a critical contradiction to all the testimony up until now.\nJudge:\nA contradiction!?\nLeads to:\n\"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\"\nvon Karma:\nSo, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep. Why don't you point out exactly what is so strange in this picture for the court?\nPresent bottom of cuff on left sleeve\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Please direct your attention here!\"\nPresent face\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nPlease direct your attention here!\nJudge:\n...T-To her... face?\nPhoenix:\nWith your own two eyes, you can clearly see that this face does not belong to Maya Fey!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nFool! Do you even know what you're talking about anymore!?\nPhoenix:\nAAAH! THAT HURT!\nvon Karma:\nDidn't we just finish discussing that her appearance changes during channeling!?\nLotta:\nI know you ain't no dummy, so don't think yer foolin' no one here!\nJudge:\nThere is a limit to everything, Mr. Wright. And that includes patience!\nMia:\nPhoenix! You have to think before you speak! You can't just blurt out any old thing.\nMaya:\n...Nick! You're supposed to be helping me!\nPhoenix:\n(*cringe* Even Maya's mad at me now... I have to focus!)\nLeads back to:\n\"So, you think you've spotted a problem with this picture? Then earn your keep.\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe contradiction lies... Here!\nJudge:\n...You don't sound very sure of yourself, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, but can you really tell me how much confidence I have in this!?\nvon Karma:\nHmph! What is with that attitude!?\nPhoenix:\nAAAH! THAT HURT!\nvon Karma:\nDidn't we just finish discussing that her appearance changes during channeling!?\nLotta:\nI know you ain't no dummy, so don't think yer foolin' no one here!\nJudge:\nThere is a limit to everything, Mr. Wright.

Then earn your keep.\"\nPhoenix:\nPlease direct your attention here!\nJudge:\n...T-To the sleeve? But... But there isn't anything odd about it...\nPhoenix:\nAnd that is exactly what is so odd. Something that should be there is suddenly missing.\nvon Karma:\n\"Should be there\"...? Aaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nThere was a bullet hole in the sleeve of the defendant's costume! If that's the case, then it should be in this picture as well!\nJudge:\nMs. von Karma!! Y-You... You intended to hide this valuable piece of evidence!?\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nYou will most certainly be assigned a penalty for this!\nPhoenix:\n(Alright. This should do some major damage to her argument...)\nMia:\nDon't celebrate yet.\nPhoenix:\nYou like to bring down the mood, don't you?\nMia:\nTake a look at Ms. von Karma's face.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! She's got that condescending grin plastered all over her face again.)\nvon Karma:\n...Tsk, tsk, jumping the gun again, I see. Your Honor! I would like to extend an apology on behalf of those incompetent fools.\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean? And what \"incompetent fools\"...?\nvon Karma:\nIf those fools down at the precinct hadn't missed the bullet hole, I would have gotten a report about it. As I didn't, I could not have known that this picture was of any value to this case.\nJudge:\nHmm, I see...\nPhoenix:\n(She's lying through her teeth! I know it! That woman knew about everything! The bullet hole, the picture -- everything!)\nMia:\nBut you can't prove that. Franziska von Karma's idea of a \"perfect case\" is quite fascinating, don't you think?\nvon Karma:\nYour Honor. You need not worry. If you must assign a penalty, I'll personally make sure that detective gets what's coming. I'm sure there will be a great gnashing of teeth at the next salary discussion.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)\nJudge:\nIn any case, this is a very big problem! When the defendant was taken into custody, her costume had a bullet hole in its sleeve. However, from this photo, it would appear that right after the shooting, there was none!\nvon Karma:\n...\nMia:\nThe judge is confused by this strange twist of events. This is your chance, Phoenix! Load all you've got into this one shot, alright!?\nPhoenix:\nGot it! (Watch this, Maya!) Your Honor! There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!\nThis picture is a fake.\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that the defendant's costume has a bullet hole in its sleeve is a fact! Which can only mean one thing. That this picture is a fake!\nJudge:\nWh-What!?\nLotta:\nHey! You callin' me a forger now!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, no, not you exactly... Well, not per se...\nLotta:\nOh no ya don't! Don't you be scratchin' yer head with that goofy smile like some monkey! Now, why do ya think I'd do somethin' that nasty!? C'mon now!\nMia:\nPhoenix! Use your brain for a change!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry, Chief...\nLeads back to:\n\"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!\"\nThe bullet hole was made later.\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one explanation for why there is no hole in the sleeve in the picture! The hole was created much later, after the murder took place!\nJudge:\nA-After the murder!?\nLotta:\nHey! Those two gunshots we heard were before we broke in, or did ya forget!?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I-Is that how it went?\nvon Karma:\nThe pistol fired only two shots. No more, no less.\nJudge:\nYou do know how to count, right?\nMia:\nPhoenix! What are you doing!? Try it one more time!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Chief...\nLeads back to:\n\"There is only one logical explanation for the contradiction!\"\nThe shooter is someone else.\nLeads to:\n\"The defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it.\"\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant's sleeve had a bullet hole in it. However, this person clearly does not. There can be only one explanation. The person who shot Dr. Grey was not the defendant, but a different person altogether!\nvon Karma:\nWha-Whaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! If order is not restored, I will suspend this trial! Oww!\nPhoenix:\nAah!\nLotta:\nWhy me!?\nvon Karma:\nThe defense's... The defense's argument is a complete mess!\nPhoenix:\nA complete mess? I fail to see how! Please, enlighten us.\nvon Karma:\nHey, witness!\nLotta:\nAah! What the heck!? Is that any way to ask a gal a favor!?\nvon Karma:\nBe quiet you! You were the one who said it was only the two of them when you entered the room!\nLotta:\nWell, ya know...\nvon Karma:\nIf you were lying, I swear that my whip will be the last thing you see!\nLotta:\nL-Look, sis... You're lookin' mighty scary so why don't we say you... Waah! I-I swear! I wasn't lyin' or nothin'! There wasn't anyone else in there! Honest!\nvon Karma:\nYou see! Now riddle me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where did the defendant vanish to!? And where did this other woman appear from!?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... (Why is it lately, all I want to do is cry...?)\nJudge:\nWell, if the person in this picture is not the defendant, then this poses 2 very big questions. First, where did the defendant vanish to, and second, where did this person come from?\nvon Karma:\nThat's right! Now hurry up and answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nMia:\nCome on! You can't fall apart here, Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe that even Mia's calling me by my full name... But... I mean... How am I supposed to prove something like this!?)\nvon Karma:\nHad enough yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Or do you think you have enough in you to turn things around even now!?\nPhoenix:\n(To \"turn things around\"... That's right. Mia would always turn things around and change her perspective!)\nMia:\nPhoenix...?\nPhoenix:\n(So, where did this intruder appear from, and where did Maya disappear to? I need to look at this situation from a different angle! Let's see... What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room... And what if Maya had left that room somehow... If I could prove that either one of those conditions were true...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Let's hear what you've come up with.\nPhoenix:\nI think what happened before we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber is...\na 3rd person had entered it.\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I would like to present some evidence! I have proof that there was someone else in the room before the murder took place!\nPresent anything\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nPlease take a good look at this!\nJudge:\n...Okay...\nvon Karma:\nI've already seen it.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nJudge:\nAnd? What is the purpose of this item?\nPhoenix:\nDon't you see, Your Honor?\nvon Karma:\nI don't think you actually see what you are doing.\nPhoenix:\n... *sigh*\nJudge:\nI think it is the court that should be sighing at you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch, that stung...)\nPresent another piece\nLeads back to:\n\"Your Honor! I would like to present some evidence!\"\nThink it over again\nPhoenix:\n(I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong... I have to start over and try to think about things in a different manner...)\nLeads back to:\n\"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\"\nMaya had left the room.\nPhoenix:\nMaya had left the Channeling Chamber at some point! And the defense can prove this!\nvon Karma:\nOh, how a foolish fool makes a foolish face while dreaming foolishly foolish dreams. Maya Fey was being looked after by her aunt, Morgan Fey. The chances of her leaving the crime scene is lower than that detective's salary!\nJudge:\nAnyway, let's see some evidence. Prove that from the murder until the time of arrest, the defendant had left the room.\nPresent Black Key\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Hart. Do you remember this key?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nThe evidence you're looking for is... this?\nJudge:\n...\nLotta:\nWhy the heck is there a \"?\" at the end there for!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, actually, I'm not really sure about this evidence, you know...?\nJudge:\nNext time, only present evidence you actually do have faith in.\nPhoenix:\n(Oww... That burned...)\nPresent another piece\nLeads back to:\n\"Anyway, let's see some evidence.\"\nThink it over again\nPhoenix:\n(I think the way I'm going about this is all wrong...

And the reason is quite simple. Because there is no explanation. That's why!\nJudge:\nHmm... As I thought. Another big waste of this court's time.\nMia:\nPhoenix! You can't just give up like that!\nPhoenix:\nBut Mia!\nMia:\nRethink things one more time! There has to be an explanation!\nvon Karma:\nI'm already \"perfect\". So of course, my conclusions are also \"perfect\".\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... Alright, Wright. Calm down and let's try this one more time!)\nLeads back to:\n\"What if before we broke in, the third person was already in the room...\"\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart. Do you remember this key?\nLotta:\nUm... Well, I've seen it... Hey! That's the Channeling Chamber key, right? Before the channeling started, Maya locked the door from the inside with that...\nvon Karma:\nThe defendant herself locked the door...?\nLotta:\nYeah! That's why we all couldn't get the door open. That key's the only one of its kind, after all.\nJudge:\nOh... One of a kind, you say?\nvon Karma:\n...! Wait... Mr. Phoenix Wright...\nPhoenix:\nYes? (It looks like she's catching on...)\nvon Karma:\nI'm afraid to ask, but... Why is that key currently in your possession?\nJudge:\nHuh? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nIf Maya Fey locked herself in, then the key should have been with her.\nJudge:\nYes, agreed.\nPhoenix:\nHowever, she did not have the key at the time of her arrest!\nLotta:\nAah! Well, ain't that a kick! So how come you're holdin' it!?\nPhoenix:\nI got this as a present from a certain little girl. And that little girl was nowhere near the crime scene at the time!\nvon Karma:\nTh-Th-That's preposterous!\nPhoenix:\nThis means that Maya Fey must have left the room! If she had not, then I would not be holding this key you see before you!\nvon Karma:\nN-Nooooooo!\nJudge:\nIt seems we have come to an impasse. This picture has clearly captured the face of the murderer. However, is this person the defendant or not? The defense is arguing that this person is not the defendant. Furthermore, as proof, this key has been submitted as evidence. Ms. von Karma.\nvon Karma:\nHow. Can. This. Be!?\nJudge:\nAt this point in time, a verdict on the defendant's guilt is not possible. (Changed from [At this point in time, a verdict on the defendant is not possible.] in the original release)\nvon Karma:\nMy perfect case! How is there a flaw in my perfect case! Don't think you've won yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright! I am a prodigy! I have never lost a case! And I don't intend to lose here in this courtroom to a fool like you! I don't care what I have to do... I will get my guilty verdict!\nJudge:\nThat's enough! If you would like to continue, do so in the lobby. Court will reconvene tomorrow at 10 AM. That is all.

It's not like anyone else in there could have done that.)\nMaya:\nHmm, Nick... I know you're trying really hard and all, but... I really don't remember ever leaving that room.\nPearl:\nAnd I don't think that a third person... could have gone into that room.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah... Well, at least we have until tomorrow to figure things out. Like, what happened in that room, for instance.\nMaya:\nYeah. I'm counting on you!\nPearl:\nAh... I envy the two of you...\nMaya:\nOh, by the way, Nick. Do you think you could take Pearly back home for me?\nPhoenix:\nSure. Alright, Pearls. You ready to go buy some tickets?\nPearl:\nHuh? A tik-ket?\nPhoenix:\n(Poor thing... So sheltered.)\nTo be continued.\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?\nJudge:\nUh... I'm not sure I follow you.\nPhoenix:\nIt clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...\nJudge:\nYou don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection denied.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!\nJudge:\n...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really?\nJudge:\nObjection denied. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHow exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?\nPhoenix:\nThey aren't, are they...\nJudge:\nNot at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maya Fey...\nGuilty\nJudge:\nThe accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!\nReunion, and Turnabout\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nJune 21, 3:24 PMKurain Village\nPearl:\nThank you very much for bringing me home, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYou're welcome. I had to come and look into a few things here today anyway.\nPearl:\nUm... I thought about this a little.\nPhoenix:\n?\nPearl:\nIf Mystic Maya didn't kill that nice man...\nPhoenix:\nShe definitely didn't!\nPearl:\nYes, of course. But if she didn't... Then someone else did, right? Um, that \"murderer\" person!\nPhoenix:\nYes, Pearls.\nPearl:\nOh... I see...\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder what's wrong... She seems sad...)\nExamine\nPhone booth\nPhoenix:\nIt's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. I called the police from this phone.\nTalk\nToday's trial\nPhoenix:\nSo, what did you think of seeing your first trial?\nPearl:\nI was really surprised! I had never seen so many people before!\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh...\nPearl:\nAnd Mystic Maya looked so small... and helpless.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, Maya's already naturally short, so...)\nPearl:\nAnd then, that snobby woman with the ruffly clothes...\nPhoenix:\n(Ruffly... Oh, she means Franziska...)\nPearl:\nShe had such a bad attitude! She acted like she had already decided that Mystic Maya did it... I am going to tell her what I think of her tomorrow!\nPhoenix:\n(I wouldn't miss tomorrow's trial for the world...)\nProsecutors (appears after \"Today's trial\")\nPearl:\nWhy was that woman bullying Mystic Maya?\nPhoenix:\nWell, she's the opposite of a lawyer -- a prosecutor, so her job is to prove people guilty. They don't care if someone's innocent. All they care about is if they win.\nPearl:\nTh-That's terrible! B-But... She's really a good prosecutor with a heart on the inside, right?\nPhoenix:\n... There's no one like that. All prosecutors are the same. ... Well, \"he\" might have become a good guy... Eventually...\nPearl:\n\"He\"? Who are you talking about, Mr. Nick? Is it that person Mystic Maya was talking about? Mr. Eh-ji-werth...?\nPhoenix:\n...That was a long time ago. He's not around anymore...\nPearl:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nHe clutched onto his foolish pride too fiercely... and died for it.\nPearl:\nO-Oh... That's too bad...\nThe murderer\nPhoenix:\nBy the way...\nPearl:\nYes? What is it?\nPhoenix:\nUm, you wouldn't happen to know anything about who the murderer is... would you?\nPearl:\nWh-Why are you asking me!?\nPhoenix:\nNo, I was just thinking earlier...\nPearl:\nI didn't see anything!\nPhoenix:\n(She \"didn't see anything\", huh...? Speaking of that... During the murder... where was Pearls, and what was she doing...? And on top of that... This key... Just when did she pick this up...?)\nPearl's alibi (appears after \"The murderer\")\nPhoenix:\nI just realized that I never asked you what you were doing at the time of the crime.\nPearl:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls, where were you and what were you doing when the murder happened?\nPearl:\nAh...!\nPhoenix:\n...?\nPearl:\nWh-What I-I w-was doing? Ah, I-I w-wasn't d-doing a-anything!\nPhoenix:\n(She's really bad at lying...) You can whisper it to me. I won't tell anyone else. I promise.\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nAah!\nPearl:\n... Um... I guess you can see through my lie, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Clearly.\nPearl:\nI can't lie to you, can I, Mr. Nick?\nPearl's alibi (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou really won't tell me what you were doing at the time of the murder...?\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPearl:\nI'm sorry...\nPhoenix:\nBut with the Magatama, I can unlock your Psyche-Locks, right?\nPearl:\nYes... Ah, what should I do...? Should I tell you what my secret is...?\nPhoenix:\n(If you would just tell me, it would be easier for the both of us...)\nPearl:\nI'm so nervous...\nPhoenix:\n(Pearls is holding the key to this whole case! I can feel it! ...Speaking of keys, this one turned out to be quite important too... I didn't think it would literally be the \"key\" to today's trial.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPearl:\nSo... that's a lawyer's Sacred Treasure?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nPearl:\nI feel like it has a mysterious power, just like my Magatama...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, well, I guess I can let her think what she wants on this one...)\nFolding Screen\nPearl:\nSo you like things about spirit channeling too? The Kurain Sacred Writings are on this folding screen.\nPhoenix:\nOh? Is that what's written on it?\nPearl:\nThere are six lines to the Sacred Writings. Cleanse thy soul... Open the door to the spiritual realm beyond... Converse with the departed... ... Cast on thyself Protection... Maintain the spell... Release the spell...\nPhoenix:\n(So basically, this has nothing to do with the murder... Well, that's super.)\nBlack Key\nPhoenix:\nAbout this key, Pearls... You found it on the day of the murder, right?\nPearl:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nNow, where you found this key is very important. So, please tell me, Pearls. Where did you find this?\nPearl:\nUm... I found it in the incinerator...\nPhoenix:\nThe incinerator? (Hmm, is she talking about the one in the garden?)\nPearl:\nThe door on it was a little open, so I took a peek...\nPhoenix:\nWhen was that?\nPearl:\nIt was after the channeling, when everyone was in a panic.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n...? Yes?\nPearl:\nAre you going to tell my mother?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? You mean, tell Morgan what you did?\nPearl:\nYes. If she finds out that I was playing in the left-over trash, I'll get a spanking.\nPhoenix:\n...Ah, gotcha. Well, let's keep it a secret from her then, alright? (Hmm, the incinerator, huh? Sounds like a good place to search next...)\nKnife\nPearl:\nI've seen this knife before.\nPhoenix:\nReally!? Where!?\nPearl:\nM-My kitchen...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh... That's right... This knife belongs to the Feys...)\nPearl:\nI'll skin and cut up some apples for you later, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nO-OK... Thanks.\nMaya's Costume\nPearl:\nTh-That's Mystic Maya's!\nPhoenix:\n(Ack!! I shouldn't have shown her something this violent...)\nPearl:\nI-I-Is that... Blood!?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... It's nothing. Really. Just forget your ever saw this, okay? (What was I thinking? I can't show stuff like this to a child.)\nLotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, showing her this picture might cause severe trauma...)\nPearl:\n...?\nMia Fey profile\nPearl:\nI knew her for a little while. Mystic Mia was your teacher, right? I'm sure she was a great Master of Lawyers.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Master of Lawyers\"... I guess...? I mean, it's not exactly a martial art...)\nPearl:\nYou should keep training, Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, you're probably right.\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nTo tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother wouldn't let me.\nPhoenix:\nI think your hair now suits you perfectly.\nPearl:\nR-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*\nPhoenix:\n*fidget, fidget*\nFranziska von Karma profile\nPearl:\nAh! This person! I can't let her get away with bullying Mystic Maya like that! I'm going to cast a curse on her!\nPhoenix:\nC-Can spirit mediums really do that...?\nPearl:\n... Actually, no, I guess not... Grr... I have to find something I can do, then!\nPhoenix:\n(When they're mad, the women of the Fey family could give Medusa a run for her money...)\nJune 21Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nThis case has had me out of the office most of the time... I can come back tomorrow. Helping Maya should be my top priority now.\nExamine\nCharley the plant\nPhoenix:\nCharley. A quite decorative plant. He's a handful but I've grown quite attached to the little fella. He also helps me to remember all the good times with Mia.\nJune 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(Maya must still be in questioning... She'll probably be done in a little bit, so I'll come back later...)\nJune 21Fey ManorMeditation Room\nPhoenix:\n(It's really empty... There's supposed to be training held today, but I guess it's already over...)\nExamine\nDoor\nPhoenix:\nA door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. But I guess it wasn't strong enough to withstand The Phoenix!\nJune 21Fey ManorChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\n(...Hmm, looks like Morgan's here too, but she hasn't noticed me yet... What is she doing...? She looks like she's talking to a picture...)\nMorgan:\n...Don't you see? Take a look around... Finally, my chance has come... I've waited for this day for so long! That's right... Prepare yourself, dear Misty...\nPhoenix:\n(What in the...!?)\nMorgan:\nWho's there!? ...Oh, if it isn't Mr. Wright...\nPhoenix:\nUm... Just curious, but that picture you were just looking at...\nMorgan:\nOh, today was that event, was it not, good sir? I heard you did well.\nPhoenix:\nHuh, oh, yes... Thank you.\nMorgan:\nI am terribly sorry I could not attend the trial today. Please accept my apology. I had a previous engagement, as I had to watch over the trainees' training today.\nPhoenix:\n(I get the sense she really doesn't want to talk about the picture...)\nMorgan:\nAll because the Master can't be here with us, you understand. And that is why a lowly branch family member such as myself must do this.\nExamine\nSpace behind folding screen\nPhoenix:\nThere is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. There wasn't anyone back here at the time of the murder... Or that's what Lotta testified in court... (I knew I should've taken a look... I can always count on Lotta to make things hard...)\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nHave you remembered anything about the murder? (Changed from [Have you remembered something about the murder?] in the original release)\nMorgan:\nNo, I told you everything I know already.\nPhoenix:\nWere you in this room the whole time when Lotta and I went to call the police? (Changed from [Where [sic] you in this room the whole time when Lotta and I went to call the police?] in the original release)\nMorgan:\nYes, of course. I was by Mystic Maya's side the entire time. I performed the Spirit Severing Technique and held her in my arms afterward.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, you said that yesterday as well. Did anything else happen?\nMorgan:\nI would like to say more did, however that is all that occurred.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, I was really hoping for some new info...)\nMorgan:\nI suppose nothing happened in the end, good sir. Sorry to have played on your hopes.\nPhoenix:\n(Could you possibly be more patronizing...?) (Chnaged from [Why do I feel like I was just made fun of in the worse way possible...?] in the original release)\nTraining\nPhoenix:\nSo do the students train every day?\nMorgan:\nYes, absolutely. They were given a day off the day after the murder, of course, however...\nPhoenix:\nAnd I assume both Maya and Pearls went through this training...?\nMorgan:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nAck! Yes, yes! (Wow, she got real scary, real fast...)\nMorgan:\nHow many times must I tell you before you understand, good sir? They are to be addressed as Mystic Maya and Mystic Pearl.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... I meant Mystic Maya and Mystic Pearl... Wait... I'm sorry, but \"Mystic\" Pearl? Isn't that going a bit too far...?\nMorgan:\nNext question, please.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh man... She's really being a pain in the butt about this...)\nMorgan:\nPlease remember to watch not only what you say, but how you say it, good sir.\nThe Master\nPhoenix:\nSo the Master is... um, Maya's mother, right?\nMorgan:\n...Mystic Misty... She is a brilliant medium.\nPhoenix:\nAnd where is she now...?\nMorgan:\nWe are not sure.\nPhoenix:\nNot sure?\nMorgan:\nAbout 16 or 17 years ago, Mystic Misty failed at channeling a certain spirit. And after that... she simply disappeared.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMorgan:\nI don't believe she will return to this village, in any case. And in four years' time, her name will be forever erased from this village.\nPhoenix:\n...Erased?\nMorgan:\nA person who has been away from the village for over 20 years is considered dead...\nPhoenix:\nOh, I see.\nMorgan:\nAnd that is four years from now for her. When that happens, a new Master will be appointed to Kurain Village.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nMorgan:\nMystic Maya was supposed to become the next Master... However with this... murder, I'm afraid...\nPhoenix:\n(I must be imagining things... I thought she was laughing to herself for a second there...)\nPresent\nFolding Screen\nMorgan:\nThere are six parts to the Kurain Sacred Writings. To think that this valued treasure of our village... and Mystic Maya were both shot by a gun...\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's...\nMorgan:\nEven if it was something that occured during a channeling, it is an unforgivable act.\nBlack Key\nMorgan:\nThis... This is the key to this room!\nPhoenix:\nThat's right.\nMorgan:\nB-But why do you have it, good sir!?\nPhoenix:\nThat, I'm not telling.\nMorgan:\nR-Return it at once!\nPhoenix:\nI... I can't. It's evidence, after all. (I think she knows exactly how important this key is to this murder... But what is this feeling I'm getting from her? It feels... Hmm... I can't describe it.)\nMaya's Costume\nMorgan:\nThat is Mystic Maya's costume, isn't it...? It's a shame. I never thought anything like that would happen to her...\nPhoenix:\nBut we don't know that it was Maya that did it...\nMorgan:\nOh, poor Mystic Maya.\nPhoenix:\n(Do you ever listen to anyone other than yourself?)\nLotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2\nMorgan:\nThat is Mystic Maya before I applied the Spirit Severing Technique... This picture... It was taken without my express permission. I knew allowing a person like her from the \"Heartland\" into our country was a bad idea.\nPhoenix:\n(You do realize that the \"Heartland\" is a part of this country, right...?)\nTurner Grey profile\nPhoenix:\nAbout this person...\nMorgan:\nOh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man. And see how pitifully he died.\nPhoenix:\nInsignificant...?\nMorgan:\nThat would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?)\nMia Fey profile\nMorgan:\n...Oh, my... I think I may know of this person from somewhere...\nPhoenix:\nIt's Mia. You know, Maya's older sister?\nMorgan:\n...! Aah! Yes, that is who she is...\nPhoenix:\n(...How could you forget a daughter of the Master...!?)\nMorgan:\nIf memory serves, she became a lawyer. Oh, how splendid for her, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\n(That soft, kind smile... It's the kind that tells you a pair of devil horns are not too far away...)\nPearl Fey profile\nMorgan:\nCome to think of it, I don't believe I have seen my child today. Would you happen to know where she is, good sir?\nPhoenix:\nN-No, I wouldn't.\nMorgan:\nHonestly! Take one day off from training, and it is neigh impossible to make it up. Good sir! I pray you are not teaching her strange, fiendish things in her time off!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy. Here comes her anger. ...And we were having such a civil conversation too...)\nMorgan Fey profile\nMorgan:\nBeing born as one of the Fey family, but of weak spiritual power... It makes the people of this village look down upon you, you know?\nPhoenix:\nI-I didn't know that...\nMorgan:\nBut I will be alright. ...As long as I have Pearl. I am satisfied because I have my Pearl.\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this?\nMorgan:\nI am terribly sorry, but I am afraid my spiritual powers are not as strong as you might think... I really am terribly sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Um, but this has nothing to do with your spiritual power...)\nJune 21Fey ManorWinding Way\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like there's no one here... And even though the weather is gorgeous today, it's raining inside my heart...)\nExamine\nSide Room entrance\nPhoenix:\nThat's the \"Side Room\". Looks like guests can use it as a place to take a break when they feel tired.\nUrn\nPhoenix:\nIt's a really old urn. There are the ashes of a person long dead inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on.\nJune 21Fey ManorSide Room\nPhoenix:\n(The bedding is all laid out today too. Guess I'll leave them alone for now...)\nExamine\nSliding door\nPhoenix:\nIt's still charming to see a real sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard.\nBed on right\nPhoenix:\n...Excuse me... ... (Who am I talking to? There's no one here.)\nYellow box\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I keep wondering about this box. I'm sure this wasn't here before the murder took place. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom.\nAfter presenting Black Key in Kurain Village:\nJune 21Fey ManorWinding Way\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, there's someone by the incinerator... Ooh, looks like they've noticed me. And are now running at top speed towards me...)\nIni:\nOh, hey! *huff, huff* Like, *huff, huff* You're that dentist guy.\nPhoenix:\nActually, it's Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. Nice to see you again.\nIni:\nOoh, like, real suave. So, it's, like, my turn. It's nice to see you, too.\nPhoenix:\nSo, what's up? You're all out of breath...\nIni:\nL-Like, huh? Oh! Like you mean... Like, I'm just totally happy and like, totally excited to be here.\nPhoenix:\nExcited?\nIni:\nLike, I mean, there are so many things to, like, see! It's, like, the real deal here!\nPhoenix:\nOh, really? For example...?\nIni:\nFor example... Like, that urn over there. Do you, like, know about it?\nPhoenix:\n(All I see is an old, cracked piece of pottery...)\nExamine\nIncinerator\nPhoenix:\nThat's right... Pearls said she found this key inside the incinerator. I guess I should take a look inside for myself... ... Th-This... This is from Maya's costume...! There's blood on it... A tiny bit, but still...\nCloth Scrap added to the Court Record.\nIncinerator (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo, this piece of cloth was burned in this incinerator. And this key was also found in there. Hmm, I get the feeling this incinerator plays a crucial part in this murder...\nUrn (after clearing \"Sacred Urn\" Talk option)\nPhoenix:\nSo there's a spirit in this urn, huh? Hmm, all I see are a bunch of cracks. But I guess maybe the spirit could live in the space between the cracks... Hmm, looks like something's written on it... \"I AM\"? Huh? Weird...\nSacred Urn added to the Court Record.\nUrn (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo there's a spirit in this urn, huh? Hmm, all I see are a bunch of cracks. But I guess maybe the spirit could live in the space between the cracks... Hmm, looks like something's written on it... \"I AM\"? Huh? Weird...\nTalk\nSacred urn\nPhoenix:\nIs there some sort of legend connected with that urn?\nIni:\nLike, yeah! It's, like, this village's treasure!\nPhoenix:\nHuh. Didn't know that.\nIni:\nAnd, like, it's sealed inside that urn.\nPhoenix:\n...Um... \"It's\"...? What are you talking about?\nIni:\nLike, you know! Ami Fey's spirit!\nPhoenix:\nAmi... Fey...? Who's that?\nIni:\nLike, jeez, Mr. Smith. Get with the program! Everyone knows the lady that founded the Kurain Channeling Technique was Mystic Ami.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you don't have to get upset with me...\nIni:\nSo, like, as long as her spirit, like, lives in that urn, the spiritual power of the Fey family'll stick around. Like, isn't that totally romantic?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Romantic, huh...? (If that urn is really as important as she says, it could be a vital clue...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nIni, I want to ask you about the murder...\nIni:\nMurder...?\nPhoenix:\nDr. Grey's... Remember...? (As if there's another one?)\nIni:\nOh, that one! Like, you shoulda said so in the first place! So, like, I totally don't know anything 'cause I was, like, sleeping in the Side Room.\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's not much help... Did you notice anything at all?\nIni:\nLike, come on. What a total bore. I, like, totally have nothing to do with this, like, murder thing...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah. You only introduced Dr. Grey to Kurain Village. No relation, sure. Even if you were only \"acquaintances\", that still means you knew him. Furthermore, your sister, who died in that accident, was a nurse at his clinic...)\nIni:\n...\nTraffic accident (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nAlright then. Why don't you tell me about your sister's fatal accident.\nIni:\n... Like, why? You think, like, it's got something to, like, do with the murder?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know yet, but I'm trying to chase down every lead I can... (Changed from [I don't know yet, but I'm trying to chase down every lead I have...] in the original release)\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(...Psy... Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [...A... A Psyche-Lock!] in the original release)\nIni:\nLike, what is it?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I'm going to need something to pry her mouth open on this one...)\nTraffic accident (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nUm, about the accident, Ini...\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nIni:\nLike, you're totally not gonna give up, are you?\nPhoenix:\nNo, I'm not.\nIni:\nI totally want to forget about my sister, you know? Time to move on and all that.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I have no choice but to remove those locks...)\nPresent\nLotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2\nIni:\nWow, so, like, the Kurain technique is the real deal. I'm gonna, like, have to write about it in, like, my report for school. Hey, so, like, you'll give me this picture for, like, the report, right?\nPhoenix:\nNo way!\nMaya Fey profile\nIni:\nShe's, like, in a lot of trouble, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(She's stealing quick glances at the picture while smiling like a cheshire cat...)\nIni:\nBut, like, this will totally prove the power of channeling.\nPhoenix:\n(...\"This\"? What \"this\" is she talking about...?)\nPearl Fey profile\nIni:\nLike, that's totally Mystic Maya's cousin, right?\nPhoenix:\nYes. Her name is Pearl.\nIni:\nHmm? So, like, this little kid is, like, the next Master...?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, no, no. Maya is the next in line to be Master.\nIni:\nAh, oh yeah. Like, that's right.\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber, and presenting Black Key in Kurain Village, then examining incinerator in Fey Manor - Winding Way:\nJune 21Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... I've been waiting...\nPhoenix:\n(...She looks so helpless...)\nMaya:\nSo? So? How was it!? What did you find out!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... I found a few things...\nMaya:\nIs it so bad that you can't even look me in the eye? (Changed from [My eyes are tearing up, Nick. Don't make me cry...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI... I just need a little more time. It'll all come together by tomorrow, I promise.\nMaya:\nI'm sorry, Nick. Every time I see you, all I do is cause trouble...\nTalk\nToday's trial\nPhoenix:\nSo how was it? Today's trial, I mean...\nMaya:\nYou were fantastic, Nick! Every time I thought our goose was cooked, you managed to turn it all around. I bet it would make a great Hollywood movie!\nPhoenix:\nDon't be silly. We have to concentrate on the trial. We're going to win this, Maya!\nMaya:\n...Thanks a lot. Really. Hey, Nick? The person who shot Dr. Grey wasn't me, was it?\nPhoenix:\nOf course not. You're completely innocent.\nMaya:\nIf that were true, then I'd be really happy, but... there wasn't anyone else in that room with the two of us, right?\nPhoenix:\nWell, did you check behind the folding screen?\nMaya:\nUm... I took a quick glance, but there wasn't anyone there.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... (That's exactly what Lotta said too...)\nNot guilty\nMaya:\nUm, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nMaya:\nWhy do you believe in me? Why do you think I didn't kill Dr. Grey?\nPhoenix:\n...Because of something Mia told me.\nMaya:\nMy sis? What did she tell you?\nPhoenix:\nShe said that spirit mediums can't have dreams. When you're channeling, it's impossible for you to dream because your soul leaves you.\nMaya:\nNow that you mention it... Wait, then... then... I really am...?\nPhoenix:\nYou are not the real murderer. I think that... maybe before you even called the spirit, you were drugged.\nMaya:\nDrugged...?\nPhoenix:\nI think this was planned from the very beginning. And you were set up to take the blame for killing Dr. Grey.\nMaya:\nThat's... That's...\nPearl's alibi (appears after clearing \"Pearl's alibi\" Talk option in Kurain Village)\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you something about Pearls.\nMaya:\nPearly? What about her?\nPhoenix:\nNo matter what I try, she won't answer me. I want to know what she was doing at the time of the murder.\nMaya:\nHuh!? (Changed from [Hmm...] in the original release) W-Wait! Nick! Y-You don't think she did it, do you!?\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, nothing like that...\nMaya:\nShe'd never do anything like that! You hear me!? Never! She's a great kid, and really cute... And really great... And cute.\nPhoenix:\nI didn't really think she was the murderer. But... she's definitely hiding something.\nMaya:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nYou were with her on that day, right?\nMaya:\nYeah. The two of us. We were playing with her ball.\nPhoenix:\nA ball, huh? (Sounds like a dead-end to me...)\nBall (appears after \"Pearl's alibi\")\nPhoenix:\nSo, about this ball...\nMaya:\nIt's nothing really special... Just a plain old ball. I think she was still playing with it when I started the channeling job that day. Pearly really loves to play with that ball.\nPhoenix:\nShe \"loves to play with that ball\", huh...?\nMaya:\nWhen she wants to get it, she always climbs right into the clothing box.\nPhoenix:\nThe clothing box?\nMaya:\nYeah. Pearly's always hiding in there. You know the Side Room? There's a clothing box in there. It's really big, so once you see it, I'm sure you'll know what I'm talking about.\nPhoenix:\n(The clothing box in the Side Room, huh?)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nIt's the same as the last time I saw it. You just like to show it off, don't you, Nick? Are you that thrilled to be a lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's not what I meant by it, but... I mean, I don't really think about it. I just sort of shove it in people's faces... Force of habit, I guess.\nFolding screen\nMaya:\nThat hole... It looks an awful lot like a bullet hole...\nPhoenix:\nThat's probably what it is.\nMaya:\nThat's TERRIBLE! How could this happen to such an important screen!?\nPhoenix:\n... Um, instead of dwelling on the hole, let's focus on the fact that you weren't shot...\nMaya:\n... Hey, you're right! So I was the one who was about to get shot, huh? Th-That's TERRIBLE! Who'd want to shoot little ol' me!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess she didn't realize she was the one being shot at until now...)\nBlack Key\nMaya:\nAh! That's... The Channeling Chamber's...\nPhoenix:\nThis is the only one in the world, right?\nMaya:\nYeah. During the trial, I was kinda wondering why you had it...\nPhoenix:\nI got it from Pearls.\nMaya:\nThat's weird... I swear I locked the door... and then put the key into one of my pouchy sleeves...\nPhoenix:\nYour sleeve? But how and when would your sleeve leave the room? It didn't grow a pair of legs...\nMaya:\nI wonder where Pearly found that key...\nKnife\nMaya:\nThat's a knife from my family's kitchen. I'll never be able to use it again...\nPhoenix:\nIt's alright. I'll buy you a new one, OK?\nMaya:\nArgh! That's not the point! ...I don't ever want to see another knife... ever again...\nMaya's Costume\nMaya:\nThat... That's... That's mine, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\n(Dammit! I upset her again...)\nMaya:\nIt really was me, wasn't it? Wasn't it, Nick?\nLotta's Photo 1 or Lotta's Photo 2\nMaya:\nThis... This is me, right? I guess I really did shoot Dr. Grey...\nPhoenix:\nBut that's not you!\nMaya:\nIs too!\nPhoenix:\nIs not!\nMaya:\nIs too, is too!\nPhoenix:\n(I should've kept this picture to myself...)\nSacred Urn\nMaya:\nThat's Kurain's Sacred Urn. Mystic Ami's soul is sealed inside of it.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know all about it. About how she's the founder of the Kurain Technique.\nMaya:\nOoh, look at Mr. Smarty here! Thinks he knows all! You sound like an occult fanatic.\nPhoenix:\n(...Trust me, this isn't going on my resume any time soon...)\nMaya:\nYou know, I haven't looked at this in a long time. I wonder when it became so cracked?\nCloth Scrap\nMaya:\n...What is it?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not too sure myself, but I found it just now inside the furnace.\nMaya:\nHuh? Is it trash burning day already?\nPhoenix:\nThat's not something I would know about... (I guess she didn't notice the bloodstain. Probably better that way...)\nMia Fey profile\nMaya:\nWhat am I supposed to do, sis!? ...\nPearl Fey profile\nMaya:\nPearly... She definitely has more than me...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What are you talking about?\nMaya:\nWho I think the next Master should be... I mean, she's got more spiritual power than me, and she really works hard at her training...\nPhoenix:\n(Way to go Phoenix... Way to bring the mood down even further... *sigh*)\nFranziska von Karma profile\nMaya:\nSo she's Prosecutor von Karma's daughter, huh?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it.\nMaya:\nWell, then... she'd know about that person, right?\nPhoenix:\n(\"That person\"...? Is she talking about \"him\"?) It's alright. We don't need to talk about that right now...\nMaya:\n...\nAmi Fey profile\nMaya:\n...Mystic Ami. She's a Legendary Spirit Medium. I like the way that word sounds... \"Legendary\"... Ever since I was young, I've dreamed of being a \"Legend\".\nPhoenix:\n(Well, this murder will make you into a \"legend\", alright... Hmm... I probably shouldn't say that last thought out loud...)\nAny other evidence\nMaya:\nUm, I can't think of anything special about it...\nAfter clearing \"Ball\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nJune 21Kurain Village\nPhoenix:\nAh!\nLotta:\nAAAAAAAAH!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey! Wait! Please! Lotta! ... (She ran off into the manor...)\nJune 21Fey ManorMeditation Room\nPhoenix:\nLotta...\nLotta:\nAaack!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey!\nI'm tellin' ya, quit followin' me, ya hear!?

Anyway, did you see Lotta come by here?\nMorgan:\nAh, that girl from the \"Heartland\"... I'm sorry, but she did not pass by here at any time.\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... Lotta! You sure know how to waste a man's time...)\nJune 21Fey ManorSide Room\nPhoenix:\nI'm pretty sure I saw Lotta run in this direction... but it doesn't look like she's here...\nExamine\nBall\nPhoenix:\nIt's Pearl's ball. Maya said that it's always kept in the clothing box... So then, what is it doing on the floor...?\nPearl's Ball taken.\nClothing box\nPhoenix:\nIt's the clothing box where Pearl's ball is usually kept. I wonder what's inside...\nAaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nWhaaaa!? Wh-Wh-What were you doing in there!? What were you thinking!?\nLotta:\nI'm a bad person! Just another piece of human trash. I needed a hole to crawl into...\nPhoenix:\n... (So you crawled into this clothing box because there wasn't a hole to crawl into? Oh man... ...Huh?) There's a small hole in this clothing box... And it's about... 8 inches off the ground! That's the same height as the hole in the folding screen! Then, could this...?\nClothing Box added to the Court Record.\nClothing box (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt's the clothing box where Pearls keeps her ball. I thought I felt my soul shake when Lotta jumped out at me. So it's big enough to fit a grown adult... Well, if she can be called an adult...\nJune 21Fey ManorMeditation Room\nPearl:\nOh, Mr. Nick! That person ran by here just now.\nPhoenix:\nWhat person?\nPearl:\nUm, you know... The person with the fluffy cotton candy hair...\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, she means Lotta.)\nPearl:\nShe said, \"Don't look at me with 'em eyes!\" but... I'm not that scary, am I...?\nPhoenix:\n...I don't think that's quite what she meant.\nPearl:\nOh, that's right. She also wanted me to tell you, \"Goin' on a trip to find myself, so don't ya bother findin' me!\"\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh... Well, thanks.\nPearl:\nYou're welcome.\nTalk\nPearl's alibi (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nPearl:\nAround when Mystic Maya started the channeling on that day, I was playing in the Winding Way... with my ball.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you... broke the urn?\nPearl:\nY-Yes... I broke it... I... I accidentally let Mystic Ami's spirit fly away!\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry. Morgan will never know, OK?\nPearl:\nI'm a bad child... Breaking a village treasure is unforgivable. I thought... that maybe they would make me leave the village. But the broken pieces were pretty big, so...\nPhoenix:\nYou thought you could put them back together, and no one would notice?\nPearl:\n...Yes.\nSacred Urn (appears after \"Pearl's alibi\")\nPearl:\nI found some glue and brought it to the hallway... and fixed the urn there.\nPhoenix:\nThe hallway? You mean \"Winding Way\"?\nPearl:\nYes. The channeling had already started, so I didn't think anyone would walk by.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I see... So, about how long did it take you? It must have been a nasty repair job.\nPearl:\nYes. I might be strong at spiritual things, but when it comes to arts and crafts, I am not nearly as skilled. When I had finished fixing the urn and looked up, I saw you coming into the manor...\nPhoenix:\n(So that's around when Lotta and I were coming back inside after reporting the murder.)\nPearl:\nWhen I saw that, I packed everything up in a hurry. Um... Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nI'm... I'm going to get banished, aren't I?\nPhoenix:\nI really don't think that's going to happen. I mean, I bet Mystic Ami's happy to be free from that cramped urn.\nPearl:\nY-Yeah, I hope so...\nPhoenix:\n(No harm done, and a happy resolution...

Y-You can do that?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou'll tell me if I guess something right, won't you?\nPearl:\n...Y-Yes...\nPhoenix:\nNow, when the murder was taking place, you were here, right?\nPresent Winding Way\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"You were here, weren't you Pearls -- in the Winding Way?\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nI'm pretty smart, Pearls.

I was really worried so I thought I'd see how you were doing.\nPhoenix:\n...You might get caught on film again...\nMia:\nThere are certain risks you have to take in life, or in my case, death. Anyway, how are you doing? Have you found anything useful?\nPhoenix:\nUm, only a little. I think I'm slowly beginning to understand everything, piece by piece.\nMia:\nEverything will resolve itself by tomorrow, somehow.\nTalk\nTomorrow's trial\nMia:\nThere's still a whole slew of questions for you to answer before the trial tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean like how did the real murderer get into the room and kill Dr. Grey...?\nMia:\nYes. Also, when did the murderer enter the Channeling Chamber...? You guys were all standing around in front of the room after the channeling started.\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that the murderer must have gone into that room before the channeling...\nMia:\nThat's what I think, in any case.\nPhoenix:\nBut Maya's already said there wasn't anyone else in there.\nMia:\n...That's true... But if we can't figure out the murderer's movements, we're stuck like a beached whale.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nKurain Channeling Technique\nMia:\nI thought I'd never see this day. Are you actually asking me about spirit channeling?\nPhoenix:\nThis case is all about spirit channeling. And I feel like I don't understand a thing about it...\nMia:\nWell, that's only natural... After all, spirit channeling isn't exactly an everyday thing, is it?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nMia:\nThe power to change your physical appearance into the person you're calling was something our ancestor, Mystic Ami Fey acquired.\nPhoenix:\nI've heard that name before...\nMia:\nThe Fey family was originally a family known for its service to the gods. When Mystic Ami was born, she was given a certain fate through her name. Because, you see, she was named after one of the Buddhas of Buddhism, \"Amitábha\". To this day, her soul is still sealed in the Kurain Sacred Urn. It usually sits in the Winding Way, and has her name written on it.\nPhoenix:\nUm, yeah...\nMia:\nAww, come on, Phoenix. It's just a fairy-tale.\nPhoenix:\n(Are you saying that me being able to see you is just a fairy-tale too...?)\nPresent\nAnything\nMia:\nCome on, Phoenix.

Calm down, calm down. Don't be so harsh to an old man like me.\nNurse:\nDon't you dare start that \"Sweet'ums\" thing with me! If you don't behave, you'll get yourself tossed out of this hospital!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. I didn't think nurses could be this direct or forceful towards their boss.)\nNurse:\nCome now.

Only person I can talk to... ...is this guy... ...Uuuugh...)\nExamine\nWaiting room on left\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the waiting area. It's got the feeling of one and there are sofas lined up... but I don't see all that many patients.\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... Well, it's the quality, not quantity that counts. Uh huh...\nPhoenix:\n(What in the world did that have to do with anything...?)\nDoor at end of hallway\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder where that door way down there leads to...?)\nHotti:\nOh, that's the X-ray room.

No, I can't tell you.\nPhoenix:\n(So you say with a happy smile on your face... \"Mr. Director\"...)\nHotti:\nSee, there's this thing about how doctors aren't allowed to talk about patient stuff.

She was one of those... \"emergency\" cases.\nPhoenix:\nWhat was she ill with?\nHotti:\nIll? Nah, nah, nah. She was injured, not ill. With my trained eye, I could see. Yep, I could see it was a huge wound at that.\nPhoenix:\nA huge injury?\nHotti:\nHer whole body was wrapped around and 'round in bandages and her arm was in a cast.\nPhoenix:\nThat sounds... pretty severe, alright...\nHotti:\nHmm, yes... It was an accident; an accident. They're scary, yes? Cars, hmm, yes...\nPhoenix:\nCar...? ...You mean it was a traffic accident?\nHotti:\nYep! That's what gave her the terrible injuries.

And to do that, I need to know who the real murderer is...\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nMia:\nI know. Now, show me your ability as a lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(This is it... The real murderer that Mia's been hesitant to name all this time!)\nThe murderer (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nLeads to:\n\"...Something's been bothering me all this time.\"\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama (after clearing \"The murderer\" Talk option, before Psyche-Locks appear)\nPhoenix:\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- The Murderer --\nMia:\nPhoenix... You think I'm hiding information about someone from you... Isn't that right?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nMia:\nAlright, then. Tell me who you think I'm protecting.\nPresent Morgan Fey profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Morgan Fey, of course.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUm, I think you're trying to protect this person...?\nMia:\nPhoenix. Don't let me down like this.\nPhoenix:\nI... I'm sorry.\nMia:\nMaya's life is on the line! Concentrate harder!\nPhoenix:\n(Mia's especially strict today...)\nMia:\nSo? Have you gathered your thoughts?\nLeads back to:\n\"Alright, then. Tell me who you think I'm protecting.\"\nPhoenix:\nMorgan Fey, of course. There is no one else you would protect like this, Mia...\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nMia:\nWell done, but... While the murder was being committed, my aunt was outside with everyone else. Which means she already has an alibi.\nPhoenix:\nThat's true...\nMia:\nShow me some evidence that would cast suspicion onto my aunt.\nPresent Black Key\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMy evidence is this black key.\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAt the beginning of the channeling, Maya had possession of this key. And yet, somehow, it magically ended up in the incinerator in the center garden.\nMia:\n...You're right.\nPhoenix:\nThere is only one person who could have done that while I was busy calling the police. The person taking care of Maya -- Morgan.\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's that look mean?\nMia:\nYour argument is too flimsy.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nWhen did the key find its way into the incinerator? It could have happened long after the murder happened.\nPhoenix:\nLong after...?\nMia:\nSomeone could have found the key somewhere and dumped it into the incinerator.\nPhoenix:\nBut that's...\nMia:\nThat prosecutor would use something this small to shred your case. Do you have something other than just the key to cast suspicion on Morgan?\nPresent Cloth Scrap\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This is the other piece of evidence that points to Morgan as the culprit.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nMia:\nPhoenix, we don't have any time left.\nPhoenix:\n(I haven't even said anything yet...)\nMia:\nYou can't pin my aunt as the murderer with one piece of evidence alone.\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have something other than just the key to cast suspicion on Morgan?\"\nPhoenix:\nThis is the other piece of evidence that points to Morgan as the culprit.\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI also found this in the garden incinerator. It's the same material as Maya's costume... Except for the splotch of blood.\nMia:\nBut this piece may not even be from Maya's costume.\nPhoenix:\nBut this is what Maya told me.\n\"While I was channeling, the key was sitting inside my sleeve.\"\nAnd both this key and the piece of cloth were found inside the incinerator.\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume.\nMia:\nBut when Maya was arrested, she was wearing her costume.\nPhoenix:\nThat just means someone changed her clothes.\nMia:\nChanged her clothes? But why...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know why. But... There is only one person who could've done that.\nMia:\nThe one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt.\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nLeads to:\n\"You did very well, Phoenix.\"\nPresent Cloth Scrap\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe proof is this piece of cloth.\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\nI found it in the incinerator near the Winding Way. It's the same material as Maya's costume... Except for the splotch of blood.\nMia:\nYou mean, it's from Maya's costume that she was wearing at the time of the murder?\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nMia:\nBut when Maya was arrested, she was wearing her costume.\nPhoenix:\nThat just means someone changed her clothes.\nMia:\nChanged her clothes? But why...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't know why. But... There is only one person who could've done that.\nMia:\nThe one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt. ...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's that look mean?\nMia:\nYour argument is too flimsy.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nYou have no proof that this piece of cloth is actually from Maya's costume.\nPhoenix:\nBut... this blood...\nMia:\nAnd do you know whose blood that is at this point in time? You don't, do you? Do you have any proof that piece of cloth is from Maya's costume?\nPresent Black Key\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I think this is the proof you're looking for.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nMia:\nPhoenix, we don't have any time left.\nPhoenix:\n(I haven't even said anything yet...)\nMia:\nYou can't pin my aunt as the murderer with one piece of evidence alone.\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have any proof that piece of cloth is from Maya's costume?\"\nPhoenix:\nI think this is the proof you're looking for.\nMia:\n...The key to the Channeling Chamber, huh?\nPhoenix:\nAt the beginning of the channeling, Maya had possession of this key. And yet, somehow, it magically ended up in the incinerator in the center garden.\nMia:\n...You're right.\nPhoenix:\nAnd this is what Maya told me.\n\"While I was channeling, the key was sitting inside my sleeve.\"\nAnd both this key and the piece of cloth were found inside the incinerator.\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that this piece of cloth was a part of Maya's costume.\nMia:\nIt would certainly seem that way...\nPhoenix:\nSomeone changed her into a different set of clothes. And then, burned the costume she was wearing in the incinerator. There is only one person who could've done that.\nMia:\nThe one person who was taking care of Maya... My aunt.\nPhoenix:\nExactly!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nLeads to:\n\"You did very well, Phoenix.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUm, I think this...?\nMia:\nNo. You're wrong. Try again.\nPhoenix:\nYou're really unforgiving today, Mia...\nMia:\nAnd I keep telling you... Don't take this lightly. Maya's life is on the line.\nPhoenix:\n(Mia is really serious...)\nMia:\nNow, I'm going to ask you one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"While the murder was being committed, my aunt was outside with everyone else.\"\nMia:\nYou did very well, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nThank you.\nMia:\nAs long as you have those two pieces of evidence, you can cast suspicion on my aunt. However.\nPhoenix:\nH-However?\nMia:\nLike I said in the beginning, my aunt has an alibi.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... She was with us the whole time...\nMia:\nHere's my final question. You don't have to present solid proof of this for me. But I want to know. If my aunt is the culprit, then how did she commit the murder?\nPhoenix:\nHow she did it, huh...?\nMia:\nI want to hear your thoughts. In order for my aunt to murder Dr. Grey, who or what did she need...?\nPresent Ini Miney profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...Ini Miney. She's the answer to the final question.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n... (No idea... Just throwing things out now...)\nMia:\n...And you were so close too, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nMia:\nThere is no way my aunt could have done it herself. So, thinking logically, where does that leave you? Should be easy for you to figure out...\nPhoenix:\n(So, if Morgan couldn't have done it herself... Then...)\nMia:\nCome on, Phoenix. Think.\nLeads back to:\n\"In order for my aunt to murder Dr. Grey, who or what did she need...?\"\nPhoenix:\n...Ini Miney. She's the answer to the final question.\nMia:\nWhich means that my aunt and Ini Miney...\nPhoenix:\n...Were in cahoots!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nMia:\n...Something's been bothering me all this time. This crime is something no normal person could carry out. The person would have to know a lot about Fey Manor and the village itself to do this.\nPhoenix:\n...But Morgan already has an alibi...\nMia:\nYes, which is why I can't figure out how it was done. We can assume that Ini Miney is involved somehow...\nPhoenix:\nBut we have one big problem on our hands.\nMia:\n...A problem? With what?\nPhoenix:\nWe don't have a motive. Why would Morgan want to kill Dr. Grey? Why would she have to? Also, we don't really know for sure that she was cooperating with Ini.\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Mia doesn't have a clue either, huh?)\nMia:\nHmm... Then, there is only one possibility...\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nMia:\nThink about it, Phoenix. Why would my aunt do something like this? And why would she do it in such an underhanded fashion?\nPhoenix:\nUm... because...?\nMia:\nMother... She is the one who holds the key to this.\nPhoenix:\nMother? Whose? Mine?\nMia:\nDon't be silly. Mine, of course! Misty Fey.\nPhoenix:\n(Mia and Maya's mother? Why would she bring her up now...?)\nMia:\nNow then... Looks like we've gathered everything we could. All we have to do is win tomorrow! Everything will become apparent then.\nPhoenix:\nR-Right, Chief! We won't lose!\nTo be continued.\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)\nToo many errors during Magatama session\n...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...\nPhoenix:\n(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)",

I don't, like, remember anything else. -Doctor Lurking in the Shadows? If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney.

I mean, she's been in Germany all this time all by herself, and she's so grown up!Phoenix:\n...Yeah, and I'm sure she felt a lot of pressure from her father's reputation.Maya:\n...And then you look at me, and, well... I'm the daughter of the Master, but I'm still just a little girl. And on top of that, I'm the suspect in a murder trial.Phoenix:\n(Um... But I think you're really strong too, Maya, for all you've gone through...)Pearl:\nGood morning! The two of you look like you're doing well today. I'm happy for you!Maya:\nHey! Morning, Pearly!Pearl:\nYou'll be safe today, Mystic Maya!Maya:\nHuh? What do you mean?Pearl:\nMy mother is coming today to show her support!Maya:\nY-Yeah... Yeah! That's right, Pearly!Phoenix:\nHey, Pearls...Pearl:\n...? Yes, Mr. Nick?Phoenix:\nUm, do you think you could do me a big favor? Could you channel Mia today too?Pearl:\nHuh? ...I was sort of hoping to sit in the audience today and watch...Phoenix:\n...Please. It's very important to me. I don't feel confident enough without her help...Pearl:\nMr. Nick! That's enough! You can't show weakness in front of the person you love!Maya:\nP-Pearly! N-Not this again...Phoenix:\nPlease, can you do this for us, Pearls?Pearl:\nUm... Alright. I'll do it. I'll do it for Mystic Maya's sake. See you later, then!

Mr. Phoenix Wright. I look forward to tonight's news with great joy. The image of your defeated face will be transmitted all over the world!Mia:\nAll over the world, huh? Sounds like you've made quite a name for yourself, Phoenix.von Karma:\nDon't be foolish, you foolish fool wearing the foolishly foolish clothes. The famous one is me! I'm the prodigy who has never lost a case since becoming a prosecutor five years ago. Naturally, the world's eyes are on me, as I conduct my first trial in this country!Mia:\nUh, huh... That's nice, Ms. von Karma.von Karma:\nHmph. Glad to see you're in such good \"spirits\" today, Ms. Fey.Phoenix:\n(Uhh... It's true what they say... Women really are scary when they fight... *gulp*)Judge:\nNow then. A very interesting theory was presented during yesterday's session.von Karma:\nThat the defendant could have left the Channeling Chamber, correct?Judge:\nYes. And this key is proof of that. This key, the only key to the Channeling Chamber, was not where it should have been.von Karma:\nYour Honor, I would like to say one thing before we begin.Judge:\nA-Alright... Let's hear it.von Karma:\nThe prosecution has determined that from the time of the murder to the time of arrest, the defendant did indeed leave the room at one point.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Judge:\nBut... Ms. von Karma! Then... How do you explain this picture? Are you saying then, that the person in this picture is not the defendant...?von Karma:\nI never said that wasn't the defendant.Judge:\nTh-Then what is the meaning of this...?von Karma:\nAll I am saying is that Maya Fey, after killing the victim, exited the room. And I believe that is when she dropped this key.Judge:\nCan you substantiate your claim?von Karma:\nIsn't that what I'm here for? The prosecution would like to call the defendant's aunt, Morgan Fey, to the stand.Mia:\n...Just as I suspected. Aunt Morgan...Phoenix:\n(Poor Mia...

I mean, she's been in Germany all this time all by herself, and she's so grown up!Phoenix:\n...Yeah, and I'm sure she felt a lot of pressure from her father's reputation.Maya:\n...And then you look at me, and, well... I'm the daughter of the Master, but I'm still just a little girl. And on top of that, I'm the suspect in a murder trial.Phoenix:\n(Um... But I think you're really strong too, Maya, for all you've gone through...)Pearl:\nGood morning! The two of you look like you're doing well today. I'm happy for you!Maya:\nHey!

Could you channel Mia today too?Pearl:\nHuh? ...I was sort of hoping to sit in the audience today and watch...Phoenix:\n...Please. It's very important to me.

Mr. Phoenix Wright. I look forward to tonight's news with great joy. The image of your defeated face will be transmitted all over the world!Mia:\nAll over the world, huh? Sounds like you've made quite a name for yourself, Phoenix.von Karma:\nDon't be foolish, you foolish fool wearing the foolishly foolish clothes. The famous one is me! I'm the prodigy who has never lost a case since becoming a prosecutor five years ago. Naturally, the world's eyes are on me, as I conduct my first trial in this country!Mia:\nUh, huh... That's nice, Ms. von Karma.von Karma:\nHmph. Glad to see you're in such good \"spirits\" today, Ms. Fey.Phoenix:\n(Uhh... It's true what they say... Women really are scary when they fight... *gulp*)Judge:\nNow then. A very interesting theory was presented during yesterday's session.von Karma:\nThat the defendant could have left the Channeling Chamber, correct?Judge:\nYes. And this key is proof of that. This key, the only key to the Channeling Chamber, was not where it should have been.von Karma:\nYour Honor, I would like to say one thing before we begin.Judge:\nA-Alright... Let's hear it.von Karma:\nThe prosecution has determined that from the time of the murder to the time of arrest, the defendant did indeed leave the room at one point.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Judge:\nBut... Ms. von Karma! Then... How do you explain this picture? Are you saying then, that the person in this picture is not the defendant...?von Karma:\nI never said that wasn't the defendant.Judge:\nTh-Then what is the meaning of this...?von Karma:\nAll I am saying is that Maya Fey, after killing the victim, exited the room. And I believe that is when she dropped this key.Judge:\nCan you substantiate your claim?von Karma:\nIsn't that what I'm here for? The prosecution would like to call the defendant's aunt, Morgan Fey, to the stand.Mia:\n...Just as I suspected. Aunt Morgan...Phoenix:\n(Poor Mia...

I'm sorry... I simply could not understand her atrocious English, not to mention she looked awful!\nPhoenix:\n(I can already see people in the heartland gearing up for a riot...)\nMorgan:\nIn any case, I have already sent the repair bill to your office, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nOh, uh, thanks.\nJudge:\nHmm... What did you do after that, Ms. Fey?Morgan:\nI requested that Mr. Wright and the other lady please contact the police.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas it really necessary to have two people do something so simple as call the police? If there was a possibility of escape, then one of us should have stayed behind!\nJudge:\nHmm, yes. That is a very good point.\nMorgan:\nAt that time, I, myself, was a little confused.

I have to wonder myself!\nvon Karma:\nIt's true that this witness is not able to confirm this.

After we get more information from her we may be able to use it later to our advantage.After pressing second, third, fourth, and sixth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! From what I can tell, there is nothing wrong with this witness's testimony. And from what she has said, we can establish that Maya Fey did leave the Chamber.Phoenix:\n(Hmm... I hope this isn't going to come back and bite us in the butt...)von Karma:\nNow, let's take the next logical step and ask, \"Where did the defendant go after leaving the Channeling Chamber?\"Judge:\nYes, yes...

It's, like, I guess, most people call it \"occult stuff\".Judge:\nEven if that's what most people call it, I can't say I understand what that means...von Karma:\nThen I suggest you go home and research it yourself.Judge:\nYes, sir.von Karma:\nNow then, Ms. Miney, after the murder took place, you spoke with the defendant, Maya Fey.

We've done this so many times in this case I've lost count.)\nLeads to:\n\"Your lies end here!\"There is no way!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your lies end here!\"Phoenix:\nYour lies end here!Ini:\nWh-What do you!?Phoenix:\nThe witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room. And I say that's not possible, because there is clearly a contradiction here!Judge:\nA contradiction...!? Where is this contradiction!?It's in her testimony just now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Earlier in your testimony, Ms. Miney, you made the following statement.\"It's in the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe answer is in the Court Record!\nJudge:\nWh-What!?\nvon Karma:\nHmph. Planning to throw out another irrelevant piece of evidence?\nJudge:\nVery well. The court will see this evidence...\nMia:\nWait!\nPhoenix:\nM-Mia!\nMia:\nI don't know what you plan on showing to the court, but I can guarantee you the answer is not there. Just this once, I'll lend you a hand. Now, rethink your answer.\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. What is your answer?\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! OK, time to add another bluff to the pile...)\nLeads back to:\n\"The witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room.\"Help me, Mia!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I may have overreached on this one... Is there really a contradiction somewhere...?)\nMia:\nDon't worry, you're on the right path, Phoenix. It might be a little hard for you to see the contradiction, but it's there. So, just this once, do you want me to help you out?\n\n\n\nYes, please help me!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nPlease, I need your help right now!\nMia:\nH-Hold on... First, calm down, Phoenix. ...Good. ...That girl... She slipped up with her words.\nPhoenix:\n...Her words?\nMia:\nIf she really was in the Side Room the entire time, then she just testified about something she shouldn't have any knowledge of.\nPhoenix:\nA-And what is that!?\nMia:\nThe rest is for you to figure out on your own.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. What is your answer?\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! OK, time to add another bluff to the pile...)\nLeads back to:\n\"The witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room.\"\n\n\n\n\nNo, I think I can do it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, it's \"hard for me to see\"...? I can't just accept her help without thinking it through myself!)\nMia:\nHa ha, that's the spirit. Give it another try.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. What is your answer?\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! OK, time to add another bluff to the pile...)\nLeads back to:\n\"The witness says that during the actual murder, she was asleep in the Side Room.\"Phoenix:\nEarlier in your testimony, Ms. Miney, you made the following statement.Ini:\nAnd, like, Ms. Morgan was the only one in the Channeling Chamber, you know?Phoenix:\nIt's true that at the time, both myself and Ms. Hart were not there. We had gone to call the police.Ini:\n...S-So? Like, what does that, like, have to do with anything!?Phoenix:\nIt's very simple. Ms. Miney, how did you know that fact?Ini:\n...H-How...?Phoenix:\nI concede that Ms. Fey was the only person in the Channeling Chamber. However, someone who was \"asleep\" in the Side Room could not have known that!Ini:\n...!Phoenix:\nWhich means, Ms. Miney! You did, in fact, go to the Channeling Chamber. But you didn't go there by way of the Winding Way! (Changed from [However, you didn't go there by way of the Winding Way!] in the original release)Ini:\nGwaaaaaaaaaaaa!Judge:\nB-But! Look at the manor guidemap! If one were to go between the Side Room and the Channeling Chamber, one would have to use the Winding Way!Phoenix:\nYes, that's right, Your Honor. Which is why... Which is why I ask this very important question! Where was the witness at the time of the murder!?Ini:\n...Umm... Urrrr...Phoenix:\nMs. Miney! Please answer the question!von Karma:von Karma:\n... Don't ask a question off of a baseless assumption, if you please...Phoenix:\n...!von Karma:\nWell, I suppose since you've put it out on the table, Mr. Phoenix Wright... you might as well answer the question for us! Where was the witness at the time of the murder!?Mia:\nNow's your chance, Phoenix.Phoenix:\nYeah!Mia:\nThe only person who could have killed Dr. Grey was Ini Miney! So now is the time to prove it!Judge:\nNow, then, Mr. Wright. Let's hear your answer. Where was the witness when the murder took place?Present Channeling Chamber\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Miney was here, of course!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nShe was here...\nMia:\nPhoenix!

Keep disrupting this court, and this trial is over. Is that clear!?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... Sorry...\nLeads back to:\n\"Now, then, Mr. Wright.

Ms. Miney was at the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! ...That's... Why, that is... Uwaah!von Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! Have you lost your mind!? Yesterday's testimony established that only the victim and the defendant were in the Chamber when the channeling started!Judge:\nYes! Yes, that is correct!

Looks like I'm going to have to one up her!) Yeah, count on it!\nMia:\nPhoenix, you can't lose your cool like this! ...And, grow up.\nPhoenix:\nEh?...

Recall yesterday's testimony!Lotta:\nThere ain't no way anyone was hangin' out behind that foldin' screen!Ini:\nSee! You stupid jerk! Quit being so quick to pin it on me, slimeball!Judge:\n...N-Now, now... Ms. Miney... One so young as you shouldn't be saying...Ini:\nShut it, gramps. As if you know exactly how old I am!Judge:\nI-I'm sorry!Phoenix:\n(Looks like the pipe's about to burst... Guess I should help it along...) The witness was hiding behind the folding screen...

It's like they did a mind meld all of a sudden...)\nMia:\nDon't let them affect you! Just think about the correct answer.\nIni:\nWhat's wrong, boy!? Come on, say something, you loser!\nLeads back to:\n\"...N-Now, now... Ms. Miney... One so young as you shouldn't be saying...\"Phoenix:\nMs. Miney! How you were able to hide at the scene of the crime is very simple! You were hiding inside this box!Ini:\nAaah! Th-Th-That tiny little box!? No person could fit in that!Phoenix:\nSorry, but your theory has already been disproved. (Lotta disproved you when she was hiding from me in it.)Ini:\nUmm...!von Karma:von Karma:\nBut that clothing box was in the Side Room, right!? Which means it has nothing to do with the murder at all!Ini:\nTh-That's right! I was sleeping there, so I should know! That clothing box was there in the Side Room, the whole time!Judge:\nHmm... Mr. Wright. Do you think you can prove where the clothing box was at the time of the crime?No, I can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHmm... It's kind of hard to prove...\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\nUm... I guess by that look, there is a way to prove it?\nMia:\nIf you look in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I should take a look at the Court Record...)\nJudge:\nWell, then.

Where have we heard that before...?von Karma:\n...The folding screen... It had a hole at the same height...Phoenix:\nThat's right! I hope this has opened your eyes to what happened! At the time of the shooting, the clothing box was sitting behind the folding screen. Which is why the bullet from the pistol hit both the box and the folding screen! It went through the screen, and then into the box.Ini:\n...Nnngh...!Phoenix:\nMs. Miney! You were hiding behind the folding screen, waiting for your chance! Yes, for your chance to kill Dr. Grey!Ini:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaah!Judge:\nOrder! Order! ...So what you are saying--von Karma:von Karma:\nTh-Then... Mr. Phoenix Wright! What about this picture!? Are you saying that the person in this photo... is Ms. Ini Miney!?Phoenix:\nThat is exactly what I am saying! Ms. Ini Miney! You were hiding inside this clothing box all along! And you wore a medium's costume to masquerade as Maya Fey!Judge:\nT-To masquerade as Maya Fey!?Phoenix:\nShe had it planned from the very beginning! She would kill Dr. Grey, and pin the blame on my client!Ini:\n...N...No... S-Stop...von Karma:\n...I can't stand to listen to any more of this foolishness! If that's the case, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I have a proposition! This whole idea that the witness moved the clothing box to the crime scene, pretended to be the defendant, killed the victim, and then fled the scene of the crime; It's not possible for one person to do all that by herself!Correct. It's not possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It really is impossible.\"No, it is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure it's possible if you were to try! Ow!\nvon Karma:\nI don't want to hear \"if\"! If you're going to give me \"if\", then give me some proof along with it. Where did Ini Miney get the costume then!? How about the wig!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, I wasn't talking about that exact point... I meant, people, humans. If we want to do something bad enough, then...\nJudge:\nThat's enough! Beyond simply proposing that it is possible for one person to commit this crime, it is the duty of a lawyer to back up his or her claims.\nIni:\nYeah, it's your duty!\nJudge:\nIf you can't do that, then your proposal falls flat.\nIni:\nYeah, it totally falls flat!\nPhoenix:\n(...Why... Why do you have to hurt me so...?)\nMia:\nIt's alright, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nIt isn't possible for one person to commit this crime, but...\nPhoenix:\n(... Ack! That's... That's right!)\nLeads to:\n\"It really is impossible.\"Phoenix:\nIt really is impossible. For one person to do all the preparations, that is. Owww!von Karma:\nNeed I remind you!? The foolish receive no mercy...Phoenix:\nW-Wait! Ms. von Karma... You said it was not possible for \"one person\", correct?von Karma:\nWh--!

Okay, I'll think more carefully this time...\nLeads back to:\n\"Ms. Miney!\"Ini:\n...Grr... This person...!Phoenix:\nIf it wasn't someone from Kurain Village, you couldn't have gotten the costume. And if it wasn't someone from the Fey household, you wouldn't have that box to use.von Karma:\nMorgan... Fey!Judge:\nIsn't that the wonderful lady witness we had earlier!?Phoenix:\nWhat do you have to say to this, Ms. Miney!?Ini:\n...Grrr... Grrrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix:\nYou shot Dr. Grey with your own two hands! Do you deny it!?Ini:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!Phoenix:\nI think this is what really happened. The murderer had planted herself at the scene of the crime long beforehand. Dressed in a medium's costume and wearing a wig, she pretended to be the defendant. And then, the channeling started. The murderer crept silently towards the other two, both of whom had their eyes closed. ...First, she drugged Maya Fey with a strong sleeping agent. Then, she stabbed Dr. Grey with the knife! Next, she hid my client inside the clothing box... She did that so she could take Maya's place and frame her for the crime.Mia:\n...But that's when something unexpected happened.Judge:\nUnexpected...?Phoenix:\nYes.*bang!*Phoenix:\nDr. Grey was actually not yet dead! With the last of his strength, he fired a shot at his attacker! And that is why the hole in the folding screen was so low to the ground! The murderer then took the gun from Dr. Grey, and...*bang!*Judge:\nAfter that, you and the other lady thought to break into the room...?Phoenix:\nYes, a gunshot is certainly something you wouldn't expect to hear. Which is why, upon hearing the shots, we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber.*klik*Phoenix:\nMs. Miney... She immediately covered her own costume with blood...*klik*Phoenix:\nAnd pretended to be Maya Fey.von Karma:\nB-But! That sort of deception would have been easy to see through!Phoenix:\nWhich is precisely why Ms. Morgan Fey chased us out.Morgan:\nPlease leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police! Hurry! Before there are more victims here!Judge:\nWh-What is one supposed to say...?Phoenix:\nThis is the real truth behind this murder....Ha... ...Ahahahaha...Judge:\nWh-Who is that!? Laughing at a time like this...!? Ack!von Karma:\nOh, you simpleminded fools. I'm sorry, are you still by chance, evolving?Phoenix:\nWh-What is it this time...?Judge:\nM-Ms. von Karma... Surely...von Karma:\nOf course it was me! Do you really think someone of Von Karma blood would lose due to something this petty?Phoenix:\nWHAT IN THE WORLD!?von Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! Your argument is flawed in one very crucial area!Phoenix:\nAnd that is...?von Karma:\nIf this witness is the real murderer... why would she go through all this trouble?Phoenix:\n...Huh?von Karma:\nWorking together with a medium, pretending to be one, putting on this whole act... What reason would she have to do such foolish things?Phoenix:\nEh? Well, that's... Uh...Ini:\nYeah, that's right! That's exactly what I was gonna say!von Karma:\nOh, and one other thing. Why would Ms. Ini Miney want to kill Dr. Grey? Where is her motive?Ini:\nYeah! That's exactly what I wanted to say too! Yeah! Motive! I don't have a motive!Phoenix:\nA... motive... That's... (I can't say she has no motive here! I have to think of a motive now! What is her reason for wanting Dr. Grey dead...?) The reason you wanted Dr. Grey dead is this!Present Newspaper Clipping 2 or Mimi Miney profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Hah!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nIni:\nHo-hum, ho-hum... Is this a word search? I'm having a tough time finding the word \"motive!\"\nJudge:\nUuugh... My breathing is becoming labored...\nMia:\nMy eyesight is failing me...\nvon Karma:\nMakes you not want to get old, doesn't it, Mr. Phoenix Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(...Ack! I've got to take my time and think carefully about this...)\nMia:\nPhoenix, think back! What kind of ax would Ini have to grind with Dr. Grey? ... There is only one reason, right?\nPhoenix:\n(...Only one...?)\nLeads back to:\n\"A... motive... That's... (I can't say she has no motive here!)\"Ini:\n...Hah! Just as I thought. You bore me with your silly answers, Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\n(Just great. Now even SHE is calling me by my full name...)Ini:\nYou think I did this to get revenge for my sister's death?Phoenix:\nYes! Because through that accident, you suffered a lot of hurt and pain yourself!Ini:\nDon't be stupid! No one has proof that Dr. Grey drugged my sister, right? And you want to say I wanted to take revenge based on nothing?Judge:\nWh-What do you mean by that...?Ini:\nSenile, stupid gramps. ... I'm, like, going to explain, so, like, please listen, OK? It's been over half a year since I was discharged from the hospital. If I, like, wanted revenge, then, like, I wouldn't have waited this long. Um, and 'sides, like, the guy that thought of the spirit thing, was, like, Dr. Grey. It was, like, a total coincidence he asked me about it, you know?Phoenix:\n(She... She's back to her airhead persona...!) (Changed from [She... She's back to her airhead self...!] in the original release) H-However, you see-- Eeeowch!von Karma:\nPathetic, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You failed to support your own theory. ...The end.Judge:\nI think we have our answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. What Ms. Miney has stated is very true. The revenge plan is overly complicated, and she has no motive in the first place. Furthermore, there is no reason for Ms. Morgan Fey to cooperate with this plan. You don't even have any truly decisive pieces of evidence to demonstrate your point.von Karma:\nTsk, tsk. So many faults, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You should really learn your place.Phoenix:\nNnghuuurk! (Wh-What happened!? I thought I had her for sure!...)Ini:\nHee hee... See, like, that's what I, like, told you!Phoenix:\n...?Ini:\nI hope you liked your slice of humble pie! (Changed from [I'm going to serve you a slice of humble pie!] in the original release)Judge:\nVery well, I now conclude the cross-examination of Ms. Ini Miney!???:Mia:\nYour Honor. Please, allow the defense one more minute.Judge:\nAlright.Mia:\nYou can't lose here. Have faith in yourself, Phoenix!Phoenix:\nMia...Mia:\nYes, it does sound like a ridiculously messed up plan for a murder, but you know, regardless, that girl trained for this crime.Phoenix:\n...R-Really?Mia:\n... Listen, Phoenix. Everything happens for a reason. There is a reason for why she had to kill Dr. Grey. And it is also the reason she had no choice but to kill him in this fashion.Judge:\nTime is up, Mr. Wright. Your final answer, please. If you want to say that you can prove Ms. Miney had a motive, then... why did she kill the victim in this way? Can you provide the reason?Phoenix:\n(...Can I... Can I really do this...?)Yes, I can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I am not totally confident here, but I know that I must press on no matter what...\"No, I can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I am not totally confident here, but I know that I must press on no matter what...\"Phoenix:\n(I am not totally confident here, but I know that I must press on no matter what...)Mia:\nThat's right, Phoenix! Only you can do this now!Phoenix:\nI will show and substantiate the fact that Ms. Miney had a motive!Ini:\nHa ha ha. Too bad. You're too late! My cross-examination has already ended, after all. Eeek!von Karma:\n...Interesting. I'll let you have your chance, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Ini:\nWh-What!? Y-You're supposed to be on my side! Aiiiii!von Karma:\nA Von Karma only cares about the perfect win. As long as you have the will to fight, I will knock you down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\n...von Karma:\nAnd I don't care if you are my witness! So help me, I will throw you out of my way! (Changed from [And I don't care if you are my witness! So help me, I will blow you out of my way!] in the original release)Ini:\nN-No way...Judge:\nVery well. The court will take a 5 minute recess. We will continue the cross-examination after we reconvene.Ini:\nH-Hey! W-Wait a sec, here!To be continued.June 22, 12:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Maya:\n...Is it really true... about my aunt...?Phoenix:\nI'm afraid so, Maya. There is no way Ini could've killed Dr. Grey by herself. And under the circumstances, there's no one else other than your aunt, Morgan.Maya:\nThat... That's terrible... Why? Why would my aunt...?Everything is going just as I predicted, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:\nAck! Ms. von Karma!Maya:\nWhy are you doing this!? Why are you trying to take revenge on Nick!? Nick had nothing to do with what happened to your dad.von Karma:\nDon't you have something better to be worrying about? Say, your own situation?Maya:\nUgnn... ...Looking down on me, even though we're the same age...Phoenix:\nAre you done yet? You've caused me enough pain and suffering.von Karma:\nNot yet. My goal is to defeat you, and let the whole world know of your defeat.Phoenix:\n...But even if you do that, it won't bring your father back...von Karma:\n... Hmph. ...Whatever. In the meantime, let's bring this match to its conclusion. And then we'll know who the real winner is.June 22, 12:10 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nCan you prove Ms. Ini Miney had a motive?Phoenix:\nYes, I believe I can. (Ini Miney and Dr. Grey have only one point of connection. And that is the car accident one year ago. The motive I'm looking for must be there...) Ms. Miney. Please testify to this court about your car accident last year.Ini:\nHuh? I thought, like, you wanted to, like, ask about my, like, motive. I, like, don't see the point in, like, bringing up the past.Judge:\nMs. Miney, if you please.Ini:\n...OK, OK.

I think I've heard of this incident.Phoenix:\nIt was all the talk on the tabloid shows, day after day, last year.Judge:\nYes, and there was talk about Dr. Grey... drugging your sister...? Gwuugh!von Karma:\nThose were merely \"rumors\". ...Totally baseless gossip.Judge:\nHmm, yes... Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.Mia:\nRight now, it's impossible to prove that Dr. Grey did in fact drug Ms. Miney's sister.Phoenix:\nYeah...

So, Ms. Miney, what do you have to say to that!?\nIni:\nNnaaawrr!\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nAs the court can see... she's a bit of an airhead. Also, she was leading her \"sister\" at that time.

Why not?\nMia:\nWho is the only person you didn't see with your own eyes at the time of the murder?\nPhoenix:\nIt was Ini Miney, correct?\nMia:\nWhich means, you can safely assume... She is the real murderer.\nPhoenix:\nThat's a pretty daring assumption...\nMia:\nBut it's the most obvious, isn't it? I mean, is there anyone else?\nPhoenix:\nWell, no, I guess not.\nMia:\nIt's worth a shot, even if it's in the dark. So, let's try to prove that Ms. Miney was not in the Side Room at the time!\nPhoenix:\n(Umm, this is bluff number...?

We had gone to call the police.Ini:\n...S-So? Like, what does that, like, have to do with anything!?Phoenix:\nIt's very simple. Ms. Miney, how did you know that fact?Ini:\n...H-How...?Phoenix:\nI concede that Ms. Fey was the only person in the Channeling Chamber. However, someone who was \"asleep\" in the Side Room could not have known that!Ini:\n...!Phoenix:\nWhich means, Ms. Miney! You did, in fact, go to the Channeling Chamber.

Look at the manor guidemap! If one were to go between the Side Room and the Channeling Chamber, one would have to use the Winding Way!Phoenix:\nYes, that's right, Your Honor. Which is why... Which is why I ask this very important question! Where was the witness at the time of the murder!?Ini:\n...Umm... Urrrr...Phoenix:\nMs. Miney! Please answer the question!von Karma:von Karma:\n... Don't ask a question off of a baseless assumption, if you please...Phoenix:\n...!von Karma:\nWell, I suppose since you've put it out on the table, Mr. Phoenix Wright... you might as well answer the question for us!

I said it was hard, but I didn't say it was impossible to prove!\nJudge:\nThen stop puffing up your feathers and hurry up!\nLeads to:\n\"And now, I present the piece of evidence that will prove\"Yes, I can with some evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"And now, I present the piece of evidence that will prove\"Phoenix:\nAnd now, I present the piece of evidence that will prove this clothing box was at the scene of the crime when the murder took place!Present Folding Screen or Clothing Box\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Take a look at this clothing box.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\n..............................\nPhoenix:\n...Um...

As if there's any sort of evidence in that old thing.Judge:\n...! Th-This... What on earth...!? Mfph!von Karma:\nI don't have time for you to sit there surprised. Hurry up and say it already!Judge:\nTh-There's a hole! About 8 inches off the ground!Phoenix:\nHmm, a hole about 8 inches off the ground. Where have we heard that before...?von Karma:\n...The folding screen... It had a hole at the same height...Phoenix:\nThat's right! I hope this has opened your eyes to what happened! At the time of the shooting, the clothing box was sitting behind the folding screen. Which is why the bullet from the pistol hit both the box and the folding screen! It went through the screen, and then into the box.Ini:\n...Nnngh...!Phoenix:\nMs. Miney! You were hiding behind the folding screen, waiting for your chance! Yes, for your chance to kill Dr. Grey!Ini:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaah!Judge:\nOrder! Order! ...So what you are saying--von Karma:von Karma:\nTh-Then... Mr. Phoenix Wright! What about this picture!? Are you saying that the person in this photo... is Ms. Ini Miney!?Phoenix:\nThat is exactly what I am saying! Ms. Ini Miney! You were hiding inside this clothing box all along! And you wore a medium's costume to masquerade as Maya Fey!Judge:\nT-To masquerade as Maya Fey!?Phoenix:\nShe had it planned from the very beginning! She would kill Dr. Grey, and pin the blame on my client!Ini:\n...N...No... S-Stop...von Karma:\n...I can't stand to listen to any more of this foolishness! If that's the case, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I have a proposition! This whole idea that the witness moved the clothing box to the crime scene, pretended to be the defendant, killed the victim, and then fled the scene of the crime; It's not possible for one person to do all that by herself!Correct. It's not possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It really is impossible.\"No, it is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure it's possible if you were to try! Ow!\nvon Karma:\nI don't want to hear \"if\"! If you're going to give me \"if\", then give me some proof along with it. Where did Ini Miney get the costume then!? How about the wig!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, I wasn't talking about that exact point... I meant, people, humans. If we want to do something bad enough, then...\nJudge:\nThat's enough! Beyond simply proposing that it is possible for one person to commit this crime, it is the duty of a lawyer to back up his or her claims.\nIni:\nYeah, it's your duty!\nJudge:\nIf you can't do that, then your proposal falls flat.\nIni:\nYeah, it totally falls flat!\nPhoenix:\n(...Why... Why do you have to hurt me so...?)\nMia:\nIt's alright, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMia:\nIt isn't possible for one person to commit this crime, but...\nPhoenix:\n(... Ack! That's... That's right!)\nLeads to:\n\"It really is impossible.\"Phoenix:\nIt really is impossible. For one person to do all the preparations, that is. Owww!von Karma:\nNeed I remind you!? The foolish receive no mercy...Phoenix:\nW-Wait! Ms. von Karma... You said it was not possible for \"one person\", correct?von Karma:\nWh--! Y-You can't be serious...Ini:\n...*huff*...*huff*...Phoenix:\nMs. Miney! You had an accomplice!Present Morgan Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Grr...

Okay, I'll think more carefully this time...\nLeads back to:\n\"Ms. Miney!\"Ini:\n...Grr... This person...!Phoenix:\nIf it wasn't someone from Kurain Village, you couldn't have gotten the costume.

Fey!Judge:\nIsn't that the wonderful lady witness we had earlier!?Phoenix:\nWhat do you have to say to this, Ms. Miney!?Ini:\n...Grrr... Grrrrrrrrrrr...Phoenix:\nYou shot Dr. Grey with your own two hands! Do you deny it!?Ini:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!Phoenix:\nI think this is what really happened. The murderer had planted herself at the scene of the crime long beforehand. Dressed in a medium's costume and wearing a wig, she pretended to be the defendant. And then, the channeling started. The murderer crept silently towards the other two, both of whom had their eyes closed. ...First, she drugged Maya Fey with a strong sleeping agent. Then, she stabbed Dr. Grey with the knife! Next, she hid my client inside the clothing box... She did that so she could take Maya's place and frame her for the crime.Mia:\n...But that's when something unexpected happened.Judge:\nUnexpected...?Phoenix:\nYes.*bang!*Phoenix:\nDr. Grey was actually not yet dead! With the last of his strength, he fired a shot at his attacker! And that is why the hole in the folding screen was so low to the ground! The murderer then took the gun from Dr. Grey, and...*bang!*Judge:\nAfter that, you and the other lady thought to break into the room...?Phoenix:\nYes, a gunshot is certainly something you wouldn't expect to hear. Which is why, upon hearing the shots, we forced our way into the Channeling Chamber.*klik*Phoenix:\nMs. Miney... She immediately covered her own costume with blood...*klik*Phoenix:\nAnd pretended to be Maya Fey.von Karma:\nB-But! That sort of deception would have been easy to see through!Phoenix:\nWhich is precisely why Ms. Morgan Fey chased us out.Morgan:\nPlease leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police! Hurry! Before there are more victims here!Judge:\nWh-What is one supposed to say...?Phoenix:\nThis is the real truth behind this murder....Ha... ...Ahahahaha...Judge:\nWh-Who is that!? Laughing at a time like this...!? Ack!von Karma:\nOh, you simpleminded fools. I'm sorry, are you still by chance, evolving?Phoenix:\nWh-What is it this time...?Judge:\nM-Ms. von Karma... Surely...von Karma:\nOf course it was me! Do you really think someone of Von Karma blood would lose due to something this petty?Phoenix:\nWHAT IN THE WORLD!?von Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright! Your argument is flawed in one very crucial area!Phoenix:\nAnd that is...?von Karma:\nIf this witness is the real murderer... why would she go through all this trouble?Phoenix:\n...Huh?von Karma:\nWorking together with a medium, pretending to be one, putting on this whole act... What reason would she have to do such foolish things?Phoenix:\nEh? Well, that's... Uh...Ini:\nYeah, that's right! That's exactly what I was gonna say!von Karma:\nOh, and one other thing. Why would Ms. Ini Miney want to kill Dr. Grey? Where is her motive?Ini:\nYeah! That's exactly what I wanted to say too! Yeah! Motive! I don't have a motive!Phoenix:\nA... motive... That's... (I can't say she has no motive here! I have to think of a motive now! What is her reason for wanting Dr. Grey dead...?)

You bore me with your silly answers, Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\n(Just great. Now even SHE is calling me by my full name...)Ini:\nYou think I did this to get revenge for my sister's death?Phoenix:\nYes! Because through that accident, you suffered a lot of hurt and pain yourself!Ini:\nDon't be stupid! No one has proof that Dr. Grey drugged my sister, right? And you want to say I wanted to take revenge based on nothing?Judge:\nWh-What do you mean by that...?Ini:\nSenile, stupid gramps. ... I'm, like, going to explain, so, like, please listen, OK? It's been over half a year since I was discharged from the hospital. If I, like, wanted revenge, then, like, I wouldn't have waited this long. Um, and 'sides, like, the guy that thought of the spirit thing, was, like, Dr. Grey. It was, like, a total coincidence he asked me about it, you know?Phoenix:\n(She... She's back to her airhead persona...!) (Changed from [She... She's back to her airhead self...!] in the original release) H-However, you see-- Eeeowch!von Karma:\nPathetic, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You failed to support your own theory. ...The end.Judge:\nI think we have our answer, Mr. Phoenix Wright. What Ms. Miney has stated is very true. The revenge plan is overly complicated, and she has no motive in the first place. Furthermore, there is no reason for Ms. Morgan Fey to cooperate with this plan. You don't even have any truly decisive pieces of evidence to demonstrate your point.von Karma:\nTsk, tsk. So many faults, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You should really learn your place.Phoenix:\nNnghuuurk!

Please, allow the defense one more minute.Judge:\nAlright.Mia:\nYou can't lose here. Have faith in yourself, Phoenix!Phoenix:\nMia...Mia:\nYes, it does sound like a ridiculously messed up plan for a murder, but you know, regardless, that girl trained for this crime.Phoenix:\n...R-Really?Mia:\n... Listen, Phoenix. Everything happens for a reason. There is a reason for why she had to kill Dr. Grey. And it is also the reason she had no choice but to kill him in this fashion.Judge:\nTime is up, Mr. Wright. Your final answer, please. If you want to say that you can prove Ms. Miney had a motive, then... why did she kill the victim in this way? Can you provide the reason?Phoenix:\n(...Can I... Can I really do this...?)Yes, I can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I am not totally confident here, but I know that I must press on no matter what...\"No, I can't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I am not totally confident here, but I know that I must press on no matter what...\"Phoenix:\n(I am not totally confident here, but I know that I must press on no matter what...)Mia:\nThat's right, Phoenix! Only you can do this now!Phoenix:\nI will show and substantiate the fact that Ms. Miney had a motive!Ini:\nHa ha ha. Too bad. You're too late! My cross-examination has already ended, after all. Eeek!von Karma:\n...Interesting. I'll let you have your chance, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Ini:\nWh-What!? Y-You're supposed to be on my side! Aiiiii!von Karma:\nA Von Karma only cares about the perfect win. As long as you have the will to fight, I will knock you down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\n...von Karma:\nAnd I don't care if you are my witness! So help me, I will throw you out of my way! (Changed from [And I don't care if you are my witness! So help me, I will blow you out of my way!] in the original release)Ini:\nN-No way...Judge:\nVery well. The court will take a 5 minute recess.

There is no way Ini could've killed Dr. Grey by herself. And under the circumstances, there's no one else other than your aunt, Morgan.Maya:\nThat... That's terrible... Why? Why would my aunt...?Everything is going just as I predicted, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:\nAck! Ms. von Karma!Maya:\nWhy are you doing this!? Why are you trying to take revenge on Nick!? Nick had nothing to do with what happened to your dad.von Karma:\nDon't you have something better to be worrying about? Say, your own situation?Maya:\nUgnn... ...Looking down on me, even though we're the same age...Phoenix:\nAre you done yet? You've caused me enough pain and suffering.von Karma:\nNot yet. My goal is to defeat you, and let the whole world know of your defeat.Phoenix:\n...But even if you do that, it won't bring your father back...von Karma:\n... Hmph. ...Whatever.

Gwuugh!von Karma:\nThose were merely \"rumors\". ...Totally baseless gossip.Judge:\nHmm, yes...

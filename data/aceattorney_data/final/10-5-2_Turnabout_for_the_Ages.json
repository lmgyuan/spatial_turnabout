  "previousContext": "Episode 5The Grand Turnabout\nLotta: So, what are y'all gonna do now? I reckon... yer through bein' a prosecutor, right?\nEdgeworth: Yes... that's true, I suppose. (I'm no longer a prosecutor. However...)\nKay: You can't stop thinking about what Mr. de Killer said, right?\nEdgeworth: Indeed...\nde Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved?\nEdgeworth: (This case isn't over yet... The person in the red hood who kidnapped Kay at Gourd Lake... And this letter from an unknown sender. Someone's schemes are at work behind this case...)\nLotta: Must be tough havin' a case you just solved still naggin' at the back of yer mind. Well, I got some investigatin' of my own to be doin', so I'll be off!\nKay: That's amazing! You've already decided on your next scoop?\nLotta: What're ya sayin' there, missy!? Don't you be underestimatin' the likes of Lotta Hart! I've covered a lotta scoops, ya know? I always have an extra scoop or two up my sleeves...\n???: S-Someone! Help!\nKay: Yikes! What's that!?\n???: S-Someone! P-Please help!\nEdgeworth: (Hmm. This woman is...) What's happened!?\n???: S-Somebody's dead! A m-monster...!\nEdgeworth: (A... monster?)\nLotta: I-It's a scoop! A scoop's callin' me!\n???: Please follow me! It's this way!\nKay: Has something else happened? Again!?\nEdgeworth: I don't know... At any rate, we should follow her for now.\nKay: Eh!? These are...!?\nLotta: G-Genuine hoofprints!\nEdgeworth: (Hoofprints? Impossible! No animal could be this large...)\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth! Look!\nEdgeworth: (Agent Lang...! Why is he here?)\nKay: Ah! Someone's on the ground!\nEdgeworth: (It can't be... The president of Zheng Fa... Di-Jun Huang!)\nLang: ........\nEdgeworth: Agent Lang!\nLang: ......Mr. Prosecutor. Didn't take you long to get here.\nEdgeworth: What happened?\nLang: What... happened? Ha! That's what I'd like to know!\nEdgeworth: (It would seem that he's in a considerable amount of shock over the president's death. However... ...what exactly are these giant footprints...? And what could have happened to the president?)\nLotta: It's a m... m... monster!\nEdgeworth: A... monster?\nLotta: Yessiree! Lookie here! Ain't no doubt about it, these are clearly the footprints of a monster! On this day, mankind received a grim reminder: we live in fear of the Mighty Moozilla!\nEdgeworth: (Mighty... Moozilla...?)\nLotta: This here's a scoop! I got myself a scoop! \"Man Trampled to Death by Monster!\" I reckon it'll be the top story in tomorrow's paper!\nEdgeworth: (What nonsense... There are no such things as monsters... Wait, it can't be...?)\nHuang: I am Di-Jun Huang. I have heard of your deeds. You saved my country from a great crisis.\nEdgeworth: The real assassin was you all along...!\nde Killer: That is correct. I received a request from a key individual... ...to take the president's life...\nEdgeworth: (That man... could he have...?)\nLang: Hey, you! Were you the first to discover the body?\n???: Y-Yes, I...! Umm, well.\nEdgeworth: (! Agent Lang?)\nLang: Lang Zi says: \"First come, first suspected.\" You! Did you really just discover the body!?\n???: O-O-O-O-O-Of course!\nKay: Please calm down! You're scaring her!\nEdgeworth: (He does seem to have lost his composure...)\nLang: Tch. Calm down!? How am I supposed to calm down? Do you know who's been murdered!? Di-Jun Huang... the president of Zheng Fa!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: ...Agent Lang. This isn't like you.\nLang: !\nEdgeworth: When we first met, you had an army of subordinates under your command... ...and you boasted of having the highest arrest rate in Interpol. And what now? Did you forget the fundamentals of investigation along with all of your men?\nLang: What... did you say...?\nEdgeworth: Instead of questioning people at random, you should investigate the crime scene first. Am I wrong?\nLang: ........Tch! I don't need you to tell me that. ...I'll do a thorough investigation.\nEdgeworth: (Well. At least it seems he's calmed for now...)\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth! Let's investigate too!\nEdgeworth: Yes. Let us investigate. (Right now, I do not have any investigation rights, but until the police arrive...)\nLotta: What're y'all sayin'? Ain't it obvious who dunnit!? The man behind it all is the Mighty Moozilla! Hm? Well, I guess it ain't the \"man\" behind it, more like the \"monster\" behind it, ya know?\nEdgeworth: Good grief... Could you please just try not to interfere with the investigation?\nLotta: Shut yer trap! Yer the one who better not be stickin' yer nose in my business! I ain't forgivin' ya if ya mess up my scoop!\n???: Umm... Excuse me.\nEdgeworth: (Hmm. It's the woman who first discovered the body. I feel like I've seen her before...)\n???: You're... Mr. Edgeworth, right? Do you remember me?\nEdgeworth: Umm. Y-Yes. That case... from before...\nKay: Huh? Do you know her?\nEdgeworth: Yes, I do. (At least I think I do...)\nKay: My name's Kay Faraday! I'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!\nPenny: My. You have such a cute assistant? I'm Penny Nichols. I'm an assistant at Global Studios. I'm in charge of the props and sets. It's nice to meet you.\nEdgeworth: (Yes, that was it... I once handled a case that occurred during the filming of the Steel Samurai. This woman was a member of the show's staff, and she was involved in the incident. I must have met with her on numerous occasions over the course of the case... ...but to be honest, I had completely forgotten about her...) It's nice to see you again. The fact that you are here must mean that this place is...\nPenny: Yes! This is sort of an outdoor film lot for Global Studios. They're shooting a movie here right now. I was the first to arrive today, to set everything up for the filming... ...but everything seemed strange... Those giant footprints... and that... d-dead body...\nEdgeworth: I see. We shall examine the body. At any rate, could you please contact the police?\nPenny: Y-Yes! Right away!\nEdgeworth: (I'll have to take the time to listen to her story later... First, let's examine the scene. There are many things besides the body that concern me. I'll need to examine every nook and cranny of this place...)\n(Connecting \"Stepped on by a monster?\" and \"Monster's head\" Logic leads to:)\nLang: Mr. Prosecutor. I'm going to take my leave here for a bit. There's something I have to check...\nEdgeworth: (Agent Lang. I wonder if he's caught onto something?) Hm?\n???: ........ ........\nLang: ........\n???: .....Move it.\nLang: What'd you say? Guess you're just a brat with no manners.\n???: ...And you're an annoying old man. Quit your yapping already.\nLang: !\nPenny: I-I'm terribly sorry! Come on, John!\nLang: Tch!\nPenny: Oh! What were you doing!?\n???: .......Who was that?\nPenny: Someone from the police! Why'd you suddenly pick a fight with him?\n???: Hmph.\nKay: That sure was a tense standoff!\nEdgeworth: (He didn't budge an inch, even before Agent Lang...)\nPenny: Ah! Allow me to introduce you! This is John Marsh. He's the lead actor in our movie.\nEdgeworth: (The lead actor... is this child?)\nKay: Hi! I'm Kay Faraday. Nice to meet you!\nEdgeworth: And this is Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth.\nJohn: .......Prosecutor?\nPenny: He's a pretty famous prosecutor, you know.\nJohn: But he's not wearing a prosecutor's badge.\nEdgeworth: Gah! (He's frightfully perceptive...)\nPenny: Ah! John, it's probably better if you didn't go over there...\nJohn: ............\nEdgeworth: (That's certainly not a sight a child should see... However, he is someone involved with the case. I'll need to speak with him later.)\n(Connecting all possible Logic, examining ground around the body, original Moozilla model and table, clearing all \"Talk\" options of Penny and John, and talking with Lotta leads to:)\nEdgeworth: And with that, this portion of the investigation seems to be finished.\nKay: So the murder weapon really is...\nEdgeworth: Yes. As it stands now, the possibility that it was the monster head is quite high.\nKay: So he ended up being squashed by the falling head, huh...\nEdgeworth: Hm?\nLang: Although they're extremely late to the party, the bodyguards and the police have finally arrived.\nBodyguard: Mr. President!\nLang: They really were... far too late.\nBodyguard: Damn it! Who did this!?\nLang: ...They'll pay for this. I swear I'll make them pay. But you know, this much is enough to put me at ease. The person who did this to Huang... ...I've already got my eye on a suspect.\nEdgeworth: What? What do you mean?\nLang: Even though Huang was the victim, he doesn't have extraterritorial rights here. Your country's police have the right to investigate. However, I've already spoken with them. As an agent of Interpol, they're letting me assist in the investigation...\nEdgeworth: ...So they've already established a plan for this investigation?\nLang: I've already found my prey. Now it's time for the hunt... ...Take a look at this. It's a printout from a security camera on the Grand Tower rooftop.\nEdgeworth: Th... This is!\nLang: This camera records people as they get off the rooftop elevator. And guess who was recorded? The president and his killer can be clearly seen!\nKay: Wh-Why is Ms. Courtney there!?\nEdgeworth: (So he's saying Judge Courtney is the murder?)\nCourtney: Prosecutor Edgeworth. I shall leave this offering to the Goddess of Law to you. Deliver her divine judgment against Blaise Debeste!\nEdgeworth: (Could she, who hates crime more than anyone, have...?)\nSecurity Camera Photo jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth: ...Agent Lang. I'd like to hear your thoughts.\nLang:\nLang: ............ Just now, I heard a rumor at the Grand Tower. Miles Edgeworth, that you... are no longer a \"prosecutor\".\nEdgeworth: !\nLang: Naturally, that means you don't even have a shred of investigate authority. So what would be the point of having a logic battle with someone like you?\nEdgeworth: (Hmph...!)\nKay: Why would you say something like that!? Didn't you also just get reduced to being a lone agent!?\nLang: .......... Hey. Answer me this. Even though you've lost your position as a \"prosecutor\"... ...why are you sticking your neck into this case?\nEdgeworth: ........ (Why do I still continue to investigate...?) Agent Lang... Why are you pursuing the criminal who murdered the president? Because you're an Interpol agent?\nLang: ..........\nEdgeworth: Right now, I am also chasing after a certain person. Someone in the shadows, who was behind the murder at the Grand Tower yesterday... Someone who placed Kay in grave danger. ...Even now, they are lurking somewhere, laughing at us. We will uncover the truth, and bring them to justice... ...and a title such as \"prosecutor\" has nothing to do with it. As long as the truth remains hidden... ...I will continue to seek out that truth. For that is a part of my creed.\nLang: ........Haha! You... You're always trying to be so clever, but you really are kind of an idiot.\nEdgeworth: (Hmph. Me, an idiot? How rude...)\nLang: That's the answer I wanted to hear. ...Alright, I'll play along with you for a bit. I've lost all my men, and you've lost your title. And yet, we still continue to investigate... Let's begin this battle of logic between two kindred spirits!\nEdgeworth: You have my thanks...\nLang: However, I won't go easy on you. I'll definitely catch the criminal who murdered Huang. And I won't let you get in my way!\nEdgeworth: Yes... I wouldn't have it any other way!\nLang: Let me show you the truth that this wolf has sunk his fangs into!\nLang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower. Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot. At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two. There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president!\nEdgeworth: It was just the two of them alone on the rooftop... No bodyguards?\nLang: Yeah. I confirmed it with those bodyguards over there. They didn't know about it either. Guess he managed to give them the slip. He must've had something secret to talk about.\nEdgeworth: (President Huang and Judge Courtney... Did those two have some sort of connection?)\nLang: Apparently, he had an arrangement with the owner of the Grand Tower. He requested the entrance to the viewing platform be restricted so that they could be alone. Well, it's not like the owner could turn down a request from the president.\nKay: Does that mean... the last person to see the president was...\nLang: Exactly... Courtney, you mean? It's gotta be her!\nEdgeworth: (Agent Lang's reasoning is certainly sound... However, he has overlooked one major thing...! ...and that's where I must strike!)\nLang: Listen up. That woman met with the president on top of the Grand Tower.\nLang: Two nights ago, she pushed the president off the roof, and he fell onto this film lot.\nLang: At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two.\nLang: There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president!\nEdgeworth: (Agent Lang has overlooked something major...! ...and that's where I must strike!)\nEdgeworth: Shi-Long Lang... For the Interpol agent with the highest arrest rate to have fallen so low.\nLang: What'd you say...!?\nEdgeworth: This is a commemorative photo taken by the staff at Global Studios.\nKay: Everyone's got such great smiles! ...Well, except for John.\nEdgeworth: This photo was taken yesterday.\nLang: What!?\nEdgeworth: If Judge Courtney had murdered the president two days ago... ...then his body should have been there when this photo was taken!\nLang: Owwoooooooh!\nLang: Heh. Perhaps you should have listened a bit more carefully to those involved in the case. Questioning witnesses is one of the basic fundamentals of an investigation, is it not?\nKay: I've captured Mr. Edgeworth's great smile! You really do look most alive when you're cornering your opponent!\nLang: Grr... Just as I expected. It's been a while since I've felt like this.\nEdgeworth: Agent Lang, haven't you been a little hasty in your reasoning?\nLang: ........Tch. I don't need your advice. Lang Zi says: \"The wrath of a wolf lasts a hundred years.\" My anger towards the woman who killed the president cannot be suppressed.\nEdgeworth: I, too, wish to capture the culprit. However... ...there is no doubt that the body appeared here last night. Therefore... the president could not have fallen to his death.\nKay: Yeah! He was crushed by the monster head!\nEdgeworth: The crime occurred here at the film lot, not on the rooftop of the Grand Tower.\nLang:\nLang: So, that's what you think. Still, I don't intend to stray from my logic either.\nEdgeworth: However, he could not have fallen to his death two nights ago. This photo proves that...\nLang: Is that so? Think about it this way... Two nights ago, Courtney pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body.\nEdgeworth: In here?\nLang: Wouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body. Once we search this area, we'll know where she hid the body.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: Unfortunately, there is no need for a search.\nLang: What'd you say!?\nEdgeworth: This piece of evidence proves that Judge Courtney could not have hidden the body!\nEdgeworth: All the entrances to the film lot were locked. The chain on the back entrance was only cut last night.\nLang: What!?\nEdgeworth: Therefore, Judge Courtney could not have entered the film lot two nights ago!\nLang: Aiyaaaaa! But the president could only have fallen two nights ago!\nEdgeworth: ...Why are you so insistent that the crime occurred two days ago?\nLang: Why...? Because there's still more to the security camera footage.\nLang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman. That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone. After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all! There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there? Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is!\nEdgeworth: The president never came down from the rooftop?\nLang: That's right. The security camera is always watching the entrance of the elevator. It was specifically set up to record anyone who entered or exited the rooftop. Essentially, the camera created a locked room... one which the president vanished from!\nEdgeworth: (A locked room... I see. This is quite an unfavorable piece of evidence for Judge Courtney...)\nSecurity Camera Photo data updated in my Organizer.\nKay: A rooftop escape! That's a difficult feat!\nEdgeworth: So even the Yatagarasu can't just fly through the sky.\nKay: That's right. I... I still need more training to be able to pull that off.\nEdgeworth: (Are you saying you're going to train yourself to fly?)\nLang: A photo was recorded 10–20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman.\nLang: That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone.\nLang: After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all!\nLang: There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there?\nLang: Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman, that is!\nEdgeworth: (A locked room created by the security camera... Is falling off the roof really the only way to escape this locked room?)\nEdgeworth: As a matter of fact, there was one. A hidden route... that is.\nLang: A way down without using the elevator!? You'd better not tell me he flew off or something!\nEdgeworth: There's no need for that. It's quite simple. The president just needed to know... ...about the existence of the hidden 51st floor.\nLang: The 51st floor?\nEdgeworth: This building has a hidden 51st floor. It is accessible through a secret hatch on the rooftop. Using that route, it would be possible to leave the rooftop without using the elevator.\nLang:\nLang: Hidden room? Secret hatch? How could the president have even known about that?\nEdgeworth: I wonder? I don't know the answer myself. I am merely raising a possibility.\nLang: In the first place, what's this all about? This hidden 51st floor. Sounds like something that ninja girl over there would love to get into!\nKay: No way! I'm sick of that place!\nEdgeworth: (For Kay, that place only holds bad memories, after all.) The 51st floor was a secret storeroom for the black market auction. Its true purpose was only exposed yesterday.\nLang: ...Black market auction? You... You aren't suggesting the president was involved in something like that, are you?\nEdgeworth: I have no proof. However, the possibility exists, does it not?\nKay: Hmm. I wouldn't put it past that president.\nLang: HOOOOOOOOOOWWWL!\nKay: Eek!\nLang: Impossible! The president would never...! He would never be involved in a black market auction!\nEdgeworth: (Wh... What's this?)\nLang: You punks. Are you prepared? If you're gonna spout nonsense like that... I'll tear you into pieces!\nKay: Eeeeeek!\nEdgeworth: (...She ran away.)\nLang: You don't have any idea! The amount of respect that man has earned from his country's people!\nEdgeworth: (I see... We have seen the president's true colors. However, the people of Zheng Fa remain in the dark... Should I inform Agent Lang of the president's true nature? No. Telling him now would only further cloud his judgment...) I understand, Agent Lang. Please calm down. We spoke out of line... I apologize.\nLang: ......Sorry. My emotions got the best of me. And Kay, how long do you plan on hiding? You can come out now.\nKay: ...I'm sorry.\nLang: ...It's fine. My anger is directed towards the president's killer.\nLotta: Well, I'll be! Yer actually a pretty good guy, ain't ya? That loyalty to yer president! It's mighty admirable!\nLang: Heh. What's it to you?\nLotta: Aww, don't be like that. I've got some good news for ya, I reckon.\nLang: What?\nLotta: The president ain't never passed through the 51st floor. Ya can count on me!\nLang: Really?\nLotta: I was in the storeroom myself, and I saw it with my very own eyes!\nEdgeworth: (That's right... She snuck into the storeroom that day.)\nLotta's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.\nLang: ...Thanks. ...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor.\nEdgeworth: What is it?\nLang: I don't intend to give the culprit a single step of leeway. No one's seen the president since he met with Courtney two days ago.\nEdgeworth: That doesn't change the fact that the body wasn't here yesterday. If he were pushed off two days ago, it would be odd that he wasn't found until yesterday. I doubt a fall from the rood would take a whole day.\nLang: I'll admit, there are a few things I still haven't figured out.\nEdgeworth: Regardless... there is one thing I am certain of.\nKay: There is?\nEdgeworth: What exactly occurred here last night? I'm certain we'll have to look into that in order to uncover the truth.\nKay: Because the body and the hoofprints could have only appeared last night, right?\nOfficer: Agent Lang! We'd like to bring the body in for the autopsy...\nLang: Huang..... It's in your hands. Make sure you show the proper respect.\nOfficer: I also have one more thing to report...\nLang: What is it?\nOfficer: We found some footprints near the body! Umm... They were left within the area that looks like a monster's footprint.\nEdgeworth: (There were human footprints within the monster's footprint?)\nLang: What kind of footprints?\nOfficer: Sir! They were the footprints of a child! About the size of an elementary school student!\nEdgeworth: What!?\nPenny: Huh!?\nKay: A-An elementary school student!? Wait... Could it be...?\nEdgeworth: (Who... was that?)\nPenny: U-Umm...!\nEdgeworth: (Ms. Nichols?)\nPenny: I... I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you! Please excuse my rudeness!\nEdgeworth: Is there something you want to say? (What is she so scared of?)\nPenny: I'm worried that you'll think poorly of me, but... ...please let me testify something! It's really important!\nEdgeworth: (That's not something you need to be so worried about...) What is it?\nPenny: Last night... I... I actually came here.\nLang: What!?\nPenny: Eek!\nEdgeworth: Why did you come here?\nPenny: ...Well, I got a little worried, so I stopped by... ...to check up on John.\nEdgeworth: John... You mean John Marsh? (As I thought...)\nPenny: Yes. Last night, umm... John stayed here late in order to practice by myself.\nKay: Wow! He's really dedicated!\nPenny: Well, this movie is the first time he's starring as the lead role, so... ...I'm sure he wants to do his best...!\nEdgeworth: (She must have witnessed something last night...) When was this?\nPenny: Umm... If I remember correctly, I think it was a little past 10 PM. It looked like it was going to rain, and I was getting worried, so I came to check up on him. And when I got here... Well... I, umm...\nLang: You... saw something?\nPenny: .....Y-Yes. John was practicing by himself... ...and right above his head... I saw... a long... long... neck.\nKay: A neck?\nPenny: Y-Yes! Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile... It was like... the neck of a dinosaur!\nLotta: Whooooooahhh there! C-Could that've been... ...G-G-Gourdy!? Last time I went huntin' for it, it was a bust... but I reckon, this could be the real deal!\nKay: What!? So this time it's Gourdy!?\nPenny: Th-That's right! I was really surprised! A-After all, John is the boy who can communicate with Moozilla!\nLotta: Yeah! That's right! Them horns of his lets him hear what the monster's sayin', right?\nPenny: E-Even so! He was looking up at Gourdy's face and he was talking to it! It was like they were friends! D-Doesn't that sound weird!?\nLotta: You said it, sister! That's pretty darn strange, I reckon! That boy's a little traitor!\nEdgeworth: (...It seems she's gotten reality mixed up with the movies...)\nLang: Hey, Missy... Did you really see that?\nPenny: Yes! But I was so shocked, I immediately ran home after that.\nLang: What do you make of this, Mr. Prosecutor? Has another monster taken the stage?\nEdgeworth: Agent Lang... Do you really believe this absurd testimony?\nLang: Hahahahaha! I couldn't care less about the monsters. However, it looks like who we need to talk to next has been decided now, hasn't it?\nEdgeworth: John Marsh... He was here last night. It's very likely he saw something... isn't it?\nLang: Atta boy!\nLang: John Marsh...! We've got some questions for you!\n................\nPenny: U-Umm... John kind of left a while ago.\nLang: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nKay: L-Let's go after him!\nLang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!?\nEdgeworth: He might have just gone back home.\nKay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today!\nLang: ...Or he may have run away.\nKay: A-Aren't you just overthinking things?\nEdgeworth: He's still a child. I can't imagine that he could have murdered the president by himself.\nLang: Who said he was alone? Maybe that monster helped him. That boy can summon a monster to his aid, right?\nEdgeworth: Hmph. Very funny.\nLang: I'm not saying that kid's definitely the culprit. But right now, he's the most prominent witness we have, So, we'll need to find that brat.\nGumshoe: Ah! Mr. Edgeworth!\nKay: Ah! Gummy!\nGumshoe: Uuugh... I, I... I...!\nKay: He ran away...\nEdgeworth: (What is the detective doing...?)\nLang: It doesn't matter... It's not like I can rely on this country's police anyways.\nEdgeworth: ...Agent Lang. Do you intend to continue investigating by yourself?\nLang: Yeah. That's right. You got a problem with that?\nKay: Didn't you always have a small army of subordinates with you before?\nLang: That's right... But, you know, being a lone wolf isn't all that bad. You don't have to worry about your subordinates or partners. All you need are your fangs. Simple, right?\nEdgeworth: (Subordinates... and partners...?)\nLang: Well then. I'll be seeing you two.\nLotta: He he he he. Things are gettin' interestin'! I reckon I'm about to get real busy myself! After all, I got me a pair of monsters to hunt! I'm definitely gettin' my hands on this scoop!\nKay: Things have gotten pretty crazy, haven't they?\nEdgeworth: Indeed. There's the footprints of Moozilla, and now the shadow of Gourdy... It's almost exactly like the movie.\nKay: How about we go monster hunting too?\nEdgeworth: Well... (Hm? Isn't that...?)\nKay: Isn't that one of Lang's men...?\nEdgeworth: (He's one of Agent Lang's subordinates. We met him during another case.) Excuse me...\nMIB: Oh, Prosecutor Edgeworth. It has been a while.\nKay: Shouldn't you be following Mr. Lang?\nMIB: Agent Lang... Shifu... is no longer my boss.\nEdgeworth: What exactly happened?\nMIB: Do you remember the incident from one month ago?\nEdgeworth: (The \"Yatagarasu Incident\" we had been involved with.)\nMIB: Agent Lang made a major mistake back then. He almost aided and abetted a dangerous criminal.\nEdgeworth: (Certainly... it had come quite close to that at the time.)\nMIB: Shifu took responsibility for what happened... and our team was disbanded.\nKay: Disbanded...?\nEdgeworth: So that's what Agent Lang was talking about when he said he had become a lone wolf.\nKay: Then... Why are you here?\nMIB: That's..... Well. I was a little worried about Shifu. ...It seems that even now, he's still chasing after them. The ghosts of 12 years past...\nEdgeworth: Ghosts of 12 years past? Just what are you...\nMIB: .......... I'm sorry. I've already said too much. If you'll excuse me...\nEdgeworth: (These ghosts Agent Lang is chasing after... Do they also have something to do with this case?)\nKay: Looks like everyone's left now... So, what do we do now?\nEdgeworth: Well... Ms. Hart is going after the monsters, and Agent Lang is going after John. We should also try approaching this case from a different angle.\nKay: What angle would that be?\nEdgeworth: ...We should listen to what Judge Courtney has to say.\nKay: Ah! That's right! If I'm not mistaken, Ms. Courtney is...\nCourtney: ...Well then, I shall take my leave here. I will be presiding over Patricia Roland's trial.\nKay: She said that she had a trial coming up!\nEdgeworth: Indeed. Let's head to the courthouse as well.\nKay: 'Kay!\nTo be continued.\nCourtney: Court is now in session. Is the defense ready?\nRay: Of course, Your Honor! We can begin whenever you want.\nFranziska: The prosecution has been ready from the start, Your Honor.\nEdgeworth: Jill Crane, the attorney in charge of the defense, has passed on from this world. Furthermore, Sebastian Debeste, the prosecutor-in-charge, has disappeared... And so, Franziska and Mr. Shields have taken over their duties.\nCourtney: Before we begin, I would like to apologize for the delay of today's trial. As the crime took place in the prison, a place where justice is normally administered... ...and the defendant was the warden of the prison, further exacerbating the situation... ...additional time was specially arranged to investigate and prepare for the trial. In addition, the defense attorney in charge of the case, Jill Crane, has recently passed away... Due to these circumstances, the trial was further delayed. Mr. Shields, Ms. von Karma. At this time, I'd like to give you my gratitude for taking up this responsibility on short notice.\nRay: I guess this is the last job Courtney-pie's friend left behind for us, huh? Well, Uncle Ray's more than happy to help out. Although having said that, I only had enough time to skim through the case files... Are you OK on your end, Franny-pie?\nFranziska: What kind of prosecutor abandons his own case and vanishes without a trace...!? I won't allow any more delays in this trial while we wait for that foolish man to return. I have received the evidence just now. There should be no problem continuing the trial.\nCourtney: ...You have my thanks. And with that, I hereby call the defendant, Patricia Roland, to the stand.\nRoland: ........\nCourtney: Now then, will the prosecution please give us their opening statement?\nFranziska: Very well, Your Honor. The defendant...\nRoland: ...Please wait, Your Honor.\nCourtney: What is it?\nRoland: Well, there's something I'd like you to fill me in on. Just what exactly... am I doing in a place like this?\nCourtney: Then perhaps... you would do well to listen to the opening statement.\nRoland: Hmm. So if I listen to it, I'll get it, huh? OK then, let's hear it.\nFranziska: ...That was the plan from the start. Now, if you would kindly shut up and listen. The incident occurred in the detention center and the prison Warden Roland is in charge of. The victim is Horace Knightley, who was being held in the detention center. The prosecution is certain that this woman here is the culprit. This knife, the murder weapon, is the decisive evi..... Huh!?\nCourtney: Ms. von Karma. Is something wrong?\nFranziska: Th-That's... impossible! The evidence is...!\nRay: What's wrong with the evidence, Franny-pie?\nFranziska: The evidence... the knife's gone! The chisel with Dogen's bell attached to it is missing too!\nRay: Wh... Whaaat!?\nCourtney: Order! Order! Prosecutor von Karma. What is the meaning of this?\nFranziska: I... I don't understand it either, Your Honor.\nRoland: If there's no evidence, then I suppose there's not much reason for me to be here. Some prosecutor. Can't even hold on to one little piece of evidence. What a dunce.\nFranziska: I... I only received everything that the previous prosecutor had... Ah!\nRay: ...It appears the culprit is that pampered prosecutor, the Boy Blunder. Hey, Courtney-pie.\nCourtney: What is it?\nRay: Your Honor! Considering our predicament, what say we postpone the trial until later?\nCourtney:\nCourtney: The defense's proposal is overruled.\nRay: Eh? Courtney-pie...?\nRoland: I know, right? It'd be troubling for me if this trial were to be delayed any further. I just want everyone to know that I'm innocent. As soon as possible.\nFranziska:\nFranziska: Innocent!? I've had more than enough of your foolish...\nRoland: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor?\nCourtney: .......... That is correct.\nFranziska: Eh!\nRay: What!?\nCourtney: The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Patricia Roland...\nRay:\nRay: Hold your horses, Courtney-pie! You can't just declare her innocent all of a sudden!\nCourtney: Is something the matter? For the defense to object to a \"not guilty\" verdict...\nRay: Well, I mean... Even you must know that the warden over there is guilty, right? You were there with us when we found the murder weapon!\nCourtney: ........ Mr. Shields. A judge must remain impartial when handing down a verdict. That is why I cannot allow myself to get caught up in my own personal feelings... The person who was present when the murder weapon was discovered... ...and the judge sitting before you now, are two completely different people.\nRay: ...You're kidding, right?\nCourtney: I can only hand down a verdict based upon the evidence that was presented.\nFranziska:\nFranziska: There is evidence! It's just... Well, it's not here right now, but... A few minutes, that's all I need! I'll find the evidence and return to court, without fail! The prosecution requests a brief recess, Your Honor!\nCourtney: ........\nRay: Th-The defense would also like a recess, Your Honor. Courtney-pie. Please...\nCourtney: ........ ...I understand. I shall grant your request.\nRoland: Well! Justine-darling! Aren't you wishy-washy today?\nCourtney: This court will now adjourn for a 15 minute recess! During with, the prosecution and the defense shall prepare for the resumption of the trial.\nFranziska: ...Understood, Your Honor.\nRay: Phew. That was a close one.\nCourtney: Court is now adjourned!\nKay: Didn't we find it together!? The evidence!\nEdgeworth: Yes, we certainly did.\nGumshoe: Huh?\nEdgeworth: What's the matter, Detective?\nGumshoe: It looks like the metal detector is reacting to this alligator.\nKay: Really! Why?\nEdgeworth: (Of course, that's why the metal detector reacted!) Judge Courtney, I'd like you to take a look at this.\nCourtney: The chisel...?\nDebeste: Wasn't that just the fake murder weapon?\nEdgeworth: Dogen hid this chisel inside this dog's mouth. And the real murder weapon was hidden in very much the same way...\nRoland: ...!\nEdgeworth: The real murder weapon is in the pond, inside the alligator!\nEdgeworth: I wonder if it was stolen by someone...\n???: Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth: Ms. Berry and Mr. Keyes. Did you come to attend the trial?\nRegina: I came because I heard there's a really fun show around here! So, where is it?\nSimon: The trial for the case I got caught up in was supposed to have already started, but... ..our practice ran a little late. I believe it was somewhere around here, wasn't it?\nKay: Actually, two key pieces of evidence have gone missing: the chisel and the knife... The trial is in recess now. Sort of like an intermission. You just missed it, Simon.\nSimon: Wha... Whaaaaaat!? Wh-wh-wh-what's that supposed to mean!?\nRegina: Ah ha ha! Looks like Simon's going to get arrested again!\nSimon: Eeeeeeeeeek! Nowaynowaynoway, I can't...!\nKay: Hmm. I guess Simon is his usual noisy self. ...Huh?\n???: To think that I would be humiliated like this!\nEdgeworth: ...And here comes another noisy individual.\nRay: Now, now, Franny-pie. Let's just take a moment and calm down a bit. Maybe you could put that whip of yours away, him? Whaddaya say?\nFranziska: That foolish prosecutor! When I get my hands on him... ...my whip is going to give him the thrashing of a lifetime!\nRay: Eek! Miles, why don't you try talking to her?\nEdgeworth: (Good grief... On that note, I guess I should probably hear what she has to say.)\n(Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Franziska and Ray leads to:)\nRay: If only there were someone who could go search for the evidence for us... ........\nEdgeworth: ........ .....Very well. I'll go look for them.\nRay: Oh! Miles! You'd do that for us?\nEdgeworth: Of course, finding the evidence within fifteen minutes will be no easy task.\nRay: Well, if worse comes to worst, Uncle Ray and Franny-pie will help you stall for time.\nFranziska: ..........\nRay: Until you recover the evidence, we won't let her hand down a verdict.\nEdgeworth: Please do so. ...Franziska, are you OK with this?\nFranziska: .....You're asking me, Franziska von Karma, to help you out? You'd be better off spending the rest of your life as an anchorman for the local news...\nRay: Ms. von Karma. This is an emergency. We could really use your cooperation.\nFranziska: ! Hmph... I understand. As acting prosecutor, I, along with that attorney over there, shall continue this trial. Meanwhile, you, the \"former\" prosecutor shall run around and look for the evidence... ...all for my sake. It's a job that suits you perfectly!\nEdgeworth: ...I'm glad that you're on board.\nSimon: I-I'll help out too! ...'Cause I really don't wanna get arrested again.\nRegina: This sounds like fun! Regina wants to tag along too!\nEdgeworth: Alright. That would be helpful. Now then, where should we begin?\nKay: I think we should go find that person, and hear what they have to say!\nEdgeworth: Who should we talk to in order to learn where the evidence went?\nEdgeworth: Yes. The person in charge of the evidence was Sebastian Debeste.\nSimon: Ah, you mean that rookie prosecutor, right? Got it!\nEdgeworth: I'll leave him to you.\nRay: Alright. Time for Uncle Ray to have a strategy meeting with the opposing counsel. ...Just the two of uUUAAAGH!\nFranziska: Miles Edgeworth... You better not keep me waiting. Lest you end up like your friend here.\nEdgeworth: Yes.... I'll keep that in mind.\nRay: Franny-pie, wait for meeeee!\nEdgeworth: Now then, let's go help look for Sebastian as well.\nKay: Ah!\nEdgeworth: (Judge Courtney...)\nCourtney: ...If it isn't Prosecutor Edgeworth. I hope that all is well.\nKay: All is NOT well! Just what was going on in that trial earlier...?\nEdgeworth: Kay! There's no need for that.\nKay: But...! Even though Ms. Courtney should know exactly who the culprit is... What made you...?\nCourtney: ........ In a court of law, the only thing that truly matters is evidence... Whatever my own feelings may be, it should not affect the verdict.\nEdgeworth: So, is this the \"Judge persona\" of Justine Courtney we're seeing?\nCourtney: Cold-blooded and heartless... It's fine if you think of me as such.\nEdgeworth: (Even as a judge, she's still this stubborn?) Judge Courtney. There's just... one thing I'd like to ask you.\nCourtney: And what would that be?\nEdgeworth: Two nights ago... you went to the roof of the Grand Tower.\nCourtney: ! The roof... you say?\nEdgeworth: You met with the president there, correct? The two of you were caught on the security camera.\nCourtney: Is there some sort of problem with that?\nEdgeworth: Today... The president's body was discovered. Very close to the Grand Tower.\nCourtney: Th-That's...!\nEdgeworth: You understand now, don't you? You're a suspect. ...What happened between you and the president up on the roof?\nCourtney: Nothing... We merely spoke for a few minutes. Once our business was done, I headed straight home. I took the elevator back down alone.\nEdgeworth: Indeed. That was shown on the security camera footage as well. What exactly did you and the president talk about?\nCourtney: Th-That... I cannot say.\nEdgeworth: (I see. However, I cannot afford to let up just yet. That being the case... Heh. I guess my only remaining options is to use that. She is definitely hiding something...! And I'm going to draw it out of her!)\nEdgeworth: Two nights ago, Judge Courtney met with President Huang...\nCourtney: ........\nCourtney: ...It is true that I spoke with President Huang on the roof of the Grand Tower. However, we only discussed business. There is no need to tell you what was said.\nEdgeworth: Hmm... Just like in the trial earlier, she won't reveal her personal feelings easily. When she's speaking as a judge, it would be better for me to wait and see what develops. Now then, I'll start by asking her what she talked about with the president!\nEdgeworth: Could you tell me... what you and the president talked about?\nCourtney: My meeting with the president was strictly business. And since it has nothing to do with you, I am not obligated to answer your question.\nEdgeworth: ......\nCourtney: I appreciate your understanding.\nEdgeworth: Even so... You certainly are a very busy person, aren't you? You're a member of the P.I.C. and a judge as well. You even assist with the investigations.\nCourtney: I am simply fulfilling the professional duties that have been assigned to me.\nEdgeworth: Was your meeting with the president also one of the duties assigned to you as a judge?\nCourtney: .....Yes. Of course it was. I... am one who lives for the law. I would never act outside my professional duties.\nEdgeworth: This morning, you returned Kay's \"promise notebook\" to me. I don't believe that all of yours actions are simply done for the sake of your duties.\nCourtney: .....It's true, it seems I still retain some immature qualities.\nEdgeworth: I wouldn't call it immature. It was your own personal kindness. Weren't you also distressed when you found out the president had passed away?\nCourtney: Yes... It is very unfortunate... Why did he have to die...?\nEdgeworth: It seems he was crushed by the head of a monster called the \"Mighty Moozilla\". Ah... Excuse me. You see, Moozilla is...\nCourtney: I-Is that true!? You mean... the president died at the temporary Moozilla film lot...?\nEdgeworth: Yes. That's right... I'm surprised that you know about Moozilla.\nCourtney: Y-Yes... I had heard about it from Sebastian. He told me that the movie was being filmed near the Grand Tower...\nEdgeworth: ...She seems awfully shaken up about that. And I'm also curious about Sebastian, who went missing along with the evidence. She said she wouldn't talk about the president... However, I might be able to get her to reveal her secret through another line of questioning. She is flustered beyond normal. There must be some reason behind it!\nEdgeworth: Franziska may have taken over the prosecution in Sebastian's place, however... ...as long as he still possesses some of the evidence, the trial cannot proceed.\nCourtney: I intend to carry out a fair trial. If the prosecution is unable to present evidence... the defendant must be declared not guilty.\nEdgeworth: ......\nCourtney: I am a judge. I cannot allow my own personal feelings to get in the way.\nEdgeworth: So, you're saying you're not the least bit worried about Sebastian's whereabouts?\nCourtney: Of course... I am... I am worried about Sebastian, as well, but...\nEdgeworth: You're worried about Sebastian \"as well\"? Wouldn't that mean... ...that there is someone else you're worried about?\nCourtney: Ah...!\nEdgeworth: By any chance... would that person have something to do with your unnatural behavior?\nCourtney: ...That's impossible. I... ...I am a follower of the law... I will not... be swayed by... personal feelings.\nEdgeworth: It may be true that those who stand in court have a duty to follow the law. However, we're not superheroes! You and I are only human. It is impossible to completely ignore your own feelings and render an impartial judgement!\nCourtney: Aaaaaaah! .....It is as you say. As I am now... I cannot hand down an impartial verdict.\nEdgeworth: Judge Courtney. Why don't you tell me the truth?\nCourtney: I... I...! Just what am I supposed to do...!?\nEdgeworth: For Judge Courtney to become this distraught... I should find out exactly who she is searching for. Up until now, she has been wearing the mask of a judge... This time, I should be able to draw out her true feelings!\nEdgeworth: Let me try using that clue...\nEdgeworth: Earlier, when Moozilla was brought up, it seemed to be a sensitive topic for you... Is that \"child\" you spoke of involved with the Moozilla movie?\nCourtney: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! H-How!? How do you know that...!?\nEdgeworth: You're usually so calm, yet you seem rather distraught right now. Please, tell me... Who is that child!?\nCourtney: ...I understand. If you've come to know this much... I shall prepare myself for the worst. The child I'm searching for... is a boy by the name of John Marsh.\nEdgeworth: John...? Why do you want to know his whereabouts?\nCourtney: Well... That much, I simply cannot say...\nEdgeworth: Judge Courtney. Didn't you say you were prepared for the worst!?\nCourtney: .....!\nEdgeworth: Even if you don't intend to talk, I am determined to expose the truth. ...That is my resolve. Why is she searching for John... I must get her to tell me the reason.\nEdgeworth: Let me try using that clue...\nEdgeworth: I don't know what kind of relationship you have with John... ...but at the very least, the two of you must be acquaintances!\nCourtney: E... Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nEdgeworth: Judge Courtney. Won't you allow us to help you in your search for him?\nCourtney: Help...? No, that won't be allowed?\nEdgeworth: Who won't allow it? The so-called Goddess of Law?\nCourtney: ...The person who knows where that child is..\nEdgeworth: I see... Finally, I've connected all the pieces of the puzzle. The reason why you cannot easily talk about John... It was because... Someone kidnapped him, isn't that right?\nCourtney: A-Aah... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nEdgeworth: ...Judge Courtney. I would like to hear the truth from your own lips.\nCourtney: .....I understand. This time... I will truly be prepared for the worst. It is just as you deduced... Someone has kidnapped John.\nEdgeworth: ! As I thought... There was a kidnapping! Still, how is John's kidnapping related to you in any way?\nCourtney: ......John and I are... ...mother and child...\nEdgeworth: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? I was unable to learn much about the conversation she had with the president, but... ...I have learned of John's kidnapping. ...It was an unexpected result, but with that... it's checkmate.\nCourtney: .......\nKay: Whaaat!? J-John is... Ms. Courtney's son!? No way! I mean, he's already so big, for him to be your...\nCourtney: Yes... John is indeed my son. Please look at this...\nEdgeworth: (This is a clipping from a magazine...)\nKay: It's an article about John! Do you always carry this around with you?\nCourtney: Yes. I always keep it close by. It's like a charm to me...\nEdgeworth: (It seems the bond that they share is a strong one.)\nCourtney: .......\nEdgeworth: However, are you absolutely certain that he's been kidnapped?\nCourtney: Yes. I received a call from the kidnapper just before the trial started...\nEdgeworth: What were their demands?\nCourtney: They had only one demand. A \"Not Guilty\" verdict for Patricia Roland...\nEdgeworth: (I see. So that's what happened...)\nRoland: And, besides. You don't have any evidence, right? I recall a certain saying... \"In court, evidence is everything.\" Wasn't it? Since there's no evidence, that would make me innocent. Isn't that right, Your Honor?\nCourtney: .......... That is correct. The prosecution has not produced sufficient evidence to prove the defendant guilty. As such, I hereby find the defendant, Patricia Roland...\nEdgeworth: So, that's why you were going to deliver a \"Not Guilty\" verdict earlier?\nCourtney: I am... not qualified to be a judge... A judge must be able to remain impartial and composed, above all else. And yet... despite this, in the trial just now, I... ...I was about to hand down a verdict that was led solely by my heart!\nEdgeworth: .....Judge Courtney.\nCourtney: The Goddess of Law must be furious with me... ...but, I simply couldn't do it. I couldn't hand down a fair verdict... if it meant I had to sacrifice my own son!\nKay: Of course you can't!\nEdgeworth: (Kay...)\nKay: A real parent... would never abandon their own child! If that makes the Goddess of Law angry, then maybe the Goddess is the one who's wrong! The Goddess is guilty! Guilty! Isn't that right, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth: Indeed. (To declare a goddess guilty...) We're responsible for upholding the law, but at the same time, we are only human. Nobody would hand down a verdict that would sacrifice their own child.\nCourtney: .....Thank you very much. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth. However... I cannot simply run away from the courtroom.\nBailiff: Judge Courtney! So this is where you've been.\nCourtney: It appears it's time...\nKay: .......... Ms. Courtney! ...My father, he was a prosecutor.\nCourtney: Your father...?\nKay: Yes. He stood in court, just like you. ...And now, with all that has happened, it got me thinking... What if, my father had been in the same position as you are now?\nCourtney: If a prosecutor was being coerced into obtaining a guilty verdict...\nKay: I know... if my life were on the line, my father... ...would definitely come to steal me back!\nCourtney: Steal you... back?\nKay: Ms. Courtney. Why don't you let us take care of it?\nCourtney: What...?\nKay: I'm gonna go steal John back for you! As the second Yatagarasu, I, Kay Faraday, give you my word!\nCourtney: ......\nEdgeworth: (Heh. So, the Great Thief Yatagarasu plans to steal the \"truth\", huh...) What say you, Judge Courtney? Will you place your trust in our young Great Thief?\nCourtney: Prosecutor Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth: And, if it's alright with you, I wish to help as well.\nCourtney: .....Thank you very much. I know that it's really not my place to ask this of you... ...but please... do whatever you can... Please save John.\nKay: You got it! Just leave everything to us!\nCourtney: Allow me to leave my cellphone with you. You may get a call from the kidnapper at some point.\nEdgeworth: You have my word. I will ensure the safe return of your phone, alone with your son.\nCourtney: And I will do everything in my power to prolong the trial. But... even then, at most the trial can only last for about two more hours...\nEdgeworth: (Two hours, huh... So, until 2 PM. That's our time frame...)\nCourtney: ...I must return to court. Ms. Faraday, Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall leave the rest to you.\nEdgeworth: Heh. Kay, I thought you were taking a break from being the Great Thief?\nKay: As of right now, the Great Thief Yatagarasu is back in business! Alright! Time to put on the gloves and hit the pavement! It's my first request, after all!\nEdgeworth: Is that so? In that case, we'd better begin our investigation posthaste... ...if we hope to track down John...\nLang: Tch! Where'd he run off to!?\nEdgeworth: He might have just gone back home.\nKay: That's right! I mean, it doesn't look like they're going to get any filming done today!\nLang: ...Or he may have run away.\nEdgeworth: We should probably begin our investigation from the front of the Grand Tower.\nKay: H-Hey! Hold it, Mr. Edgeworth! You're not the one in charge anymore! From here on out, this is a job for a Great Thief! Which means, I'm the leader now!\nEdgeworth: ...If that's the case, then what am I supposed to do?\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth, you get to be... the first ever Great Thief's Assistant!\nEdgeworth: (So, I'm a thief's assistant now...?)\nKay: Alright! Let's get going! The Great Thief Yatagarasu takes flight once again!\nKay: Here we are! The scene of the crime! Let's get to work! Now, say it with me, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth: Hm? Say what?\nKay: \"Even in the depths of night...\"\nEdgeworth: ..........\nKay: Aww, come on! Say the rest with me!\nEdgeworth: And just why should I do that!?\nKay: Because! The Great Thief Yatagarasu has arrived on the scene! If we don't say the introduction, it just doesn't feel right!\nEdgeworth: I have no intention of becoming a thief.\nKay: Aargh! Fine, then. I'll do it by myself! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu!\nEdgeworth: Yes, Kay. I know you are. I, on the other hand, am starting the investigation.\nKay: Tch. You're no fun.\nEdgeworth: ...We don't have time for \"fun\". We only have until 2 o'clock. We need to begin making inquiries immediately.\nKay: Good thing we have a photo, so we can go right ahead and start asking around!\n(Examining trailer after clearing all \"Talk\" options of Powers, blue truck, taxi, and film equipment and talking with officer leads to:)\nEdgeworth: (Hmm. It's already half past 12...)\nKay: I wonder how Ms. Courtney and the others are holding up...\nEdgeworth: How long will they be able to prolong the trial...?\nKay: We gotta hurry and find John!\nEdgeworth: Indeed.\nLotta: Aww heck naw! That ain't how it's done! Ya ain't gonna catch a scoop like that!\nNicole: S-Sorry, Chief!\nLotta: What am I always tellin' ya!? We're beasts! Scoop-eatin' animals! It's scoop or starve! No story, no glory! Ya gotta get fired up!\nNicole: Yessir! As expected of my mentor!\nEdgeworth: They're here... (It's those noisy reporters.)\nKay: Hey, they came here too! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go talk to them!\nEdgeworth: ...Good grief. If we must.\nEdgeworth: What if the kidnappers stole the box?\nKay: Ah! You mean they...!\nEdgeworth: Exactly. They took it in order to carry John inside it.\nKay: John's a tiny kid, after all. Then, the reason the taxi driver didn't see John was because...\nEdgeworth: It's likely he was put in the trunk as the kidnapper's luggage.\nKay: But, why did they need to go through all the trouble of hiding him?\nEdgeworth: At first, the kidnappers must have intended to abduct him without being seen. However, they didn't anticipate all the policemen in the plaza.\nKay: Ah, I see. If they tried to just walk away with him, they would've been spotted...\nEdgeworth: Just the mere presence of policemen would have been a sizable threat.\nKay: I geddit! In that case, we've gotta ask the taxi driver!\nEdgeworth: Did the two men you told us about earlier have any luggage with them?\nDriver: Yeah. They stuffed a huge box into the trunk.\nKay: Then that's that! Those guys must be the kidnappers!\nEdgeworth: Do you remember where you took those men?\nDriver: Sounds to me like something serious has gone down here... If you'd like, I could take you to the same place I took them.\nKay: Let's do it, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth: Yes. Thank you for your help.\nDriver: No problemo! Just leave it to me!\nKay: Uugh... That taxi drove way too fast. I don't feel too good.\nEdgeworth: ........\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth, are you alright? Your face is really pale.\nEdgeworth: I-I'm fine. The driver said they came to this house's garage...\nKay: This must be where those two men brought the box! ...Ah! Mr. Edgeworth! Look at the nameplate on the door!\nEdgeworth: Nameplate...? What!? \"Blaise Debeste\"!?\nKay: So this is... the chairman's house!\nEdgeworth: (Does that mean the one who kidnapped John was Blaise Debeste? Blaise should have already been arrested though...)\nKay: Ah! The garage door is unlocked!\nEdgeworth: You really do have a good eye for this sort of thing...\nEdgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.)\nKay: Excuse me... we're coming in... Anybody home?\nEdgeworth: Doing something like this, it's as if we're a couple of petty thieves...!\nKay: Shh! Be quiet! Right now, we're Great Thieves! Have some self-awareness!\nEdgeworth: (...She scolded me.) Nobody's here... For now, it looks like we can get through this without being arrested.\nKay: This isn't the time to be relieved! Now the real deal begins! Let's go look for treasure!\nEdgeworth: (We are looking for John, not treasure...)\n(Examining the \"Cement bag\", \"Shovel and sledgehammer\", \"Gloves\" and \"Green box\" leads to:)\n???: ...*thump, thump*...\nEdgeworth: Hm?\nKay: Th-There's someone inside!\n???: ...*thump, thump*... *thump, thump*... *CRASH*!\nEdgeworth: Is it... John...?\nKay: John! We're coming to save you! ......Eh?\nEdgeworth: (Th-This is...!) You're..... S-Sebastian!\nKay: Whaaaaat!? Why!?\nDebeste: Nnnnf, Nmmnnnmmf!\nKay: This is Blaise's house, right? That would mean...\nEdgeworth: Yes. It should also be Sebastian's house. (So then, why is he...?) Kay, go help him out.\nKay: If it has to do with ropes, just leave it to Kay! Here I go! A little pull over here, and a quick tug over there! Are you alright, Sebastian?\nDebeste: ..........\nEdgeworth: (He looks a little worse for wear.) Why were you tied up in a place like this?\nDebeste: .....How should I know!? Y-You guys don't know anything about me!\nEdgeworth: .....It's because we don't know. That's why we're asking you...\nDebeste: ..........\nKay: He's completely shut off his heart...\nEdgeworth: Indeed... If it's come to this... ...I suppose I have no choice but to use that.\nKay: Ah! You mean!\nEdgeworth: I hate to do this when he's in such a fragile state. It's like kicking a man who's down...\nKay: ...Will it be alright? His mind might break if you corner him too much, y'know?\nEdgeworth: Yes. I am aware of that. I will try to be careful. (Good grief. I wonder how this will turn out... I've never held back against anyone before...)\nEdgeworth: After running out of the meeting room this morning, why would he be here of all places...?\nDebeste: You guys... You don't know how I feel!\nEdgeworth: (He's gone through a lot of shock. He must be on the verge of an emotional meltdown.) It can't be helped... At times like this, I must quietly listen to what he has to say.\nDebeste: N-No one tells me anything... I'm always the only one being left out like an idiot...!\nEdgeworth: (Hmm... I should try to answer his questions as best as I can.) Considering how fragile he is... I won't have much time to spare. I'll need to ask about his true feelings, and try to calm him down posthaste!\nEdgeworth: Could you please tell me what's on your mind?\nDebeste: I... I don't wanna! It's not like you'd listen to me anyways!\nEdgeworth: .....\nDebeste: Wh-What's wrong? Normally, you'd be shouting \"Objection!\" right about now!\nEdgeworth: .....\nDebeste: ...You're serious? Y-You're really... gonna listen to what I have to say?\nEdgeworth: I can understand... the shock you went through after what happened with your father.\nDebeste: It wasn't just Pops. This morning, I... I lost everything!\nEdgeworth: ......\nDebeste: E-Everything I have... was given to me by Pops... T-Tell me, Mr. Edgeworth... Just what am I supposed to believe in...?\nEdgeworth: If you can't believe in others, then at least believe in yourself. You'll need to gain experience on your own, but if you require wisdom, I can lend you a hand.\nDebeste: ! ...Ever since I got locked up, I've been thinking... ...am I too inculpable to be a prosecutor... uh? Incapable...? Erm, which one was it?\nEdgeworth: I believe \"incapable\" is the word you are looking for. Judging your own ability is not an easy task. Sebastian. Little by little, you are growing.\nDebeste: !\nEdgeworth: Sebastian. Would you tell me your side of the story?\nDebeste: .....I-I understand. What... should I talk about?\nEdgeworth: Hmm. He seems to have calmed down slightly. I'd like you to tell me everything you know about the kidnappers. Now then... Tell me what you heard and saw!\nEdgeworth: Let me try using that clue...\nEdgeworth: Kidnapping his own son in order to demand a ransom wouldn't make such sense.\nDebeste: .....Y-Yeah, you're right!\nEdgeworth: Did you notice anything strange when you got kidnapped?\nDebeste: Oooh... As soon as I answered their question, they just took me away...\nEdgeworth: They asked you a question...? Tell me what they asked you!\nDebeste: Waaah! D-Don't glare at me like that... Erm... I think they asked me, \"Do you know Courtney?\"\nEdgeworth: ! I see.. The pieces of the puzzle are starting to fall into place. Blaise... and the kidnappers did not intend to kidnap you. Their objective was John Marsh. They were planning to kidnap Judge Courtney's son... ...in order to have Patricia Roland declared not guilty!\nDebeste: J-Justine has a son...? And Warden Roland gets declared not guilty...?\nEdgeworth: I suspect... the kidnappers mistook you for John Marsh.\nDebeste: A-All of this... was just a mistake? ! Wait... maybe that's why, back then...!\nEdgeworth: Hm...? Did you just remember something?\nDebeste: N-No..... It's nothing! I'm useless anyways... Just... leave me alone already!\nEdgeworth: Th-This is bad! He might be at his emotional limit...! I must get him to tell me what he remembered, and try to calm him down as well. Based on how distressed Sebastian looks right now... ...it must have been quite traumatic. I'll need to help him get back on his feet!\nEdgeworth: What did you remember just now?\nDebeste: I-I didn't remember anything... about Po... that guy...\nEdgeworth: Would \"that guy\" happen to be Blaise?\nDebeste: D-Darniiiiiit! Oooh... So this is the difference between me and someone who earned his Prosecutor title...\nEdgeworth: ...I've been waiting to ask you: Why did you become a prosecutor?\nDebeste: What does it matter!? I'm not fit to be a prosecutor anyways!\nEdgeworth: ......\nDebeste: S-Say something!\nEdgeworth: You must have some reason for choosing this path, right?\nDebeste: ...N-No, it's not like that! It wasn't anything special! I became a prosecutor for a really insignificant reason!\nEdgeworth: ......\nDebeste: It was just... a personal reason.\nEdgeworth: Heh... Just like you, I, too, became a prosecutor for a personal reason.\nDebeste: Huh...? I-Is that true...? B-But... you're a really successful prosecutor... I'm sure that Pops... the P.I.C. chairman... would have been more proud of you than me.\nEdgeworth: I see... so, you wanted your father's approval.\nDebeste: Ooh.....! I thought that if I became the best prosecutor, he'd be proud of me! That's why I...! I just wanted to help out Pops as much as I could......!\nEdgeworth: Would you... happen to be protecting your father?\nDebeste: Wha... I-I don't have any reason to protect someone like him...!\nEdgeworth: Didn't you want to help out your father... as much as you could?\nDebeste: Uuuuuunngh... Just once... I only wanted to be useful to Pops just this once! That way... I could help him regain his repetition!\nEdgeworth: You seem to be mixing up your words again... The word you're looking for is \"reputation\".\nDebeste: Huh? N-No one's ever told me that before!\nEdgeworth: Your father, who has strayed from his path, continues to add to his crimes... Even knowing that, do you truly want things to stay the way they are?\nDebeste: But... in that case, just what am I supposed to do?\nEdgeworth: You should triumph over your father, who has treated you like a fool. You must stop Blaise before he commits another crime!\nDebeste: ! I never thought of it that way. I... I want to triumph over Pops!\nEdgeworth: ...Somehow, it seems he has calmed down once again. Now's my chance to ask him about Blaise's secret! I will give Sebastian the courage to stand up to his father!\nEdgeworth: Hmm... He seems to have become unsettled again. I suppose I should lend him a hand...\nEdgeworth: The place you thought would be the safest... Would that have been in Blaise Debeste's hands?\nDebeste: Ungh... Waaaaaahhh! H-He told me that it would be safer if he took care of the evidence!\nEdgeworth: I'm sorry... but he has betrayed your trust in the worst way possible.\nDebeste: Pops... why would he want to hide the evidence...?\nEdgeworth: Blaise's objective was to have Warden Roland found not guilty, by obscuring the truth... Sebastian. You... were used by your father!\nDebeste: Ungh... Uwaaaaaaah!\nEdgeworth: It's possible that Blaise Debeste has the evidence with him. Furthermore, we still have no idea where John is. I must return to my investigation posthaste, however...\nDebeste: This... This is all my fault...! What am I gonna do now...!?\nEdgeworth: ...Seeing him like this, I can't just leave him be. He is still suffering in the gap between his ideal and reality. He will never move on until he figures out how to live his own life! Sebastian is about to face his greatest trial. Perhaps this is fate. I shall give him the push forward that he needs.\nEdgeworth: For goodness' sake... Don't you remember your own words? Perhaps his \"own will\" can show him the way.\nEdgeworth: As a prosecutor... didn't you want to walk a different path from your father? Certainly, the path you have chosen is not an easy one. Nevertheless, you still chose to live as a prosecutor. In that case, it should be clear to you what you need to do...!\nDebeste: !\nEdgeworth: ...I still question how I live my life to this day. But you, Sebastian... have found your own answer. So believe in yourself, Prosecutor Debeste!\nDebeste: I... WAAAAAAAAAAH!\nEdgeworth: (He was mistaken for John, and kidnapped by Blaise's underlings. And after his father stole his evidence, he lost his confidence as a prosecutor... The emotions he is going through must be more painful than anything I could imagine.) It's taken longer than I thought... but with that, it's checkmate.\nDebeste: U-unh, uugh... ungh...! D... D-D-D-D... DARN IIIIIIIIIIIT!\nEdgeworth: ..........\nKay: H-He dashed out of here at full speed...\nEdgeworth: (It seems if there's one thing he's \"the best\" at, it's running away...)\nEdgeworth: (Curses! We're running out of time...) We should check in with Mr. Shields. (I'd also like to know what the situation is like on their end.)\nKay: But Mr. Debeste ran off again...\nEdgeworth: We'll just give them the new information we discovered. Franziska will take his place.\nKay: Hmm... I wonder if that's going to be enough...\nEdgeworth: It can't be helped. Since he ran away, there's nothing more we can do.\nDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 3\nRay: Eerm. I guess I'll just say it again. If there's no murder weapon, you can't prove the defendant is guilty.\nFranziska:\nFranziska: Just because we don't have the murder weapon, doesn't mean the defendant is innocent! It seems you wish to taste the sting of my whip.\nRay: Gyaaah!\nRoland: Mr. Attorney. This trial... How much longer will it take? Because it feels like it hasn't gone anywhere at all for a good while now!\nRay: Well, sorry, but that stubborn prosecutor over there just doesn't seem to understand.\nFranziska: Until I am satisfied... ...this whip will lash out at you as many times as I see fit.\nRay: (By now, she's probably whipped me once for every year I've been alive... Miles... What's taking you so long? Even though we're just stalling for time, Uncle Ray can't keep this up much longer!) Whoops, 'scuse me. Phone call. Mind if I take this?\nCourtney: ...I will allow it.\nEdgeworth: Mr. Shields.\nRay: Oh, Miles, it's you. How's it going over there?\nEdgeworth: We found Sebastian.\nRay: Oh! And the knife and chisel?\nEdgeworth: It seems he handed the evidence over to Blaise Debeste. It's very likely that Blaise knows the whereabouts of the murder weapon.\nRay: Ex-chairman Debeste!? But, why would Blaise...?\nEdgeworth: That, I don't know yet. However, there may be some hidden connection between... ...Patricia Roland and Blaise.\nRay: Gotcha. In that case, I'll issue a subpoena for Blaise Debeste right away.\nEdgeworth: !\nRay: I'll grill him personally.\nEdgeworth: I will continue to search for the missing evidence. (And for John, as well...)\nRay: Try to hurry it up, would ya? We're at our wits end over here! It feels like the verdict could be handed down at any moment!\nEdgeworth: Understood. (How much longer can Judge Courtney's heart hold out? I know she's in a lot of pain... I've got to hurry.)\nOutside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza\nKay: So? How's the trial going?\nEdgeworth: Blaise will be taking the stand. I don't know how things will turn out, though.\nKay: He'll do anything, from hiding evidence to kidnapping... He really is nothing but trouble.\nEdgeworth: I agree. We should probably take another look at the evidence concerning him.\nKay: OK! Leave it to me! First, here's the latest evidence fresh from the scene!\nEdgeworth: They're... the gloves from earlier. Although I am certainly curious about them... Anything else?\nKay: The case files from the IS-7 Incident. If I recall, Blaise was also involved in this, right?\nEdgeworth: Indeed. He was involved in destroying the evidence. For now, let's keep this on hand.\nIS-7 Incident Documents jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth: Now then... is there anything else?\nKay: Of course! Last but not least... We've got this!\nEdgeworth: This is... the Yatagarasu's badge. ...Kay. I'm talking about things related to Blaise. Please be serious.\nKay: But aren't you always going around presenting random evidence too, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth: Gah...! No... W-Well... That's... Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?)\nKay: Ah! What're you doing here?\nDebeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH!\nKay: H-He ignored us...\nEdgeworth: (He came out of the Grand Tower... What was he doing in there?)\nKay: Let's go investigate what Mr. Debeste was up to!\nEdgeworth: Yes... Let us go.\nGrand Tower - Rooftop\nEdgeworth: Hm? (The hatch is open...)\nKay: It might be Mr. Debeste who opened it!\nGrand Tower - 51st Floor Storeroom\nEdgeworth: (Did Sebastian come in here...?)\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth! Over there! The safe's open!\nEdgeworth: (Did he come here to open that? ...Let's examine it thoroughly.)\nKay: There's something inside the safe!\nEdgeworth: Let's go ahead and have a look. There are some documents in here...\nKay: Hmm... it's just a bunch of papers and... huh? There's a photo here too.\nEdgeworth: Hm? This is a picture of...!\nKay: Huh!? Th-That's Mr. Knightley!\nKnightley: ...Horace Knightley. The president's bodyguard.\nKay: Why is his picture here? And what are all of these papers for!?\nEdgeworth: I don't know... We will have to read the documents to find out.\nI'm all but certain there is a connection between Knightley and Dogen. Dogen's chess partner, whose identity remained unknown until now... ...was actually Knightley all along. That is proof enough. Tomorrow, I shall interrogate him in the warden's office. I'll get him to confess that he's one of Dogen's henchmen. That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago... ...you simply must retrieve it.\nEdgeworth: This... seems to be a report about Knightley.\nKay: Not to mention, it was apparently written before Knightley was killed...!\nEdgeworth: (Horace Knightley was murdered while he was being interrogated in the warden's office...) Judging from the contents, this document was probably written by Patricia Roland.\nKay: I knew it!\nEdgeworth: The question, however, is who this report was addressed to.\nKay: Ah! The owner of this safe is...!\nEdgeworth: The Conductor... Blaise Debeste.\nKay: So, this proves that Ms. Roland and Blaise are connected!\nEdgeworth: Indeed. However, it's not just the two of them.\nKay: Huh?\nEdgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Patricia Roland were searching for Dogen's henchmen.\nKay: Sirhan Dogen! That dog-loving assassin!\nEdgeworth: This means that there is a hidden connection between the three of them.\nKay: I wonder what it could be?\nEdgeworth: I don't know, but it must be related to this case.\nReport on Knightley jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay: Ah! There's some other stuff in here that I remember seeing!\nEdgeworth: Hm? There's something on his finger.\nKay: Let's have a closer look! Oh! It looks like an expensive ring!\nEdgeworth: Don't steal it.\nKay: Wha...! I didn't do anything yet!\nEdgeworth: It's Horace Knightley's... The chessboard and the ring... All of his possessions are inside this safe.\nKay: So basically, all of this stuff is evidence from the prison case?\nEdgeworth: Correct.\nKay: Then, the knife and chisel that vanished might be in here too! Let's see. Mr. Knife... Mr. Chisel... Hmm. They're not in there... I guess this is all just Mr. Knightley's stuff.\nEdgeworth: I see... That's too bad. (Horace Knightley... is dead.)\nKnightley: EEEEEDGEWOOOOOORTH!!! This game isn't over yet! You hear me! I...! I...!\nEdgeworth: (However, the game is not over yet... ...unless I can see it through to its end!)\nKnightley's Mementos data jotted down in my Organizer.\nGrand Tower - Rooftop\n???: Young lady, good sir. ...Might I interest you in some cotton candy?\nEdgeworth: Hm?\n???: There is also ice cream, if that is what you'd prefer?\nEdgeworth: Y-You! Sh-Shelly de Killer!\nde Killer: It's good to see you are well, Mr. Edgeworth.\nKay: Wh-What are you doing in a place like this!?\nde Killer: As you can see, I am selling cotton candy. Would you care for some \"Heavenly Cotton Candy\"? Even sweeter than death. One bite will send you straight to heaven.\nEdgeworth: (That's definitely not something I'd want to buy from De Killer.)\nde Killer: The meaning of my message... Have you understood it?\nde Killer: I congratulate you on resolving the case. However... ...can you truly say in good conscience that it has been solved?\nEdgeworth: Have you been spying on us this whole time?\nde Killer: Spying? Heavens no. I was simply watching over you... ...while disguised as a cotton candy salesman.\nEdgeworth: (Isn't that the exact same thing!? What is this man's objective?) Were you the one... who murdered the president?\nde Killer: No. The contact with my client has already expired. ...President Huang is a bit of a celebrity in the world of assassins, you see. Over the years, many attempts on his life were made, and yet, he stubbornly lives on. He is a robust man, surrounded by flawless security. He even employs body doubles.\nEdgeworth: (Robust... That president? Rotund seems more apt.) ...However, it seems this time the president's security wasn't exactly flawless.\nKay: Mr. Rooke had only just prevented your previous assassination, but this time...!\nde Killer: I did not kill him. It is not my principle to kill needlessly. I am also grateful to Rooke, a worthy adversary who was connected to me by fate. Thanks to that man, I did not kill a target who had no value to be killed.\nEdgeworth: (\"Thanks\" to Rooke preventing the assassination... What does he mean?)\nde Killer: My client deliberately gave me a false target. ...It was a betrayal most foul. I am now searching for my client. In all likelihood... ...it is the same person you are looking for.\nEdgeworth: (Is he saying that his client murdered the president?) Just who is this person you are referring to...?\nde Killer: I, myself, am not allowed to say. It would be a violation of the rules. I cannot disclose the identity of my clients. For to do so would create a problem of trust with my other clients. This is precisely why I am personally searching for them myself.\nKay: What are you going to do when you find your client?\nde Killer: Of course... they shall be rewarded with a punishment most befitting of a traitor.\nKay: Whaaaa!? That person... Wh-What'll happen to them?\nde Killer: ...I will leave that up to your imagination.\nEdgeworth: (It certainly won't be anything pleasant...)\nde Killer: Oh, yes... I will tell you just one more thing. Three days ago, Sirhan Dogen escaped from prison.\nEdgeworth: What!?\nde Killer: Three nights past, Dogen's solitary cell was found vacant. It was almost as if he knew I would come pay a visit.\nEdgeworth: (He visited Dogen's cell? Could it be, that the person De Killer is searching for is...)\nde Killer: Well then, if you'll excuse me, I must get going. Let us both do our best in tracking down that person...\nEdgeworth: (So, De Killer and Dogen. These two assassins...)\nOutside Grand Tower - Tower Plaza\nEdgeworth: (Hmm. This sound is...)\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth! Judge Courtney's cellphone is ringing!\nEdgeworth: (Could it be John?)\n???: Mr. Edgeworth. How are you doing?\nEdgeworth: (It sounds like they're using a voice changer...) Who is this?\n???: Someone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood...\nEdgeworth: (The red hood?) ...Are you the person who ambushed Kay?\n???: Brilliant deduction! I'd expect no less from a prodigy prosecutor such as yourself!\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth! I wanna listen in on this too!\nEdgeworth: Very well. (I'll put it on speaker...)\n???: Well, I must say that I didn't expect the girl to get amnesia.\nKay: Hey! What's that supposed to mean!?\n???: But that's not all, y'see. Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane.\nEdgeworth: What!? (This must be the person De Killer spoke of...!)\n???: I really should thank you, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth: You have no reason to thank me!\n???: Oh, you haven't noticed? My, that's troublesome, y'know. I wanted you to catch Blaise for me... ...so I took dear little Kay.\nEdgeworth: What?\n???: If Kay was suspected, I knew you would investigate the case. And I was sure that the great Miles Edgeworth would be able to catch Blaise! It was according to my plan! And y'know, I get the feeling that you have the wrong idea, so let me clear something up. Blaise Debeste wasn't the one who kidnapped Ms. Courtney's son.\nEdgeworth: ! You... Why do you know about the kidnapping?\n???: You and Ms. Courtney are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you...\nEdgeworth: (How could this person know something like that...? Judge Courtney was supposed to have visited me using the detective's name...)\n???: I bet you're wondering how I knew about the kidnapping, right? It's quite simple, really! It's because darling little John is in my care right now.\nEdgeworth: What!?\nKay: Huh!?\n???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces. Quickly, little Kay! You have to hurry and steal him back! You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you?\nKay: You even know it's my first job!?\nEdgeworth: (Why does this person know everything in so much detail?)\n???: Well... I suppose I can't blame you for your mistake. It seems Blaise was after John as well, y'see.\nEdgeworth: (So there were two kidnappings...)\n???: He's such a fool, y'know. Kidnapping his own son instead!\nEdgeworth: Is John there with you? If he is, then I would like to hear his voice.\n???: Hmm. He's here, but I'm afraid I can't do that. Y'see, he's asleep right now.\nEdgeworth: In that case, there's no way for us to know if you really kidnapped John or not.\n???: ...Hmph. I suppose you don't have to believe me if you don't want to.\nEdgeworth: What is your objective? Is it to get Patricia Roland declared not guilty?\n???: A not guilty verdict, eh... I couldn't care less about that.\nEdgeworth: (So his objective is different from Blaise's?)\n???: ...I think I'll keep my objective a secret for now. Well then, I must be going. I hope you enjoy yourself, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this.\n???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that.\nEdgeworth: Ngh...!\nKay: Who in the world was that...?\nEdgeworth: I don't know. We don't have enough information.\nKay: Darn it! We're totally clueless! Meanwhile, they seem to know everything about us!\nEdgeworth: ! (Know everything about us...?) Kay, you're right. Thinking about it, it is strange. How does the culprit know so much about us?\nKay: It's so weird! I mean they even know about the kidnapping!\nEdgeworth: We must figure out how the culprit was able to obtain that information. (I must recall... What exactly did that person know?)\n???: You and Ms. Courtney are really quite alike, y'know? She even came to visit you in the detention center and got all friendly with you...\n???: You wouldn't want to tarnish the Yatagarasu's name on your first job, would you?\nKay: You even know it's my first job!?\n???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces.\nEdgeworth: (That's it! By analyzing our conversation with the culprit...!) I've figured it out, Kay. I know the source of this person's information!\nKay: What!? Really!?\nEdgeworth: In all likelihood, this person probably...\nEdgeworth: I believe it is highly likely that we have been bugged.\nKay: B-Bugged!?\nEdgeworth: If you recall what that person said...\n???: You seem surprised. If only I could see the look on your faces.\nEdgeworth: If they couldn't see our faces, that means they weren't talking our pictures or following us.\nKay: Th-Then, they must've planted a bug somewhere! Could it be in my stuff...?\nEdgeworth: (Was there anything they could have had a chance to bug...? There must be a hint somewhere in our conversation just now... That's right... that person knew something they shouldn't have. The conversation between Judge Courtney and myself in the visitor's room...)\nEdgeworth: Judge Courtney!\nCourtney: Hush. Please, have a seat.\nEdgeworth: (The only evidence I had with me at the time was...!) Where was the bug planted...?\nEdgeworth: Kay. May I see your badge?\nKay: My Yatagarasu's badge? No way!\nEdgeworth: Wh-Why not...?\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth, just because you became a Great Thief's assistant... ...doesn't mean you're ready to wear this badge yet!\nEdgeworth: That's not it! It's very likely that a bug was planted in it.\nKay: Whaaat!? In my badge?\nEdgeworth: Let's take a closer look.\nKay: Ah! This is...!\nEdgeworth: It seems I was right.\nYatagarasu's Badge data updated in my Organizer.\nKay: How did you know?\nEdgeworth: The person had been in contact with you.\nKay: You mean, when I was knocked unconscious.\nEdgeworth: Yes. That's why I thought one of your possessions might have been bugged. However, that person also overheard my conversation with Judge Courtney. Even though that conversation took place in the visitor's room with just the two of us...\nKay: Ah, so you were holding onto it at that time...\nEdgeworth: Exactly. All the other evidence had been taken away from me... Only the Yatagarasu's badge remained with me.\nKay: So this creep's been listening in on us the whole time!\nEdgeworth: Indeed. That must be how they knew about all the information we collected.\nKay: Does that mean... they're also listening in on this conversation?\nEdgeworth: Most likely.\nKay: Hey, buster!\nEdgeworth: K-Kay...\nKay: Eavesdropping is for cowards! Why don't you come out here and fight us fair and square!?\nEdgeworth: (Hm? What was that sound just now?)\nNicole: Owwwwwwww...\nKay: Huh? That's... Nicole!\nNicole: Honestly, y'all scared the bejeezus out of me! Your voice was so loud there, Lil' Missy... I was so surprised I done fell flat on my behind!\nKay: I-I'm sorry...!\nNicole: What were ya gettin' so riled up for?\nKay: You gotta hear this! It really grinds my gears!\nNicole: Yes, yes?\nEdgeworth: ...Kay. Please just leave it at that. Unless you want to make tomorrow morning's headlines.\nKay: Ah! That was close...\nNicole: Aww, shucks. Don't be such a stick in the mud... What's wrong with lettin' a gal open her heart and spill the beans?\nEdgeworth: (For now, I'll turn the bug off.)\nBug data jotted down in my Organizer.\nNicole: So... did ya find the kidnappers?\nEdgeworth: Ms. Swift. Was the boy you saw being kidnapped... ...this boy in the photo?\nNicole: Hmm? Nope, they ain't nothin' alike. He had a more stupid-lookin' face, and was wearin' a collared school uniform...\nKay: I thought so...\nEdgeworth: (Yet again, we were led astray by this woman's testimony...) We will have to conduct our investigation all over again. So, we're back where we started. Are there any new leads...? (There's only 20 minutes left until 2 o'clock! Will we be able to make it in time...?)\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth! Mr. Edgeworth! About that phone call just now... Wasn't there a strange sound at the end?\nEdgeworth: A strange sound...?\nEdgeworth: Don't think you can get away with this.\n???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that.\nEdgeworth: Now that you mention it... It sounded like an explosion (Sound of an explosion - Sound of an explosion was heard during the call from the kidnapper.). It might be a hint to establish the culprit's whereabouts...\nNicole: Mm-hmm. I see, I see. The sound of an explosion, eh?\nEdgeworth: Hmph! I would appreciate it if you stopped eavesdropping on us!\nNicole: Mr. Prosecutor... Yer as stingy as ever.\nEdgeworth: (...First, let's see what she has to say...)\n(Clearing all \"Talk\" options of Nicole leads to:)\nNicole's Tape Recorder data jotted down in my Organizer.\n???: Mr. Edgewooooorth!\nEdgeworth: Mr. Keyes, Ms. Berry!\nSimon: D-Did you find him?\nKay: Not yet. Just where could John be...?\nSimon: John?\nKay: Ah! No, no! It's nothing! Don't worry about it.\nEdgeworth: (They don't know anything about the kidnapping.) Regarding Sebastian, we found him not too long ago.\nSimon: Really!? That's great! Thank you so much! Now I won't be arrested again.\nEdgeworth: Based on the explosion sound we heard from the kidnapper's phone... ...we know that John is being confined some place in the vicinity of the Coliseum.\nKay: One of the garbage dumps is right next to the Coliseum!\nEdgeworth: John was almost certainly taken there. In which case... the place he is being confined to must also be somewhere close by. Detective Gumshoe.\nGumshoe: Yes, sir!\nEdgeworth: Could I ask you to search the area around this garbage dump?\nGumshoe: .....You don't have to ask me like we're strangers, sir! It feels... so distant. ...Please just order me around like you normally do.\nEdgeworth: Are you sure, Detective? Right now I'm not a prosecutor.\nGumshoe: Didn't I tell you, sir? Detectives don't just investigate for the sake of prosecutors!\nEdgeworth: ...You have my thanks, Detective.\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth. Look. It's almost time...!\nEdgeworth: Yes. It would be best if we hurry. They should also be at their limit. Detective Gumshoe, I'm counting on you!\nGumshoe: Leave it to me, sir! This may be an unofficial investigation... ...but I'll call in all of my pals from the station to help!\nKay: I'll help too! Stealing John back is my job, after all!\nEdgeworth: I'll be returning to the courtroom. I might be able to draw out some more time.\nKay: Oookay! Well then! Even in the depths of... night...\nEdgeworth: Hmm. The clock just struck 2...! We have to hurry!\nGumshoe: Yessir!\nKay: Aaah, my introduction! ...When no other bird dares to take fliiight...\nBlaise: Well, well, well. If it isn't former Prosecutor Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth: (Blaise Debeste...!)\nFranziska: Witness! Face forward! We're not done talking yet!\nBlaise: Like I said, y'see. Why exactly would I have needed to help that person out, Your Honor?\nBlaise: Y'know, it's a crying shame. Having a beautiful woman declared guilty. Honestly, it brings tears to my eyes. But y'see, there's no reason for me to go out of my way to hide evidence just to save her.\nFranziska:\nFranziska: However, we still have the testimony of your son, Prosecutor Debeste! He testified that he handed the evidence over to you!\nBlaise: Hmm. Well, I haven't the slightest clue what he was talking about. I simply can't imagine why Sebastian would have said something like that, y'know.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: What if there is evidence that shows your connection with Warden Roland?\nBlaise: Hm? And just what do you think you're doing, \"Former\" Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was under the impression that you were no longer in any position to stand in court?\nFranziska: Miles Edgeworth! How dare you barge into my prosecutor's bench...\nEdgeworth: Franziska. I'm sorry. I need you to lend me the bench for a little while.\nFranziska: Wh-What are you saying...!?\nEdgeworth: Judge Courtney! I've brought vital evidence related to this case. Your Honor, please allow me to testify!\nCourtney: ........\nBlaise: Hah hah hah! She'd never allow it!\nRay:\nRay: Courtney-pie. Uncle Ray also asks that he be allowed to testify. There are no objections from the prosecution either, right?\nFranziska: .......... Understood. The prosecution also has no objections.\nBlaise:\nBlaise: There's no way you can allow something like this, y'know. Such high-handed methods... ...surely are enough to warrant being held in contempt of court. Wouldn't y'say, Courtney?\nCourtney: ........\nEdgeworth: (Ngh! As long as John is still in danger... ...Judge Courtney cannot rule against the warden. I must convey to her somehow that the search for her son is progressing!) Judge Courtney. I ask that you have faith in me and my assistant.\nFranziska: Now that you mention it, where exactly is she...?\nEdgeworth: She is currently out searching for the most important piece of evidence.\nBlaise:\nBlaise: It's a waste of time. There's no such evidence. Are you stalling for time? How disgraceful.\nRay:\nRay: Most important piece of evidence, huh? ...Courtney-pie. I don't really know what that evidence is, but I think we should have faith in her. After all, even if she may not look like it, she's still the Great Thief Yatagarasu!\nEdgeworth: (Somehow... it seems that Mr. Shields understands.) Judge Courtney! We've already determined the general location of that evidence. It's only a matter of time before she steals the evidence back.\nCourtney: ! ......I understand. Then I shall give you special permission to testify.\nEdgeworth: ...Thank you, Your Honor.\nBlaise: This is ridiculous!\nCourtney: This vital evidence that you have found... Please present it to the court!\nEdgeworth: Blaise Debeste and Patricia Roland are somehow connected. Allow me to present the evidence that proves it! (Which piece of evidence shows the relationship between Patricia Roland and Blaise Debeste?)\nEdgeworth: This document contains a detailed report regarding the interrogation of a certain man.\nRay: A certain man?\nEdgeworth: That man being the late Horace Knightley. And, the one who interrogated him was the defendant in this trial, Patricia Roland.\nRay: ! So that means, that was the interrogation where...\nEdgeworth: That's right... Patricia Roland murdered Knightley in the aftermath of the interrogation. And that very interrogation has been recorded in this written report!\nCourtney: That... definitely sounds like vital evidence!\nFranziska:\nFranziska: Miles Edgeworth. Just now, you referred to that document as a \"written report\". Now, just who in the world was that report written for?\nEdgeworth: I thought you might ask that, Franziska. And that's precisely what is most important about this report...! We found this document inside the safe in the storeroom on the 51st floor of the Grand Tower.\nFranziska: The 51st floor... The storeroom for the black market auction!\nEdgeworth: Indeed. And the Conductor of the auction was you, Blaise Debeste!\nBlaise: ............\nEdgeworth: You received a report about the victim from Warden Roland! In the face of this evidence, can you still say you have no connection to this case?\nBlaise: ......In regards to that, I refuse to answer.\nEdgeworth: What?\nBlaise: It has yet to be proven in court that I was the Conductor of the black market auction.\nEdgeworth: Oh? Have you already forgotten the events of this morning? I believe I had already proved it back then, did I not?\nBlaise: I will not deny that I was bested by you. However, that was at the crime scene. Who knows if the results will be the same in court. An acquittal is still possible, y'see. ...Until it's been proven in court that I am the Conductor of the black market auctions... ...you can't prove that document was addressed to me.\nEdgeworth: Your logic is twisted...!\nBlaise: That's not very nice, y'know. My logic isn't twisted, is it? Courtney? Don't you feel the same way? It was quite unlike you to allow Former Prosecutor Edgeworth's statement just now, y'know. ...It saddens me, y'see. That you would fail to uphold the law as a judge should. In fact, I'm so upset by this, I may have no other choice but to use my last resort, y'know.\nCourtney: .....I-It is as you say. Something that has not been proven in court does not merit any deliberation. I will have to... overrule... Mr. Edgeworth's claim.\nEdgeworth: (Ngh... As I thought, until John has been rescued...)\nBlaise: Y'see? The truth at the scene and the truth in the courtroom are two very different things.\nEdgeworth: So, you're saying the truth can be distorted in court, as long as it's for your sake?\nBlaise: What a horrible thing to say. I'm not distorting the truth or anything like that, y'know. If a not guilty verdict is handed down, then that becomes the truth. That's all it is, y'see.\nEdgeworth: (It's useless. There's nothing we can do useless the missing evidence turns up...)\nBlaise: Now then, Courtney. Why don't you deliver a Not Guilty verdict and let's get this over with? After all, that evidence... isn't gonna show up any time soon, y'know.\n???:\nCourtney: Wh-Who raised an objection just now?\nDebeste: ...P-Pops...\nBlaise: .....Sebastian.\nDebeste: ......Uugh.\nBlaise: Why did you come back here, now of all times?\nCourtney: Sebastian! What is the meaning of this?\nFranziska: Just where were you and what have been doing since you abandoned your own trial?\nDebeste: I-I'm sorry. I was... umm...\nFranziska: Such an act is unbecoming of a prosecutor! You should be ashamed!\nDebeste: I... umm... well...\nBlaise: Sebastian. You still don't get it, y'know. This court has no place for sniveling child such as yourself!\nDebeste: .....Pops.....! I...... I...! I-I've come to present new evidence, Your Honor! So, so... please! Let me take my place back at the prosecutor's bench!\nEdgeworth: (Sebastian...! I didn't think he would come back...)\nBlaise:\nBlaise: Hah hah hah hah! What's all this now, Sebastian? You don't seem at all like your normal self!\nDebeste: ........Uugh. Pops...\nBlaise: Hm? Come now! What's the matter? You want Daddy to play with you? Is that it? Well then, why don't we just head on back home.\nDebeste: R-Return to the witness stand.\nBlaise: What's wrong? You're shaking like a leaf.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: Your Honor! The prosecutor officially in charge of this case has just arrived with new evidence. The trial is still in session. In light of this, shouldn't we continue with the proceedings?\nCourtney: ........\nRay: Naturally, the defense has no objections, Your Honor. I'm sure the defense attorney originally in charge would say the same.\nFranziska: .....The prosecution has no objections, either, Your Honor.\nCourtney: ..........\nBlaise: Continue with the proceedings? That won't be necessary. Isn't that right? Courtney.\nEdgeworth: (Blaise still believes that he was the one who kidnapped John. As long as John still hasn't been found... ...Judge Courtney will remain bound by Blaise, and nothing else will change that!)\nCourtney: .......... Th-That sound is...\nEdgeworth: (Her cell phone...!) Hm...! (My phone as well...?)\nRay: Eh? Uncle Ray's phone is also...!\nGumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth!\nKay: Mr. Shields!\nGumshoe: We've found John, sir!\nKay: We rescued John!\nEdgeworth: Excellent work, Detective!\nRay: That kid was the most important piece of evidence, right? Way to go, Kay!\nKay: Eheheh! I wanted to spread the word quickly, so I had everyone call!\nEdgeworth: .....Judge Courtney. It's for you.\nCourtney: .....\nCourtney: .......Yes. I see. I'm..... I'm so glad you're safe...! Make sure you properly thank everyone. OK? ............Be careful, and come home safe.\nCourtney: ...Let us resume the proceedings. Now that I may once again swing my gabel to my heart's content.\nBlaise: Hah...! You're kidding, right? This is just a sad joke, y'know!\nCourtney: Witness! This is no joke! Please return to the stand! Prosecutor Debeste, as well. Promptly return to your seat at the prosecutor's bench!\nDebeste: Y-Yes, Your Honor!\nFranziska: ........Sebastian Debeste.\nDebeste: Y-Yes, Ms. von Karma...!?\nFranziska: .....I leave the rest to you.\nDebeste: Huh...?\nFranziska: \"Going up against your own father...\" It won't be easy. I shall observe how things pan out... from the gallery.\nCourtney: Now then, allow me to ask once more... Is the prosecution ready? Prosecutor Debeste. What is this new evidence you wish to present...?\nDebeste: .....The missing knife and chisel, Your Honor.\nRay: You mean they've finally been found!?\nCourtney: Prosecutor Debeste! Is this true!?\nDebeste: ...Th-The knife and chisel... I wasn't able to find them... I searched and searched! I really did! But... it was already too late...\nEdgeworth: (Too late...?)\nRay: What do you mean?\nDebeste: I remembered... This morning, when I passed by Pops in the garage at home... ...he was holding something wrapped in a newspaper.\nDebeste: Pops, where are you going?\nBlaise: Ah, Sebastian. Just taking out some trash.\nDebeste: At that moment, I heard it. .....The faint sound of a bell.\nRay: Could that sound have been, by any chance...\nEdgeworth: ...the bell attached to Dogen's chisel!?\nCourtney: In other words... you're saying that the witness threw away the evidence?\nBlaise: ........\nDebeste: I searched for it, but I didn't make it in time. I'm sorry...\nRay: Where exactly did you search for it?\nDebeste: The garbage dump! I went to the garbage dump and searched everywhere! I thought the evidence Pops threw away had to be there...!\nEdgeworth: Hm? Isn't that...! (Sebastian?)\nKay: Ah! What're you doing here?\nDebeste: WHOOOOOOOAAAHH!\nKay: H-He ignored us...\nEdgeworth: (So at that time, he had gone to the garbage dump...)\nDebeste: But... but... ...this was all I could find.\nCourtney: This is...? It smells rather peculiar...\nRay: Now that you mention it, there's kind of a funky smell coming from you as well...\nDebeste: Wh-What do you expect!? I was digging through garbage!\nEdgeworth: And what of the knife?\nDebeste: I think it's buried somewhere in that giant mountain of trash... ...but I couldn't find it by myself.\nCourtney: ...I understand. I shall accept this into evidence.\nBlaise: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Well done, Sebastian! You never betray my expectations, y'know! You searched so desperately through the garbage and that's all you have to show for it?\nDebeste: Urk...!\nBlaise: Awww, what a tear-jerker! I'm tearing up already!\nRay:\nRay: It's a bit too early for tears, don't you think? We haven't examined the evidence properly yet.\nBlaise: ...I think it's just a pointless waste of time, y'know.\nRay: I'm counting on you. Sebastian, Miles. Show him that the truth can be exposed in court and take him down!\nEdgeworth: (Mr. Shields is backing us up. Now all we need is a breakthrough...!) Prosecutor Debeste. Let's take a closer look at the evidence.\nDebeste: R... Right!\nEdgeworth: Let's have a look inside. (It'd be great if we could find some kind of proof.) This is... the bell that was attached to Dogen's chisel... Are there any traces left behind on it?\nDebeste: .....Ack, it's no good. There's not even a single smudge on it...\nCourtney: What did you find, Prosecutor Debeste!?\nBlaise: Did you even find anything?\nDebeste: D... Darn it...\nBlaise: Of course you'd find nothing. Something like that can't be called evidence, y'know. All it is, is trash. It may be sad, but that's the truth, y'see.\nEdgeworth: (Were Sebastian's efforts all for naught...?) Indeed, this bell does not seem to be valid evidence... (However...)\nDebeste: Mr. Edgeworth! Are you really giving up!?\nBlaise: Calm as always, Edgeworth. Quite unlike Sebastian here!\nCourtney: ...Well then, is the prosecution finished with its argument?\nDebeste:\nDebeste: Justine, not yet! We're not through yet! There's still something we haven't examined!\nBlaise: You're still not giving up? Struggling in vain's not cute at all, y'know.\nEdgeworth: (It seems Sebastian hasn't given up yet either. I was just thinking the exact same thing. The last item remaining... Is it trash, or is it evidence...? If we don't examine it, we'll never find out... The item I'm thinking of is...)\nDebeste: We're still not done examining the newspaper that the bell was wrapped in!\nEdgeworth: (It seems that Sebastian has the same idea as I do.)\nBlaise: Wow, this is just wonderful, y'know. So wonderful, it's to cry for. Is it desperation, or simply reckless abandon? Are you really going to... pin all your hopes on a worthless scrap of newspaper?\nEdgeworth: Heh. We won't know for sure whether or not it's \"worthless\" until we examine it, will we? Sebastian. Let's examine it posthaste.\nEdgeworth: Is this... a handprint?\nDebeste: ! There's something greasy on here too... Is it oil?\nEdgeworth: Judge Courtney! We'd like to request a fingerprint analysis on this paper! Could you please summon someone from forensics?\nCourtney: Your request is accepted. Contact the lab at once!\nForensics: Reporting! These are definitely fingerprints! However... it's from a glove!\nDebeste: Wh-Whaaaaaaat!?\nBlaise: Didn't I tell you? It's nothing but a worthless scrap of paper. Just thinking about it, y'know. When handling important evidence... ...what kind of idiot wouldn't use gloves!? Oh wait, wouldn't that be you? The idiot who doesn't know when to give up.\nRay: ...That's pretty harsh, talking to your son like that.\nBlaise: What's wrong with calling an idiot an idiot? If you want to be The Best, you have to be heartless. I have no compassion worthless individuals, not even my own son!\nDebeste: Pops...! I.....!\nBlaise: Y'know, you've always called yourself a genius prosecutor, haven't you? Didn't I explain to you this morning why you were a genius up until now? That's right. It was all because of me. Because of my authority. You were always being protected. By people like Courtney... and me.\nDebeste: ........Uuunghh.\nBlaise: Now, get that stinking face of yours out of my sight.\nDebeste: Stinking...\nBlaise: Y'know, now that I think about it, that stench might just suit you perfectly. Just keep it away from my nose, or my eyes will start watering.\nDebeste:\nDebeste: Wrong... You're wrong, Pops.\nBlaise: ...Sebastian? What are you talking about?\nDebeste: ...You're the one who stinks, Pops. It's you, not me!\nBlaise: What...?\nDebeste: ...You haven't noticed, have you? You smell, Pops. So much that you can't even hide it. Mr. Edgeworth... Try smelling the hand print on the newspaper.\nEdgeworth: The smell...? ...Hmm. It smells... like oil...\nDebeste: I know something that smells just like it...\nEdgeworth: (Come to think of it, back then...)\nEdgeworth: (It smells like motor oil. Maintaining that motorcycle must be Blaise's hobby.)\nDebeste: That's right... The smell proves it. It proves that the culprit who hid the evidence was...! It's no good... I guess I can't become the best after all. I'm too soft... I could never be so heartless... ...I just can't bring down my father with my own hands.\nEdgeworth: (Prosecutor Debeste...) ..........Summon... your courage. \"Become a different prosecutor from your father\"... Wasn't that what you decided?\nDebeste: !\nEdgeworth: We are prosecutors. And as prosecutors, we stand in the courtroom. In that case, isn't it our duty to shed light on the truth?\nDebeste: ........\nEdgeworth: Exposing crimes and bringing criminals to justice. Even if the criminal is your own father... ...that is your duty, as a prosecutor. Didn't I promise you? That if you have the courage to stand up... I will show you the way. And if you cannot do it alone, then we shall do it together...\nDebeste: ...Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Allow me to present the evidence that connects this hand print with my father!\nEdgeworth: This is the smell of motor oil. The kind used for maintaining motorcycles...\nDebeste: Both myself and Mr. Edgeworth have smelled this exact same smell before!\nEdgeworth: Blaise Debeste! It was in your garage!\nBlaise: !\nEdgeworth: And wouldn't you say these fingerprints have a rather peculiar shape? The five letters that spell out D-E-A-T-H. It's exactly the same as your own gloves.\nBlaise:\nBlaise: Ha ha ha! You can buy gloves like that from anywhere! It doesn't prove a thing!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: Is that really the case?\nDebeste: That's not the only thing that these two pieces of evidence have in common!\nEdgeworth: (The fingerprints on the newspaper that was used to wrap up the bell... ...and Blaise's mechanic's gloves...) This is the unmistakable similarity they both share!\nEdgeworth: If you examine the imprint left by the letter A, you'll see it's unmistakably from this glove.\nBlaise: Whaaaaaaaaat!?\nEdgeworth: And that's not all... There is one more item we must take note of. Namely, these dirt stains. I suggest we do a comparative analysis of the dirt stains from the newspaper and the glove. If the contents match up... then it will prove to be decisive evidence.\nCourtney: Bailiff! Please have these dirt samples sent to forensics for analysis immediately!\nBlaise: Gaaaaaaaarrgh! Edgewooorth! Sebastiaaaan! You lowly prosecutors! Do you have any idea who I am!?\nDebeste: Pops... you can't run away anymore. It's been proven in court that you concealed the evidence. And that you tried to cover for the defendant...\nBlaise: Y-You're saying that I'm... Guilty? That I'll be sent to prison...? Me, Blaise Debeste? A couple of snot-nosed punks are gonna make me disappear!? There must be some mistake!\nDebeste:\nDebeste: Be a man and admit your crimes!\nBlaise:\nBlaise: Do you really think you can survive if I'm not around?\nDebeste: I..... I'll be fine now. I thought I wanted to be the best prosecutor, so I could get your approval, Pops. But, when I was kidnapped by your men... and stuck in that dark room, I started thinking. \"I am... truly powerless.\" I despaired, and averted my eyes from the truth. But... ...at that moment, Mr. Edgeworth stepped in and showed me the way. And now, I am no longer just a child chasing after his father's approval! I've become capable... I can find evidence on my own now!\nBlaise: Wha... My men kidnapped you? Why were you...!?\nDebeste:\nDebeste: Pops, I'll show you the truth you never knew... through this trial.\nBlaise: Sebastiaaan! How dare you speak to me like that...! You should've just stayed as an idiot son!\nDebeste: You may have hated me to the very end, Pops... ...but I... I've always looked up to you. Thank you for everything up until now. .....And goodbye.\nBlaise: You... Since when did you... All you've ever been able to do was depend on me! SebaSTIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNN!\nCourtney: It has been established that the evidence was concealed by Blaise Debeste himself. A judgment regarding his concealment of evidence shall be delivered at a separate trial. The missing chisel and knife still have yet to be found. However, once a search of the waste disposal site is underway, they will surely be discovered.\nRoland: ...The knife will be found? Wh-What will happen to me if it's found?\nEdgeworth: Heh. No need to worry. You'll simply receive the punishment you deserve for your crime.\nRoland: Grrrr! Punishment? For me!? Blaise, what in the world are you doing!? You! You... After all your boasting about being able to create your own truths and Not Guilty verdicts! That's why I contacted you immediately after the prison incident in the first place! And to make matters worse, you even kidnapped the wrong kid! I just can't believe this! You really, really, really are... completely useleeeeeessss!\nEdgeworth: ...That was certainly a violent outburst. But you heard her, Prosecutor Debeste.\nDebeste: Yeah. She got flustered and said a bunch of important stuff! ...Right?\nEdgeworth: Indeed... That's correct. (He still doesn't seem very sure of himself...)\nCourtney: Very well. And with that, this court is adjourned.\n???:\nEdgeworth: What?\nFranziska: Huh!?\nCourtney: Wh-Who are you?\nLang: Judge Courtney. It's still too early for a happy ending. Lang Zi says: \"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case.\"\nCourtney: And who... might you be?\nLang: The name's Shi-Long Lang. I'm just a humble, lone investigator.\nCourtney: Do you have some objection with this trial?\nLang: Hah! Not a chance! The defendant there has a heart as black as a moonless night.\nRoland: Lang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...?\nLang: You got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree?\nEdgeworth: Agent Lang. What are you talking about?\nLang: The SS-5 Incident from 12 years ago... It's a case I'll never forget.\nEdgeworth: (12 years ago...?)\nLang: ......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life. But then, he suddenly changed. It's as if he became an entirely different person... Nowadays, he doesn't even have a shred of faith in the police force of Zheng Fa.\nEdgeworth: (12 years ago... I wonder what went on them?)\nEdgeworth: (Might it have something to do with Lang's father and President Huang?)\nLang: Patricia Roland. And you, Blaise Debeste. Back then, the two of you killed off the Lang clan...\nRoland: Rrgh...\nCourtney: Were you involved in the incident 12 years ago?\nLang: That's right, I was. However... I'm not here to chase after ghosts of the past. I'm here for you, Justine Courtney...!\nCourtney: M... Me?\nLang: You, and one other...\nJohn: ..........\nCourtney: John!\nLang: Ms. Courtney! You're coming along too! As a suspect in the murder of the president of Zheng Fa, Di-Jun Huang!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: Agent Lang! What evidence do you...!?\nLang:\nLang: Settle down, Mr. Prosecutor. The investigation has only just begun. We're going to inspect the crime scene with the suspects in attendance.\nEdgeworth: (Agent Lang... did he get his hands on some new pieces of evidence?)\nLang: If you have any objections, then you can tag along as well.\nEdgeworth: ...I shall do just that.\nJohn: ........\nEdgeworth: (\"The end of the trial is not always the end of the case\"... There are still many mysteries yet unsolved surrounding the murder of the president... Namely, the true nature of the \"giant monster\", and...)\n???: Then come and get me! I'll be looking forward to it! That is... if you can bring me to justice. But I highly doubt that.\nEdgeworth: (The true identity of the person on the other end of the phone...)\nTo be continued.\n\n",

Could you please give it a rest already?\nLotta:\nThe heck? I'm tellin' y'all, it's best for all y'alls sake to come clean!\nNicole:\nThe staff has their lips sealed shut as the reporters continue their tenacious negotiations!\nOfficer:\n...If you're not here to cooperate with the investigation, I must ask you to vacate the premises.\nLotta:\n...Put a sock in it, copper! Y'all couldn't even stop Moozilla's invasion!\nNicole:\nNot only did they secretly raise a giant monster, but now the staff is tryin' to cover it up...?\nPenny:\nLike I said, we haven't been raising any monsters here at the film lot!\nLotta:\nBut ain't ya said ya done saw Gourdy yerself!?\nPenny:\nSure, I saw it... but it's not like we were keeping it at the film lot!\n???:\nMind if we butt in?\nPenny:\nAh! Mr. Edgeworth!\nPowers:\nAnd John...!\nLotta:\nOh! Y'all come here to search for the monster too?\nLang:\nWe're searching for a criminal, not a monster. Lang Zi says: \"The darkness inside a criminal's heart can be likened to a monster!\" Well, when it comes to killing people, criminals aren't much different from monsters.\nOfficer:\nA-Agent Lang! This is a problem! I can't let outsiders enter the crime scene...!\nLang:\nThese are all key figures in the case. I'd like them to be here when the investigation resumes.\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang. Regarding what you said about resuming the investigation... Where do you intend to start?\nLang:\nWe'll start by reviewing the case. Today, the body of President Huang was found here at the film lot. The president's whereabouts from two nights ago are still unknown.\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems he snuck out from under the eyes of his bodyguards and ventured outside.\nLang:\nAnd that night was the last time he was seen alive. It was when he met with you, Judge Courtney, on the roof of the Grand Tower.\nJohn:\n!\nCourtney:\n......\nLang:\nSo, why did you meet with the president?\nCourtney:\nThat... I cannot say.\nEdgeworth:\n(You can't tell us, even under suspicion of murder?)\nJohn:\n...Can't say? Why not?\nKay:\nMs. Courtney! If you don't say anything, you'll be more suspicious!\nLang:\nLang:\nHah! She must have a reason to clam up! I think you're somehow involved in the president's assassination.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThe president's body was only discovered today. That still leaves a blank of one whole day after Judge Courtney met with him unaccounted for!\nLang:\nLang:\nDon't be so impatient. We're gonna fill in that blank right here, right now. The evening on that blank day in question is what's important... What happened here last night? So, why don't you tell us? John Marsh!\nJohn:\nMe?\nLang:\nWe know you were here last night.\nCourtney:\nWh-What... John was... here?\nLang:\nBetween that little missy's testimony and the footprints we found, we can easily prove it.\nPenny:\nJohn, you were rehearsing here last night, right?\nJohn:\n...You were spying on me?\nPenny:\nAh, umm, I'm sorry. I just came to check up on things. You really shouldn't be staying up so late, you know...\nJohn:\nMind your own business.\nCourtney:\nJohn Marsh! That young lady was worried about you. You will not speak to her like that!\nJohn:\n.......Sorry.\nCourtney:\nHow many times have I told you to be more mindful of the way you speak?\nKay:\nIt is just me, or does Ms. Courtney's personality seem kind of different?\nEdgeworth:\nShe seems to be as strict with her own son as she is with those who violate the law.\nCourtney:\nAre you listening to me? And earlier, as well...\nJohn:\n.....\nCourtney:\nYou should always bear that in mind, no matter the occasion...\nLang:\nLang:\n...Can we get on with the investigation already?\nCourtney:\nAh! ...Pardon me.\nEdgeworth:\n(For Judge Courtney to get carried away like that... This must be her motherly side.) Agent Lang. Do you suspect John?\nLang:\nAll I want is the truth. Why was the president killed...? And I want to know who killed him... I'll do whatever it takes to find out.\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems the president was like family to him...) John... Would it be alright if we asked you a few questions?\nJohn:\n...Sure. It's fine. I've got nothing to hide anyway.\n-- John's Rehearsal --\nJohn:\nI wasn't feeling too great during yesterday's shoot, so I made a few bloopers.\nThey're reshooting the scene today, so...\nWell, I decided to rehearse a little on my own. That's all.\nI do it all the time. There wasn't anything out of the ordinary.\nCourtney:\nYou were rehearsing alone that late at night...? John. When I called you last night, you told me you were at the hotel...\nEdgeworth:\nYou called him? About what time was that?\nCourtney:\nI believe it was around 11 PM. I require him to call me every night. That's our rule whenever he stays away from home.\nJohn:\n...The truth is, I was at the film lot during that time.\nCourtney:\nSo you lied to me...!\nJohn:\n.......... I'm sorry.\nKay:\nMs. Courtney sure is angry. I think it's admirable that he practiced on his own, even if he hid it from his mom.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sure she was simply worried. Who knows what could have happened to him, out alone so late at night? And in reality, he did get caught up in yesterday's incident...\nKay:\nBut John said, \"there wasn't anything out of the ordinary\", right?\nEdgeworth:\n(Is that really the truth?)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: John. You said you didn't feel well. Could you tell me more concretely what was wrong? John: That doesn't matter! I just wasn't feeling well, alright!? Kay: You weren't feeling well... Maybe you drank too much milk? John: Wha... How'd you...!? Ah, no, I mean, that's not it... Edgeworth: (So he didn't feel well because of his stomach...) Kay: When I was young, I was told that chewing milk makes it easier on your stomach, y'know? John: Th-This conversation is over! Anyways, I made a few bloopers.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So they planned to reshoot the scene today. And you were practicing for that last night. John: ...My mistakes caused a lot of trouble for the people around me. I'm a pro, so practicing that much more is natural. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He certainly does have an admirable sense of responsibility.) Penny: John is incredibly dedicated to his craft. He didn't even make any major mistakes in those bloopers. But he said if it would make the movie just a tiny bit better... John: Shut up! You don't need to go around blabbering about stupid stuff like that! Penny: Ah... I-I'm sorry. Edgeworth: (If only he was a little more cooperative, I'd have no complaints.) John: Hmph... Anyway, that's what happened.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: John. About your testimony just now... Courtney: John Marsh! Don't I always tell you!? If you're going to practice by yourself, you have to let me know beforehand! John: I-I-I know! Edgeworth: (...My time to speak was completely stolen away from me.) I shall ask you once more. John, about your testimony just now... Kay: But you know, John, I think that's really great! Edgeworth: (Mmph... A-Again!?) Kay: I bet putting in an honest effort like that will make someone even more talented. You'll go from a little thief to a Middle Thief, and then someday you'll become a Great Thief! I'll be doing my best, so you do your best too! OK, John? Edgeworth: ........Ahem. Now then, if I may? John. Do you often rehearse in that way? (At last... At long last, I finally got to ask my question...!)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: There are no mistakes in that testimony, correct? John: O-Of course there's no mistakes! It was just a normal, peaceful night! Nothing out of the ordinary happened at all! Kay: A... A peaceful night!? How can you say that when an incident like this has occurred!? Edgeworth: Kay, he is still a child. Please don't get seriously angry.\nEdgeworth: So there was nothing out of the ordinary...?\nKay: He doesn't know anything at all about the incident. That's the impression I'm getting. But isn't there evidence that shows something did happen last night?\nEdgeworth: Yes... I don't have time to waste dealing with a child's lies. Let's present the contradiction.",

Could that be...!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance.\nJohn:\n........Ugh.\nLang:\nWhat!? You're telling me you have video from last night!?\nEdgeworth:\nExactly. And in this video... ...there is clearly something that is out of the ordinary.\nLang:\nTh-This is... a monster's footprint...!\nEdgeworth:\nWould you say that monster's footprints are commonplace on a film set?\nCourtney:\nJohn... Why did you conceal this video from us?\nJohn:\n........No reason, really.\nLang:\n\nLang:\nHey, pup! This is no joking matter! You had a reason to hide it, right?\nCourtney:\nJohn Marsh! Answer him clearly!\nJohn:\nBut Mom.....\nEdgeworth:\nWell?\nJohn:\n...I didn't want anyone to see me rehearsing.\nLang:\n........\nKay:\n........\nEdgeworth:\n........ In other words, you're embarrassed about others seeing you practice.\nJohn:\n...Yeah. Got a problem with that!?\nLang:\n\nLang:\nYou're saying that's why you hid the evidence?\nCourtney:\nJohn!\nJohn:\nEep! ...Quit nagging me. You've already busted me, what more do you want? Yeah, the footprints were there, but I just practiced and headed home.\n\nLotta:\nHow come yer so calm after findin' those footprints!? It's a monster, ya know!? A real live monster!\nJohn:\n...I thought it was just a part of the set. Besides, there's lots of other weird stuff around here too.\nNicole:\nHe's suspicious, Chief! This kid's really suspicious!\nLotta:\nYer right! The smell of a scoop stinks to high heaven!\nJohn:\n...Shut up. We're done talking!\nLang:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait up...\"\nPresent Monster's Footprints or John's Practice Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere wasn't anything out of the ordinary? That's a lie, isn't it? We have evidence right here.\nJohn:\nAh! Could that be...!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right. It's the video you recorded of your performance.\nJohn:\n........Ugh.\nLang:\nWhat!?

We're done talking!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWe're not done here yet!\nJohn:\nWhat now?\nEdgeworth:\nThe monster's footprints weren't the only unusual things that happened last night. Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night?\n\n\n\nPresent Moozilla's Head\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"A monster's head fell from the roof of that building.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis shows what happened here yesterday.\nJohn:\n...And just what exactly does it show?\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't understand, do you? You are still a child, after all.\nJohn:\nI don't need some guy who's less intelligent than a child telling me that.\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (It seems that wasn't it...)\nKay:\nLet's review what happened here last night one more time!\nEdgeworth:\nYes. I won't let this child make a fool of me any longer!\nKay:\nWhy are you getting so worked up about that? Anyways, just what was it that happened last night?\nLeads back to:\n\"Besides the monster's footprints, what other unusual thing happened last night?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA monster's head fell from the roof of that building. Surely you must have known about that?\nJohn:\n...! I don't know anything about it.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that true?\nJohn:\nI told you, I just practiced a bit and then I went back. I don't know anything about Moozilla's head falling or anything like that! Or do you have evidence to show that I know something?\nEdgeworth:\n(...There certainly isn't any evidence of that. It's also possible that it fell after John had already gone back...)\nJohn:\nIf there's no evidence, then like I said, we're done talking!\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems that John doesn't really want to talk about last night. Could he be hiding something after all...?)\nLeads to:\n\"Wait up...\"\nEdgeworth:\nSo there was nothing out of the ordinary...?\nKay:\nHe doesn't know anything at all about the incident. That's the impression I'm getting. But isn't there evidence that shows something did happen last night?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... I don't have time to waste dealing with a child's lies. Let's present the contradiction.\nLang:\nWait up...\nEdgeworth:\n? Agent Lang?\nLang:\nHeh heh heh. It's as I thought. Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor. This video backs up my logic.\nKay:\nHuh!? Is there something in the video that's related to the case?\nLang:\nYeah... Take a good, hard look at the monster costume in the top-left.\nKay:\nThe Moozilla costume...?\nLang:\nTry comparing it with the one over there right now.\nKay:\nHmm? It looks like it's just hanging there limply though. And the zipper on its back is zipped up tightly.\nEdgeworth:\n(Zipper on its back...?) Wha! (Th-This discrepancy is...!)\nLang:\nYeah. The difference is plain to see. In the video, the zipper is clearly open! That's right... Someone was inside.\nKay:\nWHAAAAAAAT!\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Powers! Is the costume's zipper usually...?\nPowers:\nIt's always zipped up tightly when it's not in use...\nLang:\nMr. Prosecutor. Do you remember? My logic from before...\nLang:\nTwo nights ago, Courtney pushed the president off the roof and killed him. Afterwards, she snuck into the film lot to hide the body.\nEdgeworth:\nIn here?\nLang:\nWouldn't it be easy to hide a body in costume or behind all this equipment? Then, all she had to do last night was retrieve the body.\nEdgeworth:\nYou're saying the body... was hidden inside the costume?\nLang:\nYeah, that's right! Judge Courtney! Two nights ago, you pushed the president off the roof of the tower. You then hid the body inside the monster costume!\nCourtney:\nI... I did no such thing!\nLang:\nLang:\nSay what you want, but you're the only one who could've done it!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThat should have already been proven impossible. The film lot was locked at the time! Judge Courtney could not have entered this place!\nLang:\nLang:\n...And what if there was an accomplice?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat?\nLang:\nI'll tell you my reasoning, so listen up.\n-- Mother and Son Theory --\nLang:\nWhen the president was pushed off the roof, John was waiting at the film lot.\nIf John was an accomplice, the problem with the locks would be resolved.\nThe two of them then hid the president's body.\nInside that monster costume over there...\nEdgeworth:\nYou think this crime had such an elaborate plan?\nLang:\nTo take the life of a nation's president. An elaborate plan is to be expected, don't you think?\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nJohn would never... take part in such a crime!\nLang:\nLang:\nYou're the one being suspected. Your words don't carry much weight!\nEdgeworth:\nI wouldn't think those two had sufficient motive for something like this, though?\nLang:\nWell, maybe they had a motive that we didn't know about? You were the last one to meet with the president. And you're still keeping the details secret. Don't you think it's only natural that you're being suspected?\nCourtney:\n......\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney. Is there no way for you to tell us your secret.\nCourtney:\nM-My apologies. I just cannot, no matter what... However, when the time I can talk about it comes, I will surely let you know. So, if you could please...\nLang:\nBelieve you? Is that what you wanted to say? That's what all criminals say. And you, pup... If you've got an explanation, hurry up and spit it out.\nJohn:\nHmph. I didn't do nothing. ...That's all I'm saying.\nLang:\nBoth mother and son won't talk. You still gonna defend 'em like this?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's true, Judge Courtney's actions are a mystery... ...however, we still don't know whether or not that ties in with a motive for murder.\nLang:\nYeah, that's right. Their motive for murder can wait. For now, let's talk about the situation surrounding the crime. ...And the fact that these two are the only ones who could've done it!\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang. Don't tell me you're saying John was an accomplice? Kay: John still looks like a grade school kid, he's even got a kiddy backpack to boot! How could he be an accomplice...? There's just no way! Penny: Like I said, John's already in middle school, and the backpack is a part of his costume... Lang: Lang: Lang Zi says! \"No matter how young the cub, never pity an ungrateful pup.\" He may be a little brat, but a villain deserves no mercy. Kay: Uuuh... So Mr. Lang Zi didn't make any allowances for age... Lang: Mr. Prosecutor. You're not just defending him 'cause he's a pup, are you? Edgeworth: Hmph. Of course, that was never my intention. I shall present suitable evidence in due course. Lang: Oh? I'm looking forward to it. My logic's just getting started.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: How would that... resolve the problem!? Lang: I figured you'd ask that, Mr. Prosecutor. But y'know, it's actually quite simple. Listen up... First, that woman pushes the president off the roof. Kay: Hmm... she pushes him off. Lang: Then, that brat, who knew the combination for the lock, unlocks the film lot. Kay: I see... the combination unlocks the brat! Edgeworth: Kay, it's the opposite. Lang: ...That's all it takes. With this, the problem of the lock is solved. Your theory that she couldn't get in because she didn't know the combination no longer files! Edgeworth: (Hmm... Regarding the lock, that certainly is a plausible explanation...) Agent Lang. Thank you for your clear explanation. Please, continue with what you were saying before. Lang: Hmph. If you're gonna give up, you better do it now.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Supposing those two were accomplices... Why would they have needed to leave the body hanging there for an entire day!? Lang: Lang: Why don't you give it a rest, and take a good hard look at reality. Thanks to their trickery, our investigation has been confused up until now. Doesn't that about answer your question!? ...Got it? Those two hid the body.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: In the video, we cannot see the inside of the costume. So can you really say for certain that the body was placed inside? Lang: ...Yeah, I'll give you that much. In that case, why don't we try examining it? The inside of that costume! There might be some traces left inside. Edgeworth: Mr. Powers, may we examine the inside of the costume? Powers: Sure. Go ahead. But it might be kinda stinky, since I sweat a lot in here... Edgeworth: This is... incredibly dirty. Powers: That's strange... We always make sure to clean it after using it, so that the sweat doesn't damage the costume. Lang: Lang: Isn't this just proof that someone besides you used this costume? I'd say that dirt from the body probably got into the costume. Kay: The president's body did fall on top of the monster's footprint. That must be where the dirt came from! Lang: ...Are you satisfied now? Add statement: \"There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So, dirt got into the costume when the body was hidden inside. Wouldn't that mean... ...that the dirt was transferred from the body? Lang: Hah! Isn't that obvious? How else would you say it got there? Kay: ...There's dirt stuck everywhere inside the costume. It looks particularly bad around the chest area. Edgeworth: (Dirt around the chest...? We cannot overlook this fact.)\nKay: Mr. Lang's logic does seem to make sense...\nEdgeworth: Indeed, if those two were accomplices, the crime certainly would have been possible. So it would be useless to argue that point.\nKay: In that case, what should we do?\nEdgeworth: Firstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail.

So it would be useless to argue that point.\nKay:\nIn that case, what should we do?\nEdgeworth:\nFirstly, we should have Agent Lang explain his reasoning in more detail. Let's draw out more information.\nEdgeworth:\nDirt got onto the costume when the body was hidden inside it... Is that really the case?\nLang:\nYou have a problem with that?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is a fair amount of dirt inside the front of the costume.\nKay:\nYeah, that IS a lot of dirt...\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, I would like you to focus on the state the body is in. It's lying on top of the dirt, and yet there's no dirt on the front of the body.

How did the dirt get inside the costume!?\nEdgeworth:\n(From the video footage, it's very likely that someone was inside the costume. But just who could it have been...?)\nKay:\nHmm... Where have I seen this?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's the matter, Kay?\nKay:\nI just feel like I remember seeing something that looked like this dirt somewhere before... ...but where was it? There were these bits of gray fragments mixed in with the dirt.\nEdgeworth:\n(Gray... fragments? There does seem to be something other than normal dirt mixed into it...)\nKay:\nSomething must've gotten stuck to it, and lots of it I might add. Hmm...\nEdgeworth:\n(Something got stuck to it? This may merit a closer look. Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?)\nPresent Mechanic's Gloves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is what you're thinking of, isn't it, Kay?\nKay:\nOh! Mr. Edgeworth, you sure are sharp!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Naturally.\nKay:\n...But too bad! Not this time!\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! (You should have just said that in the first place!)\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth, can't you remember? Dirt, dirt... Where else did we see this dirt?\nEdgeworth:\n(Dirt... Wasn't there a piece of evidence that had dirt on it?)\nKay:\nIt's on the tip of my brain, but I just can't quite place it. Where on earth have we seen dirt like this before?\nLeads back to:\n\"(Where did we see dirt that looks like what's stuck on the inside of the costume...?)\"\nEdgeworth:\nThis dirt... has some gray bits mixed into it.\nLang:\nHuh? And what of it?\nEdgeworth:\nWe found an item belonging to a certain man, that was covered in the same type of dirt. That is to say, these gloves.\nLang:\nThose dirt stains... certainly look the same. But, tell me... Just what exactly is this grey substance!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis grey substance is...\nPlastic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I believe it's plastic. Your thoughts?\nLang:\n\nLang:\nHah! You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Prosecutor! Put more \"BANG!\" into your claims, like you usually do!\nEdgeworth:\nAh... Hmm.\nLang:\nAs for my opinion on the matter... I'll tell you right now, that stuff is definitely not plastic!\nEdgeworth:\nNngwaaah! (So that wasn't it...)\nKay:\nLet's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it?\nEdgeworth:\nRight. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally.\nLeads back to:\n\"This grey substance is...\"\nConcrete\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This grey substance must be fragments of concrete.\"\nPaint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nNo matter how you look at it, this must be paint!\nLang:\n\nLang:\nMr. Prosecutor! When did you become so scatterbrained!? No matter how you look at it, this doesn't look like paint!\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (I suppose not...)\nKay:\nLet's take another good look at the state of the crime scene! What would be the most likely thing here to have dirt stuck on it?\nEdgeworth:\nRight. If we focus our thinking on that, the answer should come naturally.\nLeads back to:\n\"This grey substance is...\"\nEdgeworth:\nThis grey substance must be fragments of concrete.\nKay:\nYou mean... the stuff that was scattered around the monster's footprints?\nEdgeworth:\nExactly. Meanwhile, who do these gloves, which are stained with the same kind of dirt, belong to?\nKay:\nOh, I remember! We found it at Blaise's place!\nEdgeworth:\nEarlier today, we went to Blaise's garage. There, we discovered these dirt-stained gloves. Come to think of it, there were also hammers, shovels, and other tools placed inside, as well. Why would mechanic's gloves, intended to be used on machines, be covered in dirt? If he broke the concrete with the hammer, and then dug into the soil with the shovel... ...then it's only natural for dirt like that to get on the gloves.\nKay:\nThen, maybe...!\nEdgeworth:\nYes. The true nature of the monster's footprints... has been made clear. It's possible that these footprints were dug up by Blaise Debeste himself.\nLang:\nLang:\nIt's possible...? Hmph! It's possible, you say!? Please do enlighten me. 'Cuz I honestly have no clue! Why on earth would he do something like that?\nEdgeworth:\n(Why did he make the monster footprints? Thinking about it, the answer must be...)\nHe was digging something up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's possible he was digging something up.\nLeads to:\n\"It probably went something like this.\"\nHe buried something\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCould it have been because he buried something?\nKay:\nHe buried something!? I smell treasure! So, what did he bury?\nEdgeworth:\nIf we want to find that out, we'll have to dig it up ourselves.\nLang:\n\nLang:\nYou think the police wouldn't have already investigated that? There was absolutely nothing buried beneath those footprints!\nEdgeworth:\nNngwaaah! (It seems that was wrong...) In that case, we should assume the opposite: he dug something up.\nLeads to:\n\"It probably went something like this.\"\nEdgeworth:\nIt probably went something like this. Last night at this spot, there was something that Blaise needed to dig up. For that reason, he broke the lock on the back door ans sneaked into the film lot... Using the hammer and shovel, he set to work. He placed the items he dug up into his bag, but before he could fill in the holes...\nKay:\nAh! That's when John came to practice!\nEdgeworth:\nExactly. Blaise panicked, and had no choice but to hide himself in the Moozilla costume nearby.\nLang:\nGrr... To think you would deduce so much from just a pair of dirt-stained gloves... However! All of this is merely a possibility! There's still no proof that he was the one who was hiding inside that costume! For all we know, he might've left the scene once he finished digging!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nOn the contrary. Such proof does exist, and can be seen... in the video. When this video was recorded, Blaise was definitely inside the film lot.\nLang:\nWhaaaaat!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Though I can't blame Agent Lang for not noticing... ...the difference between the current flim lot... ...and the one in John's video. Along with the state of Blaise's garage... ...it's all too clear that Blaise was still here!) What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded?\nPresent duffel bag beside monster costume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This bag placed near the costume...\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis proves that Blaise was still at the film lot!\nKay:\nUmm... How exactly does it prove that?\nLang:\nYeah, I'd like a better explanation as well!\nEdgeworth:\n...Argh! (So this has nothing to do with Blaise...)\nKay:\nIf something belonging to Blaise could be seen in this video, then proving it would be easy... Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything that comes to mind?\nEdgeworth:\n(Something belonging to Blaise... Does anything like that appear in the video?)\nLang:\nWell, Mr. Prosecutor!? How about it...? Is there really any evidence that Blaise Debeste was there?\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no need to rush, Agent Lang.\nLeads back to:\n\"What proves that Blaise was still at the film lot when this video was recorded?\"\nEdgeworth:\nThis bag placed near the costume... There was an identical one inside Blaise's garage.\nLang:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nFirst, the dirt on the gloves, and now the bag... It seems there is a connection.\nMechanic's Gloves data updated in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that's my proof. Blaise was inside the costume. Ergo, the president's body could not have been hidden inside it!\nLang:\nAiyaaaaaaaaa!\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems I was able to refute Agent Lang's reasoning.)\nGumshoe:\nSomeone needs to go investigate Blaise's house right away, pal! We need to know what was inside that bag!\nOfficer:\nYessir!\nLotta:\nY'all pipe down and listen up! Y'all just been sayin' whatever works best for y'all!\nEdgeworth:\n(...And the noisy one returns.)\nLotta:\nThat there's the footprints of the Mighty Moozilla! They ain't just some random holes dug up by that old coot!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I believe the true nature of these footprints has already been proven quite logically.\nLotta:\nLogic schmogic, I ain't buyin' it! Say whatcha want, but I know what I saw, and I saw Moozilla!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is she referring to how she saw Moozilla out of the window of the Grand Tower...? Preposterous.)\nNicole:\nUpon our journalist's souls, we ain't havin' none of it!\nEdgeworth:\n(That statement is an insult to journalists everywhere...)\nNicole:\nAh! That's right! There's more to them monsters than just those footprints! I remember hearin' that sonny over there was seen with the monster earlier! I reckon that gal over there said she witnessed it herself!\nEdgeworth:\n(When these two are together, all meaningful talk grinds to a halt...)\nKay:\nIf we only knew just what the \"monster\" really was, I think those two would quiet down. Mr. Edgeworth, isn't there anything you can do?\nEdgeworth:\n(The monster's true identity...?) We don't have much choice... Let's see what we can do.\nLotta:\nIsn't there somethin' y'all ain't tellin' us about the monster!? Nicole! Ask 'em! Ask 'em right now!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n....Please settle down. Regarding the true identity of that \"monster\", I already know what it is.\nLotta:\nWha'd ya say!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right. The video John recorded provided the hint that I needed...\nLotta:\nWhatchu talkin' bout?\nEdgeworth:\n(Ms. Nichols saw Gourdy... ...when she went to check up on John's practice. At that times, she mistook \"something\" for Gourdy.) The \"monster\" can be seen in this photograph.\nLotta:\nWhat!? Ain't that just some plain old souvenir photo!? Y'all don't really think ya can pull the wool over the eyes of a pro like me, do ya?\nEdgeworth:\n(What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?)\nPresent camera crane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Naturally... Gourdy's true identity was...\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe \"Gourdy\" that Ms. Nichols saw... was actually this!\nLotta:\nThere ain't no foolin' a real pro! Yer sayin' this is Gourdy!? It don't look nothin' like it!\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! (I had my suspicions...)\nKay:\nLet's double-check what Gourdy looks like. Something with a similar shape might be in the photo!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. (Gourdy's shape...?)\nLeads back to:\n\"(What did Ms. Nichols really see, that she mistook for Gourdy?)\"\nEdgeworth:\nNaturally... Gourdy's true identity was... ...this camera crane!\nLotta:\nWh-What!?\nEdgeworth:\nThe video John recorded was shot from fairly high up. A shot from this position would be impossible without a camera crane.\nNicole:\nBut...! There ain't no way Ms. Nichols would mistake a camera crane for Gourdy!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder about that. ...Ms. Nichols.\nPenny:\nY-Yes!\nEdgeworth:\nEarlier, you said the prescription for your glasses didn't match your eyesight anymore, correct?\nPenny:\nYes. Lately, it seems like my eyesight has suddenly gotten a lot worse.\nEdgeworth:\nSo would you say that you weren't able to see Gourdy very clearly in the dark?\nPenny:\nThat's right... Its silhouette was all I could make out...\nNicole:\nBut, remember what Ms. Nichols said!? And I quote, \"Its skin was really scaly... almost like a reptile...\"!\nLotta:\nCamera cranes ain't got no flesh on 'em, let alone skin! It's just a bare steel frame!\nEdgeworth:\nThat is certainly true. At least, in the case of this photo... However, last night it did have skin.\nLotta:\nY'all just doin' whatever ya can to get in the way of our big scoop, ain't ya!?\nEdgeworth:\n(That was not my intention... ...but since I've come this far, it's time to put an end to your nonsense.) Gourdy's skin is right before our very eyes. This is the \"skin\" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw!\nPresent vinyl sheets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"As Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night.\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the true identity of Gourdy's skin!\nLotta:\nAnd just how could somethin' like that be taken for skin, ya heinous prosecutor!? Yer just spoutin' nonsense, tryin' to take our whole scoop for yerself! Yer pure evil! Yer a demon prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nM... Mmph. (That is decidedly not what I'm trying to do.) On its own, the crane bears no resemblance to Gourdy at all.\nKay:\nSomething must have been draped over the crane.\nEdgeworth:\n(Last night, it looked like it was going to rain... And if that's the case, there's only one thing it could have been!)\nLeads back to:\n\"This is the \"skin\" of Gourdy that Ms. Nichols saw!\"\nEdgeworth:\nAs Ms. Nichols stated in her testimony earlier, it looked like it was going to rain last night. While it never actually rained... ...John still covered the camera crane with a rainproof sheet. Which, to Ms. Nichols... looked like a monster's skin!\nNicole:\nWhaaaaaaaat!\nLotta:\nY-Ya gotta be kiddin' meeee!\nEdgeworth:\nIsn't that right, John?\nJohn:\nMan, you saw through it all. .....Not bad, old man.\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, the \"Gourdy\" that Ms. Nichols saw was nothing more than an illusion.\nLotta:\nNot again... Looks like my dream has shriveled up and died once again...\nNicole:\nM-Mentor!\nKay:\nSeems like things have finally settled down.\nLotta:\nI really thought the boy was hidin' somethin' from me... Guess I had it all wrong.\nLang:\n...Now that we've figured out the true form of the monster, everyone seems refreshed.\nKay:\nActually, there's two people here who are totally bummed out.\nForensics:\nAgent Lang! The report is in, sir! We've got the results of President Huang's autopsy!\nLang:\nGood! Show it to me!\nLang:\n\"Contusions and bone fractures found across the body, resulting from tremendous pressure.\" So, this was the cause of death. In other words... he was crushed to death.\nEdgeworth:\n(I thought as much...)\nCrime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer.\nLang:\nThe yellow stain on his chest is currently under investigation... ...but it seems that gunpowder residue was found on his right hand.\nKay:\nSunflower residue!? I didn't know the president was into gardening!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, gunpowder residue. Traces of it are left behind when a gun is fired. Since it has been found on his right hand, it's possible that the president fired a gun.\nKay:\nA gun, huh? But we didn't find any guns when we investigated this area.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Unexplained gunpowder residue? I'll have to look over the autopsy report later.) Now then, Agent Lang. It seems we have our answer. The president did not die from falling off the roof of the Grand Tower. Rather, he died from being crushed under Moozilla's head!\nLang:\nI can't deny it... Looks like your logic was right after all.\nKay:\nThis means the suspicions surrounding Ms. Courtney should be cleared up, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Not only the cause of death, but the time of death proves her innocence as well. Judge Courtney met with the president two nights ago. However, according to the autopsy report, the time of death was around 11 PM last night. Moozilla's head also fell last night... It matches up perfectly.\nKay:\nThat's a relief!\nLang:\nLang:\n...Isn't it a bit too early to be relieved?\nEdgeworth:\n(Agent Lang?)\nLang:\nThe president died after being crushed by the Moozilla's head. That, I will admit. But the problem is, who was responsible for the falling head...?\nEdgeworth:\nMoozilla's head fell last night. And last night, the one who was at the film lot was...\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nWhat are you saying!? Surely, you're not implying...\nLang:\nThat's right. You killed him, didn't you? John Marsh!\nJohn:\n........\nLang:\nThat pup is hiding something. He was at the scene where the body was discovered last night. He also saw the \"footprints\". And despite that, he still claims to know absolutely nothing about the incident? Isn't that a bit too convenient?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThese footprint-shaped holes have not been proven to be related to the case! Just because he saw the holes, doesn't necessarily mean that he's involved in the incident!\nLang:\nLang:\nYou sure about that? Take a look at the pup's face.\nJohn:\n..............\nLang:\nHe looks pretty shaken up to me.\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like he hit the mark... but John doesn't want to talk about it.)\nLang:\nIf he doesn't feel like talking, then I have an idea of my own. Let's check the tape.\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang. What is your intention?\nLang:\nThe police have a device that lets you analyze the video footage up close and personal.\nCourtney:\nAgent Lang. You would suspect John enough to go that far...\nEdgeworth:\n(As long as John's lips are sealed... ...this may be the only way for us to get closer to the truth.) Detective Gumshoe! If I'm not mistaken you have that device with you, correct?\nGumshoe:\nMr. Analysis is ready to go, sir!\nLang:\nNow we're talking!\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. Would you please perform the video analysis for us?\nEdgeworth:\n(She wants me to do it...?)\nCourtney:\nWho knows what kind of faults that wolf-man will find in it!\nEdgeworth:\n(This isn't exactly my strong suit, but I suppose I have no choice... Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\nMonster costume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the Moozilla costume. If you zoom in, you can see that the back is unzipped.\nKay:\nYeah. Mr. Powers was supposed to get inside to play the monster in the movie. ...But, I don't really get it. The Mozilla in the movie is supposed to be big enough to demolish an entire building. Once he's inside the costume, how does he activate its megazord form?\nEdgeworth:\n...I think you have a big misunderstanding. The costume doesn't actually become big.\nKay:\nI see. So what's big is not the costume, but the misunderstanding. Hmm... I think I kinda get it now. Thanks!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does she really understand...?)\nLeads back to:\n\"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\"\nDirt ground\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBlaised Debeste used the tools in his garage to dig up something.\nKay:\nThere was a huge hammer in his garage too.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. That was probably used to break the concrete. As it turns out, these weren't Moozilla's footprints at all. Are you disappointed?\nKay:\nA Great Thief needs to have the strength to accept the truth, no matter how hard it is. I must become stronger. Much, much stronger!\nEdgeworth:\n(...I guess she couldn't handle the truth.)\nLeads back to:\n\"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\"\nDi-Jun Huang (after zooming)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"(Th-This is...!)\"\nAnywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's nothing of interest here.\nLeads back to:\n\"(Are there any new clues shown on the video?)\"\nEdgeworth:\n(Th-This is...!)\nKay:\nWhat's the matter? I wanna see too! ...Hm? Eeeeeeeeeek!\nLang:\nHey! What's wrong!? Show it to me!\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth! I request you submit the evidence to the court!\nEdgeworth:\n...Please take a look at the top right corner of the zoomed-in video.\nLang:\nTh-This... This person is...! ...th-the presideeeeeent!\nCourtney:\nImpossible!\nJohn:\nHuh!? N-No way!\nLang:\nIt seems we've finally found it at last. The evidence that points to the true killer...!\nEdgeworth:\n(This video places John at a major disadvantage...!)\nJohn:\nY-You're wrong! That's not right! I didn't know anything about this!\nLang:\nThat's not gonna cut it. It's clear that you and the victim were together at the same place where his body was later found! John Marsh! There's no doubt. You killed the president!\nCourtney:\nN-No! This can't be...! Why, why would you...? John... please don't tell me... Did you really kill the president?\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! Is this really decisive evidence...?\nLang:\nMr. Prosecutor. Looks like even you can't object to this.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ngh...!)\nLang:\nThat pup said he didn't know anything, right? And yet, the president's right here in the video!\nJohn:\n........\nEdgeworth:\nJohn! What are you hiding?\nCourtney:\nJohn...! Please tell us the truth!\nJohn:\n.......... The truth is... The truth is... It's all my fault...\nCourtney:\nJohn Marsh! What did you do!?\nJohn:\nM-M-Moozilla's head falling was all my fault!\n-- During the Rehearsal --\nJohn:\nWhile I was setting up the equipment on the roof, I used the heater...\nAfter that, I went down to practice, but I forgot to turn it off.\nThen my mom called me, so I left the film lot.\nWhen I came back to the lot, after the phone call was over...\nMoozilla's head that was on the roof had fallen...\nAnd right next to it was the president, lying dead on the ground...\nCourtney:\nH-How can that be...?\nEdgeworth:\nI see. There were indeed traces that something had caught fire on the rooftop.\nJohn:\n..It was just a small fire, so I was able to put it out by myself.\nKay:\nSo... the president's death was John's fault?\nGumshoe:\nBut, wouldn't that make this an accident, sir?\nEdgeworth:\n...And then, what did you do with the fallen head?\nJohn:\nI took it apart, brought the pieces up to the roof, and put it back together.\nLang:\nLang:\nSo, you put out the fire, and even put the fallen head back on the roof. Which means you were hiding evidence... We can't be having that, you naughty little pup.\nJohn:\nI didn't do it on purpose! I really did just forget to turn off the heater...\nEdgeworth:\nWhen the legs broke, the stand would have tilted. If Moozilla's head was on top of the stand...\nKay:\n...it would've fallen off! So, the head fell down because of the fire!\nEdgeworth:\nYes. And if that's the case, I also have a pretty good idea what caused the fire. There's a flammable can next to the heater. It seems someone is lacking in safety awareness.\nLang:\nLang:\n...Was it really just an accident? If that's the truth, then what was the president doing here?\nJohn:\nI-I don't know! There was no one else around when I was there!\nLang:\nYou expect me to believe that!? The president wouldn't have just come to a place like this without a reason, you know!\nEdgeworth:\n(Indeed, the president's reason for coming here is still a huge mystery... Two nights ago, he met with Judge Courtney on the roof of the Grand Tower... ...and last night, he was here at the film lot. Did he meet with John...? I'll have to listen to John's testimony very carefully...!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: John. You are still young. I know it can get a little cold in early spring, but you shouldn't have to resort to a heater... Courtney: Courtney: It is precisely because he is young that he must make sure to take good care of himself! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: However, while it can get a bit chilly during this time of year, I wouldn't necessarily say... John: Hold it, old man. Is this really the right time to be having this argument? Edgeworth: G..... Gah! (He's completely right.) Courtney: John. You did well to get the better of Mr. Edgeworth, but please mind your language. Edgeworth: (Let's not forget that he got the better of you too, Your Honor...) John: I-I know, Mom... So, umm... where was I?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You forgot to turn off the heater? You didn't check it before leaving the roof? John: I meant to turn it off, but I was too focused on practicing, so... And come on, everyone forgets stuff like that sometimes! Kay: Yeah, I gotcha! I forget small things like that all the time too! Like sometimes, I'll forget to turn off the AC or the lights in Mr. Edgeworth's office... ...or I'll jump off the ladder for his bookshelves, or leave prank calls on his answering machine. But forgetting to turn off the heater is really dangerous, so you've gotta be careful! Edgeworth: (Some of those things had nothing to do with forgetfulness...) John. Please continue. John: Looks like you've got it rough too, old man. Well, back to my story...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: It was late at night at the film lot... and not a single member of the film crew was around. So then, why did you have to leave the premises in order to answer the phone call? John: I totally forgot about the phone call thing... so I kinda panicked. If I didn't answer it fast, I would have been busted for leaving the hotel without permission. Edgeworth: In that case, why didn't you just answer it here? John: B-Because I was rehearsing, all the cameras and mics were on. If I talked here, every last word I said to Mom would've been caught on camera! Edgeworth: (So he was embarrassed that the conversation with his mother would be recorded.) John: Anyways, I stopped practicing for a bit and rushed out of the film lot.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: In that phone call, you lied and said you were at the hotel, correct? Kay: Why didn't you tell your mom that you were rehearsing? John: If I told her that, she would've called the hotel and made them send me a taxi or something. Courtney: Courtney: Of course I would have! A child alone on the streets at the time of night... What sort of parent would allow their child to be in such a dangerous situation!? Edgeworth: Hmm. I guess kids just don't understand how their parents feel. Kay: It goes both ways, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: ...Indeed. Now then, John. Please tell us about what happened after the phone call. John: Huh? O-Oh yeah. Of course. When the call was finished and I came back here...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Was there any indication that the head was about to fall? John: ...I-I don't know. I was focused on my rehearsal. Edgeworth: So you forgot to turn off the heater, which led to a fire on the roof. I would think you should have at least heard something. John: Heard something...? Oh, I was wearing headphones, so... Edgeworth: Headphones? John: Listening to the movie's soundtrack helps me get into the scene... I had it on full blast. That's why I didn't hear anything. Edgeworth: And yet, you noticed your mother's incoming call? John: I had my phone on vibrate, old man. That's how I noticed. Anyways, the head had fallen...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: What was the state of the body? John: ...I didn't get a good look. 'Cause it was dark. ........ Edgeworth: (Hm? He's suddenly become as quiet as a mouse.) Kay: I guess John doesn't really want to remember anything about the body... Edgeworth: (...Is that the only reason why he's gone so quiet? Should I press him for more details?) Press him further Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Leave him be Edgeworth: (It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.) Edgeworth: You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead? John: ! Th-That's... well... Edgeworth: (He's clearly shaken. ...He must be hiding something.) Wouldn't you normally call for help if you see someone collapsed on the ground? However, you did nothing of the sort... John: But... But he...! He was already dead... Edgeworth: Is that so? You seem quite certain that the president was already dead... Now, is there a reason for that, I wonder? John: The guy was collapsed on the ground, and right next to him was the fallen monster's head. I'm not stupid. It wasn't hard to imagine what happened... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You can imagine whatever you want, but there was no way for you to know that he was dead! You actually checked to make sure the president was dead, didn't you? John: Urk.....! Y-Yeah... that's right! I was scared... but I got up close to the body and checked to see if he was breathing. Edgeworth: (I thought as much... However, why would he hide that? There must be a reason...) ...Please tell me the state of the body at that time. John: A-At first, I didn't know he was dead... I would've realized sooner if there had been any blood... ...but there wasn't a single drop, and his clothes were completely spotless. Either way, he wasn't breathing. That's how I knew he was already dead... Edgeworth: ...Would you please append those statements to your testimony? Add statements: \"I didn't know right away that he was dead. There was no blood, and his clothes were spotless.\" and \"But he wasn't breathing at all when I checked, so I knew he was already dead.\" Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Edgeworth: (It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you knew immediately that it was the president? John: Not right away. It was dark, so I had to get a bit closer. But... I knew his face because we worked together briefly, after all. Kay: Y-You worked with the president!? Wow, John...! When did you do that!? Edgeworth: Have you already forgotten, Kay? The president had a cameo in this movie. Kay: Ah! That's right! Of course... N-Now I remember! Edgeworth: Good for you. So, John. You confirmed he was dead?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were unable to tell if he was dead because of the lack of stains on his clothes... Are you certain of that? John: Of course I am. You guys saw the body too, right? So what's the big ideal!? Edgeworth: You said that the area was dark. And yet, you were still able to make that observation? John: I'm telling you, there wasn't a single stain on his entire body! Give it a rest, old man! Edgeworth: Heh... Thank you, John. That was all I needed to hear. Kay: Are clean clothes that important to you, Mr. Edgeworth? Mine are freshly washed though! Edgeworth: Next... could you tell me how you determined that the president was dead? John: Well, there wasn't anything to let me know right away that he was dead, you see...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: How did you check if he had stopped breathing? John: They taught us how at school. You get right up close to the person's nose... ...and check to see if you can feel their breath. I never thought I'd have to do it for real, though... Kay: That was really brave of you, to be able to do something like that. John, you sure are amazing for an elementary school kid. Edgeworth: Kay, he's in middle school. Please try to get that into your head sometime soon...\nKay: It'd be pretty scary to see a corpse just suddenly appear out of the blue like that... Not to mention the fallen monster head lying next to the body.\nEdgeworth: Panic would certainly be an understandable response to such a situation.\nKay: But still, all things considered... This was just an accident, right?\nEdgeworth: Indeed. That is, if we decide to take John's words at face value... (I wouldn't mind having some more concrete details on the state of the crime scene...)",

Oh, I was wearing headphones, so...\nEdgeworth:\nHeadphones?\nJohn:\nListening to the movie's soundtrack helps me get into the scene... I had it on full blast. That's why I didn't hear anything.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd yet, you noticed your mother's incoming call?\nJohn:\nI had my phone on vibrate, old man. That's how I noticed. Anyways, the head had fallen...\nJohn:\nAnd right next to it was the president, lying dead on the ground...\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was the state of the body?\nJohn:\n...I didn't get a good look. 'Cause it was dark. ........\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? He's suddenly become as quiet as a mouse.)\nKay:\nI guess John doesn't really want to remember anything about the body...\nEdgeworth:\n(...Is that the only reason why he's gone so quiet? Should I press him for more details?)\n\n\n\nPress him further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\"\n\n\n\n\nLeave him be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(It must have been a shock to discover the body as he did. I can't blame him for not wanting to talk about it... I'll leave him be for now.)\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\nJohn:\n! Th-That's... well...\nEdgeworth:\n(He's clearly shaken. ...He must be hiding something.) Wouldn't you normally call for help if you see someone collapsed on the ground? However, you did nothing of the sort...\nJohn:\nBut... But he...! He was already dead...\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so? You seem quite certain that the president was already dead... Now, is there a reason for that, I wonder?\n\nJohn:\nThe guy was collapsed on the ground, and right next to him was the fallen monster's head. I'm not stupid. It wasn't hard to imagine what happened...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou can imagine whatever you want, but there was no way for you to know that he was dead! You actually checked to make sure the president was dead, didn't you?\nJohn:\nUrk.....! Y-Yeah... that's right! I was scared... but I got up close to the body and checked to see if he was breathing.\nEdgeworth:\n(I thought as much... However, why would he hide that? There must be a reason...) ...Please tell me the state of the body at that time.\nJohn:\nA-At first, I didn't know he was dead... I would've realized sooner if there had been any blood... ...but there wasn't a single drop, and his clothes were completely spotless. Either way, he wasn't breathing. That's how I knew he was already dead...\nEdgeworth:\n...Would you please append those statements to your testimony?\nAdd statements:\n\"I didn't know right away that he was dead. There was no blood, and his clothes were spotless.\" and \"But he wasn't breathing at all when I checked, so I knew he was already dead.\"\nPress (after fully pressing this statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you knew immediately that it was the president?\nJohn:\nNot right away. It was dark, so I had to get a bit closer. But... I knew his face because we worked together briefly, after all.\nKay:\nY-You worked with the president!? Wow, John...! When did you do that!?\nEdgeworth:\nHave you already forgotten, Kay? The president had a cameo in this movie.\nKay:\nAh! That's right! Of course... N-Now I remember!\nEdgeworth:\nGood for you. So, John. You confirmed he was dead?\nJohn:\nI didn't know right away that he was dead. There was no blood, and his clothes were spotless.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo you were unable to tell if he was dead because of the lack of stains on his clothes... Are you certain of that?\nJohn:\nOf course I am. You guys saw the body too, right? So what's the big ideal!?\nEdgeworth:\nYou said that the area was dark. And yet, you were still able to make that observation?\nJohn:\nI'm telling you, there wasn't a single stain on his entire body! Give it a rest, old man!\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... Thank you, John. That was all I needed to hear.\nKay:\nAre clean clothes that important to you, Mr. Edgeworth? Mine are freshly washed though!\nEdgeworth:\nNext... could you tell me how you determined that the president was dead?\nJohn:\nWell, there wasn't anything to let me know right away that he was dead, you see...\nPresent Crime Scene Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"His clothes were \"spotless\"...?\"\nJohn:\nBut he wasn't breathing at all when I checked, so I knew he was already dead.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHow did you check if he had stopped breathing?\nJohn:\nThey taught us how at school. You get right up close to the person's nose... ...and check to see if you can feel their breath. I never thought I'd have to do it for real, though...\nKay:\nThat was really brave of you, to be able to do something like that. John, you sure are amazing for an elementary school kid.\nEdgeworth:\nKay, he's in middle school. Please try to get that into your head sometime soon...\nKay:\nIt'd be pretty scary to see a corpse just suddenly appear out of the blue like that... Not to mention the fallen monster head lying next to the body.\nEdgeworth:\nPanic would certainly be an understandable response to such a situation.\nKay:\nBut still, all things considered... This was just an accident, right?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. That is, if we decide to take John's words at face value... (I wouldn't mind having some more concrete details on the state of the crime scene...)\nEdgeworth:\nHis clothes were \"spotless\"...?\nJohn:\nY... Yeah, that's right. You got a problem with it, old man?\nEdgeworth:\nJohn. It is painfully obvious that you are desperately trying to hide something from me.\nJohn:\nWh-Wh-What are you going on about!? I-I'm not hiding anything!\nEdgeworth:\nYou are hiding... ...something about this yellow stain on the president's clothes, correct?\nJohn:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy did you leave it entirely out of your testimony? The fact you made no mention of it only serves to cast more suspicion upon yourself!\nJohn:\n...Ugh! Th-That's because...\nEdgeworth:\nI hope you have a convincing explanation.\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\n........\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney?\nCourtney:\nAllow me to explain.\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are you...?\nCourtney:\nThe yellow stain left on the president's chest... ...is almost certainly Lion Lily pollen.\nLang:\nLion Lily...?\nCourtney:\nWhen I met with the president on the roof of the Grand Tower two nights ago... ...I brought him a bouquet of Lion Lilies. Lion Lilies are beautiful flowers with stunning golden petals. Some of the pollen from the lilies must have gotten on the president's suit.\nKay:\nHuh? But... ...I didn't see any lilies in the security footage though?\nCourtney:\nThey were simply obscured by the president's body.\nEdgeworth:\nWhy did you bring a bouquet?\nCourtney:\nTh-That..... I... I cannot say.\nLang:\nLang:\nHey, hey! You're keeping way too many secrets! You won't tell us why you met with the president OR the reason you brought him flowers!?\nCourtney:\n.....My apologies. However, I did give him the bouquet. That much is true.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nBut when the president's body was discovered, we didn't find any flowers.\nCourtney:\nI... I honestly don't know how that could be...\nLang:\nHah! Hey, Ms. Judge! All your answers have been too vague... You \"can't say\" this, and you \"don't know\" that! Do you accept flimsy testimony like that in your trials!?\nJohn:\nHey! Cut it out!\nCourtney:\nJ... John!\nJohn:\nI... threw the flowers away.\nEdgeworth:\nYou threw them away? So, there were flowers near the body when you found it?\nJohn:\n.....Yeah, that's right. They were right on top of the president's body. They had been crushed as flat as pancakes, though...\nKay:\nAh! I see! So the flowers were squashed by Moozilla's head too...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd a large amount of pollen got stuck to the president's suit. ...That seems to be the gist of it. However, why did you go out of your way to dispose of the flowers?\nJohn:\n..........No reason.\nEdgeworth:\n(So John's not going to tell us anything either...)\nKay:\nI guess mother and son both have a lot of secrets, huh.\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nThat is not true. At the very least, I can tell you why John threw away those flowers.\nKay:\nHuh!?\nCourtney:\nJohn. You saw me leaving the house with those flowers in hand, did you not?\nJohn:\n........\nKay:\nAh! I get it! John saw the flowers and thought of his mom!\nEdgeworth:\n...He threw them away in order to protect Judge Courtney from being suspected.\nJohn:\nTh-That's not true. You're all wrong!\nEdgeworth:\n(...That was his worst lie yet...)\nBouquet data jotted down in my Organizer.\nCrime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer.\nCourtney:\nI often decorate our house with those flowers. The bouquet must have reminded him of me.\nLang:\nSo the pup just happens to find the flowers from his mother's bouquet on top of the body... That's why he threw them away and kept silent about the body? Hah! That's a tidy little story if I've ever heard one.\nKay:\nAnd what's wrong with that!? I suppose you prefer untidy, messy stories, Agent Lang?\nLang:\nDon't tell me you've forgotten already, Missy? This pup confessed that he caused the monster's head to fall last night.\nKay:\nOooh... That's true, but...\nLang:\nHe's currently the only suspect in the president's murder!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm. It is true that there are many reasons to suspect John...) ...However! There is someone other than John who is far more suspicious!\nLang:\nWhat'd you say?\nEdgeworth:\nJohn himself was kidnapped by that very person not too long ago.\nGumshoe:\nAnd we rescued him from the refrigerated warehouse near the harbor, pal!\nLang:\nA refrigerated warehouse?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal! The refrigeration wasn't turned on, so he wasn't about to freeze to death... ...but if he hadn't yelled out for help, we would've never found him.\nKay:\nOnce the sleeping drugs wore off, he was finally able to call out for help.\nEdgeworth:\nSleeping drugs... huh. If I recall correctly, when you were kidnapped...\nKay:\nThat's right! There was a bottle lying on the floor of the refrigerated warehouse... I think it was the same thing that was used one me not long ago. That Sleepy zZz stuff! It's super powerful!\nSleeping Drugs data jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nHow about it, Agent Lang? John is clearly a victim. There is a mastermind at work behind the scenes of this case.\nLang:\nLang:\nI don't know anything about this so-called \"mastermind\". You say they were here last night?\nEdgeworth:\nI... still don't know for sure yet...\nLang:\nHah! It's not like you to be so vague, Mr. Prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Indeed, I still don't have any evidence that ties the mastermind to this murder... Is there someone else? Is there anyone besides John who had the opportunity to murder the president...? That's it...!)\nLang:\n...As I thought. In the end, that pup is our only suspect.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIsn't there one more suspect, Agent Lang...?\nLang:\nWhat's this!?\nEdgeworth:\nDidn't we prove it earlier? Last night, there was one more person here!\nLang:\n.....Blaise Debeste. You're saying he's the one who did it?\nEdgeworth:\nLast night, John was not alone. Blaise Debeste was here too. Shouldn't we consider him to be a new suspect?\nLang:\nBlaise Debeste... killed the president!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's entirely possible.\nLang:\n........ .....Blaise Debeste... It can't be...! The same guy from 12 years ago?\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? 12 years ago? That keeps popping up...)\nLang:\n......Well. A lot has changed. It all happened over 12 years ago. Back then, he and my old man were close friends, and our clan protected the president's life.\nRoland:\nLang...? Don't tell me you're... the one from 12 years ago...?\nLang:\nYou got it. Ain't this nice? Now you're finally going to prison, where you belong. Twelve years is a long time coming for a suspended sentence. Don't you agree?\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang! What happened 12 years ago?\nLang:\n.....Nothing that concerns you.\nEdgeworth:\nOn the contrary. It might just have some sort of connection with this case.\nLang:\nLang:\n.....Hmph. And I suppose you have some proof, Mr. Prosecutor? Show me evidence that there's a connection between this case and the one 12 years ago!\nEdgeworth:\nEvidence... you say?\nLang:\nIf you don't have any evidence, then there's no point in talking about it.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is there any evidence that connects this case with what happened 12 years ago?)\nPresent Letter from Unknown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis letter was sent to Jill Crane, who was murdered two days ago. Although the sender is currently unknown... Here, it is written as follows: \"Please get revenge for 12 years ago\".\nLang:\nWhat!? 12 years ago!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not all. Take a look at this as well. This is a report written by Patricia Roland to Blaise Debeste regarding Knightley. ...Please read this part here.\nLang:\n\"That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago\"...?\nLeads to:\n\"Agent Lang... Something big is happening here.\"\nPresent Report on Knightley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a report written by Patricia Roland to Blaise Debeste regarding Knightley. ...Please read this part here.\nLang:\n\"That thing he laid to rest near the flowerbed 12 years ago\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not all.

Something big is happening here.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang. Could you take a look at this?\nLang:\nMr. Prosecutor, get that thing out of my face! Lang Zi says: \"The sun sets fast in Zheng Fa...\" We don't have time to waste looking at your useless junk!\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (So this doesn't show the connection...)\nKay:\nLet's look over the evidence one more time, Mr. Edgeworth! Wasn't there something written about 12 years ago somewhere in there?\nLang:\nHow about it, Mr. Prosecutor? Got any evidence?\nLeads back to:\n\"(Is there any evidence that connects this case with what happened 12 years ago?)\"\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang... Something big is happening here. Jill Crane's murder two days ago. And now, the president's murder today. There has to be some connection there. And the key to solving it lies in what happened 12 years ago, does it not?\nLang:\n......You're asking me to reopen the old wounds of the Lang clan?\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang. I beg of you.\nLang:\n........\nEdgeworth:\n(Who was that just now?)\n???:\nShifu!\nLang:\nY-You guys! What are you all doing here!?\nMIB:\nWe followed you here, Shifu! We heard that Shifu was investigating the incident from 12 years ago...\nLang:\nYou idiots...! I'm not your boss anymore. Get back to your own posts!\nMIB:\nSir......... We can't do that!\nLang:\nWhat'd you say? Are you disobeying my order?\nMIB:\nShifu! We also beg of you! Reinvestigate... the SS-5 Incident from 12 years ago! None of us could ever forget that case! We know you feel the same way, Shifu...\nLang:\n........\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang. Even your former subordinates desire to reinvestigate the case.\nLang:\nAnd you think you can solve the mysteries of that case?\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps I can... with your help.\nLang:\nTch! ...I got it. I accept your invitation.\nMIB:\nShifu! Shifu! Shifu!\nKay:\nNow then! With that decided, I guess it's my turn to shine!\nEdgeworth:\nKay?\nKay:\nWe're investigating a case from the past, right? And guess what the best tool for that is?\nEdgeworth:\nThe Little Mr. Thief...\nKay:\nRight! If we have the case files from the past case, I can re-create it!\nLang:\nUnfortunately... I don't have the case files.\nKay:\nHuh!? What do you mean?\nLang:\nAccess to those case files is restricted. It's being treated as highly classified information.\nEdgeworth:\nWhy is that?\nLang:\nI don't know, but it seems like there were a lot of things that they wanted to keep hidden. Even what I know... ...is limited to what was published in the newspapers back then.\nEdgeworth:\nThat will not be a problem. In any case, please tell us what you know.\nLang:\nSure... The SS-5 Incident... The incident occurred on a winter day 12 years ago... It was the 10th of February. The police department in this country received a call from a group of kidnappers. \"We've kidnapped President Huang\" ...they said.\nEdgeworth:\nKidnapped?\nLang:\nThe SS-5 Incident was the case of President Huang's kidnapping. They demanded a ransom of 100 million dollars.\nKay:\n100 million!? ...Wait, just how much is that?\nEdgeworth:\n(It's such a large amount, she's having trouble visualizing it.)\nLang:\nThat night, my old man was the last person to meet with the president. They were together at the Zheng Fa embassy until midnight on February 10th. After that, no one knows what the president was doing up until he was kidnapped. With the president's life at stake, the Zheng Fa government frantically gathered the money. After that, the ransom was delivered and the president was returned safe and sound.\nKay:\nSo... President Huang has been the president since 12 years ago. That's really amazing.\nLang:\nWell... being in office for so long is just a small part of how amazing the man is.\nEdgeworth:\n(Lang seemed a bit happy when he said that.) And, what happened to the kidnappers?\nLang:\nWell, a top secret covert investigation was carried out, then a secret trial was held.\nEdgeworth:\nA trial? Does that mean the suspect was caught?\nLang:\nThe suspect was... Patricia Roland.\nEdgeworth:\n! Then, the reason you came to the prison a few days ago...\nLang:\nYeah. I was put on extended leave from Interpol... ...so I decided to go back and reinvestigate what happened 12 years ago. First, I had to get a look at the face of my target.\nCourtney:\n...So the trial 12 years ago ended with a Not Guilty verdict.\nLang:\nYeah... Back then, my old man was in charge of every aspect of the president's security. He took responsibility for the kidnapping and was relieved of his post as bodyguard... ...but he continued to investigate as a regular police officer, until... he finally found the culprit. And it was none other than Patricia Roland. There was no way she could be innocent! However, the result was a Not Guilty verdict. In the end, the case went unsolved... Crushed in both body and soul... my old man resigned from the police.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was the basis for arresting Patricia Roland?\nLang:\nThere was a lot of evidence. At least, that's what I think. But, I can't see those documents for myself... ...so that's where my story ends.\nKay:\nWhat should we do? With only this much information... ...even the Little Thief would have a hard time producing a re-creation.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ngh... Is there really nothing we can do...?)\n???:\nLooks like you could use some help.\nLang:\nWho's that?\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska!\nKay:\nAnd Mr. Shields too!\nRay:\nWe finished up with the trial and finally managed to catch up with you guys.\nFranziska:\nHere, take this.\nEdgeworth:\nThis is...?\nGumshoe:\nAh! It's the case files for the SS-5 Incident, sir!\nSS-5 Incident Files jotted down in my Organizer.\nFranziska:\nWhen Roland mentioned \"12 years ago\" during the trial, it caught my interest. I looked into it immediately, and got it touch with Interpol.\nEdgeworth:\nI expected no less from you, Franziska.\nFranziska:\n...Don't get the wrong idea, Miles Edgeworth. I didn't prepare these documents for you, the former prosecutor. I did it for the sake of the investigator taking up the case his father left behind.\nLang:\nSis...! But, I thought information on the SS-5 Incident was restricted to the public.\nFranziska:\nThat restriction was placed by the prosecutor in charge of the case: Blaise Debeste.\nEdgeworth:\nBlaise Debeste was the prosecutor in charge!?\nLang:\nHim...!\nFranziska:\nHowever... ...as a result of the trial just now, Blaise's authority has been revoked. It's all thanks to his son...\nEdgeworth:\nSebastian...? (By bringing down his father, the door to this past case has been opened.)\nFranziska:\nProsecutor Debeste is currently wrapping things up in Patricia Roland's trial. He told me to relay this message to you. \"Leave Pops and his cohorts to me. You guys just take care of the case on your end.\"\nEdgeworth:\nHeh. He's become quite reliable, right before our very eyes...\nCourtney:\nTruly...\nKay:\nAlrighty then! This is perfect! Now that we have the files, just leave the re-creation to me!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. Well then, let us begin. According to these documents... ...it appears that the incident took place right in front of the Tower Plaza.\nKay:\nThen let's head to the plaza right away!\nApril 6, 3:25 PMOutside Grand TowerTower Plaza\nEdgeworth:\nKay. Would you please activate the Little Mr. Thief?\nKay:\nRight! With these case files, re-creating everything should be a snap! Where should I start?\nEdgeworth:\nWhere indeed. According to these documents... ...it seems there was a witness to the kidnapping of the president. A freelance journalist by the name of Jack Cameron. However... ...he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and was murdered by the culprit...\nLang:\nSo that would mean the place he saw the president at was here.\nKay:\nHere? ...At the Grand Tower?\nEdgeworth:\nNo. The Grand Tower was only built around a year ago, Kay. Before that, this place contained mostly old abandoned buildings. However, 12 years ago, this place was...\nLang:\nHah! Now you're finally talking about some stuff that I know.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nLang:\nYeah... 12 years ago, at the very spot was... ...the Happy Family Home.\nGumshoe:\nWhat's that, pal?\nLang:\nIt was a place where children who had lost their parents could live... ...or to put ot simply, it was an orphanage.\nEdgeworth:\nSo the president was kidnapped at that orphanage...\nLang:\n...and, the head of that facility at the time was Patricia Roland. ...Apparently, Roland always referred to it as her Home.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nCourtney:\nIt seems that suspicion would naturally fall upon her...\nEdgeworth:\n(Patricia Roland, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang... The darkness that remains from the SS-5 Incident still casts a shadow on the present case.) Kay, I'd like you to input the investigation data from Jack Cameron's murder case. We can probably assume that he was killed by one of the kidnappers.\nKay:\nSo if we solve the murder case, we'll know who the kidnappers were, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. I'm counting on you.\nJohn:\nWh-What the heck is this!? Everything's green!\nEdgeworth:\n(I've come to expect such reactions...) This is a re-creation of the grounds of the facility that stood here 12 years ago... ...based on the documents from the police investigation.\nKay:\nI re-created the scene to show what it looked like when police arrived at 7 AM the next day!\nEdgeworth:\n...It appears a fair amount of snow had piled up here.\nLang:\nYeah. I heard that the footprints in the snow were prime pieces of evidence. The snow fell during the day, on the day of the incident.\nEdgeworth:\n(So the snow only fell before the crime took place... ...which means the footprints wouldn't have been erased by any further snow. I must make sure to pay close attention to these footprints.)\nBegin Investigation\nOrphanageFront Yard\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Three footprints\" and \"Flowerbeds\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps this is the true nature of the monster's footprints...\nKay:\nTrue nature?\nEdgeworth:\nCompare the positions of the three footprints and the three flowerbeds on the left.\nKay:\nAh!\nEdgeworth:\nThe exposed areas of dirt match the areas where the flowerbeds were!\nKay:\nSo Blaise dug holes in front of where each of the three flowerbeds used to be...\nEdgeworth:\nExactly. Now, why would he do such a thing? I believe we have a piece of evidence that tells us why. Why did Blaise dig holes in the ground near the flowerbeds?\n\n\n\nPresent Report on Knightley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The report from Patricia Roland to Blaise Debeste.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the reason why Blaise dug holes in the ground near the flowerbeds!\nKay:\nAha! ...So, what does this tell us?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Isn't it obvious?\nKay:\nNo, it's not!\nEdgeworth:\nObviously, this tells us absolutely nothing at all!\nKay:\nPlease be more serious, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n...Mmph! (Well, that wasn't it.)\nKay:\nLet's take another look at the evidence! There must be something in there!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. There must be some piece of evidence that explains Blaise's actions.\nLeads back to:\n\"Why did Blaise dig holes in the ground near the flowerbeds?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe report from Patricia Roland to Blaise Debeste. It said that something was \"laid to rest in front of the flowerbed\".\nKay:\nSo Blaise was following Ms. Roland's instructions to dig it up? But, why would he dig up three holes?\nEdgeworth:\nThe report didn't state which of three flowerbeds the item was in front of.\nKay:\nOh. So Blaise didn't know exactly where to dig... That's why he had to dig up all three spots!\nEdgeworth:\nMost likely, yes. I'm sure Blaise himself was none too happy about that.\nKay:\nHe went through all that trouble. I wonder what he was trying to dig up (What did Blaise dig up? - Instructed by Patricia, something was dug up near the flowerbeds...?)?\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nYeah, what's up?\n\n\n\nNotice anything?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nSo there was an orphanage here 12 years ago! And what's more, the head of the orphanage was Ms. Roland. Talk about a surprise!\nEdgeworth:\nSo that means this was where the SS-5 Incident occurred 12 years ago.\nKay:\nThe one where the president of Zheng Fa was kidnapped, right?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. And the only witness, Jack Cameron, was then subsequently murdered. However, when you consider that this case was classified as top secret...\nKay:\n...it starts to smell fishy, like there's something hidden behind this case! Even so, the people involved in this incident... Aren't they all people that we already know?\nEdgeworth:\n(Patricia Roland, Blaise Debeste, and the president of Zheng Fa...) The cases that we've been involved in recently, and the SS-5 Incident... It's hard to think they're not related.\nKay:\nLet's steal the truth hidden behind this case! I'll keep updating the info if we find out anything new, so... ...let's focus on the areas that have changed in the re-creation.\n\n\n\n\nLittle Thief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nTo think that your Little Mr. Thief would help us out once again.\nKay:\nIt's just \"Little Thief\"! And now matter how useful Little Thief is... ...if there's an error with the info, the re-creation could come out a bit strange. If you find anything strange, please present some evidence!\nEdgeworth:\nSo I can examine things like I normally do, even if it's just a re-creation?\nKay:\nYup! Please go all out and investigate every suspicious-looking nook and cranny! I don't have enough data to do it now, but... ...once you gather enough info, I can re-create the scene at a different moment in time.\nEdgeworth:\nAlright. I'll ask for your help when the time comes.\nKay:\nIs that so? But in science, a bit of danger always comes with the territory...\nEdgeworth:\n(That's not exactly what you would call \"a bit of danger\"!)\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSS-5 Incident Files, Cameron's Autopsy Report, Cameron's Testimony or Cameron's Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThis is a case that's gone on for over 12 years? That's a really long time... Back then, I was just a small kid. Mr. Lang and his clan have been agonizing and suffering all this time... We definitely have to solve this case. I'll do my best as well!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. I'll ask you to check the case files when necessary.\nKay:\nRight! I'll read every word loudly and with great feeling!\nEdgeworth:\n(No, there's no need to put such emotion into it...)\n\n\n\n\nFire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nHmm, it looks like only this section of the front yard was burned by the spilled kerosene. It seems there was no damage to the building itself.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. That's why it didn't turn into a bigger incident.\nKay:\nBut, the kid should of known better. There are some pranks that you can and can't do!\nEdgeworth:\n(While that's certainly true... ...I doubt the kid would want to hear that from someone calling herself the Great Thief.)\nSwing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a swing decorated with the face of an elephant. It looks like there's some kind of motor attached to the other side of the elephant.\nKay:\nThere's one thought that has crossed the minds of every top-class swinger. If only I could do a full 360˚... With that powerful motor rotating the swing, that dream can finally be achieved!\nEdgeworth:\nRotating, with a motor... But, wouldn't that be dangerous?\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth. You can't fulfill your dreams unless you're willing to take some risks.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is that the real problem here...?)\nJohn Marsh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn:\n...What d'ya want?\n\n\n\nThe kidnapping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nJohn. I'd like you to tell me the exact details of your kidnapping.\nKay:\nYou were kidnapped at the garbage pickup area, right? Why'd you go there?\nJohn:\nYou don't have to act as a go-between. I can just talk to the old man directly.\nKay:\n...So he says. Looks like he's finally starting to warm up to you!\nJohn:\nI went to the garbage pickup to throw away the flowers I found on the body. It was nearby, and I thought it'd be harder to find there than if I just tossed them in a trash can. I went there last night too, but the gate was locked.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that's why you went there again today to dispose of them.\nJohn:\nYeah. But when I got there, someone suddenly grabbed me from behind...\nKay:\n...and used Sleepy zZz on you, right? \"Catching Z's is now super easy with Sleepy zZz!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(Even though she was also a victim to it, she seems to have taken a liking to the slogan...)\nJohn:\nWhoever grabbed me was really strong. But that's all I know... I have no idea who it was.\nEdgeworth:\nI see. So that's what happened.\n\n\n\n\nThe place of captivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAfter the drugs wore off... did you notice anything about your surroundings?\nKay:\n\"Those drugs were brought to you by Sleepy zZz. Catching Z's is now super easy with Sleepy zZz!\"\nJohn:\nIt was kinda cold when I woke up. I was in a dark, empty room. Boxes with foreign writing on them were lying around. So I figured I was in a warehouse.\nKay:\nThe whole place was like a giant refrigerator. It was a commercial warehouse.\nEdgeworth:\n(That's right, John was rescued thanks to the collective efforts of Kay and Detective Gumshoe.)\nJohn:\nSince it was still a bit cold, the cooling unit's power must not have been cut for too long. For some reason, they didn't think to take my phone, so... ...I used it to call for help.\nEdgeworth:\nI see. In any case, it's good that you're safe and sound, John.\nJohn:\nHmph. I don't need your fake sympathy, old man.\nEdgeworth:\n(...What an incorrigible child.)\nKay:\nHe's just like a certain someone I know!\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBouquet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn:\n...That's right, I was trying to protect my mom. But, what's so wrong about that!?\nEdgeworth:\nYour desire to protect your mother is rather admirable. However, the same can't be said for your perjury.\nJohn:\nHmph. Call it what you want! There's no way I could stand by and do nothing while my Mom was being suspected!\nCourtney:\nJ-John...! You...\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth was only praising your bravery. He's also saying it would've been better if you were a bit more honest about it... That about sums it up! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nUmm... W-Well, more or less.\nKay:\nAnd aren't you glad that he praised you, John?\nJohn:\nHmph... W-Well, I guess. More or less...\nJustine Courtney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney:\nPlease, ask me anything you wish.\n\n\n\nJohn Marsh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney:\nYou have my heartfelt thanks for bringing John back. Oh... even the thought of him not coming back makes me...\nJohn:\nHey, old man! Don't bully my mom!\nEdgeworth:\nN-No, that wasn't my intention...\nKay:\nWhoo, look at him go! Mommy's little knight in shining armor! He's so cool!\nJohn:\nI-It's not like that! Quit blabbering stupid stuff about me...\nCourtney:\nJohn, please wait. May I proceed, Mr. Edgeworth? My actions were unbecoming of one who calls herself a servant of the Goddess of Law. I won't ask for forgiveness. However... I...\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney. I am not as well acquainted with the Goddess of Law as you are. However... isn't that goddess also a mother of other gods?\nCourtney:\n...Ah!\nEdgeworth:\nThe law makes exceptions for extenuating circumstances. It understands a mother's heart. I'd say perhaps your Goddess sympathizes with you more than you think.\nCourtney:\nM... Mr. Edgeworth...!\nJohn:\nI don't get it... What the heck are you two blabbering about?\nKay:\nIt's OK, John. I don't have a clue either!\n\n\n\n\nPatricia's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems the durst has settled on day one of Patricia Roland's trial.\nCourtney:\nYes. While a decision has yet to be reached, I would say a Guilty verdict is quite likely. I'm sure a thorough investigation into her connection with Blaise will be conducted as well. ...After seeing Sebastian today, I know we can put our faith in him.\nEdgeworth:\nJust like Kay, Sebastian is also in the midst of training for the future ahead.\nKay:\nHmmm, I see. When you say it like that, I guess we have more in common than I thought. I said a few mean things to him, so the next time we meet, I'd like to apologize to him.\nCourtney:\nI'm sure you will get your opportunity. But, for now...\nEdgeworth:\nYes. At present, solving this case is our top priority.\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYatagarasu's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney:\nThe young lady there seems to have made a full recovery.\nKay:\nYup. When you returned my father's notebook... ...I was able to return to my old self! Thank you so very much!\nCourtney:\nThink nothing of it. I did not do anything. The return of your notebook and the return of your memories... They were all simply the works of the Goddess of Law.\nEdgeworth:\n(I don't think either of those things had any relevance to the law...)\n\n\n\n\nLetter from Unknown, Grand Tower, Mechanic's Gloves,Report on Knightley or Knightley's Mementos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney:\nThe incident at the Grand Tower... It is utterly inexcusable. How dare someone commit such an impure act in the presence of the Goddess of Law.\nKay:\nIt really is unforgivable! I'd like to give 'em a good whack with your gavel!\nCourtney:\nMs. Faraday. Even if the person is a criminal... ...that does not give us the right to mete out punishment outside of the law.\nKay:\nNot even just a light tap?\nCourtney:\nCertainly not.\nEdgeworth:\nKay. That is what Prosecutors and Judges are for. Don't worry, we will be sure to bring them to justice.\nKay:\nHmm, alright then. Let's follow this investigation down to the end! That's one of my rules!\nEdgeworth:\n(...I thought you had promises, not rules?)\n\n\n\n\nMonster Movie Flyer, Commemorative Photo or John's Practice Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney:\nSeeing John's performance on the silver screen... I always look forward to it.\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney. About that...\nCourtney:\n\nCourtney:\nIn fact, until I personally go and see John's movies in the theaters... ...I try to avoid learning any information about them. Please, let us not talk about it.\nEdgeworth:\nNo, Judge Courtney. That wasn't what I...\nCourtney:\n\nCourtney:\nAlthough I've already come to learn a little about the plot in the course of this case... ...if you intend to divulge any more details, be prepared to face the wrath of the Goddess of Law!\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems the Goddess of Law does not take spoilers lightly...)\n\n\n\n\nCrime Scene Notes, Moozilla's Head, Moozilla Doll, Security Camera Photo or Bouquet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney:\nI suppose you would like me to tell you... ...what exactly took place two nights ago, and my reason for meeting with the president.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. I'm sure you yourself understand the importance of this matter.\nCourtney:\nYes..... However, I cannot tell you yet. Not now, at least.\nEdgeworth:\n(She's determined to keep her heart closed. And without the ability to break the locks in her heart... ...I have no choice but to give up for now.)\nCourtney:\n...Mr. Edgeworth. May I just say one thing? This case was thrown into chaos because John tried to cover for me. I would like to take this time to offer my deepest apologies.\nEdgeworth:\nDo not worry yourself. My logic won't be swayed by a child's lies. Besides... (...I'm not so tactless as to condemn a child for trying to protect his mother.)\nCourtney:\nBesides... you were saying?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, pay it no mind. (Mother and child... huh.)\n\n\n\n\nIS-7 Incident Documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney:\n18 years ago, Blaise Debeste was the Chief Prosecutor. His tacit approval allowed forged evidence to become the truth.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd as a result... many people have suffered over these past 18 years.\nCourtney:\nThat one who was tasked with upholding the law would violate it to serve his own needs... I jointed the P.I.C. in order to correct this vulgar distortion of the law. However... just recently, even I have wavered from that path...\nEdgeworth:\nYour son was taken hostage. ...It would be more concerning if your heart had not wavered.\nCourtney:\n.......I am glad that you and Sebastian were able to discover the truth. Truly, you have my thanks.\n\n\n\n\nSS-5 Incident Files, Cameron's Autopsy Report, Cameron's Testimony or Cameron's Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney:\nBlaise Debeste and Patricia Roland are both connected to this case. That much we know for sure.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. However, it seems there's more to it than that.\nCourtney:\nJill Crane and President Huang. The key to understanding the link between their deaths... ...lies here as well.\nEdgeworth:\n(The connection between them is tenuous at best... For that reason, we must tread carefully to follow it to its conclusion.)\nKay:\nIn that case, we should take our time and carefully examine every nook and cranny! I even just replaced the Little Thief's batteries with new ones!\nEdgeworth:\n(...It runs on batteries?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney:\nWhat is this? Do you wish for me to crush it with my gavel?\nEdgeworth:\nA-Absolutely not!\nCourtney:\nIt was merely a joke. The Goddess of Law does not permit this gavel to be used trivially.\nEdgeworth:\n(...You looked quite serious about it though.)\nLotta Hart and Nicole Swift\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nWhat a scoop! Would ya look at that! Those folks have done turned green!\nNicole:\nMaybe they're sick or somethin'? But their clothes are green too...\nLotta:\nWell, I'll be! Their clothes are all green too! I reckon this ain't no ordinary disease! Ya picked up on somethin' good. Looks like yer takin' it to the next level!\nNicole:\nY-Yes, Chief!\nKay:\n...It looks like there's no way we'll be getting a word in.\nEdgeworth:\n(Not that I have any desire to intervene.)\nBurnt pillar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis pillar appears to be burnt...\nKay:\nAccording to the files, it seems there was a fire on the evening of the incident.\nEdgeworth:\nA fire?\nKay:\nUmm. Let's see here... huh!? It says that one of the children at the orphanage spilled kerosene and set it on fire as a prank.\nEdgeworth:\nI guess that kid had far too much energy... And thanks to that, we can't make out any of the footprints near the main hall...\nFire data jotted down in my Organizer.\nFlowerbed with yellow flower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA flowerbed...?\nKay:\nAccording to the data, this facility had three gardens... ...and each of these gardens contained three flowerbeds (Flowerbeds - Facility had three gardens. Each one had three square-shaped flowerbeds.).\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? The way these flowerbeds are lined up... Have I seen this arrangement somewhere before...?)\nKay:\nSince it was during the winter, there were no flowers in bloom. What a shame!\nEdgeworth:\nHm? What's this yellow flower?\nKay:\nHuh? Why is there a single flower here?\nFranziska:\nThat is a Lion Lily. It's a very rare type of lily.\nEdgeworth:\nDid you say Lion Lily?\nKay:\nThat's the flower Ms. Courtney gave to the president!\nEdgeworth:\n(What's it doing here? Could it be... just a coincidence?)\nFranziska:\nIf I recall, the Lion Lily originates from Asia. In the language of flowers, it means \"the bond between parent and child\"...\nEdgeworth:\nI never knew you were so familiar with flowers.\nFranziska:\nThat much is common sense. You're simply lacking in your studies, Miles Edgeworth.\nFootprints on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese footprints stop near the body.\nKay:\nThey must be Mr. Cameron's footprints. He sure has some big feet! They look like a size 11! According to the data, his shoes matched these footprints!\nDoor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nTh... This door! I remember seeing it from somewhere!\nEdgeworth:\nOf course you would. It looks exactly like the Grand Tower door we saw earlier.\nKay:\nBut, this is a re-creation from 12 years ago! That means this door has been here since then.\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems when the Grand Tower was built, they decided to reuse the door, rather than destroy it.\nKay:\nIt's like the old saying goes, \"Discover something new by hearing up something old.\"\nEdgeworth:\n(Oh. It seems she's understood the correct meaning of a saying for once.)\nKay:\nHmm... But if you're using a microwave to do it, don't heat it for over 5 minutes.\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the eyewitness of the president's kidnapping, Jack Cameron... (What exactly did he witness?)\nKay:\nI've re-created the state of his body based on the photos taken by the police.\nEdgeworth:\nIt appears he was struck in the head from behind.\nKay:\nThe murder weapon was a brick, right? It looks like the ones from this garden.\nEdgeworth:\n(The blood that flowed from his head has splattered all over the surroundings.)\nKay:\nHere! Take this! It's Mr. Cameron's autopsy report!\nCameron's Autopsy Report jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\nBefore examining cell phone, body, camera and brick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nAfter examining cell phone, body, camera and brick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nYellow flower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nA yellow flower has fallen here. ...In the language of flowers, it means \"a stolen treasure\".\nEdgeworth:\nKay. Please stop making things up. Still, this flower seems to be of a different variety from the ones growing nearby.\nKay:\nHmm. Well then, why is it in a place like this?\nEdgeworth:\n(This bothers me a little... We should examine the flowerbed itself after this.)\nKay:\nI knew it, someone must've stolen this from somewhere and brought it here!\nEdgeworth:\n...Kay.\nKay:\nAnd in the language of flowers, this means \"an angry prosecutor\".\n\n\n\n\nYellow flower (after examining flowerbed with yellow flower)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nA yellow flower has fallen here. ...It's called a \"lion lily\".\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. Franziska told us earlier. Apparently, it comes from Asia.\nKay:\nYup. In the language of flowers, I think it means... the \"bond between partners in crime\".\nEdgeworth:\n(...It's the \"bond between parent and child\".)\n\n\n\n\nShoes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe key to this case lies in the footprints. Do the case files say anything about his shoes?\nKay:\nUmm, shoe size:11. No athlete's foot or corns on his feet to speak of. His socks were beige, just like his trousers. Feels kind of like an old man's. Perhaps he should try wearing a bolder, brighter color to better accent his feet? ...Huh. Those fashion tips were surprisingly helpful.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's supposed to be an investigation report, though...)\n\n\n\n\nCell phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI assume this is the victim's cell phone.\nKay:\nThat's right! Umm, apparently Mr. Cameron gave his eyewitness testimony over the cell phone.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean by \"over the cell phone\"?\nLang:\nAfter Cameron found the president, it seems that he called his girlfriend. But she didn't answer the phone, so Cameron left a message on her answering machine.\nKay:\nThe tape is in the case files too. You wanna hear it?\nEdgeworth:\nPlease.\n\n\nCameron:\nHello, Jill? Are you asleep already? I'm in front of the facility now, but... something's not right. President Huang is here of all places. And what's more... Crap. The light just went off. I can barely see a thing now. I can't believe it, but it almost looks like he's being kidnapped. I thought I'd let you know...\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was that sound at the end...?\nLang:\nIt seems he was attacked while he was still on the phone.\nCourtney:\nAgent Lang, may I ask... ...what was the name of Mr. Cameron's beloved?\nLang:\nI'm pretty sure I heard her name was Jill Crane.\nCourtney:\nSo, it was true...\nKay:\nD-Did you say Jill!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis was why she was seeking revenge for 12 long years...\n\n\nCourtney:\nThe feelings and the items Ms. Crane inherited from her beloved... ...brought her to the auction. She had come to exact revenge on the Conductor... Blaise.\n\n\nKay:\nBut, Ms. Crane tried to get revenge on Blaise, right?\nEdgeworth:\nShe may have wanted to get revenge on him for covering up the kidnapping case. Or perhaps she thought Blaise himself was the kidnapper.\nCameron's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nJack Cameron was a freelance journalist. He was killed because he witnessed the president's kidnapping.\nKay:\nThe blood really stands out in the re-creation. It's giving me the heebie-jeebies...\nEdgeworth:\nEven in the original photo, it looks brutal enough. ...A lot of blood was spilled. The back of his head is covered in blood. That must be where all the blood spilled from.\nKay:\nAccording to the autopsy report, he was struck in the back of the head with a brick...\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. It's likely that the killer approached Mr. Cameron from behind. Hm? Is the victim holding something in his right hand?\nKay:\nThat's also written in the case files! Umm... It seems he was holding onto a button.\nEdgeworth:\n(A button? Did he tear it off the culprit's clothes?)\nBloodstain Button data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nCamera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. The victim was carrying a camera.\nKay:\nOh! According to the case files, it seems he only managed to take a single photo. Umm... Here it is!\nEdgeworth:\nTh-This is...!\nKay:\nI-Isn't that the president!?\nEdgeworth:\nHe's being held at gunpoint. (This must be the scene the victim witnessed...!)\nKay:\nSo, the person in the coat must be the kidnapper!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. It seems like some sort of disguise. (If the logic of Agent Lang's father is correct... ...then this person should be Patricia Roland...)\nKay:\nBut, why's there only one photo?\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps he was killed before he could take any more...?\nCameron's Photo data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nBrick\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the brick that was used as the murder weapon (Murder weapon: Brick - Found near Cameron's body. Did it come from the facility grounds?).\nKay:\nYou can find bricks like this all over the garden... They must have used one of them as a weapon.\nFootprints on right side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe footprints here seem to lead to and from the body.\nKay:\nThese footprints were believed to be the culprit's. The shoe size is about a size 7. That's fairly average. It seems we won't be able to tell who the culprit is from these footprints.\nMelted snowman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis... has mostly melted, but it appears to be a snowman?\nKay:\nIt has a scarf and a hat. It must have melted since it was dressed so warmly. The poor thing has even lost one of the buttons that was used for its eyes.\nEdgeworth:\nThe temperature reaches its lowest point at dawn. Perhaps it would have refrozen later.\nKay:\nHe he he. Not so fast, Mr. Edgeworth! Once a snowman melts, even if it freezes up again... ...it becomes an iceman, instead of a snowman!\nEdgeworth:\n(Ngh...! Wh-Whaaaat!? Is that what she was expecting me to say?)\nShi-Long Lang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLang:\n........ Three flowerbeds... and snow...\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang? What's the matter?\nLang:\n...Something's strange. I wasn't able to read the SS-5 Incident case files until now.\nEdgeworth:\nSince Blaise had all access to that information restricted.\nLang:\nYeah, that's right. And yet, I feel like I've seen this exact scene somewhere before...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean?\nLang:\nWhere did I see this? If I could just remember...\nEdgeworth:\n(He looks deep in thought... I should leave him alone for a while.)\n\n\n\nFather and the president\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLang:\nAfter the SS-5 Incident... the president completely changed. Well... He must have felt like his trust had been betrayed. I guess it's only natural. He cut off all ties with the Lang clan, putting an end to our deep bond of trust. My old man wanted to at least apologize in some way... ...so he tried to go see the president more times than I can count. Of course, the president refused to meet with him. He wouldn't even give him the time of day. I don't know if it was from the bodyguards, but there were times he'd come back all beaten up. ...Hmph. But me standing around talking about the past doesn't do jack, does it?\nEdgeworth:\nI shall be the judge of that. For now, just keep telling us what you know.\nLang:\nYou're still as tactless as ever. Well, I figured you'd say as much.\n\n\n\n\nThe SS-5 Incident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLang:\nThe fall of my old man was also the fall of the Lang clan. \"The family that failed to protect the president.\" ...That's what we became. My old man started to investigate the case like he was possessed.\nEdgeworth:\n...Could someone so driven by obsession truly conduct a proper investigation?\nLang:\nSheesh... You really don't pull your punches, Mr. Prosecutor. Don't think I blindly trusted in his investigation just because he's my old man. His investigation was meticulous down to the last detail. Apparently, he even conducted a thorough interview with each and every kid at the orphanage.\nEdgeworth:\n(He interviewed every child... I wonder how fruitful his results were.)\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSS-5 Incident Files, Cameron's Autopsy Report, Cameron's Testimony or Cameron's Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLang:\nThe SS-5 Incident that occurred 12 years ago... I guess I should tell you everything. My old man failed to protect the country's number one VIP. Because of that... ...he put everything on the line in his hunt for the culprit after the incident. During that time, my old man... He was like a lifeless ghost. If he had just caught his prey, he might have been able to forgive himself. But... that shrew, Roland, she managed to get away scot-free! My old man couldn't repay his debt to the president, nor could he unravel the case... And so began the nightmare that our wolf pack still haven't woken up from to this day. Satisfied?\nEdgeworth:\n(When his clan's honor was damaged, young Lang's heart was wounded just as badly. Agent Lang. I can sympathize with your father's regrets. However...) ...all we can do is perform a thorough investigation of this case. I hope your words will serve as some kind of clue.\nLang:\nTch! That's all you have to say!? Sheesh. All that talking was a real waste of time.\n\n\n\n\nFire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLang:\nWhat kind of pup dumps out kerosene and lights it on fire as a prank?\nKay:\nThanks to that, some valuable evidence for this case has gone up in smoke.\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang. Your father relentlessly investigated the SS-5 Incident. During his investigation, did he find any information on the child who started the fire?\nLang:\nSo you noticed it too, huh? Truth is, I've thought about the same thing myself. But...\nEdgeworth:\nYour father never revealed his own thoughts to anyone... Is that right?\nLang:\nYeah, that's right. The truth is like a needle hidden in a haystack...\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems his feelings on the matter are more complicated than he lets on...)\nKay:\nHeh heh heh... Mr. Lang! Haven't you forgotten something important? A wolf's nose should be able to sniff out the truth from a haystack!\nLang:\n...Tch! Hahahahahahaha! You're right. To think the little crow-girl would be the one to tell me that.\nEdgeworth:\n(She is my assistant for good reason...)\nKay:\nI'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant for good reason, you know!\nMIB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMIB:\nShifu. I know it's not my place, but I have a request. Please... Do a roll call, just like old times!\nLang:\nJust like old times, huh? Heh. What a lark... Guess I have no choice. Roll call!\nMIB:\n1! ...... I-I'm sorry. A roll call with one person is really lacking...\nLang:\nThat's nonsense. It's got nothing to do with numbers. Even though you're the only one here, the pack is always one, right? If you think it's lacking, then howl loud enough to make up for the rest of the pack! Roll call!\nMIB:\n1! 1! 1... O... ne...\nEdgeworth:\n(That man... Is he on the verge of tears?)\nIgloo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThis bear-shaped igloo is both cute and scary at the same time. I hereby declare this a beargloo!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. It looks as though this igloo could fit three people inside.\nKay:\nYeah. I bet you could live up to three years in this beargloo!\nEdgeworth:\nThree years? What about the summertime? The bea... The igloo would melt.\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! Say that again! Say that one more time!\nEdgeworth:\nThe igloo would melt.\nKay:\nTsk.\nFranziska von Karma and Dick Gumshoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\n...Scruffy! Don't you dare say a word. I'm warning you!\nGumshoe:\nEek! Mr. Edgeworth! P-Please help me, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nIt's about the story behind this \"SS-5 Incident\", sir! Even though Blaise may have lost his authority... ...there's no way you can get confidential documents this quickly. That got me curious, so I made a few calls and asked around... ...and I found out that Ms. von Karma used all sorts of forceful tactics to...\nFranziska:\nScruffy! I thought I warned you!\nGumshoe:\nAiiieeeee!\nEdgeworth:\n(...You've done a lot for us, Franziska. I promise I will bring this to an end with my own hands.)\nRaymond Shields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nThis scene sure puts a chill in your bones. Uncle Ray needs a hot babe to keep him warm.\nKay:\n...Could you please try to be a little more serious?\nRay:\nOh? If that's what Kay wants, I guess I have no choice. Miles. This is where it all began... Isn't that right?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. I fear that is the case.\nRay:\nWhat was Patricia and Blaise's true goal? There are still many mysteries yet to be solved.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. It is just as you say.\nRay:\nParticularly, the mystery of... What will happen to Kay-Ray's love!? Isn't it suspectful?\nKay:\nNot even a little. ...You just couldn't resist, could you, Mr. Shields!? Why can't you ever stay serious for more than a minute!?\nEdgeworth:\n(I think he's genuinely incapable of staying serious for that long.)\nSpring riders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese playground toys are modeled after a hare and a tortoise, like from the fable. The tortoise and the hare competed in race, and in the end the hare lost.\nKay:\nAnd now, for something completely different... It's time for a Kay Quiz! Why did the hare lose? There are three choices!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmph. I already know the answer. It's because the hare took a nap...)\nKay:\n1) The hare's favorite shoes were stolen by the Yatagarasu. 2) The tortoise trained with the Yatagarasu until it became faster than the hare. 3) Unbeknownst to the two animals, the Yatagarasu stole the victory from the shadows!\nEdgeworth:\n(Those are my only choices...?)\nKay:\nIs it too hard for you? 'Kay, I'll give you a hint. It starts with a \"th\"!\nEdgeworth:\n(Sh-She wants me to pick number 3...)\n(Connecting all possible Logic, examining two footprints, burnt pillar, cell phone, body, brick and camera, talking to Lang leads to:)\nEdgeworth:\nWe've learned pretty much all that we can about the situation at the time of the murder.\nKay:\nOh! In that case, is there another scene you'd like to re-create?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. Would you do the honors? I would like you to re-create the scene when the victim witnessed the president's kidnapping.\nKay:\nRight! I'll re-create the scene based on Mr. Cameron's photo!\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Cameron is standing in the middle of the flowerbeds...\nKay:\n...and the president and his kidnapper are standing on the road.\nLang:\nMy old man based his initial investigation on this man's eyewitness testimony. As a result, it led him to believe that the kidnapping and this facility were related.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that's how... he came to suspect the head of the orphanage, Patricia Roland.\nLang:\nYeah... But in court, Blaise Debeste treated this testimony as if it meant nothing.\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would he do that?\nLang:\nThe president and his kidnapper were not standing inside the orphanage grounds. So a connection between the orphanage and the kidnapping was difficult to prove.\nKay:\nI see. It's not like they were seen inside the orphanage, after all...\nLang:\nTch! No matter how much evidence the detectives gather at the crime scene... ...it doesn't mean squat if the prosecutor won't use it in court! Blaise Debeste had some kind of connection with Patricia Roland. I figure they had some kind of deal going on.\nKay:\nIn other words, you think that Blaise was one of the kidnappers (Was Blaise a kidnapper? Blaise had Patricia found not guilty. Were they partners in crime?)?\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, your father was convinced that Patricia Roland was the culprit... Your father was a highly capable investigator, I presume? Might he have had some other basis for his conclusion besides the eyewitness testimony?\nLang:\nYeah... I figure he did. But I have no idea what it was. My old man never really talked much about this case...\nEdgeworth:\n(Agent Lang's father, Dai-Long Lang... President Huang's most trusted confidant. The truth he discovered was suppressed by Blaise Debeste. First, we must find that hidden truth...)\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What did Blaise dig up?\" and \"Was Blaise a kidnapper?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf we suppose that Blaise was one of the kidnappers... ...it becomes more likely that what he dug up yesterday is connected to the abduction.\nKay:\nAh!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What is it!?\nKay:\nI've figured it out! It was treasure! Treasure! Couldn't Blaise have dug up the ransom money?\nEdgeworth:\nThe 100 million dollar ransom... ...buried in the ground until the head had died down. It's certainly possible.\nKay:\nI know, right!?\nMonster's Footprints data updated in my Organizer.\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nYeah, what's up?\n\n\n\nChange Re-creation (while recreating Moment of the Incident)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nSo you want to re-create the scene based on the \"police investigation\" data? This is the Time the Body Was Discovered, when the police were investigating the scene!\n\n\nKay:\nI've re-created the scene!\n\n\n\n\nChange Re-creation (while recreating Time the Body was Discovered)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nSo you want to re-create the scene based on the \"Mr. Cameron's eyewitness testimony\"? This is the Time the Body Was Discovered, when the president was being kidnapped!\n\n\nKay:\nI've re-created the scene!\n\n\n\n\nUsing Little Thief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nOh! You wanna hear about the Little Thief's newest feature?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. Not particularly.\nKay:\nWha...!? C'mon, don't say that! Using the latest feature, we can now re-create the scene at different times.\nEdgeworth:\n(She just went ahead and started explaining it...)\nKay:\nRight now, we can re-create the scene based on the \"police investigation report\"... ...and \"Mr. Cameron's eyewitness testimony\"! Please let me know whenever you want to switch scenes!\n\n\n\n\nMr. Cameron's photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nI re-created the scene based on Mr. Cameron's photo... Doesn't something seem off to you?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. If you compare the re-creation with the information we've gathered... ...there appears to be a clear contradiction.\nKay:\nOh! I knew something was off.\nEdgeworth:\nLet's compare the evidence we have on hand... ...with the scene re-created from the photograph.\nScene of Cameron being killed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCameron took a photo of the president from this spot...\nKay:\n...and he also called Ms. Crane, right?\nEdgeworth:\nAt that time, the killer was already behind him.\nKay:\nHolding the murderous brick...\nScene of Huang being kidnapped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nStreet lamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThis is the photo he took... but it looks kinda dark. I guess he wasn't able to bring out the subject's charm and make it a brighter photo.\nEdgeworth:\nKay. The reason this photo is so dark is not because of the subject... It's because the street lamp nearby was broken, you see?\nKay:\nHuh? A-Aaah! So you don't have to rely on natural lighting, you can use lamps to light up the subject! I never thought about that! Nice one, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(I don't think she understood what I was trying to tell her...)\n\n\n\n\nSnowman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nUmm, about this snowman... When we re-created the scene where Mr. Cameron was killed, it has already melted. Its scarf was all soggy, and one of its button eyes was missing.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. At this stage, it appears that most of its original form was still intact. Although, there's one spot that looks unnaturally lacking...\nKay:\nPoor thing! I bet some naughty kid must've plucked it off. Although, from a thief's perspective, that kid does have some promise.\nEdgeworth:\n(Was it plucked off by one of the children at the orphanage? No, perhaps... ...it was taken by an entirely different person altogether...?)\n\n\n\n\nDi-Jun Huang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDi-Jun Huang. 12 years ago, he was still the president of Zheng Fa.\nKay:\nDoesn't he seem a bit younger? Though it might be hard to tell, since it's so dark.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. And with the situation being what it was, his facial expression seems a bit strained.\nKay:\nI wonder where the president was taken after this?\nEdgeworth:\nWe don't know that yet. However, if the answer to that question lies here... ...it should become clear when we continue the investigation.\n\n\n\n\nKidnapper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the president's kidnapper. Let's try drawing out whatever we can from their appearance.\nKay:\nRight, I got it! Their appearance, their appearance...\nEdgeworth:\nFirst things first. The kidnapper threatened the president with a gun.\nKay:\nLook at how they're holding the gun, it's like they're trying to show it off. Totally not cool!\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, we cannot see the person's face because it's hidden by their coat and hat.\nKay:\nAnd look at that popped collar, it's like they're trying to be all that. Totally not cool!\nEdgeworth:\nTheir body seems relaxed, suggesting that they had a composed mental state.\nKay:\nThet even have one hand stuffed in their pocket. Totally not cool at all!\nEdgeworth:\nKay. I'm sorry, but that's...\nKay:\n...stuff I've drawn out from their appearance!\nEdgeworth:\n(...That may be true, but...)\n\n\n\n\nDeduce (after examining Snowman)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)\n\n\n\nDeduce snowman and present Bloodstained Button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This snowman... Wouldn't you say it's missing something?\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nCompare this piece of evidence to the state of this area. Do you notice anything?\nKay:\nHmm... I think I do... Aha! I noticed that your logic is wrong!\nEdgeworth:\nNgh! (It seems I was wrong after all...)\nKay:\nLet's double check the area for anything out of place! Perhaps there's something that's related to the evidence we have!\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis snowman... Wouldn't you say it's missing something?\nKay:\nAh! Its right eye is missing!\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. And what's more, that missing eye happens to be in our possession.\nKay:\nThe button that Mr. Cameron was holding onto! It's got the exact same design as the snowman's left eye!\nEdgeworth:\nIf we assume this button was indeed the snowman's eye... ...a huge contradiction arises. If this button is the snowman's eye, what contradiction arises?\n\n\n\nThe location of the victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The victim was holding onto the button. Furthermore, the button was stained with blood.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe location of the snowman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt contradicts with the location of the snowman!\nKay:\nSo, you mean the snowman was actually in the middle of the garden? But, there were no signs that it was moved, right?\nEdgeworth:\nGah! (So it wasn't this... If the button used as the snowman's eye was grabbed by the victim... ...there can only be one answer!)\nLeads back to:\n\"If this button is the snowman's eye, what contradiction arises?\"\n\n\n\n\nThe location of the president\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt contradicts with the location of the president!\nKay:\nThe location of the president? But, I thought the president had nothing to do with the button...\nEdgeworth:\nM... Mmph. (It seems I was wrong... If the button used as the snowman's eye was grabbed by the victim... ...there can only be one answer!)\nLeads back to:\n\"If this button is the snowman's eye, what contradiction arises?\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim was holding onto the button. Furthermore, the button was stained with blood. In other words, he grabbed the button after he was attacked. For example, if we were to picture it in this way... After being struck in the back of the head, Mr. Cameron lost his balance. As he was falling, he reached out his hand towards the nearby snowman. However, it could not support his weight, and he collapsed while still grasping the button.\nKay:\nHuh!? Th-That means... ...Mr. Cameron was near the snowman when he was attacked!?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. At the very least, he must have been within arm's reach, however... ...it's quite clear that he would not have been able to reach it from his current position.\nKay:\nBut! Mr. Cameron's footprints only lead towards the flowerbed!\nEdgeworth:\nCan we be certain that those footprints really are Mr. Cameron's...? It seems we'll need to investigate them one more time.\nKay:\nUnderstood! I'll re-create the Time the Body Was Discovered scene one more time!\nKay:\nThese footprints should match up with Mr. Cameron's shoes, right?\nEdgeworth:\nLet's inspect them again.\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nYeah, what's up?\n\n\n\nThe three disasters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nA kidnapping, a murder, and a fire on top of that. So much thing happened that it's hard to keep things straight...\nEdgeworth:\nThe fire was caused by a child on the evening of the incident. Which means, the fire occurred before the kidnapping and the murder.\nKay:\nDid you notice something about when the fire started?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. There's one thing that caught my attention. (If the fire occurred first, then something left at the crime scene should not have been there. What has changed at the scene due to the fire, and the evidence that I have on hand... It seems I'll need to take a moment to compare the two.)\nFootprints on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese footprints... Are they really Mr. Cameron's?\nKay:\nThey're from size 11 shoes, and these huge footprints match up with Mr. Cameron's shoes. No matter how you look at it, they're moving steadily towards the center of the flowerbeds.\nEdgeworth:\nBut when Mr. Cameron was attacked, he grabbed the button from the snowman.\nKay:\nEven with a Great Thief's peak human conditioning, your arm just can't stretch that far. Let alone an ordinary civilian, it'd be completely impossible.\nEdgeworth:\n(The footprints come from the shoes worn by the victim, just as the case files say. ...However, does that mean Mr. Cameron was the owner of these shoes? We should re-examine Mr. Cameron's shoes.)\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore examining shoes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nAfter examining shoes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nShoes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(These shoes should match the footprints, however...) Hm? These shoes... it seems like they were not the ones originally worn by the victim.\nKay:\nWhat do you mean?\nEdgeworth:\nIf you look closely, you'll see the laces were tied up strangely. And the size doesn't seem to fit quite right either.\nVictim's Shoes data jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay:\nThat would mean, these huge footprints leading up to the victim's feet...\nEdgeworth:\n...were most likely made by someone other than the victim.\nKay:\nSo then. the footprints leading to and from the victim's head must be Mr. Cameron's.\nEdgeworth:\nNo, not necessarily. They seem a little too small to be the victim's footprints.\nKay:\nSo none of the footprints are his...? Then, which way did Mr. Cameron walk from?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's quite simple. The victim did not walk here on his own accord, but rather... ...he was carried here (Body was moved - There are signs that Cameron's body was carried from somewhere.) after he was murdered, by the culprit. (The question now becomes, where was he killed and carried from... Perhaps it was near the snowman after all?)\nMelted snowman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Mr. Cameron's body was moved. If we consider the button he was holding on to... ...it's highly likely that he was killed near this snowman. I should take a closer look.)\n\n\n\nBefore examining gap between the bricks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nAfter examining gap between the bricks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nFootprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThere are some size 7 footprints going back and forth. According to the police files, these are the culprit's footprints.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed... They seem to grow faint and disappear as they approach the road.\nKay:\nThere's not much snow left on the road after all.\nEdgeworth:\nAs expected, it'll be difficult to determine who these footprints belong to.\n\n\n\n\nMelted snowman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThis snowman has become a sad sight to look at.\nEdgeworth:\nIt can't be helped. Snow and ice both melt away with time.\nKay:\nJust like the mysteries of the cases you've solved, Mr. Edgeworth! As time passes, those mysteries melt away while you continue to keep your cool!\nEdgeworth:\n(You do realize I'm wracking my brain trying to solve those mysteries during a case...)\n\n\n\n\nPlants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt appears that the outside of the facility was also decorated with flowerbeds.\nKay:\nWow. So there are flowers that bloom in the winter. Snow has even piled up on the flowerbed.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. It seems a little cold, and it gives off a refined taste. Even though it's just a re-creation.\nKay:\nIndeed. It gives off a little cold, and tastes quite refined. Even though it's just a re-creation.\nEdgeworth:\nAs expected, it'll be difficult to determine who these footprints belong to.\n\n\n\n\nGap between the bricks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nHuh? There's a brick missing here (Missing brick - One of the bricks near the snowman is missing.).\nEdgeworth:\nThe rests are all in order. It's strange that only this one is missing.\nMoment of the Incident\nBurnt pillar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nAccording to the files, it seems there was a fire on the evening of the incident.\nEdgeworth:\nA fire?\nKay:\nUmm. Let's see here... huh!? It says that one of the children at the orphanage spilled kerosene and set it on fire as a prank.\nEdgeworth:\nI guess that kid had far too much energy... And thanks to that, we can't make out any of the footprints near the main hall... The place Cameron was killed was not near the flowerbeds.\nKay:\nSo then, whose blood is this...?\nEdgeworth:\nJust now, the state of the re-creation has changed completely. Regarding this bloodstain... ...the Time the Body Was Discovered scene has probably been greatly impacted as a result.\nKay:\nThen, let's go check it out right away! Preparations are ready!\nEdgeworth:\n(Since the state of the re-creation has changed once again... ...I should press the Y Button and select Change Re-creation. Let's give it a try.)\nSnowman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nIt's the one-eyed snowman. It goes all the way up to my shoulders! At this size, it's a Gigaton class! You gotta hand it to the kids who made this.\nEdgeworth:\n..I was hoping for some more diverse information, instead of just its size.\nKay:\nA bucket hat, button eyes, and a wool scarf. It's fully equipped! All that's left is to knock it down with countless punches and kicks!\nEdgeworth:\n...I was hoping for some more objective information, instead of what you'd like to do to it.\nScene of Huang being kidnapped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the president just before he was kidnapped at gunpoint.\nKay:\nThe president was strong, but there's no way he'd win against a gun.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd Mr. Cameron photographed this scene from the middle of the flowerbeds... There's something highly unnatural about this.\nKay:\nIt would've been impossible for him to grab the snowman's button from there!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. We should examine the state of the other re-creation once more.\nTime the Body Was Discovered\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Murder weapon: Brick\" and \"Missing brick\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps the missing brick (Brick near the snowman - The brick used to kill Cameron was from near the snowman.) was the one used as the murder weapon.\nKay:\nAh! Yeah, it seems to be just the right size to fit in that gap perfectly!\n\n\n\n\n\"Body was moved\" and \"Brick near the snowman\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"As I thought, it seems the murder actually occurred near the snowman.\"\nEdgeworth:\nAs I thought, it seems the murder actually occurred near the snowman.\nKay:\nBoth the button Mr. Cameron was holding and the murder weapon came from there...\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. Also, if we assume that the killer picked up the brick near the snowman... ...and then tried to sneak up behind Mr. Cameron...\nKay:\nOh! Mr. Cameron totally would've seen the person picking up the brick!\nEdgeworth:\nExactly. Kay. Please update the re-creation. Mr. Cameron was not in the middle of the flowerbeds, but near the snowman.\nKay:\n'Kay! I'm on it!\nBloodstain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe place Cameron was killed was not hear the flowerbeds.\nKay:\nSo then, whose blood is this...?\nEdgeworth:\nWe'll have to investigate this bloodstain in more detail later, however... ...for now, our top priority is to ensure that the re-creation of the crime scene is complete. Let's confirm the location of all parties involved once again.\nScene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"No matter how you look at it, this is strange.\"\nKay:\nNo matter how you look at it, this is strange.\nEdgeworth:\nAll the people involved in the case are gathered in the same place.\nKay:\nDid we make a mistake here or something?\nEdgeworth:\n(One piece of evidence this re-creation is based on is odd. If I had to choose which piece of evidence is fake... Which piece of evidence is likely to be fake...?)\nPresent Cameron's Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Was this photo... really taken by Mr. Cameron?\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nKay. Take a look at this evidence.\nKay:\nDon't tell me you're gonna say this piece of evidence is fake! No matter how you look at it, I don't think that's right.\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! (So I was wrong...)\nKay:\nThe people involved in this case couldn't have all been in one place, right? If we've proved that this was the spot where Mr. Cameron was actually standing...\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. It means \"that\" piece of evidence must be fake.\nLeads back to:\n\"(Which piece of evidence is likely to be fake...?)\"\nEdgeworth:\nWas this photo... really taken by Mr. Cameron?\nKay:\nEhhh!? What do you mean?\nEdgeworth:\nWe have proven that whoever killed Mr. Cameron also moved the body. For what reason would they have to deliberately move his body? Perhaps the culprit wanted to falsify the scene that Mr. Cameron witnessed.\nKay:\nAnd that's why they took a fake photo?\nEdgeworth:\nThey made the president stand under the street light, and took a photo with Cameron's camera. It would have been quite simple.\nKay:\nNow that you mention it... Mr. Cameron's camera only had one photo on it, right?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. In all likelihood, the original roll of film had been removed from the camera... ...and after loading a new roll of film into the camera, the fake photo was taken.\nKay:\nI see! So, this photo must've been taken after Mr. Cameron was killed, right?\nCameron's Photo data updated in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nExactly. This was not the scene Mr. Cameron actually witnessed. It's likely that this photo is forged evidence!\nKay:\nThen, where did Mr. Cameron witness the president and his kidnapper?\nEdgeworth:\nThe photo isn't the only piece of evidence that indicates what Mr. Cameron witnessed...\nKay:\nAh! The testimony he left on the answering machine!\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. We should listen to the recording one more time and confirm what was said. (Where else could the president and his kidnapper have been?)\nPresent under the up-left lamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Cameron said this on the answering machine...\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nKay:\nThey were over there!? So, what's the basis for that claim?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Do I really need a basis for my claims?\nKay:\nIn other words, you don't know, do you?\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (So It wasn't there...)\nKay:\nLet's try remembering what Mr. Cameron said in his eyewitness testimony! Didn't he say something about the situation at the scene?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. Mr. Cameron's testimony should provide a major clue.\nLeads back to:\n\"(Where else could the president and his kidnapper have been?)\"\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Cameron said this on the answering machine... \"The light just went off. I can barely see a thing now.\" There are only two places here where the lights are broken...\nKay:\nThe light by the orphanage!\nEdgeworth:\nKay. Could you please update the re-creation?\nKay:\nRoger!\nLang:\nThis is...! So the kidnapper was near the orphanage!?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. With this, we've shown the connection between the orphanage and the kidnapping.\nLang:\nSo that's why they moved the body and took a fake photo to create false testimony! In order to remove any suspicion towards the orphanage in court!\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm. With this, the state of the re-creation has changed completely. The Time the Body Was Discovered scene has probably been greatly impacted as a result.\nKay:\nThen, let's go check it out right away! Preparations are ready!\nEdgeworth:\n(Since the state of the re-creation has changed once again... ...I should press the Y Button and select Change Re-creation. Let's give it a try.)\nScene of Huang being kidnapped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nSo this is where the president and his kidnapper were really seen.\nEdgeworth:\nThat is correct. However, now the orphanage can no longer avoid suspicion in the kidnapping. That's why it was necessary to distance the kidnapping site from the orphanage grounds.\nKay:\nOooh... sneaky. So that's why they took the fake photo!\nEdgeworth:\nThey disposed of Cameron's film and threatened the president near the road. Then, using new film, they took the false photograph.\nKay:\nIf Blaise was in league with the kidnappers, he could conceal any incriminating evidence.\nEdgeworth:\nIn fact, the SS-5 Incident case files had been sealed away until Blaise's recent downfall.\nKay:\nOooh. The truth of this case is being revealed, little by little!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed... (However, some mysteries still remain. We'll need to thoroughly investigate any changes in the previous re-creation.)\nBloodstain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe place Cameron was killed was not near the flowerbeds.\nKay:\nSo then, whose blood is this...?\nEdgeworth:\nJust now, the state of the re-creation has changed completely. Regarding this bloodstain... ...the Time the Body Was Discovered scene has probably been greatly impacted as a result.\nKay:\nThen, let's go check it out right away! Preparations are ready!\nEdgeworth:\n(Since the state of the re-creation has changed once again... ...I should press the Y Button and select Change Re-creation. Let's give it a try.)\nScene of Cameron being killed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no mistaking it. Mr. Cameron was originally here when he took the photo. The killer took a brick from that flowerbed and attacked him. Mr. Cameron was hit in the back of the head, and grabbed the snowman's right eye as he fell.\nKay:\nAnd since we now know that Mr. Cameron's body was here... ...the state of the other re-creation must have changed as well.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. In that case, perhaps we should go and investigate it.\nTime the Body Was Discovered\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. Originally, Mr. Cameron's body was here. In order to be consistent with the fake photo... ...he was moved to the center of the flowerbeds.\nKay:\nThen, the footprints going back and forth from the body, could theu be!?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. There's only one possibility at the moment... These footprints were probably left when the body was moved to the flowerbeds.\nBloodstain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore deducing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nAfter deducing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nDirt ground\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThis seems to be the only area without any snow.\nEdgeworth:\nIt must have been melted by the fire caused by the child at the orphanage.\nKay:\nThe disasters just kept coming for this orphanage. After the fire, multiple murders occurred.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? After the fire...? If the snow had melted, wouldn't that mean...?)\n\n\n\n\nBloodstain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe blood splatter above the snow.. There certainly was a substantial amount. It's almost as if the murder was actually committed here...\nKay:\nBut, Mr. Cameron should have been attacked near the snowman!\nEdgeworth:\nExactly. In that case, this blood must belong to someone else.\nKay:\nWhaaat!? But, the police reports said this was Mr. Cameron's blood...\nEdgeworth:\nThe one in charge of this case was Blaise Debeste. It would have been simple for him to falsify that information.\nKay:\nBut! Wouldn't it be faster to just clean up the bloodstains, rather than falsify the information?\nEdgeworth:\nHe wouldn't be able to do that. Think about it... Blaise knew that Mr. Cameron's body would be discovered here. In which case, the forensic department would naturally become involved.\nKay:\nAh! A luminol reaction! They would've discovered it with the power of science!\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. It would have been difficult to completely erase all traces of the blood. However, falsifying the results of a blood test would be much easier in comparison. He would just have to switch the results from the forensics reports.\nKay:\nAww, what a bummer... Knowing those documents I read were falsified. Err, it looks like Mr. Cameron's clothes were completely soaked in blood.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. If the blood scattered here got onto Cameron's clothes... ...that would mean, at the time, the bloodstains here had not dried yet.\nKay:\nI see. So then, this certain somebody's blood... ...was splattered here just a short while before Mr. Cameron was murdered!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. That's exactly right. (However, if that's the case... ...wouldn't a new contradiction arise in this re-creation...?)\nMysterious Bloodstain data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nSnow around the bloodstain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\n...So then, I've placed the body near the snowman. Now that he's gone, it feels a little lonely around here.\nEdgeworth:\n(That's not a very proper way of putting it...) Since the body isn't here, we might be able to find some new clues. Let's thoroughly investigate this area.\nKay:\nAye aye, Mr. Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\nDeduce (after examining bloodstain)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)\n\n\n\nDeduce bloodstain and present Fire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is a clear contradiction!\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis evidence clearly contradicts the state of this area!\nKay:\nOh! And specifically, where does the contradiction lie!?\nEdgeworth:\nUmm. Around here, perhaps?\nKay:\nIf you don't know, just say so...\nEdgeworth:\nM... Mmph. (I should think this over one more time.)\nKay:\nSo the snow was melted by the fire? We should keep in mind when exactly the fire started and take a closer look at the area!\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a clear contradiction!\nKay:\nHuh? You mean this bloodstain?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you see how this bloodstain is broken up by the remains of the fire? This is proof that the fire occurred after the blood had scattered around the area.\nKay:\nHuh? But I thought the fire occurred before the murder...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems that information is suspect as well. If the fire had broken out after the murder...\nLang:\n! ...then the child who started the fire should have seen the body and the bloodstains.\nEdgeworth:\nWhy then, did they not come forward as a witness? It's likely that would have put Blaise at a great disadvantage!\nLang:\nGuess we'll need to investigate this fire in more detail. Hey, you!\nMIB:\nYes, sir!\nLang:\nThere should be some records of the fire in the police department under a different case file! I want you to bring me every last investigation report about the fire!\nMIB:\nUnderstood, Shifu!\nLang:\nOh, and one more thing...\nMIB:\nWhat is it, sir?\nLang:\nContact the House of Lang in Zheng Fa. There should be evidence from this case in my old man's room.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean?\nLang:\nI just remembered... why I recognize this scene. A long time ago, I saw a picture in my old man's room. It was a drawing resembling this scene...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat did you say!?\nLang:\nHowever, I think it looked like something a child drew.\nEdgeworth:\nA child...? Then the artist may have been the culprit behind the fire.\nLang:\nIt should still be somewhere in my old man's room. Have them send it over here.\nMIB:\nUnderstood, sir!\n(Connecting all possible Logic and deducing bloodstain leads to:)\nInvestigation Complete\nMIB:\nShifu! I'm back! I've brought the info on the fire the kid started and a photo of the drawing in your father's office... And also...\nLang:\nOh, I've been waiting for this! Hurry up and hand 'em over!\nEdgeworth:\n(The information held by Agent Lang's father...!)\nLang:\nThis is it...! It's exactly what I remembered!\nEdgeworth:\n...This was the picture drawn by the child, depicting the night of the incident?\nKay:\nIt sure looks like it was drawn with a child's touch!\nEdgeworth:\nAs I thought, the one who drew this... is most likely the child who started the fire.\nChild's Drawing data jotted down in my Organizer.\nMIB:\n...Sh-Shifu!\nLang:\nWhat now? Sorry, but it's gonna have to wait. ...Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Why do you think my old man had this?\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps he obtained it during the course of his investigation into the incident. Although I don't know why he would have concealed it... Agent Lang. Might I be able to see the details of the fire?\nLang:\nYeah, sure.\nEdgeworth:\nAllow me to read it posthaste. The boy who started the fire snuck out of bed on the night of the incident. Hm? It seems this boy went missing several days later.\nLang:\nWhat? Don't tell me that he witnessed something he shouldn't have?\nKay:\nThat's horrible! He was only a child, after all!\nEdgeworth:\n(While I'd hate for that to be the case, we can't rule out the possibility entirely.)\nLang:\nHuh? Apparently, the boy left some stuff behind at the orphanage, and it was taken as evidence... What's this...?\nEdgeworth:\nTh-That's...! (What's that doing here?)\nLang:\nHm? Mr. Prosecutor. Do you recognize this?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... I know one piece of evidence that's related to it. Which piece of evidence is related to what the boy left behind?\nPresent Moozilla Doll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know what it's doing here...\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLang:\nYou're saying this thing's related to that piece of evidence?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. There is no doubt in my mind.\nLang:\n\nLang:\nYou seriously think that? Lang Zi says: \"Soy sauce in cream puffs!\" In other words, I can't see how these two things go together at all!\nEdgeworth:\n...Gwaaah! (So that wasn't it...? There should be something like this among the evidence. I'll need to compare it with the evidence one more time...)\nLang:\nHow about it, Mr. Prosecutor? Do you recognize this thing?\nLeads back to:\n\"Which piece of evidence is related to what the boy left behind?\"\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know what it's doing here... ...but, isn't that the missing horn from this Moozilla doll?\nLang:\nN-No way, you mean, this came off the president's...?\nEdgeworth:\nYou know of it?\nLang:\nYeah. I've noticed the president kept it close by as a decoration. I always thought it was strange how one of the horns was missing.\nEdgeworth:\nIf you twist the horn... this doll will play back any previously recorded audio.\nKay:\nSo if we put the missing horn back in place... we might be able to hear a different recording!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed... It is possible. The doll is currently on the 51st floor of the Great Tower.\nLang:\nHey, you! You heard that, right?\nMIB:\nYessir! I'll be right back!\nMIB:\nShifu, I've got it! The Mighty Moozilla doll!\nLang:\nWell done. Give it to the prosecutor over there.\nEdgeworth:\n(If we insert the horn found at the orphanage into the doll...)\nKay:\nIt's a perfect fit!\nLang:\nWell? Can you hear anything?\n.......Mr. Huang. It's Amy. It's been a while. I saw the news that you would be coming to this country... I was really nervous about doing this, but I decided to send you a message.\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nP-Please stop the playback!\nEdgeworth:\n(Judge Courtney?)\nKay:\nWh-What's wrong!?\nCourtney:\nStop it! Now!\nIt's a boy... Your son. He's just been born. I'm sorry. That's all I wanted to tell you. His name is John. John Marsh... It's a fine name for him, don't you think?\nCourtney:\nAah...!\nEdgeworth:\nM-Marsh...!?\nLang:\nDid she say... John?\nI'll be waiting in the courtyard of the orphanage at midnight on February 9th. Even if it's just once, I want John to be able to meet you. I'm sorry if I'm being selfish, but... I'll be waiting.\nJohn:\nNo way... That was my...?\nCourtney:\nJohn...\nLang:\nWhat's the meaning of this? Ms. Courtney...\nCourtney:\nJohn is... not my biological son. He's... adopted.\nEdgeworth:\nDid John know about this?\nCourtney:\nOf course he knew. John's mother... Amy Marsh, passed away about 5 years ago. She and I were cousins. Since we were young, we've always been really close. We were often mistaken for sisters. That's why, when she passed away... ...I thought it was only natural that I look after John. Also... There were circumstances which prevented me from revealing his father's identity. I never even told John his father's name...\nJohn:\n......\nEdgeworth:\n(And now it's all been revealed, thanks to the recording on that doll. Did John's mother send the doll to the president?)\nJohn:\n...Hey.\nCourtney:\nJohn...!\nJohn:\nWas he... the president, really my dad?\nCourtney:\n.........Yes, he was. Before you were born... Amy worked as a diplomat in Zheng Fa.\nEdgeworth:\n(A diplomat? So that must be how she became acquainted with President Huang...)\nJohn:\nHang on! Didn't you tell me she worked at the orphanage!?\nCourtney:\nYes. After returning to this country, Amy left her job as a diplomat. She always had great passion for charity work... so she began working at the orphanage.\nJohn:\n........\nLang:\nLang:\nHey... Ms. Courtney... ...So this Amy girl, she called the president there herself, but... ...she never showed up at the scene of the SS-5 Incident. What's with that?\nCourtney:\nAmy... couldn't make it. Apparently, someone had been following her the whole night.\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps it was Blaise? I can't say for certain, but it's possible that it was his doing.\nCourtney:\nAfter that, Amy never got another chance to see the president again...\nEdgeworth:\n(So, she died 5 years ago... This conversation must be painful for John.)\nKay:\nOh right. H-Hey, John, you thirsty? How about I buy us both some juice? We can go together...\nJohn:\nI'm a part of this, too. I'll listen until the end. Besides, I can afford to buy my own juice.\nKay:\nOooh! Shot down by a kid...\nCourtney:\n...John. Do you understand the reason I met with the president two days ago?\nEdgeworth:\n(The secret meeting from two nights ago...!)\nCourtney:\nI wanted to tell him. About Amy's death, and... ...that you were alive and well.\nJohn:\nBut... I-I.....\nEdgeworth:\nI see. That's why you couldn't tell us your reasons for meeting with the president until now.\nKay:\nI get it... She would've had to reveal his connection with John.\nCourtney:\nI brought a bouquet of lion lilies... ...so that he would understand I truly did know about Amy. Those flowers are a dear memory to the president and Amy. The first present she received from the president was a bouquet of lion lilies. But now, even he has passed away. If only he were still alive... ...perhaps I could have introduced him to John.\nJohn:\n..........\nMIB:\nShifu! I-I'm sorry to interrupt this atmosphere, but there's something I need to say...\nLang:\nOh, what is it now!? Can't this wait?\nMIB:\nWell... actually, there's one last item that's been delivered here from Zheng Fa! I have here... the president's will!\nLang:\nWh... What!?\nEdgeworth:\n(...The president's will?)\nLang:\nMy old man received a great number of special medals from the president himself... As a token of his trust, the president left his will in the protection of the Lang clan. Those medals and that will, they were the pride of our clan. Our family treasures, so to speak.\nLang:\n........ Ngh... Th-This is...!\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang. Does that will have something to do with the current case?\nLang:\nYou bet it does. It says here... \"I hereby acknowledge John Marsh as my own son.\"\nCourtney:\nWhat...!? John's name is in the president's will...?\nEdgeworth:\nAre you certain that will was written by the president?\nLang:\nYeah. He entrusted it to the Lang clan even before the SS-5 Incident took place. They'll have to appraise it back home, but by the name of the Lang clan, this is the real deal.\nEdgeworth:\n(Di-Jun Huang was the president of an entire nation. The existence of his son would have caused... ...considerable controversy. However... he left behind a will, just in case.)\nLang:\nThis makes it doubly sure. I still can't believe it myself, but there's no room for doubt. John Marsh... You are the son of Di-Jun Huang, President of Zheng Fa.\nJohn:\n..............\nCourtney:\nJohn!\nEdgeworth:\nJohn!\nTo be continued.\nApril 6, 4:51 PMOutside Grand TowerTemporary Film Lot\nCourtney:\n...John.\nJohn:\n......So that guy was my dad...\nEdgeworth:\n(He found out about his own birth so suddenly. And furthermore, his new found father is no longer in this world...)\nJohn:\nI'd always been searching for my dad...\nCourtney:\n...John.\nJohn:\nI get it, alright! He's the president. I know it's a complicated situation. But... we even met face to face during the filming. So then, why!? Huh!? Why didn't he tell me who he really was?\nCourtney:\nI'm sorry. John...\nJohn:\nM... Mom, you don't need to apologize. No matter how you look at it, it's all my fault. Yesterday, I broke my promise with you and didn't even notice the fire on the roof... ...so I destroyed everything. I crushed it all. My dad... and those flowers that my mom carefully grew!\nCourtney:\nJohn! Please. For now, just don't think about anything. ...Just stay like this for a little while. Just for a little while... OK?\nLang:\n...\"The bond between a parent and child\". That's the meaning behind Lion Lilies. I know it's not my style, but that flowers is from Zheng Fa.\nEdgeworth:\n(However, we have no means of protecting that bond...) Agent Lang, allow me to say this. The case won't be solved by sentimentality alone. Therefore, shouldn't we do all that we can to solve it?\nLang:\n...Yeah. You're right.\nEdgeworth:\nThe re-creation of the past has finished. Were your father's deductions correct?\nLang:\n...My old man took his deductions to the grave. He never told anyone about them. So, who knows if they were right or not.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, what about your own deductions? I would like to hear what you think happened based on the re-creation. In order for us to get closer to the truth of 12 years ago.\nLang:\nYeah. I was thinking it's about time. I can see it now. My old man's back, real close... I'll catch up to him for sure... ...to the truth that my old man uncovered!\n-- Truth of the SS-5 Incident --\nLang:\nThere's no mistake that the president went to the orphanage.\nThe stuffed toy is proof of that. He was planning to meet with Amy Marsh.\nHowever, the president was kidnapped. And Cameron just happened to witness it.\nIf Cameron hadn't been there, it probably would've just been a kidnapping with no murder.\nAfterwards, the body was moved to the flowerbeds and a fake photo was taken.\nEdgeworth:\n(Was that what really happened 12 years ago...?)\nSS-5 Incident Case Files updated in my Organizer.\nLang:\nHowever, there's one thing I still don't get.\nEdgeworth:\n(Something you don't get?)\nLang:\nIt's this. Why did they need to take a fake photo? Why would they go through all that trouble and even make the president take part in the photo?\nEdgeworth:\n...That's true. However, the answer to that riddle must lie somewhere within... Once we get past the layers upon layers of deductions, we shall surely reach it.\nLang:\nYeah... That's right. I'd like to hear your deductions as well.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Agent Lang. I'd like to verify a few things that may have seemed obvious at first glance. Are we certain that the president actually went to the orphanage? Lang: OK, I get it. You're saying you want proof? Kay: Everyone's always demanding proof from Mr. Edgeworth, after all. Edgeworth: (You didn't have to tell him that...)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean this stuffed animal? The one with the recording device. Lang: That's right. Inside that toy was a recording from John's birthday mother, Amy Marsh... Edgeworth: Indeed. She said that she would meet with him at midnight. Kay: Wow! You two are perfectly in synch! The truth is becoming clear, like you're peeling off the layers of a scallion! Edgeworth: Kay. A scallion doesn't have anything on the inside. Please don't make such foreboding analogies. Kay: ........ The truth is becoming clear, like you're peeling off the skin of a wolf! Lang: C-Can you stop making those foreboding analogies...? ...Ahem. Let's get back on track.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I'd also like to verify the details of this point as much as possible. Mr. Cameron witnessed the president and his kidnapper near the orphanage. Kay: And Mr. Cameron was standing by the snowman near the road. Lang: Then, the murderer picked up a brick, snuck up on him from behind, and... WHAM! Kay: Eeeeeek! Edgeworth: Kay. We are simply verifying what actually transpired. There's no need to be scared. Kay: ...That was so intense. Half the details of this case just vanished from my brain. Mr. Edgeworth. Mr. Lang. Let's carefully verify all the facts of this case! Lang: Yeesh... Well, if you're gonna listen, I'll talk as much as you want.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: If he hadn't been there, you say? That's an interesting theory. Care to explain in more detail? Lang: It's simple. Cameron was killed because he saw the kidnapping. The kidnapping itself was a success. If he hadn't been there, no blood would've been spilled. Edgeworth: (Hmm... No blood would have been spilled?) Kay: You make it sound like it was his own fault for being there. Edgeworth: Kay, that's not it. When Agent Lang's trying to say is... ...simply, besides Mr. Cameron, there was no other casualties at the crime scene. Kay: Oh, was that all? Of course, that's obvious. The president was kidnapped, but... ...once the ransom money was paid, he was returned safe and sound. Edgeworth: (Hmm... That sounds like an obvious point, however, something about it bothers me. I may need to re-evaluate the evidence once more.) Lang: You done explaining things to your assistant? I still have one last thing to confirm.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: That's also an important point. I'd like to take another good clean look at the information. Lang: Yeah, I'm with you there. Let's start with what Cameron saw before he was murdered. Cameron witnessed the president and the kidnapper in front of the orphanage. Edgeworth: However, the culprit wanted to conceal the connection between the incident and the orphanage. Lang: That's right. That's why Cameron's original roll of film was disposed of... ...and a fake photo was taken of them standing outside the grounds of the orphanage. Edgeworth: Yes. And Cameron's body was then moved to match the photo. Lang: Grrr...! It's finally becoming clear. The secret that was buried in the snow for 12 years...!\nKay: Is this the truth of the SS-5 Incident?\nEdgeworth: ........\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth. What's the matter?\nEdgeworth: There is still something hidden behind this case...\nKay: Huh!? What do you mean?\nEdgeworth: There is a piece of evidence that cannot be explained by Agent Lang's theory. As long as there's a contradiction, we'll have to present it in order to advance our reasoning...!",

This is the piece of evidence that shows what happened on that night!\nLang:\nHey, Mr. Prosecutor. Is that really it? That piece of evidence doesn't tell me anything at all!\nEdgeworth:\n...Argh! (Looks like this wasn't it... There should be one more eyewitness who saw what happened on that night. I should show Agent Lang the evidence that proves that.)\nLang:\nHey, Mr. Prosecutor! Just who are you saying was killed on that night?\nLeads back to:\n\"This piece of evidence shows that something happened that night!\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe other murder incident was buried in the dark by Blaise Debeste... However, there is still one piece of evidence that remains. Agent Lang... It survived by your father's hands.\nLang:\nMy old man... you say?\nEdgeworth:\nPlease recall. There was one more thing that was hidden along with the traces of the murder. And that is, the existence of the boy who caused the fire...! Why did Blaise make the boy disappear? It's because he saw something that he wasn't supposed to see.\nKay:\nWhat was the thing he wasn't supposed to see!?\nEdgeworth:\nEverything is drawn in this picture.\nLang:\nThe drawing my old man had!\nEdgeworth:\nThe person drawn on the right is most likely the president. The Moozilla doll is also drawn near him. And the person standing opposite him is...\nPresent Sirhan Dogen profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"A man with a knife and a large, black dog. He is none other than... Sirhan Dogen.\"\nPresent anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIsn't this the person standing opposite him?\nKay:\nIs it really that person? They don't look very similar...\nEdgeworth:\nGiven that it's a child's drawing, it can't be helped if they're not too similar.\nGumshoe:\nEven if it's a child's drawing, I don't think that's it, sir...\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (To think even the detective rejected my theory!)\nGumshoe:\nI think the person in the picture has some unique characteristics.\nKay:\nThat's right. It looks like he has a knife and a black dog with him.\nEdgeworth:\n(A knife and a black dog...? I think I have a hunch who that person is.)\nLang:\nSo in the end, who's the person in this drawing?\nEdgeworth:\nSorry. There's no mistake that the person drawn on the right is the president.\nLeads back to:\n\"And the person standing opposite him is...\"\nEdgeworth:\nA man with a knife and a large, black dog. He is none other than... Sirhan Dogen.\nKay:\nWhaaaaaaaaaat!? The assassin!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would an assassin appear before a president? The answer is clear. Indeed, what occurred that night on the orphanage grounds 12 years ago was not a kidnapping. It was a presidential assassination!\nLang:\nHOOOOOOOOOOOWL!\nKay:\nTh-Then, Ms. Roland and Mr. Blaise were...\nEdgeworth:\nYes. The two were likely partners in crime. One furnished the orphanage to use as the scene of the incident... ...and the other covered up the young boy's testimony. It's likely that Mr. Cameron was murdered because he witnessed the assassination itself. After all, the kidnapping never actually happened!\nLang:\nLang:\nStop messing around! You're saying that the president was assassinated 12 years ago? We just found his body today! He's been alive up until now!\nKay:\nThat's right! I mean, we met him ourselves!\nEdgeworth:\nIf the president was assassinated 12 years ago, and the president's body was found today... ...that would imply there were two presidents.\nKay:\nYeah! And that can't be right!\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure about that? There is the possibility that there were two presidents. (That's right... Up until now, I've been getting a strange feeling from the president...)\nLang:\nEven so, I still respect the man. Zheng Fa is a small country. But he carried the nation with his strength.\nEdgeworth:\n(The image of President Huang that Agent Lang described...)\nHuang:\nYou... you are wrong... I...\nEdgeworth:\n(...He revealed his true form.)\nEdgeworth:\n(...differs far too greatly from the President Huang we know! It's as if they were two entirely different people! If there were, in fact, two Zheng Fa presidents... ...exactly how would such a scenario be possible?) What would make the existence of the two presidents possible?\nThe president had a twin brother\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps President Huang had a twin brother?\nGumshoe:\nIf that's the case, it certainly wouldn't be strange if there were two presidents, sir!\nLang:\n\nLang:\nUnfortunately for you... The president was an only child!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!? (Is that so...?)\nLang:\nAs I thought, it's impossible for there to be two presidents, isn't it?\nEdgeworth:\nNo. There was a possibility that there were two presidents.\nLeads back to:\n\"What would make the existence of the two presidents possible?\"\nOne of them was a body double\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"If we were to assume that one of them was a body double, wouldn't it be possible then?\"\nThe victim looked like the president\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe person killed 12 years ago just happened to look like the president... If we think of it like that, wouldn't it all make sense?\nLang:\n\nLang:\nTake a good look at the boy's drawing that you brought out! No matter how you look at it, this guy is President Huang!\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! (It's just as Agent Lang says...)\nLang:\nAs I thought, it's impossible for there to be two presidents, isn't it?\nEdgeworth:\nNo. There was a possibility that there were two presidents.\nLeads back to:\n\"What would make the existence of the two presidents possible?\"\nEdgeworth:\nIf we were to assume that one of them was a body double, wouldn't it be possible then?\nLang:\nA body double...!\nEdgeworth:\nPresident Huang possessed immense power and authority in Zheng Fa. I'm sure there were those who envied his position and made attempts on his life. Yes. Just as he was attacked a few days ago at Gourd Lake.\nLang:\nIt's true, there were those who sought Huang's life from time to time. But, I can't easily believe there were two presidents. At least, not without any evidence!\nEdgeworth:\n(Do I have evidence that proves there were two presidents?)\nPresent SS-5 Incident Files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"(Has Agent Lang not noticed this contradiction?)\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf you look at this evidence, you'll see that there were two presidents.\nLang:\nHey, Mr. Prosecutor. Unfortunately, I have no idea what you're talking about! Lang Zi says: \"Evidence doesn't speak!\" Evidence with no meaning won't tell us anything!\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! (Looks like this wasn't it.)\nKay:\nIf only we knew that the president was in two different places at the same time... ...then we could prove that there were two people.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. Let's look at the evidence and reorganize the incident again.\nLang:\nHow could there have been two Mr. Huangs? As I suspected, it's impossible! If you want to say there were two people, show me the proof!\nLeads back to:\n\"(Do I have evidence that proves there were two presidents?)\"\nEdgeworth:\n(Has Agent Lang not noticed this contradiction? Or... has he noticed it, but can't admit it?)\nLang:\nWhat is it, Mr. Prosecutor? Don't shout something out only to suddenly clam up.\nEdgeworth:\nAccording to the recording on the doll, the president visited the orphanage at midnight. However... that should not have been possible.\nKay:\nHuh!? Why's that?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy? Because at the time, the president should have been at the embassy. He was together with Agent Lang's father...\nLang:\n............\nEdgeworth:\n(So, Agent Lang, you really did notice.) He was in two places at the same time. Ergo, there must have been two presidents.\nLang:\nHOOOOOOOOOOWL!\nCourtney:\nThen, which of the two was the real president on that day 12 years ago!?\nEdgeworth:\nMost likely the one who died.\nLang:\nWho!? Who contracted Dogen to murder Huang?\nEdgeworth:\n(In order to learn that, first... ...we must have a look at the evidence that we proved was false earlier. And the piece of evidence... we know to be false is...!)\nPresent Cameron's Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The photo taken with Cameron's camera was taken after he was murdered.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang. Take a look at this.\nLang:\nWhat about it!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the evidence that shows who planned the assassination plot against President Huang!\nLang:\n........\nEdgeworth:\n...Agent Lang. I know it's hard to believe, but this is the truth.\nLang:\nNo. Mr. Prosecutor. I was just speechless because your reasoning was so crazy.\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! (He sure doesn't hold back... The person who killed the real president and took his place... That person is without a doubt the one behind this incident. I must show Agent Lang the evidence that proves who that person was!)\nLang:\nHey, Mr. Prosecutor. You already realized who's behind the plot, right?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. I will show you that evidence right now.\nLeads back to:\n\"(And the piece of evidence... we know to be false is...!)\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe photo taken with Cameron's camera was taken after he was murdered. And he was murdered because he witnessed the presidential assassination... In other words, the photo must have been taken following the assassination. Given that, who is the president pictured in the fake photo? ...We must consider him to be the body double.\nLang:\nIn other words, the body double had the real president murdered and then took his place!\nEdgeworth:\nPatricia Roland and Blaise must have cooperated in that plan.\nLang:\nLang:\nHold it! Huang's body was never found! Just where could it have disappeared to!?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThe answer to that is already quite apparent...! This is where the real president's body was!\nPresent Monster's Footprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Last night, there was something Blaise had to unearth with his own two hands.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLang:\nHey, Mr. Prosecutor. Can you put the jokes aside? I can't believe that Mr. Huang's body was in that kind of place!\nEdgeworth:\nGah! (I guess it wasn't there... This is the place that the real president was killed. Furthermore, what was the person responsible doing here? If I think about that, I'm sure to know the location of the president's body!)\nLang:\nHey, Mr. Prosecutor. Where did the president's body disappear to? Maybe you really don't have an answer for that?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, Agent Lang. The answer to that is already quite apparent...\nLeads back to:\n\"This is where the real president's body was!\"\nEdgeworth:\nLast night, there was something Blaise had to unearth with his own two hands. That item was not the ransom... It was something far more important.\nKay:\nAh! So Blaise unburied the...!\nEdgeworth:\n...the real president's body! The possibility is quite high.\nLang:\nWhat'd you saaaayy!?\nEdgeworth:\nThe bones from the body buried 12 years ago would have still remained. According to Mr. Powers, construction was to begin soon at this lot. That was the deadline... ...both for the movie and retrieval of the body.\nKay:\nBecause they would've found the body when they started the construction!\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang! Let us search the footprints that Blaise dug up!\nLang:\n...Yeah. If the body was buried there, there'd be traces of it. Hey! Somebody call forensics!\nForensics:\nI have the results of the search! We've found traces in the dirt that suggest a body was buried here!\nLang:\nTch... So, it was Huang after all?\nForensics:\nWe also recovered the skeletal remains that Blaise Debeste dug up. They were in his home. In addition to the bone structure, the dental records and the bone fractures all match up. We can confirm that it was indeed President Huang!\nEdgeworth:\nSo the real President Huang was indeed killed 12 years ago. The SS-5 Incident was a murder.\nMonster's Footprints data updated in my Organizer.\nKay:\nSo the SS-5 Incident was actually a murder incident! But there's so much information, it's way too confusing...\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. Let us take this opportunity to review the details of the case.\nKay:\nFirst, the real president came to the orphanage, right?\nEdgeworth:\nTwelve years ago... ...the true President Huang visited the orphanage in order to meet his son. The footsteps in the snow that we thought belonged to Mr. Cameron... ...were most likely made by the president at that time. President Huang was supposed to meet his son here... However, the one who actually showed up was the assassin, Sirhan Dogen.\nKay:\nHe came here to meet his son, but was murdered instead... How horrible...\nEdgeworth:\nA man like Dogen... shows no mercy. ...And after that, the second tragedy occurred.\nKay:\nYou mean Mr. Cameron's murder?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. Mr. Cameron saw the decisive moment. After the real president was killed by Dogen... ...his body was carried to the rear courtyard by the team of kidnappers. Mr. Cameron must have witnessed that moment... ...from the orphanage entrance. Although, he himself believed that he had actually witnessed a kidnapping. Furthermore, by this time...\nKay:\n...the body double, who had come to meet up with Blaise and Ms. Roland... ...was already standing behind Mr. Cameron.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd then the witness to the incident, Mr. Cameron...\nKay:\n...was killed by the body double. So, was Mr. Cameron's corpse also carried by the body double?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, that seems likely.\nKay:\nBut, there wasn't anything at the crime scene that looked like the body double's footprints!\nEdgeworth:\nHeh. I've already figured out how he accomplished that. There is a piece of evidence that would've made it possible. What did the body double use to move the body without leaving any footprints?\nPresent Victim's Shoes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is almost certainly how the body double carried Mr. Cameron's corpse.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe double likely used this to move Mr. Cameron's body.\nKay:\nWhoa! He used that to move the body? How would that actually work?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... he... er... used trick after trick and put in a lot of effort...\nLang:\nHey, Mr. Prosecutor. Let's be honest and recognize our mistakes, OK?\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! (It appears this wasn't it... The body double's footprints should have been left at the scene, but they aren't... On the other hand, the victim's footprints are clearly there... I already have the evidence to tie these two facts together!)\nLeads back to:\n\"What did the body double use to move the body without leaving any footprints?\"\nEdgeworth:\nThis is almost certainly how the body double carried Mr. Cameron's corpse. After Mr. Cameron was killed... ...the president's body double carried him into the middle of the garden. I suspect the body double was wearing the same shoes as the real president at the time. If he made sure to step precisely on top of the footprints left by the real president...\nKay:\nAh! Since the shoes were the same... ...there would only be one set of footprints left behind in the snow. I think I've got a pretty good grasp on the SS-5 Incident now. But, there's still one thing I don't get.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's that?\nKay:\nWhy did they need to stage the abduction?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause Mr. Cameron witnessed the incident. He saw the president at the orphanage. He left behind witness testimony on Ms. Crane's answering machine. Even Blaise couldn't make that disappear. Ergo, the body double needed a reason for the president to have been at the orphanage.\nKay:\nAnd that's why they prepared the fake kidnapping charade.\nEdgeworth:\nThe people in the fake photo are the body double, and most likely, Patricia Roland.\nKay:\nThe person in the coat is Ms. Roland? What makes you say that?\nEdgeworth:\nThe two would have to leave the orphanage in order to take the picture. Just like when he moved the body, the double used the real president's footprints.\nKay:\nAh! So the second set of footprints must belong to the person in the coat!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. We originally believed that those footprints belonged to Cameron's killer. They were size 7 footprints, too small for Blaise's feet. Thus, we can presume that the person playing the part of the kidnapper was Patricia Roland. Hidden in the shadow of the presidential kidnapping was a presidential assassination...\nLang:\nI see... So that's why my old man...\nEdgeworth:\nWhy he... what?\nLang:\nThe old man must have realized that a murder had taken place. ...After all, he had the kid's drawing.\nCourtney:\nHowever, that picture was never presented as evidence...\nEdgeworth:\nYour father likely took it from the young witness during the investigation and hid it.\nLang:\nHe had to have known that Huang was dead. But what if he had revealed that back then?\nEdgeworth:\nReveal the death of the president, the backbone of Zheng Fa? It would have caused chaos...\nLang:\n...and that's why my old man took the secret to his grave. He even took the blame for the kidnapping, knowing that would be the fall of the House of Lang!\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the truth that Agent Lang's father hid 12 years ago...\nKay:\nAnd now, it's all become clear.\nSS-5 Incident Case Files updated in my Organizer.\n???:\n...Is that really the case, I wonder?\nKay:\nHuh!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nLang:\nWho's there!?\nEdgeworth:\n(That bell... it's...!) ...Sirhan Dogen!\nLang:\nYou! Why are you here!?\nGumshoe:\nHow can you just brazenly show up here!? Who do you think you are, pal!?\nDogen:\nI found the conversation most intriguing, and I just... well...\nEdgeworth:\nHeh. Are you feeling nostalgic about an old murder of yours?\nLang:\nYou're the one who killed Huang...!\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh heh. Nostalgia? I think not. You were speaking about the person I am searching for.\nEdgeworth:\nYou're searching for someone?\nDogen:\nI escaped from prison in order to meet with a young acolyte... The one who wore the red raincoat...\nEdgeworth:\nThe red raincoat!?\nKay:\nWh-Who is this person?\nDogen:\nI suspect that it's the same person as the mastermind you are searching for.\nEdgeworth:\n!\n???:\nSomeone you've been searching for. The one in the red hood...\nEdgeworth:\n(The red hood?)\nDogen:\nDon't they seem surprised, Anubis? Yes, yes they are, my boy. Twelve years ago, this young acolyte saved my life...\n-- Dogen's Savior --\nDogen:\nCertainly, it was I who killed President Huang.\nHowever, my life was also targeted on that day.\nThe body double, Blaise, and Patricia all sought to seal my lips.\nHad I not been reunited with the young acolyte back then, I would have been in danger.\nBut alas, even to this day, I do not know what has become of the young acolyte...\nEdgeworth:\nSo your client was indeed the body double, who was the main perpetrator of the crime.\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh. It was a long time ago, but I remember his words even now.\nThere have been countless attempts on my life. Not just once or twice. Countless! And yet, why must I be the only one to face the danger? When I stand before the people, I garner the same respect as the president does. Tell me, just what is the difference between him and me!?\nDogen:\nThe difference was great. While the voice and style of speech may be the same... Keh heh heh. One can mimic the body, but the heart cannot be reproduced.\nEdgeworth:\n(I suppose his own weaknesses cost him in his quest to become a leader.)\nKnightley:\nNow that Rooke's gone, I'm in charge!\nde Killer:\nI'm not sure if you're as capable as Rooke was...\nKnightley:\nWh-What are you saying!? I'm totally the leader now!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmph... perhaps the king and his knight were not so different after all.)\nDogen:\nThe double believed that the president's only weakness was a woman called Amy. To find the woman, he needed the assistance of someone from this country.\nEdgeworth:\nSo, he joined forced with Blaise...\nDogen:\nAfter determining her whereabouts, he simply waited for the right opportunity.\nKay:\nThat chance came with the meeting at the orphanage.\nDogen:\nIndeed. The director of the orphanage was bribed and brought in as an accomplice.\nEdgeworth:\n(He must be referring to Patricia Roland.)\nDogen:\nWell. Given what I've told you, do you realize the whereabouts of the young acolyte now?\nEdgeworth:\nYou mean the boy who saved you. But, how do you know that he is the mastermind?\nDogen:\n...That day, the young one caused a fire at the garden of the orphanage.\nKay:\nAh! You're talking about the kid who started the fire as a prank!\nDogen:\nA prank...? Keh heh heh, not at all. On that night 12 years ago, the young acolyte was hiding inside the igloo... It seems he witnessed Patricia Roland and Blaise moving the body from his hiding place. Apparently, he heard them talking during that time. It would seem that they were planning to kill me because I knew the truth. He immediately came to the main hall to tell me that. I learned this about the young acolyte some time later... It seems he was wearing a red raincoat at the time. He led me out of the main hall. And then, the young acolyte... ...said he was going to get rid of our footprints. So he scattered some lamp oil near the igloo over the snow. Then he boldly set the oil ablaze!\nKay:\nAh! No way! So he set the fire in order to...!\nDogen:\nAll their focus was diverted towards the burning flames. I took the opportunity to escape through the rear exit.\nEdgeworth:\nSo, the boy in the red raincoat is the mastermind behind this case?\nDogen:\nExactly. Isn't that right, Anubis? Yes, boy. Yes it is.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You admitted that rather easily. Dogen: These days, I have long grown tired of killing. ...Keh heh heh. But in those halcyon days, I devoted myself to the path of an executioner. If one cannot admit that much, what can he admit? Right, Anubis? Yes, yes, my boy. Kay: I feel like he's saying something scary, but it's kind of hard to understand him! Edgeworth: This fallen priest is saying he has no feelings about the president's death. (Dogen, the assassin and escaped prisoner. He should be a despicable opponent, but... ...silencing him now would be imprudent. I must keep my composure and let him talk!) I understand your point. ...You killed the president. Dogen: That is correct. The aim of my blade never misses its mark.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Your life was targeted? You, the assassin? Kay: The hunter becomes the hunted. The Buddhist becomes the Buddha. Edgeworth: Kay, you don't have to make up strange proverbs. Dogen: ...Life is transient. Especially for an assassin, whose life is always exposed to danger. Kay: So, does that mean people you've tried to kill have fought back? Dogen: That is a rare occurrence... However, this was different.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Sirhan Dogen. You are a master assassin. As such, could you not have evaded an attack from those three and fled the scene...? Dogen: Keh heh heh. You greatly overestimate me. Without Anubis by my side, I would not even be able to walk about. If those three were to attack me all at once, I would not stand a chance. Edgeworth: I see. So even an assassin will fall to superior numbers in a frontal assault. Dogen: I suppose one could say that. I, Sirhan Dogen, would have suffered a shameful defeat.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Reunited...? So, when did you first meet with him? Dogen: That would be 18 years ago, on the 24th of December. Edgeworth: (That is a rather long time ago...) Dogen: On that day, our roles were reversed. I saved the young one's life. There was an unusual snowstorm on that day. The temperature was well below freezing. I took Anubis for a walk in the snow. That's when Anubis noticed something and started running. I followed after him and found a car. I had great difficulty opening the door. It had frozen shut. In the back seat... there were two young children, shivering from the cold. Edgeworth: Two children? Dogen: Had they remained in the car for an hour longer, they surely would have frozen to death. I brought the two of them to a nearby orphanage... Edgeworth: (Is there anything about Dogen's story that concerns me?) There is something Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Leave him be Edgeworth: (I don't think there's anything in particular that stands out...) Dogen, please continue your testimony. Edgeworth: (What concerns me is...) The date Leads to: \"The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that?\" The number of children Edgeworth: There were two children in the car... you're sure of that? Dogen: It may have been 18 years ago, but I remember it clearly. There were two children in the car, there is no mistaking it. Does the good prosecutor have a problem with that number? Edgeworth: (Right now, the number of children isn't what I have a problem with.) Dogen: Are we done talking about this subject yet? Leads back to: \"(What concerns me is...)\" The model of the car Edgeworth: What was the model of the car the children were in? Dogen: The model of the car? What would you want to know that for? It was a typical mid-size car, the kind you see everywhere. Other than the freezing children sitting inside, there was nothing unusual about it. Edgeworth: (...Looks like the car model is of no real importance.) Dogen: Are we done talking about this subject yet? Leads back to: \"(What concerns me is...)\" Edgeworth: The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that? Dogen: There is no mistake. Ray: C-Could that mean...!? Edgeworth: (I know... the significance behind that date.) What shows the significance of the date when Dogen found the children? Present IS-7 Incident Documents Edgeworth: Leads to: \"That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This piece of evidence is connected to that date, isn't it? Kay: Ummm... How exactly is it connected? Dogen: I don't know what the good prosecutor brought out... ...but I can sense that there is no real connection behind it. Edgeworth: Nnghhoooh! (Dogen saw through it.) Kay: Mr. Dogen found the children on December 24th! Let's try looking at the evidence again with that date in mind! Leads back to: \"(I know... the significance behind that date.)\" Leads to: \"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\" Edgeworth: (I don't think there's anything in particular that stands out...) Dogen, please continue your testimony. Leads to: \"The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that?\" Edgeworth: There were two children in the car... you're sure of that? Dogen: It may have been 18 years ago, but I remember it clearly. There were two children in the car, there is no mistaking it. Does the good prosecutor have a problem with that number? Edgeworth: (Right now, the number of children isn't what I have a problem with.) Dogen: Are we done talking about this subject yet?

Kay: Mr. Dogen found the children on December 24th! Let's try looking at the evidence again with that date in mind! Leads back to: \"(I know... the significance behind that date.)\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: And now you're searching for the boy from all those years ago? Surely, you're not saying you want to thank him for saving you? Dogen: Keh heh heh... Well, who knows. However, the young one did save my life. That is the truth. Even Anubis took a liking to him. He would do tricks for him, such as \"shake\" or \"roll over\". Kay: I thought that the tricks Dogen taught his dog were a little bit different from the norm, though. Dogen: You are right about that. For Anubis, \"roll over\" means first biting the victim's foot... Kay: Stop! Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear any more! Dogen: Keh heh heh... There is no need to worry, I only showed the young one ordinary tricks. Edgeworth: (...Hmm. I get the feeling that Dogen, in his own way, felt indebted to the boy.)\nKay: Mr. Dogen and that \"acolyte\" seem to share a complicated relationship, huh.\nEdgeworth: Perhaps there is a hint to the mastermind's motive hidden somewhere in his testimony. Dogen is one of the few people who knows the mastermind first hand... Let's try to draw out as much information as possible from him.",

But in those halcyon days, I devoted myself to the path of an executioner. If one cannot admit that much, what can he admit? Right, Anubis? Yes, yes, my boy.\nKay:\nI feel like he's saying something scary, but it's kind of hard to understand him!\nEdgeworth:\nThis fallen priest is saying he has no feelings about the president's death. (Dogen, the assassin and escaped prisoner. He should be a despicable opponent, but... ...silencing him now would be imprudent. I must keep my composure and let him talk!) I understand your point. ...You killed the president.\nDogen:\nThat is correct. The aim of my blade never misses its mark.\nDogen:\nHowever, my life was also targeted on that day.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour life was targeted? You, the assassin?\nKay:\nThe hunter becomes the hunted. The Buddhist becomes the Buddha.\nEdgeworth:\nKay, you don't have to make up strange proverbs.\nDogen:\n...Life is transient. Especially for an assassin, whose life is always exposed to danger.\nKay:\nSo, does that mean people you've tried to kill have fought back?\nDogen:\nThat is a rare occurrence... However, this was different.\nDogen:\nThe body double, Blaise, and Patricia all sought to seal my lips.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSirhan Dogen. You are a master assassin. As such, could you not have evaded an attack from those three and fled the scene...?\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh. You greatly overestimate me. Without Anubis by my side, I would not even be able to walk about. If those three were to attack me all at once, I would not stand a chance.\nEdgeworth:\nI see. So even an assassin will fall to superior numbers in a frontal assault.\nDogen:\nI suppose one could say that. I, Sirhan Dogen, would have suffered a shameful defeat.\nDogen:\nHad I not been reunited with the young acolyte back then, I would have been in danger.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nReunited...? So, when did you first meet with him?\nDogen:\nThat would be 18 years ago, on the 24th of December.\nEdgeworth:\n(That is a rather long time ago...)\nDogen:\nOn that day, our roles were reversed. I saved the young one's life. There was an unusual snowstorm on that day. The temperature was well below freezing. I took Anubis for a walk in the snow. That's when Anubis noticed something and started running. I followed after him and found a car. I had great difficulty opening the door. It had frozen shut. In the back seat... there were two young children, shivering from the cold.\nEdgeworth:\nTwo children?\nDogen:\nHad they remained in the car for an hour longer, they surely would have frozen to death. I brought the two of them to a nearby orphanage...\nEdgeworth:\n(Is there anything about Dogen's story that concerns me?)\n\n\n\nThere is something\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You didn't get a good look? Then how did you know he was dead?\"\n\n\n\n\nLeave him be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I don't think there's anything in particular that stands out...) Dogen, please continue your testimony.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(What concerns me is...)\n\n\n\nThe date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that?\"\n\n\n\n\nThe number of children\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere were two children in the car... you're sure of that?\nDogen:\nIt may have been 18 years ago, but I remember it clearly. There were two children in the car, there is no mistaking it. Does the good prosecutor have a problem with that number?\nEdgeworth:\n(Right now, the number of children isn't what I have a problem with.)\nDogen:\nAre we done talking about this subject yet?\nLeads back to:\n\"(What concerns me is...)\"\n\n\n\n\nThe model of the car\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was the model of the car the children were in?\nDogen:\nThe model of the car? What would you want to know that for? It was a typical mid-size car, the kind you see everywhere. Other than the freezing children sitting inside, there was nothing unusual about it.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Looks like the car model is of no real importance.)\nDogen:\nAre we done talking about this subject yet?\nLeads back to:\n\"(What concerns me is...)\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe 24th of December, 18 years ago... Are you sure about that?\nDogen:\nThere is no mistake.\nRay:\nC-Could that mean...!?\nEdgeworth:\n(I know... the significance behind that date.) What shows the significance of the date when Dogen found the children?\n\n\n\nPresent IS-7 Incident Documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"That day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis piece of evidence is connected to that date, isn't it?\nKay:\nUmmm... How exactly is it connected?\nDogen:\nI don't know what the good prosecutor brought out... ...but I can sense that there is no real connection behind it.\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (Dogen saw through it.)\nKay:\nMr. Dogen found the children on December 24th! Let's try looking at the evidence again with that date in mind!\nLeads back to:\n\"(I know... the significance behind that date.)\"\nDogen:\nBut alas, even to this day, I do not know what has become of the young acolyte...\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAnd now you're searching for the boy from all those years ago? Surely, you're not saying you want to thank him for saving you?\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh... Well, who knows. However, the young one did save my life. That is the truth. Even Anubis took a liking to him. He would do tricks for him, such as \"shake\" or \"roll over\".\nKay:\nI thought that the tricks Dogen taught his dog were a little bit different from the norm, though.\nDogen:\nYou are right about that. For Anubis, \"roll over\" means first biting the victim's foot...\nKay:\nStop! Stop! Stop! I don't want to hear any more!\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh... There is no need to worry, I only showed the young one ordinary tricks.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Hmm. I get the feeling that Dogen, in his own way, felt indebted to the boy.)\nKay:\nMr. Dogen and that \"acolyte\" seem to share a complicated relationship, huh.\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps there is a hint to the mastermind's motive hidden somewhere in his testimony. Dogen is one of the few people who knows the mastermind first hand... Let's try to draw out as much information as possible from him.\nEdgeworth:\nThat day... a certain incident occurred. A sculptor was murdered.\nKay:\nAh!\nEdgeworth:\nDuring that incident, two young boys went missing. The sons of the victim, Isaac Dover, and the culprit, Dane Gustavia...\nRay:\nWe never did find out where those two boys went after the case 18 years ago...\nDogen:\nOh? They were the sons of a victim and a culprit? It all makes sense now.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat makes sense?\nDogen:\nOne of the youths was bound, so that he could not move.\nKay:\nMr. Dover did it so that Mr. Gustavia's son couldn't come to the contest venue.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. Gustavia was using his own son as a taste tester.\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh heh. To think that was what transpired. Neither child seemed to recall what had happened.\nEdgeworth:\nThey lost their memories?\nDogen:\nThe acolyte told me this when we were reunited 12 years ago. The pair were placed in an extreme situation, on the verge of freezing to death... That trauma led them both to suffer from amnesia. Neither could so much as remember his own name.\nKay:\nSo they didn't even know that they were the sons of Mr. Dover and Mr. Gustavia.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed, while we cannot say it conclusively, the probability is quite high. (However, we still don't have enough information to deduce the mastermind's identity...) Dogen... Would you please continue your story?\nDogen:\nKeh heh. Very well.\n-- Dogen and the \"Acolyte\" --\nDogen:\nI continued my correspondence with the young acolyte even after entering prison.\nRecently, that has all come to an abrupt halt, however. It left me quite concerned.\nFurthermore, those involved in the crime 12 years ago were all drawn into incidents one by one.\nI grew more and more curious. And so I absconded briefly from the prison.\nEdgeworth:\nThose involved 12 years ago... ...were Patricia Roland, Blaise Debeste, and President Huang's body double.\nKay:\nAnd Ms. Roland was the warden of Mr. Dogen's prison.\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh. I blackmailed the warden. That woman had tried to kill me. Perhaps the good prosecutor has already deduced the reason?\nEdgeworth:\nYou murdered President Huang... However, the world still believed he was alive. If you were able to prove the president was a fake... ...both Patricia Roland and Blaise Debeste would have been in danger.\nDogen:\nThat is correct. And I had heard the proof with my own ears.\nI'll be waiting in the courtyard of the orphanage at midnight on February 9th. Even if it's just once, I want John to be able to meet you. I'm sorry if I'm being selfish, but... I'll be waiting.\nHuang:\n...Who might you be? My apologies, but I am presently waiting for someone...\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh. I am well aware of that... President Huang. Are you not meeting with your son? However, I do not spill blood needlessly. You may relax. I seek only the president's life.\nHuang:\n.........It can't be. P-Please wait. I am just about to meet my son for the first time. I'm sure this will be the first and the last time. Please, at least wait until we are finished...\nDogen:\nI had thought the president would beg for his life, but he was of a different sort. Officially, the president had no son. However, he shook his head and said... ...this illegitimate son was his, and he intended to recognize him publicly. Furthermore, he claimed that he had already made preparations towards that end... Would that son of his be the boy with horns over there by any chance?\nKay:\nBoy... with the horns? Wait, you can see John's horns?\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh. There is no need to see them. From the moment I escaped from prison until now... ...I have been closely lending an ear to your voices.\nEdgeworth:\n(He said that the president made \"preparations\" towards recognizing his son... ...but the word \"preparations\" alone would be insufficient for blackmail.) ........That's it!\nLang:\nThere was one thing that could prove Huang's words: the will held by the House of Lang. It was also proof of his trust in us. His son's existence would've been revealed to the world.\nDogen:\nThe name on the recording, the mention of preparations, and the will in Zheng Fa... Keh heh heh. Together, they sufficed to make the Warden bow to my words.\nEdgeworth:\n(With those three pieces of information, one could prove the identity of the double... ...by using John!)\nJohn:\n..........\nDogen:\nThe president blocked the first strike of my knife with something soft. As pieces of it fell atop the snow, I struck once more. This time, the blow proved fatal.\nEdgeworth:\n(So Dogen cut off the Moozilla doll's horn...)\nDogen:\nNone but I heard his final words. Only myself and that child knew of the president's secret son.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: In other words, you contacted him from prison? Dogen: Keh heh heh. That is correct. A post-office box was used. Kay: A post-office box...? Edgeworth: It would allow one to send and receive letters without revealing the recipient's location. Dogen: I could not use a form of correspondence that would reveal the acolyte's location. ...There was someone keeping watch over my correspondences, after all. Edgeworth: (He must mean the prison warden... Patricia Roland.) Could you be more specific about the nature of your correspondences? Dogen: Well. They were mainly moves from my correspondence chess matches. Kay: C-Correspondence chess? If I recall, the person you were playing against... Edgeworth: This might be hard to believe... but Dogen's chess opponent was... Kay: Ah! Are you saying he was playing against Mr. Knightley? Wasn't it Horace Knightley? Edgeworth: We certainly found the correspondence chess memo in Knightley's cell. Correspondence Chess Memo jotted down in my Organizer. Ray: Does that mean... Knightley-boy was the kid from the IS-7 Incident? Edgeworth: (Could... that really be true? Is there any evidence connecting Knightley to the IS-7 Incident?) Present Knightley's Mementos Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence. Ray: What about it? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think it has anything to do with the incident at all, though. Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (Perhaps I should think it over one more time?) Ray: Why don't you look over Knightley-boy's belongings one more time? Something related to the IS-7 Incident just might pop out! Edgeworth: (Knightley's belongings, huh? Let's look over them one more time...) Edgeworth: (This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within? Which should I investigate? The ring or the chessboard...?) The ring Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" The chessboard Edgeworth: (Obviously, we should investigate the chessboard.) Ray: Huh? Miles, what are you doing taking out the chessboard? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think the chessboard has anything to do with the IS-7 Incident. Edgeworth: Argh! (He may be right... In that case, the only piece of evidence left to investigate is...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: This ring is...! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth, what is it? Edgeworth: Mr. Shields, please take a look at this ring! Ray: Th-This pattern is... It's Pierre Hoquet's! Edgeworth: I thought so... He had Mr. Dover's seal turned into a ring. However, why would he have this? Shouldn't it have been held by the police as evidence from the IS-7 Incident? Ray: After the incident, the seal was returned to the victim's next-of-kin. And Mr. Dover's only family was his son. But since no one knew where the son had gone to, it took a while to get it to him. I'd heard that the police had finally found him and delivered his inheritance, but... Edgeworth: ...So the seal was thereby safely delivered to his son. And then, he turned the seal into a ring and wore it on his person. Knightley's Mementos data updated in my Organizer. Kay: So... Mr. Knightley was Mr. Dover's son... Ray: The police aren't fools. I'm sure they did a thorough check before handing over the seal. Kay: If someone involved in the IS-7 Incident was his chess opponent... Lang: Knightley, huh. Then that man must be the mastermind behind this case! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But, Knightley is dead! He cannot be involved in this incident. Ray: How about that. The only one who could be the mastermind was himself a murder victim...? Kay: But a dead guy can't be the culprit! So there's no way that's right! Edgeworth: (It certainly is strange... In that case, who is the culprit?) Add statement: \"Writing letters in braille can be a rather enjoyable pastime.\" Edgeworth: Leads to: \"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Shields. I'd like you to take a look at this piece of evidence. Ray: What about it? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think it has anything to do with the incident at all, though. Edgeworth: M... Mmph. (Perhaps I should think it over one more time?) Ray: Why don't you look over Knightley-boy's belongings one more time? Something related to the IS-7 Incident just might pop out! Edgeworth: (Knightley's belongings, huh? Let's look over them one more time...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\" Edgeworth: (Obviously, we should investigate the chessboard.) Ray: Huh? Miles, what are you doing taking out the chessboard? Are you saying it's evidence that connects Knightley-boy to the IS-7 Incident? Uncle Ray doesn't think the chessboard has anything to do with the IS-7 Incident. Edgeworth: Argh! (He may be right... In that case, the only piece of evidence left to investigate is...) Leads to: \"This ring is...!\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: That was your means of playing correspondence chess. You used chess notation for your moves. Dogen: Keh heh heh... as expected, the good prosecutor has done a thorough investigation. Kay: His chess opponent was Horace Knightley, right? Edgeworth: The ring Knightley wore... Mr. Shields, please have a close look at it. Ray: Yeah, there's no mistake. This is the evidence from the IS-7 Incident. The police found Mr. Dover's son and returned it to him. If you're saying that the son was Knightley, then... ...the acolyte, who was Dogen's chess opponent and the mastermind, was Knightley? Edgeworth: No, Knightley has already been murdered. He cannot be at the center of the incident. There is no doubt that the mastermind is still hiding somewhere out there. Kay: ...Well then, Mr. Dogen. Sorry to have kept you waiting. Dogen: Hmm... that was a rather interesting tale. Wasn't it, Anubis? I shall continue my story about the acolyte. Our longstanding chess match continued... Edgeworth: (It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.) Dogen: Good boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: It came to a halt? Now, of all times? Dogen: Quite odd, is it not? Anubis told me again and again how odd it was. Kay: That scary dog talked? Was he like, \"Something's odd, woof!\"? Dogen: Keh heh heh. I can understand Anubis's heart, even if he does not voice his thoughts. Kay: Umm... Then, there's something I'd like to ask, just in case. Your scary dog's staring at me right now... He's not saying, \"I'm hungry. I want some meat\", right? Dogen: Keh heh heh... Perhaps. Kay: P... Perhaps... Aaaaah... M-Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.) Dogen: Good boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: That certainly does seem too much for a mere coincidence. The body double of Di-Jun Huang, the president of Zheng Fa faked an assassination plot. Patricia Roland, the prison warden, murdered Horace Knightley. And Blaise Debeste, the Chairman of the P.I.C, murdered Jill Crane. (Come to think of it, as I have been investigating these cases... ...I have felt the presence of some force behind the scenes.) Dogen: Keh heh heh. Even within the prison, I could tell that this was no insignificant event.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You absconded briefly from prison? I cannot forgive such a criminal act! Kay: You stole your way out of prison? I cannot forgive such a thieving act! Dogen: Keh heh heh... Relax. No one was hurt. I merely have connections that allow me to set foot outside. Gumshoe: B-But even so, you can't just escape from prison, pal! Arrest him! Arrest him! Dogen: That won't be necessary. Once my business is done, I shall return to my cell. Lang: ...You trying to make fools of us? A prison isn't the kind of place you can just enter and leave at will! Dogen: Keh heh heh. The Wolf may say that... ...but one can see that the Wolf and his pack also share an interest in the tales of my past. Lang: Tch...! Edgeworth: Agent Lang, Detective Gumshoe. There are still a few things I must ask Dogen. Please postpone matters until then. Gumshoe: Yes, sir! I knew you'd say that, Mr. Edgeworth! Lang: Dammit all... But I'm not taking my eye off you for a second!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Excuse me, but you wrote your letters in braille? Dogen: Indeed. For I possess the tools necessary to write in braille. Kay: Wow. So you need to use tools to write in braille. I never knew. Edgeworth: Then, would you please tell us what you wrote? Dogen: Everything. Letters, of course, and also the movements of the chess pieces. Edgeworth: (He wrote the movements of the chess pieces by hand? That statement is... intriguing.) Kay: So then, how does your handmade dog piece move? Edgeworth: Kay, that question can wait. So then... what did you do when the letters stopped coming? Dogen: Keh heh heh... Within the prison, I grew increasingly concerned about the acolyte's whereabouts.\nKay: OK, OK... Umm... But even so, I don't really get it. Who exactly is this \"acolyte\"?\nEdgeworth: Indeed. Dogen himself has not yet made that clear. (What's important is the thread connecting Dogen and this \"acolyte\": their correspondence. And not just the letters. We should pay attention to the means that was used as well.)",

He cannot be at the center of the incident. There is no doubt that the mastermind is still hiding somewhere out there.\nKay:\n...Well then, Mr. Dogen. Sorry to have kept you waiting.\nDogen:\nHmm... that was a rather interesting tale. Wasn't it, Anubis? I shall continue my story about the acolyte. Our longstanding chess match continued...\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.)\nDogen:\nGood boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt.\nDogen:\nRecently, that has all come to an abrupt halt, however. It left me quite concerned.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt came to a halt? Now, of all times?\nDogen:\nQuite odd, is it not? Anubis told me again and again how odd it was.\nKay:\nThat scary dog talked? Was he like, \"Something's odd, woof!\"?\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh. I can understand Anubis's heart, even if he does not voice his thoughts.\nKay:\nUmm... Then, there's something I'd like to ask, just in case. Your scary dog's staring at me right now... He's not saying, \"I'm hungry. I want some meat\", right?\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh... Perhaps.\nKay:\nP... Perhaps... Aaaaah... M-Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems she's not much good with the assassin's dog.)\nDogen:\nGood boy, good boy, there's a good boy. ...So then. At any rate, my correspondence with the acolyte suddenly came to an abrupt halt.\nDogen:\nFurthermore, those involved in the crime 12 years ago were all drawn into incidents one by one.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat certainly does seem too much for a mere coincidence. The body double of Di-Jun Huang, the president of Zheng Fa faked an assassination plot. Patricia Roland, the prison warden, murdered Horace Knightley. And Blaise Debeste, the Chairman of the P.I.C, murdered Jill Crane. (Come to think of it, as I have been investigating these cases... ...I have felt the presence of some force behind the scenes.)\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh. Even within the prison, I could tell that this was no insignificant event.\nDogen:\nI grew more and more curious. And so I absconded briefly from the prison.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou absconded briefly from prison? I cannot forgive such a criminal act!\nKay:\nYou stole your way out of prison? I cannot forgive such a thieving act!\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh... Relax. No one was hurt. I merely have connections that allow me to set foot outside.\nGumshoe:\nB-But even so, you can't just escape from prison, pal! Arrest him! Arrest him!\nDogen:\nThat won't be necessary. Once my business is done, I shall return to my cell.\nLang:\n...You trying to make fools of us? A prison isn't the kind of place you can just enter and leave at will!\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh. The Wolf may say that... ...but one can see that the Wolf and his pack also share an interest in the tales of my past.\nLang:\nTch...!\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang, Detective Gumshoe. There are still a few things I must ask Dogen. Please postpone matters until then.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir! I knew you'd say that, Mr. Edgeworth!\nLang:\nDammit all... But I'm not taking my eye off you for a second!\nDogen:\nWriting letters in braille can be a rather enjoyable pastime.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me, but you wrote your letters in braille?\nDogen:\nIndeed. For I possess the tools necessary to write in braille.\nKay:\nWow. So you need to use tools to write in braille. I never knew.\nEdgeworth:\nThen, would you please tell us what you wrote?\nDogen:\nEverything. Letters, of course, and also the movements of the chess pieces.\nEdgeworth:\n(He wrote the movements of the chess pieces by hand? That statement is... intriguing.)\nKay:\nSo then, how does your handmade dog piece move?\nEdgeworth:\nKay, that question can wait. So then... what did you do when the letters stopped coming?\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh... Within the prison, I grew increasingly concerned about the acolyte's whereabouts.\nPresent Correspondence Chess Memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm certain you said... You wrote your letters in braille.\"\nKay:\nOK, OK... Umm... But even so, I don't really get it. Who exactly is this \"acolyte\"?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. Dogen himself has not yet made that clear. (What's important is the thread connecting Dogen and this \"acolyte\": their correspondence. And not just the letters. We should pay attention to the means that was used as well.)\nEdgeworth:\nI'm certain you said... You wrote your letters in braille.\nDogen:\nCorrect. The good prosecutor must know that I am lacking in sight, do you not?\nEdgeworth:\nThe correspondence chess letter we found had been typed out using a word processor.\nDogen:\nWhat? That... cannot be.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean...?\nKay:\nSo, someone went of their way to retype the letters on a computer?\nEdgeworth:\nCould another person have acted as a middleman between Dogen and Knightley?\nKay:\nWhat do you mean?\nEdgeworth:\nDogen wrote his letters in braille. However... ...by the time it reached Knightley, it had been rewritten on a word processor. ...We must assume that some middleman rewrote those letters.\nRay:\nAnd the reverse can also be said. That same somebody might've taken the letters Knightley wrote and redelivered them to Dogen.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, that is indeed true.\nCorrespondence Chess Memo updated in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nKnightley and Dogen both communicated through a certain individual... Dogen, were the letters that reached you...\nDogen:\nThey were in braille, of course.\nRay:\nSo Knightley-boy's letters must have been transposed by that same person as well.\nDogen:\nOh...? Then that somebody must be...\nEdgeworth:\n...the mastermind behind the case.\nLang:\nLang:\nYou're saying there's someone else who's the mastermind behind this case!? Then who the hell is it!?\nEdgeworth:\nDover's son, Knightley, is already deceased. In that case, there is one more youth that we should consider to be the mastermind.\nLang:\nYou mean, Dane Gustavia's son...? But, who the heck is he?\nEdgeworth:\n(If Knightley is Dover's son, then Gustavia's son must be...)\n???:\nWell, we're the only friends either of us has had since childhood... He was... the same as me. We never had real families.\nEdgeworth:\n(It can't be... could it? Could it really be him?)\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth, what is it? You've gone all pale!\nEdgeworth:\nI've figured it out... ...The identity of the mastermind who's been controlling this case from the shadows!\nKay:\nWhaaaat!? Who in the world is it!?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't want to believe it myself... but it is someone we know quite well. The mastermind is...!\nPresent Simon Keyes profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"(This was all that Knightley left behind. Could there be a clue hidden within?)\"\nPresent anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nKay:\nWhaaat!? That person is the mastermind!? But, according to what we've been saying, something seems kinda wrong...\nEdgeworth:\n...Naturally. This person has no relation to the mastermind, after all.\nKay:\nAre they related or not!? Please take this more seriously!\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! (I have to think carefully... Knightley is Dover's son. In that case, Gustavia's son is...)\n\n\nRegina:\nMr. Knightley was his only childhood friend.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(It must be this person!)\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! Who is the mastermind behind this case?\nLeads back to:\n\"The mastermind is...!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(The mastermind behind this case... ...sent a letter to Jill Crane, which deceived Blaise. Furthermore, he kidnapped John and eavesdropped on us. However, of all his actions, the one I have not been able to get out of my mind... ...is how he brought an unconscious Kay to the roof.) ...............The Giant Monster.\nKay:\nHuh? ...Did you just say something?\nEdgeworth:\n(That's right. The key to exposing the mastermind... is in the monster's true form.)\nSimon:\nAh... I-I almost forgot! Um, if you'd like... Please come to our next show! I-I'll also... be performing in it.\nRegina:\nThe Berry Big Circus is always fabulous and fun for all ages!\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Swift, there is something I would like to ask of you.\nNicole:\nWh-What! Ya mean me?\nEdgeworth:\nYou said that you recorded the sound of Moozilla spewing flames.\nEdgeworth:\n...Would this decisive evidence of yours be something you recorded on that tape recorder?\nNicole:\nThat's Mr. Edgeworth for ya! Yer good at figurin' things out, aren't ya!? It's the sound of Moozilla spewin' out fire. This place nearly became a sea of flames!\nNicole:\nThat's right. I ain't actually seen it with my own eyes, though...\nEdgeworth:\nCould you let us listen to the tape?\nNicole:\nSure thing. ...There we go!\nEdgeworth:\n(This sound, it's as I thought...! So, it seems that my reasoning was correct. The true nature of the monster and the mastermind... all of my logic is coming together!) Ms. Hart! You said that you captured a giant eye on film, did you not?\nLotta:\nSure did, right here in this photo.\nEdgeworth:\n(Though we cannot confirm it like this...) Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nLend us your film analysis device!\nGumshoe:\nOK, but... What do you want to analyze, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nThis photo, please!\nGumshoe:\nI'm on it!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is there a new clue in this photo?)\nPresent giant eyeball (after zooming)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Th-This is...!\"\nPresent Jill Crane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nKay:\nI can't really tell since the person is wearing a raincoat... ...but, this should be Ms. Crane before she died, right?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. She was Mr. Cameron's love interest. He was murdered 12 years ago.\nKay:\nAnd she was murdered while investigating the mysteries of that past case... I'm sure she must've been very sad and frustrated by all that happened... We're... gonna finish what Ms. Crane set out to do! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. That was my intention all along. Just leave it to me.\nLeads back to:\n\"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)\"\nPresent ladder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nKay:\nAh! It's a ladder! We climbed up this ladder earlier, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, we did. (...Countless times since yesterday.)\nKay:\nTake a look at this ladder... It's not bad, per se, but you can see how the gap between the steps is a little too wide. And these handrails would be way easier to grasp if they were just a bit more rounded. And also, the steps don't fell quite right when you're climbing on them for some reason. Hmm. I don't want to be too critical, so I'll give it around... 198 points!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Out of what?)\nLeads back to:\n\"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's nothing unusual about this area.\nLeads back to:\n\"(Is there a new clue in this photo?)\"\nGumshoe:\nTh-This is...!\nLotta:\nSee!? Ain't the Moozilla's eye right where I said it would be!?\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... I see.

You are, ain't ya!? Yer admittin' that the Mighty Moozilla is real!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nNo... This is not Moozilla. This is the eye of a different monster. Please have a look at this.\nKay:\nIt's a flyer for the Berry Big Circus...? Aah! Th-This is...!\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. There is a rather large balloon with the head of a lion pictured here. This balloon is the true identity of the Giant Monster! In addition, the sound Ms. Swift recorded, which she believes to be Moozilla spewing flames...\nNicole:\nMr. Prosecutor... don't tell me, yer gonna say somethin' that'll shatter my dreams of a scoop...\nGumshoe:\nHot air balloons fly by using burners to hear the air, right, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely, Detective. The mastermind used this monster of his... ...to bring Kay to the rooftop of the Grand Tower without using the elevator!\nKay:\nWouldn't that mean... that the mastermind is someone connected to the circus?\nRay:\nHe's a member of the circus, Knightley's friend, and... Dane Gustavia's son. Wh... Who'd have thunk it...!?\nEdgeworth:\nAn apprentice beast tamer? Heh..... He's no amateur. For the beast he has tamed is none other than this entire case! Simon Keyes! He is the mastermind behind this whole incident!\nKay:\nM-Mr. Keyes... was really behind it all...? N-No way...! I don't believe it! I mean, we trusted him! How could it all have been a lie!? That's just... heartbreaking...\nEdgeworth:\nKay.....\nEdgeworth:\nHm...? What is it?\nJohn:\nHey, you! Stop! Where do you think you're going!?\nDogen:\nKeh heh heh heh... The boy with horns is rather perceptive. ...The good prosecutor has done a remarkable job. Now that I have heard that, I have no further business here.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat... Wait! Dogen!\nGrrr... *ruff, ruff!*\nLang:\nDammit! Where'd he vanish to!?\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! Are you OK!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I'm fine. However...\nJohn:\n.....That guy...!\nEdgeworth:\n...John?\nJohn:\nThat Dogen guy... he's the one who killed my dad, right?\nEdgeworth:\n(There is no question more difficult to answer. However...) There's no use in denying the truth. Yes, John... You are correct.\nJohn:\nHe'll pay for this... I swear he's gonna pay...! I... I'll make him pay myse...\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nJohn! You mustn't finish that thought! ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please pay us no mind.\nEdgeworth:\n......\nGumshoe:\nSir! I've put out an APB on Dogen! All available police units will be searching for him!\nLang:\n...You heard the man, kid. I don't mean to be heartless, but we need to hurry, too. So Mr. Prosecutor, where's the mastermind right now?\nEdgeworth:\n...Agent Lang is right. Our top priority right now should be catching the mastermind. He said he would be practicing. He is most likely at the Berry Big Circus tent. But first... Agent Lang, I have a request.\nLang:\nA request...? What is it?\nEdgeworth:\nNow that we've identified the Giant Monster, our next order of business... is to capture it. The moment we arrive at the tent, I need you to locate that specific item posthaste. And Detective, I ask that you perform a follow-up investigation on the kidnapping incident.\nGumshoe:\nRoger that, sir!\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth. I wanna help out too!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. In that case, you'll be in charge of calling for backup. If he is truly the mastermind, we may require assistance from a certain someone... (I met him so many times, yet his facade always fooled me into sympathy. He may have got the better of me in the past... but this time, I'll settle it once and for all!)\nTo be continued.\nApril 6, 5:30 PMBerry Big CircusStorage Tent\nRegina:\nAh! Mr. Edgeworth!\nSimon:\nAre you guys here for the show?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Keyes... Ms. Berry...\nSimon:\nYou're a little early... I'm sorry, but we're still getting ready... But, I'm so happy you came! You remembered our promise!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I remembered... You asked us to come and see the show when you gave me this.\nSimon:\n...I'm so happy you came! Please enjoy yourselves! I'm sure my performance will surprise you, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nYour \"performance\" has already surprised me, Mr. Keyes.\nSimon:\n..........\nRegina:\nUmm. But he hasn't performed yet...\nEdgeworth:\nRegina. Please have a look at this photo. Is this balloon the property of the Berry Big Circus?\nRegina:\nAh! I-It is! Did you see it flying around somewhere?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's highly likely that this balloon was used by the culprit in the case we are investigating.\nRegina:\nHuh!?\nEdgeworth:\nWho is in charge of the balloon?\nRegina:\nWell, th-that would be S-Simon, but... A-Are you saying...!?\nSimon:\n.........\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Keyes. You flew this balloon in the middle of the night. Did you not?\nSimon:\n...I do occasionally practice alone at night. I'm not much of a pilot though. I'm... a little clumsy.\nEdgeworth:\nHeh. So for practice, you'll do something as challenging as flying a balloon at night? Wouldn't that be rather difficult for someone who is clumsy and \"not much of a pilot\"?\nSimon:\nThen... what do you think I was doing, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nYou brought Kay to the roof of the Grand Tower... ...in order to frame her for the murder of Jill Crane! Not a single security camera recorded Kay using the elevator. Therefore, the only way she could have gotten up there was through flight. And the only one who could have flown her up there... was you, Mr. Keyes.\nSimon:\nNo way... Mr. Edgeworth, how can you say that?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not all. You drugged John at the garbage pickup, and kidnapped him. Wasn't that why you were late when you came to watch the trial of Patricia Roland?\nSimon:\nNo way... I have no idea what you're saying. There's no way I could do things like that. Please believe me... Mr. Edgeworth, please!\nEdgeworth:\nI wanted to believe you. However... you have broken that trust yourself!\nSimon:\nTh... That's horrible. Why would you say that? Didn't you once say that you would trust me? That you'd believe in me?\nKay:\nDon't you worry about that. We're your allies! That's because... we're like birds of a feather! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n(Birds of a feather, huh? ...I suppose that's true.) We have sufficient information about your past. I doubt you had a motive to kill Knightley. Rather, you are probably the most affected by his death. And I doubt someone as timid as you could work up the courage to murder someone. Alright. I'll get you out of here. ...We'll believe in you.\nSimon:\nI'm so sad... Those words were all lies...\nKay:\nI-It wasn't a lie! We really did trust you...!\nSimon:\nKay, even you? You said we were like birds of a feather, and yet... I'm hurt, Kay. You've hurt me deeply...\nKay:\nI-I-I... oooooh... Hey, Mr. Edgeworth. Maybe Simon isn't a bad guy after all...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI see. So that's how you operate. I understand now, all too well. No matter who you face, you find an emotional weakness and exploit it. You guide each person towards the outcome you desire, without them even noticing it. That... is how you were able to mastermind the entire case!\nSimon:\n........\nEdgeworth:\nI may have fallen for your tricks before... but, not this time. Simon Keyes. I indict you!\nSimon:\n...........Hmm. So, it's come to this after all. You were always so full of confidence, Mr. Edgeworth. But, I rather like that. Because now... I can rip that confidence to shreds. Hah... Good work, everyone.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ngh..... His personality has completely changed!) So, the animal tamer who could not tame animals... That was all a facade. This is the real Simon Keyes.\nRegina:\nS-Simon! That's not... true, is it!?\nSimon:\nTruth or lie... What difference does it make?\nRegina:\nHuh!?\nSimon:\nMr. Edgeworth's just made me a little upset, that's all. Keh heh heh heh. ...You'll take responsibility for upsetting me, right?\n-- Balloon Practice --\nSimon:\nIt's true. I practiced with the balloon two nights ago.\nThat photo must have been taken when the balloon and I passed near the building.\nI often fly around that area for advertising purposes.\nThere's nothing unusual about that, right?\nEdgeworth:\nYou often fly around the Grand Tower in the balloon?\nSimon:\nYeah. Even the circus needs to advertise.\nEdgeworth:\nRegina, is that true?\nRegina:\nY-Yup. It was Simon's job to advertise using the balloon. Most people who live around here should have seen it.\nEdgeworth:\nThat balloon was used in the crime we were investigating.\nSimon:\nLike I said, it's just a coincidence. I simply happened to pass by the Grand Tower when that photo was taken.\nEdgeworth:\nI shall determine whether or not it was a coincidence after I hear your full story.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the balloon launched from this tent? Simon: There's a nice, big park near the Sunshine Coliseum. I always launch the balloon there. Edgeworth: I see. In that case, how do you transport the balloon to the park? Simon: Well, it's too heavy to carry by hand. It weighs several hundred pounds. And yet, it can fly in the sky... Amazing, isn't it? Edgeworth: I asked you how you transported it. Now answer the question. Simon: Aww, I can't even make some small talk...? You're mean, Mr. Edgeworth. I used a truck. The balloon is loaded onto the back of the truck. Edgeworth: A truck...? Simon: Yeah. The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago. Edgeworth: (Hmm. I cannot overlook that piece of testimony...!) Add statement: \"The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Allow me to confirm... You haven't driven the truck since then? Simon: Do you really need to confirm that? I mean, I just said it five seconds ago. Edgeworth: Answer the question. Or would it be inconvenient for you to do so? Simon: Ha ha. That's a pretty weak provocation, coming from you, Mr. Edgeworth! What could be inconvenient about something I've already said? Fine, I get it... That truck has been parked behind the dressing rooms since two days ago. And the balloon and basket are still inside. Is there a problem? Edgeworth: There's no problem. I simply wanted to express my thanks for that piece of testimony. (So the truck was parked here for the past two days... Heh! That was exactly what I wanted to hear, Mr. Keyes!) Simon: ...May I continue? So then, regarding the balloon... }}\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You're saying it was simply a coincidence that you were photographed near the tower? Simon: Ah, I get it. I know how you operate now, Mr. Edgeworth. You'll insist that a coincidence is impossible until you get your way. When you say it like that, everything will inevitably go your way! How scary! Kay: Ugh! You're wrong! Mr. Edgeworth isn't like that... Edgeworth: Kay, calm down. He's only trying to provoke an emotional response. He intends to goad us into losing our focus, in order to derail the topic at hand. ...Now, why do you think he would do that? Kay: Umm, because he's a clown...? No, I mean, because he's trying to hide something, I guess? Edgeworth: Exactly, Kay. We must not let up on him. However, we must continue to keep our composure... Understand? Kay: Yep! So, Simon. Allow me, as the assistant, to ask you a question! When you passed by the Grand Tower at that precise moment, was it really just a coincidence? Simon: ...We could've just left things at that. But... ...for the sake of your assistant, I shall explain my reason for being there.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So, in addition to advertising with the balloon, maintaining the balloon is also your job. Am I wrong? Simon: You're a real stickler for the details, y'know. Yeah, that's right. Ask the boss if you want. ...Right, Boss? Regina: Yup. Simon is in charge of cleaning and fixing and all that stuff with the balloon. I don't think anyone besides Simon has used the balloon for a while now. Edgeworth: (...Hmm. That confirms he was the one riding the balloon in the photo taken two days ago. However, if he is the mastermind, he must have used it today as well. Am I able to prove that?) Simon: Looks like you're deep in thought... Is it really that hard to comprehend? Hot air balloons fly in the sky. And in other news, the sky is blue and the grass is green.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I wonder about that. You flew the balloon in the middle of the night, eerily close to a certain other incident... Would you say there's nothing strange about that, as well? Simon: Mr. Edgeworth, isn't that like a really leading question? Won't you please stop being such a naughty prosecutor? It's kind of downer. It's a clown's job to put smiles on people's faces, after all. Edgeworth: (Hmm... He ducks and weaves around my questions skillfully. Very well. In that case, I will simply have to make use of a more direct attack!)\nEdgeworth: (We still don't know much about the balloon. In any case, I must draw out more information...)",

I know how you operate now, Mr. Edgeworth. You'll insist that a coincidence is impossible until you get your way. When you say it like that, everything will inevitably go your way! How scary!\nKay:\nUgh! You're wrong! Mr. Edgeworth isn't like that...\nEdgeworth:\nKay, calm down. He's only trying to provoke an emotional response. He intends to goad us into losing our focus, in order to derail the topic at hand. ...Now, why do you think he would do that?\nKay:\nUmm, because he's a clown...? No, I mean, because he's trying to hide something, I guess?\nEdgeworth:\nExactly, Kay. We must not let up on him. However, we must continue to keep our composure... Understand?\nKay:\nYep! So, Simon. Allow me, as the assistant, to ask you a question! When you passed by the Grand Tower at that precise moment, was it really just a coincidence?\nSimon:\n...We could've just left things at that. But... ...for the sake of your assistant, I shall explain my reason for being there.\nSimon:\nI often fly around that area for advertising purposes.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo, in addition to advertising with the balloon, maintaining the balloon is also your job. Am I wrong?\nSimon:\nYou're a real stickler for the details, y'know. Yeah, that's right. Ask the boss if you want. ...Right, Boss?\nRegina:\nYup. Simon is in charge of cleaning and fixing and all that stuff with the balloon. I don't think anyone besides Simon has used the balloon for a while now.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Hmm. That confirms he was the one riding the balloon in the photo taken two days ago. However, if he is the mastermind, he must have used it today as well. Am I able to prove that?)\nSimon:\nLooks like you're deep in thought... Is it really that hard to comprehend? Hot air balloons fly in the sky. And in other news, the sky is blue and the grass is green.\nSimon:\nThere's nothing unusual about that, right?\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder about that. You flew the balloon in the middle of the night, eerily close to a certain other incident... Would you say there's nothing strange about that, as well?\nSimon:\nMr. Edgeworth, isn't that like a really leading question? Won't you please stop being such a naughty prosecutor? It's kind of downer. It's a clown's job to put smiles on people's faces, after all.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... He ducks and weaves around my questions skillfully. Very well. In that case, I will simply have to make use of a more direct attack!)\nEdgeworth:\n(We still don't know much about the balloon. In any case, I must draw out more information...)\nEdgeworth:\nThe truck you put the balloon into. Was it blue, by any chance?\nSimon:\nBlue? So what if it is?\nEdgeworth:\nToday, we saw a blue truck carrying a large basket. If that truck just so happened to be yours... ...then your claims that you last used it two days ago becomes a lie.\nSimon:\n........\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang! Ema!\nEma:\nMr. Edgeworth! I've finally found you! I've been searching for you ever since the incident yesterday! I dashed right over after Kay contacted me just a little while ago!\nLang:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. The thing you were looking for. I've found it. It was placed in a blue truck at the dressing room parking lot.\nLion Balloon data jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nA blue truck... as I suspected. That truck is, without a doubt, the one I saw today.\nSimon:\nSimon:\nThere are a number of blue trucks out there, you know? Who's to say you're not mistaking it for a different one?\nKay:\nIt's definitely that one! I got a good look at it!\nEdgeworth?:\nKay:\nHuh? Mr. Edgeworth, was that...?\nEdgeworth:\nI-It wasn't me...!\nSimon:\n\"Kay. Words have no strength without evidence to back them up.\"\nKay:\nAh! That's Mr. Edgeworth's voice!\nSimon:\n\"Evidence! Present evidence!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(Do I have any evidence... ...to prove that this was the truck I saw today?)\nKay:\nHuh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck?\nEdgeworth:\nThe truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time.\nKay:\nYou can figure all that out just by touching it!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat could prove that this is the truck I saw...?\nLooking for bloodstains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI'd like to check to see if there are any bloodstains left on the truck.\nSimon:\nBloodstains? What's the point of looking for bloodstains? Even if there's a luminol reaction, it's not like it will prove anything, right?\nKay:\nI don't really see a point in looking for bloodstains either, Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nM... Mmph. (I'd better come up with something else.)\nSimon:\nIt's not like our brilliant prosecutor to spout out such nonsense. As I thought, there isn't any evidence at all, is there?\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! Is there really no evidence?\nEdgeworth:\n(If this truck is the same as the one I saw today...)\n\n\nKay:\nHuh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck?\nEdgeworth:\nThe truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time.\nKay:\nYou can figure all that out just by touching it!?\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Then there must have been something left in the truck!)\nLeads back to:\n\"What could prove that this is the truck I saw...?\"\nDusting for fingerprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'd like to dust the truck for fingerprints.\"\nUsing a metal detector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe! Please let me use your metal detector.\nKay:\n.......... Gummy isn't here! Didn't you ask him to investigate something else for you!?\nEdgeworth:\nAck! (I'd completely forgotten...)\nSimon:\nUsing a metal detector on a truck, you sure say some funny things. The whole truck is made of metal. Of course you would get a reaction!\nEdgeworth:\nMmph! (I'll have to think of some other way...)\nSimon:\nIt's not like our brilliant prosecutor to spout out such nonsense. As I thought, there isn't any evidence at all, is there?\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! Is there really no evidence?\nEdgeworth:\n(If this truck is the same as the one I saw today...)\n\n\nKay:\nHuh? What's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Why are you touching the truck?\nEdgeworth:\nThe truck's body is cold to the touch. It seems to have been parked here for some time.\nKay:\nYou can figure all that out just by touching it!?\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Then there must have been something left in the truck!)\nLeads back to:\n\"What could prove that this is the truck I saw...?\"\nEdgeworth:\nI'd like to dust the truck for fingerprints.\nSimon:\nEh!? Fingerprints? What for? I don't see any point in that!\nEdgeworth:\nA certain person's fingerprints should be left on this truck. And these fingerprints will prove this truck was parked in front of the Grand Tower today! (Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?)\nMiles' fingerprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Edgeworth...? Your fingerprints?\"\nSimon's fingerprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimon:\nMy fingerprints? Wouldn't they be all over the truck anyways? After all, I'm the one who drives the truck! Finding my fingerprints on it doesn't prove a thing!\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (I guess he has a point...)\nKay:\nWe're looking for whoever left fingerprints on the truck in front of the tower, right? In that case, there's only one person it could be!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. It's obvious who must have touched it.\nLeads back to:\n\"(Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?)\"\nLotta's fingerprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nEh!? Yer sayin' they're MY fingerprints...!?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. We should be able to find your fingerprints on the truck. You touched the truck when it was in front of the tower, did you not?\nLotta:\nI hate to break it to ya, but... ...I... don't reckon I ever touched that truck at all.\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! (It seems I was mistaken...)\nKay:\nWe're looking for whoever left fingerprints on the truck in front of the tower, right? In that case, there's only one person it could be!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. It's obvious who must have touched it.\nLeads back to:\n\"(Whose fingerprints prove this truck was in front of the tower?)\"\nSimon:\nEdgeworth...? Your fingerprints?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. Earlier today, I touched a truck at the plaza in front of the Grand Tower. I'd like to dust for my prints. Ema, might I request a scientific investigation?\nEma:\nThat's what I'm here for! Just leave it to me! Alright, we're all set! Go ahead, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWait... You want me to do it?\nEma:\nOf course. Who else but Mr. Edgeworth would be up to the task? Here, I'll show you how it's done!\nEdgeworth:\nUmm... Alright, then. (You're the scientist, why don't you just do it yourself...?)\nEma:\nFirst, we sprinkle some aluminum powder over the area you want to investigate. Like this.\nEdgeworth:\n(Touch the screen to sprinkle the aluminum powder.)\nEma:\nThe powder will adhere to the fingerprints, so once you've sprinkled enough... ...you blow it away!\nEdgeworth:\nBlow it away?\nEma:\nYeah, just blow on it, with your breath. Fwooosh.\nEdgeworth:\n(Blow the powder away by blowing into the microphone.)\nEma:\nGot it?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I think so. (I guess we'll do it for real this time...)\nEma:\nJust so you know, the key point is to sprinkle the powder all over.\nObtain fingerprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"We got one! That's a nice, clean fingerprint!\"\nEma:\nWe got one! That's a nice, clean fingerprint!\nEdgeworth:\nLet's run the prints against mine posthaste.\nEma:\nAlright! Just leave it to me! These are definitely your fingerprints, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, it seems to me that we have just proven your statement to be a lie.\nSimon:\nUgh!\nLang:\nWhat were you doing when you were driving this truck around?\nSimon:\nJust... taking it for a joyride?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nKay was abducted two nights ago. Your balloon was sighted not far from the scene. Today, there was another kidnapping, in which a garbage truck was used... ...and once again, your truck was seen nearby.\nSimon:\nSimon:\nThis all sounds like nothing more than a pure coincidence to me...\nEdgeworth:\nSo it was pure coincidence that you parked near two separate kidnappings? I doubt that. You were involved in both kidnappings, weren't you?\nSimon:\nIsn't it a bit rash to automatically assume that the two kidnappings were connected?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what if I had evidence to prove that the two crimes were performed by the same culprit?\nSimon:\nOh! You're serious!? I can't wait to hear this!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat did Kay and John's kidnappings have in common?\nPresent Sleeping Drugs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Kay was knocked out with a powerful sleeping drug.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis piece of evidence shows that the same culprit was behind both kidnappings!\nSimon:\nOh? And just what part of that evidence shows that, exactly?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. I'd say... around here?\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! Try to sound a bit more confident, will ya!?\nSimon:\nGyahahaha! You don't actually have a clue what you're talking about, do you?\nEdgeworth:\n...Ugh! (He saw through me...)\nKay:\nIf the same culprit was behind both kidnapping cases, he must have used the same method... Let's look at the evidence related to the kidnappings again!\nEdgeworth:\nRight. Perhaps then all will become clear.\nSimon:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Edgeworth? Run out of evidence?\nEdgeworth:\nNo. I have evidence, and I can prove that the culprit in both kidnappings was the same!\nLeads back to:\n\"What did Kay and John's kidnappings have in common?\"\nEdgeworth:\nKay was knocked out with a powerful sleeping drug. And a bottle of sleeping drugs was found lying in the place where John was confined. The contents of the bottle were a match with the drugs used on Kay.\nSimon:\nSimon:\n......So that's all you've got, huh? And here I was, getting my hopes up. So the same sleeping drugs were used. So what? You think that connects the two incidents? Surely, you must realize it yourself? That doesn't prove a thing.\nEdgeworth:\nNgh...! (Th-There must be something... Evidence that proves he is connected to those cases...!)\nSimon:\nThe police, prosecutors, and even you, Mr. Edgeworth. In the end, you're all the same. You make up evidence as you see fit, just so you can send some poor soul to prison. Isn't there someone like that here? A poor soul who was wrongly accused in the past?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYou're wrong! Wh... Who would do such a thing!?\nSimon:\nSimon:\nThen show me the evidence! If you're going to accuse me of a crime, it's only natural!\nEdgeworth:\n(Ngh......... It's no use. I can't seem to find any other threads linking him to the kidnappings...!)\nSimon:\nNow then. Have you finally run out of ammo, Mr. Edgeworth? I still have preparations to make at the circus, so if you'll excuse me...\nRay:\nRay:\nNow, now, you two... No need to get so heated. And Simon... You're looking good in that clown makeup!\nSimon:\nH-Hey, what's your deal!? Don't just butt in like that...\nRay:\nUncle Ray's not so good in such a stiff environment. I mean, why so serious, right? Hey, Kay! How about a little trick?\nKay:\nAt last, my moment has arrived! The Great Kay Faraday presents... a Simon impression! \"O-Objectiooon...!\"\nSimon:\nWha... Wh-Why you! Enough already!\nRay:\n...Psst. Hey, Miles. I'm buying you some time to get all your ducks in a row. There's probably a better way to stall for time than this, but whatevs. Woo! Nice one, Kay!\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm not so sure about this method, either... ...but I have to find something that connects Simon to the case... And I need to find it now! Is there evidence not related to the kidnapping that's connected to the mastermind's identity? That's it...! The mastermind is the same person as the young acolyte Dogen was looking for. If I can just connect the young acolyte to Simon... Which piece of evidence could be connected with the mastermind's true identity...?)\nPresent Correspondence Chess Memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Knightley and Dogen both communicated through a certain individual...\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI've found it...! This is the evidence that connects you to the case!\nSimon:\nReally, now? That's interesting. Well then, show me how it's connected!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Leave it to me. If you hold it like this, and turn it this way...\nKay:\n\"Too baaad! Epic fall, Mr. Edgewooorth!\"\nEdgeworth:\nGwooooh! (Wh-Whose side are you on, anyways...? Something... I have to find something! It simply must exist! Evidence that shows the mastermind is connected to those involved in this case...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"(Which piece of evidence could be connected with the mastermind's true identity...?)\"\nEdgeworth:\nKnightley and Dogen both communicated through a certain individual...\nDogen:\nOh...? Then that somebody must be...\nEdgeworth:\n...the mastermind behind the case.\nEdgeworth:\n(That's it... The mastermind played a role in the correspondence chess... If I can prove that it was Simon, then...!)\nSimon:\nThat's enough. I can't stomach any more of your sorry excuse for a performance. If you have no more objections, then I ask that you let me get back to preparing for the show.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...Thank you for the help, Mr. Shields. (Though you may have taken it a little too far...)\nRay:\nYou sure look happy. I take it you've found something?\nKay:\n\"Look at me! I'm Zimon! Zimon ze Klown...! Ze funny, funny klown!\"\nEdgeworth:\nKay, you can stop now. Now then... Mr. Keyes. Do you happen to like chess?\nSimon:\nHmph. That was rather out-of-the-blue. But since you asked, I can't say that I dislike chess.\nEdgeworth:\nThe mastermind played correspondence chess with Sirhan Dogen.\nSimon:\nSimon:\nIf I recall, it was Knightley who had been playing chess with Dogen, wasn't it? Are you saying that he was the mastermind?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThere was no way Knightley could have been the mastermind. The reason being... ...the mastermind had continued to work behind the scenes even after Knightley's death. That being the case, who could have written this letter? I believe someone acted as the middleman between Dogen and Knightley.\nSimon:\nSo, you're saying that you think I'm the middleman? Ha ha ha! And just why would I have to go to all that trouble and do something like that?\nEdgeworth:\nMost likely, to make it appear as if there was a connection between Knightley and Dogen. And, as a result... Knightley was killed by Patricia Roland.\nKay:\nN-No way! Are you saying it was all set up so that he would be killed by her!?\nSimon:\nSimon:\nWhat are you saying!? There's no way I could manipulate a person that far! Look at me! It takes all I have just to get the animals to perform tricks!\nEdgeworth:\n(If only just a scrap of the letters he exchanged with Knightley still remained... ...it'd be decisive evidence!) I'd like to investigate your room. There could be decisive...\nSimon:\nSimon:\nIf it's the letters you're looking for, you won't find any in there.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nSimon:\nI'm the type of guy who throws his letters away as soon as he's done reading them. Where's the point in living in the past?\nEdgeworth:\n(Ngh! Does that mean he's already gotten rid of the evidence...!?)\nSimon:\nMr. Edgeworth... Everything you have said so far has been nothing more than baseless conjecture.\nEdgeworth:\n(The evidence... I'm just one step behind it! What should I do? Am I all out of moves...?)\nSimon:\nWithout evidence, I won't allow you to cast doubt on my friendship with Knightley!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-Who was that?\nRegina:\nAh! Excuse me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Ms. Berry? What's on her mind?)\nRegina:\nI've been... listening in on what you all were saying, and, umm... When you say Mr. Knightley... You mean Simon's friend, Mr. Knightley, right?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, that's correct... (Does she know something?)\nRegina:\nThis morning, a letter arrived from Mr. Knightley. It was for Simon.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nSimon:\nWhat did you say...!?\nEdgeworth:\n(But that's impossible! Knightley's already dead...!) Ms. Berry! Please, let me see that letter!\nRegina:\nOK! Here you go.\nKay:\nQuick, open it!\nEdgeworth:\nThis is... a correspondence chess letter!\nKay:\nThis is the response to Dogen's last move!\nKnightley:\nNow, can you see the path to checkmate? I can't wait to see the look on your face... You weren't expecting to lose at chess against me, right?\nEdgeworth:\nThe postmark says March 26th... The day before Knightley's death. It seems the letter arrived late.\nRegina:\nSince the circus moves around so much, a lot of the mail people send us arrive late.\nEdgeworth:\nNow, why was this letter addressed to you?\nSimon:\n.....Ngh!\nEdgeworth:\nThis is proof that you were the middleman between Dogen and Knightley. Normally, you would transcribe this letter into braille before sending it to Dogen. And in doing so, you created a connection between him and Knightley!\nSimon:\nDammiiiiiit! Curse you, Knightley! Why must you continue to interfere!?\nKay:\nSimon... Why!? Wasn't Knightley your only friend?\nSimon:\nHah! Don't be ridiculous. I stopped thinking of him as a friend 18 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\n18 years ago...? Would that have been the day of the IS-7 Incident?\nSimon:\n...Thanks to Knightley, I nearly died that day in the snowstorm. While I was on my way to the contest venue, where my father was waiting... ...Knightley suddenly appeared. He held me down... tied up my hands and feet, and with tears streaming down his face... ...he kept apologizing, \"My dad's too scary, I can't disobey him. Please forgive me! I'm sorry!\"\nSimon:\nStop it, Horace! I promised my dad! I said I'd taste his desserts... If I'm not there, Dad will be in trouble! I'm gonna let everyone know my Dad's desserts are the best in the world...!\nSimon:\nAfter that, he locked us inside a car. It was so cold, I could see my own breath. Before we knew it, the doors had frozen shut, and not even he could get them open. And then... I lost my father!\nEdgeworth:\nWha...!\nKay:\nYour father...!\nSimon:\nHorace Knightley was the son of the murderer who killed my father!\nEdgeworth:\n(What could this mean? His confession runs contrary to the information we have...)\nRay:\nBut the name of the victim in the IS-7 Incident was Isaac Dover...\nSimon:\nIsaac Dover is my father's name. 18 years ago, my memories were muddled from the shock of my near-death experience... So it wasn't until later that I learned the truth. On that day, my father was murdered.\nEdgeworth:\n...The culprit of the IS-7 Incident was a confectioner by the name of Dane Gustavia.\nSimon:\nHeh... So that was the name of Knightley's father. That lowlife scum of the earth killed my father. Just the thought of him makes me sick.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you knew who the culprit was all along?\nSimon:\nHah... Of course not. Had I known, I would've tipped off the police a long time ago. All I knew was that Knightley's father was trying to set up my own father. That's why I immediately knew that the one who died that day was my dad. Knightley had a hand in my father's murder, that traitor! He was the son of a killer! It's only natural that he ended up dead!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...It would appear that you are a victim of a very serious misunderstanding.\nSimon:\nMisunderstanding...? Just what're you talking about?\nEdgeworth:\nIsaac Dover... At the time, he was actively working as a sculptor in France... ...under the name Pierre Hoquet.\nSimon:\nIs that right? Well, I'm sorry to say, I don't remember that at all.\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... It's only natural you don't remember. After all, he's not your real father.\nSimon:\n...Huh? What, is that supposed to be a joke? I am not amused.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... You won't be able to laugh at all, once I reveal the truth to you. This piece of evidence proves that you are not Isaac Dover's son!\nPresent Knightley's Mementos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What's that? Isn't that Knightley's chessboard and his ring?\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nSimon:\nWhat's that supposed to tell me?\nEdgeworth:\nCan't you see? This shows that you and Dover aren't...\nSimon:\n\nSimon:\nMr. Edgeworth. That doesn't prove anything. I honestly don't have a clue what you're trying to get at.\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (It seems I was wrong...)\nRay:\nHang in there, Miles. Who was really Mr. Dover's son...? If you keep calm and think it through, the answer should come naturally.\nEdgeworth:\n(Isaac Dover's real son...?)\nSimon:\nMr. Edgeworth. Stop joking around. There's no doubt that I'm Isaac Dover's son.\nEdgeworth:\nNo. I'm sorry, Mr. Keyes, but that's just simply not possible.\nLeads back to:\n\"This piece of evidence proves that you are not Isaac Dover's son!\"\nSimon:\nWhat's that? Isn't that Knightley's chessboard and his ring?\nEdgeworth:\nI want you to take a good look at this ring's design.\nSimon:\n...There are two letters inscribed in it.\nEdgeworth:\nThat is the seal Pierre Hoquet used as his signature. 18 years ago, it was found lying near the body of Isaac Dover.\nSimon:\n! Wh... Why would Knightley have my father's memento with him!?\nEdgeworth:\nThe police had found Isaac Dover's son and gave it to him. Isaac Dover's real son... is Horace Knightley.\nSimon:\nWh... What!? B-But that means, I'm...!\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words... you are Dane Gustavia's son!\nSimon:\nThat's... that's a lie! After all, I'm... My... father is.....! My memories are.....! I lost my father because Knightley locked me up in the car...! That's why, I thought it would be fitting if he were killed as well!\nKnightley:\nReally!? I'll be able to see a circus show, even in prison? Heh. I enjoy playing chess with you, but I'm looking forward to your performance as well.\nSimon:\n......Yes. Please look forward to it.\nKnightley:\nAlright! You better drop by again. I'll be thinking about my next move!\nSimon:\nOh yeah. I've left something special inside that chessboard for you. You should check it out later.\nKnightley:\nSomething special? I'm not quite sure what you mean, but thanks. I owe you one, Simon.\nSimon:\n......If only you hadn't stopped me 18 years ago... ...it wouldn't have had... to come to this.\nKnightley:\nHuh? Did you say something?\nSimon:\nNope. Not a word. ......Goodbye, Horace.\nSimon:\nAfter all that...! You're saying it was my father who killed Knightley's? Then, that means... Was it all for nothing...!? I didn't want to become some weakling who could be killed by anyone... That's why... I thought I'd follow in Mr. Dogen's footsteps!\nEdgeworth:\nThis finally proves it... Simon Keyes! You are Dogen's correspondence chess partner... ...and the mastermind behind this case!\nSimon:\n............ GYAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That's right! It was me! I'm the mastermind behind it all!\nEdgeworth:\n(He's finally showing his true colors...!)\nSimon:\nAs you all know, I witnessed the incident 12 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\n(President Huang's assassination...! So the child who drew that picture was Simon Keyes...)\nSimon:\nWhen I was found out... ...I was subjected to horrible interrogations over and over by that heartless Patricia. I'd spend the nights trembling in my bed, terrified of what the next day would bring! I'm sure you can understand why I'd want to sneak out of there, right?\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... Blaise would have likely sent pursuers after you.\nSimon:\nExactly. I was on the run from them every waking moment. 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I couldn't even sleep at night, I'd jump at the slightest noise. ...And that's why I became a circus performer. Blaise Debeste was the Chief Prosecutor, and Patricia Roland was the warden of the prison. No ordinary person would be a match for those two. And there were no adults I could rely on. Furthermore, behind the scenes was the body double who had set those two in motion. Though he was a fake, I was up against a nation's president... Talk about utter despair, right? My only ally was Mr. Dogen... He saved my life, after all. He actually helped me out. Unlike Knightley.\nEdgeworth:\n(If this story is true... Hmph. It's ironic. Dogen, the fiendish assassin, was idolized by the child he saved.)\nSimon:\nIf I followed in his footsteps, I'd no longer have to worry about being eaten alive. That's right. Now it's my turn... My turn to devour those who would feed upon me!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I suppose you never thought to seek help from the police.\nSimon:\nNowaynoway! As long as Blaise was around, any evidence would be destroyed by him. Actually, didn't something like that almost happen today during Patricia's trial? I knew from the very beginning. That things would turn out like this.\nEdgeworth:\n(The evidence from Patricia Roland's trial... So he's saying that he expected the evidence would be destroyed...) I see. So that's why you kidnapped John... ...to force a Guilty verdict, even in the absense of evidence!\nSimon:\nSimon:\nWho's to say. But, in order to expose the crimes of 12 years ago, there was no other choice.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's according to you. However, Blaise also... ...attempted to kidnap John in order to manipulate the trial in his favor... Your methods are no different than those of the people you so despise!\nSimon:\nSimon:\nThat's only if I were actually the kidnapper. But I would never do anything so evil. Nowaynowaynoway, I just simply couldn't! Besides, Mr. Edgeworth. I'm actually quite thankful to the real criminals... ...for giving me the opportunity to extract such sweet revenge! Ke he heh... Gyahahahahahaha!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...So you admit it. Your motive was revenge.\nSimon:\nYeah, I admit it. So what? Sure, I held a grudge against those creeps. But... it's not like I'm the one who actually killed them, ya know?\nEdgeworth:\n.....!\nSimon:\nTruth be told, all I did was send some letters. I let Jill in on Blaise's secrets, and let Blaise in on Jill's secrets. And then, the two simply ended up trying to kill each other.\nCourtney:\nDo you mean to say the murder was nothing more than a result of that!?\nSimon:\nYep! Just like the case at Gourd Lake. It's way easier than trying to control wild animals. All I did was come up with the fake assassination plan for Knightley.\nEdgeworth:\n(So that was also a part of his plan...!) If that's the case, then Rooke's murder was also your...\nSimon:\nSimon:\nWhoa! Don't try to pin that on me. Knightley killed him all on his own. Well, it ended up creating the perfect opportunity for me... It's funny how things work out!\nKay:\nHow can you say such a thing...!?\nSimon:\nIt was the same for Patricia Roland. I made it look like there was a connection between Knightley and Dogen... ...by using the correspondence chess match and the chisel in the chessboard.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!? You mean to say that you were the one who prepared that chisel!?\nSimon:\nThat's right! I thought it would bring Dogen to mind. Quite a thoughtful little gift, wouldn't you agree? And that was all it took to get Patricia to murder Knightley! Oh, the feeling that everyone around you is an enemy. Heh heh. I know it all too well. The tiniest spark can set off an explosion of fear, resulting in... horrific mutual destruction. All I did was watch the comedy of errors unfold from the audience. And you were my final pawn, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nA pawn... Me...?\nSimon:\nWhen you solved their cases, you brought both Blaise and Patricia to their run... ...and the weapon that delivered the coup de grâce was your own logic!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI didn't solve those cases for your sake!\nSimon:\nOh, I know. You never really cared about saving me. You just wanted to pretend to be a defense attorney, didn't you?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat did you...!?\nSimon:\nAll I had to do was go, \"nowaynowaynoway\" and act all scared... ...and you totally believed me. You were giving it your all trying to save me.\nEdgeworth:\nNgh...! So even your arrest was just a ploy to make me use my logic...?\nSimon:\nTo be fair, getting arrested wasn't part of the plan. When people began to suspect that the chisel I sent was the murder weapon... ...honestly, I broke out in a cold sweat. I thought for sure it would be curtains for me. But then, a turnabout of miraculous proportions! The genius prosecutor himself had come to my rescue! Well? Doesn't it feel nice to be thanked by me, the one that you saved? You should be grateful! I gave you this chance to play the ace attorney!\nKay:\nYou're wrong! He wasn't pretending to be a defense attorney! Mr. Edgeworth is always serious about saving people...! Even the times when he saved me in the past...!\nEdgeworth:\n(Kay...!)\nSimon:\nGyahahahahahaha! Is that so? Are you sure he's not just trying to emulate his own father, the one he admires SO much!?\nKay:\nAbsolutely not! That's not true at all!\nRay:\nNow, now, Kay. The person he's talking about now isn't Miles, but rather, Simon himself. Clearly, he is not able to trust others. The desire to save someone other than himself is something he cannot even comprehend...\nSimon:\nSay what you want. But make sure you think about it long and hard. Sure, all my targets for revenge got what they deserved in the end. However...\n-- Instigating Murder? --\nSimon:\nThink about it. Can any one of my actions really be considered a crime?\nI instigated murder? There's not a single word about that in the letter, is there?\nIf I had said the word \"kill\" even once, I guess it could be considered instigation.\nWell, maybe I did say it. But there's no way for you to prove it.\nKay:\nWhat are you saying!? You kidnapped me!\nSimon:\nI'm sorry, but that hasn't been proven yet, has it? The only thing I admitted to was sending the letters.\nKay:\nThat's...!\nSimon:\nBesides, those letters contained no threats or coercions. I simply conveyed information. Information that each recipient would find beneficial.\nEdgeworth:\nNgh... (You crafty little...!)\nKay:\nCan't we do something about it? Umm... what was it he said? Integrating murder?\nEdgeworth:\nInstigating murder is when a person directs someone else to commit murder. The person who directed the murder can be charged as if he committed the crime himself.\nKay:\nSo we just have to find proof that he directed those murders!\nSimon:\nYou make it sound so easy... To be honest, it kinda pisses me off a little. You're all trying to frame an innocent person for murder. Don't you understand? I'm not obligated to waste any more time on this pointless discussion.\nLang:\nLang:\nThe police are waiting for you outside of this tent! You have nowhere to run!\nSimon:\nReally now? You think I wouldn't have an escape route prepared? For example, let's say... ...I gave an order so that all the animals here attacked you! Now, what if I were to take my leave during the ensuing chaos?\nLang:\nWhat'd you say!? You... can't be serious...\nSimon:\nGyahahahaha! It was just an example! Wouldn't that make for an interesting show? Here's another idea: what if I pulled out a hidden gun and took John hostage? Mmm. That might be more exciting!\nCourtney:\nI-I will never allow you to do such a thing!\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't tell whether or not Simon is being serious... ...however, when it comes to him, we should consider anything a possibility!)\nSimon:\nIf you continue to bore with your drivel, I'll end the show right here. I'd like you to keep that in mind before you make any baseless objections!\nEdgeworth:\n(Ngh...! I cannot make any careless remarks...! Isn't there some way I can charge him with his crimes?)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You incited others to commit murder, and they did so. If proof of that was established, you would be charged as if you yourself committed the murders. Kay: ...Umm, I know I heard it just a while ago, but what's the technical term again? Edgeworth: It's \"instigating murder\", Kay. Blaise, Patricia Roland, and Knightley... Their crimes are unforgivable, of course. However, the one who pulled the strings from behind the scenes, and drove them all to murder... ...was none other than you, Simon Keyes! Simon: Aha, aha, gyahahahahah! Mr. Edgeworth, you really do speak your mind freely. But you know...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: There's not... a single word? Simon: Oh, does that surprise you? You'd reach the same conclusion if you examined it. Edgeworth: (Hmm. Given his composure... I'd say he's not bluffing. Does this mean that every single word in his letters had been carefully calculated...!?) Simon: Well, I guess you could say this is like teaching a monkey to climb a tree. Unless you can somehow prove that I caused those murders, you've got nothing on me. ...Ergo, you can't assume me of instigating murder. Heh heh heh... What a shame, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I know you instigated the murder! ???: Hmm. Perhaps I should let you in on this, Mr. Edgeworth... Actually, I was the one who ordered Blaise Debeste to kill Jill Crane. Edgeworth: What!? Edgeworth: You told me yourself. Simon: Simon: But you know, the funny thing is, it means absolutely nothing if you have no proof. I mean, there's no way I'd ever say something like that. Nowaynowaynoway! Edgeworth: (Ngh... that's certainly true. It means absolutely nothing if I can't prove it. If there was some evidence that could prove what he said over the phone...)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Maybe you did say it\"? Did you or didn't you!? Simon: Gyahahahah! It doesn't really matter whether I did or didn't! That's not what's important. I'm sure you know full well, Mr. Edgeworth. There's no way to prove it. There's no way any proof could exist! Edgeworth: Ngh...! (Until I find some sort of proof, my arguments are meaningless. Should I press him to draw out more information, or review the evidence...? At any rate, I must find some way to break through his defense!)\nKay: Is Simon really innocent of instigating the murders? Edgeworth: That's impossible. I'm certain that it was all part of his murder plot. Kay: Yeah. Edgeworth: We know he had the will to commit the crimes... We just need some way to prove it...\nEdgeworth: (He confessed to me over the phone. He told me he had Blaise kill Mrs. Crane... If only there was some evidence that could prove what he said over the phone...",

If any sound was recorded at the time she was with the culprit...) Ms. Swift! How long have you been recording?\nNicole:\nSince two nights ago, I reckon...\nEdgeworth:\n(Since two nights ago...

Think about it a little harder!\nEdgeworth:\n...I-I'm sorry.\nKay:\nThe person who fired the gun could be the same person who kidnapped me, right?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's possible. However... It seems we can't be sure. To see if there is something that connects those involved in the case with a gun... ...we should review the evidence once more.\nSimon:\nWhat are you mumbling about? As I thought, the gun isn't related at all, is it?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, the gunshot that was recorded is greatly related to this case.\nLeads back to:\n\"Which piece of evidence connects the gunshot to the case?\"\nEdgeworth:\nIt's written right here, in the body double's autopsy report... Gunpowder residue was detected on his right hand.\nSimon:\n...Ngh.\nEdgeworth:\nWhere was Kay at the time this gunshot was recorded? That's right. She was being carried to the roof of the Grand Tower in your balloon. And as it turns out, there were a few more people on that very same rooftop at the time...\nCourtney:\nYou mean the double and me... Ah! Certainly, after we talked for a brief moment... ...the body double noticed something and had me leave before him.\nEdgeworth:\nNow, what if the gunshot rang out after that? We clearly hear it in the recording. I doubt that you wouldn't have noticed it.\nSimon:\n.......\nEdgeworth:\nDo you intend to feign ignorance until the very end?\nSimon:\nThat's nothing more than mere conjecture.\nLang:\nLang:\nWhat we heard on the recording was not just a gunshot...\n.....*BANG*... *CLANG*\nLang:\nIf you listen closely, you can hear the bullet hitting something!\nEdgeworth:\n(If the body double was aiming at Simon, then...)

I don't think that's the right evidence either.\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhooh! (To be rebutted this much...)\nLang:\nMr. Prosecutor. Do you really understand? If you think about who the double was aiming at, the answer should be clear.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. The bullet could only have hit that piece of evidence.\nLeads back to:\n\"The bullet may have struck which piece of evidence?\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe body double likely fired the gun at the balloon. If we assume that the bullet hit something... it would have been the balloon's basket.\nKay:\nLet's examine it immediately!\nExamine basket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis basket needs to be examined from every angle.

Did you guys find anything on your end?\nMIB:\nNothing at all! Not a even single speck of dust!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm. I expected as much. The sound made on impact... ...sounded more metallic than anything the basket's woven material could produce...)\nExamine rope on inside\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThere's a long rope all coiled up inside.\nEdgeworth:\nWe must examine it closely for any signs of it being cut by a bullet.\nKay:\nGot it! Mr. MIB, you start from that end!\nMIB:\nY-Yeah! Nothing here... or here... Nope! There's no sign of it being hit by a bullet!\nKay:\nThere's nothing on this end either. I guess it didn't hit the rope.\nEdgeworth:\nLet's not waste any time. On to the next spot.\nExamine gas tank on inside\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's a gas tank here. It's attached to the basket.\nKay:\nUmm... I don't think we would be looking at this tank right now if a bullet had hit it. In fact, neither Simon or I would still be here. We would have been blown sky high.\nEdgeworth:\nLet's look elsewhere, then.\nExamine bullet hole on under\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This hole...!\"\nEdgeworth:\nThis hole...!\nKay:\nIt's a bullet hole!\nEdgeworth:\nA bullet hole was found in the basket. You won't be able to talk your way out of this one.\nLion Balloon data updated in my Organizer.\nSimon:\nNgh!\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasket on Lion Balloon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nI... took a ride in this basket, didn't I?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. You had been drugged, so it would make sense if you don't remember it.\nKay:\nAww... He could have at least kept me awake so I could enjoy the hot air balloon ride. I'll never forgive you, Mr. Mastermind! Beat him to a pulp, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry to disappoint, Kay, but if I did that I would be arrested for battery...\n\n\n\n\nRope on inside of Lion Balloon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nOnce we've proven he's the culprit, let's tie him up with this rope! As an expert in rope escapes, I know how to make knots that can never be untied!\nEdgeworth:\nI appreciate the enthusiasm, but handcuffs seem like a more reliable alternative.\n\n\n\n\nGas tank on inside of Lion Balloon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nNever fear! I'll guard the gas tank! I'll stop Simon from trying to escape with the balloon!\nEdgeworth:\nI... find it hard to imagine that he would try a stunt like that.\nKay:\nNever fear! Just focus on putting him behind bars, Mr. Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\nBullet hole on under Lion Balloon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe gunshot fired by the body double was recorded on the tape. And this was where the bullet hit its mark. There's no way Simon can deny that now!\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth, you absolutely HAVE to expose the truth! I even got kidnapped in order to steal this evidence!\nEdgeworth:\n(Leaving aside whether or not I would call that \"stealing\"...) Of course, that was my intention all along. I absolutely won't let him escape!\nEdgeworth:\nHow do you intend to explain the gunshot and bullet hole?\nSimon:\nKeh heh heh. So you've figured it out. You're good. I guess it's impossible to hide anything from you.\nLang:\nSpit it out already!\nSimon:\nOK, OK. No need to be impatient!\n-- Two Nights Ago --\nSimon:\nIt happened when I was riding the balloon to the rooftop.\nI saw the body double and you, Ms. Courtney, on the roof. Talk about a surprise.\nOnly the double noticed me. He told Ms. Courtney to leave ahead of him.\nHe then pointed a gun at me and fired.\nKay:\nWhy did he want to shoot down the balloon?\nSimon:\nIt's simple. The body double had intended to kill Ms. Courtney.\nCourtney:\nK-Kill me...?\nSimon:\nThat's right! You talked to the double about John, didn't you? Well, it's not like the body double would have met with you otherwise... From his point of view, it was like showing him evidence that he was a fake.\nEdgeworth:\nYou mean, he was afraid of Judge Courtney because she knew about John's past?\nSimon:\nAfraid... That's exactly right! That body double was a coward, after all. I even remember how his hands were trembling when he fired the gun at my balloon. Are we all clear now? I was only there by chance. Just a friendly witness who was passing by.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Around what time was that? Simon: I think it was around 11 PM. It should coincidence with the time Ms. Courtney and company were on the roof, right? Courtney: ...Yes. It was indeed around that time. Edgeworth: (There doesn't seem to be any contradictions... However, the time frame is important.) Simon: And it was at that moment...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you saying this rooftop rendezvous was beyond your expectations? Simon: There's no way I could've known about that beforehand. Well, once the dust settled, I could guess what would've happened though. The double had intended to kill Ms. Courtney. Hey, did you realize that? Courtney: N-No. I did not... realize it. Simon: It's because you were blabbing on and on about that kid. Courtney: Th-That's...... I... Uugh...! Simon: What kinda mother are you? If things had gone badly, your kid might've died because of you! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm your opponent, not her. Don't change the conversation! ...Judge Courtney. I'd like you to please leave this to me. Courtney: My apologies, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Oh, Goddess of Law... ...please watch over this man and grant him aid! Simon: Hahaha! You're making me laugh. This lady didn't even notice the balloon.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: He had her leave ahead of him? Didn't you say the body double had planned to kill her? Simon: Maybe he thought it would be bad if someone saw the scene of the murder? At the time, no one knew that the president was a fake, right? Once he got the info on John, he'd be able to kill both mother and son whenever he wanted. Thank goodness he's dead! Now you're both safe. You should be happy. Gyaha... hahahahahahah! Edgeworth: Whatever emotions you have towards that man, please put them aside until it's all over. For now, please continue your story. Simon: Keh heh heh... As you wish. And so, that cowardly body double... ...must have panicked when an eyewitness suddenly appeared from the skies.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: The bullet struck the balloon's basket cleanly... Simon: I panicked and quickly tried to get away so he wouldn't shoot me down, but... ...talk about a close call. Edgeworth: You say you tried to get away right then? Simon: That's right. Is there a problem? Edgeworth: (Is there a problem with his statement?) There is a problem Leads to: \"You must have placed Kay on the rooftop.\" There is no problem Edgeworth: No... there is no problem. Simon: I see. In that case, it's fine. Edgeworth: You must have placed Kay on the rooftop. You couldn't have gotten away before then, correct? Simon: ...Yeah. That's right. I forgot. After the body double fired one shot, he entered the hatch to the 51st floor. I looked around for a bit, and then landed on the roof. Edgeworth: Please add that statement to your testimony. Simon: Sure, I don't mind... Add statement: \"After the double fired one shot, he entered the hatch to the 51st floor.\" Leads to: \"You must have placed Kay on the rooftop.\" Edgeworth: No... there is no problem. Simon: I see. In that case, it's fine.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Surely, you must have been surprised. So what did you do? Simon: What else could I do in that situation? I tried to get away as quickly as I could. But, that body double... He's nothing but a coward hiding behind a steel gun. Kay: ...Inside his plane at Gourd Lake, he had tons of personal security goods as well. Edgeworth: It is said that when a coward is backed into a corner, they can become aggressive. Simon: Oh. If that's the case, are you going to get more aggressive now, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Sorry to disappoint, but I try not to become aggressive or defensive. Instead... I attack when I need to be forceful, and defend when a delicate touch is needed. Back to the matter at hand, could you testify about the body double's actions? Simon: Hmph... don't be so cold, man.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean the hatch that leads to the hidden storeroom for the black market auction? Kay: Black market auction... Huh? I don't really want to remember, but... that was 2 days ago, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. The black market auction was held on the 50th floor of the Grand Tower. Kay: A lot of people must have been coming and going through the storeroom during the incident... Edgeworth: Indeed. If the double truly did enter the storeroom as Simon said... ...it's strange that no one noticed him! (The problem here is when this incident occurred... If we know the precise moment, then a certain piece of evidence may come in handy.)\nEdgeworth: (Eyewitness testimony from the balloon...)\nKay: So that means, if Simon hadn't come...\nEdgeworth: ...Judge Courtney would probably have been in danger.\nKay: So, wouldn't that mean he saved her life!?\nEdgeworth: The motive behind Mr. Keyes' actions was probably not so noble. After all, this man was there to commit a crime just like the fake president. (To expose his crimes, I'll need to listen carefully to his testimony... There must be an opening somewhere!)",

How can you trust that sham journalist's testimony?\nLotta:\nWhat'd ya say!?\nNicole:\nYou can't insult my Mentor like that!\nLang:\nTwo nights ago, that lady was staking out the 51st floor. Given that, just how did that body double leave the roof?\nEdgeworth:\n...Indeed. That is what we must now prove. (If he did not use the elevator or the 51st floor to leave the roof... ...then only one route remains!) How did the body double leave the roof without using the elevator or the 51st floor?\nPresent Lion Balloon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The body double... flew.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe body double used this to leave the roof!\nSimon:\n........\nKay:\n........\nLang:\n........\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. It seems no one can overturn my argument.\nSimon:\nYeah. Because your logic is so stupid, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nMmghhoooh! (So it wasn't this...?)\nKay:\nIf he didn't use the elevator or the secret passage... ...then, he must have scaled the walls!\nEdgeworth:\nI think only you and a ninja would think of using that kind of escape route.\nKay:\nThen, maybe he flew! Zooooom! To the moon!\nEdgeworth:\n(He flew...?)\nLang:\nMr. Prosecutor. Just how the heck did that body double get off the roof?\nLeads back to:\n\"How did the body double leave the roof without using the elevator or the 51st floor?\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe body double... flew.\nLang:\nHe...?\nKay:\n...flew?\nEdgeworth:\nSimon Keyes. He rode in your balloon!\nSimon:\nSimon:\nHey, hey! Stop joking around! Why would I have needed to give the body double a lift?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThe elevator had a security camera. And the 51st floor was being watched by Ms. Hart. Your balloon was the only way the body double could have left the roof!\nSimon:\nSimon:\n......Heh heh heh heh. ...At the circus, we often perform dangerous stunts, in order to surprise the audience. You think you've got me cornered? Sorry, but... the show ends here.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...?\nSimon:\nHey, you. Lotta, was it? I'd like to ask you something... Are you saying you stood watch on the 51st floor the entire time, without any breaks?\nLotta:\nW-Well, reckon course! There ain't no mistake in my testimony...\nSimon:\nSimon:\nReally now? But didn't the sound of Mr. Edgeworth's assistant falling into the storeroom... ...cause you to faint?\nLotta:\nI didn't mention it before, but after that I might've dozed off a while. To be more precise... I fainted? Well, somethin' like that.\nEdgeworth:\nS-So something did happen!\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Hart, I have determined the sound that made you faint. It was likely the sound of Kay falling onto the storeroom floor.\nLotta:\nWh-What's yer point!? Nobody's perfect!\nSimon:\nHeh heh heh. Look at her, Mr. Edgeworth. That's the kind of person you're relying on.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nKay fell into the storeroom after the body double had left the roof!\nSimon:\nSimon:\nIn that case... heh heh heh. I have a theory on how things happened. After that cowardly double fired a shot at me... ...he went and hid in the shadows until Kay fell into the storeroom!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!\nKay:\nS-So what if he was hiding!?\nSimon:\nSimon:\n\"Good grief, you guys still haven't noticed?\" What if the body double stayed hidden until Lotta had fainted... ...and then he went down to the 51st floor?\nEdgeworth:\nTh... That can't be...!\nSimon:\n\"Heh... Precisely. The locked room mystery on the roof has been unlocked!\"\nEdgeworth:\nGah... GWOOOOOOOH! (He even said it in my voice!)\nSimon:\nGyaha, Gyaha! Gyahahahah! But wait, there's more... I told the hidden body double about John Marsh. That's why he attacked John the next day during practice, but got himself killed instead. In other words, the one who murdered the body double was none other than John!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nJohn had no motive to kill the body double!\nSimon:\nSimon:\n...He knew. He knew he was the real president's son.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. And how would he have known that?\nSimon:\nBecause I told him so. ...In a letter.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What did you say!?\nCourtney:\nThat is a lie!\nSimon:\nYup! It's all a lie!\nKay:\nHuh?\nSimon:\n...But then again, maybe not. Maybe I really did tell him? ...Right, John?\nJohn:\nIt's true that I caused Moozilla's head to fall... ...but... I didn't know about my dad until today!\nSimon:\nOh really... I wonder about that. I found out about the head falling thanks to the bug... Now, if you were the one who caused it to fall... and the body double was crushed to death...\nJohn:\nNgh...\nSimon:\nThat settles it. You're the culprit. You successfully carried out your revenge. Congratulations! All the pieces of the puzzle are now in place. As Mr. Edgeworth would say... \"...the logic fits. Now then... any rebuttals?\"\n-- The Murder of the Double --\nSimon:\nManipulating humans into fighting with each other. Sounds just like me, right?\nI did the same thing to Knightley and Blaise.\nAt any rate, there's no way the body double could've gone for a ride in my balloon.\nThe double was crushed by the monster's head, right?\nAnd who was it that caused the monster's head to fall?\nSimon:\nDo you understand now? Who the body double's real killer is? The \"truth\" that I provided them with gave them a big motive for murder. Get it? Those two tried to kill each other because of the \"truth\" you're so fond of!\nEdgeworth:\n(I... Impossible...!)\nSimon:\nHey! You detectives over there! Hurry up and arrest this murderer! What's wrong? Why aren't you moving?\nLang:\nD........ Damn!\nSimon:\n......Heh heh heh. I thought so. Just admit it. In the end, aren't you all the same as Blaise and the body double? You ignore the prime suspect and come after me without any evidence! How easily it can be distorted to best suit your needs, this \"law\" you all believe in!\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nThat... is by no means true!\nSimon:\nSimon:\nHmph! If you're not gonna arrest anyone, maybe I should have a talk with the policemen outside. If I tell them that John Marsh is the killer, they'll be forced to take action!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nSimon Keyes. Your testimony isn't over yet!\nSimon:\nHeh heh... Really? I figured you'd try to stop me, Mr. Edgeworth. You don't have any evidence, do you? Which means... there's no chance for you to win, right? But if you still plan to stop me, you should be prepared to take on this much risk!\nEdgeworth:\nWha...! (Th-That much!?)\nSimon:\nIt's only natural. After all, the fate of the true culprit, John Marsh, is at stake here.\nRay:\n.....Hey, Miles? Why don'tcha take a nice deep breath?\nEdgeworth:\nM-Mr. Shields?\nRay:\nAt times like this, you should take a breather and think back. \"Defense attorneys always remain calm in a pinch, and smile in the face of danger.\" The point of contention between your logic and his claims lies in the body double's escape route. How's about... for example, we think of it like this... What's important isn't whether or not the body double got on the balloon, but rather... ...if we were to assume he did, \"what circumstances would have allowed for that?\"\nEdgeworth:\n(...\"Turn my thinking around!\")\nRay:\n...Well, all I'm doing is a cheap imitation of your old man. Did it help?\nEdgeworth:\n(Circumstances that would have allowed the body double to get on the balloon...? That's right. The body double not only had a large build,  but he also had a gun. And in spite of that, no traces of sleeping drugs were found in his system... Which means..... it can't be!)\nSimon:\nMr. Edgeworth, are you ready yet? Hope you haven't forgotten about \"this\".\nEdgeworth:\n(Ngh... this is bad. I must break his testimony somehow...!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you manipulated the body double and John to your will... You seem rather persistent about that, aren't you? Simon: Very much so. I'm an animal tamer, after all. And isn't the greatest animal in the world... man? I just tell people the truth, in order to help them get revenge. They should all be thanking me! Gyaha... Gyahahaha! Kay: M-Mr. Edgeworth. I'm kinda scared... Edgeworth: Steel yourself, Kay. One who sows seeds of revenge as a jest... This is an opponent we must stop at all costs! Simon: Keh heh heh... The sins of the past are scary. So, so scary. You'll never see your retribution coming.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you still intend to insist that you were not directly involved, to the very end? Simon: Right! I never dirtied my own hands. I just like to watch... ...as they hate and kill each other, never realizing that they were being manipulated all along! Lang: Tch! Spectating from afar... Just like you did 12 years ago! Simon: You mean the SS-5 Incident? Hahahaha! That's so funny. If I remember correctly, all your father's hard work amounted to nothing. Wouldn't you normally call someone like that... incompetent? Haha! Lang: Grrr......! GROOOOOOOOOOOWL! Y-You.....! Edgeworth: Agent Lang! Restrain yourself! Lang: Damn! Damn! Daaamn iiiiiit! Edgeworth: We don't know the conclusion your father arrived at. However, we are here now because we chased after his footsteps...! Simon: Keh heh heh... Gyahahaha! Sorry to interrupt your little moment... ...but I don't believe that kind of idealism will solve anything. Besides...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: That's the only way the double could have gotten off the tower! Simon: Hmm. Well, let's suppose that was the case. Even if I had carried the body double down... ...what's the problem with that? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you admit it! You did carry the body double! Simon: Simon: Let's not make a fuss over absurd opinions, Mr. Edgeworth. That's just not like you. You think the body double held me at gunpoint and asked me to go on a sightseeing joyride? There's no way that could've happened... And you know that full well, don't you? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: It's possible you negotiated with him by using the information about John as a bribe! Simon: Simon: But he shot at me, remember? There's just nowanowaynoway we could negotiate! Kay: In that case... what if you used sleeping drugs and transported him while he was knocked out? Simon: Simon: \"Then allow me to ask. Have they detected any traces of sleeping drugs from his body?\" Edgeworth: (Ugh... I-It's no good. I can't find any openings...!) Simon: Mr. Edgeworth. Isn't there something more interesting we should be talking about?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Allow me to propose a question. Was the double really crushed beneath the monster's head...? Simon: Simon: Haha! For a genius prosecutor, you sure are quick to withdraw your previous statements! Weren't you the one who deduced that he was crushed by the monster's head to begin with? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Indeed. I certainly came to that conclusion once before. However, that was... ...when we knew of nothing else that was capable to crushing him to death. Simon: Simon: \"Knew\"? Why the past tense? It's not like there's anything else now, y'know. The body double was crushed to death by the monster's head. That is an unshakable fact. Edgeworth: (...Ngh! Is there... nothing else!? Some decisive evidence... that connects this man to the \"crushed president\"!) Simon: How unsighty, Mr. Edgeworth. Why don't you stop this useless struggle? Besides, don't you already know who the culprit is? Remember?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Certainly, the one who caused the monster's head to fall was John, however... Kay: Even John himself admits to that... Simon: Well then, doesn't that settle everything? Good job guys, case closed! The one who killed the double was John Marsh! And since the police just happen to be here... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ...N-No. Not yet! There's still room for further investigation! Simon: Hahaha! Don't force yourself. Well then, tell me. What else is there to investigate? And if you can't, I want that kid arrested as soon as possible. You aren't going to overlook a crime, are you? Am I wrong? Kay: M-Mr. Edgeworth... What'll we do? Is there really no hope left? Edgeworth: (...Think. Think! If Mr. Keyes killed the double... ...then the murder could only have occurred when the two met face-to-face. What he had with him at the time must be... the real murder weapon!)\nKay: Darn it! Does he intend to play innocent until the very end!?\nEdgeworth: The body double's cause of death was rather unique. If he was crushed under the monster's head...\nKay: ...then, the killer would be John after all. Isn't there anything else that could've crushed the trouble?\nEdgeworth: (Something else that could have crushed the body double...?)",

I guess this is it!Phoenix:\nYeah. One way or another, this case gets decided today.Maya:\nAaa! Ph-Phoenix! Look!Phoenix:\n(...! Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)Edgeworth:\nI received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.Phoenix:\n?Edgeworth:\nHe told me that whatever Mr. White says today, it will be the \"absolute truth.\" No matter how you try to attack his testimony... If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.Phoenix:\n(What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?) So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?Edgeworth:\n... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.Maya:\nWhy... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?Edgeworth:\n\"Innocent\"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared \"guilty\"! So I make that my policy.Phoenix:\nEdgeworth... You've changed.Maya:\nHmm? Phoenix! You know him!?Edgeworth:\nDon't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.Maya:\nPh-Phoenix...?Phoenix:\nWell... court will be starting soon. (Changed from [Well... court will be opening for session soon.] in the original release)Maya:\nWhat? But wait! Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! They're not... (Changed from [Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! He's not...] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI'll be defending myself.Maya:\nWhaaaat!?Phoenix:\nOkay, let's do this.September 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nMr. Wright... Are you sure you're up to doing this?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.Judge:\nUnderstood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nAs the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of a witness to the defendant's crime. (Changed from [today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.] in the original release)Judge:\nI see. The prosecution may call its witness.Phoenix:\n(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)Objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court.\nJudge:\nExcellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Great. He gets to show off and I get nowhere.)\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!\"Let it go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Forget it. I smell a trap.)\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!\"Edgeworth:\nI would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!Edgeworth:\nPlease state your full name.White:\nYou wish to know the title of my personage?Edgeworth:\nEr... your name?White:\nYes! That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?Edgeworth:\nName!Phoenix:\n(These two are great together...)White:\nMy name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp.Edgeworth:\nDid you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?White:\nThat would be a negatory! No, I did not.Edgeworth:\n... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?White:\nCorrect.Edgeworth:\nAnd you witnessed the murder from there?White:\nAhem. Why tell you what you already know?Judge:\nVery well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)White:\nHo hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:\n...!Maya:\nLet him have it, Phoenix!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --White:\nLet's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.\nI was quietly perusifying... er, that's \"reading\" to you, some papers by the window.\nThen I heard a bedlam coming from outside!\nSurprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.\nIt was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!\nNeedless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!\nI called Miss May over at once. She, too, was flabbergasted of course.\nThe victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!\nFinally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Judge:\nHmm...

Miss May clearly stated that the assailant looked like a \"girl\"!\nWhite:\nI've always been proud of my eyesight, Mr. Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nJust what is your eyesight?\nWhite:\nCounting both eyes... 40!\nPhoenix:\n40!? Don't add them together!\nJudge:\nI think the witness is trying to say his eyesight is good.\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what did you do then?White:\nI called Miss May over at once. She, too, was surprised of course.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Miss May doing at that time?\nWhite:\nShe had just finished watching a soap opera on the TV, and was weeping openly.\nPhoenix:\nDid you know she had been tapping the Fey office phone?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIrrelevant! That has nothing to do with the case at hand.\nWhite:\nI care not. I will answer the lawyer's bold inquiry. Miss May was acting alone when she tapped the phone of this Fey woman.\nPhoenix:\nYou'd make a good politician, Mr. White.\nWhite:\nHo hoh! After all, I am \"El Presidente.\"\nJudge:\nPlease continue.White:\nThe victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan you be a little more detailed about that? I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened.\nWhite:\nOf course! Comprende! I understand! The victim was attacked, by you, and ran to the left. You gave chase, and struck her down!\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure?\nWhite:\nAs you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect!\nJudge:\nPerhaps you could change your testimony to reflect this new detail.\nChanges statement from \"The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!\" to \"The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!\"White:\nThe victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nWhite:\nHow many times must I say it?

Then it was all over...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... \"impaction\"? Don't you mean just \"impact\"?\nWhite:\nRidiculosity! I think you need to brush up on your language skills!\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, perhaps I'd better leave the whole language thing alone...)Phoenix:\n(Did Edgeworth \"prep\" this guy, too, I wonder? Anyway, I'd better find a weakness in there...)Phoenix:\nWait right there! Mr. White, you've dug your own grave!White:\nWhat is this!?Phoenix:\nYou said the victim ran to the \"left.\" But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran \"right\"!White:\n...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.Phoenix:\nI think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?White:\n! Very strange... I did see her run to the left... I did.Maya:\nPhoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.Phoenix:\nTrue. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)Judge:\nMr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nMiss May says \"right,\" and Mr. White says \"left.\" Can you explain this contradiction to the court?Mr. White is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs Mr. White testified, Mia ran to the left.\nJudge:\nBut... But if that's the case... Why would she run in the opposite direction from the door?\nPhoenix:\nShe did not. She was running towards the door, Your Honor.\nEdgeworth:\nBwah! Now you're the one making a contradiction, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nNot at all.\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Miss May is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs Miss May has stated, Mia ran to the right after she was attacked.\nWhite:\nWhat is this? I am not fashioning fabrications, I assure you! That lady ran to the left! I am sure of it!\nPhoenix:\nThen there can be only one explanation.\nEdgeworth:\nEh...? And that is?\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Both are right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBoth witnesses are telling the truth. (For once...)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! I doubt it! Er, rather, that does not clear up the contradiction!\nPhoenix:\nThere is one scenario that would explain their conflicting accounts.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Phoenix:\nObviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!Judge:\nMr. Wright! What do you mean?Edgeworth:\nYes, what do you mean, he was not \"viewing the crime from the hotel\"!? If he was not in the hotel, where could he have been!?Phoenix:\nIn the law offices of Fey & Co., of course! More specifically, he was standing here! (Time to show the court where Mr. White was standing!) (Changed from [Show the court where Mr. White was standing!] in the original release)Present killer's location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is where he was!\"Present victim's location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's where he was!\nEdgeworth:\nM-Mr. Wright! We are not fools! How could he have been exactly where the victim was standing!?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh... oh, right!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Your Honor! Sorry!

In fact, you wouldn't have been able to see it after it fell, either! There's no way you could have recognized the broken shards as a glass light stand! So, when did you see the stand, Mr. White?

He ordered his secretary, Miss April May, to tap the law offices of Ms. Fey.Judge:\nWhat does that have to do...?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. The question is: when was the wiretap placed in the office, and by who?Phoenix:\nNo! You wouldn't!Edgeworth:\nMr. White. In order to place the wiretap, you entered Ms. Fey's office. Am I correct...?White:\n...\u00a0! C-correct! You are most correct, Miles!Phoenix:\nGive me a break!White:\nYes... in order to place the wiretap, I breached the Fey & Co. Law Offices! That is when I saw that accursed light stand!Judge:\nNow I'm confused. Please explain to the court what all this means, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nGladly, Your Honor. Mr. Phoenix Wright has made his position quite clear. He has determined that Mr. White knew the glass stand was in the office. He has shown that there was only one time Mr. White could have seen the stand: at the very moment of the murder!

It is a fact that Mr. White had been to that office well before the murder took place! When he went to place the wiretap! (Changed from [He went to place the wiretap!] in the original release) He could have seen the glass light stand then. Ergo, Mr. Phoenix Wright's theory is revealed for the baseless conjecture it is!Judge:\nMr. White! You will testify to the court about this wiretapping!

Now, I want you to listen to me, Phoenix. Maya never gave up. You can't either! That's what I came here to tell you.Phoenix:\n...! B-but!Mia:\nWe don't have much time, Phoenix. Now listen. You've already won.Phoenix:\nHuh...?Mia:\nYou have that Receipt in the court record, right?Phoenix:\nUm... oh, yeah! The one you wrote \"Maya\" on...?Mia:\nPhoenix! White wrote that, not me!Phoenix:\nSo... so what do I do with it?Mia:\nLook at the front of the receipt!Phoenix:\nThe... front? (It's a regular receipt... Looks like it's from a famous department store. \"$1,000.00\"... Wow, big spender! ([Wow] lowercase in the original release) \"Item\"... \"glass light stand\"...! \"Date of purchase\"... \"September 4\"...) ...! September 4!Mia:\nThat's right, Phoenix.

You haven't called in a while.\nMia:\nSorry, I've been so busy. How you been?\n???:\nWell, LONELY. And it's all YOUR fault. Nah, I'm just teasing. I've been great! I'm finally getting used to having my own place.\nMia:\nThat's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.\n???:\nI know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you?\nMia:\nSharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.\n???:\nI gotcha. So, what is it this time?\nMia:\nIt's... a clock.\n???:\nA clock?\nMia:\nYeah, it's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.\n???:\nHey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!\nMia:\nNow, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.\n???:\nHuh? It's not working? That's lame!\nMia:\nI had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.\n???:\nPapers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.\nMia:\nCan you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then.\n???:\nOkay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger.\nMia:\nOkay, okay. We'll hit the usual joint.\n???:\nAlright! It's a deal! Okay, Sis, see you soon!\nMia:\nYep. I'll be waiting, Maya.\nCellular:\n*beep*\n[Conversation recorded. September 5, 9:27 AM]\nSeptember 5, 8:57 PMFey & Co. Law Offices\n???:\nNow, Miss Fey, I'll take what's mine... the papers.\nMia:\nI'm sorry, but I can't give you what I don't have.\n???:\nMiss Fey, you are a poor liar. Why, I see it right over there... That must be \"The Thinker\" that swallowed those papers.\nMia:\nHow could you know...?\n???:\nHo hoh. You are not cogniferous of my background? Gathering information is my business, you see.\nMia:\nI... I should have been more careful.\n???:\nHo hoh. My dear Miss Fey... I am so very sorry. But I am afraid I must ask you for one more thing. Your eternal silence... Farewell, Miss Fey.\nMia:\n!!!\nRed... White... Blue...\nEpisode 2Turnabout Sisters\nSeptember 5, 9:08 PMFey & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nUh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!)\nPhoenix:\nThat smell... Blood!\n???:\n... *sob* Sis...\nPhoenix:\n(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?\nChief!!!\nPhoenix:\nWho are you?\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)\nPhoenix:\nChief...\nFey & Co. Law Offices\nAfter examining corded phone in Office and presenting Receipt in Fey & Co. Law Offices:\n*whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*...\nPhoenix:\n! The police! (Sounds like they're coming this way!)\nFreeze! Police!\nGumshoe:\nAlright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see?\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe...? What an odd name.)\nGumshoe:\nWe received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder.\nPhoenix:\n(It must have been that woman I saw.)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay?\nPhoenix:\n(Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.)\nGumshoe:\nWhoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me!\nMaya:\nEek!\nGumshoe:\nThis word \"Maya\" here mean anything to you?\nMaya:\n...! Um... that... That's my name...\nGumshoe:\nWHAAAAT!? The victim drew this here note in her own blood, see? With her dying breath, she wrote down the killer's name!\nMaya:\nK-killer...? I'm not--\nGumshoe:\nCase closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am.\nMaya:\nW-what?\nPhoenix:\nMia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.\nSeptember 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)\nMaya:\nOh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.\nPhoenix:\nGood morning! (She looks so tired...)\nMaya:\nUm... Are you going to be my attorney?\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...\nPhoenix:\n(Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought...\nMaya:\nI-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you.\nPhoenix:\nHeard...? Heard what about me?\nMaya:\nI... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day...\nMia:\n\"Today was my junior partner's first time in court.\"\nMaya:\nWow! Really? How'd that go?\nMia:\n\"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while...\"\nMaya:\nHah! So, he crashed and burned?\nMia:\n\"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience.\"\nMaya:\nHuh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!\nMia:\n\"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty.\"\nMaya:\nThat's what she said!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nI-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you...\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia...\nMaya:\n... I know...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\n... Um...!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Something the matter?\nMaya:\nUm... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor?\nPhoenix:\n...?\nMaya:\nThis is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nMaya:\nThey told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\nPhoenix:\nWhen will that happen?\nMaya:\nThey're giving me until 4:00 this afternoon.\nPhoenix:\n(And visiting hours are almost up... I'd better hurry!) Right, I'll be back!\nSeptember 6Fey & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\n(The office is filled with police officers. They're all busily searching for clues...)\n???:\nHey! You there! This is a crime scene, pal! No trespassing! Umm... Sorry, don't I know you from somewhere? Wait, you're that Butz guy, aren't you!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, Phoenix Wright. (How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?)\n???:\nAh, guess I got the wrong name, Mr. Wright. Sorry 'bout that. That Butz guy, he was a killer! And you're no killer! Right?\nPhoenix:\n(He WAS proven innocent...) Umm... right. And you were...\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\nPolice:\nHey, Dick! Get over here!\nGumshoe:\nY-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Whew! He thinks I'm Maya's lawyer...!)\nAfter clearing \"Mia\" and \"Maya\" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo:\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)\nGumshoe:\nYou all done, pal?\nPhoenix:\nUm, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.\nGumshoe:\nOh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!\nPhoenix:\n... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?\nGumshoe:\nAhah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!\nPhoenix:\n(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.\nGumshoe:\nYou got that right, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)\nSeptember 6Grossberg Law Offices\nPhoenix:\n(According to the receptionist, the big boss is \"out\". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)\nDetention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)\nMaya:\nHey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nSorry. I haven't seen him yet.\nMaya:\nI see...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)\nSeptember 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303\nApril:\nWell! Hello there, handsome.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)\nApril:\nYou're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, \"Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!\" Tee hee!\nPhoenix:\n(Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.)\nApril:\nGee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness!\nPhoenix:\n(I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.)\nPhoenix:\n(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)\nApril:\nHey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?\nPhoenix:\n(Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?)\nGrossberg Law Offices (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... seems like Mr. Grossberg is out. Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.)\n???:\n*Ah-HHHHEM!*\nPhoenix:\n(If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!)\nGrossberg:\nAh hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me?\nPhoenix:\nUh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!)\nGrossberg:\nHmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now?\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, well... yes.\nGrossberg:\nAnd what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed!\nPhoenix:\n(Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?)\nGrossberg:\nHmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it!\nPhoenix:\nUm... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey.\nGrossberg:\n...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm? Why the strange reaction?)\nGrossberg:\nA-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible.\nPhoenix:\nW-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!?\nGrossberg:\nUrk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion.\nPhoenix:\n(What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?)\nFey & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\n... (Looks like Detective Gumshoe has gone home. The police are still keeping themselves busy in the chief's office. No one has time to talk to me. Guess I'll head out.)\nDetention Center (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303, then visitng Grossberg Law Offices)\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Maya's not here. She must be in questioning. They probably won't let her out for a while. Maybe I'd better go talk to that lawyer again.\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Grossberg Law Offices:\nSeptember 6, 3:42 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nHiya.\nMaya:\nOh! You're back! Did you find the lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nUm... well... (What do I tell her?) Well, see... (Just be honest!) I... I really don't think you should use that guy. He... didn't seem healthy. He was all skin and bones!\nMaya:\n... What really happened?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nYou don't mean... He refused to help?\nPhoenix:\nUrp.\nMaya:\n... I see. I've been abandoned, then.\nMaya:\nJust a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess...\nPhoenix:\n... (4:00 PM. Time's up. What should I do? Do I just leave her and go home...?)\nPhoenix:\nI've made up my mind! I'm going to defend you whether you want me to or not!\nMaya:\n! Why?\nPhoenix:\nWhy? Well...\nPhoenix:\nI won't abandon you. You can count on me.\nMaya:\n... That's so kind of you... *sniff*... ...\nPhoenix:\nWell! Let's fight this one and get you out of here!\nMaya:\nR-right! Thank you!\nPhoenix:\n(Whew, she smiled at last. She looks like an entirely different person!) One last question... You are innocent, right?\nMaya:\nYes! And I trust you... So you trust me, too, okay?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a deal. (So, what next... There's something that's been bugging me... Just what was inside that strange woman's drawer? It was when I tried to look into the drawer that she got all defensive. There has to be something in there!)\nGatewater Hotel\nBellboy:\nGood afternoon, sir!\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, you are...?\nBellboy:\nAh, I beg your pardon, sir! I am the bellboy of this establishment, at your service, sir.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right.\nBellboy:\nI've just come up to deliver room service, sir.\nPhoenix:\nUm... do you know where Miss May might be?\nBellboy:\nAh. I believe our guest Miss May is currently using the, er, facilities...? If you've no need of anything, I'll be taking my leave. Please, stay as long as you like. Enjoy...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Wait... no! Hey! ... (Why does it seem like every time I come here, I end up embarrassing myself? Wait... now's my chance to snoop around a bit!)\nBellboy:\nAh, I almost forgot!\nPhoenix:\nGah! Y-you came back quick!\nBellboy:\nMight I ask you to inform Miss May that there is a message for her? Please tell her that Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?)\nMaya:\nWhite... That was his name. My sister told me.\nPhoenix:\n(\"White\" was the name of the guy who ruined Mia and Maya's mother! Could it be a coincidence?)\nPhoenix:\nThere's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer. Now's my chance to see what's inside! ...! What do we have here! A... wiretap? Hmm! What would a woman like her be doing with a thing like this?\nWiretap added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThere is definitely something suspicious about this \"Miss May\"! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean.\nApril:\nOh, bellboy...? Still there?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh, time to scram! I look forward to tangoing with you tomorrow, Miss May! In court!)\nTo be continued.\n\nSeptember 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1\nJudge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.\nEdgeworth:\nIf we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!\nEdgeworth:\nWitness, please state your name and profession to the court.\nGumshoe:\nSir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.\nGumshoe:\nVery well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd the cause of death?\nGumshoe:\nLoss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of \"The Thinker\" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!\nJudge:\nThe court accepts the statue as evidence.\nPhoenix:\n(They're still calling it a \"statue\"...)\nFloor Plans added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nNow, Detective...\nGumshoe:\nY-yes sir!\nEdgeworth:\nYou immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?\nGumshoe:\nYes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!\nJudge:\nHmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this \"hard evidence.\"\nWitness Testimony\n-- Maya Fey's Arrest --\nGumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!\nThere were two people there already:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!\nWhy? We had a witness account describing her!\nThe witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!\nJudge:\nHmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)\n...whoosh...SMACK!\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)\nJudge:\nSomething the matter?\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Maya Fey's Arrest --\nGumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!\nGumshoe:\nThere were two people there already:\nGumshoe:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nGumshoe:\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!\nGumshoe:\nWhy? We had a witness account describing her!\nGumshoe:\nThe witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)\nPhoenix:\nHold on just one second!\nGumshoe:\nY-yeah?\nPhoenix:\nIf I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had \"hard evidence\" she did it, correct?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Did... did I say that? Me?\nPhoenix:\nI heard you say it!\nJudge:\nYou did say it.\nEdgeworth:\nYou said it.\nPhoenix:\nExactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was \"hard evidence\"!?\nGumshoe:\nWh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...\nJudge:\nThat's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUmm...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)\nGumshoe:\n... Yes.\nPhoenix:\n(Gah!)\nGumshoe:\nSorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nVery well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Hard Evidence --\nGumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!\nOn it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!\nLab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!\nAlso, there was blood found on the victim's finger!\nBefore she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\nHow you like that? That's my \"hard evidence\"!\nJudge:\nHmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nY-Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWhy didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?\nGumshoe:\nAh... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.\nJudge:\nTry to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Hard Evidence --\nGumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.\nGumshoe:\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!\nGumshoe:\nOn it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!\nGumshoe:\nLab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!\nGumshoe:\nAlso, there was blood found on the victim's finger!\nGumshoe:\nBefore she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\nPhoenix:\n(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?\nGumshoe:\nWh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?\nPhoenix:\nYou have it backwards, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nB-backwards?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. \"Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object.\" She died immediately!\nGumshoe:\nBut...!\nPhoenix:\nNo \"but\"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?\nPhoenix:\nWh-when...!?\nJudge:\nThe prosecution's point being...?\nEdgeworth:\nThat autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?\nEdgeworth:\nA second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! \"Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow.\" I received these results this morning.\nPhoenix:\nN-no way!\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write \"Maya\"! That is all.\nJudge:\nI see!\nPhoenix:\n(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)\nEdgeworth:\nWhy, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, I submit this report to the court.\nJudge:\nU-understood. The court accepts the evidence.\nAutopsy Report updated in the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.\nJudge:\nI suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.\nPhoenix:\n(Darn! This isn't good!)\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!\nJudge:\nLet the witness Miss April May take the stand.\nPhoenix:\n(Exactly what part of her is \"innocent\"...?)\nEdgeworth:\nWitness, your name, please.\nApril:\nApril May! At your service! *wink*\nJudge:\nOrder! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking! ([wanton] misspelled as [wonton] in the original release)\nApril:\nAww... Yes, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)\nEdgeworth:\nTell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?\nApril:\nUm... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?\nApril:\nMmm... that's right, big boy.\nJudge:\nPlease testify to the court about what you saw.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witness's Account --\nApril:\nIt was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!\nAnd then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!\nThe one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!\nThen the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!\nBut that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!\nThen the woman with long hair...\nShe kinda... slumped.\nThe end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...\nPhoenix:\nW-wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nWhat about my cross-examination!?\nJudge:\nI thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...\nPhoenix:\nH-hey! How dare you!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?\nJudge:\nVery well, you may begin your cross-examination!\nCross Examination\n-- Witness's Account --\nApril:\nIt was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!\nApril:\nAnd then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!\nApril:\nThe one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!\nApril:\nThen the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!\nApril:\nBut that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!)\nPhoenix:\nHold on a minute! That testimony stinks!\nApril:\nW-what!?\nPhoenix:\nMiss May, I'm willing to bet that...\nApril:\nUrp!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! What's the meaning of this?\nApril:\nYes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!\nPhoenix:\nOkay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!\nApril:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nNo one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!\nApril:\nBut... but!\nJudge:\nStill, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...\nPhoenix:\nShe was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?\nApril:\nRowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.\nJudge:\nMiss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.\nApril:\nI'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*\nJudge:\nYour testimony again, if you would.\nPhoenix:\n(Damn, I almost had her!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witness's Account --\nApril:\nI did see everything! I did!\nThe victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.\nThen the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...\nAnd she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!\nThat... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think?\nWell? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee!\nJudge:\nI... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Witness's Account --\nApril:\nI did see everything! I did!\nApril:\nThe victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.\nApril:\nThen the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...\nApril:\nAnd she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!\nApril:\nThat... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think?\nPhoenix:\n(Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.)\nPhoenix:\nMiss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.\nApril:\nRevealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...\nPhoenix:\nYou just said that this statue of \"The Thinker\" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!\nApril:\nUrp!\nPhoenix:\nAnother person in much the same position as you recently called this a \"clock,\" too... And he was found guilty... of murder!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nPhoenix:\nMiss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?\nApril:\nOooh... urp!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!\nJudge:\nYes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)\nJudge:\n... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.\nPhoenix:\n(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)\nApril:\nHuh? What? So... what happens now?\nPhoenix:\nWhat happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?\nApril:\nWhat...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!\nPhoenix:\nSo, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!\nApril:\nN-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!\nEdgeworth:\nThe law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!\nJudge:\nHmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!\nJudge:\nThis clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?\nPhoenix:\nIt is as you can see. The \"clock\" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!\nApril:\nF-fat!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Miss May?\nEdgeworth:\nTsk tsk.\nPhoenix:\n?\nEdgeworth:\nQuite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)\nEdgeworth:\nI'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!\nJudge:\n! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?\nEdgeworth:\nHo hoh! Impossible, of course...\nPhoenix:\nI have proof.\nEdgeworth:\nW-what!?\nPhoenix:\nWasn't it you who told me \"proof is everything\"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the \"proof\" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this!\nJudge:\nHmm. That's a very cute cell phone.\nApril:\nOoh hoo! You have a girlie phone!\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nEdgeworth:\nThe defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!\nPhoenix:\nPerhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?\nEdgeworth:\n*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)\nPhoenix:\n(I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.) (Changed from [My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.] in the original release) Let's hear the conversation.\nCellular:\n*beep*\n...\nMaya:\n[So you just want me to hold on to \"The Thinker\" for you, then?]\nMia:\n[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]\nMaya:\n[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]\nMia:\n[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]\n...[September 5, 9:27 AM]\nCellular:\n*beep*\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded, (Changed from [I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone...] in the original release) which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel! (Changed from [and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!] in the original release)\nApril:\nMuh... muh... muh!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?\nApril:\n... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*\nJudge:\nSo the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThe witness claims she had \"seen it before.\" But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!\nJudge:\nWell then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.\nPhoenix:\nIt's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!\nApril:\nW-whaaat!?\nPhoenix:\nA friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!\nApril:\nI-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!\nPhoenix:\nMiss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?\nApril:\nMmpf...\nPhoenix:\nOh? Excuses not on sale today?\nApril:\nOooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!\nJudge:\nW-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!\nApril:\nHrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*\nPhoenix:\n(S-scary...)\nJudge:\nMiss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?\nApril:\n...\nJudge:\nHmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...\nJudge:\nWell, does the defense have anything to say?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... (Come on, think of something!)\nJudge:\nVery well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\nEdgeworth:\nI believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy.\nBellboy:\nYes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service.\nJudge:\nThat tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony.\nBellboy:\nVery good, sir!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Miss May's Room Service --\nBellboy:\nI am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!\nI believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.\nShe asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.\nI brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.\nAnd I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.\nJudge:\nI see. The defense may begin its cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\nR-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!)\nCross Examination\n-- Miss May's Room Service --\nBellboy:\nI am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!\nBellboy:\nI believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.\nBellboy:\nShe asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.\nBellboy:\nI brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.\nBellboy:\nAnd I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.\nPhoenix:\n(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)\nAfter pressing fourth and fifth statements:\nPhoenix:\n... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)\nEdgeworth:\nTsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here!\nJudge:\nHmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't let this happen... can I?)\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! Please wait!\nJudge:\nYes? Does the defense have something to add?\nPhoenix:\nOne last question... let me ask one last question!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all.\nPhoenix:\n(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)\nEdgeworth:\nI object! That was... objectionable!\nJudge:\n... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.\nBellboy:\nEr... yes, I see.\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you not mention this in your testimony!?\nBellboy:\nW-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!\nPhoenix:\n(Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!\nBellboy:\nAh, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...\nPhoenix:\n!\nBellboy:\nHe asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nOof! Y-you fool!\nPhoenix:\nI've done it... I've won!\nPhoenix:\nMiss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?\nBellboy:\nYes, sir.\nPhoenix:\nThen, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?\nBellboy:\nThat's right, sir.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd who, Mr. Wright! Who is this \"other person\"! (Changed from [Who! Who is this 'other person'!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSimple, it was...\nPhoenix:\nThe man who checked in with Miss May!\nEdgeworth:\nOof!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!\nEdgeworth:\nM-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late...\nPhoenix:\n\"Too late\"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!\nEdgeworth:\nOof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!\nJudge:\nEnough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nThat is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned!\nSeptember 7, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nMaya:\nMr. Wright! You were amazing in there!\nPhoenix:\nR-really?\nMaya:\nI think I might be your newest fan!\nPhoenix:\nOh, I was just \"doing my job\" you know... heh heh.\nMaya:\nThen again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too...\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nThat face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine!\nPhoenix:\nHmm... if you say so.\nMaya:\nSo, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... (Changed from [Well, no.] in the original release) No, I don't think so. Not yet. (Changed from [I don't think so. Not yet.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nOh... I see.\nPhoenix:\nBut I got a great lead in today's trial!\nMaya:\nA \"lead\"?\nPhoenix:\nThat man with Miss May! He's the key!\nMaya:\nOh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?\nPhoenix:\nI heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.\nMaya:\nYes sir!\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to find out more about this man.\nMaya:\nDo you think he was the one who...?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe so.\nMaya:\nSis...\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.\nMaya:\nI'm counting on you!\nPhoenix:\nI asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that hasn't been stricken from the record. (Changed from [In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.] in the original release)\nMay Testimony added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nI don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to set her free!

I didn't expect anyone to visit me in such a dank place as this... It's really quite... moving. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you die! Have you come to laugh? Yes, laugh at the fallen Miss May!\nPhoenix:\nNo, not really, there's something I wanted to ask.\nApril:\nUnfortunately, there is nothing I want to BE asked. Haven't you done enough questioning, you...! Spiky-head!\nPhoenix:\n(Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard.\nApril:\n... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then? Hmm?\nPhoenix:\n(For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?)\nSeptember 7Fey & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nLooks like forensics is taking the day off today. Detective Gumshoe's nowhere in sight. The police really gave this place a working over. I doubt there are any valuable clues left.

Maybe he's avoiding me for some reason?)\nDetention Center (after visiting Grossberg Law Offices)\nApril:\nYOU AGAIN!? Can't you take a hint and stay gone?\nPhoenix:\nHey, the only reason I'm back here is because YOU won't talk to me!\nApril:\nOh, so it's MY fault now?

Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself.\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.\nBellboy:\nNo, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's \"rep,\" as they say.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? \"Rep\"?\nBellboy:\nYes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder.\nBellboy:\nI, too, will become famous! \"The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee\"...!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...)\nBellboy:\nSo!

I was just inquirably asking the title that you go by.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. (\"Inquirably\"...?)\nWhite:\nMr. Wright, is it? Right, I see... Splendiferous. Perhaps I have intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary...?\nPhoenix:\n(What is this guy's problem!)\nWhite:\nI'm Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You know, Corporate Expansion Official? My business dealings bring me into contact with the elite of the elite. So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged.\nPhoenix:\n(What a fruitcake!)\nWhite:\nHmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this!\nPhoenix:\n(What does he mean by that?)\nWhite:\nNo matter. So, what business does a \"mighty\" lawyer have with a man such as myself?\nPhoenix:\n(Yipes! This guy's arrogance meter is off the scale!)\nWhite:\n... Mr. Wrong, was it?\nPhoenix:\nWright.\nWhite:\nIt appears you do not fully grasp your position here. I ask again. Who are you?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... huh? A lawyer?\nWhite:\nNo, my feeble friend. A \"mere\" lawyer. Worth nothing. Zilch. Zippo. Nada! Just like that sorry excuse for an attorney, Grodyburger!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-what!?) Ungh! Oof...! Unh... uhhh... (He... he punched me!)\nWhite:\nWell, Mr. Lawyer. What will you do, eh? Charge me with assault? Charge away, I welcome it! For it is YOU who will be found guilty!\nPhoenix:\nWhat...?\nWhite:\nHeed my exposition! The police, the courts, they all do my bidding.\nPhoenix:\n(So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?)\nWhite:\nI don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Grossberg's... yes.\nWhite:\nThen you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you? Perhaps he will explain how a man can live life purely for personal profit! ... Go now! Skedaddle! There is nothing more to discuss!\nDetention Center (after visiting Bluecorp)\nPhoenix:\nApparently, Miss May is in questioning. I doubt they'll let me talk to her today.\nGrossberg Law Offices (after selecting \"\"I've seen it before\" or \"When did you get it?\" upon selecting \"That painting\" Talk option in Bluecorp)\nGrossberg:\n... ... ...\nPhoenix:\n(Huh?

You looked so pensive... like an old man at the end of his days.\nGrossberg:\nHmm? I'm not senile yet! I was just thinking about this whole mess...\nPhoenix:\n(Something's really bothering him, that much is clear.)\nGrossberg:\nRedd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now...\nPhoenix:\n(15 years...!)\nGrossberg:\nAll because of the \"DL-6 Incident,\" as you may have guessed.\nPhoenix:\n(The name on the back of those photographs!)\nGrossberg:\nAs you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's the connection!)\nGrossberg:\nIt is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.\nPhoenix:\nImpossible? Why!?\nGrossberg:\nHe has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGrossberg:\nThey are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years.\nFey & Co.

You are a mere lawyer! As was Miss Mia.\nPhoenix:\nHow dare you!\nWhite:\nI'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled.

(Changed from [It's the beginning of a new century, yet with crime it's the same old story.] in the original release) In fact, it's gotten worse. Lengthy court proceedings are no longer realistic. Beginning a few years ago, a limit of three days was put on initial court trials. Almost all finish in a day. Most with a guilty verdict. I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself for this case. (Changed from [I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself.] in the original release) With the true culprit appearing as the star witness. (Changed from [Tomorrow the true culprit will appear as a witness.] in the original release) This is it! Tomorrow, it's me or him! (Changed from [This is it!

I guess this is it!Phoenix:\nYeah. One way or another, this case gets decided today.Maya:\nAaa! Ph-Phoenix! Look!Phoenix:\n(...! Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)Edgeworth:\nI received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.Phoenix:\n?Edgeworth:\nHe told me that whatever Mr. White says today, it will be the \"absolute truth.\" No matter how you try to attack his testimony... If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.Phoenix:\n(What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?) So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?Edgeworth:\n... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.Maya:\nWhy... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?Edgeworth:\n\"Innocent\"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared \"guilty\"! So I make that my policy.Phoenix:\nEdgeworth... You've changed.Maya:\nHmm? Phoenix! You know him!?Edgeworth:\nDon't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.Maya:\nPh-Phoenix...?Phoenix:\nWell... court will be starting soon. (Changed from [Well... court will be opening for session soon.] in the original release)Maya:\nWhat? But wait! Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! They're not... (Changed from [Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! He's not...] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI'll be defending myself.Maya:\nWhaaaat!?Phoenix:\nOkay, let's do this.September 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nMr. Wright... Are you sure you're up to doing this?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.Judge:\nUnderstood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nAs the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of a witness to the defendant's crime. (Changed from [today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.] in the original release)Judge:\nI see. The prosecution may call its witness.Phoenix:\n(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)Objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court.\nJudge:\nExcellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Great. He gets to show off and I get nowhere.)\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!\"Let it go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Forget it. I smell a trap.)\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!\"Edgeworth:\nI would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!Edgeworth:\nPlease state your full name.White:\nYou wish to know the title of my personage?Edgeworth:\nEr... your name?White:\nYes! That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?Edgeworth:\nName!Phoenix:\n(These two are great together...)White:\nMy name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp.Edgeworth:\nDid you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?White:\nThat would be a negatory! No, I did not.Edgeworth:\n... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?White:\nCorrect.Edgeworth:\nAnd you witnessed the murder from there?White:\nAhem. Why tell you what you already know?Judge:\nVery well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)White:\nHo hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:\n...!Maya:\nLet him have it, Phoenix!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --White:\nLet's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.\nI was quietly perusifying... er, that's \"reading\" to you, some papers by the window.\nThen I heard a bedlam coming from outside!\nSurprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.\nIt was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!\nNeedless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!\nI called Miss May over at once. She, too, was flabbergasted of course.\nThe victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!\nFinally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Judge:\nHmm...

Miss May clearly stated that the assailant looked like a \"girl\"!\nWhite:\nI've always been proud of my eyesight, Mr. Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nJust what is your eyesight?\nWhite:\nCounting both eyes... 40!\nPhoenix:\n40!? Don't add them together!\nJudge:\nI think the witness is trying to say his eyesight is good.\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what did you do then?White:\nI called Miss May over at once. She, too, was surprised of course.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Miss May doing at that time?\nWhite:\nShe had just finished watching a soap opera on the TV, and was weeping openly.\nPhoenix:\nDid you know she had been tapping the Fey office phone?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIrrelevant! That has nothing to do with the case at hand.\nWhite:\nI care not. I will answer the lawyer's bold inquiry. Miss May was acting alone when she tapped the phone of this Fey woman.\nPhoenix:\nYou'd make a good politician, Mr. White.\nWhite:\nHo hoh! After all, I am \"El Presidente.\"\nJudge:\nPlease continue.White:\nThe victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan you be a little more detailed about that? I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened.\nWhite:\nOf course! Comprende! I understand! The victim was attacked, by you, and ran to the left. You gave chase, and struck her down!\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure?\nWhite:\nAs you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect!\nJudge:\nPerhaps you could change your testimony to reflect this new detail.\nChanges statement from \"The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!\" to \"The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!\"White:\nThe victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nWhite:\nHow many times must I say it?

Then it was all over...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... \"impaction\"? Don't you mean just \"impact\"?\nWhite:\nRidiculosity!

Anyway, I'd better find a weakness in there...)Phoenix:\nWait right there! Mr. White, you've dug your own grave!White:\nWhat is this!?Phoenix:\nYou said the victim ran to the \"left.\" But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran \"right\"!White:\n...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.Phoenix:\nI think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?White:\n! Very strange... I did see her run to the left... I did.Maya:\nPhoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.Phoenix:\nTrue. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)Judge:\nMr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nMiss May says \"right,\" and Mr. White says \"left.\" Can you explain this contradiction to the court?Mr. White is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs Mr. White testified, Mia ran to the left.\nJudge:\nBut... But if that's the case... Why would she run in the opposite direction from the door?\nPhoenix:\nShe did not. She was running towards the door, Your Honor.\nEdgeworth:\nBwah! Now you're the one making a contradiction, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nNot at all.\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Miss May is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs Miss May has stated, Mia ran to the right after she was attacked.\nWhite:\nWhat is this? I am not fashioning fabrications, I assure you! That lady ran to the left! I am sure of it!\nPhoenix:\nThen there can be only one explanation.\nEdgeworth:\nEh...? And that is?\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Both are right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBoth witnesses are telling the truth.

What do you mean?Edgeworth:\nYes, what do you mean, he was not \"viewing the crime from the hotel\"!? If he was not in the hotel, where could he have been!?Phoenix:\nIn the law offices of Fey & Co., of course! More specifically, he was standing here! (Time to show the court where Mr. White was standing!)

He ordered his secretary, Miss April May, to tap the law offices of Ms. Fey.Judge:\nWhat does that have to do...?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor.

Am I correct...?White:\n...\u00a0! C-correct! You are most correct, Miles!Phoenix:\nGive me a break!White:\nYes... in order to place the wiretap, I breached the Fey & Co. Law Offices! That is when I saw that accursed light stand!Judge:\nNow I'm confused. Please explain to the court what all this means, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nGladly, Your Honor. Mr. Phoenix Wright has made his position quite clear. He has determined that Mr. White knew the glass stand was in the office. He has shown that there was only one time Mr. White could have seen the stand: at the very moment of the murder!

It is a fact that Mr. White had been to that office well before the murder took place! When he went to place the wiretap!

      "newContext": "-- The Wiretapping --White:\nIt was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nD-do you have proof!?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nMiss April May knew the details of Ms. Fey's phone conversation! This proves that the wiretap was placed before the murder!\nPhoenix:\nHuh... right.White:\nI had entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas it really you that went into the office? Or was it Miss May?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nUnidentified fingerprints several days old were found in the Fey & Co. Law Offices. Those were obviously Mr. White's.\nPhoenix:\n(And if I know Edgeworth, he's already run a check on those prints...)\nEdgeworth:\nNow, Mr. White. Tell us why you went to the Fey & Co. Law Offices.White:\nOf course, I had done so to place the wiretap.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you tap Mia's phone!?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat has no bearing on the current case, Your Honor.\nWhite:\nBluecorp is a detective agency of sorts. We have a responsibility to protect client confidentiality!White:\nThat is when I saw this glass light stand.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you notice something as innocuous as a light stand!?\nWhite:\nThe light stand was made entirely out of glass. It was quite stylish, so I guess it made a lasting impression on me. Such a beautacious thing deserves attention, does it not? That is all.Phoenix:\n(Dammit! There's nothing there for me to press him on! Oh well... maybe he's rattled enough that I can bluff something out of him!)After pressing first, second, and fourth statements, then pressing third statement:Phoenix:\n(Uh oh! Don't tell me I've run out of ammo!)Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk. I'm afraid that's as far as you go, Mr. Wright. The time has come for you to admit your defeat! You fought... honorably.Phoenix:\n(No more... I can't take this anymore...)Judge:\nMr. Wright? Are you giving up?Phoenix:\n... Y-yes, Your Honor.???:(Phoenix!)Phoenix:\n...????:(Phoenix! Over here!)Phoenix:\n(I know that voice! ... M-Mia!?)Mia:\nNever give up, Phoenix!Phoenix:\n...!!!! M-M-Mia...!Phoenix:\nWhere... Where am I? The waiting lobby...? What happened? ... Oh, right... I lost the trial. I was... hallucinating. ...Mia:\nAh, you're finally awake.Phoenix:\nGak!Mia:\nH-hey! Phoenix! ... \"Gak\"? That's no way to greet an old friend! Phoenix, I want you to look at me.Phoenix:\nY-You're... M-Maya...?Mia:\nDidn't you know the Fey women have strong psychic powers...? When you accepted your defeat in court... It appears that was enough of a shock to awaken Maya's true powers.Phoenix:\nSo... Maya is channeling you, Mia?Mia:\nThat's right. I am Maya, but I'm also Mia. Now, I want you to listen to me, Phoenix. Maya never gave up. You can't either! That's what I came here to tell you.Phoenix:\n...! B-but!Mia:\nWe don't have much time, Phoenix. Now listen. You've already won.Phoenix:\nHuh...?Mia:\nYou have that Receipt in the court record, right?Phoenix:\nUm... oh, yeah! The one you wrote \"Maya\" on...?Mia:\nPhoenix! White wrote that, not me!Phoenix:\nSo... so what do I do with it?Mia:\nLook at the front of the receipt!Phoenix:\nThe... front? (It's a regular receipt... Looks like it's from a famous department store. \"$1,000.00\"... Wow, big spender! ([Wow] lowercase in the original release) \"Item\"... \"glass light stand\"...! \"Date of purchase\"... \"September 4\"...) ...! September 4!Mia:\nThat's right, Phoenix. I bought that stand the day before I was killed!Phoenix:\nWhoa!Mia:\nNow, what did Mr. White say in his testimony?White:\nIt was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.Phoenix:\nHe said he saw the stand the week before the murder!Mia:\nThere you go! I think the court is about to reconvene! Go do it, Phoenix! You know you're innocent, now you just have to prove it!Phoenix:\nRight!Receipt updated in the Court Record.September 9, 1:16 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:\nThe court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright. Is the defendant... rather, are you alright, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes. Sorry, Your Honor. I'm fine now.Judge:\nThen, let's start where we left off.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. There is nothing to go back to! The cross-examination of Mr. White is finished! All that is required now is for you to pass judgment on the defendant Phoenix Wright!Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nYour Honor! Please, give me one more chance. I promise you, this is the last time I'll ask you!Judge:\nHmm... But, as Mr. Edgeworth has noted, the trial is more or less finished. Mr. Edgeworth, do you have an opinion on this matter?Edgeworth:\nI say... let us give Mr. Phoenix Wright his \"last chance.\"Judge:\nVery well! You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination",

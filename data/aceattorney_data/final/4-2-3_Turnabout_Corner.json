You die.\nJune 15, 9:12 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nApollo:\n(Two months have passed since Mr. Gavin's arrest. My first trial, and I lost both my mentor and my job. Yeah, I'll admit it. I was screwed. But even when I hit bottom, I told myself I'd never come here. Honest. Here being the legendary Wright & Co. Law Offices. OK, Justice, time to stop trembling.)\n???:\nAh! You must be here for the interview. Right this way.\nApollo:\nHuh?\n???:\nHello there! You've found the Wright place! Welcome!\nApollo:\nUh... Ah... (What's with this girl!?)\n???:\nWell now, shall we begin?\nApollo:\nBegin... what?\n???:\nRight, first things first... Any special talents?\nApollo:\nErm, talents?\n???:\nYes, well, you must have at least one!\nApollo:\nWell... Uh... I guess... Defending?\n???:\n\"Defending\"... An unusual talent, but it'll do. With a little jazzing up, of course.\nApollo:\nY-You think so...?\n???:\nLet's give it a go, shall we?\nApollo:\nHuh?\n???:\nGo ahead! Show me! Defend! Just give it all you've got. Don't hold back now!\nApollo:\nWh-What are you talking about? I can't just \"defend\" here!\n???:\nFirst lesson: A professional can perform anywhere!\nApollo:\n...Thanks.\n???:\nWe want people to be laughing with us... ...not at us!\nApollo:\n...Thanks. But I'm not sure why they should be laughing at all.\n???:\nWhat...? What exactly do you think you came here to do?\nApollo:\nWhat? Um, defend... No?\n???:\n... Excuse me, but do you know where you are?\nApollo:\nHuh!? The Wright & Co. Law Offices, right?\n???:\n...Oh. I was afraid of that. Don't worry, you're not the first.\nApollo:\nLook, what's going on here? Who are you? I came here to meet with the person in charge...\n???:\nWell, you've apparently made no fewer than two mistakes.\nApollo:\nMistakes? But I got a call from Mr. Wright this morning!\n???:\nPerhaps you should go read the sign out front again?\nApollo:\nWhat's there to read!? Look, it says right there... ...Oh. Why does it say \"Wright Talent Agency\"...?\n???:\nWelcome to the Wright Talent Agency, where you've \"always come to the Wright place!\"\nTrucy:\nI'm Trucy Wright, CEO. I'm a magician.\nApollo:\n(It all came flooding back... The trial... That girl...)\n???:\nHello, sir. Please, pick a card.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. She's my daughter.\nApollo:\nTrucy... Wright.\nTrucy:\nHere, check out our flyer! So... what's your name?\nApollo:\nApollo... Apollo Justice, attorney at law.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nApollo:\nOK... Which hospital is Mr. Wright in? I'll pay him a visit.\nTrucy:\nOh, the Hickfield Clinic. It's quite close.\nApollo:\nRight. Well, I'll be going now. And I'll, uh... give this showbiz gig some thought, OK?\nTrucy:\nWait! I'll go with you!\nJune 15, 9:45 AMHickfield Clinic\nApollo:\n(So... this is Mr. Wright's hospital...)\n???:\nEh? Visitors are ya? Hrmm?\nApollo:\nUh, yeah. Are you the... doctor?\nHickfield:\nAyup. Dr. Hickfield's the name. Eh he he.\nTrucy:\nGood morning, Doctor!\nHickfield:\nOh, hiya there, Trucy. Cute as ever! Eh he he.\nTrucy:\nIs... this Daddy's room?\nHickfield:\nOh yah. 'Cept he's gone for a mornin' checkup. Be back soon. How're you, Miss Trucy? Got any places you'd like... examined? Eh heh...\nPhoenix:\nDoctor... the nurse was looking for you.\nHickfield:\nWhy, if it isn't the Daddy o' the cutest lil' thing in town! Hrm. Hrmm. Guess I'll be off then. Eh he? Later, Trucy.\nApollo:\nWow, what an odd bird that guy was.\nPhoenix:\nGood morning. Didn't expect you so soon, Apollo.\nApollo:\nMr. Wright...\nAfter clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic:\nJune 15, 10:05 AMWright Talent Agency\n???:\nHey hey hey! How long you planning on making me wait, eh!?\nTrucy:\nAh! Good morning!\n???:\nHey there, Trucy-doll. Sounds like your pops had a bit of a rough spot, eh?\nTrucy:\nAll's well that ends well, I guess...\nApollo:\n(This... is our client?)\n???:\nHey! So this is that Pollo fellow, eh?\nApollo:\nOh, uh, y-yes? (The name's \"Apollo\".)\n???:\nLook at 'im there, arms all crossed-like. Ready to fight!\nApollo:\nYes, sir! ...You don't mean that literally, do you?\n???:\nThe boss told you what I need, right? Don't let me down now, Pollo!\nApollo:\nDon't worry about your defense sir, I'm on it!\n???:\nDefense...? Your noodle half-cooked? It's too late for defense! My castle's been stormed! My keep's been kept! My noodle stand's been stolen!\nApollo:\nN-Noodle...?\nTrucy:\nYou know Mr. Eldoon from the noodle stand, don'cha, Polly?\nApollo:\nNo nicknames, please. And no, of course I don't know him!\n???:\nYou new in these parts?\nApollo:\nNot really...\n???:\nThen you know the best noodles in town: Eldoon's Noodles!\nApollo:\nUh, whose noodles?\n???:\nMy noodles! Er, help me out here, Trucy-doll.\nTrucy:\nThis is Mr. Guy Eldoon... our client! Maybe you can tell us what the problem is, Mr. Eldoon?\nGuy:\nAnything for you, Trucy-doll!\nApollo:\nErm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er...\nTrucy:\nMy panties, yes.\nApollo:\nAh, er, right. Panties.\nGuy:\nThat's a cryin' shame, that is, Trucy-doll.\nTrucy:\nI was alone in the office last night. I had hung my panties out the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. \"Give those back!\" I shouted. \"Wait!\"\nApollo:\nWell, that was certainly brave of you.\nTrucy:\n...But I lost him. Without those panties, I don't know what I'll do...\nGuy:\nA darn cryin' shame, yup.\nTrucy:\nWell, at least the scene of the crime is convenient. I'll mark it on your map!\nGuy:\nI'll be headin' home now. Remember, find my stand or there's an empty bowl in yer future, Pollo!\nApollo:\nEr, right.\nGuy:\nAnd you help out Trucy-doll here, too, y'hear?\nTrucy:\nThings have certainly picked up, haven't they! We had no work yesterday, and now we have three cases!\nApollo:\nI... I guess.\nTrucy:\nLet's see where we stand!\nApollo:\n(Not in a courtroom, that's where.) Well, the first item on our list...\nTrucy:\nPhoenix Wright... Daddy's hit and run accident. We have to find the one who hit him!\nApollo:\n...Who's going to pay us for this again?\nTrucy:\nAnd the second item... Mr. Eldoon's request.. to find his stolen stand.\nApollo:\nFor which we stand to gain... a bowl of salty noodles...\nTrucy:\nAnd the last request is mine! To find my stolen panties!\nApollo:\n...That bowl of noodles is looking better and better.\nTrucy:\nLet's go, Polly! To the streets!\nApollo:\nAren't you enthusiastic.\nTrucy:\nHow could I not be!? Let's crack these cases, you and me!\nApollo:\n(*sigh* Guess we might as well get started... Let's see. A hit and run... a stolen stand... And last but not least... stolen panties.)\nAfter clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then visiting Wright Talent Agency:\nJune 15Hickfield Clinic\nApollo:\nHuh? Mr. Wright's gone.\nTrucy:\nMaybe he's gone for an examination?\nApollo:\nHe'll probably be back soon. Let's wait.\nTrucy:\nI think it might take some time. Daddy always loves his examinations!\nApollo:\n(Don't ask, Justice. You don't want to know.)\nTrucy:\nWhy don't we come back later?\nApollo:\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nWright Talent Agency\nJune 15Accident Scene\nApollo:\nSo this is where Mr. Wright got hit by that car?\nTrucy:\nAccording to the map, this is the place!\nApollo:\nWhat a huge mansion... (Changed from [What a huge mansion... Feels like Chinatown.] in the original release)\nTrucy:\nApollo! There's a nice-looking lady over there. Let's question her!\nApollo:\nUm, OK. (I'm a little curious about the park over there, too...)\nTrucy:\nExcuse me! Um, can we have a few words with you?\n???:\nYou want something?\nApollo:\n(Whoa! That husky voice... Why am I suddenly sweating?)\nTrucy:\nThat's quite a house you've got there! You must have a lot of money...\n???:\nWhoooh. \"Money\" sounds like something my son would call his friends. This is the Kitaki Family mansion, little girl.\nApollo:\nEh.\n???:\nYou, kid with the hair. You want something?\nApollo:\nUrk! M-M-Me? No, not a thing! Bye!\nTrucy:\nApollo! We can't leave without questioning her! What if she knows something!\nApollo:\nB-But th-the Kitaki Family...! (They're the biggest organized crime syndicate in town!)\n???:\nIf you're going to ask something, ask it. If you're man enough.\nApollo:\nWaaaaugh! R-Right!\nTrucy:\nYay! Way to whip him into shape, ma'am!\nApollo:\n(Does she know no fear!?)\nPlum:\nI'm Plum. Plum Kitaki. Wife of the fourth head of the Kitaki Family business. Friends call me Little Plum.\nApollo:\nI-I'm l-little Apollo Justice, attorney at law. *gulp* (If looks could kill, this woman would be a mass-murderer by now...)\nAfter switching to right side view:\nApollo:\nWho's that!? She's looking at the park.\nTrucy:\nShe's pretty. I bet she has a story, you know?\nApollo:\n(There is something about her... Too bad she seems to be in a bit of a rush.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\n???:\n...\nApollo:\n(...That girl from before!)\nPlum:\nOh! Welcome home, sweetie.\n???:\nAh, uh... hello, m-mother.\nApollo:\n(She's a Kitaki, too!?)\nTrucy:\nUh, um, Miss! Miss!\n???:\n...?\nTrucy:\nHere, our flyer.\n???:\nThe... Wright Anything Agency?\nApollo:\nA-Anything Agency?\nTrucy:\nYeah! Do you like the new flyer? So, um, this is our defense attorney, Mr. Apollo Justice!\n???:\nAttorney...?\nTrucy:\nDrop by our office! We'll be waiting!\n???:\nAh... Good-bye.\nApollo:\nWhy did you give her our flyer?\nTrucy:\nI dunno. She seemed like she could use some help.\nApollo:\nShe's the heiress to a gangster dynasty! She doesn't need our help!\nTrucy:\n...I wouldn't be so sure!\nApollo:\n...?\nJune 15Scene of the Stand Theft\nApollo:\nSo... what's this place?\nTrucy:\nThis would be Mr. Eldoon's house, silly.\nApollo:\nOh, so this is where his stand was stolen from. I can see a piece of evidence lying on the ground already.\nTrucy:\n...Hey! Look, there's a police car parked over there.\nApollo:\nYou're right... What's with the sparkly... entrance? What is this place? A hospital? There's a sign... \"Meraktis Clinic\".\nTrucy:\nHmm... Oh! That's where the thief went!\nApollo:\nThe thief...?\nTrucy:\nThe one who snatched my panties! He ran into this clinic last night! Wait, maybe that police car is here to find my panties!\nApollo:\nI doubt it.\nTrucy:\nWell, there's only one way to be sure! Let's investigate!\nGuy:\nAh, there you are, sonny! Well, you find anything yet!?\nApollo:\nEr, um, no. Not yet.\nGuy:\nThe longer you loaf around here the saltier your victory bowl gets, just remember that!\nApollo:\n(This bowl of noodles is sounding less like payment and more like punishment...)\nJune 15Meraktis ClinicGarage\nTrucy:\nThis is the place! This is where that panty-snatcher ran!\nApollo:\nAre you sure?\nTrucy:\nMaybe! Let's look for clues! Clues... to a panty-snatching! Clues... like a pair of panties!\nApollo:\n...Um, Trucy? Could you try not saying \"panties\" so many times?\nAfter examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door:\nTrucy:\nApollo!\nApollo:\nHuh? What is it?\nTrucy:\nNow that we've solved this case, we should go report to Daddy! He'll mope if we leave him alone too long, knowing him.\nApollo:\nUm, OK. ...He doesn't seem the type to mope, though. (And this is hardly a case worth reporting...)\nWright Anything Agency\nKitaki Mansion\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage:\nJune 15Hickfield Clinic\nPhoenix:\nYo! How goes it?\nTrucy:\nDaddy! How do you feel?\nPhoenix:\nNot bad, Trucy, not bad. It's good to have you young'uns on the case. Lets ol' Daddy-o get some well-deserved R&R.\nTrucy:\nThe elderly need their rest!\nApollo:\n(Uh... isn't he only 33?) ...Um, we've cleared up most of the cases...\nPhoenix:\nI was right about you. Competent. Capable. Tell me what you found out. If you want to.\nApollo:\n(Your enthusiasm is over-whelming...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n...Thanks, really. If I get tired of sleeping, maybe I'll head down to this Meraktis place. Maybe hit 'em up for some reparations... A little legal action would do me some good.\nApollo:\nUm... I was wondering when I get paid? We solved the case of your accident, and um, found a missing article of clothing.\nTrucy:\nMy panties!\nPhoenix:\nThat leaves the noodle stand.\nApollo:\nEh.\nPhoenix:\nFeel free to drop in if you get stuck. I'd be happy to help with anything not involving money.\nApollo:\n(Good-bye, quid pro quo. Hello pro bono. *sigh*)\nTrucy:\nRight! Back to the office to plan our next move!\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage:\nJune 15Kitaki Mansion\nTrucy:\nLittle Plum's not here. She's not finished cleaning, huh.\nApollo:\nMaybe she went to get a paint scraper?\nPlum:\nOK! Who's the wise guy who spit gum out on the street!?\nApollo:\n(Her voice carries all the way out to the street from inside the mansion...)\nTrucy:\nShe's a neat freak! How cute!\nPlum:\nYou there! It was you, wasn't it!? Fess up! I hope you've said your prayers. You're gonna need them...\nApollo:\nTr-Trucy? Let's leave. Now.\nTrucy:\n...?\nJune 15Wright Anything Agency\nApollo:\nYou... You're the woman from the Kitaki place!\n???:\nY-Yes...\nTrucy:\nI knew it! Something's the matter and you want our help, right? Well, you've come to the Wright place! This way, please...\n???:\nUm... Thank you.\nAlita:\nMy name is Alita Tiala. I... have a request.\nJune 15Hickfield Clinic\nApollo:\nHuh...? Where's Mr. Wright?\nTrucy:\nMaybe he's getting an examination again?\nApollo:\nHow many does he need!? (Wasn't it just a sprain?)\nTrucy:\nToo bad, Polly! You wanted to show off your request to Daddy, didn't you!\nApollo:\nWhat? Me? No!\nTrucy:\nOh? That's a surprise.\nApollo:\nL-Let's just come back later, shall we?\nAfter clearing \"Your fiancé\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency:\nJune 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nTrucy:\nPolly! You look as happy as a clam in its shell.\nApollo:\nFor a lawyer this is it, the place where the battle begins!\nGuard:\n...Ahem. You need something?\nApollo:\nAaah! Yes, we're attorneys. I was hoping we could see Mr. Wocky Kitaki?\nGuard:\nSorry, he's in questioning right now. Could take a while.\nTrucy:\nDrat. Oh well, guess we'll have to come back later then.\nApollo:\nSo much for that battle...\nAfter clearing \"Your fiancé\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency:\nJune 15Kitaki Mansion\nApollo:\n(So this is it... My first murder crime scene!)\nOfficer:\nAh, it's you kids again. Look, can't you find some other place to play...\nTrucy:\nWe're not playing! We're um, \"investigating\"! Aren't we, Apollo?\nApollo:\nSir, I have a letter of request here.\nOfficer:\nLetter of... huh? Why does it say \"Hit Request\" on it?\nApollo:\n(Ms. Tiala must have used the Kitaki's stationery...)\n???:\nExcuse me, coming through.\nOfficer:\nAh! It's you! Mr. Gavin!\nApollo:\n...! (Who's this guy...?)\n???:\nI must say I'm used to being inspected by the ladies... But this is the first time I've felt this way with a man.\nApollo:\nMr.... Gavin?\n???:\nAh, Fräulein. What is a sweet morsel like you doing in such a dismal place? Can I help?\nTrucy:\n... Y-Yes! The police man officer fellow here won't let us in! We even have a letter of request!\n???:\nYou must be exhausted, standing out here! I will take you to the scene of the crime.\nTrucy:\nOooh! R-Really!?\n???:\n...By your leave, Officer.\nOfficer:\nYa... Yes sir! Of course, sir!\n???:\nAh ha. Very well. This way, Fräulein...\nTrucy:\nWhee!\nApollo:\n... Hey! What about me!?\nJune 15People Park\n???:\n...On that note, enjoy your investigation!\nTrucy:\nThank you! Will we see you again...?\n???:\nAsk the wind, Fräulein. I'll be riding on it!\nApollo:\n...Who was that?\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeek! Apollo! Look! A c-corpse!\nApollo:\nWhaaaat!? ...Hey, it's just a mannequin.\nTrucy:\nWow. It sure got me.\n???:\nAhem. Might I ask exactly what it is you're doing here? Oh, it's you. How did you kids get in here?\nTrucy:\nOh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in...\n???:\nHim again. That glimmerous fop, always getting in my way... Anyway! This scene is off-limits.\nApollo:\nExcuse me? We have a letter of request!\n???:\n...Hmm. One moment.\nApollo:\n(Why is she holding that big magnifying glass...?)\n???:\n.............................. I'd recognize that handwriting anywhere. Scientific analysis says this was written by Alita Tiala.\nApollo:\n...Thanks. (It took you thirty minutes to figure that out!?) So... what's up with the mannequin there?\n???:\nIt's taking the place of the body, preserving the scene of the crime as it was found.\nApollo:\n(The body... was pulling the stand!?)\n???:\nSo, you're a defense attorney, are you?\nEma:\nDetective Ema Skye. I'm in charge of this crime scene.\nTrucy:\nShe doesn't seem that happy about it.\nApollo:\n...She doesn't seem that happy about many things.\nEma:\nI trust you know how to stay out of the way. I always carry two pairs of handcuffs... just in case.\nAfter clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park:\nJune 15Eldoon's House\nTrucy:\nOh, Mr. Eldoon...! Hello?\nApollo:\nLooks like he left.\nTrucy:\nAnd we found his stand and everything! What about our free bowl!?\nApollo:\nOh, too bad, looks like we'll have to wait a little longer for that bowl. So sorry.\nTrucy:\nAw, what a bummer.\nAfter clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park:\nJune 15Hickfield Clinic\nPhoenix:\nAh, you're back! Run into some problems?\nTrucy:\nOh, Polly, didn't you want to tell Daddy something?\nApollo:\nWho? Me? No! I'm fine. Really.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? So there is a problem?\nApollo:\nNo, no problem. Actually, I got a defense request.\nPhoenix:\nA defense request! That is a problem.\nApollo:\nHuh...?\nPhoenix:\nI've given up the court. I'm not a lawyer anymore.\nApollo:\n... The request was for me!\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. You're a lawyer, aren't you?\nApollo:\n(He's doing that on purpose! I know it!)\nWright Anything Agency (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic)\nApollo:\nSo this must be the \"silk top hat\" Mr. Wright mentioned. Let's take a closer look... Huh?\nTrucy:\nWhoa!\nApollo:\nYou know what this is, Trucy?\nTrucy:\nI... remember finding some in Daddy's dresser when I was little. I thought it was sugar, so I licked it... He got mad at me.\nApollo:\n(This is getting more and more suspicious...)\nWhite powder placed gingerly into pocket.\nTrucy:\nLet's go talk to that detective! She's sure to know what that white powder is!\nPeople Park (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then examining silk hat in Wright Anything Agency)\nApollo:\nUm... Does this ring any bells?\nEma:\nAh! Is that--!? It couldn't!? Where'd you get that?\nApollo:\nI brought it from the office.\nEma:\nYou... work at the Wright & Co. Law Offices, yes?\nApollo:\nEr, yeah, sort of...\nTrucy:\nDetective Skye! How do you know my daddy?\nEma:\nD-D-Daddy!? I'm sorry, who did you say you were?\nTrucy:\nTrucy Wright. Phoenix Wright's daughter.\nEma:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Wright has a daughter!?\nTrucy:\nYou seem shocked.\nEma:\nW-Well, if you're Mr. Wright's daughter and you're his apprentice... ...then I'm available to help you in any way I can!\nApollo:\nOh, uh, thanks. (You can start by not calling me Mr. Wright's apprentice!)\nEma:\nThis powder is used for detecting fingerprints.\nApollo:\nFingerprints...?\nEma:\nI guess you might call it a memento... from the time I spent with Mr. Wright.\nApollo:\n(White powder memories...)\nEma:\nIf you find any evidence with fingerprints on it, please let me know! We'll dust for prints!\nApollo:\n(Well, she's quite the eager beaver all of a sudden...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining trash can and knife:\nEma:\nSo... have you met the defendant?\nApollo:\nAh. Uh... No.\nEma:\nVisiting hours are almost over at the detention center. You might think about wrapping up here and heading over.\nApollo:\nGood idea. (I don't know what good it will do. We have a witness, and a knife with prints... Have I mentioned I've got a bad feeling about this?)\nEma:\nDon't worry, it's like a Wright tradition.\nApollo:\n(Some traditions I can live without.)\nJune 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nGuard:\nI'm sorry. Meeting hours for the day are all done.\nApollo:\nB-But we still have three minutes!\nGuard:\nI'll put in your request, but don't expect anything. The father's talking in the private room with him.\nTrucy:\nThe father? You mean like a priest?\nGuard:\nI mean the suspect's father, Mr. Winfred \"Big Wins\" Kitaki himself.\nApollo:\n(Not someone I care to meet...)\n???:\n...Die you--!!!\n???:\n...You're the one on your way out, old--!!!\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\n.........\nGuard:\nAh. They're here.\nApollo:\n(Whoa! This guy radiates power! Power.. with a cute apron?)\n???:\nYou Wocky's lawyer?\nApollo:\nY-Yes, sir!\nBig Wins:\nWell, I'm Big Wins Kitaki, fourth head of the Kitaki family... capice?\nApollo:\nEr... Actually, I came to speak to your son.\nBig Wins:\n... Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\nYes?\nBig Wins:\nMy son's innocent. He killed no one. If he were found guilty... it wouldn't be good. ...Capice?\nApollo:\nY-Yes! I'm all about capicing! Capice'd loud and clear!\nBig Wins:\nYou gotta do more than just understand to make it. You'll learn, though. Even if the lesson comes at the end of your short life.\nApollo:\n(I don't feel so good...)\n???:\nWhat's the big idea, old man!\nWocky:\nYou can't treat me like a kid no more, not now! You know I... I... I wanted to go to the clink! I like it here!\nApollo:\nYou... must be Wocky?\nWocky:\nA G's not a G till he does hard time! Bizzoooy! You'll see. When I get out of here, things'll change!\nBig Wins:\nSilence! My apologies, Mr. Justice... He's usually such a nice boy.\nApollo:\n(Forgive me if I have a hard time believing that.)\nWocky:\nHa! You can't take me under your wing this time, old man! You heard me! I don't need no trial! I did it!\nBig Wins:\n...I think that's enough for today, Mr. Justice. Don't let me down tomorrow.\nApollo:\nSo much for talking to our client.\nTrucy:\nBut we made so much progress today! We even found my panties! I had fun, at least.\nApollo:\nOf course, the biggest mystery of all remains... (How am I supposed to build a case for the trial!?)\nTrucy:\nOh, almost forgot, it's time for my show! Tonight I'm performing at the Wonder Bar! You should come check it out.\nTo be continued.June 16, 9:46 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2\nApollo:\nHuh... Mr. Wright's not here today?\nTrucy:\nHe said his old foot injury was acting up.\nApollo:\nOld injury...!? He was all smiles yesterday!\nTrucy:\nYes, he smiled when he said we'd be fine \"as long as you're there, Trucy\".\nApollo:\nYes... Fine... We'll be fine. Here comes Justice!!! I started my voice training at 5 this morning.\nTrucy:\nOooh! Do some now! I want to see! ...Er, hear!\nApollo:\nHuh? Oh, OK. ...Ahem. My name is Apollo Justice, and I'm fine!!!\nTrucy:\n...... That sounds more like a self-mantra than voice training.\n???:\n...I'm fine! I'm fine! You know what I'm saying!?\nApollo:\nAck! G-Good morning!\nWocky:\nYo, 'sup. Hit me with the guilty verdict, G! See if I care. You just hang loose and let things go with the flow. You know what I'm saying!?\nApollo:\nUh, not really.\nBig Wins:\nWocky! Don't be running your mouth like that in here!\nWocky:\nSee, that's the difference between me and you, old man. I ain't afraid of no cops. Real G's can't keep it real till they spend some hard time in the pen.\nBig Wins:\nYou have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.\nTrucy:\nSounds like they've both been voice training too, Apollo.\nApollo:\n(My worst fears realized... The trial's starting and I still haven't had a real talk with my client!)\nJune 16, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Wocky Kitaki.\nApollo:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nKlavier:\nReady to rock 'n' roll, Herr Judge.\nTrucy:\nAh! It's him! The pri--guy from yesterday! He's a prosecutor?\nApollo:\n(...It's Mr. Gavin's brother!)\nKlavier:\n...\nJudge:\nLong time no see... Prosecutor Gavin. Were you taking a leave of absence?\nKlavier:\nYou know that little band I started in my free time? Thing is, we got real popular. Hard to say \"nein\" to your fans when three of your singles go platinum, ja?\nJudge:\n...I see. To be honest, I was a little concerned. I feared that you might still be distraught over that one trial...\nKlavier:\nNot to worry, Herr Judge. I wouldn't miss this day in court for the world. It's worth even more than VIP passes to one of my concerts, ja? How could I pass up a chance to see the true strength... ...of the little boy who bested my brother?\nApollo:\n...!\nKlavier:\nIt was worth canceling a show or two.\nJudge:\nUnderstood. You may give your opening statements to the court.\nKlavier:\nBefore that, I was thinking... Is the air in this courtroom not a bit... serious?\nJudge:\nIt IS a court of law.\nKlavier:\nThat's no way to get the crowd jumping, Herr Judge.\nJudge:\nThey're not supposed to jump! This is a courtroom!\nKlavier:\nAchtung, baby! Today, we play it my way!\nApollo:\n(What's that... noise?)\nKlavier:\nSometimes you have to get on up in order to get down... to prosecuting!\nApollo:\n(This is crazy...)\nKlavier:\nThe victim... Pal Meraktis, director of the Meraktis Clinic. The scene... People Park. He was found pulling a noodle stand.\nJudge:\nWhat in the world was a doctor doing pulling a noodle stand?\nKlavier:\nYes, I believe... ...you will only find that out by asking the defendant, right here, right now. Because it's an undeniable truth that he shot the victim!\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean, undeniable?\nKlavier:\nIf you are to glare at anyone, Herr Justice, glare at the punk in the defendant's chair. His crime was witnessed quite clearly, you see.\nJudge:\n...Very well. Please admit this witness to the court.\nKlavier:\n...Nein! Not yet! First, there is a little matter to be cleaned up...\nApollo:\n(Could you talk without the accompaniment?)\nTrucy:\nI swear I could see the guitar for a second!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nThe \"motive\", Herr Judge. Why did the little punk do it? Why did he kill the director of the Meraktis Clinic?\nApollo:\nApollo:\nNot so fast! The defendant doesn't have to explain that!\nKlavier:\nOh? But what if the defendant specifically requests to do so? As he did this morning? I want to \"give a shout out to all my homeys!\" I believe he said.\nJudge:\nWhaaaaat!?\nApollo:\n(What is right!)\nTrucy:\nThey always say that, on stage, you should hit the crowd with speed and ferocity! Sounds like he got you good, huh, Polly?\nJudge:\nWell, this is highly unusual. But... The court will now hear from the defendant concerning his motive in the crime!\nJudge:\nSo... You, son, are the defendant... Wocky, are you?\nWocky:\nI ain't your son, old man! You step to a Kitaki, you best be prepared to step strong!\nKlavier:\nYou \"step\" to a public official, you'd best be prepared to step into jail.\nTrucy:\nYou got to hand it to him, Wocky sure has guts!\nApollo:\n(It's not his guts I'm worried about...)\nJudge:\nWell then, the court will now hear testimony on the defendant's motive... ...from the defendant himself!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Wocky Kitaki's \"Truth\" --\nWocky:\nI'll tell you one thing, that doctor was a quacker!\nSomeone had to show him what's what!\nI was in his clinic 'bout half a year ago. He messed up my op something bad.\nAnd then he just lets me go, without a word. See ya later, bye!\nSo I gotta go in, get another doc to patch me up again!\nThat was the day I done figured it out. No O.G.'s gonna let that pass!\nThat's why I went to his pad that night, know what I'm saying!?\nJudge:\nYou're saying you were one of the victim's patients...!?\nWocky:\nLotta stuff goes down when you're keeping it real on the street. Tru dat. I tell you one thing, that doc was wack!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well, the defense may begin the cross-examination.\nApollo:\n(I can't believe this is the first time I'm hearing about all of this...)\nCross Examination\n-- Wocky Kitaki's \"Truth\" --\nWocky:\nI'll tell you one thing, that doctor was a quacker!\nWocky:\nSomeone had to show him what's what!\nWocky:\nI was in his clinic 'bout half a year ago. He messed up my op something bad.\nWocky:\nAnd then he just lets me go, without a word. See ya later, bye!\nWocky:\nSo I gotta go in, get another doc to patch me up again!\nWocky:\nThat was the day I done figured it out. No O.G.'s gonna let that pass!\nWocky:\nThat's why I went to his pad that night, know what I'm saying!?\nApollo:\n(Unngh... This sounds bad right from the get-go.)\nTrucy:\nWell, there won't be any get-go if we don't get some more information!\nApollo:\n(Right. First, gather the facts. Time enough for despair later!)\nAfter pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems that there were issues with this doctor.\nWocky:\nMan, putting him down was like doing the world a favor!\nApollo:\nWocky! ...Please consult your lawyer before saying things like that...\nTrucy:\nChin up, Apollo! Back straight!\nJudge:\nBut, why did this mistake only come to light that day?\nKlavier:\nIt was found during the Family health check-up.\nApollo:\nThe F-Family check-up?\nWocky:\nThat was the wackest thing of all! All us G's lining up, taking eye exams 'n' all that. Better to die young than fade away, bizzzoy!\nKlavier:\n...A relief to hear.\nWocky:\nEh? Wh-What's a relief!?\nKlavier:\nOh? Did your father not tell you? That bullet you carry so close to your heart... if not attended to immediately... ...It could kill you.\nApollo:\nWh-Whaaat!?\nKlavier:\nYes, Herr Doktor Meraktis had knowledge concerning this ticking \"time bomb\" in you. Knowledge... that could have saved your life.\nWocky:\nNo way! Th-That's wacked!\nKlavier:\nThere is proof. Your check-up report.\nWocky's Check-Up Report added to the Court Record.\nKlavier:\n...How ironic that you would kill the one man capable of helping you. You're almost as careless as he was! ...Ah ha ha ha.\nWocky:\n......\nApollo:\n......\nKlavier:\nWell, now that the place is hopping... Let's get this gig started!\nJudge:\nS-Started...?\nKlavier:\nWe've had enough of a warm-up act, ja? Time to hear from the witness!\nTrucy:\n...Wocky sure is quiet all of a sudden.\nApollo:\nI'm a little uneasy myself. (Is this Gavin's strategy...?)\nKlavier:\nSo. You will tell us your name and occupation.\nStickler:\nMy name... is Wesley Stickler. By \"occupation\" I take it you refer to some labor that \"profits\" society at large, and supports a livelihood under which definition I must confess to being \"unemployed\" however, we must acknowledge the meaning of \"identity\" which is commonly attached to this notion of \"occupation\", and once we have accepted this reality, we see that our confusion is not Gestalt, per se, but derives instead from the \"vagueness\" inherent in all representations of thoug--\nKlavier:\nBy which he means to say that he is a student. A junior at Ivy University if I'm not mistaken?\nStickler:\nYes, in the Department of Science and Engineering. Filled with curiosity for all things, I spend my days in pursuit of truth, honing my...\nKlavier:\nHerr Stickler, please direct said curiosity to the case at hand today.\nJudge:\nVery well, Mr. Stickler. Please testify to the court about what you saw on the night of the crime.\nStickler:\nYou ask, quite simplistically, \"what I saw\". However, we must understand that homo sapiens possess two eyes, each of these designed to receive and interpret data, sending images in the form of signals to the...\nWitness Testimony\n-- A Night in the Park --\nStickler:\nThat night, I passed through the park on my way home from shopping... when I saw them!\nOne man, pulling a stand. Another man, facing him.\nI saw them quite clearly. The man facing the victim was the defendant.\nIn his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.\nA shot! The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead!\nJudge:\nHmm... Was there anyone else in the park at that time?\nStickler:\nI can say with 100% accuracy that there was not.\nKlavier:\nThe pistol our witness refers to... is this.\nJudge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.\nPistol added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Justice, you may cross-examine the witness.\nApollo:\n...Yes, Your Honor.\nTrucy:\n...\nApollo:\nUh... Trucy? Why are you staring like that at the witness?\nTrucy:\nThat man... I can't help but feel I've seen him somewhere before.\nApollo:\n...?\nCross Examination\n-- A Night in the Park --\nStickler:\nThat night, I passed through the park on my way home from shopping... when I saw them!\nStickler:\nOne man, pulling a stand. Another man, facing him.\nStickler:\nI saw them quite clearly. The man facing the victim was the defendant.\nStickler:\nIn his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.\nStickler:\nA shot! The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead!\nApollo:\n(He seems pretty confident in his testimony.)\nTrucy:\nWe always make the biggest mistakes when we're our most confident! He's got a weak point somewhere, Apollo! Find it!\nApollo:\n(...Right! Better give that testimony another listen.)\nApollo:\n(Whew... If that's all of it, I think I have a chance.)\nKlavier:\nIs that you... relaxing, I see, Herr Justice?\nApollo:\nHuh? Oh, er... Ahem! Objection!!!\nJudge:\n...Once is quite enough, Mr. Justice.\nTrucy:\nApollo! Pace yourself! This trial's not over yet!\nApollo:\nUrk! Eh, right! Ahem, um, look at this!\nJudge:\nThe... autopsy report? Is there a problem with the autopsy report?\nApollo:\nUm, right, a problem... Problem... problem... Yes!!! The problem is the location of the entry wound!\nJudge:\nThe location...?\nApollo:\nYou testified that the killer shot the victim \"square in the forehead\", did you not?\nStickler:\nAh, I have already determined your \"angle\" of inquiry. ...Allow me to explain. It is quite simple, really: First, understand that when I say \"square\", I speak not of geometrical absolute. What do I mean by this? For example, the defection of a \"meter\" is 1,650,763.73 times the wavelength of the light emitted by a krypton particle, as we all know. In addition, it is a well known fact that krypton particles are rare, and invisible to the naked eye, which points to a basic fallacy in your line of reasoning, namely, that wh--\nJudge:\nMr. Justice.\nApollo:\nYes?\nJudge:\nWas your objection to these, er, krypton particle things?\nKlavier:\nThis is the big time, and you are obsessed with something so small? You disappoint me.\nApollo:\nN-N-No! I'm obsessed with something big! I mean, there's a bigger, less nitpicky problem here!\nJudge:\nDo tell...\nApollo:\nJust look at the autopsy report! The location of the entry wound was... ...the right temple!\nStickler:\nT-Temple...?\nApollo:\nMr. Stickler, you said quite clearly that the victim was shot \"square in the forehead\"! That's a contradiction! ...Isn't it? (It is, right? Finally!)\nKlavier:\nKlavier:\nHerr Justice... Oh, Herr Justice...\nApollo:\nYes...?\nKlavier:\nYour tactics are outdated. Trying to shake the witness by objecting to trifles? Surely you haven't forgotten the fatal wound your master suffered seven years ago? Phoenix Wright... was it?\nApollo:\n...! Look, I know the wound was in the wrong place according to this testimony!\nStickler:\nNyurk...!\nKlavier:\nHey, Herr Forehead...\nApollo:\n...! (F... \"Forehead\"!?)\nKlavier:\nLet us imagine you are walking through the park. You see two men facing each other. One with a pistol trained on the other. ...What would you do, Herr Forehead?\nApollo:\nWell, I... I guess... I would try to stop them. I'd probably shout, \"Stop!\"\nKlavier:\nAnd you, Fräulein?\nTrucy:\nM-Me? Well... I'd probably scream, \"Eeeeeek!\"\nKlavier:\nAnd you, Herr Stickler? What did you shout, I wonder?\nApollo:\nAck...! (If the victim turned his head at the last moment...*gulp*)\nStickler:\n...Ah yes. Thank you for jogging my memory.\nJudge:\nIt sounds like an addendum to the testimony is required.\nWitness Testimony\n-- A Night in the Park 2 --\nStickler:\nAs soon as the killer raised his pistol, I took action.\n\"Cease this at once, you two!\" I cried... with composure.\nThe victim turned in the direction of my voice... and a shot rang out.\nWhereupon our cowardly killer, the defendant, appeared to have become frightened.\nTossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.\nJudge:\nI see... So you attempted to stop the crime.\nStickler:\nIndeed. ...With composure.\nTrucy:\nWell, maybe the criminal wouldn't have fired if he hadn't shouted like that.\nApollo:\nTh-That doesn't really matter now, unfortunately.\nKlavier:\nLet us consider this new testimony, shall we? ...Observe the diagram, if you would. The witness... Mr. Stickler, was it? Stood here. He shouted, \"Oh stop! Please!\" or something of this nature. And the victim responded by looking in the witness's direction! If the killer were to have fired at just that moment... As we can see, the bullet would have struck the right temple, as in the report.\nJudge:\nThat does seem to be the case.\nStickler:\nWitness the power of a Junior in Ivy University's Department of Science!\nJudge:\nVery well, Mr. Justice, you may cross-examine the witness.\nCross Examination\n-- A Night in the Park 2 --\nStickler:\nAs soon as the killer raised his pistol, I took action.\nStickler:\n\"Cease this at once, you two!\" I cried... with composure.\nStickler:\nThe victim turned in the direction of my voice... and a shot rang out.\nStickler:\nWhereupon our cowardly killer, the defendant, appeared to have become frightened.\nStickler:\nTossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.\nTrucy:\nI liked that contradiction. Kinda sad to see it go.\nApollo:\nNot as sad as I feel. What do we do now?\nTrucy:\nAt least the testimony's getting a little clearer.\nApollo:\n(She's right! Maybe I can find something to use in this new testimony.)\nApollo:\nThe record of the murder weapon is very clear about one thing: The fingerprints were \"wiped\" which means some trace of prints remained! Which contradicts your testimony! If everything happened as you say it did, he wouldn't have had time to wipe the pistol!\nStickler:\n...That may be. But it does not change what I saw. The killer... the defendant... He threw down the murderous weapon from his hand and fled.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nStickler:\nAnd this pistol was found at the scene of the crime. Strongly suggesting that this was the weapon he disposed of!\nKlavier:\nThat sounds solid to me. Well, Herr Forehead? Any of your precious \"objections\"?\nApollo:\n...\nTrucy:\nWhat gives, Apollo!? Let's see that voice training go to work!\nApollo:\nYou know, I've only recently realized something. No matter how much you train your voice, it doesn't matter if you have nothing to say.\nTrucy:\nWhat do you mean, \"nothing to say\"!? Isn't it obvious from what the witness just said?\nApollo:\nHuh? Isn't what obvious?\nTrucy:\nWhen he re-stated what he saw just now, he said he saw Wocky drop a \"murderous weapon\". But that's not the same as being 100% sure of what Wocky threw away!\nApollo:\nYou're right!\nTrucy:\nHe's just confused because a pistol was found at the scene! Poor Mr. Stickler... It must be hard to be so perfect, and yet so wrong.\nStickler:\nW-Well! It can be said that I'm quite offended! While it is, indeed, true that once, in my youth, I wrote a love letter in my own blood that was seized by the teacher and posted on the blackboard for all to see, and for this the appellation \"poor\" might as well be prefixed to my name, yet as for the issue at ha--\nJudge:\nWhat we can say for certain is that the witness saw the killer throw \"something\"... Does the defense have anything to say about this?\nTrucy:\nWell, if what he threw wasn't a pistol...\nApollo:\nThen it had to be something else!\nKlavier:\nAt least one person on the defense team seems to be thinking.\nApollo:\n(Grr... I'll wipe that smile off your pretty face, Gavin!)\nJudge:\nPerhaps you can inform the court as to the nature of this \"something else\"? What did the killer throw away before fleeing the scene?\nJudge:\nIs that... a sword? I saw one of those on the late night movie last night!\nApollo:\n(Great, a sleep-deprived judge...) This knife was found at the scene of the crime... with the defendant's prints on it.\nJudge:\nHis prints!\nApollo:\nThis single piece of evidence proves two important things: One, that what the defendant threw down wasn't a pistol. Two, that the defendant wasn't wearing gloves!\nJudge:\nHmm... Indeed!\nKlavier:\nOh, Herr Forehead? You're forgetting two other things you've just proven.\nApollo:\nHuh?\nKlavier:\nOne, that the man the witness saw was the defendant, Mr. Wocky Kitaki. Two, that the defendant was holding a knife, with the intent of harming the victim!\nApollo:\nOh.\nJudge:\nHmm... Indeed!\nApollo:\n(Grr... Never underestimate a Gavin is the lesson here.)\nJudge:\nThis court is of the opinion that our witness is fond of making assumptions. In that light, I believe it would behoove us to hear about what really occurred... ...with less assuming, please!\nStickler:\nIt is always the same with you people. \"Mark left the house on foot, and five minutes later, his brother left after him. How long would it take for Mark's brother to catch up to him... ...assuming that Mark never had to stop for a traffic light!\" \"Assuming\"... Yes, that's what I said. \"Assuming\"! As if that were a probable situation at all! Yet here you are \"assuming\" that my \"assumption\" is no better!\nJudge:\nAhem. What this court \"assumes\"... ...is that the witness will testify as to what happened after the shot was fired!\nWitness Testimony\n-- From Shot to Call --\nStickler:\nI could not prevent the killer from leaving the scene.\nNor could I simply leave the scene in good conscience.\nErgo! I used my cell phone to call the police.\nUntil the police arrived at the scene 10 minutes later, I saw no one else.\nApollo:\nWhy didn't you chase the killer?\nStickler:\nHe was, as you say, a killer. Of course, I could have run him down, yet what would he have done when cornered? Sadly, it takes more than an aptitude for solving quadratic equations to know that.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nKlavier:\nDid the testimony earlier not prove the defendant's presence at the scene? And do we not also now know that there was no one else there? ...It seems clear that we have our killer. Does it not?\nJudge:\nDoes it not, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\n(I'd better find a way to take this testimony down quick!)\nCross Examination\n-- From Shot to Call --\nStickler:\nI could not prevent the killer from leaving the scene.\nStickler:\nNor could I simply leave the scene in good conscience.\nStickler:\nErgo! I used my cell phone to call the police.\nStickler:\nUntil the police arrived at the scene 10 minutes later, I saw no one else.\nApollo:\n(This witness is way too self-assured! There's got to be a weakness somewhere in this testimony!)\nTrucy:\n...\nApollo:\nNnk...! (Argh! There's nothing fishy about that testimony at all!)\nJudge:\nIt appears there are no objections to the witness's current testimony.\nKlavier:\nThere are any number of ways to explain the lack of prints on the pistol, I assure you. Perhaps the killer really was wearing gloves which wiped the previous user's prints off. Then, after the deed was done, this fell out of his pocket as he was throwing the gun away. A mistake befitting of a small-time punk, in my opinion.\nApollo:\nNo... Nooooooooooo!\nJudge:\nIt seems we've come to the end of the line here.\nApollo:\n(No... that can't be all!)\nKlavier:\nHow unfortunate. It seems that you weren't cut out to stand on the same stage as me. Were you, Herr Forehead?\nJudge:\nI believe this brings the cross-examination to a close. This court will now declare a verdict for the defendant, Wocky Kitaki.\n???:\n???:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\nT-Trucy!?\n???:\nNobody move!\nJudge:\nWh-What's the meaning of this? Who are you!?\nKlavier:\n...\n???:\nThere'll be no verdict in this court... Not yet!\nApollo:\nWait... Are you... one of the Kitakis!?\nJudge:\nThe Kitakis!? You mean the notorious gangsters!?\n???:\nIf you don't want to see me give the pretty little girl a new smile, do as I say! Adjourn the court for twenty minutes!\nJudge:\nWh-Whaaat!? Th-This court will not bow to pressure from the likes of...\nKlavier:\n...Herr Judge.\nJudge:\n...!\nKlavier:\nI see little point in further aggravating this gentleman.\nJudge:\nUrk! Hmm...\n???:\nRecess, twenty minutes. Or I promise you, you'll regret it.\nApollo:\nW-Wait! (How'd he disappear so fast!?)\nTrucy:\n...Come to the defendant lobby, Apollo!!!...\nJudge:\n...I suppose I have no choice but to adjourn for a twenty minute recess! Bailiff! Catch that mysterious man!\nTo be continued\nJune 16, 11:17 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2\nApollo:\nTrucy! Trucy!?\n???:\n...You move quick, Apollo. Good show, good show!\nApollo:\nT...

I'm pressing charges!\nTrucy:\nWait! Just calm down, Apollo! Or else...\nApollo:\nAaaaaugh! Wh-Wh-What the heck is that!?\nTrucy:\nSurprised? This is one of my best tricks! The Amazing Mr. Hat!\nMr. Hat:\nYou look mahvelous, dahling!\nApollo:\n...\nTrucy:\nHe's a big hit on stage at the Wonder Bar!\nMr. Hat:\nYes. I am a big hit. Ha ha ha.\nTrucy:\nWell, what do you think? Do ya like it!?\nApollo:\nYou mean you... Trucy! There are some things you just don't do! I... I'm pressing charges!\nTrucy:\nApollo! Now is not the time to be threatening me! It's you who's being threatened here!\nApollo:\nHuh...?\nTrucy:\nRemember what you said to Wocky's father yesterday? You promised you'd save his son!\nApollo:\nB-But that testimony was rock solid! What are you suggesting I do?\nTrucy:\nLook, once the judge declares a verdict, it's all over. If I can use my talent to stop that from happening, I will!\nApollo:\nTrucy, no more staged abductions, please...\nTrucy:\nI'm not talking about magic, Apollo! I know when the witness isn't confident... I can perceive what he's feeling! It might not mean anything, but it's all we've got...\nApollo:\nYou can see... what he's \"feeling\"?\nTrucy:\nThink back, Apollo! Think back to the times when there was a contradiction in his testimony! All the times!\nApollo:\nAll the times there was a contradiction...?\nTrucy:\nThere were two times when he made statements he wasn't confident in. And each time, there was a contradiction.\nStickler:\nIn his hand he held.. yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.\nStickler:\nTossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.\nTrucy:\nHe said the man tossed aside a pistol... But it turned out he wasn't sure, and sure enough, there was a contradiction.\nApollo:\nWell, that's true, but how does that help us?\nTrucy:\nDidn't you notice anything? Whenever he made a statement he wasn't confident in... ...he displayed a certain habit!\nStickler:\nIn his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.\nTrucy:\nDid you see it? The very moment he said the word \"pistol\"... ...his fingers got all tense, and he fiddled with the corner of a page in his book!\nApollo:\nHow'm I supposed to see that!?\nTrucy:\nWell, I could see it. How else do you think Daddy went seven years without losing a game of poker?\nApollo:\nWha--!?\nTrucy:\nI always sat next to Daddy during big matches. I could see what his opponents were feeling!\nApollo:\nYou mean that's how Mr. Wright won all those games?\nTrucy:\nIt's not cheating, officially. I wasn't looking at their hands or anything. And I wasn't there all the time, either. Daddy's quite good at poker, after all. But not good enough to go undefeated that long!\nApollo:\nGreat, so he cheated. But what does that do for us? (I don't believe this...)\nTrucy:\nYou have to listen to his testimony one more time! No... scratch that! You have to watch his testimony! Perceive the truth!\nApollo:\n\"Watch\" a testimony? \"Perceive\" the truth? The only thing I'm perceiving is that I'm going to lose.\nTrucy:\nNot true!\nApollo:\n...!\nTrucy:\nDaddy said so. He said you have the power, Apollo.\nApollo:\nMr. Wright said that? (Watch the testimony... Perceive his true feelings... Is she serious!?)\nTrucy:\nTime's up! Sorry I can't think of any other way out of this one, Apollo.\nApollo:\n(What was that she said before the trial started?)\nApollo:\nHuh... Mr. Wright's not here today?\nTrucy:\nHe said his old foot injury was acting up. Yes, he smiled when he said we'd be fine \"as long as you're there, Trucy\".\nApollo:\n(Is this what he meant by us being \"fine\"...? Well... methods aside, she did avoid one guilty verdict already today. Time to show this court what I'm made of! Get ready for Justice!) ...Let's do it.\nTrucy:\nApollo...\nApollo:\nYou know, I'm starting to think I can do this.\nTrucy:\n...I knew you could do it all along! Oh, one more thing.\nApollo:\n?\nTrucy:\nTry to cover for Mr. Hat as best you can!\nMr. Hat:\nI just flew in from the coast, and boy are my arms tired!\nApollo:\nRight...

I'd like to say to the young lady standing next to you, Mr. Justice...\nTrucy:\nOh, you mean me?\nJudge:\nDon't you have anything to report? Anything... concerning the mysterious phantom in the silk top hat?\nApollo:\nAh! Right! Him! Don't worry about him. I settled that.\nJudge:\nYou \"settled\" that...?\nApollo:\nErm, yes, it was an... out of court settlement! Right.\nKlavier:\nPerhaps Fräulein would have us believe it was nothing more than a passing dream... ...a fantastic illusion, now you see it, now you don't. Am I right?\nTrucy:\n...I think he's on to me.\nApollo:\nI wish he would stop being so... so cool.\nKlavier:\nLet us dispense with these niceties and get straight to the matter. What are your plans for our gifted witness?\nApollo:\nR-Right... The defense would like to request another cross-examination! B-Because... Because I forgot to ask something.\nJudge:\nThere was no issue with the witness's previous testimony. I will grant your request, however. But this court will not permit stalling for time!\nApollo:\n...Understood, Your Honor.\nTrucy:\nDon't forget, Apollo! When he isn't sure about something, he has a habit of fiddling with his book!\nWitness Testimony\n-- From Shot to Call --\nStickler:\nI could not prevent the killer from leaving the scene.\nNor could I simply leave the scene in good conscience.\nErgo!

You have to focus to perceive the truth!\nApollo:\n(I'm not sure I entirely understand this just yet. But I have \"perceived\" one thing... My bracelet is reacting to his testimony... this has to be the key!)\nApollo:\nSo, you called immediately after witnessing the murder?\nStickler:\nThe police undoubtedly have a record of the call. Why not check with them?\nTrucy:\nWait, Apollo! This has to be it!\nApollo:\nWait, you mean his habit?\nTrucy:\nDon't forget, Apollo! When he isn't sure about something, he has a habit of fiddling with his book!\nApollo:\n(The only time he even had the book open was here... Which means this is the place to look for this \"habit\"!) I... don't know how I know, but I know.\nTrucy:\n...Know what?\nApollo:\nIt's my bracelet, it's different, somehow. I can feel it reacting to something about the witness!\nTrucy:\nYour... bracelet?\nApollo:\nI'm not sure I get this \"focus\" stuff you were talking about, Trucy. But... I have a feeling that trusting my bracelet is the way to go. (OK, I just need to touch my bracelet with [X / Y / R] as it reacts to the testimony...) (Changed from [OK, I just need to touch my bracelet as it reacts to the testimony...] in the original release)\nApollo:\nWh-What's going on!? (I can see the witness's face, his expression so clearly! I-It's filling my mind! I can see nothing else, hear nothing else!)\nTrucy:\nApollo?\nApollo:\nTrucy! What's happening to me!?\nTrucy:\nThis is what I meant by \"focusing\".\nApollo:\nFocusing...\nTrucy:\nIn this state, you can see everything, Apollo! Everything the witness does!\nApollo:\nTh-That's great, but this is kind of freaking me out!\nTrucy:\nJust look for Mr. Stickler's twitch -- his habit. You remember it, right?\nApollo:\nSure! When he says something he's not sure of, he fiddles with a page of his book.\nTrucy:\nYou got it! Right now, you're looking at the witness's face. ...And your eyes are sort of bugging out.\nApollo:\n(I'll bet they are.)\nTrucy:\nFirst, move your focus of attention down to Mr. Stickler's hand.\nApollo:\nHis hand...?\nTrucy:\nYou know what to look for now, but you have to be looking at the right place.\nApollo:\n(She's right. I can only see his face like this... Time to try changing my viewpoint!)\nTrucy:\nPerfect! Now you're really ready!\nApollo:\nReady... for what?\nTrucy:\nReady to perceive the truth behind the twitch!\nApollo:\nPerceive... ([Percieve] highlighted in the original release)\nTrucy:\nTry listening to the witness talk as you focus. Then watch for his habit.\nApollo:\nRight... You mean when he fiddles with the page!\nTrucy:\nThat's right! That's your signal to look closer, to perceive with [X / Y / R]! (Changed from [That's right! That's your signal to look closer, to perceive!] in the original release) Find his weak spot and I guarantee we'll be able to give him the Royal Flush!\nApollo:\nSpoken like a true poker head's daughter.\nTrucy:\nI'm a magician, thank you very much.\nApollo:\n(So I have to pay attention to his words... and his fingers!)\nTrucy:\nDon't worry if you miss it, you can always try again!\nApollo:\n(Right! Look out nervous twitch, here comes Justice!)\nApollo:\n............ (I... I saw it! Just now... I could see it!)\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Justice? Do you have something to say?\nStickler:\nA-all this b-banging of desks! I-It's quite bad for my circulation, you know.\nApollo:\nMr. Stickler... Allow me to ask you a simple question. Why did you fiddle with the page of your book just now? ...The very moment you mentioned your cell phone!?\nStickler:\nWh-Wh-What are you talking about!?\nApollo:\nI'm curious now about this cell phone of yours... Mind if I ask a few questions? (Hmm... What to ask, What to ask...)\nJudge:\nWait a minute! What is the meaning of this!?\nApollo:\nThis cell phone was found yesterday... ...in the Meraktis Clinic garage!\nJudge:\nThe Meraktis... Why, that's where the victim lived!\nStickler:\nYeeeeeerrgh! Th-That's impossible!\nApollo:\nMr. Stickler, you lied to the court, didn't you? If your cell phone is here, how could you have called the police!?\nStickler:\nWeeeeeeeeeeeeeouk!\nStickler:\nIt... It's true. I didn't have my cell phone that night. That is why it can be said that I called the police from a public pay phone.\nJudge:\nA pay phone! So you didn't call on your cell phone after all...\nApollo:\nJust where was this pay phone located, Mr. Stickler!?\nStickler:\nWell, to indicate it with a startlingly high degree of accuracy... ...it was right around here.\nJudge:\nThat's... quite a ways from the park. But... But why did you lie?\nApollo:\nThere can be only one reason. He didn't want the court to know he had lost his cell phone. Because it was found... ...in the victim's garage!\nStickler:\nWh-Wh-What are you saying!?\nApollo:\nMr. Stickler... You broke into the Meraktis Clinic garage on the night of the murder! This cell phone tells all!\nStickler:\nB-But that's ridiculous! That makes it sound like... Like I snuck into this fellow's garage to commit some crime! As though I were trying to kill him!\nJudge:\nWell, Dr. Meraktis was killed that night.\nStickler:\nW-Well y-yes, but no! This line of reasoning has to be against the rules! Yes, it's true! I lost my cell phone! But you can't prove that I lost it that night!\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Justice? If that cell phone was dropped the night of the murder... ...it does raise considerable suspicions as to a connection with the crime.\nTrucy:\nNow's your chance, Apollo! Connect Mr. Stickler to the crime!\nApollo:\nOh, he's already connected enough. I just have to prove it. (Well... Do I have a piece of evidence that can do the job? Can I prove the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder?)\nApollo:\nThe evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:\nJudge:\nThat's... a side-view mirror?\nApollo:\nAs it so happens... Dr. Meraktis's car was in an accident... ...that took place the night of the murder!\nStickler:\nAn accident!?\nApollo:\nAn accident. It happened a little after 9 PM, just outside People Park... our murder scene. Dr. Meraktis's car hit a pedestrian!\nStickler:\nWh-What are you trying to say?\nApollo:\nFrom the absence of a mirror, it's clear that the car was parked after the accident. Which means it was parked there after 9 PM on the night of the murder. If your cell phone had been dropped before the car was parked in that garage... ...then it would have been crushed. After all, it was lying on the ground, right under the wheel!\nStickler:\nUrk...\nApollo:\nErgo, Mr. Stickler! The only time you could have dropped this in that garage... ...was after 9 PM the night of the murder in the park!\nStickler:\nWeeeeeeeeoooorrgh!\nApollo:\nMr. Stickler! You know what this means? You did break into the victim's garage that night.\nJudge:\nThis is most unexpected! Mr. Justice... Are you naming the witness as a suspect in the murder of Pal Meraktis!?\nStickler:\nN-No, stop! This is too much! This can't be happening! P-P-P-P-Prosecutor! Say something!\nKlavier:\nI suppose it is worth saying this: No connection has been found between Wesley Stickler and Pal Meraktis. That is, other than this.\nJudge:\nI believe our next testimony will be most... revelatory. Is the witness prepared?\nStickler:\nY-Y-Yes, Your Honor!!!\nApollo:\n(I know that face... That's the face of guilt!)\nTrucy:\n...\nWitness Testimony\n-- Stickler's \"Truth\" --\nStickler:\nThat night... Yes! I went to the supermarket.\nI must have dropped my cell phone on my way back.\nAnd when I was walking through the park, I happened to witness the crime!\n...I saw the killer, the victim, the stand... all as clear as day!\nIt was him! I saw the defendant at the scene!\nJudge:\nYes... but your cell phone was lying in a garage.\nStickler:\nAh, yes, well, as you can see my model of cell phone has a defect... It is given to rolling! It's quite a pain when I drop it alongside the road, you know.\nJudge:\n...Looks like a normal cell phone to me. In any case, Mr. Justice, the cross-examination, please.\nApollo:\n(That's funny... My bracelet didn't react at all during that testimony.)\nTrucy:\nHis nervous habit must not be acting up... I didn't sense anything either, actually. Looks like you're on your own this time around!\nApollo:\n(Right, no problem... I hope. Here comes Justice!)\nCross Examination\n-- Stickler's \"Truth\" --\nStickler:\nThat night... Yes! I went to the supermarket.\nStickler:\nI must have dropped my cell phone on my way back.\nStickler:\nAnd when I was walking through the park, I happened to witness the crime!\nStickler:\n...I saw the killer, the victim, the stand... all as clear as day!\nStickler:\nWhy, I even remember the sign on the stand the victim was pulling! It said \"NOODLE\"!\nStickler:\nIt was him! I saw the defendant at the scene!\nTrucy:\nHis habit isn't acting up... which means he isn't lying.\nApollo:\n(Hmm... I was kind of relying on my bracelet to get me through this one...)\nTrucy:\nBut he's pretty unsettled! The odds are really high that you can get something out of him!\nApollo:\nThat gleam in your eyes... You're a gambler's daughter through and through.\nTrucy:\nI'm a magician, thank you very much!\nApollo:\nAnd you're absolutely sure the sign read \"NOODLE\"?\nStickler:\nWhy, just last week, my professor offered me this praise: \"At least you have good eyesight, Stickler. I'll give you that.\" ...It read, without a doubt, \"NOODLE\".\nApollo:\nI see...\nStickler:\nWhat? Why are you looking at me like that? Is that... pity I see in your eyes!?\nApollo:\nLet's take a look at our map, shall we? So, you're claiming that when you saw the sign, you were standing... Here, was it? ...Although, it would've been a bit hard to read the sign from this spot.\nStickler:\nY-You think so?\nApollo:\nMr. Stickler. I'd like you to please take another look at the stand. ...and to carefully read what the sign says. See? That sign actually states the name of the stand's owner. ...\"ELDOON'S\".\nStickler:\nE... El... Eld... Inconceivable! I'm certain it was definitely \"NOODLE\" for sure! Positive!\nJudge:\nI'm afraid your professor was wrong about that eyesight.\nApollo:\nI wouldn't be so quick to jump to that conclusion. (The sign he saw changes everything!) The witness says the sign said \"NOODLE\"...\nApollo:\nWhat would you say if I told you... ...that there is one spot from which the sign would be read the way Mr. Stickler claims?\nStickler:\nWhat...?\nJudge:\nMr. Justice! Show us this spot!\nApollo:\nThe witness actually viewed the stand from this location!\nApollo:\nThe witness was standing... Here! On the opposite side!\nJudge:\nH-How do you know that?\nApollo:\nWhen viewed from the south... ...the sign on the stand reads \"ELDOON'S\", as we know. ...However! Observe the other side of the stand!\nJudge:\nOh! This side says \"NOODLE\"!\nApollo:\nExactly! The name of the stand is split between the front and back signs! Mr. Stickler, you lied to the court! You witnessed the crime from the northern side of the park, not the south!\nStickler:\nYeeeow! Y-You got me!\nKlavier:\nKlavier:\n...So what.\nApollo:\nS-So what!?\nKlavier:\nWhat does it matter if he saw the killing from the north or the south side? It makes no difference at all!\nStickler:\nH-He's right! Travel far enough to the south, and you will end up going north! Viewed on a global scale, directions are utterly without meaning!\nApollo:\n(...Actually, maybe he's right. What does it change?)\nTrucy:\nIt changes everything, Apollo!\nApollo:\nTrucy?\nTrucy:\nRemember his testimony from before... Though to be honest, I'm a little scared of where this is leading... The killer and the victim are facing each other here. Then, at the moment the killer raises his weapon... ...Mr. Stickler shouts! At which point, the victim turns his head to look... ...and the killer fires his pistol. That's why the bullet hit him in the right temple. No contradictions, right?\nApollo:\nRight... But if Mr. Stickler was standing on the north side of the park... ...that reverses the whole scenario!\nTrucy:\nCompletely! If Mr. Stickler shouts from where he is now... ...and the victim looks in his direction... ...the bullet would have to hit his left temple!\nJudge:\nAh... Aaaaah!\nTrucy:\nIn other words, someone standing at point \"K\"... ...couldn't shoot the victim in his right temple. It's impossible!\nJudge:\nTh-That's right!\nTrucy:\nSo, now that we know that Mr. Stickler was standing on the northern side... ...the wound location takes on an entirely different meaning!\nKlavier:\nIndeed... You are absolutely correct, Fräulein.\nJudge:\nWh... What meaning!?\nTrucy:\nThe entry wound was on the right side of the victim's head, correct? Well, the right side of the victim's head... is north.\nJudge:\nNorth... Ah!!! But that's where the witness, Wesley Stickler was standing!\nTrucy:\nCorrect. So, if he was standing to the north... ...then the only person here who could have shot the victim in the right temple... ...was Mr. Stickler himself!\nStickler:\nYeeeeeeeeeeeeooooooowwwrgh!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!\nApollo:\n(Wow... The apple didn't fall far from the tree! She's flipped this whole case on its head while I was still figuring it out!)\nKlavier:\nKlavier:\n...Clarify one point for me if you would, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\nWhat now?\nKlavier:\nAre you truly accusing this college student... ...of murder?\nApollo:\n...! (Well, I can't say he exactly looks innocent... But... something still doesn't feel right. I just can't picture him as the real killer!)\nStickler:\nNo, please! Looks aside, I'm really a nice guy! All my friends say so!\nJudge:\nLet's hear what the defense has to say.\nApollo:\n(What are you going to do now, Justice!? Should I really accuse Mr. Stickler!?)\nApollo:\n(...I don't think Wesley Stickler is a killer. But he's not innocent, either! His unusual silence tells me that much...) ...Mr. Stickler! You seem unusually quiet... Tell us why, now!\nStickler:\n... Th-The word \"confession\" isn't in my dictionary!\nKlavier:\nTsk, tsk, tsk, Herr Forehead. I'm afraid it falls to you to elucidate Herr Stickler's silence.\nJudge:\nMr. Justice, you did say you were accusing the witness just now... ...for a crime other than murder. Your reason? The court's all ears.\nApollo:\n(Gah! I know he's guilty of something... but what crime other than murder is there? Do I have evidence that shows his involvement in some other crime...?)\nJudge:\nYour evidence? The court's all eyes, Mr. Justice. Show us evidence that points to the witness's involvement in a crime!\nApollo:\nThe evidence... is this!\nJudge:\nWhat!? Is that... women's underwear!?\nTrucy:\nHey! Those are mine!\nStickler:\nD-Don't look at me like thaaaaaaat!!!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!! ...Mr. Stickler. While I can't say this comes as a shock...\nStickler:\nI-It's not what it seems! By Pythagorilla's Theorem, I swear it!\nApollo:\nOn the night of the murder, just past 9 PM... A young girl catches a panty-snatcher red-handed! Bravely, she gives chase, but the snatcher flees... ...and hides himself in no other place than the Meraktis Clinic garage!\nJudge:\nAh ha!\nApollo:\nIncidentally... ...these panties were found in the exhaust pipe of the car there. Presumably, he was trying to hide the evidence of his crime. Ergo! While you may not be a murderer... ...you are guilty of panty-snatching in the first degree!\nStickler:\nPlease! Here me out! It's not what it looks like!!!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!! Mr. Stickler. You should be ashamed!\nStickler:\nIt's... not... what... it... seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... ...eeeeeeeeeeeeeems... *gasp*\nJudge:\nSo, are we to understand that you were silent not because you were guilty of murder... ...but because you lacked the courage to admit your theft of this girl's undergarments?\nStickler:\nAhem. Perhaps you are not aware that my school's name was originally written \"IV\"! \"I\" stands for \"Intelligent\", \"V\" stands for \"Valiant\"! See!?\nJudge:\n...Your point?\nStickler:\nI'm not done! Now, I'm a major in the Science Department... ...and what does science teach if not curiosity!? Yes, we of the Ivy U. Science Department are valiantly curious! No challenge is too daunting, and what greater challenge to science than a mystery!?\nApollo:\nApollo:\nC'mon! You're talking about a girl's panties here!\nStickler:\nNo! You do not understand! A mystery is the unknown, and the unknown is unacceptable! And, my friends, when it comes to mysteries, those panties are the promised land! From the moment I first laid eyes on them, I was compelled to investigate... for science! A full-sized car tire was only the first mystery those panties revealed!\nApollo:\nA... tire?\nStickler:\nYes! I saw her do it! She pulled a tire out of those panties! But that's not all! First, there was the tire, then a stewpot, and a frozen chicken! One mystery after another! It was... It was magic!\nTrucy:\nOh, I remember now! He's one of the regulars in the audience at the Wonder Bar!\nApollo:\nHuh...?\nTrucy:\nHe's talking about my Magic Panties trick!\nStickler:\nI just don't understand... A broom... from a pair of panties? It mocks the very laws of physics...\nApollo:\nA broom... and a frozen chicken, Trucy? What ever happened to doves and bunny rabbits?\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Stickler! You stole this girl's panties to understand a magic trick?\nStickler:\nYou say \"panties\" but they are so much more than that! For me, they are an object for serious study!\nKlavier:\n...I wonder... There has been a recent rash of panty-snatchings in the area... ...Were they all you?\nStickler:\nI... I am sorry. But I did it for science! Each time I spied a pair of panties flapping in the breeze, I thought maybe! Maybe this would be the pair that would elucidate the mystery... Even that night as she chased me through the streets, I wept tears of joy! Perhaps this is the night that I will seize the truth that lies within those panties! Yet woe was I! For once again the lacy heart-patterned truth slipped through my fingers a--\nJudge:\nStill, that leaves one thing unexplained.\nKlavier:\nAh, you refer to our witness's other lie, yes? The witness claimed he saw the crime from the south, but was in fact, in the north.\nJudge:\nIndeed. Would anyone care to explain why he lied about that?\nStickler:\n...\nKlavier:\nBe my guest, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\n...Me!?\nKlavier:\nDid I not hear you correctly? Did you not say you \"do not accuse the witness of murder\"?\nApollo:\n...!\nKlavier:\nWhy, then, did the witness lie about his location at the time of the shooting? ...Or have you no idea?\nTrucy:\nApollo... There's something about the way the diagram is arranged right now... When you think about it, right near where Mr. Stickler was standing... Isn't there a...?\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Justice? What say you? Do you have any evidence to show why the witness lied about his location?\nApollo:\nThe evidence that shows why he lied... is this.\nJudge:\nWhat!? More panties!?\nKlavier:\nHow many panties are you carrying in your pocket, Herr Forehead?\nApollo:\nThese are the last!! Honest!! These were found in a trash can at the park. Looking at the diagram... ...we can see that the trash can was right next to where the witness stood.\nJudge:\nMr. Stickler... You didn't...\nStickler:\nAlas! I'm a failure as a scientist! I can't unravel the mysteries of the universe! I can't even unravel a pair of panties!\nJudge:\nSo... these panties are your handiwork as well...?\nStickler:\nTh... That night, I had been chased, hounded into the Meraktis Clinic garage... Weeping in frustration, I was forced to abandon my prize! Don't you see how I felt!?\nApollo:\n...Believe me, I'd rather not.\nStickler:\nI hid in the garage for a short while... Then, abandoning the panties, I made for home. To avoid the office where the girl works, I went towards the south entrance... ...when I saw them hanging there on a clothesline by a giant mansion... ...A giant pair of panties!\nApollo:\n(Apparently he didn't know those bloomers belonged to the mob...)\nStickler:\nI had them, safe in my pocket, ready to take home... ...when I stumbled upon a murder.\nApollo:\nThe murder of Dr. Meraktis.\nStickler:\nI reported what I had seen, but as I waited for the police to arrive... I got scared. What if they searched me!?\nApollo:\nThat's when you disposed of the bloomers?\nStickler:\nYes... it was a severe blow to the progress of science, but one that had to be borne. (Changed from [Yes... it was a severe blow to the progress of science, but one that had to be born.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nA fascinating, if disturbing tale.\nJudge:\nI believe this brings today's proceedings to a close. And I'm more than pleased to dismiss this witness for the remainder of the trial.\nKlavier:\nOne last thing, if I might.\nJudge:\nYes, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nRegardless of where we ended today, some vital points were made. Namely, that the defendant, Wocky Kitaki, was at the scene of the crime. And... he was pointing a weapon at the victim. ...One more thing. Wocky Kitaki has a clear motive.\nJudge:\nIndeed, the defendant Wocky Kitaki is still the prime suspect in this case. The only suspect, in fact. Assuming there was no one else on the scene at the time. Yet, a mystery remains... The location of the wound in the victim's right temple has yet to be explained. The court requests further investigation from both the defense and prosecution.\nKlavier:\n...Ja, baby.\nApollo:\n...No problem!\nJudge:\nVery well. This brings the trial for the day to a close. Court is adjourned!\nTo be continued.",

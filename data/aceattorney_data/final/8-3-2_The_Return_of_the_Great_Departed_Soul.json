  "previousContext": "Episode III\nThe Return of the Great Departed Soul\nAnime cutscene\nThe grand, end-of-the-century Great Exhibition of London - surely, there is not a soul who has failed to hear of it. Wondrous new works of culture and industry from every corner of the globe had converged on Hyde Park. Welcoming over fifty million visitors, the last great hurrah of this century astonished and delighted people of all nations, and ended on a note of resounding success. But, as regards to the terrible catastrophe that occurred during the festivities, very few are aware my friend, Mr Herlock Sholmes, had a hand in unravelling the matter. For, from the shadows, it was he who earnestly unearthed the facts of the case. And like the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, which rose high into the skies of Hyde Park, Sholmes's brilliant deductions - as clear and lofty as the Crystal Tower itself - brought the truth to light.\nRendered dialogue\nWe're here at the showground of the Great Exhibition, which is absolutely packed with people... The weather is unusually fine, and we're about to witness a most extraordinary scientific experiment!\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the twentieth century will see steam engines and electrical power dominate the world! Horse-drawn carts will give way to the motor car! Ships will sprout wings and take to the skies! And today, we showcase even more advanced technology! A glimpse into the future! A world first! A demonstration of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! A man will literally be disassembled by a pulse of high-voltage electricity, and beamed to another location... ...whereupon his body will be reassembled by a series of complex calculations exactly as it was before! In but a few moments from now... ...this gentleman will, in the blink of an eye, complete an incredible journey through the air... ...to arrive an instant later, on the Crystal Tower behind you!\n22nd October, 9:36 a.m.\nSholmes's Suite\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nIris:\n...Runo! Runo, are you listening?\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Sorry, um...what was that, Iris?\nIris:\nHmph. What's the matter with you? You've been miles away all morning. Didn't you like what I cooked for breakfast?\nRyunosuke:\nNo no, that's not it at all. Um...what were we talking about again?\nIris:\nToday's paper! It's full of news about the Great Exhibition again!\nRyunosuke:\nAh yes...the Great Exhibition... I'd like to go sometime. .........\nIris:\nYou're really not your usual self today. You seem very down. Don't you agree, Hurley?\nSholmes:\nHm...? Did you say something? Iris?\nIris:\nOh gosh! You're even more down!\nSholmes:\n......... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Wh-When did you arrive, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nI've...been here for about half an hour already. We had breakfast together.\nSholmes:\nWhat?! Why didn't you mention it before?\nRyunosuke:\nI, um...thought you might have known I was here. You know, because...breakfast?\nSholmes:\nHm, Iris is quite right. You're clearly lacking in vim. So much so that I didn't notice your presence.\nRyunosuke:\n(...Thanks.)\nSholmes:\nOf course, I could deduce the reason perfectly well with some simple observations.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?!\nSholmes:\nLet's see... Yes, for example, your tussled hair this morning, with all its unruly spikes. Clearly it can be deduced therefore, that-\nRyunosuke:\nUm, let me stop you there, Mr Sholmes, because I think I can see where this is going. My hair always looks like this. It always has. Ever since we first met, in fact.\nSholmes:\nOh really? How interesting. It just doesn't look like a haircut as such, I suppose. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!\nRyunosuke:\n(...Thanks again.) ......... It crossed my mind recently...that it's been six months now.\nIris:\nSix months?\nRyunosuke:\nSince I was forbidden from working in court. So I've been wondering how much longer I'm going to be banned.\nIris:\nOh... Well, that would explain why you seem rather glum. Don't you agree, Hurley?\nSholmes:\nHm...? Did you say something? Iris?\nRyunosuke:\n(Ah...back to moping...)\nRyunosuke:\nWhat's the matter with Mr Sholmes today? He seems even more down in the dumps than me.\nIris:\nI know! And the Great Exhibition has opened! You'd think he'd be excited. Oh, why don't we all go to see it together?\nSholmes:\nI want to! Of course I do! But I can't! ...Not for the time being.\nRyunosuke:\nWhy not?\nSholmes:\nWhy not? Why not?! Because! I'm a great detective, after all!\nRyunosuke:\n(So you're embroiled in some tricky case that you can't be distracted from? Is that it?)\nIris:\nI don't remember hearing that you're working on a case, Hurley.\nSholmes:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n(I suppose I should try to find out what's going on.)\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nSholmes:\nWell, I must be leaving now.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, understood. See you later, Mr Sholmes!\nSholmes:\nHah! You really are a shameless liar sometimes, my dear fellow!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nSholmes:\nYou seek to put me off my guard and follow me, don't you? Well, you would be wasting your time.\nRyunosuke:\nThe thought hadn't crossed my mind! (But now I'm wondering where you're going...)\nSholmes:\nAh ha ha ha hah! Well then, 'see you later' indeed!\nRyunosuke:\n(Listen to him. He's still laughing on his way out of the door...)\nIris:\nAlright then, Runo! Let's get going!\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Um, Iris... What are you wearing?\nIris:\nI've got changed to go to the Great Exhibition. You're going to take me!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat? But, but I was just about to go to the Supreme Court...\nIris:\nOh! Well that sounds fun, too! You're going to take me there, then!\nRyunosuke:\nAlright, fine. Just...lower that weapon, would you?\nIris:\nOf course! And after the Supreme Court, then we'll go to see the Great Exhibition!\n22nd October\nNaruhodo's Legal Consultancy\n22nd October\nBritish Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office\nRyunosuke:\nIt's been about six months now since I was last here. But some things never change. Like the sense of foreboding I always seem to feel in this place. (It doesn't seem to be bothering Iris at all, though. She's happily reading over there...)\nIris:\nOh, I love this place! I always find so many interesting books here!\nRyunosuke:\nOf course. I was forgetting that you've been here before. (The time we came here six months ago... ...when Susato-san was given the news that she was to return to Japan.)\n???:\nAh. I understand you wish to speak with me.\nRyunosuke:\nOh! L-Lord Stronghart! I trust you've been k-keeping well?\nStronghart:\nLet's see... Since you've arrived and requested an audience, it's been four hours, thirty-two minutes and... ...twenty-six seconds. I've kept you waiting a while. My apologies.\nRyunosuke:\nOh no, not at all! I like nothing more than standing around, staring into space.\nStronghart:\n...Good to know.\nRyunosuke:\n(...Good to know that doesn't appear to bother him at all.) Mael Stronghart, Lord Chief Justice of London. He's the man who allowed me to start practising as a defence lawyer when I arrived in Britain as a student. You need only savour the air for a moment in this grand office to understand his pre-eminent status.\nStronghart:\nAs you will be aware, the Great Exhibition of London is now underway at last. We're extremely busy as a result. Policing the grounds, guarding the new technologies, dealing with petty crime... And furthermore, as of next month, we shall open the International Forensic Science Symposium.\nRyunosuke:\nOh...I've not heard about that.\nStronghart:\nInvestigating authorities from forty countries around the globe will be taking part. Including from your own land. Forensic science is the future! The world must embrace it! As we're the hosting nation, I have much to do. And it is my highest priority. If others must wait for my attention as a result, so be it.\nRyunosuke:\n(...Well, it's nice to know where I stand.)\nStronghart:\nSo...you wish to consult with me? Of course, I can very well imagine what this is about.\nRyunosuke:\nAh...well, um... Thank you for agreeing to this meeting, My Lord! (I want to be allowed to start working as a defence lawyer again in court. That's what brought me here today. But actually, there's something else playing on my mind, as it happens...)\nIris:\nRuno, just take a deep breath and come out with it!\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nStronghart:\nWell, I must be leaving for my next engagement. I'm already...eleven hours and sixteen minutes late. ...My colleagues may be starting to fidget.\nRyunosuke:\nE-Eleven hours late? That's...quite something.\nStronghart:\nThat meeting had already started when I arrived back here for this engagement with you. So lateness was inevitable. Time stops for no man.\nRyunosuke:\n(I'm sure it stopped for me during those twelve solid arguments and two hundred and twenty-three reasons...) Oh, yes! Where would I find Lord van Zieks now?\nStronghart:\nI would assume he's at his office.\nRyunosuke:\n(Right, I'll go and ask him about the attack in person. I want to get this straight from the horse's mouth...)\nStronghart:\nAway with you now. I'm leaving Professor Harebrayne's defence entirely in your hands.\nRyunosuke:\nOf, of course, yes! Thank you very much, My Lord!\n22nd October\nProsecutor's Office\nIris:\nOoh! So this is the legendary Reaper's office?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, it appears so.\nIris:\nBrrr, it sends a chill down your spine, doesn't it? What an amazingly deathly atmosphere!\nRyunosuke:\n...Oh, is that...? (That hooded figure was so still, I hadn't noticed his or her presence. I wonder who it is...?)\n???:\nWhat are you doing here?\nRyunosuke:\nAgh!\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n(He's as unwelcoming as I thought he'd be. Actually, maybe even more so...) Oh, I, um... I'm glad to see you're well.\nVan Zieks:\n...I am.\nRyunosuke:\n......... So...who's the person over by the wall being...punished for something or other?\nVan Zieks:\nNo punishment is taking place here.\nRyunosuke:\nOh.\nVan Zieks:\nThat's my apprentice. And he's sitting there of his own free will.\nRyunosuke:\nI didn't know you had an apprentice. (It must be the same person who was pictured in the newspaper...)\nVan Zieks:\nHe's very able in combat. ...A requisite skill for anyone under my tutelage.\nRyunosuke:\nAre you referring to the attack on the Reaper that was reported in the papers?\nVan Zieks:\nThe Reaper? I'd be interested to know the Reaper's true identity myself. Assuming, that is, such a fabled fiend genuinely inhabits our great courtrooms...\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nVan Zieks:\nAh yes, there's something I've been meaning to ask you...\nRyunosuke:\nOh! What's that?\nVan Zieks:\nThat Nipponese man. Is he faring well?\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nVan Zieks:\nThe one arrested twice in succession six months ago. With the stoop. And the moustache. And the jitters.\nRyunosuke:\nAh! Mr Natsume, you mean?\nIris:\n...I'm not sure he'd be very pleased to find out you identified him from that list, Runo.\nRyunosuke:\nHe's fine, thank you. In fact, I received a letter from him by international post only the other day.\nVan Zieks:\nI see. ......... Well, I think we can end our discussion there, don't you? There's little time left before tomorrow's trial. I advise you to spend it investigating the case.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, thank you for the advice. And for the conversation. (I can't believe he's asking after Soseki-san. After a 'Nipponese'! I'm not sure whether to feel happy about that or worried.)\nIris:\nI never imagined that Mr Reaper would be friends with a mad scientist, did you? That's a turn-up for the books!\nRyunosuke:\nA mad scientist? Ah, you mean Professor Harebrayne? (Yes, it might be worth quizzing the professor about his relationship with Lord van Zieks, I think.)\n22nd October\nLocal Prison, Cell 11\nRyunosuke:\nThe warden said cell eleven. That's this one...\nIris:\nOh! There's someone curled up in a ball in the back corner, look!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat's his name again? Professor Albert Harebrayne, wasn't it? ...Um, excuse me! Professor Harebrayne!\nHarebrayne:\n...! Who are you?\nRyunosuke:\nI'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a defence lawyer.\nHarebrayne:\nA LAWYER!\nRyunosuke:\nAgh! (Was it something I said?!)\nHarebrayne:\nA, a lawyer, you say? W-W-W-Would you be here... a-a-a-about the experiment? ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND MY HYPOTHESIS?!\nRyunosuke:\nYour...hypothesis? Sorry, I don't-\nHarebrayne:\nYesterday's demonstration! That demonstration was... That magnificent demonstration was... It was an out-and-out success! By anyone's calculations! B-B-B-But despite that... ...no one listens! No lawyer believes in the science! When it's explained, they all leave...at high velocity! Haah...\nRyunosuke:\n......... (Now's probably not a good time to mention that your zeal made my concentration leave for a while, too...)\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nRyunosuke:\nSo, Professor, let me just make absolutely sure I've understood you properly. The huge explosion that occurred yesterday... That was an accident, you're saying? You had no intent to harm the victim, who was in fact the sole investor in your work. Is that correct?\nHarebrayne:\nAs correct as two squared is four! I swear it! Yes, it's true that the man perished in a machine of my invention. So I know that I'm far from blameless in all this. But still! I would never use my discoveries, my inventions, to take a person's life! Not in a centillion years! I'm a man of science! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Do you believe me? Do you believe in my hypothesis? Science is the pursuit of truth, you know. I've always believed that. All my life!\nRyunosuke:\n......... I'm afraid I don't know much about science. Or your theories. But I do believe you. And I will fight to prove your innocence with all my might. I'm a man of the law! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please!\nHarebrayne:\n......... When I went to live in Germany after I graduated, I learnt something very important. Nationality, class, lineage...none of that matters. As long as you try your hardest, you can achieve anything.\nRyunosuke:\nThank you for that, Professor.\nHarebrayne:\nAnd thank you in advance for defending me tomorrow in court!\nIris:\nAlright, Runo, it's time! Time to visit the Great Exhibition!\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nIris:\nWell, that's where the incident happened, isn't it?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I suppose that's true. (Time to investigate at last!)\n22nd October\nThe Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower\nRyunosuke:\nUgh... The showgrounds are a little too big for my liking... We've been walking around in dense crowds for two hours now, and I've felt myself swooning three times.\nIris:\nThere are a lot of people, aren't there? I've almost been trodden on three times, too!\nRyunosuke:\n...Be careful, won't you, Iris? Don't let go of my hand. (We've finally made it through the throngs though, by the look of it. Here we are underneath the public experimentation stage where the explosion happened yesterday.)\n???:\n.........!\n???:\n.........!\nRyunosuke:\n(What's that...? I can hear voices from up on the stage. It sounds like an argument...)\n???:\nRight, I've had it with you this time! I'm warnin' you, I'll arrest you in a minute!\n???:\nOh yeah? Go on then, 'Spector, give it a shot! You ain't got no evidence, an' you know it!\nRyunosuke:\n(Wait... I know those voices.)\n???:\nYou've got a cheeky little mouth on you, young lady! But a night in the cells will teach you some manners!\n???:\nJust try it, I dare ya! If ya want that bag o' chips rammed down yer throat!\nIris:\nYoo-hoo! Gregsy! What are you doing up there?\nGregson:\n......... Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! It's you! Here! You're here! Here you are! You! Here! Your Ladyshiiip! How are you, Your Ladyship? I do hope you're well, Your Ladyship?\nRyunosuke:\n(...Does that make her three times a lady?)\nIris:\nI'm not well at all. It's far too busy everywhere. I wanted to ride in a balloon, but there was a three-hour queue.\nGregson:\nUnbelievable! I'll go an' have a word for you at once, Your Ladyship! You'll be flyin' as high as a kite in no time once I pull some strings for you!\nRyunosuke:\nTobias Gregson, an inspector at Scotland Yard. Until recently, he was suspended from duty, but it would appear he's back in action now. He's actually quite well known, appearing as he does in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. And for that reason, he can't say a word wrong to the stories' author, Iris. (But there are limits, surely... Or there should be!)\nGregson:\nWatch it, sunshine!\nRyunosuke:\nS-Sorry...\nGregson:\nWhat gives, then? Don't tell me you're on this case?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I'm acting for the defence.\nIris:\nSo we're here to investigate!\nGregson:\nHmmm... Dear me, that's the situation, is it?\nRyunosuke:\n(Is it really that troubling?)\n???:\nTsk. A measly five bob? Is that all ya got? Yer a lawyer, ain't ya? Ya could stand to carry a bit more copper around in yer pockets, Mr Narra-'Oddo!\nRyunosuke:\nWha...? Hey! That's my last bit of spending money, that is!\n???:\nYa can 'ave it back, but I'll 'ave to charge ya for all the bother. Three bob.\nRyunosuke:\nThis is Gina Lestrade, a pickpocket, or 'diver', born and bred in the East End of London. In the case that led to my own suspension six months ago... ...this is the young girl I was defending in court.\nGina:\nWot's yer problem, eh, 'Oddo?! 'Diver'? Pickpocket? Wot's wiv all the name-callin'? You wanna bag o' chips rammed down yer throat an' all, do ya?\nRyunosuke:\nI, I thought you were proud to be a diver, Gina? You were just arguing with Inspector Gregson about it, weren't you? I assumed you'd been up to your usual tricks here at the showground.\nGina:\nThat ain't no way to talk to a lady, 'Oddo. 'Alf a year's a long time. People can change. I'm an apprentice now. Learnin' to be a Scotland Yard detective. So you'll 'ave to call me wot everyone else does: It's Inspector Lestrade now!\nRyunosuke:\nIn... Inspector?! (That badge is homemade, surely...)\nGregson:\nThe 'inspector' part isn't entirely accurate. No one calls her that. For what it's worth, anyway. Investigatin' is off the cards for all of us.\nIris:\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\nGregson:\nRight, well, I'll be back up top. You hold the fort down here, alright?\nGina:\nRight...sir.\nRyunosuke:\n(This... This raises a LOT of questions!)\nAfter clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage:\nIris:\nRuno, Runo, listen!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat? What is it?\nIris:\nI've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he?\nRyunosuke:\nAbout what?\nIris:\nAbout Mr Reaper!\nRyunosuke:\n...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he?\nIris:\nHere, this is what you need!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me?\nIris:\nYou don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like?\nRyunosuke:\nNo no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow!\nIris:\nBut that's where Hurley is.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat? At, at this popular London attraction?\nIris:\nYes!\nRyunosuke:\nHow is it that you know where he is?\nIris:\nHurley told me. But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo.\nRyunosuke:\nMadame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.)\n22nd October\nThe Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage\nRyunosuke:\nSo that's it, is it? The machine that blew up.\nIris:\nOoh, it must have been a magnificent explosion! And I've seen my fair share.\nRyunosuke:\nYou've seen things like this before, you mean?\nIris:\nOf course! Hurley's always doing experiments that end in a bang. In fact, in his own words, 'Explosions are the very essence of chemistry!'\nRyunosuke:\nAh...that might explain the smell of burning that frequently comes wafting up the stairs.\nIris:\nOne time, he made something that exploded with such force, it took the roof off the building! I wish you'd been there to see it, Runo!\nRyunosuke:\n...It's hard to get too excited about that...given that I now live in the roof.\nIris:\nWell anyway, that's enough about that. It's time to investigate!\nRyunosuke:\nAh look, Inspector Gregson is over there. He seems to be deep in thought about something... whilst eyeing up the machine carefully.\nIris:\nReally? He just looks confused to me.\nRyunosuke:\nIt ripped itself apart magnificently, didn't it?\nIris:\nMagnificently...and mercilessly.\nRyunosuke:\nSo someone stands in the middle of the machine to be disassembled and then 'beamed' through the air...\nIris:\nYes, 'beamed' not 'blasted'. That's the point.\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes, that part's crucial, really.) Is something like that even possible, though, Iris?\nIris:\nOh, Runo. I'm just a child. How should I know?\nRyunosuke:\n(A child when it suits you, you mean...)\nIris:\nFrom what I can tell, I think if you were to pull this lever here-\nGregson:\nSTOOOOOOOOOOOOP! Don't touch that!\nIris:\nAh ha ha! That was practically instantaneous kinesis the way you flew over just now, Gregsy!\nGregson:\nPlease, Your Ladyship... I didn't mean to startle you, but I can't let you touch anything up here.\nIris:\nSo sorry. You can have some of my latest special blend to make up for it.\nGregson:\n*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! Wonderful! This stuff really is wonderful!\nRyunosuke:\n(It's just like old times, this is...) We're representing Professor Harebrayne in court tomorrow, Inspector. So we should be allowed to examine the scene!\nGregson:\nHah! Listen, sunshine, even I'm not allowed to touch anythin' up here! It's that blasted Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act to blame. It's drivin' me potty!\nRyunosuke:\nOh yes, that special dispensation... (The professor mentioned that, too.)\nGregson:\nMore red tape's all we need. I dunno what the government thinks it's playin' at sometimes.\nIris:\nBut...we're allowed to just look, aren't we?\nGregson:\nEh?\nIris:\nSurely that's alright...isn't it, Gregsy?\nGregson:\n......... 'Course, Your Ladyship! Anythin' you say, Your Ladyship! But please don't get your dainty hands dirty, will you?\nIris:\nDon't worry. We wouldn't dream of touching anything, would we, Runo?\nRyunosuke:\n(She really knows how to get what she wants...)\nAfter clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage:\nGregson:\nRight, are you done here, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nGregson:\nIsn't it about time you were leavin'? Or rather...it IS about time you were leavin'! That lot are here now.\nIris:\nThat lot?\nGregson:\nThe Forensic Investigation Team. They'll be givin' me the heave-ho in a minute, too.\nIris:\nOh dear. Poor Gregsy. Here! Have another cup of my special blend to cheer you up!\nGregson:\n*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! That hit the spot! Yup, hits it every time!\nRyunosuke:\n(Well, at least I've seen the scene with my own eyes. It looks like this is as far as we're going to get with our investigations here at least...)\nIris:\nI've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he?\nRyunosuke:\nAbout what?\nIris:\nAbout Mr Reaper!\nRyunosuke:\n...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he?\nIris:\nHere, this is what you need!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat's this?

We have a big trial tomorrow!\nIris:\nBut that's where Hurley is.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat? At, at this popular London attraction?\nIris:\nYes!\nRyunosuke:\nHow is it that you know where he is?\nIris:\nHurley told me. But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo.\nRyunosuke:\nMadame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.)\nProsecutor's Office\nNaruhodo's Legal Consultancy\n22nd October\nMadame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks\nRyunosuke:\nWh-What is this place? L-Look at all these t-terrifying scenes! But why are all the p-people so still? (Guillotines... Ruthless murderers... I know what I'll be dreaming about tonight.)\nIris:\nThey're all wax models. They're amazingly realistic, aren't they? What do you think, Runo? Shocked?\nRyunosuke:\nW-W-WAX MODELS?! .........AAAAAAAAAGH! I, I read about d-dead bodies and wax once...in a m-magazine about strange phenomena. Depending on how c-c-corpses are kept after death, p-parts of them can turn to wax, apparently. It's c-called a...adi...adip... Adipocere!\nIris:\n...Stop talking about creepy things like that, Runo. You're scaring me. Anyway, adipocere doesn't form readily, you know. It's only in very specif-\nRyunosuke:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\nIris:\nWhat now?\nRyunosuke:\nI've, I've just remembered something else I read, in another m-magazine about strange phenomena. There was an old lady - maybe a w-witch - who used to pour molten wax over c-corpses and put them on display.\nIris:\nNone of the exhibits in here are real. They're all entirely man-made replicas.\nRyunosuke:\nThey can't be! Do you really expect me to believe that? Just look at them!\nIris:\nOh!\nRyunosuke:\nThere's no way anybody could make models of people that are this realistic! And...they're all such gruesome scenes... .........Wait.\nIris:\nWhat is it?\nRyunosuke:\nOh...no... (I must be seeing things...)\nRyunosuke:\nIt's...it's... ...the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes! (Mr Sholmes has his own wax statue in here? Really?)\nIris:\nWell he is world-famous, after all!\nRyunosuke:\nIt's an uncanny resemblance, isn't it? It makes my skin crawl to look at it...\nIris:\nI know! But look, Runo. You can kick this Hurley, and he doesn't move a muscle!\nRyunosuke:\nYou can't go around kicking the exhibits, Iris! .........Wait. It, it just moved, I'm sure. And not just a little bit, either!\nIris:\nHm? Really? Did it?\nRyunosuke:\nAnd look closely... ...there are beads of sweat on the face...of this waxwork... model...\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n......... Sh-Shall we move on, Iris? ...Over there, look! There's a great murder scene to enjoy! Much more appealing.\nSholmes:\nSholmes:\nMy dear fellow! I take exception to your recoiling in such a manner, as if you've seen something truly abhorrent!\nRyunosuke:\nMr...Mr Sholmes! (I knew it!)\nSholmes:\nIris, what possessed you?! I strictly forbade you from divulging my temporary waxwork secret to Mr Naruhodo!\nRyunosuke:\nTemporary waxwork? What do you mean?\nSholmes:\nAnd that kick! Could you not have exercised a little more restraint? You winded me!\nIris:\nBut Runo has something he needs to ask you.\nSholmes:\nAh...a question?\nIris:\nAnd I thought you'd probably be getting bored, too. So here we are!\nSholmes:\nHm... Well, I can't deny that your timing was impeccable. A mere two minutes more being stationary like that... ...and my great brain, upon which all my success has been built, would have turned to wax!\nRyunosuke:\n...Thank goodness we arrived in time.\nSholmes:\nIndeed. In many ways, the pair of you just saved the world from an unimaginable loss!\nIris:\nOh, Hurley! You do like to talk nonsense, don't you?\nRyunosuke:\n(He could know something, it's true. About Lord van Zieks, and what happened in the past to change him.)\nSholmes:\nNow that you're here, let's take our time. How can I be of assistance? For you're in luck. I'm suddenly quite taken with the idea of conversing!\nRyunosuke:\nOh...well, actually, I'm in quite a hurry.\nSholmes:\nAnd if my eyes don't deceive me... ...I believe something is afoot within the walls of this very museum. A most fascinating case, if I'm not mistaken.\nRyunosuke:\nReally?\nSholmes:\nMoreover... ...I have a strong suspicion that it is related to the matter about which you've come to me now.\nRyunosuke:\n(But...how could it be?)\nSholmes:\nWe shall speak again presently, my dear fellow. But for now, I must return to my work.\nRyunosuke:\n(What, back to being a temporary waxwork exhibit?)\nSholmes:\n......... Well? What is it you'd like to ask me, then?\nRyunosuke:\nUm. Actually, it's... It's about Lord van Zieks.\nSholmes:\nAh, our friend Mr Reaper. How did you find him? Well, I trust?\nAnd so I filled Mr Sholmes in about everything I'd learnt. About Lord van Zieks... About Professor Harebrayne... And about the strange coincidence that they had been at university together.\nRyunosuke:\nSo I'm wondering what it was that happened to make Lord van Zieks such a different person.\nIris:\nI was sure that you'd know, Hurley.\nSholmes:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nYou said there was something going on here in this exhibit hall before. That something was afoot. And that you believed it was related to what I wanted to ask you about.\nSholmes:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nUm, Mr Sholmes...? (He's suddenly clammed up.)\nSholmes:\nWell, it seems we've reached the unavoida-\n???:\nGreetings...\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Ah...hello. (Where did she appear from? And what's she wearing? Could she look any more mysterious?)\n???:\nI hope...you are appreciating my museum?\nRyunosuke:\nSorry? Have we...? Mr Sholmes, do you know this- (Not again!)\nTusspells:\nMy apologies. I am Esmeralda Tusspells. This is my museum of waxwork.\nRyunosuke:\nWha... You... You're THE Madame Tusspells?\nTusspells:\nBien sûr. Though only twenty-six years young, I might add.\nRyunosuke:\n...Is that significant somehow?\nTusspells:\nI'm a 'madame' in name only. It adds a certain...je ne sais quoi.\nRyunosuke:\nRight...\nTusspells:\nFirstly, I must apologise for my waxworks. Or rather, one waxwork in particular.\nRyunosuke:\n(That'll be Mr Sholmes, then.)\nTusspells:\nI was led to believe he was a great detective, but he seems...unable to settle. Next time you move from your designated exhibit...there WILL be toil and trouble.\nIris:\nShe sounds deadly serious.\nRyunosuke:\n(That's a problem. How am I supposed to ask Mr Sholmes about Lord van Zieks now?)\nIris:\nLet's not forget what Hurley said before. About something being afoot right here in the museum, I mean.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I know, but...\nIris:\nI'm so curious! I want to know what's happening here!\nRyunosuke:\n(Haven't we got enough on our plate already?!)\nRyunosuke:\nUm, I wonder...could I ask you something?\nTusspells:\nBien sûr...\nRyunosuke:\nI'm just curious. Is anything going on in the museum at the moment. [sic] Some kind of incident, perhaps?\nTusspells:\n......... Whoever suggested such a thing to you?\nRyunosuke:\nOh, well, it was... ...your temporary waxwork over there who mentioned it to me a little- Oh! (He's disappeared!)\n???:\n...A wax model is a work of art. Not some tawdry object for trade.\nRyunosuke:\nAh! Th-There you are!\nTusspells:\nLeaving the exhibit again when you should be working? ...Do you wish to be melted down?\nSholmes:\nMy dear Madame Tusspells, save your reprimands. There are more pressing concerns. The wax can wait. It's our ideas about your current problem we must throw into the melting pot instead!\nTusspells:\n...!\nSholmes:\nPersonally, I would advise you not to involve the police.\nTusspells:\nWhy ever not?!\nRyunosuke:\n(She's turned as white as a sheet...)\nSholmes:\nBecause you have at your disposal a great detective, whose services you may employ for a mere fifty shillings. Though please be aware that I prefer- No, I insist upon payment in advance!\nTusspells:\n......... ...Very well. Let us see if the great detective is able to live up to his name, shall we?\nSholmes:\nBefore I engage my analytical processes, I must ask you to clarify something. What, pray, is behind the curtain?\nTusspells:\nThat is the Tusspells Special Exhibit. There is an extra charge to see it.\nSholmes:\nAh, the 'special' exhibit in the House of Horrors... It must depict a special killer then, I presume. Would you be so kind as to draw back the curtain, I wonder?\nTusspells:\nAh! Absolument non! There is nothing amiss behind there!\nSholmes:\nNothing amiss, madame? What about the arm protruding ominously from under the curtain?\nTusspells:\nAh!\nSholmes:\nI strongly encourage you to allow me to see what lies beyond, before the situation worsens.\nTusspells:\n......... Yes, very well. I will draw back the curtains. ...But only a soupçon.\nSholmes:\nI must confess, I peeked behind the curtain earlier. The Tusspells Special Exhibit is a very bleak graveyard scene indeed. And yet somewhat surprisingly... ...the waxwork killer one would expect is nowhere to be seen. What does strike one, however... ...is the portly gentleman lying peacefully on his back on the floor.\nRyunosuke:\nWell, well then perhaps, Mr Sholmes... ...that man on the floor is the ruthless killer himself!\nSholmes:\nI'm afraid not, my dear fellow. He's a perfectly ordinary London gentleman. Not even a waxwork, in fact.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nSholmes:\nAs skilfully made as these waxworks are, they are always distinguishable from real humans. So, allow me to present my two conclusions. The first... ...is that a sizeable business transaction has been taking place in this special exhibit.\nTusspells:\nWhy...? Why would you say that?\nSholmes:\nAnd the second... ...is that the aforementioned transaction is linked to a serious crime!\nTusspells:\nAAAAAAH!\nRyunosuke:\n(She looks as pale as candle wax...)\nTusspells:\nI, I don't understand...\nSholmes:\nSo, Madame Tusspells, as you've agreed to my fee... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work.\nThe Great Deduction\nThe game is afoot!\nTopic 1\nWaxwork's Fate\nSholmes:\nTo begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds.\nTusspells:\nThat, that is all my own money!\nSholmes:\nSo what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! 'Waxwork for sale'? Your business has hit hard times, it would seem. In short... ...you sold the infamous killer - the centrepiece of your special exhibit - for the sum of two hundred pounds!\nTusspells:\nNooooooooon!\nSholmes:\nNow...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor?\nTusspells:\n.........\nSholmes:\nIt would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you.\nTusspells:\nAh!\nSholmes:\nUnfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! It would appear that you twisted this gentleman around your little finger most effectively.\nTusspells:\nWhat are you suggesting?!\nSholmes:\nHe rashly agreed to purchase the waxwork for the sum of two hundred pounds. Only when he came to hand the money over, did it occur to him what an extortionate amount he was paying. But the money was no longer in his hands. And the result? The scene we see before us. He collapsed in shock. Yes, the killer in this special exhibit fetched a killer price! We can only pray that the gentleman's dreams are not plagued with regret...\nTopic 1\nWaxwork's Fate\nConclusion\nSold for cash\nTopic 2\nWaxwork Location\nSholmes:\nThe question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment.\nTusspells:\nYou, you cannot possibly...\nSholmes:\nWhat immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Such as is worn by policemen as a secret sign to fellow members of the force that a crime is being perpetrated. Yes, this young man is an undercover policeman, currently investigating this museum. I know him well, in fact. It's Sergeant John Clay.\nTusspells:\nWhat are you talking about?\nSholmes:\nThe man's quite a celebrity. He received triple accolades at last year's policing awards.\nTusspells:\nBut...\nSholmes:\nNext we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork.\nTusspells:\nAh! But, but you...\nSholmes:\nYour reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! 'Thruppence'...? A tragically low price, you might say. Though perhaps the going rate for ageing waxworks riddled with cracks. And yet you sold it to the portly gentleman for an exorbitant two hundred pounds! The sort of plucky behaviour that's sure to attract the attention of Scotland Yard... Isn't that so, madame?\nTusspells:\nI, I do not...\nSholmes:\nYes, the waxwork you sold has already been seized by the police and remains in their custody as we speak! The old man must be reunited with his grave in the special exhibit, and not a moment too soon!\nTopic 2\nWaxwork Location\nConclusion\nDiscovered already\nSholmes:\nThus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle!\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nIris:\n.........\nTusspells:\n.........\nSholmes:\nI see I've stunned you all into silence.\nIris:\nYou have, Hurley, you have. And you've obviously upset this young lady in the process. Her cauldron looks awfully hot...\nRyunosuke:\nUm...if I could just bring up one point, Mr Sholmes?\nSholmes:\nAh! The notorious Naruhodo 'one point'! I'm all ears, my dear fellow!\nRyunosuke:\nAccording to your deduction, then, the special exhibit featured this old policeman. So...that would mean that he's the particularly ruthless murderer, wouldn't it?\nSholmes:\n......... The killer policeman, Ottermole.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nSholmes:\nIt was a mysterious series of murders that rattled the capital only last year. The police rushed to the scene every time, only to find the culprit had disappeared into the aether.\nIris:\nAnd it turned out the culprit was a policeman himself! A senior officer by the name of Ottermole!\nRyunosuke:\nSo you mean that's who the sinister-looking old man there is supposed to be?\nSholmes:\nIndeed. It is a particularly grim face, is it not? Unforgettable, in fact. Yes, I remember that odious countenance only too well.\nRyunosuke:\nBut is two hundred pounds a lot of money for a wax model?\nSholmes:\nIt would be enough to afford one of the latest steam carriages, if that puts things in perspective?\nRyunosuke:\nS-So...it is quite a lot then.\nTusspells:\n......... Is there anything else you wish to add? Before I melt you down.\nRyunosuke:\n(That bubbling wax is looking more and more ominous...)\nIris:\nUgh...the smell of all that molten wax is starting to worry me.\nRyunosuke:\nMr Sholmes did more or less just accuse her to her face, so... I think I might have to call on your assistance here, Iris, if that's alright? To make some minor corrections to the great detective's great deductions...\nIris:\nOf course it's alright! We'll soon set things straight!\nRyunosuke:\nWell...let's get started then, shall we? Before Madame Tusspells vents her anger!\nSholmes:\nJust what I was waiting to hear, my dear fellow! So, Madame Tusspells, in accordance with our agreement... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work.\nCourse Correction\nHold it, Mr Sholmes!\nTopic 1\nWaxwork's Fate\nConclusion\nSold for cash\nSholmes:\nTo begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds.\nTusspells:\nThat, that is all my own money!\nSholmes:\nSo what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice!\nRyunosuke:\nShe definitely looked in this direction, it's true.\nIris:\nBut I'm not sure she'd sell any of her waxworks, even for two hundred pounds.\nRyunosuke:\nOh?\nIris:\nShe must pour her heart and soul into making them, don't you think? Over and above the wax. If it were me, I wouldn't sell them for anything.\nRyunosuke:\n......... (For that much money, I would! ...But it sounds like that makes me a bad person.) W-Well anyway... ...I wonder if the two hundred pounds could have some other significance.\nIris:\nLet's follow that furtive glance again and see if there's anything else that could explain it!\nThe significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice!\nIris:\nJudging by appearances... ...this man and the two hundred pounds are in no way related at all.\nRyunosuke:\n(The poor man was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it seems...) But there's no doubt that Madame Tusspells did react to what Mr Sholmes said. The way she automatically looked over this way must tell us something, I'm sure.\nIris:\n...Then let's have more of a look around!\nRyunosuke:\nThe significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that ransom note!\nSholmes:\nQuite so. And we must congratulate these criminals on their inventiveness, abducting a waxwork.\nTusspells:\nAgh!\nSholmes:\nTwo hundred pounds is no small ransom fee. Yet you clearly intend to pay it.\nTusspells:\nThe model in question has...special importance. So I put together all the money I have...\nSholmes:\nIn summary, then! The two hundred pounds you have in your handbag...is ransom money! Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor?\nTusspells:\n.........\nSholmes:\nIt would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you.\nTusspells:\nAh!\nSholmes:\nUnfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds!\nRyunosuke:\nSo if the waxwork was kidnapped, where does that leave us in terms of who this man is?\nIris:\nWe could just ask him when he comes around.\nRyunosuke:\n...I think the point of this exercise is to understand the beauty of the deduction process, Iris.\nIris:\nYes, you're right. Hurley's trying so hard, we mustn't let him down.\nRyunosuke:\nWell, there's little doubt that he suffered a shock. That much seems clear. But in that case, what's Madame Tusspells trying to hide? Let's have a closer look around...\nWhat dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds!\nRyunosuke:\nIt must have been a considerable blow to have knocked the man unconscious.\nIris:\nYes, he looks like a very sturdy man, doesn't he? Ooh! Perhaps he was struck on the back of the head with something hard?!\nRyunosuke:\n...Don't sound so excited about it, Iris. (Whatever did leave the man out cold like that, it must have been quite something...)\nRyunosuke:\nWhat dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the waxwork hand!\nSholmes:\nIndeed. With a solid waxwork limb, one could deliver a very substantial blow.\nTusspells:\nHow, how could you...?\nRyunosuke:\nThe hand protruding from the bottom of your cape... It ought to be a right hand, but closer inspection reveals that in fact, it's a left hand.\nTusspells:\nAh!\nSholmes:\nAnd somewhat masculine as well. In other words, it does not belong to you, madame. It is the hand of a waxwork model!\nTusspells:\nKYAAAAAAH! Some of the visitors to my museum can be...troublesome. They meddle with the exhibits and cause damage.\nRyunosuke:\nSo you mean, that arm...?\nTusspells:\nYes. This gentleman saw fit to try to remove it as a souvenir.\nSholmes:\nHm, no small keepsake.\nRyunosuke:\nLike taking a whole branch of a cherry tree when you go to view the blossoms...\nTusspells:\nI am afraid I had to teach the man a lesson.\nRyunosuke:\nYou confronted the man and tried to take the arm back.\nSholmes:\nAnd the result? The scene we see before us. He was knocked unconscious. A point we may need to revisit later. But for the time being, we have our conclusion: Yes, the killer in this special exhibit has been kidnapped!\nTopic 1\nWaxwork's Fate\nConclusion\nSold for cash\nKidnapped!\nSolved\nTopic 2\nWaxwork Location\nConclusion\nDiscovered already\nSholmes:\nThe question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment.\nTusspells:\nYou, you cannot possibly...\nSholmes:\nWhat immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief.\nRyunosuke:\nAccording to Mr Sholmes... ...the yellow neckerchief is a sign to other policemen that some crime is underway.\nIris:\nA way of communicating with his colleagues without revealing his identity, yes. It's a secret that's closely guarded by Scotland Yard.\nRyunosuke:\n...That Mr Sholmes didn't hesitate to give away.\nIris:\nWell, uncovering secrets is in any true detective's nature, of course.\nRyunosuke:\nRight... Anyway, judging from Madame Tusspells's reaction to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...I think perhaps we might not have identified the man quite correctly.\nWho is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief.\nRyunosuke:\nAccording to Mr Sholmes, this young gentleman is actually a policeman in plain clothes. And the secret scarf sign appears to back that idea up. It does seem plausible.\nIris:\nBut Madame Tusspells's reaction was strange. Which must mean...\nRyunosuke:\n...That we haven't got to the bottom of who or what this man really is yet.\nRyunosuke:\nWho is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his shoulder stub.\nSholmes:\nNo such boneless human walks this earth. Of that, I can assure you. In other words, the man standing here - the young Sergeant John Clay... ...is in fact, defying all odds, a waxwork model!\nRyunosuke:\nI seem to remember it was you who concluded he was a real person in the first place, Mr Sholmes.\nTusspells:\nHe has become quite a celebrity in London, being the winner of no less than three policing awards last year. I simply had to make a model of the man.\nSholmes:\nNaturally! What other explanation could there be?\nRyunosuke:\nAnd it was this detective's arm that was pulled off by the man on the floor in the special exhibit, wasn't it?\nSholmes:\nNext we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork.\nTusspells:\nAh! But, but you...\nSholmes:\nYour reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag!\nRyunosuke:\nA killer policeman...called Ottermole, was it? Was he well known?\nIris:\nIt was all over the papers last year. But I can't say I know what he looks like. It's a very low price, though. Thruppence isn't much money.\nRyunosuke:\n(Only enough for a few measly hours of gas in Mr Garrideb's delightful lodgings, in fact...) So this is the special killer taken from the special exhibit...is it? The waxwork that somebody stole from the museum and tried to ransom for two hundred pounds... ...is this crusty old killer policeman Ottermole? Really?\nIris:\nPerhaps we should have a good look around again and see if another idea crops up!\nThe telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag!\nIris:\nIf we just poured a little bit of molten wax on him, we'd soon find out if he was real or not.\nRyunosuke:\nYes...you never know, there may be another way. We've already come this far, so maybe we should stick to logical deductions, don't you think?\nIris:\nAlright, if that's the way you want to do it, then we should examine him in more detail.\nRyunosuke:\n(If anyone saw, they'd think we were obsessed with the elderly...)\nRyunosuke:\nThe telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious twitch!\nSholmes:\nEven the most realistic waxworks do not exhibit a twitch. In other words, this splendid old man is in fact a genuine member of Scotland Yard!\nRyunosuke:\n...Slight shift in your choice of adjectives, then...\nSholmes:\nAnd there you have it! Well, Madame Tusspells?\nTusspells:\nWell what? It was me who contacted the police and demanded that someone come in the first place. He is clearly fatigued. He is sound asleep.\nRyunosuke:\nBut then, what's this tag about showing a price of three pence?\nSholmes:\nNo doubt the price tag of the muffler, which the old bobby purchased recently at a local market. And I presume you've observed the scarf tied around his arm? Does that not strike you, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nYes! The secret sign used by detectives to show that some criminal activity is currently underway.\nTusspells:\nOf course. Because, as you know, there has been just such criminal activity happening here. As you deduced from the very beginning, detective.\nSholmes:\nSo, it would seem that we finally arrive at the truth.\nRyunosuke:\nThe waxwork of the especially ruthless killer from the special exhibit has been kidnapped.\nSholmes:\nAnd Scotland Yard are already investigating. But the model's whereabouts remain a mystery. Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle!\nTopic 2\nWaxwork Location\nConclusion\nDiscovered already\nStill a mystery!\nSolved\n\n\nDeduction CompleteElementary!\nTusspells:\nAll sorts of people visit my museum here. Men and women, young and old. Sometimes they drop in just for a short time on their way back from the pub. I welcome them all. But if anyone tries to damage my exhibits... I do not take it lightly. Anyway... ...your great deduction was even more enchanting than I had been led to believe.\nSholmes:\nIt was a pleasure, my dear madame. I'm gratified that you enjoyed the spectacle. And as for your 'rough customer', I've no doubt he'll regain consciousness shortly and return home. What concerns me more... ...is the waxwork from the special display...if it was indeed genuinely abducted?\nTusspells:\n......... Yes. Tragically, it was...\nSholmes:\nThen I would ask you to recount to us the events surrounding the stolen waxwork. In as much detail as possible, if you please.\nTusspells:\n...Very well. But after I have told you what I know, I must insist that you return to your work.\nSholmes:\n......... The talents of a great detective could be put to better use, I feel, but as you wish...\nTusspells:\nIt was a series of gruesome murders that had all of London gripped in terror a decade ago. After five victims were killed, the man was arrested, and put to death.\nSholmes:\nAnd now he's immortalised here in wax for all Londoners to admire and enjoy! Though of course, he happens to be absent at present, on account of the abduction.\nRyunosuke:\nBut I don't understand. How is all this related to Lord van Zieks?\nSholmes:\n......... You must first understand, my dear fellow, why it is that the Professor earnt such infamy. It was due to the victims he chose. Some of Whitehall's finest.\nIris:\nWhat do you mean, Hurley?\nSholmes:\nThose murdered by the Professor were some of the highest members of the British aristocracy. Members of the nobility. Even royalty. It sent shockwaves through the country's administration.\nRyunosuke:\nMembers of the... Ah! Wait! Of course! What Professor Harebrayne said! Lord van Zieks is from a family with noble blood!\nIris:\nOh gosh!\nSholmes:\nIt was the fifth victim that led to the Professor's arrest. The last of the killer's prey was a young noble by the name of... ...Klint van Zieks.\nRyunosuke:\nNo! I don't believe it! Van Zieks?!\nSholmes:\nI'm sure you can piece together the rest for yourself. In the wake of his older brother's murder, the young Barok pursued a career as a prosecutor. And eventually...became the Reaper we know today.\nRyunosuke:\n......... I had no idea Lord van Zieks had such a tragic past...\nSholmes:\nWell, I'm afraid that's all I can say on the matter. For the time being at least. After all, I have work to do... ...as a waxwork exhibit.\nTusspells:\nI am afraid I shall have to excuse myself as well.\nRyunosuke:\nOh, yes, of course. It's, it's been a pleasure. Thank you.\n???:\n...Well, none of the predicted scenarios I've been analysing involved you coming to visit me here.\nHarebrayne:\nIt's been too long, it really has. I'm delighted to see you, Barok.\nVan Zieks:\nIt's been ten years. And here we are, meeting in a prison of all places.\nHarebrayne:\nI can't forgive myself for what happened to Mr Asman! I just can't! I, I still can't believe it could happen...\nVan Zieks:\n......... Tomorrow the court will decide.\nHarebrayne:\nYes! I have a young Eastern man acting for my defence. He seems reliable enough, though. It, it was an accident. A terrible accident. He, he, he assures me he can prove it!\nVan Zieks:\nI must warn you...\nHarebrayne:\nOh, I know, I know! I've heard already. You're going to be prosecuting, aren't you?\nVan Zieks:\n...Yes.\nHarebrayne:\n......... Since I returned to England, I've heard lots of stories. Barok, are you really...?\nVan Zieks:\nWhat?\nHarebrayne:\n......... Never mind. I know that you have my best interests at heart.\nVan Zieks:\nMy friend is on trial. ...I wouldn't entrust it to anybody else.\nHarebrayne:\nOf course. I fully understand. Thank you, Barok.\nVan Zieks:\nUntil tomorrow, then. I'll see you in court.\nTo be continued...",

And it's set on a background of a sunflower design. ...Or was it a dandelion? ...Or a chrysanthemum, perhaps... .........Well anyway, no one should be judged on their knowledge of flowers...or lack of it.\n\n\n\n\nInside of armband\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe name of the armband's owner is very finely embroidered here. 'Kazuma Asogi'... One day, when I'm back in Japan and I've earned my official law qualification there... ...I'll wear one band on each arm. ...That should make me a very well-balanced lawyer, I suppose.Ryunosuke:\n(I can't believe it's been six months since I was last allowed to work in court. And now here I am, back at the Old Bailey...)Harebrayne:\nAh! M-Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke:\nGood morning, Professor Harebrayne.Harebrayne:\nI, I don't understand! It doesn't make any sense! The atmospheric pressure in here is off the charts! I've never felt anything like it! It's, it's crushing me!Ryunosuke:\nI feel it every time I'm here. That...gravity.Harebrayne:\nWell, this is Britain's highest court... But are you telling me it's filled with some kind of device that can actually control air pressure?!Ryunosuke:\n......... I think it's probably all in the mind.Harebrayne:\nAh. Yes, well...you won't let me down, will you, Mr Naruhodo? I'm counting on you in today's trial...to save my life! To save the secret of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine from being made public!Ryunosuke:\nYes, I understand. (I know what I have to do. I have to establish that the explosion two days ago was nothing more than an unfortunate accident.)Harebrayne:\nWell, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about, really. Justice will prevail!???:\nMy commiserations, Mr Naruhodo. You appear to have been lumbered with a most tiresome case here.Ryunosuke:\nMr Sholmes! I didn't expect to see you here.Iris:\nThat was very mean, Runo, leaving me alone at home with Hurley. It took me at least an hour to wake him!Harebrayne:\nAh... Oh... Ah... Is it...? Are you...? HEEEEEERLOCK SHOOOOOOLMES?!Sholmes:\nIndeed, sir. I am he. Heeeeeerlock Shoooooolmes.Harebrayne:\nOh, I've heard all about your exploits, even whilst living in Germany.Iris:\nAh yes. Randst Magazine is on sale in Germany, too.Harebrayne:\nThis month's instalment was sublime! Your deduction in 'The Adventure of Silver Blaze' was wonderful!Sholmes:\nAh yes, a memorable case indeed. It concerned a snake, I seem to recall.Iris:\nNo, that was 'The Speckled Band.'Ryunosuke:\nWell, thank you for coming. I do appreciate your support.Sholmes:\nI'm sorry to disappoint you, my dear fellow, but I'm afraid I can't stay.Ryunosuke:\nOh.Sholmes:\nI have urgent business at Madame Tusspells.Ryunosuke:\nYou mean...your waxwork job?Sholmes:\nNo no, the waxwork abduction, of course. Madame has engaged my services.Ryunosuke:\nAh, so you're trying to get to the bottom of that ransom note, are you?Sholmes:\nThe week's wages depend on it! ...As does the safe return of the waxwork, naturally. As such, I intend to give it my undivided attention.Ryunosuke:\nOh, well, never mind then. I understand.Sholmes:\nOf course, with my skills of observation and reasoning, resolving the matter will be as easy as proverbial pie. I shall return forthwith. For until I solve the case, I shall have no money to afford a pie of any description.Iris:\nOoh, then you must absolutely give it your full attention, Hurley!Sholmes:\nQuite, Iris, quite. But life is riddled with irony, you know. Whenever I give something my full attention, I have a quite insatiable desire for a pie. One of the universe's intractable mysteries, you might say.Harebrayne:\nOh yes! Quite! Definitely! Absolutely! I totally understand!Ryunosuke:\n(...Is someone a little starstruck?)Sholmes:\nI wish you the very best of luck, Professor Harebrayne.Harebrayne:\nOh! Ah! Ooh! Why, thank you!Sholmes:\nBefore I depart, Mr Naruhodo...a word in your ear, if you please?Ryunosuke:\n...? What's this about?Sholmes:\nAs you have remarkably little grounding in science, I feel I ought to inform you... As compelling as this 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis' hypothesis may be... ...a practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible.Ryunosuke:\nBut, but the professor said the demonstration was a success!Sholmes:\nYes, it would appear that he fervently believes it was.Iris:\nI've read Professor Bunnybrain's paper about it, too, Runo. And I have to say... ...I'm sure it can't be done. It could barely be done theoretically, let alone practically.Ryunosuke:\n(So he's completely barking up the wrong tree?) But how could an experiment that had no possibility of succeeding in fact succeed? That's contradictory.Sholmes:\nAnd it's that contradiction that will be at the heart of the trial, I've no doubt.Ryunosuke:\n(What's that supposed to mean?)Sholmes:\nNow, I must hurry along. I wish you the best of luck, my dear fellow.Iris:\nSee you later, Hurley! Well, it looks like you're on your own today, Runo. But chin up! You can do it!Ryunosuke:\nOh! What about you, Iris?Iris:\nAh, no, I'm afraid I can't help. I have something I need to do.Ryunosuke:\n...I see.Iris:\nHehe! It's going to be a big surprise for you when you find out what it is!Ryunosuke:\nHaah... (That sounds ominous...)Bailiff:\nCounsel for the Defence! And the defendant! Court is about to be in session. Make your way into the courtroom at once!Ryunosuke:\nWe're on our way! (An experiment that the laws of science say can't possibly succeed... ...and a scientist who's convinced that it did. That's the riddle you have to unlock here, Ryunosuke! That's the key to this case!)23rd October, 9:10 a.m.\nThe Old Bailey CourtroomJudge:\nIn the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. We are sitting today for the public trial of Professor Albert Harebrayne. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution is ready.Ryunosuke:\nThe defence is... The defence is ready, My Lord! ......... (I'm six months out of practice. And what's more... ...I'm without Susato-san today.) ......... (Ugh... Is it just my imagination, or does the air in here feel even more oppressive than usual?)Judge:\nSo... ...I must say I recollect the victim of this case all too well. Mr Odie Asman.Van Zieks:\nMr Asman was well known as a financier...though that was merely a front for his diverse criminal activities.Judge:\nIt was only a month ago that the man appeared in court prosecuted by you, Lord van Zieks. But the jury unanimously found him not guilty.Ryunosuke:\n(Because every member of the jury had been bribed, by the sound of it. These powerful London criminals are prepared to go to extreme lengths to keep their freedom.)Judge:\nBut two days ago, on 21st October, Mr Asman met his end. The work of the Reaper, was it?Van Zieks:\n......... If that is how Your Lordship would describe divine retribution... But the fact remains that Mr Asman's death... ...was a direct result of the actions of the accused, Professor Harebrayne.Judge:\nVery well, then. Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... You have been selected at random to represent the will of the people. Are the six of you ready to fulfil your societal duty?Juror No. 1:\nI'm most gratified to have been selected to carry out this important civic duty, My Lord.Juror No. 2:\nTo have a man's fate in the palm of one's hand... Oh gosh! Oh golly! It sends shivers down my spine.Juror No. 3:\nScience experiments, magic, conjuring tricks, courtroom trials... All are nothing more than performances.Juror No. 4:\nAny spurious scholar that defiles the reputation of science deserves to hang!Juror No. 5:\nUm, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it?Juror No. 6:\n......... Wasn't like this in my day! Wasn't like this at all!Ryunosuke:\n......... (That's...that's... ...the police killer Ottermole look-alike...again. And he's as exhausted as ever, it seems.)Judge:\nNow, as I'm sure you are all aware... ...the incident we are here to judge today tragically took place at the Great Exhibition, shortly after its opening.Van Zieks:\nThough the death toll could have been far worse. With the exception of the victim, no one was killed. Nevertheless, the dream of the science being exhibited rapidly turned into a nightmare for the spectators.Judge:\nA tragic turn of events. And as such, the eyes of all London- No, of the whole world will be on this trial. It is our duty to reach a swift and just conclusion, I feel. So...your opening statement please, Lord van Zieks.Van Zieks:\nAt the heart of this incident... ...is technology never before demonstrated anywhere in the world.Judge:\nOne of science's latest developments, I take it? The government is keen to capitalise on the Great Exhibition to improve Britain's technological advantage.Van Zieks:\nThe technology being demonstrated by the accused was described as 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis'.Judge:\nGood Lord!Ryunosuke:\nIt's designed to 'disassemble' human subjects using extremely high-voltage electricity... ...and 'beam' them instantly to another location where they are subsequently reassembled.Judge:\nIs...is such a thing even within the realms of possibility?Juror No. 1:\nWell I don't believe it, that's for sure.Juror No. 2:\nDisassembling people with electricity? My goodness! How shocking!Juror No. 4:\nHah! The whole idea is absurd! The hypothesis would never stand up to scrutiny!Judge:\nSir, I believe you are a fellow of the Royal Society, are you not? An expert in your field?Juror No. 4:\nI am, and my word on the matter can be considered final. Instantaneous kinesis is poppycock!Ryunosuke:\n(So this expert and Mr Sholmes are in agreement. It's impossible...)Judge:\nWhat is the prosecution's view on the matter?Van Zieks:\n......... The prosecution would assert... ...that the accused's instantaneous kinesis demonstration was a success.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?!Juror No. 4:\nWhat rot!Judge:\nOrdaaar! Ordaaar!Van Zieks:\nThe professor's hypothesis is currently under investigation by the British government. If it is deemed to have merit, a substantial research grant would be made available. The accused made use of the invention built on his new hypothesis to take Mr Asman's life... ...in order to be the sole benefactor of the grant.Ryunosuke:\nBut, but...Van Zieks:\nThis disastrous demonstration was no accident. It was carefully designed from the outset to end the life of the victim.Judge:\nThank you, Lord van Zieks. The prosecution's stance is clear. But you will now bring forth witnesses to substantiate your claims.Van Zieks:\n...Gladly, My Lord. Bailiff! Show the first witnesses to the stand!Van Zieks:\nWitnesses, state your names and occupations for the court.Gregson:\nYes, sir! Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard's homicide division. I was on duty at the demonstration on the day in question and in charge of the followin' investigation.Harebrayne:\n......... Albert Harebrayne! S-S-Scientist!Van Zieks:\nYou were born in England, but have been carrying out research in Germany in recent years. Correct?Harebrayne:\nYes. Yes, that's right. After graduating from university here in Britain, I went to work in Germany...and made an amazing discovery! Which is what brought me back! I had to demonstrate my incredible hypothesis at the Great Exhibition!Gregson:\nWhat you demonstrated was incredible alright. An incredible explosion!Harebrayne:\nBut the science! The science was a success! The instantaneous kinesis worked! E-Everyone saw it! They must have done! Yes, there was the terrible accident, but... ...the demonstration of my hypothesis was a success!Gregson:\nWell, that much is undeniable. As shown in this photograph taken by the Forensic Investigation Team.Judge:\nThis was taken inside the Crystal Tower, I take it? The centrepiece of the exhibition, no less.Gregson:\nThat's right, My Lord. Seems the victim rammed straight into it.Judge:\nHm, I see... Very well, submit the photograph as evidence.The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record.Gregson:\nAs the court's heard, the victim of the incident was Mr Odie Asman. There have been a number of allegations made against the man, but puttin' them aside for the time bein'... ...he was the man who financed the research for the experiment and the demonstration itself.Judge:\nI see. So to summarise the situation... ...the defendant is accused of taking the life of the man who funded his work. Would that be correct?Gregson:\nExactly.Ryunosuke:\nBut couldn't it be... ...that the explosion was caused by some malfunction in the apparatus used for the demonstration?Harebrayne:\nThat's right! That must be it! My splendid machine... My poor, splendid machine...Gregson:\nYou saw it yesterday, didn't you? We can't even examine the wreckage thanks to the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act.Harebrayne:\nWHAAAAAAAAAT?! The wreckage?! THE WRECKAGE?!Judge:\nBut that being the case, how can the facts be established? How can it possibly be determined whether this was an accident or a deliberate and malicious act?Van Zieks:\nExtremely simply, My Lord.Judge:\nI beg your pardon?Van Zieks:\nIsn't that right, witness?Harebrayne:\nWha...? Sorry? ME?!Van Zieks:\nNo. Your neighbour.Gregson:\nYes, sir! It was murder, plain and simple. Anyone could state that with complete certainty.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?! (How can he possibly think that?)Judge:\nThank you, Inspector. I think we had better proceed to formal testimony. You will explain to the court on what grounds you claim this experiment to have been a front for murder!Witness Testimony\n- A Front for Murder -Gregson:\nThe corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck.Harebrayne:\nI, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake!Gregson:\nBut the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound.\nThere was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart!\nSo the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it!Judge:\n......... An extraordinary business... In addition to suffering a broken neck, the victim was stabbed in the heart?Ryunosuke:\n(Information I would really like to have heard from someone other than the judge...)Gregson:\nThe coroner says death would have been all but instant from a wound like that.Van Zieks:\nYou could say, in fact... ...that the victim was killed twice by the accused.Harebrayne:\nNo, no and no! That couldn't be further from the truth!Gregson:\nI have here the experiment plan document that was submitted to the security team. The victim stood himself inside somethin' called 'the birdcage', ready to be 'beamed' instantly... ...to the second level of the Crystal Tower, about twenty-five yards away.Van Zieks:\nThe experiment did not go according to plan, however. As the machine was put into operation, there was a large explosion. The blast caused the beam transmitter to point higher than intended. Accordingly, the kinesis resulted in the birdcage materialising in mid-air... ...from where it subsequently fell, crashing through the glass of the Crystal Tower's large round window.Judge:\nMy word... One assumes the victim's neck was broken upon impact with the tower, then?Harebrayne:\nI'm, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for this to happen! The machine was just too powerful! But honestly! Really! I swear! It was just an accident! A terrible accident!Van Zieks:\nUnfortunately, that excuse can't save you.Gregson:\nNo, not considerin' the sharp murder weapon that pierced the victim's heart.Harebrayne:\nM-Murder weapon?! What are you saying?!Van Zieks:\nThis is the autopsy report submitted by the coroner. The prosecution would like it entered into the Court Record.Judge:\nYour request is granted, Counsel.The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.Juror No. 4:\nI was there in person, you know. I saw the whole ludicrous performance.

Which highlights somethin' else about this whole rum business.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat's that?\nVan Zieks:\nThe fact that the instantaneous kinesis itself was a success.\nRyunosuke:\nAh!\nGregson:\nAfter the explosion, the cage with the fella inside suddenly appeared out of nowhere in mid-air.\nJudge:\nSo although the experiment ended in disaster, the so-called instantaneous kinesis did actually occur.\nVan Zieks:\n...Remind us, Professor, what was the cause of the fatal disaster?Harebrayne:\nI, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo the angle of projection is critical, is it? And you calculated it yourself? Personally?\nHarebrayne:\nAbsolutely! The calculation is far too complicated for anyone but me to carry out!\nGregson:\nOnly, you got it wrong, didn't you?\nHarebrayne:\nYes! That's right! That's the point! The calculation is so complicated, even I can make a mistake!\nRyunosuke:\n(Do people fall for that brazen confidence? ...I should try it.)\nHarebrayne:\nI, I took into account the subject's height and weight, the wind direction, the ambient temperature... I considered every possible variable! So I just don't understand how this could have happened!\nRyunosuke:\nObviously then, you had to include the weight of the clothes Mr Asman was wearing at the time, I suppose?\nHarebrayne:\nAh. Crackling comets! The answer should have been three!\nRyunosuke:\n(So much for safety first. The three must be for safety third...)Gregson:\nBut the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nAnother fatal injury, you say? That doesn't make any sense!\nGregson:\nI didn't think I'd have to spell this out, but here we go... Just because there were two fatal wounds doesn't mean I'm sayin' the victim had two lives to lose, does it?\nRyunosuke:\n...Too right.\nGregson:\nObviously at first, we thought the bloke had died due to his spine snappin' in half as well.\nRyunosuke:\nBut you're saying that's not the case?!\nGregson:\nYou'll get your answer once I've finished my fish an' chips...if you don't keep buttin' in every few seconds!\nRyunosuke:\n(But we all know that's a bottomless bag...)\nVan Zieks:\nThe victim plummeted thirty feet into a glass tower. It would be reasonable to assume that as the cause of death.\nGregson:\nRight. That's what we all thought. But it was a red herring, wasn't it?Gregson:\nThere was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe defence knew nothing of this crucial information!\nVan Zieks:\nThe prosecution received this report from the Forensic Investigation Team only this morning. That was the first we knew of it as well. I can only apologise for the impossibility of informing the defence.\nRyunosuke:\n(Sarcastic AND insincere? Thanks...) So, what was the nature of this sharp object?\nVan Zieks:\nAmong the accused's tools that were in use at the demonstration, one is of particular interest.

His brother, Michael, is a cross-head.\nJudge:\nWell, it would appear that your beloved 'Andrew' has a red stain on his shank.\nRyunosuke:\nAh! That, that isn't...?\nVan Zieks:\nIt's blood, beyond all reasonable doubt.\nRyunosuke:\nNo!\nGregson:\nAnd that's not all.

Mr Asman's, no doubt. This is the problem with looking at murder weapons...\n\n\n\n\nHandle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nI've seen this unusually shaped handle before. It's the same screwdriver that was lodged in the grille on the floor of the kinesis machine. (Which could be important information, so I should definitely make a note of it.)\nThe details of the screwdriver have been updated in the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nHandle (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThere's no question considering the unusual shape of the handle... This is the screwdriver that was poking through the floor of the kinesis machine. It looks a little bit like a capital 'A'. (For 'Andrew' I suppose...)Gregson:\nSo the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWhat grounds do you have for saying that?\nGregson:\nHah! D'you really need to ask? There were only two people on that public experimentation stage, in front of the whole crowd.\nVan Zieks:\nThe victim, Mr Odie Asman, and the accused, Professor Harebrayne. And we know for certain that before the experiment, the victim was alive.\nJuror No. 4:\nThat's right. I saw him with my own eyes!\nVan Zieks:\nFurthermore... ...following the explosion and 'kinesis', nobody went anywhere near the body.\nGregson:\nIn other words, only someone else on stage with the victim could possibly have done it. And Albert Harebrayne is the only bloke who fits the bill. Unless you've got some other bright idea, sunshine? In which case, let's hear it!\n\n\n\nPursue Albert Harebrayne (after pressing fourth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nProfessor Harebrayne! Do you have some information that may be relevant here?\nHarebrayne:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nProfessor!\nHarebrayne:\nAh! Sorry! SORRY! I was just calculating the optimum coefficient of electrolysis to separate molecules in the human body...\nRyunosuke:\n(And the witness stand is the best place for that?) It seemed as though you might have something to say? About Inspector Gregson's last remark.\nHarebrayne:\nAh! AHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Yes! Yes, that's right! Of course! He just said that nobody else could have done it, didn't he?\nGregson:\nYeah, that's right. Who else could have stabbed the victim, eh?\nHarebrayne:\nI DON'T KNOW! ...But! There's no way that I could possibly have stabbed Mr Asman as you say.\nGregson:\nEh?\nRyunosuke:\nExplain, please, Professor!\nHarebrayne:\nOf course. This cold-hearted policeman may not be aware, I suppose... ...but humans are warm-blooded mammals, with blood running continuously through their veins.\nGregson:\nI had heard...\nHarebrayne:\nThen surely you see! If I'd plunged something the size of Andrew into the man's chest... ...the whole stage would have been a bloodbath! No, a blood swimming pool!\nRyunosuke:\nAah...\nHarebrayne:\nBut thousands of Londoners were watching me at the time. And yet not one of them claims to have seen a swimming pool of blood!\nGregson:\n......... Well, no...I suppose not...\nHarebrayne:\nYou see?! Not one!\nJuror No. 4:\nHm... True, I didn't see anything like that...\nRyunosuke:\n(Well done, Professor! That was a great counter-argument!)\nJudge:\nOrdaaar! Ordaaar!\nVan Zieks:\n...Pray forgive the discourtesy if I savour a drop from my hallowed chalice to accompany my old friend's adducing.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nHere's to you, Albert!\nHarebrayne:\nOh, you're too kind, Barok! But I'm really not a patch on you...\nVan Zieks:\nNo, you're not.\nHarebrayne:\nNo?\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nYou've neglected to mention one crucial possibility.\nHarebrayne:\nI have?\nVan Zieks:\nA particular situation in which very little bleeding would result from a stab wound.\nGregson:\nAh! Of course!\nVan Zieks:\nInspector, enlighten the court, please.\nGregson:\nYes, sir!\nRyunosuke:\n(Where are they going with this?)\nJudge:\nVery well. You will amend your formal testimony now, Inspector Gregson.\nChanges statement from \"So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it!\" to \"The weapon the victim was stabbed with must have been left in his body whilst he was beamed through the air!\"\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nVan Zieks:\nMy learned friend's silence is your answer, Inspector.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh... (Can't a man have a moment to think?)Gregson:\nThe weapon the victim was stabbed with must have been left in his body whilst he was beamed through the air!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWhy would you think that, Inspector?\nGregson:\nWith any wound, it's only when you pull the weapon out that profuse bleedin' occurs. Whilst it's still lodged in the body, it acts as a stopper of sorts, for want of a better word.\nRyunosuke:\nI, I see...\nVan Zieks:\nYou don't need a medical degree to be aware of this fact. It's common knowledge for any investigator.\nRyunosuke:\n(Ugh, where's Susato-san when you need her?)\nGregson:\nIf you ask me, this bloke masked what he was doin' from view with his body before stabbin' Asman in the chest. Then he beamed the victim off the stage with his fancy device, the screwdriver still where he planted it.\nHarebrayne:\nI, I would never do such a thing! Not to my precious tools! I would never use them for such dirty work! You only use tools for their intended purpose! That's common knowledge for any scientist!\nVan Zieks:\n...The fact remains, the lack of blood at the scene can easily be explained. As the prosecution has demonstrated.Present Screwdriver (after examining handle)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You say that while the weapon remains in the body, there's very little bleeding...\"Ryunosuke:\n(So that's all the testimony I have to work with... I had no idea the victim had been stabbed. That changes everything... Did van Zieks keep that to himself until now on purpose, to gain the advantage? Oh well...I suppose all I can do is press these witnesses for as much new information as possible.)Ryunosuke:\nYou say that while the weapon remains in the body, there's very little bleeding... Is that unequivocal?Gregson:\nLook, there was no blood on the experimentation stage, even though that's where the fellow was stabbed. The only explanation for that is if the screwdriver was still in his body, stoppin' any heavy bleedin'.Van Zieks:\nIt's common medical knowledge, my learned friend. Even on your side of the world.Ryunosuke:\n......... Yes, but about this screwdriver... The thing is, we actually saw it at the scene ourselves. On the experimentation stage.Van Zieks:\nWhat?Ryunosuke:\nIt was on the floor by the wreckage of the machine, poking through a metal grille. I went to pick it up, but the detective here stopped me. Isn't that right, Inspector Gregson?Gregson:\nAh, well, um... Now you come to mention it, yes...Van Zieks:\nInspector, are we to understand that you permitted the defence counsel to investigate? That you contravened the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act?Gregson:\nEh? No! Not at all! I, I wouldn't do that! I just let him look, nothin' more! I was very clear he wasn't to touch a thing!Ryunosuke:\nYes, that's true. This screwdriver was in plain sight on the stage. But it shouldn't have been, should it?Gregson:\nWh-What are you gettin' at?Ryunosuke:\nIf this tool had still been in the victim's body when the victim was beamed away by the machine... ...then it shouldn't have still been on the stage.Gregson:\nAh!Ryunosuke:\nThat's right! It should have been beamed across to the Crystal Tower along with Mr Asman... ...and been found still lodged in the victim's chest!Gregson:\nUgh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!Judge:\nOrdaaar! Ordaaar! ...How do you explain this, Inspector?Gregson:\nI...well...um... I don't...Ryunosuke:\nIt looks as though everything that the victim had on his person moved with him when he was 'beamed'. If the screwdriver was still in his chest when the instantaneous kinesis occurred... ...obviously that should have been beamed to the destination as well!Gregson:\nYou...Ryunosuke:\n(This is a strange situation... Even though people are saying that this instantaneous kinesis is a scientific impossibility... ...we're still basing arguments on the assumption that it did actually take place. Alright. Time to tighten the screws here...) My Lord! If the prosecution is unable to explain this inconsistency in its argument... ...we can only conclude that the testimony given in support cannot be relied upon!Van Zieks:\n.........Ryunosuke:\n(Lord van Zieks is stumped!)???:Judge:\n...Do you have something to say, witness?Harebrayne:\nYes...I knew it... It bears out... The equations hold... Mr Naruhodo! ...DON'T WORRY!Ryunosuke:\n...About what?!Harebrayne:\nWithout delving into the details, there is no inconsistency!Ryunosuke:\nWhat?Harebrayne:\nEven if Andrew had been lodged in Mr Asman's chest... ...my trusty tool wouldn't have moved. Andrew remaining on the stage is consistent with my calculations!Ryunosuke:\nWha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!Van Zieks:\nIt would seem your illusions have been...shattered. Clearly we should hear the accused's explanation. ...Or should I say, this brilliant scientist's explanation?Judge:\nHmmm...Ryunosuke:\n(Just when I'd found an inconsistency in the prosecution's argument... Scientists...)Judge:\nVery well! The defendant will testify again. Provide us with the scientific explanation as to why the inconsistency asserted by the defence fails to hold!Harebrayne:\nIn the name of Apollo, I will, My Lord!Witness Testimony\n- The inconsistency Explained -Harebrayne:\nTo be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research.\nMy hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put.\nIn other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all.\nMr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible.\nNow I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together!Ryunosuke:\n.........Van Zieks:\n.........Judge:\n......... So, the thrust of your testimony, Professor, is...?Van Zieks:\n...That based upon his hypothesis, metal objects cannot be moved by this method of instantaneous kinesis.Judge:\nIn other words...?Van Zieks:\nIn other words, since the screwdriver is made of metal, even if it remained lodged in the victim's chest... ...its subsequent discovery on the stage despite the victim being found elsewhere is not an inconsistency.Judge:\nAnd therefore...?Van Zieks:\nAnd therefore Professor Albert Harebrayne could still have been the killer.Harebrayne:\nMy great hypothesis holds, you see! We, we had to make the cage used to contain the subject from wood for that very reason.Judge:\nI was not addressing you, witness!Ryunosuke:\nUm...Professor Harebrayne...Harebrayne:\nYes?Ryunosuke:\nWhose side are you on here?Harebrayne:\nI don't take sides, Mr Naruhodo! No no no! My only interest lies in upholding my hypothesis! I'm a scientist, after all!Ryunosuke:\n......... (Is he working for us or against us?

And we only ever discussed my hypothesis and the project...and the research grant, of course.Present Photograph of the Victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Professor Harebrayne, you say that according to your hypothesis...\"Harebrayne:\nMr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nHow did you come to know Mr Asman in the first place?\nHarebrayne:\n...A year ago now, a small provincial science journal published a little paper about my work.\nJudge:\nThat's a scientific journal? Good gracious, I should need new spectacles!\nHarebrayne:\nI might have had an extraordinary hypothesis and great promise, but at the time, I had no money. I, I had to eat tiny little meals at a tiny little café and drink watered-down water out of a tiny little glass... But...Mr Asman read the paper and came to visit me at my tiny little laboratory!\nVan Zieks:\nAnd offered you money to help fund your work?\nHarebrayne:\nExactly! That's exactly what happened! I handled the theoretical side of things, and Mr Asman provided me with an engineer for the practical. ...And the three of us produced that fantastic machine together!\nRyunosuke:\nThe machine that you brought to the Great Exhibition to demonstrate.\nHarebrayne:\nWe, we had to apply to the government for some sort of inspection to be allowed to exhibit, I think. I didn't understand all that side of things. Mr Asman took care of all of it. He was a wonderful man! Really, I owe him everything.Harebrayne:\nNow I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWhen you say that you built the machine together, does that mean that you were involved in its construction?\nHarebrayne:\nYes! ...W-Well, not exactly... I'm not good with the practical side of machines myself. So the physical construction was done by an engineer.\nVan Zieks:\nLittle remains of your creation now, though, following the explosion. Repair will no doubt be impossible.\nHarebrayne:\nYes, yes, I realise that. But still... If, if someone were to gather all the broken parts, they could discover the secret of my hypothesis! But Mr Asman and I toiled over that machine for so long. We put our hearts and souls into it! I have to protect our work. So what's left of the machine must be kept safe! That's only fair! Because what happened was an accident!Ryunosuke:\n(That's the extent of the testimony then... Thank goodness for that. I don't want him doing any more damage. He's already basically proven that he could have been the culprit. But it seems as though all he really cares about is defending his hypothesis. Still, I wonder... What if his hypothesis is just fundamentally flawed?)Ryunosuke:\nProfessor Harebrayne, you say that according to your hypothesis... ...nothing made of metal can be beamed by instantaneous kinesis using the machine you made. Is that right?Harebrayne:\nYes, that's right. Spot on! Exactly correct!Ryunosuke:\nIn that case...I'd ask you to have a look at this photograph that was taken at the scene. In particular, I'd like you to pay attention to the victim's face. You can clearly see that Mr Asman is wearing a pair of spectacles...with a metal rim.Harebrayne:\nWhat? Metal? No... Metal can't... That's not... M-Metal? NOOOOOOOOOOOO!Ryunosuke:\nWe've already established that the proposed murder weapon, the screwdriver, was found on the stage. However, if your hypothesis correctly predicted that outcome... ...it should also have predicted...that the metal-rimmed spectacles would be found in the same place!Harebrayne:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAH! My hypothesis! MY HYPOTHESIIIIIIIIIS!Ryunosuke:\nProfessor Harebrayne, this isn't easy for me to say... ...but your hypothesis...is clearly flawed!Harebrayne:\nUWAAAAAAAAAGH!!!Judge:\nOrdaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Counsel, what is the implication of this?Ryunosuke:\nIf, on the day in question, the alleged instantaneous kinesis never actually took place... ...then it's entirely possible that the victim was killed somewhere other than on the stage. And in that case...someone other than the defendant could have been the culprit!Harebrayne:\nBut, but my hypothesis! My hypothesis is sound! I proved it that day! The experiment was a success! The experiment was proof of all my work!???:Juror No. 4:\nIf I could say something here, in my capacity as a fellow of the Royal Society...Judge:\nYes, juror number four? Go ahead.Juror No. 4:\nAs a man of science, there's one thing I simply cannot abide... And that's a fraud who PRETENDS to be a fellow man of science!Harebrayne:\nWhat? Wait! Great Scott! Are you suggesting my science is suspect?!Juror No. 4:\nIt's just been disproved, hasn't it? In front of all of us. In other words, the whole demonstration was a complete nonsense from start to finish! Believe me, my fellow jurors, when I tell you that this man is a heel, a bounder and a fraud!Juror No. 1:\nI say the wreckage of that machine should be stripped down and thoroughly examined!Harebrayne:\nNooo! Never! That machine is the essence of my entire hypothesis! It's protected by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act!Juror No. 6:\nWhat the devil is that blasted act all about, eh? Who made up such a daft rule?!Ryunosuke:\n(I don't like the way this seems to be going... What's the best way for me to help the professor?)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Professor Harebrayne has yet to perfect his invention!\"Wait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(Maybe I should watch and wait for the time being...)\nJuror No. 1:\nMy feeling is that the machine requires a thorough examination.\nJuror No. 2:\nBut what about this 'special dispensation' that's been mentioned? Oh gosh...this is all too much.\nJuror No. 4:\nIf it's determined that the machine itself was the murder weapon, I think you'll find that act won't apply.\nJuror No. 6:\nOf course it was the murder weapon! Anyone can see that, as plain as day!\nJuror No. 1:\nSo we're all in agreement, are we? That the machine should be stripped?\nRyunosuke:\n...! (If, if I don't do something, they'll...)\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Professor Harebrayne has yet to perfect his invention!\"Ryunosuke:\nProfessor Harebrayne has yet to perfect his invention! That would seem to be the case, yes. But even so...Van Zieks:\nEven so, what?Ryunosuke:\nGoing to such trouble and expense to create a fake machine to display in public... He would have absolutely no reason to do such a thing!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nHe had an obvious reason to do exactly that. For the research grant money.Ryunosuke:\nAh!Juror No. 4:\nIf the government was foolish enough to have deemed the man's ridiculous notion plausible... ...he and his conspirators would have received a handsome sum indeed.Harebrayne:\nC-Conspirators?Juror No. 2:\nWhat would be the value of such a grant? Ten pounds?Juror No. 4:\nYou're an order of magnitude out, madam. Five hundred pounds a YEAR!Juror No. 5:\nOoh arrrrrr! Ya could live 'andsome on that much for years!Juror No. 4:\nThe Society's noticed an increase in bogus public demonstrations in the field of science recently. And plenty of scientists arguing with each other to get the largest slice of the funding cake. People's greed is plenty motive enough for murder, I assure you!Harebrayne:\nNo no no! I haven't deceived anyone! Least of all the government! My hypothesis is sound! The science is sound! Please, you must believe me!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nNo matter how unbelievable this hypothesis may seem to you, ladies and gentlemen... ...the fact remains that the victim was transported instantly to the Crystal Tower. Which means that the experiment...was a success.Harebrayne:\nAh, Barok!Van Zieks:\nAnd therefore... ...the only person who could possibly have committed this murder...is the accused!Harebrayne:\nAh. Barok...Ryunosuke:\n(Where is this heading? I have no idea...)Van Zieks:\nMy Lord, if I may...?Judge:\nYes, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution would like to summon new witnesses to the stand.Judge:\nNew witnesses? What would be the nature of their involvement?Van Zieks:\nThey were spectators of the demonstration at the exhibition. Who were occupying special seats.Ryunosuke:\nEyewitnesses?Judge:\nVery well, the court grants the prosecution's request. I should very much like to hear from eyewitnesses to the incident.Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution's stance is clear. This experiment was no postiche. The accused killed the financier victim there on the public stage, before the very eyes of the spectators. Now, my learned friend...Ryunosuke:\nOh! ...Yes?Van Zieks:\nIt's time for you to make your own stance clear.Ryunosuke:\n(There's clearly a flaw in the professor's hypothesis. I can definitely see that. But where does that leave me...?)Judge:\nWe shall take a short recess now. During which time, the prosecution will prepare its new witnesses to take the stand.Van Zieks:\n...As you wish, My Lord.Judge:\nGood. In that case, court is adjourned for twenty minutes.To be continued...23rd October, 10:44 a.m.\nThe Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberHarebrayne:\nM-Mr Naruhodo... ...what on earth were you playing at just now? Or rather... ...WHAT ON EARTH WERE YOU PLAYING AT ALL ALONG?! MY HYPOTHESIS! MY AMAZING HYPOTHESIS! You've been picking holes in it from the start!Ryunosuke:\nAh, sorry about that.Harebrayne:\nBut you promised me! You, you said you'd prove that dratted explosion was an accident, not murder. You said you'd keep my precious invention from falling into anyone else's hands! But all you've done so far is try to undermine me!Ryunosuke:\n......... Yes, I did make you a promise, you're right. I said that I'd believe in you and fight for your freedom to the very end. But I also told you I was no scientist. I don't understand your hypothesis. The fact is, there's an undeniable flaw in your logic, isn't there?Harebrayne:\nAh! But! If I just run through some equations... Yes, you see! It's because my work is incomplete!Ryunosuke:\nPerhaps it is. Nevertheless...a man died as a consequence, didn't he?Harebrayne:\nOh. OOOOOOOOOH NOOOOOOOOO! ......... You're right. You're so right. It's all my fault... And I have no right to blame you for my failures. I'm a disaster! Not just as a scientist...but as a human being!Ryunosuke:\nWell...that might be a little over the top.Harebrayne:\nAnd while we're on the subject... ...wh-what about Barok? He's being awful!Ryunosuke:\nClaiming his old university friend to be a murderer, you mean?Harebrayne:\nHe's a disaster! Not just as a prosecutor...but as a human being! Oh! But no! Wait! He's the Reaper, isn't he? Perhaps he's not classified as Homo sapiens any more...?Ryunosuke:\n(...Glad that's cleared up...) ......... Can I double-check something with you?Harebrayne:\nAh. Yes? What?Ryunosuke:\nThe machine and demonstration you prepared... They were based entirely on your hypothesis, I presume? There was no...trickery involved?Harebrayne:\n......... I drew the plans for the machine with my very own hands. Every line was painstakingly drawn with the firm belief that science is the only future. So yes, it's true that my hypothesis hasn't reach [sic] maturity yet, but please, Mr Naruhodo...you must believe in it.Ryunosuke:\n......... Alright, Professor, I understand.Bailiff:\nCounsel! Defendant! The prosecution's witnesses are ready to take the stand. Court is about to be in session again. Make your way into the courtroom, please!Ryunosuke:\n(It all hinges on that demonstration. If the professor's hypothesis is sound as he claims... ...it leaves him as the only person who could possibly have killed the victim. But on the other hand, Mr Sholmes was adamant...)Sholmes:\nA practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible.Ryunosuke:\n(So really, what should I be trying to prove here?)23rd October, 11:00 a.m.\nThe Old Bailey CourtroomJudge:\nIn the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby reconvene the proceedings of this court. Counsels for the defence and prosecution, are you ready for the new witnesses to testify?Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution is ready, My Lord.Ryunosuke:\nAs is the defence, My Lord.Judge:\nSo, Lord van Zieks... ...I believe these next witnesses saw the demonstration on the day in question with their own eyes?Van Zieks:\nIndeed they did. And as luck would have it, one of them is a police detective. ...So the testimony we are about to hear can be considered highly reliable.Ryunosuke:\n(Perfect. A detective of all people...)Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution's stance remains unchanged. Though it ended in tragedy, the demonstration on the day in question was scientifically sound. And consequently... ...the sole person with the opportunity to have committed this act of murder... ...is the only other individual to have been present on the stage at the time: the accused.Judge:\nThank you, Counsel. The prosecution's position is clear. So, bring forth your witnesses now.Van Zieks:\nBailiff, show the witnesses in. The witnesses whose proximity to the incident on the day in question will clarify the truth unequivocally.Van Zieks:\nWitnesses, state your names and occupations for the court to hear.Lune:\nMy name is Balthazar Lune. I am...the impresario of all the hot-air balloons in vicinity of the esperimento stage.Gotts:\nMein name ist Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond Ormstein. I have come to see ze Great Exhibition all ze vay from my home in Bohemia. ...I'm very rich.Gina:\nInspector Gina Lestrade, Scotland Yard. I'm a great detective. Even 'Erlock Sholmes agrees. I was on security duty at the exhibition...and I got to go up in one o' them balloons! It was amazin'!Ryunosuke:\n(Gina...again. But she did mention that she'd seen the disaster from up in a balloon actually, didn't she? And she clearly loved every minute of it.)Van Zieks:\nThere were three balloons flying near the public experimentation stage when the incident occurred. Two of these witnesses were in one such balloon at the time, and saw events unfold from the skies above.Lune:\nYou make it sound like they were in the clouds. It was only an altitude of circa sixty feet. Very low.Gina:\nWell ya can't see nuffin' if ya fly too 'igh, can ya?Ryunosuke:\n(Sixty feet... About eighteen metres, then.)Judge:\nThank you for your introductions. Now, you will give your formal testimony for the court. Kindly describe exactly what you witnessed...especially those of you who had a vantage point above the stage!Witness Testimony\n- The View From Sixty Feet Up -Lune:\nIt was an incidente terribile. I am only grateful that my balloons were not damaged.Gina:\nThere's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us.Gotts:\nAnd from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere!Lune:\nThe cage, it fell from the sky like a stone. And crashed into the Crystal Tower!Gina:\nI didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower.Judge:\n...A most extraordinary collective account, I must say.Ryunosuke:\nCould I just clarify something? There's a detail in the witnesses' testimony that I've not heard any mention of until now. Specifically, that there were two explosions?Van Zieks:\n...More precisely, two explosions in two separate places, yes. When the demonstration began, the balloon carrying the two witnesses was around...here. There were other balloons in the air nearby at the time carrying other passengers as well, to be clear. Then, as power was supplied to the machine for the demonstration, the first explosion occurred. The so-called 'birdcage' that contained the victim disappeared from the stage, and a moment later... ...the second explosion occurred, directly adjacent to the balloon carrying the witnesses. The birdcage appeared at the site of the explosion, subsequently to plummet down into the Crystal Tower.Gotts:\nI voz very surprised. Suddenly a cage appeared before my eyes viz a person inside. Ze blast voz so hot, but I didn't vant to miss a sing, so I kept my eyes vide! ...I still have lots of money.Judge:\n......... Precisely who is this curious infant?Van Zieks:\nI'm told he is a young noble of Bohemian royalty. Apparently he disguised himself in order to steal unnoticed into the Great Exhibition.Gotts:\nJa, I am here in London on a sightseeing trip viz my elementary school.Van Zieks:\nWe will have the benefit of a child's point of view in the testimony.Ryunosuke:\n(Do we really need that?)Gotts:\nVen I remove my mask, zis is vot I look like.Judge:\nAh yes, I see. A delightful face, I'm sure.Gotts:\nJa, everybody says so.Ryunosuke:\n(Great disguise, then...)Van Zieks:\n...The point is, the testimony of these witnesses further substantiates the facts for the court. Namely, that despite ending in an explosion, instantaneous kinesis was successfully demonstrated. And furthermore, that until the arrival of the police, no one approached the Crystal Tower where the victim fell. Therefore, only the accused, who was with Mr Asman on the stage, could possibly have committed the murder.Judge:\nYes, thank you, Counsel. The prosecution's views on the matter are quite clear. So, the defence's cross-examination now, please.Ryunosuke:\nY-Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination\n- The View From Sixty Feet Up -",

Amazin'!\nRyunosuke:\n(Poor Inspector Gregson...)\nGina:\nSo anyway, I couldn't see the cage that well cos of all the smoke. And I didn't really wanna see, to be honest. I was scared out me wits...\nRyunosuke:\nKeep it together, Inspector...Ryunosuke:\n(The prosecution really is asserting that the demonstration was genuine... But what if it was actually some kind of switch-around trick instead? That would mean that the victim was never actually on the stage in the first place. The two explosions would have thrown everyone watching into a panic for sure. I think I need to find out more about what exactly people saw at the time...)Ryunosuke:\nMr Lune, in your testimony... ...you said that all three of the balloons you had operating at the time were undamaged.Lune:\nSi. That is correct. If they had been caught in the esplosiones, it would have been terribile.Ryunosuke:\nI wonder...if you might know what this is?Lune:\nAh...I think it may be... Si, part of a balloon. A burnt piece of the fabric of the envelope.Ryunosuke:\nSorry? The envelope?Lune:\nPardon. That is the large, round part of the balloon which becomes filled with hot air. It is made from very thick fabric lined with rubber. You do not want it to rip when you are in the sky.Ryunosuke:\n(Just as I thought...) This piece of cloth was found near the experimentation stage. In other words, as Master Gotts testified... ...a green balloon did indeed explode that day.Lune:\nEh?!Ryunosuke:\nIf all the balloons in the sky above the experimentation stage belonged to you, Mr Lune... ...then your statement that they were all undamaged clearly contradicts the evidence!Lune:\nNOOOOOOOOO!If a balloon exploded that day, why didn't the man say so?\nMaybe everyone on board was killed...\nOh no! Having just spent ten whole pounds for the experience?! How awful!\nSeems to me like those things crash fifty percent of the time anyway...Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nThe instantaneous kinesis did occur! But after the explosion on the stage... ...the point of materialisation shifted to a location occupied by a balloon.Judge:\nCausing the balloon to explode? Yes, eminently plausible.Van Zieks:\nAn unfortunate traffic accident, as it were. But it changes nothing about the pertinent facts.???:Lune:\nThis, I cannot accept!Ryunosuke:\nWhy not, Mr Lune?Lune:\nYou are suggesting that I am a liar! That persons died in a balloon incidente!Van Zieks:\nThere's no need to get 'fired up', Mr Lune. The victim was the sole fatality that day.Lune:\nThat's right! And I prove it! Balthazar Lune is not a liar! There was no such balloon in the sky! It is non possible!Ryunosuke:\nYou're saying it's impossible? Why?Van Zieks:\nThis court has more important matters to discuss than the number of balloons that were operating that day.Lune:\nAIIIIIIEEE!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nBut we can't ignore the fact that nobody appears to have known anything about this other balloon until now! My Lord! The defence calls for further testimony from Mr Lune!Judge:\nI concur. There is clearly more to the truth here than meets the eye. It's imperative that we clear up the issue of this phantom balloon, I feel. Witness, you will give supplementary testimony about the balloons you were operating at the exhibition.Lune:\nAh...grazie, My Lord!Witness Testimony\n- Mr Lune's Balloons -Lune:\nAs I said, Balthazar Lune is no liar! Every balloon I had in the sky landed safely!\nAll three of my balloons were carrying passengers. If they fell to the ground in an esplosione, what a catastrofe!Gina:\nBut ya can't get away from the fact that a burnt-up bit o' cloth was found at the scene, can ya?\nThe coppers at the Yard reckoned it was prob'ly some debris thrown from the explosion on the stage.Lune:\nThis stupido ragazzo is mistaken! My balloons have the red and blue zigzag stripes anyway!Judge:\nHmmm...so your assertion is that the balloon this child saw was not one belonging to you?Lune:\nSi! Exactamente! If he even saw a balloon in the first place. I do not like the sound of it. It is very bad for business! I have a good mind to sue the land of Bohemia!Gotts:\nIf you attack us, ve vill fight back! It vill be vor! All out vor!Ryunosuke:\n(...What happened to 'all out war'? Mr Lune certainly doesn't appear to be lying. But that doesn't change the fact that the testimony and evidence are contradictory here...)Van Zieks:\nIf the defence is unable to find fault with the witnesses' statements, the court must consider them the truth. ...Think long and hard on that, my learned friend.Ryunosuke:\n(The situation has clearly changed now. I have to get to the bottom of what happened here, no matter what it takes!)Judge:\nCounsel, you may now cross-examine the witnesses.Cross-Examination\n- Mr Lune's Balloons -",

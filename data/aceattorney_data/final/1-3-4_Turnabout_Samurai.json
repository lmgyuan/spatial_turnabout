Whoooooooaaaaaaa!\nGrrrrrraaaaaaaah!\nThe warriors' swords gleam and strike in the moonlight! One has fallen... but who? Only the moon knows!

Stop waving that broom around!\nMaya:\nOh, Nick! I didn't know you were here!\nPhoenix:\nOf course I'm here! What was that surreal show you were watching?\nMaya:\nWhat!? Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people!\nPhoenix:\nYoung...? Like, how young?\nMaya:\nUmm... 10 years old?\nPhoenix:\nThen what the heck are YOU doing getting all excited!?\nMaya:\nHey! I'm only 17! That's seven-\"teen.\" See? I'm a teen! Not like you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHey! Don't talk to me like I'm your grandpa or something. I'm only 24 myself.\nMaya:\nThen watch it with me! He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, \"Steel Samurai\" was no. 1! ([no. 1] written as [no.1] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nI really worry about kids these days.\nMaya:\nGramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office.\nPhoenix:\nI guess... Wish we had some clients!\nPhoenix:\nA month has passed since my trial. Mia's murder was the talk of the town for some time... But no one paid any attention to the Wright & Co. Law Offices... How am I going to pay the rent this month?\nMaya:\nIt'll be okay. I'm sure some big client is just around the corner!\nPhoenix:\nHmph.\nOctober 16, 8:14 AMPhoenix Wright's Bedroom\nCellular:\nBrrrrring... Brrrrring...\n*beep*\nPhoenix:\nH-hello? This is Phoenix.\nMaya:\nN-N-Nick!!!\nPhoenix:\nMaya? What? It's still early...\nMaya:\nI-it's the Steel Samurai! The Steel Samurai got arrested!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? You mean the guy on that show?\nMaya:\nYes! They're saying that the Steel Samurai killed a villain!\nPhoenix:\n... Umm... Isn't that what he's supposed to do?\nMaya:\nYeah, on TV!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, on TV.\nMaya:\nNo! I mean, he actually did it! In real life! He skewered a villain with his Samurai Spear!\nPhoenix:\nI have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.\nMaya:\nJust come to the office, quick! Please, Nick!\nCellular:\n*beep*\nOctober 16, 9:22 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's here... watching television.)\nTV:\nNow for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.\" He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the \"Evil Magistrate.\" His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The \"Samurai Spear\" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.\nPhoenix:\n... This has to be a joke.\nMaya:\nNo, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over!\nCellular:\nBrrrrring... Brrrrring...\n*beep*\nMaya:\nYes... Wright & Co. Law Offices. ... What!? Nick! I-it's the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\nW-what!?\nMaya:\nYes... yes, of course! We'll be right there!\nCellular:\n*beep*\nMaya:\nLet's go, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nGo? Go where?\nMaya:\nThey have the Steel Samurai down in detention!\nPhoenix:\nSo what!?\nMaya:\nSo, I've decided this will be our first case!\nExamine\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nThere's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.\nHouseplant\nPhoenix:\nMia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.\nMovie poster\nPhoenix:\nA poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nMia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nIt's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nWhat should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)\nAny ideas\nMaya:\nWe don't have enough information to make a case yet.\nPhoenix:\nJust admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.\nMaya:\nNo! We just don't have enough information!\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this?\nMaya:\nYou like showing that off, don't you, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(My poor, poor ego...)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this?\nMaya:\nSorry, but I don't see how that will help us figure this out...\nOctober 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh!\nMaya:\nUmm... Is that guy really him?\nPhoenix:\nWhaddya mean \"that guy\"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him.\nMaya:\nUm, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.\nPhoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?\nWill:\nUmm...\nMaya:\nY-yes!?\nWill:\nSomething wrong...?\nMaya:\nN-no! No!\nPhoenix:\n(This is getting off to a great start.)\nWill:\nI know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?\nMaya:\nD-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.\nWill:\nNo, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams.\nMaya:\nOh...\nWill:\nI guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!\nMaya:\nNick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nHe's a good guy! I mean, he's good!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nMaya:\nHe didn't do it!\nPhoenix:\n...\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile for the camera...\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you could start by telling us what happened.\nWill:\nY-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\nThe \"Samurai Spear\"...?\nWill:\nYes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.\nThe Steel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you could explain to me just what \"the Steel Samurai\" is.\nMaya:\nNick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.\nPhoenix:\nHey! Who's \"new to this\"!?\nWill:\nNo, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!\nPhoenix:\nI-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)\nPowers's alibi (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nNow, where were you on the day of the murder?\nWill:\nWell, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)\nWill:\nWhat will the kids think? *sniff*\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nUm, here.\nWill:\nI... I see. ...\nPhoenix:\n(Let me guess... this guy wasn't the top student in improv class.)\nAnything else\nWill:\nI-I'm sorry. I'm sure that's very important and all. I just don't see what it has to do with my problem.\nAfter clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option:\nPhoenix:\nI think I should probably check out the scene of the murder...\nWill:\nRight... Global Studios. I'll draw you a map.\nMaya:\nWow! Nick! Let's go!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm willing to bet 10 bucks she asks for autographs.)\nWright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nSitting around here won't get us anywhere, that's for sure. The studio! We should go to the studio! I'm sure we could find some clues there!\nPhoenix:\n(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)\nOctober 16Global StudiosMain Gate\nMaya:\nWow! So this is where they make the Steel Samurai show! Awesome! Aren't you excited!?\nOldbag:\nHey! You there! You want in, you gotta go through me!\nMaya:\nO-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers.\nOldbag:\nOh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.\nMaya:\nG-gawkers?\nOldbag:\nGawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...\nMaya:\nUmm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say \"no.\"\nPhoenix:\nI dunno! It's possible.\nOldbag:\nHey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today!\nExamine\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nThe computer that runs the studio security cameras.\nOldbag:\nHey! No touching!\nGuard station\nPhoenix:\nThe security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.\nMain gate\nPhoenix:\nThe main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.\nStudio map\nPhoenix:\nAn overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.\nStudio van\nPhoenix:\nLooks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.\nTalk\nThe studios\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you do here at the studios?\nOldbag:\nAt Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...\nMaya:\nNo! You were a star!?\nOldbag:\nOnly a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.\nMaya:\nWo... wow.\nOldbag:\nThis place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...\nPhoenix:\nHammer...?\nOldbag:\nThe victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?\nOldbag:\nHe's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his \"big chance.\" No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...\nMaya:\nWe don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!\nOldbag:\nPowers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.\nMr. Hammer (appears after \"The studios\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of person was Jack Hammer?\nOldbag:\nWhat \"kind of person\"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I have heard of that...?)\nOldbag:\nBut... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.\nReason for suspicion (appears after \"Will Powers\")\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?\nOldbag:\nI was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!\nPhoenix:\nAnd... that person was Mr. Powers?\nOldbag:\nYes. I saw him!\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.\nOldbag:\nOh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.\nPresent\nAnything\nOldbag:\nWhat's that? You giving that to me?\nPhoenix:\n(Absolutely not!)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nOldbag:\nIsn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here. Move along.\nPhoenix:\nUm, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request.\nOldbag:\nHmph! I thought you were suspicious lookin'! Show me a \"letter of request.\" And maybe I'll just let you in.\nMaya:\nThis lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously.\nDetention Center\nWill:\nHello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they?\nMaya:\nN-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nRight, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect.\nWill:\n*sniff*\nTalk\nYour alibi\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?\nWill:\nW-what? No! I'd never do that!\nPhoenix:\nJust now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.\nWill:\nYes. Like a baby.\nPhoenix:\nBut the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!\nWill:\nW-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.\nWill:\nI know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?\nPhoenix:\n(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)\nThe security lady\nPhoenix:\nUmm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...\nWill:\nOh, the security lady?\nMaya:\nShe's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"!\nWill:\nY-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.\nMaya:\nGrr! She's got some nerve!\nPhoenix:\nDo you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?\nWill:\nOf c-course.\nPowers's Request added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(I just hope this will get me past that security lady.)\nThe security lady (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nUmm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...\nWill:\nOh, the security lady?\nMaya:\nShe's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"!\nWill:\nY-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.\nMaya:\nGrr! She's got some nerve!\nPresent\nPowers's Letter\nPhoenix:\nThank you for the letter of request.\nWill:\nShow that to the security lady and she should let you in.\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nPowers's Letter\nPhoenix:\nHey, look what I have!\nMaya:\nHey! The Steel Samurai said we'd need that to get into the studio.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Will Powers said we'd need it...?\nMaya:\nYes, the Steel Samurai.\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*\nStudio - Main Gate\nPresent\nPowers's Letter\nLeads to:\n\"Ma'am, have a look at this.\"\nPhoenix:\nMa'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers.\nOldbag:\nHmm...? Yes, yes. I recognize the bold, childish scrawl.\nGave Powers's Request to the security lady.\nOldbag:\nTo think he would entrust his fate to youths of such unreliable appearance... Really!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnyway, you may pass. But only left from here, toward the studios! No going to the right. That's the Employee Area. \"No one allowed inside, pal\" were my instructions. The good detective told me himself.\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nThere were maps in the security guard station.\nPhoenix:\nHey! Not bad!\nOldbag:\nThose are 50 cents a piece,\nthank you!\nMaya:\nWell, time to go, Nick.\nOldbag:\n50 cents!\nGuidemap of Global Studios added to the Court Record.\nOctober 16Studio One Entrance\nGumshoe:\nHey! Aren't you that murderer from the other day!\nMaya:\nAah! It's that confused detective!\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, you know Prosecutor Edgeworth is all upset, and it's your fault! I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... so?\nMaya:\nHey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work!\nGumshoe:\n!!! ... ... ...\nMaya:\nUm, Detective?\nPhoenix:\nI think you hurt his feelings.\nMaya:\nOh no! I... I'm sorry!\nPhoenix:\nWell, I think his feelings are easily hurt.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart!\nMaya:\nHey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case!\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here?\nMaya:\nUm, well... We're on this case too, pal!\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? Hey! You can't just go saying \"pal\" like that! That's MY endearing character trait!\nMaya:\nI'd say he's a character alright...\nExamine\nBench\nPhoenix:\nI'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here.\nGumshoe:\nHey, good idea, pal!\nMaya:\nDetective! Aren't you on the case?\nGumshoe:\nW-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!\nLeft path\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.\nStatue with broken head\nPhoenix:\nThe studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]\nMaya:\nWhat's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.\nGumshoe:\nOh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nHey, there's a camera here.\nGumshoe:\nThat's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!\nPhoenix:\nThere's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.\nStudio One entrance\nPhoenix:\nThe entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.\nMaya:\nLet's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.\nWelcome sign\nMaya:\nThere's a big welcome sign above the path.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.\nMaya:\nHuh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?\nPhoenix:\nYeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?\nTalk\nThe investigation\nPhoenix:\nSo, how is your investigation going, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.\nMaya:\nNick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?\nPhoenix:\nRight. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?\nGumshoe:\nWhat I got?\nPhoenix:\nThe autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...\nGumshoe:\nHmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nThe investigation (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo, how is your investigation going, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nI'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh well, it was worth a try.)\nReason for arrest\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Powers arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSimple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.\nMaya:\nNick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!\nPhoenix:\nThanks for cheering me up...\nThe security lady\nPhoenix:\nAbout the security lady...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? A-are we talking about the same person?\nGumshoe:\nWhen I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!\nMaya:\nRemember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.\nGumshoe:\nShe even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!\nMaya:\nWhaat!?\nDecisive evidence (appears after \"The security lady\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of evidence!?\nGumshoe:\nWell, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!\nMaya:\nWhat! Who took that!?\nGumshoe:\nSee the camera up on that gate, pal?\nMaya:\nThe gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!\nMaya:\nOh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!\nPhoenix:\n(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)\nGumshoe:\n...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nDetective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.\nGumshoe:\nUh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!\nPhoenix:\nI'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...\nMaya:\nMaybe it should just be a big \"L\" for \"Lawyer\"?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I'm not so sure about that.\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, Detective. Any ideas about this?\nGumshoe:\nLook, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?\nAfter clearing \"The investigation\" and \"Decisive evidence\" Talk options:\nGumshoe:\nWhat's wrong, pal? You seem down.\nPhoenix:\nDon't look so happy when you say that.\nGumshoe:\nOh hoh hoh hoh hoh!\nMaya:\nUmm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...\nGumshoe:\nSure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)\nMaya:\nNick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!\nStudio - Main Gate\nMaya:\nNick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...\nOldbag:\nHey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)\nTalk\nPhotographic proof\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?\nOldbag:\nHmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.\nReason for suspicion\nOldbag:\nThis guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe... it was you?\nOldbag:\nGyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.\nPhoenix:\n(She thinks I was joking.)\nMr. Hammer\nPhoenix:\nWas the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?\nOldbag:\nOh, he was the biggest star in the studio!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Was\"? Past tense?)\nMaya:\nOh yes! He was great as the \"Bearded Samurai\"!\nOldbag:\nThat too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the \"Evil Magistrate\"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?\nAutomatic camera (appears after \"Photographic proof\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout the security camera...\nOldbag:\nOh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.\nOctober 16Wright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nWhat's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?\nPhoenix:\nDon't look at me! How should I know?\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think?\nMaya:\nThat photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.\nPhotographic proof\nPhoenix:\nOnly one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.\nMaya:\nI guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?\nMaya:\nOn thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.\nOctober 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nApparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... right.\nGumshoe:\nLook pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!\nPhoenix:\nI have to ask him about that photograph!\nMaya:\nOh well. Let's try again later.\nExamine\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.\nOctober 16Global StudiosEmployee Area\nMaya:\nNick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!\nExamine\nBicycle\nPhoenix:\nLooks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?\nMaya:\nIt makes it a lot easier to go up hills!\nPhoenix:\nDon't people cycle to get exercise!?\nDrain grate\nPhoenix:\nThe metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.\nMaya:\nYeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!\nPhoenix:\nWell, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.\nMaya:\nRight! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!\nGrate\nPhoenix:\nThe grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on.\nLunch table\nPhoenix:\nThe remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.\nMaya:\nMmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.\nPhoenix:\nYou just had a burger!\nMaya:\nYeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.\nPhoenix:\n(What!?)\nStage backdrop\nPhoenix:\nThere's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably \"Neo Olde Tokyo Castle.\"\nDressing room door\nPhoenix:\nThe door to the dressing room. It's not locked.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean \"find\"!?\nMaya:\nYou never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!\nPhoenix:\nWe don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)\nDressing room sign\nPhoenix:\nThere's a sign on the dressing room door. \"Mr. Will Powers\"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.\nDressing room window\nPhoenix:\nA window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.\nStorage room door\nPhoenix:\nThat must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.\nMaya:\nWow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!\nPhoenix:\nUmm, what else would they keep in a film studio?\nVending machine\nPhoenix:\nLet's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!\nMaya:\nW-wait! Look! \"Samurai Soda\"! Nick! Try this!\nPhoenix:\n(Ladies first...)\nOctober 16Global StudiosDressing Room\nPhoenix:\n(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)\nMaya:\nNo one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?\nPhoenix:\nRight, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)\nExamine\nCosmetics\nPhoenix:\nThere's a vast array of cosmetics here.\nMaya:\nOoh! This is the wig he used in \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey\"! Nick! Try this on!\nPhoenix:\nNo. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?\nMaya:\nI, um, kinda like samurai movies.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Kinda\"...?)\nCostume rack\nPhoenix:\nThere's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.\nMaya:\nIt'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...\nPhoenix:\n(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)\nCouch\nPhoenix:\nLooks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...\nMirror\nPhoenix:\nThey always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.\nBag\nMaya:\nHmm? This must be Powers's bag.\nPhoenix:\nHey, don't open that.\nMaya:\nLook!\nPhoenix:\nAn employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says \"Studio One.\"\nMaya:\nLet's take it, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nBorrow it. You mean borrow.\nCardkey added to the Court Record.\nBag (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nI wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?\nPhoenix:\nStop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...\nMaya:\nNick... I'm hungry!\nPhoenix:\nYou just had a burger!\nMaya:\nYeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!\nPhoenix:\n(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nIt's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nCardkey\nMaya:\nOh, hey! That's the cardkey to get into Studio One where the murder took place! Let's go check it out!\nStudio - Main Gate\nPresent\nCardkey\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about this, ma'am?\nOldbag:\nOh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over!\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! No, that's mine!\nOldbag:\nLook, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died.\nPhoenix:\nW... well you'll just have to wait!\nOutside Studio One\nExamine\nStudio One entrance\nPhoenix:\nThe entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.\nMaya:\nLet's go in and check it out, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI wonder if this cardkey we borrowed from the dressing room will work...\n*beep*\nPhoenix:\nIt opened!\nMaya:\nAlright! We're in!\nPhoenix:\n(She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.)\nPresent\nCardkey\nMaya:\nHey, Detective! Take a look at this!\nGumshoe:\nWhazzat?\nPhoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! Don't show him that! He'll confiscate it!\nMaya:\nAww... I just wanted to show it off.\nAfter examining Studio One entrance in Studio One Entrance:\nOctober 16Studio One\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYou're real quiet all of a sudden.\nMaya:\nDoesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real!\nPhoenix:\nWell, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...\nExamine\nDirector's chair\nMaya:\nHey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nReady, Nick? Action!\nPhoenix:\n(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)\nFilm camera\nLeads to:\n\"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\"\nReflecting screen\nMaya:\nWhat's this?\nPhoenix:\nThat's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.\nMaya:\nHuh.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?\nMaya:\nWell, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n(I think she's being serious...!)\nStage backdrop\nPhoenix:\nLooks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.\nMaya:\nOf course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?\nMaya:\nNot Olde Tokyo, Nick! \"Neo\" Olde Tokyo!\nPhoenix:\nOh. Right.\n(Step)ladder\nMaya:\nLook, a ladder!\nPhoenix:\nThat's a \"step\"-ladder.\nMaya:\nSo? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nR-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)\nTape outline\nPhoenix:\nThey outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...\nMaya:\nWow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\nPhoenix:\nYeah! So don't touch it!\nMaya:\nWhoa! It's heavier than I thought...\n???:\nHey! You! No touching that!\nPhoenix:\nAh, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...\nMaya:\n\"Y'know\"!? No I don't know!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... who are you?\nPenny:\nWho me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera.\nMaya:\nWe're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.\nPenny:\nOh, you're WP's people.\nMaya:\n\"WP\"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.\nPenny:\nI don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.\nMaya:\nDon't worry, leave it to us!\nTalk\nThe day of the crime\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me anything about the day of the murder?\nPenny:\nYes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.\nMaya:\nOnly one assistant!?\nPenny:\nYes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.\nMaya:\nOh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)\nPenny:\nIn the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.\nPhoenix:\nThe employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?\nPenny:\nYes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.\nWill Powers\nPhoenix:\nDid you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?\nPenny:\nNo! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?\nPhoenix:\nW-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUm, any thoughts about this?\nPenny:\nSorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\nWhat do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nPenny:\nUmm... Sorry... I know you're busy.\nPhoenix:\nNot really.\nPenny:\nActually, there's been something bothering me.\nMaya:\nAh hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!\nPenny:\nWell, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...\nPhoenix:\nYou \"sensed\"?\nPenny:\nYes, several times.\nPhoenix:\nSome other studio employees, maybe?\nPenny:\nNo, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.\nPhoenix:\nR-really!?\nMaya:\nBut wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you're right.\nPenny:\nI'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.\nMaya:\nNo, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!\nTalk\nSensing someone\nPhoenix:\nSo you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?\nPenny:\nYes... I think.\nPhoenix:\n(\"I think\" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.)\nMaya:\nNick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them!\nOctober 16Global StudiosMain Gate\nOldbag:\nWhat? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost!\nTalk\nAssistant's claim\nLeads to:\n\"What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!\"\nOldbag:\nWhat? I saw that suspicious look on your face!\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?\nOldbag:\nSure as can be!\nMaya:\nBut we have a witness who thinks there was \"someone from outside\" here that day.\nOldbag:\nWhat!?\nMaya:\nAre you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?\nOldbag:\n...\nMaya:\nMa'am?\nOldbag:\nWho was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?\nMaya:\nEek!\nOldbag:\nAlright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?\nMaya:\nUh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.\nOldbag:\nHer! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!\nPhoenix:\nShe left...\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!\nExamine\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nThe computer that runs the studio security cameras.\nMaya:\nNick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)\nTry it\nPhoenix:\nOkay. Let's give it a try.\nMaya:\nYou know how to work these things, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)\n[Please enter the number of the security camera.]\nST1-703\nPhoenix:\nThere! Entered!\nMaya:\n... ... Nothing happened.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Maybe I got the number wrong.\nMaya:\n*sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again?\nLeads back to examination\nST1-307\nLeads to:\n\"There! Entered!\"\nST1-370\nPhoenix:\nThere! Entered!\nMaya:\n... ... Nothing happened.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Maybe I got the number wrong.\nMaya:\n*sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again?\nLeads back to examination\nLeave it alone\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I'd better not fool around with this, or that security lady will get me. Maybe next time.)\nMaya:\nWhat? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring!\nLeads back to examination\nPhoenix:\nThere! Entered! ...\nMaya:\nHey! It printed out the data for that day!\nPhoenix:\nLet's see what we got... ... Huh?\nMaya:\nHow is this a picture of Will Powers?\nPhoenix:\nWell, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him.\nMaya:\nI don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]\nMaya:\nWhat does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe there's more photo data from that day?\nMaya:\nNope--that's the only one in the computer.\nPowers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nMaya:\nWe'll put that security lady in her place with this!\nPhoenix:\nRight, we'll put her in her place...\nMaya:\nHey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!\nPhoenix:\nWait. Let's not.\nMaya:\nWhy not?\nPhoenix:\nIt's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.\nMaya:\nNick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!\nPhoenix:\nHey! Why do I have to be the villain.\nMaya:\nRelax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?\nPhoenix:\nI think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?\nTo be continued.\nBefore selecting \"ST1-307\" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate:\nOctober 16Studio One\nMaya:\nNo one's here. I wonder if the security lady got mad at that assistant?\nPhoenix:\nHmm. That's definitely a possibility.\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.\nTurnabout Samurai\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nPart 5\nPart 6\nOctober 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.\nJudge:\nHmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?\nGumshoe:\nYes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)\nSkip it\nLeads to:\n\"I think I can probably remember that...\"\nListen again\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?\nGumshoe:\nI shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)\nLeads back to:\n\"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?\"\nPhoenix:\n(I think I can probably remember that...)\nJudge:\nSo the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval!\nSamurai Spear added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"\nJudge:\nUnderstood.\nEdgeworth:\nLet's call this security officer to the stand!\nEdgeworth:\nWill the witness declare her name?\nOldbag:\n... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!\nEdgeworth:\nY-your name, please!\nOldbag:\nOh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"\nEdgeworth:\nYOUR NAME, PLEASE!\nPhoenix:\n(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)\nOldbag:\nWendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nO-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.\nJudge:\nObjection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.\nOldbag:\nI was just getting to the good part, dearie!\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps we can get to the testimony?\nJudge:\nNow, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?\nOldbag:\nYessey I was.\nJudge:\nAnd to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?\nOldbag:\nYou know your stuff, dearie!\nJudge:\n... You may begin your testimony.\nPhoenix:\n(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witness's Account --\nOldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!\nJudge:\nYou saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nCross Examination\n-- Witness's Account --\nOldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?\nOldbag:\nWell, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.\nPhoenix:\n(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)\nEdgeworth:\nWas there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?\nOldbag:\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nA \"run-through\"...?\nOldbag:\nThey were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.\nPhoenix:\n(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)\nEdgeworth:\nIf there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?\nOldbag:\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of \"errands\"?\nOldbag:\nOh, well, you know.\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nOldbag:\nActually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?\nPhoenix:\nO-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.\nMaya:\nWow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!\nPhoenix:\nYou could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.\nMaya:\nNot a bad idea...\nOldbag:\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nDid you see the victim then?\nOldbag:\nDid I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.\nEdgeworth:\nTell us what happened next.\nOldbag:\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?\nOldbag:\nO-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...\nOldbag:\nI can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!\nMaya:\n\"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you raise an objection?\nJudge:\nSo, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?\nOldbag:\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know that?\nOldbag:\nOh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)\nOldbag:\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n2:00? You're sure?\nOldbag:\nSure as spit!\nJudge:\nWell, who was the man!?\nOldbag:\nReally, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.\nJudge:\n...\nOldbag:\nNow, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!\nPresent Powers's(?) Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"\nOldbag:\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw Mr. Powers?\nOldbag:\nThat's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny?\nMaya:\nNick, this is your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, time to pull out the secret weapon...\nOldbag:\nI'll say it again! It was him!\nPresent Powers's(?) Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"\nMaya:\nNick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?\nPhoenix:\nWindbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.\nMaya:\nUgh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?\nPhoenix:\nLet me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you \"saw Mr. Powers,\" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!\nJudge:\nJ-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?\nPhoenix:\nNone other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the \"Mr. Powers\" that you saw!?\nOldbag:\nOf course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nTrue, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!\nOldbag:\n...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!\nJudge:\nNo one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.\nPhoenix:\n(He's having trouble calling her \"Oldbag\" apparently...)\nJudge:\nHowever, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?\nOldbag:\nHumph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nHuh!?\nPhoenix:\n(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!\nOldbag:\nHow was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me \"this isn't any good as evidence, pal.\" He didn't even give it a second look!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)\nJudge:\nLet's hear about your proof, then.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Man in the Photo --\nOldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...\nI saw Powers trip and fall!\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.\nNow, look at that picture!\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?\nJudge:\nHmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.\nPhoenix:\n(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)\nCross Examination\n-- The Man in the Photo --\nOldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)\nOldbag:\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWho was present at the run-through?\nOldbag:\nWell, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.\nJudge:\nAnd what exactly were you doing?\nOldbag:\nObserving! Just... observing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the assistant?\nOldbag:\nOh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.\nPhoenix:\n(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)\nOldbag:\nI saw Powers trip and fall!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n\"Trip and fall\"...?\nOldbag:\nYes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.\nJudge:\nYou... helped make it better?\nOldbag:\nI kissed it where it hurt.\nJudge:\nL-let's just skip over that part, shall we?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was the assistant then?\nOldbag:\nOh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nEdgeworth:\nYou may continue your testimony.\nOldbag:\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.)\nSamurai Spear updated in the Court Record.\nPress (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail...)\nOldbag:\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWas Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained?\nOldbag:\nNot so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.\nPhoenix:\n(Thus the nap...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked.\nPhoenix:\n(Dragging his foot... okay.)\nOldbag:\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)\nJudge:\nHmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.\nOldbag:\nSee! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!\nOldbag:\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nStill, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!\nJudge:\nHe has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?\nPhoenix:\nWell, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...\nAfter pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:\nEdgeworth:\nI think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell, there is one thing that bothers me.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is?\nJudge:\nWhere is this \"Steel Samurai\" costume now?\nEdgeworth:\nUmm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nAnyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose that's right.\nPhoenix:\n(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)\nObject\nPhoenix:\nHold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.\nEdgeworth:\nThen allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"\nWait and see what happens\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)\nJudge:\nI suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.\nEdgeworth:\nMost perceptive, Your Honor!\nPhoenix:\n(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"\nEdgeworth:\nWill the witness continue her testimony, please?\nOldbag:\nNo need to ask twice!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witness's Account, cont. --\nOldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\nNo one else went there!\nIf they had, I would have seen them!\nJudge:\nHmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this \"Steel Samurai\" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.\nCross Examination\n-- Witness's Account, cont. --\nOldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHow do you know that?\nOldbag:\nEh? Didn't I just explain? I gave donuts to the young detective. And the, after some rubbish about it being a \"secret, pal\" he told me everything.\nPhoenix:\n(I see Detective Gumshoe shares his fellow officer's fondness for donuts.)\nOldbag:\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure!?\nOldbag:\nOh, quite, quite, sonny.

Why, everyone was in the Employee Area before then. And I locked the main gate so no one could get in. Not to mention...\nPresent Powers's(?) Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on!\"\nOldbag:\nIf they had, I would have seen them!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure!?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness has answered the question! Anyone going into the studio had to pass by the witness!\nOldbag:\nThat's right, sonny! You let 'em have it, Edgey-boy!\nPhoenix:\n(E-Edgey-boy...?)\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPresent Powers's(?) Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on!\"\nMaya:\nOld windbag sure has balls! Or... well, you know what I mean.\nPhoenix:\nOld windbags have a way of skipping over important details, after all... Or, for that matter, entirely forgetting them.\nMaya:\nHow convenient.\nPhoenix:\n(Something for you to look forward to, perhaps?)\nPhoenix:\nHold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?\nOldbag:\nYesiree, sonny.\nPhoenix:\nSo, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?\nOldbag:\nAnd here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.\nPhoenix:\nRight... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.\nOldbag:\nOoh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.\nPhoenix:\nThat very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]\nOldbag:\nEven I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!\nPhoenix:\nActually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: \"Photo #2\"...\nOldbag:\n\"Photo #2\"...?\nPhoenix:\nThe computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be \"Photo #1\" if it really was the ONLY photo!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nActually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access-- the security lady herself! (Changed from [Only someone with access... the security lady herself!] in the original release)\nOldbag:\nEh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers!\nPhoenix:\nBut the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!\nOldbag:\nUmm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean...\nJudge:\nCan the witness explain this to the court?\nOldbag:\nUmm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help!\nEdgeworth:\nHuh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either.\nOldbag:\nHumph! Some help you are! You're a whippersnapper too! ... ... Whippersnapper...?\nJudge:\nSomething the matter, Ms. Oldbag?\nOldbag:\nAh! That's right! I... I just remembered something!\nJudge:\nLet me guess... Someone else passed by the gate... someone other than the Steel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nEr... well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way.\nJudge:\n*sigh* I see. Your testimony, please.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Other Person --\nOldbag:\nEvery day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do.\nI go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.\nI throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.\nCome to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!\nEdgeworth:\nM-Ms. Oldbag! This is the first I've heard of this!\nOldbag:\nWell, of course, sonny! I've only just remembered it.\nJudge:\nRight... anyway, Mr. Wright, please begin the cross-examination.\nMaya:\nWell, I'd say this was a turn for the unexpected, but I kind of expected this...\nCross Examination\n-- The Other Person --\nOldbag:\nEvery day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnother \"job\"?\nOldbag:\nT-that's right. I check all the people that passed by the main gate that day. I look closely at every one of the photos that security camera takes.\nEdgeworth:\nDo you backup all of the security camera data?\nOldbag:\nWell, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating.\nOldbag:\nI go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHow many photos are there, usually?\nOldbag:\nOn a day when we're open to the public, we get more than 500 people. But on filming days or rehearsal days... well, we don't have much money. We never get more than 50, and that's a big day.\nEdgeworth:\nDo you backup all of the security camera data?\nOldbag:\nWell, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating.\nOldbag:\nI throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHow exactly do you determine what isn't \"suspicious lookin'\"?\nOldbag:\nOh, you can tell by looking at their faces. For the most part.\nPhoenix:\nF-for the most part? This is a murder trial, Ms. Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nWell, I didn't touch that suspicious lookin' Will Powers's photo, did I?\nPhoenix:\n(I think she's missing the point.)\nOldbag:\nCome to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?\"\nMaya:\n\"Come to think of it\"? Couldn't she think of that a little earlier!?\nPhoenix:\nClassic old windbag maneuver, Maya.\nMaya:\nHmm... Might be a useful tactic to remember for use in my future career as a windbag.\nPhoenix:\n(Let's find out more about this \"erased\" photo.)\nPhoenix:\nWell, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?\nOldbag:\nHumph. A fanboy.\nPhoenix:\nF-fanboy?\nOldbag:\nSteel Samurai fanboys. Real freaks, if you ask me. They get information about the rehearsals from gosh-knows-where. They're always hanging about. One was there that day.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nW-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? \"I locked the main gate so no one could get in\"... Those were your words!\nOldbag:\nWell! If you must know, there's a drain that goes into the Employee Area. The grate has been loose for a while. It leads outside, and well, that's where they come in.\nPhoenix:\nThey come in through the drain?\nOldbag:\nI told you they were freaks. Oh, and...\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nOldbag:\nThey're kids. Children. Whippersnappers.\nPhoenix:\nK-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?\nOldbag:\nIt was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.\nPhoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nO-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?\nOldbag:\nOh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em.\nEdgeworth:\nA boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?\nJudge:\nImpossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy.\nOldbag:\nRight! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data.\nMaya:\nUm, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and they're already trying to \"un-suspect\" him.\nJudge:\nThis court will take a five-minute recess. (Changed from [I'd like to take a five minute recess.] in the original release) I want the defense and the prosecution to consider this new information... And no forgetting vital information this time!\nOctober 18, 11:08 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nPhoenix:\nMr. WP?\nWill:\nY-yes?\nPhoenix:\nTell me straight: were you really in your dressing room? You didn't go to the studio?\nWill:\nI-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest.\nMaya:\nSo who was the \"Steel Samurai\" in that security photo?\nWill:\nHow should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really.\nMaya:\nWhat!? You should take better care of that stuff!\nWill:\nI couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me?\nPhoenix:\nIt doesn't look good...\nWill:\n*sniff*\nPhoenix:\nYou're the only likely suspect, right now.\nMaya:\nNick! W-what are we going to do!?\nPhoenix:\nFirst, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this!\nMaya:\nRight! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day!\nPhoenix:\nRight... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot.\nWill:\nYou... don't sound very optimistic.\nPhoenix:\nI'm not optimistic at all, actually.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. It's time.\nPhoenix:\nOkay. Let's go. *sigh*\nWill:\nWhat does that mean... Please don't sigh like that! *sniff*\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. (Changed from [The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of \"guilty\" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!\nJudge:\nOrder! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.\nPhoenix:\n(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)\nJudge:\nSo, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\nThe assistant girl\nPhoenix:\nIt was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!\nJudge:\nSo you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?\nPhoenix:\nThat's correct, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!\nPhoenix:\nOh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.)\nEdgeworth:\nRemember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!\nOldbag:\nPowers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the assistant?\nOldbag:\nOh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.\nEdgeworth:\nThe assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!\nPhoenix:\nUngh!\nMaya:\nThat kind of takes the legs out from under that case...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)\nJudge:\nMay we move on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.\nJudge:\nVery well. Go ahead.\nLeads back to:\n\"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\"\nThe grade-school boy\nPhoenix:\nIt was the grade-school boy! ... ... ... Why isn't anyone saying anything?\nEdgeworth:\nBah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? \"Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!\" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... maybe that was a dumb move on my part.)\nMaya:\n\"Maybe\"? \"Maybe\"!? How about \"absolutely,\" Nick!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)\nJudge:\nMay we move on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.\nJudge:\nVery well. Go ahead.\nLeads back to:\n\"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\"\nThe security lady\nLeads to:\n\"It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!\"\nPhoenix:\nIt was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nW-who!?\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nW-what!? Whippersnapper!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!?\nOldbag:\nOldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you!\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!\nJudge:\nW-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?\nPhoenix:\nSimple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!\nJudge:\nI see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?\nEdgeworth:\n... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.\nOldbag:\nW-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!\nPhoenix:\n(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)\nPress further\nLeads to:\n\"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\"\nGive granny a break\nPhoenix:\n(I guess this does kind of make it look like she's the killer. Funny, I feel bad for her all of a sudden.)\nJudge:\nHmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.)\nLeads to:\n\"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\"\nPhoenix:\nThe very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!\nOldbag:\nB-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?\nPhoenix:\nYou forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.\nJudge:\nHmm... Indeed.\nPhoenix:\n(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)\nOldbag:\nWait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!\nJudge:\nHe's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?\nOldbag:\nTh-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!\nJudge:\nHmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThat boy is not the killer.\nOldbag:\nWhat!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\nI have proof.\nOldbag:\nP-proof!?\nJudge:\nIndeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?\nPresent Cardkey\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?\nLeads to:\n\"I see!\"\nPresent Powers's(?) Photo or Samurai Spear\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible!\nLeads to:\n\"I see!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis is my proof!\nJudge:\n... I can't see how that has anything to do with this matter, Mr. Wright? Mr. Wright. There aren't that many pieces of evidence in the Court Record. Please try not to pick the wrong ones!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI'll ask again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?\"\nJudge:\nI see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this?\nOldbag:\nMrph.\nPhoenix:\n(The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.)\nJudge:\nVery well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name?\nEdgeworth:\nSomething \"Oldbag,\" Your Honor.\nJudge:\nThen the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned!\nOldbag:\nW-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking!\nMaya:\nOh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!\nJudge:\nMs. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony?\nOldbag:\nActually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about.\nPhoenix:\nN-not to talk about?\nEdgeworth:\nBy whom!?\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)\nJudge:\nW-well, testify!\nWitness Testimony\n-- My Lips Were Sealed --\nOldbag:\nGlobal Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.\nThere were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.\nThey said they had \"nothing to do with it,\" see?\nSo they told me to just pretend they \"hadn't been at the studios that day.\"\nBut if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Oldbag! This is crucial information! Why did you keep this from the court until now!?\nOldbag:\nAin't you been listening? They told me to shut my trap, and I always do what I'm told.\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(No, this isn't a bad dream, Your Honor. Witness the power of the Oldbag...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... Your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- My Lips Were Sealed --\nOldbag:\nGlobal Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, you were told not to talk?\nOldbag:\nThat's right! By the studio and TV bigwigs, no less!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy didn't I hear about this!?\nOldbag:\nDon't be too hard on yourself, sonny. We were all in on it.\nOldbag:\nThere were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nW-who were these people!?\nOldbag:\nWell, the director and the producer, for starters...\nPhoenix:\nThe... director?\nEdgeworth:\nWe should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course!\nOldbag:\nYes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it.\nPhoenix:\nSo, where were these people?\nOldbag:\nThe director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that.\nEdgeworth:\nWhere!\nOldbag:\nOh, in the Studio Two trailer.\nPhoenix:\nS-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?)\nOldbag:\nWell, if you look at the guidemap... Here it is. You go through the gate and all the way to the left.\nPhoenix:\n(The path where the monkey's head was fallen over.)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright... Would you like to continue the cross-examination...?\nPhoenix:\n(I think I've already asked all my questions, but...)\nContinue cross-examination\nLeads back to cross-examination\nTake a break\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor.\"\nOldbag:\nThey said they had \"nothing to do with it,\" see?\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag! This is a trial for murder!\nOldbag:\nI know that, silly! Still, they were pretty convincing about having nothing to do with it. And... they gave me a little bonus on the side.\nPhoenix:\n(So, you got your \"bonus\" and you still talked... Hmm. I think I've asked all the questions I have to ask...)\nContinue cross-examination\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there's no harm in getting as much info as I can!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nTake a break\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor.\"\nOldbag:\nSo they told me to just pretend they \"hadn't been at the studios that day.\"\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo they were actually in the studio!?\nOldbag:\nYes, the whole day. When they heard about the murder, they beat it before the cops came.\nEdgeworth:\n*grumble* (I'll kill this woman, I swear it...)\nPhoenix:\n(I feel sorry for Edgeworth, almost. She really left him hanging on this one.)\nOldbag:\nBut if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n\"Them\"...? W-who were these people!?\nOldbag:\nWell, the director and the producer, for starters...\nPhoenix:\nThe... director?\nEdgeworth:\nWe should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course!\nOldbag:\nYes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it.\nPhoenix:\nSo, where were these people?\nOldbag:\nThe director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that.\nEdgeworth:\nWhere!\nOldbag:\nOh, in the Studio Two trailer.\nPhoenix:\nS-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?)\nOldbag:\nWell, if you look at the guidemap... Here it is. You go through the gate and all the way to the left.\nPhoenix:\n(The path where the monkey's head was fallen over.)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright... Would you like to continue the cross-examination...?\nPhoenix:\n(I think I've already asked all my questions, but...)\nContinue cross-examination\nLeads back to cross-examination\nTake a break\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor.\"\nMaya:\nNick! I guess pressing her was the right thing to do! For an old windbag, she sure likes keeping secrets... Let's get as much information as we can!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. We have learned there were others at Global Studios on the day in question. The director and the producer and, er, some bigwigs, were all present. Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point. The prosecution will gather more information about the witness, Ms. Oldbag... and more information about these other people we have just been told of!\nEdgeworth:\n... I understand, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nThis ends the day's proceedings in the trial of Mr. Will Powers. That is all. The court is adjourned!\nOctober 18, 1:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nWill:\nTh-thank you so much, Mr. Wright. I was right to ask you to defend me.\nMaya:\nAww, really, it's nothing. *grin* Oh, or should I... *sniff*\nPhoenix:\nWe'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination!\nMaya:\nSo, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think, Mr. Powers?\nWill:\nI don't think it was her, really.\nMaya:\nNeither do I, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers.\nMaya:\nPoor old windbag... I feel kinda sorry for her.\nPhoenix:\nWell, she wasn't winning any points in there, with or without my accusation. Okay, let's get down to the studios.\nMaya:\nRight! We'll be back to visit you soon...\nWill:\nTh-thanks. Thanks, guys. *sniff*\nTo be continued.\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?\nJudge:\nUh... I'm not sure I follow?\nPhoenix:\nIt clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...\nJudge:\nYou don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!\nJudge:\n...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really?\nJudge:\nObjection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHow exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?\nPhoenix:\nThey aren't, are they...\nJudge:\nNot at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts.\nPhoenix:\n(W-what!? I see plenty of room! It\u2019s still wide open... no?)\nJudge:\nThis court find the defendant, Mr. Will Powers...\nGuilty\nJudge:\nThe accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!\nTurnabout Samurai\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nPart 5\nPart 6\nOctober 18Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWhew, what a day.\nMaya:\nThis is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?\nPhoenix:\nI guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.\nMaya:\nThe director and producer...?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, them.\nMaya:\nWell, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think we should do?\nMaya:\nW-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here.\nMaya:\nThat's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto!\nAny ideas\nMaya:\nHmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet.\nPhoenix:\nThat's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.\nMaya:\nThere's not enough information!\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nHey, see this?\nMaya:\nYou... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick?\nCardkey\nMaya:\nHey, you still have that! Great!\nPhoenix:\nWell, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell...\nMaya:\nPoor old WP...\nPowers's(?) Photo\nMaya:\nYou know, what if this really was Mr. Powers?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag.\nMaya:\nSo Mr. Powers is... lying?\nPhoenix:\nHe really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...)\nSamurai Spear\nMaya:\nI wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nMe!? Why me!?\nAnything else\nMaya:\nSorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out.\nOctober 18Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nWill:\nOh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier.\nPhoenix:\nNot at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.\nMaya:\nYou can say that again!\nPhoenix:\nLet's not.\nMaya:\nSo, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?\nWill:\nHmm... S-sorry, but no.\nMaya:\nBe sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.\nPhoenix:\nWe can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow.\nWill:\nY-yes... *sniff*\nExamine\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room.\nTalk\nThe fanboy\nPhoenix:\nDo, er, \"fanboys\" sneak into the studios often?\nWill:\nNo, not that I know of. That security lady's pretty strict with them.\nMaya:\nBut, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around?\nWill:\nThe kids really, really love the Steel Samurai. They sneak past when she's not looking, I guess.\nThe director\nPhoenix:\nWas the director present at the morning run-through?\nWill:\nY-yes, yes he was. He was directing how the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate should move.\nMaya:\nWhy didn't you tell us that before!?\nWill:\nW-well, just, the studio asked us to keep quiet...\nMaya:\nThat has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big!\nWill:\nI... I see. *sniff*\nPhoenix:\n(Whose side is she on!?)\nMaya:\nYou aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!?\nWill:\nN-no, I sure hope not.\nPresent\nCardkey\nPhoenix:\nWe found this cardkey in your dressing room.\nWill:\nOh, that's mine, yes.\nMaya:\nCan people outside the studios get these cards?\nWill:\nI don't think so. Even I have to return the card. Once the show's done filming, that is.\nMaya:\nHuh...\nPowers's(?) Photo\nPhoenix:\nRegarding this photograph...\nWill:\nY-yes...?\nPhoenix:\nThis really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right?\nWill:\nR-right. *sniff* I was sleeping in my dressing room the whole time, honest.\nPhoenix:\nBut who else could have worn it!?\nMaya:\nYour costume was in your dressing room?\nWill:\nYes. I guess they snuck in and took it while I was asleep.\nPhoenix:\n(But who!?)\nSamurai Spear\nPhoenix:\nRegarding the murder weapon...\nWill:\nYes?\nPhoenix:\nIs it heavy, that spear?\nWill:\nIt's pretty hefty, yeah. I don't think the average person would be able to swing it around effectively.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nMaya:\nAnd... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through?\nWill:\nOh yes, I goofed on a round kick, you see... I broke the spear. The security lady fixed it for me right away though.\nMaya:\nWith duct tape. We heard.\nAnything else\nWill:\nE-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way I could help you... S-sorry. *sniff*\nOctober 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain Gate\nMaya:\nNo one's here.\nPhoenix:\nRight, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her...\nMaya:\nH-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!\nExamine\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nThe computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day.\nGuard station\nPhoenix:\nThe security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there.\nMain gate\nPhoenix:\nThe main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there.\nOctober 18Studio One Entrance\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.\nMaya:\nSo, Nick... Remember that \"Studio Two\" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think that's what they said.\nMaya:\nMaybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!\nExamine\nBench\nPhoenix:\nI'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit.\nMaya:\nThis is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever.\nPhoenix:\nH-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired!\nMaya:\nNick, when you start having to say \"I'm still young,\" you know it's all over.\nPhoenix:\n(But... but I AM still young!)\nLeft path\nPhoenix:\nIn the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem.\nMaya:\nThis monkey head is real heavy!\nPhoenix:\nWell, it did knock that tree over when it fell.\nMaya:\nBoth of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said.\nStatue with broken head\nPhoenix:\nThe studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before!\nMaya:\nWhy don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing.\nMaya:\nProbably so.\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nThat's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.\nStudio One entrance\nPhoenix:\nThe entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.\nWelcome sign\nMaya:\nIt says \"Welcome.\"\nPhoenix:\nThey let people in here when they're not filming, right?\nMaya:\nNick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?\nPhoenix:\nSure, if that security lady lets us in.\nOctober 18Studio One\nMaya:\nI... don't really want to be in here.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... It is a murder scene.\nMaya:\nI want to go someplace else. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh*...)\nExamine\nFilm camera\nMaya:\nWow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\nPhoenix:\nYeah! So don't touch it!\nMaya:\nHey, smile, Nick, you're a star!\nPhoenix:\nS-stop that!\nReflecting screen\nPhoenix:\nThat's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that.\nMaya:\nHuh.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?\nMaya:\nWell, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n(I think she's being serious...!)\nStage backdrop\nPhoenix:\nLooks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.\nMaya:\nOf course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?\nMaya:\nNot Olde Tokyo, Nick! \"Neo\" Olde Tokyo!\nOctober 18Studio Two Entrance\nMaya:\nThis... is Studio Two?\nPhoenix:\nI thought so...\nMaya:\nIt doesn't really look much like a \"studio,\" does it?\nPhoenix:\nNo, that it does not.\nMaya:\nHey... There's a trailer over there.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer.\nMaya:\nAre we sure this is a studio?\nExamine\nIncinerator\nPhoenix:\nAn incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much.\nLunch table\nPhoenix:\nLooks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.\nMaya:\nHey, so they ate t-bone steaks too.\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it with steaks around here?\nMaya:\nHey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nI... don't know. It just feels \"odd.\"\nNumber \"2\" sign\nPhoenix:\nThere's a big \"2\" painted here.\nMaya:\nProbably because this is Studio Two?\nPhoenix:\nProbably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.\nStudio van\nPhoenix:\nA light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.\nMaya:\nWell, let's go for a drive!\nPhoenix:\nSure... if I had a license.\nMaya:\nNick! You don't have a driver's license!?\nPhoenix:\nBut, look, I have this!\nMaya:\nWhy are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick?\nFlower garden\nPhoenix:\nThere're some flowers here.\nMaya:\nWow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.\nPhoenix:\nDon't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous.\nStorage materials\nPhoenix:\nThese look like materials for making a movie set.\nMaya:\nThey've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.\nTrailer\nPhoenix:\nOn closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set.\nTrailer door\nMaya:\nNick! Let's go inside!\nPhoenix:\nYou think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked.\nMaya:\nAww... shucks.\nOctober 18Global StudiosEmployee Area\nMaya:\nLook, it's that assistant girl. Hey!\nPenny:\nHi... WP's lawyers, right? I heard about the trial! Great job, guys!\nPhoenix:\nOh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it.\nPenny:\nIs it true they caught the security lady!?\nPhoenix:\nOh! Oh... oh hoh hoh!\nPenny:\nActually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain...\nPhoenix:\nYou mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)\nPenny:\nI... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?\nMaya:\nYeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?\nPenny:\nR-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.\nMaya:\nOh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!\nPenny:\nYou're right! I won't!\nPhoenix:\n(Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...)\nPenny:\nUm, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag.\nMaya:\nRight! See you later, then!\nPenny:\nGood luck with your investigation.\nExamine\nTaped cardboard barrier\nMaya:\nSo, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain?\nPhoenix:\nSo it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry.\nMaya:\nHey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in.\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah. I think that was the idea...?\nMaya:\nI feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you?\nPhoenix:\nWhat, you want to rip the grate off?\nMaya:\nReally, Nick? We can!?\nPhoenix:\n(Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...)\nRip it open\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess some things are just made to be broken.\nMaya:\nYay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes.\nPhoenix:\n(Sometimes...?)\nMaya:\nHiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy.\nPhoenix:\nThe things we do...\nLeads back to examination\nLeave it be\nPhoenix:\nNah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who.\nMaya:\nYeah... I guess so.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...)\nLeads back to examination\nDrain grate (after selecting \"Rip it open\" upon examining taped cardboard barrier)\nPhoenix:\nThe drain grate is off. And I know who did it.\nMaya:\nNow the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that?\nPhoenix:\n(Must be nice to live so free of guilt.)\nLunch table\nPhoenix:\nThe remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.\nDressing room door\nPhoenix:\nThe door to the dressing room. It's not locked.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal?\nPhoenix:\nH-hey! We're not thieves!\nMaya:\nBut we did take that cardkey...\nPhoenix:\nW-we borrowed that! There's a difference.\nVending machine\nPhoenix:\nLet's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!\nMaya:\nW-wait! Look! \"Samurai Soda\"! Nick! Try this!\nPhoenix:\nBe my guest.\nMaya:\nOkay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out.\nOctober 18Global StudiosDressing Room\nMaya:\nThis is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.\nPhoenix:\nThat's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.\nMaya:\nBut Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?\nPhoenix:\nHuh... (She's got a point!)\nExamine\nCosmetics\nPhoenix:\nThere's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...\nMaya:\n\"Samurai Boogey-Woogey,\" Nick! Get with the picture!\nPhoenix:\nLook, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!?\nMaya:\nI, um, kinda like samurai movies.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Kinda\"...?)\nCostume rack\nPhoenix:\nThere's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes.\nCouch\nPhoenix:\nLooks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said.\nBag\nMaya:\nMr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked.\nPhoenix:\nMaya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...\nMaya:\nWait... Nick!\nPhoenix:\nW-what now?\nMaya:\nThese snacks... they've passed the expiration date!\nPhoenix:\n... Then don't eat them.\nMaya:\n*grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!)\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nIt's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside.\nStudio - Main Gate (after selecting \"Rip it open\" upon examining taped cardboard barrier in Global Studios - Employee Area)\nPenny:\nOh... hello.\nMaya:\nHo hoh! You look a little out of place.\nPenny:\nIt's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an \"alternative guard fashion\" thing.\nExamine\nGuard station\nPhoenix:\nThe security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.\nPenny:\nOh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew.\nTalk\nThe studios\nPhoenix:\nSo, how are the studios doing?\nPenny:\nThere's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me \"disturbing evidence.\" I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder!\nPhoenix:\nYou mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area?\nPenny:\nYeah. Can you believe it?\nThe fanboy\nMaya:\nDo kids sneak in here a lot?\nPenny:\nWell... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though...\nThe director, et al.\nPhoenix:\nI heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...\nPenny:\nOh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet.\nMaya:\nSo they were trying to protect the director?\nPenny:\nMore the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!\nPhoenix:\n(The producer, huh?)\nPresent\nCardkey\nPenny:\nWow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'm sort of borrowing it.\nPenny:\nI see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful.\nPowers's(?) Photo\nPhoenix:\nCould you take a look at this?\nPenny:\nThat's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind.\nSamurai Spear\nPhoenix:\nSay, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon...\nPenny:\nYou mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around.\nPhoenix:\n(So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?)\nAnything else\nPenny:\nUmm... Not really sure what that is. Sorry.\nDressing Room (after clearing \"The director, et al.\" Talk option in Global Studios - Main Gate)\n???:\nWTF? Who are j00 d00dz!? LMAO!\nMaya:\nH-huh!? W-we... Wait, you first! Who are you!? You look pretty suspicious to me!\n???:\nWhatever, l4m3rs!\nManella:\nHow can j00 not know the great Sal Manella!? I make teh L33T SH0WZ! The Steel Samurai? Mine! RTFC! (Read The Film Credits!)\nMaya:\nR-really!? You're THE Sal Manella!? I'm so sorry! I, just, you looked so... Sorry!\nManella:\nNo no, quite alright. Really. It's fine. ROFL! ...\nMaya:\nW-what is it?\nManella:\nYou know, on closer inspection... Mmm... Yeah... Hot! Hot! Hot! *slobber* Hey, do j00 do a lot of \"cosplay,\" coz that costume r0x0rz!... *drool*\nMaya:\nRocksores!? Wh-wh-what... Hey! You're drooling!\nManella:\nHuh? Mmph! LOL! Buffer overrun! *pant* You've triggered my CR34T1V3 P0W3RZ! Yes... yes, it's coming to me! \"Pink Princess\"! The sequel to the Steel Samurai... \"Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo!\" ROFL... LMAO!\nPhoenix:\nP-\"Pink Princess\"...?\nMaya:\nWhy's it gotta be \"Little\" Olde Tokyo!? Why can't it have a cool name, like \"Neo Olde Tokyo\"!?\nPhoenix:\nMaya, we really need to talk about \"cool\"...\nExamine\nTable\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees.\nMaya:\nH-hey! Nick!\nPhoenix:\nW-what now?\nMaya:\nTh-the snacks! There was twice this much here before!\nManella:\nAh. I, uh, I ate them. They were past their expiration date anyway. ROFL!\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(She's biting her lip and staring at me with tears welling in her eyes...)\nTalk\nThe day of the crime\nPhoenix:\nDid you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder?\nManella:\nOh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right.\nManella:\nIt was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch!\u00a0:(\nPhoenix:\nA t-bone steak, was it?\nManella:\nYeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food...\nMaya:\nNick... what does \"Sucksores\" mean?\nPhoenix:\nNo idea...\nManella:\nAnyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network.\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...)\nThe producer (appears after \"The day of the crime\")\nPhoenix:\nAbout the producer who was at the meeting with you...\nManella:\nOh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\nYou had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?\nManella:\nYeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time.\nThe bigwigs (appears after \"The day of the crime\")\nPhoenix:\nWho exactly are these \"bigwigs\" people keep mentioning?\nManella:\nOh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats*\nPhoenix:\nWere all of them with you the entire time?\nManella:\nYeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl*\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... sounds like they'd all be reliable witnesses.)\nPresent\nPowers's(?) Photo\nManella:\n... T-this is WP, right?\nPhoenix:\nHow do you know?\nManella:\nWell, look, he's obviously dragging his foot.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, right. The director would know about the injury; he was there.)\nAnything else\nManella:\nI try not to pay much attention to things that don't interest me. LOL.\nMaya:\nW-why are you staring at me like that...?\nOctober 18Studio Two Entrance\nPhoenix:\n(This place is deserted...)\n*crash!*\nMaya:\nEek! N-N-Nick! W-w-what was that noise!? It sounded like it came from inside the trailer...\nPhoenix:\nSomeone must be inside...\nMaya:\nH-Hello? ...\nPhoenix:\nNo answer.\nMaya:\nPretty suspicious, if you ask me, Nick! Let's go in!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure we should be barging in... ...Huh. It's locked.\nMaya:\nWhat? Don't we have a key?\nPhoenix:\nNo. But there's probably one in the guard station at the main gate.\nMaya:\nThen what are we waiting for? Let's borrow it!\nPhoenix:\n(If they'll let us...)\nExamine\nTrailer door\nPhoenix:\nThe trailer door. It's locked. The key is probably in the security guard station. I doubt they'd let us borrow it.\nStudio - Main Gate (after visiting Studio Two Entrance and visiting Global Studios - Dressing Room after clearing \"The director, et al.\" Talk option in Global Studios - Main Gate)\nOldbag:\nAh hah! You again!\nMaya:\nEeeek!\nOldbag:\nHow rude, acting like you've seen a ghost!\nPhoenix:\nYou... certainly got back to your post quickly.\nOldbag:\nOh the police took me away, they did. They pulled out a spare Steel Samurai costume! Told me to \"put it on.\" Can you imagine? How could I, a sweet little old lady, wear a giant suit like that?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers is pretty tall...\nOldbag:\nAs soon as they saw there was no way I could wear it, they let me go.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that would rule out her being the murderer.)\nOldbag:\nAnyway! Know this, whippersnapper! This old lady NEVER forgets a slight or insult! And you won't get any information out of me! My lips are sealed!\nMaya:\nYou sure are talking a lot for someone with sealed lips.\nOldbag:\nStarting now! One, two, three, mmmph!\nPhoenix:\n(This lady's too much...)\nExamine\nGuard station\nPhoenix:\nThe security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.\nOldbag:\nHey! No touching!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'd better investigate there later...)\nTalk\nThe Fanboy\nPhoenix:\nUmm, about that kid you said you saw...\nOldbag:\nIf I see him again, I'm taking him down!\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Look at her eyes! She's serious!\nThe director, et al.\nPhoenix:\nAbout the dirctor, the one who was here on the day of the murder...\nOldbag:\nIf I see him again, I'm taking him down!\nMaya:\nNick! I think she's losing it!\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\n(I have a feeling she's not going to respond well to anything I show her now.)\nEmployee Area (after visiting Studio Two Entrance and visiting Global Studios - Dressing Room after clearing \"The director, et al.\" Talk option at Global Studios - Main Gate, then revisiting Global Studios - Main Gate)\nMaya:\nHey! H-hey! Wait!\nPhoenix:\n(I'll bet he came in right through that drain...)\nMaya:\nHey, um, kiddy-o! What's yer name, sport?\n???:\nI'm not a kid, so don't talk to me like that!\nMaya:\nH-huh!? But you... You are a kid! What a rude little brat. That's no way to talk to an adult!\n???:\nI don't see no adults here! Hippie fashion chick!\nMaya:\nH-hippie fashion...? Nick... I think I'm being mocked.\nPhoenix:\n(You got to hand it to Maya, she's pretty sharp. And pretty mad...)\nCody:\nI'm Cody! Cody Hackins. Call me \"kiddy-o\" again and I'll cut you down where you stand, evildoer!\nExamine\nDrain grate\nPhoenix:\nThe drain where the fanboy came in. He didn't waste any time coming in, either. Talk about cause and effect.\nTalk\nThe Steel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're a fan of the Steel Samurai?\nCody:\nHow dare you utter that name, evildoer!\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean? We're on the Steel Samurai's side!\nCody:\nH-hah! Hah hah! You can't fool me!\nMaya:\nOkay... then what's the last line said by the innkeeper in Episode 8?\nCody:\nHah! Easy! \"Like some fries with that?\"\nMaya:\nHmph... not bad, kiddy-o.\nCody:\nWatch it!\nPhoenix:\n(What are they doing!?)\nWhat happened\nLeads to:\n\"Say, you heard anything about the incident the other day?\"\nPresent\nAnything\nCody:\nEvildoers!\nPhoenix:\nSay, you heard anything about the incident the other day?\nCody:\n...\nMaya:\nYou were here, weren't you?\nCody:\n...\nPhoenix:\nDid you see anything...?\nCody:\nHe... he...\nPhoenix:\n?\nCody:\nHe... always... The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Yeah, I saw 'em! I saw everything!\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nCody:\nBut... but no way am I telling you losers!\nMaya:\nWha--!? Wait...\nCody:\nLemme go!\nMaya:\n... He's gone. Huh? Something fell off the table when he bumped into it on his way out.\nPhoenix:\nA... bottle? Why was this sitting there, I wonder?\nEmpty Bottle slipped into pocket.\nPhoenix:\nAnyway, what was that kid saying?\nMaya:\nHe \"saw everything\"...\nStudio - Main Gate\nMaya:\nHuh? Where's that old windbag?\nPhoenix:\nOdd of her to leave her post...\nOldbag:\n(H-hey!!!)\nMaya:\nNick! That was her!\nOldbag:\n(S-stop! Whippersnapper!)\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah. Sounds like she's chasing after that boy.\nOldbag:\nNatch!\nMaya:\nUh oh, she tripped!\nPhoenix:\n(Maya sure looks happy...)\nExamine\nGuard station\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick. Now's our chance! Let's check out the guard station!\nPhoenix:\nGood idea.\nMaya:\n... Oh! This is it, Nick! The \"Trailer Key\"!\nPhoenix:\nThe key to that trailer in Studio Two!\nMaya:\nWe'll be borrowing this, right, Nick?\nTrailer Key slipped into pocket. (Changed from [Trailer Key slipped into your pocket.] in the original release)\nGuard station (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThe security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there.\nOutside Studio Two (after examining guard station in Global Studios - Main Gate)\nExamine\nTrailer door\nPhoenix:\nI wonder if the key we borrowed from the guard station will work? ... It opened.\nMaya:\nGreat! Let's go, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(She seems eager all of a sudden...)\nMaya:\nWell, you first, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, not THAT eager.)\nTrailer door (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThe trailer door. It's unlocked.\nAfter examining trailer door in Studio Two Entrance:\nOctober 18Studio Two Trailer\n???:\n...\nMaya:\nEek! S-someone's in here!\n???:\nNames.\nMaya:\nO-our n-names? Um, w-we're WP's lawyers, and, um...\n???:\nI see. ...\nMaya:\nA-and who might you...?\nVasquez:\nDee Vasquez. The producer.\nPhoenix:\n(Dee Vasquez... She's quite beautiful.)\nExamine\nLeft poster\nPhoenix:\nAnother old movie poster. \"'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?\nMaya:\nOh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know.\nPhoenix:\nSinging samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet?\nMiddle poster\nPhoenix:\n\"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer.\" This poster's quite old.\nMaya:\nWow! It's been years since I saw that show! It was one of those typical summer romance stories... but it was great!\nPhoenix:\nA typical summer romance... with a samurai on a horse?\nRight poster\nPhoenix:\nAn old movie poster. \"'Dynamite Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" I guess Mr. Hammer used to be quite the star.\nTable\nPhoenix:\nThis is where they had that meeting. There are documents and paper cups scattered around.\nTrash can\nPhoenix:\nNothing in here that could be a clue. Just some paper cups and crumpled documents.\nWhiteboard\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like they were designing a set to use for the Steel Samurai show. They've got some figures for how much the set costs... I can't believe they spend that much money on those sets!\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThe glass is frosted. I can't see outside. This far into October, the dimming daylight makes it feel like winter's coming.\nTalk\nThe day of the crime\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering if you could tell me about the day of the murder...\nVasquez:\n... ...\nPhoenix:\nM-Ms. Vasquez?\nVasquez:\nScript.\nPhoenix:\nE-excuse me?\nVasquez:\nScript. I'm looking for a script.\nPhoenix:\nA s-script?\nVasquez:\n\"The Steel Samurai, Episode 13.\" I need it.\nMaya:\nUmm... could we ask you a bit about the day of the murder?\nVasquez:\nI need to read it. ...\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... (We're getting nowhere fast.)\nThe Steel Samurai\nMaya:\nUm, w-we'd really like to ask you about the Steel Samurai!\nVasquez:\n... ...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Vasquez?\nVasquez:\nIt's on TV. Every week. That's all I have to say about that.\nMaya:\nN-Nick! She's telling us to go watch TV!? The nerve of her!\nPhoenix:\nHey, don't get mad at me.\nThe director\nPhoenix:\nAbout the director... Sal Manella, was it? What, er, exactly is his role here...?\nVasquez:\nPerhaps I didn't make myself clear? I'm looking for a script. I can't be bothered with anything else. ...\nMaya:\nNick? Are all people in the entertainment business this... weird?\nPhoenix:\nIt's starting to look like it.\nPresent\nAnything\nVasquez:\nI'm not interested.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\nNick, let's get out of here. Isn't there someplace else we have to check?\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah.\nVasquez:\nWait.\nPhoenix:\nY-yes?\nVasquez:\nIf you see Manella, give him this.\nMaya:\nW-why do we have to do your errands...!\nVasquez:\n...\nMaya:\n...\nVasquez:\n...\nMaya:\nI... I don't think I like her. *sniff*\nPhoenix:\nDon't cry. She'll take it as a sign of weakness. Alright. We'll give it to him if we see him.\nVasquez's Memo added to the Court Record.\nDressing Room\nPresent\nVasquez's Memo\nPhoenix:\nHere. I got this from the producer...\nManella:\nHuh? \"Bring the script for Episode 13\"? Episode 13... where did I put that one? ... I must have left it somewhere... *sweats* U-uh oh... My ass is p0wned if I don't find it... *shakes*\nMaya:\nNick... It might be quicker to just look in all the places where he's likely to have been.\nPhoenix:\nI agree.\nInside Studio One (after presenting Vasquez's Memo in Global Studios - Dressing Room)\nMaya:\nWe're back at the scene of the crime. Let's find what we need and get out of here quick, Nick.\nExamine\nDirector's chair\nMaya:\nHey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these.\nPhoenix:\n(The director...!) Maya... Take a look around that chair for me, would you? Remember that script the director was talking about? Didn't he say he'd left it somewhere?\nMaya:\nAhah! Found it, Nick! The script!\nPhoenix:\nGood work!\nScript placed in pocket.\nDirector's chair (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nHey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nReady, Nick? Action!\nPhoenix:\n(This girl is more troubled than I thought.)\nDressing Room\nPresent\nScript\nPhoenix:\nWe found your script.\nManella:\nW00t! THX! S-still... I dunno... That woman is to be ph34red when you bring something to her late... Say, um, j00 think j00 d00dz could take it down there for me? THX!\nMaya:\nIs that producer really that scary?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, she's certainly not NORMAL...)\nTrailer\nTalk\nThe blocked path (appears after presenting Script)\nLeads to:\n\"On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?\"\nPresent\nScript\nPhoenix:\nHere, we found it! Your script!\nVasquez:\nAh.\nScript handed to Dee Vasquez.\nVasquez:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... Umm... uh... You're not going to talk to us?\nVasquez:\nQuiet. I'm reading.\nMaya:\n...! Just you hold on! What's the big idea!? Who do you think you are anyway!? And, and do you even know who we are!?\nVasquez:\n... Powers's lawyers?\nMaya:\nUmm.... right.\nVasquez:\nAm I a suspect?\nMaya:\nN-no, it's just, well, no, but...\nVasquez:\n... You wanted to know about the day of the murder?\nMaya:\nY-yes. Anything you could tell us would be a big help.\nVasquez:\n... You know there was a meeting here at noon?\nPhoenix:\nYes. With the director and the people from the network...\nVasquez:\nCorrect. Now, listen closely. None of the people in this trailer that afternoon went to Studio One. It was impossible for us to leave.\nMaya:\nImpossible? Why?\nVasquez:\nThe path was blocked.\nPhoenix:\nThe... path?\nPhoenix:\nOn the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?\nVasquez:\nYou saw Mr. Monkey on the way here, correct?\nPhoenix:\nM-\"Mr. Monkey\"?\nVasquez:\nThe monkey with the broken head.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right, that... (What an original name...)\nVasquez:\nIts head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One.\nMaya:\nW-what!?\nVasquez:\nIt's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.\nPhoenix:\nB-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One!\nVasquez:\n2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come.\nOutside Studio One\nVasquez:\n... That's \"Mr. Monkey.\" When it wasn't broken, it announced the time... in \"ooks.\" One \"ook\" per hour. Ook ook ook ook. Always with the ooking.\nPhoenix:\n(It IS a monkey, after all.)\nVasquez:\nCheck its head. The clock inside stopped when it broke.\nMaya:\n...! Nick, it's stopped at 2:15.\nPhoenix:\n2:15...?\nVasquez:\nThat's right. This path was blocked from 2:15 till after 4:00. Therefore, we're innocent.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Hammer died in Studio One at 2:30...\nVasquez:\nSee? Good bye.\nMr. Monkey's Head data added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Mr. Monkey data added to the Court Record.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat do we do, Nick? There isn't anyone besides WP who could have killed Hammer! It's over... We're finished!\nPhoenix:\n(It sure doesn't look good. Guess we should head back to the office and plan our strategy...)\nExamine\nBench\nPhoenix:\nI really want to take a break, but we have work to do! Still, it's kind of sad to see so many empty benches... Kind of like if you threw a party, and nobody came.\nLeft path\nPhoenix:\nThis is the path that goes to Studio Two. The mascot's head fell right on the path on the day of the murder. The path was completely blocked between 2:00 and 4:00.\nMr. Monkey\nPhoenix:\nI see. There's a clock and a speaker in the monkey's head. It would usually tell the time by \"ook\"ing. The clock is stopped at 2:15 now.\nOctober 18Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nNow what... We're fresh out of clues. Everyone's alibi is water-tight. We don't even have any promising leads. Things are looking pretty grim.\n???:\nIt's a little early for giving up, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\n???:\nYou've got one lead...\nPhoenix:\nM-Mia! It's you! What took you so long!?\nMia:\nSorry, Phoenix. Maya has trouble calling me unless she's really in trouble.\nPhoenix:\nRight! Oh, wait. I guess that means we're really in trouble.\nMia:\nI'd say so.\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you mean, we have one lead...?\nMia:\nThe boy, of course.\nCody:\nYeah, I saw 'em. I saw everything!\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nCody:\nBut...but no way am I telling you losers!\nPhoenix:\nI dunno. He didn't sound like he was going to help us at all.\nMia:\nI'm sure you can find some way of bringing him over to your side. Either way, we should get back to the studios. That boy is our last hope, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks, now I'm more worried than I was before...)\nExamine\nHouseplant\nMia:\nMy poor plant! It looks so... so sluggish! Have you been watering it properly, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, Maya has actually... I think maybe she's giving it too much.\nMia:\nThat child! Sorry, Charley.\nPhoenix:\n(The plant's name is... Charley?)\nMovie poster\nPhoenix:\nA poster of an old movie that Mia liked. Oh, hey! Mia, what's the name of this movie?\nMia:\nThat movie...? Oh! I'd sure like to see that one again! It's, um... What was it, again? S-sorry, it's right on the tip of my tongue...\nPhoenix:\n(Let me guess... it's a suspense thriller?)\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSo, what's the best thing to do from here?\nMia:\nWe need to get to the studio and talk to that boy.\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nSo, do you have any ideas about who might have done this?\nMia:\nWe don't have enough information to make a case yet.\nPhoenix:\n(Where have I heard that phrase before? So THAT's where Maya got it from...)\nPresent\nAnything\nMia:\nShowing me that isn't going to do any good. You know what they say, \"Dead men don't tell tales.\"\nPhoenix:\n(You sure are talking enough!)\nOctober 18Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nI guess Mr. Powers is in questioning...\nMia:\nOh well. Let's try again another day, Phoenix.\nOctober 18Global StudiosMain Gate\nOldbag:\nHuff... puff... huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... Huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... puff... huff...\nPhoenix:\nW-what's wrong?\nOldbag:\nHuff... puff... huff... puff... whih... whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(She's been chasing that boy this whole time.)\nOldbag:\nHuff... puff... when... when I ca... catch him... I... huff\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like she hasn't had any luck catching him.)\nOldbag:\nHuff... puff... I...  I got a hostage now, whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(A \"hostage\"...!?)\nTalk\nThe fanboy\nPhoenix:\nUmm... what happened to the boy?\nOldbag:\nI-if I see him a-again, I'll... huff! L-lay him flat! Huff... puff...\nMia:\nMy, what a violent old lady...\nThe director, et al.\nPhoenix:\nActually, I met with the director just now...\nOldbag:\nEh? Hah... my heart, it don't feel so good.\nPhoenix:\n(Is she okay!?)\nOldbag:\nB-before I go, I'd like to v-visit the place where poor H-Hammer died...\nPhoenix:\n(Right... she was saying she wanted to visit the studio where he died.)\nThe \"hostage\"\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this about a \"hostage\"?\nOldbag:\nHuff... huff... W-when that boy was running away... ...he dropped this, a-and ran! Huff... huff... H-he'll come back... huff... huff... for this one!\nPhoenix:\n(It's kind of hard to understand her with all that huffing and puffing.)\nMia:\nPhoenix! That \"hostage\" might be what we need! Cody might talk to us if we gave him that!\nPhoenix:\n(Good idea!) Ms. Oldbag! Might I...\nOldbag:\nNo! I'm catching that brat if it's the last thing I do!\nMia:\nPhoenix. Do you have anything you might trade with her?\nPhoenix:\n(A trade, hmm... I wonder...?)\nPresent\nCardkey\nOldbag:\nH-hey... that... huff... That's a card... huff... Studio One?\nPhoenix:\nRight. A cardkey to Studio One.\nOldbag:\nHuff... puff... I... I could visit poor Hammer... I'd like to visit... huff... he died... whew. I was his... his fan.\nPhoenix:\nYou don't have your own card, Ms. Oldbag?\nOldbag:\nStudio One isn't my turf. Huff... huff... You'll let me borrow... borrow it, then?\nPhoenix:\n(If I give her the cardkey, then I won't be able to get into Studio One...!)\nKeep the cardkey\nPhoenix:\nSorry, we have our own investigating to do there.\nOldbag:\nHuff... huff... puff. Poo.\nPhoenix:\n(Was that last bit a breath, or a pout...?)\nLeads back to Court Record\nLend her the cardkey\nLeads to:\n\"Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?\"\nPowers's(?) Photo\nOldbag:\nI... I told you who I s-saw! Huff! Huff... it... it was Powers!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, at least she's consistent...)\nTrailer Key\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag? I'm borrowing this... just so you know.\nOldbag:\nOh... o-okay... huff. J-just be sure to... huff... give it b-back... puff.\nPhoenix:\n(She's not as demanding when she's exhausted.)\nAnything else\nOldbag:\nHuff... huff... puff... ... huff... puff... haaah! ... Huff.. huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... hooo!\nPhoenix:\n(She's too busy catching her breath to tell me anything!)\nMia:\nWhy don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nI guess it can't hurt. Here you go, Ms. Oldbag.\nCardkey lent to Ms. Oldbag.\nOldbag:\n... Listen to me, sonny. I don't like having debts to no whippersnappers. You take this, and we're even. Deal?\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this...? A Steel Samurai trading card?\nOldbag:\nThat sneaky kid dropped it! I figure it's pretty important to him, though.\nPhoenix:\nThank you, I may have a use for this. (This must be the \"hostage\" she was talking about.)\nSteel Samurai Card added to the Court Record.\nOldbag:\nRight. I'm off.\nPhoenix:\n(There she goes, hobbling off toward the studio...)\nOutside Studio One\nExamine\nWelcome sign\nPhoenix:\n\"Welcome\"... I wonder if the murder will make this place famous, too.\nInside Studio One\nExamine\nDirector's chair\nPhoenix:\nA classic director's chair. I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella.\nFilm camera\nPhoenix:\nA collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure.\nReflecting screen\nPhoenix:\nA panel for reflecting light. They call it a \"reflecting board\" or something.\nStage backdrop\nPhoenix:\nA stage backdrop. This is \"Neo Fujiyama,\" according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind.\n(Step)ladder\nPhoenix:\nA perfectly normal stepladder. I've never actually used one. I don't like heights. I'm a firm belever that humankind was made to keep both feet on the ground.\nOutside Studio Two\nExamine\nLunch table\nPhoenix:\nLooks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.\nNumber \"2\" sign\nPhoenix:\nThere's a big \"2\" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.\nStudio van\nPhoenix:\nA light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.\nFlower garden\nPhoenix:\nNameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation.\nStorage materials\nPhoenix:\nThese look like materials for making a movie set. They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.\nTrailer door\nPhoenix:\nThe door is unlocked. We could probably just walk right in.\nTrailer\nExamine\nLeft poster\nPhoenix:\nAnother old movie poster. \"'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?\nMia:\nIt's a samurai musical set in ancient Japan.\nPhoenix:\nA s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia.\nMia:\nOh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up.\nMiddle poster\nPhoenix:\n\"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer.\" This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years.\nMia:\nThis is one of Maya's favorite movies.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one?\nMia:\nThat... would be kind of sad.\nOctober 18Global StudiosEmployee Area\nPhoenix:\nHey! Hey, you! W-wait a sec!\nMia:\n... Phoenix... Was that the boy?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. His name's \"Cody Hackins.\"\nMia:\nI think he ran into the dressing room.\nExamine\nBicycle\nPhoenix:\nLooks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?\nMia:\nIt makes it a lot easier to go up hills!\nPhoenix:\nWhere have I heard that line before...?\nDressing room door\nPhoenix:\nThe door to the dressing room. It's not locked.\nMia:\nThis is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk.\nStorage room door\nPhoenix:\nThat must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.\nVending machine\nPhoenix:\nLet's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least!\nMia:\nLook at this! \"Spaghetti in a Soda Can\"...?\nPhoenix:\nS-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside?\nMia:\n\"Best when slammed.\" I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...?\nPhoenix:\nSlamming spaghetti. Right...\nOctober 18Global StudiosDressing Room\nPhoenix:\nHe's sure to be in here somewhere... Found you!\nCody:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nDammit! He's getting away!\nMia:\nCome back! ... There. He's back.\nPhoenix:\n(How did she...!?)\nCody:\n...\nMia:\nHey there. Would you mind helping us out? Please?\nCody:\n... I-I'm Cody.\nMia:\nHello, Cody. I'm Mia. Mia Fey. Nice to meet you.\nCody:\nYo.\nPhoenix:\nAnd I'm Phoenix Wright!\nCody:\nWho asked?\nMia:\nPhoenix, you can take it from here.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not so sure I'm qualified...)\nExamine\nCosmetics\nPhoenix:\nThere's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...\nCody:\nYou don't know \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey\"!? You're even lamer than I thought!\nPhoenix:\n(Why does everybody but me know about this show!?)\nPowers's bag\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers's bag.\nMia:\nNow, Phoenix, it's not polite to look through other people's belongings.\nPhoenix:\nH-hey, don't look at me! (Tell that to your sister!)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nThere's a box of snacks on the table, and some cans of soda. They're all empty. I'm glad Maya isn't here to see this. She'd be devastated.\nMia:\nSorry? What was that about Maya?\nPhoenix:\nO-oh, nothing.\nTalk\nThe Steel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai's so cool. I think he's the, um, the \"bomb.\"\nCody:\nHah! What would a lamer like you know about the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\nH-hey, watch that attitude!\nMia:\nPhoenix, you really should't yell like that. He's only a kid.\nCody:\nYeah! Don't yell like that I'm only a kid!\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo, do you know anything about what happened here?

My UR!\nPhoenix:\n\"You are\"... huh?\nCody:\n\"U.R.\" You know, \"ultra rare\"! That card's really hard to get! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!\nPhoenix:\nI'll give you this... IF you help me.\nCody:\nBut that's my card! By offering me something I already own, you're in effect eschewing the very basis of our consumer society, namely the principle of fair trade! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!\nPhoenix:\n(W-what do they teach these kids in school these days!? Quantum physics!?)\nCody:\nWhatever, I don't need that card.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nCody:\nI got a double. Just keep it. It's yours.\nPhoenix:\n(What!? After I went through all that trouble...)\nCody:\nIf you want to trade, find me a REALLY rare card!\nPhoenix:\n\"Really rare\"!? You mean there's something rarer than \"Ultra Rare\"!?\nCody:\nUltra Rare Premium cards are way rarer than plain Ultra Rare cards! Come ON! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!\nPhoenix:\nPremium... rare... why do I feel like we're talking about steaks?\nAnything else\nCody:\nWhat's that? Bo-ring! Man, how can one person be so lame!?

Like, is she even the same person as before?\nPhoenix:\nUm, nope! She's the same as always.\nMia:\nSame as always.\nPenny:\nOkay... whatever you say...\nTalk\nThe fanboy\nPhoenix:\nHave you seen that boy since then?\nPenny:\nNope. You missed it, though. The security lady was chasing around after the boy so fast I thought she'd collapse. Of course, he got away in the end. Boy, was she mad!\nPhoenix:\nActually, we saw them. How's the old windbag doing?\nPenny:\nShe was squeezing donuts through her clenched fists back at the guard station.\nPhoenix:\n(Some people take their jobs a little too seriously.)\nMr. Hammer\nPhoenix:\nAre all the posters on the wall here of Hammer?\nPenny:\nYes. It's really a terrible loss for the studios.\nPhoenix:\nBut... his popularity had been waning recently, right?\nPenny:\nThat's true. Then again, after what happened...\nPhoenix:\nAfter WHAT happened?\nPenny:\nY-you mean, you don't know about Hammer...?\nPhoenix:\nNo, what?\nPenny:\nI-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.\nWhat happened (appears after \"Mr. Hammer\")\nPhoenix:\nWait, now you have to tell me. What happened with Hammer?\nPenny:\nI-I'm sorry. I'm probably not the one who should tell you.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh. Why do I get the feeling something's being covered up here?)\nPresent\nSteel Samurai Card\nLeads to:\n\"Do you know anything about this?\"\nAnything else\nPenny:\nUmm... Sorry. I'm really Not sure what that is.\nPhoenix:\nDo you know anything about this?\nPenny:\nHey, that's a Steel Samurai trading card. I collect those, actually. I'm one card away from a complete set!\nPhoenix:\nA complete set?\nPenny:\nYeah, a set of one of each card.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...\nPenny:\n... Wait...Waitwaitwaitwait!!! That's it!!! That's the card I need! You don't know how long I've been looking for it!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nPenny:\nI don't care what kind of girl you might think I am, I need that card! P-please! I beg you!

See, this card isn't really even mine.\nPenny:\n!!! I... I see. O-of course. Of course it wouldn't be yours. Of course you couldn't trade it with me. Of course I won't ever get that card, ever.

C'mon give it to me, please! You gotta give it to me!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, I've never seen him so... eager.) R-right! Okay! How about a trade?\nCody:\nYou're on! I'll give you a \"Samurai Spear\" and throw in an \"Evil Magistrate\" to boot!!\nPhoenix:\nNo no no no... not that kind of trade. I don't want cards. I want information.\nCody:\nHuh? You sure? Fine by me!\nURP Card given to Cody. (Changed from [Gave URP Card to Cody.] in the original release)\nMia:\nOkay, Phoenix. Let's hear what he has to say. If he knows something that could help us, we can have him take the stand tomorrow.\nTalk\nThe Steel Samurai\nPhoenix:\nSo... you like the Steel Samurai.\nCody:\nHe's so cool!\nPhoenix:\nI... I guess.\nCody:\nYou're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)\nCody:\nYou like him too, don'tcha?\nPhoenix:\nUh... Oh, me? Y-yeah! I, um, love the Steel Samurai.\nCody:\nSo, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\nHis kind nature\nPhoenix:\nR-right... (C'mon, think of something!) I really like his, um, his kind nature. What a guy!\nCody:\nTotally! He looks so tough, but inside, he's as gentle as a kitten!\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nCody:\nSo, what else do you like about him?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)\nLeads back to:\n\"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\"\nHis fighting skills\nLeads to:\n\"Got to think of something...\"\nWill Powers's acting\nPhoenix:\nW-well... (I've never even seen a full episode of that dumb show.) A-actually, I'm kind of a fan of Will Powers...\nCody:\nWhoa! That's totally hard-core!\nPhoenix:\n(You're calling ME hard-core?)\nCody:\nSo, what else do you like about him?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)\nLeads back to:\n\"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\"\nPhoenix:\n(Got to think of something...) I like it when he, uh, he vanquishes his foes!\nCody:\nYeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album!\nPhoenix:\nWhat the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai.\nCody:\nI go to every live performance!\nPhoenix:\n(Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?)\nCody:\nI always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera!\nMia:\nWow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it?\nCody:\nYou bet, lady! I just got it for my birthday. My album has a name, wanna hear it? \"The Steel Samurai: Path To Glory.\" The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Hey, if you want this, you can have it, lady.\nMia:\nReally? Are you sure?\nCody:\nYeah, I took these with a digital camera. I got all the data at home so I can always make another one.\nMia:\nWell, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you.\n\"Path to Glory\" received.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with people always giving stuff to Mia? What a life!)\nMia:\n?\nThe Steel Samurai (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo... you like the Steel Samurai.\nCody:\nWell, yeah! Duh! He's so strong!\nPhoenix:\nI... I guess.\nCody:\nYou're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nYou were here on the day of the... incident, right?\nCody:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\nDid you see anything unusual?\nCody:\n...\nMia:\nCody.\nCody:\n!\nMia:\nCody, he needs to know because he's fighting for justice. Isn't that the Steel Samurai's motto? \"For great justice\"? You have to help us fight for great justice, too.\nCody:\nI... I saw... I saw everything!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, well... We might get some useful information out of him yet.)\nWhat you saw (appears after \"The Steel Samurai\" and \"What happened\")\nLeads to:\n\"Cody... I need to ask you something very important.\"\nPresent\n\"Path to Glory\"\nPhoenix:\nThanks for this.\nCody:\nHey, I gave that to the nice lady, not you, loser! No looking at that, okay!\nPhoenix:\n(Believe me, I wasn't going to...)\nPhoenix:\nCody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?\nCody:\n... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that...\nMia:\nWhat is it, Cody?\nCody:\nTh-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see. It must have been hard for you.\nCody:\nMan, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... right.) Mia?\nMia:\nYes?\nPhoenix:\nI think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.\nMia:\nTrue enough.\nPhoenix:\nAnd the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.\nMia:\nIndeed.\nPhoenix:\nSo... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!\nMia:\n... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be \"guilty\" for sure.\nPhoenix:\nLet's not call him then...\nMia:\nI think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.\n???:\nNot so fast, pal!\nGumshoe:\nI heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct!\nCody:\nNo! I ain't going! Waah!\nMia:\n... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court.\nPhoenix:\nW-what're we going to do, Mia!\nMia:\nWell, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there!\nMia:\nPhoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent?\nI believe\nPhoenix:\nOf course he is!\nMia:\n... That's all I wanted to hear. Excellent. I'll see you in court, then.\nLeads to:\n\"Great! Thanks, Mia!\"\nI don't know\nPhoenix:\n(I never expected things to go this badly for Powers's case... I'm not sure we can win this one.)\nMia:\nPhoenix? If you don't believe him, who will!?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh, she's mad.)\nMia:\nOh well... I'll see you in court tomorrow then.\nLeads to:\n\"Great! Thanks, Mia!\"\nPhoenix:\nGreat!

The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nSomething wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia:\nPhoenix, this is critical!

Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose you might say that...\nPhoenix:\n(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)\nEdgeworth:\nTsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nWhat's your point, Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nYou've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThe Court Record...?\nEdgeworth:\nSurely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa! You're right!\nEdgeworth:\nTrue, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!\nPhoenix:\n... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)\nJudge:\nNo counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.\nLeads to:\n\"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"No, it's impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.\nEdgeworth:\nHa hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!\nPhoenix:\n... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)\nLeads to:\n\"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"Edgeworth:\nI believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix:\n(Wh-what? It's over?)Judge:\nVery well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge:\nWho is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nMy witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge:\nOrder! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness.

I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix:\nM-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia:\n... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will:\nUmm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia:\nDon't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong.

Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!Mia:\nPhoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder...

Ah!Phoenix:\nCorrect! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera!

Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!Phoenix:\nRight! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?Cody:\n... ... ... Yeah.Mia:\nWell, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!Phoenix:\nR-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.Judge:\nV-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?Cody:\nUmm...Phoenix:\n(Welcome to the real world, kid!)Witness Testimony-- No Photo? --Cody:\nYeah, you're right, pops.\nThe Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.\nSo I held up my camera to take a picture!\nBut the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.\nTh-that's all that happened.

  "previousContext": "Episode 3 The Kidnapped Turnabout\nEdgeworth: (...It's time.)\nGumshoe: Don't worry, Mr. Edgeworth! I'll be following your every movement with my binoculars!\nEdgeworth: Good to hear. Now make sure you don't lose sight of me. I'm counting on you for backup.\nGumshoe: You can count on me, sir!\nEdgeworth: I have to go. The kidnapper is supposed to contact me soon. (Who would've thought that upon my return, I'd be thrust into a kidnapping case. And that I would be the one who would have to make the ransom drop-off...)\nEdgeworth: (Let's see... I checked that the money is all there, safe inside this suitcase... Now all I have to do is await further instructions from the kidnapper... ...which I'm expecting to be transferred to my cell phone. I wonder who else is around? This is the meeting place, after all...)\n???: Welcome to Gatewater Land!\nEdgeworth: Hm? Oh, thank you.\n???: And a big hello to you! I'm the Proto Badger! Nice to meet you! ............\nEdgeworth: ............\nProto B.: Excuse me, but were you perhaps thinking of taking a picture of me?\nEdgeworth: A picture...? Of you...? Sorry, but I'm not interested.\nProto B.: Aww, that's too bad. Well, have a good day!\nEdgeworth: ...Hello?\n???: ...Who aRE yOu? YoU'Re nOt ERNesT AmaNo!\nEdgeworth: (It sounds like the kidnapper is using some sort of voice alteration device...) I'm his representative, Miles Edgeworth.\n???: ...ARE YoU a cOP?\nEdgeworth: No, I'm......... a prosecutor.\n???: ............\nEdgeworth: ............ I know what you're wondering, and yes, I have brought the ransom money with me.\n???: I SeE... In THAt caSe, bRIng thE mOnEy wiTh You to tHe StaDIum.\nEdgeworth: (So this person intends to see if I'm being followed, huh. Please, Detective Gumshoe... I really need you to come through for me this one time.)\nEdgeworth: ...Edgeworth speaking.\n???: NeXT, ComE to THe HaUNteD HOUsE.\nEdgeworth: And just how long do you intend to have me wander around for?\n???: ThAt'S fOr mE To dECIdE. YoU dON't hAVE MucH of A cHOIce hERe, mY fRIeNd.\nEdgeworth: I suppose not.\nEdgeworth: ...I've arrived.\n???: ...Go iNsIDe.\nEdgeworth: (Hmph. What a dismal place...)\n???: ThaT'S IT. GO thROuGh tHOsE DooRs...\nEdgeworth: (Am I being watched from somewhere?)\n???: LeAVe tHe MoNEy aND GO. NoW.\nEdgeworth: Nnngh............ .................. (I was hoping for an exchange, but maybe I should do as they say for now and not push it.)\nEdgeworth: (I couldn't catch even a glimpse of the kidnapper. Perhaps I should keep an eye on this haunted house until police backup arrives.)\nEdgeworth: (Agh! It was a trap!)\n???: That guy... betrayed...\n???: No... can't be... Then the deal...\nEdgeworth: (Who is that...? And what are they talking about...?)\n???: ...split... police...\n???: ...Alright...\n???: ...in front of... meet up...\nEdgeworth: (...I can't move my body... ...I-I fear I may faint again...)\nEdgeworth: Where am I...? (How long was I out...? It wasn't raining like it is now when I made the drop-off... This was supposed to be a simple affair... ...so why have I been taken hostage as well!? I can only assume Detective Gumshoe lost sight of me at some point.)\nEdgeworth: The only reason I agreed to be the drop-off man was because of that phone call. It was from Mr. Ernest Amano, the director of the powerful zaibatsu, the Amano Group. But aside from that, I also owe him a great debt of gratitude. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped. I know that Lance is already in his twenties, but I guess some things you never grow out of.\nEdgeworth: .................. (I can't sit around waiting for someone to come help me! I must escape somehow...) ...Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!!\n???: Hahaha! Was that you making that funny sound!?\nEdgeworth: ............Who's there!? And how dare you laugh at a gentleman's plight!? ...Who are you? Are you one of the kidnappers?\n???: A kidnapper? Me? No way! I'm not into such petty crimes. Nope! I'm after something much, much bigger!\nEdgeworth: .................. (Argh! I must be worn out from today's ordeal. Focus, Miles!)\n???: Oh, I forgot to introduce myself! Sorry about that! Ahem! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu!\nEdgeworth: Great Thief? (And did she really just claim to be the Yatagarasu?)\nKay: Oh, but my real name is Kay Faraday. You can call me \"Kay\", 'kay!? Good! Glad that's settled!\nEdgeworth: .................. Not quite. I have a mountain of questions for you... ...but first, if you would be so kind as to remove these ropes.\nKay: Hmm... I wonder... Should I remove them? I was actually having a lot of fun watching you make those silly faces...\nEdgeworth: ..................\nKay: Hey! There's no need to get all mad and icy glare-y on me, you know! This rope goes through here, and... there you go!\nEdgeworth: What a relief. I owe you my thanks.\nKay: Ah, it's OK. You can pay me back in full later!\nEdgeworth: (Now then... What question should I start with? Unfortunately, I can already tell nothing is going to be easy with this cheeky girl...)\nAfter clearing \"Yatagarasu\" Talk option:\nKay: So, you never told me what your name is, Mr. Prosecutor.\nEdgeworth: Ah, I guess not. I'm Miles Edgeworth.\nKay: Aha! Now I remember!\nEdgeworth: (...How can you \"remember\" something I just told you...? But she sure is cheery.)\nKay: Alright, then Mr. Edgeworth, let's get outta here! ............Hm?\nEdgeworth: ...It would seem that we are locked in from the other side.\nKay: What!? No way! I don't hear you! La la la!\nEdgeworth: Kay, you do remember where you came in from, right...? It looks like that might be our only way out of this room...\nKay: Whoops, slight miscalculation. That's a good height to make an entrance from, but I can't jump that high to make an exit!\nEdgeworth: ...*sigh* I suppose we have no choice but to look around and see if we can't find another way out.\nEdgeworth: (Hm? Isn't this my phone? It looks like it made it through the ordeal intact.)\nKay: If only there was [sic] a way for us to contact someone on the outside...\nEdgeworth: Ah, but we do have a way... right here.\nKay: Ah! There was a cell phone here this whole time!?\nEdgeworth: If I'm right, Detective Gumshoe should have contacted the precinct for backup by now.\nGumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Are you OK!? I was so worried, sir!\nEdgeworth: I'm fine. I was knocked unconscious for a spell by the kidnapper, that's all.\nGumshoe: I'm sorry, sir! I'm such a failure! If only I hadn't lost sight of you...!\nEdgeworth: Detective, we don't have time for this. Have the police set up a perimeter right now!\nGumshoe: You don't have to worry about that, sir! I already got the boys working on that! But in doing that... I sorta... Aaaah...!\nEdgeworth: What's wrong, Detective?\n???: ...Sorry to butt in, but I'm afraid you're going to have to make do (changed from [make due] in the original release, correcting the typo) with me.\nEdgeworth: Who is this?\nLang: Shi-Long Lang of Interpol. A pleasure to speak with you, Mr. Edgeworth. I've heard a great deal about you.\nEdgeworth: So why exactly is an Interpol agent like yourself involved in a domestic kidnapping case?\nLang: Don't sweat the details. A crime's a crime whether it's on a local or a global scale. Besides... ...you're the one who's in a world of trouble.\nEdgeworth: A-And why would you say that!?\nLang: Lang Zi says: \"The pack that runs together, stays together.\" You catch my drift? You caused quite a ruckus by running blindly into a situation and then getting caught.\nEdgeworth: Tsk...!\nLang: You should've contacted the police from the very beginning.\nEdgeworth: I'm sorry that this happened because of a lapse in judgement. However, I humbly request that you please help me out of here posthaste.\nLang: ......Sorry, no can do.\nEdgeworth: What!?\nLang: We're hunting the kidnapper now, and I haven't got any hands to spare. As I said, my pack moves as one. You're the one who wanted to go it alone, so good luck to you... Mr. Prosecutor. Oh, and once we do catch the kidnapper, rest assured we'll come find you... eventually.\nEdgeworth: ...You... You...\nKay: What's wrong? Did you get cut off!?\nEdgeworth: No... My phone ran out of power.\nKay: No way!\nEdgeworth: It doesn't matter anyway. We should try to get out of here through our own means.\nKay: Yeah! I have a name to live up to, after all! If we put our heads together, we're sure to find a way out!\nEdgeworth: This hook on this beam...\nKay: You know I already tried, and there's no way I can jump from this hook to the window! Come on, even you have to admit when something's just not possible.\nEdgeworth: Hah, I wasn't about to suggest that again. Rather, that it's here for a different purpose.\nKay: Really!? Like what!?\nEdgeworth: As you saw in the adjacent room, it's clearly for keeping a floor panel propped up. Which means that there should be a panel in this room that we can open as well.\nKay: Oh! I get it!\nEdgeworth: We didn't notice its existence all this time because it was being hidden by this tarp.\nKay: Alright then! Let's fold this thing up and see what's underneath!\nKay: Now THIS is what I call a treasure!\nEdgeworth: I believe you're up, Kay.\nKay: Huh? Why me?\nEdgeworth: Because we need to use the tiny key that you've taken quite a liking to.\nKay: Oh, gotcha! Just leave it to me! I love the tense feeling of these moments when you're about to uncover something big!\nEdgeworth: I believe the feeling of freedom would be much more satisfying right about now.\nKay: Alright! I got the secret door open! And now...!\nEdgeworth: Ack! Wait!\nKay: Wha--!? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nEdgeworth: Are you alright!? Kay!?\nKay: I'm fine. The ladder just slipped is all!\nEdgeworth: (Thank goodness she's alright. I about had a coronary...)\nKay: There's a lot of really large machinery down here.\nEdgeworth: What about an exit?\nKay: Umm... It's really dark and cramped down there, so I really doubt there's an exit. Argh, I can't believe that happened!\nEdgeworth: You have only yourself to blame for leaping before you looked, you know.\nKay: No way! I mean, how was I supposed to know that the ladder is removable (Underground ladder - It looks as though it can be easily removed, but is it really safe to use...?)!?\nEdgeworth: I've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay.\nKay: Oh? So, how are we going to bust out?\nEdgeworth: It seems that your reckless actions were of use after all.\nKay: ...Are you actually praising me?\nEdgeworth: More of a \"thank you\" for giving me an idea regarding this ladder.\nKay: The underground ladder? What about it?\nEdgeworth: This ladder isn't just for those who wish to go down...\nKay: Oh! I see! If we use this...!\nEdgeworth: Yes, I believe it's long enough to reach the top of those lockers.\nKay: Well, then what are we waiting for!?\nKay: Alright! Now we can get out of here!\nEdgeworth: Yes... We spent entirely too much time in here. (Kidnappers who held me hostage, and a mysterious Interpol agent... This case is only getting started, and I'll be the one to bring it to a resounding end!)\nEdgeworth: It looks like it's stopped raining for now.\nKay: Yeah, and thank goodness! You have no idea how hard it was raining earlier!\n???: Mr. Edgeworth! I'm so glad to see you managed to escape, sir! I was so stressed that I thought my heart was gonna give out!\nEdgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, may I ask what in the world that is?\nGumshoe: Well, that's... um...\nMIB: Count off!\n1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8!\n98! 99!\nMIB: Shifu! All 99 members are here and accounted for, sir!\n???: Heh... What the heck do you think you're doing counting my cubs off like that!? Every person is a valuable human being, you get me? And everyone has a name that their parents gave to them. No one is a 2 or a 3... Everyone, regardless of age or rank, is number 1! Got it!?\nShifu! Shifu!\nEdgeworth: ...You are Agent Lang, I take it?\nMIB: You infidel! How dare you address our Shifu so rudely!?\nLang: Grr! Lang Zi says: \"A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder.\" So don't you ever forget to show the proper respect towards another person! Shih-na. This isn't much, but please accept my card.\nEdgeworth: Oh, thank you. ...Please, accept mine in return.\nLang: You all see that just now!? That is the proper way for two people to show their respect! Keep that in mind and you'll get far in life, got it!?\nEdgeworth: (Ah, that's right... Franziska did warn me... Something about an elite Interpol Agent from the Republic of Zheng Fa. Apparently, this man has the highest successful arrest rate in the organization.) Agent Lang, why exactly is an Interpol agent involved with this clearly domestic case?\nLang: That's none of your business, Mr. Prosecutor.\nEdgeworth: How is it not!?\nLang: I've heard a rumor or two about you. You solved a murder that occurred during your flight home recently, right? Hah! But you sure took a while just to arrest one little flight attendant. How pathetic.\nGumshoe: H-How dare you say that about Mr. Edgeworth!? Are you saying you could've solved it faster, pal!?\nLang: The comedic relief jumps to the aid (changed from [aide] in the original release) of his master... How cliché. Look, what I'm getting at is that if I had been there, no one would've died.\nEdgeworth: !\nLang: I would've solved the entire case and Agent Hicks would still be with us here today.\nEdgeworth: (Agent Lang knew yesterday's victim, Agent Akbey Hicks...?)\nLang: Hicks was like a brother to me, so now, I'm out to take my revenge!\nEdgeworth: (Agent Hicks was investigating a smuggling ring with Franziska and a third person... This must be the man she was talking about.) In that case, you should understand how I feel, as the kidnapped is someone I know. So I ask that you please allow me to participate in the investigation...\nLang:\nLang: This isn't your neatly trimmed Courtroom of Eden, you know. You're out in the wilderness now, Mr. Prosecutor, and way out of your league. No hard feelings, but why don't you go on back to your courtroom now, pretty boy?\nEdgeworth: You...! You dare to mock the court!?\nLang: I do... And I don't need the help of a filthy \"prosecutor\". Sorry, but the truth doesn't need the likes of you to distort it today!\nEdgeworth: (Who uses the adjective \"filthy\" to describe a prosecutor...!? And why...? Why do I feel such intense loathing emanating from him!?)\nLang: Alright, men! Good job on the perimeter around Gatewater Land. Now just find me the kidnapper, and bring the punk to me! Dismissed!\nSir!\nLang: Now then, Mr. Prosecutor, you just sit tight here and don't cause any trouble, understand?\nEdgeworth: W-Wait!\nGumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth: It's been a while since I last met someone so disagreeable. (Why of all places did he show up here? And completely out of the blue at that! I suppose I'll have to ask Detective Gumshoe to fill me in on that.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options with Dick Gumshoe and Kay Faraday:\n???: Laaaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, son!?\nEdgeworth: Mr. Amano?\nErnest: Oh! Miles, my boy! I'm sorry to involve you in such an affair just after you've returned.\nEdgeworth: For you, Mr. Amano, I gladly offer my assistance. After all, I have you to thank for how well things turned out during my time abroad. If it wasn't [sic] for you, I might not have been introduced to that law office... ...and had the chance to study the inner workings of another country's judicial system.\nErnest: No, no, no. Think nothing of it. As you know, Manfred and I go way back. I consider a beloved disciple of his to be like one of my own blood.\nEdgeworth: ............\nErnest: If you ever want to go overseas again, you need only to ask. I can use my company's vast network to send you anywhere at any time.\nKay: So who's the old man?\nEdgeworth: He is the father of the currently kidnapped Lance Amano, Ernest Amano.\nErnest: Now then, have you found Lance yet, Miles? Please... I miss my poor boy dearly!\nEdgeworth: I'm terribly sorry, but your son's whereabouts remain unknown, Mr. Amano.\nErnest: Wh-- Hold on there! Then, what happened to all that money!?\nEdgeworth: .........I believe the $1 million has been stolen, and that the culprits are now on the run.\nErnest: Whaaaaat!?\nKay: Poor old man... Don't you have anything you could give him to cheer him up, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth: (Forgive me, Mr. Amano...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options with Ernest Amano:\nEdgeworth: .................. Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe: Yes, sir!\nEdgeworth: Let's begin our investigation. Even if that Interpol agent holds the authority to head this investigation... ...we can't allow ourselves to stand idly by, twiddling our thumbs.\nGumshoe: I'm with you 100%, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! I, Dick Gumshoe, pledge to stick by your side through thick and thin!\nEdgeworth: Mr. Amano, it was my fault that the culprits escaped. Which is why, with your blessing, I vow to return Lance to you myself.\nErnest: Oh! I've never seen you so passionate before, Miles. Good luck to you, my boy.\nKay: Alright! Well, what are you waiting for!? Let's do some investigating!\nGumshoe: If you think I'm losing to you, pal, forget it!\nGumshoe: So what should we examine first!?\nEdgeworth: Hmm... Thanks to Agent Lang, we can't leave this area. But the culprits were here until only very recently. Which means we may be able to find some clues that will tell us how they escaped.\nGumshoe: OK! Let's get looking!\nDetective: Hey! You there!\nGumshoe: Who, me!?\nDetective: What are you doing goofing off in a place like this!?\nGumshoe: I wasn't goofing off! I was about to help Mr. Edgeworth kick off his investigation.\nDetective: You imbecile! All precinct detectives are now under Agent Lang's direct command!\nGumshoe: N-No way! I am NOT working for Wolf-boy! Mr. Edgeworth! Can't you do something...!?\nEdgeworth: .................. I'm not exactly in a position to argue, seeing as how you ARE a member of the police.\nDetective: Good, now let's go!\nGumshoe: Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!\nDetective: Boy, have I got just the job for someone of your talents!\nKay: Well, that was exciting.\nEdgeworth: ............ Kay.\nKay: What? Can't you tell I'm all ready to get down to some detective work!?\nEdgeworth: You should go home. Your parents must be worried about you.\nKay: Oh, come on! I finally get to be your assistant and you try to ditch me!?\nEdgeworth: ...I don't recall offering you the position.\nKay: Hmmmph. Why do you have to be so difficult? Besides, it's already too late, you know! Like I said, I've already stolen the position of \"assistant\" a while back!\nEdgeworth: Hah. You're the only one asserting that.\nKay: Well! By the time anyone notices, it's already gone! That's the Yatagarasu way!\nEdgeworth: You shouldn't speak so lightly of things you know nothing about!\nKay: Fine, whatever, you win. Go ahead and do your little investigation. But the talented assistant Kay, is going to tag along no matter what you say!\nEdgeworth: (Even if she turns out to be useless, she's not going to listen to me. I might as well surrender and let her come along for the ride...)\nEdgeworth: Now that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes... ...those footprints from earlier take on a new, and very significant meaning.\nKay: Oh, you mean now we know which tracks belong to the kidnappers, right!?\nEdgeworth: Yes. More than shoe prints, we need to follow the paw prints of Badgers.\nKay: OK, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to use those footprints and go Badger hunting!\nKay: Hmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume... Hey! I think I found them! There are two sets here!\nEdgeworth: They both do look like possible candidates.\nKay: This set is walking off to the west... Argh! It just stops! I can't make heads or tails of where it's headed from here!\nEdgeworth: I think we can assume it's headed towards the stadium...\nKay: Hmm... I wonder where the other set leads? This one seems to be headed east... Huh? Quick, Mr. Edgeworth! I've got him! I got one of the culprits!\nMeekins: Aaaah! Nooooo! I'm not a kidnapper, sir!!!\nEdgeworth: Down, Kay. Clearly, those footprints belong to Officer Meekins. But our criminals were each wearing a costume.\nKay: Aha! Maybe they came over to this garage for something?\nEdgeworth: That's what I would suppose. Officer Meekins, if you could step aside for a moment. We need to examine the garage.\nMeekins: SIR! Roger Wilco, sir!\nEdgeworth: Let's open this shutter and see what we find.\nKay: Maybe we'll find the kidnappers hiding inside!\nKay: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!\nEdgeworth: Wh-What in the--!? (We seem to have stumbled across a dead body...)\nKay: ............\nEdgeworth: (She must be in severe shock to have been the first to find it... Now then, who is this man?)\nErnest: I-It's Oliver!\nEdgeworth: ! Mr. Amano, are you saying that this man is...\nErnest: Yes... He's my butler... How could something like this have happened!?\nEdgeworth: (Indeed. And why was Mr. Deacon here to begin with? I'd better investigate this crime scene quickly, before Agent Lang or his men return. The kidnapper's footprints lead right to this garage... ...and right to a dead body. Is it possible one of the kidnappers is now a murder victim (Victim was kidnapper? - Following a kidnapper's prints led us to a body. Was the victim in a costume?)...?) From my cursory examination, I believe this man died of a fatal bullet wound.\nPreliminary Findings data jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay: You sure are calm for someone who just found a body.\nEdgeworth: (It's surprising what one can become accustomed to in the span of two days...)\nLeads to examination of body\nAfter examining wounds and correctly deducing pendant:\n???: Laaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, sweetie!?\nEdgeworth: Excuse me, but you are...?\n???: *ba-dump*\nEdgeworth: ?\n???: Oh, this is bad... He's really good looking! Ack! Stop it, Lauren! You can't let yourself fall for a playboy like him! You're in love with...\nKay: Sounds like someone doesn't know the meaning of the phrase \"inner monologue\", huh?\nEdgeworth: Sorry to interrupt your... conversation, but might you be a friend of Lance?\n???: Yes, I'm Lance's girlfriend... My name is Lauren Paups.\nEdgeworth: His girlfriend...?\nPaups: Oh, it's not like that! We're more like friends... and, um... We're not lovers or anything! We! Well, we haven't gotten that far yet! But... I guess that's how people are going to see it, so I should just accept it... I even got this ring as a present from Lance... *swoon*\nKay: Ha ha, you know what she reminds of? A cartoon character!\nEdgeworth: N...Nnnnrrrghn... May I inquire as to why you are here?\nPaups: I haven't been able to get in contact with Lance lately... ...and I began to get really worried. *sob* I looked everywhere for him, and then I heard about the kidnapping, so I came here.\nKay: Wow, you're really strong for having made it through all this by yourself!\nPaups: Um! Is it true!? Has Lance really been kidnapped!?\nEdgeworth: ...No one is supposed to know, but yes, it's true.\nPaups: Oh, Lance...! I can't believe you've been spirited away... I wonder how you're doing right now...\nKay: Looks like she's gone back to the \"fair maiden in love\" routine... So, Mr. Edgeworth, where do we go from here?\nEdgeworth: Well, we found a body, so we should look into the murder...\n???:\nLang: My men brought me up to speed over the radio. And I have to say, you really should've called. I heard you found something very intriguing.\nEdgeworth: I have nothing to hide, Agent Lang. It's exactly what you see before you.\nLang: I'll take it from here. Yeah, that guy's really dead. Hey! You waiting for an invitation? Hurry up and detain the suspect, now.\nEdgeworth: (Suspect? Who...?)\nLang: Officer Meekins, is it? You're coming with us.\nMeekins: What!? SIR! I had nothing to do with it, sir!\nEdgeworth: Agent Lang! Don't you think you're being a bit rash!? Do you even have a good reason to suspect Officer Meekins!?\nLang: Hah, I leave that kind of stuff to you prosecutors. It's your job, after all. Like I said earlier, the crime scene isn't as forgiving as your precious courtroom.\nEdgeworth: That's your answer!?\nLang: I know you like your logic and reasoning... ...but that sort of impractical fluff is not needed out here in the field.\nEdgeworth: !\nLang: All you have to do is arrest suspicious person after suspicious person. That's how you eliminate crime from the streets!\nEdgeworth: But that's also precisely how you unnecessarily arrest innocent people by mistake!\nLang: \"Innocent people\"? Nonsense! There's no such thing as an innocent person. We've all got a blemish or two in our hearts.\nEdgeworth: That's tyranny! I won't allow such a thing to go on unchecked before my eyes!\nLang: Heh! Too bad you don't call the shots around here!\nEdgeworth: As I have sworn to uphold the laws of this land, I cannot allow you to take this man in. That you would arrest a man on false charges without even conducting an investigation... ...have you no honor as a member of law enforcement!?\nMIB: You! How dare you speak so disrespectfully to our Shifu!?\nLang: Hold it! .................. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You amuse me, Mr. Prosecutor. Lang Zi says: \"Every pack has its own rules.\" If you can play by their rules and come out on top, that is a true victory. Alright, I'll give your beloved laws a fair shake. I'll show you just how much investigating I've done... ...through my line of logic!\nLang: I've seen a lot of bodies like the one being carted off in my time. I can say he was shot in a single glance, but even you figured that much out, right? With your current gun laws, it's not exactly easy to get your hands on a gun. Not unless you're a member of law enforcement like Officer Meekins, isn't that right?\nEdgeworth: That is your reasoning...?\nLang: Solid as a rock! It's based on the philosophy of detainment!\nKay: Um... What's this \"philosophy of detainment\"?\nLang: Hah! You don't know!? In that case, pay attention, girlie. In my country, the criminals have a saying: \"Beware of the wolf.\"\nEdgeworth: Why the wolf...?\nLang: Because in my language, \"lang\" means \"wolf\", and you don't mess with me or my pack. And as for the detainment philosophy, its father is my honorable ancestor, Lang Zi.\nEdgeworth: (Hmm... You'd think I'd have heard of him and his teachings if he is [sic] that famous...)\nLang: Lang Zi developed it as he worked to lock criminals away thousands of years ago. To this day, the Zheng Fa police still trains its recruits using his philosophies.\nKay: But \"thousands of years ago\"? That makes your story about as believable as a fairy tale!\nEdgeworth: Hmph. Anything wears down and breaks over time. Do you really believe something as ancient as that can be applied to today's world?\nLang: ......You want to put it to a test?\nLang: I've seen a lot of bodies like the one being carted off in my time.\nLang: I can say he was shot in a single glance, but even you figured that much out, right?\nLang: With your current gun laws, it's not exactly easy to get your hands on a gun.\nLang: Not unless you're a member of law enforcement like Officer Meekins, isn't that right?\nLang: Officer Meekins ambushed the victim in this garage and killed him here with his gun!\nEdgeworth: (So this is the kind of conclusion the philosophy of detainment can lead you to...)\nKay: I don't get it, Mr. Edgeworth. Why are you putting yourself on the line for Mr. Meekins?\nEdgeworth: It's not that I particularly care about what happens to Officer Meekins.\nKay: Whaaaaat!?\nEdgeworth: However, I can't simply stand by while Agent Lang ignores our country's laws. (Shi-Long Lang... Just what sort of investigator are you?)\nEdgeworth: Unfortunately for you, Agent Lang, that is simply not possible.\nLang: What do you mean?\nEdgeworth: You've seen the crime scene for yourself. And while you were looking, did you not think to yourself that it was a little too clean?\nLang: Aiya!\nEdgeworth: So you did notice that there was too little blood. Do you still wish to claim that Officer Meekins committed the murder here? Because this isn't the crime scene. And if it was your men who led you to think it was... ...then I suggest you leave this case to the local police to set the record straight!\nLang: Grr! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Not bad. I see your logic can be just as sound as mine. In that case, let me ask you this: Don't you think it's weird that officer was hanging out around here in the first place?\nEdgeworth: Weird? How so?\nLang: Hey, you! Your squad's not even supposed to be in this area, right? What were you doing neglecting your duties and loafing around here?\nMeekins: I-I...!\nLang: Don't you dare give me some lame excuse like, \"I found myself taking a walk.\"\nMeekins: But sir... I really did take a walk, sir!\nLang: You're a disgrace. How dare you take your pack obligations so lightly?\nEdgeworth: (Officer Meekins is looking extra meek. Is he hiding something...?)\nMeekins: Mr. Edgeworth! Please! Sir! Save me the way you did earlier, please, sir!\nEdgeworth: ...Officer Meekins. Please give is a detailed account of what happened.\nMeekins: SIR! Not you, too!\nMeekins: It's true, sir! I wasn't assigned to this area, sir! I was told to check every square inch of the main gate area, sir! I also went looking for the kidnappers while selling dreams in the Blue Badgermobile, sir! But! I got completely caught up in my role, selling dreams to the children! SIR! Before I knew it, I found myself here in this area, sir!\nEdgeworth: What is this \"Blue Badgermobile\"?\nMeekins: It's a moving store on wheels that sells sweet dreams and merchandise, sir!\nKay: So the Blue Badgermobile is just a roaming souvenir shop?\nBlue Badgermobile data jotted down in my Organizer.\nMeekins: SIR! I swear I was chasing the kidnappers down while I was being a good dream merchant!\nEdgeworth: (He seems rather worked up... Even more than his usual hyperactive self.)\nKay: He sure seems sure of what he's saying.\nEdgeworth: Can you try to calm down and lower your voice to a more reasonable level, Officer?\nMeekins: SIR! Roger, sir!\nMeekins: It's true, sir! I wasn't assigned to this area, sir!\nMeekins: I was told to check every square inch of the main gate area, sir!\nMeekins: I also went looking for the kidnappers while selling dreams in the Blue Badgermobile, sir!\nMeekins: But! I got completely caught up in my role, selling dreams to the children! SIR!\nMeekins: Before I knew it, I found myself here in this area, sir!\nEdgeworth: (It sounds like he simply forgot about his real job and became the Blue Badger... However, there is one flaw in Officer Meekins's story. But I have the feeling that he'll need some prodding before he'll spill the beans.)\nEdgeworth: Officer Meekins, I would appreciate it if you didn't tell such transparent lies.\nMeekins: SIR!? I'm lying, sir!?\nEdgeworth: Yes, you are. If you were really out there selling dreams with the Blue Badgermobile until recently... ...then what is it doing here inside the garage?\nMeekins: Aaaaaaah! A-Actually, I had just lost track, sir!\nEdgeworth: Lost track of what?\nMeekins: By the time I realized it, the Blue Badgermobile was nowhere to be found, sir!\nEdgeworth: (Which would mean it was perhaps... stolen?)\nMeekins: And that's when I came back to this area, thinking maybe it was in the garage, sir! But that's when you found me, Mr. Edgeworth! Sir!\nLang:\nLang: A likely story! Who do you think is going to buy such a convenient tale as that?\nEdgeworth: And what exactly is so convenient about his story?\nLang: The car getting stolen; it's completely unbelievable, even for a cover story! But I think we can assume the car was used alright. To move the dead body!\nMeekins: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nLang: You killed the victim at some distant location, Officer Meekins. And then you used the Blue Badgermobile to transport it all the way here. Now then, you're coming with me.\nMeekins: But it wasn't meeeee! SIR! THE KILLER, SIR! It wasn't meeeeee, sir!!!\nEdgeworth: Agent Lang! Wait!\nLang: Hm? What do you want now?\nEdgeworth: We still don't know where the real scene of the crime is. You can't say we know all the facts of this case, let alone the truth!\nLang: I told you! Truth, schmuth, I couldn't care less!\nEdgeworth: !\nLang: Our job is to catch the crook. You'll find out your precious truth after we arrest this guy and take him in. That's the job of you prosecutors in your fancy courts with your \"logic\". As for us, we don't have that kind of time to waste.\nEdgeworth: You boorish buffoon!\nLang: I think you need to leave.\nEdgeworth: What?\nLang: We need to get the body to autopsy, and you guys are getting in the way.\nEdgeworth: You...! You would interfere with another one of my investigations!?\nLang: Hey now, let's not forget who holds the actual authority to conduct investigations here.\nEdgeworth: Gnnngh!\nLang: I'm afraid the one doing the interrupting is you, my ignorant little pretty boy.\nEdgeworth: Nnn...Ngwooooooh!\nLang: Now be a good fancy boy and get out of my sight. If you don't... ...I'll arrest you for obstruction of justice.\nTo be continued\nEdgeworth: Nnngh... Chased out like a pair of peasants.\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth: ...Yes, Kay?\nKay: There's something even thieves should never steal. Do you know what that is?\nEdgeworth: You really shouldn't steal anything, however, I'll bite. What shouldn't a thief steal?\nKay: A life. It's too heavy of a burden on your soul to get away with, ever.\nEdgeworth: That's something we can agree on. Well said, Kay. No matter what we may try, murder is the one crime that can never truly be hidden. And I intend to prove that by my own hands... ...when I apprehend the murderer myself.\nKay: Alright! And I'm going to work extra hard to be a good assistant! Let's go!\nEdgeworth: (I still never said she could be my assistant... *sigh* I'm just going to drop the issue.) The first thing we should do is locate the real scene of the murder.\nGumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth: Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! The stadium! Hurry, sir! This is supposed to be hush-hush, but they found a witness at the stadium!\nEdgeworth: A witness!?\nDetective: You! What did we tell you about leaving your assigned post!?\nGumshoe: Aaah! The jig is up! Mr. Edgeworth! Remember that I'm always rooting for you, so go get 'em, sir!\nKay: Those detectives sure look like they're enjoying themselves!\nEdgeworth: It's not all fun and games, Kay. Now then, let's head to the stadium and meet this witness.\nEdgeworth: I thought there was a witness here...\nKay: Yeah, I don't see anyone...\n???: Mr. Edgeworth! Long time no see!\nEdgeworth: You are... Ms. Ema Skye, correct? (This girl is the younger sister of my former superior, Lana Skye. Two years ago, we stood in the same courtroom together as witness and prosecutor. But I thought she had gone to Europe to study forensics...)\nEma: I can't believe you remember me, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth: Of course I do. How have you been? You look to be in good spirits. Are you still studying abroad?\nEma: You bet! More than anything, I want to investigate crime scenes, scientifically! I've been studying non-stop every day to become a top-notch forensic scientist! But it's spring break now, so I thought I'd come back for a bit.\nEdgeworth: I see.\nAfter clearing all Talk options with Ema Skye and examining Pink Badgermobile:\nEdgeworth: (Hm? What's that off in the distance...?)\nKay: Oh, hey! It's the Pink Badger! Badger GET!\nEdgeworth: (Badger, badger, badger, badger... Just what does she see in these silly things?) ..................\nKay: I think this Badger has something to say to you, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth: Are you, by chance, the witness I've been searching for? (Sorry, but I don't speak Badger Dance.)\nPink Badger: ..................\n???: Aaaargh! I can't take bring inside that stuffy head anymore!\nEdgeworth: Y-You're--!!! (Nooooo! Why HER!? Why HERE!? Why NOW!? I first met this woman three years ago. She was a witness in one of my cases. She has since gone out of her way to pop up unexpectedly, and cause me great grief--)\n???: Edgey-pooooooooooo! Why couldn't you understand what I was trying to tell you!? I mean, really! I was trying so hard to keep the kids' dreams alive by staying in character! But you couldn't pick up on what I was trying to convey to you! I'm sick and tired of that roundabout way of talking, so I'm going to just be direct!\nEdgeworth: (I had a bad feeling before, but this just made it official. Today has gone beyond the typical \"not my day\" into the realm of \"waking nightmare\"!)\nKay: So you're a friend of Mr. Edgeworth, too, Ms. Pink Badger?\n???: You could say that. But right now, I'm just the Pink Badger, dearie.\nEdgeworth: (She may look the part, but I know better than to trust my eyes around this woman...)\nOldbag: My name is Wendy Oldbag. But you can call me \"Wendy\", or \"Granny\", or whatever suits your fancy.\nKay: Nice to meet you, Ms. Oldbag! I'm Kay Faraday.\nOldbag: Hmph! What do I care about young whippersnapper like you!?\nKay: Yeesh, I was just trying to be polite...\nKay: Aren't you forgetting about something, Mr. Edgeworth? This person could be the witness!\nEdgeworth: (Honestly, I hope she isn't, but I don't think fate is going to be so kind today...)\nOldbag: I saw what happened! I even saw the exact moment it happened! How's that!?\nKay: So it's true! She is the witness!\nEdgeworth: (*sigh* I don't suppose I can afford to ignore the old bag...)\nOldbag: Yes, it was just a little while ago! I saw it happen right in front of me! The moment of the murder!\nEdgeworth: You mean to say that you witnessed someone being killed right before your eyes?\nKay: Sounds like a pretty important piece of testimony to me!\nOldbag: I came to this stadium to take a short break. As I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area. Suddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground. It was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you!\nKay: Looks like we hit the jackpot, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth: Yes, I can't afford to ignore what she has to say. ...Unfortunately.\nOldbag: What's that \"unfortunately\" you tacked on at the end supposed to mean, Edgey-poo!?\nKay: Well, anyway! Let's see what we can find out from this little ol' lady!\nOldbag: I came to this stadium to take a short break.\nOldbag: As I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area.\nOldbag: Suddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground.\nOldbag: It was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you!\nEdgeworth: (I can tell this is an important piece of testimony, but she's rather vague in a few spots. *sigh* I suppose this means I'm going to have to talk with her some more...)\nAfter pressing second and third statements:\nEdgeworth: (Two men, one bullet... It's all consistent with what we found out from the body.) Sadly, there wasn't exactly a lot of new information to go on in your testimony...\nOldbag: Well, if I saw the guy again, I'm sure I could identify him for you! I mean, how do you expect me to remember anything without something to jog my memory!?\nKay: Self-centered, aren't we?\nEdgeworth: While it was somewhat useful, her testimony also presents us with a new problem...\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth: Yes?\nKay: So, about this new problem...\nEdgeworth: What is that giant grin on your face for?\nKay: Do you want me to show you something really nice?\nEdgeworth: ...No, thank you.\nKay: Don't be so mean! I swear it's something you're going to like!\nEdgeworth: What is that gadget you're holding?\nKay: What you see before you is the secret weapon of a Great Thief!\nEdgeworth: ...Ahh, I should have known it would be worthless.\nKay: Aww, don't be like that! Tee hee. *ahem!* What do you think now!?\nEdgeworth: What is it doing...? It's projecting something into the air...\nKay: I'm going to input the necessary information to run the simulation now. Once I'm done, I'll increase the size of the projection to its maximum size... Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood!\nEdgeworth: Wh-What is this!?\nKay: This is a re-creation of the murder based on the info I inputted into Little Thief!\nEdgeworth: L-Little Thief? I dare say I think you're taking the Robin Hood thing a bit too far...\nKay: Little Thief is actually meant to be a simulator for me to plan my thefts. But I suppose if I used it like this... Let's see... Ms. Oldbag said that the two men were facing each other. And then, a gunshot rang out, and the victim fell to the ground...\nEdgeworth: Ah... So with this, we can inspect the crime scene as it was in the past.\nKay: See! So, what do you think?\nEdgeworth: I have to say, I'm impressed by the technology thieves have access to these days.\nKay: Well, it IS the super-secret weapon of the mighty Yatagarasu!\nEdgeworth: Indeed.\nKay: Oh, but if there isn't enough information, or if something is out of place... ...the re-creation could come out a little strange.\nEdgeworth: In other words, I can use this to authenticate the validity of a witness's testimony?\nKay: You got it! You really catch on quick, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth: (Right now, this simulation is a re-creation of that witness's testimony... So for now, I should re-examine everything... ...and if I find anything illogical or strange, I can then ask for clarification.)\nKay: Feel free to examine anything in this simulation in the way you always do! You can even present evidence when you find a contradiction! And if you find something, I've got Little Thief with me, so you just let me know, OK?\nEdgeworth: According to the testimony, the victim fell to the ground here...\nKay: That's right. But...?\nEdgeworth: But, if that's the case, then we've already found our first contradiction.\nKay: Huh? What? Where!?\nEdgeworth: If this is the real scene of the crime, there's something missing that should be here. Which piece of evidence shows the missing item?\nEdgeworth: This is the contradiction!\nKay: Eh? Is something wrong with my re-creation?\nEdgeworth: If this is the real scene of the crime, something specific should be here. If you think back, how did we deduce that the other crime scene was not the real one?\nKay: Oh! I get what's missing now! There's no blood on the ground here either, right?\nEdgeworth: Right. The fact that there is no blood here casts doubt on the witness's testimony.\nOldbag: Edgey-poooooooo! How can you doubt me like that!? Are you calling me a liar!? I know what I saw! And I saw the victim get shot down!\nKay: You know, I don't think she's lying, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth: (To be honest, I can't think of a reason why she would lie to me. In that case, maybe there is another explanation for the distinct lack of blood (Why is there no blood? - Why is there no blood around the victim's prone body?).)\nEdgeworth: Is it not possible that the victim was wearing a costume?\nKay: So you really think that Mr. Deacon was one of the kidnappers?\nEdgeworth: I think we can reasonably assume there is a very good chance that he was. And that if he was [sic] shot while he was inside one of those stolen costumes...\nKay: ...Then Mr. Deacon's blood would be inside the costume instead of on the ground!\nEdgeworth: Precisely. Now, if only we could prove that the victim was wearing a costume...\nKay: You'd think it'd be pretty easy if we could find some footprints... ...but the problem is FINDING them, since there doesn't seem to be any around.\nEdgeworth: (Footprints, huh...? I wonder how we can go about finding some of those...?)\nEdgeworth: Ema, about that method you were talking about for finding footprints...\nEma: Ah, finally my expert knowledge in forensics is needed!\nEdgeworth: Yes, well... Can you detect and trace even partial footprints?\nEma: Leave it to me! My cutting-edge detection kit can find anything!\nEdgeworth: Very well. If you could please analyze the footprints in this area...\nEma: OK! Stand back now, and witness the power of science at work!\nEma: Hey! I found something! Look, right here!\nEdgeworth: ? I don't see anything...\nEma: Oh, that's right! Here, put these special glasses on, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth: ! These footprints here were definitely left by a Badger costume!\nEma: Judging by the way the prints are layered, those seem to be the newest.\nEdgeworth: (Then... we can conclude that the victim was definitely wearing a costume at the time.)\nVictim's Costume data jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay: OK! In that case, I'll update Little Thief's simulation parameters! I can't wait to see what we find out from this new info!\nEdgeworth: So the victim was wearing a costume when he died.\nKay: And with that, we should be one step closer to the truth, right?\nEdgeworth: (Hmm... I see the re-creation has changed in accordance with the new information.) We may be closer, but now, something else has caught my attention.\nOldbag: What do you want?\nEdgeworth: Your testimony, naturally. I'd like to hear it one more time, if you please.\nOldbag: I came to this stadium to take a short break. As I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area. Suddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground. It was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you!\nKay: So! Does this mean that Ms. Oldbag's testimony has a contradiction in it?\nEdgeworth: Yes, and I believe our best course of action is to compare it with your re-creation.\nKay: See! I just KNEW Little Thief would be of help! Now let's see if we can pull more info from Ms. Oldbag to put into the re-creation!\nEdgeworth: For that, we must first find the contradiction in her testimony.\nOldbag: I came to this stadium to take a short break.\nOldbag: As I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area.\nOldbag: Suddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground.\nOldbag: It was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you!\nEdgeworth: Knowing what we know now, thanks to your re-creation...\nKay: ...The contradiction stands out like a giant sore thumb!\nEdgeworth: Precisely. It's all becoming clear to me. Let's clear up this issue with some well-presented evidence, and get this over with.\nEdgeworth: Two men? How did you know the gender of the two people involved... ...seeing as how the victim was wearing a costume at the time!?\nOldbag: Ah!\nEdgeworth: Furthermore, I have another matter I'd like to inquire about! I'd very much like to know... ...why you failed to mention the costume in your testimony!?\nOldbag: Uwah!\nEdgeworth: I'm beginning to doubt if you really witnessed the murder at all.\nOldbag: But I'm telling you, I really did see it! I saw it with my very own eyes! .........From a seat in the second tier.\nEdgeworth: The second tier...?\nKay: Hey, didn't you say you saw it \"right in front of you\" earlier?\nOldbag: That was... you know... I was using the phrase in the metaphorical sense...?\nEdgeworth: (*sigh* I see our witness still has a screw loose, in the metaphorical sense.)\nOldbag: The cushy seats in the second tier are reserved for hot-shot VIPs. Which is exactly why I go there now and again to take a nap!\nKay: I can't see how you could've gotten a good look from there. It's so high up!\nEdgeworth: Were you able to see even the victim's costume from way up there?\nOldbag: Well, I know I saw two people. But I couldn't really see what they looked like because they were in the stage's shadow (In the shadow of the stage - It was hard to make out the killer and victim that Oldbag saw in the stage's shadow.). My eyesight isn't what it used to be, you know. Not like when I was young. Ah, people used to call me \"Eagle-Eyed Wendy\" back then! could spot a good man from 100 paces away as I walked down the street, just like that! Of course, they also noticed me in a flash and tried to make their move. But I'm not that easy! I was a careful girl with a judgmental eye! But I never let a good man slip me by, you bet I didn't! If you could've seen\nEdgeworth: *sigh* Let's return to our investigation, shall we, Kay?\nKay: You got it!\nEdgeworth: If that woman's testimony is to be believed... ...the murder occurred before the stage was broken down.\nKay: Do you want me to input that bit of info into Little Thief?\nEdgeworth: Yes, if you please.\nKay: OK!\nEdgeworth: There is clearly...\nKay: ...A contradiction here!\nEdgeworth: Please stop stealing my lines!\nKay: Oh, come on. It wasn't that hard to see it coming, even for a layman like me!\nEdgeworth: I suppose. In any case, it's not possible for the killer to have stood here in that way... ...because there was a very real stage set up in this spot at that time.\nKay: Yeesh, I told you I got it! Do you feel the need to explain everything!?\nEdgeworth: Yes, well... In any case, we still need to resolve this unusual situation.\nKay: Isn't it obvious? The killer was on top of the stage, naturally. Right, Ms. Oldbag!?\nOldbag: Yes! I remember now! The killer was standing on top of the stage!\nKay: See! Now let me update the info in the simulation.\nLang: Well, well, what have we here? A bunch of hooligans running amok, I see!\nEdgeworth: Agent Lang, how nice of you to join us.\nLang: Well, I can't have you going around messing up my crime scenes.\nEdgeworth: Agent Lang, we've discovered that the real scene of the murder is here, the stadium.\nLang: I see. Thanks.\nEdgeworth: For what?\nLang: I'm just trying to show you my appreciation for all the time you saved me. Who knew that such a strange little toy could re-create a crime scene like that.\nKay: Little Thief is NOT a toy!\nLang: ...You two!\nSir!\nLang: And there you have it. You see? Big boys like me don't need silly toys, little girl.\nKay: *sigh*\nLang: Now THIS is a re-creation.\nEdgeworth: So what? Do you still intend to assert that Officer Meekins is the killer?\nLang: Of course. Even knowing that the crime took place here doesn't let him off the hook.\nLang: This is the real scene of the crime. Officer Meekins lay in wait for the victim on top of the stage. And when the victim finally showed, he shot him from on high! That's the truth your little re-creation showed.\nEdgeworth: How far will you go to accuse Officer Meekins of the crime...?\nLang: He's the most likely suspect we've got, especially given the situation with his gun.\nKay: Well, even if he is the killer, at least my re-creation was on the mark.\nLang: You see? Thank you for understanding, my little crow-girl.\nKay: Grr... I'm not some common crow! I'm the Yatagarasu! The raven of legend!\nEdgeworth: Unfortunately, your conclusion has yet to be tested, so let's see how well it holds up.\nLang: This is the real scene of the crime.\nLang: Officer Meekins lay in wait for the victim on top of the stage.\nLang: And when the victim finally showed, he shot him from on high!\nLang: That's the truth your little re-creation showed.\nEdgeworth: Unfortunately, Agent Lang's conclusions do not contradict with our re-creation.\nKay: Hmm... Then, does that mean it all went down just as he says?\nEdgeworth: No, not quite. (I wonder if what we had re-created earlier was the whole truth?)\nEdgeworth: I'm terribly sorry, Agent Lang.\nLang: ?\nEdgeworth: I should have you warned you that our re-creation is incomplete. You cut in quite unexpectedly, after all.\nLang: What's that supposed to mean?\nEdgeworth: You said that the victim was shot by the killer from up above, correct? I hate to break it to you, but that's not possible.\nKay: Huh? Why not?\nEdgeworth: Recall Mr. Deacon's body, specifically, where the gunshot wounds were located.\nKay: .................. Actually, I didn't get that good of a look.\nEdgeworth: Oh. Well then. The bullet entered Mr. Deacon in his abdominal region, and exited his right shoulder. This is more consistent with an angled shot from beneath the victim.\nLang: Kngh!\nKay: Then...!\nEdgeworth: Yes, our re-creation had the victim being shot at an angle from above.\nKay: A clear contradiction!\nLang: You're discounting your own conclusions!?\nEdgeworth: No, this one point is the only flaw. This was the mistaken parameter in our re-creation:\nEdgeworth: Yes, the locations of the killer and the victim were wrong.\nLang: Ah, I get it. I see what you're trying to say!\nEdgeworth: I believe the killer and the victim were standing opposite to what we initially thought. It was the victim who was on top of the stage as he was being shot by the killer!\nEdgeworth: If this is [sic] what happened, it'd also explain the positioning of the gunshot wounds.\nKay: But then, what about the footprints?\nEdgeworth: Since footprints don't lie, we can assume then, that the killer also wore a costume.\nKay: OK! I'll try using that data instead!\nEdgeworth: Judging by the fact that both the killer and the victim were wearing costumes... ...I'd say it was a killing between the two kidnappers. That would be the most natural conclusion. Wouldn't you agree, Agent Lang?\nLang: Hmph. Well done, Mr. Prosecutor! But that alone doesn't clear Officer Meekins of the crime!\nLang: I ask that you take another good look at the tire marks over there. The three marks are indicative of the Blue Badgermobile. That story Officer Meekins told about that shop on wheels getting stolen was just a lie. He drove the Blue Badgermobile here and committed the murder. Then, he used the car to move the body to the garage in the Wild, Wild West Area.\nEdgeworth: You believe he moved the body with the car?\nLang: That's right. It was Officer Meekins himself who pointed us to the way he did it.\nEdgeworth: (The three-tired tread marks are very telling, however... ...is the Blue Badgermobile the only thing capable of creating such a pattern?)\nLang: I ask that you take another good look at the tire marks over there.\nLang: The three marks are indicative of the Blue Badgermobile.\nLang: That story Officer Meekins told about that shop on wheels getting stolen was just a lie.\nLang: He drove the Blue Badgermobile here and committed the murder.\nLang: Then, he used the car to move the body to the garage in the Wild, Wild West Area.\nKay: Looks like the only thing that car was selling was death, not dreams.\nEdgeworth: Only if what Agent Lang believes turns out to be true. (The three-tired tread marks are very telling, however... ...is the Blue Badgermobile the only thing capable of creating such a pattern?)\nEdgeworth: Sorry, Agent Lang, but that's an impossible tale.\nLang: And why is that?\nEdgeworth: Those tire marks could not have been left by Officer Meekins's Blue Badgermobile! One look at the car would've told you so! What proves that the Blue Badgermobile had never been to this stadium?\nEdgeworth: Take a good look at the tires. There's not a single dollop of mud to be found on it.\nLang: Nngh!\nEdgeworth: If this car had come to the backstage area and left those tire tracks... ...then the lack of mud on these tires stands out as very peculiar indeed.\nLang: Then, how do you explain the tire tracks, genius?\nKay: Hey! I've got it! What about Ms. Oldbag's Pink Badgermobile!?\nOldbag: Don't be ridiculous! I was sleeping the entire time in the second tier seats!\nEdgeworth: Indeed, I believe we can rule her out as someone related to the crime. However, there is yet one more roving store, as I recall.\nKay: Oh! You mean the Proto Badger!\nEdgeworth: That's right. There was one more parking space inside that garage. And it proves the existence of a Proto Badgermobile. Agent Lang, I suggest you find this Proto Badgermobile posthaste. There must still be some sort of incriminating evidence in it.\nLang: Nngh.........\n???: H.........\nKay: Hey, did you hear something?\n???: H.........Hel...... ...Help... me...\nKay: Are you alright!?\nLang: Well, this is something! Looks like we've found our kidnapping victim. Where were you all this time?\nLance: Wild West... With kidnappers...\nEdgeworth: (He was in the room next to the one I was held in!?)\nLance: Ran away using underground... and got lost... Th-The kidnappers...\nLang: Hm? What is it!? I can't understand what you're trying to say!\nLance: Th-The kidnappers... escaped... wearing costumes...\nLang: Did you see the faces of your kidnappers!?\nLance: No... I didn't see their faces... but... two... One was a w-woman...\nEdgeworth: (A woman...?)\nLang: Quite an important piece of testimony. Hey, what are you guys doing!? Stop standing there and get your cops on this already. I'll even let you guys have what the kid said just now. Consider it a gift. Now, are you going to get out of my crime scene, or am I going to have to get rough?\nEdgeworth: Akgn... (Again...?)\nEma: You're nothing but a big bully! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Let's go!\nLang: Oh, no, no, no. Not you. You're a very important witness for my case. I'm not about to let you get away that easily.\nEma: Don't count on me to testify, because I won't. Not for you!\nOldbag: That's right! I won't either! You hear me, you young whippersnapper!\nLang: Hey, calm down. There's no need for all this hostility. I just want to take a statement from each of you. I'm not going to rough either of you up. I give you my word. Come now, fair maidens. What do you say? Will you cooperate?\nOldbag: \"Fair maidens\"...? My, you little rascal! You sure know the way into a woman's heart.\nLang: Lang Zi says: \"The passage of time is but a fleeting moment,\" and a lady is young forever.\nOldbag: ...Hmph! Trying to outdo my Edgey-poo with your fancy-schmancy sayings. Let's get this over with. So we're clear, I'm only interested in giving you my statement.\nLang: Sure, just as soon as Mr. Prosecutor leaves us be.\nEma: Mr. Edgeworth...!\nTo be continued\n\n",

Tell me it's true! Tell me that you've really found my boy!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, Mr. Amano. We found him earlier in the stadium.\nPaups:\nThen... my little Lance is unhurt!?\nEdgeworth:\nHe's not exactly the picture of perfect health, but his life is not in danger. He's being questioned right now by Agent Lang.\nPaups:\nPoor Lance... It must've been so horrible for him... Locked up like a... *sob*\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErnest Amano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLance Amano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErnest:\nMiles, my boy, I can't thank you enough.\nEdgeworth:\nIt was nothing.\nErnest:\nI'm still in shock over what happened to Oliver... ...but I have to say I'm relieved that Lance is alright. Oh, that's right! I mustn't forget to pass this on to Lance as soon as the police are finished with him.\nEdgeworth:\nA letter?\n\n\n\n\nLetter (appears after \"Lance Amano\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErnest:\nAh, the way Lance is being chased after by women reminds me of someone I know. I almost can't believe he received yet another love letter, you know. Here! Take a look for yourself.\nEdgeworth:\n(Isn't this a breach of confidentiality?) It's a very simple love letter.\nKay:\nOh? Hey, let me see! Hm? That's really weird. It's from a loan company, \"Tender Lender\". Looks more like a collection bill to me.\nLove Letter data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nLetter (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErnest:\nAh, the way Lance is being chased after by women reminds me of someone I know.

What am I going to do without him...? I'm afraid my money will continue to be dampened by my tears in the long nights ahead.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Deacon's Pendant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis was found on the body of your butler...\nErnest:\nOliver...\nEdgeworth:\nBut what strikes me as odd is the name engraved on the back, \"Colin Devorae\"...\nErnest:\nOh...Coden Livorea? ...Veldor Dalein...?\nKay:\nHe's so sad that he's got it all mixed up in his mind.\nEdgeworth:\nI understand, but that last one wasn't even close.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLauren Paups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLance Amano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaups:\nHe loves me, he loves me not. He loves me, he loves me not... Aww, that's the 12th one! No, you can't give up, Lauren! Just one more try!\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me, but I can't help but feel a bit sorry for all the flowers you've gone through...\nPaups:\nI suppose... If they were me, then... *blush*\nEdgeworth:\nI believe you said that you are Lance's girlfriend when we first met, correct?\nPaups:\nYes, I am, but... Oh! It's not like we both think of each other as lovers! But he DID give me this ring, so I guess we're not just \"friends\" either...? I mean, because! This isn't just any ordinary ring! It tastes so sweet when you lick it! Ah! It's so wonderful!\nEdgeworth:\n(You mean to tell me that he gave you a lollypop ring...?)\nKay:\nSo which is it!? Have you guys not decided if you're going out, or is it just one-sided?\nEdgeworth:\n\"Decided\"...? Shouldn't the parties involved naturally just know...?\nPaups:\nMy father used to work for Mr. Amano. And so, Lance and I grew up together. ...*gasp!* I said it out loud!\nEdgeworth:\n(I don't see how that's anything to be embarrassed about...) So your father was an employee of the Amano Group? What did he do?\nPaups:\nI heard his job was to fly around the world... ...on Pegasus...\nEdgeworth:\nP-Pegasus!?\nPaups:\nOh, Pegasus was the name of the airplane. The airplane belonged to the company.\nKay:\nY-You had me there for a second...!\nPaups:\nBut now... It's all changed. My father... He isn't around anymore.\nKay:\nOh... I see...\nPaups:\nAbout 10 years ago, he rode in Pegasus off to somewhere, and never returned.\nEdgeworth:\n(Riding Pegasus to whereabouts unknown... Sounds like the stuff legends are made of.)\nPaups:\nIt's been so long... I don't think I'd recognize him if we were to ever meet again...\nKay:\nI'm so sorry, Lauren...\nPaups:\nBut I won't give in to the sadness! I have to live! Yes, Lauren! Live!\n\n\n\n\nAbout the case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAbout this incident...\nPaups:\nIncident? But isn't the kidnapping already over and dealt with? I've been here the whole time, so I'm afraid I don't know much about any other incident.\nEdgeworth:\nHow did you come to know that Lance had been kidnapped?\nPaups:\nOh! Ummm... That's because... of my woman's intuition!\nEdgeworth:\nYou based everything on that?\nPaups:\nI know everything when it comes to my Lance! It's really strange! It really must be destiny...! *blush*\nKay:\nArgh. She's started fantasizing again.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know what this is? It's a Prosecutor's Badge. I'm not a bad person, and I'm not out to seduce you. Come now, won't you talk...\nPaups:\nNo! You're showing that to me to lord over me with how much authority you have. Well, I will not be bullied! You should be ashamed of yourself, you evil man!\nEdgeworth:\n(...How should I repent in order for this woman to talk (changed from [woman talk] in the original release, fixing the typo) to me!?)\n\n\n\n\nGatewater Land Pamphlet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaups:\nThis right here is Lance's and my \"Castle of Love\"! It's the perfect new house for us made out of candies and sweets... But I can't seem to get the door open... Why?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause this is a theme park, and I highly doubt they would let you live here for real.\nPaups:\nYou won't let me in my own house...? You truly are a terrible man, you know that!?\nEdgeworth:\nWh-- But I have nothing to do with that!\n\n\n\n\nBad Badger's Head\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaups:\n...Aaaah! It's a monster! A hideous monster!!!\nEdgeworth:\nI know that it may look like a monster, however, I'd like to ask you about it...\nPaups:\nOh, Lance up in heaven, lend your little Lolli your strength!\nEdgeworth:\nBut he's not dead.\nPaups:\nIf you lend me your strength, I can defeat the bad monster and live a long and happy life!\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm beginning to suspect that you are not very good at this listening business.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Deacon's Murder Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAbout what we found when we examined the victim...\nPaups:\nAaaaAAaaaaAAAAAaaAaAAah!!!\nEdgeworth:\nWh--!?\nPaups:\nYou big bully! I can't believe you'd show me something so gruesome! But, but, I have to admit I kind of like that mavericky aura around him... Oh, Lauren... Are you becoming \"bad\" as well...?\nEdgeworth:\n(She's off in La-La Land again, I see...)\n\n\n\n\nMr. Deacon's Pendant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(If I show this to her, she'll probably just go on about another one of her fantasies.)\nKay:\nIf you're not going to show it to her, then why not give it to me for safe-keeping?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would I do anything of the sort!?\nPaups:\n?\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaups:\nLance and I met on a street corner by the crosswalk... I was so busy eating a loaf of bread that I ran right into him! It was destiny, as people like to say...\nEdgeworth:\n(I'll take that as she's not interested in this...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficer above footprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficer:\nMr. Edgeworth, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nG-Good work, officer...\nKay:\nHey, Mr. Edgeworth! I thought you wanted to talk with Mr. Amano and Ms. Paups?\nEdgeworth:\nI do... Perhaps I should start with them before I do anything else.\n\n\n\n\nOther officers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me, but if you could just let me through here...\nOfficer:\nSorry, I can't let anyone through. Agent Lang's orders.\nEdgeworth:\nNnngh... (I suppose I'll have to deal with this impasse for now.)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badgermobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this must be the Blue Badgermobile that Officer Meekins was driving...\nKay:\nHe said it was stolen, didn't he...?\nEdgeworth:\nDon't tell me that you were the one who stole it.\nKay:\nWhat the heck are you talking about!? I don't even have a license! It's illegal to drive a car without a license! A Great Thief doesn't break the law!\nEdgeworth:\n(This little girl has a very odd understanding of the word \"law\".)\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything of interest?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it, Kay? You look like you've stumbled upon something.\nKay:\nI'm kind of confused by all of the different events going on. First, there's the kidnapping, and then the co-conspirators of that end up in a murder. And Ms. Oldbag saw the crucial moment, but you and Ms. Oldbag are kinda...\nEdgeworth:\nWe do NOT need to investigate further into that last statement! (Disregarding the fact of who it came from, the witness's testimony was a mess. However, it did shed some light on the truth behind this case.)\nKay:\nWell, let's keep investigating and see what other types of people we run into, shall we!?\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLove Letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nI guess it's a love letter...? It reads kind of bitter-sweet.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that was [sic] all, I'd say it was nothing more than someone pining for Lance. However, the sender is the loan company \"Tender Lender\".\nKay:\n...Aaaaand the story takes a super-bitter downturn.\nAfter clearing all Talk options with Ernest Amano and Lauren Paups:\nKay:\nSo what are you going to do now, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nWe already established that there's a good chance that the killer is the other kidnapper. It's my duty to figure out who this other person is. I believe there is one location that might hold a clue or two.\nIsolation Room\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe place where we were held as prisoners!\nKay:\nHoooold it! Don't lump me in with you! I can't allow you to slander my good name as a Great Thief by saying I was \"captured\"!\nEdgeworth:\n(Not being able to escape from somewhere qualifies you as a caged bird, Kay.)\nKay:\nBesides, we checked that place out pretty well while we were there, remember!? Don't you think it'd be an even better idea to check somewhere else?\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps you are right. (What I really need right now are leads to the killer's identity...)\nLeads back to:\n\"I believe there is one location that might hold a clue or two.\"\nCrime scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's often the case that some clues are overlooked at the crime scene itself. Which means we should give the stadium another sweep.\nKay:\nThat's pretty good! Very \"professional prosecutor\"-like of you! And of course we'd go investigate if we hadn't just been tossed from there!\nEdgeworth:\n...True, and Agent Lang is still conducting his investigation there.\nKay:\nYeah, now get it together, will you, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nAlright, then. To do our part, we should leave them alone and investigate somewhere else.\nLeads back to:\n\"I believe there is one location that might hold a clue or two.\"\nKidnappers' Hideout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The obvious location is the kidnappers' hideout.\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe obvious location is the kidnappers' hideout.\nKay:\nBut we're still not allowed in, remember?\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang and his men should be done with this area. In that case, there is no harm in asking that officer over there to let us in.\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficer above footprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"What do you have to report?\"\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext step\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe next place to investigate...\nKay:\n...Is the kidnappers' hideout, of course!\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. And their hideout is...\nKay:\n...That room next to the one we were stuck in!\nEdgeworth:\n...Kay! I would appreciate it if you didn't steal the words from my mouth.\nKay:\nHa ha! But I can't help it, you know! I'm a Great Thief, after all!\nEdgeworth:\n(So the best that the \"Great\" Thief can do is petty theft of other people's words, huh?)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you have to report?\nOfficer:\nSir! Nothing unusual or out of the ordinary, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(? Where have I heard such redundancy before...?) Hmm... is it possible for you to let us take a look around inside?\nOfficer:\nSir! Roger, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(That was surprisingly hassle-free.) Are you certain? Didn't Agent Lang order you not to allow me in?\nOfficer:\nSir! That's true, sir, but... ...Detective Gumshoe asked me personally to let you in, sir! And I couldn't refuse a request from him!\nKay:\nWow, looks like Detective Gumshoe has a following!\nOfficer:\nFurthermore! I was asked to give this document to you, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this? The man in this picture... Isn't this Mr. Oliver Deacon?\nKay:\nBut the name here says \"Colin Devorae\"!\nEdgeworth:\n(That's the same name as the one on the back of the pendant.) It appears that \"Colin Devorae\" was his real name... What's this? He was convicted in a case 10 years ago and sent to prison.\nKay:\nWhat!? Then what was he doing here?\nEdgeworth:\nApparently, he broke out of jail... and then just vanished. He must have become \"Oliver Deacon\" to cover up the fact that he was an escaped felon.\nColin Devorae Dossier data jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay:\nNow I'm not sure what's going on anymore.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is there sort of link between the victim's past and this current case? These police documents are rather detailed. I should take the time to give them a thorough read eventually.) It's fine. Let's focus on one thing at a time, starting with the kidnappers' hideout.\nKay:\nYeah, I agree! We should investigate first, think later!\nEdgeworth:\nMore than thinking things through, I think you should try remembering things first. Now then, if you could please unlock the door, officer.\nOfficer:\nIt was locked up until a little while ago, but... ...since then, the door's been wide open, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nI'm not sure I follow what it is you're saying. Care to explain in a bit more detail?\nOfficer:\nSir! The door was locked down tight when they went to check out the room... ...so they got about ten officers to help out and break the door down, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nI see. (I guess that means I get Agent Lang's left-overs. Well, let's see what we find.)\nGatewater Land Main Gate (before clearing all Talk options with Ernest Amano and Lauren Paups, then talking to officer above footprints)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMan or little girl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis man looks suspiciously like the precinct...\nChief:\nLook at that lovely smile on the Blue Badger's face!\nDaughter:\nAaaah! It's looking at me! Make it stooooooooooop! It's scaaaaaaaaryyyyyy!\nChief:\nIt's alright, dear. You want to know something? I was the one who created the Blue Badger! See, look at his eyes. Don't they look just like daddy's?\nDaughter:\nIt's scaryyyyyyyy! It's scary because they do look like yooooooours, daddy!\nChief:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\nWell, that was rather depressing. I think I'd better leave the two of them alone.\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badger sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nWhy is there a Blue Badger here, too!?\nEdgeworth:\nAre you deathly allergic to him or something?\nKay:\nUm... It's not that. It's more the half-smile on his face; it's really unsettling.\nEdgeworth:\n(She's disturbed by the half-smile? I'm more disturbed by its movements and how it managed to obstruct an investigation.)\n\n\n\n\nFountain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nTo think they were but a hotel, now they have their own safari park attraction. Talk about a veritable goulash of rides and attractions.\nKay:\nWith so many of them, you'd think they would have a ninja house! Like one of those buildings with a zillion secret places to hide in! Those are fun!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, they don't.\nKay:\nHey! How can you be so sure!? Oh, I know! I bet they really do have one, but it's hidden in real ninja fashion! Come on out, ninja house! I know you're around here somewhere!\nEdgeworth:\n(A hidden ninja house... Next she'll be looking for a lost pirate ship!)\n\n\n\n\nOrnate lamp by fountain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThat lamp looks like it's got a lot of good stories to tell about the olden days!\nEdgeworth:\nOh? It looks incredibly new to me.\nKay:\nArgh! Mr. Edgeworth, you need to lighten up and get a sense of humor!\nEdgeworth:\nThat was rather rude! But just this once, I'll look the other way.\nKay:\n...On second thought, maybe the first thing you need to work on is tact.\n\n\n\n\nBridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThey say that couples who cross this bridge together will find happiness. Or so the Gatewater Land pamphlet says.\nKay:\nBut you'd think that they'd already be happy because they were able to come together.\nEdgeworth:\nLogistics aside, I wonder who came up with this tale and when? This bridge doesn't look old enough to be the stuff of legends.\nKay:\nWell, some things are better left uninvestigated, don't you think? Ignorance is bliss!\nMarch 13, 2:55 PM\nKidnappers' Hideout\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is where the kidnappers planned their foul deed...\nKay:\nWhile you were tied up for a while in the room next door, hee hee!\nEdgeworth:\nKay, please. Must you bring that up again? Now then, down to business. There might still be some clues left in this room. Let's try to find out what we can of the other kidnapper's identity.\nBegin Investigation\nKidnappers' Hideout\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoor on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nBeyond this door...\nKay:\n...Is where the kidnappers held you after getting the jump on you!\nEdgeworth:\n...Must you keep reminding me?\nKay:\nBut it's the room where I got to see your awesome \"Nnnghhhoooh!!\" face!\nEdgeworth:\nYou didn't need to remind me of that mortifying moment either...\n\n\n\n\nTable area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nPoster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA poster of Gatewater Land is stuck on this wall. \"Intrigue! Fun! Prestige! Gatewater Land has it all, and it's waiting for you!\" ...It's not especially catchy, is it?\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHm? I wonder what this key is to...\nKay:\nHmm... You got me.\nEdgeworth:\nIt reminds me of the key we found in the other room.\nKay:\nThat's it! This must be the key for one of those trapdoors!\nEdgeworth:\nThat wasn't a trapdoor. You only call it one because you quite literally jumped into it.\nKay:\nHey, but isn't that what you're supposed to do when you see one?\nEdgeworth:\nI am not having this conversation with you.\n\n\n\n\nCoffee cups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCheap, styrofoam cups.\nKay:\nHmm... Looks like only three cups (3 cups - They were on top of the table. The coffee looks like it was poured today.) were used.\n\n\n\n\nChairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nFolding chairs, and by the looks of it, they were probably used by the kidnappers.\nKay:\nHmm... There are three chairs (Folding chairs - Three of them were set up. It's very likely that the kidnappers sat in these.) set around the table.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable area (after examining chairs and coffee cups)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA sign advertising the photo rally, something I have absolutely no interest in.\nKay:\nYeah, but I do! And I'm going to get my hands on the rest of the Badger family! You'll see!\nEdgeworth:\n(She definitely brings a decidedly different atmosphere to a criminal investigation.)\n\n\n\n\nBroken mirror\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nWatch out, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a broken mirror... It probably came from the haunted house. (Why is this here? Are they planning to repair it?)\n\n\n\n\nFolded chairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nUnused folding chairs lean against the wall in their folded state.\nKay:\nWow, whoever lined these up did it perfectly! They're not even a single hair off! I'd feel bad using these because it'd be like stealing the perfection away!\nEdgeworth:\n(I suspect it's more like you wouldn't want to be the one to put them away.)\n\n\n\n\nHatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nHey, there's a trapdoor in this room, too!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's not a trapdoor; it's an entrance to an underground passage, Kay.\nKay:\nI know that!\nEdgeworth:\nThe door leading to the outside world was locked... ...so Lance must have escaped his prison through here.\n\n\n\n\nBlue bin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis must be where they dispose of old and worn-out costumes.\nKay:\nThat's so sad...\nEdgeworth:\nIt would seem that they throw the costumes away in pieces (Costume pieces - In the hideout, there is a trash bin for old and useless costumes.).\n\n\n\n\nBarrels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nOoh, they have barrels like these just outside.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, and?\nKay:\nWell, I know I already asked you when we were out there, but... ...if these were real, what would you put in them?\nEdgeworth:\n(There's an expectant gleam in her eyes that I'm about to dash...)\n\n\n\n\nDoor on right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis door is thoroughly broken thanks to the police who forced it open. (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nHatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe panel that hid the entrance to the underground is propped up and wide open. Be careful of where you step, Kay.\nKay:\nI only fell into that other opening once, you know!\n\n\n\n\nBroken doorknob\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThat doorknob handle-thingy is looking pretty beat up.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose that's what happens when ten officers break their way in with brute force.\nKay:\nHey, that's odd... The lock on this is completely fine. Look, not a single dent!\nEdgeworth:\nBut how is that possible after what that officer told us?\nKay:\nYeah! If the lock had been in use when the door was busted down... ...then the lock itself should be completely wrecked!\nEdgeworth:\nSo, the lock on the door leading to the outside (The door leading outside - The door had to be forced open, yet the lock is intact. Was it not locked?) is undamaged... How can that be?\n\n\n\n\nBroken sword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nLooks like a sword. A broken sword.\nEdgeworth:\n.........Strange. Why would it be broken (Broken prop sword - Found lying next to the door. Broken cleanly in half.) like that? Swords don't usually break on their own.\nKay:\nThat's true.\nEdgeworth:\nAlright then, let's think about it in this way: Maybe it broke when someone was trying to use it for or on something.\nKay:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nHypotheticals aren't going to get us anywhere. Perhaps we should think more on this later.\n\n\n\n\nBarrels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nOoh, they have barrels like these just outside.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, and?\nKay:\nWell, I know I already asked you when we were out there, but... ...if these were real, what would you put in them?\nEdgeworth:\n(There's an expectant gleam in her eyes that I'm about to dash...)\n\n\n\n\n\nDoor on right (after examining broken sword and doorknob)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis door is thoroughly broken thanks to the police who forced it open. (I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"3 cups\" and \"Folding chairs\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis common denominator between the cups and folding chairs... ...is the number three. Speaking of which... ...the number of missing costumes is also three.\nKay:\nWait. But I thought there were only two kidnappers...\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. Something isn't adding up... Literally. Is it possible there is a third kidnapper that Lance didn't see?\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"The door leading outside\" and \"Broken prop sword\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a bit strange that the police had to force their way into an unlocked room. One look at the pristine door lock, and anyone can see that it was not in use at the time.\nKay:\nBut the policeman outside said that it took 10 men to get it open!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... A door that was locked tight, despite it being not locked at all... It can only be because of this.\nKay:\nOh! You mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it was used to jam the door. Here, take a look at the door handle. Do you see how the handle is completely destroyed?\nKay:\nSo that's how the sword broke!\nBroken Prop Sword data jotted down in my Organizer.\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKidnappers' hideout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the room next to the one we were held prisoners in...\nKay:\nYou know, I took a peek in here through the door from the other room.\nEdgeworth:\nAs did I, Kay. Anyway, if this room was truly the kidnappers' hideout...\nKay:\n...Then that means there should be some clues to their identities here, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know if there are, however, the probability is quite high. I believe a thorough combing of this room is necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColin Devorae Dossier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nIn a way, you can think of it as he stole and hid himself away.\nEdgeworth:\nThis man was a fugitive. I imagine that was the only way he could live on the outside.\nKay:\nWell, people who do bad things don't deserve to be respected. The best way to live life is to follow the straight and narrow!\nEdgeworth:\n(How ironic that I'm getting a lecture on morals from a thief...)\n\n\n\n\nBroken Prop Sword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThis reminds me of a saying, \"Till one's sword breaks and one's arrows run out.\"\nEdgeworth:\n...Except that we are not dealing with any arrows.\nKay:\nI guess not. I wonder where they went? Oh, I know! I bet it's because I already stole them!\nEdgeworth:\n(I sincerely hope that she is kidding...!)\nAfter connecting all possible Logic:\nEdgeworth:\nI thought that we might uncover the true identity of the kidnappers... ...but instead, we've only uncovered more questions that need to be answered.\nKay:\nAaah!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What is it!?\nProto B.:\nWell, well! Mr. Edgeworth, am I correct?\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you doing, suddenly popping out of the secret entrance like that!?\nProto B.:\nThis is an underground passage used by staff members, sir. We Badgers also make use of it in our duties.\nKay:\nLook, why don't you get out of there first, and then we'll talk, OK?\nProto B.:\nAh, I beg your pardon, miss.\nKay:\nProto Badger GET! Alright! Only one more to go!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you getting all excited about?\nKay:\n*gasp!* Did you forget!? The photo rally, duh! See, look! Now, all I have to do is get a picture of the Bad Badger and I'm done!\nEdgeworth:\n(Ah, yes. I vaguely recall a contest or something of that sort...)\nProto B.:\nWh-What--!? It's gone! But where did it go!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? What happened?) What's wrong?\nProto B.:\nA Bad Badger costume is missing, sir!\nKay:\nOh, is that all! Well, it's missing because the kidnappers stole it.\nProto B.:\nI heard about how they were stolen... ...but they said that only three of the costumes had been taken.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat? (Is he saying that more than three of them are gone?) Mr. Proto Badger, please tell me a little more about these costumes you use.\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProto Badger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"What did you mean by 'a Bad Badger costume is missing'?\"\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything of interest?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nKay, are you participating in that Blue Badger Photo Rally?\nKay:\nYeah. I figure since I came all this way, I might as well. Plus, I want the prize.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prize?\nKay:\nIt's a handcuff-shaped notepad! Wait, or is it a notepad-shaped set of handcuffs?\nEdgeworth:\nEither way, they both sound incredibly useless.\nKay:\nHey! You don't know that! And I'm sure I can figure out what to use it for... Whichever it is.\nEdgeworth:\n(A notepad might be useful, but I don't see when she will ever need a set of handcuffs...)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat did you mean by \"a Bad Badger costume is missing\"?\nProto B.:\nWhy, just what I said, sir. We are one Bad Badger short. Counting the spares, we have two of each costume on hand at all times (changed from [time] in the original release, fixing the typo).\nKay:\nOK, so because one of them is walking around in the park...\nEdgeworth:\n...The other should be in that room.\nProto B.:\nAh, actually, both of them should be in that room.\nKay:\nHuh? What do you mean?\nProto B.:\nNormally, we don't use the Bad Badger costumes. In fact, we only use them during a certain event at a set time each day. It's the stage show where the Bad Badger wreaks havoc around the park... ...and the other Badgers must work together to apprehend him, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm speechless that such a show exists.\nProto B.:\nWell, sir, I was just trying to explain to you the only time we use that costume.\nKay:\nThen doesn't that make it near-impossible to take a picture of the Bad Badger!?\nProto B.:\nPersonally, I can't believe that it's this close to show time and there's no costume! Oh, dear. What am I to do, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nAll this basically means is that the kidnappers stole four costumes in total.\nKay:\nThen, are you saying that there are four kidnappers?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, I don't think that's very likely.\nKay:\nOh?\nEdgeworth:\nRecall the costumes for a minute.\nKay:\nThe stolen ones, you mean?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat proves that a fourth kidnapper does not exist?\nPresent Pink Badger costume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"If you had four people, and you had wanted to steal a fourth costume...\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nLooking here, you can plainly see that a fourth kidnapper is out of the question...\nKay:\n...Look where? Do you know what he's trying to say, Mr. Proto Badger?\nProto B.:\nN-No... I'm very sorry, sir, however, I must have missed something myself.\nEdgeworth:\nIt's alright. I zigged when a zag was more appropriate... (It's as simple as it appears. All I have to do is think a little to find the answer.)\nLeads back to:\n\"What proves that a fourth kidnapper does not exist?\"\nEdgeworth:\nIf you had four people, and you had wanted to steal a fourth costume... ...wouldn't you naturally go for the full set and steal a Pink Badger costume instead?\nKay:\nYeah, that makes sense!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd yet, the kidnappers decided to steal another Bad Badger. I believe the culprits needed two Bad Badger (Unaccounted for Bad Badger - A 4th stolen costume by the 3-person kidnapping group. Where's the other costume?) costumes, but the question is, \"Why?\"\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProto Badger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering, if you don't mind... ...Mr. Proto Badger, how did you know my name?\nProto B.:\nYou're pretty famous, sir. I would think that most people would know who you are.\nEdgeworth:\nFamous? Me?\nProto B.:\nAb-SO-lutely, sir. You're always very active in the community, I hear.\nKay:\nWow, I didn't know you were such a celebrity, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(I feel like I've met this person before... Maybe it's just my imagination...?)\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Costume pieces\" and \"Unaccounted for Bad Badger\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The second Bad Badger costume... I believe it may be closer at hand than we think.\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe second Bad Badger costume... I believe it may be closer at hand than we think.\nKay:\nHm? What do you mean?\nEdgeworth:\nThat costume in the trash... Wouldn't you say that it's wearing some very telltale pants?\nKay:\nHey, you're right! Let's get it out of there and take a look!\nEdgeworth:\nAs I suspected, it's a Bad Badger costume.\nKay:\nWell, minus the head.\nLeads to examination of Bad Badger costume\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBad Badger costume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfolded chairs on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere are three folding chairs over on this side. I can't say they were arranged nearly as nicely as their siblings to the right.\nKay:\nYou think so? I think they're just fine, like a bunch of used chairs ought to be.\nEdgeworth:\n...*sigh* I'm beginning to think you must keep a most chaotic room.\nKay:\nHey! Don't slander and sigh at me all in one shot!\n\n\n\n\nRight hand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nL-Look! Its hand is hurt!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? It looks more like something was ripped off of it.)\n\n\n\n\nCostume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder why this Bad Badger costume's right hand is torn up like that?\nKay:\nHmm... Maybe it's a flesh wound from a fight with the Blue Badger! I always knew the Blue Badger was one ferocious beast!\nEdgeworth:\n(I somehow doubt that even real badgers are as blood-thirsty as that, Kay.)\n\n\n\n\nFolded chairs on right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nUnused folding chairs lean against the wall in their folded state. The ones over by the table probably came from this stack.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeduce right hand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)\n\n\n\nPresent Blue Badger Bible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I believe what we have here is an inconsistency.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a clear contradiction of the facts!\nKay:\nHuh? What are you talking about!? Are you going to fill me in or not!?\nEdgeworth:\nWait, maybe it's not quite so clear...\nKay:\nEven so, it's still a contradiction, right?\nEdgeworth:\n...Or it might not be.\nKay:\nYou're acting really weird, Mr. Edgeworth. Just tell me if it's a contradiction or not.\nEdgeworth:\nMnngh! My apologies... (There is definitely something off about this costume. If only I could envision the truth in my head, I'd be one step closer to it.)\nLeads back to examination of Bad Badger costume\nEdgeworth:\nI believe what we have here is an inconsistency.\nKay:\nHm? Between what?\nEdgeworth:\nLook carefully. Our costume is not holding something in its right hand that it should be.\nKay:\nHmm... Oh, the gun!\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. The Bad Badger was designed to always hold a gun in his right hand. However... You there! Did you remove the gun from this Bad Badger's right hand?\nProto B.:\nNo, I did not, sir. The gun is supposed to be securely attached to the costume.\nEdgeworth:\nAs I thought. The rip itself confirms my hypothesis that the gun was forcibly removed. Mr. Proto Badger, the gun is, of course, not a functioning weapon, correct?\nProto B.:\nAb-SO-lutely not, sir. It's just a model gun. However, it can fire blanks. We need to use them for the stage show.\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems that our kidnappers also had a need for the model gun, my dear costumed friend.\nMissing Model Gun data jotted down in my Organizer.\nInvestigation Complete\nEdgeworth:\nI think we're about done with this room.\nKay:\nSo, what's next?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, we found a few answers... ...but there are still a few things left that we have to ask a certain person about. Let's go, Kay!\nMarch 13, 3:34 PM\nWild, Wild West area\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth, sir! You've gotta hurry, sir! Come on!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThey found a Blue Badger costume down in front of the main gate, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nKay:\nIsn't that what one of the kidnappers was wearing!?\nGumshoe:\nBingo! That's why you've gotta come to the main gate with me right now! If we hurry, we still might be able to get there before Wolf-boy does, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nAlright.

Then let's get down to it.\n\n\n\n\nForensics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you the one who moved the costume out from the tall grass?\nForensics:\nSir! Yes, sir! I moved it as I was instructed to by Detective Gumshoe, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is that a hint of hero worship towards Gumshoe I detect in his voice...?)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badger costume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nSilver object in neck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"What do we have here?\"\n\n\n\n\nCostume body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nIt's the Blue Badger's body section. What a waste.\nEdgeworth:\nHow so?\nKay:\nGoing through all the trouble to steal this costume, only to throw it away in the end...

This must be the Blue Badger Officer Meekins crossed paths with.\nGumshoe:\nOoh, the nerve of someone throwing a Blue Badger away like this! I worked so hard to create this character; it's like my baby! How could someone do this, sir!? How!?\nEdgeworth:\nDetective. How about channeling your anger towards finding the culprits?\nGumshoe:\nGood idea!

Talk about a veritable goulash of rides and attractions.\nKay:\nWith so many attractions, you'd think they would have a ninja house! Like one of those buildings with a zillion secret places to hide in! Those are fun!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, they don't.\nKay:\nHey! How can you be so sure!? Oh, I know! I bet they really do have one, but it's hidden in real ninja fashion! Come on out, ninja house! I know you're around here somewhere!\nEdgeworth:\n(A hidden ninja house... Next she'll be looking for a lost pirate ship!)\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice anything?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou look rather deep in thought. Care to share?\nKay:\nHmm... Now, it might just be my imagination, but that costume earlier... ...I think we need to take another good look at it.\nEdgeworth:\nYou feel that there might be something else there?\nKay:\nHmm... I can't say, but I really feel like we should give it another once over.\nEdgeworth:\nAlright, I'll see to it that we do.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do we have here?\nKay:\nOh, it's another pendant! That's two treasures in one day! How lucky is that!? And hey! This pretty baby's made of platinum silver, too!\nEdgeworth:\n(Another pendant on top of the one we found on Mr. Deacon?

It has a rather nice aesthetic to it.\nKay:\nHey! Nice to see that even you can appreciate its beauty! Things made of platinum silver tend to have a nice feeling about them, you know?\nEdgeworth:\n...I was only talking about its shape, Kay.\nKay:\nOh, is that what you were talking about...? Umm... but you know... ...if we're talking about wing shapes, I think the broach on my scarf is way cooler!\nEdgeworth:\nBut that's not made of platinum silver, is it...?\nKay:\n...It's hand-made, OK? So I'm sorry that it's not made of the expensive stuff!\nEdgeworth:\n(She made that by herself...!? ...It's incredibly well-crafted...)\n\n\n\n\nName on back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\"Lauren D.\" is engraved into this pendant.\nKay:\nI see that they wrote out her first name, but why just the \"D.\"?\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe it's the result of poor planning?\nKay:\nI guess... Well, at least if I had to shorten my name, I could make it \"K. Faraday\"! That way, even if you just sounded it out, it'd still say my name, \"Kay Faraday\"!\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose if I had to do the same, I would also abbreviate it (changed from [rather it be abbreviated] in the original release) as \"M. Edgeworth\".\nKay:\nHold on! I think you should abbreviate it as \"M. E.\" Get it!? Ha ha!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Who would've thought that this little pendant could stir up such a strange conversation?)\nLang:\nAha! We have you now, Ms. Kidnapper!\nPaups:\nNo, you don't understand! I... I...!\nLance:\nLolli... I can't believe you were one of my kidnappers...\nPaups:\nLance...\nEdgeworth:\n............\nKay:\nYou're kidding! Ms. Paups was one of the kidnappers!?\nPaups:\n..................Yes. It... It was me... I held Lance hostage...\nEdgeworth:\n(So Ms. Paups is one of the kidnappers... But even knowing that, I can't call this case solved... or over.)\nLang:\nHey! Guys! Case closed! Get the car ready, and I mean the special one for this young lady!\nEdgeworth:\nLang:\nHeh. Again, Mr. Prosecutor? What is it this time?\nEdgeworth:\nAre you proposing that Ms. Paups is also the culprit in the murder case? What happened? I thought Officer Meekins was your suspect.\nLang:\nHmph! We found it...\nEdgeworth:\nFound what?\nLang:\nThat officer's gun. He literally dropped it in the middle of a thick patch of grass. Your country's police are a sham. Just look at how careless they are!\nGumshoe:\nWho are you calling a \"sham\"!?\nLang:\nThe officer's gun didn't show signs of having been fired, so it can't be the murder weapon.\nEdgeworth:\n(So Officer Meekins has been cleared of all charges, I see...)\nLang:\nAnd that's when a brand-new suspect comes walking onto the scene. The murder only happened because the kidnappers started fighting amongst themselves. As I recall, it was you who said that, right, Mr. Prosecutor?\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nKay:\nMs. Paups! Did you... Did you really kill Mr. Deacon...!?\nPaups:\n.................. I... Yes, I killed him.\nKay:\nI-I can't believe it...\nLang:\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Thanks for the confession!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang, it's much too early to declare this case closed!\nLang:\nLook at you, so sure of yourself. We've got the culprit's own confession and some very incriminating evidence. What more could you ask for?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Lauren Paups.\nPaups:\nY-Yes!?\nEdgeworth:\nI want to hear it from you. Tell me your side of all that has happened today, from the kidnapping to the murder.\nPaups:\nB-But why? I... I'm a kidnapper and the killer! Isn't that enough!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's fine if you're the one behind everything, but only if that is the truth.\nPaups:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, will you tell us the truth? Or is there some reason why you can't?\nPaups:\n..................\nLang:\n.................. I've had a change of heart. I think I'd enjoy seeing you sulk away as the losing mutt. Alright, you heard me. Let's hear about all the evil deeds you committed today.\nTestimony\n-- Ms. Paups's Confession --\nPaups:\nThe one who came up with the kidnapping plan was the butler, Mr. Deacon.\nWe knew that we could get rich by holding Lance hostage.\nMr. Amano would pay anything to get his son back, after all.\nEverything was going according to plan, but as soon as we got the money...\n...Mr. Deacon turned on me, and tried to kill me!\nLang:\nThere. Are you satisfied? She just confessed to her crimes a second time. At least you have the guts to admit what you've done. I can at least respect that much.\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Paups... Is what you said really the truth?\nPaups:\nY-Yes... it... is...\nEdgeworth:\n(If that is the truth, it certainly isn't the whole truth. Because there is something that seems a bit too improbable in her confession.)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: How well did you know the victim? Paups: I've spoken with him only a few times at Lance's house. Edgeworth: A \"few times\"? That's it? Paups: ...Um, yes. Edgeworth: (If they only met a few times, I don't see how they could've trusted each other...) Kay: But if you hardly ever talked, then how could he trust you not to steal his plan? Lang: Lang: That's completely irrelevant. He was planning to betray her from the very beginning. Which is why he chose someone he wasn't especially close to. Isn't that right, Shih-na? Shih-na: Yes, however, Mr. Deacon made a very poor choice. In the end, he was killed by the one he intended to betray himself. Lang: Hah! I bet he didn't see that one coming! Edgeworth: ......... Paups: .........\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You knew? How did you know something like that? Paups: Aah! Oh, no! What should I do...? Edgeworth: ............Kay, what's wrong with her now? Kay: Come on, isn't it obvious!? You're making your scary face again, that's why! Why don't you try asking her in a nicer, more gentle way? Edgeworth: Hmm... Paups: No, stop it, Lauren! You're always like this! You always fall for the stern-looking one... That's why you'll always be unhappy! Kay: ............Or maybe that's it. She's been bewitched by your icy glare. Edgeworth: Mind your own business, Kay. ...Now then, Ms. Paups, let's continue with your testimony. Paups: Oh! Y-Yes, of course!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Why did you believe that? Paups: Anyone who knows Mr. Amano would think the same... Kay: I bet Lance is that old man's greatest \"treasure\". Edgeworth: (I suppose he would be to a doting father like Mr. Amano.) Paups: I always figured that was it, too. And I was always envious of Lance for it. Kay: Oh... Because your dad's... Paups: I got this pendant from my father... And I believe that as long as I have this, I'll find my father again someday. He'll welcome me into his arms, riding on the back of Pegasus. Edgeworth: (That pendant... She must truly believe it to be the wings of Pegasus.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Would you mind telling us a little about the plan itself? Paups: Well... First, we captured Lance... Kay: Ooh, how did you do that? Paups: Um... That... Well, Mr. Deacon did that on his own, so I don't quite know... Kay: Bah. And here I thought you knew how to steal people away. Edgeworth: (I shudder to think what she would do with such knowledge..) Paups: Sorry, I really don't know, but somehow, Mr. Deacon was able to contain him. All we had to do after that was wait for the ransom to be paid, but...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Why do you think he did? Paups: I have no idea. But maybe he had planned on doing so from the very beginning. Kay: ...Ms. Paups... Paups: .................. Edgeworth: (Wait. Mr. Deacon planned to kill Ms. Paups from the very beginning...? Was that ever really likely to happen? What should I do? Should I raise an objection?) Raise an objection Edgeworth: I'm sorry, but I don't think what you just claimed is all that likely. Paups: Huh? Edgeworth: I don't think Mr. Deacon would have ever been capable of killing you. Paups: But why!? We were total strangers! It's not uncommon for people to kill each other over money... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Ms. Paups, you really are clueless, aren't you? Paups: Wh-What do you mean? Edgeworth: You never knew what your role in the kidnapping was, nor do you know who you really are. But I do, and I can show you with this piece of evidence! This proves that Mr. Deacon wouldn't have been able to bring himself to kill Ms. Paups! Present Mr. Deacon's Pendant Edgeworth: Paups: Why are you showing this to me...? Lang: So what about the pendant!? Edgeworth: This horse pendant, along with this piece of evidence, shows who you really are! Present Ms. Paups's Pendant Edgeworth: Leads to: \"These two pendants resemble each other, wouldn't you agree?\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Paups: Does that really have anything to do with the pendant?

Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor. Are you sure the one who doesn't know anything isn't you? Edgeworth: Nngh! (I guess this wasn't it... Alright, I should calm down and listen to Ms. Paups's testimony once more... ...and take another good look at what is in my Organizer.) Lang: Hah, I see kidnappers also weep when they get stabbed in the back. Even as you betray the one you claim to \"love\" the most! Paups: That's... No... You don't understand... Lang: What's there to understand? Paups: ............ Leads back to rebuttal Don't raise an objection Edgeworth: (No, I shouldn't show my hand this early on. Let's see where the rest of this testimony takes me first.) Lang: Hah, I see kidnappers also weep when they get stabbed in the back. Even as you betray the one you claim to \"love\" the most!

But I do, and I can show you with this piece of evidence!\nPaups:\nWhy are you showing this to me...?\nLang:\nSo what about the pendant!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis horse pendant, along with this piece of evidence, shows who you really are!\n\n\n\nPresent Ms. Paups's Pendant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"These two pendants resemble each other, wouldn't you agree?\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nPaups:\nDoes that really have anything to do with the pendant?\nLang:\nWhat the heck, of course not!\nEdgeworth:\n...I suppose not.

I... kinda feel sorry for her.\nEdgeworth:\n(I feel a little sorry for her, too, however, I also wish she would tell us the whole truth. Because there is something that seems a bit too improbable in her confession. But I'll give it another careful listen and see.)\nEdgeworth:\nThese two pendants resemble each other, wouldn't you agree?\nKay:\nHey, you're right! They're the same color, and they're even made of the same material!\nEdgeworth:\nI believe that these two pendants are actually one.\nPaups:\nEhhhh!?\nEdgeworth:\nShall we give it a try?\nKay:\nWow! It's...! It's totally Pegasus!\nPaups:\nB-But why!? Why does my pendant match up with Mr. Deacon's!?\nEdgeworth:\nYou're a smart lady. I'm sure you can imagine why that might be.\nPaups:\nWh--! No! That can't be!\nLang:\nSo the two make a set. Heh! It's just another trinket. It's not as though this changes anything!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. You lack imagination, Agent Lang. Very well, I'll show you with this evidence! This is the piece of evidence that gives meaning to the Pegasus pendant!\nPresent Colin Devorae Dossier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"'Oliver Deacon' was just an alias for this man.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis piece of evidence clearly does not demonstrate the meaning behind the pendant.\nKay:\nAnd? So what?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hold your horses. I believe there might exist a piece of evidence that can better explain the meaning...\nLang:\nYou \"believe there might\"? If you have it, why are you playing coy with it!?\nEdgeworth:\nNngh! Very well then, prepare yourself!\nLeads back to:\n\"This is the piece of evidence that gives meaning to the Pegasus pendant!\"\nEdgeworth:\n\"Oliver Deacon\" was just an alias for this man. His real name was \"Colin Devorae\", the name that is etched on the horse pendant.\nLang:\nWhat!? An alias!?\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose he had to hide the fact that he was a felon somehow in order to live. And it makes sense, given what is written in Mr. Devorae's dossier. But what I really wanted to point out was this. This specific section is what reveals the true meaning behind those pendants!\nPresent \"sole daughter\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Devorae had one daughter.\"\nPresent mugshot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sure I'm not the only one who recognizes this face.\nKay:\n...Isn't that the murder victim?\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely.\nLang:\nAnd? Don't tell me that's it?\nEdgeworth:\n...I still have yet to figure it all out. (The truth is buried in here somewhere! I just need to read it in a little more detail!)\nLeads back to:\n\"This specific section is what reveals the true meaning behind those pendants!\"\nPresent \"Colin Devorae\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHis real name was \"Colin Devorae\", the name that is etched on the horse pendant.\nLang:\nWhat the--!? Do you pay attention to what you say!? You just told us about his alias a few seconds ago! And in the exact same words!\nEdgeworth:\nKnngh! (Written in here is something other than the victim's real name that is very important.)\nLeads back to:\n\"This specific section is what reveals the true meaning behind those pendants!\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI'd like you to take a look at around this area...\nLang:\nLang Zi says: \"The timid never reach the land of Truth.\" You'll have to be more specific than that if you want to convince me!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh! Do I have to spell it out for you? Alright then, I'll direct you to the exact section.\nLeads back to:\n\"This specific section is what reveals the true meaning behind those pendants!\"\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Devorae had one daughter. And her name is Lauren Paups.\nPaups:\nThat's a lie! That person was not my father!\nEdgeworth:\nHe couldn't come out and tell you he was your father because he was in hiding. However, I believe he was trying to secretly watch over you.\nPaups:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\nDo you still believe that a man like that could kill the daughter he was separated from? Or even, that such a man would allow his daughter to get involved in a kidnapping plot?\nLang:\nLang:\nHa ha ha ha!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what is so funny, Agent Lang?\nLang:\nYou're good at making things up in your head and deciding it's the truth, aren't you?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you trying to say?\nLang:\nYour thinking is much too innocent. After all, I've thought of another possibility.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so? Well, let's hear it.\nArgument\n-- Another Possibility --\nLang:\nI'll grant you that the two of them are father and daughter.\nBut, isn't it possible that they both knew that fact?\nIt was no coincidence that the reunited pair became involved in the house of Amano.\nAnd the two of them made good use of their meetings to plan this little kidnapping.\nWouldn't you say my scenario is perfectly probable as well?\nEdgeworth:\n(So this is his version of how things might have been...)\nLang:\nYou don't have any proof that either one didn't know of their true relationship, right?\nKay:\nYou mean they knowingly committed the kidnapping as father and daughter?\nLang:\nThat's right. As one really rotten family!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is that really what happened? I had better take a long, hard look at the evidence.)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Precisely. And what father would ever willingly kill his own daughter? Lang: Lang: I've seen a lot of things in my travels... ..and I can tell you that being related by blood is sometimes proof of nothing.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You think they knew? Lang: Yeah, I don't think only the victim knew. I think the girl realized it as well. They both knew who the other person was, but they had to pretend that they didn't. Edgeworth: Because he was on the lam? Lang: You got it. The victim couldn't exactly go around flaunting who he was. Furthermore...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: One as a butler, and one as the friend of the son, you mean? Lang: They probably thought that was their best shot. Edgeworth: Is that what you honestly believe? Lang: Of course.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean how they plotted to commit this crime as blood relatives? Lang: Can you think of a better partner? They're certainly a clever pair. Edgeworth: The butler and the girlfriend. No one would ever suspect that they were, in fact, family. Lang: Yes, from the very beginning, they painstakingly practiced those roles well.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I believe you're being a bit too over-confident for someone with no evidence. Lang: Am I? Because I don't see you presenting any evidence to the contrary. Edgeworth: Mnngh... (*sigh* Without evidence, we're stuck in a stalemate (changed from [Without evidence to counter him, we're stuck at a draw] in the original release).)\nEdgeworth: (Agent Lang isn't wrong; his scenario is certainly a probable one.)\nKay: You'd better hurry up and do something, or Lauren's gonna wind up looking really bad.\nEdgeworth: I know, but first thing's first.

(Did the two of them really knowingly commit the crime as father and daughter?)\nEdgeworth:\nThis kidnapping wasn't planned by just two people alone.\nLang:\nAnd what kind of proof do you have of that!?\nEdgeworth:\nQuite simply, there were three kidnappers.\nLang:\nThree!?\nEdgeworth:\nFour costumes were stolen from the Wild, Wild West area's backroom. We found one of them in the kidnappers' hideout. But as for the other three, we can assume they were being worn by three different people. We also found a set of three cups and three folding chairs that were used in the hideout. It all clearly points to a three-man group!

Who is the mastermind behind it all?\nLeads back to:\n\"I present to you, the brains behind the kidnapping!\"\nLang:\nLance Amano!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, this abduction was, in fact, schemed up by Lance himself! Recall what he said when he appeared before us.\nLang:\nDid you see the faces of your kidnappers!?\nLance:\nNo... I didn't see their faces... but... two... One was a w-woman...\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, there were three kidnappers, which is in direct contradiction to what he said.\nLance:\nBut, but... I know I only saw two people...\nLang:\nThis guy was being held hostage. It's possible he couldn't see all three of them.\nEdgeworth:\nAh, yes, about when you were being held... I have my doubts about what happened then. Lance, would you mind telling us what happened while you were being held captive?\nLance:\nI really don't remember much anymore... Honest... But if I don't tell you at least something, you won't believe me at all, will you?\nTestimony\n-- Lance's Testimony --\nLance:\nI was kidnapped yesterday morning.\nThey had me shut in that room, blindfolded, the entire time.\nBut the kidnappers suddenly disappeared around the time I heard rain falling outside.\nMy hands were cuffed, but it was a stroke of luck that they left me alone.\nI made my escape and ran away from that room as fast as I could.\nEdgeworth:\nThrough the underground passageway, I presume...?\nLance:\n............\nLang:\nAre you OK?\nLance:\nSorry, I really didn't want to recall that horrible ordeal, but... ...but now you believe me, right?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, not quite yet.\nLance:\nAaah! How can you not!? Why do you look at me with icy daggers in your eyes?\nLang:\nBecause he's a prosecutor. and because they're all like that.\nEdgeworth:\nI'll have you know, Agent Lang, a prosecutor's eyes are for discerning the truth. And should they be interpreted to be cruel at times, then so be it.\nLang:\n............Tch.\nEdgeworth:\n(There is a sticking point in Lance's testimony. Let's see what he offers up when I push a little.)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Can you tell us about when you were abducted in a little more detail? Lance: It was a strange morning. I felt like I was right in the middle of a great calm. Edgeworth: And where were you when you experienced this... calm? Lance: Our family garden, of course! Where else could it have been!? Edgeworth: (Well! Excuse me for asking! This child is more princess than prince...) Lance: I was out taking a walk to shake off the morning blah. Then, out of the blue, someone from behind clamps a hand over my mouth. Edgeworth: You didn't see your attacker? Lance: They must've used some drug to knock me out. Because before I knew it, I was off in La-La Land again. When I woke up, I was in the kidnappers' hideout already, all tied up.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: By \"that room\", you mean the room in the kidnappers' hideout, correct? Lance: Yes, but I was blindfolded the whole time, so I didn't know that until I made my escape. Edgeworth: Then, you were in the same room as your kidnappers? Lance: They spoke in hushed tones, but I could catch bits of their conversation. It was definitely two people, and one of them was definitely a woman. I was so scared. I could tell they were nearby, so I didn't dare make a move.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: The kidnappers disappeared? Lance: The room fell into a sudden silence. I had been left behind like an unwanted mutt. Edgeworth: And what do you mean by \"unwanted mutt\"? Kay: What a pointless question. It's not like he's going to tell you anything new, you know. Lance: It's a poetic simile. You should learn how to use them, too. You may look refined on the outside... ...but it's no good if you're not refined on the inside as well.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Then, those cuffs on your wrists... I suppose you are still cuffed, in that case. Lance: I am well aware of how I am chained to reality. I couldn't find the key, so I'm afraid that I'm stuck like this. Even though I escaped from that jail cell, I will forever be a prisoner.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: How did you manage to escape? Lance: I wanted to just get out of there, but the door leading outside was locked. Which is why I had to use the underground passageway to make my escape. Edgeworth: (I remember our escape to be equally as hard... This is an invaluable piece of testimony. I mustn't let it go unexamined.) Adds statement \"The door leading outside was locked tight, so I had to use the underground passageway.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: By \"underground passageway\", you mean the one the staff uses to travel unnoticed? Lance: I suppose that's what it's for, but I didn't run into any staff members on my way out. And once I was up top, I was busy trying to find a member of the police. Edgeworth: And that is when you found us congregated at the stadium, I suppose? Let me ask you, then. How did you get ahold of the key to the underground door? Lance: That was easy. It was hanging right there in the room on the wall. Edgeworth: (I do recall a key hanging on the wall right beside the table...)\nKay: Boy does that bring back memories of our situation and how we made our escape.\nEdgeworth: Indeed. And although the door in the floor of our room led to an underground room... ...the door in the floor of the room next door had a secret passageway.\nKay: A secret passageway under a theme park! Ooh, that just sounds like so much fun!\nEdgeworth: (I wonder... Is there something off about the way Lance made his escape...?)",

I mustn't let it go unexamined.)\nAdds statement \"The door leading outside was locked tight, so I had to use the underground passageway.\"\nLance:\nThe door leading outside was locked tight, so I had to use the underground passageway.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBy \"underground passageway\", you mean the one the staff uses to travel unnoticed?\nLance:\nI suppose that's what it's for, but I didn't run into any staff members on my way out. And once I was up top, I was busy trying to find a member of the police.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that is when you found us congregated at the stadium, I suppose? Let me ask you, then. How did you get ahold of the key to the underground door?\nLance:\nThat was easy. It was hanging right there in the room on the wall.\nEdgeworth:\n(I do recall a key hanging on the wall right beside the table...)\nPresent Broken Prop Sword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You say that the door leading out was locked, but was it really?\"\nKay:\nBoy does that bring back memories of our situation and how we made our escape.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. And although the door in the floor of our room led to an underground room... ...the door in the floor of the room next door had a secret passageway.\nKay:\nA secret passageway under a theme park! Ooh, that just sounds like so much fun!\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder... Is there something off about the way Lance made his escape...?)\nEdgeworth:\nYou say that the door leading out was locked, but was it really?\nLance:\n!\nLang:\nWe're talking about that room behind the saloon front, right? Look, I heard that it took quite a few men to get that thing open. Right, Shih-na?\nShih-na:\nYes, that's correct.\nEdgeworth:\nThen, take a look at this!\nLang:\nWhat is that? A sword? It's not an especially reliable one if it's broken like that!\nEdgeworth:\nAllow me to start from the end. My conclusion is that the door was never locked. It was simply held shut by this sword, which was used to jam the handle.\nLance:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nLance, even though your hands were cuffed together, you could still use them. If that's the case, then why did you not just simply remove the sword and escape?\nLance:\nWh-Why didn't I...? I was disoriented... Yes, that's it! I didn't notice it!\nEdgeworth:\nAs if I should accept such a bold-faced lie! You locked yourself in that room because you had to make yourself look like the victim. But you did not, in fact, possess the key to the door. That is why you used the prop sword to improvise and create a prison of your very own!\nLang:\nLang:\nYou've been making this guy out to be one of the kidnappers for some time now. I wonder if you've forgotten something very important along the way.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what would that be?\nLang:\nA motive! What else!? Do you honestly think that an upright, pure boy like him... ...would hatch up a completely pointless scheme such as kidnapping himself!?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThis proves that Lance did indeed have a motive to commit this crime!\nPresent Love Letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"To put it simply, Lance has a very urgent need... for money.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLang:\nThat is this boy's motive!? You lawyer-types sure have active imaginations! That type of flimsy logic may work in court, but it'll never stand up to my strict scrutiny!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh! This wolf's bite is far worse than his bark...\nLance:\nHmph! Serves you right!\nLang:\nLook, this boy has no motive whatsoever!\nEdgeworth:\nThat's where you're wrong. And I have the evidence to prove it.\nLeads back to:\n\"This proves that Lance did indeed have a motive to commit this crime!\"\nEdgeworth:\nTo put it simply, Lance has a very urgent need... for money. This is hardly your typical love letter. It is, in fact, a collections bill. It appears our upstanding boy has accumulated quite a debt. Isn't that right, Lance?\nLance:\nUuugh...\nKay:\nLooks like it's hard being the son of a rich man, too. It must be rough when you have to resort to stealing from your own old man, huh.\nLance:\nGnn! A-Alright! I give up! I abducted myself.\nPaups:\nLance!\nLance:\nIt's over, Lolli. In this life, we really are bound to our fates after all. All I wanted was to go with you to a new town, somewhere where no one would know us. I wanted us to be well off with that $1 million, but now... that dream is over.\nPaups:\nOh, Lance!\nEdgeworth:\nThen, you are giving yourself up?\nLance:\nYes. I had planned to run away from this world with my Lolli. Oliver even helped us with the plan, but then, he had to go and stab us in the back!\nEdgeworth:\nHe turned on you?\nLance:\nMaybe he didn't want to split the ransom money. That's my guess. It happened almost right after you made the drop-off. When we were alone, he attacked me all of a sudden. After a brief struggle, I was able to contain him and keep him under control. We left him inside that room as Lolli and I made our escape. We wore different costumes and split up. Lolli left first in the Blue Badger costume.\nEdgeworth:\n(That would mean the person Officer Meekins saw was Ms. Paups.)\nLance:\nBut right then, the old man just had to wake up! I was careless, and he tackled me pretty hard from behind. Then, Oliver put on a Bad Badger costume... ...took the suitcase with the million dollars and ran! I contacted Lolli right away, and warned her that he had a gun. They had no idea that they were related, so I thought that it could only end badly.\nPaups:\nI still don't believe it! That person was not my father! Because... Because if he was... I... I just killed my own father!\nEdgeworth:\n!\nLance:\nLolli! Then... Then it really was you...?\nTestimony\n-- Chain of Events --\nPaups:\nThat man was not my father! I mean... Because... at the stadium...\n...there was a Bad Badger pulling the suitcase with the $1 million in it.\nBut that Badger pointed his gun at me, aiming to shoot me dead!\nThat's why I... I used the gun I got from Lance...!\nThere was a gunshot, the other person crumpled to the ground, and I ran, scared for my life.\nLang:\nI think the big picture is finally coming into focus, don't you?\nLance:\nLolli... Forgive me. I didn't think it would turn into something so frightening. If only... If only I could've protected you!\nKay:\nSo... Ms. Paups... She shot her own dad without even knowing who he really was?\nEdgeworth:\nIf what she says is true...\nKay:\nAre you saying she's lying? But why would she lie about something like that!? What purpose would it serve!?\nEdgeworth:\nYou would be surprised how often people lie without even realizing it themselves, Kay.\nKay:\nHuh? What's that supposed to mean?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat I mean is, listen very carefully to her confession once more and you'll see.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Please calm down and let's slowly talk through this. Paups: But! I...! Edgeworth: All you have to do is simply tell us what happened at the stadium. Leave it to us to search out the truth. Can you do that for me? Paups: .........! A-Alright. So... at the stadium...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: That was the ransom money, wasn't it!? Paups: Yes. That's how I was able to identify Mr. Deacon almost immediately. It was all thanks to what Lance told me. Edgeworth: And what did he tell you? Paups: Well, he called me on my cell phone and told me... ...that Mr. Deacon had betrayed us and had run off with the ransom money. And... about how he had a gun.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Were you able to clearly see the gun? Paups: Yes, I got a very good look at it while it was pointed at me. Oh, father... Why would you try to shoot me? Kay: Do you really think a father would shoot his own daughter, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: I... don't know. Kay: I don't want to believe it myself... Paups: But it's true. My father's left arm was raised with a gun in it... ...pointed straight at me! \"I'm about to die!\" I thought. Edgeworth: Ms. Paups! Paups: ! Edgeworth: Please calm down, and take a breath. And then, would you allow me to please hear that last statement one more time? Paups: ...Y-Yes, of course. Changes statement from \"But that Badger pointed his gun at me, aiming to shoot me dead!\" to \"But that Badger pointed the gun in his left hand at me, aiming to shoot me dead!\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: And you felt that your life was in danger, correct? Paups: Yes. \"I'm about to die!\" I thought. So... So...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You shot Mr. Deacon...? Paups: .................. Kay: Ms. Paups... Paups: ..................Yes. I-I shot him. Edgeworth: ! Lang: Ha ha ha! And that, as they say, is that. Edgeworth: Agent Lang, Ms. Paups is far from done. She hasn't even finished her testimony yet! Lang: You're going to continue questioning her? What a waste of time. Edgeworth: Ms. Paups, if you please. Paups: ...Alright.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Did you take off immediately following the gunshot? Paups: Yes. Edgeworth: And you didn't attempt to approach the victim at all after he was shot? Paups: I... I was scared... Kay: I don't blame you. I would've done the exact same thing... Paups: ..................\nKay: Poor Ms. Paups... What will become of her, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth: She seems to be telling the truth regarding what happened at the stadium. However, I don't believe it to be absolutely correct.

Then!\nEdgeworth:\nThe person pointing a gun at you from atop the stage was not Mr. Deacon.\nLang:\nLang:\nHold on there, Mr. Prosecutor. I think you need to take a refresher course. The Bad Badger has a model gun attached to his right hand. Which is why the only hand he could've held the real gun with was his left. Isn't it possible that it went down like that?\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang, were you paying attention to what Ms. Paups was saying? Then again, I suppose I can't expect someone who has never set foot in court to catch it.\nLang:\nEnough with the smugness. Out with it already.\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Paups told us earlier:\nPaups:\n...there was a Bad Badger pulling the suitcase with the $1 million in it.\nEdgeworth:\nAccording to you, the Bad Badger had the gun in his left hand... ...which would mean that he was pulling the suitcase with his right hand. Is that correct, Ms. Paups?\nPaups:\n...Yes, exactly. And I'm sure it was the Bad Badger! It had those huge sunglasses on its face!\nLang:\nBut if that's the case, even I can see there is a huge contradiction!\nEdgeworth:\nYes. Ms. Paups claims to have seen the Bad Badger. And yet, the Bad Badger had both of his hands full. These two pieces of information contradict each other, so one must be wrong.\nIt wasn't the Bad Badger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Paups. What you saw was not the Bad Badger. Think back, and recall which character was it that leveled a gun at you.\nPaups:\nBut it was wearing a pair of sunglasses, and it had that strange blue beard.\nKay:\nThat sums up the Bad Badger pretty well, I'd say.\nLang:\nToo bad for you, but it looks like the Bad Badger wasn't the mistake here!\nEdgeworth:\nArrgn! (I need to think carefully about the facts here. Ms. Paups claims to have seen the Bad Badger. And yet, the Bad Badger had both of his hands full with something or another.)\nLeads back to:\n\"These two pieces of information contradict each other, so one must be wrong.\"\nBoth hands were not occupied\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHolding a gun in his right hand as he pulls the suitcase with the same hand... ...isn't it possible for a right-handed person to do both things simultaneously?\nLang:\nYour deduction is full of one too many conjectures, don't you think, Mr. Prosecutor?\nEdgeworth:\nArngh! I suppose it IS pretty difficult, if not impossible. It would appear that both of the Bad Badger's hands were occupied. Yet Ms. Paups claims to have seen the Bad Badger...\nLeads back to:\n\"These two pieces of information contradict each other, so one must be wrong.\"\nBoth are correct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"They are both correct.\"\nEdgeworth:\nThey are both correct.\nLang:\nImpossible! That just leaves us with an irresolvable contradiction!\nEdgeworth:\n(Ms. Paups's entire statement rests on the fact that she saw his sunglasses and beard. But what if that Bad Badger wasn't wearing pants on his lower half...?) This proves that there was a way for the Bad Badger to freely use both of his hands!\nPresent Bad Badger's Head\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The costumes have two parts to them, a head and the body.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLang:\nGet your head on straight, Mr. Prosecutor! That doesn't show me diddly-squat!\nPaups:\nI knew it. What I saw was just a miraaaaaage!\nEdgeworth:\nW-Wait! I can explain! Ms. Paups said the Bad Badger had a gun in his left hand and the suitcase in his right. But the Bad Badger costume has a model gun attached to its right hand... ...which is what created this contradiction about which hand did what.\nLeads back to:\n\"Ms. Paups's entire statement rests on the fact that she saw his sunglasses and beard.\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe costumes have two parts to them, a head and the body.\nKay:\nOh! I get it now!\nEdgeworth:\nThe head Ms. Paups saw was probably really the head of the Bad Badger. However, is it not possible that the body was that of an entirely different Badger?\nLang:\nA different Badger...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. Or to put it more bluntly, I believe it was the lower half of this Badger! The body of the Bad Badger Ms. Paups saw really belonged to this Badger!\nPresent Proto Badger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wh-What!? .........The heck is it!?\"\nPresent Bad Badger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nKay:\nIt was the Bad Badger's body...?\nPaups:\nThe Bad Badger...?\nLang:\nHa ha ha! You're a real laugh riot! You claim that the body was from a different Badger, and then do a complete 180! If the body of the Bad Badger was that of the Bad Badger, then we've resolved nothing!\nEdgeworth:\n(C-Curses!) P-Precisely! Therefore, the body of the Bad Badger must have been of a different one!\nLeads back to:\n\"The body of the Bad Badger Ms. Paups saw really belonged to this Badger!\"\nPresent Blue Badger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHis head may have been the Bad Badger, but his body was the Blue Badger's!\nLang:\nThe Blue Badger? Hold on, let's see here... Who was it that had one of these on...?\nPaups:\nI did...\nGumshoe:\nAnd so did Officer Meekins, pal...\nLang:\nHa ha ha! Nice try, but your logic is just a tad illogical! Officer Meekins has been placed under arrest, after all!\nEdgeworth:\nW-Wait! I'd like to strike what I just said from the record, and give my explanation anew...\nLeads back to:\n\"The body of the Bad Badger Ms. Paups saw really belonged to this Badger!\"\nPresent Pink Badger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nPaups:\nUmm... I think even I would've noticed that...\nKay:\nYeah, Mr. Edgeworth. The Pink Badger is, well, pink, after all.\nEdgeworth:\nNngh! Y-Yes, well, that may be true, but... I-In that case!\nLeads back to:\n\"The body of the Bad Badger Ms. Paups saw really belonged to this Badger!\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLang:\nI don't see a Badger where you're pointing, do you!?\nEdgeworth:\nS-Sorry. My finger must have slipped due to excessive force. Please allow me to try again.\nLeads back to:\n\"The body of the Bad Badger Ms. Paups saw really belonged to this Badger!\"\nLang:\nWh-What!? .........The heck is it!?\nShih-na:\nIt's the Proto Badger...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, and it's a simple matter of process of elimination. Ms. Paups was wearing the Blue Badger's costume, so we can eliminate that one. And the Pink Badger is of the wrong color, which would have been incredibly obvious. All that is left is the Proto Badger costume! Ms. Paups! Who was the one who wore the Proto Badger costume?\nPaups:\n.........Th-That... w-would be... Lance...\nLance:\n.........!\nLang:\nLang:\nAre you saying what I think you are!? That Lance Amano donned the Bad Badger's head... and pretended to be Mr. Deacon? On top of which, he plotted to shoot Ms. Paups while wearing that hideous thing!?\nEdgeworth:\nThe stage that was set up in the stadium was nothing more than that, a set-up... ...and its purpose was to lead Ms. Paups into believing she had committed murder. Standing there in front of Ms. Paups, and pretending to be the victim... ...it was all done so that she would pull the trigger.\nLance:\nHahahaha. I have no idea what you're talking about. Why exactly would I have had to do all that, huh!?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is but one reason. Lance Amano! You are the real culprit behind the murder of Mr. Oliver Deacon!\nLance:\nWhat!?\nPaups:\nN-No!\nLance:\nThat's slander! Take it back! You take it back right now!\nEdgeworth:\nJust out of curiosity, Lance, which is your dominant hand?\nLance:\nI-I'm left-handed... but what does that have to do with anything!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt depends. According to Ms. Paups, her attacker held a gun in his left hand.\nLang:\nLang:\nHah! Who is what-handed doesn't prove a thing! And besides! Now you're just being absurd! It's not like the Proto Badger is bulletproof. One misfire, and he would've found himself dead, right?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nOf course. Logically, if he had been shot, he probably wouldn't be here with us. But I believe he had thought of that as well, and prepared accordingly. And this should be all the evidence you need. This is how Lance made sure that he wouldn't be hit by a bullet!\nPresent Missing Model Gun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"We found one half of a Bad Badger costume in the hideout, a broken one.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHe prepared this, thinking he could set it up and use it to protect himself.\nLang:\nThat's completely illogical! Besides, you'd think it would've been mentioned in one of the testimonies by now!\nEdgeworth:\n......Hm. (Lance was pointing a gun, meaning it's unlikely he was using some sort of barrier. I may need to turn my entire logic on this upside-down.)\nLang:\nDo you really think he had a way to prevent himself from being shot?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's not impossible. Especially if he used this!\nLeads back to:\n\"This is how Lance made sure that he wouldn't be hit by a bullet!\"\nEdgeworth:\nWe found one half of a Bad Badger costume in the hideout, a broken one. It was not the same one that the victim was wearing. Plus, it was missing something. And that something is the model gun that the Bad Badger carries, which can fire blanks.\nLang:\nWh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Paups, where is the gun you used now?\nPaups:\nI... I threw it away into the sea.\nEdgeworth:\nThat... makes it a bit tough to verify what it was... Although, I believe that we can safely assume that it was the model gun in question.\nLang:\nLang:\nI've heard enough. All you've been spouting so far is pure conjecture.\nEdgeworth:\nI admit that as long as the model gun is lost to us, I can't prove I'm right. However, I can say that the probability that I am right is very high.\nLang:\nOK, let's pretend that you're right, and that the murder at the stadium was a fabrication. In that case, where do you think the murder really took place, Mr. Prosecutor!?\nEdgeworth:\nI... don't know yet.\nLang:\nHa! I knew you were full of it!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, I do believe that the murder took place during an earlier timeframe.\n???:\nPaups:\nPlease, wait a second! It's simply not possible! Because... Because... I saw Mr. Deacon after he was restrained by Lance.\nEdgeworth:\n(She saw the victim in the state of being restrained?)\nTestimony\n-- What Ms. Paups Saw --\nPaups:\nI came back to the hideout long after the other two.\nBy that time, Lance had already subdued and restrained Mr. Deacon.\nHe had tied Mr. Deacon securely to the beam in the room next door.\nAfter that, the two of us put on our costumes and made our escape.\nLang:\nSo Mr. Deacon must've escaped after the two of you left, right?\nPaups:\nWe thought that it'd attract too much attention if we left together, so I left first. We planned to meet up again at the stage in the stadium. But then! As I was walking through the park, I got a call from Lance on my cell phone.\nLance:\nOliver managed to escape. It looked like he was waiting until I was alone. He also stole the gun from me at that time...\nLang:\nAnd then, the murder happened. Mr. Deacon must have overheard their plan to meet up at the stage. Well, Mr. Prosecutor? Ms. Paups saw the victim with her own eyes... ...which means that the victim was still alive at that time, wouldn't you agree?\nEdgeworth:\n............ (Why does that sound wrong to me...? There must be something amiss about this account! Let's see what happens when I examine it in more detail.)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: When exactly did you arrive back at the hideout? Paups: It was after we had picked up the ransom money. Edgeworth: And where were you up until the time you returned? Paups: I was scouting the park out, and making preparations for our escape. I walked around in the various areas, looking for the best route. Edgeworth: (Ah, so each of them had their own roles to play.) Paups: After I was done, I went back to the hideout.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: How did Lance look at that time? Paups: He, well... He looked shocked. He also looked a little down. When I saw that sadness in his eyes, I... Edgeworth: Thank you, that's enough for now. And what of Mr. Deacon? What was his situation like?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You are sure that it was Mr. Deacon that you saw? Paups: Yes. I am certain of what I saw. Edgeworth: Did you go into the other room to check? Paups: Lance said that it was best if I didn't get too close to him... Lance... He's such a kind soul. Edgeworth: Then, are you telling me that you did not confirm that it was Mr. Deacon for yourself? Paups: I checked through the slit in the door that separates the two rooms. He had a Bad Badger's head on, so I'm absolutely sure. That just had to be Mr. Deacon! Edgeworth: (She saw a Bad Badger head?) Adds statement \"The captive had a Bad Badger's head on, so I'm absolutely sure it was Mr. Deacon.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So the tied-up Mr. Deacon was still in his Bad Badger costume? Paups: Yes... And...? Edgeworth: (It would appear that she misread the whole situation... What now? Should I raise an objection?) Raise an objection Edgeworth: The person you saw was not the victim. Paups: What!? Why not? Edgeworth: I will tell you why not... with this! This, Ms. Paups, shows us that the person you saw was not the victim! Present Bad Badger's Head Edgeworth: Leads to: \"Ms. Paups. The person you saw was not Mr. Deacon at all.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Paups: .................. Umm...

Lance was supposed to bring that with him. Lance: But Oliver stole it from me, along with the gun, when he escaped.\nKay: If Mr. Deacon was alive in the hideout, then the murder must've happened after that.

Are you serious!? Or perhaps you believe there was a rip in the space-time continuum?\nEdgeworth:\n(Nnngh...! Who was it that was tied up to that beam... Aha! I see! Now I know who it was!)

The person I saw was you. Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI always thought it was a bit odd. Why would the kidnappers abduct me, even after I had handed over the ransom?\nLance:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's not as though I saw the face of the kidnappers. If I were them, I would have just taken the million dollars and ran. But, in the end, there was a point to it all; it was to make me look like Mr. Deacon. And if that was the reason for which I was abducted... ...then, I believe we can assume that the victim was already dead at that time. Well, Lance? Am I right?\nLance:\nNngh... Th-That's...\nEdgeworth:\nYou showed Ms. Paups a person, namely me, with a Bad Badger's head on. And then, made your costumed escape together... Or so you pretended.\nPaups:\nHuh!? What do you mean he \"pretended\"!?\nEdgeworth:\nExactly that. I believe Lance watched you escape, and then doubled back to the hideout. Probably to come and remove the Bad Badger head from my unconscious self...\nLance:\nUnnnnngh..................\nEdgeworth:\nAnd to create his fake \"prison\" with the prop sword. He then escaped via the passageway.\nLang:\nLang:\nHold your tongue, boy! Don't get caught up in that tidal wave of words coming out of Mr. Prosecutor's mouth.\nEdgeworth:\nTidal wave?\nLang:\nWe've heard a lot come out of you, but I've yet to see a shred of evidence. The victim's betrayal, and his subsequent detainment... All of that could've happened while you were out cold.\nLance:\nTh-That's right! You were out for quite a while, Mr. Prosecutor.\nEdgeworth:\nEven if that were the case. Ms. Paups would have still seen me tied to that beam.\nPaups:\nI... I was scared of Mr. Deacon, so I didn't go into the next room. So I really have no idea if you were in there or not, Mr. Edgeworth...\nLang:\nYou see. It would seem that you can't prove a thing.\nEdgeworth:\nGnngh!\n???:\nLang:\nWh-Who said that!?\nErnest:\nPlease, wait.\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Amano!\nErnest:\nHo ho ho. Miles, my boy. It looks like you're really giving it your all. And Lance... It's not good to cause trouble for others.\nLance:\nD-Dad!\nErnest:\nLet's see... You are the one in charge of the investigation, correct?\nLang:\nYeah, that's right.\nErnest:\nI'm sorry that my son has been nothing but trouble. This probably won't make up for anything, but I have some evidence for you.\nLang:\nOh? Do you, now?\nEdgeworth:\nIs that what I think it is!?\nKay:\nIt's the Bad Badger costume the victim was wearing! And a gun!\nErnest:\nI couldn't wait around for the police, so I went and found these myself. It appears that they were disposed of in the sea.\nLang:\nArgh! Is there no one in this country who actually obeys the law!?\nErnest:\nThere, there, now. Agent Lang, please calm down.\nLang:\nHm? What the heck is that scrap of paper?\nShih-na:\n.........This appears to be a letter from the Chief of Police. \"Please allow Mr. Amano complete freedom to do as he sees fit,\" it says.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nLang:\nTh-The Chief of Poliiiiiice!? What the......... Just who does he think he is!?\nShih-na:\nThe person who wields the highest authority in this area...\nErnest:\nHo ho ho. There, there, now. There is no need to be so upset.\nLang:\nHeh. I'm not a cop from this land. So I'm not bound by the laws of your country.\nErnest:\nNow, now, now. This wasn't meant to strong-arm you into anything. It's just a request. I'm only asking that you please respect the laws of the land.\nLang:\nArgh. I can't really say no to that. However, returning to the topic at hand... ...it doesn't matter who found the evidence. Its value remains unchanged. Alright now, let's take a look at this new evidence.\nErnest:\nI've already got the results back. I had a special forensics research lab that I'm on good terms with conduct the tests. They verified that the blood on this costume belonged to Oliver. As for the gun... ..the only fingerprints they could find were yours, Lauren!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What!?\nErnest:\nYou disappoint me, Miles. I can't believe that you... that you would... cause my son such stress and heartache! Thank goodness I was able to find the final pieces of evidence. With this, you'll have no reason left to push my poor boy around!\nEdgeworth:\n(That's it? These are the case-making pieces of evidence? Hah! I'll be the judge of that! I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\nExamine inside of costume head\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? What's this? It looks like there's something inside the costume head...)\nKay:\nHey! They sparkle! I bet they're really valuable!\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, but they're just pieces of a mirror...

Those burn marks were left by the gunpowder... This is a most important fact.\nKay:\nWhy is that?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause it is proof that the victim was shot at point blank range.\nVictim's Costume data updated in my Organizer.\nExamine bullet hole (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis bullet hole...\nKay:\nIt looks kind of burnt around the edges.\nEdgeworth:\nWait!

Besides, Ms. Paups's prints are on it.\nKay:\nLook! I'm wearing gloves! It'll be OK! I just want to take a look, that's all! It's not like I'm going to run off with it. The only things I don't return are treasures!\nEdgeworth:\nStealing either one would land you in jail, you know...\nAfter examining inside of costume head, bullet hole, and gun on right:\nErnest:\nWell? Are these not the most definitive pieces of evidence you've ever seen?\nLance:\nThank you, Dad. This should be enough to convince even Mr. Edgeworth over there.\nTestimony\n-- Decisive Evidence --\nLance:\nMake no mistake. There are fingerprints on that murderous gun.\nAnd they prove that it was Lolli who killed Oliver.\nBut Oliver was also after Lolli's life.\nSo Mr. Edgeworth, even you must see that Lolli was only acting in self-defense.\nEdgeworth:\nThe fingerprints on the weapon, huh...\nKay:\nOh, no! This isn't helpful at all!\nLance:\nLook, Mr. Edgeworth... All I want to do is save Lolli. But in the end, all I can do is watch on as she takes the punishment for her crimes.\nEdgeworth:\nThat may be all you can do, however... ...I still have a case to solve and a job to do. The job of unraveling your insidious lie!\nLance:\n...You wound me. Why won't you believe me, even in the face of all this evidence?\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Those fingerprints... Are you sure they belong to Ms. Paups? Ernest: There's no mistake about it. Through my connections, I had the best forensics techniques money can buy performed. Edgeworth: I find that to be a bit peculiar. Ernest: What? Are you trying to pick an argument with me!? Edgeworth: (What should I do? Should I raise an objection?)

Leads back to rebuttal\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You sure are calm for someone who is accusing his own girlfriend of murder. Lance: You have it all wrong! Allowing her to pay the price is a form of love. She says that she also wants to pay back her debt to society, but...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: And why do you believe that the victim was set on taking Ms. Paups's life? Lance: I suppose it's because he wanted to silence her. To keep her quiet, because she knows the truth behind the kidnapping. Edgeworth: In that case, why did he not target you as well? Lance: ...Th-That's because... ...because he knew that if he killed me, he wouldn't be able to control my father. Ernest: Ho ho ho. Right you are. Even if it cost me millions, I would have had the killer found. Edgeworth: I believe he didn't kill you for an entirely different reason, however, I digress... Lance: L-Look, more than why he didn't kill me, I'm worried about what'll happen to Lolli!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Justified self-defense? I suppose that is a possibility, given the circumstances. Lance: Really!? Oh, thank goodness...! Edgeworth: However, self-defense was not necessary in this case. Lance: Wh-What do you mean!? Edgeworth: Ms. Paups is innocent. She didn't do anything, so why would she need to defend herself from nothing? Lance: You still don't believe a word I say, do you...!?\nEdgeworth: (His entire argument hinges on the fact that her fingerprints are on the gun. However, the truth does not lie there. It lies in whatever he is hiding from me, but not for long!)",

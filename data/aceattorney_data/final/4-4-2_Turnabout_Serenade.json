  "previousContext": "Episode 3Turnabout Serenade\nLet's rock!!!\nKlavier:\nWe love you! Rock on, everyone! This party's not over yet! Get out your handkerchiefs for our special guest! That's right, baby! The night's just getting started!\nThank you for coming to the Gavinners: \"Guilty as Charged\" Tour! This ends the first part of tonight's show. There will now be a 20-minute intermission.\nJuly 7, 8:05 PMBackstage Hallway\nTrucy:\nThis is so cool! Us, at a Gavinners concert!\nApollo:\nHuh? Did you say something? My ears are still ringing... The Gavinners: putting the \"sick\" back in \"music\".\nTrucy:\nWell, I thought Mr. Gavin was really nice! Sending us those tickets at 20% off! They're hard to get ahold of, you know.\nApollo:\nWhen you invite people to a concert it's usually free.\nTrucy:\nLet's head to his dressing room, Apollo! You know, like we're a couple of VIPs. I've always dreamed of being a VIP at a Gavinners show!\nApollo:\nUm, Trucy... You didn't know who Prosecutor Gavin was before that case. What kind of fan doesn't know the lead vocalist's name?\nTrucy:\nOh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in...\nTrucy:\nKlavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy!\nTrucy:\nYeah, but I'm a girl! I'm supposed to swoon over gods of rock!\nApollo:\nGod-awful, maybe.\nTrucy:\nI bought all their stuff on the way home from the trial! I got twelve Gavinners albums, and fifteen concert videos!\nApollo:\n...That was quite a bit of impulse shopping.\nTrucy:\nI got an advance on my next 15-years-worth of allowance.\nApollo:\n...For Mr. Wright that sounds like a real act of generosity.\nApollo:\n(Who would have imagined me here... ...at a Gavinners concert, watching Prosecutor Gavin \"rock\". To be honest... ...he was kind of cool. And I'm kind of envious. Not that I'd ever admit that to Trucy.)\nJuly 7Gavinners's Dressing Room\nKlavier:\nAh, you made it.\nTrucy:\nMr. Gavin! Thanks so much for the tickets!\nApollo:\n...And the invoice you sent along with them.\nTrucy:\nYou were incredible up on stage, Mr. Gavin!\nKlavier:\nNothing like music to brighten the mood after a trial, ja? ...And we're almost ready for our next act. I'm looking forward to it myself.\nTrucy:\nLamiroir's singing, right!? The \"Siren of the Ballad\"?\nApollo:\nOh yeah... That flyer said she flew all the way over for this show.\nKlavier:\nThat's right. I happened to catch her show while overseas. Her voice... is divine. I knew I had to invite her to perform with us.\n???:\nLamiroir says... \"You praise me too highly.\"\nApollo:\n(Whoa! Who's this guy? He's huge!)\nKlavier:\nAh, allow me to introduce Mr. Romein LeTouse. ...Lamiroir's manager. And her interpreter, incidentally.\nLeTouse:\nIt is a great honor for us to be here. And a great honor for Lamiroir to be heard in this country.\n???:\n[Foreign text]....\nApollo:\n(That voice... I wish I could understand it... It's beautiful.)\n???:\n[Foreign text]... [Foreign text]...\nTrucy:\nOoooh! It's Lamiroir! I'm actually meeting Lamiroir!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir... Mysterious songstress... Her quiet, deep song glides through the air... Lilting above a sparse, but elegant piano accompaniment. Now this is music. She's a real artist.)\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nLeTouse:\nLamiroir says... \"We have long looked forward to this joint performance.\"\nKlavier:\nAh, Lamiroir... Your voice... ...It is art.\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nLeTouse:\n\"Yet without his piano to guide me... ...it is but a voice.\"\n???:\n....................\nApollo:\n(I've seen this kid somewhere before.)\nTrucy:\nHe plays piano at all of Lamiroir's concerts! He's cute! And he's a really good pianist.\nApollo:\nGood pianists are a dying breed, I hear.\nLeTouse:\nAllow me to introduce Machi Tobaye. ...He is blind. This is why he never strays far from Lamiroir. They are always together.\nMachi:\n....................\nApollo:\n(They're like characters from some fairy tale..)\nTrucy:\nLamiroir's so, um, what's that word... Exotic! ...And mysterious!\nApollo:\nShe does seem quite pretty. At least, her eyes do.\nKlavier:\nHers is a kind of \"sight-seeing musique\"...\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nKlavier:\nShe travels the globe, putting the sights she sees into song. Even though her appearance and voice are exotic... ...her songs remind us of something close, and warm.\nTrucy:\nSights into song... That's so poetic!\nKlavier:\nShe was gracious enough to put music to my lyrics tonight. \"The Guitar's Serenade\". ...I hope you enjoy it.\nTrucy:\nI can't wait!\nKlavier:\n...And now it is time. For the next part, we're giving the Gavinners's hard rock a little rest. Lamiroir, the stage is yours.\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nLeTouse:\nThe band members will not play during Lamiroir's ballad. Only Machi's tender tones, and Lamiroir's dulcet voice...\nKlavier:\n...And my guitar, of course.\nTrucy:\nWoo hoo! Nights like this make it all worthwhile, you know!\nApollo:\n(I should have learned to play the guitar. There's not much romance in Chords of Steel.)\nKlavier:\nShall we hit the stage, then?\nTrucy:\nGood luck, Mr. Gavin!\nKlavier:\nTake care your hearts aren't stolen away, ja?\nTrucy:\nLet's get back to the concert hall, Polly!\nSugar, Sugar...\nO that night, in your embrace.\nWhen you stole away the keys\nmy heart held on to so tight.\nPleasure...\nBut a fleeting melody\nIt wraps itself around me,\nAnd now through the air I fly.\nWoh... Woh...\nBurning on in my heart. Fire.\nBurn my love away. All away.\nLike a bullet of love. Fire.\nTake my life away. All away.\nGuitar, Guitar...\n\nUp together to the sky.\nJuly 7, 9:05 PMBackstage Hallway\nTrucy:\nWow, wasn't Lamiroir amazing? I *sniffle* I even cried a little!\nApollo:\nI was surprised Prosecutor Gavin actually burned his guitar.\nTrucy:\nYeah! That even surprised me, and I'm a magician! What a production!\nApollo:\nWhat a destruction. (I don't think Prosecutor Gavin was expecting it either, oddly. He looked as surprised as I was.)\nTrucy:\nIs that what they call \"risking life and limb for art\"? I think he's my new hero!\nApollo:\nI'm not sure I'd call that \"art\".\nTrucy:\nWell, what are we doing here? Let's get going to Mr. Gavin's dressing room! There's twenty minutes till the last part of the show!\nApollo:\nHow many breaks does this band need?\nJuly 7Gavinners's Dressing Room\nKlavier:\nWhat the heck was that!? I was never consulted about it!\nStaff:\nS-Sorry, Mr. Gavin, sir! I've asked the man in charge...\nKlavier:\nI play new rock, not Great Balls of Fire! Speaking of fire, I have a good mind to fire whoever's responsible!\nTrucy:\n...He seems upset.\nKlavier:\nApollo Justice! Were you the one who tried to torch me!?\nApollo:\nHey, I didn't do it!\nTrucy:\nSo much for risking your life for art...\nKlavier:\n\"The Guitar's Serenade\" is ruined! Ruined!\nTrucy:\nWell, let's try to talk to him at least.\nApollo:\n...I'm not sure that's the best move right now.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nKlavier:\nAlmost time for the third act of the night.\nTrucy:\nOh! There's more?\nKlavier:\nYes! Lamiroir's part is done. Now it's time for us to drop our groove again, ja? Hope you're ready to catch it.\nTrucy:\nWoo hoo! Ready, Apollo?\nApollo:\nUh... I think I'll pass.\nTrucy:\nEh.\nApollo:\nI liked the bit with Lamiroir. But the rest could use a volume knob. Turned way down.\nTrucy:\nAh, Apollo, you're getting old!\nApollo:\nAck! (Does 22 quality as \"old\" to a 15-year-old...?)\nTrucy:\nWell, I'm going!\nKlavier:\nLet the old folks rest backstage, ja? ...Time to rock.\nApollo:\n(Hey, you're older than I am!)\nJuly 7Backstage Hallway\nEma:\nHey, it's you! That Wright kid.\nApollo:\nDetective Skye! (I'll let that \"Wright kid\" business pass.)\nEma:\nCall me Ema. There's no need for titles once you've shared a bottle of fingerprinting powder!\nApollo:\nThat's a new one. So, um, Ema, what are you doing here?\nEma:\n...Isn't it obvious? I'm snacking. You think I want to be here!? Me, in charge of security in this pit!?\nApollo:\nSecurity...? Did something happen?\nEma:\nThere's no knowing with that glimmerous fop. Apparently, he's all upset because something was stolen. He wanted security back here during the concert. Where does he get off acting like he's some big rock star?\nApollo:\n(...He is a big rock star.)\nEma:\nHey! You listening to me?\nApollo:\nSo... Where's this door here lead to?\nEma:\nThis one? That's Lamiroir's dressing room. Don't even think of going in there unless you want a piece of Snackoos in your face!\nApollo:\n(Is she ever in a good mood, I wonder?)\nApollo:\nSo this is Lamiroir's dressing room.\nEma:\nIf you even think about going in there, I'll--\n...BANG...!\nApollo:\n......\nEma:\n......\nApollo:\nWhat was that?\n...BANG...!\nApollo:\nWas that... a gunshot?\n...CRASH...!\nApollo:\n(Something's going on!)\nEma:\nYou, out of my way!\nApollo:\nE-Ema!\nEma:\nLamiroir! Lamiroir!\n......\nEma:\nIt's not locked... I'm going in!\nJuly 7, 9:30 PMLamiroir's Dressing Room\nApollo:\n(What's that awful noise... Oh, it's the concert.) Aaack! That's-- (It's Lamiroir's manager! Mister what's-his-name...)\nEma:\nLeTouse! Oh no... Hey, you!\nApollo:\nM-Me?\nEma:\nWatch this room for me. I have to call for backup!\nApollo:\nR-Right, understood. You want me to make sure no one comes in, right?\nEma:\nAnd don't touch anything! I'll be right back!\nApollo:\n(...What's going on? I just talked to him, and now...)\nLeTouse:\n......Nnnh......\nApollo:\n...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?\nLeTouse:\n...Sh...Shot. ...I was...shot.\nApollo:\nWho? Who shot you!?\nLeTouse:\n...I don't know... Ask...\nApollo:\nAsk? Ask what?\nLeTouse:\nAsk... wi...witness...\nApollo:\nWitness... There was a witness!? Who!?\nLeTouse:\n...Cold... so cold... Witness...\nApollo:\nYou're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!\nLeTouse:\n...Can't s...see...\nApollo:\nHang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nApollo:\n(...\"Siren\"? How can a siren witness anything...?) Mr. LeTouse! Yipes! Ema!? (What was that!?) Wh-Who's there!?\nEma:\nWhat's wrong?\nApollo:\nEma! Did you see anyone just now!?\nEma:\nHuh? No...\nApollo:\n(I could have sworn I heard a door close...)\nEma:\nThe concert's been cancelled. Backup's on its way. Is Mr. LeTouse... ...He's dead, isn't he? That's terrible.\nApollo:\n...! (I lost him!)\nApollo:\n(Romein LeTouse... shot. And I heard his last words... \"The witness is the siren\"... Whatever that means.)\nJuly 7Backstage Hallway\n???:\nThe venue's locked down. We took names and addresses before letting the crowd go.\nKlavier:\nGood work, Daryan.\n???:\nI'll let you know if I find out anything about the victim. Later.\nKlavier:\nIt's investigation time, then, ja, Fräulein Detective?\nEma:\nI don't need some rock 'n' rolling prosecutor to tell me that.\nKlavier:\nOne request I must make... Tell no one, on staff or otherwise, anything of this.\nTrucy:\nOoh, a gag order!\nKlavier:\nNo word gets out, other than that Mr. LeTouse is dead. No word of the cause of death, or of the murder.\nApollo:\nTell no one... Not even Lamiroir?\nKlavier:\nNot even her. We must keep everything under wraps. Oh, one other thing. I'll need your signature on this, Herr Forehead. Yours too, Fräulein.\nApollo:\nOn that? Hmm... An \"Investigation Request\"...?\nTrucy:\nWhy just us?\nKlavier:\nYou two are civilians. It's standard procedure.\nApollo:\n(That should be OK to sign, I think...)\nSigned Prosecutor Gavin's Investigation Request.\nKlavier:\nRight, well, get started with the investigation!\nEma:\nI'm on it already!\nKlavier:\nAh, and one tip for you.\nApollo:\nHuh? Me?\nKlavier:\nTry not to get in the Fräulein detective's way. ...She's in a foul mood today.\nApollo:\n(Gee, I wonder why...)\nApollo:\n(We were all questioned as witnesses... ...And now none of us can go home. We'll investigate alright. ...Our way!)\nTrucy:\n...Somehow I don't see us getting back to that crime scene any time soon.\nApollo:\nI still can't believe I was there when it happened. Not an experience I care to repeat any time soon.\nTrucy:\nThis is no time for navel-gazing! Let's crack this case!\nApollo:\n(I worry about Trucy. She seems to have a very loose idea of what it means to be an \"attorney\". Of course, that's not surprising considering who her father is...)\nTrucy:\nSomething the matter?\nApollo:\nNo... Let's get cracking!\nApollo:\n(I'm the only one who was there... The only one who heard Mr. LeTouse's last words.)\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nApollo:\n(First order of business is to find out what he meant by \"siren\"!)\nJuly 7Gavinners's Dressing Room\nTrucy:\nHuh. Looks like nobody's here.\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin's probably busy with the case, too. No rest for the wicked.\nTrucy:\nNo rest for us, either, Apollo! Let's get rocking! Rock, rock!\nJuly 7In the Wings\nTrucy:\nHmm. The stage looks empty.\nApollo:\nI was hoping to get a chance to talk to Prosecutor Gavin...\nTrucy:\nOh well. Nothing to do but go to the crime scene, I guess!\nApollo:\nI guess...\nJuly 7Lamiroir's Dressing Room\nEma:\nOh, it's you. I figured you'd come.\nApollo:\nYou have to let us investigate the scene, please!\nEma:\nYou're attorneys, no? Shouldn't you wait until you have a client...?\nApollo:\n(LeTouse did tell me to ask the witness, the siren... ...With his dying breath, no less. Doesn't that count?)\nEma:\n...G-Glare at me all you want, you'll get no snacks from me.\nTrucy:\nPlease! Think of poor Lamiroir!\nEma:\nHmph. Oh well, I suppose. You did find the body with me.\nApollo:\nGreat! Let's get to it!\nTrucy:\nRight!\nEma:\nJust try not to touch anything!\nApollo:\n(She's letting us look! And she's not munching her snacks! This bodes well. There are clues here, I can feel it! Leave no hanger unhung, no spot unspotted!)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining brooch and Romein LeTouse's left hand:\nEma:\nWell, that's about it. I think we've looked at just about everything there is.\nApollo:\nI guess you're right.\nEma:\nI know how you're feeling. It is hard to know when to stop. But anything more involved has to wait until the squad gets here.\nTrucy:\nArgh... I suppose...\nEma:\nI'll go report the evidence. Sorry, but could you wait here till I get back?\nApollo:\nHuh? Oh, actually, we have to--\nEma:\nGreat! Thanks!\nApollo:\n...She left.\nTrucy:\nWhat do we do, Apollo? She told us to wait...\nApollo:\nGreat. Now how am I supposed to investigate?\nTrucy:\nOh well, I guess it can't be helped. Let's go.\nApollo:\nHuh? Go?\nTrucy:\nTime's a wasting, Apollo! We've got a lot of ground to cover!\nApollo:\nWell, that's true, but... ...On second thought, why not. I'm sure everything will be fine.\nTrucy:\nOf course it will! Let's go!\nJuly 7Backstage Hallway\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\nWho's there!?\nTrucy:\nWe... didn't just imagine that, did we?\nApollo:\nHe was wearing a silk hat. ...Friend of yours?\nTrucy:\nHardly!\nApollo:\n(Whoever that was, he sure looked suspicious!)\nJuly 7In the Wings\nKlavier:\nWhat is it with today!? Problem after problem! Achtung!\n???:\nYou ain't kidding.\nTrucy:\nIt's the two leading members of the Gavinners, Apollo! Klavier on vocals, and Daryan on guitar! They're so cool!\nApollo:\nI have a hard time thinking of \"Klavier\" as anything but a prosecutor, honestly.\nTrucy:\nHuh? What are they arguing about?\nApollo:\nProbably the case, I'd bet.\nKlavier:\nMy hog won't start. My guitar case is busted... ...my guitar's been burnt to a crisp, and to top it all off, someone's dead! ...And then there was that performance just now. What was that all about!?\nDaryan:\nHey, man, don't blame me. You were the one who missed the cue.\nKlavier:\nMe? Miss a cue!? How could I conceivably get the most important part of that song wrong? How!? And what was all that tinny playing of yours?\nDaryan:\nWho you calling \"tinny\"!?\nTrucy:\n...Sounds like they're having a spat. One of those \"differences in musical direction\" bands are always splitting up over.\nApollo:\nThis is hardly the time...\nKlavier:\n...Hmm? What are you two doing here?\nApollo:\nAh, um, hiya. ......\nKlavier:\nWe were just discussing the investigation, if you don't mind.\nApollo:\nSorry. Wait... You were what?\nKlavier:\nListen... You need to confirm that with the Republic of Borginia, Detective Crescend.\nDaryan:\nRight. Anything else?\nApollo:\nWhat did he just call him? \"Detective\"...?\nDaryan:\nAh, greetings. Daryan Crescend... Criminal Affairs, Division 3.\nApollo:\nUh... H-Hello. (\"Criminal Affairs\"!?)\nTrucy:\n*sigh* Apollo... You really don't know anything about the Gavinners, do you?\nApollo:\n(Something tells me that's about to be remedied.)\nAfter clearing \"The missed cue\" and \"The song's prediction\" Talk options:\nDaryan:\nThe lyrics predicting the crime... Klavier?\nKlavier:\nSeems a bit more than just a coincidence to me.\nDaryan:\nI have to agree. The key ring, the guitar, and the murder...\nApollo:\nThe key ring might have been dropped by accident.\nKlavier:\nYet the victim was holding it. Hard to think that it was unconnected.\nApollo:\nThat's true. (Prosecutor Gavin's as calm and collected as ever...)\nTrucy:\nSo the criminal matched their actions to the lyrics?\nDaryan:\nThat sounds likely.\nApollo:\nWhy would anyone do that?\nDaryan:\n...While we think about that, I'm going to get cracking on the biggest crime here. I'm going to talk to the Borginian Embassy about this Mr. LeTouse.\nKlavier:\nAh, right. Thanks, Daryan.\nDaryan:\nI'll leave the pondering of mysteries to you. I'm outta here.\nKlavier:\nA foreign national, Mr. LeTouse was killed... It seems like that would have to be the \"point\" of all this. But they did more than that. They left us with not only a murder, but a mystery!\nTrucy:\nMr. Gavin sure is irritable today.\nApollo:\nMaybe this is the real Prosecutor Gavin we don't get to see in the courtroom.\nKlavier:\n...I've had enough, frankly. If you find any more mysteries, do me a favor and keep them to yourselves, ja?\nApollo:\nJa... (I guess this is all we're going to get from Prosecutor Gavin. That leaves Lamiroir to question.) Prosecutor Gavin... do you know where Lamiroir is now?\nKlavier:\nAh, I had her go to my dressing room. With that pianist, Machi Tobaye, of course. She seemed rather shocked by Mr. LeTouse's sudden passing.\nApollo:\n(The Gavinners's dressing room. Got it!)\nJuly 7Backstage Hallway\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\nWho's there!? ...There he goes again. Who is that guy!?\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\nHuh? Trucy?\nTrucy:\nYou know, he did look sort of familiar...\nApollo:\n...So he is a friend of yours!\nTrucy:\nNo, that's not it. ...Sorry, I don't remember.\nApollo:\n(Curiouser and curiouser...)\nJuly 7Gavinners's Dressing Room\nTrucy:\nAh... Lamiroir!\nLamiroir:\nWhat... What has happened? I heard that Mr. LeTouse has died!\nApollo:\nL-Lamiroir! You speak? I mean, you speak English?\nLamiroir:\nAh... Yes. I was invited here from the Republic of Borginia... But I am not Borginian by birth.\nTrucy:\nBut wasn't Mr. LeTouse your interpreter...?\nLamiroir:\nAh that. Yes, well... It was Mr. LeTouse's idea. He thought it would add to the mystery, you see.\nApollo:\nThen, your pianist is also...?\nMachi:\n....................\nLamiroir:\nNo, Machi Tobaye is Borginian. He does not speak English. Now, please tell me! What has happened to Mr. LeTouse? Why did he...\nTrucy:\nActually, Mr. LeTouse was...\nApollo:\nTrucy!\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nApollo:\nRemember what Prosecutor Gavin said? \"Not a word\"!\nTrucy:\nB-But Mr. LeTouse is Lamiroir's manager! That's not fair to her! I mean, isn't she a related party?\nApollo:\n(Precisely who Prosecutor Gavin doesn't want to alert, I'd suspect.)\nLamiroir:\nAll we have been told is to wait here in this room. It is very unsettling.\nApollo:\nI'm sorry, we're trying to figure it out ourselves. Do... you think I could ask you some questions?\nLamiroir:\nOf course. I am always willing to help.\nApollo:\n(She's as calm as she looked on stage... I can't put my finger on why, but I like this Lamiroir.)\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\nWhat is it, Machi?\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\nWhat... but you'd be alone!\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nApollo:\nUm, what seems to be the problem?\nLamiroir:\nMachi... he is not good around strangers. He wishes to go out for a breath of fresh air. Would that be alright?\nApollo:\nUh, sure, of course.\nMachi:\n....................\nLamiroir:\nVery well. What is it you wished to ask me about?\nAfter clearing \"Lamiroir\" and \"Mr. LeTouse\" Talk options:\nApollo:\nThe \"siren\"... That's what he meant!\nTrucy:\nHuh? Apollo?\nApollo:\nYou are \"the Siren\", right Lamiroir?\nLamiroir:\nThat is the meaning of my name in Borginian, yes. (Changed from [That is the meaning of my name in Borginese, yes.] in the original release) It was the name my producer gave me. But why do you ask?\nApollo:\n...It's very important. I had to know for sure if the \"Siren\" was you.\nLamiroir:\nWhat do you mean, important?\nApollo:\n...I'll tell you. You deserve to know.\nAfter examining postcards, clearing \"The \"Siren\"\" Talk option, and presenting Brooch in Gavinners's Dressing Room:\nJuly 8, 12:22 AMBackstage Hallway\nApollo:\nWhoa! Who's there now!?\nEma:\nAh, it's you. ...Where were you!?\nApollo:\nAck! Ema! ...Is something wrong? (She's looks grumpier than usual.)\nEma:\nYou bet something's wrong! The impossible's happened! Arrgh! It's all your fault, you know!\nApollo:\n(Oops. Maybe this is about us leaving the crime scene.)\nTrucy:\nWhat do you mean by \"impossible\"?\nEma:\nWell it's gone! Utterly gone!\nTrucy:\n...What's gone?\nEma:\nThe body, stupid! What else?\nTrucy:\nEh...\nEma:\nMr. LeTouse's body has disappeared!\nTrucy:\nWhaaaaaaaaaat!?\nJuly 8Lamiroir's Dressing Room\nApollo:\nAh... Prosecutor Gavin.\nKlavier:\nFrom your vacant stare, I gather you've heard the news.\nApollo:\nI heard Mr. LeTouse's body has gone missing...\nKlavier:\nLook for yourself. Quite the pickle. Quite. The. Pickle.\nEma:\nHow can you just stand there!? We have to start the investi...\nKlavier:\nThere's no need for alarm, Fräulein Detective.\nEma:\n...!\nKlavier:\nAll entrances and exits have been sealed. The body will not leave the building. So, I suggest we go find ourselves a cadaver. There will be plenty of time to ponder the \"whys\" later.\nTrucy:\nWell, you seem pretty sure of yourself, Mr. Gavin.\nKlavier:\nOh, we'll find him. I'm rather enjoying this.\nApollo:\n(How could Mr. LeTouse's body just \"disappear\"?)\nTrucy:\nWell, you heard the man. Let's get searching!\nDaryan:\n...Hey, I don't know if this's exactly the right time, but...\nKlavier:\nYes, Daryan?\nDaryan:\nSee, Geeter's gone missing. It was in the dressing room.\nTrucy:\nGeeter? Who's Geeter!?\nDaryan:\nThat's what I call my guitar! You like, man?\nKlavier:\nYour guitar... was stolen?\nEma:\nThis hasn't been a good day for guitars or geeters.\nKlavier:\nOK. Body first, then guitar. And if someone finds that guitar, please bring it to our dressing room.\nDaryan:\nGeeter's like a missing person, not lost 'n' found, man.\nJuly 8, 12:57 AMIn the Wings\nTrucy:\nHmm. Does something seem different to you, Apollo?\nApollo:\nSomething is definitely different here.\nTrucy:\nLet's check it out!\nTrucy:\nThat stage there must have been lowered before.\nApollo:\nThat's the tower that Lamiroir and Prosecutor Gavin were singing on.\nTrucy:\nSomeone must have raised it. Hmm. I don't see a way to control it from here. Apollo, what about that ladder there against the wall? We could use that to take a look up top...\nApollo:\n...... Maybe we should get Ema.\nTrucy:\nWhat are you talking about? We have to see this sort of thing for ourselves!\nApollo:\n(I'm... not so good with heights.)\nTrucy:\nStop whining and start climbing!\nApollo:\nUrk...\nApollo:\n(It didn't look that high from below, really. But when we got to the top, I felt every one of those fifteen feet down. (Changed from [But when we got to the top, I felt every one of those 20 feet down.] in the original release) Of course, I wasn't thinking about the height any more. Not after what we found up there.)\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\n(We found two things we were looking for, and one thing we never expected to find.) ...The body, guitar in hand, and the pianist, Machi Tobaye.\nJuly 8, 10:09 AMWright Anything Agency\nApollo:\nWow, that concert last night sure went south in a hurry!\nTrucy:\nNo kidding. Why did they arrest Machi!? Why!?\nApollo:\nDon't look at me like it's my fault! (Machi Tobaye, the blind pianist... ...arrested on suspicion of murdering Romein LeTouse.)\nTrucy:\nI can't believe such a cute little boy could do something so horrible!\nApollo:\nI guess they had proof of some kind.\nTrucy:\nWhat proof could possibly prove that!?\nKlavier:\nMornin'.\nApollo:\nP-Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nWhat a night, eh? I apologize for being so upset...\nTrucy:\nMr. Gavin, do you know what's going on? Why did they arrest Machi!? Why!?\nApollo:\nDon't look at him like it's his fault either.\nKlavier:\nIt was tough for me, too. We performed together that night, after all. Yet...\nTrucy:\nYet?\nKlavier:\nThe powers that be say that, given the circumstances, it could only have been him.\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean by the \"circumstances\"?\nKlavier:\nLamiroir was invited from Borginia as an ambassador of goodwill. It is vital that this case be wrapped up swiftly. That's all the powers that be want, really.\nApollo:\nWell those are circumstances, alright. But what makes Machi the only possible suspect?\nKlavier:\nHerr Forehead... You seem to have forgotten that you're talking to the prosecution... the enemy.\nApollo:\nAh. Right. (I think I like this side of Prosecutor Gavin better, actually.)\nKlavier:\nI'm not at liberty to discuss the particulars of the case. ...Especially not to the defense attorney.\nApollo:\nWhat... did you just say? Me? The defense attorney?\nKlavier:\nThat's what I came to tell you. He's down at the detention center... He wants to request your services.\nApollo:\nHe...? You mean Machi? Machi wants me...?\nTrucy:\nThis is what we've been waiting for, Apollo! Let's get going!\nApollo:\nUh... Right...!\nKlavier:\nGood luck. I'm off to question Lamiroir.\nApollo:\nR-Right. Later! (I hope I'm up to this...)\nJuly 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nTrucy:\nWell, I just don't get it. I refuse to believe a cute little kid like that could do something so terrible.\nApollo:\n...You said that already.\nMachi:\n...........................\nTrucy:\nMachi! Everything's going to be OK! We're here for you!\nApollo:\nUm, h-hi. Maybe you can tell me about last night...\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nMachi:\n[Foreign text].... [Foreign text]!\nApollo:\n(That was when I realized how tough it must be... A little kid like this... ...in a country so far from everything he's ever known.)\nTrucy:\nUm, maybe Lamiroir can help?\nApollo:\nBut didn't Prosecutor Gavin say she was with him?\nKlavier:\nGood luck. I'm off to question Lamiroir.\nTrucy:\nWell, what are we going to do?\nApollo:\nThat's, um, a good question. (I can't think of anything we can do but go with this. ...And hope for the best at the trial tomorrow.)\nMachi:\n[Foreign text].... [Foreign text]....\nTo be continued.",

The Pixie of the Arpeggio.Judge:\nRight, his trial. Court is in session!Apollo:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Klavier:\nThe prosecution is A-OK, Herr Judge.Judge:\nHmm... Very well, Prosecutor Gavin.Klavier:\nAh, my opening statement, ja?Judge:\nNo, no, actually... There was something else I wanted to ask you about.Klavier:\n...? Yes?Judge:\nSay you're going to visit someone in the hospital with an incurable disease... What do you say to them?Klavier:\nEh?Judge:\nI mean, you wouldn't say \"get well soon\", right? You'd only be kicking them when they're down...Apollo:\nUm, what are you talking about?Judge:\nAhem, actually I'm going to visit someone who is terminally ill. ...Right after this trial. The Chief Justice's son.Apollo:\nThe Chief Justice...?Judge:\nHis son is afflicted with a most terrible disease... He doesn't have long, it seems.Apollo:\nAh...Judge:\nSo I thought I'd go pay him a visit. I thought saying something moving might be the order of the day.Trucy:\nWhy don't grown-ups ever just say what's on their mind instead of pretending?Apollo:\n(She's looking at me with something like... disgust.) ...Hey! What are you looking at me like that for!?Judge:\nIn any case... I'm a bit busy today, so let's wrap this up quickly. Prosecutor Gavin, your opening statement, briefly!Klavier:\nYou're in luck, Herr Judge... I believe you'll be going on your hospital visit sooner than you think.Apollo:\n...!Klavier:\nFirst, to review the victim in this case. Romein LeTouse, age 35. The global manager for diva songstress, Lamiroir. The cause of death: blood loss due to being shot by a large caliber revolver. This report has all the details.Judge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.LeTouse's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:\n45-caliber... That's quite large, isn't it? A direct hit from that could knock a man off his feet.Klavier:\nHowever, the bullet struck him in his shoulder. The damage to his body was slight... death was not immediate. Sadly, his blood loss was such that he could not be saved.Judge:\nHmm... I suppose the victim's condition could have been much worse, considering.Crime Photo added to the Court Record.Klavier:\n...Two shots were fired. One shot missed, the other penetrated and passed through the victim's shoulder. Both bullets were found in the wall at the scene. Observe the diagram... ...This is where the bullets hit.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts this evidence.Diagram added to the Court Record.Judge:\nIf we're talking about a 45-caliber revolver... ...we must assume that the killer was adept at the weapon's use.Trucy:\nReally?Apollo:\nYeah, apparently, weapons that size have a powerful kickback. If, say, the judge tried to fire one, it'd break every bone in his body.Judge:\nThe defense will take more care in choosing examples!Klavier:\n...As I was saying, the victim was shot backstage, in a dressing room. This dressing room has only one entrance: this door.Judge:\nThat does seem to be the case, yes.Klavier:\nHowever, there were witnesses who heard the gunshots.Trucy:\nHe's talking about you and Ema, huh.Klavier:\nYet when the witnesses entered the room... ...it was empty, save for the victim's body, of course.Judge:\nB-But that's... That's impossible!Klavier:\nExactly. This murder was impossible. ...For all but one person.Judge:\nOne person?Klavier:\nThat is, of course... ...the defendant, Machi Tobaye.Judge:\nOnly this defendant could have committed the crime? But how?Klavier:\nIt's quite simple. The circumstances of the crime scene make it clear.Judge:\nVery well, I assume you have testimony to back up this claim. Please show the witness to the stand! (Changed from [Let the witness please take the stand!] in the original release)Klavier:\nYour name and profession, please.Ema:\nEma Skye, I'm a detective for the police department. I was on security detail at the concert forum that night.Apollo:\n(Ema seems... tired, somehow.)Judge:\nHmm... Security at the concert, you say?Ema:\nSome security I was. Couldn't even stop a murder... ......Judge:\nNow, don't blame yourself! Things like this happen! I've made even bigger mistakes in my career, you know!Apollo:\n(I'm sure that makes her feel much better.)Trucy:\nI want to hear about these bigger mistakes!Klavier:\nIn any case... Because you were on security detail, the crime was quickly discovered. And, we were able to identify the killer.Ema:\n......Klavier:\nYou may give the court your testimony, if you would. Describe the circumstances of that day, and your discovery of the crime, please.Ema:\n...Alright.Witness Testimony-- Murderous Circumstances --Ema:\nThe night of the murder, I was on security backstage, at Prosecutor Gavin's request.\nOnly people involved with the concert in some way were allowed backstage.\nAt the beginning of the third set... I heard shots.\nI went into the room, filled with blaring rock music, and found the body.\nI examined the scene and determined that only the defendant could have done it.Judge:\nHmm... It was lucky that a detective was the first on the scene.Trucy:\nBut that door was the only way out of the room, right?Apollo:\nYeah, pretty much.Trucy:\nThen I don't get it. How can they say that Machi did it?Apollo:\nLooks like we need a bit more information.Judge:\nVery well, the defense may begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination",

But, orders are orders. Even when they come from rock gods.\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin...?\nKlavier:\nYes, allow me to explain. I smelled something that day, you might say. The stench... of conspiracy. That day, at the concert hall.\nApollo:\nConspiracy...?\nKlavier:\nWell, isn't it obvious!? My keys! That whole morning, no, the whole day was ruined! And it's all because someone stole my keys! I couldn't ride my hog to the show, I couldn't open my guitar case...\nTrucy:\nThere he goes again.\nApollo:\nIsn't it possible he simply misplaced them?\nKlavier:\nMisplaced them!? Misplaced items don't just wander into a murder victim's hand on their own!\nJudge:\nWhat's this!? Prosecutor Gavin, if your keys were in the victim's hand... That makes you a prime suspect!\nKlavier:\n...\"Love, slow-acting and new. Atroquinine... is waiting for you...\"\nTrucy:\nHe's singing something.\nApollo:\nDoes everything with this guy have to be so over-the-top?\nKlavier:\n...The killing happened in the middle of my concert. I was... like a sailor, adrift on a sea of sound. Anyway, I didn't want anything else stolen. So I put the detective with the most time on their hands on the task.\nJudge:\nI see. I can accept that.\nEma:\nWell I can't! What do you mean \"time on their hands\"!?\nJudge:\nPlease, the testimony.Ema:\nOnly people involved with the concert in some way were allowed backstage.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n...We were let in, though.\nEma:\nI didn't know about that! I certainly didn't invite you.\nKlavier:\nI gave the Fräulein special permission to be there. ...I wanted to see her again.\nTrucy:\nOh boy! Did you hear that? We're officially involved now!\nApollo:\nGee, great.\nEma:\nSome other hangers-on tried to get backstage, but I drove them off.\nApollo:\n(So no other \"outsiders\" were there, then.)\nEma:\nAnd then...Ema:\nAt the beginning of the third set... I heard shots.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nI believe we were having a chat when we heard the shots.\nEma:\nYou were the one chatting. I was eating Snackoos.\nJudge:\nAh! Hey! No snacking in court!\nKlavier:\nAnd you're sure the shots came from Lamiroir's room?\nApollo:\nYes, absolutely.\nEma:\nHey, I'm the one being cross-examined here! Here, this'll keep you quiet!\n*ka-tonk*\nApollo:\nAh, thanks. So...MUNCH...how about it ...MUNCH...Ema?\nEma:\nWe were right...MUNCH...there. Hard to be mistaken about that...MUNCH.\nJudge:\nPlease, either talk, or eat. Not both at the same time!\nEma:\n...... *gulp* Right, so after that... ...me and Mr. Lawyer there opened the dressing room door.Ema:\nI went into the room, filled with blaring rock music, and found the body.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nRock?\nEma:\nBlaring, yes.\nJudge:\nWhen you say \"rock\", are you referring, perhaps... ...to this \"rock 'n' roll\" music that's so popular these days?\nApollo:\n(That's right, when we went into the dressing room... ...music was blaring over the speaker on the wall.)\nEma:\nThey pipe sound from the stage into the backstage through speakers. That way people in the back can hear when they're supposed to be on stage.\nApollo:\nDid it have to be so loud?\nKlavier:\nYou don't listen to the Gavinners with your ears. You feel it with your entire body and soul! I always have the backstage monitors at full volume.\nEma:\nWhen we walked in the room... ...the band was playing \"Guilty Love\", I believe. Making it easy to determine the time of the crime.\nJudge:\nHmm... If you could hear that music playing...\nKlavier:\n...Then everyone on stage for that song has an alibi. Including myself.\nEma:\nAnyway, I closed off the scene and started my investigation.Ema:\nI examined the scene and determined that only the defendant could have done it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nHow could you know something like that!?\nEma:\nAs I said, it was clear from the circumstances. Listen... We know there was only one exit from the room: that door. The small window only opened a tiny crack. And I was standing in front of that door. So, how could the killer have fled the scene? There's only one possibility: the air vent.\nJudge:\nAh...\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nB-But that air vent was too small! Who could possibly...\nEma:\nExactly.\nApollo:\n...!\nEma:\nThere's certainly no way you could get through. Nor me. The only one who could fit through... was a child.\nApollo:\nA child...\nEma:\nRemember, access to those rooms was limited. Only those involved with the concert were allowed.\nKlavier:\nAnd of all the people involved with the concert... ...only one is small enough to be considered a \"child\".\nJudge:\nThe... The defendant!?\nKlavier:\nThe pixie of the arpeggio flitted up toward the sky... ...and disappeared from the scene of the crime.\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nB-But that's just conjecture!\nKlavier:\nOh? There was no other way out of that room. You were there. You should know, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\n...!\nEma:\nAnd... there is another vital piece of evidence.\nApollo:\nEvidence...? What!?\nEma:\nMarks were found on the air vent grill. Traces that it had recently been opened.\nApollo:\nWait, what...!?\nEma:\nAnd something else was found, quite clearly. The defendant, Machi Tobaye's fingerprints.\nApollo:\nWha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!\nKlavier:\nThat air vent was the only way out of the room! The defendant's fingerprints were found on the grill! ...Well, Herr Forehead? What fairy tale does this suggest to you?\nApollo:\nUrk...!\nKlavier:\nOnly one could pass through that vent, that \"doorway to heaven\"... ...and that one is our pixie.\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\nWhy are you looking at me, Apollo? Hey! I was out whooping it up in the audience!\nApollo:\n(So this was his decisive evidence...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Quite decisive, indeed.Apollo:\n(I know the circumstances under which the body was found... I was there.)Trucy:\nAn examination of the crime scene was enough to nail down the killer?Apollo:\nI'm sure they have a good reason. (They must have had a good reason to arrest Machi... ...And I'm going to find out what it was!)After pressing first, fourth, and fifth statements:Judge:\nI believe that's enough of that.Apollo:\n!Judge:\nThe prosecution has a rather convincing case. The only way in and out of the crime scene was watched. Making the defendant the only one who could possibly leave the scene. Simple, and decisive.Apollo:\nUgh...Judge:\nI believe we've heard enough to determine our verdict. Even if I wasn't in a hurry to make a hospital visit.Klavier:\nI'm sure the Chief Justice will appreciate the gesture. Unfortunately, we have no direct witnesses. Fortunately, the criminal left decisive evidence for us. That will have to be enough.Apollo:\n(Argh! It can't be over already!)Judge:\nVery well, I believe this trial is finished. If the defense has no contradicting evidence...?Klavier:\nThe prosecution has presented our proof, clear and plain. If you have contradicting evidence... ...it'd better be clear and plain.Trucy:\nAck, Apollo! They've got us on the ropes already! We'd better come up with something quick!Apollo:\nI know! I know! (Think! What can get us out of this!? We need evidence, or a witness, that can prove Machi is innocent beyond a doubt. Without that... *gulp*)Judge:\nMr. Justice? Do you have contradicting proof that can overturn the prosecution's case? If you do, you'd better tell us about it now.Apollo:\n(This is it... and so soon! If I mess this one up, it's all over...!) The court wants contradicting proof?Present evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nThe defense is prepared to show contradicting evidence!\nKlavier:\nThis should be interesting! What sort of evidence?\nJudge:\nYes, what sort of evidence, Mr. Justice? Show us evidence contradicting the prosecution's claims!\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThis evidence does more than contradict, it flips the whole case on its head!\nJudge:\n......\nKlavier:\nThank you for presenting evidence that is both clear and plain, as requested.\nJudge:\nYes... Clearly and plainly wrong! I'm afraid the only thing flipped on its head here was you as a child, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\n(Ugh... I guess that wasn't it.)\nKlavier:\nMy claim is clear: the only person who could have fled the scene was the defendant.\nJudge:\nAnd there were no witnesses, either.\nKlavier:\nI fear the defense's options are limited, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\n(Grr! There's only one way out of this... Evidence, or a witness, that can prove Machi's innocence beyond a doubt.)\nJudge:\nLet's ask the defense once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have contradicting proof that can overturn the prosecution's case?\"Call a witness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Prosecutor Gavin, you claim that there were no witnesses to this crime.\"I don't have proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nI... don't have contradicting proof, actually.\nJudge:\nToo bad. Very well, this court finds the defendant...\n???:\n\nTrucy:\nW-Waaait!\nJudge:\nWh-What for?\nTrucy:\nWe have, uh, what was it called? Contradictual proof? Anyway, whatever it is, we've got it!\nJudge:\nIs this true?\nTrucy:\nOf course it's true! Show 'em, Apollo!\nApollo:\nWhat the heck are you talking about!?\nTrucy:\nLook, we give up now, Machi's really done for!\nApollo:\n(She's right... If we give up here, we're finished. I need proof or a witness... I must have something...!)\nJudge:\nAlright, we'll give you another chance, then.\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have contradicting proof that can overturn the prosecution's case?\"Apollo:\nProsecutor Gavin, you claim that there were no witnesses to this crime. Are you absolutely sure?Klavier:\nAbsolutely. I'd swear it on my career as a prosecutor... And on my million-seller hit song \"Atroquinine, My Love\".Trucy:\n...There he goes again.Apollo:\nThat's too bad, because there was a witness.Judge:\nHo ho! Really now? But how did you come to possess knowledge the prosecution clearly does not?Apollo:\nBecause I am the only one in the world who knows this.Apollo:\n(...What's going on? I just talked to him, and now...)LeTouse:\n......Nnnh......Apollo:\n...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?LeTouse:\n...Cold... so cold... Witness...Apollo:\nYou're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!LeTouse:\n...Can't s...see...Apollo:\nHang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?LeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...Judge:\nWhaaat!? The victim said this before he died!?Klavier:\nPerhaps he did... and perhaps he did not.Apollo:\nWhat do you mean by that?Klavier:\nAll we know is what Herr Forehead says he said. It's no testimony, especially since it comes from the defense attorney himself.Apollo:Apollo:\nBut it's the truth! He said it! I even told you about it! But apparently, you ignored me completely.Klavier:\nIt's my policy to fully investigate everything I deem relevant. Clearly this rookie lawyer thinks he can tell me how to do my job.Judge:\n...That's enough! Mr. Justice, we need clear contradictory proof from you. This witness of yours, unknown to the prosecution... ...I hope you're right. Failure carries a stiff penalty.Klavier:\nPerhaps... A stiffer penalty than usual is called for?Apollo:\n(Urk! There's no backing out now!)Judge:\nLet's hear the name of your witness, Mr. Justice.Present Lamiroir profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Lamiroir...?\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\nAnd you claim that they witnessed the murder?\nKlavier:\nThis is a bit unexpected. And you have proof?\nApollo:\nWell, actually... (Uh oh. I can't think of anything.)\nJudge:\nI know that look, Mr. Justice. It's the look of a man who's about to be penalized.\nKlavier:\nI doubted there was a witness in the first place. No one had time! They were far too busy rocking to our wild sounds!\nTrucy:\nMy heart was handcuffed to the stage, I know that!\nEma:\nI felt nothing.\nKlavier:\n...It's sad but true. Some people will never appreciate true art.\nApollo:\n(Why's he pointing at me!? Think, how can I get him to accept there was a witness? I need some kind of proof...)\nJudge:\nLet's start over, shall we?\nLeads back to:\n\"Let's hear the name of your witness, Mr. Justice.\"Judge:\nLamiroir...?Apollo:\nRecall Mr. LeTouse's last words.LeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...Judge:\nThe siren... Ah ha! He meant the \"Siren\"!Apollo:\nThat's right. The \"Siren of the Ballad\"... Lamiroir! Lamiroir was only on stage for the second set... ...and she had access to the backstage area. She could have been a witness!Judge:\nI see... Well, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\nMy claim still stands. There was no witness to this crime!Judge:\nVery well! Let's hear it from the horse's mouth then, shall we? We will now take a break from Detective Ema Skye's cross-examination. ...Please show Lamiroir to the witness stand.Apollo:\n(Lamiroir would say nothing the night of the murder... Not today, though. Today we'll drag that story out of her no matter what it is!)Klavier:\n......Klavier:\nIt is my distinct honor to welcome the Siren of the Ballad to our courtroom...Lamiroir:\nYou are too kind.Judge:\nAh, y-you can speak English?Lamiroir:\nYes... Yes I can. Though I am not very good. ...There is much I do not know.Judge:\nYou speak so well! Have you spent time here before?Lamiroir:\nActually, I do not know how I came by my knowledge of your language. Nor where I studied it...Apollo:\n...? (What does she mean, she doesn't know...?)Klavier:\nI, too, thought to call her as a witness. But I did not. I had a reason, of course.Apollo:\nWhat's that?Klavier:\nLamiroir... suffers from amnesia.Judge:\nAmnesia...?Lamiroir:\nLamiroir... is not my true name. Yet I remember nothing of the time before I was given it. ...Nothing of the time before I started singing on stage.Trucy:\nWhoa! She's even more mysterious than I thought!Klavier:\nAs lauded singer Lamiroir, she lives a good life. There are little difficulties for her, thanks to her success. Yet... I did not wish to subject her to unnecessary stress.Judge:\nHmm... I see. I care surprisingly little about people's pasts. You have nothing to fear in this court, Lamiroir.Lamiroir:\n...Thank you. Yet there is something I do not understand. I am being called as a witness? What might I say? No one will tell me anything of what happened...Klavier:\nLamiroir, let me be frank. I did not want to ask you up here to testify. Yet, that young gentleman with the wide forehead over there was adamant that you stand.Lamiroir:\nOh my...Trucy:\nCongratulations, Apollo. You're the bad guy!Apollo:\nUgh...Judge:\nWell, now that you're here, please give us your testimony. ...If nothing else, the sound of your voice is welcome. Tell us what you saw the night of the crime!Witness Testimony-- What I Saw --Lamiroir:\nAs for what I saw... I saw nothing.\nThat night, I was invited to sing on stage, and this I did.\nI did not return backstage after the second set.\nThen I was led by the police to Mr. Gavin's dressing room, and told to wait there.\nThat was where I learned that something had happened... But I wasn't told the details.Judge:\nHmm... I must say, you sound wonderful just testifying.Apollo:\n(I hope he was too distracted to hear what she was actually saying...)Klavier:\nThere you have it. She saw nothing that night. Now we can only pray that the defense has the sense to admit defeat. ...And refrain from detaining her here longer than need be.Trucy:\nWow, you just got badder, Apollo! Way to go!Apollo:\nGrr...Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Justice. Keep it short and sweet!Apollo:\n(Lamiroir wouldn't talk to me the night of the crime.

One on my gavel would be nice.\nKlavier:\nHerr Judge.\nJudge:\nWh-What's this?\nKlavier:\nIt's my autograph. Now keep this trial moving.\nJudge:\nWh-What!?\nJudge:\nOh, my grandchild will be so happy!\nApollo:\n(Apparently his grandson is a big fan...)\nKlavier:\nLet us continue, shall we? If you would, Lamiroir... ...Tell us what you did after your stellar performance.Lamiroir:\nI did not return backstage after the second set.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou did not return backstage once? Where were you then? What were you doing?\nLamiroir:\nI was cleaning up on stage. There are many things I must do for a performance other than simply sing.\nApollo:\nAnd was Machi with you at the time?\nLamiroir:\nUnfortunately, I do not know where he was...\nApollo:\n(So much for an alibi for Machi...)Present Brooch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nI'm sorry Lamiroir, but I'm having trouble believing you.\nLamiroir:\n......\nApollo:\nYou remember this brooch, do you not?\nKlavier:\nWhy that's Lamiroir's. She was wearing it for her song.\nApollo:\n...Care to add that to the testimony, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nWh-What...?\nApollo:\nThis brooch was found after the murder took place. ...At the very scene of the crime!\nKlavier:\nWhat...!?\nApollo:\n...Lamiroir. How did your brooch get backstage if you did not go there yourself? And, as Prosecutor Gavin has just told us... ...you had been wearing it during your performance that night!\nLamiroir:\n...!\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of this? Lamiroir, please explain!\nLamiroir:\n......\nApollo:\nLamiroir...?\nLamiroir:\n............

Just a glance, mind you.\nKlavier:\nSo this was when your brooch dropped? That explains that.\nLamiroir:\nIt does. There was no other time I could have dropped it.\nApollo:\nBut that's ridiculous! You only looked in for an instant, but you dropped your brooch?\nKlavier:\n...Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\n!\nKlavier:\nShe has raised a possibility. The only thing that can counter that... is evidence.\nJudge:\nHmm... So she looked in at the crime scene.\nLamiroir:\nActually, I intended to go into the dressing room. I knew nothing of what had happened, of course. But the moment I opened the door, I heard a horrible voice.\nKlavier:\nHerr Forehead shouting, \"Who's there!\" no doubt. A horrible voice indeed...\nApollo:\nUgh...\nLamiroir:\nI closed the door immediately.\nJudge:\nWell, that explains the brooch. Let's return to your testimony.\nApollo:\n(That's too convenient... She's hiding something!) Lamiroir! You did look into the room though, right?\nLamiroir:\nY-Yes...\nApollo:\nTestify as to what you saw!\nLamiroir:\nVery well. Though it was only the briefest of glimpses...\nChanges statement from \"I did not return backstage after the second set.\" to \"When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\"\nAdds statement \"I saw nothing.

Does that voice of yours lack a volume knob?\nApollo:\n(It's my Chords of Steel, man. Just back off!)Lamiroir:\nI saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nA wall...? Was there a wall there?\nLamiroir:\n\"[Foreign text]\" is what in English?\nKlavier:\nA \"division\" or \"partition\", I believe. It was a large dressing room, divided into two halves.\nApollo:\n(And the murder took place in the inside half. I guess that partition might have hidden the body...)Perceive swallowing on \"The late Mr. LeTouse's body\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n\"The late Mr. LeTouse's body\", you say?\nLamiroir:\nYes...?\nApollo:\nYou know something more about Mr. LeTouse's death than you are saying.\nLamiroir:\nWhat...?\nApollo:\nI could see you trying not to remember... But the effort made you swallow! ...You can't fool my eyes.\nLamiroir:\n! ...It is true. It was so terrible, after all. Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot?\nApollo:\nOne moment, Lamiroir.\nLamiroir:\nYes...?\nApollo:\nWhat was that you just said? \"Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot?\"\nLamiroir:\nYes...?\nApollo:\n(She was hiding something, I knew it!) Lamiroir, I'm afraid you haven't realized it, but... ...your words just now contradict your testimony!\nLamiroir:\nEh? How could that be!?\nApollo:\n(...Take this! Lamiroir contradicted her own testimony, and I have the evidence to prove it!)\n\n\n\nPresent Investigation Request\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Tell me, Lamiroir...\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLamiroir:\nIf I do not misunderstand the meaning of \"contradiction\"... ...it is you who contradict, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\nHuh?\nLamiroir:\nYour evidence... is meaningless.\nApollo:\n(Ack! Wrong evidence! Gotta think this over... What did she say again? \"Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot\"? That's right... That totally contradicts her testimony!)\nLeads back to:\n\"...Take this!\"\n\n\nApollo:\nTell me, Lamiroir... How did you know he had been shot?\nLamiroir:\nEh. Well, I...\nApollo:\nImmediately following the incident, a gag order was placed on the scene. This is the document proving that. In your testimony, you told the court... \"No one told me anything about the incident.\"\nLamiroir:\nAh...\nApollo:\nFurthermore, you testified that you had \"seen nothing\".\nLamiroir:\n...!\nApollo:\nYet you knew that Mr. LeTouse had been shot! How could you have known!?\nLamiroir:\n...! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooooowrk!\n\n\nJudge:\nLamiroir! You aren't hiding something from this court, I hope!\nLamiroir:\n......\nApollo:\n(That sweet song of hers was sounding a little too sweet!)\nLamiroir:\nAh, now I remember. Please... allow me to add to my testimony.\nKlavier:\n...Of course. All we want to know... is the truth.\nTrucy:\nShe looks kind of pale, huh?\nApollo:\nShe saw something, I know it. Even the victim said so!\nChanges statement from \"I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall.\" to \"I saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot...\"Lamiroir:\nI saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nOnly a glimpse, yet you knew they were bullet holes?\nLamiroir:\nYes. I recognized them immediately. I have seen bullet holes before, you know.\nKlavier:\nYou have traveled the world as a singer... You must have sung in places far more dangerous than our country.\nLamiroir:\nI go wherever my voice is needed. Those places... are many, these days.\nTrucy:\nThat's really cool! I hope I get to travel like Lamiroir some day.\nKlavier:\nI plan on recording my next album overseas. Their studios have a different sound, you know.\nApollo:\n(Hmm.

How was he then?\nLamiroir:\nHe seemed as he always does. Though I believe he was shocked by the news of Mr. LeTouse's death. Yet... He is not the type to show much emotion.\nKlavier:\nYes. He's given the police no end of headaches. He answers most questions with silence... and those glinting frames speak nothing. The questioning hasn't gotten very far.\nLamiroir:\nWe sat there, waiting...Lamiroir:\nThat was where I learned that something had happened... But I wasn't told the details.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nHow was the incident explained to you?\nLamiroir:\nI was told nothing in detail. Only that Mr. LeTouse died.\nJudge:\nOf course, investigations require some security.\nLamiroir:\nBut Mr. LeTouse was my manager! I wanted to know more. I should have been told. Both Machi and I were beside ourselves with concern.\nKlavier:\n...Allow me to apologize. But please understand... ...keeping you in the dark was as painful for me as it was for you.\nLamiroir:\nYes, I understand.Apollo:\n(Think, what doesn't ring true about her testimony?)Trucy:\n...It's hard to imagine Lamiroir lying...Apollo:\nShe might not be lying, but she's hiding something... (What wouldn't she tell me the night of the murder?)Apollo:\nLamiroir. They call you the Siren of the Ballad... ...but lies are hardly becoming of such a creature.Judge:\n...A put-down worthy of our prosecutor, Mr. Justice.Trucy:\n...Such put-downs are hardly becoming of you, Apollo.Klavier:\n...Stop polishing your forehead and start polishing your character, ja?Apollo:\n(C'mon, can't I be cool for once!?) Observe the diagram! Lamiroir, you looked in from the door for just a moment. Correct?Lamiroir:\nY-Yes, that is so.Apollo:\nThere were bullet holes in the room, yes. But they were in the wall the door is on!Lamiroir:\nEh...Apollo:\nYou see? Assuming you merely glanced into the room... ...you couldn't have seen those bullet holes!Lamiroir:\nYeeeeeeeeeeeeeooowrk!Judge:\n...... Lamiroir.Lamiroir:\n...Yes.Judge:\nI'm afraid the defense has raised a good point. It appears you have been holding back something.Lamiroir:\n...And I must tell you? I must tell you what it is that I saw?Judge:\nYes. The happenings in this trial are being recorded. And I'm certain it will be on the news in Borginia. You understand your reputation is at stake. It falls to you to avoid tarnishing it.Klavier:\nPersonally speaking... I still believe that cross-examining her will yield us absolutely nothing.Apollo:\nBut she knew how Mr. LeTouse died! And he named her as a witness! You must have seen something, Lamiroir!Judge:\n...Very well. Lamiroir... Please continue your testimony.Lamiroir:\n... Very well, I shall.Witness Testimony-- What I Saw 2 --Lamiroir:\nI was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.\nThere was something like a little window there...

That's how I saw it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nUm, what exactly is something like a little window?\nLamiroir:\nYes, well... \"Window\" is the best word I know in English. I think this is how it is said, yes.\nKlavier:\nYou need not worry, Lamiroir. Your choice of words is impeccable. There is a small window in the dressing room in question. Perhaps the defense remembers this detail?\nApollo:\n(That little window on the wall...)\nLamiroir:\nI, er, saw the crime from there.Lamiroir:\nThere were two shots... I couldn't do anything to stop it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou are certain you heard two shots fired?\nLamiroir:\nYes, quite certain. I was on my way to the backstage exit. This was when I heard a faint sound... like a gunshot. Wondering what it had been, I peered through the window. That is when I heard the second gunshot, much closer.\nApollo:\n(And there were two bullet holes at the scene... no contradictions so far.)\nLamiroir:\n...It all happened on the other side of that window. There was nothing I could do.Lamiroir:\nBut it wasn't Machi!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nIt wasn't Machi who shot... Are you sure?\nLamiroir:\nYes, quite certain.\nKlavier:\nAh ha ha... It amuses me that you would question her testimony. It is testimony in your favor! Isn't it my job to object?\nTrucy:\nYeah, Apollo, what were you thinking!?\nApollo:\nTrucy... Let's just listen to what Lamiroir has to say. Can you tell me how you were so sure?\nLamiroir:\nYes, of course. You see...Lamiroir:\nIt was a grown person! ...I know it was!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"A \"grown person\"... That's a little vague.\"Trucy:\nYou can't ask for a better testimony than that!Apollo:\nI'm not so sure it's all that simple, Trucy. (There's a critical flaw in this testimony... And I have to point it out, even if it isn't good for our case...)Apollo:\nA \"grown person\"... That's a little vague.Lamiroir:\nI am sorry. My skill with your language is... lacking, I know.Judge:\nCertainly you could at least see whether the shooter was male or female?Lamiroir:\n...... It was a man. A young man.Judge:\nAnd you're sure of that?Lamiroir:\nYes, his voice was quite clear.Apollo:\nVoice...?Judge:\nHmm... Looking at this diagram, it seems the dressing room was quite cluttered. It does seem likely that you wouldn't have had a clear view of the shooter.Lamiroir:\nAs a singer, I rely more on my ears than my eyes. When I hear a voice, I do not forget it. That voice... was the voice of a man.Klavier:\nSo you heard a voice. But wait... ...Couldn't that have been the victim, Mr. LeTouse?Lamiroir:\nAbsolutely not. Did I not just say that I do not forget a voice? If it was Mr. LeTouse who spoke, I would have known.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed. So you were at the window, and you heard the shooter's voice, the voice of a young man.Trucy:\nApollo! This is a good testimony! That proves it wasn't Machi!Apollo:\n......Judge:\nIndeed... If this turns out to be true, it would cast this case in a considerably different light. What is the defense's opinion of this testimony...?It's pretty good\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n...Well, I'd have to say it's pretty good. Vital, even. This shows that the shooter wasn't Machi...\nKlavier:\nHah!\nApollo:\n...!\nKlavier:\nSurely you can't be serious, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\nWh-Why not!?\nLeads to:\n\"Lamiroir.\"It's contradictory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nThough it pains me to say this... ...There's something about Lamiroir's testimony that rings false.\nLamiroir:\n...!\nKlavier:\nHeh. Bravo, Herr Forehead. You're colder than I thought.\nApollo:\n(I'm sure you remember what the problem is as well as I do, Gavin.) As has been established... No grown man could pass through that air vent. He couldn't have fled the scene of the crime.\nLamiroir:\n......\nTrucy:\nB-But that means Lamiroir has to be lying!\nApollo:\nI know, and I know it's bad for our case, but I can't shut my eyes to this. (Believe me, the idea was tempting...)\nKlavier:\nIt is as Herr Forehead says. Yet, this is not the only contradiction within her testimony.\nApollo:\nWh-What next!? (What's he talking about?)\nLeads to:\n\"Lamiroir.\"Klavier:\nLamiroir. I understand why you would want to protect Machi. Yet remember, you are the Siren of the Ballad... ...And lies do not become such a creature.Judge:\nWhat does the prosecution mean!?Trucy:\nApollo! What's he talking about!?Apollo:\n(How come no one bats an eye when he says stuff like that?)Klavier:\nI recall the state of the crime scene quite well.Apollo:\nThe state of the room...?Klavier:\nYes, and when the murder took place... ...that window was closed. I find it hard to believe you could hear a voice through it.Lamiroir:\nWhat!? B-But I... I'm sure...Klavier:\n...Lamiroir. I have nothing but the highest regard for your musical sense. ...But my opinion of you as a witness is somewhat lesser.Apollo:Apollo:\nB-But she's the only eye-witness we have!Klavier:Klavier:\nSo you say. And the victim named her, the \"Siren\" as the witness?Apollo:\nTh-That's right! That's what Mr. LeTouse...Klavier:\nWe heard your claim. We even entertained the possibility. And it brought us to this. Herr Judge!Judge:\nYes?Klavier:\nThe prosecution requests that the witness... be excused. Please.Judge:\nHmm... I'm afraid I must honor the prosecution's request. There is indeed a question of the witness's credibility.Apollo:\nB-But if Lamiroir can't testify...Trucy:\nThen we don't have a chance of proving Machi's innocence.Judge:\nThis cross-examination is over! ...Prosecutor Gavin. You may continue making your case.Klavier:\n...Danke. Now where were we? Ah yes, I would like to hear from Fräulein Detective again.Apollo:Apollo:\nWait! Let me hear Lamiroir's testimony one last time...Judge:\nBut the cross-examination is already over. Until such a time as a need arises... ...this witness may leave the stand.Lamiroir:\n...... I'm sorry I could not be of more assistance.Klavier:\n......Klavier:\nAt last, back to the real trial. Ready, Herr Forehead?Apollo:\n(Grr... I hope I didn't just miss my only chance.)Klavier:\nFräulein Detective, how far had we gotten until we were so rudely interrupted?Ema:\nDon't ask me!Klavier:\nI dislike saying the same thing twice. And I never repeat a song for an encore.Judge:\n...If you would, Ms. Skye.Ema:\n...Hmph. I believe I was saying that the only way Mr. LeTouse's killer could have escaped... ...was through that air vent on the ceiling.Judge:\nAh, yes, there was only one door in the room. And a witness, you, was standing in front of it.Ema:\nThat air vent isn't very big, see. Kind of limits the people who could possibly get through.Judge:\nI certainly would have a difficult time.Ema:\nYou sure would. Not that you would have been there in the first place, though. Remember, the whole backstage area was off-limits to people not involved with the concert. The only one who meets the conditions for our killer... is the defendant.Klavier:\n...A virtuoso performance! I couldn't have put it better myself.Judge:\nHmm. She does state a clear case. Though, reading the report, something caught my eye.Klavier:\nOh? What's that?Judge:\nThe circumstances of the defendant's arrest.Apollo:\nThe circumstances...? (Again...?)Trucy:\nHey, that's right, Apollo! Remember when we found Machi? That was bizarre!Apollo:\n(She's right... Why did Mr. LeTouse's body disappear from the room... ...and end up on top of that stage tower? ...Holding a guitar, no less.)Klavier:\n...A perceptive observation, Herr Judge.Judge:\nAh, er, thanks! It was kind of an accident, really. But you work in this job long enough... ...you get a nose for things. Eh he he.Trucy:\nThe judge sure seems pleased with himself!Klavier:\nVery good, Fräulein Detective. Perhaps you can tie it all together for us. Why was the body moved? And how does that lead us to the killer!?Witness Testimony-- The Missing Body --Ema:\nI believe Machi stole the body because of some lyrics.\nHe moved the body to match Lamiroir's song.\nNo one in this country had a motive to kill the victim.\nAnd, Machi practically left his signature at the scene.\nAll of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.Apollo:\nLamiroir's... song?Klavier:\nYes... \"The Guitar's Serenade\". You noticed its \"code\" too, did you not?Apollo:\nIts \"code\"...?Klavier:\nAll the events that day followed the lyrics to our song. First, the keys my \"heart\" held on to so tightly were stolen.Apollo:\nThen Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flames on stage. Mr. LeTouse's life was taken by a bullet...Klavier:\nThe rest hardly needs explanation... \"Guitar, Guitar... Up together to the sky.\"Judge:\nTh-That's mad! It's like a story out of some fairy tale!Apollo:\n(I admit, I'd forgotten about the song... But there it is now, waiting for me... the grand finale, as it were.)Trucy:\nHey! You know I was the one who first noticed that!Judge:\nI've heard of jumping rope to songs, and counting to songs... ...But killing!?Klavier:\nIt's a wild world out there, Herr Judge.Judge:\nVery well! We've heard one song and dance, let's get on to the next: the cross-examination!Apollo:\n(I'm not so sure I'm going to be doing much singing...)Cross Examination",

      "newContext": "-- The Missing Body --Ema:\nI believe Machi stole the body because of some lyrics.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWho would steal a body just to match some lyrics!?\nEma:\nI didn't believe it myself. But it can't just be a coincidence.\nKlavier:\nIt is as Fräulein Detective says. Let us begin with the first verse. If you would, Fräulein Detective.\nEma:\nWhat? You want me to sing it?\nKlavier:\nYou are the witness, ja? Or did you want me to sing? I warn you, my fee as vocalist is not trivial.\nEma:\nFine, fine! Er, ahem. Let's look at the first part of the lyrics, shall we? \"When you stole away the keys my heart held on to so tight.\"\nKlavier:\nIndeed, my favorite heart-shaped key ring was stolen that morning.\nEma:\nNext, we go to the right page of the lyrics sheet. Where we find... \"Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away. All away.\" As we know, Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flame. \"Like a bullet of love. Fire. Take my life away. All away.\" Mr. LeTouse's life was taken by a bullet.\nKlavier:\nBravo, Fräulein Detective. Your singing... it's not bad. Now, for the finale! \"Guitar, Guitar... Up together to the sky.\" As it says in the lyrics, Mr. LeTouse... ...was found with a guitar, high in the \"sky\" over the stage. No series of coincidences could be so well conceived!\nEma:\nHe's right. ...Scientifically speaking.\nApollo:\n(What would Wocky have said? ...\"That concert was wack.\")\nTrucy:\nIt's hard to argue when she pours her heart into it like that.\nEma:\nAh, er, ahem! Anyway, the shooter...Ema:\nHe moved the body to match Lamiroir's song.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nDoes the prosecution have any idea why he'd do all this?\nEma:\nYou want my scientific opinion? \"No clue.\" But, he clearly had a reason to go through all that trouble. Some deep reason.\nApollo:\nA deep reason?\nKlavier:\nNot only did he steal my keys, he torched my guitar! ...Unforgivable acts even if he had a reason... and worse if he had none!\nEma:\nThe diva's complaints aside, I can't imagine someone doing this on \"just a whim\".\nKlavier:\nFräulein Detective! I take offense at that description...\nJudge:\nIndeed, it does seem too well rehearsed, shall we say.\nEma:\nYes. This crime was planned for sure.Ema:\nNo one in this country had a motive to kill the victim.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nBut... Mr. LeTouse spoke English! He may have come to this country before!\nEma:\nI looked into that, I assure you.\nApollo:\nOh.\nEma:\n...It was his first time in the country, it seems. Apparently, he learned English on his own.\nApollo:\n(Great...)\nKlavier:\nYou see? No one here had a motive to kill him, and certainly not in such an elaborate fashion.\nJudge:\nHmm... It does seem difficult to imagine.\nEma:\nUnless our famous prosecutor did it as a publicity stunt.\nKlavier:\nWh-What did you say!?\nJudge:\nProsecutor Gavin! You did this to promote your song!?\nKlavier:\n...... Of course not, and I am quite dismayed by the ludicrous nature of her claim. Why would I need promotion? Everyone already listens to my music.\nTrucy:\nThey're even in my textbook at school.\nApollo:\n(And I'd never heard of them. What does that say about me?)\nEma:\nI was just kidding! Don't get all worked up, glimmer-boy.Ema:\nAnd, Machi practically left his signature at the scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean by his \"signature\"?\nEma:\nThe bullet holes in the wall, of course.\nApollo:\nThe bullet holes...?\nEma:\nThe revolver was fired twice. One shot missed, and left a hole in the wall.\nJudge:\nAnd that means what, exactly?\nEma:\nThat dressing room isn't exactly spacious. Picture the shooter facing off with the victim in there. They can't have been more than five feet apart. It would be difficult, almost impossible to miss at that range.\nJudge:\nDifficult to miss, you say?\nEma:\nVery. Assuming the shooter could properly aim.\nApollo:\nNo! Y-You can't be serious...\nTrucy:\nMachi! He can't see... ...That's why he missed?\nEma:\nIt's the only explanation that makes sense. He used sound and other senses to fire the gun... ...poorly.\nKlavier:\nThat reminds me, the monitor in that room was blaring at the time, ja? Hardly ideal conditions for tracking by sound.\nJudge:\nA blind shooter... No wonder he missed!\nApollo:\n(I knew those bullet holes would come back to haunt me. Think Justice, what do I do now!?)\n\n\n\nRaise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nSure, there were bullet holes left in the wall... ...but that doesn't prove the shooter couldn't see!\nKlavier:\nOh? How so?\nApollo:\nWell, there could have been a struggle with the victim.\nJudge:\nHmm, that's certainly possible.\nApollo:\nAnd... it might have been the revolver's fault.\nJudge:\nThe revolver...?\nApollo:\nThe revolver was a very large caliber, correct?\nJudge:\nIf the shooter wasn't used to firing such a large weapon... Why, it could dislocate their shoulder.\nApollo:\n...Exactly. The defendant, Machi Tobaye, is, as you can see, tiny. It's not so hard to picture him firing the gun and missing entirely! The kickback alone would throw off his aim.\nJudge:\n......\nKlavier:\n......\nEma:\n......\nJudge:\nA convincing argument, to be sure.\nApollo:\n(Ha ha! Take that, smug prosecution!)\nTrucy:\nUm, Apollo?\nApollo:\nHuh? What?\nTrucy:\nThat bit about Machi being tiny... ...and the gun throwing off his aim? Um, aren't you kind of, um... ...admitting that he did it?\nApollo:\n......Oh.\nKlavier:\nIt does not matter why he missed. What matters is that the shooter was, without a doubt, the defendant. Even the defense seems to agree on that point.\nApollo:\nYurk! Uhh... (Cripes! I really put my foot in it this time!)\nKlavier:\nBut, let's get the facts of the matter on the record. If you would, Fräulein Detective.\nJudge:\nVery well. The witness will add this to her testimony.\nEma:\nRight.\nChanges statement from \"All of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.\" to \"From the state of the crime scene, I conclude the shooter was blind.\"\n\n\n\n\nSit back and watch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(He couldn't see, so the first shot missed... ...As explanations go, it's airtight.)\nJudge:\nHmm... It appears the shooter did leave his signature. I'm afraid this is looking bad for our young defendant. The witness may continue with her testimony.\nEma:\nYou got it.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nBy \"signature\", you mean the bullet holes in the wall?\nEma:\nThat's right. Allow me to explain it... scientifically. The murder weapon was fired twice. The shot that missed left a hole in the wall. Furthermore, there was no more than five feet between shooter and victim. Hard to miss at that distance.\nTrucy:\nBut, Machi can't see...\nEma:\nHe would have had to use sound and other senses to aim... ...and miss.\nKlavier:\nAnd our music was blaring over the room monitor. Not the best circumstances for aiming by sound.\nEma:\nWhich makes it very likely that the shooter was blind.\nKlavier:\nThus the prosecution's position.\nEma:\nAhh! Nothing like a scientific explanation to get the blood pumping!\nApollo:\n(Why's mine frozen in my veins, then...?)Ema:\nAll of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nBut, but you can't say that for sure!\nEma:\nPlease, none of those non-scientific objections. They're bad for my complexion.\nApollo:\nWhat's so scientific about a murder to lyrics!?\nEma:\nLyrics can be explained scientifically! ...Never underestimate the power of science!\nApollo:\n(Put that bottle of finger-printing powder down before you hurt someone, like me!) OK, then explain it! Scientifically!\nEma:\n...... I require more data.\nApollo:\n(Hah! Likely story...)Ema:\nFrom the state of the crime scene, I conclude the shooter was blind.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou can't say he was blind just because of those bullet holes in the wall! I think I've proven that!\nEma:\n...I wouldn't call it \"proof\", per se.\nApollo:\nHuh?\nKlavier:\nYou've merely raised a \"possibility\".\nApollo:\n...!\nKlavier:\nFräulein Detective has made a most logical conjecture based upon the evidence. Of course, there is more evidence than just bullet holes. The defendant was the only one who could have escaped through the air vent.\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nBut wait! If he was blind... ...how would he know about the air vent in the first place?\nKlavier:\n...Ah, a very good point. Well, Fräulein Detective? If you would care to explain?\nApollo:\n(He certainly seems sure of himself...)\nEma:\nRecall the crime scene, if you would. There was a stepladder below the air vent. As it happens, maintenance was scheduled for that day. Custodial staff went around checking all the air vents.\nApollo:\nI don't believe it.\nEma:\nEveryone backstage was told about the maintenance. ...Including Machi Tobaye. He would have known that there would be a way out at the top of that stepladder.\nApollo:\nBut that's... Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this!?\nKlavier:\nYou could have figured it out for yourself. You only needed to consider what that stepladder was doing there.\nJudge:\n...Looks like the defense's objection has been squished by a stepladder.\nKlavier:\nWell, Herr Forehead? Out of ammunition, perhaps?\nApollo:\n(I've never seen Prosecutor Gavin so... so aggressive! Maybe he's caught the scent of blood...)\nTrucy:\nApollo! Don't you have something? Anything? You know what we need... We need something to prove the killer could see! That'll put him in his place!\nKlavier:\n......\nApollo:\n(Proving the shooter was sighted would do it. That would take down one of their central points... Do I have any evidence that can prove that though...?)\n\n\n\nPresent evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nFine... I accept the prosecution's challenge.\nKlavier:\nAs I knew you would, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\n(What exactly am I up against here...? The prosecution is saying the shooter missed because he or she couldn't see... Therefore, Machi, who's blind, did it.)\nJudge:\nThe defense will please present their evidence. ...Evidence that overturns the prosecution's claim that the shooter couldn't see!\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is that evidence!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\n...... I'm not sure that overturns anything, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\n(Ugh. Wrong evidence, I'm guessing...)\nKlavier:\nApparently both love... and Justice are blind.\nApollo:\n(I have to think! There must be something... anything!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nNo need\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(I can't think of anything that proves the shooter could see!)\nKlavier:\nYour face does not exactly project... confidence.\nEma:\nMaybe you should just accept it and move on?\nTrucy:\nApollo! Grow a backbone!\nJudge:\nVery well. The witness may continue her testimony.\nApollo:\n(I couldn't even get a word in edgewise...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThe prosecution holds that the \"shooter couldn't see\".\nEma:\nA scientific conclusion based on a thorough examination of the crime scene, yes.\nApollo:\nApparently not thorough enough. I have a certain piece of evidence that completely overturns your claim!\nEma:\nWh-What!?\nKlavier:\n......\nLeads to:\n\"This is that evidence!\"Trucy:\nThis doesn't look so good, does it, Apollo?Apollo:\nNo, it doesn't.Trucy:\n...... What do we do!?Apollo:\n(First, we don't panic. Even though Machi's case is leaking water by the gallon. Gavin's on a roll, and it's up to me to stop him!)Apollo:\nThis is that evidence!Judge:\nThe photograph of the crime scene...?Apollo:\n(I don't care much for the smirk on Prosecutor Gavin's face... But this is no time to think twice... Time to press on!) Yes, Your Honor, the crime scene. There is something in here that decisively contradicts the prosecution's point!Klavier:\nThen perhaps you'd best show us this \"something\". Get your finger out of the breeze and put it to good use, ja?Judge:\nVery well, show us what you're talking about, Mr. Justice! The contradiction at the scene of the crime is...Present smeared blood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The contradiction is right here!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nLook! The contradiction's right there! Plain as day!\nJudge:\n...... Your finger has a force of weight... ...that I'm afraid your argument lacks, Mr. Justice. I see nothing!\nApollo:\n(Ugh... What a time to mess up.)\nKlavier:\nI believe all he has added to our understanding of this photo... is his fingerprint. I would hope you could refrain from soiling the evidence, Herr Forehead.\nJudge:\nPerhaps Mr. Justice would care to try again?\nLeads back to:\n\"The contradiction at the scene of the crime is...\"Apollo:\nThe contradiction is right here!Ema:\nThe smeared blood stains...!Judge:\nHmm... I thought it was just my blurry vision. But it really was blurry! The way the victim's hand is raised above his head... ...Much like a gesture I have seen many times in this court.Ema:\nIt's almost as if he wrote something...?Trucy:\nAh ha! I get it! At least, I think I get it!Klavier:\nGet what, Fräulein?Trucy:\nWhen Mr. LeTouse was shot, he tried to write something! And what would he write but the shooter's name? And what would he write it in but his own blood? Pretty good, huh?Apollo:\n(Thanks for making my point for me...) Yes, in fact, that's what I think happened here.Judge:\nHmm... That does seem to be a distinct possibility.Ema:\nThe victim wrote the killer's name... ...It's certainly a logical conclusion.Trucy:\nDrat! I just wish it wasn't all rubbed out like that.Judge:\nOf course it's rubbed out. Why, if I were a killer... ...I certainly wouldn't want to leave my own name behind!Klavier:\nNeither would I.Ema:\n......Klavier:\n......Judge:\n......Apollo:\nUm... No one has anything else to say?Judge:\n...About what?Apollo:\nSo the prosecution accepts this? You agree this was the victim making an attempt to record the name of the killer? ...And that the killer tried to rub the name out?Ema:\nWhat's your point?Apollo:\nWhat's my point!? Let me ask you this: How did the killer know the victim was writing their name?Ema:\nWell, Mr. LeTouse was writing something in blood. Once the killer saw what it was... ...Wait.Judge:\nOnce he \"saw\" what it was...?Apollo:\nBut what did you just testify about the shooter?Ema:\nI said... they were blind. Ack!!!Apollo:\nYet the crime scene itself contradicts that! The killer had to have been able to see! Why would they rub out the name in blood otherwise?Ema:\nAh... ahh...Apollo:\nMay I remind the court that the defendant, Machi Tobaye, is blind! He couldn't have been the shooter!Ema:\nUrk... Immmmmmmmposssssibbleee!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!! P-Prosecutor Gavin! Please explain to me what all this means!?Klavier:\n......Judge:\nI mean, looking at this photo... It seems quite clear that the shooter could see! Yet, up until now...Klavier:\n...It seems I owe the court an apology.Judge:\nHmm!?Klavier:\nThe Gavinners are a band with law enforcement ties, yet a murder occurred... ...during our concert! Apparently, this caused some confusion over jurisdiction. As a result, some reports were not filed in an entirely timely manner.Apollo:\n(I... I'm not sure I like the vibe I'm getting here.)Trucy:\nHey Apollo, look at him. Why is Prosecutor Gavin all relaxed and smiling like that? Like he knows something we don't... and he's about to tell us.Klavier:\nHeh heh heh. I've got an idea... Let's rock! ...With these documents. But before that. I have a question for the Fräulein Detective. If I may?Ema:\nWh-What?Klavier:\nTell me... Why do you think that Machi Tobaye is blind?Ema:\nHuh...?Apollo:\nWh-What did he say?Ema:\nWhat are you saying? Of course he's blind!Klavier:\nOf course...?Ema:\nH-He's the blind pianist, right? So... So he's... Doesn't Lamiroir lead him around by the hand all the time?Apollo:\n(No way...)Klavier:\nI have a report here on the defendant, Machi Tobaye. According to this, Machi Tobaye... ...can see perfectly well.Ema:\nWhat...?Klavier:\nHis blindness was merely a publicity ploy by those clever Borginians. He can see quite well.Apollo:Apollo:\nB-But you said...Klavier:\n...What did I say, exactly?Apollo:\n!Klavier:\nHerr Forehead, not once in the course of this trial... ...have I claimed the defendant was blind. The only one who did was Fräulein Detective.Apollo:\nBu-But that's...Klavier:\n...A significant fact, yes! Consider: Machi Tobaye sees. And he was the only one who could have fled through the air vent. I see no problems with this.Ema:\nBut what about the bullet holes in the wall?Klavier:\nYes, the bullet holes. I believe Herr Forehead neatly explained those for us. He didn't miss because he couldn't see. It was the kickback from the 45-caliber revolver. A simple accident, in other words.Apollo:\nAck...!Klavier:\nHow's that? I'm afraid your \"objection\" has just flown off for brighter skies...Apollo:\nUrk...Klavier:\nThis is where the real fun begins, Herr Forehead!Apollo:\nYeeeeaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrggh!Klavier:\nI knew you didn't have what it took.Ema:\nYou... You jerk! Just what was I in here for? Comic relief!?Trucy:\nYeah! Apologize!Klavier:\nAh ha ha. Oh, sorry!Trucy:\nThat's no way to apologize!Apollo:\n(He's angered the Trucy now. Look out...)Judge:\nAhem. If we can please end the bickering. Now.Ema:\nWhatever! I'm not leaving! I can't leave like this. I'll come up with some clue to solving this case if it kills me!Judge:\nBut your testimony has already given us enough to convict the defendant...Apollo:\n(Ugh, don't say that...)Ema:\nAh! Ah ha!Apollo:\n\"Ah ha\" what?Ema:\nThis blood stain... The criminal tried to wipe it off, right?Apollo:\nThat seems to be what happened, yes.Ema:\nWe might be able to find out what was really written here!Apollo:\n...! Really...? You can do that?Ema:\nThat's right, with this! It's called Luminol! Maybe you know of it? It's a chemical that reacts to blood.Klavier:\nAh yes, have we done those tests yet...?Ema:\nHah! As if I'm going to tell you!Klavier:\nThe blood stains covered a section of the carpet. In order to perform blood tests, that section was removed and submitted. Perhaps we should request it here in court now.Ema:\nRight! Go for it, Apollo!Apollo:\nHuh? I have to do the test?Ema:\nYou just have to spray the luminol on it! Simple!Apollo:\n(A chemical that reacts to blood... I've heard of this somewhere.)Judge:\n...Yes, I believe an analysis is called for. Have at it!Ema:\nRight, ready? It's easy as pie! Just press [A / Space] to spray an area. (Changed from [Just touch the screen to spray an area.] in the original release) Here! Give it a try!Apollo:\n(...The eyes of the entire court are focused on me!)Trucy:\nApollo! Your hand's shaking!Apollo:\n(Ugh... Grrrah! Let's do this!)Spray smeared writing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wow... it really works!\"Apollo:\n(Wow... it really works!)Trucy:\nThis must be... this must be the power of science!Ema:\nIt says... \"IPXX314206\"... ...Is that the killer's name?Judge:\nHmm. Maybe it is... if the killer was a robot!Klavier:\nAh hah! I have it!Apollo:\n...So what is it?Klavier:\nI thought those letters \"IPXX\" looked familiar. This is an Interpol ID number.Ema:\nI-Interpol? You mean the international police agency?Klavier:\nYes. Most are undercover agents working to solve international crimes. But why would he write that number...?Apollo:\nWhy would Mr. LeTouse even know a number like that!?Klavier:\nGood show, Fräulein Detective. Rock on.Ema:\nEh?Klavier:\nYour Honor! We can verify this number immediately. ...Daryan, are you there? Come up to the witness stand!Klavier:\nDaryan... you heard what we need. Go check into this Interpol ID number.Daryan:\nSure thing. Gimme 30 minutes. No... Gimme 27.Judge:\nHmm... I'm not sure what to think of all this. The prosecution's case is airtight, or so it seems. Yet if this number is really that of an Interpol agent...Ema:\nOh, wait, I know... What if Machi Tobaye's really an undercover Interpol agent?Klavier:\nThat would be a possibility.Judge:\nA possibility, yes. And one that would mark him as the killer for certain.Apollo:\n(Why did LeTouse know an Interpol ID number...? That's what I want to know.)Klavier:\nWell, we have some time while we await Daryan's report. Let's work on unraveling another mystery, shall we? A curious mystery concerning Machi Tobaye.Apollo:\n...What are you talking about?Klavier:\nFräulein Detective, please accept my apologies. I received word that the defendant could, in fact, see, just before the trial began. It seemed too much of a bother to tell you.Ema:\n...You had me until that last bit.Klavier:\nDoes this not raise a rather straightforward question?Ema:\nWell, sure... Why did Machi pretend he couldn't see?Klavier:\nExactly... It makes little sense. What do you think, Herr Forehead?Apollo:\nHuh? Me?Klavier:\nMachi Tobaye pretended he was blind... ...Do you know why?Ema:\nHow could he know!?Trucy:\nWait... Prosecutor Gavin knows why, doesn't he...Apollo:\n(He's known from the start of the trial. He's been leading us on the whole time!)Klavier:\nHmm? Something wrong? Do you think, perhaps, this is all some kind of game? Know that the moment I heard that report... ...I knew why.Judge:\nHmm... I suppose people who have sold over a million records really are something else.Apollo:\n(What does that have to do with anything!?)Klavier:\nThere was a reason why Machi Tobaye pretended to be blind. But it wasn't for his own sake. ...Getting the picture now?Apollo:\nIt wasn't for himself...!?Judge:\nWell, Mr. Justice? Can you present evidence that shows us why the defendant had to feign blindness?Show evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(Machi had no reason to pretend he couldn't see... Which means... No. It couldn't be!)\nKlavier:\n...Good show, Herr Forehead. It seems you've thought of something.\nApollo:\n(Grr... Why can't I figure these things out on my own? I hate having to take my cues from this guy.) ...Very well. Look at this. This is why he was pretending he couldn't see!\n\n\n\nPresent Postcard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\nThat is... Lamiroir?\nApollo:\nLamiroir and Machi Tobaye. Recall their relationship. In particular, their unique arrangement over the years before visiting our country.\nEma:\nLamiroir and her pianist... They would always walk together, she leading him by the hand. Even when they got on stage, she would lead him to the piano. She would walk all the way over there with him!\nApollo:\nThat's right. Because he was \"blind\". She led him at all times, never letting him go.\nJudge:\nAll times... Hmm.\nApollo:\nYet, we have just learned something that makes their arrangement peculiar indeed. Machi could see! Why did they have to keep up this act the whole time?\nJudge:\nWell, wasn't it part of their, er, performance?\nApollo:\nI think there's a simpler explanation. Machi did not need to be led by the hand at all. That can only mean one thing.\nEma:\nAh! Aaaaaaaaaaa... Really!?\nApollo:\nReally. It was all the other way around. The one who needed to be led by the hand... ...was Lamiroir!\nJudge:\nWh-What's this...? S-So you mean to say that Lamiroir is... she's...\nApollo:\nYes, Your Honor. Lamiroir is blind.\nEma:\nWha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!! This is crazy, Prosecutor Gavin!\nKlavier:\nIs it now?\nJudge:\nPlease... Please shed some sanity on this madness! The defense has made an outrageous claim...\nKlavier:\nThe only thing outrageous I see about the defense is his vast forehead... ...Yet I see it is not vast in vain. This time. He's quite correct.\nJudge:\nB-But that makes no sense!\nLeads to:\n\"Yeah! Wasn't she supposed to be the \"landscape painter in sound\" or something?\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\nWhat... is that supposed to mean? I don't see how it relates to the defendant's vision or lack thereof.\nApollo:\nWell, see, it... (...is the wrong piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nI do see how your lack of an answer relates to this penalty, however!\nKlavier:\nAh ha ha ha. Herr Forehead, I'm disappointed in you. Unless you're merely \"feigning\" stupidity? Ja?\nApollo:\n(Keep it up wise guy...)\nKlavier:\nRecall the relationship of Lamiroir and Machi Tobaye. In particular, their arrangement over the years before visiting our country.\nEma:\nLamiroir and her pianist... They would always walk together, she leading him by the hand. Even when they got on stage, she would lead him to the piano. She would walk all the way over there with him!\nKlavier:\nThat's right. Because he was \"blind\". Or so we thought... She led him at all times. All times.\nJudge:\nAll times... Hmm.\nKlavier:\nYet we now know that Machi could see perfectly well. Why keep up the charade?\nJudge:\nWell, wasn't it part of their, er, performance?\nKlavier:\nThere is a simpler explanation, Herr Judge. Machi did not need to be led by the hand at all. Which means...\nApollo:\nAaaaah! You don't mean---!?\nKlavier:\nI do. It was the other way around! The one who needed to be led by the hand... ...was Lamiroir!\nJudge:\nWh-What's this...?\nJudge:\nS-So you mean to say that Lamiroir is... she's...\nKlavier:\nBlind as a bat, Herr Judge.\nEma:\nWha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!! This is crazy, Prosecutor Gavin!\nLeads to:\n\"Yeah! Wasn't she supposed to be the \"landscape painter in sound\" or something?\"I haven't a clue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n...... (I have no idea!)\nKlavier:\nAh ha ha ha.

Wasn't she supposed to be the \"landscape painter in sound\" or something?Klavier:\nWell, since we have her here...Ema:\n!Klavier:\n...Why not ask Lamiroir herself? I believe she is still in the witness waiting room.Trucy:\nA-Apollo, what does this mean for our case!?Apollo:\nDon't ask me! I had no idea she couldn't see... I hadn't even imagined it until now!Judge:\nBailiff! Bring in Lamiroir!Klavier:\n...Lamiroir. It pains me deeply to call you before us again in this way. And yet I must.Lamiroir:\nPlease, do not be concerned on my behalf.Apollo:\n(Those eyes... She really can't see? Really?)Lamiroir:\n...... It is true.Apollo:\n...!Lamiroir:\nHow funny it is that a tiny lie born in the Borginian countryside... ...would one day grow to entangle the entire world.Judge:\nSo... So you are...!?Lamiroir:\nYes. As I mentioned before... ...I have no memory of the time before I became Lamiroir. Know too that my memories begin in darkness. The word \"light\" has no meaning for Lamiroir.Judge:\nI see...Klavier:\nYou may recall me saying something toward the beginning of this trial, Herr Forehead.Apollo:\n...? What's that?Klavier:\nI believe I said it was unfortunate this crime had no \"direct\" witnesses.Apollo:\nAh...Klavier:\nNow, Lamiroir, I must ask you to stand once more. Will you testify to the court about your eyes?Lamiroir:\nOf course. It was never my intent to deceive any of you. May I begin, Your Honor?Judge:\nUh, yes, yes of course... Though I admit, I'm a little lost here.Apollo:\nI think we're all a bit lost here, Your Honor.Witness Testimony-- Lamiroir's Eyes --Lamiroir:\nI have no memory of the \"light\".\nI debuted in a world of darkness and sound...\nMy producer came up with my PR line before he knew this.\nSo, silly as it may sound, I had to pretend I could see.\nEveryone on my staff knew, of course, but no others.Judge:\nBut... this is a murder trial!Lamiroir:\nI apologize. It was part of my contract, you see. I was to keep my blindness a secret, no matter what. Music is everything for me. I never imagined something like this would...Klavier:\nShe told us the truth in the beginning. When she said she \"saw nothing\".Judge:\nVery well. Does the defense have anything to add?Apollo:\n...... I'd like to cross-examine.Trucy:\nBut, what is there left to ask!?Apollo:\nThere was one thing in her testimony that bothered me.Klavier:\nPerhaps it is best we let you get it out of your system. Someday you'll come to understand... ...the importance of thinking for yourself.Judge:\nVery well. The defense may proceed. However... Be aware this court will not tolerate any questions deemed too stressful to the witness.Apollo:\n...OK. (There was only one part that bothered me... Just let me ask about that and I'll be happy.)Cross Examination",

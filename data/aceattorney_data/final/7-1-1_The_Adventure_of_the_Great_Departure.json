      "newContext": "The Adventure of the Great DepartureTranscriptAnime cutsceneThe Empire of Japan - after opening its doors a push for cultural transformation brought great waves of Western influence to this Far Eastern island nation. The revolution washed over the land, making life in the capital exciting and unsettling. It was a period of great change, and some were swept away by the tide. But for one man the turbulence of that era was just the beginning of an extraordinary story.Episode IThe Adventure of the Great Departure22nd November, 8:43 a.m.Supreme Court of Judicature, Defendants' Antechamber 5???:(I still can't believe it. I still can't believe this is happening. How can it be that just beyond the doors to this quiet little chamber... ...is the highest court in Japan, waiting to decide my fate?)Bailiff:What????:Oh! No, nothing...Bailiff:Save your glares... murderer!???:......... Sorry...Ryunosuke:(My name is Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a second-year student at the Imperial Yumei University. Three days ago, I somehow found myself in the middle of a horrifying incident. And now here I am, awaiting my trial.)???:That's enough! He's not obliged to listen to such abuse, Officer.Bailiff:And who are YOU?!???:I'm this man's lawyer. I'll be defending him today.Bailiff:Lawyer????:Yes. And until the judge has given his verdict on the case... ...no one has the right to treat him as a criminal. So you will hold your tongue!Bailiff:Tsk! Technicalities! Look at you, you haven't even graduated yet!???:And yet, I still seem to know better than you how a court officer should behave. Right, Ryunosuke?Ryunosuke:Oh! Y-Yes, of course! Sorry!???:......... What are you apologising to me for?Ryunosuke:Oh, I... No, I suppose that wasn't my fault. ......... But really, Kazuma, I never meant to drag you into this. I'm sorry...Kazuma:Ha ha ha hah! There you go again, apologising! Just like always.Ryunosuke:Ah...Kazuma:Though I must say, you've been all over the newspapers these past few days. 'Yumei University Professor Murdered in Cold Blood by Student!' But obviously...you didn't actually do it, did you?Ryunosuke:Of course not! You have to believe me! I didn't do it! I... I could never murder someone...Kazuma:Then there's nothing to worry about. Straighten yourself up. Hold your head high.Ryunosuke:You mean...?Kazuma:I believe you. I know you're innocent, Ryunosuke.Ryunosuke:Kazuma Asogi, my best friend. Also in his second year at Yumei University. But he's far more clever than I. A star student, in fact. He's even a qualified lawyer. Impressive, considering he's still an undergraduate.Kazuma:It's not that impressive. The very concept of lawyers is only a few years old. Here in Japan, anyway. My qualifications don't mean much. Yet.Ryunosuke:You said exactly the same thing three days ago. But I'm proud to have a friend like you, Kazuma. Truly. (Three days ago... Yes, that's when all this started...)Ryunosuke:Congratulations, Kazuma! It looks like you're going to get to study abroad at last!Kazuma:I know! I've been forever dreaming of this day. Finally, those government elites have acknowledged my academic achievements and successes in court.Ryunosuke:So you'll be representing Japan as you immerse yourself in the most sophisticated legal system in the world! I'm really happy for you. And proud, as your friend. (There's not a soul in the university who doesn't know Kazuma's name. He's a living legend! It's like there's some mysterious aura billowing around his temple.)Kazuma:I want to bring about change in our own legal system. That's why I have to cross the ocean to see the real thing with my own eyes.Ryunosuke:The heart of the British Empire... I wish I could see it, too.Kazuma:Then come with me! We'd have a wild time tearing up the streets of Her Majesty's City of London together!Ryunosuke:If only it were that simple...Kazuma:Oh dear, look at the time. I'd better be going.Ryunosuke:Alright, I'll see you later. I think I'll stay and enjoy this place a while longer.Kazuma:Good idea. After all, it's not every day you get to visit a high-class Western restaurant like this! See you in English class tomorrow, then...partner!Ryunosuke:(It was straight after that. That's when it happened...)???:Asogi. May I have a word?Kazuma:Professor! I didn't know you were coming.???:Well, this case has personal significance to me. But never mind that for now. Asogi... You should go immediately to the judge's chambers.Kazuma:To His Excellency's chambers? Why????:He was looking for you before. You advocating for the defence in this trial was a sudden decision. It seems there may be some confusion about procedures today as a result.Ryunosuke:(Who is this man? I feel as though I've seen him at university before...)Kazuma:I see. I'll go at once then.???:I shall accompany you.Kazuma:Alright then, Ryunosuke. I'll see you in the courtroom.Ryunosuke:Yes. Thanks, Kazuma. .........???:.........Ryunosuke:......... (Ugh, this is awkward...)???:If I may...?Ryunosuke:Yes, sorry????:You must be the defendant. Ryunosuke Naruhodo, I believe?Ryunosuke:Yes! Yes, that's right!Mikotoba:My name is Yujin Mikotoba. I'm a professor of forensic medicine at Yumei University.Ryunosuke:Ah, Professor Mikotoba... (I've heard that name from Kazuma before. As I recall, he's been pushing to get the government to agree to Kazuma studying abroad.)Mikotoba:Asogi has told me about you. You and he are best friends, I understand.Ryunosuke:...!Mikotoba:As such, I feel you should know...Ryunosuke:Know what?Mikotoba:Well, as you've no doubt heard, Asogi has been granted permission to go and study in Great Britain. However... If he should fail to defend you in today's trial... ...I'm afraid that that permission will be revoked...and never granted again.Ryunosuke:What?!Mikotoba:Ah, as I suspected... You were unaware of this. I had a feeling Asogi may have chosen not to tell you.Ryunosuke:...! (He's agreed to defend me, knowing that if he fails, his dreams will be shattered?) But I don't understand! Why would the government do such a thing?Mikotoba:The administration has to choose from a large number of applicants for overseas study. It's very difficult to persuade them to grant permission, even in the most favourable of circumstances.Ryunosuke:I don't believe it... ......... But I... I didn't do it! I swear it! I'm not a murderer...Mikotoba:I'm sure that's true. Nevertheless... I can assure you that proving your innocence will be no easy task. You see, there are certain...'peculiarities' about today's trial.Ryunosuke:Sorry? What do you mean?Mikotoba:You'll soon understand, once proceedings get underway.Ryunosuke:...! But... Then what should I do?Mikotoba:Well... Naturally I'm not going to suggest doing anything that could lead to a conviction.Ryunosuke:Right, so...Mikotoba:As soon as the trial starts... ...the judge will pose a certain question to the defence. When that happens, you must answer before anyone else. You must say, 'I do'.Ryunosuke:'I do'...? But, what will the question be? Surely...not...? 'Do you accept the accusations brought before you?'...Mikotoba:Of course not.Bailiff:Defendant! Court is about to begin. Proceed to the courtroom at once!Mikotoba:Ah, it would seem our surreptitious discussions are to be cut short. So allow me to summarise... Kazuma Asogi must not be the defence lawyer in this trial. Of course, as the defendant, the final decision is yours.Bailiff:What are you waiting for? Do you want to be found guilty for failing to appear?! Get moving! There's no point in anyone advocating for the likes of you anyway!Ryunosuke:This is it... If this trial goes badly... ...Kazuma's dreams of studying abroad are over. And what's more... ...I'll be found guilty...of murder.And so... ...with absolutely no idea of what lay ahead, I embarked on that unforgettable trial. My one and only chance of proving my innocence, the trial that would decide my destiny!22nd November, 9:00 a.m.Supreme Court of Judicature, Courtroom 2Ryunosuke:So this... is a courtroom...Kazuma:The Supreme Court of Judicature. No court in the land has more power.Ryunosuke:I don't much like the look of those people sitting in the public gallery. (Lots of military and other uniforms in there...)Kazuma:The powers that be have demanded that this be a secret trial.Ryunosuke:A secret trial?Kazuma:A trial that's closed to ordinary members of the public. Only military and government officials may attend.Ryunosuke:What? But why?Kazuma:It'll become clear in time. But for now... ...you need to concentrate, Ryunosuke. It's about to begin.Judge:The court will now hear the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo.Auchi:The prosecution is ready, Your Excellency.Kazuma:As is the defence.Judge:Before we begin, there is one point of order I would like to confirm. Yesterday evening, the defence made a last-minute request for a change of advocate.Kazuma:That's correct, Your Excellency. I made the request myself.Judge:Normal procedure is for the defendant's advocacy to be decided two days prior to trial. As this is an unusual circumstance, I am obliged to ask for final confirmation now. Who advocates for the defendant in this trial?Ryunosuke:(This is it! This must be the question! Who's going to defend me? That's the question the professor meant. But then, if I say, 'I do'... ......... I need to answer quickly! What should I do?)Answer 'I do'Leads to:\"Your Excellency, no confirmation is needed.\"Wait and seeRyunosuke:(Kazuma is the lawyer here. I can't defend myself. If I said 'I do', it would be tantamount to lying. And I've been accused of murder, for goodness' sake! This is no time for lies.)Kazuma:Try to stop fidgeting, Ryunosuke. It's distracting.Ryunosuke:(But if I don't say I'll defend myself now... ...things could end very badly for my friend.)Leads to:\"Your Excellency, no confirmation is needed.\"Kazuma:Your Excellency, no confirmation is needed. As I'm standing here beside the defendant, I hope it's clear who will advocate for his defence.Ryunosuke:Judge:What is the meaning of this unruly outburst?Ryunosuke:I, I would like to inform the court that, that... ...I, Ryunosuke Naruhodo, will be defending myself!Judge:You'll be... WHAAAT?!Kazuma:What are you playing at, Ryunosuke!Ryunosuke:Professor Mikotoba told me everything. Just now, before the trial.Kazuma:He did what?Ryunosuke:He said that your dreams of studying abroad would be dashed if you were to lose.Kazuma:......... How sad. It means you don't have faith in me. You think I won't be able to get you off.Ryunosuke:No! It's not that, really! It's just that... Well, on the off-chance that things don't go well for me, I couldn't bear to be the reason that you...Kazuma:......... Yes. I knew that's how you'd feel. Which is exactly why I decided not to tell you. Tsk! Professor Mikotoba shouldn't have stuck his nose in.Judge:Very well. The court hereby recognises the defendant's desire to advocate for himself in today's trial.Auchi:Well, well... Does the accused admit defeat already? Renouncing his own counsel! Really!Kazuma:Kazuma:Make no mistake, Counsel... This merely shows that the defendant's innocence is so apparent, he's confident he can speak for himself. Isn't that so, Naruhodo-san?Ryunosuke:Hm? ...Oh! Yes, exactly! (Exactly what I WASN'T thinking! I'm not confident at all. In fact, my mind's a complete blank...)Kazuma:I realize you're in charge now, but still... Try not to look so bewildered.Auchi:Hmph. Well, for a mere university student to be brought before the Supreme Court... ...you must have perpetrated a most heinous crime indeed.Judge:As you are no doubt aware, this is the Supreme Court of Judicature of Japan. Accordingly, the very highest standards of conduct are expected of all present. Do I make myself clear, Defendant Naruhodo?Ryunosuke:Yes! ...Your Excellency!Judge:It is therefore my duty to assess your competence for the task you have undertaken.Ryunosuke:My competence? (What does that mean?)Kazuma:He's questioning your ability to do the job.Ryunosuke:(Well, he can't be questioning it more than I am!)Judge:So, let's start with the very simplest of questions.Ryunosuke:Oh, um... Yes!Judge:Kindly state before the court the name of the victim in this case.Ryunosuke:(Well that's easy enough. I've heard his name more times than I'd care to remember. But... Wait. Ugh, I'm so nervous, I can't even remember that! What was it again?)Kazuma:Ryunosuke... Let me guess. Your mind's gone blank?Ryunosuke:Erm... (You know me so well.)Kazuma:All the relevant information for this case can be found in the Court Record.Ryunosuke:But, but I can't even find that...Kazuma:It's simple. You can access the Court Record with a press of [R / E]. If you ever find you've forgotten something, just consult that. It's all in there.Ryunosuke:(I just have to press [R / E] for the Court Record? Alright, there's no time to lose!)Kazuma:This is the list of evidence you've collected. Now try switching to 'People' instead with [R / RB / E]. You'll find details about the victim in here. When you're done, just press [B / Z] to go back. So remember, everything to do with the current case can be found in the Court Record. Now, you'd better not keep His Excellency waiting any longer. Go on. Find the victim in the 'People' section of the Court Record, then press [X / Y / R] to 'Present'. Try it now.Present John H. Wilson profileRyunosuke:Leads to:\"The victim's name was Dr John H. Wilson.\"Present Kazuma Asogi profileRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:The victim was none other than...Kazuma Asogi! Auchi:Auchi:Oh? Then why is that pompous-looking boy with the billowing headband still there standing next to you?!Ryunosuke:Oops!Kazuma:'Oops!' doesn't do that justice. Not content with having killed Dr Wilson, now you're claiming my murder as well?Ryunosuke:I haven't killed anyone!Kazuma:Then concentrate! And actually read the Court Record before you answer!Judge:I must say, you are not instilling the court with much confidence here.Kazuma:Quickly, give him the correct answer before he turns his gavel on you.Leads back to:\"Find the victim in the 'People' section of the Court Record, then press [X / Y / R] to 'Present'.\"Present Taketsuchi Auchi profileRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:The victim was none other than.. Taketsuchi Auchi!Kazuma:Then who's the uptight, bespectacled topknot standing opposite?Auchi:Who's a 'bespectacled topknot'?!Ryunosuke:Ugh... Sorry, for some reason that just came out, even though I know it's wrong.Auchi:Perhaps you're unaware that I am a master of the ancient Noh-style sword art! A pathetic little child like you would be sliced to pieces before you even came close to taking my life!Kazuma:I wouldn't provoke that proud Edo spirit. He might draw his blade on you.Ryunosuke:(I, I thought courtroom sparring was supposed to be done with words...)Judge:I must say, you are not instilling the court with much confidence here.Kazuma:Quickly, give him the correct answer before he turns his gavel on you.Leads back to:\"Find the victim in the 'People' section of the Court Record, then press [X / Y / R] to 'Present'.\"Present anyone elseRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:Erm... The victim's name is-Kazuma:Stop. You're just saying a random name that you come across in the Court Record, aren't you?Ryunosuke:Um... How did you guess?Kazuma:It's blatantly obvious... ...from your wide-eyed look of bewilderment.Judge:I must say, you are not instilling the court with much confidence here.Kazuma:Quickly, give him the correct answer before he turns his gavel on you.Leads back to:\"Find the victim in the 'People' section of the Court Record, then press [X / Y / R] to 'Present'.\"Ryunosuke:The victim's name was Dr John H. Wilson.Auchi:Tsh huh huh... Well, at least you can remember the name of an esteemed member of your own university.Kazuma:Dr Wilson was a visiting professor from England, invited to Yumei University three years ago.Judge:Indeed. Which is the reason why this case has such profound implications. The British Empire... ...is at present, our country's most valuable foreign ally. And as most of you will be aware, we have just signed a new treaty together, after lengthy negotiations.Kazuma:There can't be anyone who hasn't heard of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Friendship and Navigation.Auchi:And yet despite these delicate circumstances, the blood of an Englishman has been spilt on our soil! You two are both undergraduates at the Imperial Yumei University, are you not? Murdering a professor from the very institution that provides your education... Have you no honour?!Ryunosuke:Ugh... (But I didn't do it...)Judge:This case is coming under great scrutiny from our allies on the other side of the world. The court therefore wishes for a speedy resolution to this matter.Kazuma:Hmph. In other words, our feeble government is scared of upsetting England's policy makers. And you're a convenient and expendable scapegoat to blame for this crime.Ryunosuke:So that's why this trial has these unusual peculiarities, is it?Kazuma:Exactly. Our government needs to convict someone as quickly as possible. All because the victim was an Englishman.Ryunosuke:(Yes, Dr Wilson was an Englishman... But nationalities and treaties won't make any difference for me here. The fact is, I was there at the scene of the crime...)Kazuma:Oh dear, look at the time. I'd better be going.Ryunosuke:Alright, I'll see you later. I think I'll stay and enjoy this place a little longer.Kazuma:Good idea. After all, it's not every day you get to visit a high-class Western restaurant like this! See you in English class tomorrow, then...partner!Ryunosuke:(The British Empire... Wow, it's incredible to think- ......... Wait. I've seen that man at university. I'm sure he's a visiting professor from Great Britain. I don't know his name, but still... I should go and say hello.)Ryunosuke:So I went over to the professor's table... ...and introduced myself to Dr Wilson.Judge:Now, then...let me pose my next question to you, Defendant Naruhodo.Ryunosuke:Yes, Your Excellency!Judge:How did this professor of medicine, Dr John H. Wilson, lose his life? State before the court the cause of death.Ryunosuke:(The cause of death... Well, obviously, that was...um...)Kazuma:Ryunosuke... Remember that in court, every assertion must be backed up by evidence.Ryunosuke:By evidence? But, how?Kazuma:Find the piece of evidence that shows the professor's cause of death, and select 'Present'. Do it now!Present Post-Mortem ReportRyunosuke:Leads to:\"Um, well...\"Present anything elseRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:The evidence that clearly shows the victim's cause of death is of course...this!Judge:And on what basis do you present this evidence?Ryunosuke:Well, um... Because it was in the Court Record, of course!Kazuma:Slow down. Why did you pick that? Isn't there something more relevant-looking?Ryunosuke:Well, now that you say that, I suppose...Kazuma:Pick the wrong piece of evidence again, and it won't be a mystery as to YOUR cause of death!Ryunosuke:(Yikes! He sounds - and looks - deadly serious!)Leads back to:\"Find the piece of evidence that shows the professor's cause of death, and select 'Present'.\"Ryunosuke:Um, well... According to this document, the victim suffered a 'he-morr-hagic death due to gunshot trauma'.Auchi:Learn to read, you imbecile! That's the post-mortem report, I take it?Ryunosuke:Sorry, yes! That's right. The, um, post-mortem report.Kazuma:In the West, a doctor dissects corpses to identify the cause of death in an 'autopsy'. But here in Japan, a police officer merely inspects the body, and draws conclusions that way.Ryunosuke:Oh, I see! (As long as I'm not going to be tested on any of this later...)Auchi:This is a so-called photographic print of the scene of the crime. You can clearly discern scorch marks around the bullet hole produced by the powder explosion. In other words, we should assume that the victim was shot at close range.Judge:Thank you, Counsel. The court will accept this modern scientific evidence into the record.The photographic print of the victim has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke:(So that's a photographic print. Well, that's something I've never seen before... It's clearly superior to a drawing. The detail is incredible...)Judge:Very well. I am satisfied with your answers. Let us start the trial.Auchi:Certainly, Your Excellency. So, without further ado, in order to better apprise the court with the facts of the case... ...the prosecution hereby calls its first witness, who was there at the scene of the crime when it happened!Ryunosuke:(Ugh... This is it, then...)Kazuma:Hmph.. I think I may have worked out what the professor had in mind.Ryunosuke:The professor? You mean, Dr Mikotoba?Kazuma:Yes. Clearly, you're the defence lawyer today, not me. But that doesn't mean... Well, I can still act as your assistant.Ryunosuke:Oh! (Of course!) When he was speaking with me before, he simply said: 'Kazuma Asogi must not be the defence lawyer in this trial.'Kazuma:Hm, he really has been sticking his oar in, hasn't he?Ryunosuke:Maybe, but...any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated, Kazuma!Kazuma:Well, my first piece of advice is: Rein in that crazy look of bewilderment and control the cold sweats!Ryunosuke:(Only if you rein in that crazy headband and control the cold stares first...)Auchi:Witness. State your name and occupation for the court, please.Hosonaga:Of course. My name is Satoru Hosonaga. I am the head waiter at a Western-style restaurant called 'La Carneval'. Ahem! ...Ahem!Ryunosuke:Um...are you alright? You seem to be coughing up some, er...Hosonaga:It's a regular occurrence. It really doesn't bother me.Ryunosuke:(Well, it really, really should...)Auchi:As everyone knows, the capital's south-eastern quarter was developed for foreign visitors some years ago. It's become a very fashionable district now, full of hotels to accommodate overseas guests. This grim crime occurred in one of the district's so-called 'restaurants' - an occidental eatery - three days ago.Judge:Understood. Hosonaga-san, you will kindly tell the court everything you can about the incident.Hosonaga:At once, sir.Auchi:And no petty interjections from the aspiring lawyer boy, please.Ryunosuke:Oh, um... (Perspiring, maybe, but aspiring...?)Hosonaga:It was just after 2 p.m. on the day in question. We have few diners at that time of day. The lunchtime rush was over, and there were only three tables still occupied.Ryunosuke:(That fits in with my memory of it, too. There was hardly anyone else in the place.)Hosonaga:Ahem! ...Ahem! It was when I was in the kitchen, putting away crockery and cutlery... A gunshot rang out, so I hurried out to the dining area to see what had happened. I found the victim - an English gentleman - slumped in his chair. And standing immediately beside him, gun in hand, was the accused university student.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:Hold on! Let me just clarify something here! While I did pick up a gun that I found lying on the floor beside the professor, I... I didn't shoot him!Auchi:Auchi:I believe I asked you to refrain from petty interjections. The court wishes to listen to the witness's report of what he saw, you amateur!Ryunosuke:But...Judge:The next time you interrupt at an inappropriate time, you will be penalised, Defendant Naruhodo.Kazuma:Don't worry, Ryunosuke. You'll have your chance to fight back. For now, we must just quietly listen to the witness.Ryunosuke:Ugh...Auchi:If I may confirm one point, waiter... Standing beside the victim with a gun in his hand was the same man we see here in court today?Hosonaga:Yes. Without question.Auchi:I see. And apart from the accused, was there anyone else standing beside the victim?Hosonaga:No. There was no one else around that table but the deceased Englishman and the university student.Ryunosuke:Huh? (Wait, what did he just say? 'There was no one else around that table'?)Kazuma:What's the matter, Ryunosuke?Ryunosuke:That's... That's just not right! When I went over to Dr Wilson to say hello... ...there was a woman sitting opposite him at his table!Kazuma:Really?Ryunosuke:And that's not something the waiter could have missed! (I've been warned about interjecting, but still... What should I do?)InterjectRyunosuke:Leads to:\"Just a moment, please!\"Wait and seeRyunosuke:(I desperately want to say something, but I was told not to interject.)Kazuma:Ryunosuke... If your parents tell you to study, you're the kind of man who would diligently get to work, aren't you?Ryunosuke:I, I suppose I am. I'd never have got into Yumei University otherwise.Kazuma:But you can't just always follow the rules in life, you know. If you don't say what you want to say right now, you'll seriously regret it when you're found guilty.Ryunosuke:...Alright, you've scared me. I won't forget that piece of advice in a hurry! (And there IS something I want to say. I'm just going to shut my eyes and say it!)Ryunosuke:Leads to:\"Just a moment, please!\"Ryunosuke:Just a moment, please! Dr Wilson wasn't alone that day! I'm sure of it. There was a lady sitting with him at the same table!Auchi:Auchi:Dear me, dear me. What are we going to do with you? With your blatant disregard for court proceedings, I'm beginning to wonder if you're not a fraud. Could it be that the accused - this mere student - is not a real lawyer after all?Ryunosuke:But...I'm sure of what I saw!Kazuma:Hosonaga-san, is there any chance you're mistaken? Perhaps your memory of events is hazy?Hosonaga:......... No. The deceased gentleman came to dine alone.Ryunosuke:I, I don't believe it...Hosonaga:Ahem! ...Ahem! I actually have a rough plan of the restaurant as it was that day. Please, have a look if you'd like to.Judge:Let me see... Ah, a sketch of the establishment's layout drawn by yourself, I presume?Hosonaga:That's right. I'm afraid I used the back of my business card. It was a...turbulent situation. However, as you can see, the gentleman in question was seated alone.Judge:Well, you're clearly a very conscientious waiter.Hosonaga:Thank you, sir.Judge:The court will take this plan and add it to the Court Record as evidence.Hosonaga:Oh, um... Well...Judge:Is there a problem? Hand the plan to the court officer at once!Hosonaga:Um...of course. Here you are.Kazuma:What was that about? He's been completely calm and collected until now.Ryunosuke:(Something certainly seems to have shaken him...)The waiter's business card has been entered into the Court Record.Auchi:So...the court has now heard a precis of the case.Judge:Yes, at the moment the gunshot was heard in the restaurant... ...the only person in close proximity to the victim was the defendant on trial today. It would seem we are looking at a black-and-white case here.Kazuma:...!Judge:Defendant Naruhodo...Ryunosuke:Yes, Your Excellency?Judge:If you admit your guilt at this stage, the court is willing to look mercifully upon you.Auchi:In other words, you may have some small reprieve in terms of your inevitable punishment. I called this waiter as an unsworn witness in order to explain the details of the case to the court. But I must warn the defence, if you are determined to pursue matters further in this trial... ...the prosecution has decisive evidence from sworn witnesses who were present at the scene of the crime.Ryunosuke:......... What do you think I should do, Kazuma?Kazuma:What do you mean?Ryunosuke:Well, I'm going to be found guilty one way or another, it seems. Wouldn't it be sensible to plead guilty at this stage and hope for a more lenient sentence?Kazuma:.........Ryunosuke:Everyone keeps telling me that this trial is unusual - about these...'peculiarities'. You've said it, Professor Mikotoba's said it...and so has the judge and the prosecution. I'm... I'm scared of what lies ahead if I push this.Kazuma:......... As I said from the outset, I believe you're innocent. I trust you. And yet, despite knowing that... ...you're willing now to throw that trust back in my face? Is that it?Ryunosuke:What?Kazuma:If the accused is in fact innocent... ...then a defence lawyer is duty-bound to prove that innocence by whatever means necessary. Are you just going to abandon that duty? Are you going to give up on yourself? The battle hasn't even begun yet, Ryunosuke.Ryunosuke:...!Kazuma:The defence pleads not guilty, Your Excellency! We invite the prosecution to stop making empty threats and bring out its witnesses. Then we'll see just how decisive this evidence really is!Judge:Indeed. Prosecutor Auchi, please continue with proceedings.Auchi:Tsk, well, you were warned. The young can be so reckless. You know, many call me a saint. But I can be a devil when I want to be.Ryunosuke:Ugh...Auchi:In a few short moments from now... ...that dumbstruck young mouth of yours will be silenced, forever! The prosecution calls its next witnesses!Judge:Very well. Officer! Bring forth the witnesses at once!Auchi:Witnesses, kindly state your names and occupations for the court.Nosa:Yessir! The great Nippon Imperial Army's Sergeant Iyesa Nosa reporting for duty, sir!Korekuta:Myself, I find employ as a purveyor of fine articles of antiquity from the efflorescence of our nation, Nippon... ...and conduct my trade from Rasu-tei, a humble premises in the second district. Kyurio Korekuta, at your service.Judge:An antique dealer and a soldier... What an unusual pairing!Auchi:Both of these gentlemen were present at the restaurant on the day in question.Kazuma:They must be the diners at the other table that the waiter mentioned.Korekuta:Myself, I habitually take tea of the most exquisite aroma at the establishment in question. Always post noon. And, not infrequently, converse with interested parties regarding the curios with which I make my business.Ryunosuke:(I can't understand a word that old man is saying...)Kazuma:He's an antique dealer. And it sounds like he's a regular at La Carneval. He seeks out potential customers who may have an interest in antiques and tries to sell his wares to them. He obviously targets La Carneval because it's a high-class restaurant with rich clientele.Ryunosuke:Right, I see. Although, to be honest... ...that sergeant looks more like he'd be a seller rather than a buyer.Auchi:Now, you both witnessed the precise moment of this most atrocious incident. Is that correct?Nosa:Affirmative! The enemy unit was seen attacking the foreigner in what can only be described as an act of war! Sir! It was that black-uniformed rogue infantryman over there who unloaded his firearm, sir!Ryunosuke:(This man's as impossible to understand as the other... But I'm almost sure I heard a strange noise during that last thing he said...)Kazuma:So, this is the decisive evidence the prosecution was threatening. The soldier is claiming that he actually saw the precise moment you shot the victim dead.Ryunosuke:Yes...Kazuma:Well? Are you starting to feel uncomfortable?Ryunosuke:If I'm honest...I was feeling uncomfortable from the start.Judge:Now, the court will hear your formal testimony, please. You will state everything you saw at the precise moment that the incident occurred.Nosa:Sir, yessir! Standing by ready to report, sir!Korekuta:Hm... Unsavoury memories of a most acerbic afternoon...Witness Testimony- What the Witnesses Saw -Nosa:I was ingesting a regulation beef steak at the restaurant while having a tactical discussion with the old man.Korekuta:Myself, I was extolling the virtues of a particularly fine golden curio to the military gentleman.Nosa:At that precise moment, a firearm was discharged! I observed the enemy's actions with my own eyes!The black-uniformed varsity cadet fired on the English civilian! And from the back, the cowardly little weasel!Korekuta:I was on my hands and knees, investigating the where-abouts of my mysteriously absconded precious curio.Judge:Well! So you, Sergeant Nosa, actually witnessed the vital moment! You saw the split second when the defendant fired the weapon at the victim.Nosa:Yessir! Affirmative, sir! That wicked university cadet, sir! The cruel and unforgivable enemy!Korekuta:What times we live in, when an English gentleman may be assailed in the broad light of day...Ryunosuke:But, but this is ridiculous! I didn't shoot anyone!Kazuma:Is that really true, Ryunosuke?Ryunosuke:Yes! All I did was pick up the gun that I saw lying on the floor! After I'd said hello to Dr Wilson, I went back to my table and sat drinking more coffee. Then, when I'd finished, I got up from my seat to leave the restaurant... ...when I noticed an English-made gun next to the chair where the professor was sitting. I thought perhaps the professor had dropped it. So I bent down, and just as I was picking it up...*BANG!*Kazuma:Well, if that's the truth, there was obviously a criminal on the scene somewhere. And somewhere in these two witnesses' testimonies, there's a clue as to who that criminal was.Ryunosuke:There is?Kazuma:Ryunosuke! You must exercise your right to cross-examine the witnesses!Ryunosuke:Cross-examine?Kazuma:Do it now!Auchi:As we have heard, Your Excellency... ...there is no room for doubt in the testimony of these witnesses. The defendant is clearly guilty. It is time to bring this despicable student to justice!Judge:Certainly, the testimony the court has just heard eliminates any vestige of doubt. Therefore, it is my grave duty to declare the verdict of this tri-Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:.........Judge:What in the name of the Emperor is the meaning of this outburst?!Ryunosuke:I, am, erm... I mean, the defence... ...demands its right to a cross-examination!Auchi:Dear me, dear me. Let me guess? 'The hachimaki headband boy next door told me to do it.' How pathetic.Ryunosuke:Huh? (How did he know?)Auchi:The prosecution objects! This is a clear waste of time. The defendant obviously has no experience. How can he possibly carry out a cross-examination?Kazuma:Kazuma:The defence is asserting its RIGHT to a cross-examination! Whether or not you think he's capable of it is irrelevant.Auchi:*Gulp!*Ryunosuke:(Kazuma is so commanding!)Judge:Very well. Let the defence conduct a cross-examination of the witnesses.Kazuma:Alright, this is where the battle really begins, Ryunosuke!Ryunosuke:But...I don't even know what I have to do in a cross-examination!Kazuma:Isn't it obvious? You have to expose the lies in the witnesses' statements!Ryunosuke:How?Kazuma:You didn't fire the gun, which means what that soldier said has to be a lie.Ryunosuke:Well yes, but...Kazuma:It's just a case of proving it. And the key to doing that is evidence.Ryunosuke:Right... Evidence...Kazuma:All you need to do is present some decisive and indisputable evidence that proves the witness is lying. Now let's go, Ryunosuke! Don't let them beat you!Ryunosuke:Alright then! (It's all or nothing...)Cross-Examination- What the Witnesses Saw -",

Is this some new interrogation technique?!Ryunosuke:I...hadn't actually thought of what I wanted to ask...Kazuma:Just ask about anything that catches your attention. Anything that bothers you.Ryunosuke:Alright then, um... This 'beef steak' you mentioned. What kind of food is that?Nosa:Teeen-shun!Ryunosuke:Agh!Nosa:Beef steak is a delicious cut of veal, vigorously cooked on a cast-iron grill and served piping hot. Ryunosuke:Oh...Nosa:If food could receive medals of honor, beef steak would be almost as highly decorated as a cutlet!Ryunosuke:Right! I see. Um, thank you, sir. So, next question... ......... This 'cutlet' you mentioned. What kind of food is that?Nosa:Teeen-shun!Ryunosuke:Agh!Nosa:Cutlet is a delicious cut of veal tossed in breadcrumbs and deep fried in cooking oil! Accept your guilty verdict, atone for your crimes, and when you're released from prison, TRY IT!Ryunosuke:Yessir, I will, sir! On the double, sir!Kazuma:Sorry to interrupt, but... How about trying to stick to questions that are relevant to the case?Ryunosuke:Oops, sorry! I'll do my best. So, next question... Is it just me, or do you keep hearing a sort of 'wah' crying noise...?Nosa:Negative!Ryunosuke:Well, at least we've learnt that he's a big beef lover. Kazuma:...Affirmative.Ryunosuke:(It's not easy knowing what questions to ask...)Korekuta:Myself, I was extolling the virtues of a particularly fine golden curio to the military gentleman.PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:I have no idea what you're talking about!Korekuta:A koban, boy.Ryunosuke:A 'koban'? You mean an old Edo coin?Korekuta:The day prior to the incident, a treasure of exceptional value from the Hoei period entered my possession. I took myself to the restaurant the following day, with said item secreted in my bosom pocket... ...in the hope of an affluent cognoscente appraised of its indisputable value being present. Ryunosuke:So...you were hoping to sell your koban coin? To Sergeant Nosa, whom you met at the restaurant?Auchi:Yes, yes. It's quite clear where you're going with this, boy. You were about to assert that a penniless soldier would have no hope of purchasing a precious koban. Isn't that so?Ryunosuke:Um... Well...Nosa:You little upstart cadet! You want to add disrespecting a superior officer to your list of crimes, do you?! Blatant subordination! Ryunosuke:No, no, I didn't say anything! (Although 'penniless' might be just the word I was looking for...)Korekuta:In any case, the hour was already advanced beyond that of the midday luncheon. There remained precious few present with whom I could engage in discourse about matters of business. The gentleman aside me, who was grappling with his braised veal at the time, was my sole prospect.Ryunosuke:I see...Nosa:At that precise moment, a firearm was discharged! I observed the enemy's actions with my own eyes!PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:So...you're saying that you actually saw me at that time?Nosa:Aaaaaaffirmative! I saw you! Laughing - cackling - like a madman as you trained the barrel of your gun on the English civilian! Ryunosuke:But that's impossible! I, I only-Kazuma:Allow me to confirm just one point, please.Nosa:What's that, private?Kazuma:Thinking carefully about the statement you just made, it seems to me... ...that it must have been just after you heard the gunshot that you looked over to the victim's table.Nosa:And so what if it was?Kazuma:Well, if that really is the case... ...it would mean that you didn't in fact see the precise moment when the killer actually fired the gun.Nosa:......... Argh! And double 'argh'! My sixth sense...Ryunosuke:Sorry?Nosa:My sixth sense of danger! I picked up the waves of murderous energy radiating from your foul mind! Which means...a split second before you pulled the trigger, I was looking right at you, cadet!Ryunosuke:Surely that's not really possible...is it?Nosa:Do you think I'd have got where I am today in the army if I couldn't sense danger in the air, son?Kazuma:Well... It would seem this soldier is absolutely convinced that he saw you do the deed.Ryunosuke:(This is not good...)Nosa:The black-uniformed varsity cadet fired on the English civilian! And from the back, the cowardly little weasel!PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:Erm... So this 'black-uniformed university cadet'... You're saying that was-Nosa:Argh! I've had just about enough of your sauce, cadet! Who else do you see around here in black uniform, hm?Ryunosuke:(Well, there's someone standing right next to me who fits the description as well, but...)Nosa:It was you, you little weasel! You unloaded the firearm on that man! From behind his back! And you call yourself a citizen of the great Empire of Nippon?! You disgust me!Ryunosuke:.........Kazuma:What is it, Ryunosuke?Ryunosuke:I'm, I'm not quite sure... It's something that the sergeant just said, but I can't put my finger on it. Something's playing on my mind...Kazuma:In that case, check back over the details of the evidence you've gathered in the Court Record. And if you find an inconsistency there with what the witness just said, then...don't hold back! Present the evidence to the court! Thrust it in the witness's face and make him choke on it!Present Post-Mortem ReportRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:.........Nosa:.........Auchi:.........Judge:.........Nosa:What, what are you playing at, cadet? What is the meaning of this subordination?! Thrusting this wad of papers in my moustache!Ryunosuke:In... Inconsistency! Sir! I mean...yes! There's a clear inconsistency here!Auchi:Tsk, what nonsense! What can this document possibly tell us that we don't already know?!Ryunosuke:Well...obviously... That, um... (I know what I want to say, but the words just won't come out of my mouth!)Auchi:Hmph! I think this proves beyond any doubt, Your Excellency... ...that there is no place for an amateur student here in this grand courtroom!Judge:Hmmm...Ryunosuke:Argh! (This is so frustrating!)Kazuma:Oh, please. Surely this doesn't require an explanation. It couldn't be more plain. To spell it out would be an insult to the court.Ryunosuke:Kazuma, what...?Auchi:What are you talking about?Kazuma:It's apparent from a single glance at the post-mortem report presented by the defence... ...that there's a clear discrepancy here with the sergeant's statement!Auchi:What?Kazuma:Sergeant Iyesa Nosa...Nosa:Yessir, what, sir?Kazuma:The statement you just made was this: 'The black-uniformed varsity cadet fired on the English civilian! And from the back, the cowardly little weasel!' Nosa:Yessir! Affirmative, sir! I witnessed the crime with my own military-grade eyes, sir!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:But no! That just can't be!Nosa:And why not, cadet?!Ryunosuke:Because... Because... Because...! Kazuma:As is clearly stated in the post-mortem report... 'Fatal haemorrhage from pectoral ballistic trauma. No exit wound. Bullet did not pass through the body.' The photographic print of the victim clearly shows the same thing.Leads to:\"The victim, Dr Wilson, died from a bullet wound to the chest.\"Present Photograph of VictimRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:.........Nosa:.........Auchi:.........Judge:.........Nosa:What, what are you playing at, cadet? What is the meaning of this subordination?! Thrusting some photographic print in my moustache!Ryunosuke:In... Inconsistency! Sir! I mean...yes! There's a clear inconsistency here!Auchi:Tsk, what nonsense! What can this print possibly tell us that we don't already know?!Ryunosuke:Well...obviously... That, um... (I know what I want to say, but the words just won't come out of my mouth!)Auchi:Hmph! I think this proves beyond any doubt, Your Excellency... ...that there is no place for an amateur student here in this grand courtroom!Judge:Hmmm...Ryunosuke:Argh! (This is so frustrating!)Kazuma:Oh, please. Surely this doesn't require an explanation. It couldn't be more plain. To spell it out would be an insult to the court.Ryunosuke:Kazuma, what...?Auchi:What are you talking about?Kazuma:It's apparent from a single glance at the photographic print presented by the defence... ...that there's a clear discrepancy here with the sergeant's statement!Auchi:What?Kazuma:Sergeant Iyesa Nosa...Nosa:Yessir, what, sir?Kazuma:The statement you just made was this: 'The black-uniformed varsity cadet fired on the English civilian! And from the back, the cowardly little weasel!' Nosa:Yessir! Affirmative, sir! I witnessed the crime with my own military-grade eyes, sir!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:But no! That just can't be!Nosa:And why not, cadet?!Ryunosuke:Because... Because... Because...! Kazuma:Take a close look at the print.Leads to:\"The victim, Dr Wilson, died from a bullet wound to the chest.\"Korekuta:I was on my hands and knees, investigating the where-abouts of my mysteriously absconded precious curio.PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:'On your hands and knees'? Erm, could you explain that, please?Korekuta:That's right. Spurning the arthritis, I was, in order to retrieve the lost piece.Kazuma:What 'lost piece' are you referring to?Korekuta:The koban, of course! The exquisite Hoei-era koban coin! I had just been showing the rare treasure to the military man as he masticated his meal. After averting my eyes for the briefest of moments...it was there no more! It simply vanished!Auchi:The koban... vanished?Korekuta:Hence I began to acquaint myself with the intricacies of the floor, in order to locate it. And then it happened.Kazuma:You heard the gunshot, you mean?Korekuta:None other than! Though it was no concern of mine. I was frantically scouring the floor for the aforementioned lost treasure!Ryunosuke:So, in fact... ...you didn't actually witness the precise moment when the incident occurred?Korekuta:Indeed. Myself, I did not.Ryunosuke:(Ugh... I have no idea what I'm supposed to do here!)Kazuma:Listen, Ryunosuke... We know there are lies lurking in these statements. It's time to expose them.Ryunosuke:I understand that. The question is...how?Kazuma:Like I said before, the key to this is using evidence that you've collected. You can examine and Present evidence while a witness is giving testimony by pressing [R / RB / E]. Go through each witness statement and the details about each piece of evidence, and compare all the facts. Somewhere in there, you'll find something that doesn't add up. In other words, an inconsistency.Ryunosuke:An inconsistency...Kazuma:When you find a statement and a piece of evidence that seem to contradict each other... ...Present your evidence with [X / Y / R], and rip the witness apart!Ryunosuke:...!Kazuma:Just be careful, because if you assert a contradiction that has no basis, you'll be given a penalty. If you're dealt too many penalties, the defence's case will fall apart, and you'll receive a guilty verdict. So that's it. Peruse the evidence in the Court Record and find an inconsistency with a witness's statement.Ryunosuke:Alright, I'll give it a try!Kazuma:You can hear the witnesses' statements over and over again, as many times as you like. So keep your head, and be measured in your attack. Good luck...partner!Kazuma:The victim, Dr Wilson, died from a bullet wound to the chest.Nosa:Ah...Kazuma:Sergeant. According to your witness statement... ...the culprit shot the victim from behind. And that is the obvious discrepancy here. Well? How do you explain it?Nosa:Ooh...erm... Agh...um... Well, er... Hnn... Hnn...Ryunosuke:(What...the...? What was that? Something just popped up from behind his back but he pushed it down again...)Judge:Certainly, there is a clear discrepancy with the facts here. Would you not agree, Sergeant Nosa?Nosa:......... Yes, sir... At this juncture, that...would appear to be indisputable. Until the moment I heard the firearm discharge, my eyes were... ...firmly fixed on the delicious La Carneval steak! Sir!Auchi:WHAT?!Kazuma:The last testimony the court heard has proven one thing beyond all reasonable doubt. The witness, Sergeant Iyesa Nosa... ...did NOT see the defendant firing a gun at all!Auchi:Ugh... That's, that's absurd...Kazuma:I think the conclusion we must draw is simple... There is no place for an amateur prosecutor here in this grand courtroom!Auchi:Kgnrk... KYAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!Ryunosuke:(There's been a complete turnabout in the mood of this trial...just from that one discrepancy. So this is what being an ace attorney is all about!)Nosa:But... But I definitely saw him! That university cadet, there! He was pointing the firearm directly at the victim's back!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:But I never fired the gun! All I did was pick it up off the floor!Judge:Hmmm... And you, old man. You didn't see the moment the victim was shot, either?Korekuta:......... Myself, I have already been quite clear. The gunshot interested me not. I was far too busy on the floor.If fifth statement was pressed during previous cross-examinationRyunosuke:Oh, yes. You were looking for your koban coin, weren't you? Korekuta:Indeed! The prized Hoei-era koban! Leads to:\"Hunting around under the table, I was, in case mayhap it had fallen there.\"If fifth statement was not pressed during previous cross-examinationRyunosuke:'Too busy on the floor'? Sorry, what were you doing?Korekuta:Hunting for treasure.Kazuma:Treasure?Korekuta:Indeed! The Hoei-era koban! My prized coin! On each occasion when I visit that restaurant... ...it is my habitude to place in my bosom pocket a particular trinket of interest from my shop, Rasu-tei. Ryunosuke:In the hope of meeting a rich diner who might like to buy it from you?Korekuta:On the day under scrutiny, it was to the military man that I proffered my Hoei treasure. Believe that he would purchase such a rare find, I did not. But I was presented with little alternative. And then... After averting my eyes for the briefest of moments...it was there no more! It simply vanished!Auchi:The koban...vanished?Leads to:\"Hunting around under the table, I was, in case mayhap it had fallen there.\"Korekuta:Hunting around under the table, I was, in case mayhap it had fallen there. ...And then it happened.Kazuma:You heard the gunshot, you mean?Korekuta:Indeed I did! But I heeded it not, for I was concerned only with finding my absconded Hoei treasure! NOTHING could distract me!Kazuma:Out of interest... ...did you find the coin in the end?Korekuta:......... No.Kazuma:Hm. I see.Korekuta:That lamentable day...the precious Hoei koban was lost to me. No doubt some unscrupulous scoundrel pocketed the prize coin for himself!Nosa:.........Judge:As I am sure everyone present is aware... ...this case demands a swift and decisive resolution. Our government has promised to send a full report to Great Britain by telegraph this very afternoon.Kazuma:Nevertheless! The witness testimony the court has just heard was inconclusive. No matter how subservient our government feels it must be to the British... ...it would be unforgivable to deliver a verdict on this trial right now!Judge:Hmmm... What is your position, Prosecutor Auchi?Auchi:Tsh huh huh! Worry not, Your Excellency. The defendant may have fled a tiger at the front gate, but he will find a wolf at the back.Ryunosuke:...!Auchi:My witnesses have further testimony to make.Judge:Explain.Auchi:Upon hearing their next statements, it will become abundantly clear... ...that there is only one person who could possibly have committed this despicable crime. The equally despicable defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo!Ryunosuke:WHAT?!Kazuma:He really seems to have a despicable opinion of you, doesn't he?Ryunosuke:Ugh...Judge:Very well, the court invites the witnesses to testify again. You will thoroughly explain the reasoning behind the prosecution's allegation. Is that clear?Korekuta:As clear as kiriko glass, Your Excellency.Nosa:Yessir, at once, sir! Awaiting signal to testify, sir!Ryunosuke:Um, excuse me, but there's something - or someone - peeking out over your shoulder, I think...Nosa:Affirmative! The newest member of the Nosa family to rise up through the ranks, sir. Name: Aido.Kazuma:Hm, it would seem those straps are a sign of the sergeant being too strapped to afford a nanny.Nosa:Aido... Teeen-shun! Your father is about to quell the enemy! Watch and learn, my boy!Witness Testimony- The True Culprit -Nosa:Even if what I saw wasn't the precise moment the firearm was discharged, it's almost the same thing!Korekuta:Yes, pointing his gun at the foreign man, he was, that young lad in black. That much I myself did see.Nosa:Furthermore! A visual search of the premises at the time confirmed that we were the only personnel present.Korekuta:Indeed. Alone, he was, the Englishman. Dining all by himself.Nosa:Therefore! No one other than the black-uniformed cadet could have dispatched the Englishman. Over and out!Judge:Hm, these testimonies are certainly...compelling.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:Wait! That's...that's nonsense! The victim - Dr Wilson - wasn't alone at all!Auchi:Please! Enough of these outbursts already!Ryunosuke:But there was a woman! There was a young woman at his table! You must have seen her! Everyone there must have seen her!Auchi:Auchi:If you call yourself a lawyer, then you will respect the rules of the court and speak accordingly! We are not here to listen to your fantasies!Ryunosuke:Ugh...Auchi:It is evident beyond all reasonable doubt that the victim was alone at the time of the incident. The prosecution has photographic evidence of this fact.Judge:Is this a photographic print of the scene of the crime, Counsel?Auchi:Indeed. Of the table at which the victim was dining, taken by an investigator immediately after the incident. As can plainly be seen, there is only one place set.Judge:Certainly, based on the appearance of this print... ...it would be reasonable to conclude that the victim was not in the company of anyone else.Ryunosuke:Arg... (This doesn't make any sense...)Judge:The court will add this new photographic evidence to the record.The photographic print of the crime scene has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke:I don't understand... (What's going on here? It's just not possible that nobody else saw that woman.)Kazuma:The waiter before said the same thing. He maintains that Dr Wilson came to the restaurant alone as well.Ryunosuke:But that's not true! I...I saw her...! I swear that I saw a woman with him...Kazuma:.........Judge:It would seem that we'll be able to telegraph the report to Great Britain on time after all. The witness testimonies we have just heard leave no further room for doubt.Auchi:These are very sensitive political times, as we all know. The ink is still fresh on the treaty with Great Britain. To think that I, Taketsuchi Auchi, will have contributed to the amity of these two great empires is an honour.Ryunosuke:......... (How can this be happening? The judge is ready to rule!)???:Stand tall, Ryunosuke. It's not over yet.Ryunosuke:What?Kazuma:If what you say is true, then there's something going on here behind the scenes. And now is your chance to expose it. To draw out the truth. ...In your cross-examination.Ryunosuke:I, I don't know, Kazuma...Judge:The defence is entitled to cross-examine the witnesses. But make it quick. Understood?Auchi:Tsk. Rules can be so unbending at times.Ryunosuke:Ugh...Cross-Examination - The True Culprit -",

For a start, I didn't fire that gun!Nosa:We have a difference of opinion on that. The opinion of a uniformed officer versus that of a fledgling cadet.Ryunosuke:Um, I don't think so...Auchi:Consider this, Defendant... Just a moment ago, I blinked.Ryunosuke:Um, did you?Auchi:Did you see it? Did you see me blink?Ryunosuke:How could I!Auchi:And yet! It is an undeniable fact that I did blink! So there you have it.Ryunosuke:Er... Have what...?Nosa:Teeen-shun! The sound of the firearm rang in my ears, and the very next moment... ...I saw YOU waving the gun at the Englishman!Auchi:I think that says it all...don't you?Ryunosuke:Grrr...Auchi:And let us not forget that the antiques dealer witnessed the accused in this most incriminating position as well. Isn't that so, Korekuta-san?Korekuta:.........Korekuta:Yes, pointing his gun at the foreign man, he was, that young lad in black. That much I myself did see.PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:Yes, it may be true that I was holding the gun at that point in time... But I've told you already! That's only because I'd picked it up off the floor!Auchi:Well obviously, as the culprit, that's the only way you could explain it away.Ryunosuke:I had just finished drinking my coffee, and I was about to leave the restaurant when... I noticed a gun on the floor at Dr Wilson's feet, so I picked it up. And at exactly that moment...*BANG!*Ryunosuke:A gunshot rang in my ears.Korekuta:Hmph. Full of events beyond our control, life is.Ryunosuke:Sorry? What do you mean?Korekuta:In your case, you found a pistol on the floor and picked it up, which precipitated this testing predicament. Whereas conversely... ...I failed to pick up the koban from the floor, and find myself in an equally testing predicament as a result. Ryunosuke:.........Korekuta:Anyway, the fact remains... Myself, I did see you. With pistol in hand, standing over the foreigner.Nosa:Furthermore! A visual search of the premises at the time confirmed that we were the only personnel present.PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:You must have noticed someone else at Dr Wilson's table! There was a lady there!Auchi:Auchi:As you have been at pains to point out time and again. I feel I'm growing a callus in my ear! And yet, no one else appears to have caught even a glimpse of this woman!Ryunosuke:Argh... (If only there'd been more people dining there at the time! Then someone else would have noticed her.)Kazuma:Unfortunately, it was already past 2 p.m. when it happened. The quiet time between lunch and dinner in any restaurant.Ryunosuke:I know... Of course the place was almost empty. It's what you'd expect...Judge:Certainly, 2 p.m. is neither here nor there in terms of a time to eat. I wonder if there was a reason why the victim was eating at that time of day. And why he was alone. Auchi:Yes, Your Excellency, there was indeed a reason. Ryunosuke:There was?Auchi:This was found in the victim's jacket pocket.Judge:What is that, Counsel?Auchi:It is a medical report card, Your Excellency. It would seem that the victim had an appointment at a clinic prior to visiting the restaurant.Judge:Hm... Hotta Clinic? Yes, there would indeed appear to be an entry for the date in question. '19th November, Noon to past 1 p.m...'Kazuma:Hm, the very day of the incident. Auchi:So the victim went for a late lunch following his appointment. The explanation couldn't be more simple. The prosecution felt no need to submit this evidence before, as it really has no bearing on the case.Kazuma:I wonder... What do you think, Ryunosuke?Ryunosuke:Hm? Well, it is hard to see how it could be related, really.Kazuma:Remember, you can request for it to be entered into the Court Record as evidence if you think it could be useful. Ryunosuke:(Should I ask for Dr Wilson's medical report card to be submitted as evidence or not?)Ask for it to be submittedRyunosuke:Leads to:\"If I may, I'd like to ask for that medical report card to be submitted as evidence, Your Excellency.\"Better notRyunosuke:(I'm not sure I can really push for it to be submitted as evidence if I don't even know why it might be relevant. That wouldn't be good court etiquette, surely.)Kazuma:Don't tell me you're worrying about court etiquette at a time like this.Ryunosuke:But my father always brought me up to be respectful and polite.Kazuma:Right now we can't afford to overlook anything, no matter how insignificant it may seem to be. So let's ask for this medical report card to be added to the record. It won't be a problem...assuming you're polite.Ryunosuke:Alright, I'll do it! As politely as possible!Ryunosuke:Leads to:\"If I may, I'd like to ask for that medical report card to be submitted as evidence, Your Excellency.\"Ryunosuke:If I may, I'd like to ask for that medical report card to be submitted as evidence, Your Excellency.Auchi:On what grounds?Ryunosuke:Erm...Auchi:The court has already heard conclusive witness testimony. Additional evidence would be extraneous. Not to mention that the victim's movements prior to his arrival at the restaurant are of no concern. Kazuma:Kazuma:Whether or not they are of concern is up to us to decide! We have a right to explore all possible avenues.Auchi:I, I beg your pardon?Kazuma:You have no authority to refuse a perfectly valid request for the submission of evidence.Judge:Very well. The court will grant the defence's request.Auchi:Tsk! Youngsters these days are forever asserting their 'rights'! It's a most disturbing trend...Judge:Officer, kindly add the victim's medical report card to the Court Record.The victim's medical report card has been entered into the Court Record.Kazuma:What we need right now is new clues. We have to explore things from every possible angle, even if they don't seem relevant at first. Ryunosuke:Right, I hear you!Auchi:Hmph! You can conspire to prolong this trial as much as you like. But it's the day after the festival already for you! Or perhaps you'd forgotten...that these witness testimonies leave no room for doubt! Feel free to reiterate for the accused, Korekuta-san.Press (subsequent times)Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:You must have noticed someone else at Dr Wilson's table! There was a lady there!Auchi:Auchi:As you have been at pains to point out time and again. I feel I'm growing a callus in my ear!

The explanation couldn't be more simple.Korekuta:Indeed. Alone, he was, the Englishman. Dining all by himself.PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:So you...actually saw that with your own eyes, did you? The victim - Dr Wilson - dining alone.Korekuta:......... That I did. Forgive me for the position I place you in.Ryunosuke:.........Auchi:So the testimonies of the old man, the soldier, and the waiter all agree on that point. Isn't that interesting? And let us not forget...the incontestable evidence we have to support their statements as well. As can clearly be seen... ...there is only a single beef steak on the victim's table. A meal for one.Ryunosuke:No...Kazuma:......... The antiques dealer, the sergeant and the waiter who testified before... It's not impossible that they're all lying. But if so...then why?Ryunosuke:If I'm perfectly honest, I have absolutely no idea.Present Medical Report Card (after examining writing inside)Ryunosuke:Leads to:\"Um...erm...\"Nosa:Therefore! No one other than the black-uniformed cadet could have dispatched the Englishman. Over and out!PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:Why aren't you telling the truth?!Nosa:Wha...What did you say, cadet?!Ryunosuke:(I clearly remember... There was a woman sitting across the table from the professor.) Perhaps one of you might not have noticed... ...but for both of you to have failed to see the professor's dining companion? It's just not possible!.........Judge:Unfortunately for you, Defendant Naruhodo, it's not just a case of these two witnesses alone.Ryunosuke:Sorry...?Judge:The waiter, whose testimony the court heard earlier, clearly stated the same thing. He also said that the victim was alone.Ryunosuke:That's right...Auchi:Precisely! In other words... ...you are the sole proponent of this phantom lady!Ryunosuke:But, but I...Auchi:If such a woman were indeed present at the scene, the prosecution demands to see proof!Ryunosuke:.........Auchi:And if no such proof exists... ...the prosecution demands that no further mention of this phantom woman be made! It is a blatant waste of the court's time!Ryunosuke:(There's nothing I can say to that...)Kazuma:.........Auchi:Tsh huh huh huh huh!Before pressing third statementKazuma:What do you think, Ryunosuke?Ryunosuke:Ugh... Um... Ooh...Kazuma:What's the matter?Ryunosuke:I can't find anything. I can't find a clear discrepancy anywhere! I'm done for! I can't win this trial! No... No, no, nooooo...Kazuma:Listen. The first thing to do is calm down. You can't expect witness statements to be full of holes very time. So just take your time, and try to tease more information out of them first.Ryunosuke:What do you mean?Kazuma:You can choose to either 'Press' or 'Present' against each of the witness statements. If a witness is saying something you're suspicious about, Press him on it with [L / LB / Q]. With a little luck, you may get more details, which could prove to be crucial.Ryunosuke:Right, I see.Kazuma:The important point is, there's no sense in holding back. If anything even slightly jars with you, press the witnesses on it, and press them hard!Ryunosuke:Alright, got it! I'll press them like blocks of tofu! (The professor wasn't alone in the restaurant, I'm sure of it. And one way or another, this cross-examination is going to prove I'm right! It's time to 'Press' them for all they're worth! My fate depends on it!)After pressing third statementKazuma:Excellent work, Ryunosuke! We've gleaned some new information now.Ryunosuke:Well, yes... But I don't feel like it changes much. I can't see that it brings any real discrepancies to light.Kazuma:I wouldn't be so sure. Let me see that medical report card you got before.Ryunosuke:Oh, you mean this?Kazuma:Yes. This is a brand new piece of evidence... ...so perhaps we should examine it in a little more detail.Ryunosuke:How exactly?Kazuma:You'll notice that some pieces of evidence bear a magnifying glass. These are the ones you may Examine. Press [A / Space], and you can take a closer look at the piece in question. Use [right analog stick / arrow keys]... ...to rotate the evidence in all directions and examine it from all angles. By using [left analog stick / WASD]... ...you can move the crosshairs around to hunt for clues that may have been missed before. If the crosshairs start to pulsate... ...press [A / Space] to Investigate further. So, partner...I think you should take a closer look at this medical report card. See if there isn't something new to be learnt by examining it in more detail.Ryunosuke:Alright, I'll see what I can do! (I need to use [right analog stick / arrow keys], [left analog stick / WASD], and [A / Space]...to inspect any areas of the evidence that look suspicious...)Examine bottom of front pageRyunosuke:It says 'Hotta Clinic' on this medical report card. I hate clinics. Almost as much as I hate hospitals and surgeries.Kazuma:Aren't they all the same?Ryunosuke:When I was five, I caught the only cold I've ever had in my life. And I remember, even though I felt awful already, I had to have this hideous injection in my right arm. Brrr... I'll never forget it! Never in my whole life!Kazuma:Most people would give their right arm to have had only one cold in their whole life. Anyway, I don't think this is a clinic where they treat people for illnesses like that. Let's keep looking for clues. We don't want to miss anything.Examine bottom of back pageRyunosuke:It looks like this medical report card was first issued quite some time ago.Kazuma:It's probably a record of long-term treatment, that's why. With a family doctor, I imagine.Ryunosuke:Well I can't imagine. Going to a doctor, I mean. As long as I'm alive, I'm never consulting one!Kazuma:Well if you were dead, there'd be no point. ...So you don't like doctors, then?Ryunosuke:Why would you? They make you drink horrible-tasting medicine, they give you painful injections... ...and then they demand lots of money from you for the privilege...all when you're at your lowest ebb!Kazuma:......... You sound like a model patient. With a bad case of stubbornness no less, for which the only cure is very bitter medicine indeed.Examine upper left corner of back page, then writing insideKazuma:Let's have a look... This is some kind of medical history. ...Ah, and there's an entry for the day the professor was killed. 'Extraction of molar with topical anaesthesia'...Ryunosuke:'Extraction of molar'? You mean, he had a tooth taken out?Kazuma:It would seem so. Just before the incident, he'd had a bad tooth removed. Perhaps they used laughing gas. That's the most modern practice in the West for pain relief.Ryunosuke:Yes, I've heard of this 'anaesthesia'. (Although it's hard to believe there's anything that can actually stop you feeling pain.)Kazuma:Ah, there's a cautionary note from the medical practitioner as well. 'Strictly no food or drink besides water for three hours post-procedure, until anaesthetic effects have passed.'Ryunosuke:Really?Kazuma:Sounds like information worth bearing in mind.The medical report card's information has been updated in the Court Record.Ryunosuke:(With this new information... ...the meaning of that one particular statement totally changes!)Kazuma:So, I think it's time we listened to the testimony again, don't you?Ryunosuke:Definitely!Examine writing inside (subsequent times)Kazuma:This is clearly a record of some kind of medical treatment. And there's an entry for the day the professor was killed. 'Extraction with the use of anaesthesia'...Ryunosuke:'Extraction'? So he had a tooth out.Kazuma:Yes, it sounds like just before he went for lunch, Dr Wilson had to have a decayed tooth removed. They probably used laughing gas so he couldn't feel anything. It's the latest medical advancement in the West.Ryunosuke:Yes, I've heard people talking about this new idea of anaesthetic. (It's impossible to imagine not being able to feel pain, though.) Kazuma:There's a cautionary note at the end from whoever wrote this. It says: 'No food or drink other than water for three hours post-procedure while anaesthesia wears off.'After examining Medical Report CardKazuma:Well done, Ryunosuke! We have even more to go on now.Ryunosuke:I still don't feel like the situation has really changed, though. No discrepancies have come to light, and that's what we need.Kazuma:......... Oh, I think the situation has changed a great deal. We've come a long way.Ryunosuke:How so?Kazuma:Because we have just what we need. It's simply a case of using it to our advantage now.Ryunosuke:Then, do you mean... (...there IS a discrepancy somewhere?!)Kazuma:The crucial point is, the victim had been prohibited from consuming anything but water when he was shot. That fact has not yet been brought to the court's attention.Ryunosuke:(He's right... Thinking about Dr Wilson's circumstances at the time of the incident... ...puts that particular statement in a totally different light!)Kazuma:Always keep your eye on the progress of the battle. That's the only sure way to win.Examine evidenceUniversity Collar PinFront of pinRyunosuke:Ah, the symbol of Yumei University... Every student wears this pin with pride. It's funny, but most emblems seem to be either round or rectangular. I like this spiked design, even though it doesn't really make any sense. Although, it does cause problems. Lots of students end up cutting their fingers on their badges. Perhaps it was the idea of one of the founders. 'A sharp pin for a sharp mind' or something...?Back of pinRyunosuke:My personal student number is engraved on the back here. If you lose your pin, they won't accept you as a Yumei student at the university. 'Yu mei not come in!' they say. Of course, you can get a new pin made if you can just tell them your number. I've actually lost mine twice already, but I still don't know my student number by heart. I always say to myself, 'I mustn't forget to write it down somewhere.' But then I forget not to forget that...Waiter's Business CardFront of cardKazuma:This plan of the restaurant raises a number of questions, I think.Ryunosuke:Definitely!Kazuma:It's supposed to show the relative position of everything in the moments following the incident... ...but there's nothing to show the woman you say you saw there. Ryunosuke:Exactly! And that's not all! Look here in the upper left where it says 'kitchen'.Kazuma:Hm? Oh yes. What of it?Ryunosuke:No one would use those complicated characters to write 'kitchen'! Especially not if they were in a hurry!Kazuma:You mean you don't remember those characters yourself, don't you. Study harder, Ryunosuke!Back of cardKazuma:Well, that's unexpected.Ryunosuke:What is?Kazuma:Look, do you see it says the witness's name here? 'Satoru Hosonaga'...Ryunosuke:Well yes, business cards do tend to show the person's name. That's sort of the point.Kazuma:It's not the name that's unexpected. It's his job title.Ryunosuke:His job...? Oh! 'Chief Inspector Satoru Hosonaga, Primary Criminal Investigation Division, Imperial Police Bureau' Inspector? What on earth?!Kazuma:......... I have no idea. But let's face it, the police have a lot of power and influence. If they're wielding it somehow here...The waiter's business card information has been updated in the Court Record.Back of card (subsequent times)Ryunosuke:'Chief Inspector Satoru Hosonaga, Primary Criminal Investigation Division, Imperial Police Bureau'... So he isn't a waiter at all. He's a detective.Kazuma:And let's face it, the police have a lot of power and influence. If they're wielding it somehow here...Ryunosuke:Um...erm... Well, I think, um...Korekuta:About what are you wittering, lad? Call yourself a lawyer?!Ryunosuke:(I wish I could... But first and foremost here, I'm the accused.)Kazuma:Ryunosuke... Everyone stumbles on their words occasionally. Under the circumstances, I wouldn't worry about it.Ryunosuke:Thanks, Kazuma.Kazuma:I could see it quite clearly in that cross-examination you just carried out. When you raised your hand straight up like that, so purposefully... You knew exactly what it was you wanted to say.Ryunosuke:...!Kazuma:Don't feel like you have to choose your words carefully. Just say what you're thinking.Ryunosuke:......... Alright. ...And thanks for the advice. Korekuta-san, this is a medical report card belonging to the victim.Korekuta:Ah, I see... And...I don't see. What of it, boy?Ryunosuke:Comparing what is written on this report card with your witness statement... ...something clearly doesn't add up!Auchi:Auchi:Dear me, dear me. Have you forgotten my words so soon, you amateur?Ryunosuke:Sorry, what...?Auchi:You are not to interrupt court proceedings with your amateurish drivel!Ryunosuke:But...Auchi:Let's see if I can explain in words you might understand. It was after 2 p.m. in the afternoon when the victim was murdered at the restaurant. Whatever he may or may not have done before that time...is completely irrelevant.Ryunosuke:Grrr... But, but that's...um...Kazuma:Remember, Ryunosuke, you don't have to use clever language or fancy words. Just make your point.Auchi:Your Excellency, I believe we're finished here. There is surely no need to prolong this trial further.Judge:Hmmm...Auchi:The witness testimonies the court has heard have been clear and concise. This medical report card has no bearing on the matter at all. For the simple reason that... ...there is no one else besides this pale-faced pupil who could possibly have perpetrated the crime!Ryunosuke:This medical report card has nothing to do with the case? DO you really believe that?Auchi:Wha...? That outburst half petrified me, boy! Of course I believe it! How could it POSSIBLY be relevant?Ryunosuke:Perhaps because Hotta Clinic, which issued the report card...is a dental clinic!Auchi:A dental clinic? Is that supposed to mean something to me?Ryunosuke:Perhaps if I told you that the victim...had just had a tooth extracted...?Korekuta:...! What's this now...?Ryunosuke:And furthermore... ...if I told you that as a result, the victim had been forbidden from eating...Auchi:...!Korekuta:...!Nosa:...! Just, just what are you trying to say, cadet? He had orders not to eat? So what?Ryunosuke:It's all written up in here. 'No food or drink other than water for three hours post-procedure while anaesthesia wears off.'Auchi:WHAT?! No, that, that can't...Ryunosuke:Korekuta-san!Korekuta:What, boy? What?Ryunosuke:As you just heard... When he was killed, some time shortly after 2 p.m... ...the victim couldn't have been eating anything at all.Korekuta:No...Ryunosuke:Additionally...Nosa:There's more...?Ryunosuke:You have assured the court with unwavering self-confidence... ...that the victim was dining alone. But that cannot possibly be the case!Nosa:Grrr...Ryunosuke:Because the victim, as we now know... ...had just had one of his teeth extracted, and was still experiencing the effects of the anaesthetic!AAAAAAAAARGH!Kazuma:Expertly done...partner!Auchi:Auchi:What... What is this nonsense? You little upstart!Ryunosuke:.........Auchi:These are baseless accusations! Just, just look at this photographic evidence! You can clearly see the plate of food at the victim's table!Kazuma:Kazuma:Use your head. That's the very discrepancy we're talking about. Or can't you follow the logic?Auchi:How, how dare you?!Kazuma:I think it's fair to say that the 'tables' in this restaurant case...have turned. Wouldn't you agree, Ryunosuke?Ryunosuke:Hm? Yes! Most definitely!Judge:So having just undergone some dental surgery, the victim was unable to eat. Which leaves one very crucial conundrum... Who in fact was eating the pictured beef steak? The court will hear the opinion of the defence on this new puzzle. I assume you're ready, Counsel?Ryunosuke:.........'Counsel'? Oh! That, that means me, doesn't it!Kazuma:Alright, the answer to this question is going to be pivotal. This is the start of you turning this trial around! Show them what you're made of!Ryunosuke:Got it! So, um... The person eating the steak at the victim's table must have been...The victim himselfRyunosuke:The victim himself! Obviously!Judge:WHAT?!Kazuma:Ryunosuke, come on! Pull yourself together! The victim couldn't have been eating at the time. You just told the court that yourself!Ryunosuke:Oh yes! Haha, of course! I, I thought it didn't sound quite right...Kazuma:Look, you've even stunned the judge with that ludicrous answer.Ryunosuke:Alright then, I can use his state of shock to give me time to think...and come up with the right answer!Kazuma:I suggest you think it through more carefully, and try not to shock him in the first place.Ryunosuke:You're, you're right. Sorry. Um...Leads back to:\"The person eating the steak at the victim's table must have been...\"MeRyunosuke: Ryunosuke:I, I think it may have been me!Judge:WHAT?!Auchi:Auchi:It's not enough that you took the man's life, but you took his meal as well?! That's a bee sting on a crying face! Hmph, some people seem to think they can do whatever they like.Kazuma:And some people seem to think they can say whatever they like... Ryunosuke. Ryunosuke:Sorry, you're right! Of course I didn't eat it!Kazuma:The next time you make a quip like that, I'll make you eat your words. Then you'll be needing some dental surgery yourself. Ryunosuke:Al-Alright, I get the message... Um...Leads back to:\"The person eating the steak at the victim's table must have been...\"The two witnessesRyunosuke:I bet it was the sergeant and the antiques dealer, Nosa-san and Korekuta-san!Nosa:Argh!Ryunosuke:Agh!Nosa:Are you taking the cake, cadet?! You think I'd share rations with this decrepit greybeard?!Korekuta:Insult me by associating me with this brutish carnivore, would you?!Ryunosuke:You were both present at the scene. Neither of you can deny that you had the opportunity.Nosa:You addlebrained idiot! I had my own regulation beef steak set before me at my own table! And as any soldier worth his salt will tell you, you seize whatever rations are put in front of you! Judge:It would seem you may need to reconsider your answer, Counsel.Ryunosuke:Of, of course, Your Excellency! Erm...Leads back to:\"The person eating the steak at the victim's table must have been...\"An as-yet-unknown third partyLeads to:\"Obviously!\"Ryunosuke:Obviously! It can only have been someone else who was sitting at the professor's table!Auchi:Auchi:You will not let this go, will you? There was no such person!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:There was! Because I saw her!Kazuma:When the incident occurred, we know that the victim couldn't have been eating anything. Yet we have evidence of a half-eaten steak on his table! Therefore! The only logical conclusion is that there was somebody else there eating it.Auchi:Urgggghhhh...Kazuma:We have strong evidence to support our assertion. It's clear that these witness testimonies are unreliable. If the court decides to push through a ruling at this stage... ...we will lodge a formal complaint with the Ministry of Justice and pursue a fair retrial. Relentlessly.Ryunosuke:Kazuma...Auchi:Are you insane? You, you would take on the government?!Kazuma:Don't worry, Counsel, I have no issue with you.Auchi:What do you mean?Kazuma:I have issue with THEM! Those two witnesses in the stand!Korekuta:Wha...?Nosa:What are you talking about?Kazuma:We have demonstrated with evidence that the victim was not alone. So, if it now turns out that the two of you deliberately lied when giving your testimonies... ...obviously you will be charged with perjury.Nosa:Perjury...?Kazuma:And, since this is a murder trial... ...you will also be deemed complicit in the killing.Korekuta:Complicit...in m-murder...? N-N-N-NOOOOOOOOO!Nosa:Nosa:N-N-N-Negative! There, there was no mention of this at the tactical meeting! I was just following orders!Korekuta:That's right! As the man says! 'Just say you never saw the gentlewoman!' That's what...they, erm...told...us... .........Oh.Ryunosuke:(What?!) What did you just say, Korekuta-san?Korekuta:Oh, um... No...Ryunosuke:You were just 'following orders'?Korekuta:Now hold on, lad! I was, um...Kazuma:'Say you never saw the gentlewoman'?Nosa:Grrr...Kazuma:When you say 'gentlewoman', do you mean... ...you saw the victim with a lady from overseas?Ryunosuke:What?!Auchi:Auchi:What, what is the meaning of all this? These witnesses...gave false statements? Is this true, you pair?!Korekuta:.........Nosa:Just one... Just one simple slip of the tongue!!!Judge:Order! Order! Counsel, explain what is going on here!Kazuma:It's painfully clear now... You tried to prevent these witnesses from telling the truth!Auchi:Absolutely not! The prosecution knows nothing of this!Ryunosuke:Then who's behind this?! Who tried to make you keep your mouths shut?Korekuta:W-Well, um...Nosa:That's classified!Kazuma:So you're prepared to be tried as a conspirator to this murder, are you?Nosa:You, you wouldn't... This can't be happening!Kazuma:Ryunosuke... Judging from the way they're reacting to this... ...I'd say they were sworn to silence by someone with considerable influence. However... ...I don't believe Auchi had any idea about it.Ryunosuke:What are you saying? I mean, to wield that kind of influence... There are only a handful of possibilities! (It could only have been the government, the military or... Or the police, I suppose...)Kazuma:Well? Any ideas about who might be behind this? If we can affirm who tried to silence these witnesses, then we can continue our pursuit!Ryunosuke:(So we need to name whoever it was that tried to make the witnesses keep their mouths shut...)Kazuma:Of course, we'll need evidence before we make any firm accusations. Evidence that proves whoever it was really did wield his or her power here...Ryunosuke:But how? How can we possibly...?Kazuma:Remember how we made progress before?Ryunosuke:Before?Kazuma:We examined this piece of evidence in more detail and found a new clue as a result.Ryunosuke:Oh, yes, that's right.Kazuma:Well, that's not the only piece of evidence we have, is it? We need to re-examine everything, and make sure there's nothing we've missed. There's no time to lose!Judge:I want answers! If it's proven that these witnesses have been manipulated, I assure you, the penalty will be severe!Auchi:Please...wait... Your Excellency! I had no idea about any of this! I swear to every Shinto god! I knew nothing!Judge:And what does the defence have to say about all this? Hm?Ryunosuke:Erm, well, Your Excellency! (Ugh, no time to think... I'm just going to have to close my eyes and shout out the first name that comes into my head!) Besides the prosecution, the only person with the necessary influence to manipulate the witnesses is...Present Satoru Hosonaga profileRyunosuke:Leads to:\"Well, surely that would be...Satoru Hosonaga-san!\"Present anyone elseRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:There! What do you make of that?Judge:I think, Counsel, that you may want to close your ears as well as your eyes. Otherwise the sighs of disappointment in the courtroom may very well deafen you. Ryunosuke:Ah...Auchi:If you feel you must close your eyes in a crisis, might I suggest you keep your mouth shut next time, too? Otherwise, I may have to use the influence I have in this courtroom to shut it...permanently!Ryunosuke:(I don't know what it is about that prosecutor exactly, but he really makes me wince in pain sometimes...)Kazuma:I don't have a great deal of influence myself, but believe me... ...I can find other ways to make you keep your mouth shut as well.Ryunosuke:Alright, don't get angry... I'll think again. Kazuma:There must be a clue somewhere in all that evidence in the Court Record.Ryunosuke:(Actually, now that I think about it... ...there might be some pieces of evidence I haven't thoroughly examined yet.)Leads back to:\"And what does the defence have to say about all this?\"Ryunosuke:Well, surely that would be...Satoru Hosonaga-san!Judge:Hosonaga-san? The waiter who took the stand earlier?Auchi:Auchi:Poppycock! What possible reason would the waiter have to make these witnesses give false testimony? Not to mention the fact that even a head waiter could not possibly have that level of influence!Kazuma:For once, I would agree with you. If, that is, the man truly were a waiter.Auchi:Wha...? If he truly were..?Kazuma:Come on, Ryunosuke! Time to hit this court with the truth! The truth about Satoru Hosonaga-san's real identity, as proven by this evidence!Present Waiter's Business Card (after examining back of card)Ryunosuke: Leads to:\"The plan of the restaurant sketched by the man in question?\"Present anything elseRyunosuke: Judge:Hmph. I'm not sure what this is supposed to prove, Counsel.Auchi:I think, Your Excellency, that what this proves is not the true nature of the waiter... ...but the true nature of the accused.Ryunosuke:Sorry?Auchi:A blackguard, who would stoop to presenting irrelevant evidence to incriminate an innocent man. That is the true nature of this rookie!Ryunosuke:Waaagh!Kazuma:Try again. Go over all the evidence we have one more time. There's something in there that proves who this waiter really is, I'm sure of it!Ryunosuke:Al-Alright then. I'll try!Leads back to:\"Come on, Ryunosuke!\"Judge:The plan of the restaurant sketched by the man in question? Hm, I agree it shows a great deal of attention to detail, but I'm not sure we can conclude anything-Ryunosuke:Sorry, Your Excellency. That's the back of the card. It's the back...of the back of the card that's of interest.Judge:I...beg your pardon?Ryunosuke:Or, or perhaps I should have said, the front? Yes! It's the front of the back of the card! That's where the telling detail is!Judge:......... Would somebody please explain what this overexcited student is trying to say?Kazuma:Hosonaga-san sketched the plan of the restaurant on the reverse side of his business card. The front of that business card reveals the man in question's profession. His true profession.Judge:The waiter's profession? But that's surely... Good... Good gracious!Kazuma:That's right, Your Excellency. The card reads, 'Chief Inspector, Primary Criminal Investigation Division, Imperial Police Bureau'.Auchi:WHAT?! The, the waiter is...a police detective?! I, I haven't heard any mention of this before! Why haven't I heard any mention of this before?!Kazuma:The Imperial Police Bureau has immense power. Absolute power, as far as regular civilians are concerned. So, witnesses there in the stand...Nosa:...!Korekuta:...!Kazuma:Was it in fact the waiter who gave you your orders? Was it he who told you not to mention that you'd seen this foreign gentlewoman at the scene?Nosa:Erm, well...Korekuta:.........Hosonaga:Ryunosuke:In-Inspector Hosonaga...!Hosonaga:I was worried something like this may happen. The moment you asked me to submit my sketch as evidence, I realised it was a possibility.Judge:The court will take this plan and add it to the Court Record as evidence.Hosonaga:Oh, um... Well...Judge:Is there a problem? Hand the plan to the court officer at once!Hosonaga:Um...of course. Here you are.Ryunosuke:(Yes, I remember now... He did act strangely when the judge asked him to hand over his business card.)Hosonaga:I strive to carry out all investigations flawlessly. It's my guiding principle. But I let myself be distracted when I made that sketch. It was an unusually careless mistake.Auchi:So...you mean to say... You really are a detective?!Hosonaga:.........Ryunosuke:But why would a detective be working as a restaurant waiter? Ah! Of course! Your salary must be terrible!Hosonaga:I was working undercover.Ryunosuke:Undercover...?Hosonaga:Yes. There have been a series of incidents at the restaurant recently. In order to investigate, I decided to get a job there as a waiter, working undercover.Kazuma:Incidents at the restaurant? What kind of incidents?Hosonaga:That would be classified police information, which I am not at liberty to divulge. However, I can state categorically that they are unrelated to this case of homicide.Judge:Hmmm... Very well then, Inspector Hosonaga. But you will elaborate on one point for the court...Hosonaga:Of course, Your Excellency.Judge:We have just heard new information from the two witnesses beside you. That at the time of the shooting, there was in fact another person present at the victim's table.Hosonaga:.........Judge:If that is indeed true... ...clearly you would also have been aware of this person's presence, having served at the table in question. However, your testimony did not allude to this other diner. Therefore, I am led to assume... ...that in your professional capacity as a police officer, you required these witnesses to be in agreement. Would that be correct?Hosonaga:Ahem! ...Ahem! ......... Correct, Your Excellency.Ryunosuke:Unbelievable!Kazuma:Hm, as I suspected...Hosonaga:.........*BANG!*Hosonaga:As soon as I heard the gunshot, I ran out of the kitchen to see what had happened. The victim sat slumped in his chair, and beside him, gun in hand, stood the accused student. Sitting opposite the victim at the same table was a young lady whom I guessed to be an Englishwoman.Kazuma:So the truth comes out.Hosonaga:I immediately sealed off the restaurant and reported the incident to the bureau. It was then that I received some...special orders.Ryunosuke:Special orders? You mean to say...?Hosonaga:'Remove the Englishwoman from the scene at once.' ......... It was made clear that the Englishwoman's presence at the restaurant was to be concealed. Those were my orders.Ryunosuke:But! But what if this Englishwoman was the killer?Hosonaga:I think it would be in everyone's best interests not to pursue that idea.Ryunosuke:...!Hosonaga:The empire views the friendly terms of its relationship with Britain more highly than anything at the moment. An Englishman has been murdered on our soil. To name an Englishwoman as the primary suspect... Well, without irrefutable evidence, that would be completely out of the question.Kazuma:So that's the reason for the disappearance of the phantom woman in this case.Ryunosuke:But it's not right...!Hosonaga:.........Auchi:.........Judge:.........Kazuma:......... ...One possibility does spring to mind.Ryunosuke:What do you mean, Kazuma...?Kazuma:Yumei University is currently hosting a number of exchange students from Great Britain. And I'm fairly certain that one of them, studying in the medical faculty's research laboratory... ...is a young Englishwoman.Ryunosuke:What?Hosonaga:...You're a shrewd man. I can see why you're the chosen candidate for the overseas study tour.Ryunosuke:...! You mean...?Hosonaga:When I removed the woman from the scene of the crime... ...I thought it prudent to check her identity first.Judge:Then the court demands that you name the lady in question at once, Inspector!Hosonaga:The Englishwoman sitting at the university professor's table was a certain Miss Jezaille Brett. She is indeed a foreign student studying in the research laboratory of Yumei University's medical faculty.Auchi:Wha... What is happening heeeeeere?!Hosonaga:I admit that under orders from the police bureau, I erased all evidence of this lady's presence at the scene... ...and ordered these witnesses to make no mention of her in their testimonies. It must now be up to Your Excellency to decide how to deal with this situation.Judge:......... Very well. My thoughts on the matter are as follows... Thus far, the case presented to the court has been underpinned by a particularly critical premise. Namely, that the victim was dining alone.Ryunosuke:...!Judge:However, as we have now discovered that this premise is false... ...it would be a desecration of our justice system to ignore the truth and give a ruling at this point.Auchi:Auchi:But, but, Your Excellency! That would mean missing the noon deadline of a ruling in order to send the telegraphic report to Great Britain! Our own government will surely be very displeased by such actions.Judge:Calm yourself, Counsel. I will not allow the government of our country or any other to influence the proceedings of my courtroom.Auchi:Ugh!Judge:Inspector Hosonaga...Hosonaga:Yes, sir?Judge:You will locate this Jezaille Brett and escort her to the courtroom with the utmost urgency.Hosonaga:At once, Your Excellency.Auchi:But, but that means you'll be going against the special orders you were given from the police bureau!Hosonaga:......... As I said before... ...it is my guiding principle to carry out all investigations flawlessly.Ryunosuke:So, it won't be a problem?Hosonaga:Ahem! Ahem! Ahem, ahem! Nothing will get in my way!Judge:Court will adjourn briefly. The prosecution must call the English student, Jezaille Brett, to the witness stand. Do I make myself clear?Auchi:Yes... ...Your Excellencyyyyyyy!Judge:Good. Then we will have a thirty-minute recess before reconvening.To be continued...22nd November, 11:38 a.m.Supreme Court of Judicature, Defendants' Antechamber 5Kazuma:Excellent work, Ryunosuke! That was superb!Ryunosuke:Ugh... My heart was in my mouth the entire time.Kazuma:It was almost unbelievable. I mean, looking at you in there... You were drenched in sweat, your eyes popping, your knees knocking AND you were grinding your teeth. It was a grim sight, but before I knew it, you'd started finding inconsistencies in the testimonies. I think you might have a natural talent for being a lawyer.Ryunosuke:Forget it! It's terrifying! If I get through this, I don't ever want to see the inside of a courtroom again!Kazuma:Ha ha ha ha hah! Anyway, it looks like we've exposed your phantom lady at least.Ryunosuke:...!Kazuma:Miss Jezaille Brett... A student from Great Britain...is she?Ryunosuke:That's what I was trying to tell everyone from the start. Dr Wilson wasn't alone! There was a young woman with him. Like I've been saying all along!Kazuma:Yes, you have, haven't you?Ryunosuke:I might not be overly confident in the courtroom, but my powers of observation are one thing I am sure of.Kazuma:Yes, I can see that. So...about this young gentlewoman... Thanks to our detective friend, she was hastily escorted away from the scene, it seems. Did you see what happened with that?Ryunosuke:No, I didn't see any of it. I was just on my way out of the restaurant myself. Then, on the floor next to Dr Wilson's table... ...I noticed there was a gun lying on the floor. And just after I bent down and picked it up...*BANG!*Ryunosuke:I didn't have time to think about where the sound of the gunshot had come from. The waiter ran over to me, looking as white as a sheet... ...and he bundled me into some sort of small pantry next to the kitchen.Kazuma:Fast thinking by the detective. He apprehended his suspect without a moment's delay.Ryunosuke:Yes, and because I was shut in the pantry... ...I have no idea what happened outside in the dining area.Kazuma:Hmm...???:Ah, there you are. Well done, both of you.Kazuma:Professor Mikotoba!Mikotoba:Well... It seems I was right. The pair of you make an outstanding team. You've exceeded my expectations, I have to say.Kazuma:Yes...it seems you planned this from the start. You arranged things so that I wouldn't be able to act as a lawyer in this trial.Mikotoba:......... Our modern country is still in its infancy. Our justice system, even more so. Which is why... ...I firmly believe that we need to send our brightest young stars overseas to learn all they can. I wanted to avoid a situation that may have resulted in your study tour to Great Britain being cancelled.Kazuma:......... Well, it makes no difference. Lawyer or otherwise, if I'm the kind of man who can't help his best friend avert the worst crisis of his life... ...I shouldn't waste everyone's time by going to study overseas anyway.Ryunosuke:What?! What are you saying, Kazuma?Mikotoba:Hmph. So that's your stance... I was afraid you'd feel that way.Ryunosuke:Kazuma!Mikotoba:Well then, it looks like it all comes down to you, young man.Ryunosuke:To, to me?Mikotoba:Yes. You need to prove your innocence, and uncover what really took place in that restaurant. I  must say, I very much want to know the truth. After all, I have a personal connection to this case.Ryunosuke:(Come to think of it, he said the same thing earlier this morning, didn't he?) Um, if you don't mind me asking, Professor... ...did you know the victim?Mikotoba:Yes, I did. As you're probably aware, Dr John H. Wilson was a visiting professor at Yumei. And it was I who invited him.Ryunosuke:Oh! I, I see...Kazuma:I...didn't know that before.Mikotoba:Anyway, you're about to go into battle. The victim was a university professor from Great Britain. And a well known one at that. Naturally our government is looking to identify and punish the culprit as quickly as possible.Kazuma:But let's not forget who we're going up against. The 'gentlewoman' whose involvement our police bureau went to extraordinary lengths to hide.Ryunosuke:...!Mikotoba:Yes, and I'm sure the prosecution will be using every tool at their disposal to quash your case. But I've no doubt that you pair will put up a good fight, right to the last. Best of luck!Ryunosuke:Thank you!Mikotoba:Now then... ...I need you to run an errand at the university at once. There's something I think we may need.???:Of course. Good luck...Kazuma-sama.Bailiff:Defendant Naruhodo! Court recess is over. Please make your way back inside the courtroom at once!Kazuma:It's time. Let's get back to it, partner. Let's go in there and deal a decisive blow before those old fossils know what's hit them!Ryunosuke:......... Um, Kazuma...Kazuma:What?Ryunosuke:Thank you. Really.Kazuma:What for?Ryunosuke:Well, if you hadn't said you believed me, then... ...I'm fairly sure I'd already have been found guilty by now.Kazuma:Look, I have faith in you. As a lawyer, and as a friend.Ryunosuke:Coming from you, that means a lot. (If I'm found guilty in this trial... ...he's really going to give up on his dream of studying abroad. That's the kind of true friend he is. So this isn't just my battle any more. Whoever we're up against, we absolutely cannot afford to lose!) Alright then... ...I'll save the thank-yous for after the trial.Kazuma:You can treat me to one of those sukiyaki meals I like from 'Yumei Cafeteria' on University Street. With an extra large portion, of course!22nd November, 12:09 p.m.Supreme Court of Judicature, Courtroom 2Judge:The court hereby resumes the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Prosecutor Auchi, have you managed to subpoena the witness?Auchi:Yes, Your Excellency! Against all odds. And thanks to a certain young stripling, the prosecution is now under rather painful scrutiny from the government.Ryunosuke:Ugh... Sorry...Kazuma:Let the government scrutinise. That's their job. It's nothing to worry about.Auchi:It's highly unlikely that the good relations we've forged with Great Britain will emerge from this trial unscathed. Will you still think it's nothing to worry about when the new treaty breaks down and our nation founders?!Ryunosuke:Again... Terribly sorry...Kazuma:If the friendship between our nations is really so fragile, then the treaty isn't worth the paper it's written on. You really have nothing to worry about, Ryunosuke.Auchi:What do you mean?Kazuma:A secret trial, anxiety over some foreign government's opinions, a bungled investigation, missing witnesses... Is this what our nation's justice system is? Is this the Supreme Court of Japan, or of England?!Auchi:Shut up! Shut up, you jumped-up rookie boy! You and your friend know nothing! Nothing of the situation our nation finds itself in! By aligning ourselves with this great world power, we'll become strong! Diplomacy has never been more critical! Steady political manoeuvring is what will secure our futures!Ryunosuke:......... I won't deny that I'm no expert. I'm just a student. And one who could arguably study harder, too. But standing here now in our Supreme Court, there is one thing that I feel very strongly: A country that fails to uphold the truth in its justice system is a country with no future at all.Auchi:...!Judge:...!Kazuma:Well said, Ryunosuke. Despite the wide-eyed look of terror.Auchi:You little braaaaats!Judge:Thank you, Counsel. This court is the pinnacle of our nation's justice system, and exists solely for the pursuance of truth. With that in mind, this trial will now resume with the next witness taking the stand. The visiting student from Great Britain, Miss Jezaille Brett!Auchi:Yes... ...Your Excellencyyyyyyy!Auchi:Well, what a delight it is to welcome such a fine gentlewoman to Japan! And from such a distant land!Judge:Tea! Someone bring English tea! In England, no discussions take place without tea!Ryunosuke:...Is that true?Kazuma:...No idea.Auchi:So, erm... Ahem! Could we possibly trouble you to state your name and occupation for the court?Hosonaga:Of course. My name is Satoru Hosonaga. I have been working undercover as the head waiter at La Carneval, but my true-Auchi:Yes, yes, we know all about you already!Judge:Inspector Hosonaga! Where are your manners? In England, it's always ladies first!Ryunosuke:...Is that true?Kazuma:...No idea. More importantly, a little earlier today you said something to me. You said your powers of observation are the one thing you're sure of.Ryunosuke:Oh, yes... I think I did, didn't I?Kazuma:Yet your description for this amazing sight was simply 'a woman'. Sorry, Ryunosuke, but powers of observation aside, your powers of description are sorely lacking.Ryunosuke:...Guilty.Auchi:So, dear lady, once again, if we may trouble you for your name and occupation, please.???:[Foreign text].Auchi:.........Judge:..................Auchi:Um, I'm terribly sorry, dear lady, but...what?Hosonaga:[Foreign text]????:[Foreign text].Hosonaga:The lady says her name is Jezaille Brett. She comes from London, England. She's a visiting research student, currently enrolled in Yumei University's medical faculty.Auchi:Oh, my! What a rare treat to hear the dulcet tones of the delightful language of the British people! I'm afraid I don't understand a word you said, but it was as beautiful as a hummingbird's song!Kazuma:As far as I can tell... ...the detective is translating her words faithfully enough.Ryunosuke:Yes, I agree. Haha, you'll obviously do fine in England, Kazuma. Her English doesn't rattle you at all, does it?Kazuma:Nor you. You've clearly been paying attention in your English classes, Ryunosuke.Judge:The court thanks the beautiful lady for taking the stand. Now...if we may trouble you to confirm something, Miss Brett.Brett:.........Judge:Three days ago, at a restaurant called La Carneval, a grim murder took place. The court has been led to believe that you were dining there with the victim, Dr Wilson, at the time. Is that correct?Hosonaga:[Foreign text]?Brett:[Foreign text].Hosonaga:She says...'Yes.'Ryunosuke:This could take some time...Kazuma:So even though she's studying here in Japan, she can't speak any Japanese?Brett:[Foreign text]. [Foreign text].Hosonaga:She'd like to apologise for disappearing from the scene. She says that she was due to make a presentation at the university, so she had to leave immediately.Kazuma:Interesting, when you're the one who engineered her escape...Hosonaga:I was just following special orders from the bureau.Auchi:Well now, dear lady, would you be so kind as to cast your eyes over this photographic print? Seeing as you were, so unfortunately, present at the scene of the crime... ...could it be that your resplendent eyes caught sight of the wicked perpetrator, perhaps?Brett:[Foreign text].Hosonaga:Apparently it was a very frightening...and sorrowful sight.Judge:Do you mean to say...?Hosonaga:Yes. It would appear the lady did witness the crime. The very moment when the accused, standing right there in this courtroom... ...shot the victim in cold blood!Judge:Order! Order in court!Auchi:Did, did you hear that, Your Excellency? Here we have an absolutely conclusive witness statement!Judge:Hmmm...Kazuma:Well, it looks like it's clear now. Clear who our real enemy is!Ryunosuke:...!Judge:Unfortunately, I will have to ask you to formally testify, if you please. Kindly tell the court the exact nature of this frightening and sorrowful sight you described.Hosonaga:[Foreign text]?Witness Testimony- A Frightening and Sorrowful Sight -Brett:[Foreign text].Hosonaga:'I had arranged to meet for a slightly late luncheon with Dr Wilson that day.''The professor was unable to eat, so I ordered for myself only. A beef steak.'Brett:[Foreign text]!Hosonaga:'After a while, the accused came over to greet the professor, and they got into a fierce argument.''Then, not long afterwards, the accused took the professor's gun, and shot him right before my eyes!'Brett:[Foreign text].Hosonaga:'I don't carry a gun myself, so obviously I couldn't have been the culprit.'Judge:Hmph. This is a condemning testimony indeed.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:No! I, I didn't have any kind of argument with the professor at all!Auchi:Auchi:Quiet, you filthy wretch! Look at you, you black-hearted blackguard! And look at this snow-white angel! I'm sure even a dark-minded scoundrel like you can imagine whose words the court is going to believe!Ryunosuke:Ugh...Kazuma:You're still making the same mistakes, Ryunosuke. You mustn't blurt out when you're goaded like that. That's a lesson you need to learn.Ryunosuke:Ugh, but he's so annoying!Hosonaga:Of course, I was at the scene as well. I took statements from this lady and the two witnesses who testified before, and reported back to the bureau. It was decided that Miss Brett was not involved, so I let her go.Kazuma:The testimonies of the last two witnesses were completely worthless, however.Hosonaga:Well, even so... On the day in question, the lady was wearing the same outfit as she is today. As you can see, there is nowhere about her person where she could conceal a firearm.Ryunosuke:(I would think she could hide a gun almost ANYWHERE in that outfit if she wanted to...)Auchi:Unless and until the precise location where the witness is to have hidden a weapon can be shown, this is moot.Hosonaga:'There are no pockets in my outfit. I have nowhere to hide a gun.' Those are the witness's own words on the matter.Ryunosuke:(Argh! That's ridiculous! If only I was allowed to lift up her dress, I could prove it!)Kazuma:Don't think about doing anything rash, Ryunosuke.Ryunosuke:But I didn't fire the gun I picked up! There must have been another gun there that day!Kazuma:You're right about that. Which means...this lady was hiding a gun somewhere... Yes, that's what we have to prove now. And to do so, we will need to pull her testimony apart.Judge:The defence may now cross-examine the witness.Ryunosuke:Oh! Yes, Your Excellency!Cross-Examination- A Frightening and Sorrowful Sight -",

      "newContext": "Hosonaga:'I had arranged to meet for a slightly late luncheon with Dr Wilson that day.'PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:After 2 p.m., in fact. That's really quite a late lunch, isn't it?Auchi:Auchi:You don't keep up with the latest fashions from Britain, do you? Late luncheons are en vogue. Isn't that right?Brett:No.Auchi:Ugh...Kazuma:Hm, a decisive English 'no' has quite a sting to it.Hosonaga:The gentlewoman is currently working in the victim's research laboratory, it seems. So it was apparently a daily occurrence that they would lunch together.Kazuma:But on the day in question, the victim had another appointment at the clinic first.Ryunosuke:(Yes, which we can prove from the medical report card that was submitted as evidence earlier.)Hosonaga:That's right. Miss Brett and the victim went to lunch following the victim's treatment, which is why it was so late.Judge:Yes, yes, that all makes perfect sense.Auchi:Such wonderful logic! What a shining example of English intelligence this fine gentlewoman is!Kazuma:So you both arrived at the restaurant. What happened next?Hosonaga: 'The professor was unable to eat, so I ordered for myself only. A beef steak.'PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:He was unable to eat, you say. And that was because he'd just had a tooth removed at Hotta Clinic, correct?Hosonaga:That's right.Ryunosuke:(Um, you're supposed to actually check with the witness before answering...)Kazuma:Was Miss Brett aware of that fact?Hosonaga:It seems so, yes. She'd heard that the professor was to have some dental treatment.Ryunosuke:So that would mean... ...that it WAS you who ate the steak pictured here. Is that right, Miss Brett?Hosonaga:That's right, yes. The print you have there shows the table exactly as it was left after the horrifying events.Ryunosuke:('Exactly as it was left'...?)Auchi:Dear me! What a harrowing experience! To have travelled to a distant island on the far side of the world and be embroiled in such a tragic incident... Have no fear, my dear lady! I swear I will crush the evil fiend that has subjected you to this terrible plight!Kazuma:So the victim, Dr Wilson, had nothing to eat or drink at all?Hosonaga:That's right. Other than some carbonated water.Ryunosuke:Just water?Hosonaga:Yes. The professor was unable to eat, but he had been given permission to drink water. So it appears that the diners toasted their lunch with a glass of water each.Ryunosuke:(Hm, they each raised a glass of carbonated water...)Kazuma:What do you think, Ryunosuke? About the witness's last statement.It's very meaningfulRyunosuke:That last statement of yours, Miss Brett...has a profound bearing on this case!Auchi:Well, well, how fascinating. Do tell us, what is this 'profound bearing', hm?Ryunosuke:......... .........Kazuma:The significance of the statement will become apparent when the time is right. The defence calls for the witness's last statement to be formally added to the testimony. Auchi:Hmph! Well sidestepped, Counsel.Judge:Very well. Miss Brett... Kindly repeat what you just said to be added to your official testimony.Hosonaga:'Gladly,' she said.Brett:.........Ryunosuke:That was brilliant, Kazuma! I'm going to remember that one.Kazuma:Which one?Ryunosuke:'The significance will become apparent when the time is right.' I could really use that phrase!Kazuma:I'd hope there are some other useful tips you're picking up from this experience than that, Ryunosuke.Changes statement \"The professor was unable to eat, so I ordered for myself only. A beef steak.\" to \"I ordered a beef steak for myself, and the professor and I said \"cheers\" over a glass of carbonated water.\"It's nothingRyunosuke:Um, I can't really see anything wrong with it.Kazuma:Really? Alright then, if that's what you think. .........Ryunosuke:Um, Kazuma... ...do YOU think it's significant in some way? Kazuma:Well, perhaps. But let's do this your way.Ryunosuke:(Maybe I should press her on that statement again...)Leads back to cross-examinationHosonaga:'I ordered a beef steak for myself, and the professor and I said \"cheers\" over a glass of carbonated water.'PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:So both you and the professor drank this carbonated water, did you?Hosonaga:Yes. Being the waiter, I poured the two glasses myself. I clearly remember doing so.Ryunosuke:(Except you're actually a detective...)Kazuma:And the beef steak... That was for you, Miss Brett?Hosonaga:The lady says that she'd heard it was not customary to eat beef here until Japan opened its doors to the world.Ryunosuke:Yes, that's true.Hosonaga:'What a frightful place!' ...is the lady's opinion.Ryunosuke:(And I've heard it's not customary to eat sashimi in Great Britain. Now THAT'S frightful!)Kazuma:Every country has its own cuisine. As long as people have food to eat, what does it matter what it is?Ryunosuke:True. Come to think of it... ...the first time I tried carbonated water, it was much more of a shock than the first time I tried beef! (But anyway, back to this witness's statement. Somehow, I feel like there's something out of place in what she's saying...)Kazuma:We need to pounce on even the slightest thing now. Because you never know what might lead us to our goal. Our goal of turning this trial around.Ryunosuke:Understood, Kazuma.Present Crime Scene PhotographRyunosuke:Leads to:\"......... That's it!\"Hosonaga:'After a while, the accused came over to greet the professor, and they got into a fierce argument.'PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:I never got into an argument with the professor! All I did when I noticed him, was go over to say hello!Hosonaga:Please, don't get angry with me.Ryunosuke:No no! I, I wasn't directing that retort at you! It was meant for the lady next to you. But anyway! As I said, I did NOT argue with the professor!Hosonaga:......... I'm afraid your words are in vain.Ryunosuke:Sorry?Hosonaga:Miss Brett does not appear to speak Japanese.Auchi:No, no, of course not! Japanese is such a cumbersome language anyway! English is the future! We must all su-pii-ku Ingurisshu!Kazuma:I wonder if the prosecution will feel that way forever, or only in the presence of a beautiful woman, hm?Ryunosuke:(Well, that 'beautiful woman' is telling blatant lies with a completely straight face. I have to find something that will unravel her testimony, no matter how seemingly insignificant it may be...)Hosonaga:Anyway, it seems that after the argument, the accused briefly returned to his own seat. Kazuma:That part ties in with what you said, doesn't it?Ryunosuke:Yes...I still had some coffee to drink. Kazuma:And the next time you got up after that...Ryunosuke:Was when I'd finished my coffee and stood up to leave.Brett:.........Hosonaga:'Then, not long afterwards, the accused took the professor's gun, and shot him right before my eyes!'PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:Like I said! I did NOT shoot that gun!Kazuma:And like I said! There's no point repeating that assertion over and over!Ryunosuke:Well, I wasn't expecting to be attacked by my own side.Auchi:Nevertheless, Defendant, you can't deny... ...that when the shot rang out in the restaurant, you had a gun in your hand!Ryunosuke:Well, yes, that's...that's true, but...! But all I did was pick up the gun I saw on the floor next to the professor as I was leaving the restaurant! In fact... Yes! There was someone much closer to the victim than me at that time. The highly suspicious lady in the stand!Auchi:Auchi:That will do, you dirty rotten scoundrel!Ryunosuke:Dirty?Auchi:Your baseless accusations could very well cause an international incident...boy!Kazuma:It seems to me, that your accusation is just as baseless as ours.Auchi:Tsh huh huh! What nonsense!Hosonaga:The lady is merely stating what she saw.Ryunosuke:(And this is already an international incident as far as I'm concerned, anyway.)Hosonaga:'I don't carry a gun myself, so obviously I couldn't have been the culprit.'PressRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:It's all very well saying that, but can you prove it?Hosonaga:Absolutely. I verified it personally.Ryunosuke:You...verified it?Hosonaga:Yes, immediately after the incident, I checked to make sure the lady was not carrying a weapon. I distinctly remember her saying, 'I'm not.' Ryunosuke:That's...all you did? You just asked her?Kazuma:Surely you carried out a physical search, Inspector?Hosonaga:...No.Ryunosuke:Why on earth not?!Auchi:The honourable English gentlewoman clearly stated that she did not possess a weapon. There was obviously no need for any further probing into the matter!Kazuma:Or...there was no permission given for any further probing into the matter perhaps?Auchi:Think what you will! But if you're going to continue with this preposterous claim that the refined lady was concealing a firearm... ...the prosecution demands that you support your assertion with facts!Kazuma:In other words, he wants evidence.Ryunosuke:Ugh...Brett:[Foreign text].Hosonaga:The lady wishes to point out that of course she wanted to stay and assist with the investigation... ...but she was in a hurry to give a presentation at the university, so she was compelled to leave.Kazuma:Not to mention the fact that your office had told you to get the woman out of there.Hosonaga:Not 'get her out of there'. I just urged her to leave. The lady would like to point out that she in no way meant to 'run away' from the scene of the crime. Which is why she is only too happy to cooperate and testify here in court today, of course.Auchi:Unlike a certain student who refuses to admit when the game is up!Ryunosuke:.........Auchi:You could at least have the courtesy to pay attention when I'm goading you!Kazuma:So she's maintaining that you got into an argument with the professor, at the end of which, you shot him.Ryunosuke:Which is an out-and-out, totally unfounded lie!Kazuma:Still, her statement is very compelling. After all, she's an elegant, refined, young and beautiful gentlewoman from Great Britain. In stark contrast to you, dressed from head to toe in a dull black school uniform.Ryunosuke:I'm dressed exactly the same way as you are, except for the flapping red ribbons!Kazuma:Well anyway, this is our only chance to expose her testimony as the fiction that it is.Ryunosuke:...!Kazuma:If we can't do that, the trial's over. Even you with your thick skin must be able to feel the murderous looks you're getting from around the room.Ryunosuke:Only too well. I feel half dead already. (And the fact that I can't see a single inconsistency in her testimony isn't making me feel any better, either!)Kazuma:The first thing to do is press her on any of her statements that seem even slightly off to you. Do that, and an opening will present itself. I promise you.Ryunosuke:(I need to expose the true face of this exotic foreigner that's hiding behind the mask. That's what I should be aiming for in this cross-examination...!)Ryunosuke:......... That's it! Let me just confirm something, please. It's...to do with this photographic print. Just a short while ago, you spoke of this print showing the victim's table at the crime scene... ...that it was 'exactly as it was left'.Hosonaga:'That is correct,' the lady says.Ryunosuke:Well! That is... It's, um... It's odd! Very odd!Auchi:Dear me. What's odd is the defence's inability to express itself.Ryunosuke:Ugh...Kazuma:Ryunosuke, what is it about the print that looks odd to you?Ryunosuke:Well obviously, it's...it's the 'cheers'!Auchi:The...'cheers'?Ryunosuke:Miss Brett just told us that she and the professor said 'cheers' over a glass of water. But if that's true... ...there should be two glasses on the table, not one!Judge:Ah...Hosonaga:...!Judge:You're quite right, Counsel. There's only one glass pictured here!Auchi:Auchi:Are we supposed to be impressed by this nit-picking over minutiae? What possible difference does the presence or absence of a glass make on the case?Kazuma:Kazuma:Minutiae, you say? Could it be that the detective here removed a glass from the table to conceal the lady's presence?Hosonaga:Of course not! I would never do something so reckless.Ryunosuke:But there should have been two glasses on the table! Or are you going to try to tell me you can clink with only one?!Hosonaga:......... You're quite right. I certainly took two glasses to the table.Brett:[Foreign text].Judge:Inspector! What did the lady say?Hosonaga:It would seem that it was Miss Brett who took the glass from the table.Ryunosuke:What?!Hosonaga:'It was all so terrifying, everything that happened. I panicked and thought I should try to hide the fact that I'd been there at all,' she's saying.Judge:Good gracious!Brett:...Sorry.Auchi:There, as I assured the court before... this is of no consequence at all.Ryunosuke:Oh, please...Auchi:We must remember that this student had just murdered the lady's luncheon companion before her very eyes! Who could blame her for concealing a glass or two in her state of disarray?Ryunosuke:That's absurd!Auchi:Oh really? So do we take it that you are now going to accuse this vulnerable, young and beautiful woman of...mischief?Ryunosuke:What?! No no no! This, this can't be put down to 'mischief'!Kazuma:I'd like to know... ...exactly how the lady took the glass from the scene.Brett:[Foreign text].Hosonaga:It would seem that she slipped it into a small handbag she was carrying.Judge:A handbag, you say?Hosonaga:Yes, Your Excellency. A small, handheld pouch commonly carried by well-to-do women in England.Auchi:So, the beautiful lady has very graciously explained how and why she removed the glass from the scene now. However! The fact remains that this glass has absolutely no bearing on the case!Judge:Hm...Auchi:This student has been trying to confuse the court with logical reasoning! But in the end, it comes to nothing. No more pretentious accusations! You have wasted enough time already!Judge:Indeed, the lady has offered a satisfactory explanation as to why she removed this glass. I think henceforth we can consider the matter to have no bearing on the case. Counsel for the Defence, are you in agreement?Ryunosuke:Um, well... (I don't know, really...)Kazuma:If you want to pursue this matter further... ...you're going to need to show that it has some deeper significance.Ryunosuke:Yes, you're right. (So she took the glass away in her handbag. If there's a deeper significance there, it's...)The glassRyunosuke:If you ask me, it's the fact that she took the glass that has a deeper significance here.Kazuma:Why do you think that?Ryunosuke:Because! It's the property of the restaurant! It's not some harmless act of pilfering, like taking a bar of soap home from the public baths, is it?Kazuma:You...take soap from the public baths?!Ryunosuke:What? No! I, I mean... Ahem! That isn't significant here...Kazuma:It's very significant! But this isn't the time or the place. There are more important things to concentrate on now. I think maybe you should reconsider your position, too.Ryunosuke:Ugh, sorry... I will.Leads back to:\"Indeed, the lady has offered a satisfactory explanation as to why she removed this glass.\"The handbagLeads to:\"Wait! The lady put the glass in her handbag, you say?\"Nothing in particularRyunosuke:Well... I'm not really sure there is a deeper significance here at all.Kazuma:You do get it, don't you? If you can't find a reason why this glass matters, you'll almost certainly be found guilty.Ryunosuke:Ugh... I knew you were going to say that.Kazuma:And I presume you've got this, too? It's the fact that she took the glass away in her handbag. That's the deeper significance.Ryunosuke:If I'd worked that out, I would have given it as my answer in the first place.Kazuma:Think about it. The lady was carrying a handbag. It could have had almost anything inside it.Ryunosuke:Ah...Kazuma:So! It's time to reconsider your answer, Ryunosuke.Leads back to:\"Indeed, the lady has offered a satisfactory explanation as to why she removed this glass.\"Ryunosuke:Wait! The lady put the glass in her handbag, you say?Auchi:Yes. Do try to keep up. It's already been explained to the court that all English gentlewomen carry handbags for small items.Ryunosuke:Let me see... A little while ago, Miss Brett stated the following... 'There are no pockets in my outfit. I have nowhere to hide a gun.' But! What she forgot to mention, was her handbag. In which it would be perfectly possible to conceal a gun!Judge:You're right!Kazuma:Well done, partner. I had a feeling you'd pick up on that, too.Auchi:What are you insinuating, you vile blackguard?!Kazuma:It's really very simple. The gunshot was heard when the defendant picked up the gun from the restaurant floor. As he didn't fire that gun, we can deduce there must have been another firearm at the scene. The true murder weapon, if you will.Auchi:You, you can't seriously be suggesting...Ryunosuke:Inspector Hosonaga!Hosonaga:Yes?Ryunosuke:Did you or did you not search Miss Jezaille Brett's handbag on the day of the murder?Hosonaga:No, sir, I did not.Ryunosuke:(As I thought!) In other words, another gun - the one that was actually used to kill the professor... ...could have been hidden in Miss Brett's handbag!Auchi:Nnn... NOOOOOOOOOOOO!Judge:Order! Order! Order!Auchi:What is the meaning of this, Inspector?Hosonaga:The meaning of what, Prosecutor Auchi?Auchi:Why on earth did you not have the lady open her handbag and show you the contents at the time? Thanks to your bungling incompetence, now she has to endure these...uncomfortable accusations!Kazuma:Brilliant work, partner! Now we have a chance to expose the real woman behind the mask!Ryunosuke:Do you think so, Kazuma?Hosonaga:Ahem! ...Ahem! AHEM! ...AHEM! ...AHEM, AHEM! Well, what a sorry situation. Clearly you have no faith in the police.Ryunosuke:...!Hosonaga:As I said, I did not search the lady's handbag after the shooting. Simply because...it was unnecessary.Ryunosuke:Unnecessary in what way?Hosonaga:I ought to thank the student lawyer, really. I have a piece of evidence here that I had completely forgotten about. This photographic print. This print is of a photograph that I thought would be prudent to take immediately after the shooting. As you can see, it clearly shows Miss Brett's handbag.Judge:Well I never! You can see right through to what's inside!Hosonaga:That's right. Apparently, meshwork bags like these are the height of fashion in London at the moment.Judge:Hm, so the contents are clearly visible.Hosonaga:Exactly. So there was no need to search the lady's handbag. If there had been a gun inside, it would have been immediately obvious.Ryunosuke:Agh!Hosonaga:As you can see, there's nothing to imply Miss Brett's guilt here. Thank you for helping to prove that, Naruhodo-san.Ryunosuke:Uh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!Judge:Order! Order! Inspector Hosonaga, you will submit that print as evidence at once!Hosonaga:Certainly, Your Excellency.The photograph of the handbag has been entered into the Court Record.Judge:I think you've had long enough to cross-examine the witness, Counsel.Ryunosuke:.........Judge:The court has now been shown considerable evidence. As the photographic print just submitted into the Court Record appears to have no further significance... ...I am satisfied that there is no longer any room for doubt in this matter, and I must make my ruling.Auchi:Indeed. And there is only one logical conclusion. That the pathetic rookie slumped over the bench before us is the only possible perpetrator of this crime.Ryunosuke:(No... Just when I thought I was beginning to turn things around... I'm in a worse situation than I was at the start!)Kazuma:.........Ryunosuke:Um, Kazuma...Kazuma:......... I'm sorry, Ryunosuke.Ryunosuke:...!Kazuma:Now that the cross-examination of the witness is over, there's no way to force the trial to continue.Ryunosuke:What?! You, you mean, this is it...?Kazuma:.........Auchi:Tsh huh huh! I must say, you put up quite a fight...for a rookie student. But the weak are meat, while the strong eat! You were wasting your time. There is no way to defeat true justice! A fact you can chew on to your heart's content...from the inside of your cell!Ryunosuke:(This can't be happening...! Am I really going to be found guilty of a crime that I didn't commit? And Kazuma... His dream of going to study in Great Britain will slip through his fingers.) ......... Kazuma...Kazuma:What?Ryunosuke:Is there really... Is there really no chance now of turning this trial around?Kazuma:You heard the judge. There's nothing about that last photograph the detective produced that we can contest. Which means...there's no basis on which we can argue for the trial to continue.Ryunosuke:.........Judge:Very well. I will now proceed immediately to the ruling.Auchi:It seems we will be able to report to the British government on time after all!Kazuma:That smug little...Judge:Ryunosuke Naruhodo, having considered all of the evidence placed before me, I hereby find you-Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:Wait! ...Your Excellency!Kazuma:...Ryunosuke?!Ryunosuke:I, I don't think you can rule on this case yet!Auchi:Auchi:This amateurishness is getting tedious! When His Excellency deems that the trial is over, he gives his ruling. That is the most basic protocol of the courtroom!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:Your Excellency, just a moment ago you said this: 'As the photographic print just submitted appears to have no further significance... ...there is no longer any room for doubt in this matter, and I must make my ruling.' Now, that means that if there was a problem with the evidence - some significant detail, I mean... ...then ruling on the case at this time... would be out of the question!Auchi:Auchi:This is blatant straw-clutching! Look at this photographic print! All it shows is the handbag the gentlewoman was carrying on the day in question. There can be no 'problem' with this evidence!Ryunosuke:.........Kazuma:You'd better know what you're doing, Ryunosuke.Judge:Hm... I understand your objection, Counsel. Certainly, the new evidence submitted by the detective has not undergone the court's scrutiny. However, I fail to see how we can glean any new information from this handbag.Auchi:Ha! My thoughts exactly! Really, the prosecution is becoming tired of this rookie's desperate wheezes!Ryunosuke:(Yes, I am desperate! But this isn't a wheeze. There's something about this photograph which just doesn't seem right. If only I could put my finger on it...!)Judge:Very well, I will grant the defence one final opportunity.Ryunosuke:...!Auchi:What?!Judge:But be warned that if I am unsatisfied by your response here, the trial will be over with immediate effect. Do I make myself clear?Ryunosuke:Yes, Your Excellency.Judge:So, take another look at the photographic print Inspector Hosonaga submitted before. You will identify for the court where in this print we see the 'significant detail' to which you have alluded!Present wrist markRyunosuke:Leads to:\"Look at this, here...\"Present anywhere elseRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:Just here! I feel sure that around this area there's something extremely significant!Auchi:Auchi:What's significant is your inability to positively identify anything wrong with this picture at all!Ryunosuke:Eek!Judge:I concur. And praise the prosecution for his quick-wittedness. Kazuma:I know it's the handbag that stands out in this picture. But you need to look further. Examine everything. Otherwise you might miss an important clue. Always try to see the whole, and don't be blinkered by individual details. I know you can do it.Ryunosuke:(If I could do it, then I wouldn't have pointed out the wrong part of the picture just now...)Judge:Well, unfortunately, I must do as I promised.Kazuma:Kazuma:Wait, Your Excellency! The court should give consideration to the fact that this man is an amateur! One more chance, please.Judge:Hmmm... Well, I suppose he is just a callow student lawyer with little sense of protocol in these matters.Ryunosuke:(I'm starting to feel insulted here...)Leads back to:\"So, take another look at the photographic print Inspector Hosonaga submitted before.\"Ryunosuke:Look at this, here... There's a very unusual mark on the victim's wrist.Judge:That is true. It looks almost...like a burn of some description.Brett:...!Auchi:Auchi:Dear me! I was pondering what new piffle you would come out with. A burn, you say? On the victim's wrist? Clearly that has nothing whatsoever to do with the magnificent lady's handbag!Hosonaga:Yes, that is a burn mark, you're right.Ryunosuke:...!Judge:Go on, Inspector.Hosonaga:The police coroner also noticed it when he was performing the post-mortem examination. It was deemed unrelated to the cause of death, so he didn't note it in his report.Auchi:What did I tell you? In any case, we have no idea when the victim suffered this burn, do we? And no possible way of knowing, either.Judge:The more I look at it, the more I find myself intrigued by the curious shape of this mark... However, as Prosecutor Auchi points out, unless a firm connection to the case can be shown... ...I cannot allow any further time to be spent on the precise details of this burn.Ryunosuke:...!Brett:[Foreign text].Hosonaga:Excuse me, Your Excellency... It would seem Miss Brett has a lunch appointment with the dean and other university staff. She would like to know if she may be excused from the stand now.Auchi:Oh, of course, of course, dear lady! We shan't hold you up any longer! I'm quite sure His Excellency is about to give his final ruling anyway.Judge:.........Kazuma:What's your thinking on this, Ryunosuke? Do you believe this burn does have something to do with the case?Ryunosuke:To be honest, I'm not really sure. But if I don't keep pushing, then it's all over. So I was thinking I should keep digging and digging... in the hope that I might uncover something useful.Kazuma:......... Yes, you're right.Ryunosuke:I am?!Kazuma:If we can just link that burn to the case... If we can do that, we might be able to prise this shutting door back open again.Ryunosuke:...!Auchi:Just give up, Counsel! You can't possibly hope to do that.Judge:Indeed. I'm afraid that without evidence, I can't allow you to pursue what is little more than conjecture.Kazuma:But if we had evidence? Evidence that irrefutably linked the burn on the victim's wrist to the case. Then you would allow it?Judge:I would, yes.Kazuma:To tell the truth, I hadn't noticed that burn. But as soon as you pointed it out, what I did notice... ...was the colour draining from Miss Brett's face.Ryunosuke:Really? (I have to find some link between that burn and the case... This is the moment of truth. It's time to find some evidence that proves what that burn really means!)Judge:So then, the defence will now present its evidence to the court. The evidence that demonstrates an inextricable connection between the victim's burn and this trial!Present Crime Scene PhotographRyunosuke:Leads to:\"What's this, Counsel? Yet another print?\"Present anything elseRyunosuke:Ryunosuke:The victim's burn is clearly related to this piece of evidence in the Court Record!Auchi:Auchi:Then explain to the court in five words or less what the nature of that connection is!Ryunosuke:......... Erm, well, it's obviously, um...Auchi:Thank you. Five highly illuminating words.Ryunosuke:What?Auchi:As I suspected, the rookie student is bluffing! Again!Ryunosuke:Agh!Kazuma:You've been burned there yourself, Ryunosuke.Ryunosuke:Sorry... (I do feel like I've seen the shape of that burn somewhere before, though...)Kazuma:Look through the Court Record again. Carefully, this time!Ryunosuke:Yes... Yes, I will!Leads back to:\"I have to find some link between that burn and the case...\"Judge:What's this, Counsel? Yet another print?Ryunosuke:Yes, Your Excellency. I believe photographic prints are an amazing invention. When we humans look at a scene, we miss things. But in a photograph, things we may have overlooked at the time are recorded forevermore.Auchi:Do hurry up, rookie! What are you trying to say? To inconvenience this poor lady any further really would be quite inexcusable.Ryunosuke:Actually, we may need you to stay with us a little longer, if you don't mind...Miss Brett.Brett:.........Ryunosuke:You see, it's very clearly visible in this other photograph. How did the victim come to have that unusually shaped burn on his wrist? The reason is recorded here forevermore!Hosonaga:What? How?Auchi:Auchi:You can't fool me with your little bluffs, boy! If that's your game, then let's see how it plays out! Show the court exactly what you mean! What is it in this photograph that explains the reason for the victim's burn?Present emblem on plateRyunosuke:Leads to:\"The, the beef steak?\"Present anywhere elseRyunosuke:Judge:I believe, Counsel, you were supposed to show us what the cause of the victim's burn was, no?Ryunosuke:And...you don't think you could suffer a burn from this?Auchi:This ludicrous response? Oh certainly, you could. Not that I expected any different...from a rookie like you.Ryunosuke:Ugh...Judge:Hmph! Perhaps my gavel can help clear the smoke from your mind, Counsel?Ryunosuke:I'll, I'll try to get my head straight before that's necessary, Your Excellency.Kazuma:It takes some skill to get something so wrong after you've got so much right already. But see if you can use one of your other skills this time. Otherwise...you'll have my sword to answer to!Ryunosuke:(I preferred the first half of that, when it sounded more like a compliment...)Auchi:Dear me. Like I said...Leads back to:\"You can't fool me with your little bluffs, boy!\"Auchi:The, the beef steak?Ryunosuke:Actually, the point is the metal plate the steak was served on.Judge:The plate? Ah... AAAAAAAAAAAAH!Auchi:Your Excellency! Are you alright?!Ryunosuke:As you can see, there's an emblem on the plate. I would guess it's some sort of trademark of La Carneval.Hosonaga:Ah!Ryunosuke:The emblem on the plate... ...and the victim's burn... ...are exactly the same shape!Auchi:Aaaaaaaaah!Kazuma:Ryunosuke! You genius!Hosonaga:You're spot on...Ryunosuke:Which means... ...the victim must have suffered this burn while he was present at the restaurant!Auchi:Auchi:But... But even if that is the case... ...we can't know if it happened on the day in question or not. It could've been the day before! Or the day before that! It most likely happened at some other, unrelated time!Ryunosuke:Well...um... Hm...Kazuma:Kazuma:Sadly, Prosecutor Auchi, the chances of that are extremely slim.Ryunosuke:Thanks...Auchi:Why?Kazuma:The outline of the burn is clearly discernible. Such a serious injury would have caused quite a commotion in the restaurant. Wouldn't you agree, Inspector Hosonaga?Hosonaga:I can't imagine having missed such a terrible disaster, certainly.Auchi:But, but...Hosonaga:I would say, looking at the picture of the wound, that it wasn't suffered very long ago. And, although it's not a particularly large burn, it's extremely well defined, as the defence just pointed out. This was no mild burn, that's for sure.Ryunosuke:Can you be more specific, Inspector?Hosonaga:Well, let's see... ...if the plate was at around ninety degrees centigrade, a burn like that would have taken around three seconds.Judge:It's inconceivable that the victim wouldn't have let out a scream of pain, then.Hosonaga:I've been investigating at the restaurant for several weeks already, but I've not heard anyone scream at all. As the head waiter of La Carneval, I can testify to that without hesitation.Auchi:But you... You're a detective, not a waaaiteeer!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:There you have it! Something isn't right here! As the detective said... ...anyone who burnt themselves on a piping hot plate for three whole seconds would scream in pain. There's no question of that.Kazuma:And yet Inspector Hosonaga never heard the professor scream. Not on that day, or any before it.Ryunosuke:That's right. And the strange thing is... ...on the day he was shot, I didn't hear him cry out, either.Kazuma:What are you suggesting?Ryunosuke:Well, if the professor had carelessly laid his wrist on the plate for anything like three seconds that day...Judge:That would be beyond careless, I think, Counsel.Ryunosuke:...then the rest of us in the restaurant - myself, the sergeant and the old antiques dealer... All of us would, without any question, have heard him scream. Wouldn't you agree, Prosecutor Auchi?Auchi:Hm? Um, well... Yes, I suppose...Ryunosuke:So the question is... ...why didn't a single person hear Dr Wilson scream?Auchi:...!...!Judge:...!Kazuma:I, I almost don't believe it! Ryunosuke, do you think...?Ryunosuke:(Can it really be true? I never dreamt we'd arrive at a conclusion like this, but... I'm starting to think that maybe... ...we've been led into a terrible trap!) There's only one explanation I can think of to make sense of this apparent impossibility. On the day in question, when he suffered the burn to his wrist, Dr Wilson...Hadn't noticed the burnRyunosuke:Yes, the professor, being as absent-minded as usual... ...was unaware of his hand falling onto the piping-hot plate, and didn't even notice the burn happening!Kazuma:You didn't even know the professor, and yet here you are labelling him as a bumbling scatterbrain.Ryunosuke:Hm?Kazuma:How about I hold your wrist on a hot plate and we see how YOUR bumbling scatterbrain copes? Perhaps the scream you let out will wake you up a bit.Ryunosuke:Well, it's nice that there's this frankness developing between us, partner.Kazuma:Don't call me 'partner' after coming out with nonsense like that! This is a critical moment. It may very well be our only chance to turn things in our favour. So come on, Ryunosuke. You can do it. Or rather... You have to do it! You're the only one who can!Leads back to:\"There's only one explanation I can think of to make sense of this apparent impossibility.\"Was asleepRyunosuke:Yes, the professor, with his tendency to nod off... ...was asleep when his hand fell onto the piping-hot plate, and didn't even notice the burn happening!Kazuma:You didn't even know the professor, and yet here you are labelling him as a dim-witted dozer.Ryunosuke:Hm?Kazuma:How about I hold your wrist on a hot plate and we see if YOU can sleep through it? Perhaps the scream you let out will wake you up a bit.Ryunosuke:Well, it's nice that there's this frankness developing between us, partner.Kazuma:Don't call me 'partner' after coming out with nonsense like that! This is a critical moment. It may very well be our only chance to turn things in our favour. So come on, Ryunosuke. You can do it. Or rather... You have to do it! You're the only one who can!Leads back to:\"There's only one explanation I can think of to make sense of this apparent impossibility.\"Was already deceasedLeads to:\"No man could remain silent while his wrist was burning on a piping-hot plate for three whole seconds.\"Ryunosuke:No man could remain silent while his wrist was burning on a piping-hot plate for three whole seconds. That's clearly impossible. Apart from in one particular situation...Judge:Counsel, are you suggesting...?Ryunosuke:Yes, it's only possible...if the man was already dead.Auchi:A-Already...Judge:Dead?Brett:.........Ryunosuke:Knowing what we know now, it's the only possible explanation. When the beef steak was brought to Dr Wilson's table that day... ...the professor...was already dead!Auchi:That's... That's... ...madneeessssss!Judge: Order! Order! Order, please! Counsel, explain this absurd notion at once! The victim was killed by a gunshot!Auchi:That's right! That's absolutely right, Your Excellency. This, this is just another ridiculous ploy by the rookie student! But clearly, he has no grasp of the facts!Kazuma:Kazuma:No, Prosecutor Auchi, it's you who has no grasp of the facts.Auchi:I beg your pardon?!Kazuma:As soon as it became apparent that the victim had suffered that burn while at the restaurant... ...this whole case was turned upside-down. Or have you not grasped that yet?Auchi:Urrr... Ugh...Kazuma:Your Excellency! The court MUST hear from this witness again. If it's true, as we now believe, that the victim was already dead before the gunshot was heard... ...it's highly likely that Miss Brett knows something about it!Brett:.........Judge:Incredible... I certainly didn't anticipate this twist of events. I'm sorry to say, Miss Brett... ...that you will have to forget your luncheon engagement.Auchi:B-But, Your Excellency!Brett:.........Judge:The justice system in our country may be in its infancy... ...but rest assured, all reasonable doubt must be dispelled before I am prepared to pass judgement.Ryunosuke:Thank you, Your Excellency.Brett:.........Ryunosuke:(What was that smile?)Brett:Yes, of course... I mean- I'd be delighted to help. Especially if it helps relations between my country and yours.Ryunosuke:...!Auchi:...!Judge:...!Auchi:Ah... Miss, Miss Brett... You...speak Japanese?Brett:Well, of course I do. I am studying in your country, after all.Judge:But...then...why have you been speaking through an interpreter until now?Brett:My mother tongue - the Queen's English - is the most refined and elegant language in the world. As a gentlewoman, I try to avoid speaking in your vulgar tone as much as possible.Ryunosuke:.........Auchi:.........Brett:But it seems the men in this land possess none of the chivalrous virtues of English gentlemen. So I can see that I shall have to lower myself to communicating with you all on your own level.Auchi:Oh... Ah...well... You are the epitome of a true English gentlewoman! We are truly honoured by this... This lavish consideration you so graciously afford us!Judge:......... I see. In that case, Miss Brett, I will now ask you to testify in your own words... ...about the events leading up to the death of the victim, Dr Wilson!Brett:.........Kazuma:So, we're finally going to hear her own words on the matter. Things are getting interesting, Ryunosuke!Witness Testimony- The Victim's 'Death' -Brett:Unfortunately, I have no idea when the poor man burnt his wrist like that.When the waiter brought my steak, the professor and I raised our glasses in a toast.As far as I've heard, the post-mortem report showed no other possible cause of death besides the gunshot.If there's some other way a man's life can been [sic] taken without leaving a trace, please, do show me.But of course...this country's inferior investigative techniques probably wouldn't pick up on it anyway.Judge:...That most captivating and beautiful testimony will go down in the Supreme Court's history. Thank you.Ryunosuke:(Easy does it...)Brett:I hope that this is the last time I will have to sully my lips with the coarse tones of your unbecoming tongue. Oh.... Forgive me. I do hope I haven't insulted anyone.Auchi:Not at all, not at all! It is a delight merely to hear you speak, dear lady! And it seems very clear from your testimony, that this boorish talk of the victim's burn is utterly irrelevant.Brett:I will be speaking to your country's Minister of Justice about what has happened here today.Auchi:The...Minister of Justice...?Brett:May that irritating little bully of a student be given the harshest punishment possible! ...Amen.Ryunosuke:Huh? ...Um, thanks? (Was, was that a prayer then?)Kazuma:Well you'll have to forgive the irritation, Miss Brett, and put up with a cross-examination now.Brett:...!Kazuma:I expect you've noticed that this 'little bully of a student', as you put it... ...doesn't miss much.Brett:.........Judge:I'm sure I don't need to remind you, Counsel, that this will be your final cross-examination in this trial. If you fail to demonstrate any problems with this witness's testimony... ...I will be ruling on the case immediately. Is that clear?Ryunosuke:......... Yes, Your Excellency.Judge:Then you may proceed with the cross-examination!Cross-Examination- The Victim's 'Death' -",

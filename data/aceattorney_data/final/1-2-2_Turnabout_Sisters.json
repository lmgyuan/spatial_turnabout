(Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:\nThank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:\nIf we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:\nWitness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:\nSir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nVery well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:\nAnd the cause of death?Gumshoe:\nLoss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of \"The Thinker\" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:\nThe court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:\n(They're still calling it a \"statue\"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nNow, Detective...Gumshoe:\nY-yes sir!Edgeworth:\nYou immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:\nHmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this \"hard evidence.\"Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!\nThere were two people there already:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!\nWhy? We had a witness account describing her!\nThe witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:\nHmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:\n(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:\nSomething the matter?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination",

Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?\nGumshoe:\nSure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!\nPhoenix:\nThis isn't a movie, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nOof!\nPhoenix:\nLet's talk about reality, shall we?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.\nPhoenix:\nDon't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?\nGumshoe:\nAh, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nStop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nPhoenix:\n(That didn't go so well...)\nGumshoe:\nTh-that's right! What he said!Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Phoenix:\n(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?Gumshoe:\nWh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?Phoenix:\nYou have it backwards, Detective.Gumshoe:\nB-backwards?Phoenix:\nThe victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. \"Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object.\" She died immediately!Gumshoe:\nBut...!Phoenix:\nNo \"but\"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!Judge:\nOrder! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?Phoenix:\nWh-when...!?The day of the murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.\nGumshoe:\nYou're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!\nPhoenix:\nOh. Right.\nLeads to:\n\"The prosecution's point being...?\"The day after the murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was the day after the murder...\nLeads to:\n\"The prosecution's point being...?\"I forget\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm... sorry, I forgot.\nEdgeworth:\nHah! Forgot, you say?\nGumshoe:\nIt was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally!\nPhoenix:\nOh. R-right.\nLeads to:\n\"The prosecution's point being...?\"Judge:\nThe prosecution's point being...?Edgeworth:\nThat autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nWh-what!?Edgeworth:\nA second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! \"Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow.\" I received these results this morning.Phoenix:\nN-no way!Edgeworth:\nYour Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write \"Maya\"! That is all.Judge:\nI see!Phoenix:\n(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)Edgeworth:\nWhy, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?You're a sham, Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution!\nEdgeworth:\nNo matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable.\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\"The detective's a sham!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I-I thought...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe.\nGumshoe:\nUrp!\nEdgeworth:\nI'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.\nGumshoe:\nEh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nYou are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.\nGumshoe:\nW-what? B-but... *sigh*\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\"I'm a sham!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe. Are you calling me a fool because I believed your report?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Me? I-I'm not... huh?\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe.\nGumshoe:\nUrp!\nEdgeworth:\nI'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.\nGumshoe:\nEh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nYou are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.\nGumshoe:\nW-what? B-but... *sigh*\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\"Edgeworth:\nYour Honor, I submit this report to the court.Judge:\nU-understood. The court accepts the evidence.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nWell, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.Judge:\nI suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.Phoenix:\n(Darn! This isn't good!)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!Judge:\nLet the witness Miss April May take the stand.Phoenix:\n(Exactly what part of her is \"innocent\"...?)Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name, please.April:\nApril May! At your service! *wink*Judge:\nOrder! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking! ([wanton] misspelled as [wonton] in the original release)April:\nAww... Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)Edgeworth:\nTell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?April:\nUm... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.Edgeworth:\nAnd this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?April:\nMmm... that's right, big boy.Judge:\nPlease testify to the court about what you saw.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:\nIt was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!\nAnd then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!\nThe one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!\nThen the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!\nBut that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!\nThen the woman with long hair...\nShe kinda... slumped.\nThe end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWell, Your Honor?Judge:\nI see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...Phoenix:\nW-wait, Your Honor!Judge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nWhat about my cross-examination!?Judge:\nI thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...Phoenix:\nH-hey! How dare you!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?Yes, I'm doing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!)\nLeads to:\n\"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!\"No thanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point.\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-what? That's it!?)\nJudge:\nVery well.\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! Hold on!\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?\nPhoenix:\nYes yes yes!

That's lame!]Mia:\n[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]...[September 5, 9:27 AM]Cellular:*beep*Phoenix:\nYour Honor, I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded, (Changed from [I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone...] in the original release) which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel! (Changed from [and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!] in the original release)April:\nMuh... muh... muh!?Phoenix:\nWell, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?April:\n... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*Judge:\nSo the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?Yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\"No\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!)\nJudge:\nThen, the court would like--\nPhoenix:\nHold on! P-please wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nY-yes...? So you do have an objection?\nPhoenix:\nUm, yes, well...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Your Honor, it's just...\nLeads to:\n\"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\"Phoenix:\nThe witness claims she had \"seen it before.\" But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!Judge:\nWell then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.Present The Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's simple.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere is undeniable proof!\nEdgeworth:\nHah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece!\nJudge:\nHmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind?\nLeads back to:\n\"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.\"Phoenix:\nIt's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!April:\nW-whaaat!?Phoenix:\nA friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!April:\nI-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!Phoenix:\nMiss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?April:\nMmpf...Phoenix:\nOh? Excuses not on sale today?April:\nOooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!Judge:\nW-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!April:\nHrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*Phoenix:\n(S-scary...)Judge:\nMiss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?April:\n...Judge:\nHmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?Phoenix:\n(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...You held it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! When was this!?\nPhoenix:\nWhen she used it to strike the victim! When else?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nApril May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made \"The Thinker\" ring! That's when you heard it!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\nW-what's that supposed to mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt was you who just proved that \"The Thinker\" was empty!\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(S-she can't prove it! She did it!)\nApril:\nIt would be MY pleasure!\nPhoenix:\nN-no way!\nApril:\nYes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!\nEdgeworth:\nIncidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know \"The Thinker\" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!\nJudge:\nWell... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that already.\nPhoenix:\nTake another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]\nMia:\n[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]\nMaya:\n[Again? What's it this time?]\nMia:\n[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!]\n\n...\n\nJudge:\nThey do mention \"The Thinker.\" But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\n\n\n\nPresent Wiretap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Have a look at this.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Your evidence, please!\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave a look at this.\nApril:\nAh! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...\nPhoenix:\nI found this in Miss May's room.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!\nPhoenix:\nMiss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!?\nApril:\nI... I...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is ridiculous!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.\nApril:\nLa... laaa... lrrrrgf!\nJudge:\nWitness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?\nApril:\n...\nJudge:\nMiss May!\nApril:\nShut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!\n......\nApril:\nI-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\n(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)\n\n\n\nYou did it, didn't you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMiss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?\nApril:\nAre you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\"\n\n\n\n\nWhy the wiretap?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMiss May... Why did you tap her phone?\nApril:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nApril:\nDo I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?\nPhoenix:\n(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"!\nJudge:\nWhile this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?\nApril:\nAt the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent Wiretap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHave a look at this.\nApril:\nAh! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...\nPhoenix:\nI found this in Miss May's room.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!\nPhoenix:\nMiss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?\nApril:\nOooh. Oooooh!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, This is irrelevant!\nJudge:\nI'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.\nEdgeworth:\nThis is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?\nPhoenix:\nAbsolutely!\nEdgeworth:\nEven if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWHAAAAT!?\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I present the defendant's cell phone.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis! I think...\nJudge:\nThat's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! That was just a warm up!\nJudge:\nHmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI present the defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that.\nPhoenix:\nListen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia!

Maybe that wasn't the thing...)\nJudge:\nI'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again:\nLeads back to:\n\"How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?\"You had heard about it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock!\nJudge:\nShe \"heard\"...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known \"The Thinker\" was a clock! And I can show you the proof!\nJudge:\nWell, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had \"heard\" the murder weapon was a clock.\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that already.\nPhoenix:\nTake another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia!

Ask the bellboy! *wink*\nEdgeworth:\nErgo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!\nPhoenix:\n!\nJudge:\nSo, where does that leave us...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!\nPhoenix:\n(No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is my evidence!\nJudge:\nI'm afraid I'm not sure where you are going with all of this, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm... \"where\"? Well, it's not so much a place as a... er...\nEdgeworth:\nCome to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, this court does not condone the presentation of evidence for \"practice.\" Let's see your evidence, for real this time, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"Show me evidence proving that the witness had \"heard\" the murder weapon was a clock.\"Judge:\nWell, does the defense have anything to say?Phoenix:\nUm, well... (Come on, think of something!)Call the bellboy as a witness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it!\nApril:\nI think you've sunken quite low enough already.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI object to calling the bellboy!\nPhoenix:\nW-why? What's your reason?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness.\nPhoenix:\nCondition...?\nEdgeworth:\nIf Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of \"guilty\" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition.\nPhoenix:\n(What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared \"guilty\" on the spot! What should I do...?)\n\n\n\nAccept the condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh!) Uh... um, wait...\nLeads to:\n\"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\"\n\n\n\n\nGive up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Grr! I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness.\nJudge:\nI see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nRight. On with the cross-examination.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)\nJudge:\nThen I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?\nEdgeworth:\nNone, Your Honor. She's the last.\nPhoenix:\n(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense would like to call the bellboy after all!\nEdgeworth:\n... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\nMay I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced \"guilty\"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!\nLeads to:\n\"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!\"Continue examining Miss May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nRight.

He certainly does look like a bellboy.Bellboy:\nYes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service.Judge:\nThat tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony.Bellboy:\nVery good, sir!Witness Testimony-- Miss May's Room Service --Bellboy:\nI am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!\nI believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.\nShe asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.\nI brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.\nAnd I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Judge:\nI see. The defense may begin its cross-examination.Phoenix:\nR-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!)Cross Examination",

I've been great! I'm finally getting used to having my own place.Mia:That's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.???:I know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you?Mia:Sharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.???:I gotcha. So, what is it this time?Mia:It's... a clock.???:A clock?Mia:Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.???:Hey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!Mia:Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.???:Huh? It's not working? That's lame!Mia:I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.???:Papers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.Mia:Can you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then.???:Okay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger.Mia:Okay, okay.

I should have been more careful.???:Ho hoh. My dear Miss Fey... I am so very sorry. But I am afraid I must ask you for one more thing. Your eternal silence... Farewell, Miss Fey.Mia:!!!Red... White... Blue...Episode 2Turnabout SistersSeptember 5, 9:08 PMFey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:Uh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!)ExamineAnywherePhoenix:I smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay!Phoenix:That smell... Blood!???:... *sob* Sis...Phoenix:(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?Chief!!!Phoenix:Who are you????:...Phoenix:(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:Chief...ExamineBroken glassPhoenix:Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.ChairPhoenix:The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.Mia Fey's bodyPhoenix:Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. \"The Thinker\" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.The Thinker added to the Court Record.Phoenix:Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.Glass Shards added to the Court Record.Phoenix:Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?Mia Fey's body (subsequent times)Phoenix:It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.\"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices)Phoenix:! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday.Receipt added to the Court Record.Phoenix:(I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.)\"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; after clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices)Phoenix:!

How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.WindowPhoenix:There's a large building right across from the office. The \"Gatewater Hotel.\" A nice, luxurious place.BookshelfPhoenix:All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.ComputerPhoenix:Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.DeskPhoenix:A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office d\u00e9cor: \"Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple.\"Ledger bookPhoenix:The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.Corded phonePhoenix:Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.???:Police!? Please, come quick!Phoenix:(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...Corded phone (subsequent times)Phoenix:The phone receiver is missing a few screws.

So Mia was writing this girl's name! Maybe I should show her the receipt? I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom!)ExamineBookshelfPhoenix:You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant.DoorPhoenix:The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob.PaintingPhoenix:A large painting. I guess you'd call this \"modern art.\" I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.Reception deskPhoenix:The reception desk. I usually sit here.SofaPhoenix:This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model.Writing deskPhoenix:A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies.TalkWhat happenedPhoenix:(She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened?Maya:... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...!Phoenix:(So she was already dead.)You and the ChiefPhoenix:So, you're the chief's...?Maya:Sister. I'm her younger sister.Phoenix:And you were here... visiting? This late at night?Maya:Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her.Phoenix:Evidence...?Maya:Yes... I-it was that clock... It was \"The Thinker.\"PresentThe ThinkerPhoenix:Um, about \"The Thinker\"...Maya:! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob*Phoenix:(Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...)Glass ShardsPhoenix:This was lying next to the chief.Maya:I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand.Phoenix:Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...)Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office)Phoenix:Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.Maya:! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?Phoenix:Please, just calm down.Maya:W-why would Sis write my name?Phoenix:(Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!)Receipt (after examining corded phone in Office)Phoenix:Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood.

Now I've done it...)Anything elseMaya:I'm sorry, I've never seen that before.After examining corded phone in Office and presenting Receipt in Fey & Co. Law Offices:*whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*...Phoenix:! The police! (Sounds like they're coming this way!)Freeze! Police!Gumshoe:Alright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see?Phoenix:(Gumshoe...? What an odd name.)Gumshoe:We received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder.Phoenix:(It must have been that woman I saw.)Gumshoe:Anyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay?Phoenix:(Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.)Gumshoe:Whoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me!Maya:Eek!Gumshoe:This word \"Maya\" here mean anything to you?Maya:...! Um... that... That's my name...Gumshoe:WHAAAAT!? The victim drew this here note in her own blood, see? With her dying breath, she wrote down the killer's name!Maya:K-killer...? I'm not--Gumshoe:Case closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am.Maya:W-what?Phoenix:Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)Maya:Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.Phoenix:Good morning! (She looks so tired...)Maya:Um... Are you going to be my attorney?Phoenix:Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...It's up to youPhoenix:(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.Maya:Up... to me?Phoenix:Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.Maya:... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!Leads to:\"Did I look at her like that?\"Of course I willPhoenix:(First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up!Maya:R-really...?Phoenix:(Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it?Maya:... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!Leads to:\"Did I look at her like that?\"Sorry, not a chancePhoenix:(Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding...Maya:... ... ...Phoenix:(Eh heh. Whoops. That didn't go so well.)Maya:...Heh...Phoenix:Huh? M-Maya...? Was that a... chuckle?Maya:What? N-no! ... It wasn't very believable, was it?Phoenix:(Not really...)Maya:I-I'm sorry! I just thought, since you'd made a joke... Please, don't mind me! You're doing just fine!Phoenix:(Who's trying to cheer up who here!?)Maya:... I knew it. No one will believe me.Phoenix:What?Maya:Even you-- when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!Leads to:\"Did I look at her like that?\"Phoenix:(Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought...Maya:I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you.Phoenix:Heard...? Heard what about me?Maya:I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day...Mia:\"Today was my junior partner's first time in court.\"Maya:Wow! Really? How'd that go?Mia:\"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while...\"Maya:Hah! So, he crashed and burned?Mia:\"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience.\"Maya:Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!Mia:\"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty.\"Maya:That's what she said!Phoenix:...Maya:I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you...Phoenix:No, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia...Maya:... I know...ExamineSecurity cameraPhoenix:Smile for the camera...Security guardPhoenix:This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy.TalkMayaPhoenix:There's something I've been wanting to ask you...Maya:Yes?Phoenix:What's with that outfit?Maya:Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.Phoenix:A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?Maya:Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.Phoenix:A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)The day of the crimePhoenix:Could you tell me about the day of the murder?Maya:Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.Phoenix:Evidence?Maya:Yes. That clock shaped like \"The Thinker.\"Phoenix:(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?Maya:Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?Phoenix:H-her own voice!?Maya:Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.Phoenix:You recorded it!Maya:Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things.The day of the crime (after clearing \"Your cell phone\" Talk option)Phoenix:Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.Maya:No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.Phoenix:(That's \"The Thinker\" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?Maya:It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...Phoenix:Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.Your cell phone (appears after \"The day of the crime\")Phoenix:So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!Maya:Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.Phoenix:Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.Maya:I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?Phoenix:Sure, thanks.Maya's Memo added to the Court Record.Your cell phone (subsequent times)Phoenix:So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone?

A, er, medium-in-training.Maya:That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.Phoenix:Wait a second, you said the \"Fey Family\"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?Maya:Of course! She left the mountain to \"follow her career,\" she said. Her powers were first-class, too!Phoenix:(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!Maya:What?Phoenix:So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?Maya:Yes. ...In training.Phoenix:Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!Maya:...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level...Phoenix:(Hmm... I thought that would be too easy.)PresentThe ThinkerPhoenix:I wanted to ask you about the murder weapon...Maya:Poor Sis... *sniff*Phoenix:(Hmm. Better not ask her about this now.)Glass ShardsPhoenix:This was lying next to the chief's body...Maya:I saw that too. They said they thought these were pieces of a broken light stand.Phoenix:Yeah, that seems about right. (Though I'd never heard of a glass light stand before this...)ReceiptPhoenix:Remember that receipt?Maya:Y-you mean the one with my name on it?Phoenix:Any idea why she...Maya:Absolutely none! Um... Do you trust me?I trust youPhoenix:I trust you.Maya:Why? Don't you think I did it, too?Phoenix:No, I don't. (It's just a hunch, but...)Maya:That detective thinks I did it.Phoenix:...Leads back to Court RecordI don't trust youPhoenix:...Maya:I didn't think you'd believe me. You're just like the detective.Phoenix:I'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it! (She seemed so lost at the crime scene.)Leads back to Court RecordMaya's MemoPhoenix:I wanted to ask you about your cell phone...Maya:That detective took it when they brought me in.Phoenix:(So, Gumshoe took it... I'll have to try to get it back next time I see him...)Anything elseMaya:Sorry... I've never seen that before.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:... Um...!Phoenix:Huh? Something the matter?Maya:Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor?Phoenix:...?Maya:This is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me?Phoenix:(Hmm...)AcceptPhoenix:Sure, why not? I'll go ask.Maya:Thank you so much! I have no one else to turn to...Phoenix:...? Say, what about your parents...?Maya:... ... ...Phoenix:I... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me.Maya:Thank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00.Phoenix:W-what!? Tomorrow!?Maya:Tomorrow.Phoenix:What if this guy refuses!?Leads to:\"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\"RefusePhoenix:I'm sorry... I think this is the kind of thing you should really do yourself.Maya:...You're right. ...Phoenix:Something wrong?Maya:Actually, I asked the police to contact him, and they tried calling a few times. Nobody could get a hold of him!Phoenix:They couldn't find him?Maya:I have no one left to ask!Phoenix:...? Say, what about your parents...?Maya:... ... ...Phoenix:O-okay! Don't worry, I'll go ask him for you.Maya:Y-you will? Thank you so much!Phoenix:I'm just worried what will happen if I can't find him.Leads to:\"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\"Maya:They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.Phoenix:When will that happen?Maya:They're giving me until 4:00 this afternoon.Phoenix:(And visiting hours are almost up... I'd better hurry!) Right, I'll be back!September 6Fey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:(The office is filled with police officers. They're all busily searching for clues...)???:Hey! You there! This is a crime scene, pal! No trespassing! Umm... Sorry, don't I know you from somewhere? Wait, you're that Butz guy, aren't you!Phoenix:No, no, Phoenix Wright. (How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?)???:Ah, guess I got the wrong name, Mr. Wright. Sorry 'bout that. That Butz guy, he was a killer! And you're no killer! Right?Phoenix:(He WAS proven innocent...) Umm... right. And you were...Detective GumshoePhoenix:Um... Gumshoe, wasn't it? Dick Gumshoe????:Right! At your service. Hang on!

And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\"Gumshoe:Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...Police:Hey, Dick! Get over here!Gumshoe:Y-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick!Phoenix:(Whew! He thinks I'm Maya's lawyer...!)ExamineBookshelfPhoenix:There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is that Mia probably read all of these.HouseplantPhoenix:Mia's favorite potted plant. I remember it had this bizarre name no one could ever remember.???:\"Cordyline stricta,\" pal!Phoenix:(Who was that!?)Mia's deskPhoenix:Mia's desk. Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia.Movie posterPhoenix:An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days.WindowPhoenix:The sky is blue, and so am I... There's that hotel, right across the way.TalkMiaPhoenix:About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy?Gumshoe:Hmm? You want to know the results, eh?Phoenix:...Gumshoe:Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all!Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Mia (subsequent times)Phoenix:So, Mia's death was instantaneous.Gumshoe:That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.Phoenix:You knew her, Detective?Gumshoe:Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.MayaPhoenix:Um, about Maya...Gumshoe:Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!Phoenix:W-why do you say that?Gumshoe:The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!Phoenix:(Edgeworth...)Gumshoe:I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.Edgeworth (appears after \"Maya\")Phoenix:Prosecutor Edgeworth...Gumshoe:That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?Of course I do!Phoenix:I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his \"guilty\" verdict.Gumshoe:Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.Phoenix:(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)Leads to:\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"Of course not!Phoenix:Never heard of him.Gumshoe:Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!Phoenix:(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a \"guilty\" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)Leads to:\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"Phoenix:(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...)PresentThe ThinkerPhoenix:I was wondering, do you know anything about this?Gumshoe:That statue? That's the murder weapon.Phoenix:(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)Glass ShardsPhoenix:There was broken glass at the crime scene, right?Gumshoe:Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.ReceiptPhoenix:There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?Gumshoe:Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!Phoenix:Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself?Gumshoe:Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.Phoenix:(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)Maya's MemoPhoenix:I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?Gumshoe:Oh that? I have that.Phoenix:Do you think you could give it back?Gumshoe:Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!Phoenix:(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)Tell him straightPhoenix:(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)Gumshoe:Something the matter?Phoenix:Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!Gumshoe:Nope. I know nothing, pal!Phoenix:That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!Gumshoe:Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!Phoenix:Impressive! You're quite the detective.Gumshoe:Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.Leads to:\"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\"Tell him not-so-straightPhoenix:(Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?)Gumshoe:Something the matter?Phoenix:Oh, no, um...

She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct.Gumshoe:That what she said?Phoenix:Um. Yes.Gumshoe:... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway.

Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you!After clearing \"Mia\" and \"Maya\" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo:Phoenix:(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)Gumshoe:You all done, pal?Phoenix:Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.Gumshoe:Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!Phoenix:... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?Gumshoe:Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.Gumshoe:You got that right, pal!Phoenix:(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)September 6Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:(According to the receptionist, the big boss is \"out\". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)ExamineBookshelfPhoenix:Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.DeskPhoenix:A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.PaintingPhoenix:That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.Potted plantPhoenix:An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.TablePhoenix:A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Maya:Hey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?Phoenix:Sorry. I haven't seen him yet.Maya:I see...Phoenix:(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)TalkYour familyPhoenix:What about your family?Maya:I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.Phoenix:(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)Your mother (appears after \"Your family\")Maya:The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.Phoenix:(\"Ruined\"...?)Maya:After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would \"become a lawyer\" and she left the mountain.Phoenix:... So, you live by yourself?Maya:Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)Phoenix:(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)Your mother's enemy (appears after \"Your mother\")Phoenix:So, who was this man who, um, \"ruined\" your mother?Maya:About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...Phoenix:Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?Maya:The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.Phoenix:Wow... So, what happened?Maya:The case was solved... we thought.Phoenix:You \"thought\"...?Maya:The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.Phoenix:...!Maya:The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.Phoenix:I see.Maya:... White...Phoenix:Excuse me? White?Maya:That was his name. My sister told me.Phoenix:White? Hmm...PresentMaya's Cell PhonePhoenix:Hey, I got your cell phone back.Maya:Oh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice?Phoenix:... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ...Maya:Thank you.September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303April:Well! Hello there, handsome.Phoenix:Umm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)April:You're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, \"Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!\" Tee hee!Phoenix:(Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.)April:Gee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness!Phoenix:(I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.)ExamineBedPhoenix:A simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here.FlowersPhoenix:The flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge.Open drawerLeads to:\"There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.\"PaintingPhoenix:Ah. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be \"still life\"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall.TablePhoenix:A bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her.WindowPhoenix:The late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though.Phoenix:(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)April:Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?Phoenix:(Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?)ExamineOpen drawerPhoenix:(Hmm... what's inside I wonder?)April:*cough* *cough*Phoenix:(Maybe later...)TalkWhat you witnessedPhoenix:Do you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident.April:Ooh. \"Observe,\" \"incident\"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary.Phoenix:(Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please?April:Let me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:(Oh boy.)Miss MayPhoenix:Um, could you... just who exactly are you?April:Oooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me?Phoenix:N-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here!April:Tee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush.Phoenix:(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do?April:Well... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you!Phoenix:(Oh boy.)This roomPhoenix:I see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you?April:Oooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television!Phoenix:Oh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer!April:Say, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph!Phoenix:(Oh boy.)PresentAnythingApril:Excuse me, but I'm a witness? Police witness? You understand? How could I possibly give you any information in good conscience, hmm? Me... \"the witness\"! It's just like the movie!Grossberg Law Offices (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Phoenix:(Hmm... seems like Mr. Grossberg is out. Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.)???:*Ah-HHHHEM!*Phoenix:(If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!)Grossberg:Ah hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me?Phoenix:Uh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!)Grossberg:Hmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now?Phoenix:Y-yes, well... yes.Grossberg:And what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed!Phoenix:(Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?)Grossberg:Hmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it!Phoenix:Um... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey.Grossberg:...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on.Phoenix:(Hmm? Why the strange reaction?)Grossberg:A-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible.Phoenix:W-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!?Grossberg:Urk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion.Phoenix:(What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?)TalkYour refusalPhoenix:How can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case!Grossberg:Hmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see!Phoenix:But the client is Mia Fey's sister!Grossberg:Hmm... ahem.Phoenix:Mia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands.Grossberg:Yes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye.Phoenix:Creep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.Grossberg:*grumble*... Think not.Phoenix:Huh? Did you say something?Grossberg:I think not, I said.Phoenix:Wh-what do you mean?Grossberg:I'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy.Phoenix:Why!?Grossberg:I... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you.Phoenix:(What's going on here!?)MiaPhoenix:How did you know Mia Fey...?Grossberg:... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see.Phoenix:A \"mission\"?Grossberg:You could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one.That paintingPhoenix:That's... quite a painting.Grossberg:Ahah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!Phoenix:(I wasn't interested...)Grossberg:It's not for sale!Phoenix:I'm not buying! (Geez!)PresentAnythingGrossberg:Very sorry, but I've got nothing to say regarding this matter.Fey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:... (Looks like Detective Gumshoe has gone home. The police are still keeping themselves busy in the chief's office. No one has time to talk to me. Guess I'll head out.)ExamineHouseplantPhoenix:Mia's favorite potted plant. I guess I'll have to water it now...Detention Center (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303, then visitng Grossberg Law Offices)Phoenix:Hmm... Maya's not here. She must be in questioning. They probably won't let her out for a while. Maybe I'd better go talk to that lawyer again.After clearing all Talk options in Grossberg Law Offices:September 6, 3:42 PMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:Hiya.Maya:Oh! You're back! Did you find the lawyer?Phoenix:Um... well... (What do I tell her?) Well, see... (Just be honest!) I... I really don't think you should use that guy. He... didn't seem healthy. He was all skin and bones!Maya:... What really happened?Phoenix:...Maya:You don't mean... He refused to help?Phoenix:Urp.Maya:... I see. I've been abandoned, then.After clearing \"Your mother's enemy\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, if all Talk options have been cleared in Grossberg Law OfficesLeads to:\"Just a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess...\"Maya:Just a little longer now before the state-appointed lawyer comes, I guess...Phoenix:... (4:00 PM. Time's up. What should I do? Do I just leave her and go home...?)Go homePhoenix:(There's nothing left here for me to do... She'll be better off with a state-appointed lawyer.) I think I'd better get home now.Maya:Good-bye.Phoenix:It was a few days later when I found out how the story ended. The result of the trial was in the newspaper. \"Guilty.\" I'll probably never meet her again. Did I make the right choice? Will I ever know? Mia... if you can hear me, please, tell me! ...Phoenix:Not! I can't let that happen! I'm not leaving here until she takes me as her lawyer!Leads to:\"I've made up my mind!\"Defend MayaLeads to:\"I've made up my mind!\"Phoenix:I've made up my mind!

You can count on me.\"Someone else is the culpritPhoenix:You aren't the culprit! Someone else is!Maya:H-how do you know?Phoenix:I, um, I have a hunch... (Given the evidence, it would be easy to assume that Maya was the killer. But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya...Leads to:\"I won't abandon you. You can count on me.\"I don't know whyPhoenix:To be honest, I don't know.Maya:You don't know?Phoenix:(Is this girl sitting in front of me the killer? All the evidence seems to say \"yes.\" But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act?

That's so kind of you... *sniff*... ...Phoenix:Well! Let's fight this one and get you out of here!Maya:R-right! Thank you!Phoenix:(Whew, she smiled at last. She looks like an entirely different person!) One last question... You are innocent, right?Maya:Yes! And I trust you... So you trust me, too, okay?Phoenix:It's a deal. (So, what next... There's something that's been bugging me... Just what was inside that strange woman's drawer? It was when I tried to look into the drawer that she got all defensive. There has to be something in there!)Gatewater HotelBellboy:Good afternoon, sir!Phoenix:Excuse me, you are...?Bellboy:Ah, I beg your pardon, sir! I am the bellboy of this establishment, at your service, sir.Phoenix:Oh, right.Bellboy:I've just come up to deliver room service, sir.Phoenix:Um... do you know where Miss May might be?Bellboy:Ah. I believe our guest Miss May is currently using the, er, facilities...? If you've no need of anything, I'll be taking my leave. Please, stay as long as you like. Enjoy...Phoenix:Yeah... Wait... no! Hey! ... (Why does it seem like every time I come here, I end up embarrassing myself? Wait... now's my chance to snoop around a bit!)Bellboy:Ah, I almost forgot!Phoenix:Gah! Y-you came back quick!Bellboy:Might I ask you to inform Miss May that there is a message for her? Please tell her that Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned.Phoenix:Oh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?)Maya:White... That was his name. My sister told me.Phoenix:(\"White\" was the name of the guy who ruined Mia and Maya's mother! Could it be a coincidence?)ExamineOpen drawerLeads to:\"There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer.\"Phoenix:There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer. Now's my chance to see what's inside! ...! What do we have here! A... wiretap? Hmm! What would a woman like her be doing with a thing like this?Wiretap added to the Court Record.Phoenix:There is definitely something suspicious about this \"Miss May\"! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean.April:Oh, bellboy...? Still there?Phoenix:(Uh oh, time to scram!

Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...You held itPhoenix:(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!Judge:Mr. Wright! When was this!?Phoenix:When she used it to strike the victim! When else?Judge:Order! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?Phoenix:April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made \"The Thinker\" ring!

Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!Edgeworth:Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!Judge:Mr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!Phoenix:S-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know \"The Thinker\" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock!

I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally.Phoenix:Are you always so... so prim?Judge:Mr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...Bellboy:I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone?Bellboy:Absolutely, sir.Phoenix:H-how can you be so certain!?Bellboy:I checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir.Judge:Yes, what then?Bellboy:She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:9:00 \"on the dot,\" you say?Bellboy:Yes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir.Phoenix:(9:00... the time of the murder!)Bellboy:I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:\"Precisely\" 9:00, then?Bellboy:Precisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM.Phoenix:How can you be so sure!?Bellboy:Miss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. \"Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!\" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.Phoenix:(Why would she be so particular about the time?)Bellboy:And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You are sure it was Miss April May herself?Bellboy:Ab-SO-lutely, sir.Phoenix:\"Ab-SO-lutely\"...?Bellboy:Yes, sir. As in, \"so very absolutely,\" sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.Phoenix:How come you're so very certain!?Bellboy:Well, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an \"embrasser,\" sir.Phoenix:\"Embrasser\"!? Is that French for \"embrace\"?Bellboy:It's French for \"kiss,\" sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.Phoenix:Wh-why would she have done that...?Bellboy:I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.Phoenix:(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)Phoenix:(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony!

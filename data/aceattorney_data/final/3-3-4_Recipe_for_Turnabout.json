This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.\nI-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me!\nJudge:\nThe evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee.\nNo! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me?\nPayne:\nWell... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!?\nJudge:\nThis court finds the defendant...\nGuilty\nJudge:\nThe court is adjourned.\nJanuary 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nAhh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world!\nPhoenix:\nI bet it does, Maya.\nMaya:\nSo! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think?\nPhoenix:\nSure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake.\nMaya:\nNever! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game.\n???:\nHEY, PAL!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe...\nMaya:\nHappy New Year, Detective!\nGumshoe:\nUh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA...\nMaya:\nHere's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation!\nGumshoe:\nUm... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO...\nMaya:\nHave you got a holiday present for me, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nA what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but...\nMaya:\nYay! Thanks!\nGumshoe:\nLOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT!\nMaya:\nHey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you?\nGumshoe:\nAh... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose?\nMaya:\nHa ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year?\nGumshoe:\nVery funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it? A magazine?\nMaya:\nHey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\"\nPhoenix:\nTr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!?\nGumshoe:\nIt's a report, pal. About you!\nMaya:\nListen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\"\nGumshoe:\nWELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month.\nMaya:\nWhich makes it old news, you mean.\nPhoenix:\nBut I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December!\nMaya:\nHmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick?\nGumshoe:\nIf it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility...\nMaya:\nNo way. You don't mean...\nPhoenix:\nA pho...\nMaya:\nA phony Nick!?\nPhoenix:\n(This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...)\nMagazine Clipping added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nSO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean, what am I going to do about it?\nMaya:\nWell, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case!\nPhoenix:\nMy fault!? How do you figure that?\nMaya:\nBecause THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of...\nGumshoe:\nYeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves?\nPhoenix:\n(But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...)\nGumshoe:\nYou better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it?\nMaya:\nSounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto!\nPhoenix:\nI don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned.\nMaya:\n... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?)\nExamine\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while.\nCharley the plant\nPhoenix:\nCharley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nIt's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it.\nMovie poster\nPhoenix:\nAn old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days.\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too?\nTalk\nWhat to do\nMaya:\nSo, what's our first move?\nPhoenix:\nI guess we go down to the detention center and talk--\nMaya:\nWait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right?\nPhoenix:\nHey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this!\nMaya:\nHmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean.\nPhoenix:\n(I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?)\nMaya:\nAh! Nick! I've got it!\nPhoenix:\nIf you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no.\nMaya:\n...Spoilsport.\nAny ideas\nMaya:\nDid you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nMaya:\nI mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange.\nMaya:\nMaybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya...\nMaya:\nWell, if he wasn't nervous because of you...\nPhoenix:\n...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client?\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nSo you've still got that badge, I see.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I?\nMaya:\nYeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job.\nPhoenix:\n(...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.)\nMagazine Clipping\nMaya:\nI can't believe you've got an impersonator.\nPhoenix:\nI can't either. *sigh*\nMaya:\nAww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them!\nPhoenix:\nThis isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result.\nMaya:\n...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.)\nMaya Fey profile\nPhoenix:\nSo? How's your spirit medium training going?\nMaya:\nWell... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day.\nPhoenix:\n...That's called \"taking a shower\". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall?\nMaya:\nWell, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...)\nMia Fey profile\nPhoenix:\nMia helped me out in court again last time.\nMaya:\nIt's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that.\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nMaya:\nWe mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis...\nPhoenix:\n...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her?\nMaya:\nNo... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.)\nGodot profile\nMaya:\nSo you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh?\nPhoenix:\nI already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much.\nMaya:\nWell he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter.\nPhoenix:\nYou're just making that up, Maya!\nDick Gumshoe profile\nMaya:\nDigging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it?\nPhoenix:\nNo. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him.\nMaya:\nYeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears!\nPhoenix:\n(Did you mean he \"gets paid dirt\" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?)\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nDo you know anything about this, Maya?\nMaya:\nHmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object.\nPhoenix:\n(A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...)\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nDo you know anything about this person?\nMaya:\nHmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual.\nPhoenix:\n(A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...)\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nMaya:\nIt's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like Gumshoe isn't around.\nMaya:\nHe's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work!\nPhoenix:\nNo, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case.\nMaya:\nGuess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh?\nPhoenix:\nAfter being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label...\nExamine\nDetective on left\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nDetective:\n\"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!\" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key.\nPhoenix:\n... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess?\nDesks\nPhoenix:\nThese are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.\nPoster\nPhoenix:\nA poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad.\nChief\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.\nChief:\nWHAT! Mask\u2606DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? \"Hands up, you scalawags!\" \"You're under arrest!\" Hey! That's our job!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Ron DeLite's opted for a new career.)\nDetective:\nQuit surfing the net, Chief!\nChief:\nS-Sorry... I was just, um...\nPhoenix:\n(Things feel pretty tense in here...)\nBadgers\nMaya:\nHey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute!\nChief:\nThat's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force!\nPhoenix:\nSo what's with the pink one? It's new, right?\nMaya:\nShe's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\", right Chief?\nChief:\nYup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\".\nMaya:\nSo one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"?\nChief:\nYou got it! They're both married.\nMaya:\nUmm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief.\nChief:\nYou got it! That's marriage for you!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...)\nJanuary 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nThis is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...?\nPhoenix:\nK-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me!\n???:\nAaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying.\nPhoenix:\nA-Aren't... you...\n???:\nYes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down!\nMaya:\nAah! You're... Are you...?\n???\nDon't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde!\nPhoenix:\nMaggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt--\nByrde:\nOh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!?\nMaya:\nYou better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick.\nByrde:\nO-Oh... I see...\nPhoenix:\nSo that's where we stand right now.\nMaya:\nI'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder...\nByrde:\nMy whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures.\nPhoenix:\n(I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...)\nByrde:\nBut I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir!\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera.\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. I bet they don't get too many waitresses in here. He looks like he's getting a bit restless.\nTalk\nMaggey Byrde\nMaya:\nSo, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform.\nByrde:\nHmph. I was fired after that... incident last year.\nMaya:\nOh. I'm sorry.\nByrde:\nIt's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on.\nMaya:\nSo, what do you do now?\nByrde:\nIn the second act of \"The Life of Maggey Byrde\", I'm playing the role of a waitress!\nMaya:\nA waitress!?\nByrde:\nYes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir.\nPhoenix:\nAnd then you got into this mess straight away, right?\nByrde:\nYeah, you could put it that way...\nWhat happened\nByrde:\nThis whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nMaya:\n\"Treh Bee-an\"...?\nByrde:\nYes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included!\nMaya:\nOh...\nByrde:\nThere were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out.\nMaya:\nHey, hold on there, Maggey.\nByrde:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nYou keep calling the guy, \"the victim\". Didn't you know the guy who was killed?\nByrde:\nNot at all! I'd never even seen the guy before!\nMaya:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\n(So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right?\nByrde:\nOf course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele.\nPhoenix:\nSo, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come?\nByrde:\n......... You tell me, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nAck! (Guess the answer to my question is \"my phony\"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.)\nGuilty verdict (appears after \"What happened\")\nMaya:\nSo, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted?\nByrde:\nBecause no one else saw.\nMaya:\nSaw what?\nByrde:\nThe other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. \"The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time.\"\nPhoenix:\nBut how's that possible?\nByrde:\nI don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job!\nPhoenix:\nLook! That wasn't me, OK?\nByrde:\nAnd then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket.\nMaya:\nWhat?\nByrde:\nA small bottle... of poison.\nMaya:\nWHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!?\nByrde:\nWell, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious.\nPhoenix:\nAnd no one else saw this other guy?\nByrde:\nNo, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him...\nThe other guy (appears after \"Guilty verdict\")\nByrde:\nI was the one who took the coffee to the two men.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh...? And what was your impression of them?\nByrde:\nWell... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry.\nMaya:\nIn music? How come?\nByrde:\nWell, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir.\nMaya:\nAn earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all?\nByrde:\nIt had a band's name written on it. I think it was \"MC\"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess.\nPhoenix:\nSo it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc?\nMaya:\nMaybe it was \"MC Screwdriver\"!\nPhoenix:\nGet serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that?\nByrde:\nNngh... What was the name of that group again...? \"MC Hacksaw...\"? No... \"MC...\"\nMaya:\nAnd what about the killer? What did he look like?\nByrde:\nWell, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nByrde:\nThat badge! Is it real?\nPhoenix:\nOf course it's real!\nByrde:\nThat's what they all say. But I've been duped before. Give it to me for a sec!\nPhoenix:\nAh...!\n...*chomp!*\nMaya:\nShe... She bit into it...\nByrde:\nAnd I left a few teeth marks, too!\nPhoenix:\nI can see that...\nByrde:\nI just wish I could remember if that means it's real or a fake.\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* (I said it was real!)\nMagazine Clipping\nPhoenix:\nOh, yeah. I need to ask you about this...\nByrde:\nHey! This article's about my case!\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me?\nByrde:\nYes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits.\nPhoenix:\nMe?\nByrde:\nYes, you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nArgh...\nMaya:\nHey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too?\nByrde:\nNo. I don't remember a phony you, Maya.\nMaya:\nOh... *sigh* It would've been so cool...\nByrde:\nThen you got really worked up and passionate. \"I'm gonna get you' cleared'a dis crime!\" you said. (Changed from ['I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!' you said.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nOK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me?\nByrde:\n... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange...\nPhoenix:\nOnly a little?\nByrde:\nWell, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And...\nPhoenix:\nSo the guy was nothing like me, then!?\nByrde:\nBut he had your spiky hair and blue suit.\nPhoenix:\n(... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?)\nMaya:\nHow about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter?\nByrde:\nEveryone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir.\nMaya:\nThis case just keeps getting weirder and weirder...\nMaya Fey profile\nByrde:\nThanks for your help last year!\nMaya:\nAw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook.\nByrde:\nI hope you can help me out this year, too!\nMaya:\nYeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned.\nDick Gumshoe profile\nByrde:\nOh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force!\nPhoenix:\nHave you seen him recently?\nByrde:\nNo. He's never been to the restaurant.\nMaya:\nGuess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all.\nByrde:\nYeah, he prefers the simple things in life.\nPhoenix:\n(...Or he's just simply too poor to afford anything else.)\nMaggey Byrde profile\nByrde:\nNo matter what happens, I never let anything get me down!\nMaya:\nYou're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey?\nByrde:\nMacho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand!\nMaya:\nWow! All those phrases are named after you?\nByrde:\nAnd I never turn my back on anything!\nMaya:\nYou're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey?\nByrde:\nMacho Maggey Byrde, they say! I'm a tough old Byrde!\nMaya:\n\"Tough old byrde\", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it?\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, I get it.\nAnything else\nByrde:\nI know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I'm incarcerated, now. So I can't use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Tr\u00e9s Bien, sir...\nMaya:\nAww, don't let it get you down, Maggey!\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping:\nByrde:\nMr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial?\nPhoenix:\nProbably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial.\nByrde:\nUm... Mr. Wright...?\nPhoenix:\n?\nByrde:\nDo you think we'll win next time? ...Sir?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nByrde:\nMy life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck!\nMaya:\nArgh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!)\nMaya:\nWe'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you!\nByrde:\nThank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Tr\u00e9s Bien is then!\nPhoenix:\nTr\u00e9s... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place.\nByrde:\nYes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi!\nMaya:\nSure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food!\nJanuary 6Tr\u00e9s Bien\nMaya:\nWow! Look at this place.\nPhoenix:\n\"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right?\nMaya:\nActually, I'm not all that into it...\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here.\nPhoenix:\nDon't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here!\nMaya:\nPerfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I suppose we can...)\nExamine\nCash register\nMaya:\nLook, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money.\nPhoenix:\nYou know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way!\nTrinkets\nMaya:\nLook at all the little trinkets tucked away in here.\nPhoenix:\nI bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups!\nMaya:\n... I never knew you were so... cultured.\nPhoenix:\nCome on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much!\nFront entrance\nPhoenix:\nIt's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French.\nMagazine rack\nMaya:\nIt's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya?\nMaya:\nYeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? It'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then.\nPhoenix:\nHm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack.\nMaya:\n...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. \"MC Bomber\", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe?\nPhoenix:\nI wonder what \"MC Bomber\" is supposed to be...?\u00a0! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning!\nMaya:\nWHAT!?\nSports Paper added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...)\nMagazine rack (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nIt's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers.\nMaya:\nWell, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it?\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" like in these mags, Maya?\nMaya:\nYeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\nThis table's set nicely. It just needs a customer.\nMaya:\nWhat do you think this flower is, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nLet's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think...\nMaya:\nDuh. Even I could've told you that.\nPhoenix:\nWell, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist!\nWindows\nPhoenix:\nWow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there.\nMaya:\nReally!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing.\nPhoenix:\nGot you! I was only kidding, Maya.\nMaya:\nNick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't.\nPhoenix:\n(...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.)\nPartition\nPhoenix:\nThis restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left.\nCrime scene\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the table where the murder occurred.\nMaya:\nI guess so, with all this police tape all around it.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya?\nMaya:\nWhy would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know!\nPhoenix:\n(Then why can I picture you doing just that?)\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nPresent\nSports Paper\nMaya:\nHmm... \"MC Bomber\"...\nPhoenix:\nAnd don't forget the \"100,000\", too.\nMaya:\nThere's something about that name, \"MC Bomber\".\nPhoenix:\nYeah, It's a pretty unusual name.\nPhoenix:\nAnd don't forget the \"100,000\", too.\nMaya:\nEveryone's worried about bombs these days, I guess.\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...)\nMaya:\nAnyway, we should really look into this some more!\nMaggey Byrde profile\nMaya:\nThis is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then.\nMaya:\nWasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers!\nDetention Center\nPresent\nSports Paper\nByrde:\nOh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title?\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder...\nMaya:\nAnd Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid.\nByrde:\nOh, no...\nPhoenix:\nI found this paper in the magazine rack at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nByrde:\nReally? That's strange... Tr\u00e9s Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them.\nMaya:\nThen maybe one of the customers left it behind?\nPhoenix:\nAnyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here.\nByrde:\nAh-ha! That's it, sir! \"MC Bomber\"! That was the name that was written on the CD!\nPhoenix:\n(Just as I thought...)\nMaya:\nI guess it wasn't \"MC Screwdriver\" after all, huh...\nByrde:\nSo, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right?\nMaya:\nIf someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! \"The Master of Kurain\" or \"The Spirit Song\" or even \"Maya's Theme\"!\nPhoenix:\nUm, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim!\nMaya:\nYou're right!\nPhoenix:\n(So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...)\nMaya:\nI think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick?\nAfter presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nJanuary 6Tr\u00e9s Bien\n???:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Tr\u00e9s Bien!\nMaya:\nOh! Hel... lo... ...\nPhoenix:\n(What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...)\n???:\nBienvenue! Welcome to my petite restaurant\u00e9!\nMaya:\nHuh? \"Bee Avenue\"?\n???:\nOh, non, my petite chulip!\nMaya:\nHuh? Me?\n???:\nLook at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil m\u00e9lange of la n\u00e9roli and la rose. My personal recommendation!\nMaya:\nYou think I need what...?\n???:\nOui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voil\u00e1! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique!\nMaya:\nReally?\n???:\nAnd for la monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nWho? Me?\n???:\nLook at z'at face! Like la puppy rejected by life itself! You are fatigued, non? For you, monsieur, I recommend z'is! Oil of bergamot. And maybe a 'int of... Oui, oui! I will add la peppermint and la clary sage for a fragrance exceptionnel! Such an invigorating recipe will bring out your delicious beauty, monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nM-My beauty!?\n???:\nAlors. If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day!\nPhoenix:\nActually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers.\n???:\nMais bien s\u00fbr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non?\nPhoenix:\nUm, yes... You know me?\n???:\nMais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court!\nMaya:\nI guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already.\nMaya:\nI wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you?\nArmstrong:\nAllow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchant\u00e9!\nTalk\nTr\u00e9s Bien\nMaya:\nSo what does \"Tr\u00e9s Bien\" mean? I know \"tr\u00e9s\". That means \"three\", right?\nArmstrong:\nNon, non, non! \"Tr\u00e9s Bien\" is Fran\u00e7ais! In English, you would say, \"Very Good\".\nMaya:\nOh. Very good...\nArmstrong:\nOui, exactement! La atmosphere is tr\u00e9s bien, and la cuisine is tr\u00e9s bien!\nPhoenix:\n(If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?)\nArmstrong:\nMy cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine.\nPhoenix:\n(I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...)\nArmstrong:\nSince I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands.\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're running this place on your own now?\nArmstrong:\nOui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi!\nPhoenix:\n(... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.)\nArmstrong:\nI am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist.\nMaya:\nA roaming what?\nArmstrong:\nA practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas.\nPhoenix:\n(Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo, could you tell me what you know about the incident?\nArmstrong:\nBien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...)\nArmstrong:\nSo. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill.\nPhoenix:\nBecause of the poison in his coffee?\nArmstrong:\nZ'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair.\nMaya:\nHe was dead?\nArmstrong:\nMon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also.\nPhoenix:\nAnd this man who died... Was he alone?\nArmstrong:\nOui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but...\nMaya:\nI see...\nArmstrong:\nLa police, z'ey asked me many times. \"Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?\" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing.\nPhoenix:\nOld man? What old man?\nOld man (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nUm... So who is the old man that you mentioned?\nArmstrong:\nAt z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere.\nMaya:\nWhat!? Someone else saw it?\nArmstrong:\nMais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table.\nMaya:\nBut Maggey swears there were two people!\nArmstrong:\nMais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the lawyer. That was me, I suppose?\nArmstrong:\nMais bien s\u00fbr!\nPhoenix:\n... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me.\nMaya:\nDon't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!?\nMaggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile)\nPhoenix:\nWhen Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen?\nArmstrong:\nOu... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so.\nPhoenix:\nSo what happened?\nArmstrong:\nNon. It was, er... It was nothing.\nMaya:\nLook, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive!\nArmstrong:\nOui. It is true.\nPhoenix:\nIf there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant.\nMaya:\nSo please! Tell us anything you know.\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock!?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nNo way! What are we going to do, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWe'll just have to remov... WHAT THE!?\nMaya:\nWh-What's wrong?\nPhoenix:\nThe Magatama... It's gone!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nI had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air!\nMaya:\nWHAT!?\nPhoenix:\n(But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?)\nMaggey's motive (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nMaggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim.\n3 PSYCHE LOCKS\nArmstrong:\nN-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qu\u00e9 ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason.\nPhoenix:\n(What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it's nearby.)\nMaya:\nI only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK?\nPhoenix:\n(...And here I thought it was mine to keep!)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nArmstrong:\nPlease, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town.\nPhoenix:\n(I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge?\nArmstrong:\nOui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant!\nMaya:\nLooks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick!\nMagazine Clipping\nArmstrong:\nI am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, \"lacking\", per'aps?\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*\nArmstrong:\nEven a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could 'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So 'andsome.\nMaya:\nWow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been...\nArmstrong:\nEvery time you opened your mouth, z'e 'ole courthouse stirred.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, man. That is something I don't want to imagine...)\nSports Paper\nPhoenix:\nWe found this sports paper in the magazine rack here.\nArmstrong:\nOne of my customers must 'ave left it behind.\nMaya:\nDo you have any idea which customer it was?\nArmstrong:\nZ'e only ideas I 'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen!\nMaya Fey profile\nArmstrong:\nOh l\u00e0, l\u00e0! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip!\nMaya:\nWho, me?\nArmstrong:\nOui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas?\nMaya:\nUm... Sure!\nArmstrong:\nIf you want a job 'ere, it is yours, precious!\nMia Fey profile\nArmstrong:\nMon dieu! What beauty!\nMaya:\nThat's my sister!\nArmstrong:\nAh, oui? Another delight! But you 'ave a certain je ne sais quois z'at I do not sense from your sister.\nMaya:\nI do?\nArmstrong:\nSo throw your head 'ead 'igh! Thrust out your feminine features! Do not lose 'eart, ma fille! You are a woman! A woman extraordinaire!\nMaya:\nDo I look like I need cheering up or something?\nMaggey Byrde profile\nArmstrong:\nMaggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas?\nPhoenix:\nYes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control.\nArmstrong:\nOui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non?\nMaya:\nOh... You know about that?\nArmstrong:\nZ'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness.\nPhoenix:\nHappiness perfume?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before.\nPhoenix:\nBut she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time.\nArmstrong:\nZ'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong.\nPhoenix:\n(Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!)\nArmstrong:\nI am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes.\nMaya:\nSomething like what?\nPhoenix:\n(What's this guy talking about!?)\nMaya:\nDoes this mean... Maggey did have a motive?\nPhoenix:\nWe've got to ask this guy for more info, stat!\nJean Armstrong profile\nArmstrong:\nIt is 'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris.\nMaya:\nWow! In Paris!?\nArmstrong:\nIt was something la chef z'ere said to me z'at made me decide to open my own restaurant.\nPhoenix:\nWhat was it?\nArmstrong:\nZ'at awful man said to me, \"You must train for another ten years!\" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would 'ave to be a fool to do z'is, non?\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, about this...\nArmstrong:\nF\u00e9licitations! Mais... qu'est-ce que c'est?\nPhoenix:\nAck! Um... Je... Je no comprehend...\nMaya:\nNick! Don't just make something up!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nUm, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there?\nArmstrong:\n... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves.\nMaya:\nHuh? \"'Im\"?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc.\nPhoenix:\nLa p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that?\nArmstrong:\nBehind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\".\nMaya:\nThank you!\nArmstrong:\nJe vous en prie, my dear!\nMaya:\nLet's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick!\nJanuary 6Vitamin Square\nMaya:\nSo this is Vitamin Square.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about?\nPhoenix:\nThat grouchy-looking grandpa?\nMaya:\nHe's throwing seeds out for the pigeons.\nPhoenix:\nMaya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them!\nOld Man:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...)\nExamine\nSandbox\nMaya:\nI used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe!\nPhoenix:\nReally? You?\nMaya:\nSure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do.\nPhoenix:\nIron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words.\nMaya:\nIt was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then!\nPhoenix:\nSo, did you manage to get all the iron?\nMaya:\nNo, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them?\nPhoenix:\nNo.\nFruit attractions\nMaya:\nThis place is so fruity!\nPhoenix:\nThat's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites.\nMaya:\nThen that apple slide is perfect for you!\nPhoenix:\n... And what is so \"perfect\" about it?\nMaya:\nOh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo!\nPhoenix:\nNo way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that.\nMaya:\nYeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too.\nPigeons\nMaya:\nHey, look. Pigeons!\nPhoenix:\nYeah. And heaps of them, too.\nMaya:\nDid you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace?\nPhoenix:\nThat's a dove, not a pigeon.\nMaya:\n... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony?\nPhoenix:\nYou're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya.\nMagazine on orange-themed seat\nMaya:\nOoh, there's a magazine here.\nPhoenix:\nIt's a magazine full of job listings.\nOld Man:\nYou disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away!\nPhoenix:\n\"Threw away\"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job?\nOld Man:\nKah! That's none of your business!\nPhoenix:\nSorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then.\nOld Man:\nI don't want anyone else having it! Give it back!\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad. Now that you want it so bad, I don't want to give it up!)\nJob Listings added to the Court Record.\nOld Man:\nHey! That's mine!\nCloser orange-themed seat (after examining magazine on orange-themed seat)\nMaya:\nLooking at this orange reminds me...\nPhoenix:\nOf what?\nMaya:\nThat you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know.\nPhoenix:\nYou don't have to tell me twice.\nTalk\nWhat you saw\nPhoenix:\nUm... Excuse me.\nOld Man:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWould you mind if I had a word with you?\nOld Man:\nYes!\nPhoenix:\nI just want to ask you a couple of questions...\nOld Man:\nWhat's the matter with you!? Can't you see I'm busy? So you don't like my seeds, eh, pigeons!?\nPhoenix:\n(He's really chucking those seeds at them! That's got to hurt!)\nOld Man:\nGo on! Eat this!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh*)\nMaggey Byrde\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde?\nOld Man:\nI don't know any Maggey Byrde!\nMaya:\nYes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nOld Man:\nKah! It's a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace!\nMaya:\nA disgrace?\nOld Man:\nAn innocent young girl revealing herself like that!\nPhoenix:\nRevealing!? You mean her uniform?\nOld Man:\nThe youth of today! They don't have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty?\nMaya:\nWhat about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing.\nOld Man:\nYou!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace!\nMaya:\nTalk about hitting a girl where it hurts...\nTr\u00e9s Bien\nPhoenix:\nDo you go to Tr\u00e9s Bien a lot?\nOld Man:\nHmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there's not food. Where's the sushi? The tempura? The rice!?\nPhoenix:\nTr\u00e9s Bien is a French restaurant, sir...\nOld Man:\nWhere do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the waitresses?\nOld Man:\nYou can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They're practically naked! It's a disgrace, isn't it? Well, isn't it!?\nPhoenix:\nListen, it's not my restaurant.\nOld Man:\nKah! It's a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable!\nPhoenix:\n(He certainly knows the place. He must be a regular! But if he hates it so much, why does he keep going?)\nTr\u00e9s Bien regular (appears after \"Tr\u00e9s Bien\")\nMaya:\nAre you a regular at that restaurant, sir?\nOld Man:\n...\nMaya:\nIt's just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there?\nOld Man:\n...\nPhoenix:\nSir?\nOld Man:\nThere you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that!\nMaya:\nHe must be hiding something, right?\nPhoenix:\nIf he is, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock... Oh, wait... I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh...\nMaya:\nRemember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else!\nPhoenix:\n(If Pearls ever gets wind of this, I'm going to be in a world of pain...)\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUm, excuse me, sir. Could I just ask you about this...\nOld Man:\n... Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm...\nPhoenix:\nSir?\nOld Man:\nHere you go, boy! How does some pigeon feed sound to you!?\nPhoenix:\n(This wasn't exactly what I was hoping to get out of this guy...)\nDetention Center\nPresent\nJob Listings\nMaya:\nUm, Maggey...\nByrde:\nOh, are you looking for some part-time work, Maya? Why don't you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you.\nMaya:\nReally? Me?\nByrde:\nIt's pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!\nMaya:\nWhat secrets...?\nByrde:\nYou can't make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You'll see. It's interesting.\nMaya:\nWow! I can't wait to get my apron on now!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too.\nMaya:\nSo did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...?\nByrde:\nApparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't.\nJean Armstrong profile\nByrde:\nOh, so you met the owner, Mr. Armstrong!\nPhoenix:\nHe's, um... Oh, how can I put this... pretty unique, huh?\nByrde:\nHe has a really intense aura. As a chef and as a person.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too.\nMaya:\nSo did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...?\nByrde:\nApparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't.\nTr\u00e9s Bien\nExamine\nCash register (after presenting Job Listings)\nPhoenix:\nIt's really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again?\nTrinkets (after presenting Job Listings)\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally.\nMagazine rack (after presenting Job Listings)\nPhoenix:\nIt's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those.\nTable (after presenting Job Listings)\nPhoenix:\nMr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible...\nWindows (after presenting Job Listings)\nPhoenix:\nIt looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It's nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush.\nCrime scene (after presenting Job Listings)\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the table where the poisoning occurred. The stain tells the story well. The whole area is still cordoned off with police tape. I guess it must still be under investigation.\nPresent\nJob Listings\nArmstrong:\nMademoiselle!\nMaya:\nY-Yes?\nArmstrong:\nAre you looking for la job?\nMaya:\nWhat!? N-No, no. I was just...\nArmstrong:\nLet me see. Your style is un peu diff\u00e9rent, but you 'ave a good face.\nMaya:\n...Different?\nArmstrong:\nF\u00e9licitations! You 'ave passed! I will 'ire you! Bien! Come wiz me. I will teach you everyz'ing I know!\nMaya:\nN-Nick! HEEEEEELP!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for Maya... Maybe I should do both...?)\nVitamin Square\nExamine\nSandbox\nPhoenix:\nWhen I think back to when I was young... ...I wonder what I found so great about playing in a sandbox. Maybe I'll come back here in the middle of the night one of these days to relive it. ... On second thought, being arrested by Gumshoe would be too embarrassing to bear.\nFruit attractions\nPhoenix:\nYou don't see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man's the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons.\nPigeons\nPhoenix:\nThe pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don't notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she's scarfing down a burger.\nCloser orange-themed seat\nPhoenix:\nThis is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression. I guess I better give it back to that old man once this investigation's over.\nTalk\nMaggey Byrde\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde?\nOld Man:\nI don't know any Maggey Byrde!\nPhoenix:\nYes, you do. You know, the waitress at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nOld Man:\nHmph! If you ask me It's a disgrace! Th-That's what it is! An innocent young girl revealing herself like that!\nPhoenix:\nSo, you didn't like that kind of thing, then?\nOld Man:\n... Wh-What are you trying to say about me, boy!? Explain yourself!\nPhoenix:\nUm, nothing! I'm not saying anything about you...\nOld Man:\nI know your kind! You young ones with your spiky hair and your fancy suits! That heads of yours is over-flowing with filthy ideas!\nPhoenix:\n(...I know someone who needs to learn some stress management.)\nOld Man:\nGet out of here, you young brat!\nTr\u00e9s Bien regular\nPhoenix:\nSo, you are a regular at that restaurant, right, sir?\nOld Man:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYou're always complaining about the place, so why do you go there?\nOld Man:\n...\nPhoenix:\nSir?\nOld Man:\nThere you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that!\nPhoenix:\n(Something's not right about this guy... But If he's hiding something, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock.) Oh, wait... (I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... I need to find it before I can get anywhere with this old man.)\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Tr\u00e9s Bien:\nJanuary 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later.\nExamine\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. There's nothing for him to do right now, so he's catching some vertical z's.\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Tr\u00e9s Bien:\nJanuary 6Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nPoor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Tr\u00e9s Bien once things have cooled off.\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Tr\u00e9s Bien:\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation.\nGumshoe:\nWell, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe's really fired up about this...)\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh. ... Him.)\nGumshoe:\nNow, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes...?\nGumshoe:\nUm... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!?\nExamine\nDetective on left\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nDetective:\n\"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life.\" No. That's too obscure. You don't really get the \"you'll die before your time\" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, \"Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!\"\nPhoenix:\n... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess?\nChief\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.\nChief:\nWHAT!? Poisoned coffee waitress gets a retrial!? I knew it! I knew there was something funny about the taste of this coffee! OK! Who brought me this coffee today? Hands up!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeesh! Have a little faith in your subordinates!)\nDetective:\nQuit surfing the net, Chief!\nChief:\nS-Sorry... I was just, um...\nPhoenix:\n(Things feel pretty tense in here...)\nBadgers\nPhoenix:\nNo matter what, whenever I come here, that mascot's there to greet me.\nChief:\nYou got that right. That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force!\nPhoenix:\nSo what's with the pink one? It's new, right?\nChief:\nYup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\".\nPhoenix:\nSo one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"?\nChief:\nYou got it! They're married.\nPhoenix:\n(So should I expect to see Baby Badger next time I'm here...?)\nTalk\nMaggey Byrde\nPhoenix:\nSo the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\nBack when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know.\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\n...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened.\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe sure is sweating up a storm over nothing... ...Ah, so that's it! Our big ol' Gumshoe has a little ol' crush on Maggey!)\nGumshoe:\nI... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh!\nPhoenix:\n(Note to self: Gossip with Maya about this later!)\nGumshoe:\nLook, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!?\nPhoenix:\nS-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time?\nGumshoe:\nHey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind.\nThe victim\nPhoenix:\nSo I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim?\nGumshoe:\nGlen Elg, he was a computer programmer.\nPhoenix:\nI see. A programmer...\nGumshoe:\nHe was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often?\nGumshoe:\nNot according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy.\nPhoenix:\n(A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that?\nGumshoe:\nThat's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial.\nPhoenix:\nYou're kidding! What was her supposed \"motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(What could this motive have been...?)\nThe investigation\nGumshoe:\nThis isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, that's right...\nGumshoe:\nThe judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh?\nGumshoe:\nLook, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop.\nPhoenix:\n(That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony?\nContradictions (appears after \"The investigation\")\nGumshoe:\nThe biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim.\nGumshoe:\nRight. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD...\nPhoenix:\n(CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...)\nByrde:\nAnd there was a sample CD on the table, sir.\nGumshoe:\nBut our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nNot on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal.\nPhoenix:\nBut didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie.\nPhoenix:\nA radio? He didn't have a CD player?\nGumshoe:\nYou got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all.\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it... The owner of Tr\u00e9s Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...)\nThe charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile)\nPhoenix:\nSo what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Tr\u00e9s Bien?\nGumshoe:\nIt's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected with the case anyway...\nPhoenix:\nHey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything?\nGumshoe:\nWell, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Tr\u00e9s Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Tr\u00e9s Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nGumshoe:\nIs that thing real, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhy does everybody keep asking me that?\nGumshoe:\nI wonder what this phony of yours is like...\nPhoenix:\nHe had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!)\nMagazine Clipping\nGumshoe:\nI wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what did he say?\nGumshoe:\nHe started off by saying, \"I'm at a complete loss for words...\" But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour.\nPhoenix:\nBut...\nGumshoe:\nHe said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty!\nPhoenix:\n(It looked like I was \"trying to get Maggey found guilty\"...?)\nSports Paper\nGumshoe:\nWhat's that? A sports paper?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nGumshoe:\nIt's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here.\nPhoenix:\nAnd take a look at this. See this writing here?\nGumshoe:\n\"MC Bomber\"... Hey!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nGumshoe:\nI've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, \"MC Bomber\"...\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!)\nGumshoe:\nAck, it's no good. I can't remember...\nPhoenix:\n(...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.)\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble.\nPhoenix:\n(Handwriting, huh? It'd be good to know more about that, in any case...)\nGumshoe:\nThanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue!\nSports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe.\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nHey! So how come she's not with you today?\nPhoenix:\nShe's working down at the restaurant right now.\nGumshoe:\nWorking, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know.\nPhoenix:\nUm... OK...?\nGumshoe:\nNext time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way!\nPhoenix:\n(Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?)\nMia Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nShe cross-examined me once, you know.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Mia did?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks.\nPhoenix:\n(But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...)\nGumshoe:\nI can't believe she's gone...\nGodot profile\nGumshoe:\nThat's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, really?\nGumshoe:\nHe was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?)\nGumshoe:\nYou sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind.\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything.\nPhoenix:\nIt's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right.\nGumshoe:\n... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal.\nMaggey Byrde profile\nPhoenix:\nHave you gone to see Maggey?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words.\nPhoenix:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to.\nPhoenix:\n(Did he go for her, or for himself...?)\nJean Armstrong profile\nGumshoe:\nThe chef of Tr\u00e9s Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh l\u00e0 l\u00e0! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's in it?\nGumshoe:\nI don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day.\nPhoenix:\nUnder orders?\nOld Man:\nYeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? You can't stop thinking about him!?\nGumshoe:\nNot like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow!\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like he knows a little something more about our charming chef.)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you make of this...?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant...\nPhoenix:\n(You don't have to explain... Really...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.:\nJanuary 6Tr\u00e9s Bien\nPhoenix:\nThe scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...)\n???:\nAh! Welcome! Bee avenue!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. What a cute voice.)\nMaya:\nOh, it's just you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya!\nMaya:\nWell? How do I look?\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium...\nMaya:\nMaybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer.\nPhoenix:\n(Then who was that woman I just saw?)\nMaya:\nOh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat!\nPhoenix:\n... I am kind of hungry, actually.\nTalk\nWaitress\nPhoenix:\nSo, how do you like your new job, Maya?\nMaya:\nI never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it's a nice-looking restaurant. It's a shame more people don't come.\nMaya:\nDon't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my \"gimme a tip\" smile!\nLunch special\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says.\nPhoenix:\nHow much is it?\nMaya:\nIt's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course.\nPhoenix:\nThe Twin-T set? I believe I'll be taking a pass. It's kind of expensive.\nMaya:\nWhat!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register!\nPhoenix:\nHow about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy.\nMaya:\nYeah, right! Maybe later.\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nAbout this...\nMaya:\nSorry, Nick! I'm a waitress now. I've got a pile of work waiting for little ol' me.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nUm... About the lunch...\nMaya:\nOh! A fine choice, sir.\nPhoenix:\nNo. I, um...\nMaya:\nKITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT!\nPhoenix:\nI don't need any of that!\nMaya:\nJust a moment, please, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya!\nMaya:\nSorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa!\nMaya:\nA dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricass\u00e9e with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon app\u00e9tit!\nPhoenix:\nUm, thanks...?\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already!\nPhoenix:\n(Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp!\nMaya:\nWell?\nPhoenix:\nAre you hungry, Maya?\nMaya:\nI'm starving!\nPhoenix:\nHere. It's yours.\nMaya:\nReally!? ... Urp!\nPhoenix:\nRemember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate!\nMaya:\n... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets!\nPhoenix:\nHey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!)\nTr\u00e9s Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nHow does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad?\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen?\nPhoenix:\n(The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.)\nTalk\nKitchen\nPhoenix:\nHmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? \"In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!\"\nMaya:\nIn the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty!\nPhoenix:\nHey, wait up! Maya!\nMaya:\nWhat is it? I'm pretty busy right now.\nPhoenix:\nWeren't you going to show me around?\nMaya:\nTsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face...\nPhoenix:\n(I'd better conduct the search in the kitchen myself!)\nAfter clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Tr\u00e9s Bien:\nJanuary 6Tr\u00e9s BienKitchen\nMaya:\nAnd here it is! The famous Tr\u00e9s Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually.\nPhoenix:\n... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure.\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop!\nExamine\nMirror\nMaya:\nNow THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty.\nPhoenix:\nThere's a book on the dresser. \"Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature\".\nMaya:\nNot exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like a collection of poems he's written.\nMaya:\nPoems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK?\nPhoenix:\nOK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, \"Printemps\". \"Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must.\"\nMaya:\nHuh? That's it!?\nPhoenix:\nYup. That's a poem for you.\nOil bottles\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something.\nMaya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!\nPhoenix:\nOh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...\nMaya:\nLet's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\nThere's one bottle that's different from all the others.\nPhoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.\nMaya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn't smell.\nPhoenix:\n(So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?)\nMaya:\nHey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he?\nSmall Bottle added to the Court Record.\nOil bottles (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this?

They're all the same, too.\nLace curtains\nPhoenix:\nWhat are these lace curtains for?\nMaya:\nI don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those.\nPhoenix:\n(How do you respond to something like that!?)\nTable\nMaya:\nNow I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that?\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter!\nMaya:\nMy Magatama! What's it doing there!?\nPhoenix:\n(What indeed...)\nMagatama put into pocket.\nTable (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nNow I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that?\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't that used in Chinese food...?)\nMaya:\nAnd look at these knives. They look really sharp!\nPhoenix:\nI'd like to see how one of those slices through a cheesecake.\nMaya:\nA cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick.\nStove\nMaya:\nMmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricass\u00e9e with balsamic vinaigrette.\nPhoenix:\nIsn't that what I just ate for lunch?\nMaya:\nMaybe... What you ate is the only French dish I know the name of.\nAfter examining oil bottles in Tr\u00e9s Bien - Kitchen:\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're just in time!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nThe lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me.\nPhoenix:\n(He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything?\nGumshoe:\nThey said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it.\nPhoenix:\n(I expected as much...)\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment.\nSports Paper refiled into the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\n\"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...)\nTalk\nArmstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle)\nPhoenix:\nSo what's Mr. Armstrong's secret?\nGumshoe:\nYou ever had lunch at Tr\u00e9s Bien, pal?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Yes...\nGumshoe:\nSo, how was it?\nPhoenix:\nTo put it nicely... it was inedible.\nGumshoe:\nHey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess it's probably the food.\nGumshoe:\nThe real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt.\nPhoenix:\nReally? How much does he owe?\nGumshoe:\nThis is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red.\nPhoenix:\nH-Half a million? Are we talking dollars?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble!\nPhoenix:\nSorry. That figure just took me by surprise.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them.

I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh? But he was there when I took the coffee over, sir. Scout's honor!\n???:\nMaggey!\nByrde:\nAck! D-Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nA-Are you doing alright!? How're you feeling!?\nByrde:\n...As if you need to ask either question, sir.\nGumshoe:\nDon't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK?\nByrde:\nRoger!\nGumshoe:\nAnd you!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nGumshoe:\nYou'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!\nPhoenix:\n(I-I think he's serious!)\nMaya:\nHey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?\nGumshoe:\nYup.\nMaya:\nSo you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?\nByrde:\nReally? Can you, sir!?\nGumshoe:\nO... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?\nPhoenix:\nS-Sure.\nGumshoe:\nOK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?\nByrde:\nI can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you.\nMaya:\nLooks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(I can only wish...)\nJanuary 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nGodot:\n... Aaah, bitter!\nJudge:\nMr... Um... Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nAaaah!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong!?\nJudge:\nNothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating.\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.\nJudge:\nI see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Our trusty\"...?)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.\nPhoenix:\nBut I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!\nGodot:\nI wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.\nPhoenix:\n(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!)\nJudge:\nAs everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)\nJudge:\nNow then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.\nGodot:\nLet's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?\nGumshoe:\n...\nJudge:\nWitness! State your name for the court!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.\nGodot:\nOther way around, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!\nJudge:\nSince yesterday?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.\nMaya:\nI hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.\nJudge:\nI see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?\nGumshoe:\nY-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.\nJudge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.\nGlen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nUm... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.\nJudge:\nThe waitress being the accused?\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.\nJudge:\nHmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.\nTr\u00e9s Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nCome, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.\nJudge:\nNow then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Yes, sir...\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Incident --\nGumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nGodot:\nUsing the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!\nJudge:\nThe facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nJudge:\nPlease, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?\nPhoenix:\nI already told you! That wasn't me!\nCross Examination\n-- The Incident --\nGumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's what she said. And I--\nGodot:\nGodot:\nWhat killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction?\nPhoenix:\nHey!\nGodot:\nSadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPress harder\nPhoenix:\nWell, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way.\nGodot:\nHa...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Tr\u00e9s Bien, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nI have here in my possession a ticket.\nPhoenix:\nA ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.)\nGodot:\nYes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen.\nJudge:\nThis is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct?\nGodot:\nI think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table?\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nIt certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPress (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's what she said.

They both said there was no other guy at the table.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nGumshoe:\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHe was listening to his radio, you say?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. He had a portable radio in his chest pocket.\nMaya:\nMaggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\".\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPress harder\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was it that the victim was listening to on the radio, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? How should I know?\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.)\nMaya:\nThis isn't going very well, is it...?\nJudge:\nHmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used?\nLeads back to cross-examination\nGumshoe:\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...\nGodot:\nGodot:\nHa...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPress harder\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee?\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!?\nGumshoe:\nOh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think--\nGodot:\nGodot:\nIn case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? For me?\nGodot:\n\"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence.\nGumshoe:\nTh... THAT piece... sir?\nGodot:\nYes. THAT piece.\nGumshoe:\n... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again?\nGodot:\nThis!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup.\nGodot:\nYes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim.\nJudge:\nOh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it.\nGodot:\nConclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this!\nPhoenix:\nUuuurgh!\nGumshoe:\nFor the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's.\nCoffee Cup added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nUpon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance...\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPress (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...\nGodot:\nGodot:\nHa...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.\nGumshoe:\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n(Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nIt's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history.\nMaya:\nHow much is too much?\nGodot:\nA lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off.\nMaya:\n0.2 grams? How much is that?\nGumshoe:\nYou know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much.\nPhoenix:\n(Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere.\nGumshoe:\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I don't get it.\nGodot:\nI'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.\nGumshoe:\n*gulp*\nGodot:\nSo stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive?\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nShe was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.\nPhoenix:\nI knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.)\nGumshoe:\nIt disappeared from the scene of the crime.\nGodot:\nAnd it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million!\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPress harder\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client!\nGodot:\nHa...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question!\nJudge:\nTh-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...?\nGumshoe:\nOne of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant.\nPhoenix:\nWH-WHAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nGodot:\nHa...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress.\nJudge:\nY-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...)\nVictim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nThe ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...?\nGodot:\nIt's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPress (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I don't get it.\nGodot:\nI'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.\nGumshoe:\n*gulp*\nGodot:\nSo stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive?\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nShe was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.\nPhoenix:\nI knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.)\nGumshoe:\nIt disappeared from the scene of the crime.\nGodot:\nAnd it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million!\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?)\nMaya:\nYou really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?\nPhoenix:\nTo be honest, I don't know.\nMaya:\nBut Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.)\nAfter selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements:\nJudge:\nThat's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.\nGodot:\nI like an old man who knows the score.\nJudge:\nThere is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!\nGodot:\nI don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.\nMaya:\nNot good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.\nGodot:\nI'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\n(He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)\nGodot:\nThis is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.\nMaya:\nWow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...\nPhoenix:\nTh-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?)\nGodot:\nHa...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.\nPhoenix:\nThe coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...\nGodot:\nOf course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.\nJudge:\nSomething else? I presume you mean...\nGodot:\nOf course. I'm referring to the pocket.\nPhoenix:\nThe... pocket?\nGodot:\nA search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!\nPhoenix:\nA bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.\nPhoenix:\nWHAAAT!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.\nApron added to the Court Record.\nPotassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nThere's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?\nGodot:\nBloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?\nJudge:\nDon't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!\nGodot:\nThat's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!\nPhoenix:\n(You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)\nGodot:\nWell, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?\nGumshoe:\nN-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.\nPhoenix:\nKetchup!?\nGumshoe:\nShe must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.\nJudge:\n... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!\nGodot:\nPull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!\nGumshoe:\nUnnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.\nJudge:\nHmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nThe motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.\nGodot:\nWell, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)\nJudge:\nWitness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Investigation --\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.\nJudge:\nHmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.\nGodot:\nLast chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nDon't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!\nCross Examination\n-- The Investigation --\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n\"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nThere's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...)\nGumshoe:\nOfficers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds...\nJudge:\nHmm... Seeds...\nGodot:\nHa...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...)\nGodot:\nThe old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime.\nGumshoe:\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHow long was the defendant unconscious for?\nGumshoe:\nThe officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself.\nPhoenix:\n(I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...)\nGumshoe:\nI woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful.\nPhoenix:\n(You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!)\nGodot:\nSave the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation.\nGumshoe:\nOops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then?\nGumshoe:\nNo, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet.\nPhoenix:\nFifty-eight cents...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal!\nJudge:\nThe victim sounds like he was a thoroughly miserable young man.\nGodot:\nOr some kind of outlaw... Why not give him a bit of an edge?\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'm on to something here...)\nGumshoe:\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWait a sec!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? D-Did I say something dumb again!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, basically.\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly?\nGumshoe:\n... Oh... That.\nPhoenix:\n(He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...)\nGumshoe:\nThere was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket.\nGodot:\nIt seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nGumshoe:\nWe got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?)\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAsk about the prescription bag\nPhoenix:\nSo what sort of medicine was in the bag?\nGumshoe:\nWell... Actually, the bag we found was empty.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Completely empty.\nPhoenix:\n(It was completely empty...?)\nVictim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nHa...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nNow, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective?\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAsk about his health insurance\nPhoenix:\nSo, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct?\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nAnd yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him!\nJudge:\nOh! That is very true!\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen!\nGodot:\nHa...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nJudge:\nHmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man.\nGodot:\nOr some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone.\nMaya:\nLooks like we're off course again, Nick.\nJudge:\nWitness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPress (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWait a sec!\nGumshoe:\nHuh?

That's a reliable enough source for the court.\nGumshoe:\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!?\nGumshoe:\nHey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nGumshoe:\nIt happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nKeep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat!\nGumshoe:\nSorry...\nGodot:\nSo, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...)\nJudge:\nIt appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness.\nGumshoe:\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for.\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nInteresting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day?\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(And they're just going to let him get away with it...?)\nJudge:\nIt was just one dollar, Detective.\nMaya:\nI guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe.\nPresent Victim's Prescription Bag\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\"\nPhoenix:\nIf I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!\nMaya:\nGumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious.\nMaya:\nCome on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nOho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you?\nPhoenix:\nYou testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later?\nGumshoe:\nUm, no. They didn't.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim was given a prescription right before going to Tr\u00e9s Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!?\nGumshoe:\nY-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!\nJudge:\nI-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!?\nGumshoe:\nI, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that?\nGodot:\nHa...! That's all.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nRead for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological?\nJudge:\nJust what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nHardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say.\nJudge:\nA war wound?\nGodot:\nThe day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum.\nPhoenix:\nHe ruptured his eardrum!?\nJudge:\nThen what on earth was the prescription he was given?\nGodot:\nIt was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nIt's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear.\nJudge:\nYes. Here it is. In very, very fine print.\nGodot:\nIt seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr\u00e9s Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication.\nPhoenix:\nUuurgh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all.\nPhoenix:\nN-No...\nMaya:\nNick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!\nPhoenix:\n(She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?)\nPush the medication issue\nLeads to:\n\"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\nIt does seem as it the medication isn't connected to the case.\nGodot:\nHa...! Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time.\nJudge:\nIndeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Umm...!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground!\nJudge:\nNow then...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!?\nPhoenix:\n(Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.)\nLeads to:\n\"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"\nPhoenix:\nOnly moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!?\nGodot:\n...!\nJudge:\nBut the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThat doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nYou know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable!\nGodot:\nAaargh!\nJudge:\nThat's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call?\nGodot:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Godot...?\nGodot:\n...\nGumshoe:\nUm... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?)\nJudge:\nVery well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me.\nMaya:\nYay! Good job, Nick!\nJudge:\nThe court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness.\nGodot:\nHa...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups.\nJudge:\nCourt is adjourned for recess!\nJanuary 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nMaya:\nPhew! That was close!\nPhoenix:\nTell me about it... I nearly died in there!\nByrde:\nThat's my line, sir!\nMaya:\nNo! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit.\nByrde:\nLooks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!?\nMaya:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nHe said he'd help me. But he totally set me up!\nPhoenix:\nI don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right?\nByrde:\nIt's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)\nMaya:\nSo the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds!\nByrde:\nI bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know?\nMaya:\nYeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds!\nJanuary 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please.\nGodot:\nThe prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand.\nGodot:\nName and occupation, if you don't mind.\nKudo:\nThe name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too.\nPhoenix:\nWe don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation.\nKudo:\nMy occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!?\nPhoenix:\nKimono embroidery?\nKudo:\nThat's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed!\nMaya:\nWow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.\nKudo:\nAnyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile!\nPhoenix:\n(That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...)\nJudge:\nNow then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident?\nKudo:\nOh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino.\nJudge:\nSeeds?\nKudo:\nWhat do you think these are, hmm!?\nJudge:\nI-I see...\nGodot:\nSo you saw everything that happened, gramps?\nKudo:\nDid I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all!\nGodot:\nThen please, tell the court. We're all ears.\nKudo:\nSure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail!\nPhoenix:\n(He's really getting into this...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Witnessed --\nKudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress.\nKudo:\nKah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!?\nJudge:\nN-Newfangled?\nKudo:\nAll this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you!\nJudge:\nE-Excuse me...\nKudo:\nListen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away!\nJudge:\nWell, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Witnessed --\nKudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw the victim, then? You saw Mr. Glen Elg?\nKudo:\nI wanted to know if Gusten Brawn retained his championship or not.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was looking at the sports paper the victim was reading, huh...) And at the location in question... ...there are partitions between tables on the same side of the restaurant, right?\nKudo:\nSo what if there are?\nPhoenix:\nIf you say that you could see the victim... ...that means you were sitting at a table on the other side of the restaurant, correct?\nKudo:\nKah! I go to that place to drink javaccino! I don't go to sit! I don't remember what table I was sitting at!\nPhoenix:\n(You mean you go there to eye the waitress!)\nKudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw?\nKudo:\nVictor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i!\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nKudo:\nMy eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.)\nKudo:\nAnd I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well!\nPhoenix:\n(I bet I know what's coming up and something tells me I'm not going to like it...)\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(It'd be dangerous to press this too much. I'd better ignore it for now.) So, what happened next?\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPress harder\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. We need more clarification on what was put into the victim's coffee. I'd like to ask that the witness add what he knows about this to his testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I agree. Witness, will you enlighten us, please?\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nAdds statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\"\nPress (after adding statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\")\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw?\nKudo:\nVictor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i!\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nKudo:\nMy eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.)\nKudo:\nAnd I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well!\nKudo:\nThere's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nD-Did she really put that into the coffee?\nKudo:\nYou doubt me, boy!? She too some out of a small, brown bottle and sprinkled it in.\nPhoenix:\nCouldn't she have been adding sugar?\nKudo:\nSugar!? In a small, brown bottle like that!?\nJudge:\n\"Like that\"? Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms?\nGodot:\nHa...! A bottle like this, perhaps?\nKudo:\nOh, there it is! That's the one!\nJudge:\nThat's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume?\nGodot:\nSo what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nArgh...\nKudo:\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHe took just one sip?\nKudo:\nYou young'uns! You waste everything! Those javaccinos cost 8 dollars! In the good old days, we would have drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died!\nPhoenix:\n(Congratulations. You have earned the title of Battiest Man To Grace A Courtroom.)\nGodot:\nSo it was an immediate death? Well, with potassium cyanide, I suppose that is possible.\nKudo:\nOh, yes. He slumped over without so much as a twitch! I felt the javaccino I'd just drank turn sour in my stomach.\nGodot:\nOh, yes. I know that feeling.\nJudge:\nAnd the waitress? I presume she is...?\nKudo:\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by?\nKudo:\nParticular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is!\nPhoenix:\nSorry?\nKudo:\nYou can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image.\nMaya:\nDon't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together!\nPhoenix:\n(I-I guess I got a bit carried away...)\nKudo:\nKah! There are other things I recognize about her, too.\nPhoenix:\n(He seems pretty sure of himself. What should I do?)\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be a better line of attack than this. That's what I should be looking for now...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPress harder\nPhoenix:\nSure, you saw a waitress take the coffee over to the victim. But what matters is whether that waitress was Maggey Byrde or not.\nJudge:\nQuite right. Mr. Kudo. These other \"features\" that you recognize about the defendant... I would ask you to add them to your testimony.\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nAdds statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\"\nPress (after adding statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\")\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by?\nKudo:\nParticular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is!\nPhoenix:\nSorry?\nKudo:\nYou can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image.\nMaya:\nDon't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together!\nPhoenix:\n(I-I guess I got a bit carried away...)\nKudo:\nKah! There are other things I recognize about her, too.\nKudo:\nThere was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face?\nKudo:\nKah! As if I wouldn't remember that!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nThe witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face.\nKudo:\nThat's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red!\nGodot:\nSo you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do? I get the feeling there's something more to this somehow...)\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(No, I must be imagining it. I need to find another angle with this guy.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAsk about the straps\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. You seem especially interested in straps. Why is that?\nKudo:\nWh-What?\nPhoenix:\nThe ribbon in her hair, the straps on her apron. What's the fascination?\nKudo:\nF-Fascination?\nGodot:\nGodot:\nPeople have all kinds of fetishes, Trite. We don't need to embarrass the witness.\nKudo:\nListen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish!\nJudge:\nHmm... Is there any relevance to the witness's unusual love of straps, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI was just curious as to why he was so fixated on the waitress's straps...\nKudo:\nI said I haven't got a strap fetish! How many times do I have to repeat myself!?\nJudge:\nVery well. Continue with your testimony, Mr. Kudo. And make it strapless.\nKudo:\n*grumble grumble*\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAsk about the waitress's back\nPhoenix:\nThe identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back.\nKudo:\nSo what?\nPhoenix:\nIs it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!?\nGodot:\nGodot:\nHa...! He's got you there, gramps!\nPhoenix:\nPeople normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons!\nKudo:\nTh-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony.\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nMaya:\nThe old man's testimony is getting longer and longer!\nPhoenix:\nAnd if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet.\nAdds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\"\nPress (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\")\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face?\nKudo:\nKah! As if I wouldn't remember that!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nThe witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face.\nKudo:\nThat's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red!\nGodot:\nSo you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nKudo:\nThere wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't find anything to be distinct, but you did clearly see the witness's face, yes?\nKudo:\nNo question about it! I didn't come this far to back down now! Victor Kudo never backs down!\nPhoenix:\n(That's not the answer I was looking for, but OK...)\nMaya:\nThis has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess... I wonder if he really did see Maggey's face or not...\nPhoenix:\n(Like I thought, we need some concrete proof of this. Proof that the old guy didn't see the waitress clearly from the front.)\nPresent Apron\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\"\nMaya:\nDo you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it?\nPhoenix:\nWell, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there.\nMaya:\nBut he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress...\nPhoenix:\nI-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...)\nMaya:\nHey! Did I just say something clever?\nPhoenix:\nI wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey...\nMaya:\nThat's what we have to figure out, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\nKudo:\nKah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating.\nPhoenix:\nHave you ever seen this before?\nKudo:\nOf course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\n...\n.........\nKudo:\nWh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, \"you half-witted clot\", there's been an eerie silence in here.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the defendant on the day of the poisoning!\nKudo:\nUh?\nPhoenix:\nAnd as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before...\nKudo:\nEr...\nPhoenix:\nYes, you know what I'm getting at! You couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front!\nKudo:\n... Oops!\nJudge:\nWitness! You can't just \"oops\" your way out of this!\nGodot:\nHa...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands.\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nListen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was only one waitress in the restaurant.\nJudge:\nThat being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde?\nGodot:\nExactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching!\nJudge:\nHmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing.\nGodot:\nJust tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps.\nKudo:\nYou can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted!\nMaya:\nHe can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out...\nJudge:\nVery well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim.\nWitness Testimony\n-- About the Victim --\nKudo:\nHe was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.\nHe had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!\nThe young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.\nThen the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.\nThe little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.\nJudge:\nThe testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail.\nKudo:\nOh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything!\nMaya:\nHow are we going to handle this, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWe only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot.\nMaya:\nJust trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel?\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose... But it's what I do best.)\nCross Examination\n-- About the Victim --\nKudo:\nHe was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSpectacles?\nKudo:\nDark glasses to you! One of the lenses was green, but the other was broken. Newfangled rubbish! That's why I remember him so well.\nPhoenix:\n(He did have some kind of lens over his left eye... But I wouldn't have called it a pair of glasses.)\nJudge:\nHmm... He seems to have been wearing some rather modern-looking shades. Perhaps I should take to wearing some, and rival Mr. Godot's sharp appearance.\nMaya:\nAh! We better come up with something sharp, and quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'll wait and see if I should challenge him about the \"spectacles\"...)\nKudo:\nHe had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe newspaper was a sports paper, was it?\nKudo:\nThat young hooligan! I nearly asked him, \"Can't you even read without fidgeting, hmm!?\" How was I supposed to be able to read the back page with all that rustling going on!? I needed to find out if Gusten Brawn retained his championship title!\nPhoenix:\n(It was his paper, not yours! If you wanted to know so bad, why didn't you buy your own!?)\nKudo:\nWhat are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? How dare you judge me!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Ooow!\nMaya:\nGusten Brawn got beaten yesterday, by the way. Anyway...\nKudo:\nThe young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe wireless?\nKudo:\nThe decadent young rascal! In my day, it was one or the other! Read the paper, or listen to the wireless!\nPhoenix:\n(...Oh boy.)\nKudo:\nAnd using an earpiece! It's selfish, that's what it is! I was straining my ears, but I couldn't catch any of it.\nPhoenix:\n(Was he that desperate to listen to the radio...?)\nKudo:\nWhat are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? 2 you feel sorry for me!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow!\nKudo:\nThen the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the waitress, who you only saw from behind, right?\nKudo:\nYou're one of those, are you? You never let anything go, isn't that right?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe.\nKudo:\nWhat does it matter if I saw her from the front or from behind!? My eyes don't lie!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow! (I better not push it until I've got some hard evidence.)\nKudo:\nThe little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n\"His free hand\"?\nKudo:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nWhich hand was that?\nKudo:\nWeren't you listening before, cloth-ears!? I said he was rustling the newspaper with his right hand, didn't I? If his free hand wasn't his right hand, then which hand was it, you moron!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow!\nGodot:\nHa...! Perhaps the great Mr. Trite has three hands!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeesh! I was only asking! No need to gang up on me and treat me like a freak!)\nPresent Coffee Cup\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony?\"\nPhoenix:\n(The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.)\nMaya:\nI guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!)\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory?\nKudo:\nI know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song!\nGodot:\nCare to tell us where this is going, Trite?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his left.\nKudo:\nKah! What is this? Kindergarten?\nPhoenix:\nBut I would like the court to please take a look at this.\nJudge:\nThat's the cup victim used, correct?\nPhoenix:\nYes, and on the rim, you'll notice the mark left by the victim's lips.\nJudge:\nYes. There is a stain left by the coffee.\nPhoenix:\nIf you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his right hand!\nKudo:\nBut how...?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song!\nKudo:\nAaaargh!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from.\nKudo:\nWAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw!\nJudge:\nY-You still insist on your testimony?\nKudo:\nThat young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault!\nPhoenix:\n(Who, me!?)\nJudge:\nTh-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already.\nKudo:\nDon't call me \"old man\", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but...\nGodot:\nSure, why not hear a little more?\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\nBut this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand.\nKudo:\nThank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Left Hand or Right Hand --\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\nHe kept fiddling with it all the time.\nHe was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\nJudge:\nWe know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye.\nGodot:\nIt wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers.\nJudge:\nA monitor? You mean, like a television screen!?\nGodot:\nThe inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work.\nKudo:\nHDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth!\nPhoenix:\n(It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.)\nKudo:\nAnd those are the facts, in good old black and white!\nCross Examination\n-- Left Hand or Right Hand --\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo the victim was wearing an HMD.\nKudo:\nHDTV, CD, DVD... What does it matter!?\nPhoenix:\n(It was none of them actually, but anyway...) And you're sure that he was wearing the earpiece on the same side?\nKudo:\nNo question! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah. That's pretty obvious if you look at the floor plans. From the opposite table, he'd only have a view of the side of the victim's head.)\nPresent Victim's Prescription Bag or Glen Elg profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but...\"\nKudo:\nHe kept fiddling with it all the time.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt seems you kept an eye on Mr. Glen Elg.\nKudo:\nHe was getting on my nerves! Rustling that newspaper and fiddling with his earpiece all the time! And then he went and made all that fuss dying from one sip of javaccino! I wanted to say to him, \"Calm down, you young brat!\" Just looking at him made me suddenly speed up my seed eating! I could've chocked!\nPhoenix:\n(So I take it the victim was a walking ball of nervous energy...)\nKudo:\nHe was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe earpiece you mentioned... Which hand did the victim touch it with?\nKudo:\n... You're one of those people! One of those people who uses his left hand to get things out of his right pocket. Or fastens his left cuff with his right hand? And when the tour guide says, \"On your right side, you'll see the famous blah-blah\"... ...you're the only one who deliberately looks left! Well? Aren't you?\nPhoenix:\nN-No! I didn't mean...\nKudo:\nObviously he used the hand on the same side of his body that the earpiece was in!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow! Ow! (So, if he had the HMD on his left side, then it was his left hand, I guess...)\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou seem very sure of yourself, Mr. Kudo.\nKudo:\nThat's because I know what I saw, no matter what tricks you try to play on me!\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like he really did see the guy picking the cup up with his left hand. This is a dead end!)\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? What do you think?\nPhoenix:\nI think the guy's telling the truth. But even so... Something's not quite right.\nMaya:\nThen chuck evidence at him until he breaks!\nPhoenix:\n(But if he's not lying, there wouldn't be any contradictions in his testimony, right?)\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but... Mr. Kudo! There is something very strange about your observations of the victim.\nKudo:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nYou say he was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the HMD.\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting.\nPhoenix:\nI don't think so.\nKudo:\nWh-What did you say!?\nPhoenix:\nYou're no doubt unaware of this fact, Mr. Kudo. But the victim couldn't hear with his left ear! His eardrum was ruptured!\nKudo:\nEh?\nPhoenix:\nTraces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear!\nKudo:\n... Is that true, Captain?\nGodot:\n...It is.\nKudo:\n...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm...\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!\nPhoenix:\nThis witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!?\nGodot:\nAaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk!\nKudo:\nCaptain! Are you calling me a drip!?\nJudge:\nThis is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his right hand!\nKudo:\nI'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his left hand!\nGodot:\nLet me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nImpossible! The witness has already testified on numerous occasions... ...that the victim died immediately after taking just one sip of the coffee.\nGodot:\nGodot:\nWhich hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless!\nGodot:\nPuuuurgh!\nJudge:\nI believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce!\nKudo:\nD-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned!\n???:\nKudo:\nWAAAAIT! If we stop now, where does that leave me?\nJudge:\nLeave you, Mr. Kudo?\nKudo:\nThanks to that blue-suited young upstart over there... ...I'm just a bumbling old man who can't even dot his t's or cross his i's now!\nPhoenix:\n(How is your bad memory my fault!?)\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do.\nKudo:\nI've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know!\nGodot:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nThere's more?\nKudo:\nTo be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me? (He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...)\nKudo:\nWell, everyone? What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook!\nGodot:\nSorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee.\nKudo:\nWhat have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the javaccino you want if you come to my house after the trial. (Changed from [I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial.] in the original release) I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man!\nJudge:\nThat's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony.\nKudo:\nYou bet! Much, much quicker!\nMaya:\nI can't believe this is happening...\nKudo:\nHa ha ha! You better get ready, youngster!\nPhoenix:\nI get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!? (He's gotta be using some sort of infinite ammo code with that box of seeds...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Final Showdown --\nKudo:\nFirst of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself.\nThe young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino...\nWell, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over.\nIt broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!\nWell!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?\nJudge:\n... Um... Is that all?\nKudo:\nYes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!?\nJudge:\nN-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo.\nMaya:\nDon't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. \"So what?\" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy!\nKudo:\nYou're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of!\nJudge:\nVery well... Mr. Wright. Your final cross-examination, please.\nCross Examination\n-- The Final Showdown --\nKudo:\nFirst of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUm... The court generally prefers if witnesses are sure of themselves, Mr. Kudo.\nKudo:\nNoisy brat! I'm warning you, I'm more savage than a macho man right now! You won't beat me with this testimony! This is the final battle!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow! (He's chucking those seeds harder than ever! I better be careful...)\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Nail him!\nKudo:\nThe young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe court has already heard that testimony, Mr. Kudo...\nKudo:\nI know that! I was just setting the mood. How else am I supposed to build up the suspense, hmm!?\nPhoenix:\nThe suspense?\nKudo:\nIsn't it enough? Should I work the audience a bit more?\nJudge:\nNo, no! Please continue, Mr. Kudo. As quickly as possible!\nKudo:\nAlright. Now where was I...? ...Ah yes. The young boy slumped over the table, and...\nKudo:\nWell, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nA vase, you say?\nKudo:\nYes. There are vases on all the tables in that place. They're accidents waiting to happen! They're practically begging to be knocked over!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, he's right about there being vases. I do remember seeing them, too... There was a vase on the table when I ate munch there.) And you saw the moment when the victim actually knocked over the vase?\nKudo:\nWell... it's hard to say... It's a bit unclear... How do you really define...\nPhoenix:\nOK, I get it.\nKudo:\nI heard it break! And the sight of it is burned into my memory as clear as day!\nPresent Crime Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\"\nKudo:\nIt broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSoaked in water, you mean?\nKudo:\nYes. It splashed me on the knee as well.\nPhoenix:\nYou said you were sitting at a table across the room from the victim, correct? And yet, the water still managed to splash onto you?\nKudo:\n... It was cold! I clearly remember it splashing me!\nPhoenix:\n(Could the water really make it all the way across to the other side of the room...?)\nPresent Crime Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\"\nKudo:\nWell!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou mean, the vase on the victim's table falling upside-down and breaking?\nKudo:\nThe vase turned upside-down, and my testimony's turning this case upside-down... It's a joke! I just wanted everyone to hear it! What do you think, Captain!?\nGodot:\n...I'm impressed. By your ability to waste time.\nPhoenix:\n(Godot hasn't raised any objections for a while now...)\nKudo:\nSo, you young show-off! With that scrap of information, I'm throwing down the gauntlet! If I lose this one, I'll take it like a man and admit defeat!\nPhoenix:\nHe's really giving you the evil eye, Maya.\nMaya:\nIt's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, \"I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!\"\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to rise to the challenge then...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\nKudo:\nHmph! So what?\nPhoenix:\nLook carefully at the table. The vase is there... intact!\nKudo:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nLost your tongue, granddad?\nKudo:\n... I'm no granddad of yours, hop scotch!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow!\nJudge:\nEnough! If you throw any more seeds in this courtroom, the cleaners will be here all night.\nKudo:\nAaaaaah!\nJudge:\n... What is it now?\nKudo:\nI just remembered something!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes...? Go on...\nKudo:\nThe broken vase... Ha ha! It was on my table!\nPhoenix:\nWha...?\nKudo:\nAh, well... You see... It startled me when that young lad collapsed. So I stood up. That must've been when it fell over. The vase on my table, I mean.\nJudge:\nThe vase on your table?\nKudo:\nAh ha ha! Yes, it was on my table! And that's how my groin came to be completely soaked.\n.........\nJudge:\n*sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today.\nKudo:\nEr, I'd like to ask a question now. Have I, er... Have I been any use at all?\nJudge:\nPerhaps that's something you should reflect on yourself, Mr. Kudo.\nKudo:\nAaaargh! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else...\nJudge:\nBailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom!\nKudo:\nWAAAIT! LISTEN TO MEEEEEE!\nJudge:\nWell! We seem to have been considerably sidetracked. And I am still not in a position to deliver a verdict.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nThe defendant has not been positively identified as the waitress in question. Additionally, there are two disparities in the testimony we have heard thus far.\nPhoenix:\nThe mark on the coffee cup that the victim supposedly drank from with his left hand. And the earpiece which was inserted into his left ear, out of which he couldn't hear.\nMaya:\nWow, Nick! You did it!\nJudge:\nI therefore require both the defense and the prosecution to further investigate the facts.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nGodot:\n...\nJudge:\nThere is one more thing before I call today's session to an end.\nPhoenix:\nO-One more thing, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nThe witness we just heard from... He is most insistent that his testimony should be of use. So he's summarized it accordingly into this statement.\nPhoenix:\nUm... OK...\nJudge:\nYou may each have a copy of it, if you wish.\nGodot:\nWhatever. The prosecution doesn't need props like that.\nMaya:\nGodot's really mad, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I would be, too.\nJudge:\nVery well. Here you are then, Mr. Wright. There are 3 copies. My own, yours, and Mr. Godot's.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nVictor's Testimony added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(\"I'm sorry\"? This isn't a piece of testimony! More like a five year old's apology...)\nMaya:\nWhat the heck are we supposed to do with 3 copies...?\nJudge:\nThat is all. This court is adjourned!\nTo be continued.\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?\nJudge:\nUh... I'm not sure I follow you.\nPhoenix:\nIt clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...\nJudge:\nYou don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!\nJudge:\n...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really?\nJudge:\nObjection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHow exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?\nPhoenix:\nThey aren't, are they...\nJudge:\nNot at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde...\nGuilty\nJudge:\nThe accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!\nRecipe for Turnabout\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nJanuary 7, 12:52 PMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nSo how do you think the trial went this morning?\nPhoenix:\nHow do you think it went!?\nMaya:\nIt got a bit crazy in there. I just wonder if that killed our chances.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I guess it did get out of hand. Mr. Kudo's testimony did nothing to help us. Plus, now we don't even know the identity of the waitress who laced the coffee.\nMaya:\nAll we know is what old Mr. Kudo saw... The apron straps, and the ribbon.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that the victim was wearing an earpiece when his eardrum was ruptured.\nMaya:\nTalk about a terrifying case of contradictionitus.\nPhoenix:\nTime to play doctor and find ourselves a cure then, huh?\nMaya:\nYeah, we've gotta find one for Maggey, or she's going to have a terminal case of guilty!\nTalk\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nWell? I'm officially at a loss as to where to start.\nMaya:\nYeah, me too. Let's try some brainstorming. You go first.\nPhoenix:\nI guess we should try to put Mr. Kudo's testimony to some sort of use.\nMaya:\nYeah, that's true.\nPhoenix:\nAnd we need to figure out the identity of the waitress and who the victim really was... Somehow, I think the key to this case has got to be at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nMaya:\nWell then, let's go back there and check it out again. Oh! And we should drop in on Maggey and see how she's doing, too.\nAny ideas\nPhoenix:\nSo... Anything on your mind?\nMaya:\nActually, there is something...\nPhoenix:\n...?\nMaya:\nI was wondering about Xin Eohp... You know, like what he's like and stuff.\nPhoenix:\nOh, yeah. I almost forgot about that guy.\n???:\nI atta beat you so hard, it'll feel like youse were smoochin' the express train!\n???:\nPhoenix Wright? Youse sayin' YOU' Phoenix Wright?\n???:\nCause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only!\nPhoenix:\nActually... I've learned a little something about my doppelganger.\nMaya:\nHuh? You did? What did you find out?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah, Maya was working at the restaurant when I ran into Don Foneeonay...) Let's just say he was such a terrible version of me that I wanted to sue for defamation! (What's that guy's story, anyway? What does he have to gain by impersonating me?)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nThat badge is totally useless, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\nMaya:\nI mean, no one suspected that Xin Eohp wasn't a real lawyer. I bet he didn't have an attorney's badge!\nPhoenix:\n...I guess you're right.\nMaya:\nOr maybe he did have one! And maybe he switched your real one for a \"fugazzi\"!\nPhoenix:\nMy badge? A fake!? ... Ha ha ha... That's a good one, Maya...\nMaya:\nWhy the nervous laughter? ...Aha! I knew it! Your badge really IS fake, isn't it Nick?\nSports Paper\nMaya:\nThis doodle here... It was drawn by the victim, right?\nPhoenix:\nThis is a newspaper from the day of the incident, so, yeah, we've got to assume so. There must be a clue in there somewhere.\nMaya:\nI guess we should show it around and see if anyone can tell us more about it.\nMagazine Clipping\nMaya:\nI can't believe there's a fake Nick running around.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know. What's the deal with that? Why's he impersonating me?\nMaya:\nMaybe he's got something against you. People do tend to have a distinct distaste for you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(True enough... The only thing prosecutors seem to like about me is pushing me around...)\nMaya:\nOr... maybe he's got something against Maggey.\nPhoenix:\n(So he pretended to be me to get Maggey convicted?)\nScooter\nMaya:\nThat thing must've been in an accident. It's a total wreck!\nPhoenix:\nThat's what the guy I met at the park was riding. And I'm betting he's the fake me.\n???:\nGwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Cause I'M Phoenix Wright. The one and only!\nPhoenix:\nHis voice is still ringing in my ears.\nMaya:\nIntroduce me next time, Nick! I want to meet Xin Eohp, too!\nJean's Loan Contract\nMaya:\nA loan of half a million dollars! I wonder what Mr. Armstrong did to get into that much debt.\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to guess he spent money needlessly. You'd better watch your spending, too.\nMaya:\nHey, I've got a great idea! What if Mr. Armstrong charged $20,000 for the Twin-T set?\nPhoenix:\nIf you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back!\nVictor's Testimony\nMaya:\nA letter of apology from the old man? Aww, how sweet.\nPhoenix:\nActually, it's his \"testimony\"... If you can call it that.\nMaya:\nSo? What's it say? ...\"I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry.\"? Heh heh! I used to break things all the time when I was little, you know. And I used to have to write apologies all the time, too.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, Pearls and Adrian seem to have picked up where you left off...)\nCoffee Cup\nMaya:\nThat's the cup the poison was in, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and the stain on the rim shows that the victim used his right hand to pick it up.\nMaya:\nBut the old man swore he saw the victim pick it up with his left hand...\nPhoenix:\n(If Mr. Kudo wasn't mistaken, then what could account for this contradiction...?)\nVictim's Lottery Ticket\nMaya:\nMaybe I should try the lottery sometime, too.\nPhoenix:\nSure, why not? If you hit the jackpot, you could win half a million bucks.\nMaya:\nSo, what are you waiting for, Nick? Buy one!\nPhoenix:\nNo way! Don't you know the lottery is a tax on people who are bad at math!\nMaya:\nBlah. Fine then. At least I can add it to the newly renamed \"Paths to Wealth\"! I'll have to call Pearly later and have her add, \"Buy lottery tickets whenever possible.\"\nApron\nMaya:\nIt's almost surreal that this artsy apron is what got us this far.\nPhoenix:\nWell, as art goes, this piece definitely leaves an impression.\nMaya:\nI guess that means the old guy never saw the front of it, huh? Which means he didn't see the waitress's face, either...\nPotassium Cyanide\nMaya:\nI can't believe they found this in Maggey's pocket.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but she was passed out, right? So the killer could've easily planted it on her.\nMaya:\nWhere do you even get a hold of something like this? It's not like you can go down to your local CostMo' and buy it in bulk for $5 a pound!\nPhoenix:\n(She has got a point... How the killer got a hold of this poison is pretty important.)\nVictim's Prescription Bag\nMaya:\n\"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\". Hmm... I guess if your eardrum was ruptured, you couldn't listen to the radio, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It'd be pretty pointless to wear an earpiece of any kind.\nMaya:\nThe medication in the bag is missing too, right?\nPhoenix:\n(The mysterious vanishing medication... Much like our mysterious \"other person\"...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPhoenix:\nSo? How's your spirit medium training going?\nMaya:\nWell, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since then. I think Mia said it's because Maya's \"at a loss these days\"...)\nMia Fey profile\nPhoenix:\nMia really bailed me out again yesterday.\nMaya:\nArgh! That seedy old man was so rude to me! He didn't realize just how awesome I am. If he had, I bet he would've treated me better.\nPhoenix:\nSince when did you become so awesome?\nGodot profile\nMaya:\nGodot got it good today, huh? He was even smoking at me end there!\nPhoenix:\nHe'll have a new witness ready for tomorrow, though. You can count on it. (We need to figure out the facts before then, or we're doomed!)\nMaggey Byrde profile\nMaya:\nA lot of strange conflicting things kept popping up today in the trial, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and they seemed to come out of nowhere.\nMaya:\nThat's why we've gotta go talk with Maggey and get out this whole thing straightened out!\nPhoenix:\n(Maggey said that when she brought the victim his coffee... ...there was one more people sitting at the table. This single contradiction is probably the most important one we have to resolve...)\nGlen Elg profile\nMaya:\nHave you noticed the victims in our cases tend to be people we know nothing about, Nick? Take Glen Elg, for example.\nPhoenix:\nNow that you mention it...\nMaya:\nWe don't know what kind of guy he was, or why he was killed. I say it's time to get out there and find some answers!\nDick Gumshoe profile\nMaya:\nI really felt sorry for Gumshoe today. He really wanted to help Maggey out, but he kept getting backed into a corner.\nPhoenix:\nMaggey took it pretty bad, didn't she? Do you think she feels betrayed?\nMaya:\nMaybe. We've got to cheer her up somehow. She's a friend, after all.\nPhoenix:\n(A friend? Hmm... Never really thought of it that way, but I guess she is.)\nVictor Kudo profile\nMaya:\nIt's the seedy old man! What's his name again?\nPhoenix:\nVermin Kudo, is it? I can't remember, either. I've never seen a witness mess up so badly in court before.\nMaya:\nBetter stay away from him a while, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah. It might be more than seed that he chucks at me next time.)\nJean Armstrong profile\nMaya:\nThe chef's a witness too, right?\nPhoenix:\nI suppose so. He was in the kitchen at the time of the incident.\nMaya:\nWell, since Old Man Seeds's testimony is pretty much useless to us... ...I guess we should speak to Mr. Armstrong again, huh?\nJanuary 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nMaya:\nLooks like Gumshoe's not here.\nPhoenix:\nNever mind that. What's going on? It feels different in here somehow...\nMaya:\nYou think?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Everyone seems to be on edge.\nDetective:\nWhat are you doing!? Call in the officers for the briefing, quick! Can't you shut down the station's server? Chief! Quit playing on the Internet!\nChief:\nBut my e-mail pen pal, 1337aZnPrInceSz!\nDetective:\nSave it for later! I'm turning it off NOW!\nChief:\nNoooo! 1337aZnPrInceeeeeSz!!\nMaya:\nEveryone's keeping busy in here, huh?\nPhoenix:\nKeeping busy? More like panicking, if you ask me. (Something's going on. Something big...)\nExamine\nDetective on left\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nDetective:\n\"Even pickpockets can have their pockets picked.\" That's a keeper! Better to go with something that doesn't sound too much like a slogan.\nPhoenix:\n... He must be coming up with slogans for a crime prevention campaign... ...But I'm not sure even he knows what kind of crime he's trying to prevent.\nChief\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut.\nChief:\nOh, well. I guess I'll just have to write her a real letter instead of an email.\nPhoenix:\n(Alternately, you could write up some reports... Just a suggestion.)\nChief:\n\"Dear 1337aZnPrInceSz, How are you? I'm OK! How was the show last night...?\"\nMaya:\nWow, what an awesome job! Maybe I should send in my resume and become chief!\nBadgers\nMaya:\nHey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute!\nChief:\nThat's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police!\nPhoenix:\nSo what's with the pink one? It's new, right?\nMaya:\nShe's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\"! Right, Chief?\nChief:\nYup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\".\nMaya:\nSo one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"?\nChief:\nYou got it! They're both married.\nMaya:\nUm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief.\nChief:\nYou got it! That's marriage for you!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...)\nJanuary 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nI guess Maggey's still in questioning.\nMaya:\nBut! But we've got questions to ask her, too! Magg-ey! Magg-ey!\nPhoenix:\nKeep it down, Maya! This isn't a playground, you know!\nJanuary 7Tr\u00e9s Bien\nMaya:\nEmpty, as usual.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and it's lunchtime, too.\n???:\nThat's it! Come on, come on, come on!\nPhoenix:\nHey, that sounds like...\nGumshoe:\nNow just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can!\nMaya:\nHe's getting really worked up about something.\nGumshoe:\nNoooooo! That's the wrong number! Argh! Look like an \"8\" would have only netted me five bucks anyway! What a rip off!\nMaya:\nWhat's the problem, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? Oh, it's you... I, uh... I was uh... Hah hah! I was just... Hah hah hah! I was just listening to the radio, pal.\nPhoenix:\nTo the radio?\nMaya:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe's having lunch here!\nPhoenix:\n(He is! And he's having the Twin-T set...)\nGumshoe:\nAha ha ha... What can I say...?\nExamine\nFront entrance\nPhoenix:\nIt's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French.\nMaya:\nIt could say \"Entrance\" or \"Exit\", too. Did you think of that?\nMagazine rack\nMaya:\nIt's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya?\nMaya:\nYeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh?\nTable\nPhoenix:\nThis table's set nicely. It just needs a customer.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. Do you think Old Seedy was talking about a vase like this today in court?\nPhoenix:\nIt does look like it's ready to fall over any second. Looks kind of fragile, too.\nMaya:\nI bet if Mr. Armstrong charged 10,000 dollars for every vase a customer broke... ...he'd be able to pay off his loan really quickly.\nPhoenix:\nIf you hit people with that kind of bill, Maya, they will hit you back!\nWindows\nPhoenix:\nWow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there.\nMaya:\nReally!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing.\nPhoenix:\nGot ya! I was just kidding, Maya.\nMaya:\nNick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't.\nPhoenix:\n(...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.)\nPartition\nPhoenix:\nThis restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left.\nMaya:\nWow, you really can't see the table in front or behind you at all! It's the perfect setup for slipping poison into your enemy's coffee.\nTalk\nToday's trial\nGumshoe:\nThis is a nightmare! How am I supposed to look Maggey in the eye now, pal!?\nMaya:\nYou really drove her into a corner, you know.\nGumshoe:\nYou always blow apart my testimony! Why, of all days, didn't you do it today!?\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... There just weren't any holes in it... for once!\nMaya:\nYeah, what happened? Usually, your testimonies are like Swiss cheese!\nGumshoe:\nS-Swiss cheese...?\nPhoenix:\n(Would he have preferred, \"crumbly like aged parmesan\"? Anyway, this case has already been ruled on. There shouldn't be any holes left to find.)\nGumshoe:\nSo... Did Maggey say anything to you? About me, I mean.\nMaya:\nWell, um... How did she put it again...?\nByrde:\nI can't believe Detective Gumshoe! I hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again!\nMaya:\nSomething like that.\nGumshoe:\nWah... Waaaaaaaaaah!\nMaya:\nP-Please! Detective Gumshoe! I didn't mean...\nGumshoe:\nWhy!? Why is this happening!?\nMaya:\nHe's banging his head against the wall, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, man... Poor Gumshoe...)\nLunch special\nPhoenix:\nSo, did you like the Twin-T set?\nGumshoe:\nI've never paid that much money for lunch before. I was so nervous, my hands were shaking.\nMaya:\nSo? How did it taste!?\nGumshoe:\nWell... For 20 bucks, I guess... I dunno how to describe it, really. It was... delicate.\nMaya:\nDelicate?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you liked it!? It didn't taste bad to you?\nGumshoe:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter with him?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like he's thinking...\nGumshoe:\n... That's it! I've been trying to think of the right word to describe the taste. I just got it right now... \"Bad\"! That's it. It tasted bad!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*\nGumshoe:\nIt's kinda hard to admit it to yourself when you pay 20 bucks though, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe he should've found out about the price AFTER he had finished eating...)\nMaya:\nMaybe that's why Glen Elg came here. Maybe he heard about the famous Twin-T set!\nPhoenix:\n(Glen Elg, the victim, huh... Which reminds me. We still hardly know anything about the guy.)\nMaya:\nWhy don't we ask Gumshoe what he knows, seeing as he's here?\nThe radio\nMaya:\nSo what were you all excited about earlier?\nGumshoe:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right! You said you were listening to the radio or something.\nGumshoe:\nOh, that? That was nothing! I-I wasn't excited!\nMaya:\nCome on, Detective Gumshoe! You can tell little ol' me! What were you listening to?\nGumshoe:\nN-Nothing, really. It was just the, um... \"Daily Exercise Show\"!\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nPhoenix:\n(What the...!? A Psyche-Lock?)\nGumshoe:\nHah hah hah! Mmm... This lunch special's lobster is great!\nMaya:\nThen why are there tears in your eyes...?\nThe radio (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Lock)\nMaya:\nCome on, Detective Gumshoe. You can tell us what you were listening to on the radio.\nGumshoe:\nBut I already told you. It was the, um... the... weather forecast, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Didn't you say it was an exercise program earlier!?)\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nGumshoe:\nIt was nothing, really. Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(Even if it's nothing, the fact that he's hiding it makes me really curious!)\nThe radio (after breaking Psyche-Lock)\nGumshoe:\nI'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's with everyone and the lottery...?\nMaya:\nSo? How did it go?\nGumshoe:\nI won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck! I was so mad!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I know the feeling.)\nGumshoe:\nI bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg, see. (Changed from [I bought the same kind of ticket as Mr. Elg.] in the original release) And they've got this special radio show where they announce the winning numbers. (Changed from [When they read those results out on the radio, it really gets your heart pumping!] in the original release) They even do the drawings live on the air! It's intense, pal! (Changed from [You know they broadcast it live when they're picking the numbers? It's intense, pal!] in the original release)\nMaya:\nI bet that's what Mr. Elg was listening to on the day he was killed. (Changed from [I bet that's what Glen was listening to on the day he was killed.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYeah. What time is it now?\nGumshoe:\nUh, it's... It's just after 1:30.\nPhoenix:\nAnd are the lottery results always broadcast at the same time?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Look, I got this flyer when I bought the ticket.\nMillionaire Radio Flyer added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\n\"Millionaire Radio\"? That sounds cool! I want to try it, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nThen buy a ticket, Maya. With your own money!\nThe radio (subsequent times)\nGumshoe:\nI'm usually pretty lucky so I figured I'd give it a try.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's with everyone and the lottery...?\nMaya:\nSo? How did it go?\nGumshoe:\nI won 50 cents! It'd be better to win nothing at all than half a lousy buck!

With your own money!\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nGumshoe:\nIs that thing real, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhy does everybody keep asking me that?\nGumshoe:\nI wonder what this phony of yours is like...\nPhoenix:\nHe had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you?\nGumshoe:\nIt tells me the guy is cruising for a bruising!\nMaya:\nYou're really caring, aren't you, Detective Gumshoe? About Maggey, I mean.\nMagatama (after clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, before breaking Psyche-Lock)\nPhoenix:\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\n-- The Radio --\nPhoenix:\nAlright, Detective Gumshoe, tell me the truth. What were you listening to?\nGumshoe:\nNo way, pal. Now that you've made a big thing out of it, I'm not gonna tell you...\nPhoenix:\nWe'll see about that, pal. Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening... ...it's pretty clear what kind of radio program it was. I'd say it was related to...\nPresent Victim's Lottery Ticket\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I'm right, aren't I?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWell, Detective Gumshoe!?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! That's it, pal! You got me. You sure are something!\nPhoenix:\n(Then how come I'm still seeing the lock? Guess I was wrong... Now, what was it he shouting when he was listening to the radio...?)\nGumshoe:\nThat's it! Come on, come on, come on!\nGumshoe:\nNow just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can!\nGumshoe:\nNoooooo! That's the wrong number!\nPhoenix:\n(It seems so obvious... I'd better ask him again.)\nGumshoe:\nD-Don't tell me you're not through yet...\nLeads back to:\n\"Considering all the noise you were making while you were listening...\"\nPhoenix:\nI'm right, aren't I? You were listening to the lottery results, weren't you? You thought you'd try to win big, just like Glen Elg did!\nGumshoe:\nI-It's... It's like you can see right through me!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? I've cracked him already...?)\nGumshoe:\nThat's why I said it was nothing!\nUnlock Successful\nSports Paper\nGumshoe:\nThat's the sports paper the victim wrote something in, right? ...\nMaya:\nWhat is it?\nGumshoe:\nI know I've heard that name somewhere before... \"MC Bomber\"... Yeah... I heard it real recently, too...\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!)\nGumshoe:\nAck, it's no good. I can't remember...\nPhoenix:\n(...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.)\nLunch Special\nGumshoe:\nI haven't got anything to say about that, pal. ... Just take it away already, please?\nPhoenix:\n(Spending 20 dollars on this has got to be killing him inside...)\nScooter\nGumshoe:\nHey! Are you putting this up for sale, pal?\nPhoenix:\nN-No! Why, would you want a busted up scooter like this anyway?\nMaya:\nYeah. Plus, the seat's all covered in pigeon poop!\nGumshoe:\nWho cares? If it runs, that's all that matters to me.\nPhoenix:\n(My phony was riding this bike... Maybe if I head back to the park. it'll be there again.)\nVictim's Lottery Ticket\nGumshoe:\nA one-way ticket to happiness, huh?\nPhoenix:\nGlen Elg died because of this ticket.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but it's still a one-way ticket to happiness, pal.\nPhoenix:\nAnd Maggey was found guilty of murder because of it, too.\nGumshoe:\n...\nMaya:\n...Looks like anything about Maggey is an instant conversation stopper.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. He's got a real soft spot for her, and it obviously hurts when you hit it!\nApron\nGumshoe:\nThat's the apron Maggey was wearing. Yeah, it still smells like her, too.\nMaya:\nDoes this mean Maggey smells like ketchup?\nVictim's Prescription Bag\nGumshoe:\nWe never did find the contents of that bag.\nMaya:\nIt was medicine for Mr. Elg's ruptured eardrum, right?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. We found traces of it in his left ear canal. He must've used it while he was at Tr\u00e9s Bien. We're sure of that much.\nMillionaire Radio Flyer\nGumshoe:\nApparently everyone's listening to this show now.\nMaya:\nThat's because everyone wants money.\nGumshoe:\nThey say that the victim, Glen Elg, was really into gambling.\nMaya:\nYep. You can't beat gambling! I love it, too! I won 500 dollars last night playing cards with Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? We were playing for money!?\nMaya:\nOf course! So you'd better pay up!\nGumshoe:\nYou're a smart one! ...Waiting for a cop to be present before asking for the cash!\nGodot profile\nGumshoe:\nMr. Godot agreed to take this case just so he could face you, pal. He was working on a bunch of more important cases, but he cancelled them all...\nMaya:\nHuh? But then... ...why didn't Mr. Godot take this case... ...when Maggey's first trial came up?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. that is kinda odd. I mean, everyone thought the defense was \"Phoenix Wright\". So why didn't he try to fight \"me\" then?\nGumshoe:\nWell, according to Mr. Godot... ...he knew the guy was a phony right away, so he didn't want to bother with the trial.\nPhoenix:\n(He couldn't be bothered to tell the judge!?)\nMaggey Byrde profile\nGumshoe:\nMaggey's probably crying all alone right now, huh...\nMaya:\nYeah, thanks to you.\nGumshoe:\nAaaaaaargh! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!\nPhoenix:\nMaya! Don't torch poor Gumshoe feelings like they're are some sort of cheap cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e!\nMaya:\nYou're really crazy about Maggey, aren't you?\nGumshoe:\nNo! No, no! I'm just... I'm not... It's not that I...\nPhoenix:\n(You don't have to hide it, Gumshoe! It's pretty obvious.)\nMaya:\nYeah, you're way too plain-looking for Maggey. Right?\nGumshoe:\nI'd arrest you right now if you weren't so right...\nGlen Elg profile\nGumshoe:\nThis guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked.\nMaya:\nWhat happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!?\nPhoenix:\n(*groan* He wasn't LITERALLY a computer, Maya!) (Changed from [*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. That's what we found out yesterday, too.\nMaya:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe. Don't you have any information that's a bit more fun?\nGumshoe:\nF-Fun? I, uh... Oh! I know! So, have you paid a visit to where Elg worked yet? You might as well.\nMaya:\nHis workplace? Where's that?\nGumshoe:\nA computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" or something like that.\nMaya:\nSounds like a real stable company. This could be fun, Nick. Let's go!\nPhoenix:\nComputers aren't really my thing, Maya.\nMaya:\nWe'll be fine! I know all about that hi-tech stuff.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder about that...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's just around the corner from this joint. You should take a look.\nPhoenix:\n(A computer firm called \"Blue Screens, Inc.\" huh...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nI know I look a little rough around the edges. But the truth is, I'm a lot more \"detective-like\" than I used to be.\nMaya:\nReally? Like what part?\nGumshoe:\n...Like the color of my coat.\nMaya:\nAh! You're right!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, but what about what's inside the coat...?)\nVictor Kudo profile\nGumshoe:\nYou know, in all my years, I've never seen a witness who was that confused before.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you looked pretty confused by his testimony.\nGumshoe:\nNothing against old guys, I like them and all... But... He sounded like he was pretty sure about what he saw.\nMaya:\nYeah, that's the impression I got, too!\nPhoenix:\n(Me, three... But then, why doesn't even a single part of his testimony corroborate any of the facts?)\nJean Armstrong profile\nGumshoe:\nYou know what that chef said to me? \"Oh l\u00e1 l\u00e1! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle.\nMaya:\nWhat's in it?\nGumshoe:\nI don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". But I'll tell you want. This stuff works like a charm. I slept like a rock last night.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, really... That's nice...\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal... I can't discuss anything connected to the case.\nMaya:\nHey! I thought you said you were going to help us out!\nGumshoe:\nI can't help you out if I don't have any info!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I suppose the retrial has only just begun...\nJanuary 7Vitamin Square\nMaya:\nHmm... I don't see any sign of Mr. Kudo. Do you?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he went to buy another ton of bird seeds. I was kind of hoping he wouldn't be here, anyway. At least, not for now. (Besides, any more seeds today and I'm liable to turn into a real phoenix!)\nExamine\nScooter\nMaya:\nHey, check this out...\nPhoenix:\nI wouldn't get too close to that if I were you. Otherwise you might be in for a shock. My phony must be lurking someplace nearby... Just imagine! A Tiger, loose in the city!\nMaya:\nMeanwhile the real Phoenix is like an abandoned chick, lost in a vast urban jungle!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nDon't worry. Someday, you'll grow up and become a ferocious tiger, too! Don't lose hope!\nPhoenix:\n(Why is she trying to pep-talk me into becoming my phony...?)\nOrange\nMaya:\nLooking at this orange reminds me...\nPhoenix:\nOf what?\nMaya:\nThat you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know.\nPhoenix:\nSpeaking of fun, if we get Maggey acquitted, may be can all get together sometime.\nMaya:\nOK! ...But what do we play with someone who's never even won a game of Tic-Tac-Toe?\nPhoenix:\nHow about we change the rules a bit, then? We could play Old Maid, and... um... We could say the person who's left with the old maid at the end is the winner. How's that?\nMaya:\nNot bad... Not bad at all! We could even rename the game to \"Fair Maiden\"!\nJanuary 7Tr\u00e9s BienKitchen\nMaya:\nHuh? Mr. Armstrong's talking to someone.\n???:\nI'll be back next month.\nArmstrong:\nOui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you!\n???:\nIf you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here.\nArmstrong:\nNon! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise!\n???:\nI love fire, you know... I love the way it crackles... Hee... Hee... Hee...\nArmstrong:\nNon, non, non! Stop it! I beg you!\n???:\nThen don't let me down... I'll be watching you...\nArmstrong:\nMais, non! Z'is is not necessary! You can trust me, mademoiselle!\n???:\nTalk to anyone... and I'll drive a knife... right through your heart.\nArmstrong:\nOh, non! You do not 'ave to worry. You know, you worry far too much. Maybe z'is will 'elp you relax. It is la oil of sandalwood.\n???:\nI do love... raw meat... from time to time... Hee... Hee... Hee...\nArmstrong:\nAaaaah!\n???:\nI'll be taking my leave... Goodbye... for now!\nArmstrong:\nUrgh! I 'ave la shivers! I must rub some of my oil all over my body before I become z'e nervous wreck! Z'ere. Oh, oui, oui! Z'at feels good!\nPhoenix:\nUrgh!\nArmstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0! Excusez-moi, monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nM-My eyes! My EYES!\nArmstrong:\nYour eyes? If you 'ave trouble wi'z your eyes, you need z'is. La oil of sandalwood!\nPhoenix:\nIsn't this just the leftovers of what you were just using!?\nExamine\nStove\nMaya:\nMmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricass\u00e9e with balsamic vinaigrette.\nPhoenix:\nIsn't that what I ate yesterday for lunch?\nMaya:\nYeah, I think it's been permanently burned into my brain now... ...as an example of what truly awful food tastes like.\nPhoenix:\n(I bet it'd taste really good if it was prepared well. ...Balsamy even!)\nTalk\nTr\u00e9s Bien\nPhoenix:\nYou don't exactly have many customers, do you, Mr. Armstrong?\nArmstrong:\nNon, you are right, monsieur. But per'aps z'at is la perfect time for you to visit me, non? Now I can give you my undivided attention, and cook for you la dish supr\u00eame!\nPhoenix:\nPutting on a brave face, huh?\nMaya:\nThat's what girls do, Nick!\nArmstrong:\nBut you are right. Business is very difficult z'ese days. Per'aps ze name is la problem. People do not understand it. Z'ey think it is \"tray\". I just wanted people to think z'at my restaurant was exclusive.\nPhoenix:\nBut they think you just serve fast food on cheap, plastic trays?\nMaya:\nNick! That's the kind of thing that can make a girl cry!\nPhoenix:\nHave you forgotten that Mr. Armstrong is a man, Maya?\nArmstrong:\nBut z'is restaurant is my life! It is everything to me! I will defend it to la finale! No one will take it from me!\nThe woman just now\nPhoenix:\nSo who was that woman you were just talking to?\nArmstrong:\nOh l\u00e1 l\u00e1! You saw z'at?\nPhoenix:\nAh, well... Yes. Sorry.\nMaya:\nSo? Who was she!? She looked so polite and graceful.\nArmstrong:\nP-Polite!? G-Graceful!?\nMaya:\nAnd she likes raw meat and fires, right?\n???:\nI'll be back next month.\nArmstrong:\nOui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you!\n???:\nIf you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here.\nArmstrong:\nNon! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise!\nPhoenix:\n(Now that I think about it...) Hey, Maya... I think it's pretty clear what kind of conversation they were having.\nMaya:\nYou think so? Well, then let's show him that piece of evidence and see what happens!\nThe woman just now (appears after presenting Jean's Loan Contract)\nPhoenix:\nThe woman who was here earlier... I take it that she's... um...\nArmstrong:\nWhy 'as it come to z'is...? What a tragedy! Suddenly I find myself so deep in la debt. It is a sign of la bad, bad world we live in, uh?\nPhoenix:\n(No. I'd say it's more of a sign of la bad, bad culinary skills...)\nArmstrong:\nZ'e woman who was 'ere... Z'e scary woman... She is from la loan office.\nPhoenix:\nLoan office? Is that where you borrowed half a million dollars from?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Tender Lender, it is called.\nMaya:\nCatchy name. Just hearing it makes me wanna borrow some money.\nArmstrong:\nPlease! You must not borrow from z'em. If you must, no more z'an ten dollars!\nPhoenix:\nTen dollars? Sounds like your whole monthly stipend, Maya...\nMaya:\nHey! I get a bit more than that, thank you very much!\nPhoenix:\nSo Tender Lender is the loan office you borrowed half a million from, huh?\nMaya:\nI wonder if they've got anything to do with this case...\nTender Lender (appears after \"The woman just now\")\nArmstrong:\nI am a weak woman. When I am upset, I 'ave to buy something nice to cheer me up. Thanks to 'im loaning me la money, I 'ave to pay back 'alf a million dollars now! I am like 'is slave. I 'ave to do everything z'at 'e tells me.\nMaya:\nUm... Who's this he?\nArmstrong:\nLa Tiger...\nMaya:\nThe Tiger?\nArmstrong:\nOui. 'E is la manager of z'e Tender Lender. A terrifying man! La big city mobster! When 'e shouts at me, my knees are trembling and 'is voice is ringing in my ears for 3 days! As soon as I 'ear la noise of z'at battered old scooter 'e rides, I start to cry!\nPhoenix:\n(A big city mobster who rides a battered old scooter...?) Um, does this guy resemble me by any chance?\nArmstrong:\nOh, non, non, non! Z'is man 'as a presence! A most formidable personality! Although... Oui, 'e does 'ave la spikey 'air just like you. Oui, z'ere is a resemblance z'ere, I suppose.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Sounds like this loan office is worth checking out after all...)\nArmstrong:\nIf you want to visit z'e Tender Lender, it is just beyond Vitamin Square.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... If you need money, I can loan you some... As long as it's less than 3 dollars...\nPhoenix:\nUm... Thanks for the offer... (...Just beyond Vitamin Square, huh?)\nPresent\nMagatama\nArmstrong:\nOh, what a beautiful pendant! It would look stunning on me w'iz la earrings!\nMaya:\nPlease don't steal it again, OK? It's one of a kind!\nArmstrong:\nI could just 'ave a sliver of it, non?\nMaya:\nI-It's not a block of cheese, you know!\nSports Paper\nPhoenix:\nThis is the paper the victim brought with him.\nArmstrong:\n\"MC Bomber\"...? Oui...\nMaya:\nDoes that mean something to you?\nArmstrong:\nNon, I only speak French, mademoiselle.\nMaya:\nBut we found it behind your magazine rack...\nArmstrong:\nOh, 'ow naughty I am! I 'aven't cleaned for such a long time!\nLunch Special\nArmstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0! So you 'ave eaten my lunch, oui? Tell me, monsieur. Did you enjoy la lunch I prepared for you?\nPhoenix:\nIt was a... unique and... wild mixture of flavors.\nMaya:\nThat was the first time I ever had lobster, you know!\nArmstrong:\nLobster? Z'ere was no lobster in my lunch...\nMaya:\nHuh? But, it said, \"lobster\" right on the menu.\nArmstrong:\nMademoiselle Maya. Please, you must read la menu more carefully. It says, \"A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricass\u00e9e with a balsamic vinaigrette.\nMaya:\nOh. It's \"inspired\", is it?\nArmstrong:\nOui. \"Inspired\" by z'ese ingredients, but not per'aps made from z'em, n'est-ce pas?\nMaya:\nWell, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(The way the lunch tasted, it's probably 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.)\nScooter\nArmstrong:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat is it?\nArmstrong:\nIs z'is your scooter?\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! I saw it before in Vitamin Square, you see...\nArmstrong:\nMon dieu! Non, non, non! Take it away! Do not show z'at to me!\nPhoenix:\n(Talk about an allergic reaction...)\nJean's Loan Contract\nArmstrong:\nSo long as z'at paper exists, I am but a delightful angel w'iz la broken wings!\nMaya:\nAn angel, huh...? Doesn't bode well, when you think about it...\nArmstrong:\nOui! Z'ey kept 'arassing me month after month. In z'e end, I 'ad to give in. I agreed to 'elp z'em.\nMaya:\nHelp them? With what?\nArmstrong:\nMais bien s\u00fbr, if I did not owe z'em la money, I would 'ave refused. But my 'ands were tied!\nPhoenix:\nPlease! What did you agree to help them with?\nArmstrong:\nNon. I-I cannot say! If I tell you, z'at woman, she will slice me up... ...and eat me w'iz la salad garnish!\nPhoenix:\n(Eww! I hope he doesn't mean that he'll literally be sliced up and served with garnish...) I'm going to guess that woman has something to do with your loan contract. Am I right?\nArmstrong:\nAh!\nMaya:\nPlease, Mr. Armstrong, tell us about that woman!\nVictor's Testimony\nArmstrong:\nAh, it is true. My vases are broken all z'e time. I bought a new one z'e next day after la incident. But z'ey wouldn't let me put it on la table because of la investigation.\nVictim's Lottery Ticket\nArmstrong:\nIf only I 'ad taken z'e right lottery ticket... I would not 'ave any debts right now. I would be free!\nMaya:\nLook on the right side, Mr. Armstrong. You won a dollar, right?\nPhoenix:\n(A lack of remorse for having stolen something: Priceless.)\nMaya Fey profile\nArmstrong:\nOh l\u00e0, l\u00e0! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip!\nMaya:\nWho, me?\nArmstrong:\nOui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas?\nMaya:\nUm... Sure!\nArmstrong:\nYou 'ave la perfect face for a waitress, you know.\nMaya:\nUm, thanks. I guess if things don't work out someday, then maybe I'll be back.\nPhoenix:\n(What things? Is she talking about her being a spirit medium...?)\nMaggey Byrde profile\nArmstrong:\nOh, 'ow it 'urts me to see z'at poor girl's face!\nPhoenix:\nMaggey's?\nArmstrong:\nI 'eard she was super'umanly un'appy.\nMaya:\nSuperhumanly...?\nArmstrong:\nAnd if she 'adn't come to work for me, she wouldn't 'ave got into z'is mess.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? I'm missing something here, aren't I?)\nArmstrong:\nJe suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9, Maggey! Forgive me!\nAfter presenting Glen Elg profile in Tr\u00e9s Bien:\nJanuary 7Blue Screens, Inc.\nMaya:\nWow! This place is so hi-tech! You can almost smell the electricity in the air!\nPhoenix:\nIt is a computer firm, Maya. They can't work without electricity, you know.\n???:\nWho are you?\nMaya:\nOh, umm... Hello...\n???:\nI'm sorry. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only. This is a computer programming laboratory. There are far too many trade secrets that could be leaked.\nMaya:\nWow! What secrets!?\n???:\nEverything you see here is classified. No information can leave this building.\nMaya:\nUnderstood!\nPhoenix:\n(Who is this woman? She's like a robot from some kind of whacked edumacational show...)\nBasil:\nMy name is Lisa Basil. I'm the company director.\nPhoenix:\nD-Director!? (Sh-She's human!? She seems more like a ghost in a shell. And that thing over her eye... Isn't that the same device as Glen Elg's?)\nMaya:\nThat's an [sic] DMH, right?\nPhoenix:\nNice try, but it's the other way around, Maya. It's an HMD.\nBasil:\nAll of my programmers here at Blue Screens, Inc. are supplied with HMDs.\nMaya:\nThen do you write programs, too?\nBasil:\nNo. I just enjoy wearing this.\nMaya:\nThey ARE pretty cool! I wouldn't mind one!\nExamine\nPillars\nPhoenix:\nThose pillars almost look like they're moving. It's kind of unsettling.\nMaya:\nNah, they just look a bit twisted or warped or whatever word I'm looking for...\nBasil:\nThis office was designed with a futuristic feel in mind.\nMaya:\nFuturistic?\nBasil:\nYes. We tried to imagine what things might look like in the future when we designed it. It helps to soothe and calm the soul.\nMaya:\n... On second thought, I agree with you, Nick. This place is really unsettling.\nSuper computer\nMaya:\nHey, look Nick! It's a super-computer! It looks like it's really smart and wise, doesn't it?\nPhoenix:\nComputers are only as smart as the humans who use them, Maya.\nMaya:\nThat explains why we don't use the computer in our office!\nPhoenix:\nYou work there too, Maya.\nMaya:\nYeah, but at least I'm...\nBasil:\nPlease. Don't argue about something that's so trivial. Otherwise the computer will laugh at you.\nMaya:\nShe said she'd laugh at us, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(She's a human, Maya, not a computer!)\nProgrammers\nPhoenix:\nHe's really pounding that keyboard, isn't he?\nMaya:\nWow! I bet that's where the \"pro\" in \"programmer\" comes from, huh? I guess I shouldn't be resting on my laurels. Gotta expand my skill set and all that.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's a good idea.\nMaya:\nMaybe I could become Old Seedy's apprentice.\nPhoenix:\n(Um... And what about your spirit medium training?)\nTickets on floor\nMaya:\nWow! Look at this mess!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they're all betting tickets.\nMaya:\nWhat kind of betting tickets?\nPhoenix:\nFor betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets.\nMaya:\nOh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these...\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.)\nGlen Elg's Losing Horse Racing Tickets gathered up.\nMaya:\nThis many tickets would get you... what? A buck down at the recycling center? But I didn't know you were so hard up that you'd try to profit from the dead, Nick. (Changed from [You're hopeless, Nick. You know that?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(I'm just taking them as evidence, Maya!)\nTickets on floor (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nWow! Look at this mess!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they're all betting tickets.\nMaya:\nWhat kind of betting tickets?\nPhoenix:\nFor betting on which horse will win a given race. They're horse racing tickets.\nMaya:\nOh, wow... His drawers are stuffed full of these...\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like they're all losing tickets, though.)\nHorse calendar\nMaya:\nWhoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess!\nPhoenix:\nLooks pretty average to me.\nMaya:\nBut you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this.\nPhoenix:\nYou think? Real whiz-kids can work under any condition, you know.\nMaya:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(She's trying to hint that I should tidy my desk more. I'll clean up my desk when Maya stops asking silly questions... No hurry then.)\nMaya:\nHey! This calendar...\nPhoenix:\nWhat about it...? If this is another hint about tidying, you can forget it.\nMaya:\nSomeone's marked December 3rd in red pen!\nPhoenix:\nDecember 3rd? That's the day Mr. Elg was murdered! Is there anything else?\nMaya:\nYeah. Umm... It says, \"Meet with The Tiger.\"\nPhoenix:\nThe T-Tiger?\nGlen's Calendar added to the Court Record.\nHorse calendar (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nWhoa! Look at this desk, Nick! What a mess!\nPhoenix:\nLooks pretty average to me.\nMaya:\nBut you can't get any work done with everything all over the place like this.\nPhoenix:\nYou think?

No hurry then.)\nTalk\nBlue Screens, Inc.\nPhoenix:\nSo... What exactly is this firm's business?\nBasil:\nI will try to simplify it so that you can understand... We analyze the data management systems required by certain branches of industry... ...and deliver optimum operating system and source-level components.\nMaya:\nHuh? You lost me on the corner of Analyze and Management.\nPhoenix:\nIt doesn't matter. They analyze stuff. You got that much, right?\nBasil:\nThe software we produce is distributed on CDs.\nMaya:\nCDs...?\nBasil:\nYes. Compact disc. Digital optical storage media.\nPhoenix:\n(Of course, CDs are used for software as well as music...)\nBasil:\nIt is a small firm, but all of my employees are first-class programmers. Let's ask one of them what they are doing. Excuse me. What are you working on right now?\nProgrammer:\nI'm researching the impact of time-slicing common areas in multi-threaded code on logical access to shared global variables. Obviously, program structure heavily influences response time and performance, so the co-independence of global variables and memory overheads is vitally important to the success of the execution.\nBasil:\nWell, you get the idea. This is the sort of thing we are involved in. Did you good people follow all of that?\nMaya:\nY-Y-Yeah...\nPhoenix:\n(Your blank smile just said otherwise, Maya.)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nYou know about what happened, right, Ms. Basil?\nBasil:\nYou mean about Glen being poisoned? Yes, I know. It's terrible.\nMaya:\nCan you tell us anything that might be helpful?\nBasil:\nI don't think so. A police officer was here earlier, too. But I couldn't tell him anything either, because... ...the waitress who committed the crime has nothing to do with Blue Screens, Inc.\nMaya:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nHow about Mr. Elg's desk? Have you cleared it out already?\nBasil:\nNo, not yet. It's the one, right in front of you. If there's anything that might be useful to you, you are welcome to take it.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there might be a clue here somewhere...)\nGlen's troubles (appears after presenting Glen Elg profile)\nPhoenix:\nUm, about Mr. Elg... Was he in some kind of trouble?\nBasil:\nI'm sorry? Why would you think that?\nPhoenix:\nI thought you said something about it just now? You said he got himself into trouble because he was a bit of a \"loser\".\nBasil:\n...\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(Three Psyche-Locks?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nI guess Mr. Elg is like every other man with his pile of secrets.\nGlen's troubles (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nPlease tell us more about the trouble that Mr. Elg was in.\nBasil:\nI'm sorry. I don't know anything about that.\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nBasil:\nI do not pry into other people's affairs.\nMaya:\nShe just gave us the dreaded \"professional, business-like cold-shoulder\", huh?\nPhoenix:\n(I need to find out exactly what the victim was involved in. Looks like I've got to break her in a \"professional, business-like\" manner!)\nPresent\nGlen Elg profile\nPhoenix:\nUm, about Mr. Elg...\nBasil:\nHe was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. But he did suffer from one or two bugs in his personality.\nMaya:\nOh? Like what?\nBasil:\nHe was a bit of a \"loser\"... Perhaps that would be the best way to describe it. That's what got him into trouble... ...\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter?\nBasil:\nHe was a top programmer. I would even say he was a genius. So he was really no trouble at all. A model employee.\nPhoenix:\nHey, wait a minute! Just now you said something about him being in trouble! (We've got to find out what this trouble was exactly.)\nAnything else\nMaya:\nUmm, would you mind taking a look at this?\nBasil:\nI'm sorry. That data is SuPer-Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected.\nMaya:\nSuPer Admin Restricted Desktop Access password-protected!? What!? This is madness!\nPhoenix:\nNo, Maya. That is SPARDA. She won't tell us unless we say the right code word.\nMaya:\nA code word? Hmm... ... Sesame!\nBasil:\n...\nMaya:\nIf it's not \"sesame\", then it must be her mother's maiden name. That's how it always is.\nPhoenix:\nThere's no point in having a password if it's always the same thing, Maya. (I guess she just doesn't want to talk about this.)\nMaya:\nMaybe we should focus on asking about Glen Elg. What do you say?\nTr\u00e9s Bien\nPresent\nLisa Basil profile\nGumshoe:\nThat lady is the boss of Blue Screens, Inc., pal. Yeah... I figure she's clean. She got nothing to hide. She seemed kinda like a doll to me. In a good way and a bad way. ... Kinda makes you think she might be hiding something.\nTr\u00e9s Bien (after breaking Psyche-Lock, then clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Tr\u00e9s Bien, and clearing \"Tender Lender\" Talk option in Tr\u00e9s Bien - Kitchen)\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'm gonna head back to the precinct now. We've got a big meeting starting in a bit.\nMaya:\nAbout Maggey's case, you mean?\nGumshoe:\nNo, that's pretty much wrapped up now... There's another big case going down at the moment, so she's been pushed aside...\nMaya:\nOK. Well, see you later then.\nGumshoe:\nBye!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\n......\nPhoenix:\n......... Y-You better get going, Detective, or you'll be late.\nGumshoe:\nActually, I, um... I've kinda got a favor to ask. It's a big one!\nPhoenix:\nA favor?\nGumshoe:\nYeah... It's for, um... Maggey, actually. I was kinda hoping... you'd give this to her for me.\nMaya:\nWhat is it?\nGumshoe:\nIt's a lunchbox. I got up early so I could make it. I've been real worried about her. She looked like she'd lost a lot of weight.\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe... ... How many weenies are in here!? There's not a person on earth who could down this much meat.\nGumshoe:\nYou think? I love weenies. I can't get enough of their tender juiciness. So will you give to her? It took me ages to make, so please say you will, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't exactly say no, can I?)\nGumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya to carry.\nMaya:\nMaybe I'll eat it myself if I get hungry!\nGumshoe:\nDon't forget, OK? I'm counting on you to give that to Maggey.\nPhoenix:\n(He's finally gone...)\nJanuary 7Tender Lender\nMaya:\n...This place gives off a really strange vibe, doesn't it?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like \"The Tiger\" isn't in his lair. (And that is, as they say, a very good thing.)\n???:\n...Welcome...\nPhoenix:\n*gulp* (Talk about a creepy voice! It makes your soul want to shrivel up and die!)\n???:\nYou're here... to discuss a loan...?\nPhoenix:\nUh, no. Not exactly...\n???:\nThe manager is away at the moment... Wait quietly... please...\nMaya:\nShe's gone! Just like that!\nPhoenix:\nI guess we'll just have to come back another time.\nMaya:\nBut this is the perfect opportunity, Nick! This place reeks of suspicion! Come on, Nick! Let's take a look around, OK?\nPhoenix:\nDo you think it'd be OK...?\nMaya:\nOf course! No one will ever know...\n???:\n...Coffee...?\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaah!\n???:\nI'll leave it here for you to enjoy... Quietly.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes! Thank you!\n???:\nDo not touch the desk... Please...\nMaya:\nN-N-Nick! Let's g-get out of here!\nPhoenix:\n(NOW she wants to get out of here...)\nExamine\nDesk on rug\nPhoenix:\nThat's one impressive desk on one impressive rug!\nMaya:\nIt's solid gold, Nick! Gold! Just look at that shine! Only real gold shines like that.\nPhoenix:\nWould you really want such a shiny desk, though?\nMaya:\nI don't know, but let's see what it's like to sit at a solid gold desk... Wow! I'm completely dazzled!\nPhoenix:\nThat's because it's completely dazzling!\nMaya:\nI can see up my nose in the reflection! That's gotta be really distracting!\nPhoenix:\n(So the desk isn't practical. No surprise there.)\nPunching bag\nMaya:\nWhat's this?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a punching bag.\nMaya:\nWhat!? No way. You wouldn't catch me walking around with a bag like that!\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean, \"walking around\"?\nMaya:\nThe design's gross to start with, and it's way too heavy to be practical. And why's it called a \"punching\"-bag? Don't people know messenger bags are in! I knew it. I was right before, back at Tr\u00e9s Bien. Paris fashion is more my thing.\nPhoenix:\n(I really, really hope she's pulling my chain on this one.)\nCD player\nPhoenix:\nThere's a CD player on the desk. But the desk is so loud, it's a wonder you can hear it.\nMaya:\nThe lid's open. I wonder what kind of music The Tiger's into.\n???:\nHave you finished... ...the coffee?\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, thanks. It was... lovely.\n???:\n... So... You drank it... all? Hee... Hee... Hee...\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n... *gulp*\n???:\n...If you touch anything else that doesn't belong to you... There's always another cup...\nPhoenix:\n(Th-That coffee! I-It was laced with something! I'm almost sure of it!)\nMaya:\nNick! My stomach... It's killing me! ... Oh, wait. Maybe it was just the burger I ate for breakfast...\nPhoenix:\nI-I sure hope so... (We better take a look at that CD while we're still alive and have the chance...) What the...!?\nMaya:\nWhat!? It's not the Rocko soundtrack, is it? Claw of the Tiger?\nPhoenix:\nIt's... It's a demo CD... The artist's name has been hand-written on the disc in pen. \"MC Bomber\"...\nMaya:\nWHAT!?\nPhoenix:\n(This must be the CD Maggey told us about!)\nMaya:\nLet's listen to it! I bet it's heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\nNo way! That woman'll make us drink more coffee if we do!\nMC Bomber added to the Court Record.\nCD player (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThere's a CD player on the desk.

I figured I'd read a book or two and be more cultured, in case you're wondering.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you aren't making stuff up for a change?\nMaya:\nHeh. I bet you also didn't know that no matter what, he'll always right himself. Go on, Nick! Give him a good shove!\nPhoenix:\nOnly if I feel like dying!\nMaya:\nNow, this yellow thing... This is a Japanese chess piece. I think it's a \"king\"? Not that I'm an expert or anything...

They're not... \"trophies\", are they...? *gulp*)\nMaya:\nHey... There's a piece of paper sticking out from under here.\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it? ...A repair bill? (Looks like he did some repair work on his car... Does he even have one...?) $15,000 to replace a bumper and a light!? That's insane!\nMaya:\nThe car's registered to... the \"Cadaverinis\"?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? So it's not even The Tiger's car?

That's going to be a nightmare to clean up.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It's all over the rug and everything.\nMaya:\nI accidentally knocked over a really big space heater once. Cleaning up was such a pain. It was one of those super antiques where you have to burn a ton of charcoal.\nPhoenix:\n(How did she manage to knock one of those over? Aren't they supposed to be super heavy?)\nMaya:\nOh, hey! There's a book of matches here, too!\nPhoenix:\nMatches, huh? Places don't give those out much nowadays. ...Hey, wait a second!\nMaya:\nWhat is it?\nPhoenix:\nLook what's printed on its cover!

The same color as my suit...?\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nKeep your voice down, Maya!\nMaya:\nN-Nick! You've got to take a look at this!\n???:\nSome cake...?\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaah!\n???:\nI'll just leave it here for you...\nMaya:\nUh... yeah... sure... I, umm... Thanks...\n???:\nJust wait here quietly...

Understand...?\nMaya:\nAah! I'm scared, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n...So? What were you getting so excited about before?\nMaya:\nLook, on the lapel of this suit...\nPhoenix:\nThat's...! That's an attorney's badge!\nMaya:\nIs The Tiger a lawyer!?\nPhoenix:\nNo way! Look at this thing! It's made of paper! (Changed from [No way! Look at this badge!

I'm scared, Nick!\nAfter examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes:\n???:\nGwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\n(Come out from under the desk, Maya!)\nThe Tiger:\nWhad are youse two snoopin' around in my office for!?\nPhoenix:\nN-Nothing. W-We were just...\nThe Tiger:\nGwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! My precious carpet! Youse got ash on my rug! You' gonna wish your ugly feet never came through my door!\nPhoenix:\nI-It wasn't us! It was already like th--\nThe Tiger:\nYouse wanna argue with me!? Is that what you' doin'? You dink youse can take me on!? I'm gonna flatten youse two into pancakes and turn youse into my new rugs!\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaah!\n???:\n...Oh... Don Tigre... You're back...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack... That voice... It's like evil seeping into your head through your ears...)\n???:\n...I'm sorry... Don Tigre... I knocked over that ashtray before... and...\nPhoenix:\n(Eek! Has she got a death wish or what!?)\nThe Tiger:\n... Oh, right.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nThe Tiger:\nF-Forget about it, Violetta. I-It's noddin'...\nPhoenix:\n(What, what, what!?)\nThe Tiger:\nI ain't gonna get mad at you. You' too cute, you hear!\nPhoenix:\n(That's so unfair!)\n???:\nHere... Have some cookies... I just baked them... And you'll need some strong espresso... while you're discussing your loan...\nThe Tiger:\nGwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes!?\nThe Tiger:\nYouse either crazy or just plain stupid to chase after me! I worked so hard, but now youse gotta come and mess up my plan...\nPhoenix:\n(So it was him... He's my phony...)\nThe Tiger:\nHeh, but I don't care. No one gets in my way!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What? I mean, e-excuse me?\nThe Tiger:\nHeh heh heh! Youse shoulda left de little girl at home, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm... I have a few things I want to ask--\nThe Tiger:\nGwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaah!\nThe Tiger:\nNo questions! Dis is de last time we meet!\nPhoenix:\nAck! Wait! P-Please!\nMaya:\n...That was pretty weak, Nick. You waited until he was out of earshot before you shouted after him.\nPhoenix:\n(Like you're one to talk! I didn't hear you scream, \"Hold it!\" either!)\n???:\n...The espresso...\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaah!\n???:\n...And cookies...\nPhoenix:\n(This woman is definitely not good for my heart. Now, what was it The Tiger called her...? \"Violetta\"?)\nTalk\nTender Lender\nPhoenix:\nSo... I'm kind of curious about your company, Tender Lender...\nVioletta:\n...With the warm and friendly atmosphere you'd expect from a family-sized business... ...a conscientious rate of interest... and an attractive repayment policy...\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the feeling this sentence is not going to end well...?)\nVioletta:\n...we will tenderly lend you that little bit extra, here at Tender Lender.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. Things are a bit tight for Wright and Co. at the moment, aren't they? I mean there's that 500 dollars you owe me from our card game for starters. Why don't you take out a loan?\nPhoenix:\n(Would I like to take out a loan from a place like this? Not so much...)\nVioletta:\nTender Lender is... on your side... Hee... Hee... Hee...\nPhoenix:\nSo, um, let's say I'm late with my repayment... What happens then?\nVioletta:\n...We'd give you more coffee... ...Strong coffee...\nPhoenix:\nUm, right... I think I'd rather skip down!\nMaya:\nHey! Just remember I can make strong coffee too, Nick! Strong tea, as well!\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo, um, do you know about the incident we're investigating?\nVioletta:\nWhat incident...?\nMaya:\nWell, a man was poisoned in a restaurant just near here. That incident.\nVioletta:\nLet me see... I was here that day, with the manager...\nPhoenix:\nThe manager being The Tiger...?\nVioletta:\n...Furio Tigre...\nMaya:\nF-Furio...\nPhoenix:\n...T-Tigre? (So that's where the \"Tiger\" thing comes from...)\nMaya:\nXin Eohp's got a real name! Nick! Hurry up and find out more about him!\nSaved your life? (appears after presenting Furio Tigre profile)\nVioletta:\nI'm very... frail, you see... Just recently, I... died... Once... Hee... Hee...\nMaya:\nYou d-died!?\nVioletta:\nAbout 4 months ago... The doctors said to... abandon all hope...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess they were expecting her to take a boat ride across the River Styx.)\nVioletta:\nBut Don Tigre... He saved me. He gave up everything...\nMaya:\nEverything!?\nVioletta:\nWhen I found out what he had done for me, I... was happy...\nMaya:\nNo offense, but I'm finding that a little hard to believe.\nVioletta:\nI decided I'd pay him back... with my life... by serving him coffee... and espresso...\nPhoenix:\n(I still wonder about what's in her coffee...) So... is that why you've got that bandage around your head?\nVioletta:\nHee... Hee... Hee... This?\nThe head bandage (appears after \"Saved your life?\")\nPhoenix:\nUm, so what's the story with the bandage?\nVioletta:\n... They put it on after the operation...\nMaya:\nOperation?\nVioletta:\nIt's just a little injury... A little, fatal, injury... Hee... Hee... Hee...\nMaya:\nA f-f-fatal injury!?\nPhoenix:\n(Maya just suffered one herself, by the sound of it...) So, that's the injury you were talking about before when you said you had died once?\nVioletta:\n...\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n...!\nMaya:\nUrgh! She really creeps me out, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Same here. But we've got to find out the truth!)\nThe head bandage (subsequent times)\nVioletta:\nIt was very complicated... The operation... They opened up my head... And performed surgery on my frontal lobe...\nMaya:\nUrgh! Just thinking about it sends shivers down my spine!\nPhoenix:\nSo how did you get this \"fatal injury\" that left you needing an operation?\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nVioletta:\nI made a promise to Don Tigre... I said I would never tell... Cross my heart and hope to drink 100 cups of espresso...\nPhoenix:\nOh. (That much caffeine would raise anyone from the dead!)\nVioletta:\nBesides... It's a very precious memory to me...\nPhoenix:\nA... A precious memory...? (I'll never find out what she means if I can't break her...)\nPresent\nFurio Tigre profile\nPhoenix:\nCan I ask you about The Tiger, I mean, Mr. Tigre?\nVioletta:\n...Cookie...?\nMaya:\nS-Sure...?\nVioletta:\nHow do you like my cookies? I baked them myself... Hee... Hee... Hee...\nMaya:\nGo ahead, Nick! The honor is all yours!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! Ladies first, Maya!\nVioletta:\nHee... Hee... Hee...\nPhoenix:\n(No matter how I look at this, I just don't get it... What are The Tiger and this scary girl doing working together?)\nVioletta:\nWe... are lovers...\nPhoenix:\n(That's not exactly coming across in your tone of voice...)\nVioletta:\nAnd I owe Don Tigre my life... He's the one who saved me...\nPhoenix:\nThe Tiger... saved you...!?\nVioletta:\nPlease, address him properly as \"Don Tigre\". Otherwise, I'll have to...\nPhoenix:\nOK, OK! Don Tigre! Of course! I'm sorry. (He saved her life? I'd sure like to how that happened.)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nUm, about this...\nVioletta:\nMore coffee...? You must have more...\nPhoenix:\nNo! Um, thanks! I've had enough. Really! (I'm so thirsty!)\nVioletta:\nI don't leave the office... I can't tell you about anything... except Don Tigre.\nJanuary 7Vitamin Square\nMaya:\nThere he is! Old Seedy's back feeding the pigeons again!\nKudo:\nThere! Take this! And this! And get out of my park!\nPhoenix:\nLike I thought, he's really mad... Come on, Maya. Just keep your head down and let's sneak away while we still can...\nMaya:\nWhat? Why? Hellooo, old man!\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you doing, Maya!?\nKudo:\nHuh!? ...Kah!\nMaya:\nHey, he just turned his back on us!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not surprised. I bet I really hurt his pride in court this morning.\nMaya:\nHey, Mr. Kudo!\nKudo:\nHmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Hmm, pi-pi-pigeon, hmm... Kah!\nMaya:\nLook, we really need to talk to you, alright?\nKudo:\nOut with the demons! In with good fortune!\nMaya:\nOw! Ow! Ow! Seeds... Shell splinters... Painful...\nPhoenix:\nI always knew you were a demon, Maya!\nTalk\nToday's trial\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm sorry about what happened in court earlier today.\nKudo:\nKah! Everyone'll be talking about me behind my back now! A dirty old man who was so busy looking at the serving girl's backside... ...that he can't remember her face! A filthy, depraved animal!\nPhoenix:\nN-Not at all!\nKudo:\nAre you listening to me, boy!? I don't care what you say, I saw that waitress put it in! She put some white powder into the young lad's javaccino!\nMaya:\nWe hear you...\nKudo:\nAnd another thing! The young layabout was wearing an earpiece! On the same side as the lens of his broken spectacles!\nMaya:\nW-We're really sorry...\nKudo:\nSo I made a little mistake about the vase. So what!? I know what I saw! I tell you, I tell you, I tell you!\nPhoenix:\nOK, OK! Take it easy, please, Mr. Kudo.\nKudo:\nDon't tell me to take it easy, you spikey-haired brat! Take this!\nEmbroiderer\nMaya:\nUm... You said you were a craftsman, right?\nKudo:\nKah! The modern world casts honest craftsmen like me aside in droves!\nMaya:\nS-Surely it's not that...\nKudo:\nI come from a long line of craftsmen. Right back to the time of the shoguns! Do you hear me!? I didn't become an embroiderer, I was BORN one!\nMaya:\nActually... I'm kind of in the same situation myself.\nKudo:\nI... I... I wanted to stick my fingers up that dribbling old judge's nose... ...and scream right down his earhole... \"Objection!\"\nMaya:\nOh... So, did you want to become a lawyer when you were young...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't think that's quite it, Maya. I think he's just in a bad mood, that's all...\nKudo:\nI've got a tsunami of frustration inside and it's ready to burst out!\nPhoenix:\n(If we let him start rambling now, we might never shut him up! What should I do?)\nCut in\nPhoenix:\nUm, actually, we've got places to go, things to check and stuff... Maybe another time?\nKudo:\nFine! Whatever! Just don't forget! I've got a tsunami's worth of grumbling to do.\nPhoenix:\nYes, yes. This girl right here is really looking forward to hearing it all. Honest!\nMaya:\nWhat!? I never said that!\nKudo:\nCome to the place where I work, then. Here. Bring this along with you.\nPhoenix:\n(What is this? It's covered in seeds... A discount coupon for a burger!?)\nMaya:\nHe really wants someone to grumble at, huh? ...Although, it IS a burger joint...\nLeads back to Talk options\nSuck it up\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I better let him talk...) So, there's not much call for craftsmen these days, then?\nKudo:\nOf course not, you idiot! All I'm good for nowadays is running errands!\nMaya:\nErrands?\nKudo:\nEveryone takes advantage of the elderly! \"Buy some bread, gramps!\" \"Take the dog for a walk, granddad!\" \"Feed the pigeons, old man!\" What am I? Some sort of two-bit community handyman!?\nMaya:\nUm, well...\nKudo:\n\"Buy some bread\", now that I can understand. But what's the point of feeding some seedy pigeons!? Why don't people say what they mean!? \"Get lost!\" That's what they're trying to say! Oh, yes! I'm just an inconvenience, you see! At home... At that restaurant... I just get in the way, don't I!?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sure you don't. (Wait a minute! What did he just say? At home and... at that restaurant?) Hold up... By \"restaurant\", are you talking about Tr\u00e9s Bien? Did you get asked to run an errand there, too?\nKudo:\nYes, I did! The very day that young brat was poisoned.\nPhoenix:\nWH-WHAT!?\nLeads back to Talk options\nThe \"errand\" (appears after selecting \"Suck it up\" upon selecting \"Embroiderer\" Talk option)\nPhoenix:\nSo on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do?\nKudo:\nGlad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me.\nArmstrong:\n\"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\"\nKudo:\n\"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time.\nMaya:\nSo, did you end up calling the police?\nKudo:\nLike I said, I was in a bit of a daze.\nPhoenix:\nDid you call them on your cell phone?\nKudo:\nKah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course!\nMaya:\nYou went looking for one...?\nKudo:\nI couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so.\nMaya:\nF-Five minutes...?\nPhoenix:\nSo for five minutes after the incident happened...\nKudo:\nYessiree, the owner was at Tr\u00e9s Bien on his own.\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you mention this in court this morning?\nKudo:\nWell, I would have if you'd given me the chance! But you all bullied me out of the courtroom!\nJudge:\n*sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today.\nKudo:\nWAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else...\nJudge:\nBailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom!\nKudo:\nIt's not my fault! You're the ones to blame!\nPhoenix:\nYou could have at least told us before we got to court.\nMaya:\nIs it really that important that Mr. Kudo was the one who called the police...?\nPhoenix:\n(What's important is the unaccounted time before the police arrived. The victim was dead, and Maggey was unconscious. Which leaves that woman... I mean, that man, alone in the restaurant!) Mr. Kudo might have been chased out of the place on purpose.\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe a certain someone didn't want him in the restaurant.\nMaya:\nAh!\nKudo:\nOh, sure! You go ahead and say I was in the way as usual! I suppose I should've been getting myself covered in pigeon poop instead, hmm?\nPhoenix:\n(We need to get more details about what exactly happened... ...from Maggey... and from Mr. Armstrong!)\nThe \"errand\" (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo on the day of the incident, what were you asked to do?\nKudo:\nGlad you asked, boy! Because I'll tell you what I was asked to do! All of a sudden that young lad slumped over the table... The serving girl collapsed... And I broke that vase. It all happened so fast, I was in a bit of a daze, you see. Then the owner shouted over to me.\nArmstrong:\n\"Excusez-moi! You! Call la police!\"\nKudo:\n\"Call them yourself!\" I should have said back. But I didn't think of it at the time.\nMaya:\nSo, did you end up calling the police?\nKudo:\nLike I said, I was in a bit of a daze.\nPhoenix:\nDid you call them on your cell phone?\nKudo:\nKah! Do I look like I'd have one of those new-fangled thingamajigs? I went out looking for a pay phone, of course!\nMaya:\nYou went looking for one...?\nKudo:\nI couldn't find one right away, you know. Wandered around for 5 minutes or so.\nMaya:\nF-Five minutes...?\nPhoenix:\nSo for five minutes after the incident happened...\nKudo:\nYessiree, the owner was at Tr\u00e9s Bien on his own.\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUm, would you mind taking a look at this?\nKudo:\n... Kah!\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me...\nKudo:\nYou let me get a million of my grumbles off my chest, and I'll take one quick look. I've got an earthquake of frustration inside and it's ready to rumble!\nPhoenix:\n...On second thought, forget it. A million grumbles for one quick look doesn't sound like a good deal... for me.\nAfter clearing \"The \"errand\"\" Talk option in Vitamin Square:\nJanuary 7Tr\u00e9s BienKitchen\nMaya:\nLooks like Mr. Armstrong's out again.\nPhoenix:\nBut the place is open for business... You can't have an open restaurant without a chef!\nMaya:\nHey! It's not my fault, Nick! Don't take it out on me!\nPhoenix:\n(Only a couple of minutes after the incident happened... Mr. Kudo left the scene, leaving Mr. Armstrong here alone.)\nMaya:\nArgh... Missing when we need to talk to him the most.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe he's trying to avoid us on purpose?)\nAfter breaking Psyche-Lock, clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Tr\u00e9s Bien:\nJanuary 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nByrde:\nOh, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nHello, Maggey. So they finished questioning you?\nByrde:\nWasn't it just unbelievable in court today, sir!? I'm going to stay up all night and blog about everything that happened!\nMaya:\nWeren't you scared? It was pretty touch and go in there.\nByrde:\nYeah, but you totally nailed that old man!\nPhoenix:\nWell, he was all over the place with his testimony.\nByrde:\nHe's not the only one!\nMaya:\nHuh? What do you mean?\nByrde:\nEveryone else's testimonies don't match up either. Not with what I remember of the incident, anyway...\nPhoenix:\n(Is it possible she is the one misremembering things...?)\nTalk\nContradictions\nMaya:\nMaggey... You know how you said that everyone else... ...provided testimony that didn't match up with what you remembered?\nByrde:\nYup. There are just so many things that don't seem to add up. The biggest contradiction is the other guy I saw at the victim's table. HE was the one who slipped something into the victim's coffee. I'm sure it was him!\nPhoenix:\n(But didn't Mr. Kudo testify earlier today... ...that it was the waitress who put some white powder into the coffee cup...?)\nMaya:\nSo you really think it was this \"disappearing man\" that did it...?\nByrde:\nWell, he's not the only thing that disappeared. The CD vanished as well. You know, the CD with the writing on it.\nMaya:\nOh, yeah. The \"MC Screwdriver\" album, right?\nPhoenix:\nIt was \"MC Bomber\", Maya. That name was scrawled on the sports paper as well.\nByrde:\nThey never did find that CD at the crime scene, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Or the victim's medication. That's gone missing, too.)\nMaya:\nOuch, my head... This is getting way too complicated for me!\nAfter the incident\nPhoenix:\nYou said that you passed out when the victim, Glen Elg, collapsed, right?\nByrde:\nYes. It's so embarrassing. I mean, I used to be a cop! When I came to, the restaurant was buzzing with police. And before I knew what was going on, they arrested me, sir.\nPhoenix:\nSo between the time the victim collapsed and the time the police arrived on the scene... ...you have no idea what went on at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nByrde:\nNo. No idea at all. Why? Is it important, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThe other witness, the old man from the park, was pretty much chased out of the picture.\nByrde:\n\"Chased out of the picture\"? What do you mean?\nMaya:\nOld Seedy wasn't inside the restaurant because he was told to go call the police.\nPhoenix:\nExactly. And you, Maggey, were unconscious. That means Mr. Armstrong was alone in the restaurant for a brief period of time.\nByrde:\nNo... Y-You don't think Mr. Armstrong... set me up... do you?\nPhoenix:\nWhen you consider the facts... ...it's hard to imagine that Mr. Armstrong isn't involved in this at all.\nByrde:\nGrr! It's like the master biting the paw of the dog that it feeds! Are you sure about this, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nWell, the old man said as much when we spoke with him earlier.\nByrde:\nI don't know. The things that man says don't add up for some reason, sir...\nPhoenix:\n(Maggey looks like she's trying to figure something out...)\nMaya:\nWe'd better find outexactly what happened to the old man on that day.\nVictor's testimony (appears after presenting Victor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile)\nPhoenix:\nIs there anything about Mr. Kudo's testimony that stood out as odd to you?\nByrde:\nActually... Yes. The fact that he was even testifying to begin with doesn't quite...\nMaya:\n...? \"Doesn't quite\" what?\nByrde:\nWell, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, we know that already. It was Victor Kudo.)\nByrde:\nBut I can't really say it was an old man.\nMaya:\nOK, then how about calling him a really old middle-aged man!\nByrde:\nNo, age isn't the issue. The other customer was a woman.\nPhoenix:\nA woman!?\nMaya:\nAre you sure, Maggey!?\nByrde:\nWell, I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think so.\nMaya:\nSo? What did this woman look like?\nByrde:\nUmm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh.\nPhoenix:\n\"Creepy\"?\nMaya:\n\"Cackling\"?\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the feeling I've come across a woman like that recently?)\nPresent\nSports Paper\nByrde:\nThat's the paper the victim had with him, isn't it?\nMaya:\nThat's what we think, madam.\nByrde:\nI kind of remember him having a paper, actually. And I remember something about this \"MC Bomber\", too.\nMaya:\nIt was written on the CD that disappeared as well, wasn't it?\nByrde:\nI don't suppose it makes any difference if there was one CD or two, right?\nMagazine Clipping\nByrde:\nJust thinking about the trial that day gives me the creeps.\nMaya:\nWas it that bad?\nPhoenix:\nD-Don't forget that was my phony, not me!\nByrde:\nHe was supposed to say, \"Surely the defendant isn't the real criminal!\" But instead he shouted out, \"Surely the defendant is the real criminal!\" ...By mistake.\nMaya:\nOh, ouch.\nPhoenix:\nL-Like I said, that was my phony, not me!\nByrde:\nI...! I don't want to think about it anymore...\nPhoenix:\n(Trust me, neither do I...)\nVictor's Testimony or Victor Kudo profile\nByrde:\nAh, I feel much better after the trial this morning. I've been a bit of a courtroom proceedings addict for years now. It feels like forever since I was a witness as slippery as that old man.\nMaya:\nHe's not really that bad of an old man though.\nByrde:\nStill, I feel a bit uneasy.\nMaya:\nHuh? I thought you just said you felt much better...\nPhoenix:\nMaggey. If there's something on your mind, you've got to tell us. Especially if it has anything to do with Mr. Kudo or his testimony.\nByrde:\nRoger! I'll spill it all and see what you make of it!\nCoffee Cup\nByrde:\nThat's the cup I took over to the table, sir. But! I didn't put anything in it... I just... I could never do something like that!\nMaya:\nThat's right! You could never do anything like that!\nByrde:\nI'm not good at carrying those large trays, you know. Trying to balance a tray with one hand to put something in the coffee with the other... That'd just be asking for trouble. I'd drop something, for sure!\nMaya:\nTh-That's right!\nPhoenix:\n(...I-Is she expecting me to claim that she's too clumsy to have committed the crime...?)\nApron\nByrde:\nOh, yeah. That's from when I was carrying a customer's breakfast over to them.\nPhoenix:\nThe ketchup splotch, you mean?\nByrde:\nMy whole face was fire-engine red, thanks to that stuff.\nMaya:\nBut you spilled the ketchup in your apron, didn't you? I don't see how...\nByrde:\nThe ketchup-covered omelet went flying and hit the customer in the face.\nMaya:\nOh, talk about a tomato-red face! Makes me wish I could've seen it myself.\nByrde:\nYeah, I guess... It was kind of a sight to behold.\nPotassium Cyanide\nByrde:\nPotassium cyanide? I've never heard of that poison before in my life, sir!\nPhoenix:\n...\nByrde:\nOK, maybe I have. But I've never seen it before. That's the truth. I wouldn't even know where the nearest potassium cyanide dealer is in the first place.\nMaya:\nPotassium cyanide dealers? Sounds like another group of drug pushers to avoid...\nPhoenix:\nIn any case, this definitely isn't something you can pick up just anywhere.\nByrde:\nOoh!! Curse my rotten luck! The criminal must've stuck the bottle in my apron while I was unconscious!\nGumshoe's Lunchbox\nPhoenix:\nOh, yeah! I've got something you're going to love!\nByrde:\nReally? What is it!?\nPhoenix:\nA lunchbox, just for you. Here!\nByrde:\nWow! A lunchbox! Weenies, too! I can't believe it! Thank you, sir! Did you make this just for me, Mr. Wright?\nMaya:\nNah, it was Detective Gumshoe! Who else would make such a nice lunchbox for you?\nByrde:\nDetective Gumshoe?\nMaya:\nHe's really worried about you. Looks like he put a lot of effort into making this, too!\nByrde:\n... I can't accept it. Detention Center rules. No gifts allowed, sir.\nPhoenix:\nHey, come on, Maggey. Don't be like that.\nByrde:\nThe rules are the rules! They'll lock you up if you break them.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, when an ex-cop turned waitress says that, it seems a whole lot scarier.)\nByrde:\nAnd anyway... I hate weenies!\nMaya:\nO-Oh... really?\nByrde:\nIt's all yours, Maya! You can enjoy it with Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nB-But...\nPhoenix:\n... She's right... It's better than letting it go to waste.\nMaya:\nBut! ...I guess so.\nGumshoe's Lunchbox eaten with Maya.\nByrde:\n... Well? How was it?\nPhoenix:\nThat hit the spot! I love weenies.\nByrde:\nOh, good! I'm glad I gave it to you, then, sir!\nPaper Badge\nByrde:\nAh! Is that... your attorney's badge?\nPhoenix:\nActually, it's a fake.\nByrde:\nHoooly smokes! That's it!!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nThat's the badge your phony had, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nYou got duped by this...!?\nMaya:\nBut it's a completely different color!\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about the fact that it's made of paper!?\nByrde:\nHe said the badge got a tan as well, while he was in Hawaii on business.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm beginning to see how my phony was able to gain her trust...)\nGlen Elg profile\nByrde:\nAh! That's the victim, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nThat day was the first time you'd ever seen this man, right?\nByrde:\nYes. I'd never met or seen him before then. I just happened to be the waitress who served him his coffee, sir. That's all!\nPhoenix:\nIt seems he was a computer programmer.\nByrde:\nReally? I'm useless with computers. Completely hopeless. I don't know any computer programs.\nPhoenix:\n(Did she mean \"programmers\"?)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nByrde:\nBack when I was an officer, Detective Gumshoe always looked out for me. But today! Today I was the one who had to look out for him; trying to incriminate me the whole time!\nPhoenix:\nYou've got to remember, Maggey. Gumshoe's a detective. He's got a job to do.\nByrde:\nMy old boss... I thought at least he'd be on my side.\nMaya:\nHe is on your side! He'd do anything to help y--\nByrde:\nYou can't fool me! I saw him in court today! I felt like a poor little baby woodpecker being pecked on the head by its own mother!\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe's testimony was pretty solid... No wonder it hurt her so much.)\nByrde:\nI hate him, sir! I mean it! I don't ever want to see him again!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch. I think I just saw Gumshoe's chances go down in flames like the Hindenburg...)\nMaya:\nI don't think it's getting through to her that he really was trying to help...\nJean Armstrong profile\nByrde:\nMr. Armstrong was very good to me after I was fired from the force. I can't believe someone as nice as him could have anything to do with this...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, in the time between the victim being poisoned and the police being called... ...the only person who was on the scene and had a chance to do anything... ...was Mr. Armstrong. There was no one else there.)\nByrde:\nM-Mr. Armstrong wouldn't... He wouldn't set me up... would he!?\nFurio Tigre profile\nByrde:\nHoooly smokes! That's him!!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nThat's your phony, Mr. Wright! Just look at that ridiculous suntan!\nPhoenix:\nUm... For the record, I'm not sunburned like an over-dried tomato so I don't know...\nByrde:\nHe told me he'd been on a business trip to Hawaii and that's where he got the tan.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not hearing this...)\nAnything else\nByrde:\nI know I used to be in the police force. But I'm incarcerated, now. I don't pick up much information in here. All I can help you out with now is the menu at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nMaya:\nHey, come on, Maggey.

Why the heck isn't the press conference set up yet!? The Superintendent's here already!\nChief:\nYeah. And there's a problem with the Internet, too.\nDetective:\nI already told you to stop using your computer, Chief!\nChief:\nBut I'm watching videos online! I'm catching up on my Asian soap operas!\nDetective:\nIt's gonna have to wait, Chief. I'm throwing the switch!\nChief:\nNooo! Just when Sum Yung-Gai was about to confess to his son's hot-to-trot girlfriend!\nMaya:\nWow! This place is really buzzing.\nPhoenix:\nSomething must be going down. Something really big.\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? What are you doing here, pal?\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nYou can't be here right now. You'll be roped into the briefing if you stay.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nWe've got big problems here today.\nMaya:\nWhy? What's going on?\nGumshoe:\nIt's a virus! A virus!!\nPhoenix:\n(A virus?)\nGumshoe:\nThere's a virus ripping through the precinct's computer system.\nPhoenix:\n(But I really need to ask you some questions...)\nExamine\nDetective on left\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nDetective:\n\"Your batteries won't last forever. Remember that when you're having fun... in bed.\" We have a winner! A little joke to make people think about their smoke alarms.\nPhoenix:\n... He must be coming up with slogans for a fire safety campaign... ...I guess? ...Does he even know what he's trying to get across anymore?\nChief\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He looks lost, now that the power to his computer has been cut.\nChief:\nOh, well. I guess I'll just have to read the paper now.\nPhoenix:\n(Alternately, you could read some reports... Just a suggestion.)\nChief:\nWhat the heck is this!? This paper's more than a month old! And someone's written all over it! Who's the clown that put this on my desk? Well? Speak up!\nMaya:\nHe just wadded it up and chucked it in the trash!\nPhoenix:\nBut that's an important piece of evidence!\nTalk\nTender Lender\nGumshoe:\nOK, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up!\nMaya:\nY-Yes!\nGumshoe:\nNo matter how poor you get, never borrow money from a place like this, you hear?\nMaya:\nUm... OK...?\nGumshoe:\nIf you got money trouble, just go on a diet of instant noodles and hang in there!\nPhoenix:\nAh, we're not thinking about borrowing money, Detective! We want information.\nGumshoe:\nOh... Is that all? Well, let's see... Tender Lender is considered to be even fishier than the average illegal loan shark. And it seems it ran into trouble just recently. Those guys have been pretty heavy-handed, calling in all their debts.\nMaya:\nReally?\nGumshoe:\nDon't go poking your nose around in their business, pal. You'll really regret it if you upset that lady.\nPhoenix:\nAlright, I get the picture. (Hey, wait a minute! What did he just say!? \"That lady\"?)\nMaya:\nWho's this lady he's talking about, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(We better find out what the story is with this \"lady\"...)\nComputer viruses\nMaya:\nSo what exactly is a computer virus, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nI dunno.\nMaya:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nLook, I just go with the flow, alright, pal?\nPhoenix:\n(And here I thought detectives were supposed to be somewhat knowledgeable...)\nGumshoe:\nWhat's with that face, pal? You think you know what a virus is?\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? Do you?\nPhoenix:\nA computer virus? Sure. I mean, only in simple terms, of course.\nMaya:\nReally? Wow, you know everything. Professor Nick!\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I'm gonna call you Dr. Wright from now on!\nMaya:\nHey, that sounds pretty cool! Don't you agree, Dr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I get the feeling they're making fun of me?) OK, fine. I'm no expert, but I can at least explain the basics to the two of you.\nWhat's a virus? (appears after \"Computer viruses\")\nPhoenix:\nA virus is a program that gets inside a computer and causes damage.\nGumshoe:\nDamage? You mean it makes the machine go \"boom\" and explode?\nPhoenix:\nNo. The damage is, um... Well, it's all internal.\nMaya:\nSo the inside goes \"boom\", right?\nPhoenix:\nImagine all the case data you've got stored on your PCs here in the station... A virus could wipe out all that. That's the kind of damage I'm talking about.\nMaya:\nWhoa! That's scary.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. And what's even more scary is that viruses are infectious.\nMaya:\nInfectious?\nPhoenix:\nMost computers are connected together on a network, right? A virus can move on machine to another over the network. So the virus just keeps spreading faster and faster.\nGumshoe:\nHmph. Just like a real virus, huh.\nMaya:\nBut, Nick! Why would anyone want to make a program like that?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. It takes ages to type in all that data. Why would you wanna destroy it, pal?\nPhoenix:\nNo. People don't infect their own machines. They send the virus to someone else's.\nMaya:\nWhat!? That's horrible!\nGumshoe:\nOh, I get it... It's like you sneezing on Godot so he catches a cold.\nMaya:\nRight! Then he wouldn't be able to turn up in court because he'd be too sick. You really shouldn't do stuff like that, Nick. It's wrong.\nPhoenix:\nWho? What? Where? When and why did the conversation jump to talking about me!? Anyway, that's what a computer virus is. A bad program that causes damage.\nGumshoe:\nAnd all the different viruses have names, right? I kinda feel like I've heard the name of the virus we caught somewhere before.\nPhoenix:\n(The name of the virus, huh? I feel like I've heard of it before, too...)\nMC Bomber (appears after presenting Sports Paper or MC Bomber)\nGumshoe:\nWe already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back. A group of criminals issued a series of demands to the head honchos of law enforcement. They threatened to release the virus if their demands weren't met.\nMaya:\nWho are they?\nGumshoe:\nI dunno. Some hotshots from the criminal underworld would be my guess.\nPhoenix:\nAnd now the virus has been released, huh...\nGumshoe:\nYeah. It's in every computer in every public office in the city. Everyone's going nuts! They're hopping around like they're dancing at a carnival!\nMaya:\nAll this stuff with criminals and viruses... It almost feels like we're in a sci-fi movie!\nGumshoe:\nApparently the programmer who made the virus was a real genius or something. The focus right now is on tracing the route of this virus on the black market.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean someone put this virus up for sale?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. And because this one's so powerful... ...they're estimating its price tag was in the millions of dollars, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(In the millions!? A virus can be worth that much!?)\nMC Bomber updated in the Court Record.\nMC Bomber (subsequent times)\nGumshoe:\nWe already knew about the MC Bomber virus from a while back.

A scary bunch of people, that's who!\nPhoenix:\n(You're a cop, and you're scared? What's that about?)\nGumshoe:\nTrust me, it doesn't matter if you're kid or a cop, these guys are scary. They've got some serious clout in the criminal underworld. We can't touch them. They've got too much moola.\nPhoenix:\nMoola...? As in?\nGumshoe:\nThey pretty much control all the cash on the city's black market.\nPhoenix:\nThe black market, huh? And that includes Tender Lender, I take it?\nGumshoe:\nSure. No one stands up to Bruto Cadaverini. And I mean, no one!\nPhoenix:\n(Interesting...)\nMaya:\nSo Viola's the granddaughter of some mafia boss then?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. And everyone know how much Bruto loves his little girl. She means everything to him.\nPhoenix:\nSo... How did she end up at Tender Lender?\nGumshoe:\nI dunno, pal. But I heard she and the boss of the Tender Lender are pretty tight.\nMaya:\nTight?\nGumshoe:\nThat's what it said in a file I read related to Maggey's case.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like a pretty important clue.)\nPresent\nSports Paper or MC Bomber\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, umm... about this...\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? I'm trying to concentrate on Maggey and this virus right now, so I... Aaaaaaaaaaah!! This is it! This stupid name! I remember now!\nPhoenix:\n(I thought so. Here it comes...)\nMaya:\nDon't just nod to yourself and keep me in the dark, Nick! What's going on!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's OK, Maya! You don't have to cry about it!\nGumshoe:\nThe name scribbled on that sports paper and written on that CD... That's the name of the virus! \"MC Bomber\"!\nMaya:\nWHAT!?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! The virus that's just infected every computer in the station, pal. It's MC Bomber!\nPhoenix:\nCan you give us any more details? Please?\nGlen Elg profile\nGumshoe:\nThis guy was a real programming genius. They called him \"the walking computer\" at the place where he worked.\nMaya:\nWhat happens when he crashes though!? Does he just stop moving all of a sudden!?\nPhoenix:\n(*groan* He wasn't a computer, Maya!)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, there's nothing between Maggey and the victim.\nVioletta profile\nGumshoe:\nThat's the girl who works over at Tender Lender. You wanna stay away from her, OK? I mean it.\nMaya:\nShe does look kind of unforgiving, doesn't she?\nGumshoe:\nThat should be the least of your worries, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(What's that supposed to mean? What could be worse...?)\nGumshoe:\nHer name's Viola Cadaverini. She's the only granddaughter of Bruto Cadaverini.\nMaya:\nBruto Cadaverini? Do you know who that is, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nNever heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nBruto Cadaverini's the boss of the Cadaverini family.\nPhoenix:\nThe Cadaverinis? (That's one scary-sounding name!)\nGumshoe:\nWe can't touch them. They're way too powerful for the police. But you're thinking of taking them on, aren't you?\nPhoenix:\nN-No! I don't remember ever saying I was going to! (I better get some more info out of Gumshoe about this \"family\"...)\nFurio Tigre profile\nGumshoe:\nOh, this guy... The Tiger...\nMaya:\nIs he famous?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. This guy's not a loan shark, you know. Nope. He's a big loan cat!\nPhoenix:\nHence the name?\nGumshoe:\nDon't pay him back, and you'd better say your prayers, because he'll eat you alive.\nMaya:\nYou're shaking, Detective.\nPhoenix:\nLike a leaf...\nGumshoe:\nI'm just... you know... kinda on edge at the moment... If you know what I mean.\nBruto Cadaverini profile\nGumshoe:\nI wouldn't go flashing that photo around if I were you, pal.\nMaya:\nWhy not?\nGumshoe:\nThat guy rules the criminal underworld.

The weenies...?\nByrde:\nI hate weenies!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah... Those weenies.)\nGumshoe:\nSo? How did my weenies taste when they went down the hatch?\nMaya:\nHuh? Um... Well... It was... delicious!\nGumshoe:\nYeah? That's what she said? Really!?\nMaya:\nUmm... Well... Not exactly...\nGumshoe:\nDon't worry about it, pal. I figured something would happen, so I came prepared.\nPhoenix:\nPrepared? What do you mean...?\nGumshoe:\nI made a jumbo lunchbox!\nMaya:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nDo me a favor again, huh, pal, and deliver this?\nPhoenix:\n(This sure is a heavy burden... In more ways than one...)\nGumshoe:\nI can just imagine Maggey's little eyes sparkling with joy when you bring her that!\nMaya:\n...Weenies, again, Nick? Tell me we don't have to eat all these too...\nGumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya. Again.\nMaya:\nI really can't eat any more...\nPresent\nGumshoe's Lunchbox\nGumshoe:\nDon't forget to give that to Maggey, OK?\nMaya:\nBut they don't allow presents for the prisoners in the detention center, right...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're right... ... Well it doesn't matter.

But it had been infected with a \"gambling\" virus. Glen was... in too deep.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean he was in debt?\nBasil:\nYes. 100,000 dollars in debt. Not an easy amount to repay. So... He said he was taking on some extra work. Something a bit risky.\nPhoenix:\n\"Risky\"? How?\nMaya:\nMaybe he was going to become a waitress at Tr\u00e9s Bien!?\nPhoenix:\n(Where do you come up with these ideas!?)\nRisky extra work (appears after \"Glen's troubles\")\nPhoenix:\nSo it's safe to say Mr. Elg was the creator of this virus, huh?\nBasil:\nThe \"MC Bomber\" virus? Yes. It was a work of genius. In a bad sort of way, of course. But still genius. Something like that would probably fetch several million dollars on the black market.\nPhoenix:\n(Inconceivable! Gumshoe was right for a change!) This date, December 3rd, that is marked on his calendar...

Perhaps you'd like to speak to someone in customer service?\nPhoenix:\n(What's she talking about!? I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...) Ms. Basil. Let me ask you something. Did Mr. Elg's troubles have something to do with this?\nPresent Victim's Lottery Ticket\nPhoenix:\nBasil:\nWhat is that?\nPhoenix:\nA lottery ticket. There were a ton of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime. (Changed from [There were hundreds of these on the victim's table at the scene of the crime.] in the original release)\nBasil:\nAnd what is the relevance of that?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim, Mr. Glen Elg... ...had a gambling habit, didn't he?\nBasil:\nI don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone dreams of being rich. Even I listen to Millionaire Radio.\nPhoenix:\n(She's right. That is a bit weak on its own.) But Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to the lottery, was it?\nPresent Losing Horse Racing Tickets\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The lottery, horse racing... He bought a lot of tickets, and lost a lot of times.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nBasil:\nEveryone likes to gamble from time to time.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nBasil:\nBut be careful! If you're careless, you could lose everything -- your money, people's trust, etc.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I got that one wrong.)\nLeads back to:\n\"I don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts.\"\nPresent Losing Horse Racing Tickets\nPhoenix:\nBasil:\nWhat is that?\nPhoenix:\nA bunch of horse racing tickets. All losing ones.\nBasil:\nWith that many tickets, you could get 1 dollar at the recycling center. You good people are very, very bad. Cashing in on others' misfortunes is immoral.\nPhoenix:\n(...Is that a whiff of hypocrisy I smell?) (Changed from [...Why did I get a whiff of hypocrisy just now?] in the original release)\nBasil:\nBut what is the relevance of these tickets?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim, Mr. Glen Elg... He had a gambling habit, didn't he?\nBasil:\nI don't think that's a logical conclusion based on the facts. Everyone likes to go to the races from time to time.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, but not everyone buys this many tickets!)\nBasil:\nAnyway, I don't believe that proves anything on its own.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. But I'm not through yet. Mr. Elg's gambling wasn't restricted to horse races, was it?\nPresent Victim's Lottery Ticket\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The lottery, horse racing...

Did you good people follow all that?\nPhoenix:\nNot even slightly! What was all that mumbo-jumbo?\nBasil:\nIt is exactly as my programmer explained.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm guessing I picked the wrong piece of evidence there.)\nBasil:\nWould you like to input another question?\nLeads back to:\n\"I guess I'd better just take a shot and see where it gets me...\"\nPhoenix:\nThe lottery, horse racing...

Maybe bad enough to be the cause of some pretty serious trouble perhaps!?\nBasil:\nNoooooooo!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nBasil:\nYou are right. Glen did have a gambling habit. You good people must not follow his example, do you understand?\nPhoenix:\nTrust me. Even if I wanted to, I don't exactly have the money to buy any.\nBasil:\nBut... if you win, there's no problem, is there? And Glen had a winning ticket, didn't he? For half a million dollars?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but...\nBasil:\nIt's hard to imagine how he could have been in trouble then, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nIt's true that Mr. Elg won half a million dollars... in the end. But that was his first stroke of good luck. He was in deep trouble before that.\nBasil:\nDeep trouble? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Elg's real problem was with someone or something more terrifying and ferocious!\nPresent Glen's Calendar\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMr. Elg met with someone on the day he was killed. He even made a note on this calendar about the meeting: \"Meet with The Tiger.\"\nBasil:\nWhat is the relevance of that? Are you trying to suggest Glen was meeting him to discuss his debt?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah. That's what I was thinking.\nBasil:\nBut I have never heard anything about this \"Tiger\" before. Maybe he's not even human. Maybe he really is a tiger!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm no programmer, but does she really expect me to buy such messed up logic?)

Hee...\nPhoenix:\nDid the injury in question have something to do with this?\nPresent Repair Bill\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I have here a car repair bill.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWell!?\nViola:\nDonuts...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nViola:\nI baked them myself... Home-made donuts... Have one...\nPhoenix:\nUmm, what's inside?\nViola:\nJam, and... ...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, but I didn't quite catch that...\nViola:\nHee... Hee...\nPhoenix:\nUm... Thanks, but no thanks... I think I'll pass. (I guess that was a flop. What happened to this woman for her to have such a huge bandage around her head? There must be some piece of evidence that'll prompt her to tell me what happened...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now, by \"fatal injury\", you mean you were hurt very badly somehow, right?\"\nPhoenix:\nI have here a car repair bill. From this, it seems pretty obvious that this car was involved in an accident.\nViola:\nLet me see that... ... This bill is made out to the \"Cadaverinis\"...?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, it is.\nViola:\nI don't think... I ever introduced myself... Tell me... what do the \"Cadaverinis\"... have to do with me...?\nPhoenix:\n(Something tells me she's not about to say hi and introduce herself... Alright, then...) Your relationship with the Cadaverinis is very strong... And this is why.\nPresent Viola Cadaverini or Bruto Cadaverini profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I know exactly who you are, Viola Cadaverini!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo!? What do have to say for herself now!?\nViola:\nPretzels... For you...\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nViola:\nDon't worry about the little white specks on the surface... I just sprinkled a small quantity of... ...\nPhoenix:\n...N-No thanks! (My evidence must still be half-baked...)\nViola:\nI really don't know... the \"Cadaverinis\"... Further...\nLeads back to:\n\"I don't think... I ever introduced myself...\"\nPhoenix:\nI know exactly who you are, Viola Cadaverini! You sustained that injury in a traffic accident, didn't you?\nViola:\n...\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nViola:\nIt happened about 4 months ago... I was driving in one of our family's cars... when someone pulled out in front of me... It was a motorbike... or something like that... I don't remember it much... Anyway, I swerved to try to avoid it, but... ...I took a blow... to the head... A bad one.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I can imagine...) So what happened to the person on the bike? I'm guessing they didn't get away with injuring THE Viola Cadaverini, right?\nViola:\nI... don't know... what happened to them... They ran away... Or so I heard...\nPhoenix:\nRan away?\nViola:\nIf they'd stayed, I'd have... Hee... Hee... Hee...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, is it possible...? Could the person who committed the hit and run have been...?)\nPresent Furio Tigre profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"It was this man, wasn't it? He was the cause of your accident.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe person who caused the accident that gave you that injury was--\nViola:\nNo more.. I don't want to... think about it anymore... Here... try one of these tomatoes... We all picked them together... as a family... And I added my own, special, flavoring...\nPhoenix:\nN-No thanks! (The person who caused the accident was riding a motorbike... Who could it be?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Hmm, is it possible...? Could the person who committed the hit and run have been...?\"\nPhoenix:\nIt was this man, wasn't it? He was the cause of your accident.\nViola:\n... It wasn't Don Tigre! I refuse to believe it!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nViola:\nWe collided... The motorbike, and my car... But Don Tigre isn't injured at all... is he?\nPhoenix:\n(It was The Tiger who caused Viola to crash. I can feel it! Plus, one of her locks just broke, so she must suspect it was him, too...) I'm sorry, Ms. Cadaverini... But I have proof that The Tiger was involved in a traffic accident on his bike!\nPresent Scooter\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"It's not exactly a motorbike, but...\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAnd this is my proof!\nViola:\nHard-boiled eggs...? Please, try one...\nPhoenix:\nE-Eggs?\nViola:\nI raised the chickens and these eggs came from myself... I invented a special diet... so their chicks would be blue...\nPhoenix:\nN-No, thanks!\nLeads back to:\n\"It was The Tiger who caused Viola to crash. I can feel it!\"\nPhoenix:\nIt's not exactly a motorbike, but... ...Mr. Tigre rides around in a scooter, doesn't he? And you'll notice that the front wheel guard is badly damaged.\nViola:\n...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Cadaverini... You know the truth, don't you?\nViola:\n... Hee... Hee... Hee...\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nPhoenix:\nThis repair bill was paid by Furio Tigre. The Cadaverinis have known for ages who caused the accident, haven't they?\nViola:\n... It's possible... Perhaps... Somewhere inside me... I know that may be true...\nPhoenix:\n(I knew it...)\nViola:\nBut... Don Tigre still saved my life... The operation was very complicated... It was very, very expensive...\nPhoenix:\nHow much are we talking?\nViola:\n... Very, very, very expensive...\nPhoenix:\n(She seems kind of hesitant about giving me an actual figure. I should back off...) Well, anyway, it was The Tiger who paid for it, right?\nViola:\nAfter I recovered... Don Tigre told me... He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me... I... believe him...\nPhoenix:\nReally? But do you honestly believe that to be true?\nViola:\n...\nPhoenix:\nDo you want to know what I think...? I think the reason he paid the operation wasn't because of you, but someone else...\nPresent Bruto Cadaverini profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Perhaps I shouldn't be saying this, but...\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nI know this must be quite a shock for you, but...\nViola:\nOvercoat...?\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry?\nViola:\nI made it myself... It's been so... cold lately...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, just hearing your voice sends shivers down my spine!)\nViola:\nPlease, try it on... ... ...Oops!\nPhoenix:\n... What was the \"oops\" for?\nViola:\nI'm missing a few pins... I must have left them in the coat...\nPhoenix:\nO-On second thought, I'm fine, thanks! Roasty-toasty, that's me!\nViola:\nDon Tigre told me, you see...\nLeads back to:\n\"He said he paid for the operation because... he cared about me...\"\nPhoenix:\nPerhaps I shouldn't be saying this, but... ...your grandfather, Bruto Cadaverini, controls a lot of \"dubious\" cash, right? And you are his beloved pride and joy.\nViola:\n...\nPhoenix:\nSure, I don't know exactly how much the operation cost, but... ...if you weren't the granddaughter of Mr. Cadaverini... ...do you think Mr. Tigre would have paid the money?\nViola:\n... One million dollars...\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nBruto Cadaverini profile\nPhoenix:\nThis man is your grandfather, right?\nViola:\nCarrying a picture like that around with you... You should watch your back...\nPhoenix:\nTh-Thanks for the advice...\nViola:\nThe family is always watching me... from the shadows...\nPhoenix:\n(The \"family\"?)\nMaya:\nI thought I saw something suspicious under the corner of that rug!\nViola:\nOne wrong move and... you might disappear forever... Hee... Hee... Hee...\nPhoenix:\n(This feels like Halloween... Only a whole lot more real... And a whole lot scarier, too.)\nViola:\nI wanted to believe him... I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said... He said it had nothing to do with my grandfather being Bruto Cadaverini... I wanted to believe he helped me because he cared about me. Not about my grandfather... But I knew... That wasn't really true...\nMaya:\nWow. I'm so sorry.\nViola:\nWhat he did to get the money was... It was... evil!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nViola:\nHe said it was all for me... So I... I helped him...\nMaya:\nYou helped him? In what way?\nViola:\nHere... Take these...\nPhoenix:\n(What are these? Medical papers?)\nViola:\nI'm Bruto Cadaverini's granddaughter... He had to pay compensation... He was made an offer... He simply... couldn't... refuse.\nViola's Medical Papers added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\nWow, I feel so bad for Viola.\nPhoenix:\nIt's inexcusable!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\n(There are two things that I consider inexcusable. Poisoning, and betrayal! Only a coward would hurt people using either of these tactics.)\nMaya:\nIs everything alright, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWe should get going. Right after we finish our espresso.\nMaya:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\n(I wouldn't need to convince Viola of anything else, so I guess I can get rid of this.)\nRepair Bill thrown into the trash.\nAfter clearing \"Risky extra work\" Talk option in Blue Screens, Inc. and clearing \"Compensation\" Talk option in Tender Lender:\nJanuary 7Tr\u00e9s Bien\nArmstrong:\nEh, bonjour! I 'ave been waiting for you to return.\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong...\nPhoenix:\nAh, good timing. I was hoping to find you here. We'd like to ask you a few questions...\n???:\nWell, he hasn't got anythin' to say to youse fellas!\nMaya:\nAh! It's Xin Eohp...\nTigre:\nWho you callin' \"Zinnee Ooooope\"!?\nMaya:\nAaaaah!\nPhoenix:\n(Come out from under the table already, Maya!)\nTigre:\nOK. Hand it over!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What?\nTigre:\nYouse wanna play games wid me? I don't recommend dat! The medical papers! Now!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh, oh... I think he wants Viola Cadaverini's papers back...) Y-You mean... this? The million dollar medical papers?\nTigre:\n...\nPhoenix:\nMs. Cadaverini trusted you. That's why she said that she helped you.\nTigre:\nForget about it! That girl's dumber dan an eggplant. Youse wanna know what's sad? I'll tell youse what's sad. And it ain't only her face. She thinks she's got power cuz she's Bruto's little girl... Now THAT's sad...\nPhoenix:\nI can't let you have these papers. Tomorrow in court... ...I'm going to expose what you did to get the one million you used to pay this off!\nTigre:\n... Are you crazy or somethin'!? I don't care if you wanna give it to me or not! There's two of us here. You got dat? Two.\nArmstrong:\nErr... oui! Oui, oui!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Armstrong!?\nArmstrong:\nForgive me! D\u00e9sol\u00e9! I cannot argue wiz 'im!\nPhoenix:\nU-Urgh! (...That... really hurt!)\nTigre:\nIs dat all youse got? I'll be takin' dose papers now. Armstrong! Get that lighter!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait...!\nTigre:\nDon't take it too hard... ...Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(That was so stupid... I shouldn't... have let my guard down. Those medical papers were... vital... evi...dence...)\nHold it, pal!\nPhoenix:\nD-Detective Gumshoe!?\nTigre:\nD-Detective!? Youse think you gonna stop me, copper!? Beat it! Gwaaaaaaaaaaar!\nGumshoe:\nWhoa! C-Come on, Gumshoe! Keep it together! You guys! Get outta here! Leave this guy to me.\nPhoenix:\nB-But...\nGumshoe:\nGo, pal! And take this! If you get hurt, who'd look after Maggey, huh!?\nPhoenix:\n...! A-Alright! Thanks, Gumshoe!\nMaya:\nWait, Nick! Don't leave me behind!\nPhoenix:\n(I'll get even with that guy tomorrow... in court! Tender Lender is going down!)\nTo be continued.\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)\nToo many errors during Magatama session\n...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...\nPhoenix:\n(Nnrgh!

Yesterday's session didn't go so well, and then ended on a giant mystery.Phoenix:\n(That's true... And we still haven't solved a single part of it yet...)Maya:\nAre you OK, Nick?Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, uh... Yeah. Of course.Byrde:\nI saw that! That little flash of doubt in your eyes!Phoenix:\nN-No! That wasn't doubt. That was, umm... determination!Byrde:\nWhy don't I believe you...?Maya:\nIt's nearly time, Maggey. You'd better get going to the defendant's seat.Byrde:\nRoger. Don't let me down, Mr. Wright. I'm counting on you!Hey, pal!Phoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe...Gumshoe:\nQuit stressing Maggey out! She doesn't need that!Phoenix:\nH-How did you know she was stressed...?Gumshoe:\nI was watching through the doorway.Phoenix:\nOh...Gumshoe:\nYou look like you lost the case already. Show a bit of confidence, will you, pal!? Here, maybe this'll help.Maya:\nHuh!? Have you taken up aromatherapy, too?Gumshoe:\nNot in a million years, pal! Don't tell me that you don't remember this thing?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Come to think of it, that doesn't look like one of those aromatherapy bottles...)Gumshoe:\nThis is the small bottle that turned up in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen a couple of days ago.Maya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!Phoenix:\nOh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...Maya:\nHey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.Phoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.Maya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn't smell.Gumshoe:\nWe finally got the analysis results back from the lab.Maya:\nSo!? What is it? Is it the poison?Gumshoe:\nI'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.Maya:\nMedication?Gumshoe:\nYeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.Phoenix:\nFor ears? You mean...?Gumshoe:\nYeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!Phoenix:\n(What was Glen Elg's ear medicine doing in the kitchen...?)Small Bottle refiled into the Court Record.Phoenix:\nUm, what about the unidentified fingerprints? Anything on that?Gumshoe:\nSomeone screwed up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... That's going to weaken its impact as a piece of evidence...)Gumshoe:\nOK, pal! This is it! Make sure your defense is impregnable today, got it!?Phoenix:\n(Today's trial... I'm gonna expose that guy for what he's done, or my name isn't Phoenix Wright!)January 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\nReady and waiting as always, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery good. Then we'll get underway at once. Yesterday we heard the testimony of Mr. Victor Kudo. He claims to have witnessed the defendant putting a powder into the victim's coffee. However, the witness's testimony was plagued with a number of problems.Godot:\nThe mark on the rim of the cup shows that the victim drank from it with his right hand. But according to the old man's testimony, he picked it up with his left hand.Judge:\nThank you, Mr. Godot. Furthermore, according to the witness's account... ...the victim was listening to the radio with an earpiece in his left ear. Yet, the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, which made him effectively deaf in that ear.Maya:\nIt's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?Godot:\nHa...! Allow me to enlighten you, Your Honor. The world, you see, keeps turning, and we must turn with it.Judge:\n... You've lost me already, Mr. Godot.Godot:\nDon't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today. Only losers think like that. You've got to change with the times! That's one of my rules!Judge:\nAre you implying that you've resolved these contradictions? You know the answers to these riddles!?Godot:\nThe old guy wasn't just throwing seed in here. He was throwing us off the scent. And today I'll prove it.Judge:\nVery well. Let the first witness take the stand!Godot:\nAnd you are?Armstrong:\nOh bonjour, everyone! I am Jean Armstrong. z'e owner and 'ead chef of la Tr\u00e9s Bien restaurant. Enchant\u00e9!.........Judge:\nForgive me for asking, witness, but... are you a woman?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0, monsieur! As you can see, I am la pert and perky gentleman, non?Judge:\nEr... Umm...Godot:\nOn the day of the incident, you were in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen. Isn't that right?Armstrong:\nW'iz you monsieur...Godot:\n...?Armstrong:\n...everything feels right!Godot:\nHa...!Phoenix:\n(Wow, he's totally unfazed! Doesn't anything intimidate this guy...?)Judge:\nVery well. Your testimony please, witness. Please tell the court what happened that day at Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nOui! Volontiers!Witness Testimony-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Phoenix:\nA m...m...m... MIRROR!?Armstrong:\nOui! Un grand mirror! La most enormous mirror!Godot:\nAnd suddenly, the mystery disappears! Like I said, the world keeps turning, so roll with it!Judge:\nHmm... That would explain the coffee cup and the earpiece conundrum... The mirror would have made everything appear back to front.Phoenix:\n(What the heck!? It's way too early in the morning for this to be happening to me!)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd who were the two customers, exactly?\nArmstrong:\nMais, of course. La young man who died... ...and la other, not-so-young, man.\nJudge:\nHmm... You are referring to yesterday's witness, I presume?\nPhoenix:\n(What about the other man Maggey says she saw at the table? Something tells me Mr. Armstrong isn't planning to disclose his existence...)\nMaya:\nWe need some hard evidence first before we can bring him up, don't we...?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to try a different approach for the time being.Armstrong:\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were experimenting with art deco? How come I never heard about that before today?\nArmstrong:\nYou are not familiar w'iz z'e language of interior design, monsieur?\nPhoenix:\nPlease stay on topic! Now, why didn't you tell the court about this before!?\nArmstrong:\nBut I did. Just a few moments ago!\nJudge:\nAhem! Excuse me, Mr. Armstrong. This \"deco\" you mentioned... Are you referring to some sort of \"decocture\"?\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! Art deco, it is a style of design! ...Your Honor. He's talking about interior design. Walls, ceilings, carpets, that kind of thing.\nJudge:\nAh, yes. Of course. That \"deco\".\nArmstrong:\nI was trying to achieve a more \"la effeminate\" look for my restaurant. I was planning z'e most bold remodeling of la decor.Armstrong:\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow big of a mirror are we talking about here?\nArmstrong:\nBof! Something about 4 meters wide and, err... Oui. About 2 meters 'igh.\nPhoenix:\n(Let's see... If 1 meter is about 1 yard... Holy glass in a frame, that's huge!)\nArmstrong:\nI was intending to install it on la ceiling eventually.\nPhoenix:\nThe ceiling!? (Was there a mirror on the ceiling!? I don't remember...)\nArmstrong:\nMais, non. But I decided not to go through w'iz it in z'e end.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I ask him more about the mirror or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He couldn't lie about such a huge object like that. It must've been there in the restaurant somewhere.)\nGodot:\n...\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you really had such a large mirror in the restaurant, someone would have noticed it! But there's nothing about a mirror in Mr. Kudo or Maggey Byrde's testimonies!\nArmstrong:\nB-But...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou didn't ask, Trite. You have only yourself to blame for such sloppy work.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nA mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien the day before the incident.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?\nGodot:\nAs Mr. Armstrong testified, he was carrying out some design changes. And as it turned out, he didn't actually use the mirror in the end.\nPhoenix:\n(This just doesn't add up. Even if a mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien... ...it doesn't prove that it was in the restaurant on the day of the crime.)\nGodot:\nHa...! If you want to doubt someone, Trite, look in the mirror. I'm sure the person looking back at you will be dubious enough!\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\nJudge:\nHmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...Armstrong:\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNormally, I'd expect people to know the difference between a reflection and a real object.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\n\"Normally\"? How does normality come into this? That's lame, Trite. Even for you.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nAre you trying to say that if something isn't normal, it isn't possible? Is that it? Where does that leave the porcu-headed lawyer and the topknot chick over there... and the ungodly cool guy with the mask over here? Well, Trite!?\nPhoenix:\nAaack! Not the hair!\nMaya:\nI do not have a topknot!\nJudge:\nMr. Godot is correct. A lack of normality is no basis for discounting an argument.\nArmstrong:\nBien! Logic 'as won la day!Armstrong:\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nEverything? He would have seen everything in reverse?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... We should take a sec and think about what Old Seedy said in his testimony...\nPhoenix:\n(How did he phrase it again...?)\n\n\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\n\n\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!\n\n\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\n\n\nMaya:\nIf he saw everything he described reflected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the \"left\" was actually on the \"right\", huh.\nPhoenix:\n(And that clears up all the problems with his testimony, I guess... Or does it...?)\nGodot:\nHa...!Present Glen Elg profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD...\"Phoenix:\n(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?Phoenix:\nIf he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.Maya:\nBut that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!",

You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!Phoenix:\nSo, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's left side.

Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his right eye.Godot:Godot:\n...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.Phoenix:\nA-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?Godot:\nYou don't understand the way the witness thinks.Judge:\nHow he thinks?Godot:\nYou remember this, I presume?Phoenix:\nThe \"I broke the vase... sorry\" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?Godot:\nExactly. The old man has one very grievous habit... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more muddled his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?Judge:\nClearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.Godot:\nAnd that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. \"I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!\" Ha...! Well, Trite?Phoenix:\nUrk... (That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)Maya:\nWow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!Judge:\nEnough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.Maya:\nBad luck, Nick. Looks like the \"boil\" of a contradiction you found is just a \"rash\".Godot:\nA mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.Armstrong:\nOui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.Witness Testimony-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nAlors. Is everyone sitting comfortably?\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Judge:\nHmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.Armstrong:\nWhat a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!Godot:\nDon't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.Phoenix:\n(Argh! I hate that guy!)Judge:\nYou said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?Armstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, run this by me again. The mirror was here, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nPhoenix:\nOui? Really!? Because I know if I were you, I wouldn't have put a mirror there! It would be in the way!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nLook who's talking, Trite.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're obstructing my view, among other things.\nPhoenix:\nBut, but, but! This is my seat in the courtroom...!\nGodot:\nTr\u00e9s Bien's \"charm\" is that it gives you the impression that you're the only customer. Temporarily placing a mirror in that spot would hardly be \"in the way\". Unlike you... Trite.\nArmstrong:\nI tell you, monsieur. la mirror was z'ere, in z'e middle of la restaurant.Armstrong:\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd where would that be!?\nArmstrong:\nOh l\u00e1 l\u00e1! Look 'ow you lean towards me! I always attract z'e younger boys! Maybe I should keep you in suspense a little longer!\nJudge:\nMr. Armstrong! Tell the court what you know at once!\nArmstrong:\nI attract z'e older ones, too, you know, 'andsome! Shall I tease you, too!?\nJudge:\nNnngh...\nGodot:\nI'm already seeing a very hot someone, so I'm afraid you'll be waiting for a long time.\nMaya:\nI bet she has mocha-cream skin and cappuccino perfume.\nArmstrong:\nBien. I will tell you... Z'ere was only one seat from which you could 'ave seen...Armstrong:\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo why can you only see the victim from that particular seat?\nArmstrong:\nMais, monsieur. It is obvious, non? If you look at la plans you will understand. La victim would 'ave been reflected in la mirror like so. If you were sitting at la table next to 'im, you would see everything, non?\nMaya:\nSo that's the seat Old Seedy was sitting in on that day... ...when the poisoning happened.\nPhoenix:\n(The old man was sitting at the table next to the victim? Why does that seem kinda odd...?)Present Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor!

(You mean I was wrong?)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is what should not be in the picture!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry? I'm afraid you've lost me.\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nGodot:\nHa...! I suppose it's up to me to clarify the defense's claim. The something that \"shouldn't exist\" is clearly...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, wait, wait! I've change my mind, Your Honor! (The last thing I need right now is a scalding hot coffee shower...)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examinationMaya:\nIt is pretty strange, though, isn't it? I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.Phoenix:\nThen the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. (Now I've just got to prove it... Somehow...)Phoenix:\nThere is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony. Mr. Kudo broke the vase that was on the table where he was sitting. And yet! As the court can see, there is an unbroken vase on the table next to the victim! Why? Because Mr. Kudo was not, in fact, sitting at the table next to the victim at all!Godot:Godot:\nDon't be an idiot, Trite! That's impossible! That seat's the only one Kudo could've seen the victim's reflection from!Phoenix:\nExactly!Godot:\n...!Phoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion we can draw from this contradiction. There was no mirror in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day! Your testimony, Mr. Armstrong, is an elaborate lie!Armstrong:\nMon dieeeeeeeu!Godot:Godot:\nDon't try to confuse the court, Trite! Obviously, the witness cleaned up the vase... ...while the police were taking their time getting to the crime scene!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Godot, that doesn't quite work for me. Mr. Armstrong already testified to the contrary. In his own words... \"I did not touch anything else\" except the mirror!Godot:\nUr... urgh! ... Gaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nWell, witness? What do you have to say for yourself?Armstrong:\n*sniffle*Phoenix:\n(I was right! There was no mirror in the restaurant that day!)Judge:\nIn light of this revelation, we return back to the original problem. Why did the victim have an earpiece in an ear in which he couldn't hear?Godot:\nHa...! You only get one shot in life. There's no turning back. If you want to claim that the mirror wasn't there, Trite... ...then this problem is all yours. How do you explain what the old man saw?Phoenix:\n(If I can answer this, then I'll be that much closer to the truth! I can feel it!)Maya:\n...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?Phoenix:\nThere's more than just this one contradiction, Maya.Maya:\nWhat do you mean?Phoenix:\nRemember what Maggey told us? \"There was another man at the victim's table.\" And, \"there was a sample CD on the victim's table.\" It all flies in the face of Mr. Kudo's testimony. (And I think I know the reason why nothing in this case is adding up.)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Let's hear your answer.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The reason behind all the contradictions in Mr. Kudo's testimony is simple.Mr. Kudo made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, Mr. Kudo made a mistake!\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... You're the one who brought up all these contradictions.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nGodot:\nIf you're trying to tell us the old man just made a mistake... ...we can wrap up this case right now with a guilty verdict!\nJudge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? Should I just declare your client guilty?\nMaya:\nIs that the best you can come up with, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The ear doctor made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe we're looking at this the wrong way. It was actually the doctor's mistake.\nJudge:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The doctor got the wrong ear!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWell, I believe we saw an autopsy report yesterday. One that stated the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, and had medicine in it!\nJudge:\nI'm beginning to wonder if it's not your eardrum that's ruptured, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be playing with people's perceptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The victim was a phony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This case is riddled with contradictions.\"Phoenix:\nThis case is riddled with contradictions. Yet, there is one very simple answer that clears them all up.Judge:\nA-And what is that?Phoenix:\nThe incident Mr. Kudo witnessed, and the incident the victim experienced... ...were two completely different events!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nYes! The \"victim\" that Mr. Kudo saw wasn't Mr. Glen Elg at all! It was an imposter -- a phony pretending to be Mr. Elg! Obviously, unlike the victim, there was nothing wrong with the imposter's left eardrum. That's how he ended up wearing the earpiece in his left ear by mistake!Godot:\nPhwoooooooh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Settle down, or I'll clear the courtroom!Godot:\nQuiet, gramps! Why don't you clear out of here, huh?Judge:\nWHAT DID YOU SAY!?Godot:\nTrite... Are you saying what Mr. Kudo saw was a set-up?Phoenix:\nYes. Someone pretended to be Glen Elg and acted out the whole coffee poisoning. All for the express purpose of creating a \"witness\" out of one Mr. Victor Kudo!Godot:Godot:\nGet real, Trite! Why would anyone want to do that?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious? The thing Mr. Kudo was most insistent about in his testimony was...Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nI-It's so hard to believe, but...Phoenix:\nThere was one, and only one reason to show Mr. Kudo this fake poisoning! To show Maggey Byrde in the act of poisoning the coffee!Godot:Godot:\nAre you insinuating that the waitress in the old man's story was a fake as well? It's true that there were no customers in the restaurant at the time, but... ...it's also true that the chef was there! He would have noticed what was happening.Judge:\nTh-That's right! Well, witness? If your restaurant really was the scene of such theatrics... ...you would have known about it, correct!?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0... Z'is is most difficult for me...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, it's quite simple. All you have to do is testify. You are under oath, after all. Was there, in fact, a phony at Tr\u00e9s Bien that day!? The defense demands that Mr. Armstrong tell the whole truth about what happened.Judge:\nThe defense's request for additional testimony is accepted. You will accurately explain, in detail, the events in the restaurant that day!Armstrong:\nOu... Oui.Witness Testimony-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\nZ'ere were no other customers.\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Judge:\n...Just so we're clear, there was no mirror in the restaurant, after all?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Forgive me, Your Honor! I lied because I wanted z'is mess to be cleared up quickly.Judge:\nWhat you have just done is commit perjury, Mr. Armstrong! I will decide how to punish you later.Armstrong:\nO-Oui...Judge:\nFor now, we will hear your cross-examination. Mr. Wright, if you please. (Changed from [For now, we will hear your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Hmm.. He took that perjury charge a bit too well. But I'm guessing he'll be more serious trouble after this cross-examination!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas he alone at his table as well?\nArmstrong:\nMais, oui. I saw 'im from la kitchen.\nPhoenix:\nYet the defendant, Ms. Byrde, remembers it differently. She swears there was another man at the victim's table.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Unfortunately for you, Trite... ...yesterday's witness also testified that the victim was alone.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou know, seeing you squirm like that reminds me... ...of a certain coffee's bitter-sweet bite.\nPhoenix:\n(What kind of coffee has he been drinking!?)\nMaya:\nIt's not coffee, it's love! It's love that's bitter-sweet.\nPhoenix:\n(Hearing Maya say that makes her seem wise all of a sudden...)Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy old man, you mean Victor Kudo, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui. 'E comes often for my special coffee.\nGodot:\nI drank your coffee once, Mr. Armstrong. It's special, I'll give you that. It's worth a sip just for the experience.\nArmstrong:\nOh, you make me so 'appy, monsieur! You are most welcome any time!\nGodot:\nI said it was worth one sip, and nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n(So old Mr. Kudo arrived at the restaurant around the same time as the victim. Maybe I should ask about his arrival in more detail.)\n\n\n\nDon't ask anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I need to do is establish that this phony victim really existed. Asking more about the old man is only going to cloud the issue.) I think that's enough about coffee. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Armstrong.\nArmstrong:\nYou are welcome any time too, Monsieur Wright. I'll brew something special for you!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHow many minutes after?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying that not much time elapsed between when the victim and Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Z'at is correct.\nPhoenix:\n(But that still leaves the possibility that something happened in that gap of time.) And by your recollection, how much time would you say elapsed?\nArmstrong:\nLet me see... Approximately 2 minutes, I would say.\nPhoenix:\nT-Two minutes!? That's all?\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems unlikely that anything untoward could have happened in such a short time.\nPhoenix:\n(Rats! I knew I shouldn't have pursued this line of questioning...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhat time is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOut of curiosity, about what time was it when Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOh, no... I cannot remember, monsieur.\nJudge:\nHmm... I believe we were told by a witness yesterday...\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\n\n\nJudge:\nDoes that perhaps jog your memory, witness?\nArmstrong:\nLa incident 'appened about 20 minutes after 'e arrived. So the victim must 'ave arrived between 2:00 PM and 2:10 PM, non?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Just after 2, huh...)\nArmstrong:\nThank you for your 'elp, in jogging my memory, monsieur. You are wonderful!\nJudge:\nHah hah hah! I can't sit here all the time and do nothing now, can I!? The time of day will be added to the witness's testimony.\nArmstrong:\nOui, Monsieur Judge.

Per'aps I could recite it for la court?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you contacted the police as soon as the incident occurred?\nArmstrong:\nI asked la old man to call from la pay phone.\nGodot:\nBy your own argument, Trite... ...the purpose of this \"phony victim's\" performance was so the old man would see it. In other words... ...once the incident occurred, this opportunity would completely disappear.\nJudge:\nIndeed.\nArmstrong:\nBien. It seems la shadow of doubt 'as been lifted, n'est-ce pas?\nPhoenix:\n...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Maya:\nI guess Mr. Armstrong is connected to this case, huh?Phoenix:\nAbsolutely. Someone was impersonating Mr. Elg, and I refuse to believe he was oblivious. He was there the whole time, after all.Maya:\nBut if you're right, wouldn't Maggey have noticed, too?Phoenix:\nShe fell unconscious when the incident occurred, remember?Maya:\nAh! You mean that's when the phony staged his act?Phoenix:\nWe'll know for sure once I find a hole in this testimony.Phoenix:\nI'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.Armstrong:\nQ-Quoi? What do you mean?Phoenix:\nAt the time in question, the victim was listening to the radio with his earpiece. The show he was listening to was \"Millionaire Radio\". Each week, they announce the winning number of a half million dollar lottery ticket.Armstrong:\nOui. Z'at must be la show Mon. Elg was listening to.Judge:\nI can't see any problem with this testimony, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nI wonder...Armstrong:\n...?Phoenix:\nYou say the victim arrived at your restaurant after 2 PM, correct?Armstrong:\nOui, oui. I am sure of it. I remember it perfectly now! I know it was z'at time, because I 'ad just finished serving la lunch menu.Godot:\nGet to the point, Trite. If you have one.Phoenix:\nThat show is broadcast live at 1:30 PM. And it claims to be \"the most thrilling 10 minutes of your life\"...Judge:\nI-It's on the air at 1:30!?Phoenix:\nNow, supposedly, the victim made some noise when it was announced that he had won. And yet... I don't believe his cry of joy could have occurred after 2 PM! Because the show had already finished more than 30 minutes earlier by that point in time!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Phoenix:\nThis \"victim\" we've been told about has done nothing but the impossible! Listening to the radio with a ruptured eardrum, catching a show that was already over... There is only one conclusion you can draw from these facts! This \"victim\" was an imposter, acting out the poisoning 30 minutes after the real murder! Yes, there were two Glen Elgs in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. The real Glen Elg, now dead, having been poisoned by the real killer... ...and the phony Glen Elg, acting out the events for Mr. Kudo to witness!Judge:\nI-It certainly seems that way... I mean, if that wasn't the case, how could you explain the time discrepancy?Godot:Godot:\nQuite a performance, Trite. You were almost on a roll.Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nBut sadly, you lack the rock hard foundation of rhythm to build your song!Phoenix:\n(...What is this? Music Theory 101?)Godot:\nLet's recap. According to your \"imaginative\" theory, it's now just after 2 PM... The phony Elg is performing a play for the benefit of Mr. Kudo. How do you explain then, where the real Glen Elg is!?Phoenix:\nI don't believe I have to spell this out for court! However! At that time, the real Glen Elg was already dead!Judge:\nThat's certainly the obvious conclusion.Godot:Godot:\nThank you, Trite. That's exactly what I was hoping you would say.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Godot:\nNow, I presume you can prove this theory of yours...? Can you explain where the missing corpse went to!?Phoenix:\nTh-The missing corpse...?Godot:\nAccording to the old man's testimony, there was only one other customer there. If that \"customer\" was the phony Glen Elg... ...then where did the killer hide the body of the real victim!?Phoenix:\nNaaaaaargh!Judge:\nThe prosecution has a valid point, Mr. Wright. If your theory is to stand up to examination by the court... ...you must provide us with proof by answering the prosecution's question. Where did the killer hide the body?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...Godot:\nNo conjecture, Trite. Let's hear some facts for once. Show the court a piece of evidence that proves where the body was hidden!Phoenix:\nE-Evidence!?Maya:\nWh-What's with the intense pressure in here all of a sudden!?Phoenix:\n(I thought I had him with that contradiction. But he's turned it all around and backed me into a corner instead!)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence. First, where was the body of the real Mr. Elg concealed?Outside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien. Therefore, the killer must have hauled the body outside!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight. What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nStart over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think I need to clear my head...\nGodot:\nHa...! I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo tambi\u00e9n.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent more evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll hit them with another piece of evidence and see if that helps...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Clearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\"Inside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt'd would [sic] have been too dangerous to take the body outside. Obviously, the body must have been hidden somewhere inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nJudge:\nHmm... Interesting... But where could a body have been hidden inside a restaurant? Perhaps you would care to show the court on these plans, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The exact location where the body was concealed inside Tr\u00e9s Bien is...\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe body was hidden here!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent Small Bottle (after presenting Kitchen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight.

The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPick another location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll have another go at proving where the body was hidden.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It'd would have been too dangerous to take the body outside.\"Phoenix:\nMr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non, non! I 'ave never seen z'at ugly bottle before in my life! I only use la very best bottles, monsieur! Z'e 'ighest quality only for me!Judge:\nWhere was that bottle found, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nInterestingly enough, Your Honor. it was found in the kitchen of Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nEh? Quoi!? But I only ever use z'ese bottles for my aromatherapy oils.Phoenix:\nBut this bottle doesn't contain aromatherapy oil, Mr. Armstrong. No, it contains a medication.Judge:\nWhat kind of medication?Phoenix:\nI'm sure everyone remembers, don't they? That Mr. Elg visited an otolaryngological clinic, and was given medication that day!Godot:\nY-You can't be serious...Phoenix:\nThe defense had the contents of the bottle analyzed, and I have the lab results here! The contents of the bottle match the prescription that was given to Mr. Elg!Godot:\nBwooooar!Phoenix:\nGlen Elg's murderer hid the body in the restaurant kitchen. At which time, this bottle fell out of the victim's pocket. Mr. Armstrong! When the incident occurred, didn't you say you were in the kitchen?Armstrong:\nM-M-Mon dieu!Phoenix:\nYes, you know about what I'm about to say, It was YOU who hid the victim's body! You did a fine job pretending to defend my client, Maggey Byrde. However! You were setting her up to take the fall behind the poor girl's back!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! This is an extraordinary development. Witness! Did you... Did you murder Mr. Glen Elg?Armstrong:\nNever! I could not do such an 'orrible thing!Godot:\nNoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!?Godot:\n...The bitterness... Every time I get lied to, I always down a mug of coffee. ...That's one of my rules.Phoenix:\n(Do you have the slightest idea how many cups you've had by now...?)Godot:\nThen I like to do the same to the person who lied to me. I like to take them down with my empty cup! Listen up, chef! How about a brand new flavor in your ear, my \"h\" deficient friend?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Please, you must 'ear me out! It is a trap! Listen to me! Por favor!Judge:\nYo hablo Espa\u00f1ol, Mr. Armstrong, and \"Por favor\" is Spanish.Godot:\nI'm only going to ask you once. Did you do it?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non! Absolutely non! I simply... I...Godot:\nLet's hear it. You've got one shot. Right, gramps?Judge:\nWitness! The court will permit you the chance to make one final statement. If you lie under oath again, Mr. Godot's coffee mug awaits you... As does my gavel!Armstrong:\nO-Oui... It is clear.Phoenix:\n(What do they always say in the movies...? \"I've got a bad feeling about this...\"?)Judge:\nVery well! Begin your final testimony, Mr. Armstrong!Witness Testimony-- The Confession --Armstrong:\nIt is true, I 'id la body in la kitchen.\nA man forced me to do it.

By who!?Armstrong:\nI-I cannot say! Or I will be... erased!Phoenix:\nLet's try a different question then. When Mr. Elg died, was he really the only person at his table?Armstrong:\n... Z'ere was... Z'ere was another man.Phoenix:\n(I knew it!)Maya:\nMaggey was telling the truth!Judge:\nYou may cross-examine the witness now, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(There's just one more thing I need to do.

Maybe a month ago in this very courtroom?) This man is Furio Tigre. He's the manager of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\".\nArmstrong:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere's no point trying to hide the truth anymore, Mr. Armstrong. I know you couldn't go against Mr. Tigre.

I do have one further question for you, Mr. Armstrong. The poison and the lottery ticket were recovered from the defendant's apron pocket. Was that your doing as well?Armstrong:\nNon!

But Godot picked up on it, remember? He pointed out that without proof, we don't know if what he testified is the truth.Maya:\nYou mean, you think Mr. Armstrong was lying?Phoenix:\nI don't know. But if that's the line the prosecution takes, we could be in trouble.

I ain't never seen that young kid before!\nJudge:\n...I do believe the witness's last statement was important. Um... Mr. Godot, if you could please...\nGodot:\nMr. Tigre.

But it appears that Mr. Elg knew you.Tigre:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nMr. Elg left this little note on his calendar. \"Meet with The Tiger\"... And the date? December 3rd.

It's always that way when I wanna talk about repayments. Even though I got the best punching bag you' ever seen if there are any \"issues\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it's because of the punching bag that people are scared to come?) So that's why you decided to meet at Tr\u00e9s Bien?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! You're going over old ground again, Trite.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry.\nGodot:\nYou just earned yourself a penalty. Now suck it down!\nJudge:\nYou will suck down the penalty, Mr. Wright. And you will like it!\nPhoenix:\n(Thank you, sir, may I have another!)Tigre:\nWhen I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAn \"ugly scene\"? What do you mean?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nThe witness has already told us, Trite. Which makes that question... irrelevant!\nPhoenix:\nB-But...!\nGodot:\nI limit myself to 17 cups of coffee during a trial. That's the rule. You better limit the number of times you take a penalty, Trite. Or your guts will look like the inside of a chimney! Ashen!\nJudge:\nDon't make me burn you again, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I shouldn't have pressed him on that.)\nTigre:\nGuess I'm gonna make that special express after all.\nJudge:\nSo, to recap... This \"ugly scene\" you saw was...?Present Tr\u00e9s Bien Floor Plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?\"Tigre:\nThe guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you saw Glen Elg's dead body?\nTigre:\nI guess I did. But I only saw him from behind. He was wearin' some raggy bit of cloth he called a hat.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what time was this?\nTigre:\nI dunno.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nTigre:\nYou' know what winds me up more than anythin' else in the world? Watches! Round watches! I ain't gonna pollute my paws wid some tickin' henpecker!\nJudge:\nOut of interest, Mr. Tigre, what winds you up the second most?\nTigre:\nHuh? Whad'youse think!? Square watches!\nPhoenix:\n(Is this guy for real!?)\nTigre:\nLook, all I need to know was that somethin' bad was goin' down in that place.Present Tr\u00e9s Bien Floor Plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?\"Tigre:\nI figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you didn't actually set foot inside the restaurant, then?\nTigre:\nThe Tiger is a busy cat. I don't hang around for no one. I ain't got time to be caught up in no murder investigation.\nPhoenix:\nSo, when exactly did you pick up the matches?\nGodot:\nThere are matches just inside the front door. Our detective friend wound up in trouble with the chef after taking 5 books home.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe... It's almost enough to make a man cry...)Tigre:\nI heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou went straight back? Did a bout of guilt suddenly hit you for what you did?\nTigre:\nWhat're youse trying to say!? You' tryin' to tell me youse ain't never been guilty of nothin'?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nGodot:\nWe all have our crosses to bear. We all have to swallow the dark secrets we hide... ...Like this!\nPhoenix:\n(The courtroom's not exactly the place to talk about dark secrets, is it?)\nJudge:\nIt seems you've done it again, Mr. Wright. Another irrelevant line of questioning. I must impose a penalty accordingly!\nPhoenix:\n(How about a penalty for those two jokers and the garbage they keep coming up with!?)Maya:\nWell, Nick? What do you think?Phoenix:\nHe's running out of ways to avoid the truth. I need to press him fast before he has time to think things through. I've got to come right back at him with a contradiction!Maya:\nBe careful what you press him on, though, or you'll get penalized, OK?Phoenix:\nYou're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?Tigre:\nNo one escapes The Tiger's clutches!Phoenix:\nWell I'm something of a lie detecting pro.Tigre:\n...Phoenix:\nAnd no one escapes The Phoenix's clutches! I think it's time we got something straight.Godot:\nWhat's this, Trite? A new line of irrelevant questioning?Phoenix:\nThese are the floor plans of the crime scene. You say you were standing at the entrance, Mr. Tigre? From there, your field of vision would have covered an area something like... this.Judge:\nIndeed. The witness would have had a clear view of the victim's seat.Tigre:\nIsn't that what I just said? I saw the back of the kid's head.Phoenix:\nUnfortunately for you, that is not possible. If the court would think back, you'll remember that between each of the tables... ...is a tall partition!Judge:\nWhy...! That's true!Phoenix:\nNow look at the plans again! The truth is painfully obvious! From the entrance, the field of vision of any customer walking in... ...ends here!Tigre:\n...Phoenix:\nSo, from the entrance of Tr\u00e9s Bien, you couldn't have seen the victim's seat. But you did see the victim that day... because you met with him!Godot:Godot:\nWrong! Have you forgotten the old man's testimony yesterday? The victim was alone at his table.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut the defense just proved that point to be moot! The \"victim\" witnessed by Mr. Kudo was not Glen Elg, but a fake!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nIn order to have Mr. Kudo falsely testify... ...the real killer posed as the victim he had just killed and acted out a charade!Judge:\nThat will do! This trial has gone on long enough without the obvious question being answered. Who exactly was this \"real killer\" who impersonated the victim?Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nYou say the killer murdered Glen Elg... ...and then impersonated his victim in a performance for Victor Kudo? In that case, Mr. Wright, reveal the identity of this \"criminal\" to the court!Present Furio Tigre profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nObviously, it's the person you least expect! Um... What's the matter, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nOh, nothing! I just dropped my pen again. Don't mind me. Carry on with the proceedings as normal.\nMaya:\nBetter think again while he's down there, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I should've picked the obvious choice...)\nJudge:\nVery good. I've found my pen now. So, allow me to pose the question again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"You say the killer murdered Glen Elg...\"Phoenix:\nObviously... ...the killer is Furio Tigre! No one else could have done it.Judge:\nWh-What!? Well, witness?Tigre:\n... Grrrah ha hah! Now that's cute! Youse think you can pin this on The Tiger!? Maybe youse don't understand. The Tiger is king of the jungle! So I dares you' to say it again! Come on! You' got the guts!?Judge:\nY-Y-You can't threaten m-me, Mr. Tigre! I-It's the defense! Go ahead and tell the witness, Mr. Wright! Mr. Wriiight!Tigre:\nSounds to me like it must be you', old man. Youse got guts, I'll give you that.Judge:\nM-M-Mr. Wright! Do not leave me to handle this alone!Godot:\n...Ha...! Perhaps I can end this embarrassment.Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!Godot:\nLet's just go back over Mr. Kudo's testimony one more time. The old man didn't see just the victim! Oh, no, no, no.Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there!Godot:\nWas the victim he saw the real victim or not? That doesn't matter. The fact remains, he saw the accused put the poison into the coffee!Judge:\n...! Yes, it was the waitress who poisoned the coffee--Phoenix:Phoenix:\nV-Very impressive, Mr. Godot. ...Waiting for my absence to launch your attack!Godot:\nHa...! Found your pen at last, Trite?Phoenix:\nIt was in my pocket. *ahem* But anyway... Mr. Kudo witnessed two people that day. He saw the victim, the \"supposed\" Mr. Glen Elg, and the \"waitress\"... from behind.Judge:\nYes... Your point, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nI think the conclusion is obvious. If this \"Glen Elg\" was really the killer in disguise... ...then surely it's possible the \"waitress\" was also part of the show.Judge:\nWhat!? You mean, the waitress was an imposter as well!?Phoenix:\nThe defendant, Ms. Byrde, fell unconscious immediately after the incident. And someone used her fainting to hatch an elaborate plan to pin the murder on her!Judge:\nWho on earth was it!? Who was this \"waitress\" that Mr. Kudo witnessed?Present Viola Cadaverini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"W-Who is this woman?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nObviously, it's the person you least expect! Um... What's the matter, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nOh, nothing! I just dropped my pen again. Don't mind me. Carry on with the proceedings as normal.\nMaya:\nBetter think again while he's down there, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I should've picked the obvious choice...)\nJudge:\nVery good. I've found my pen now. So, allow me to pose the question again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"Who on earth was it!?\"Judge:\nW-Who is this woman?Phoenix:\nHer name is Viola Cadaverini. She's an employee of Tender Lender.Tigre:\nYouse makin' a big mistake... D'you know who Violetta's grandfather is? You' betta be goin' home in an armored truck tonight, if you' know what I mean...Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nStop shaking, Nick!Phoenix:\nWh-Where was I? Yes, the defendant, Ms. Byrde, has stated the following...Byrde:\nWell, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant.Byrde:\nUmm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh.Tigre:\n...Phoenix:\nThere are just too many contradictions in this case. The \"second man\" at the victim's table who nobody but Ms. Byrde seems to have seen. The earpiece worn by the victim in his left ear when that eardrum was ruptured! And the radio show he was supposedly listening to half an hour after it was over. There is only one logical explanation that clears up all of these contradictions! The whole incident took place twice! Once for real, and once for show! And, Mr. Furio Tigre, the only person who could have committed the crime... ...was you!Tigre:\n... ......Judge:\nW-Witness? What have you got to say?Tigre:\n... That's cute!Judge:\nS-Sorry?Tigre:\nYouse alright. I could do with a guy like you' around.Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean?Tigre:\nOK, I'm in on this game! I'm gonna have to charter a jet to get me to my meetin' now, but... ...I'm gonna give youse one more thing to think about before I go.Phoenix:\nSomething to think about?Tigre:\nYouse got it all wrapped up nice, huh, Wright? But youse missed out one real important thing!Phoenix:\nBut that can't be!Tigre:\nI was in the joint that day. And I met that kid, too.Phoenix:\n...!Tigre:\nBut I couldn't have poisoned him, youse hear?Judge:\nWhat!? Do you really expect us to believe you now, Mr. Tigre?Godot:\nHa...! What a troublemaker.Phoenix:\nT-Troublemaker...?Godot:\nLooks like we're going to need another one for the road. One more steaming cup of hot testimony!Judge:\nIndeed. Witness, you will explain yourself to the court. I will give you one more chance to testify. What happened that day at Tr\u00e9s Bien between yourself and the victim?Witness Testimony-- Ties to the Victim --Tigre:\nYeah, I loaned Elg cash. About 100,000 dollars.\nThat day, we was due to have a little chat. The kid had hit his payback date, see?\nSo anyway, he tells me he's got no way to pay up.\nI'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.\n\"Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks!\" He got lucky, you' know. Real lucky.\nIf that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.Judge:\nNow, I see that the principal amount you loaned to Mr. Elg was 50,000 dollars...Tigre:\nYeah, well. Youse got the vig to take into account. Interest builds up fast, you' know.Phoenix:\n(That's faster than fast! 100,000 dollars is twice his principal!)Judge:\nAnd the repayment deadline was December 3rd, the day of the incident in question.Tigre:\nYeah. He was one lucky kid! He got that half a million just in time. So I ain't have no reason to kill the kid. And if I ain't got no motive, you ain't got no case!Phoenix:\n(His motive? Hmm... He has to have one, but what is it?)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Ties to the Victim --Tigre:\nYeah, I loaned Elg cash. About 100,000 dollars.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid he have any way of paying the loan back?\nTigre:\nThe fool was a gambler. He said he couldn't give it up 'til he landed a big win. So I agreed to help him.\nJudge:\nHelp him? You?\nTigre:\nI kept hittin' him with ideas for ways he could getta big win. But the guy kept losin'.\nPhoenix:\nSo you were helping him for his sake? Or yours?\nTigre:\n\"Win Through Compromise\"! Youse help me, I help youse! What's the difference, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(...I don't believe this!)\nMaya:\nNick, would anyone really ever loan money to someone they thought was unreliable? Like, for example, if it were you, I'd only loan you five bucks, max.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks a lot, Maya.)Tigre:\nThat day, we was due to have a little chat. The kid had hit his payback date, see?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo how much were you expecting him to pay you back on that day?\nTigre:\nWhat d'youse think!? The whole package! $100,000, including interest.\nMaya:\nThat's a real heavyweight punch!\nTigre:\nOnce a client misses a repayment, you' call the whole loan in. You' wanna make it in my world, that's all youse gotta know.\nJudge:\nAnd how many times had Mr. Elg been late with his repayments?\nTigre:\nOnce.\nPhoenix:\nAnd how much was he supposed to pay back every month?\nTigre:\n50 bucks.\nMaya:\nSounds like Mr. Elg was in a real sticky spot.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, at 50 dollars a month, he'd never pay that huge loan off!)Tigre:\nSo anyway, he tells me he's got no way to pay up.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow much did he have left on his debt?\nTigre:\nYou want it in round figures? About 100,000 bucks.\nPhoenix:\n(That's the whole amount!)\nGodot:\nWe're talking about a guy who had 58 cents in his wallet.\nTigre:\nWhat!? Youse tellin' me he wasn't even gonna pay for the coffee!?\nJudge:\nHe certainly seems to have been a brave man, this Mr. Elg.\nTigre:\nThat guy was smooth, I tell youse. Real smooth! \"You'll have your money in less than 5 minutes!\" That's what he says to me. The guy then calls me the \"Tender Tiger\". He was skatin' on thin ice with me!Tigre:\nI'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas that because he...?\nTigre:\nThe guy won the lottery. Was his last chance at a big win.\nJudge:\nAnd you confirm that this is the ticket in question?\nTigre:\n...That's it.\nJudge:\nThe \"Millionaire Radio\" show starts at 1:30 PM and runs for 10 minutes... That fixes the time you two met with some accuracy.\nPhoenix:\n(And the whole scene was acted out again 30 minutes later. All so that Mr. Kudo would see it!)\nTigre:\nI can still see the kid's face now. I ain't never gonna forget it.Tigre:\n\"Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks!\" He got lucky, you' know. Real lucky.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas there anyone else in the restaurant at the time?\nTigre:\nI don't remember.\nPhoenix:\n(If there was no one there, I'll wear that ridiculous tiger shirt for a month! Mr. Armstrong, Maggey and if I'm right, Viola Cadaverini, were all there at that time.)\nJudge:\nSo, the victim had intended to repay you from his lottery winnings from the beginning?\nTigre:\nSeems dat way to me.\nJudge:\nB-But you wouldn't normally expect to win the lottery, would you!?\nGodot:\nHa...! The undying belief that your next roll will end the worst losing streak you ever had... That's what defines a true gambler.\nPhoenix:\n(He makes it sound so cool...)\nMaya:\nDon't be tempted, Nick! You haven't got the will-power for it!\nTigre:\nAll I know is, the kid took a shot and he got lucky in the end.Tigre:\nIf that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe waitress. You mean...?\nTigre:\nThe girl with the glasses in the defendant's chair! Who else could I mean!? If she hadn't got in the way, things woulda been, bada-bing, bada-boom, over and done with!\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe I should push a little on this...)\n\n\n\nAsk about what Maggey did\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat exactly are you implying the defendant did?\nTigre:\nHow about you go ask four-eyes about that half a million dollar ticket! She wanted it so bad... ...she poisoned Elg's coffee.\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA likely theory! Your word hasn't held water lately, Mr. Tigre.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nLet's not forget this witness was actually at the scene, Trite.\nTigre:\nThe law don't exactly agree with some of the deals I send down. I couldn't be there when de cops showed up, so I split.\nJudge:\nI-I see...\nGodot:\nYour Honor! The witness's last few statements are worth a good two cups of coffee.\nJudge:\nI concur, Mr. Godot! You will amend your testimony accordingly, witness!\nTigre:\nHa ha ha! So that's what youse after, Phoenix Wright!\nChanges statement from \"If that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.\" to \"Thanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!\"\n\n\n\n\nAsk how things would've been\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean things would have been over and done with?\nTigre:\nAre youse all there or what!? I'm talkin' about the cash! I was there to get my 100,000 bucks back. That's all. I'm a business man. It was all comin' together before that waitress got in the way.\nJudge:\nHmm... As far as I can tell from the witness's testimony... ...other than recouping his loan, Mr. Tigre had no motive for killing the victim. Witness! You will amend your testimony to reflect what you just said.\nPhoenix:\n(The Tiger's motive, huh...)\nChanges statement from \"If that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.\" to \"I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\"Tigre:\nThanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(The Tiger's trying to pin the crime on Maggey. If I ask him about what he saw, it's only going to damage our case.) What do you mean things would have been over and done with?\nTigre:\nAre youse all there or what!? I'm talkin' about the cash! I was there to get my 100,000 bucks back. That's all. I'm a business man. It was all comin' together before that waitress got in the way.\nJudge:\nHmm... As far as I can tell from the witness's testimony... ...other than recouping his loan, Mr. Tigre had no motive for killing the victim. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you happy with the testimony, or would you like it amended?\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I better leave it at that and try to figure something out...) Thank you, Your Honor, but there is no need to amend the testimony.\nJudge:\nVery well. Continue with your cross-examination, then.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHave it amended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not going to get anywhere with the testimony as it stands...) Your Honor, the defense would like the testimony amended.\nJudge:\nVery well. Witness! You will amend your testimony to reflect your recent statements, please.\nChanges statement from \"Thanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!\" to \"I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\"Tigre:\nI was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you saying you had no other motives that day?\nTigre:\nYeah, so what?\nGodot:\nThen why didn't you take the lottery ticket when you left?\nTigre:\nWhy d'youse think!? Because of four-eyes over there!\nPhoenix:\n(Because of Maggey!?)\nTigre:\nHow about you go ask four-eyes about that half a million dollar ticket! She wanted it so bad... ...she poisoned Elg's coffee.\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA likely theory!

I don't believe the 100,000 dollars is what you were after.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWhat are you getting at, Trite? What else would a moneylender be after other than money!?\nPhoenix:\nOh, the moneylender was after money. But money in a totally different league. The kind of money that a single disc like this would fetch!\nTigre:\n...!\nJudge:\nWhat is that?\nPhoenix:\nA computer virus, Your Honor. A virus called \"MC Bomber\"!\nJudge:\nA \"computer virus\"? What does one of those do?\nPhoenix:\nA computer virus is a program that wreaks havoc on the insides of a computer.\nJudge:\nA \"computer\"? What does one of those do?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess the beard isn't the only part of His Honor that is from the stone age!) I'll explain it to you later, Your Honor. Right now, this is the important point... A virus like \"MC Bomber\" would be worth several million dollars on the black market.\nJudge:\nS-Several million dollars!?\nPhoenix:\nLending money with no hope of ever seeing repayment would normally be bad for business. But in this case, the very fact that Glen Elg had no way to repay the money is crucial.\nJudge:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nGlen Elg was a programmer. A highly skilled programmer. That skill was the collateral Mr. Elg put up in order to borrow the money.\nTigre:\n...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou're trying to suggest the witness's motive was to get hold of that program?\nPhoenix:\nExactly.\nGodot:\nThe witness may be poor fashion sense, but he is by no means an idiot, Trite. A man like him could get his hands on one million dollars without resorting to murder.\nPhoenix:\nOf course he could... Provided that he had time. But what if he had needed the money right then? When the pressure's on, the luxury of choice tends to disappear.\nJudge:\nIt seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright. Would you care to share it with us? Why did Mr. Tigre need money to the tune of one million dollars?\n\n\n\nPresent Viola's Medical Papers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"In December of last year, you found yourself in need of a huge amount of money.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?\nGodot:\nIt's evidence... that Trite has no idea what he's doing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? What do you mean?\nGodot:\nYou're way off track, Trite. That evidence is irrelevant!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did he have the right to dish out penalties?)\nMaya:\nA-Are you alright, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n100,000 dollars wasn't enough for Mr. Tigre. He needed much more money than that. And in a hurry!\nLeads back to:\n\"It seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright.\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIn December of last year, you found yourself in need of a huge amount of money.\nTigre:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nAbout 6 months ago, you were involved in a traffic accident, weren't you? An accident involving a car and a scooter, in which a young woman was injured. She was taken to the hospital, where she underwent surgery.\nTigre:\nH-How muccha dis... do youse know...!? (Changed from [Wh-Where did youse get all this info...?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThese medical papers document the treatment of the young woman in question. According to these, her operation cost... one million dollars! And yet, when the payment was due last month, you somehow managed to pay it in full! (Changed from [Payment for these expenses was due in December of last year, and was paid in full!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nO-One million dollars!? A preposterous sum! Someone should sue these HMOs!\nGodot:\nHa...! No one would pay a bill like that. If the medical association got wind of it, the hospital would end up as dead as a morgue.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Tigre had no choice but to pay! Because his very life depended on it!\nTigre:\nGrrraaaaaaaargh!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order! Order! You say his very life depended on it, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nIndeed it did. Simply because the injured woman was none other than Viola Cadaverini.\nGodot:\n...! Did you say, \"Cadaverini\"?\nPhoenix:\nBruto Cadaverini, Mob boss in charge of all underworld activities in the city, and... ...doting grandfather to his precious \"Violetta\", also known as Viola Cadaverini.\nGodot:\nBwooooar!\nPhoenix:\nYour life was in danger unless you paid \"compensation\" to the boss, correct? It makes sense! You were desperate to acquire the one million dollars Cadaverini demanded of you! So desperate, in fact, that you decided to sacrifice Glen Elg's life to pay your debt!\nLeads to:\n\"On the day of the murder, Mr. Tigre's sole intention was to get his hands on this CD!\"Present Viola's Medical Papers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you just intended to get back the 100,000 dollars Mr. Elg owed you, correct?\nTigre:\nI loaned the guy the cash, so that's my right.\nPhoenix:\nUnfortunately for Mr. Elg... ...100,000 dollars wasn't enough to cover it, wasn't it?\nTigre:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nAbout 6 months ago, you were involved in a traffic accident, weren't you? An accident involving a car and a scooter, in which a young woman was injured. She was taken to the hospital, where she underwent surgery.\nTigre:\nH-How muccha dis... do youse know...!?

It makes sense! You were desperate to acquire the one million dollars Cadaverini demanded of you! So desperate, in fact, that you decided to sacrifice Glen Elg's life to pay your debt!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! What do you say to that, witness?\nTigre:\n...Grrr... urgh...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nIt's a nice little fairy tale, Trite. But even if the witness did need a million dollars... ...that doesn't tie him to Mr. Elg's murder. Mr. Elg only owed him 100,000 dollars, and had no hope of repaying it anyway!\nTigre:\nYeah. That guy wasn't worth my spit!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't think so. In fact, the opposite is true.\nGodot:\nThe opposite?\nPhoenix:\nLending money with no hope of ever seeing repayment would normally be bad for business. But... In this case, the very fact that Glen Elg had no way to repay the money is crucial.\nJudge:\nWhat!?\nMaya:\nDo you know where you're going with this, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYou've got to think outside the box, Maya.\nMaya:\nOutside the box?\nPhoenix:\nIt's very straightforward. Mr. Tigre wasn't after the 100,000 dollars at all.\nJudge:\nIt seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright. Would you care to share it with us? What exactly was Mr. Tigre \"after\"?\n\n\n\nPresent Sports Paper or MC Bomber\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Glen was a programmer. A highly skilled programmer.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?\nGodot:\nIt's evidence... that Trite has no idea what he's doing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? What do you mean?\nGodot:\nYou're way off track, Trite. That evidence is irrelevant!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did he have the right to dish out penalties?)\nMaya:\nA-Are you alright, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Tigre needed one million dollars. Recovering a loan 100,000 dollars wasn't enough. (Besides, Elg had the means to make that kind of money if he wanted to.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright.\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nGlen was a programmer. A highly skilled programmer. That skill was the collateral Mr. Elg put up in order to borrow the money.\nGodot:\nCare to explain how skill can be used as collateral to secure a loan, Trite?\nPhoenix:\nHe had the skill to create a computer virus, and so he did. A virus known as \"MC Bomber\"!\nJudge:\nA \"computer virus\"? What does one of those do?\nPhoenix:\nA computer virus is a program that wreaks havoc on the insides of a computer.\nJudge:\nA \"computer\"? What does one of those do?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess the beard isn't the only part of His Honor that is from the stone age!) I'll explain it to you later, Your Honor. Right now, this is the important point... A virus like \"MC Bomber\" would be worth several million dollars on the black market. Mr. Tigre! You couldn't have cared less about the 100,000 dollars! Isn't that right? All you cared about was one thing! The virus!\nTigre:\nGrrr... Grrraaaaaaaaaaaargh!\nLeads to:\n\"On the day of the murder, Mr. Tigre's sole intention was to get his hands on this CD!\"Maya:\nSo The Tiger was meeting Glen Elg to get his money back. If Mr. Elg had just given him the lottery ticket, that would have been the end of it.Phoenix:\nYeah, so what's The Tiger's motive? (This is the big one. If I don't manage to undermine this testimony, it's all over for us.) Why would he have to poison Mr. Elg? And why did he loan him the money in the first place, when he knew he couldn't repay him?",

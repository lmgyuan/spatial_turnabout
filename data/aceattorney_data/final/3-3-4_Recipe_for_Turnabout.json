I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.\nI-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me!\nJudge:\nThe evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee.\nNo! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me?\nPayne:\nWell... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!?\nJudge:\nThis court finds the defendant...\nGuilty\nJudge:\nThe court is adjourned.\nJanuary 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nAhh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world!\nPhoenix:\nI bet it does, Maya.\nMaya:\nSo! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think?\nPhoenix:\nSure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake.\nMaya:\nNever! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game.\n???:\nHEY, PAL!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe...\nMaya:\nHappy New Year, Detective!\nGumshoe:\nUh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA...\nMaya:\nHere's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation!\nGumshoe:\nUm... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO...\nMaya:\nHave you got a holiday present for me, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nA what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but...\nMaya:\nYay! Thanks!\nGumshoe:\nLOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT!\nMaya:\nHey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you?\nGumshoe:\nAh... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose?\nMaya:\nHa ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year?\nGumshoe:\nVery funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it? A magazine?\nMaya:\nHey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\"\nPhoenix:\nTr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!?\nGumshoe:\nIt's a report, pal. About you!\nMaya:\nListen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\"\nGumshoe:\nWELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it!\nPhoenix:\nBut I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month.\nMaya:\nWhich makes it old news, you mean.\nPhoenix:\nBut I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December!\nMaya:\nHmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick?\nGumshoe:\nIf it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility...\nMaya:\nNo way. You don't mean...\nPhoenix:\nA pho...\nMaya:\nA phony Nick!?\nPhoenix:\n(This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...)\nMagazine Clipping added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nSO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean, what am I going to do about it?\nMaya:\nWell, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case!\nPhoenix:\nMy fault!? How do you figure that?\nMaya:\nBecause THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of...\nGumshoe:\nYeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves?\nPhoenix:\n(But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...)\nGumshoe:\nYou better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it?\nMaya:\nSounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto!\nPhoenix:\nI don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned.\nMaya:\n... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year.\nGumshoe:\nSo you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?)\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nMaya:\nIt's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like Gumshoe isn't around.\nMaya:\nHe's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work!\nPhoenix:\nNo, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case.\nMaya:\nGuess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh?\nPhoenix:\nAfter being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label...\nJanuary 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nThis is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...?\nPhoenix:\nK-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me!\n???:\nAaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying.\nPhoenix:\nA-Aren't... you...\n???:\nYes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down!\nMaya:\nAah! You're... Are you...?\n???\nDon't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde!\nPhoenix:\nMaggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt--\nByrde:\nOh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!?\nMaya:\nYou better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick.\nByrde:\nO-Oh... I see...\nPhoenix:\nSo that's where we stand right now.\nMaya:\nI'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder...\nByrde:\nMy whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures.\nPhoenix:\n(I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...)\nByrde:\nBut I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir!\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping:\nByrde:\nMr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial?\nPhoenix:\nProbably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial.\nByrde:\nUm... Mr. Wright...?\nPhoenix:\n?\nByrde:\nDo you think we'll win next time? ...Sir?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nByrde:\nMy life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck!\nMaya:\nArgh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!)\nMaya:\nWe'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you!\nByrde:\nThank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then!\nPhoenix:\nTrés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place.\nByrde:\nYes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi!\nMaya:\nSure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food!\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\nMaya:\nWow! Look at this place.\nPhoenix:\n\"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right?\nMaya:\nActually, I'm not all that into it...\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here.\nPhoenix:\nDon't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here!\nMaya:\nPerfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I suppose we can...)\nWright & Co.

You are la Phoenix Wright, non?\nPhoenix:\nUm, yes... You know me?\n???:\nMais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court!\nMaya:\nI guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already.\nMaya:\nI wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you?\nArmstrong:\nAllow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nUm, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there?\nArmstrong:\n... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves.\nMaya:\nHuh? \"'Im\"?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc.\nPhoenix:\nLa p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that?\nArmstrong:\nBehind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\".\nMaya:\nThank you!\nArmstrong:\nJe vous en prie, my dear!\nMaya:\nLet's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick!\nJanuary 6Vitamin Square\nMaya:\nSo this is Vitamin Square.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about?\nPhoenix:\nThat grouchy-looking grandpa?\nMaya:\nHe's throwing seeds out for the pigeons.\nPhoenix:\nMaya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them!\nOld Man:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...)\nDetention Center\nTrés Bien\nVitamin Square\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nLooks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later.\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nPoor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off.\nAfter presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation.\nGumshoe:\nWell, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe's really fired up about this...)\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh. ... Him.)\nGumshoe:\nNow, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes...?\nGumshoe:\nUm... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!?\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.:\nJanuary 6Trés Bien\nPhoenix:\nThe scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...)\n???:\nAh! Welcome! Bee avenue!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. What a cute voice.)\nMaya:\nOh, it's just you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya!\nMaya:\nWell? How do I look?\nPhoenix:\n... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium...\nMaya:\nMaybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer.\nPhoenix:\n(Then who was that woman I just saw?)\nMaya:\nOh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat!\nPhoenix:\n... I am kind of hungry, actually.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nUm... About the lunch...\nMaya:\nOh!

WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT!\nPhoenix:\nI don't need any of that!\nMaya:\nJust a moment, please, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya!\nMaya:\nSorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa!\nMaya:\nA dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette.

Urp!\nMaya:\nWell?\nPhoenix:\nAre you hungry, Maya?\nMaya:\nI'm starving!\nPhoenix:\nHere. It's yours.\nMaya:\nReally!? ... Urp!\nPhoenix:\nRemember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate!\nMaya:\n... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets!\nPhoenix:\nHey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!)\nTrés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nHow does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad?\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen?\nPhoenix:\n(The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.)\nAfter clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 6Trés BienKitchen\nMaya:\nAnd here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually.\nPhoenix:\n...

So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything?\nGumshoe:\nThey said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it.\nPhoenix:\n(I expected as much...)\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment.\nSports Paper refiled into the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\n\"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...)\nAfter examining table in Trés Bien - Kitchen:\nJanuary 6Vitamin Square\nPhoenix:\nHmm, the old guy's not here anymore. (Drat. And I still have some unanswered questions for him.)\nPhoenix:\nA scooter, huh? Who'd leave it right in the middle of the park like this? The wheel guard and the light are busted...

I can't take this!\nPhoenix:\n(Mia's really got this guy eating out of her hand...)\nKudo:\nHe steals things. From his customers.\nPhoenix:\nFrom his customers?\nKudo:\nGloves, handkerchiefs... Little things, mainly. He's a pilferer! So you be careful around him, my dear.\nMia:\nAre you sure about this?\nKudo:\nOf course! He was arrested for it once. I was there when it happened, having my javaccino.\nPhoenix:\n(He really is a regular!)\nKudo:\nLet me write you a little haiku about it.\nPhoenix:\nA haiku?\nKudo:\nA Japanese poem. It'll explain all you need to know about that chef.\nVictor's Note added to the Court Record.\nKudo:\nIf he takes anything again, you let me know! If it's not too expensive, I'll buy you a replacement!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor guy. He couldn't do enough for Mia.)\nMia:\nOK, Phoenix. That's about as much as I can do to help.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Mia.

Plus, no one came to the restaurant...\nArmstrong:\nOh là là! Mademoiselle Maya! Non! 'Ow can you leave like z'is!?\nMaya:\nI-I'm sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(That reminds me. Mr. Armstrong had a Psyche-Lock or three, didn't he? I'm going to have to break those...) Mr. Armstrong. I hope you won't mind, but I'd like to have another word with you...\nArmstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!\nArmstrong:\nI did not take it! La ticket for 'alf a million, I mean.\nMaya:\nBut you just told us you did! You said you took a ticket!\nArmstrong:\nMais non, ma fille! It was not...\n???:\nThat's enough.\nMaya:\nHuh? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr. Godot!\nPhoenix:\nWhat in the heck are you doing here!?\nGodot:\nUrgh! This is without doubt... the worst coffee I have ever tasted, Mr. Armstrong.\nPhoenix:\n(He came in here for coffee!? Does his craving for coffee know no bounds!?)\nGodot:\nPerhaps Mr. Armstrong stole one of the victim's tickets on the day in question.\nArmstrong:\nI am la air'ead, non? Just a pretty little girl who everyone is laughing at.\nMaya:\nBut, in that case, Maggey shouldn't be the only one under suspicion...\nGodot:\nHe had the wrong ticket.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\nGodot:\nMr. Armstrong made off with the winning ticket's pretty neighbor.\nMaya:\nSo... the ticket he took was worthless?\nGodot:\nNot quite. He did win something. A dollar.\nArmstrong:\nYou see! I am just a pretty face! W'izout my looks, I 'ave nothing!\nPhoenix:\nSo... What happened to the winning ticket, then? The one he meant to steal.\nGodot:\nIndeed. What did happen to it? I don't like spoiling myself by watching trailers, so... ...we'll just wait and see how the movie turns out tomorrow, won't we?\nMaya:\nNngh...\nArmstrong:\nVoilà! You two! Time to laugh at la pretty little air'ead!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I won't be needing this note anymore.)\nVictor's Note thrown into the trash.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like we've got a new mystery now.

And certainly not again.\nTo be continued.\n\nJanuary 7, 9:48 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nByrde:\nOh... I see... I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh?

And don't forget to eat well, OK?\nByrde:\nRoger!\nGumshoe:\nAnd you!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nGumshoe:\nYou'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!\nPhoenix:\n(I-I think he's serious!)\nMaya:\nHey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?\nGumshoe:\nYup.\nMaya:\nSo you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?\nByrde:\nReally? Can you, sir!?\nGumshoe:\nO... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?\nPhoenix:\nS-Sure.\nGumshoe:\nOK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?\nByrde:\nI can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective.

Aaah, bitter!\nJudge:\nMr... Um... Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nAaaah!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong!?\nJudge:\nNothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating.\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.\nJudge:\nI see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Our trusty\"...?)\nJudge:\nSo, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.\nPhoenix:\nBut I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!\nGodot:\nI wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.\nPhoenix:\n(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!)\nJudge:\nAs everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)\nJudge:\nNow then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.\nGodot:\nLet's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?\nGumshoe:\n...\nJudge:\nWitness! State your name for the court!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.\nGodot:\nOther way around, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!\nJudge:\nSince yesterday?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.\nMaya:\nI hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.\nJudge:\nI see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?\nGumshoe:\nY-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.\nJudge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.\nGlen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nUm... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.\nJudge:\nThe waitress being the accused?\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.\nJudge:\nHmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.\nTrés Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nCome, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.\nJudge:\nNow then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Yes, sir...\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Incident --\nGumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nGodot:\nUsing the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!\nJudge:\nThe facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nJudge:\nPlease, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?\nPhoenix:\nI already told you! That wasn't me!\nCross Examination\n-- The Incident --\nGumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nGumshoe:\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nGumshoe:\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nGumshoe:\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nGumshoe:\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.\nMaya:\nYou really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?\nPhoenix:\nTo be honest, I don't know.\nMaya:\nBut Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.)\nAfter selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements:\nJudge:\nThat's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.\nGodot:\nI like an old man who knows the score.\nJudge:\nThere is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!\nGodot:\nI don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.\nMaya:\nNot good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.\nGodot:\nI'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\n(He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)\nGodot:\nThis is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.\nMaya:\nWow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...\nPhoenix:\nTh-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?)\nGodot:\nHa...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.\nPhoenix:\nThe coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...\nGodot:\nOf course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.\nJudge:\nSomething else? I presume you mean...\nGodot:\nOf course. I'm referring to the pocket.\nPhoenix:\nThe... pocket?\nGodot:\nA search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!\nPhoenix:\nA bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.\nPhoenix:\nWHAAAT!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.\nApron added to the Court Record.\nPotassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nThere's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?\nGodot:\nBloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?\nJudge:\nDon't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!\nGodot:\nThat's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!\nPhoenix:\n(You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)\nGodot:\nWell, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?\nGumshoe:\nN-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.\nPhoenix:\nKetchup!?\nGumshoe:\nShe must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.\nJudge:\n... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!\nGodot:\nPull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!\nGumshoe:\nUnnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.\nJudge:\nHmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nThe motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.\nGodot:\nWell, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)\nJudge:\nWitness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Investigation --\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.\nJudge:\nHmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.\nGodot:\nLast chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nDon't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!\nCross Examination\n-- The Investigation --\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nGumshoe:\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nGumshoe:\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nGumshoe:\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nGumshoe:\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nGumshoe:\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.\nPhoenix:\nIf I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!\nMaya:\nGumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious.\nMaya:\nCome on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nOho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you?\nPhoenix:\nYou testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later?\nGumshoe:\nUm, no. They didn't.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim was given a prescription right before going to Trés Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!?\nGumshoe:\nY-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!\nJudge:\nI-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!?\nGumshoe:\nI, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that?\nGodot:\nHa...! That's all.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nRead for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological?\nJudge:\nJust what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nHardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say.\nJudge:\nA war wound?\nGodot:\nThe day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum.\nPhoenix:\nHe ruptured his eardrum!?\nJudge:\nThen what on earth was the prescription he was given?\nGodot:\nIt was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nIt's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear.\nJudge:\nYes. Here it is. In very, very fine print.\nGodot:\nIt seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication.\nPhoenix:\nUuurgh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all.\nPhoenix:\nN-No...\nMaya:\nNick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!\nPhoenix:\n(She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?)\nPhoenix:\nOnly moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!?\nGodot:\n...!\nJudge:\nBut the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThat doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nYou know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable!\nGodot:\nAaargh!\nJudge:\nThat's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call?\nGodot:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Godot...?\nGodot:\n...\nGumshoe:\nUm... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?)\nJudge:\nVery well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me.\nMaya:\nYay! Good job, Nick!\nJudge:\nThe court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness.\nGodot:\nHa...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups.\nJudge:\nCourt is adjourned for recess!\nJanuary 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nMaya:\nPhew! That was close!\nPhoenix:\nTell me about it... I nearly died in there!\nByrde:\nThat's my line, sir!\nMaya:\nNo! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit.\nByrde:\nLooks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!?\nMaya:\nHuh?\nByrde:\nHe said he'd help me. But he totally set me up!\nPhoenix:\nI don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right?\nByrde:\nIt's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)\nMaya:\nSo the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds!\nByrde:\nI bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know?\nMaya:\nYeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds!\nJanuary 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please.\nGodot:\nThe prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand.\nGodot:\nName and occupation, if you don't mind.\nKudo:\nThe name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too.\nPhoenix:\nWe don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation.\nKudo:\nMy occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!?\nPhoenix:\nKimono embroidery?\nKudo:\nThat's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed!\nMaya:\nWow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.\nKudo:\nAnyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile!\nPhoenix:\n(That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...)\nJudge:\nNow then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident?\nKudo:\nOh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino.\nJudge:\nSeeds?\nKudo:\nWhat do you think these are, hmm!?\nJudge:\nI-I see...\nGodot:\nSo you saw everything that happened, gramps?\nKudo:\nDid I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all!\nGodot:\nThen please, tell the court. We're all ears.\nKudo:\nSure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail!\nPhoenix:\n(He's really getting into this...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Witnessed --\nKudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress.\nKudo:\nKah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!?\nJudge:\nN-Newfangled?\nKudo:\nAll this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you!\nJudge:\nE-Excuse me...\nKudo:\nListen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away!\nJudge:\nWell, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Witnessed --\nKudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nKudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nKudo:\nThere's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\nKudo:\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nKudo:\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!\nKudo:\nThere was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\nKudo:\nThere wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\nMaya:\nDo you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it?\nPhoenix:\nWell, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there.\nMaya:\nBut he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress...\nPhoenix:\nI-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...)\nMaya:\nHey! Did I just say something clever?\nPhoenix:\nI wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey...\nMaya:\nThat's what we have to figure out, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\nKudo:\nKah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating.\nPhoenix:\nHave you ever seen this before?\nKudo:\nOf course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\n...\n.........\nKudo:\nWh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, \"you half-witted clot\", there's been an eerie silence in here.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the defendant on the day of the poisoning!\nKudo:\nUh?\nPhoenix:\nAnd as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before...\nKudo:\nEr...\nPhoenix:\nYes, you know what I'm getting at! You couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front!\nKudo:\n... Oops!\nJudge:\nWitness! You can't just \"oops\" your way out of this!\nGodot:\nHa...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands.\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nListen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was only one waitress in the restaurant.\nJudge:\nThat being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde?\nGodot:\nExactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching!\nJudge:\nHmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing.\nGodot:\nJust tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps.\nKudo:\nYou can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted!\nMaya:\nHe can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out...\nJudge:\nVery well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim.\nWitness Testimony\n-- About the Victim --\nKudo:\nHe was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.\nHe had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!\nThe young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.\nThen the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.\nThe little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.\nJudge:\nThe testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail.\nKudo:\nOh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything!\nMaya:\nHow are we going to handle this, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWe only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot.\nMaya:\nJust trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel?\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose... But it's what I do best.)\nCross Examination\n-- About the Victim --\nKudo:\nHe was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.\nKudo:\nHe had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!\nKudo:\nThe young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.\nKudo:\nThen the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.\nKudo:\nThe little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.\nPhoenix:\n(The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.)\nMaya:\nI guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!)\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory?\nKudo:\nI know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song!\nGodot:\nCare to tell us where this is going, Trite?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his left.\nKudo:\nKah! What is this? Kindergarten?\nPhoenix:\nBut I would like the court to please take a look at this.\nJudge:\nThat's the cup victim used, correct?\nPhoenix:\nYes, and on the rim, you'll notice the mark left by the victim's lips.\nJudge:\nYes. There is a stain left by the coffee.\nPhoenix:\nIf you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his right hand!\nKudo:\nBut how...?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song!\nKudo:\nAaaargh!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from.\nKudo:\nWAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw!\nJudge:\nY-You still insist on your testimony?\nKudo:\nThat young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault!\nPhoenix:\n(Who, me!?)\nJudge:\nTh-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already.\nKudo:\nDon't call me \"old man\", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but...\nGodot:\nSure, why not hear a little more?\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\nBut this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand.\nKudo:\nThank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Left Hand or Right Hand --\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\nHe kept fiddling with it all the time.\nHe was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\nJudge:\nWe know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye.\nGodot:\nIt wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers.\nJudge:\nA monitor? You mean, like a television screen!?\nGodot:\nThe inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work.\nKudo:\nHDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth!\nPhoenix:\n(It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.)\nKudo:\nAnd those are the facts, in good old black and white!\nCross Examination\n-- Left Hand or Right Hand --\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\nKudo:\nHe kept fiddling with it all the time.\nKudo:\nHe was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? What do you think?\nPhoenix:\nI think the guy's telling the truth. But even so... Something's not quite right.\nMaya:\nThen chuck evidence at him until he breaks!\nPhoenix:\n(But if he's not lying, there wouldn't be any contradictions in his testimony, right?)\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but... Mr. Kudo! There is something very strange about your observations of the victim.\nKudo:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nYou say he was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the HMD.\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting.\nPhoenix:\nI don't think so.\nKudo:\nWh-What did you say!?\nPhoenix:\nYou're no doubt unaware of this fact, Mr. Kudo. But the victim couldn't hear with his left ear! His eardrum was ruptured!\nKudo:\nEh?\nPhoenix:\nTraces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear!\nKudo:\n... Is that true, Captain?\nGodot:\n...It is.\nKudo:\n...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm...\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!\nPhoenix:\nThis witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!?\nGodot:\nAaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk!\nKudo:\nCaptain! Are you calling me a drip!?\nJudge:\nThis is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his right hand!\nKudo:\nI'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his left hand!\nGodot:\nLet me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nImpossible! The witness has already testified on numerous occasions... ...that the victim died immediately after taking just one sip of the coffee.\nGodot:\nGodot:\nWhich hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless!\nGodot:\nPuuuurgh!\nJudge:\nI believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce!\nKudo:\nD-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned!\n???:\nKudo:\nWAAAAIT! If we stop now, where does that leave me?\nJudge:\nLeave you, Mr. Kudo?\nKudo:\nThanks to that blue-suited young upstart over there... ...I'm just a bumbling old man who can't even dot his t's or cross his i's now!\nPhoenix:\n(How is your bad memory my fault!?)\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do.\nKudo:\nI've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know!\nGodot:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nThere's more?\nKudo:\nTo be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark!\nPhoenix:\nM-Me? (He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...)\nKudo:\nWell, everyone? What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook!\nGodot:\nSorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee.\nKudo:\nWhat have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the javaccino you want if you come to my house after the trial. (Changed from [I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial.] in the original release) I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man!\nJudge:\nThat's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony.\nKudo:\nYou bet! Much, much quicker!\nMaya:\nI can't believe this is happening...\nKudo:\nHa ha ha! You better get ready, youngster!\nPhoenix:\nI get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!? (He's gotta be using some sort of infinite ammo code with that box of seeds...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Final Showdown --\nKudo:\nFirst of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself.\nThe young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino...\nWell, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over.\nIt broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!\nWell!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?\nJudge:\n... Um... Is that all?\nKudo:\nYes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!?\nJudge:\nN-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo.\nMaya:\nDon't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. \"So what?\" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy!\nKudo:\nYou're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of!\nJudge:\nVery well... Mr. Wright. Your final cross-examination, please.\nCross Examination\n-- The Final Showdown --\nKudo:\nFirst of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself.\nKudo:\nThe young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino...\nKudo:\nWell, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over.\nKudo:\nIt broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!\nKudo:\nWell!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?\nPhoenix:\nHe's really giving you the evil eye, Maya.\nMaya:\nIt's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, \"I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!\"\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to rise to the challenge then...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\nKudo:\nHmph! So what?\nPhoenix:\nLook carefully at the table. The vase is there... intact!\nKudo:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nLost your tongue, granddad?\nKudo:\n... I'm no granddad of yours, hop scotch!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow!\nJudge:\nEnough! If you throw any more seeds in this courtroom, the cleaners will be here all night.\nKudo:\nAaaaaah!\nJudge:\n... What is it now?\nKudo:\nI just remembered something!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes...? Go on...\nKudo:\nThe broken vase... Ha ha! It was on my table!\nPhoenix:\nWha...?\nKudo:\nAh, well... You see... It startled me when that young lad collapsed. So I stood up. That must've been when it fell over. The vase on my table, I mean.\nJudge:\nThe vase on your table?\nKudo:\nAh ha ha! Yes, it was on my table! And that's how my groin came to be completely soaked.\n.........\nJudge:\n*sigh* Thank you, Mr. Kudo. You've certainly earned your kudos for today.\nKudo:\nEr, I'd like to ask a question now. Have I, er... Have I been any use at all?\nJudge:\nPerhaps that's something you should reflect on yourself, Mr. Kudo.\nKudo:\nAaaargh! WAIT! WAIT A MINUTE! If that's the case, there's more! I've got more to say! Oh, yes! I remember something else...\nJudge:\nBailiff! Escort the witness out of the courtroom!\nKudo:\nWAAAIT! LISTEN TO MEEEEEE!\nJudge:\nWell! We seem to have been considerably sidetracked. And I am still not in a position to deliver a verdict.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nJudge:\nThe defendant has not been positively identified as the waitress in question. Additionally, there are two disparities in the testimony we have heard thus far.\nPhoenix:\nThe mark on the coffee cup that the victim supposedly drank from with his left hand. And the earpiece which was inserted into his left ear, out of which he couldn't hear.\nMaya:\nWow, Nick! You did it!\nJudge:\nI therefore require both the defense and the prosecution to further investigate the facts.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nGodot:\n...\nJudge:\nThere is one more thing before I call today's session to an end.\nPhoenix:\nO-One more thing, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nThe witness we just heard from... He is most insistent that his testimony should be of use. So he's summarized it accordingly into this statement.\nPhoenix:\nUm... OK...\nJudge:\nYou may each have a copy of it, if you wish.\nGodot:\nWhatever. The prosecution doesn't need props like that.\nMaya:\nGodot's really mad, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I would be, too.\nJudge:\nVery well. Here you are then, Mr. Wright. There are 3 copies. My own, yours, and Mr. Godot's.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nVictor's Testimony added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(\"I'm sorry\"? This isn't a piece of testimony! More like a five year old's apology...)\nMaya:\nWhat the heck are we supposed to do with 3 copies...?\nJudge:\nThat is all. This court is adjourned!\nTo be continued.\n\nJanuary 7, 12:52 PMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nSo how do you think the trial went this morning?\nPhoenix:\nHow do you think it went!?\nMaya:\nIt got a bit crazy in there. I just wonder if that killed our chances.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I guess it did get out of hand. Mr. Kudo's testimony did nothing to help us. Plus, now we don't even know the identity of the waitress who laced the coffee.\nMaya:\nAll we know is what old Mr. Kudo saw... The apron straps, and the ribbon.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that the victim was wearing an earpiece when his eardrum was ruptured.\nMaya:\nTalk about a terrifying case of contradictionitus.\nPhoenix:\nTime to play doctor and find ourselves a cure then, huh?\nMaya:\nYeah, we've gotta find one for Maggey, or she's going to have a terminal case of guilty!\nJanuary 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nMaya:\nLooks like Gumshoe's not here.\nPhoenix:\nNever mind that. What's going on? It feels different in here somehow...\nMaya:\nYou think?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Everyone seems to be on edge.\nDetective:\nWhat are you doing!? Call in the officers for the briefing, quick! Can't you shut down the station's server? Chief! Quit playing on the Internet!\nChief:\nBut my e-mail pen pal, 1337aZnPrInceSz!\nDetective:\nSave it for later! I'm turning it off NOW!\nChief:\nNoooo! 1337aZnPrInceeeeeSz!!\nMaya:\nEveryone's keeping busy in here, huh?\nPhoenix:\nKeeping busy? More like panicking, if you ask me. (Something's going on. Something big...)\nJanuary 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\nI guess Maggey's still in questioning.\nMaya:\nBut! But we've got questions to ask her, too! Magg-ey! Magg-ey!\nPhoenix:\nKeep it down, Maya! This isn't a playground, you know!\nJanuary 7Trés Bien\nMaya:\nEmpty, as usual.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and it's lunchtime, too.\n???:\nThat's it! Come on, come on, come on!\nPhoenixTender Lender:\nHey, that sounds like...\nGumshoe:\nNow just call an \"8\", pal! Come on! I know you can!\nMaya:\nHe's getting really worked up about something.\nGumshoe:\nNoooooo! That's the wrong number! Argh! Look like an \"8\" would have only netted me five bucks anyway! What a rip off!\nMaya:\nWhat's the problem, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? Oh, it's you... I, uh... I was uh... Hah hah! I was just... Hah hah hah! I was just listening to the radio, pal.\nPhoenix:\nTo the radio?\nMaya:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe's having lunch here!\nPhoenix:\n(He is! And he's having the Twin-T set...)\nGumshoe:\nAha ha ha... What can I say...?\nJanuary 7Vitamin Square\nMaya:\nHmm... I don't see any sign of Mr. Kudo. Do you?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he went to buy another ton of bird seeds. I was kind of hoping he wouldn't be here, anyway. At least, not for now. (Besides, any more seeds today and I'm liable to turn into a real phoenix!)\nJanuary 7Trés BienKitchen\nMaya:\nHuh? Mr. Armstrong's talking to someone.\n???:\nI'll be back next month.\nArmstrong:\nOui! Naturellement! I will be waiting for you!\n???:\nIf you haven't got it by then, I'm afraid it might get a little... hot... around here.\nArmstrong:\nNon! I will 'ave everything ready, I promise!\n???:\nI love fire, you know... I love the way it crackles... Hee... Hee... Hee...\nArmstrong:\nNon, non, non! Stop it! I beg you!\n???:\nThen don't let me down... I'll be watching you...\nArmstrong:\nMais, non! Z'is is not necessary! You can trust me, mademoiselle!\n???:\nTalk to anyone... and I'll drive a knife... right through your heart.\nArmstrong:\nOh, non! You do not 'ave to worry. You know, you worry far too much. Maybe z'is will 'elp you relax. It is la oil of sandalwood.\n???:\nI do love... raw meat... from time to time... Hee... Hee... Hee...\nArmstrong:\nAaaaah!\n???:\nI'll be taking my leave... Goodbye... for now!\nArmstrong:\nUrgh! I 'ave la shivers! I must rub some of my oil all over my body before I become z'e nervous wreck! Z'ere. Oh, oui, oui! Z'at feels good!\nPhoenix:\nUrgh!\nArmstrong:\nOh là là! Excusez-moi, monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nM-My eyes! My EYES!\nArmstrong:\nYour eyes? If you 'ave trouble wi'z your eyes, you need z'is. La oil of sandalwood!\nPhoenix:\nIsn't this just the leftovers of what you were just using!?\nAfter presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien:\nJanuary 7Blue Screens, Inc.\nMaya:\nWow! This place is so hi-tech! You can almost smell the electricity in the air!\nPhoenix:\nIt is a computer firm, Maya. They can't work without electricity, you know.\n???:\nWho are you?\nMaya:\nOh, umm... Hello...\n???:\nI'm sorry. Access is restricted to authorized personnel only. This is a computer programming laboratory. There are far too many trade secrets that could be leaked.\nMaya:\nWow! What secrets!?\n???:\nEverything you see here is classified. No information can leave this building.\nMaya:\nUnderstood!\nPhoenix:\n(Who is this woman? She's like a robot from some kind of whacked edumacational show...)\nBasil:\nMy name is Lisa Basil. I'm the company director.\nPhoenix:\nD-Director!? (Sh-She's human!? She seems more like a ghost in a shell. And that thing over her eye... Isn't that the same device as Glen Elg's?)\nMaya:\nThat's an [sic] DMH, right?\nPhoenix:\nNice try, but it's the other way around, Maya. It's an HMD.\nBasil:\nAll of my programmers here at Blue Screens, Inc. are supplied with HMDs.\nMaya:\nThen do you write programs, too?\nBasil:\nNo. I just enjoy wearing this.\nMaya:\nThey ARE pretty cool! I wouldn't mind one!\nTrés Bien\nTrés Bien (after breaking Psyche-Lock, then clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile in Trés Bien, and clearing \"Tender Lender\" Talk option in Trés Bien - Kitchen)\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'm gonna head back to the precinct now. We've got a big meeting starting in a bit.\nMaya:\nAbout Maggey's case, you mean?\nGumshoe:\nNo, that's pretty much wrapped up now... There's another big case going down at the moment, so she's been pushed aside...\nMaya:\nOK. Well, see you later then.\nGumshoe:\nBye!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\n......\nPhoenix:\n......... Y-You better get going, Detective, or you'll be late.\nGumshoe:\nActually, I, um... I've kinda got a favor to ask. It's a big one!\nPhoenix:\nA favor?\nGumshoe:\nYeah... It's for, um... Maggey, actually. I was kinda hoping... you'd give this to her for me.\nMaya:\nWhat is it?\nGumshoe:\nIt's a lunchbox. I got up early so I could make it. I've been real worried about her. She looked like she'd lost a lot of weight.\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe... ... How many weenies are in here!? There's not a person on earth who could down this much meat.\nGumshoe:\nYou think? I love weenies. I can't get enough of their tender juiciness. So will you give to her? It took me ages to make, so please say you will, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't exactly say no, can I?)\nGumshoe's Lunchbox given to Maya to carry.\nMaya:\nMaybe I'll eat it myself if I get hungry!\nGumshoe:\nDon't forget, OK? I'm counting on you to give that to Maggey.\nPhoenix:\n(He's finally gone...)\nJanuary 7Tender Lender\nMaya:\n...This place gives off a really strange vibe, doesn't it?\nPhoenix:\nLooks like \"The Tiger\" isn't in his lair. (And that is, as they say, a very good thing.)\n???:\n...Welcome...\nPhoenix:\n*gulp* (Talk about a creepy voice! It makes your soul want to shrivel up and die!)\n???:\nYou're here... to discuss a loan...?\nPhoenix:\nUh, no. Not exactly...\n???:\nThe manager is away at the moment... Wait quietly... please...\nMaya:\nShe's gone! Just like that!\nPhoenix:\nI guess we'll just have to come back another time.\nMaya:\nBut this is the perfect opportunity, Nick! This place reeks of suspicion! Come on, Nick! Let's take a look around, OK?\nPhoenix:\nDo you think it'd be OK...?\nMaya:\nOf course! No one will ever know...\n???:\n...Coffee...?\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaah!\n???:\nI'll leave it here for you to enjoy... Quietly.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes! Thank you!\n???:\nDo not touch the desk... Please...\nMaya:\nN-N-Nick! Let's g-get out of here!\nPhoenix:\n(NOW she wants to get out of here...)\nAfter examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes:\n???:\nGwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\n(Come out from under the desk, Maya!)\nThe Tiger:\nWhad are youse two snoopin' around in my office for!?\nPhoenix:\nN-Nothing.

I'm gonna flatten youse two into pancakes and turn youse into my new rugs!\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaah!\n???:\n...Oh... Don Tigre... You're back...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack... That voice... It's like evil seeping into your head through your ears...)\n???:\n...I'm sorry... Don Tigre... I knocked over that ashtray before... and...\nPhoenix:\n(Eek! Has she got a death wish or what!?)\nThe Tiger:\n... Oh, right.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nThe Tiger:\nF-Forget about it, Violetta. I-It's noddin'...\nPhoenix:\n(What, what, what!?)\nThe Tiger:\nI ain't gonna get mad at you. You' too cute, you hear!\nPhoenix:\n(That's so unfair!)\n???:\nHere... Have some cookies... I just baked them... And you'll need some strong espresso... while you're discussing your loan...\nThe Tiger:\nGwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaar! Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes!?\nThe Tiger:\nYouse either crazy or just plain stupid to chase after me! I worked so hard, but now youse gotta come and mess up my plan...\nPhoenix:\n(So it was him... He's my phony...)\nThe Tiger:\nHeh, but I don't care. No one gets in my way!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What? I mean, e-excuse me?\nThe Tiger:\nHeh heh heh! Youse shoulda left de little girl at home, Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm...

P-Please!\nMaya:\n...That was pretty weak, Nick. You waited until he was out of earshot before you shouted after him.\nPhoenix:\n(Like you're one to talk! I didn't hear you scream, \"Hold it!\" either!)\n???:\n...The espresso...\nMaya:\nAaaaaaaah!\n???:\n...And cookies...\nPhoenix:\n(This woman is definitely not good for my heart. Now, what was it The Tiger called her...? \"Violetta\"?)\nJanuary 7Vitamin Square\nMaya:\nThere he is! Old Seedy's back feeding the pigeons again!\nKudo:\nThere! Take this! And this! And get out of my park!\nPhoenix:\nLike I thought, he's really mad... Come on, Maya. Just keep your head down and let's sneak away while we still can...\nMaya:\nWhat? Why? Hellooo, old man!\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you doing, Maya!?\nKudo:\nHuh!? ...Kah!\nMaya:\nHey, he just turned his back on us!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not surprised. I bet I really hurt his pride in court this morning.\nMaya:\nHey, Mr. Kudo!\nKudo:\nHmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Hmm, pi-pi-pigeon, hmm... Kah!\nMaya:\nLook, we really need to talk to you, alright?\nKudo:\nOut with the demons! In with good fortune!\nMaya:\nOw! Ow! Ow! Seeds... Shell splinters... Painful...\nPhoenix:\nI always knew you were a demon, Maya!\nAfter clearing \"The \"errand\"\" Talk option in Vitamin Square:\nJanuary 7Trés BienKitchen\nMaya:\nLooks like Mr. Armstrong's out again.\nPhoenix:\nBut the place is open for business... You can't have an open restaurant without a chef!\nMaya:\nHey! It's not my fault, Nick! Don't take it out on me!\nPhoenix:\n(Only a couple of minutes after the incident happened... Mr. Kudo left the scene, leaving Mr. Armstrong here alone.)\nMaya:\nArgh... Missing when we need to talk to him the most.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe he's trying to avoid us on purpose?)\nAfter breaking Psyche-Lock, clearing \"The radio\" Talk option, and presenting Glen Elg profile at Trés Bien:\nJanuary 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nByrde:\nOh, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nHello, Maggey. So they finished questioning you?\nByrde:\nWasn't it just unbelievable in court today, sir!? I'm going to stay up all night and blog about everything that happened!\nMaya:\nWeren't you scared? It was pretty touch and go in there.\nByrde:\nYeah, but you totally nailed that old man!\nPhoenix:\nWell, he was all over the place with his testimony.\nByrde:\nHe's not the only one!\nMaya:\nHuh? What do you mean?\nByrde:\nEveryone else's testimonies don't match up either. Not with what I remember of the incident, anyway...\nPhoenix:\n(Is it possible she is the one misremembering things...?)\nAfter examining CD player, spilled ashtray, and hanging clothes in Tender Lender, and clearing \"Victor's testimony\" Talk option and presenting Gumshoe's Lunchbox in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nJanuary 7Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.\nDetective:\nThe main server just went up in smoke! Why the heck isn't the press conference set up yet!? The Superintendent's here already!\nChief:\nYeah.

I'm catching up on my Asian soap operas!\nDetective:\nIt's gonna have to wait, Chief. I'm throwing the switch!\nChief:\nNooo! Just when Sum Yung-Gai was about to confess to his son's hot-to-trot girlfriend!\nMaya:\nWow! This place is really buzzing.\nPhoenix:\nSomething must be going down. Something really big.\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? What are you doing here, pal?\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nYou can't be here right now. You'll be roped into the briefing if you stay.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nWe've got big problems here today.\nMaya:\nWhy? What's going on?\nGumshoe:\nIt's a virus! A virus!!\nPhoenix:\n(A virus?)\nGumshoe:\nThere's a virus ripping through the precinct's computer system.\nPhoenix:\n(But I really need to ask you some questions...)\nAfter clearing \"MC Bomber\" and \"The Cadaverinis\" Talk options:\nGumshoe:\nAaaaargh! I can't believe it! I almost forgot the most important thing!\nPhoenix:\nA-And that is...?\nGumshoe:\nYou know, the lunchbox! How did everything go!?\nPhoenix:\nL-Lunchbox?\nMaya:\nYou remember. The weenies...?\nByrde:\nI hate weenies!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah... Those weenies.)\nGumshoe:\nSo? How did my weenies taste when they went down the hatch?\nMaya:\nHuh? Um... Well... It was... delicious!\nGumshoe:\nYeah? That's what she said? Really!?\nMaya:\nUmm... Well... Not exactly...\nGumshoe:\nDon't worry about it, pal. I figured something would happen, so I came prepared.\nPhoenix:\nPrepared? What do you mean...?\nGumshoe:\nI made a jumbo lunchbox!\nMaya:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nDo me a favor again, huh, pal, and deliver this?\nPhoenix:\n(This sure is a heavy burden... In more ways than one...)\nGumshoe:\nI can just imagine Maggey's little eyes sparkling with joy when you bring her that!\nMaya:\n...Weenies, again, Nick?

I wanted to trust what Don Tigre said... He said it had nothing to do with my grandfather being Bruto Cadaverini... I wanted to believe he helped me because he cared about me. Not about my grandfather... But I knew... That wasn't really true...\nMaya:\nWow. I'm so sorry.\nViola:\nWhat he did to get the money was... It was... evil!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nViola:\nHe said it was all for me... So I... I helped him...\nMaya:\nYou helped him? In what way?\nViola:\nHere... Take these...\nPhoenix:\n(What are these? Medical papers?)\nViola:\nI'm Bruto Cadaverini's granddaughter... He had to pay compensation... He was made an offer... He simply... couldn't... refuse.\nViola's Medical Papers added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\nWow, I feel so bad for Viola.\nPhoenix:\nIt's inexcusable!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\n(There are two things that I consider inexcusable. Poisoning, and betrayal! Only a coward would hurt people using either of these tactics.)\nMaya:\nIs everything alright, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWe should get going. Right after we finish our espresso.\nMaya:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\n(I wouldn't need to convince Viola of anything else, so I guess I can get rid of this.)\nRepair Bill thrown into the trash.\nAfter clearing \"Risky extra work\" Talk option in Blue Screens, Inc. and clearing \"Compensation\" Talk option in Tender Lender:\nJanuary 7Trés Bien\nArmstrong:\nEh, bonjour!

Yesterday's session didn't go so well, and then ended on a giant mystery.Phoenix:\n(That's true... And we still haven't solved a single part of it yet...)Maya:\nAre you OK, Nick?Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, uh... Yeah. Of course.Byrde:\nI saw that! That little flash of doubt in your eyes!Phoenix:\nN-No! That wasn't doubt. That was, umm... determination!Byrde:\nWhy don't I believe you...?Maya:\nIt's nearly time, Maggey. You'd better get going to the defendant's seat.Byrde:\nRoger. Don't let me down, Mr. Wright. I'm counting on you!Hey, pal!Phoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe...Gumshoe:\nQuit stressing Maggey out! She doesn't need that!Phoenix:\nH-How did you know she was stressed...?Gumshoe:\nI was watching through the doorway.Phoenix:\nOh...Gumshoe:\nYou look like you lost the case already. Show a bit of confidence, will you, pal!? Here, maybe this'll help.Maya:\nHuh!? Have you taken up aromatherapy, too?Gumshoe:\nNot in a million years, pal! Don't tell me that you don't remember this thing?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Come to think of it, that doesn't look like one of those aromatherapy bottles...)Gumshoe:\nThis is the small bottle that turned up in Tres Bien's kitchen a couple of days ago.Maya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!Phoenix:\nOh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...Maya:\nHey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.Phoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.Maya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn't smell.Gumshoe:\nWe finally got the analysis results back from the lab.Maya:\nSo!? What is it? Is it the poison?Gumshoe:\nI'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.Maya:\nMedication?Gumshoe:\nYeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.Phoenix:\nFor ears? You mean...?Gumshoe:\nYeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!Phoenix:\n(What was Glen Elg's ear medicine doing in the kitchen...?)Small Bottle refiled into the Court Record.Phoenix:\nUm, what about the unidentified fingerprints? Anything on that?Gumshoe:\nSomeone screwed up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... That's going to weaken its impact as a piece of evidence...)Gumshoe:\nOK, pal! This is it! Make sure your defense is impregnable today, got it!?Phoenix:\n(Today's trial... I'm gonna expose that guy for what he's done, or my name isn't Phoenix Wright!)January 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\nReady and waiting as always, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery good. Then we'll get underway at once. Yesterday we heard the testimony of Mr. Victor Kudo. He claims to have witnessed the defendant putting a powder into the victim's coffee. However, the witness's testimony was plagued with a number of problems.Godot:\nThe mark on the rim of the cup shows that the victim drank from it with his right hand. But according to the old man's testimony, he picked it up with his left hand.Judge:\nThank you, Mr. Godot. Furthermore, according to the witness's account... ...the victim was listening to the radio with an earpiece in his left ear. Yet, the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, which made him effectively deaf in that ear.Maya:\nIt's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?Godot:\nHa...! Allow me to enlighten you, Your Honor. The world, you see, keeps turning, and we must turn with it.Judge:\n... You've lost me already, Mr. Godot.Godot:\nDon't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today. Only losers think like that. You've got to change with the times! That's one of my rules!Judge:\nAre you implying that you've resolved these contradictions? You know the answers to these riddles!?Godot:\nThe old guy wasn't just throwing seed in here. He was throwing us off the scent. And today I'll prove it.Judge:\nVery well. Let the first witness take the stand!Godot:\nAnd you are?Armstrong:\nOh bonjour, everyone! I am Jean Armstrong. z'e owner and 'ead chef of la Tres Bien restaurant. Enchant\u00e9!.........Judge:\nForgive me for asking, witness, but... are you a woman?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0, monsieur! As you can see, I am la pert and perky gentleman, non?Judge:\nEr... Umm...Godot:\nOn the day of the incident, you were in Tres Bien's kitchen. Isn't that right?Armstrong:\nW'iz you monsieur...Godot:\n...?Armstrong:\n...everything feels right!Godot:\nHa...!Phoenix:\n(Wow, he's totally unfazed! Doesn't anything intimidate this guy...?)Judge:\nVery well. Your testimony please, witness. Please tell the court what happened that day at Tres Bien.Armstrong:\nOui! Volontiers!Witness Testimony-- At Tres Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Phoenix:\nA m...m...m... MIRROR!?Armstrong:\nOui! Un grand mirror! La most enormous mirror!Godot:\nAnd suddenly, the mystery disappears! Like I said, the world keeps turning, so roll with it!Judge:\nHmm... That would explain the coffee cup and the earpiece conundrum... The mirror would have made everything appear back to front.Phoenix:\n(What the heck!? It's way too early in the morning for this to be happening to me!)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination",

Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNormally, I'd expect people to know the difference between a reflection and a real object.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\n\"Normally\"? How does normality come into this? That's lame, Trite. Even for you.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nAre you trying to say that if something isn't normal, it isn't possible? Is that it? Where does that leave the porcu-headed lawyer and the topknot chick over there... and the ungodly cool guy with the mask over here? Well, Trite!?\nPhoenix:\nAaack! Not the hair!\nMaya:\nI do not have a topknot!\nJudge:\nMr. Godot is correct. A lack of normality is no basis for discounting an argument.\nArmstrong:\nBien! Logic 'as won la day!Armstrong:\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nEverything? He would have seen everything in reverse?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... We should take a sec and think about what Old Seedy said in his testimony...\nPhoenix:\n(How did he phrase it again...?)\n\n\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\n\n\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!\n\n\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\n\n\nMaya:\nIf he saw everything he described reflected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the \"left\" was actually on the \"right\", huh.\nPhoenix:\n(And that clears up all the problems with his testimony, I guess... Or does it...?)\nGodot:\nHa...!Present Glen Elg profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD...\"Phoenix:\n(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?Phoenix:\nIf he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.Maya:\nBut that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!Phoenix:\nThe coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD... Let's think back over Mr. Kudo's testimony for a second, shall we?Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.Kudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!Phoenix:\nSo, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's left side. Now, if Mr. Kudo saw all that as a reflection in a mirror... ...it means both the HMD and the earpiece were actually on the victim's right side.Armstrong:\nExactement! You see, monsieur. Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his right eye.Godot:Godot:\n...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.Phoenix:\nA-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?Godot:\nYou don't understand the way the witness thinks.Judge:\nHow he thinks?Godot:\nYou remember this, I presume?Phoenix:\nThe \"I broke the vase... sorry\" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?Godot:\nExactly. The old man has one very grievous habit... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more muddled his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?Judge:\nClearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.Godot:\nAnd that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. \"I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!\" Ha...! Well, Trite?Phoenix:\nUrk... (That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)Maya:\nWow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!Judge:\nEnough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.Maya:\nBad luck, Nick. Looks like the \"boil\" of a contradiction you found is just a \"rash\".Godot:\nA mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.Armstrong:\nOui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.Witness Testimony-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nAlors. Is everyone sitting comfortably?\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Judge:\nHmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.Armstrong:\nWhat a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!Godot:\nDon't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.Phoenix:\n(Argh! I hate that guy!)Judge:\nYou said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?Armstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross Examination",

I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.Phoenix:\nThen the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Tres Bien that day. (Now I've just got to prove it... Somehow...)Phoenix:\nThere is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony. Mr. Kudo broke the vase that was on the table where he was sitting. And yet! As the court can see, there is an unbroken vase on the table next to the victim! Why? Because Mr. Kudo was not, in fact, sitting at the table next to the victim at all!Godot:Godot:\nDon't be an idiot, Trite! That's impossible! That seat's the only one Kudo could've seen the victim's reflection from!Phoenix:\nExactly!Godot:\n...!Phoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion we can draw from this contradiction. There was no mirror in Tres Bien that day! Your testimony, Mr. Armstrong, is an elaborate lie!Armstrong:\nMon dieeeeeeeu!Godot:Godot:\nDon't try to confuse the court, Trite! Obviously, the witness cleaned up the vase... ...while the police were taking their time getting to the crime scene!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Godot, that doesn't quite work for me. Mr. Armstrong already testified to the contrary. In his own words... \"I did not touch anything else\" except the mirror!Godot:\nUr... urgh! ... Gaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nWell, witness? What do you have to say for yourself?Armstrong:\n*sniffle*Phoenix:\n(I was right! There was no mirror in the restaurant that day!)Judge:\nIn light of this revelation, we return back to the original problem. Why did the victim have an earpiece in an ear in which he couldn't hear?Godot:\nHa...! You only get one shot in life. There's no turning back. If you want to claim that the mirror wasn't there, Trite... ...then this problem is all yours. How do you explain what the old man saw?Phoenix:\n(If I can answer this, then I'll be that much closer to the truth! I can feel it!)Maya:\n...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?Phoenix:\nThere's more than just this one contradiction, Maya.Maya:\nWhat do you mean?Phoenix:\nRemember what Maggey told us? \"There was another man at the victim's table.\" And, \"there was a sample CD on the victim's table.\" It all flies in the face of Mr. Kudo's testimony. (And I think I know the reason why nothing in this case is adding up.)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Let's hear your answer.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The reason behind all the contradictions in Mr. Kudo's testimony is simple.Mr. Kudo made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, Mr. Kudo made a mistake!\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... You're the one who brought up all these contradictions.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nGodot:\nIf you're trying to tell us the old man just made a mistake... ...we can wrap up this case right now with a guilty verdict!\nJudge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? Should I just declare your client guilty?\nMaya:\nIs that the best you can come up with, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The ear doctor made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe we're looking at this the wrong way. It was actually the doctor's mistake.\nJudge:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The doctor got the wrong ear!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWell, I believe we saw an autopsy report yesterday. One that stated the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, and had medicine in it!\nJudge:\nI'm beginning to wonder if it's not your eardrum that's ruptured, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be playing with people's perceptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The victim was a phony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This case is riddled with contradictions.\"Phoenix:\nThis case is riddled with contradictions. Yet, there is one very simple answer that clears them all up.Judge:\nA-And what is that?Phoenix:\nThe incident Mr. Kudo witnessed, and the incident the victim experienced... ...were two completely different events!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nYes! The \"victim\" that Mr. Kudo saw wasn't Mr. Glen Elg at all! It was an imposter -- a phony pretending to be Mr. Elg! Obviously, unlike the victim, there was nothing wrong with the imposter's left eardrum. That's how he ended up wearing the earpiece in his left ear by mistake!Godot:\nPhwoooooooh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Settle down, or I'll clear the courtroom!Godot:\nQuiet, gramps! Why don't you clear out of here, huh?Judge:\nWHAT DID YOU SAY!?Godot:\nTrite... Are you saying what Mr. Kudo saw was a set-up?Phoenix:\nYes. Someone pretended to be Glen Elg and acted out the whole coffee poisoning. All for the express purpose of creating a \"witness\" out of one Mr. Victor Kudo!Godot:Godot:\nGet real, Trite! Why would anyone want to do that?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious? The thing Mr. Kudo was most insistent about in his testimony was...Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nI-It's so hard to believe, but...Phoenix:\nThere was one, and only one reason to show Mr. Kudo this fake poisoning! To show Maggey Byrde in the act of poisoning the coffee!Godot:Godot:\nAre you insinuating that the waitress in the old man's story was a fake as well? It's true that there were no customers in the restaurant at the time, but... ...it's also true that the chef was there! He would have noticed what was happening.Judge:\nTh-That's right! Well, witness? If your restaurant really was the scene of such theatrics... ...you would have known about it, correct!?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0... Z'is is most difficult for me...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, it's quite simple. All you have to do is testify. You are under oath, after all. Was there, in fact, a phony at Tres Bien that day!? The defense demands that Mr. Armstrong tell the whole truth about what happened.Judge:\nThe defense's request for additional testimony is accepted. You will accurately explain, in detail, the events in the restaurant that day!Armstrong:\nOu... Oui.Witness Testimony-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\nZ'ere were no other customers.\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Judge:\n...Just so we're clear, there was no mirror in the restaurant, after all?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Forgive me, Your Honor! I lied because I wanted z'is mess to be cleared up quickly.Judge:\nWhat you have just done is commit perjury, Mr. Armstrong! I will decide how to punish you later.Armstrong:\nO-Oui...Judge:\nFor now, we will hear your cross-examination. Mr. Wright, if you please. (Changed from [For now, we will hear your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Hmm.. He took that perjury charge a bit too well.

I saw 'im from la kitchen.\nPhoenix:\nYet the defendant, Ms. Byrde, remembers it differently. She swears there was another man at the victim's table.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Unfortunately for you, Trite... ...yesterday's witness also testified that the victim was alone.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou know, seeing you squirm like that reminds me... ...of a certain coffee's bitter-sweet bite.\nPhoenix:\n(What kind of coffee has he been drinking!?)\nMaya:\nIt's not coffee, it's love! It's love that's bitter-sweet.\nPhoenix:\n(Hearing Maya say that makes her seem wise all of a sudden...)Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy old man, you mean Victor Kudo, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui. 'E comes often for my special coffee.\nGodot:\nI drank your coffee once, Mr. Armstrong. It's special, I'll give you that. It's worth a sip just for the experience.\nArmstrong:\nOh, you make me so 'appy, monsieur! You are most welcome any time!\nGodot:\nI said it was worth one sip, and nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n(So old Mr. Kudo arrived at the restaurant around the same time as the victim. Maybe I should ask about his arrival in more detail.)\n\n\n\nDon't ask anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I need to do is establish that this phony victim really existed. Asking more about the old man is only going to cloud the issue.) I think that's enough about coffee. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Armstrong.\nArmstrong:\nYou are welcome any time too, Monsieur Wright. I'll brew something special for you!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHow many minutes after?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying that not much time elapsed between when the victim and Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Z'at is correct.\nPhoenix:\n(But that still leaves the possibility that something happened in that gap of time.) And by your recollection, how much time would you say elapsed?\nArmstrong:\nLet me see... Approximately 2 minutes, I would say.\nPhoenix:\nT-Two minutes!? That's all?\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems unlikely that anything untoward could have happened in such a short time.\nPhoenix:\n(Rats! I knew I shouldn't have pursued this line of questioning...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhat time is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOut of curiosity, about what time was it when Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOh, no... I cannot remember, monsieur.\nJudge:\nHmm... I believe we were told by a witness yesterday...\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\n\n\nJudge:\nDoes that perhaps jog your memory, witness?\nArmstrong:\nLa incident 'appened about 20 minutes after 'e arrived. So the victim must 'ave arrived between 2:00 PM and 2:10 PM, non?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Just after 2, huh...)\nArmstrong:\nThank you for your 'elp, in jogging my memory, monsieur. You are wonderful!\nJudge:\nHah hah hah! I can't sit here all the time and do nothing now, can I!? The time of day will be added to the witness's testimony.\nArmstrong:\nOui, Monsieur Judge. Everything I do, I do it for you!\nJudge:\nMerci bien. That's French, isn't it? Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad at least one person is in a good mood...)\nMaya:\nH-He's even humming a song to himself...!\nChanges statement from \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\" to \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.\"Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure about the time?\nArmstrong:\nWhen I think really 'ard, 1 am sure it was just after 2. Oui. It is la time I stop serving la lunch menu.\nJudge:\nQuite right. I always break for lunch when the restaurants are serving their specials. I've been known to wind up a case early just to make it on time! Hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess you should never get between a hungry judge and his lunch...)\nJudge:\nOh, would you look at that! It's almost lunchtime already.\nPhoenix:\nWitness! Get on with your testimony, please!Present Millionaire Radio Flyer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nZ'ere were no other customers.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo your only customers were Mr. Kudo and the victim?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHow many times do you need to ask the same thing, Trite? You'd never catch me drinking the same blend twice!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're trying to establish the presence of a \"phony victim\" in the restaurant. But you're wasting your time. You can't grind bird seed to make coffee, if you catch my drift...\nPhoenix:\n(But there's a hole in this testimony somewhere! I'm sure of it!)Armstrong:\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see him?\nArmstrong:\nNon, I was in ze kitchen. But I 'eard 'im. I remember 'im shouting, \"Yes! 'Alf a million bucks!\"\nGodot:\nPresumably the defendant heard that too, then, correct?\nArmstrong:\nMaggey...? She looked like a poor little frightened dove!\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about Mr. Kudo?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man chocked on some bird seed z'at got stuck in 'is throat.\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems we now have yet another incident on our hands.Armstrong:\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what were you doing at that point? Without any customers, you must have had time to kill.\nArmstrong:\nI am multi-talented woman, monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nSorry? What do you mean?\nArmstrong:\nZ'ere is la renowned chef, Jean Armstrong, and la tragic poet, Claurice Armstrong.\nJudge:\nC-C-Claurice...?\nArmstrong:\nOui. I was writing a poem. An angry tale of a chef in 'alf a million dollars of debt... ...cooking for a man who won 'alf a million dollars on la lottery! It is called, \"Pourquoi\". It means, \"Why\". Per'aps I could recite it for la court?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you contacted the police as soon as the incident occurred?\nArmstrong:\nI asked la old man to call from la pay phone.\nGodot:\nBy your own argument, Trite... ...the purpose of this \"phony victim's\" performance was so the old man would see it. In other words... ...once the incident occurred, this opportunity would completely disappear.\nJudge:\nIndeed.\nArmstrong:\nBien. It seems la shadow of doubt 'as been lifted, n'est-ce pas?\nPhoenix:\n...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Maya:\nI guess Mr. Armstrong is connected to this case, huh?Phoenix:\nAbsolutely. Someone was impersonating Mr. Elg, and I refuse to believe he was oblivious. He was there the whole time, after all.Maya:\nBut if you're right, wouldn't Maggey have noticed, too?Phoenix:\nShe fell unconscious when the incident occurred, remember?Maya:\nAh! You mean that's when the phony staged his act?Phoenix:\nWe'll know for sure once I find a hole in this testimony.Phoenix:\nI'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.Armstrong:\nQ-Quoi? What do you mean?Phoenix:\nAt the time in question, the victim was listening to the radio with his earpiece. The show he was listening to was \"Millionaire Radio\". Each week, they announce the winning number of a half million dollar lottery ticket.Armstrong:\nOui. Z'at must be la show Mon. Elg was listening to.Judge:\nI can't see any problem with this testimony, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nI wonder...Armstrong:\n...?Phoenix:\nYou say the victim arrived at your restaurant after 2 PM, correct?Armstrong:\nOui, oui. I am sure of it. I remember it perfectly now! I know it was z'at time, because I 'ad just finished serving la lunch menu.Godot:\nGet to the point, Trite. If you have one.Phoenix:\nThat show is broadcast live at 1:30 PM. And it claims to be \"the most thrilling 10 minutes of your life\"...Judge:\nI-It's on the air at 1:30!?Phoenix:\nNow, supposedly, the victim made some noise when it was announced that he had won. And yet... I don't believe his cry of joy could have occurred after 2 PM! Because the show had already finished more than 30 minutes earlier by that point in time!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Phoenix:\nThis \"victim\" we've been told about has done nothing but the impossible! Listening to the radio with a ruptured eardrum, catching a show that was already over... There is only one conclusion you can draw from these facts! This \"victim\" was an imposter, acting out the poisoning 30 minutes after the real murder! Yes, there were two Glen Elgs in Tres Bien that day. The real Glen Elg, now dead, having been poisoned by the real killer... ...and the phony Glen Elg, acting out the events for Mr. Kudo to witness!Judge:\nI-It certainly seems that way... I mean, if that wasn't the case, how could you explain the time discrepancy?Godot:Godot:\nQuite a performance, Trite. You were almost on a roll.Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nBut sadly, you lack the rock hard foundation of rhythm to build your song!Phoenix:\n(...What is this? Music Theory 101?)Godot:\nLet's recap. According to your \"imaginative\" theory, it's now just after 2 PM... The phony Elg is performing a play for the benefit of Mr. Kudo. How do you explain then, where the real Glen Elg is!?Phoenix:\nI don't believe I have to spell this out for court! However! At that time, the real Glen Elg was already dead!Judge:\nThat's certainly the obvious conclusion.Godot:Godot:\nThank you, Trite. That's exactly what I was hoping you would say.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Godot:\nNow, I presume you can prove this theory of yours...? Can you explain where the missing corpse went to!?Phoenix:\nTh-The missing corpse...?Godot:\nAccording to the old man's testimony, there was only one other customer there. If that \"customer\" was the phony Glen Elg... ...then where did the killer hide the body of the real victim!?Phoenix:\nNaaaaaargh!Judge:\nThe prosecution has a valid point, Mr. Wright. If your theory is to stand up to examination by the court... ...you must provide us with proof by answering the prosecution's question. Where did the killer hide the body?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...Godot:\nNo conjecture, Trite. Let's hear some facts for once. Show the court a piece of evidence that proves where the body was hidden!Phoenix:\nE-Evidence!?Maya:\nWh-What's with the intense pressure in here all of a sudden!?Phoenix:\n(I thought I had him with that contradiction. But he's turned it all around and backed me into a corner instead!)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence. First, where was the body of the real Mr. Elg concealed?Outside Tres Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tres Bien. Therefore, the killer must have hauled the body outside!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight. What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nStart over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think I need to clear my head...\nGodot:\nHa...! I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo tambi\u00e9n.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent more evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll hit them with another piece of evidence and see if that helps...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Clearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tres Bien.\"Inside Tres Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt'd would [sic] have been too dangerous to take the body outside. Obviously, the body must have been hidden somewhere inside Tres Bien.\nJudge:\nHmm... Interesting... But where could a body have been hidden inside a restaurant? Perhaps you would care to show the court on these plans, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The exact location where the body was concealed inside Tres Bien is...\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe body was hidden here!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent Small Bottle (after presenting Kitchen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight. What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nStart over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think I need to clear my head...\nGodot:\nHa...! I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo tambi\u00e9n.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPick another location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll have another go at proving where the body was hidden.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It'd would have been too dangerous to take the body outside.\"Phoenix:\nMr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non, non! I 'ave never seen z'at ugly bottle before in my life! I only use la very best bottles, monsieur! Z'e 'ighest quality only for me!Judge:\nWhere was that bottle found, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nInterestingly enough, Your Honor. it was found in the kitchen of Tres Bien.Armstrong:\nEh? Quoi!? But I only ever use z'ese bottles for my aromatherapy oils.Phoenix:\nBut this bottle doesn't contain aromatherapy oil, Mr. Armstrong. No, it contains a medication.Judge:\nWhat kind of medication?Phoenix:\nI'm sure everyone remembers, don't they? That Mr. Elg visited an otolaryngological clinic, and was given medication that day!Godot:\nY-You can't be serious...Phoenix:\nThe defense had the contents of the bottle analyzed, and I have the lab results here! The contents of the bottle match the prescription that was given to Mr. Elg!Godot:\nBwooooar!Phoenix:\nGlen Elg's murderer hid the body in the restaurant kitchen. At which time, this bottle fell out of the victim's pocket. Mr. Armstrong! When the incident occurred, didn't you say you were in the kitchen?Armstrong:\nM-M-Mon dieu!Phoenix:\nYes, you know about what I'm about to say, It was YOU who hid the victim's body! You did a fine job pretending to defend my client, Maggey Byrde. However! You were setting her up to take the fall behind the poor girl's back!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! This is an extraordinary development. Witness! Did you... Did you murder Mr. Glen Elg?Armstrong:\nNever! I could not do such an 'orrible thing!Godot:\nNoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!?Godot:\n...The bitterness... Every time I get lied to, I always down a mug of coffee. ...That's one of my rules.Phoenix:\n(Do you have the slightest idea how many cups you've had by now...?)Godot:\nThen I like to do the same to the person who lied to me. I like to take them down with my empty cup! Listen up, chef! How about a brand new flavor in your ear, my \"h\" deficient friend?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Please, you must 'ear me out! It is a trap! Listen to me! Por favor!Judge:\nYo hablo Espa\u00f1ol, Mr. Armstrong, and \"Por favor\" is Spanish.Godot:\nI'm only going to ask you once. Did you do it?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non! Absolutely non! I simply... I...Godot:\nLet's hear it. You've got one shot. Right, gramps?Judge:\nWitness! The court will permit you the chance to make one final statement. If you lie under oath again, Mr. Godot's coffee mug awaits you... As does my gavel!Armstrong:\nO-Oui... It is clear.Phoenix:\n(What do they always say in the movies...? \"I've got a bad feeling about this...\"?)Judge:\nVery well! Begin your final testimony, Mr. Armstrong!Witness Testimony-- The Confession --Armstrong:\nIt is true, I 'id la body in la kitchen.\nA man forced me to do it. I 'ad no choice.\nI 'ad to go along w'iz 'im because... Z'ere was a reason why I could not refuse.\nBut I did not kill 'im! I swear it! You must believe me!Judge:\nYou were \"forced\"? By who!?Armstrong:\nI-I cannot say! Or I will be... erased!Phoenix:\nLet's try a different question then. When Mr. Elg died, was he really the only person at his table?Armstrong:\n... Z'ere was... Z'ere was another man.Phoenix:\n(I knew it!)Maya:\nMaggey was telling the truth!Judge:\nYou may cross-examine the witness now, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(There's just one more thing I need to do.

Actually, that's been gnawing at me, too!\nLeads to:\n\"Small Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMaya:\nWhat are you doing, Nick!? If Detective Gumshoe's going to check some prints for us, shouldn't he be checking this?\nGumshoe:\nThat's that small bottle I gave back to you this morning, right?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim's ear medication that we found in the kitchen?\nMaya:\nLook, it even says, \"covered in unidentified fingerprints\" right in the Court Record!\nGumshoe:\nYou're right!

You' don't wanna cross them, or youse gonna wind up sleepin' with de fishes. Once the Godfather finds out youse been draggin' Violetta through the mud... ...he'll... do you... in...\nPhoenix:\n... Sorry, I...

How about you pay back the money then. Your allowance should cover it!Maya:\nHey! I'm no idiot, you know!Phoenix:\n(Well, I'M certainly not the one who thought the $50,000 was free money!) Anyway, I need to work this guy without pressing his testimony too hard.Maya:\nBut his testimony is pretty solid as it is...Phoenix:\n(I admit nothing jumps out at me as a contradiction. But I've got to find an opening somewhere... Or I need to make one.)Phoenix:\nMr. Tigre... You claim you didn't know Mr. Glen Elg. But it appears that Mr. Elg knew you.Tigre:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nMr. Elg left this little note on his calendar. \"Meet with The Tiger\"... And the date? December 3rd. (Changed from ['Meet with The Tiger'... Dated, December 3rd.] in the original release)Judge:\nD-December 3rd!? That's... the day of the murder!Phoenix:\nSo, Mr. Tigre, I submit that you did indeed know one Mr. Glen Elg! Because on the very day of the incident, you met with him!Tigre:\n... Grrrah ha ha ha hah! Not bad! Youse actually not bad.Phoenix:\nS-Sorry?Tigre:\nI was just messin' with youse to see how good you' were.Maya:\nDid you hear that, Nick? He said you're not bad!Phoenix:\n(That's one compliment I can do without! Plus, he's lying through his teeth!)Judge:\nUm, witness. Please remember that you're under oath. Lies will not be tolerated.Tigre:\nYouse callin' me a liar!? Is that what you' doin'!?Judge:\nRuh-roh!Godot:\nSo you're saying that your claim to have \"never seen that kid before\" is the truth?Tigre:\nI said I'm dead serious! Youse betta believe that's the truth!Godot:\nHa...! Then I'd say that gives me time... to enjoy another cup of pure black magic! That is, while you testify for the court again, Mr. Tigre.Judge:\nOh, yes! Um, would you mind indulging the court, witness?Phoenix:\n(He never actually met the victim!? That's got to be a lie right there! It's time I nailed this guy!)Witness Testimony-- The Victim, Glen Elg --Tigre:\nI ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg.\nThere was some lame guy with that name, though. Wanted to borrow cash from me.\nI set up a meetin' with the guy... at my office, Tender Lender.\nI waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed.\nI ain't never been to that Tres Bien joint, youse hear?Judge:\nI see... That all seems perfectly logical. You had arranged to meet with the victim, but he didn't show up.Godot:\nI've heard it's pretty hard to keep appointments when you're dead.Judge:\nVery well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor!Tigre:\nDidn't I tell you I got a big deal goin' down today? I ain't gonna make my bus now.

She very conspicuously put some white powder in there!Godot:\nWas the victim he saw the real victim or not? That doesn't matter. The fact remains, he saw the accused put the poison into the coffee!Judge:\n...! Yes, it was the waitress who poisoned the coffee--Phoenix:Phoenix:\nV-Very impressive, Mr. Godot. ...Waiting for my absence to launch your attack!Godot:\nHa...! Found your pen at last, Trite?Phoenix:\nIt was in my pocket. *ahem* But anyway... Mr. Kudo witnessed two people that day. He saw the victim, the \"supposed\" Mr. Glen Elg, and the \"waitress\"... from behind.Judge:\nYes... Your point, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nI think the conclusion is obvious. If this \"Glen Elg\" was really the killer in disguise... ...then surely it's possible the \"waitress\" was also part of the show.Judge:\nWhat!?

You' betta be goin' home in an armored truck tonight, if you' know what I mean...Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nStop shaking, Nick!Phoenix:\nWh-Where was I? Yes, the defendant, Ms. Byrde, has stated the following...Byrde:\nWell, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant.Byrde:\nUmm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh.Tigre:\n...Phoenix:\nThere are just too many contradictions in this case. The \"second man\" at the victim's table who nobody but Ms. Byrde seems to have seen. The earpiece worn by the victim in his left ear when that eardrum was ruptured! And the radio show he was supposedly listening to half an hour after it was over. There is only one logical explanation that clears up all of these contradictions! The whole incident took place twice! Once for real, and once for show! And, Mr. Furio Tigre, the only person who could have committed the crime... ...was you!Tigre:\n... ......Judge:\nW-Witness? What have you got to say?Tigre:\n... That's cute!Judge:\nS-Sorry?Tigre:\nYouse alright. I could do with a guy like you' around.Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean?Tigre:\nOK, I'm in on this game! I'm gonna have to charter a jet to get me to my meetin' now, but... ...I'm gonna give youse one more thing to think about before I go.Phoenix:\nSomething to think about?Tigre:\nYouse got it all wrapped up nice, huh, Wright? But youse missed out one real important thing!Phoenix:\nBut that can't be!Tigre:\nI was in the joint that day. And I met that kid, too.Phoenix:\n...!Tigre:\nBut I couldn't have poisoned him, youse hear?Judge:\nWhat!? Do you really expect us to believe you now, Mr. Tigre?Godot:\nHa...! What a troublemaker.Phoenix:\nT-Troublemaker...?Godot:\nLooks like we're going to need another one for the road. One more steaming cup of hot testimony!Judge:\nIndeed. Witness, you will explain yourself to the court. I will give you one more chance to testify. What happened that day at Tres Bien between yourself and the victim?Witness Testimony-- Ties to the Victim --Tigre:\nYeah, I loaned Elg cash. About 100,000 dollars.\nThat day, we was due to have a little chat. The kid had hit his payback date, see?\nSo anyway, he tells me he's got no way to pay up.\nI'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.\n\"Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks!\" He got lucky, you' know. Real lucky.\nIf that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.Judge:\nNow, I see that the principal amount you loaned to Mr. Elg was 50,000 dollars...Tigre:\nYeah, well. Youse got the vig to take into account. Interest builds up fast, you' know.Phoenix:\n(That's faster than fast! 100,000 dollars is twice his principal!)Judge:\nAnd the repayment deadline was December 3rd, the day of the incident in question.Tigre:\nYeah. He was one lucky kid! He got that half a million just in time. So I ain't have no reason to kill the kid. And if I ain't got no motive, you ain't got no case!Phoenix:\n(His motive? Hmm... He has to have one, but what is it?)Cross Examination",

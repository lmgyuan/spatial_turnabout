You don't know about magic, do you Pearls?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(I braved the winter cold and took Pearls to see the circus.

We can't miss the last train.\nPhoenix:\nPearls! You remembered the train!\nPearl:\nOf course I did! But I don't really understand what everyone means by \"express train\".\nMaya:\nWell, Nick...

Why did they arrest Max?\nPhoenix:\nYou're asking the wrong man on that one, Maya. Maybe he used his magical skills to deal death with a slight [sic] of hand...\nMaya:\nMaximillion Galactica would never do such a thing!!\n???:\nFABULOUS!! What the young lady just said was absolutely fabulous! What a clever girl! Such a fabulous understanding of events!\nPhoenix:\n(...What's with all this fabulous talk...)\nMax:\nWelcome to the Visitor's Room!\nMaya:\nIt's MAX!! Nick!! Look!

Thank you so much!!\nPhoenix:\nHey... Umm... What about my card?\nMax:\nThink of it as a souvenir.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWell Nick... I think it's time to get to work.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nWhat's the matter, Nick? Why are you looking at the ceiling?\nPhoenix:\nI was just thinking about what I should have for lunch.\nMax:\nSweetie... Drop porcupine head over there. Shower me with your attention. OK?\nMaya:\nO-O-O-Oh, yes...! (Changed from [Y-Y-Y-Yes...] in the original release)\nMax:\nAb-so-lute-ly... FABULOUS!!\nPhoenix:\n(Absolutely cringe inducing.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Attorney's Badge:\nMax:\n... Anyways... I've been curious about something for a while now.\nMaya:\nWhat's that?\nMax:\nWhy do you keep looking at me with such a sad look on your face, sweetie?\nMaya:\nBe-Because! You've been arrested! For murder!\nMax:\nOh, don't be ignorant. They wouldn't arrest someone like me!!\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?\nMax:\nObviously because I'm the fabulous Maximillion Galactica!\nPhoenix:\nSo?\nMax:\nI'm the very big star of the Berry Big Circus.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that means?\nMax:\nI'm rich. I'm paid fabulous sums!\nPhoenix:\nWhich means what?\nMax:\n...\nMaya:\nMax...\nMax:\nQuit joking around! You've got to be pulling my magic wand! The police aren't really serious about all this, are they?\nPhoenix:\nThey don't arrest people as a joke.\nMax:\n...!!\nMaya:\nLook at Max... He's crushed...\nPhoenix:\nWell he needed to wake up and smell the coffee. (This is serious business.)\nMax:\nUmm... Umm...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nPorcu... I mean, Sir.

Max.\nMax:\nYes?\nMaya:\nWhat's your real name?\nMax:\nIt's Billy Bob Johns...\nMaya:\n............ (Changed from [... Ugh...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the matter, Maya?\nMaya:\nHe's really just a country bumpkin!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMax:\n...Ahem. I must apologize for not being my absolutely fabulous self just now, sweetie.\nMaya:\nH-Huh?\nMax:\nMr. Attorney.\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMax:\nA few minutes ago, you took one of my cards, didn't you?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Now that he mentions it... I did take a card.)\nMax:\nIt was the 10 of Hearts. Right?\nPhoenix:\n(Wha... How'd he... He got it right, again!)\nMax:\nWhat can I say? You, too... You've stolen some of my most valued possessions. Ten of Maximillion Galactica's hearts...\nPhoenix:\n(You sure do have a lot of hearts, don't you?)\nMax:\nAh ha ha ha... I'm putting my faith in you sweetie.\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't just call me sweetie, did he?)\nMaya:\nAlright! Let's make this an absolutely fabulous case! C'mon, Nick!\nDecember 28Wright & Co.

You seem down.\nMaya:\nMaximilion Galactica... Who would have guessed he was country bumpkin?\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusCircus Entrance\nMaya:\nWe're here again...\nPhoenix:\nYep. But this time we are here for work. (It hasn't been that long since the crime, so the police are still on the scene.)\nMaya:\nLet's find someone who might know something about what happened.\nPhoenix:\nSounds like a plan.\nDecember 28Lodging HousePlaza\nPhoenix:\nThis seems to be a dorm where all the performers in the circus stay...\nMaya:\nReally!? So we might run into that stoogey clown here, right? He's so kooky! (Changed from [Really!? So that stoogey clown should be here, huh? He's so kooky!] in the original release)\n???:\nAhhh! It's you two!\nMaya:\nOh... Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nHow is it you guys always seem to know when I'm working a crime scene, pal? (Changed from [I always see you hanging around when I'm working a crime scene, pal.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nBecause you're always working, Detective. (Changed from [You always seem to be working so hard, Detective.] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'd rather not be always working, but with crime, you don't make your own hours. (Changed from [I'd rather not be working hard, but with crime you don't make your own hours.] in the original release) If I have to be at the circus anyway, I want to see the lion tamer and the tightrope. However, no matter where I go, the show is always the same... Dead body. Stage left.\nMaya:\nNick! Nick! He complained!!\nPhoenix:\nHeh heh... That's a rarity. Let's get back to business now, OK?\nAfter clearing \"The eyewitness\" Talk option in Lodging House - Plaza:\nDecember 28Lodging Hall 1st FloorMoe's Room\nPhoenix:\nI wonder whose room this is. (Changed from [This is it?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nThe nametag on the door says \"Moe\" on it.\nPhoenix:\nI guess he's not here...\nMaya:\nWow... It's a real mess in here!\nPhoenix:\n(My room's probably worse though...)\nMaya:\nOh well... I give up. We'll have to come back later.\nDecember 28Berry Big CircusBig Top\nPhoenix:\nThe circus stage sure doesn't look this small from out in the audience...\nMaya:\nWow... This is where they all perform, isn't it? Nick! Do some somersaults!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not doing any somersaults.\nMaya:\nWhy not!? You look like you'd be great at it!\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I look like I'd be great at somersaults!?)\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...\nMaya:\nHuh? Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt wasn't me.\n???:\nGrrrrrrrrrrr...

Regent is such a cute tiger! Isn't he!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\n...\n???:\nWhat's the matter? You two sure are quiet.\nMaya:\nDon't \"What's the matter?\" me! N-Nick... He almost died there!!\n???:\nHah! He wasn't anywhere close to getting hurt, let alone dying! This little tiger hardly ever bites people. And besides, people normally never get to play with a wild tiger, right? So if you think about it, you're actually really lucky!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!?\n???:\nYou agree, don't you?\nPhoenix:\n... I guess...\nMaya:\nW-W-W-What do you mean you guess!? Why are you agreeing with her?\n???:\nWoohoo!! Your costume...\nMaya:\nEh?\n???:\nIt's cute. I wanna try it on!!\nMaya:\nC-Costume? You mean my clothes...?\n???:\nYou don't mind letting me try it on, right?\nMaya:\nUhh... I guess not...\n???:\nREALLY!? Hehehehehe!! You're the best!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... The tables turned quickly on that one. So much for the tiger thing...)\n???:\nOh! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Regina Berry... The renowned animal tamer of the Berry Big Circus!\nMaya:\nMy name's Maya Fey. I'm a spirit medium.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix Wright. Attorney at law.

Likewise...\nDetention Center\nAfter clearing \"Something unusual\" and \"The eyewitness\" Talk options in Lodging House - Plaza, and visiting Big Top:\nDecember 28Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\n... Max isn't here.\nPhoenix:\nHe must be in questioning.\nMaya:\nAww... I wanted to see a magic trick.\nPhoenix:\nHe should be back in a little bit.\nMaya:\nI guess so.\nLodging House - Plaza\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nAfter presenting Russell Berry profile in Berry Big Circus - Big Top:\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nThis was the Ringmaster's room?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This room belonged to the victim. Which means this must be where Max met the Ringmaster last night.\nMaya:\nNow that you mention it, that is what he said.\nPhoenix:\nI wonder what... Hmm... That's an interesting poster. (Changed from [I wonder what... Hmm... That's an intresting [sic] poster.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nAh! It's a poster of Max! I want it! I want it! Nick!

Ha... Huh? M-Me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. You work at the circus don't you?\n???:\nN-No. I'm just your everyday average Joe.\nMaya:\nAn average Joe who just happens to hang out at the circus? I don't think so.\n???:\nY-Yes I am. I've got nothing to do with what's going on here.\nPhoenix:\n(He's lying. Like any regular person would hang around the circus... Dressed like that!) I'm an attorney. My name is Phoenix Wright.\nMaya:\nI'm a spirit medium. My name is Maya.\n???:\nWell... I... Um... Just happened to be... Umm... Passing by...\nPhoenix:\nI don't suppose you happen to be some kind of carny?\n???:\nNot a c-c-carny... I-I'm a p-performer. Actually, I'm a v-v-v-ventriloquist.\nMaya:\nVentriloquist?\n???:\nHe-he-he-he-he-he-he... I-I-I'm Benjamin Wo-Wo-Wo-Woodman...\nMaya:\nYour last name is Woodman? *snicker* (Changed from [You're [sic] last name is Woodman? *snicker*] in the original release)\n???:\nY-Yes...

Aha!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMoe:\nI welched on giving you more than one!!\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nMoe:\nNo no no! If it was funny, it is your duty as a human being to laugh!!

Aha!\nPhoenix:\n(This is like some Faustian nightmare...)\nMaya:\nC'mon! It was funny!

Law Offices\nBig Top\nAfter presenting Max profile in Lodging Hall 1st Floor - Moe's Room:\nDecember 28Big TopCafeteria\nMaya:\nEww... This place is gross.\nPhoenix:\nThis must be because of last night. They didn't have time to clean up after dinner because of the murder.\nMaya:\nThat reminds me... What was it that Moe said?\nPhoenix:\nHe said that yesterday morning Max \"clonked\" Ben over the head here.\nMaya:\nHe also said that, \"There's Gotti be something interesting there.\" Nick?

I wonder if we've been making any progress...\nPhoenix:\nDon't be so negative... Of course we are making progress.\nMaya:\nBut... Everyone loved the Ringmaster... And there's no sign of footprints on the scene... There's still a lot of mysteries left to be solved.\nPhoenix:\nOf course.\nMaya:\nAnd now Regina isn't here!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not seeing how that's related...\nDecember 28Big TopRingmaster's Room\nMaya:\nIt looks the same as always... A great big mess. Considering how messy it is, I bet they wouldn't notice if another poster went missing.\nPhoenix:\nWill you just stop it, you poster pilferer!\nMaya:\nI'm just kidding! You know I already got one of these posters!!\nPhoenix:\nYou mean \"stole\" one of those posters!\nMaya:\nYeah... Uh... Let's focus on what Max told us.

Probably because we ditched him earlier. (Changed from [Yep. Just leave him alone for a while, OK Maya?] in the original release) I bet he and the other cops got lonely and headed back to the precinct.

It just took awhile for the joke to find its audience!\nPhoenix:\n... *sigh*\nMoe:\nSo what can I do for you? Did you remember a good joke you wanted to tell me? Pull up a chair, or maybe just pull my finger, and let me have it.\nMaya:\nWe're going to get the same sound effect either way, aren't we?\nMoe:\nHow'd you know I put a whopee [sic] cushion on the chair!?

I think it's about time we wrap up our investigation...\nMaya:\nDo you think we'll win in court tomorrow?\nPhoenix:\nWho knows... Even I can't imagine what kind of testimony will come out tomorrow. (I'm guessing Moe will be a witness in court tomorrow... Moe and maybe the puppet.)\nMaya:\nDon't worry Nick. No matter what, we've still got a magician on our side!!\nPhoenix:\nThat's good, because we might need some magic tomorrow...\nTo be continued.\nMoe's Room (before examining junk pile in Lodging Hall 3rd Floor - Acro's Room)\nMaya:\nHuh? Moe must have gone off somewhere...\nPhoenix:\nJust as long as he isn't off writing new jokes...\nMaya:\nOh, that reminds me Nick... You have to get your Attorney's Badge back by tomorrow, or we're in trouble.\nPhoenix:\nI know. I know. (I'm gonna have to try and find out where that monkey hid it...)",

Why in the world was it locked in that big box?\nPhoenix:\n(There was only one little bottle in that huge box...?)\nMaya:\nI wonder if that has some sort of special meaning?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nThe cause of death was blunt force trauma that snapped a vertebrae in his neck.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAccording to the Autopsy Report, the murder weapon was a blunt object, correct?\nGumshoe:\nYou've done your homework, pal.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you haven't found this murder weapon, have you?\nvon Karma:\nThe police are searching for it as we speak.\nGumshoe:\nMy theory is that it is something the perpetrator ran off with.\nJudge:\nYou would think so... Especially since you didn't find it on the scene.\nGumshoe:\nNo no no... I bet he made it disappear with magic... Ho ho ho!Maya:\nThere wasn't much that we could go after Gumshoe with this time...Phoenix:\nHe gave us the facts, as he saw them. But there's gotta be more to this.Maya:\nI didn't see anything... But that's why you're the lawyer and I'm the medium.After pressing first and sixth statements and selecting \"About the contents\" upon pressing fifth statement:Judge:\nWell, I think we have a good feel for the details of the event now.Phoenix:\n(I guess that's all we're gonna get out of Gumshoe in this case...)Maya:\nYou mean all we're gonna get out of him is that little bottle of pepper?von Karma:\nNow that we have wrapped up with the Detective, I'd like to call my next witness.Gumshoe:\nEh? I'm not even off the stand yet!von Karma:\nObviously... But that's due to you being slow and unable to take a hint!Gumshoe:\nI dunno, but \"wrapped up\" has such a mean sound to it... I'm a sensitive guy...Judge:\nThank you very much, Detective Gumshoe. You may step down. Ms. von Karma. Call your next witness.von Karma:\nI would like to call Mr. Benjamin Woodman to the stand.Phoenix:\n(She must be talking about Ben the ventriloquist...)Maya:\nI wonder if Trilo will show up on the stand as well...?von Karma:\nPlease state your name and occupation for the record.Trilo:\nMy full name is Trilo Quist. I am employed as an opera tenor.Judge:\nEx-Excuse me! The witness called to the stand was one Mr. Benjamin Woodman, Ventriloquist.Trilo:\nThat robe must be cutting off your circulation. I said that I was a singer!! Maybe you don't believe me. Fine. I'll grace you with a song. *Ahem*... Mi mi mi mi mi! The world of the law... Exciting and daring... Guilt or innocence... Decided by a judge dressed up like a woman!! ...Well, what do you think?von Karma:\n...Judge:\n...Maya:\nIt had a good rhythm...Phoenix:\nIt's just the lyrics... They leave something to be desired, so to speak.Ben:\nT-Trilo! You know better than to insult a judge!!Trilo:\nShuddup! Just look at your nose. You would think you'd have the sense to fix it!! It's so ugly I want to punch you in the face on the off change swelling would help. You know that your nose is the reason you'll never be an A-List star.Maya:\nCelebrities must really enjoy saying everything that flashes into their minds.Judge:\nWhat's going on here!? Order! Order! I demand to know who the witness is!!Ben:\nDon't... Don't worry about me, sir. I'll let Trilo handle this.Judge:\nI'm not worried about you one bit... I'm worried about getting testimony in my court! OUCH!!von Karma:\nYou won't get anywhere trying to figure out this witness! Now let's proceed!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Trilo:\nOnce practice was over, I left the tent with the stooge... I mean clown.\nOnce we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went back to the plaza's entrance. (Changed from [Once we got to the lodging house, I ditched him and went over to the plaza.] in the original release)\nThat's when I saw Max, heading towards the scene of the crime.\nHe was the only one heading that way... How could that punk not be the killer!?\nThen the police showed up, and took magic boy away.von Karma:\nYou saw Maximillion Galactica heading towards the scene? You're sure of that?Trilo:\nWithout a doubt. He had on his silk hat, cloak, and the dumb white roses on his chest. How can you mistake someone with that crazy get-up and his nose stuck up so high...Judge:\nTh-That's enough... I think we all get the picture. Just one thing... You said you \"ditched\" the clown.Trilo:\nThat's right, dress-boy.Judge:\nWell, since you weren't with him, couldn't that mean the clown committed the crime?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... He's got a point.)von Karma:\nWhat a shame... It was a nice theory, but the clown can't be the criminal.Judge:\nWhy's that?von Karma:\nHere's absolute proof.Judge:\nA... silk hat?von Karma:\nThis was found at the scene of the crime. It belongs to the defendant.Phoenix:\nAh...von Karma:\nWithout question, he was wearing his signature hat during practice. If the clown was the murderer, there would be no reason for this hat to be at the scene.Judge:\nHmm... Well done, Ms. von Karma. Your prosecutorial skills are unrivaled. Well done.von Karma:\nThank you for stating the obvious... Mr. Phoenix Wright, what do you have to say?Phoenix:\nO-OK... (I guess she's the boss again today...)Cross Examination",

Once practice was over, he was 9/10ths of the way to keeling over for good...\nPhoenix:\nPoor guy...\nTrilo:\nWe didn't have any choice, so Ben took him back to his room.

Especially with all the snow around... Wouldn't thinking in your nice warm lodging house have been a better idea?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nMr. Phoenix Wright. I think you should leave the thinking to the witness.\nPhoenix:\n(But I'm a good thunker* ([sic])! At least my teachers always said I was...)Trilo:\nThat's when I saw Max, heading towards the scene of the crime.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was really Max Galactica?\nTrilo:\nOf course I'm sure. How could you mistake someone wearing such a snobby 3 piece get-up!\nPhoenix:\nSnobby 3 piece get-up?\nTrilo:\nGet the wax out of your ears! Lawyers nowadays... You're like talking to a brick wall!

I suppose that would have been around... Hey, what time was it!?\nBen:\nHuh!? Umm... I think it was around... I'd say a bit after 10:30 PM... I think...\nPhoenix:\nPractice ended at 10 PM so you hung around the lodging house the entire time?\nBen:\nI... I... I... I guess that sounds about right...\nPhoenix:\nWasn't it awfully cold? I can't believe you'd just stand outside in that weather!\nBen:\nWell... Uh... The truth is...\nTrilo:\nWill you shut up, you big nosed dope! Why are you telling him anything extra!? Why can't you believe that we'd just stand outside in that weather?\nPhoenix:\nWell, maybe you were waiting for someone?\nTrilo:\nW-W-W-W-WHAT!?

A little after 10:30 PM... There's not a doubt in my mind!\nPhoenix:\n(It doesn't look like he is lying about this...)Maya:\nHmm... Trilo wouldn't happen to have an ulterior motive for incriminating Max, would he?Phoenix:\nWell, Max is part of that bitter love triangle with Regina. Which is probably why Max conked him over the head.Maya:\nUmm Nick... Wasn't Ben the one who got knocked over the head?Phoenix:\nUh... Yeah... I think so... I dunno anymore!Phoenix:\nAlright! There is obviously a reason why this witness was there that night! He spent all that time waiting for Regina to arrive! Moreover... Even if someone else would've walked right in front of him, I doubt he would have paid them a second thought!Trilo:\nAHHHH!!Judge:\nThat makes perfect sense.von Karma:von Karma:\nWhat did you just say!? The witness saw the defendant at the scene of the crime!!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nHowever, he did not see the victim on the way to his eventual demise! If you accept that, then you must accept that there is a high likelihood that... He could have missed someone else other than Max heading to the scene! OWWW!!von Karma:\nThere is absolutely no proof that the witness was waiting for the animal tamer!Trilo:\nUmm... Umm... I guess you got me... Alright! Alright! I'll spill the beans for real this time! It's true. I was waiting for Regina.Ben:\nPAIN!!von Karma:\nDon't volunteer things!!Judge:\nMr. Quist, tell us the truth this time... And I mean the whole truth! Were you or were you not waiting for Regina at the entrance to the lodging house?Trilo:\nI was! I was waiting to propose to her!!Judge:\nYou were what!? Waiting to... propose!?Trilo:\nWhat's the matter!? You think that humans have a monopoly on marriage!?Judge:\nThat... The matter of puppet marriage is not under review in this case!Trilo:\nYou're the judge! I mean, look at your horrible outfit!!Ben:\nMORE PAIN!!von Karma:\nHmph. Thanks to your bumbling, my perfect plan is not so perfect anymore! Now we have to waste time getting to the bottom of some silly proposal by a puppet!!Witness Testimony-- About the Proposal --Trilo:\nDon't be so surprised that I was going to propose to Regina!\nI even had something to give to her...\nI kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her.\nOf course, I also had it in my pocket that night. It was a present for her.\nIn the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!Judge:\nYou were going to propose... You... A puppet...Trilo:\nDon't be so obtuse! Just because I'm a puppet doesn't mean I can't love!Judge:\nI guess you're right... Just because I'm old doesn't mean I couldn't propose to her too!Trilo:\nExactly!Phoenix:\n(His Honor is looking a little less than honorable right now...)Judge:\nOK, Mr. Wright...

There's got to be something I can catch him on...Trilo:\nI kept it in my pocket, waiting for the chance to propose and give it to her.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho's pocket was the ring in?\nTrilo:\nMine of course! What a stupid question!! You've got to be kidding me! You think Ben could pull that off!?\nBen:\nI-I'm s-s-sorry... R-R-Really...\nTrilo:\nYou don't have to apologize for that!! He's the one who should be apologizing!!\nPhoenix:\n(Really?)Present Ring (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Trilo, do you mind if I show you something?\"Trilo:\nOf course, I also had it in my pocket that night. It was a present for her.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you went to the lodging house to give it to her?\nTrilo:\nThat's right! I tried to give it to her during practice so many times that I lost count, but... That uppity snob kept getting in the way!\nMax:\nUppity snob!? He couldn't possibly be talking about me... Maximillion Galactica! When I get a hold of him, I'm gonna saw his wood block in half... And not with magic!!\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWell... They always say that love creates rivalries.\nJudge:\nSo what about this present?Present Ring (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Trilo, do you mind if I show you something?\"Trilo:\nIn the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you are still thinking of trying to give it to Regina...?\nTrilo:\nOf course I am! I spent three months salary on this thing! I'm not gonna give up that easily!\nMaya:\nHmm, I wonder how much he receives for appearing in the circus?\nPhoenix:\nProbably way more than he deserves.Present Ring (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Trilo, do you mind if I show you something?\"Maya:\nHow about it Nick?Phoenix:\nI think it's time to unwrap this toy's testimony.Maya:\nThat's the spirit Nick! Give him heck!Phoenix:\n(The judge has that dazed and confused look again. Maybe he should get out more.) (Changed from [Uh oh, the judge has that dazed look again. Maybe he should get out more.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nTrilo, do you mind if I show you something?Ben:\nWhat is it?Trilo:\nWhat are you talking about!?Phoenix:\n(Uh oh... Looks like they're going to double team me now...) Do you recognize this ring?Trilo:\nAh! That's... That's... That's mine!! Give it back! Thief! Thief!Phoenix:\nDidn't you just testify about this very object? I believe you said... \"In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!\" Why then, do I have it right here...?Trilo:\nAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGHHHHH!!Judge:\nWhat is going on here!?Trilo:\nThat's... That's... Ben! Say something!!Ben:\nEh? Don't put me on the spot like that Trilo!!Phoenix:\nI found this in Money's room...Judge:\nM-M-Money's room? You mean a room they put money, like a bank vault?Trilo:\nHah! That filthy monkey is gonna get what's coming to him!!Judge:\nMr. Quist, I would prefer if you avoided slandering innocent fiats in my court.Phoenix:\nWell, Your Honor... Money really is a monkey... In every sense of the word.Judge:\nAh. I see... Well then...Phoenix:\nMoney likes to go after the shiniest things that he can find and gather them up.Judge:\nShiny... Things?Phoenix:\nTrilo! When was this ring stolen from you?Ben:\nWell... I suppose it was... That time... You know... That night... The night of the crime...von Karma:\nWhat did you just say!?Phoenix:\nDetails... I need more details...Ben:\nWell... It was stolen right after Max showed up in the plaza...Phoenix:\nRight about when you saw the defendant walk past, correct?Ben:\nWell... Umm... I guess you... Might... Umm... Be able to say that... The ring might have... Well... It could have been... Taken around that time...???:\nOooo-Ooooh!Ben:\nAhhhhh... Yeowwwwwwwww... Ohhhhhhhhhh...Trilo:\nBen! What's with you!? ... Oh, whatever... It has nothing to do with anything! Especially not who committed the murder!!Phoenix:\nIt's not for you to decide what has to do with what! Now, Trilo! Back to the topic at hand!Trilo:\nI haven't admitted a thing! Not I... Mr. Trilo Quist!Phoenix:\nWhat did you do when the ring was taken, Trilo?Trilo:\nYou know exactly what I did! I chased after that ring snatching monkey Money!!Phoenix:\nBut you weren't able to catch up with him, were you?Trilo:\nIt's all this slow loafy fool called Ben's fault! While he was fumbling his way through the snow, that dumb monkey was able to get away!Judge:\nThat is indeed an incredible shame.Phoenix:\nWell... This does indeed prove one very important point.von Karma:\nProve an important point!? What point could that possibly be?Ben doesn't exercise enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nObviously that one Mr. Benjamin Woodman is lacking in the area of exercise!!\nJudge:\n...\nvon Karma:\n...\nTrilo:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThis is clear from the testimony we have just listened to!! He was too slow and awkward to catch a monkey fleeing through the snow!!! (This revelation doesn't seem to be registering too well around the courtroom...)\nMaya:\nMaybe you should leave the courtroom drama for video games and rethink that one...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... OK.\nLeads back to:\n\"Well... This does indeed prove one very important point.\"Ben's testimony has a flaw.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is a huge contradiction in this witness's testimony!\"Phoenix:\nThere is a huge contradiction in this witness's testimony!von Karma:\nCo-Contradiction!?Phoenix:\nThe witness just testified to the following effect -- Up until the police arrived, he didn't move from the entrance to the plaza. HOWEVER! The witness just stated that he chased after Money the monkey. When the witness was off chasing Money, there was no one watching the plaza!von Karma:\nWhat is the meaning of all this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!? Where are you going with this little theory of yours?Phoenix:\nI'm saying that there is no possible way that this witness saw the plaza the entire time! That's where I'm going with this little theory! Which leads me to my next point. It is entirely possible that someone other than the defendant was at the scene!Judge:\nInteresting, Mr. Wright.von Karma:von Karma:\nWell then tell me this, Mr. Phoenix Wright!! Do you have any proof that something slipped past this vigilant ventriloquist?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nWell, he obviously didn't see the victim, the Ringmaster, arrive on the scene!von Karma:\nHowever, that doesn't change the fact that he saw the defendant arrive!Phoenix:\nThe witness is lying! He is blinded by his rivalry with Max!Judge:\nWell... The defense's argument does hold water. This witness does have a history of animosity towards the defendant.Trilo:\nWhat!? How dare you!? I wouldn't lie just to get that dorkface in trouble! He's not even worth it!! I saw him! No doubt about it! I saw that worthless liar!Judge:\nWell... Just for clarity's sake, let's flesh out exactly who you saw on that night.Trilo:\nHah! I've told you so many times, you'd think you'd know my story's not changing!Phoenix:\n(You've already changed your story, stick boy! And I'm sure it will change some more.)Maya:\nWhere there is one lie, there are usually many more behind it.Phoenix:\nExactly, Maya. That's why we have to keep after him!Maya:\nYeah!Witness Testimony-- Witnessing Max --Trilo:\nI'll give you that I was waiting that night for Regina.\nBut that doesn't change the fact that I saw Max in the plaza that night!\nHe showed up after I had been waiting there for about five minutes.\nI said \"good evening\" to him, but he didn't even acknowledge my presence!\nI'm absolutely sure it was him! I saw Maximillion Galactica at the scene!!\nThere's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!Judge:\nHmm...von Karma:\nSo that means that Money didn't show up until after you saw Max?Trilo:\nThat's right. Money ran up less than a minute after I saw Max.Phoenix:\nThen Money snatched the ring, and you went chasing after him?Judge:\nHow long was it until you came back to where you were waiting?Trilo:\nWell. Let's see... I'd say about...Ben:\nI suppose five minutes. I think...von Karma:\nSo the victim could have arrived on the scene in that five minute stretch.Judge:\nMr. Wright, please proceed with your cross-examination.Cross Examination",

That means you probably wouldn't have noticed if someone else showed up.\nTrilo:\nYou should think about how many eyes I actually have. I've got four, you know! Four. F-O-U-R. Counting Ben of course... With that many eyes, do you really think something would have slipped by me?\nJudge:\nFour eyes is an awful lot of attention directed at one area, I suppose...\nPhoenix:\n(Yikes! The judge is even more dangerous to our case than Trilo!)Trilo:\nBut that doesn't change the fact that I saw Max in the plaza that night!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw Max coming out of the Big Top that night?\nTrilo:\nOf course that's where I saw him coming from! I was staring at the entrance to the tent the entire time!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that makes sense, especially since he was waiting for Regina.)Trilo:\nHe showed up after I had been waiting there for about five minutes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout what time would you say these events took place?\nTrilo:\nYou're one of the dumbest people on the planet if you can't figure it out yourself! You already know that practice finished promptly at 10 PM! And you already know that I went to the lodging house right after practice! You don't need to be a brain surgeon to know around what time it was when I saw him... Just add ten more minutes! I'm sure you can do that! Now what time was it?\nJudge:\nIndeed, what time was it?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... What time was it? Lemme think about that for a second......... ...YEOW!! I'm no good at math!\nvon Karma:\n*sigh* It was 10:10 PM!\nJudge:\nAhhh, yes. That sounds about right!\nTrilo:\nIt sounds about right because that's the time that I saw Max on the scene!Trilo:\nI said \"good evening\" to him, but he didn't even acknowledge my presence!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you testified that you said \"good evening\" to Max that night.\nTrilo:\nYou must enjoy asking incredibly obvious questions! You say \"good morning\" in the morning, and \"good afternoon\" during the day, right? And it's obvious that I'd say \"good night\" to someone at night!!\nBen:\n...\nTrilo:\nWhat Ben!? You've got something to add!? Lemme guess... \"That's not it Trilo! You say 'good evening' at night!\"\nBen:\nAh... I'm sorry Trilo...\nJudge:\nMr. Quist, I would prefer if you kept your ventriloquist's act outside of the courtroom!\nTrilo:\nImpossible! A performer lives and breathes his performances!

It strikes me as somewhat strange.\nTrilo:\nWhy would it strike you as strange?\nvon Karma:\nExactly! How is it strange to be cordial to one of your coworkers?\nPhoenix:\nWell... If it was simply just being cordial to a coworker I would understand... OWW!! That hurt!!\nvon Karma:\nMaybe you should think of having some proof before your lips start flapping next time! Proof is everything in this world! You should have learned that back in grade school!!\nPhoenix:\n(There's no reason that Trilo would ever say something nice to Max...

I'm sure that if a pro was to review your work, he would say... OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nYou're not trying to pass yourself off as a professional performer, are you? Don't get so wrapped up in yourself, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You! Should know! Better!\nPhoenix:\nOW! OWWW! AWWWWWW! THAT HURTS!!\nvon Karma:\nThat should have set him straight!

You didn't have to join in did you!?\nMaya:\nBut... It's fun shouting out with everyone else!!Maya:\nThere has to be a hole in his testimony somewhere.Phoenix:\nI agree. But do we have the proof to make something stick?Maya:\nAll we can do is try, right Nick!? We've gotta have something that will prove useful.Phoenix:\nAll right, time to go to work.Phoenix:\nTrilo, is it not true that you had a fight with Max on the day of the murder?von Karma:\nA fight?Phoenix:\nA fight over Regina to be exact.Trilo:\nIt wasn't that big of a deal! It was just an argument... A disagreement at most!Phoenix:\nA disagreement usually doesn't end with someone getting clonked over the head...Trilo:\nAHHHH!!Phoenix:\nThat morning, Ben got clobbered over the head by Max, didn't he?Judge:\nWh-What? Is that an admission of assault and battery? OUCH!!von Karma:\nBefore we handle that, we should wrap up the defendant's murder charge first!Phoenix:\nThe truth is that on the day of the crime, the defendant and witness had a huge fight! There is absolutely no way they would have suddenly become cordial that evening! Moreover, just consider the personality of the witness on stand! There is no way a puppet this lewd would just up and say \"good evening\" to his rival!Trilo:\nGWWAAAAHHHH!!von Karma:von Karma:\nAre you saying this witness is lying!? That he is trying to frame the defendant by claiming to have seen him at the crime scene!?Trilo:\nI-I-I... I didn't tell a single lie! Honestly! I just...Judge:\nThat's enough from you Mr. Quist! Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Judge:\nLet's clarify this testimony for the court... Could you explain your theory about who the witness actually saw that night?He didn't see anyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course, the witness did not see a soul that night.\nJudge:\nI see...\nTrilo:\nWho... Who do you think you are to just up and decide what it is I saw that night!?\nvon Karma:\nA fool can only understand a foolish foolery uttered by the most foolish of fools. The witness \"didn't see anyone\"... You wouldn't happen to have proof to back up that statement, would you?\nPhoenix:\n*gulp*\nMaya:\nNick, I just thought of something... If Ben and Trilo really didn't see anyone that night, they wouldn't have testified that they greeted someone that night, would they?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What do you mean?\nMaya:\nI think that Trilo really did say \"good evening\" to someone that night.\nPhoenix:\nBut... Trilo and Max... They were in the middle of a huge fight.\nJudge:\nMaybe you should think this over some more on your own time, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"Let's clarify this testimony for the court...\"He saw the defendant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course he saw the defendant! How could he miss Maximillion Galactica!? OWWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nYou said that Trilo would have no reason to greet Max if they had met that night! You said that, did you not!? Mr. Phoenix Wright!!\nPhoenix:\nAhh...\nvon Karma:\n\"Ahh...\" is not the correct answer!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! I'm afraid that \"Ahh\" has just landed the defense a penalty!\nPhoenix:\n(Foiled again...)\nMaya:\nNick, you've got to think about things a bit more and give it another shot!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know... (And by the looks of things I've gotta hurry up!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Let's clarify this testimony for the court...\"He saw a different person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It is my belief that the witness did indeed see someone that night...\"Phoenix:\nIt is my belief that the witness did indeed see someone that night... It was just someone else! That's who he said \"good evening\" to.von Karma:\nWhat kind of theory is that!?Phoenix:\nThe correct one. Furthermore, I don't believe the person the witness saw was Max at all.von Karma:\nWh-What!?Phoenix:\nIf he had truly met Max that night, there would have been no greeting at all. Which means there is only one proper answer. The person the witness saw that night was not Maximillion Galactica. That is why Trilo made the effort to greet whoever it was that he saw that evening. Or \"good evening\" as he put it.Trilo:\nUhh...von Karma:\nWhat in the world... You...Judge:\nWould the defense kindly explain who it was Trilo saw that evening then?Present Russell Berry profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Considering the ill temper of this witness, there is only one person he would greet!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is the person that this witness felt the need to greet that night!\nJudge:\nHmm... How about it, Mr. Quist?\nTrilo:\nHow about you stop asking me these ridiculous questions! You can show me all the crappy pictures you'd like, there's not one I wouldn't greet!\nBen:\n...\nTrilo:\nWhat the oak are you doing, Woodman? You better not say, \"Trilo watch your mouth!\"\nBen:\nAhh... Well... OK. Sorry about that, Trilo.\nJudge:\nOrder! ORDER! There will be order in my courtroom! Mr. Wright!!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh, now I've done it!)\nJudge:\nYou better rethink this line of questioning before I lose my patience with you!!\nLeads back to:\n\"Would the defense kindly explain who it was Trilo saw that evening then?\"Phoenix:\nConsidering the ill temper of this witness, there is only one person he would greet!Judge:\nIt must be Regina! It's Regina right!? She's so cute!!Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor, it is not Regina. If it was Regina, Trilo would have given her the engagement ring as a present.Judge:\nOh... Yeah... I suppose you've got a point there.von Karma:\nIt was Russell Berry. The victim himself, was it not?Phoenix:\nYou are correct. It was indeed Russell Berry.Trilo:\n...!Phoenix:\nThe person you saw that evening was the victim, the Ringmaster, Russell Berry. That's why you greeted him Trilo. Isn't that correct?Trilo:\n... *gulp*Phoenix:\nAnswer the question, Mr. Quist!Trilo:\nWAAAAHHHH!! AH!Judge:\nORDER! ORDER! How do you respond to this!?Trilo:\nWa-Wait a second!! Well, at first I thought it was the old man! But! But! Once I got a better look at him, it was obviously Maximillion Galactica!Judge:\nI think it is high time that we clear the air about this question! Mr. Quist obviously witnessed a single person in the area of the plaza that evening. The problem is identifying exactly who that person was... Was it Maximillion Galactica? Or was it the Ringmaster, one Mr. Russell Berry?von Karma:\nThe prosecution argues that it was the defendant that the witness saw that night! The witness has clearly stated that he saw the defendant's three symbols!Phoenix:\nThree symbols?Trilo:\nAlright... This is getting old. C'mon man! You've gotta remember them by now!! Here we go again! Everyone... All together now!! OWWWWW!!von Karma:\nYes, yes... We know... The silk hat, cloak, and white roses...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nA silk hat and a cloak! Anyone could wear them! They'd even look good on me!von Karma:\nWhat was that!?Phoenix:\nWell, the witness has endlessly repeated that he saw Max's three symbols... However, how do we really know it was Maximillion Galactica? It could have been someone else, dressed up as him. Possibly even Russell Berry!von Karma:\nWHAT!?Judge:\nMs. von Karma.von Karma:\n...Judge:\nDo you have clear evidence that the person the witness saw was the defendant?von Karma:\nWell... I...Judge:\nIf that's the case, then it is impossible for me to make a judgment at this point.Phoenix:\n(Yes! I think we've finally won a point in this one!!)von Karma:\n... That is very... Unfortunate.Phoenix:\nHuh?von Karma:\nYou're just a little too excited for your own good, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:\nWhat do you mean by that?von Karma:\nYou merely established one thing from this witness. You established that this witness saw one person in the plaza that night. I applaud you on your effort, but...Judge:\nBut...?von Karma:\nWho that person was can only be answered by the next witness!Phoenix:\nHUH!?von Karma:\nYour Honor, the prosecution will provide, beyond a shadow of a doubt, an answer to that question, and evidence that clearly establishes one thing. That there is no one other than Maximillion Galactica responsible for this crime!Judge:\nVery well. The court will take a 10 minute recess. During that time, I request the prosecution prepare their next witness. Court is now in recess!To be continued.December 29, 11:54 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 5Max:\nSw-Sweetie! You have to believe me! I didn't go anywhere near that crime scene!Maya:\nSo then, where were you when the murder took place?Max:\nWe talked about it yesterday, remember? I was in the Ringmaster's room!Phoenix:\nAnd while you were there, it was the Ringmaster who left the room, right?Max:\nExactly. He told me to wait in the room because he would \"be right back\".Maya:\nThat's when the Ringmaster headed to the scene of the crime... Right?Phoenix:\nThat's what it seems like.Maya:\nBut... The Ringmaster must've been wearing Max's costume. Right?Max:\nOh! Sweetie! I just remembered! I went straight to the Ringmaster's room still dressed in my stage clothes. But when I got there, I went ahead and took the costume off.Maya:\nWhich means?Phoenix:\nIt means that the Ringmaster could have taken his costume, and went out looking like Max!Max:\nFABULOUS! That's a fabulously possible possibility!Maya:\nHeh Heh... Well done, Nick.Max:\nHowever, sweetie... Why would the Ringmaster want to dress up like me? Isn't that a bit strange?Phoenix:\nHmm...Max:\nIf you think about it, all they found at the crime scene was my silk hat. What about my cloak? Where did that go?Phoenix:\nDouble hmm...Maya:\nWow Max. I never thought of that. You should be a detective or something!Max:\nWell, I was never quite sure what to be when I grew up... Magician or President? You have no idea how hard it was to make a decision!Maya:\nThat's really cool...Phoenix:\n(Fabulous... This mystery just keeps getting deeper...)December 29, 12:06 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nNow that everyone is back, let's get started. The court is now back in session. Ms. von Karma, please proceed with the prosecution's case.von Karma:\nVery well... I will now call my next witness. A pitiful clown with the unfortunate distinction of having seen the entire thing. Will Mr. Lawrence Curls please take the stand!Phoenix:\n(Why did she just call him a \"pitiful\" clown?)von Karma:\nThe witness will state his name and occupation for the court record.Moe:\n...von Karma:\n...Moe:\n... In West Clownadelphia, born and raised, on the playground is where I spent my clowin...von Karma:\n... Name and occupation.Judge:\nWill the witness please inform the court why he is speaking autobiographical gibberish?Moe:\nO-Oh... I-I'm sorry... I'm just not used to being in court. I've never been in a courtroom in my life. I wasn't quite sure what joke is best suited to this sort of occasion.Judge:\nWhat in the world are you talking about!? You're in a grand hall of justice, not some comedy club! Since it's easy to see your occupation, please state your name for the court.Moe:\n... Oh... Yeah... Maybe this joke is OK... \"Mom, do I have to wear pants?\" \"The sign only says no shirt, no shoes, no service.\" Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!.....................Moe:\nOK! OK! How about this? \"Have you met my proctologist? Dr. Seymour Butts!!\" How was that one!? Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! ...But a couple of clowns who were up to no good...

Professional funnyman, also known as Moe the clown.von Karma:\nYou witnessed the scene at around 10:15 PM the day of the murder. Correct?Moe:\nYes... Yes it is.Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Curls. Will you please testify to what you saw that evening?Moe:\nA rabbi, a priest, and a Rastafarian walked into this plaza...Judge:\nWithout the humor please.Moe:\nOK...Maya:\nAww... Poor Moe can't be his normal stoogey self in court.Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Moe:\nI know... I know... I'm not the greatest comedian in the world...\nI haven't been able to make people laugh for 10 years!\nNo matter what I say, all I get in return is a vacant stare and polite applause.\nSince no one ever laughs at my jokes, I've taken to laughing at them myself.\nIt's a bad habit, but hey, at least I'm trying!!\nImagine my predicament! I'm a clown who can't make people laugh!! I'm almost useless!\nBut I keep trying... I even tried to come up with jokes just for today!!\nBut this atmosphere is very nerve-racking! I decided to try making everyone laugh!\nSeriously... Everyone... What do you think of me? How am I doing?Judge:\n...von Karma:\n...Phoenix:\nUmm... Aren't we the ones supposed to be asking the questions here?von Karma:\nWitness...Moe:\nHuh?von Karma:\nWe will listen to your call for help after the court proceedings are over. Thus, please stick with the facts of this case.Moe:\nReally!? You'll really hear me out!?von Karma:\nWell, I'll make sure that one of my staff will be your straight man later.Moe:\nThank you!! Thank you!! I can't wait!!Phoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)Judge:\nNow that that's settled, shall we begin once again with the testimony!?Moe:\nOf course we can! I'll talk for as long as you want!!Witness Testimony-- What You Witnessed --Moe:\nThe night of the murder, after practice was over, I went straight back to my room.\nYou have no idea how tired I was that night. I was pooped.\nI thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window.\nThat's when I saw two silhouettes! They were a bit far away though!\nIt was the Ringmaster, and he was with Max, who was wearing his cloak!\nI kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!Judge:\nThat's very interesting... If this eyewitness account is to be believed, I have enough to pass judgment right now...von Karma:\nOf course you can! There is no way that this account can be criticized.Judge:\nHowever... The witness is a bit, how do you say, \"off-kilter\"... Almost like he has some sort of atmosphere of guilt surrounding him.Moe:\nAha! Aha! Aha! That must be because of my insincere smile...Judge:\nMr. Wright, please begin the defense's cross-examination.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Maya:\nNick! You've gotta find some kind of contradiction in his testimony!Phoenix:\nI know that!Judge:\nMr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYour Honor?Judge:\nI'm afraid that if you push this witness too far, it would bring disaster upon the court. Thus, I sincerely hope you are not going to engage in pointless saber-rattling.Phoenix:\nI understand, Your Honor.von Karma:\nIf you cause this clown to stray from the facts, I'll hold you responsible!Phoenix:\n(Why am I responsible!?

Now eight o'clock... That's something a clown can riff off of... Let's just pretend it was eight o'clock... That way I can make a great joke!\n\n\n\nLet's not...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLet's not make it 8:00 PM, alright Moe?\nMoe:\nWhat do you mean let's not! Don't take the clown out of the clowning around!\nMaya:\nC'mon Nick, just listen to his joke!\nPhoenix:\nThere are three reasons why I don't want to... One, I probably won't laugh. Two, I'll get hit with a penalty. Three, I'll get whipped. Will the witness just proceed with his factual testimony...\nMaya:\nYou are sooo boring.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAlright, eight o'clock then...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoe:\nYou know you want to hear the joke... A man goes to his doctor and the doctor asks, \"How is number 1?\" The man says \"Everyday at six.\" The doctor asks, \"And 2?\" The man says \"Everyday at seven.\" \"Then what's the matter?\" \"I slept til eight.\"\nvon Karma:\nWitness! These are exactly the type of jokes you should save for Gumshoe!\nPhoenix:\n... OWWW!!\nvon Karma:\nYou knew what would happen! Don't look at me like that!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, you're hereby penalized! This will not become a kangaroo court!\nPhoenix:\n(This isn't funny at all... In more ways that* ([sic]) one...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationMoe:\nYou have no idea how tired I was that night. I was pooped.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were \"pooped\" that night?\nMoe:\nYes. I was very very tired... Not to mention I had some bad Mexican food.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMoe:\nThe double cheese double bean enchilada is a dangerous menu item... What happened after that, as they say, \"happens\"... Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! That one was cool, huh? I hear the kids really love toilet humor these days...\nPhoenix:\nThat joke was so hip, I don't want to ruin it with a reply.\nJudge:\nI've got a good reply though. That joke was so funny it just earned you a penalty!Moe:\nI thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou just happened to glance out of the window?\nMoe:\nYou could say that. You could also say I peeked, stared, glimpsed, peeped, eyeballed...\nJudge:\nMr. Curls!!\nMoe:\nOh... I guess synonyms aren't allowed either...\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? I wonder if I should press him further on this issue...)\n\n\n\nLet it rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nVery well, Moe. How about we get back to your testimony now?\nJudge:\nThis is definitely one of your more straightforward cross-examinations, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Of course! You threatened me with a penalty if I don't keep this stooge in check!)\n\n\n\n\nKeep pressing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nExactly why did you look out of your window that night?\nMoe:\nWhy!? Why!? Clowns don't need a reason to look out their windows, do they!?\nPhoenix:\nThat's not what I meant. I meant that... Well... When we spoke yesterday...\n\n\nMoe:\nOnce I had tucked myself into bed, I heard this amazing noise. It was incredibly loud. It sounded like a giant \"THUMP\"!\n\n\nMoe:\n... Oh yeah! I forgot about that!!\nvon Karma:\nYou... forgot!?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, the witness looked out of his window upon hearing a loud sound. He did not just simply \"glance\" out of his window that night.\nMoe:\nOh yeah! That's right! I forgot to mention that \"THUMP\" didn't I? Owwy Oww Oww...\nvon Karma:\nThat's not something you just \"forget to mention\"!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Yeah... What she said... I believe it would be best if Moe were to revise his testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Mr. Curls. Please revise your testimony.\nPhoenix:\n(This should start turning the tables in our favor!)\nChanges statement from \"I thought I'd go straight to sleep, but before I did, I glanced out the window.\" to \"I heard a huge noise outside the window, and that's what made me take a look outside...\"Moe:\nI heard a huge noise outside the window, and that's what made me take a look outside...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was the sound like?\nMoe:\nWell... I guess it kinda sounded like... Hmm... I guess you could say...\nJudge:\nMr. Curls. May the court remind you that humor is unnecessary.\nMoe:\nDoh! How'd you know that I was gonna make a joke! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! I guess that the sound sounded like a... I suppose it sounded like someone getting hit with something very hard... Yep. That's what it sounded like. Honestly.\nJudge:\n\"Someone getting hit...\" huh?\nvon Karma:\nWhat then? You went to look out the window and you saw...Moe:\nThat's when I saw two silhouettes! They were a bit far away though!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nFar away you say... If you had to say exactly, how far away were they?\nMoe:\nLet me think about that for a second... If my room is here... And they looked about yay-big... I'd say they were about 30 feet from my window.\nvon Karma:\nJust 30 feet? That's not far at all!\nMoe:\nIt was snowing that night, and it cut down on visibility.\nJudge:\nI see. Please continue with your testimony regarding the two shadows that you saw.Moe:\nIt was the Ringmaster, and he was with Max, who was wearing his cloak!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou'd say you clearly saw this? Even though you were, by your own admission, far away?\nMoe:\nThat's right. I had been thinking about it over and over since that night, but things didn't really make sense until I spoke with the prosecutor, Ms. von Karma. But now I am 100% certain that it was Max and the Ringmaster that I saw that night. Just think about it? How could I be wrong if Max is always wearing his uppity symbols?\nPhoenix:\nUppity symbols?\nMoe:\nLawyers nowadays!! Do you even have to go to school anymore to be one? Alright! Everyone knows what to do!! Altogether now!! Say it with Uncle Moe!\n.....................\nMoe:\n... See what I mean!! It's always like this! The crown never wants to go along with me! I must really be utterly and completely worthless as a clown... Yeowza!\nvon Karma:\nEnough foolishness, get back on track!\nJudge:\nWill the witness please testify as to what he saw... And only what he saw!Moe:\nI kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou say you saw the Ringmaster get \"clonked\" over the head!?\nMoe:\nYes, I did!! It's the climax of my story!\nPhoenix:\n(He really does enjoy the completely random non sequitur...) What would you say the victim was struck with?\nMoe:\nYou mean weapon? I have no idea. A weapon wasn't found at the murder scene, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's not what I meant... You did say you did see \"everything\", didn't you? (Changed from [No no no... You did say you saw the entire thing, didn't you?] in the original release)\nMoe:\nWell... I, umm... Yeah, I suppose I did. Wait... No I didn't. I didn't see a weapon... Heh heh heh!\nPhoenix:\nMoe! Did you or did you not see the crime of murder committed that night!?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nI will not permit you to harass my witness in this manner! You'd better have an excellent reason for attacking this poor, poor clown. Because if you don't... You know what is waiting for you... A nice penalty!\nPhoenix:\n*gulp* (Wasn't that a bit melodramatic...)\nvon Karma:\nSo what will it be then, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Do you have any clear basis to believe that my witness did not see the crime?\n\n\n\nOf course I don't!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell... See... Right now, I don't have a clear basis to be thinking that...\nvon Karma:\nThen this is just another one of your pointless efforts to badger my witness! Thus, you have just earned yourself a penalty... FROM ME!!\nJudge:\nNow wait a second Ms. von Karma! This time, I do not feel the need to treat Mr. Wright so harshly.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right! What he said! (Bailed out by the judge! What an honor indeed!)\nJudge:\nIf we must penalize Mr. Wright for his display, I think a verbal censure would be best.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nJudge:\nYou know the rules Mr. Wright. There is no room for baseless hounding in this courtroom.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he didn't really bail me out after all...)\nLeads back to cross-exmaination\n\n\n\n\nOf course I do! (before changing third statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course I have grounds to make this claim!\nvon Karma:\nThen let's hear it!\nPhoenix:\nThat's something I can't share with you at this time.\nJudge:\nW-W-What did you just say!? Mr. Wright!!\nPhoenix:\n(I know there's something wrong with this testimony... But I can't put why I feel this way into words for the Judge...)\nMaya:\nMaybe we should get a bit more information... Once we find something more solid, we can give it another shot!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you're right...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, before we resume testimony, you know that you must be penalized.\nPhoenix:\n(Yikes. That's harsh...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nOf course I do! (after changing third statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I've got a great reason to make my claim!\"Maya:\nYou know... Moe's testimony and what he told us yesterday are kinda different...Phoenix:\nYeah I noticed. We've just got to pinpoint what's changed.Maya:\nYou can do it, Nick!Phoenix:\nI've got a great reason to make my claim!von Karma:\nAnd I suppose you will be telling us all that \"great\" reason?Phoenix:\nOf course I will... The reason is... The witness' very own testimony!Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of that Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nMoe said that he heard a sound like a \"thump\" of someone getting hit.Judge:\nHmm... He did say that.Phoenix:\nHowever, Moe just stated the following under oath.Moe:\nI kept watching them, and all of a sudden, Max clonked the Ringmaster over the head!Phoenix:\nIf Moe is to be believed when he says he looked out the window upon hearing a sound, there is no way that he could have seen Max \"clonk\" anyone!Moe:\nIn 1972, a crack clown unit was sent to prison by a circus court for a crime...Judge:\nMr. Curls! How do you respond to Mr. Wright's assessment!!?Moe:\n...they didn't commit. These clowns promptly escaped from a maximum security clown car...Judge:\nMr. Curls, are you reciting the C-Team theme to anger this court?Moe:\nNo no no... I'm just stalling for time while I jog my memory...Maya:\nGreat job, Nick!Phoenix:\nThese types of witnesses always seem to have a selective memory... You just have to peel back the layers of the clown make-up to find the truth.Moe:\nWell... Umm...Judge:\nAhh, you're back from your jog?Moe:\nWell... It pretty much happened the way I said.Phoenix:\n\"Pretty much\"...?Moe:\nWhen I looked out my window that night, the Ringmaster was already face down in the snow. The prosecution helped me fill in the gaps of my statement.Phoenix:\n(Von... Von Karma!! Tampering with witnesses again!!)von Karma:\n...Judge:\nSo now you are saying that you did not see the defendant \"clonk\" the Ringmaster?Moe:\nY-Yes... When I looked out my window, the Ringmaster had already checked out.Judge:\nChecked out?Moe:\nYep. He was on permanent vacation as they say. Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!Judge:\nMr. Curls!!Moe:\nYour Honor?Judge:\nYou did not witness the actual crime; however, you still say you saw the criminal, correct?Moe:\nY-Y-YES!! Exactly! The Ringmaster was slumped over and I saw someone's silhouette next to him.Judge:\nVery well. Then please testify to this silhouette you saw... I expect the truth! And if I even catch a hint of a joke from you... I will put you in a holding cell until you learn court etiquette, got it!?Moe:\nGot it.Witness Testimony-- The Silhouette --Moe:\nI was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max.\nThere's no doubting it. Especially since I saw his uppity symbols.\nHis silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there!\nHis face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him.\nHis cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying.Judge:\nHmm... It does seem as if the defendant was at the scene of the crime.von Karma:\nIt took the clown long enough to get his facts straight. (Changed from [You took your time realizing that, didn't you!?] in the original release) But whatever. This should finally be good enough, yes? (Changed from [Whatever. That should be enough, right!?] in the original release)Judge:\nIt is decisive testimony...Maya:\nWas Max really at the crime scene that night...?Phoenix:\nHe said he wasn't there. We have to believe in that. (Changed from [He said he wasn't there. We have to keep believing that.] in the original release)Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright.

There's no way he could have missed them!von Karma:von Karma:\nThen the roses must have fallen off when the defendant assaulted the victim!Phoenix:\nIf that was the case, then the police would have found them near the crime scene!Judge:\nMr. Wright! Are these white roses truly material to the facts of this case?von Karma:\nClearly not! He is just toying with this court!Phoenix:\n... (I got her on the ropes now... These seemingly insignificant facts have never failed to lead me to the truth yet! (Changed from [Whenever there's a nugget of truth, it always seems to peek out at me... Then run away.] in the original release)) Someone is toying with the court, but it's not me! Your Honor! Do you recall Trilo's testimony?Trilo:\nThere's no way I could mistake someone wearing those three ridiculous symbols!Trilo:\nHow can you mistake someone with that crazy get-up and his nose stuck up so high...Trilo:\nHow could you mistake someone wearing such a snobby 3 piece get-up!Phoenix:\nTrilo saw them all! Trilo saw all three of Max's symbols! However, this witness claims there were no white roses on the person he saw! There is absolutely no doubt that this is a contradiction!Judge:\nHmm... Now what am I supposed to think? One is supposed to disregard the pointless, but this...von Karma:\nJudge! Forget the roses! Think about his other testimony! The witness has stated without a doubt that he saw Maximillion Galactica! Nothing else matters! Let's wrap this case up now!Phoenix:\nYour Honor! It may be trivial, but it does cast doubt on the prosecution's case. (Changed from [Your Honor! It may be trivial, but there should still be doubt lingering in your mind!] in the original release)Judge:\n... Frankly, I have my doubts about this witness. It seems that, unlike wine, the witness has not grown more mature with age.Moe:\nI'm not... mature...Judge:\nI've come to a conclusion... I'm 99% certain that this witness saw the defendant. However! My remaining one percent of doubt is quite reasonable! Which means that for my peace of mind, I'm going to request a bit more testimony.von Karma:\nW-What!?Judge:\nIf there are no contradictions in his next statement, I am prepared to issue a ruling.Phoenix:\n(A ruling...!!)Maya:\nNick! This is your last chance!Witness Testimony-- The Silhouette, Part 2 --Moe:\nThere's no doubt in my mind! There were no white roses that night!\nHowever, all of the other symbols were there... I'm equally sure of that.\nEspecially the silk hat! There is no way I could forget seeing the decorations on it!\nHe was wearing it the entire time that he was on the scene!Judge:\nMr. Wright... You've got one last chance at this.Phoenix:\nJust one chance?Judge:\nI will not allow even the slightest hint of badgering against this witness. If you are going to prove to me there's a contradiction with Mr. Curls' statement, you'd better have at least a shred of evidence to back up your accusations.Phoenix:\n(I've only got a single shot as [sic] this... I've got to be careful.) I understand, Your Honor. One chance is all I will need!Cross Examination",

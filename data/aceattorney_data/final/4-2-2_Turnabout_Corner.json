You die.\nJune 15, 9:12 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nApollo:\n(Two months have passed since Mr. Gavin's arrest. My first trial, and I lost both my mentor and my job. Yeah, I'll admit it. I was screwed. But even when I hit bottom, I told myself I'd never come here. Honest. Here being the legendary Wright & Co. Law Offices. OK, Justice, time to stop trembling.)\n???:\nAh! You must be here for the interview. Right this way.\nApollo:\nHuh?\n???:\nHello there! You've found the Wright place! Welcome!\nApollo:\nUh... Ah... (What's with this girl!?)\n???:\nWell now, shall we begin?\nApollo:\nBegin... what?\n???:\nRight, first things first... Any special talents?\nApollo:\nErm, talents?\n???:\nYes, well, you must have at least one!\nApollo:\nWell... Uh... I guess... Defending?\n???:\n\"Defending\"... An unusual talent, but it'll do. With a little jazzing up, of course.\nApollo:\nY-You think so...?\n???:\nLet's give it a go, shall we?\nApollo:\nHuh?\n???:\nGo ahead! Show me! Defend! Just give it all you've got. Don't hold back now!\nApollo:\nWh-What are you talking about? I can't just \"defend\" here!\n???:\nFirst lesson: A professional can perform anywhere!\nApollo:\n...Thanks.\n???:\nWe want people to be laughing with us... ...not at us!\nApollo:\n...Thanks. But I'm not sure why they should be laughing at all.\n???:\nWhat...? What exactly do you think you came here to do?\nApollo:\nWhat? Um, defend... No?\n???:\n... Excuse me, but do you know where you are?\nApollo:\nHuh!? The Wright & Co. Law Offices, right?\n???:\n...Oh. I was afraid of that. Don't worry, you're not the first.\nApollo:\nLook, what's going on here? Who are you? I came here to meet with the person in charge...\n???:\nWell, you've apparently made no fewer than two mistakes.\nApollo:\nMistakes? But I got a call from Mr. Wright this morning!\n???:\nPerhaps you should go read the sign out front again?\nApollo:\nWhat's there to read!? Look, it says right there... ...Oh. Why does it say \"Wright Talent Agency\"...?\n???:\nWelcome to the Wright Talent Agency, where you've \"always come to the Wright place!\"\nTrucy:\nI'm Trucy Wright, CEO. I'm a magician.\nApollo:\n(It all came flooding back... The trial... That girl...)\n???:\nHello, sir. Please, pick a card.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. She's my daughter.\nApollo:\nTrucy... Wright.\nTrucy:\nHere, check out our flyer! So... what's your name?\nApollo:\nApollo... Apollo Justice, attorney at law.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nApollo:\nOK... Which hospital is Mr. Wright in? I'll pay him a visit.\nTrucy:\nOh, the Hickfield Clinic. It's quite close.\nApollo:\nRight. Well, I'll be going now. And I'll, uh... give this showbiz gig some thought, OK?\nTrucy:\nWait! I'll go with you!\nJune 15, 9:45 AMHickfield Clinic\nApollo:\n(So... this is Mr. Wright's hospital...)\n???:\nEh? Visitors are ya? Hrmm?\nApollo:\nUh, yeah. Are you the... doctor?\nHickfield:\nAyup. Dr. Hickfield's the name. Eh he he.\nTrucy:\nGood morning, Doctor!\nHickfield:\nOh, hiya there, Trucy. Cute as ever! Eh he he.\nTrucy:\nIs... this Daddy's room?\nHickfield:\nOh yah. 'Cept he's gone for a mornin' checkup. Be back soon. How're you, Miss Trucy? Got any places you'd like... examined? Eh heh...\nPhoenix:\nDoctor... the nurse was looking for you.\nHickfield:\nWhy, if it isn't the Daddy o' the cutest lil' thing in town! Hrm. Hrmm. Guess I'll be off then. Eh he? Later, Trucy.\nApollo:\nWow, what an odd bird that guy was.\nPhoenix:\nGood morning. Didn't expect you so soon, Apollo.\nApollo:\nMr. Wright...\nAfter clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic:\nJune 15, 10:05 AMWright Talent Agency\n???:\nHey hey hey! How long you planning on making me wait, eh!?\nTrucy:\nAh! Good morning!\n???:\nHey there, Trucy-doll. Sounds like your pops had a bit of a rough spot, eh?\nTrucy:\nAll's well that ends well, I guess...\nApollo:\n(This... is our client?)\n???:\nHey! So this is that Pollo fellow, eh?\nApollo:\nOh, uh, y-yes? (The name's \"Apollo\".)\n???:\nLook at 'im there, arms all crossed-like. Ready to fight!\nApollo:\nYes, sir! ...You don't mean that literally, do you?\n???:\nThe boss told you what I need, right? Don't let me down now, Pollo!\nApollo:\nDon't worry about your defense sir, I'm on it!\n???:\nDefense...? Your noodle half-cooked? It's too late for defense! My castle's been stormed! My keep's been kept! My noodle stand's been stolen!\nApollo:\nN-Noodle...?\nTrucy:\nYou know Mr. Eldoon from the noodle stand, don'cha, Polly?\nApollo:\nNo nicknames, please. And no, of course I don't know him!\n???:\nYou new in these parts?\nApollo:\nNot really...\n???:\nThen you know the best noodles in town: Eldoon's Noodles!\nApollo:\nUh, whose noodles?\n???:\nMy noodles! Er, help me out here, Trucy-doll.\nTrucy:\nThis is Mr. Guy Eldoon... our client! Maybe you can tell us what the problem is, Mr. Eldoon?\nGuy:\nAnything for you, Trucy-doll!\nApollo:\nErm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er...\nTrucy:\nMy panties, yes.\nApollo:\nAh, er, right. Panties.\nGuy:\nThat's a cryin' shame, that is, Trucy-doll.\nTrucy:\nI was alone in the office last night. I had hung my panties out the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. \"Give those back!\" I shouted. \"Wait!\"\nApollo:\nWell, that was certainly brave of you.\nTrucy:\n...But I lost him. Without those panties, I don't know what I'll do...\nGuy:\nA darn cryin' shame, yup.\nTrucy:\nWell, at least the scene of the crime is convenient. I'll mark it on your map!\nGuy:\nI'll be headin' home now. Remember, find my stand or there's an empty bowl in yer future, Pollo!\nApollo:\nEr, right.\nGuy:\nAnd you help out Trucy-doll here, too, y'hear?\nTrucy:\nThings have certainly picked up, haven't they! We had no work yesterday, and now we have three cases!\nApollo:\nI... I guess.\nTrucy:\nLet's see where we stand!\nApollo:\n(Not in a courtroom, that's where.) Well, the first item on our list...\nTrucy:\nPhoenix Wright... Daddy's hit and run accident. We have to find the one who hit him!\nApollo:\n...Who's going to pay us for this again?\nTrucy:\nAnd the second item... Mr. Eldoon's request.. to find his stolen stand.\nApollo:\nFor which we stand to gain... a bowl of salty noodles...\nTrucy:\nAnd the last request is mine! To find my stolen panties!\nApollo:\n...That bowl of noodles is looking better and better.\nTrucy:\nLet's go, Polly! To the streets!\nApollo:\nAren't you enthusiastic.\nTrucy:\nHow could I not be!? Let's crack these cases, you and me!\nApollo:\n(*sigh* Guess we might as well get started... Let's see. A hit and run... a stolen stand... And last but not least... stolen panties.)\nAfter clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then visiting Wright Talent Agency:\nJune 15Hickfield Clinic\nApollo:\nHuh? Mr. Wright's gone.\nTrucy:\nMaybe he's gone for an examination?\nApollo:\nHe'll probably be back soon. Let's wait.\nTrucy:\nI think it might take some time. Daddy always loves his examinations!\nApollo:\n(Don't ask, Justice. You don't want to know.)\nTrucy:\nWhy don't we come back later?\nApollo:\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nWright Talent Agency\nJune 15Accident Scene\nApollo:\nSo this is where Mr. Wright got hit by that car?\nTrucy:\nAccording to the map, this is the place!\nApollo:\nWhat a huge mansion... (Changed from [What a huge mansion... Feels like Chinatown.] in the original release)\nTrucy:\nApollo! There's a nice-looking lady over there. Let's question her!\nApollo:\nUm, OK. (I'm a little curious about the park over there, too...)\nTrucy:\nExcuse me! Um, can we have a few words with you?\n???:\nYou want something?\nApollo:\n(Whoa! That husky voice... Why am I suddenly sweating?)\nTrucy:\nThat's quite a house you've got there! You must have a lot of money...\n???:\nWhoooh. \"Money\" sounds like something my son would call his friends. This is the Kitaki Family mansion, little girl.\nApollo:\nEh.\n???:\nYou, kid with the hair. You want something?\nApollo:\nUrk! M-M-Me? No, not a thing! Bye!\nTrucy:\nApollo! We can't leave without questioning her! What if she knows something!\nApollo:\nB-But th-the Kitaki Family...! (They're the biggest organized crime syndicate in town!)\n???:\nIf you're going to ask something, ask it. If you're man enough.\nApollo:\nWaaaaugh! R-Right!\nTrucy:\nYay! Way to whip him into shape, ma'am!\nApollo:\n(Does she know no fear!?)\nPlum:\nI'm Plum. Plum Kitaki. Wife of the fourth head of the Kitaki Family business. Friends call me Little Plum.\nApollo:\nI-I'm l-little Apollo Justice, attorney at law. *gulp* (If looks could kill, this woman would be a mass-murderer by now...)\nAfter switching to right side view:\nApollo:\nWho's that!? She's looking at the park.\nTrucy:\nShe's pretty. I bet she has a story, you know?\nApollo:\n(There is something about her... Too bad she seems to be in a bit of a rush.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\n???:\n...\nApollo:\n(...That girl from before!)\nPlum:\nOh! Welcome home, sweetie.\n???:\nAh, uh... hello, m-mother.\nApollo:\n(She's a Kitaki, too!?)\nTrucy:\nUh, um, Miss! Miss!\n???:\n...?\nTrucy:\nHere, our flyer.\n???:\nThe... Wright Anything Agency?\nApollo:\nA-Anything Agency?\nTrucy:\nYeah! Do you like the new flyer? So, um, this is our defense attorney, Mr. Apollo Justice!\n???:\nAttorney...?\nTrucy:\nDrop by our office! We'll be waiting!\n???:\nAh... Good-bye.\nApollo:\nWhy did you give her our flyer?\nTrucy:\nI dunno. She seemed like she could use some help.\nApollo:\nShe's the heiress to a gangster dynasty! She doesn't need our help!\nTrucy:\n...I wouldn't be so sure!\nApollo:\n...?\nJune 15Scene of the Stand Theft\nApollo:\nSo... what's this place?\nTrucy:\nThis would be Mr. Eldoon's house, silly.\nApollo:\nOh, so this is where his stand was stolen from. I can see a piece of evidence lying on the ground already.\nTrucy:\n...Hey! Look, there's a police car parked over there.\nApollo:\nYou're right... What's with the sparkly... entrance? What is this place? A hospital? There's a sign... \"Meraktis Clinic\".\nTrucy:\nHmm... Oh! That's where the thief went!\nApollo:\nThe thief...?\nTrucy:\nThe one who snatched my panties! He ran into this clinic last night! Wait, maybe that police car is here to find my panties!\nApollo:\nI doubt it.\nTrucy:\nWell, there's only one way to be sure! Let's investigate!\nGuy:\nAh, there you are, sonny! Well, you find anything yet!?\nApollo:\nEr, um, no. Not yet.\nGuy:\nThe longer you loaf around here the saltier your victory bowl gets, just remember that!\nApollo:\n(This bowl of noodles is sounding less like payment and more like punishment...)\nJune 15Meraktis ClinicGarage\nTrucy:\nThis is the place! This is where that panty-snatcher ran!\nApollo:\nAre you sure?\nTrucy:\nMaybe! Let's look for clues! Clues... to a panty-snatching! Clues... like a pair of panties!\nApollo:\n...Um, Trucy? Could you try not saying \"panties\" so many times?\nAfter examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door:\nTrucy:\nApollo!\nApollo:\nHuh? What is it?\nTrucy:\nNow that we've solved this case, we should go report to Daddy! He'll mope if we leave him alone too long, knowing him.\nApollo:\nUm, OK. ...He doesn't seem the type to mope, though. (And this is hardly a case worth reporting...)\nWright Anything Agency\nKitaki Mansion\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage:\nJune 15Hickfield Clinic\nPhoenix:\nYo! How goes it?\nTrucy:\nDaddy! How do you feel?\nPhoenix:\nNot bad, Trucy, not bad. It's good to have you young'uns on the case. Lets ol' Daddy-o get some well-deserved R&R.\nTrucy:\nThe elderly need their rest!\nApollo:\n(Uh... isn't he only 33?) ...Um, we've cleared up most of the cases...\nPhoenix:\nI was right about you. Competent. Capable. Tell me what you found out. If you want to.\nApollo:\n(Your enthusiasm is over-whelming...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n...Thanks, really. If I get tired of sleeping, maybe I'll head down to this Meraktis place. Maybe hit 'em up for some reparations... A little legal action would do me some good.\nApollo:\nUm... I was wondering when I get paid? We solved the case of your accident, and um, found a missing article of clothing.\nTrucy:\nMy panties!\nPhoenix:\nThat leaves the noodle stand.\nApollo:\nEh.\nPhoenix:\nFeel free to drop in if you get stuck. I'd be happy to help with anything not involving money.\nApollo:\n(Good-bye, quid pro quo. Hello pro bono. *sigh*)\nTrucy:\nRight! Back to the office to plan our next move!\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage:\nJune 15Kitaki Mansion\nTrucy:\nLittle Plum's not here. She's not finished cleaning, huh.\nApollo:\nMaybe she went to get a paint scraper?\nPlum:\nOK! Who's the wise guy who spit gum out on the street!?\nApollo:\n(Her voice carries all the way out to the street from inside the mansion...)\nTrucy:\nShe's a neat freak! How cute!\nPlum:\nYou there! It was you, wasn't it!? Fess up! I hope you've said your prayers. You're gonna need them...\nApollo:\nTr-Trucy? Let's leave. Now.\nTrucy:\n...?\nJune 15Wright Anything Agency\nApollo:\nYou... You're the woman from the Kitaki place!\n???:\nY-Yes...\nTrucy:\nI knew it! Something's the matter and you want our help, right? Well, you've come to the Wright place! This way, please...\n???:\nUm... Thank you.\nAlita:\nMy name is Alita Tiala. I... have a request.\nJune 15Hickfield Clinic\nApollo:\nHuh...? Where's Mr. Wright?\nTrucy:\nMaybe he's getting an examination again?\nApollo:\nHow many does he need!? (Wasn't it just a sprain?)\nTrucy:\nToo bad, Polly! You wanted to show off your request to Daddy, didn't you!\nApollo:\nWhat? Me? No!\nTrucy:\nOh? That's a surprise.\nApollo:\nL-Let's just come back later, shall we?\nAfter clearing \"Your fiancé\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency:\nJune 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nTrucy:\nPolly! You look as happy as a clam in its shell.\nApollo:\nFor a lawyer this is it, the place where the battle begins!\nGuard:\n...Ahem. You need something?\nApollo:\nAaah! Yes, we're attorneys. I was hoping we could see Mr. Wocky Kitaki?\nGuard:\nSorry, he's in questioning right now. Could take a while.\nTrucy:\nDrat. Oh well, guess we'll have to come back later then.\nApollo:\nSo much for that battle...\nAfter clearing \"Your fiancé\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency:\nJune 15Kitaki Mansion\nApollo:\n(So this is it... My first murder crime scene!)\nOfficer:\nAh, it's you kids again. Look, can't you find some other place to play...\nTrucy:\nWe're not playing! We're um, \"investigating\"! Aren't we, Apollo?\nApollo:\nSir, I have a letter of request here.\nOfficer:\nLetter of... huh? Why does it say \"Hit Request\" on it?\nApollo:\n(Ms. Tiala must have used the Kitaki's stationery...)\n???:\nExcuse me, coming through.\nOfficer:\nAh! It's you! Mr. Gavin!\nApollo:\n...! (Who's this guy...?)\n???:\nI must say I'm used to being inspected by the ladies... But this is the first time I've felt this way with a man.\nApollo:\nMr.... Gavin?\n???:\nAh, Fräulein. What is a sweet morsel like you doing in such a dismal place? Can I help?\nTrucy:\n... Y-Yes! The police man officer fellow here won't let us in! We even have a letter of request!\n???:\nYou must be exhausted, standing out here! I will take you to the scene of the crime.\nTrucy:\nOooh! R-Really!?\n???:\n...By your leave, Officer.\nOfficer:\nYa... Yes sir! Of course, sir!\n???:\nAh ha. Very well. This way, Fräulein...\nTrucy:\nWhee!\nApollo:\n... Hey! What about me!?\nJune 15People Park\n???:\n...On that note, enjoy your investigation!\nTrucy:\nThank you! Will we see you again...?\n???:\nAsk the wind, Fräulein. I'll be riding on it!\nApollo:\n...Who was that?\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeek! Apollo! Look! A c-corpse!\nApollo:\nWhaaaat!? ...Hey, it's just a mannequin.\nTrucy:\nWow. It sure got me.\n???:\nAhem. Might I ask exactly what it is you're doing here? Oh, it's you. How did you kids get in here?\nTrucy:\nOh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in...\n???:\nHim again. That glimmerous fop, always getting in my way... Anyway! This scene is off-limits.\nApollo:\nExcuse me? We have a letter of request!\n???:\n...Hmm. One moment.\nApollo:\n(Why is she holding that big magnifying glass...?)\n???:\n.............................. I'd recognize that handwriting anywhere. Scientific analysis says this was written by Alita Tiala.\nApollo:\n...Thanks. (It took you thirty minutes to figure that out!?) So... what's up with the mannequin there?\n???:\nIt's taking the place of the body, preserving the scene of the crime as it was found.\nApollo:\n(The body... was pulling the stand!?)\n???:\nSo, you're a defense attorney, are you?\nEma:\nDetective Ema Skye. I'm in charge of this crime scene.\nTrucy:\nShe doesn't seem that happy about it.\nApollo:\n...She doesn't seem that happy about many things.\nEma:\nI trust you know how to stay out of the way. I always carry two pairs of handcuffs... just in case.\nAfter clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park:\nJune 15Eldoon's House\nTrucy:\nOh, Mr. Eldoon...! Hello?\nApollo:\nLooks like he left.\nTrucy:\nAnd we found his stand and everything! What about our free bowl!?\nApollo:\nOh, too bad, looks like we'll have to wait a little longer for that bowl. So sorry.\nTrucy:\nAw, what a bummer.\nAfter clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park:\nJune 15Hickfield Clinic\nPhoenix:\nAh, you're back! Run into some problems?\nTrucy:\nOh, Polly, didn't you want to tell Daddy something?\nApollo:\nWho? Me? No! I'm fine. Really.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? So there is a problem?\nApollo:\nNo, no problem. Actually, I got a defense request.\nPhoenix:\nA defense request! That is a problem.\nApollo:\nHuh...?\nPhoenix:\nI've given up the court. I'm not a lawyer anymore.\nApollo:\n... The request was for me!\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. You're a lawyer, aren't you?\nApollo:\n(He's doing that on purpose! I know it!)\nWright Anything Agency (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic)\nApollo:\nSo this must be the \"silk top hat\" Mr. Wright mentioned. Let's take a closer look... Huh?\nTrucy:\nWhoa!\nApollo:\nYou know what this is, Trucy?\nTrucy:\nI... remember finding some in Daddy's dresser when I was little. I thought it was sugar, so I licked it... He got mad at me.\nApollo:\n(This is getting more and more suspicious...)\nWhite powder placed gingerly into pocket.\nTrucy:\nLet's go talk to that detective! She's sure to know what that white powder is!\nPeople Park (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then examining silk hat in Wright Anything Agency)\nApollo:\nUm... Does this ring any bells?\nEma:\nAh! Is that--!? It couldn't!? Where'd you get that?\nApollo:\nI brought it from the office.\nEma:\nYou... work at the Wright & Co. Law Offices, yes?\nApollo:\nEr, yeah, sort of...\nTrucy:\nDetective Skye! How do you know my daddy?\nEma:\nD-D-Daddy!? I'm sorry, who did you say you were?\nTrucy:\nTrucy Wright. Phoenix Wright's daughter.\nEma:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Wright has a daughter!?\nTrucy:\nYou seem shocked.\nEma:\nW-Well, if you're Mr. Wright's daughter and you're his apprentice... ...then I'm available to help you in any way I can!\nApollo:\nOh, uh, thanks. (You can start by not calling me Mr. Wright's apprentice!)\nEma:\nThis powder is used for detecting fingerprints.\nApollo:\nFingerprints...?\nEma:\nI guess you might call it a memento... from the time I spent with Mr. Wright.\nApollo:\n(White powder memories...)\nEma:\nIf you find any evidence with fingerprints on it, please let me know! We'll dust for prints!\nApollo:\n(Well, she's quite the eager beaver all of a sudden...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining trash can and knife:\nEma:\nSo... have you met the defendant?\nApollo:\nAh. Uh... No.\nEma:\nVisiting hours are almost over at the detention center. You might think about wrapping up here and heading over.\nApollo:\nGood idea. (I don't know what good it will do. We have a witness, and a knife with prints... Have I mentioned I've got a bad feeling about this?)\nEma:\nDon't worry, it's like a Wright tradition.\nApollo:\n(Some traditions I can live without.)\nJune 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nGuard:\nI'm sorry. Meeting hours for the day are all done.\nApollo:\nB-But we still have three minutes!\nGuard:\nI'll put in your request, but don't expect anything. The father's talking in the private room with him.\nTrucy:\nThe father? You mean like a priest?\nGuard:\nI mean the suspect's father, Mr. Winfred \"Big Wins\" Kitaki himself.\nApollo:\n(Not someone I care to meet...)\n???:\n...Die you--!!!\n???:\n...You're the one on your way out, old--!!!\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\n.........\nGuard:\nAh. They're here.\nApollo:\n(Whoa! This guy radiates power! Power.. with a cute apron?)\n???:\nYou Wocky's lawyer?\nApollo:\nY-Yes, sir!\nBig Wins:\nWell, I'm Big Wins Kitaki, fourth head of the Kitaki family... capice?\nApollo:\nEr... Actually, I came to speak to your son.\nBig Wins:\n... Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\nYes?\nBig Wins:\nMy son's innocent. He killed no one. If he were found guilty... it wouldn't be good. ...Capice?\nApollo:\nY-Yes! I'm all about capicing! Capice'd loud and clear!\nBig Wins:\nYou gotta do more than just understand to make it. You'll learn, though. Even if the lesson comes at the end of your short life.\nApollo:\n(I don't feel so good...)\n???:\nWhat's the big idea, old man!\nWocky:\nYou can't treat me like a kid no more, not now! You know I... I... I wanted to go to the clink! I like it here!\nApollo:\nYou... must be Wocky?\nWocky:\nA G's not a G till he does hard time! Bizzoooy! You'll see. When I get out of here, things'll change!\nBig Wins:\nSilence! My apologies, Mr. Justice... He's usually such a nice boy.\nApollo:\n(Forgive me if I have a hard time believing that.)\nWocky:\nHa! You can't take me under your wing this time, old man! You heard me! I don't need no trial! I did it!\nBig Wins:\n...I think that's enough for today, Mr. Justice. Don't let me down tomorrow.\nApollo:\nSo much for talking to our client.\nTrucy:\nBut we made so much progress today! We even found my panties! I had fun, at least.\nApollo:\nOf course, the biggest mystery of all remains... (How am I supposed to build a case for the trial!?)\nTrucy:\nOh, almost forgot, it's time for my show! Tonight I'm performing at the Wonder Bar! You should come check it out.\nTo be continued.",

Mr. Wright's not here today?Trucy:\nHe said his old foot injury was acting up.Apollo:\nOld injury...!? He was all smiles yesterday!Trucy:\nYes, he smiled when he said we'd be fine \"as long as you're there, Trucy\".Apollo:\nYes... Fine... We'll be fine. Here comes Justice!!! I started my voice training at 5 this morning.Trucy:\nOooh! Do some now! I want to see! ...Er, hear!Apollo:\nHuh? Oh, OK. ...Ahem. My name is Apollo Justice, and I'm fine!!!Trucy:\n...... That sounds more like a self-mantra than voice training.???:\n...I'm fine! I'm fine! You know what I'm saying!?Apollo:\nAck! G-Good morning!Wocky:\nYo, 'sup. Hit me with the guilty verdict, G! See if I care. You just hang loose and let things go with the flow. You know what I'm saying!?Apollo:\nUh, not really.Big Wins:\nWocky! Don't be running your mouth like that in here!Wocky:\nSee, that's the difference between me and you, old man. I ain't afraid of no cops. Real G's can't keep it real till they spend some hard time in the pen.Big Wins:\nYou have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.Trucy:\nSounds like they've both been voice training too, Apollo.Apollo:\n(My worst fears realized... The trial's starting and I still haven't had a real talk with my client!)June 16, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Wocky Kitaki.Apollo:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Klavier:\nReady to rock 'n' roll, Herr Judge.Trucy:\nAh! It's him! The pri--guy from yesterday! He's a prosecutor?Apollo:\n(...It's Mr. Gavin's brother!)Klavier:\n...Judge:\nLong time no see... Prosecutor Gavin. Were you taking a leave of absence?Klavier:\nYou know that little band I started in my free time? Thing is, we got real popular. Hard to say \"nein\" to your fans when three of your singles go platinum, ja?Judge:\n...I see. To be honest, I was a little concerned. I feared that you might still be distraught over that one trial...Klavier:\nNot to worry, Herr Judge. I wouldn't miss this day in court for the world. It's worth even more than VIP passes to one of my concerts, ja? How could I pass up a chance to see the true strength... ...of the little boy who bested my brother?Apollo:\n...!Klavier:\nIt was worth canceling a show or two.Judge:\nUnderstood. You may give your opening statements to the court.Klavier:\nBefore that, I was thinking... Is the air in this courtroom not a bit... serious?Judge:\nIt IS a court of law.Klavier:\nThat's no way to get the crowd jumping, Herr Judge.Judge:\nThey're not supposed to jump! This is a courtroom!Klavier:\nAchtung, baby! Today, we play it my way!Apollo:\n(What's that... noise?)Klavier:\nSometimes you have to get on up in order to get down... to prosecuting!Apollo:\n(This is crazy...)Klavier:\nThe victim... Pal Meraktis, director of the Meraktis Clinic. The scene... People Park. He was found pulling a noodle stand.Judge:\nWhat in the world was a doctor doing pulling a noodle stand?Klavier:\nYes, I believe... ...you will only find that out by asking the defendant, right here, right now. Because it's an undeniable truth that he shot the victim!Apollo:\nWhat do you mean, undeniable?Klavier:\nIf you are to glare at anyone, Herr Justice, glare at the punk in the defendant's chair. His crime was witnessed quite clearly, you see.Judge:\n...Very well. Please admit this witness to the court.Klavier:\n...Nein! Not yet! First, there is a little matter to be cleaned up...Apollo:\n(Could you talk without the accompaniment?)Trucy:\nI swear I could see the guitar for a second!Judge:\nWhat is it, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\nThe \"motive\", Herr Judge. Why did the little punk do it? Why did he kill the director of the Meraktis Clinic?Apollo:Apollo:\nNot so fast! The defendant doesn't have to explain that!Klavier:\nOh? But what if the defendant specifically requests to do so? As he did this morning? I want to \"give a shout out to all my homeys!\" I believe he said.Judge:\nWhaaaaat!?Apollo:\n(What is right!)Trucy:\nThey always say that, on stage, you should hit the crowd with speed and ferocity! Sounds like he got you good, huh, Polly?Judge:\nWell, this is highly unusual. But... The court will now hear from the defendant concerning his motive in the crime!Judge:\nSo... You, son, are the defendant... Wocky, are you?Wocky:\nI ain't your son, old man! You step to a Kitaki, you best be prepared to step strong!Klavier:\nYou \"step\" to a public official, you'd best be prepared to step into jail.Trucy:\nYou got to hand it to him, Wocky sure has guts!Apollo:\n(It's not his guts I'm worried about...)Judge:\nWell then, the court will now hear testimony on the defendant's motive... ...from the defendant himself!Witness Testimony-- Wocky Kitaki's \"Truth\" --Wocky:\nI'll tell you one thing, that doctor was a quacker!\nSomeone had to show him what's what!\nI was in his clinic 'bout half a year ago. He messed up my op something bad.\nAnd then he just lets me go, without a word. See ya later, bye!\nSo I gotta go in, get another doc to patch me up again!\nThat was the day I done figured it out. No O.G.'s gonna let that pass!\nThat's why I went to his pad that night, know what I'm saying!?Judge:\nYou're saying you were one of the victim's patients...!?Wocky:\nLotta stuff goes down when you're keeping it real on the street. Tru dat. I tell you one thing, that doc was wack!Judge:\nHmm...

Did you have an appointment to meet with the victim? In the park, perhaps?\nWocky:\nYou out of your mind!? Who makes an appointment to get the drop on someone!? I came ready to fight my way into that clinic of his. Shortest way to the clinic from my place is through that park, know what I'm saying?\nApollo:\n(...He's right. That does seem to be the shortest path.)\nWocky:\nThere I was, cold walking through the park... ...when he comes popping up out of nowhere, right before my eyes! I figured someone up on high was looking out for me, know what I'm saying?Apollo:\n(Unngh... This sounds bad right from the get-go.)Trucy:\nWell, there won't be any get-go if we don't get some more information!Apollo:\n(Right. First, gather the facts. Time enough for despair later!)After pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:Judge:\nHmm... It seems that there were issues with this doctor.Wocky:\nMan, putting him down was like doing the world a favor!Apollo:\nWocky! ...Please consult your lawyer before saying things like that...Trucy:\nChin up, Apollo! Back straight!Judge:\nBut, why did this mistake only come to light that day?Klavier:\nIt was found during the Family health check-up.Apollo:\nThe F-Family check-up?Wocky:\nThat was the wackest thing of all! All us G's lining up, taking eye exams 'n' all that. Better to die young than fade away, bizzzoy!Klavier:\n...A relief to hear.Wocky:\nEh? Wh-What's a relief!?Klavier:\nOh? Did your father not tell you? That bullet you carry so close to your heart... if not attended to immediately... ...It could kill you.Apollo:\nWh-Whaaat!?Klavier:\nYes, Herr Doktor Meraktis had knowledge concerning this ticking \"time bomb\" in you. Knowledge... that could have saved your life.Wocky:\nNo way! Th-That's wacked!Klavier:\nThere is proof.

By \"occupation\" I take it you refer to some labor that \"profits\" society at large, and supports a livelihood under which definition I must confess to being \"unemployed\" however, we must acknowledge the meaning of \"identity\" which is commonly attached to this notion of \"occupation\", and once we have accepted this reality, we see that our confusion is not Gestalt, per se, but derives instead from the \"vagueness\" inherent in all representations of thoug--Klavier:\nBy which he means to say that he is a student.

Why go through the park?\nStickler:\nAh, a fascinating inquiry. Revealing me culpable of being insufficiently verbose! Let us consider the time saved by passing through the park on the way home from the store: In that time I am capable of solving two GMAT problem sets. On average, it requires me 3 minutes, 24 seconds to complete one such set. Ergo the time to complete two is, on average, 6 minutes 48 seconds. However! In the case that the questions are in the verbal category, admittedly not m...\nApollo:\nTh-That's enough! Enough. I get the idea.\nJudge:\nMr. Justice! The court hopes to finish cross-examination sometime this month.\nKlavier:\nPlease. I've a recording booked after this trial.\nTrucy:\nAnd I've got a show to perform.\nApollo:\n(Gee, sorry you're all so busy!)Stickler:\nOne man, pulling a stand. Another man, facing him.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWere these men talking, by any chance?\nStickler:\nAh, now that you mention it, they were, though I cannot claim I heard them clearly. Only fragments... such as, \"You lied to me!\" Oh, and... \"I'm gonna give you a taste of your own medicine, pal.\"\nKlavier:\nAh ha ha ha! It's just as our defendant claims! I believe he wished to \"teach\" the victim what it felt like to take a bullet in the heart.\nJudge:\nIf that's true, then this is a vital piece of testimony!\nApollo:\n(Sounds like he heard them clearly enough to me!)\n\nStickler:\nMight I be allowed to amend my testimony?\nApollo:\n(Wh... What now!?)\nStickler:\nTo be precise, he did not say \"pal\" but \"man\". Yes, that was the way of it. I swear it on my diploma!\nApollo:\n(What's the difference!?)\nKlavier:\nAnd this other man, who was he?Stickler:\nI saw them quite clearly. The man facing the victim was the defendant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nHow can you be so sure it was the defendant!? The crime took place at night! It would have been too dark!\nStickler:\n...Perhaps I was remiss in not mentioning this earlier.\nApollo:\nHuh?\nStickler:\nYou see, in class, I always sit in the very backmost seat. Do you know why?\nApollo:\n(...Who cares!?)\nStickler:\nBecause I do not wish anyone to copy my perfect notes!\nJudge:\n...And this relates to your testimony how?\nStickler:\nI mention this to illustrate my predisposition to that which is \"perfect\". It was dark, you say? Yet there are lights in the park. If I say the defendant was in the park that night, then he was in the park that night. It is a hard, immutable fact.\nTrucy:\nHe sure is confident...\nApollo:\nHe seems to be telling the truth, too. *sigh*Stickler:\nIn his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAre you sure the pistol you saw is the same as the one just submitted as evidence?\nStickler:\nAm I \"sure\"? Surely... you jest! ...Or so a common witness would be tempted to say.\nApollo:\n...Huh?\nStickler:\nYet I am no common witness. I see not only events as they are, but the logical structure governing these events! First, we must consider the fact that it was night in the park, which indeed restricted my field of vision due to insufficient levels of illumination. Now if we consider that the pistol, let us call it \"Object A\", was indeed shrouded in darkness it becomes difficult to say with certainty that Object A was indeed Object A.\nTrucy:\nI think he means he couldn't see it that clearly.\nApollo:\n(My badge for a normal witness...)\nStickler:\nYet the fact that a pistol was fired before my eyes is indisputable. I can still see it when I close my eyes. The defendant raised his weapon...Stickler:\nA shot! The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAre you absolutely certain only one shot was fired?\nStickler:\nYes. Of course it was one shot. Why do you ask?\nApollo:\n(Ah ha! A contradiction! Finally!) Mr. Stickler. According to the Court Record, the pistol was fired twice. A clear contradiction!\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\n...Good eyes, Herr Justice. You're cool. Real cool.\nApollo:\nEh? Y-You really think so?\nKlavier:\nYet, there is no reason why this other shot had to have been fired that night.\nJudge:\nMeaning...?\nKlavier:\nThis pistol came from the Kitaki Family mansion, ja? I think it's not unreasonable to assume the pistol had been fired once before that night. During, perhaps... another altercation?\nApollo:\n(Ugh... He's got a point.)\nTrucy:\nJudging from his smug expression... ...I'd say Prosecutor Gavin had that answer ready before you even spotted the problem.Present Meraktis's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Whew... If that's all of it, I think I have a chance.\"Apollo:\n(He seems pretty confident in his testimony.)Trucy:\nWe always make the biggest mistakes when we're our most confident! He's got a weak point somewhere, Apollo! Find it!Apollo:\n(...Right! Better give that testimony another listen.)Apollo:\n(Whew... If that's all of it, I think I have a chance.)Klavier:\nIs that you... relaxing, I see, Herr Justice?Apollo:\nHuh? Oh, er... Ahem! Objection!!!Judge:\n...Once is quite enough, Mr. Justice.Trucy:\nApollo! Pace yourself! This trial's not over yet!Apollo:\nUrk! Eh, right! Ahem, um, look at this!Judge:\nThe... autopsy report? Is there a problem with the autopsy report?Apollo:\nUm, right, a problem... Problem... problem... Yes!!! The problem is the location of the entry wound!Judge:\nThe location...?Apollo:\nYou testified that the killer shot the victim \"square in the forehead\", did you not?Stickler:\nAh, I have already determined your \"angle\" of inquiry. ...Allow me to explain. It is quite simple, really: First, understand that when I say \"square\", I speak not of geometrical absolute. What do I mean by this? For example, the defection of a \"meter\" is 1,650,763.73 times the wavelength of the light emitted by a krypton particle, as we all know. In addition, it is a well known fact that krypton particles are rare, and invisible to the naked eye, which points to a basic fallacy in your line of reasoning, namely, that wh--Judge:\nMr. Justice.Apollo:\nYes?Judge:\nWas your objection to these, er, krypton particle things?Klavier:\nThis is the big time, and you are obsessed with something so small? You disappoint me.Apollo:\nN-N-No! I'm obsessed with something big! I mean, there's a bigger, less nitpicky problem here!Judge:\nDo tell...Apollo:\nJust look at the autopsy report! The location of the entry wound was... ...the right temple!Stickler:\nT-Temple...?Apollo:\nMr. Stickler, you said quite clearly that the victim was shot \"square in the forehead\"! That's a contradiction! ...Isn't it? (It is, right? Finally!)Klavier:Klavier:\nHerr Justice... Oh, Herr Justice...Apollo:\nYes...?Klavier:\nYour tactics are outdated. Trying to shake the witness by objecting to trifles? Surely you haven't forgotten the fatal wound your master suffered seven years ago? Phoenix Wright... was it?Apollo:\n...! Look, I know the wound was in the wrong place according to this testimony!Stickler:\nNyurk...!Klavier:\nHey, Herr Forehead...Apollo:\n...! (F... \"Forehead\"!?)Klavier:\nLet us imagine you are walking through the park. You see two men facing each other. One with a pistol trained on the other. ...What would you do, Herr Forehead?Apollo:\nWell, I... I guess... I would try to stop them. I'd probably shout, \"Stop!\"Klavier:\nAnd you, Fräulein?Trucy:\nM-Me? Well... I'd probably scream, \"Eeeeeek!\"Klavier:\nAnd you, Herr Stickler? What did you shout, I wonder?Apollo:\nAck...! (If the victim turned his head at the last moment...*gulp*)Stickler:\n...Ah yes. Thank you for jogging my memory.Judge:\nIt sounds like an addendum to the testimony is required.Witness Testimony-- A Night in the Park 2 --Stickler:\nAs soon as the killer raised his pistol, I took action.\n\"Cease this at once, you two!\" I cried... with composure.\nThe victim turned in the direction of my voice... and a shot rang out.\nWhereupon our cowardly killer, the defendant, appeared to have become frightened.\nTossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.Judge:\nI see... So you attempted to stop the crime.Stickler:\nIndeed. ...With composure.Trucy:\nWell, maybe the criminal wouldn't have fired if he hadn't shouted like that.Apollo:\nTh-That doesn't really matter now, unfortunately.Klavier:\nLet us consider this new testimony, shall we? ...Observe the diagram, if you would. The witness... Mr. Stickler, was it? Stood here. He shouted, \"Oh stop! Please!\" or something of this nature. And the victim responded by looking in the witness's direction! If the killer were to have fired at just that moment... As we can see, the bullet would have struck the right temple, as in the report.Judge:\nThat does seem to be the case.Stickler:\nWitness the power of a Junior in Ivy University's Department of Science!Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Justice, you may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination",

The moment I saw that pistol, my inner sense of justice compelled me to take action!\nJudge:\nThat was certainly brave of you.

He didn't even have time to take a single step.\nTrucy:\nI'm totally sure that the killer fired because Mr. Stickler startled him.\nApollo:\nDon't say that too loud, Trucy, please...Stickler:\nWhereupon our cowardly killer, the defendant, appeared to have become frightened.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nCan you describe the killer's actions more clearly?\nStickler:\nHe seemed quite surprised, especially considering that it was he who did the deed! As we can see, human psychology is a tangled web, indeed.\nKlavier:\nHe simply couldn't believe what he had done. He shot, he panicked. A common tale, but true.\nStickler:\nUnfortunately, before I could take further action...Stickler:\nTossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou didn't try to apprehend the criminal?\nStickler:\nIt all happened so fast, I'm afraid I hadn't the time.\nTrucy:\nDoesn't something about that strike you as odd, Apollo?\nApollo:\n...! What?\nTrucy:\nThe killer was in a hurry, right? He fired the pistol, and tossed it right away...\nApollo:\nAccording to the testimony, that's what happened, yes.\nTrucy:\nIn that case, I'd expect to find something that we didn't find!\nApollo:\n(Find \"something\"? Find what?)Present Pistol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWait a second!\nSticker:\nTsk, tsk, another misleading request. Yet you're so beholden to your own mode of \"discourse\" you can't see how it affects you!\nApollo:\nUm... come again?\nStickler:\nWait a \"second\", you say? A \"second\"? Are we intended to wait just that, a single second, one sixtieth of a minute? That's hardly enough time to draw a breath, let alone make a statement in court!

I mean, no! Here, just look at the pistol! It doesn't have a single fingerprint on it!\nStickler:\nAh, a common ploy, made all the more common, I fear, by the prevalence of television. Criminals these days are loathe to leave fingerprints.\nApollo:\nWait! But you said the killer tossed the gun and ran!\nTrucy:\nThat's right! He didn't have time to wipe the gun for prints!\nStickler:\n...!\nKlavier:\nAh, the little girl sticking it to the university student. There's a song in there...\nTrucy:\nI'm not little!\nKlavier:\nA ha ha ha... Then let's think like adults, shall we, Fräulein?\nTrucy:\nEh...?\nKlavier:\nWhat if the killer... the defendant, was wearing gloves?\nTrucy:\n... Gotta admit, I didn't think of that, Apollo.\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\n(Could the killer have been wearing gloves...?)\n\n\n\nI guess...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(If he was wearing gloves, there wouldn't be prints...) ... (C'mon Justice, you've gotta come up with something...!)\nJudge:\nIs there something you want to tell the court, Mr. Justice?\nKlavier:\nHis silence speaks louder than words, Herr Judge. He can think of nothing... nein?\nApollo:\nI g-guess he could have been wearing gloves. (...I guess.)\nJudge:\nThen let's continue with the testimony. If you would.\nStickler:\n...My pleasure, Your Honor. A small pleasure, but still.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nNo way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The record of the murder weapon is very clear about one thing:\"Trucy:\nI liked that contradiction. Kinda sad to see it go.Apollo:\nNot as sad as I feel. What do we do now?Trucy:\nAt least the testimony's getting a little clearer.Apollo:\n(She's right! Maybe I can find something to use in this new testimony.)Apollo:\nThe record of the murder weapon is very clear about one thing: The fingerprints were \"wiped\" which means some trace of prints remained! Which contradicts your testimony! If everything happened as you say it did, he wouldn't have had time to wipe the pistol!Stickler:\n...That may be. But it does not change what I saw. The killer... the defendant... He threw down the murderous weapon from his hand and fled.Judge:\nHmm...Stickler:\nAnd this pistol was found at the scene of the crime. Strongly suggesting that this was the weapon he disposed of!Klavier:\nThat sounds solid to me. Well, Herr Forehead? Any of your precious \"objections\"?Apollo:\n...Trucy:\nWhat gives, Apollo!? Let's see that voice training go to work!Apollo:\nYou know, I've only recently realized something. No matter how much you train your voice, it doesn't matter if you have nothing to say.Trucy:\nWhat do you mean, \"nothing to say\"!? Isn't it obvious from what the witness just said?Apollo:\nHuh? Isn't what obvious?Trucy:\nWhen he re-stated what he saw just now, he said he saw Wocky drop a \"murderous weapon\". But that's not the same as being 100% sure of what Wocky threw away!Apollo:\nYou're right!Trucy:\nHe's just confused because a pistol was found at the scene! Poor Mr. Stickler... It must be hard to be so perfect, and yet so wrong.Stickler:\nW-Well! It can be said that I'm quite offended! While it is, indeed, true that once, in my youth, I wrote a love letter in my own blood that was seized by the teacher and posted on the blackboard for all to see, and for this the appellation \"poor\" might as well be prefixed to my name, yet as for the issue at ha--Judge:\nWhat we can say for certain is that the witness saw the killer throw \"something\"... Does the defense have anything to say about this?Trucy:\nWell, if what he threw wasn't a pistol...Apollo:\nThen it had to be something else!Klavier:\nAt least one person on the defense team seems to be thinking.Apollo:\n(Grr... I'll wipe that smile off your pretty face, Gavin!)Judge:\nPerhaps you can inform the court as to the nature of this \"something else\"? What did the killer throw away before fleeing the scene?Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Is that... a sword?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWhat the witness really saw... was this! Or... something like it.\nJudge:\n... Penalty.\nApollo:\n(That didn't even warrant a wise-crack, did it.)\nJudge:\nPerhaps you'd like to try that again, Mr. Justice?\nLeads back to:\n\"What did the killer throw away before fleeing the scene?\"Judge:\nIs that... a sword? I saw one of those on the late night movie last night!Apollo:\n(Great, a sleep-deprived judge...) This knife was found at the scene of the crime... with the defendant's prints on it.Judge:\nHis prints!Apollo:\nThis single piece of evidence proves two important things: One, that what the defendant threw down wasn't a pistol. Two, that the defendant wasn't wearing gloves!Judge:\nHmm... Indeed!Klavier:\nOh, Herr Forehead? You're forgetting two other things you've just proven.Apollo:\nHuh?Klavier:\nOne, that the man the witness saw was the defendant, Mr. Wocky Kitaki. Two, that the defendant was holding a knife, with the intent of harming the victim!Apollo:\nOh.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed!Apollo:\n(Grr... Never underestimate a Gavin is the lesson here.)Judge:\nThis court is of the opinion that our witness is fond of making assumptions. In that light, I believe it would behoove us to hear about what really occurred... ...with less assuming, please!Stickler:\nIt is always the same with you people. \"Mark left the house on foot, and five minutes later, his brother left after him. How long would it take for Mark's brother to catch up to him... ...assuming that Mark never had to stop for a traffic light!\" \"Assuming\"... Yes, that's what I said. \"Assuming\"! As if that were a probable situation at all! Yet here you are \"assuming\" that my \"assumption\" is no better!Judge:\nAhem. What this court \"assumes\"... ...is that the witness will testify as to what happened after the shot was fired!Witness Testimony-- From Shot to Call --Stickler:\nI could not prevent the killer from leaving the scene.\nNor could I simply leave the scene in good conscience.\nErgo! I used my cell phone to call the police.\nUntil the police arrived at the scene 10 minutes later, I saw no one else.Apollo:\nWhy didn't you chase the killer?Stickler:\nHe was, as you say, a killer. Of course, I could have run him down, yet what would he have done when cornered? Sadly, it takes more than an aptitude for solving quadratic equations to know that.Judge:\nHmm...Klavier:\nDid the testimony earlier not prove the defendant's presence at the scene? And do we not also now know that there was no one else there? ...It seems clear that we have our killer.

There's nothing fishy about that testimony at all!)Judge:\nIt appears there are no objections to the witness's current testimony.Klavier:\nThere are any number of ways to explain the lack of prints on the pistol, I assure you. Perhaps the killer really was wearing gloves which wiped the previous user's prints off. Then, after the deed was done, this fell out of his pocket as he was throwing the gun away. A mistake befitting of a small-time punk, in my opinion.Apollo:\nNo... Nooooooooooo!Judge:\nIt seems we've come to the end of the line here.Apollo:\n(No... that can't be all!)Klavier:\nHow unfortunate. It seems that you weren't cut out to stand on the same stage as me.

It's you who's being threatened here!Apollo:\nHuh...?Trucy:\nRemember what you said to Wocky's father yesterday? You promised you'd save his son!Apollo:\nB-But that testimony was rock solid! What are you suggesting I do?Trucy:\nLook, once the judge declares a verdict, it's all over. If I can use my talent to stop that from happening, I will!Apollo:\nTrucy, no more staged abductions, please...Trucy:\nI'm not talking about magic, Apollo! I know when the witness isn't confident... I can perceive what he's feeling! It might not mean anything, but it's all we've got...Apollo:\nYou can see... what he's \"feeling\"?Trucy:\nThink back, Apollo! Think back to the times when there was a contradiction in his testimony! All the times!Apollo:\nAll the times there was a contradiction...?I remember\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nWell, I think I remember them, sure...\nLeads to:\n\"There were two times when he made statements he wasn't confident in.\"I don't remember\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nUm... Actually, I don't remember them exactly.\nTrucy:\nGood thing I do!\nLeads to:\n\"There were two times when he made statements he wasn't confident in.\"Trucy:\nThere were two times when he made statements he wasn't confident in. And each time, there was a contradiction.Stickler:\nIn his hand he held.. yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.Stickler:\nTossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.Trucy:\nHe said the man tossed aside a pistol... But it turned out he wasn't sure, and sure enough, there was a contradiction.Apollo:\nWell, that's true, but how does that help us?Trucy:\nDidn't you notice anything? Whenever he made a statement he wasn't confident in... ...he displayed a certain habit!Stickler:\nIn his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.Trucy:\nDid you see it? The very moment he said the word \"pistol\"... ...his fingers got all tense, and he fiddled with the corner of a page in his book!Apollo:\nHow'm I supposed to see that!?Trucy:\nWell, I could see it. How else do you think Daddy went seven years without losing a game of poker?Apollo:\nWha--!?Trucy:\nI always sat next to Daddy during big matches. I could see what his opponents were feeling!Apollo:\nYou mean that's how Mr. Wright won all those games?Trucy:\nIt's not cheating, officially. I wasn't looking at their hands or anything. And I wasn't there all the time, either. Daddy's quite good at poker, after all. But not good enough to go undefeated that long!Apollo:\nGreat, so he cheated. But what does that do for us? (I don't believe this...)Trucy:\nYou have to listen to his testimony one more time! No... scratch that! You have to watch his testimony! Perceive the truth!Apollo:\n\"Watch\" a testimony? \"Perceive\" the truth? The only thing I'm perceiving is that I'm going to lose.Trucy:\nNot true!Apollo:\n...!Trucy:\nDaddy said so. He said you have the power, Apollo.Apollo:\nMr. Wright said that? (Watch the testimony... Perceive his true feelings... Is she serious!?)Trucy:\nTime's up! Sorry I can't think of any other way out of this one, Apollo.Apollo:\n(What was that she said before the trial started?)Apollo:\nHuh... Mr. Wright's not here today?Trucy:\nHe said his old foot injury was acting up. Yes, he smiled when he said we'd be fine \"as long as you're there, Trucy\".Apollo:\n(Is this what he meant by us being \"fine\"...? Well... methods aside, she did avoid one guilty verdict already today. Time to show this court what I'm made of! Get ready for Justice!) ...Let's do it.Trucy:\nApollo...Apollo:\nYou know, I'm starting to think I can do this.Trucy:\n...I knew you could do it all along! Oh, one more thing.Apollo:\n?Trucy:\nTry to cover for Mr. Hat as best you can!Mr. Hat:\nI just flew in from the coast, and boy are my arms tired!Apollo:\nRight...

I'd like to say to the young lady standing next to you, Mr. Justice...Trucy:\nOh, you mean me?Judge:\nDon't you have anything to report? Anything... concerning the mysterious phantom in the silk top hat?Apollo:\nAh! Right! Him! Don't worry about him. I settled that.Judge:\nYou \"settled\" that...?Apollo:\nErm, yes, it was an... out of court settlement! Right.Klavier:\nPerhaps Fräulein would have us believe it was nothing more than a passing dream... ...a fantastic illusion, now you see it, now you don't. Am I right?Trucy:\n...I think he's on to me.Apollo:\nI wish he would stop being so... so cool.Klavier:\nLet us dispense with these niceties and get straight to the matter. What are your plans for our gifted witness?Apollo:\nR-Right... The defense would like to request another cross-examination! B-Because... Because I forgot to ask something.Judge:\nThere was no issue with the witness's previous testimony. I will grant your request, however. But this court will not permit stalling for time!Apollo:\n...Understood, Your Honor.Trucy:\nDon't forget, Apollo!

This cell phone tells all!Stickler:\nB-But that's ridiculous! That makes it sound like... Like I snuck into this fellow's garage to commit some crime! As though I were trying to kill him!Judge:\nWell, Dr. Meraktis was killed that night.Stickler:\nW-Well y-yes, but no! This line of reasoning has to be against the rules! Yes, it's true! I lost my cell phone! But you can't prove that I lost it that night!Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Justice? If that cell phone was dropped the night of the murder... ...it does raise considerable suspicions as to a connection with the crime.Trucy:\nNow's your chance, Apollo! Connect Mr. Stickler to the crime!Apollo:\nOh, he's already connected enough. I just have to prove it. (Well... Do I have a piece of evidence that can do the job? Can I prove the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder?)Show evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nOf course I have evidence!\nKlavier:\nOoh, I like your swagger, Herr Forehead. Hit it.\nJudge:\nThe court will see this evidence. Mr. Justice, \"hit it\", as they say!\nLeads to:\n\"The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:\"No evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(Evidence... If only I had some evidence, it'd make this whole thing a lot easier.)\nJudge:\nCare to explain the lack of confidence smeared across your face, Mr. Justice?\nKlavier:\nOh, Herr Forehead... I think it should be clear by now. \"No evidence\" means \"no case\".\nApollo:\n(Ack! I guess this is it, then. Time to go for broke!)\nLeads to:\n\"The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:\"Apollo:\nThe evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:Present Mirror\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"That's... a side-view mirror?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nNo comment, Herr Judge.\nJudge:\nNo dice, Mr. Justice. Penalty.\nTrucy:\nApollo! Remember where we found that cell phone! If it had fallen on the ground before that night...\nApollo:\n(That's right! The cell phone would have been crushed!) Your Honor! One more chance, please!\nJudge:\nMr. Justice, keep this up and you'll run yourself out of a life's worth of chances!\nLeads back to:\n\"The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:\"Judge:\nThat's... a side-view mirror?Apollo:\nAs it so happens... Dr. Meraktis's car was in an accident... ...that took place the night of the murder!Stickler:\nAn accident!?Apollo:\nAn accident. It happened a little after 9 PM, just outside People Park... our murder scene. Dr. Meraktis's car hit a pedestrian!Stickler:\nWh-What are you trying to say?Apollo:\nFrom the absence of a mirror, it's clear that the car was parked after the accident. Which means it was parked there after 9 PM on the night of the murder. If your cell phone had been dropped before the car was parked in that garage... ...then it would have been crushed. After all, it was lying on the ground, right under the wheel!Stickler:\nUrk...Apollo:\nErgo, Mr. Stickler! The only time you could have dropped this in that garage... ...was after 9 PM the night of the murder in the park!Stickler:\nWeeeeeeeeoooorrgh!Apollo:\nMr. Stickler! You know what this means? You did break into the victim's garage that night.Judge:\nThis is most unexpected! Mr. Justice... Are you naming the witness as a suspect in the murder of Pal Meraktis!?Stickler:\nN-No, stop! This is too much! This can't be happening! P-P-P-P-Prosecutor! Say something!Klavier:\nI suppose it is worth saying this: No connection has been found between Wesley Stickler and Pal Meraktis. That is, other than this.Judge:\nI believe our next testimony will be most... revelatory. Is the witness prepared?Stickler:\nY-Y-Yes, Your Honor!!!Apollo:\n(I know that face... That's the face of guilt!)Trucy:\n...Witness Testimony-- Stickler's \"Truth\" --Stickler:\nThat night... Yes! I went to the supermarket.\nI must have dropped my cell phone on my way back.\nAnd when I was walking through the park, I happened to witness the crime!\n...I saw the killer, the victim, the stand... all as clear as day!\nIt was him! I saw the defendant at the scene!Judge:\nYes... but your cell phone was lying in a garage.Stickler:\nAh, yes, well, as you can see my model of cell phone has a defect... It is given to rolling! It's quite a pain when I drop it alongside the road, you know.Judge:\n...Looks like a normal cell phone to me. In any case, Mr. Justice, the cross-examination, please.Apollo:\n(That's funny... My bracelet didn't react at all during that testimony.)Trucy:\nHis nervous habit must not be acting up... I didn't sense anything either, actually. Looks like you're on your own this time around!Apollo:\n(Right, no problem... I hope. Here comes Justice!)Cross Examination",

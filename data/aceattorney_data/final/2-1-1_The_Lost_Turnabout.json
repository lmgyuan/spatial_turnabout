I really shouldn't be dozing off right before a trial starts anyway...Phone:...*beep*...Phoenix: Huh... looks like they hung up.???:Ah, good. I finally found it. Talk about a close call. I hate to do this to you, but... It's nothing personal... Mr. Attorney.A few minutes later...District CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Phoenix:... Ouch... My head... It's throbbing... And why does it feel... so foggy in there...????: Gooood morning!Phoenix: Ack! Uh... G-Good morning...???: What's wrong!? You don't look well! People are at their best first thing in the morning! Where's that fighting spirit!?Phoenix: ... Sorry, but can you please turn the cheeriness down? My head... sort of hurts...???: Roger that!Phoenix: ...???: ...Phoenix: ... Um... Am I in trouble or something????: Huh? \"Trouble...?\"Phoenix: W-Wait, never mind. You're a policewoman, right? I thought maybe I had done something wrong...????: Wh-What are you talking about? I'm the one in trouble!Phoenix: ... What?Byrde: I'm placing my life in your hands today, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix: Life... in... my hands...?Byrde: You promised me! You said you would prove that I was not guilty!Phoenix: \"N... Not... guilty\"?Byrde: Just when I thought all hope was lost; when all the other lawyers had laughed me off... \"Leave it to me!\" you said! You! The one and only Phoenix Wright came to save the day! And just like that, I was moved to tears, sir! I'll never forget what you're doing for me, EVER!Phoenix:(What is this girl babbling about...?)Byrde: Actually, I really love to watch court proceedings, and I always root for you to win! When I'm off duty, I like to come here and... ...? What's wrong? You've been acting really strange and you keep staring at me. You're making me kind of nervous, sir...Phoenix: Oh... sorry. (Hmm... I'm afraid to ask, but here goes...) So, this might sound bad, but... uh... Who are you...?Byrde: Whaaaaat!? Mr. Wright!! How can you say that!? How can you do this to the fragile heart of a girl about to go on trial...? You're absolutely horrible!Phoenix: No -- I mean, I didn't mean it like that!Byrde:Is this how a defense attorney treats his clients, sir!? I can't believe this!!Phoenix:No, it's just... ...Well, I think you have the wrong person. I'm...Byrde:Yes...!? \"I'm...\"!?Phoenix: ... ... I'm... Who am I? (Why am I drawing a blank...?)Bailiff:The trial will begin shortly. Will the defendant and her lawyer please proceed to the courtroom immediately!Byrde: The trial's about to start! I'm counting on you in there, OK?Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess I must have amnesia... Let's see... What can I piece together...? Hmm, from our conversation, I can safely say that I'm probably a defense attorney. And that girl... I said I'd prove her \"not guilty\"... I can't believe I made such an irresponsible promise.) Aaaaaargh! Someone, please!! Tell me this is just a bad dream!(Why do I get the feeling this is one dream I won't be waking up from...? *gulp*)September 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:Court is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Payne:The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:...Judge:What is it, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Um, er... Are you talking to me...?Judge: Do you see any other defense attorneys here?Phoenix: (I guess not.) (Changed from [I guess not. Urk.] in the original release)Judge: Now then, are you ready?YesPhoenix:(I guess I should say, \"Yes\" for now.)Judge: Are you ready, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. (... Wait a sec... If her life is in my hands... I should really do the responsible thing...)Leads to:\"Actually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...\"NoPhoenix:Um... What if I said, \"No\"? Would that be alright?Judge:Of course it wouldn't!Phoenix:(Then why bother asking to begin with??)Leads to:\"Actually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...\"Phoenix:Actually, you see, Your Honor... My memory is kind of...Judge:The court will not hear the defense's excuses. Because the defendant is a member of the police, this case is under great scrutiny. Therefore, we must make this trial fair but swift. I believe I have told you this before. I hope you're not telling me you've forgotten!Phoenix:(Actually, I have...) (Changed from [Actually, I did...] in the original release)Judge:Mr. Payne, your opening statement, please.Payne:Yes, Your Honor. As I'm sure you're well aware, the defendant is accused of killing her lover. What's worse, her lover was a fellow police officer!Phoenix:A policeman? You did WHAT to a policeman!?Byrde:It wasn't me! And besides, Dustin and I... We weren't \"lovers\" like that!Payne:In any case... The prosecution will prove that the guilty party is none other than the defendant!Judge:Very well. Mr. Payne, please call your first witness.Payne:Hee, hee, hee. It's been a while, Mr. Wright. Let's see what you've learned since last time. I won't show you any mercy this time, rookie!Phoenix:Okaaay... (And who are you again!?)Payne:The prosecution calls Detective Dick Gumshoe to the stand. (Changed from [Please bring Detective Dick Gumshoe to the stand.] in the original release)Byrde:Here we go! Don't let me down, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:(Nowhere to hide... I'm sooo dead...)Payne:Witness, please state your name and occupation.Gumshoe:My name is Dick Gumshoe, sir. I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir.Judge:You don't look very well, Detective.Gumshoe:Well, sir, the defendant... She works under me, so, you know...Phoenix:You work under that detective?Byrde:Yes, sir! And while I was a trainee, he was always watching out for me, sir! He's such a wonderful guy, sir! I'll never forget what he's done for me!Phoenix:(OK, calm down, I believe you.)Payne:Detective Gumshoe. Please describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:Yes, sir. It happened at the park near headquarters, \"Expos\u00e9 Park\". The victim was one of the local cops, Dustin Prince. He was pushed down from the benches on the upper path, sir. The landing beat his body up bad and snapped his neck.Payne:The details are listed in the report that was distributed yesterday...Judge:Ah, yes. This autopsy report, correct?Phoenix:(Why do I not remember getting a copy...?)Judge:I see everything is in order here. Even the estimated time of death is unusually well documented!Gumshoe:The victim's watch stopped from the impact of the landing, sir. The results of the autopsy confirmed the time of death.Payne:If I may, Your Honor, the prosecution would like to submit this photograph.Judge:Very well. The court accepts it into evidence.Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.Judge:Now then, I recall at yesterday's preliminary hearing, a very important piece of evidence was brought to our attention.Payne:Yes, Your Honor.Gumshoe:Yes, sir.Phoenix:Yes... I guess?Judge:Mr. Wright! Is your head on right today!? There was a very crucial piece of evidence found under the victim's body!Phoenix:Um, was there?Byrde:Have you lost your mind!?Phoenix:Well, actually... Um, it's just nerves. Give me a second.Byrde:Whaaaat!? How can you talk like such an amateur!? I thought you were a pro, sir! ... Alright, sir. I'll help you through this! At a time like this, maybe you ought to take a glance at the Court Record!Phoenix:...Court Record?Byrde:Yup! Info about evidence and people involved with this case are all listed there, sir! You can look a the Court Record by pressing [the R Button / Tab]! (Changed from [You can look at the Court Record by touching the Court Record Button!] in the original release)Phoenix:[The R Button / Tab], huh... You really know what you're talking about, don't you? (Changed from [The Court Record Button...? You really know what you're talking about, huh?] in the original release)Byrde:It's too bad I'm a cop, right? Just think! I could totally be a legal aide instead!Judge:Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Yes, Your Honor!Judge:Court is in session. Save your chit-chat for later!Phoenix:S-Sorry, Your Honor... (Well, I guess I'd better check the Court Record, and see what I can find... What was it again? [The R Button / Tab]...? (Changed from [What was it again? The Court Record Button...?] in the original release))Judge:Alright, Mr. Wright. Let's see if your notes are in order. What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?A walletPhoenix:Um... I'm pretty sure it was a wallet...Payne:Payne:This is a court of law! You can't just make wild guesses!Judge:Agreed.Byrde:They're right, Mr. Wright! You have to check the Court Record before you answer! If you don't, your client might end up with a guilty verdict!Phoenix:(\"Your client\"? You do realize that's you, right?)Judge:I will ask you one more time.Leads back to:\"What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?\"GlassesLeads to:\"That's simple, Your Honor. A broken pair of glasses.\"A police badgePhoenix:If he's a cop, then I guess maybe a badge or something...Payne:Payne:Mr. Wright! Please stick to the facts of this case!Phoenix:Phoenix:He is a policeman, correct?Payne:I don't think you understand the problem here.Judge:I will not have an uninformed lawyer in my court.Phoenix:Yes, Your Honor. (Guess there's no fooling those two.)Byrde:Please, for my sake, look at the Court Record, sir!Phoenix:(Uh, with [the R Button / Tab], right?) (Changed from [Uh, it's the Court Record Button, right?] in the original release)Judge:I will ask you one more time.Leads back to:\"What was the piece of evidence found underneath the victim's body?\"Phoenix:That's simple, Your Honor. A broken pair of glasses.Judge:That's right.Gumshoe:The victim grabbed the criminal's glasses as he was being shoved, sir, and held onto them as he fell.Phoenix:...Byrde:Hey! Why are you giving me the evil eye!?Phoenix:Those glasses you're wearing...Byrde:Nnnngh... Yes, this is my spare pair. But these glasses they found at the scene of the crime are not mine! I swear, sir!Phoenix:You sure about that?Byrde:Look, it was a coincidence that on that same day, I accidentally stepped on mine!Phoenix:(A \"coincidence\" she says... Urk...)Payne:Eh hee hee hee hee hee hee! Your Honor. I have further evidence to present.Judge:Oh? You have more?Payne:And this evidence is very decisive.Judge:Very well! Let's hear from our witness about this \"evidence\".Witness Testimony-- Decisive Evidence --Gumshoe:There's something even more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body, sir.During his date, the victim was pushed from the bench area.But he managed to write the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.I don't like saying it, but it was clearly the defendant's name, \"Maggie\", sir.With this piece of evidence and the glasses, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.Payne:This is a picture of the writing, Your Honor.Judge:Why, this is...! Yes, I can see the name is clearly written here.Payne:The prosecution would like to submit this picture.Judge:Understood. The court accepts it into evidence.Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record.Phoenix:As if the glasses alone didn't make you look suspicious, the victim even wrote your name clear as day on the ground!Byrde:But, but, but, I already told you! Those glasses aren't mine!!Phoenix:And how do you explain his dying message?Byrde:... It's a conspiracy! I'm not guilty, sir!Judge:Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:Cross-examine?Byrde:This is it! I'm counting on you!Phoenix:Sure... But what am I supposed to do?Byrde:WHAT!? This isn't like you at all! Normally, this is the part where you get in the witnesses' faces!Phoenix:Get in their faces and do what?Byrde:I guess there's no way around it! OK, I'm going to lend you a hand! The prosecution's witnesses all hide things from the court, which means they lie from time to time.Phoenix:Lie? But... isn't that detective your superior?Byrde:Well, even if they don't mean to lie, sometimes people just remember things wrong.Phoenix:Hmm, like that detective. He does sort of look like a scatterbrain...Byrde:It doesn't matter! Either way, it's bad for us, sir! That's why when you question witnesses, you have to find and expose their lies!Judge:Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, please.Phoenix:Y-Yes, Your Honor. (Talk about trial by fire. Here goes nothing. As long as I can \"expose the lies\", we should be alright.)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Decisive Evidence --Gumshoe:There's something even more incriminating than the glasses under the victim's body, sir.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Hmm, about those glasses... Do you have any proof that those belong to my client?Gumshoe:The lenses are for near-sightedness, and are almost the same strength as hers. Even the frames look kinda like the ones she's wearing in her ID, pal.Phoenix:Hmm... (What should I do now?)Continue pressingPhoenix:Phoenix:\"Almost\" and \"kinda\" are not good enough in a case like this!Gumshoe:Er, um...Phoenix:Do you have more definitive proof? Is there something that clearly links the defendant with those glasses!?Gumshoe:Er, um, uh... The dirt and sand rubbed out any traces of fingerprints or anything else.Phoenix:So what you are saying, detective, is that you have nothing that proves those glasses are my client's.Gumshoe:Um, something like that...Payne:Wh-Wh-What!?Judge:I see... Hmm... So there is no proof...Byrde:Wow, that was amazing! I could totally feel it, down in my gut!Leads back to cross-examinationLeave it bePhoenix:(We're in real trouble if those glasses really are hers... It's probably better to back out while we can.)Byrde:Argh... Why don't you believe me...?Leads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:During his date, the victim was pushed from the bench area.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Now, you're sure he was pushed and that's how he fell?Gumshoe:Yeah, pal. If you look at the wounds on the victim's body, there's no way it was anything else.Phoenix:Hmm...Judge:Please continue with your testimony, detective.Gumshoe:Anyway, the victim fell pretty far...Gumshoe:But he managed to write the culprit's name on the ground where he landed.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:The culprit's name?Gumshoe:Yeah. I was surprised, too. I didn't want to believe it, but...Phoenix:Was the name that of my client?Present Maggey Byrde profilePhoenix:Leads to:\"...\"Gumshoe:I don't like saying it, but it was clearly the defendant's name, \"Maggie\", sir.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you absolutely certain!?Gumshoe:Sorry, pal, but that's what it said. This is a picture of it. No matter which way you look, it still says \"Maggie\".Phoenix:(Hmm... He's got a point...)Byrde:Hey, hold on!Phoenix:Huh?Byrde:Don't \"huh\" me! I know the picture says \"Maggie\", but...Phoenix:(Now that she mentions it, something does feel kind of off about this picture...)Byrde:That's how you know you found a contradiction! Now hurry up and present some evidence!Phoenix:(So THAT'S what spotting a contradiction feels like... I'd better check the Court Record again...)Present Maggey Byrde profilePhoenix:Leads to:\"...\"Gumshoe:With this piece of evidence and the glasses, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:And you are certain that it was the victim who wrote the name on the ground?Gumshoe:There were scratches on his fingers from the rough sand, and there were grains of sand stuck under his pointer finger nail.Judge:Hmm... It certainly seems that the name was written by the victim himself.Phoenix:(That didn't go well.

The great Phoenix Wright is back! Oh, that's right.Phoenix:Huh?Byrde:I heard that lately, you can present not only evidence, but people's profiles as well! It sure makes things a bit more complicated, so be careful, sir!Phoenix:(People's profiles, huh? Alright, let's give this another try.)Enlighten me.Phoenix:Um, about this \"presenting evidence\"...Byrde:OK. When you're listening to testimony, you can compare, it with the Court Record. If you do that, you're sure to find contradictions in the witness's statements!Phoenix:C-Contradictions?Byrde:Well, there are many reasons why a testimony might contradict the evidence. The witness might be lying, or maybe they're just mistaken.Phoenix:Uh huh. And?Byrde:You still have no idea what I'm talking about?? When you find a contradiction, open the Court Record to the item you need...Phoenix:And then I present that evidence, right!?Byrde:You got it! You can also present people's profiles as evidence! With so many items, make sure you present the right thing!Phoenix:Hmm... Sounds complicated, but I'll give it a try. You're pretty good at this.Byrde:Wow, being praised by a pro!

This is a picture of it. No matter which way you look, it still says \"Maggie\".Phoenix:(Hmm... He's got a point...)Byrde:Hey, hold on!Phoenix:Huh?Byrde:Don't \"huh\" me! I know the picture says \"Maggie\", but...Phoenix:(Now that she mentions it, something does feel kind of off about this picture...)Byrde:That's how you know you found a contradiction! Now hurry up and present some evidence!Phoenix:(So THAT'S what spotting a contradiction feels like... I'd better check the Court Record again...)Present Maggey Byrde profilePhoenix:Leads to:\"...\"Gumshoe:With this piece of evidence and the glasses, it's hard to say she's not the culprit.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:And you are certain that it was the victim who wrote the name on the ground?Gumshoe:There were scratches on his fingers from the rough sand, and there were grains of sand stuck under his pointer finger nail.Judge:Hmm... It certainly seems that the name was written by the victim himself.Phoenix:(That didn't go well. If it really was him, then we're in a lot of trouble...)Present Maggey Byrde profilePhoenix:Leads to:\"...\"Byrde:Don't give up! Keep that fighting spirit going!Phoenix:I'm glad you're all pumped up, but...Byrde:I really want to see your \"special move\", sir!Phoenix:My what??Byrde:You always look so cool when you present evidence!Phoenix:Present... evidence?Oh, THAT present evidence!Phoenix:Actually, I was just thinking about that!Byrde:Yes! The great Phoenix Wright is back! Oh, that's right.Phoenix:Huh?Byrde:I heard that lately, you can present not only evidence, but people's profiles as well! It sure makes things a bit more complicated, so be careful, sir!Phoenix:(People's profiles, huh? Alright, let's give this another try.)Enlighten me.Phoenix:Um, about this \"presenting evidence\"...Byrde:OK. When you're listening to testimony, you can compare, it with the Court Record. If you do that, you're sure to find contradictions in the witness's statements!Phoenix:C-Contradictions?Byrde:Well, there are many reasons why a testimony might contradict the evidence. The witness might be lying, or maybe they're just mistaken.Phoenix:Uh huh. And?Byrde:You still have no idea what I'm talking about?? When you find a contradiction, open the Court Record to the item you need...Phoenix:And then I present that evidence, right!?Byrde:You got it! You can also present people's profiles as evidence! With so many items, make sure you present the right thing!Phoenix:Hmm... Sounds complicated, but I'll give it a try. You're pretty good at this.Byrde:Wow, being praised by a pro! I don't know what to say!Phoenix:... ... ...Judge:Wh-What is it?Phoenix:... (What... What's come over me...? Without thinking, I just blurted out, \"Objection!\"... And I yelled it at the top of my lungs, finger outstretched, ready to take on my opponent! What a rush!) Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:Y-You talking to me, pal?Phoenix:Please state the defendant's name for me!Payne:Payne:What are you trying to prove with this futile exercise, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:You'll see. This is a very crucial line of questioning! Actually, Mr. Payne, you can answer. The defendant's name, if you please.Payne:Wh-Where is this ridiculous question coming from? The defendant's, uh, name is, uh... \"Maggie Byrde\".Phoenix:I think someone needs to check the Court Record.Payne:What...? It says right here that it's \"Maggey Byrde\". Aaaah!!Phoenix:It looks like the bird caught the cat napping!Judge:What's going on here!?Gumshoe:I have no idea either, sir!Phoenix:As you can see, the victim did indeed leave a name, \"Maggie\". However, the defendant's name is actually spelled, \"Maggey\"! This is a blatant contradiction of facts!Judge:Ohh!Gumshoe:How about that? I hadn't even noticed!Payne:Payne:But, but, but...! But maybe the victim didn't know how to spell her name correctly...Phoenix:Phoenix:May I remind you that it was you who said, \"The defendant is accused of killing her lover.\" If they were truly lovers, it would be impossible for him to have not known her name!Payne:Noooo!Judge:This is very true. Mr. Payne.Payne:Y-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:Are you absolutely certain that the defendant and the victim, Dustin Prince, were, in fact, lovers?Payne:Y-Yes, I am quite certain, Your Honor.

What about it...?)Phoenix:Detective Gumshoe. Take a look at this.Gumshoe:That's the glove, right?Phoenix:Could you tell the court what is special about this glove?Gumshoe:What's special? Um, never really thought about it, but uh... It's REALLY yellow... ... And that's about it.Phoenix:Yes, it's REALLY yellow, but that is only one of its qualities.Gumshoe:Huh?Phoenix:There's another reason why it's special.Judge:And what would that be?Phoenix:It's very simple. This glove is made for a left-handed person!Gumshoe:Left-handed...?Judge:Why, you're absolutely right! This glove is made to be worn on the right hand!Phoenix:That is why it had to be custom-made. I have never seen a bright yellow left-hander's glove for sale. Have you?Gumshoe:Well, um... no.Phoenix:So, Detective. Which hand did the victim use to write the name with, again...?Gumshoe:That's easy! Look, it's obvious from this picture that it was his... W-W-Wait a sec...Phoenix:Don't forget that the victim was left-handed!Gumshoe:Aaaaah!!Payne:Payne:This is... This is... I mean... I... Objec--Judge:Overruled. Mr. Wright, I would like to know what your line of reasoning proves.Phoenix:There is only one conclusion that can be drawn! A left-handed person could not have written a message with his right hand! Therefore! The person who wrote the name \"Maggie\" could not have been the victim!Judge:Order! Order! When you think about it that way, then yes, it is not possible that this name was written by the victim himself.Gumshoe:Then that means Maggey is...!Payne:No... IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!!Judge:Mr. Payne.Payne:Y-Y-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:The evidence the prosecution has presented has failed to prove the defendant's guilt. In fact, I believe you have proven her to be innocent!Payne:NOOOOOOO!Byrde:Alright! You did it, Mr. Wright! Whew! I feel like I can breathe again!Judge:It seems that we have reached the conclusion. You did a fine job once again, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Me, Your Honor? Ah, well, thank you, sir...Byrde:See, you got complimented by the judge again! You're really good! And that's why you can't give up being a lawyer, sir!Phoenix:(Are you joking!? I'm more than ready to retire!)Judge:I will now announce my verdict. This court finds the defendant, Maggey Byrde...Payne:Payne:No!! Not yet! I mean, please give me a few more minutes, Your Honor.Judge:Wh-What is the meaning of this, Mr. Payne!?Payne:The prosecution is not finished yet!Phoenix:What do you mean!?Payne:We would like to call our next witness to the stand!Phoenix:Whaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge:And what did this witness... witness?Payne:The moment the victim was pushed to his death! What's more, he saw the very face of the culprit!Phoenix:What the heck!?Judge:Order! Order in the court! I believe a recess is in order. Afterward, we will hear from this new witness.Phoenix:(I had a feeling that was a bit too easy... Hmm, I need more information. I'll have to see what I can find out during this recess. I can't let my guard down! It's only going to get tougher from here!)Judge:Court is adjourned for recess!To be continued.September 8, 11:43 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Byrde:A-Amnesia!? I can't believe my lawyer's trying to defend me in such a state...Phoenix:... I... Uh...Byrde:Why didn't you tell me, sir!?Phoenix:I'm sorry I didn't mention it to you.Byrde:Oh! I know what to do! I heard you can fix something like this with a really strong shock to your system! Come on, lower your head a little! A Maggey Kick should be all you need!Phoenix:Ah, no, no, no. I think I'll pass on this one.Byrde:Come on! ... I-I'm sorry. (Changed from [Come on! ... Ah, I'm sorry.] in the original release) Whenever I see someone in trouble, I have a hard time leaving them alone... I tend to stick my nose where it doesn't belong and try to tackle everyone's problems.Phoenix:(Well, my head's one problem you won't be tackling today...) Well, we're here to solve your problem first. We can deal with mine later. For now, do you think you can fill me in on a few things?Byrde:Of course! I'd be honored to! Ah, well, I guess we'll start with my name and then I can tell you about me!Phoenix:No, no, that's ok. Really. I think I know you and your name pretty well by now. I was wondering if you could help me figure out a few things about myself. So, my name is \"Phoenix Wright\"? What a weird name.Byrde:Hmmmm... This is serious. You really don't remember. I'll tell you what, sir. You can have this back, and maybe it'll help!Phoenix:...? This is... a business card?Byrde:I got this from you. It's my most prized possession! You can borrow it for now, but please give it back, OK!?Phoenix:OK. (There are some numbers written on the back...)Byrde:Oh, that's your cell phone number!Phoenix's Business Card added to the Court Record.Phoenix:I guess for now, we should stop talking about me, and start talking about this case.Byrde:This case...?Phoenix:Yup. Can you think of anything that would be helpful for me to know?Byrde:Um, what can I tell you...? Ah, um... Hmm... I can't think of anything other than the incident with that cell phone, but...Phoenix:...Cell phone?Byrde:Yeah! Your eyes lit up when we talked about it at the Detention Center, sir!Phoenix:...! Hurry up then and tell me! This might be very important!Byrde:OK! Roger! It was on the day of the crime, just before 6 PM... I picked up a lost cell phone while on a walk with Dustin.Phone:...............Byrde:All of a sudden, the phone began to ring...Phone:...*beep*...Byrde:\"Um, hello?\"???:\"Oh, thank you! I've been searching for my phone.\"Byrde:\"Is this yours? Oh, I'm glad you called! We can meet up and I can give this back!\"???:\"I'll be right there, um... I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name...\"Byrde:\"You can call me Maggey!\"Byrde:We agreed to meet up at 6 PM. Dustin and I waited for the person to show up... but they never did.Phoenix:Hmmmm... So where is the phone you found now?Byrde:I gave it to you yesterday!Phoenix:Huh? To me? (Is it that phone in my pocket...?) Y-You mean this?Byrde:Do you think it has anything to do with the murder?Phoenix:I... don't really know... But if my eyes \"lit up\"...???:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!! YOU WERE HERE ALL ALONG!! You're so mean!! I called you a million times but you wouldn't pick up! And when I went to check in the courtroom, everyone had already left...Phoenix:(Ack! Now who in the heck is this? Let me guess. I'm supposed to know this girl too...)???:Hey, good morning, Maggey!Byrde:And a good morning to you, too, Maya!Maya:So!? So!? How's it going!?Byrde:Is there a word for \"worse than abysmal\"...?Maya:Oh? And what if I said that everything will be fine? That's right! It's Maya to the rescue with the ultra-decisive super-important evidence! Here you are, Nick! The thing you wanted me to bring!Phoenix:Huh? Oh, ah, thanks... (What the heck is this? A list? It has about 20 people's names and phone numbers written on it.)Maya:It was kind of tough, but I managed to dig up some dirt! (Changed from [It was kind of tough, but I managed to find out some dirt!] in the original release) It looks like these guys are up to no good.Phoenix:\"No good\"? As in?Maya:There's a group of con artists the police are currently investigating. I think these guys are members of that group.Names List added to the Court Record.Phoenix:Why would a group of con artists pop up in a case like this?Maya:Don't look at me!Phoenix:Hmm... And where did you get this list from in the first place?Maya:Whaaaaat!? Don't you remember, Nick!? (Changed from [Whaaaaat!? Why are you asking that!?] in the original release) You're the one who asked me to look this up yesterday!Phoenix:Oh... is that right?Maya:These numbers were in the memory of that phone Maggey found.Phoenix:Hmm, so that's where they're from.Maya:You're awfully forgetful these days, Nick. I hope I never get to be a forgetful old prune like you!Byrde:Um, Maya... Actually, Mr. Wright is...Bailiff:Mr. Wright! Recess is now over. Please bring the defendant and return to the courtroom immediately!Maya:Oh, oops! Guess you have to get going! We can talk about you being old later, Nick!Byrde:W-Wish us luck!Phoenix:(I guess I have all the pieces now... More or less. All that's left is to put it all together. I'm not going to lose this. I can't!)Maya:Come on, Nick. Better get a move on!Phoenix:Y-Yeah.September 8, 11:54 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:The court will now reconvene. Please call your next witness to the stand, Mr. Payne.Payne:Yes, Your Honor. But before I do, if I may say a few words...Judge:What is it, Mr. Payne?Payne:It's about the next witness. He has a tendency to say things that rub people the wrong way, you see, so I ask that the court might be a little lenient on...Judge:There is no need to give a preface. Just hurry up and call your witness, please.Payne:Y-Yes, Your Honor. ...The prosecution calls its next witness: a drifter who was taking a walk in the park on the day of the murder!Payne:Please state your name for the court, witness.???:Before I do, I'd like to clarify a little something.Payne:Huh? Oh, alright, go ahead.???:Just now, you introduced my wonderful self to the court, correct? Perhaps as a \"drifter who was taking a walk\"?Payne:D-Did I????:But I will not stand for that! Now you've tinted the court's eyes and colored me wrongly. Sure, I suppose calling me a university student would not be the absolute truth, but to give in and just settle would be as evil as death and I can't have that! Everything in my life is to be of the utmost, highest, top grade quality, you understand. I am merely looking for that perfect, top notch, unbeatable university, don't you see...? I have a rigorous selection process and I was in serious thought during my \"walk\" as...Payne:Yes, yes, I understand. I'm very sorry. I will be more careful from now on.Maya:Wh-What is he? A human chatterbox?Phoenix:Ugh... I have to question HIM????:Fashion! Cars! Women! Glasses! And of course, University! First-rates only need apply!Phoenix:(Glasses...? But you aren't wearing glasses...)Judge:That's enough! Your name, witness.???:Oh? Is that how you want to play this? Using your power and influence to keep the young people down. I see how you work now. You old people and your dirty tricks. You thought you had me, but you thought wrong.Judge:I-I'm sorry. It won't happen again.Phoenix:(Oh man...)Wellington:I forgive you. Alright, I suppose I can tell you my name. I am Richard Wellington, the \"Drifting Virtuoso\" with a Ph.D. in Drifting, as it were. If you wanted to, you could call me a \"University Student in Transit\".Payne:Ahem, Mr. Wellington. On the day of the murder, you were taking a... er, strolling through the park, correct?Wellington:It would appear that you are attached to that word. If you must, then by all means. But I remind you that I am in no way a prepubescent boy, \"out on a walk\" with mommy. If you must know, I am--Payne:Anyway! Please testify to this court what you saw during your walk through the park!Wellington:See, you said it again! \"Taking a walk\"... You know, you--Judge:What you witnessed will do, Mr. Wellington!Witness Testimony-- What I Saw That Day --Wellington:I was at the park all afternoon, deep in thought about my life situation.I don't remember the time all that well, but I do believe it was past 6 PM.All of a sudden, a police officer falls from above, right in front of my eyes.Without a thought, I looked up, and there I met the eyes of a charming, young lady.Of course I remember her sweet face. It was that of the pretty defendant there.The only other thing I saw was the banana that fell with the police officer.Judge:Hmm, that was certainly a decisive testimony.Maya:Decisive!? Nick, did you hear what he just said!?Phoenix:Yeah.Maya:That's all you have to say? How can you be so calm!?Phoenix:(It's strange... My mind is very calm and clear.) Maybe it's because I... believe in my client.Maya:You mean Maggey?Phoenix:Yes. And if she really is innocent, then that can only mean one thing: That guy is lying!Judge:You may now question the witness, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:(I'll find out the truth, no matter how well you craft your lies!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What I Saw That Day --Wellington:I was at the park all afternoon, deep in thought about my life situation.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So you were at the park all afternoon? You seem to have a lot of free time. Wellington:Hmph. That was very rude of you. But then again, what can I expect? That's what you get from a man who graduated from a no-name, trashy university. Phoenix:N-No name? Trashy...? Wellington:Now, this might be hard for a mush-headed, feeble-minded baboon like you, but I have to think very carefully about the future of our great country. Phoenix:But I thought you said you were thinking about which college to go to just now... Wellington:Oh, puh-leaze. Which university I go to will directly affect the very future of this country! Phoenix:(That arrogant little snot...)Wellington:I don't remember the time all that well, but I do believe it was past 6 PM.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:How did you know what time it was? I see you're not wearing a watch, so... Wellington:Is that the best you can do? Do you think you can discredit me like that? You're just a third-rate, biased fool. I guess I can't expect real smarts from you. Phoenix:(Grr... His arrogance is really intolerable... So, what should I do now...?)Press harderPhoenix:Answer the question! How did you know what time it was!?Wellington:Tsk, tsk. I can't believe I have to deal with a worm like you. You're just a shallow man who can only slam on desks and point at people for fun. Hmph, I guess I don't have a choice. I'll try to explain it so that even a third-rate simpleton like you can understand. There was this little thing they call a \"clock\" at the park. Did you get that? Do you know what a clock is? It's a thing that tells you the time.Payne:As you can see, Mr. Wright, it's even in this picture of the crime scene.Phoenix:(Oh... So it is... Urk.)Wellington:I looked at that clock, and that's how I knew the time. But if you ask me, this whole concept of breaking time apart into fragments... It's total and utter nonsense that no man should follow. A real first-class person doesn't live by, nor is he chained by, time. And to wear a watch? Hah! What a ridiculous notion! People should live freely without constraints. That's how life should be!Phoenix:(And yet again, another flood of meaningless words...

It was also the way he tied his tie and those cheap, low-quality shoes. Ugh. Oh, and I suppose it was also because he was wearing an officer's uniform.Phoenix:(Shouldn't that statement have come first!?)Maya:Wow, that's pretty impressive. Hey, Nick! Do you think he's figured out what I do?Phoenix:(Even I haven't figured that out yet...)Wellington:Without a thought, I looked up, and there I met the eyes of a charming, young lady.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you sure you got a good look at her face?Wellington:Animals have this thing called an \"eye\", Mr. Wright. They use this \"eye\" to see things. In the case of humans, we have two of them. Yes, even you!Phoenix:I don't care if I have them or not! Did you or did you not get a clear look at her face!?Payne:Payne:That's what the witness was just about to get to. I would like to request that Mr. Wright not use such a loud voice during questioning.Judge:Sustained. Mr. Wright, please refrain from raising your voice in this court.Phoenix:(Then please don't make me have to raise my voice.)Wellington:Are you finished?

He could be, but... there's no reason for him to lie about there being bananas at the crime scene.)

Were you wearing your glasses then?Wellington:...!Phoenix:How about it, witness!?Wellington:Y-You are an unrelenting, evil man. You're like those people who rejected Joan of Arc and put her to death! She was brave and courageous, only to be caught by horrible, unrighteous people. And while she didn't do anything wrong, she was still gruesomely burned at the--Phoenix:Which boils down to you were not wearing your glasses at that time! Therefore! The identity of the \"woman\" at the scene of the crime and that of the defendant cannot be proven to be the same by this witness!Wellington:...!Payne:Payne:But the height difference was only 9 feet! It was very possible for him to see the face of the culprit standing on the upper path!Judge:Hmm... Witness. Please be more accurate in your testimony. Remember, a person's life is at stake.Wellington:Y-Yes, Your Honor!Judge:Now then, please continue with your testimony.Payne:Please tell the court what happened next, in the moments after you witnessed the crime.Witness Testimony-- What Happened Next --Wellington:The girl on the upper path ran away as soon as she realized I was there.After that, I immediately called the police station to report the crime.It must've been 6:45 PM when I made the call.They must have a lot of free time on their hands since they showed up within 10 minutes.Judge:Hmm... So the person who was on the upper path saw you and then ran away.Wellington:Yes, that is correct. Which is why, even someone without a superior brain like mine can understand that... that girl is the murderer!Judge:You may question the witness now, Mr. Wright.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What Happened Next --Wellington:The girl on the upper path ran away as soon as she realized I was there.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:She ran away, just like that?Wellington:Yes, she did. She saw me and flew the nest like the guilty bird she is. Oh, I'm sorry. Was that pun too hard for someone who only got a third-rate education?Phoenix:(Actually, that did take me a few seconds to get...) Anyway, if she ran away the instant she saw you, how could you tell it was my client?Wellington:Eek!Payne:Payne:The witness has already answered that question. He has stated that the defendant is the culprit!Judge:This is true. Mr. Wright, I'm striking your question from the record.Phoenix:(Hmm, how can I get more information out of him?)Wellington:After that, I immediately called the police station to report the crime.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Immediately? As in?Wellington:As in immediately! I mean, sure, a minute might have elapsed before I did, but... That's the duty of every good citizen, or did they not teach that at your pitiful school?Phoenix:(You think people learn about how to call the police in COLLEGE!?)Maya:Hey, Nick. I think you should take a look at the Court Record for a sec.Phoenix:(...?)Present Dustin's Autopsy ReportPhoenix:Leads to:\"Mr. Wellington, would you please take a look at this?\"Wellington:It must've been 6:45 PM when I made the call.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:How do you know what time it was...?Wellington:That detective told me. You know which one I mean. The one with the jacket that makes him look like a dropout from a no-name high school.Gumshoe:Hey, pal! I graduated from a pretty good, I mean, top-ranked college!Phoenix:(I don't believe this.)Wellington:It doesn't matter. I don't believe I was mistaken on what time I called. And if I am wrong, then that detective obviously doesn't know how to tell time.Gumshoe:What!? Why you!!! You're just some lousy kid who...Payne:I think the court can see your point. Anyway, how did the police respond?Present Dustin's Autopsy ReportPhoenix:Leads to:\"Mr. Wellington, would you please take a look at this?\"Wellington:They must have a lot of free time on their hands since they showed up within 10 minutes.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So you're saying that there were police on the scene by 7:00 PM?Wellington:They got there before that, I think. There usually aren't many people in that area at that time of day. But suddenly, before I knew it, there were people crawling all over gawking. It certainly says something about the morals of the people in this country.Phoenix:(I can't find anything out of the ordinary in his testimony...)Maya:Why don't you take one more look at the Court Record?Phoenix:Yeah, I guess I should.",

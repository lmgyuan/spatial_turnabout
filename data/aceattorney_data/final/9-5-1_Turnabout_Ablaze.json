One to the west... ...and one to the east. When those which were split are made whole again... ...the truth will reveal itself.I-It's the Yatagarasu! The Yatagarasu's here!Edgeworth:You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...!-- 8 Hours Earlier --March 14, 10:17 AMHigh Prosecutors' Offices - Room 1202Edgeworth:(It's so nice, almost dreamlike, to finally have the chance to relax and sip some tea. Especially after what a whirlwind the past few days have been.) On my return flight, I was dragged into a case involving an Interpol agent's murder. The next day, I investigated a kidnapping and a murder at the Gatewater Land theme park. And later that night, a detective's dead body welcomed me back to my office... ...along with a thief who was out to pilfer files related to a case from 10 years ago. (How did I manage to find myself in the middle of so many cases back to back? Well, at least I have today. All I ask is that I be allowed to spend it quietly.)???:Mr. Edgewooooorth! This is big! Big, I tell you! ...Hey, what's wrong with you? Where's your enthusiasm...?Edgeworth:And suddenly, the phrase \"the fragility of dreams\" comes to mind...Kay:What are you talking about, \"fragile dreams\"!? Come on, let's go! The fake Yatagarasu isn't going to just find herself, you know!Edgeworth:Well, if you must know... it's possible that I was paid a visit last night by your \"fake\".Kay:Say what?Edgeworth:.........Edgeworth:Unfortunately for us, the thief managed to escape. But even now, we're still looking for this criminal. However, I must warn you that we've only had a few hours to search so far... ...so I must insist that you be patient on this one, Kay.Kay:Wh-What's with you today...? Are you sure you aren't sleep-talking to me right now? Anyway, I've got something much more important that I want you to see!Edgeworth:Oh, and that is?Kay:Take a look at this!Edgeworth:\"On March 14th, I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" That's quite a bold declaration to send to an embassy... (I suppose it was inevitable that a newspaper would catch wind of this.)Kay:The date the card mentions is today!Edgeworth:Today, huh...Kay:Come on, we've gotta hurry! The embassy awaits!Edgeworth:I suppose it IS quite an urgent matter... ...however, do you know which country's embassy we should be investigating?Kay:Well, it's some really special country, and I'm actually really fuzzy on the details... But never mind that! Where's all your energy!? Why are you so lackadaisical today!?Edgeworth:I'm not, Kay. You're just too wound up.Kay:Well, then you should get too wound up, too! Because this just might be our chance to catch that woman!Edgeworth:You mean Ms. Yew? (The woman who killed Kay's father, Byrne Faraday, seven years ago... Calisto Yew... She claimed to be the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and then disappeared from the courtroom.)Kay:Argh! She makes me so mad! The phony! Everyone knows that the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a calling card! Until a company's underhanded dealings are made public... ...the target is always totally unaware that the Yatagarasu has paid them a visit. That's what makes the real Yatagarasu so awesome!Edgeworth:Hmm... The Yatagarasu's card that's shown in this article... It looks to me as though it could be genuine.Kay:See, that's the thing. Whoever it is, that person isn't the real deal, but has knowledge of the Yatagarasu. If this isn't a clue that that woman's involved, then nothing is! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Out the door you go!Edgeworth:Wait, there are a few preparations I must make before we go... (There's something interesting about this card we found last night here in my office... It's of a different color than the one in the article, which makes me wonder why.)Kay:What's up? Any reason why you're boring a hole through the newspaper with your eyes?Edgeworth:No... No reason at all. Very well. Seeing as how Ms. Yew is also someone of a special nature to me... ...I agree there is some merit to be found in investigating this.Kay:I knew you'd come around!March 14, 5:00 PMTheatrum Neutralis???:By the light of this night's glorious moon... We are ready!Pink Princess:Ready to embark on our nightly outing.Steel Samurai:And this is where... ...our tale begins!Edgeworth:Heh... What a coincidence. Who would've thought that a Steel Samurai stage show... ...would ever be held at such an elegant theater inside a foreign embassy?Examine evidenceProsecutor's BadgeFront of badgeEdgeworth:This badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.Back of badgeEdgeworth:Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!Kay:Yeah! The climax was really awesome! \"Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\" I got chills down my spine when he pulled that move out!Edgeworth:I suppose it really is more impactful to watch a show in person than on television.Kay:I have to say, though, this embassy is set up kinda funny. I mean, they have two countries sharing the same building!Edgeworth:Well, as you said yourself, this place and the countries it houses are very special. Even this theater is special in that it is a neutral zone shared by the two countries.Kay:Umm... So, let me get this straight... The Steel Samurai show just now is being sponsored by one of the two countries. The one that's called the Kingdom of Allebahst, right?Edgeworth:Yes, it would appear that the Steel Samurai is very popular in that country as well.Kay:Seems that way! But you know who I'M really into? The Jammin' Ninja! The Republic of Babahl is sponsoring a Jammin' Ninja stage show! That's something for fangirls like me! We've totally gotta see that too, Mr. Edgeworth! The Jammin' Ninja's show is gonna kick the Steel Samurai show's rear end!Edgeworth:(You know, ever since I first met this girl, I've always had this inkling... ...that what she really wants to be... ...is not a thief, but rather, a ninja...)Kay:So anyway, about today's event... umm... What's it called again?Edgeworth:\"The Kingdom of Allebahst versus The Republic of Babahl Goodwill Jubilee\". The small, European countries of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...and the Republic of Babahl. These two countries used to be a single entity that was abundant with nature. And it was called... the Principality of Cohdopia. ..................Kay:Hm? Is everything alright, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:Yes, I'm alright. Moving on... After a period of civil unrest, the country split in two, though signs of their past remain. For example, their flags preserve the flower and butterfly motifs to this day. ......... (Cohdopia, huh... The KG-8 Incident... and what was referred to as the second KG-8 Incident... ...in which an Embassy staff member was murdered... Both of these cases were related to the Principality of Cohdopia. In the seven years that have passed, the country may have split into two... ...however, the Yatagarasu still sent a calling card here. What could it all mean?) .........Kay:Mr. Edgeworth... I know you're thinking about something!Edgeworth:Oh, excuse me. What were we talking about again?Kay:Argh, if you could please stop spacing out on me! Anyway, we were talking about the Allebahst versus Babahl Goodwill Jubilee. The two countries have had a pretty bad relationship with each other... ...but supposedly, they've been trying really hard to make up recently. That's why they decided to hold this event.Edgeworth:(If that's the case, then why the \"versus\"...?)Kay:Also, both countries claim to own the real \"Primidux Statue\", a national treasure to both. They're planning to have them publicly evaluated today, to see which one's the real deal.Edgeworth:Kay, need I remind you to take care and not succumb to your thieving desires?Kay:Well, when it comes to treasure, I can't help myself. You know that!Edgeworth:(Nngh... She had better be saying that in jest...)Kay:Hey! I can read your body language, you know! And you've got it all wrong! Look! I'm here to do some investigating! INVESTIGATING, I tell you!Edgeworth:Heh, I know. And although we don't know if the Yatagarasu will really make an appearance... ...I suppose we should still spend some time examining this place.TalkGuard by left doorGuard:Is there something I can help you with?Edgeworth:I was wondering what is beyond these doors.Guard:It's the Allebahstian Embassy. Now, unless you have some business with the Embassy...Edgeworth:(I suppose I can't really claim to have any business with the Embassy right now.)Kay:Well, you don't have to be so rude about it, Mr. Guard! Hrmph!Man in blue suitMan:Ten more minutes... No, in five more minutes... But isn't it really bad for me to spend time doing this? It's no use! Would someone please just tell me what I should do!Edgeworth:You appear to be troubled by something. May I be of any assistance?Man:Leave me alone! I'm trying to figure out just the right time to talk to that girl over there! And if I mess up, it'll be because I'm talking to you right now!Kay:Somehow, I get the feeling he's about to fall flat on his face.Edgeworth:Well, let's just do as he wishes and leave him alone.Girls by pamphletsFan:You know, I've seen a lot of these shows in a bunch of other places... ...but today's show, it was like they went for a complete comedy, know what I mean?Friend:Yeah, And that last move, the Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Sushi Slice] in the original release)... I couldn't help but laugh!Fan:I know, right!? And that Pink Princess's movements were really stiff. In the middle of the show, I could swear that I heard her hip crack.Friend:Oh, I know! I totally thought that, too! The Pink Princess has a bad hip!? Seriously!? Just what were they thinking, you know!?Edgeworth:(I suppose there is no graceful way to enter this conversation...)Man in green suitMan:This is... the perfect angle!Edgeworth:?Man:Go, my image! Travel across the wave world and into every TV set around the globe!Edgeworth:(A more honest approach to appearing on TV might serve your ambitions better...)ReporterReporter:And we're here, reporting live from the Theatrum Neutralis. As you can see, tonight's audience is full of enthusiasm! Let's see what this member of the audience has to say.Edgeworth:W-Well, I...Cameraman:OK, that was good. Let's do one more run-through!Edgeworth:Excuse me, but when you are ready to film for real, would you mind giving me a call...? (I sense that she didn't hear a single world I just said.)CameramanCameraman:OK, OK, that's good. Alright, now give me a dramatic \"slam!\" right there! Stop! Stoooop! Hey, do you mind!? Get out of the way, buddy. OK, once more! In 3, 2, 1, action!Edgeworth:Kay, was that my fault just now?Kay:Well, he's obviously working... I guess we should leave him alone.Boy by TVEdgeworth:(It appears that the child is watching a video from the first season of the Steel Samurai.)Child:\u266aGo! Go! Keep on fighting, until your last breath!\u266a \u266aGo, my hero, the Steel Samurai!\u266aEdgeworth:(Completely absorbed in singing the theme song, I see... I'll let the child watch in peace.)Camerawoman (Lotta Hart)Cameraman:Where in tarnation are they!? Come on, big scoop! Hey, mister! Outta the way! Yeah, I'm talkin' to ya!Edgeworth:Nngh... (I seem to remember this woman from somewhere... ...yet my instincts are directing me not to engage in conversation with her. Perhaps it would be best if I left her alone.)Guard by right doorGuard:Is there something I can help you with?Edgeworth:I was wondering what is beyond these doors.Guard:The Babahlese Embassy is just beyond these doors, sir. Do you have some business with the Embassy? Do you require immediate access?Edgeworth:Ah, no, that's quite alright.Guard:Are you sure, sir? Anyone and everyone is always welcome in the Republic of Babahl!Kay:Well, then! Since we're here!Edgeworth:An embassy isn't some sort of theme park, Kay.Kay:Tch! You're such a buzz kill!ExaminePamphletsEdgeworth:There are pamphlets about the two embassies here on this table.Kay:Hmm... It still looks weird to me.Edgeworth:The country split into two a few years back. And they've shared the building and its grounds 50-50 ever since.Kay:Oh? I guess it's because they don't have the money to build two separate ones, huh?Edgeworth:I-I should think that's not the reason why, Kay.Flag by left doorEdgeworth:The national flag of the Kingdom of Allebahst is on display here. The crest on it features a flower.Kay:Flowers and butterflies are kind of rare motifs for flags, don't you think?Edgeworth:Well, when they used to be Cohdopia, the government used to take pride in its land. The citizens also loved the rich, bountiful nature all around them, thus the design.Kay:Hey, if the Steel Samurai got popular enough, do you think they'd put him on their flag?Edgeworth:Are you in your right mind, Kay?Kay:Hmm... Or maybe the Jammin' Ninja would make a better candidate...?Edgeworth:(Hah, don't make me laugh (changed from [Heh, don't make me laugh, Kay] in the original release). Only the Steel Samurai deserves such an honor.)Flowers on left sideKay:Those are some nice flowers! I wonder who they're from? \"Gatewater Imperial Hotel\"? Where's this, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:Ah, it's an ultra-luxurious hotel that sponsors the Steel Samurai series. I've been there once to investigate a case.Kay:Oh? So what kind of case was it?Edgeworth:I believe it was related to the Nickel Samurai and the Jammin' Ninja...Kay:Oh, I remember reading about that! You must be the head of Steel Samurai affairs down at the Prosecutor's Office, huh?Edgeworth:(I should think that even you can figure that such an office does not exist, Kay.)TVEdgeworth:There is a flat-panel, a tape deck, and a row of Steel Samurai videos on this table. I suppose it's so visitors can watch an episode or two at their leisure.Kay:I guess it really is just that popular, huh?Edgeworth:Yes, although I never thought I would see it reach this level of popularity...Kay:I wonder why they decided to call on the Steel Samurai for an event like this? I mean, it's like they intended to cut the two countries apart with the Samurai Sword instead!Edgeworth:(Wouldn't that go against the whole point of this event...?)Flowers on right sideEdgeworth:These flowers were sent by Global Studios.Kay:Global Studios?Edgeworth:That's where they film the Steel Samurai television show. They have been producing hit after hit recently, so the studio is being remodeled.Kay:Oh! I read about that in the papers the other day! That mascot of theirs is also getting a face-lift, too, right? Umm... what's its name?Edgeworth:You mean Mrs. Monkey?Kay:Yeah, I thought it was something like that! You really have a great memory!Edgeworth:Hah! Never underestimate my powers of recollection.Flag by right doorEdgeworth:The national flag of the Republic of Babahl is on display here. The crest on it features a butterfly.Kay:It's really rare to see a national flag featuring an animal on it!Edgeworth:Not really. I can list at least a few off for you that do.Kay:OK, then are there any flags with really chic things on them?Edgeworth:\"Chic\" things? That's pretty vague, Kay... Although, by my definition, there aren't really any flags that feature a \"chic\" object.Kay:Aww, that's too bad. Because if there was, I was thinking about stealing it...Edgeworth:(And what exactly would you do with a stolen national flag, Kay...?)PartnerEdgeworth:There's a very festive atmosphere in here.Kay:Yup, super festive! I'm really happy for the Kingdom of Allebahst and the Republic of Babahl. It's great that they have re-established diplomatic relations! The newspapers say that it's almost like they're Cohdopia once again.Edgeworth:Perhaps we are bearing witness to a historic moment in time.Kay:Hey! Look! They're selling some commemorative merchandise to celebrate this event! Founder's Cohdopia Biscuits. And over here, they're selling Royal Cohdopia Biscuits.Edgeworth:...It would seem that they have yet to reconcile their competitive spirits.After examining pamphlets:Edgeworth:I suppose I'll just help myself to one of these...Embassy Guide stuck into the pages of my Organizer.Edgeworth:(Hm? What is all the hubbub?) Ack!Kay:Hey, look! It's the Steel Samurai! And he's got his son, the Iron Infant, with him!!TalkSteel SamuraiLeads to:\"May I speak with you for a second?\"Edgeworth:May I speak with you for a second? (...It's... the Steel Samurai...)Steel Samurai:.........Edgeworth:.........Kay:Mr. Edgeworth! What are you glaring at him for!?Edgeworth:Ahem, please excuse me. It's just that I've never seen a super-hero up close before.Steel Samurai:.........Kay:It looks like he's written something down for you!Edgeworth:\"To Edgeworth, From Steel Samurai Daddy: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo\"Kay:Wow, an autograph! Pretty cool that you got one, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:Heh...Steel Samurai's Autograph received.Guard:Mr. Steel Samurai! Ambassador Alba is waiting for you!Reporter:And now the Steel Samurai... ...will proceed to enter the Kingdom of Allebahst to shake the hand of the ambassador. The Steel Samurai isn't only here for the two countries tonight... ...but rather, can be thought of as a goodwill ambassador from our own country as well!Kay:There he goes. Off to spread goodwill to the world.Edgeworth:He really does seem like a goodwill ambassador, doesn't he?Cameraman:OK! We're shooting the next segment now! Cue camera!Reporter:In just a few seconds, the Jammin' Ninja stage show is set to begin. After the show, the Jammin' Ninja will enter the Republic of Babahl. He is set to meet with the Ambassador of Babahl at that time.Kay:AHH! The Jammin' Ninja's show is about to start! We've gotta get back to our seats!Edgeworth:Regrettably... I don't have much of an interest in ninjas...Kay:Well, this show will change your mind! Come on, we have to hurry! If we miss even a second of the Jammin' Ninja's awesome playing, I'll never forgive you!Edgeworth:(Nngh... I suppose you're not about to give me much of a choice here, are you, Kay?)Kay:Ahhh! I could listen to that \"A Ninja Marked for Death's Lullaby\" song all day! His superb playing and that sad melody really brought a tear to my eye! And his heart-wrenching voice! Now THAT'S the Jammin' Ninja's greatest weapon!Edgeworth:..................Kay:Ahh! Those pieces of Jammin' Ninja merchandise over there! I've got to have them! I especially want the hair sticks they're selling exclusively at these shows. They're exactly like the ones the heroine, Princess Misola, wears in her hair!Edgeworth:...Anyway.Kay:Anyway!? ANYWAY!? Hold it right there, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:Yes?Kay:You're thinking of going home, aren't you!?Edgeworth:Well, it doesn't seem likely that the Yatagarasu will be making an appearance tonight. Most likely, it was simply a prank.Kay:No way! I just know the Yatagarasu will show!Edgeworth:But I thought you said that the Yatagarasu doesn't send calling cards.Kay:Yeah, I did, but...Edgeworth:I figured from the very beginning that this would wind up being a wild goose chase.Kay:But that card she sent was a genuine fake calling card!Edgeworth:A genuine fake...?Kay:Well, how can I word this...? The Yatagarasu's mark that's on the calling card is exactly the same as my mark. Get it now?Officer:W-We've got a problem! Th-The Yatagarasu has been spotted in Allebahst!Edgeworth:What!?Kay:You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Hah! So you finally decided to show yourself, you phony! Hey, what gives!?Guard:I'm sorry but I will need to search you before you may enter.Kay:What the!? Hey! The Steel Samurai just waltzed straight on through without one! Now if you don't hurry up and let me through, my phony is going to escape!Edgeworth:Kay, a country's embassy is considered to be a part of the country itself. If you don't go through the proper procedures to enter the country...Kay:Mr. Edgeworth! I'm going to enter through Babahl and climb over the wall into Allebahst!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:You would tell a prosecutor straight out that you intend to illegally enter another... Kay, are you listening to me!?Kay:Kay Faraday, and I'm coming through!Guard:Yes, and welcome!Edgeworth:Someone stop her! Anyone!March 14, 6:12 PMOpen-Air StageEdgeworth:*huff, huff, huff*... Kay... Where are you? Don't tell me you really did find some way over this fence... Ack!Guard:Fire! This is too big for us to handle! Looks like the Yatagarasu came to Babahl, too!Edgeworth:You... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! You had better be alright, wherever you are!March 14, 6:45 PMBabahlese Embassy - Secretariat's OfficeKay:I told you! It wasn't me!Shih-na:..................Edgeworth:Edgeworth:*huff, huff, huff*... Kay! Are you alright!?Kay:Do I look alright to you!? Now, can you do something about this woman!?Gumshoe:Mr. Edgeworth...Edgeworth:Detective Gumshoe! What is the meaning of this!?Gumshoe:*sigh* Well, sir... it's um, this.Edgeworth:He's...!Kay:It wasn't me! He was already dead when I ran in here, hot on the heels of the fake Yatagarasu! Look, I only came in here because I saw a suspicious person at the open-air stage!Edgeworth:A suspicious person?Kay:A long, black coat and a hood over their head -- I dare you to tell me that's not suspicious! When I saw that person, I immediately thought that they must be the fake Yatagarasu. So I chased after them into the Embassy, then into here, and then lost sight of them... But I just KNOW that person is the one who did it!Shih-na:What are you so worked up over? There is no reason for you to be this loud.Edgeworth:Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're Agent Lang's secretary... ...Shih-na, I believe your name is, correct?Shih-na:..................Edgeworth:And if you are making an arrest... ...I assume you have evidence that it was Kay who committed the crime, is that also correct?Shih-na:..................Edgeworth:You refuse to answer!?Shih-na:I don't need to answer.Edgeworth:!Shih-na:You are merely a prosecutor in this country, meaning you have no investigative authority.Gumshoe:H-Hey, pal! Just what the heck does what you just said mean!? If it happened here, it's under Mr. Edgeworth's jurisdiction. The end. And seeing as how this building is sitting on our soil, we can investigate wherever we'd like!Edgeworth:Unfortunately, Detective, embassies are a different matter.Gumshoe:Huh?Edgeworth:This office is considered to be a part of the Republic of Babahl. Which means that anything that happens in here... ...defaults to the control of the Babahlese government and Babahlese law... ...giving them exclusive extraterritorial rights.Gumshoe:Extraterrestrial (changed from [Extraterristrial] in the original release, correcting the typo) rights? Sir, do you really believe that the truth is out there!?Edgeworth:*sigh* Basically, our country's laws do not apply inside the embassy of another country. That's what was agreed to by our respective governments. Our authority to investigate was effectively nullified the second we entered this place. Which means we can do little here in this situation...Gumshoe:N-No way, sir!Shih-na:Please leave this matter in Interpol's hands and go home.Edgeworth:N...Nnnnngh...Gumshoe:M-Mr. Edgeworth...Kay:H-Hey, you're not...!? Mr. Edgeworth!???:???:In that case... allow me to join your investigation.Gumshoe:M-Ms. von Karma! Eeek!Franziska:Ambassador Palaeno, I truly appreciate you allowing me to join the investigation.Palaeno:It's really nothing. Manny was my secretariat, so of course I want to help you as much as I can. In fact, it's a blessing that Interpol agents were able to make it so quickly.Edgeworth:Franziska...Franziska:Well, well. I never imagined that I'd meet you here of all places. This is an embassy, meaning that you have no authority to conduct...Edgeworth:Franziska:A-Already!? What is it!?Edgeworth:Ambassador Palaeno.Palaeno:Hm? And you are?Edgeworth:I'm Miles Edgeworth, public prosecutor. I ask that you please allow me to investigate this case as Ms. von Karma's assistant.Gumshoe:A...Assistant?Franziska:Miles!? What the heck do you think you're...!?Edgeworth:Please, I implore you, Ambassador Palaeno.Palaeno:Very well. I'll be counting on the two of you, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth.Gumshoe:Umm... What did you mean by you'll be Ms. von Karma's assistant...?Edgeworth:I don't exactly have a choice, do I, Detective? If I don't become Franziska's assistant, I can't participate in this investigation.Franziska:Hmph. There you go again, running at the mouth with that aloof expression on your face.Edgeworth:Franziska, please...Franziska:I don't know what you're planning quite yet... ...but at least I do know one thing -- that you are now my subordinate. Just remember that my whip is always ready to wake you, should you have a brain lapse.Edgeworth:Of course. I'll keep that in mind.Shih-na:...If you are done playing games...!Edgeworth:Right. let's begin the investigation.Begin InvestigationBabahlese Embassy - Secretariat's OfficeEdgeworth:By the way, Detective... I suppose it's a bit late to be asking, but why are you here?Gumshoe:Well, better late than never, I guess, sir. I was placed on guard duty for the Babahlese Embassy today!Edgeworth:And why are our police guarding an embassy?Gumshoe:Well, on account of the card they got from the Yatagarasu... ...they called us up and asked for our help, sir. Oh, and because we've been searching for the Yatagarasu these past seven years! It was a more or less mutually beneficial arrangement, if you ask me!Edgeworth:Except for how mutually unbeneficial this has all turned out to be, I suppose. It looks like you failed to competently perform your guard duty yet again.Gumshoe:Ack...!Edgeworth:Look forward to your next salary negotiation... although, it's out of my hands.Gumshoe:But sir! If it gets cut any more, I won't be able to buy even instant (changed from [packet] in the original release) noodles anymore...TalkFranziska von KarmaFranziska:Miles Edgeworth!Edgeworth:What is it?Franziska:Let me tell you something. You are currently my subordinate. And if you wish to convince everyone else of that, you will speak to me with respect!Edgeworth:(What's with the giddy glint in her eyes?) I don't think that will really be necessary, Franziska.Franziska:Oh, really? Well, it doesn't matter. It doesn't change the fact that you are still under me.Edgeworth:(I thought Franziska was flying around the world in pursuit of the smuggling case. So then, why is she here at this embassy (Franziska's return - Why is she here when she is supposed to be overseas in pursuit of a smuggling ring?)...?)TalkThe murderFranziska:I was investigating at the Allebahstian Embassy when I got wind of this mess.Edgeworth:Ah, that's right. The Yatagarasu was due to appear at that embassy as well.Franziska:Yes, but the difference is that we didn't have a fire over there. Although, there was an incident at the Allebahstian Embassy as well... But I left Agent Lang in charge of that case and came over to the Babahlese Embassy.Edgeworth:Ah... So Agent Lang is here as well, huh?Franziska:I see you've met. Well, he's in the Allebahstian Embassy acting as body guard for Ambassador Alba. ...However, he seems to have a different reason for being there.Yatagarasu (appears after \"The murder\")Franziska:So the suspect in the murder that occurred in this office is that little girl, I see. Is she, perhaps, trying to be the Yatagarasu?Gumshoe:K-Kay would never harm a soul, sir!Franziska:...Kay?Edgeworth:You remember, do you not? About the case we investigated together seven years ago? That girl is the daughter of the victim in that case, Mr. Faraday.Franziska:! So she's that feisty little girl...Edgeworth:Kay has been on the trail of the Yatagarasu, which is how she ended up here... ...looking for the one who took her father's life.Franziska:...I see.Gumshoe:Kay's trying so hard, but you know what!? The Yatagarasu just keeps on tricking us all!Edgeworth:Hm...? How so?Gumshoe:The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret (Stealing of secret - The card warned that the Yatagarasu will steal the embassy's 'dirtiest secret'.)\"... ...but all we've had is an arson and a murder! The lab boys are going in circles! You know what this is, sirs!? It's a breach of contract, and it's going on the rap sheet!Franziska:If you ask me, I'm perfectly fine with the fact that nothing was stolen tonight.Edgeworth:(I do wonder, though, if Calisto Yew really is the Yatagarasu...)Smuggling (appears after connecting \"Stealing of secret\" and \"Franziska's return\" Logic)Edgeworth:Franziska, when we last talked, you said that you were on the trail of a smuggling ring. I suppose the reason you are here right now is related to that?Franziska:...Yes. After analyzing the intel we've gathered from various countries... ...this embassy... rose to the top of our list of sites to investigate. And this is what tipped us off.Edgeworth:This accounting document...?Franziska:It's only one page of the whole thing, so we're not sure about all the details... ...however, it's enough for us to grab onto the tail of the beast. For you see... this type of paper was made only in the Principality (changed from [Kingdom] in the original release) of Cohdopia. Which means that somewhere in the countries of Allebahst and Babahl is the head! The one pulling the strings behind the entire smuggling ring!Edgeworth:(That's Franziska for you... She's amazing -- pursuing this case with all she has.)Cohdopian Paper Document data jotted down in my Organizer.Smuggling (subsequent times)Edgeworth:Franziska, when we last talked, you said that you were on the trail of a smuggling ring. I suppose the reason you are here right now is related to that?Franziska:...Yes. After analyzing the intel we've gathered from various countries... ...this embassy... rose to the top of our list of sites to investigate. And this is what tipped us off.Edgeworth:This accounting document...?Franziska:It's only one page of the whole thing, so we're not sure about all the details... ...however, it's enough for us to grab onto the tail of the beast.

She's amazing -- pursuing this case with all she has.)PresentProsecutor's BadgeFranziska:What about your Prosecutor's Badge? I have one, too, you know.Edgeworth:Ah, yes... So you do. But seeing as I'm not currently a proper prosecutor, I thought I'd give presenting it a try.Franziska:............ Is that any way for you to act towards your superior!?Edgeworth:As if threatening a whipping is the proper way of lecturing someone!Notes on Coachen's BodyFranziska:It appears that he died of a stab wound. Arngh!! Whoever did this had a lot of nerve! I just can't fathom what could've led the killer to turn a knife against a man!Edgeworth:And I just can't fathom what the prosecutor lashing out with her whip is thinking...Knife or Yatagarasu's KeyFranziska:Would you mind not pointing that in my direction? It's dangerous. And anyway, why are you showing it to me?Edgeworth:I have no particular reason...Franziska:!!Edgeworth:Gnnrk!Franziska:If you have no reason! Don't you bring that dangerous object near me! Do you understand!?Edgeworth:! (I-Is she really that oblivious to the irony in that statement? She lets loose that dangerous whip of hers for no reason all the time!)Cohdopian Paper DocumentFranziska:We were able to finally obtain this proof of the smuggling operation through Interpol. So remember to take extra care when handling it... my subordinate.Edgeworth:*sigh*... (She's enjoying the power trip of calling me her subordinate just a taaaad too much...)Anything elseEdgeworth:Ms. von Karma, what do you think of this piece of evidence?Franziska:Hmph, well, since you asked so nicely as my subordinate, I'll answer you. However, as your superior, I also must make sure that my subordinates grow on the job. Therefore, please gather your own thoughts together first, and then try presenting again.Edgeworth:(A simple, \"I don't have any thoughts about that\" would've sufficed...)Colias PalaenoPalaeno:I can't believe that Manny fell among thieves tonight... Without him, I have no idea what my schedule for tonight is.Edgeworth:Ambassador Palaeno, I believe your schedule tonight will consist of... ...listening to reports from the police. That and only that. I ask you to cooperate not only for your own sake, but for Mr. Coachen's as well.Palaeno:...You're a rather strong man, aren't you? How fascinating! Here, I know it isn't much, but I'd like you to have these.Edgeworth:I'm sorry, but it would be against my principles to accept a bribe.Palaeno:Oh, no, no. These are simply coupons we distribute to promote Babahl. Remember, we offer a large number of discounts and offers when you visit lovely Babahl!Edgeworth:(Now I remember. The Republic of Babahl is known for its feverish tourism industry...)TalkManny CoachenEdgeworth:I was wondering if you might tell me a bit about the deceased, Manny Coachen.Palaeno:He was my secretary, and the embassy secretariat, charged with running the whole place. He was an admirable man. His death is a great loss to our country. He was in charge of everything, accounting, printing, taking care of our national treasures...Edgeworth:I'm sorry, but did you say \"printing\"?Palaeno:Our country's primary source of revenue is our tourism industry. So, in order for us to print the necessary pamphlets, flyers, coupons, etcetera... ...we have a printing press here at our embassy.Edgeworth:I see. Please excuse my forwardness, however... ...I feel I should mention that I have the distinct impression that I've met him before.Palaeno:! Oh, yes... Since you are of the legal profession, I suppose you just might have. After all, Manny was involved in the KG-8 Incident.Edgeworth:Th-The KG-8 Incident!?Palaeno:The defendant who was found innocent in that case was Manny.Edgeworth:So your Mr. Coachen is the same man as the one in that case...Palaeno:It's been 10 years. Manny recovered personally from that case, and dove enthusiastically into this job. He was the one who planned this event, and was to oversee this embassy's renovations. It really is a shame. He had such a bright future ahead of him.Renovations (appears after \"Manny Coachen\")Edgeworth:What exactly did you mean earlier by \"renovations\"?Palaeno:We can't have tourists and visitors to our embassy think we're a poor nation, can we? So renovating the embassy is something of an investment. We may have a rather paltry budget, but we're trying our best to make do (changed from [due] in the original release, correcting the typo). However... ...I guess the only person who could've helped us do our best is now no longer with us.Cohdopia (appears after examining key on body and clearing \"Manny Coachen\" Talk option)Edgeworth:Ambassador Palaeno, I was wondering if I may ask you about Cohdopia.Palaeno:Cohdopia? Alright. What would you like to talk about?Edgeworth:First... I'd like to ask you about this key.Palaeno:Hm? What about this key?Edgeworth:I found it sticking out of Mr. Coachen's pocket. I believe it originally belonged to this embassy. Is that correct?Palaeno:Hmm... Upon closer inspection, it seems that this key is shaped like a butterfly.Edgeworth:That's not all about this key. It's also capable of changing into a knife.Palaeno:Oh! How fascinating!Edgeworth:(Is it possible that the ambassador didn't know about the existence of this key...?)Palaeno:...Hm? In its knife form, there is a flower mark at the base of the blade. Hmm... I guess this knife might be from when we used to be a part of Cohdopia.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:And how did you come to that conclusion?Palaeno:It has both of Cohdopia's national symbols, the butterfly and the flower. I suppose Manny used this key here at the embassy (Key used at Embassy - This key was stolen from the Cohdopian Embassy 7 years ago by the Yatagarasu.) back when we were still Cohdopia.Franziska:Ambassador Palaeno, this key was stolen from the Cohdopian Embassy seven years ago... ...by Calisto Yew, otherwise known as the Great Thief Yatagarasu.Palaeno:! O-Oh, really?Edgeworth:You were not aware that Ms. Yew had broken into this embassy at that time?Palaeno:I'm sorry I can't be of much help. I'm not very familiar with the details, you see. I only became the ambassador after Babahl became its own independent nation. But if Manny were still alive, he would probably know about what happened back then...Edgeworth:(Mr. Coachen and Ms. Yew knew each other seven years ago... But that doesn't explain why I found the Yatagarasu's Key here in the present.)PresentProsecutor's BadgePalaeno:Oh, is that a Prosecutor's Badge? It has a very cool design! Aha! I know! We should start selling items like this as souvenirs in Babahl! The tourists will absolutely go nuts over them!Edgeworth:(Please don't compare a proud symbol of my profession to a cheap souvenir...)Embassy GuidePalaeno:Oh, isn't that about our great embassy? Ah... How do you like our pamphlets?Edgeworth:I feel indifferent about them, to be honest. I'm just using this as evidence.Palaeno:Oh, that's too bad... In that case, I guess we'll just have to try harder to make more charming ones!\u00a0! I-I just had a flash of inspiration! We should make all of our pamphlets into coupon books!Edgeworth:............ (His expectations of what a coupon can do is just a tad hyper-inflated.)Notes on Coachen's Body or KnifePalaeno:Oh, dear... If people were to find out that a murder occurred at our embassy... ...the number of tourists would plummet, as would our revenues! It'd be a disaster! What are we going to do...?Edgeworth:(He really does seem worried. Perhaps I should refrain from bringing this up...)Babahl's Primidux StatuePalaeno:This statue resembles that hero, the Steel Samurai, don't you think? I was thinking, what would you say to changing its name to the \"Steel Samurai Statue\"? It just might attract a few more tourists to our country if I did, right?Edgeworth:I-I'm not sure what to think... (I thought that thing was a national treasure...)Anything elseEdgeworth:Ambassador Palaeno, I was wondering if you might have some thoughts on this.Palaeno:I think that you would know more about the case than I. So let me make it up to you for not knowing anything about that with these coupons!Edgeworth:...Thank you, however, I feel I must decline.OfficerOfficer:Sorry, but Interpol is still conducting its investigation beyond this point.Edgeworth:I'm a subordinate of Ms. von Karma. Is there some reason why I'm being denied access?Officer:My superior clearly stated, \"Don't you dare let anyone near the site, you got it!?\" If I let you examine the site, my superior would get really angry at me!Gumshoe:You know, Mr. Edgeworth... I feel really bad for the guy, so why don't we do as he says?Edgeworth:Yes... I suppose we might as well.Shih-na or Kay FaradayEdgeworth:Kay, are you alright?Kay:You believe me, don't you, Mr. Edgeworth? You don't think I did it, right!?Edgeworth:Yes, of course I don't. And I promise to prove that it wasn't you.Shih-na:That's enough chit-chat. You can investigate all you like, but it's only a matter of time before we take her in. It would be wise of you to give up while you can.Edgeworth:No, I don't think so. Kay isn't lying, and my investigation will prove that to be true.Shih-na:Go ahead and try then, if you're that confident.Edgeworth:(I can't allow this to continue on this way. I must prove her innocence post haste!)ExamineFireplaceGumshoe:That's some fireplace! You know, it really gives this place a mansion-like quality, don't you think, sir!? Ooh! If these are a staple in every Babahlese house... ...then I bet Santa Claus pays them a visit, too.Edgeworth:(Just how old are you again, Detective...?)SafeEdgeworth:A small, personal safe...Franziska:This was Mr. Coachen's office. So perhaps he stored his most important documents in here.Edgeworth:Ah, of course it's locked. It appears we won't be able to open it without the key (Locked safe - The secretariat's office safe. It can't be opened without the key.).BodyEdgeworth:So our victim... was the secretariat of this embassy, I take it.Franziska:Manny Coachen. I heard that he was an admirable person... very admirable.Edgeworth:The cause of death is a stab to the base of his neck... He was lax in watching his back.Franziska:We were fortunate that the fire missed our victim's body for the most part. If the fire had burned a bit longer, it would've made identifying him a hassle.Edgeworth:(So Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death in the middle of a raging fire...? What in the world happened inside this room?)Notes on Coachen's Body jotted down in my Organizer.Edgeworth:(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)BodyEdgeworth:(Hm? This man... Where do I know him from...?)WoundEdgeworth:It's a knife wound.Franziska:It's obvious what he was killed with, but I wonder if it's consistent with the wound?Shih-na:Indeed.KnifeEdgeworth:Is this knife the murder weapon...!?Shih-na:Some preliminary testing has been conducted. According to the results, the blood on that matches the victim's blood. The blade's shape was also found to be consistent with the stab wound.Edgeworth:I suppose this means that we now know that the crime was committed with this knife.Gumshoe:This knife's got some really fancy ornamentation going on, huh, sir? This thing practically screams \"ARTSY!\" at me, too! Although, it's also covered in blood, just like the last thing that I said was artsy...Franziska:Hmm, but the handle is pristine, there's not a single drop of blood on it. Speaking of the handle... I believe it has a butterfly motif (Motif on knife handle - A butterfly-shaped guard adorns the handle of the murder weapon.). It's very beautiful.Knife data jotted down in my Organizer.Knife (subsequent times)Edgeworth:Is this knife the murder weapon...!?Shih-na:Some preliminary testing has been conducted.

Isn't this the Yatagarasu's Key that was stolen seven years ago!?Franziska:What!? But that's...!Gumshoe:Huh? Seven years ag...oooh! You mean that case where I was framed, sir!?Edgeworth:Yes, it's the piece of evidence that stole the life of Kay's father seven years ago... ...which was then stolen by Calisto Yew.Gumshoe:Wh-What!? Mr. Faraday was killed with this key, sir!? I thought he was killed with a knife... Eeeek!Franziska:Scruffy! At the very least, try to remember the details of crimes you were a suspect in!Edgeworth:Franziska, as you will recall... ...Detective Gumshoe was not present when Ms. Yew made her escape. Plus, even among law enforcement, only a few knew of this key's existence. I doubt that a new rookie at the time would've been made privy to such knowledge.Gumshoe:Ooonnngh... I feel like the victim right now, all trampled on, sir!Edgeworth:Hmph... I suppose I'll just have to fill you in now. The secret to this key is...!Leads to examination of Yatagarasu's KeyExamine butterfly=shaped keyEdgeworth:It's not that far-fetched to think that the end of this key was meant to be a butterfly. The key maker must've been a true patriot to have fashioned this after the national symbol.Examine button in handleLeads to:\"Ohoooo!\"Gumshoe:Ohoooo! Wow, that's amazing, sir! It's like some kind of magic trick!Yatagarasu's Key data jotted down in my Organizer.Edgeworth:I knew it. This is the same exact piece of evidence that Ms. Yew took with her... I remember this beautiful pattern in the blade.Franziska:I remember this as well. It's a vine motif, isn't it?Edgeworth:Yes, it looks like two interwoven vines, crisscrossing down the blade.Gumshoe:Vines, sirs? I think it looks like a bunch of stars, if you ask me. It's one of those six-sided stars, just like the police mark on our IDs!Edgeworth:I... really don't think you can call these stars. (...To say that the detective's art sense is underdeveloped would be an understatement.)Franziska:The real question is why was the Babahlese Embassy's secretariat holding this?Edgeworth:While we don't know how Mr. Coachen came to possess this key... ...we do know that this was stolen by the Yatagarasu from the Cohdopian Embassy.Franziska:That's right. Mr. Faraday had written that fact down in his organizer.Edgeworth:I believe this means that further research is required into the country of Cohdopia.Franziska:Why don't you ask Ambassador Palaeno about what he knows? Supposedly, he was a candidate to be the next Cohdopian ambassador once long ago. He should be able to answer any specific questions you may have.Key (subsequent times)Edgeworth:It's the Yatagarasu's Key... I wonder how it managed to return here?Gumshoe:So this key was stolen by Calisto Yew seven years ago, right?Edgeworth:Yes, although originally, it was stolen from this very building.Gumshoe:Well, then, maybe Ms. Yew just decided to bring it back.Edgeworth:I can't dismiss that possibility, however... (...it doesn't fit her modus operandi, given all of her other actions.)Body (after examining knife and key)Edgeworth:(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)Butterfly on wallGumshoe:Heeeey! It's another butterfly!Edgeworth:I believe it is the symbol of the Republic of Babahl (Buttlerfly of Babahl - National symbol that adorns the national flag. Allebahst's flower is its counterpart.). A drawing this big on the wall of an embassy... It definitely conveys a sense of overwhelming patriotism.Gumshoe:Well, I've got a lot of patriotism, too, sir! The reason I became a cop in the first place was because I wanted to protect our country!Edgeworth:You may want to, Detective, however, I have yet to see the fruits of your desire.Gumshoe:Y-You don't have to be so blunt about it, sir!Broken ceiling fanEdgeworth:This ceiling fan must've fallen from the ceiling.Gumshoe:A ceiling fan? What does one of those do?Edgeworth:Exactly what it sounds like it does; it's a fan that is installed on one's ceiling.Gumshoe:Well, if I had one of those in my room, I bet I'd go dizzy from staring at it as I slept.Edgeworth:Detective Gumshoe. In the real world, we close our eyes when we sleep.Golden statuePalaeno:Because this is a national treasure, can I ask that you please not touch it? I'm afraid the only ones allowed to touch it are myself and the secretariat.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:But there is a possibility that it is related to the murder, wouldn't you agree?Gumshoe:Hey, Mr. Edgeworth... Why don't we give up for now? We can force them to let us investigate it later when we find some solid proof!Edgeworth:...I suppose I don't have a choice here.

(This must be one of the Primidux Statues Kay was talking about earlier. ............ Is it just me or does this man look just like the Steel Samurai? They could be twins.)Knife rackGumshoe:Mr. Edgeworth! There's still something on this display rack, sir!Edgeworth:Knives, huh... Although, the blades are all that remain of them, unfortunately.Gumshoe:I guess the handles all got burnt off by the fire.Palaeno:Ah... So even the knives fell victim to the fire...Edgeworth:Ambassador Palaeno, are these knives yours?Palaeno:Why yes, they are. They are a special set of ornamental knives featuring the national symbol of Babahl. These butterfly-themed knives, along with Allebahst's own set of knives... ...are comprised of three knives each. But... But I can't believe the Babahlese ones have been reduced to this state...Edgeworth:Hmm... (Ornamental knives, huh? ...Hm? There's a small release on the tang of this blade.) Ambassador Palaeno, what is this notch here for...?Palaeno:Oh, that! It's a feature of these knives wherein you can freely exchange the handles on them. So that we can change how they look to fit the situation, of course.Edgeworth:I see. So these knives were constructed so that the handles could be easily removed.ShelvesEdgeworth:These shelves are lined with American souvenirs and memorabilia.Gumshoe:It's really strange isn't it? I mean, I thought this was the Babahlese Embassy! So, umm, why are there so many American souvenirs, sir?Edgeworth:Perhaps the Babahlese are studying American culture and our tourism industry...? If they have plans to make the Babahlese tourism industry truly flourish... ...then they would need to observe and study other countries' methods, I suppose.Gumshoe:Speaking of tourism, I got these from the blond guy earlier, sir. He said that if I bring these with me to Babahl, I can trade them in for a few buffets!Edgeworth:Oh? So, how do you expect to travel to Babahl?Gumshoe:Well, the whole world is connected by the oceans, sir! And for an all-you-can-eat buffet, I'd swim all the way to Babahl if I have to!Edgeworth:(Can a few simple coupons really motivate people to do such fantastic things?)Burnt objects by clockEdgeworth:There are still some burnt objects scattered on the floor.Gumshoe:Well, burnt things get burnt and then they become burnt things, you know?Edgeworth:No, because there is no way to prove that the burnt thing started out as a burnt thing.Gumshoe:Was it a burnt thing, or was it not? I have no idea what's what anymore, sir...Edgeworth:Yes, I suppose it's a bit hard for someone with a burnt-out light bulb to comprehend.Grandfather clockEdgeworth:It looks like this was once a magnificent grand father [sic] (changed from [grand grandfather] in the original release) clock, but it has fallen victim to the fire.Gumshoe:Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! Is it OK for me to talk about the clocks in my house, sir?Edgeworth:If they're unrelated to the case, I hope that you will refrain from sharing, but...Gumshoe:Well, there's this one clock that I made by myself, but the timer on it manages to auto...Edgeworth:That's quite enough, Detective.Examine evidenceKnifeBladeEdgeworth:So this is what took Mr. Coachen's life. Some of his blood is still on the blade.Gumshoe:Wow, I've been a detective for 7 years already? I've seen a lot of weapons in my days... ...but knives that were used to kill are always the hardest for me to bear.Edgeworth:Yes, unlike guns, this is one weapon where you're likely to find the victim's blood on it.Gumshoe:Yeah, just like how this one is practically drenched in it, huh, sir?Edgeworth:(Despite that, it looks like the blood managed to miss the handle somehow.)Ornate butterfly on handleEdgeworth:There is a lot of skilled detailing on this handle. I believe this is a butterfly.Gumshoe:This is one amazing ornamental knife. And I'm really glad that this beautiful butterfly wasn't ruined by blood.Edgeworth:There is not even a drop of blood on it. It really is quite exquisite. So much so that even you can understand its beauty, Detective.Gumshoe:Hey, why do you always have to look down on my tastes, sir!? I know what I like, and this is really well-crafted!Edgeworth:(Why do I look down on his tastes...? Because, my dear Detective, I'm afraid your tastes are usually quite questionable...)\u00a0! This knife... It would appear that the handle is removable.Gumshoe:I guess so people can change them whenever they feel like it. Sounds like fun, sir!Edgeworth:(I don't think people would remove the handle just for fun, Detective...)Yatagarasu's KeyKnife bladeEdgeworth:There is a vine motif to the ornamentation on this blade. Even if Detective Gumshoe claims to see a star motif in it. Between the blade and handle, there is a flower, and the key itself is a butterfly. This key was stolen by the Yatagarasu seven years ago from the Cohdopian Embassy... ...which suggests that this was made while Cohdopia still existed as a country.Button in handleEdgeworth:We discovered this trick seven years ago, and with it, we were able to corner Ms. Yew.

Is it possible that the \"dirty secret\" the Yatagarasu was out to steal is in this very room?Franziska:\"Dirty secret\"?Edgeworth:Franziska, you're in pursuit of some \"dirty\" underhanded dealings yourself, are you not? Something tells me that this is no coincidence.Franziska:In that case then, the person I'm looking for is here in the Babahlese Embassy, huh? The head of the smuggling operation!Edgeworth:(I think I just might need to ask Franziska about her smuggling case in more depth.)Connect \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\"Edgeworth:The design on the knife's handle... ...it greatly resembles the special Babahlese species of butterfly.Franziska:It does, doesn't it? Plus, it says right here.Edgeworth:\"This knife is property of the Republic of Babahl.\" Perhaps this means that the knife used in the crime was found right in this room...?PartnerGumshoe:Yes, sir?TalkThe murderEdgeworth:While you were on guard duty, did you notice anything unusual?Gumshoe:Well, I was on watch inside the Embassy... ...but unfortunately, I didn't run into the Yatagarasu, sir. But I did talk to an officer who was on duty near the border between the two Embassies... ...who told me that not a single person crossed the boundary during the incident.Edgeworth:I see.Gumshoe:The investigations into the fire and the Yatagarasu are a mess thanks to both events! I'm so confused, sir! Should I be putting the fire out or investigating!? What do you think, sir!?Edgeworth:...Aren't you old enough to solve your own problems yet, Detective?The investigationEdgeworth:I'd like an update on how the investigation is going.Gumshoe:Oh, yeah... Well... it's going, sir!Edgeworth:In other words... ...no one has any idea of what happened here, correct?Gumshoe:To put it simply... yeah, you got it, sir. But! We do know that something happened in this room, sir!Edgeworth:Any moron with a pair of eyes can see what happened, Detective.Gumshoe:Aww... W-Well, anyway! Let's investigate every single nook and cranny in this room, sir! We have to get serious, or Kay will end up getting arrested as the killer!Edgeworth:Yes, I am already well aware of that.Gumshoe:Oh...Edgeworth:(In order to find out what really happened here in this room... ...we will need to gather whatever information we can.

Not a clue, sir! I just can't figure it out...Edgeworth:Hmph... Detective Gumshoe. It's nothing to get so worked up over.Gumshoe:Oh! You mean I should use that thing, right!? Umm... Defunction? No, that's not it. Projection? No, no, that's not it either. I think it sounded like... Oh, I've got it! \"Lock it\"!Edgeworth:...It's \"logic\", Detective. Logic. (Now that I've collected some information, the next step... ...is to connect a few of them together to see if I can make sense of this mess!)PresentProsecutor's BadgeGumshoe:Hey, it's your Prosecutor's Badge! This thing's really important, right? So what would happen if you lost it, sir?Edgeworth:Why are you asking me such an ominous question?Gumshoe:Well, because I've lost my police badge before, sir! I just wanted to tell you to be careful, sir! Because writing the explanation section on those requisition forms is really annoying!Edgeworth:(I believe SOMEONE needs to listen to his own advice a bit more often...)Yatagarasu's KeyGumshoe:Hmm... So this is the Yatagarasu's Key, huh? That's a really nifty trick they built into it. I can't stop playing with it! This is great! It's like one of those transforming toys, sir!Edgeworth:E-Evidence is not meant to entertain, Detective!Anything elseEdgeworth:What do you notice about this piece of evidence, Detective?Gumshoe:Umm... Well, uh... I don't really sense anything special about it... But the embassy is a different story!Edgeworth:.........I see.Gumshoe:...I'm not really sensing anything special from you either, sir...Edgeworth:Well, I'm sensing a special look at your monthly salary, Detective!After connecting \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\" Logic:Edgeworth:We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy. Furthermore, we found it in the victim, Mr. Coachen's pocket. Which leads me to think that perhaps it is the key to the personal safe in this office.Gumshoe:Good thinking, sir! Let's go try it out!Edgeworth:...It appears I was correct. (The key that was left to us in the victim's pocket... It literally turned out to be the key to the next piece of the truth!) Hmm... What do we have here?Gumshoe:Hey! There's nothing inside!

(There must be some reason for this hole...)Gumshoe:Well, there's gotta be some reason why this hole's shaped so weirdly, you know!?Edgeworth:(Am I over thinking this? No, I don't think so...)Gumshoe:Hmm, maybe I'm over thinking things? Nah, there's no way I could ever do that, ho ho!Edgeworth:Detective Gumshoe, could you please be quiet for a second? You're frightening me.Inside of safeGumshoe:It looks like such a serious safe, but there's not a scrap of paper inside... Which reminds me, the safe in your office is just as empty, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!?Edgeworth:It's merely a coincidence that both safes are empty, Detective.Gumshoe:Well, make that a triple coincidence because my piggy bank at home is empty, too...Edgeworth:I don't think there's anything coincidental about that, Detective.Edgeworth:What is this here?Gumshoe:It looks like the ripped corner of a piece of paper, sir.Edgeworth:No, I don't think it's ripped; it seems more, to me, like it's stuck in the safe.Gumshoe:Hey, you're right! It won't budge an inch, not even when I tug on it! But I don't think I've ever seen paper stuck on the inside of a safe before...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Detective, I think you have it backwards.

However, there is nothing inside this safe... ...which points us to a clear contradiction of facts!Gumshoe:.........But remember when we checked out your safe that time, and you answered...Edgeworth:Right now?

Let's save it for another time when I have the proper time to explain it to you. (I suppose I should carefully examine everything one more time...)Leads to examination of safeExamine evidenceYatagarasu's KeyKnife bladeEdgeworth:This Yatagarasu's Key was originally made to open the safe... ....in Babahlese Embassy's secretariat's office. And whilst the blade looks like a simple knife at first glance... ...when viewed head-on, it's actually the same shape as the second keyhole in the safe. This key was stolen by the Yatagarasu seven years ago from the Cohdopian Embassy... ...which suggests that this was made while Cohdopia still existed as a country.PartnerNotice anything?Gumshoe:I can't believe there's a secret door inside the safe... Guess the stuff inside must be really, really important!Edgeworth:Yes, they appear to be quite important.Gumshoe:The little figures and stuff... I wonder how much those are worth?Edgeworth:Knowing that they are stolen merchandise, I would say they are probably priceless. Their value is probably worth more than what you could ever hope to make in your lifetime.Gumshoe:Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? You're kidding right, sir!? I-I mean, they're so small...Edgeworth:(Well, we're talking about purchasing it with YOUR salary, detective, so...)Gumshoe:Ok, then I guess those pieces of paper must be pretty valuable, too, right?Edgeworth:Yes, I assume so. I'm actually quite curious about them. (Even if they are not physically worth much, great care was taken to hide them. Which means they must be very important documents to someone. I wonder if the papers in the safe might be related to that other document...?)Edgeworth:Take a good look at these documents, Franziska.Franziska:It says that there are three pages in total, and yet, there are only two here.Edgeworth:Correct. Now take a look at the smuggling activity document in your possession. Tell me, is it not possible that your page was taken from this set of three?Franziska:Well, well... It certainly looks that way.Edgeworth:By putting our multi-part puzzle together, we seem to have arrived at an answer. And it seems that you have now found what you were looking for.Franziska:Yes, and with this, it has become crystal clear... ...that Mr. Coachen himself was responsible for the mass smuggling of Babahlese ink!Edgeworth:Babahlese ink?Franziska:Babahlese ink is a special product of the Republic of Babahl. However, due to a special reason, only a limited volume is ever exported.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:And that reason is...?Franziska:That's classified. It's on a need to know basis, and you don't need to know. In any case, it seems that the head of the smuggling ring was our victim, Mr. Manny Coachen.Edgeworth:His base was in an embassy, thus, it was hard for both our country and his to interfere. Making it the ideal conditions under which to run a smuggling operation.Franziska:Argh... but it's so frustrating. I lost the person I was to rain judgment down upon with my Whip of Justice.Edgeworth:Well, even if he is dead, we still have a responsibility to look into his misdeeds.Franziska:You expect me to whip a dead man? ...Well, I'm not interested.Edgeworth:Franziska... You must know... ...that Manny Coachen was the suspect in the KG-8 Incident...Franziska:Of course I know! On top of being the head of the smuggling ring... ...there is the matter of what really happened in that case that needs to be resolved.TalkColias PalaenoPresent Cohdopian Paper DocumentPalaeno:I can't believe that Babahlese ink was being used in such an evil scheme... And if people were to find out, that would really tarnish the global image of Babahl. Ah, this is really bad. Really, really bad. Ooh, Babahl's in a bind now... *sigh*Edgeworth:......... (Is it just me or do his words not match his facial expressions?)ExamineSafeEdgeworth:(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)PapersEdgeworth:The existence of this document in itself is quite important, isn't it?Franziska:Yes, it proves that Manny Coachen was the ringleader of the smuggling operation.Edgeworth:I suppose it does. (It really does look that way, however... ...I don't believe this shows us all that he was up to. And in order to find the truth behind his dealings, we'll need to continue investigating.)After connecting \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\" Logic, and examining golden statue and knife rack:Investigation CompleteShih-na:...Are you done investigating?Edgeworth:..................Shih-na:You realize now, don't you? That this girl is the only one it could be. Now come along quietly, Yatagarasu... Kay Faraday. You are under arrest for the murder of Manny Coachen.Kay:M...Mr. Edgeworth! Please, you have to believe me! I didn't do it! I chased the fake Yatagarasu in here... and he... he was already...Shih-na:You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:I'd like to help you reduce the number of mistaken arrests Interpol makes.Shih-na:...What is that supposed to mean?Edgeworth:I believe I told you that Kay Faraday is not the culprit of this crime.Shih-na:...Very well. I suppose I have no choice. I'll show you just how foolish your claims are!Testimony-- Why Arrest Kay? --Shih-na:Even your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight.Utilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy.Furthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu.And most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body.Edgeworth:Your reason for suspecting Kay is because you think she is the Yatagarasu?Shih-na:...Exactly. But it isn't just me. She calls herself the Yatagarasu.Kay:Argh! Look, how many times do I have to tell you!? I was only out to capture the fake Yatagarasu!Shih-na:Imposter or not... it matters not. A Yatagarasu is a Yatagarasu.Edgeworth:Very well. Then I shall prove that Kay is not the Yatagarasu who killed Mr. Manny Coachen!Shih-na:...Go ahead and try. Show me what the prosecutors of this country are made of.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: They may have confirmed it, but are you telling me that no one could catch the thief? If so, you're basically admitting that the Yatagarasu that committed murder eluded us! Shih-na: ......... Of course, I chased after the Yatagarasu that entered the Babahlese Embassy right away. And that is also why I'm making this arrest right now. Because at the end of my long chase... there was only this girl. Edgeworth: Nnnghoooh! Shih-na: In any case, this is what I believe happened tonight.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The confusion caused by the fire...? Are you saying... that the Yatagarasu was not the arsonist who started the fire? Shih-na: A suspicious person in a long coat was spotted in the area. Officers in the area claim to have seen that person start the fire. Edgeworth: Hmph... It sounds like we have a phantom in our midst. Gumshoe: Umm... Yeah... Edgeworth: (In a way... he could be considered a phantom, with the way he randomly appears.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because she calls herself that, it doesn't prove that she is a killer. Shih-na: No, but it does give her a motive. The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" Furthermore, there are documents pertaining to some smuggling activity in this room. She obviously wanted to steal them... ...so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Edgeworth: I see... (Her logic is very sound. I expected nothing less of Agent Lang's secretary. However, that statement just now didn't sound right. It might just be the opening I need.) Adds statement \"She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key.\"Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because she calls herself that, it doesn't prove that she is a killer. Shih-na: No, but it does give her a motive. The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" Furthermore, there are documents pertaining to some smuggling activity in this room. She obviously wanted to steal them... ...so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Edgeworth: I see... (Her logic is very sound. I expected nothing less of Agent Lang's secretary.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you're claiming that Kay knew that a foreign country's embassy had such documents? Shih-na: As stated in the calling card, the Yatagarasu was out to steal a \"dirty secret\"... ...which means that the goal tonight was to steal those smuggling activity documents. Kay: You have it all wrong! It was the fake that sent that card! Shih-na: ...Your words are meaningless. If you are truly innocent, then let's see some proof. Kay: Umm... Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I leave it to you to handle this! Edgeworth: Yes, I'd rather you did. (The Yatagarasu's goal, huh...) Shih-na: You can claim she's innocent, but you can't change the facts I've already outlined.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I really don't think that being the first to discover the body makes her the killer by default. Shih-na: No, but if you saw the self-purported Yatagarasu standing in front of a body... ...wouldn't you get a little suspicious yourself? Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Even so... I'd still listen to what that person had to say before I passed judgement! Franziska: Hah, are you talking about yourself and those times when you were under suspicion? Edgeworth: I think the pain of being falsely accused is something you really should experience. Gumshoe: I, personally, know that feeling really well, sir! Kay: And given my situation, I now know exactly what it's like, too! Franziska: I'm fine with never experiencing it, ever. Shih-na: ...Are you done with your little group conference?Edgeworth: (So Agent Shih-na suspects Kay of murder simply because Kay is the Yatagarasu. But if I can prove that the Yatagarasu's goal is not related to murder... ...then I may be able to begin to reason with her!)",

I saw her holding the knife she used on the victim with my own eyes.Edgeworth:Wh-What...!?Shih-na:...Allow me to tell you a bit more about the evidence that will put her away behind bars.Testimony-- Definitive Evidence --Shih-na:The knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife.The knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding.I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim.The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other.The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument.Edgeworth:Nnnnnrrrrrgh... Th-That is your definitive evidence...!?Shih-na:You see now that she is definitely the killer, right?Kay:No! Mr. Edgeworth, you've gotta believe me! I saw a suspicious person in a long black coat outside the Embassy, I swear!Edgeworth:And you came in here because you were chasing this suspicious person?Kay:That's right. I ran into this office only because I was chasing after that person... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the lights, but then...Kay:Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!???:...Who's there!?Shih-na:This is...Shih-na:I came to this room upon hearing the girl's scream. And when I saw her holding the knife, I immediately restrained her.Edgeworth:So the object Kay felt by her feet on the floor was the murder weapon...!?Shih-na:I had the knife analyzed right away, but we failed to find anyone's (changed from [anyone] in the original release, correcting the typo) prints on it.Kay:But the suspicious person in the black coat who came into this room before me...!Shih-na:Shih-na:You continue to insist there was such a person, but if there was, where did they go?Kay:That... I don't know. But I know they came in here!Shih-na:Shih-na:That sounds like the desperate excuses of a suspected killer, not a trustworthy testimony. You understand, don't you? We can't trust this girl's words, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:Gnnrk! (She has a point. Even if Kay's words are the truth... ...I must show that they are with some solid evidence!)Kay:Mr. Edgeworth... I really didn't...!Edgeworth:! Kay... Don't worry. If you didn't do it, then there must exist a way for me to prove that.Shih-na:Shih-na:Still not giving up, I see. In that case, try to counter my argument, if you can.Edgeworth:Don't worry, I can and I will!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Does this mean that you already have the results back? Shih-na: We have confirmed that the shape of the Babahlese knife's blade matches the wound. Please don't confuse the efficiency of Interpol's forensics teams with your own. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I won't if you don't underestimate our police force. And so we're clear, I'd hardly say your logic is sound, which you will see in a bit. Shih-na: If you can prove me wrong... please, by all means go ahead. Edgeworth: That has been my intention all along. Now, let us return to your testimony.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean to say that you saw Kay holding the murder weapon with your own eyes? Shih-na: I was also on the search for the Yatagarasu. When I heard that girl's scream coming from this room, I rushed over straight away. When I arrived, I saw that girl standing there motionless with the knife in her hands. Kay: But I already told you! I only came in here because I was also after the Yatagarasu! The suspicious person I saw came into this room! But when I entered, it was pitch dark. I felt something by my foot on the floor, so I turned on the lights, and then... Edgeworth: ...You found out that it was the murder weapon at your feet. Shih-na: How many times do I have to tell you? We can't trust the words of a suspect. Edgeworth: The only thing you'll accept is evidence, is it? Shih-na: That's the only acceptable way to counter an agent of Interpol on the scene of a crime. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... Do you have some kind of evidence that can prove me innocent...? Edgeworth: I think I do, because there is one piece of evidence I find to be a bit... interesting. (I think I need to carefully examine that piece of evidence again.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I ask that you please refrain from speculation! Shih-na: It's a sound hypothesis derived from the evidence. ...There's no room for debate. Edgeworth: Arngh! ???: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth, know that an ungraceful loss will not be tolerated, my subordinate. Now, rebut her hypothesis with factual logic. Otherwise, what was your investigation for? Edgeworth: Yes, you are correct. Thank you. Franziska: Heh... Helping a subordinate out with advice is the job of any good superior. Edgeworth: (She seems to be rather enjoying herself. But she is correct, none the less [sic].) Agent Shih-na, please continue with your testimony.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: About the three-piece set, is there really no other like it? Shih-na: Let's ask Ambassador Palaeno for more details, shall we? Palaeno: The knives are indeed special. They have the butterfly, the symbol of the Republic of Babahl, engraved on them. And because there are only three of them in the world, they are very, very valuable. Edgeworth: (The national symbol, huh? Well, the knives are covered in the butterfly design...) Palaeno: Along with the Allebahstian set, our respective countries only have three knives each. Edgeworth: I see... Shih-na: Are you satisfied now? If so, let's continue.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: No, I believe there is still room for debate, and I'll thank you to not decide that for me. Shih-na: I didn't decide anything for you. I'm merely looking at reality the way it is. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Are you sure you're not just viewing the facts through rose-colored glasses? Shih-na: ............ Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I think she's mad at you. Edgeworth: ...Perhaps. (But our definitions of reality are a tad different.) Shih-na: ...Are the two of you done chatting?Edgeworth: Agent Shih-na's proof is the Babahlese knife that Kay was allegedly holding.Gumshoe: Yeah... So, um, how are you going to prove that Kay didn't do it, sir?Edgeworth: If Agent Shih-na wants to suspect Kay merely because Kay was the only one here... ...then I must show with evidence that Kay couldn't have committed the murder!Gumshoe: Um, but do you have such evidence, sir?Edgeworth: Yes. There is one piece of evidence that seems very unnatural to me. ...And I believe it is my duty to point that out to Agent Shih-na.",

I felt something by my foot on the floor, so I turned on the lights, and then...Edgeworth:...You found out that it was the murder weapon at your feet.Shih-na:How many times do I have to tell you? We can't trust the words of a suspect.Edgeworth:The only thing you'll accept is evidence, is it?Shih-na:That's the only acceptable way to counter an agent of Interpol on the scene of a crime.Kay:Mr. Edgeworth... Do you have some kind of evidence that can prove me innocent...?Edgeworth:I think I do, because there is one piece of evidence I find to be a bit... interesting. (I think I need to carefully examine that piece of evidence again.)Present Babahlese KnifeEdgeworth:Leads to:\"So the murder weapon was the knife with the butterfly design on it.\"Shih-na:I assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:I ask that you please refrain from speculation!Shih-na:It's a sound hypothesis derived from the evidence. ...There's no room for debate.Edgeworth:Arngh!???:Franziska:Miles Edgeworth, know that an ungraceful loss will not be tolerated, my subordinate. Now, rebut her hypothesis with factual logic. Otherwise, what was your investigation for?Edgeworth:Yes, you are correct. Thank you.Franziska:Heh... Helping a subordinate out with advice is the job of any good superior.Edgeworth:(She seems to be rather enjoying herself. But she is correct, none the less [sic].) Agent Shih-na, please continue with your testimony.Shih-na:The knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:About the three-piece set, is there really no other like it?Shih-na:Let's ask Ambassador Palaeno for more details, shall we?Palaeno:The knives are indeed special. They have the butterfly, the symbol of the Republic of Babahl, engraved on them. And because there are only three of them in the world, they are very, very valuable.Edgeworth:(The national symbol, huh? Well, the knives are covered in the butterfly design...)Palaeno:Along with the Allebahstian set, our respective countries only have three knives each.Edgeworth:I see...Shih-na:Are you satisfied now? If so, let's continue.Shih-na:The evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:No, I believe there is still room for debate, and I'll thank you to not decide that for me.Shih-na:I didn't decide anything for you. I'm merely looking at reality the way it is.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Hmph. Are you sure you're not just viewing the facts through rose-colored glasses?Shih-na:............Kay:Mr. Edgeworth... I think she's mad at you.Edgeworth:...Perhaps. (But our definitions of reality are a tad different.)Shih-na:...Are the two of you done chatting?Edgeworth:Agent Shih-na's proof is the Babahlese knife that Kay was allegedly holding.Gumshoe:Yeah... So, um, how are you going to prove that Kay didn't do it, sir?Edgeworth:If Agent Shih-na wants to suspect Kay merely because Kay was the only one here... ...then I must show with evidence that Kay couldn't have committed the murder!Gumshoe:Um, but do you have such evidence, sir?Edgeworth:Yes. There is one piece of evidence that seems very unnatural to me. ...And I believe it is my duty to point that out to Agent Shih-na.Edgeworth:So the murder weapon was the knife with the butterfly design on it. But is that really the truth?Shih-na:What are you getting at?Edgeworth:I'd like for you to take a look at this. There is blood on the blade, and yet, there's not a speck of blood on the handle. This signifies that at the time of the crime, a different handle was attached to this blade. The knife that Kay was holding... ...had its handle switched, and was, in fact, not the real murder weapon!Shih-na:It wasn't... the real murder weapon!?Edgeworth:This knife can be taken apart. Shall we give it a go?Leads to examination of Babahlese knifeExamine ornate butterfly on handleLeads to:\"As you can see, the Babahlese knife has now been disassembled into two parts.\"Edgeworth:As you can see, the Babahlese knife has now been disassembled into two parts. The killer must have pulled the murder weapon out of the victim's body... ...and proceeded to swap the knife's original handle with this butterfly one. It was all to create the illusion that Mr. Coachen was killed with the butterfly-themed knife!Shih-na:Uurrnngh... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!Edgeworth:(This should clear up any and all suspicion surrounding Kay.)Babahlese Knife Handle data jotted down in my Organizer.Shih-na:Your argument isn't airtight yet!Examine evidenceBabahlese KnifeBladeEdgeworth:There is quite a bit of Mr. Coachen's blood on this blade. Thanks to being a prosecutor, I guess I have become accustomed to seeing blood...Flower engravingEdgeworth:It's an engraving of the national symbol of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...which is a flower. Though hidden by the handle, it shows that the knife was conceived in patriotism.Babahlese Knife HandleOrnate butterflyEdgeworth:A knife handle with a butterfly on it. I wonder where the blade that this should be attached to is...?Edgeworth:How so?Shih-na:It's possible... that the girl herself is the one who switched the handles.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Don't be ridiculous! For what purpose would she do such a thing!?Shih-na:I don't care to know how a criminal thinks. The way they view the world is beyond the comprehension of a normal person like myself. Therefore, I wouldn't put anything past them, no matter how odd it may seem.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:...Heh. The truth is right there in front of you, and this knife will show you the way! You will come to see that Kay is not and could not have been Mr. Coachen's killer!Leads to examination of Babahlese knifeExamine flower engravingLeads to:\"What is this mark on here?\"Examine bladeEdgeworth:There is quite a bit of Mr. Coachen's blood on this blade. Thanks to being a prosecutor, I guess I have become accustomed to seeing blood... But this is not what is important right now!Shih-na:What is this mark on here?Edgeworth:It's the mark of a flower. I assume you know what this means?Shih-na:No, not really. Butterflies rest on flowers all the time to drink their sweet nectar.Edgeworth:...And so they do. (However, would this butterfly really drink the nectar of this flower? The answer is clearly... not a chance! Now to prove the relationship between the butterfly and the flower with this!)Present Embassy GuideEdgeworth:Leads to:\"! Y-You can't be serious...!\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:This piece of evidence will make everything clear to you!Shih-na:I can't quite figure out what you're trying to prove with that.Edgeworth:I! That is...Franziska:If you are that uncertain, then I demand you try again!Edgeworth:Nngh... Yes, that's exactly what I was about to do. (It would appear that this piece of evidence was not sufficient enough. I should think this over once again, calmly and rationally... The flower mark engraved into the blade... and the butterfly on the handle... There must be something that can put these two symbols into the correct context for us!)Leads back to:\"Now to prove the relationship between the butterfly and the flower with this!\"Shih-na:! Y-You can't be serious...!Edgeworth:Hmph... It appears that you've made the connection. The flower on this blade is designed after a certain country's national symbol. That's right... The Kingdom of Allebahst. In other words... This blade is from one of Allebahst's ornamental knives!Shih-na:Aah!Edgeworth:This part of the knife handle... ...has Babahl's national symbol of the butterfly on it. Therefore, it is undeniably Babahlese in origin! But as we both know, you can't kill someone with just a knife handle. Incidentally, when exactly did the murder occur again, Agent Shih-na?Shih-na:Ack! After the fire had broken out...Edgeworth:That's right. Kay entered the Babahlese Embassy after the fire had taken place. Furthermore, she had not been to the Allebahstian side of the building before then. On top of that, not a single person passed between the two countries during the fire... ...which means that Kay could not have transported an Allebahstian object over here! This makes it impossible for her to be the true killer!Shih-na:..................!Gumshoe:Whooooop! Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! What a great victory!Edgeworth:..................Franziska:..................Shih-na:..................Gumshoe:Huh? Hey, why is everyone so quiet...?Edgeworth:(I'm happy we got this far and cleared Kay's name... ...but what worries me now is what will happen next.)Franziska:Franziska:What is the meaning of this!? An Allebahstian knife, here...!?Edgeworth:Do you mean... how did this find its way to the Republic of Babahl? It didn't just find its way over. Rather, we should focus on how it was smuggled over!Kay:You know what!? My brain hurts thinking about it while we're just standing around! Thinking while you're on the run? Now THAT'S the way a real Great Thief operates!Edgeworth:Kay...?Kay:Oh, thanks a bunch, Mr. Edgeworth! For proving me innocent, I mean! You believed in me the whole time, right? Tell me you did!Edgeworth:Umm, not really, but...Kay:Ha ha. Come on, you don't have to be shy about it!Shih-na:Shih-na:...Your argument is still not airtight.Edgeworth:Would you care to elaborate?Shih-na:I understand now that the girl didn't commit the murder. However, there is still the possibility that she is the Yatagarasu.Kay:That again!? Look, how many times do I have to explain it to you!? I am the real Yatagarasu! I'm not like that fake one that goes around setting fires, OK!?Shih-na:Whether you're the real deal or a fake, it doesn't really matter. All I have to say is this: I have my suspicions that this girl is the one who started the fire.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Preposterous! On what grounds do you suspect her of such a thing!?Shih-na:The fact that she calls herself the Yatagarasu. That in itself is the (changed from [a] in the original release) most elegant proof.Kay:Ms. Shih-na.Shih-na:Yes?Kay:I... have no intention of taking back any of what I've said.Shih-na:...?Kay:I am the Great Thief Yatagarasu. And I refuse to allow some imposter to claim that name as their own! The path of justice that my father pointed me towards... I will walk it the best I can!Shih-na:It's not good to be so stubborn. I hope you can understand that.Kay:Thanks a lot for the concern, Ms. Shih-na! Let me share something with you, too, as a token of my appreciation! Those sunglasses totally do nothing for you, so I'll steal them from you next time, OK!?Shih-na:Wh--!?Kay:Well, I guess we'd better get going!Franziska:Going...? To where?Kay:To the Kingdom of Allebahst! If we don't go, we won't know for sure, right?Franziska:I suppose not... We won't get anywhere simply by standing here thinking. To see where the Allebahstian knife came from... ...we'll have to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. Let's go, Miles Edgeworth. As you are my subordinate... I will not tolerate you bringing the investigation to a halt.Edgeworth:Hmph... Understood.To be continuedMarch 14, 7:44 PMTheatrum Neutralis - LobbyMIB:Count off!1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! 1! ...1! 1!MIB:Shifu! 99 callouts!

Dismissed!Sir!Lang:Yo, were you guys there the whole time? I got a call from Shih-na, and she's already filled me in. It sounds like you're out to get in my way again.Edgeworth:I have absolutely no intention of interrupting your investigation. I simply request that you grant me permission to investigate the Allebahstian Embassy.Lang:Hmph. And what if I say no?Franziska:Franziska:Agent Lang! This man is my subordinate. As I have received permission from the ambassador, he is to be extended the same rights.Lang:Sorry, sis, but it's not that simple. Allebahst has the strictest immigration regulations in the world, or didn't you know? Even among my elite men, about only half of them were admitted into the country. Besides, any more cooks in the kitchen, and we might spoil the soup, if you get what I mean.Franziska:How dare you make such assumptions!?Lang:Don't take this the wrong way, but I thought I was in charge of Allebahst, Ms. von Karma.Franziska:Grrr!Lang:Look, try to understand, OK? Things over in Allebahst are a bit of a mess right now.Edgeworth:What do you mean by \"a bit of a mess\"?Lang:No one told you? We had an \"incident\" in Allebahst as well. This is what we call a decision based on the investigation, Mr. Prosecutor.Kay:Look, Wolfy! Just let us in already!???:???:Is there a problem here, Agent Lang?Lang:Not really. Just having a \"discussion\" about whether or not to let these guys in.Franziska:Ambassador Alba, I ask that you please allow these people to join the investigation.Alba:Having a debate because of my country... I'm terribly sorry for placing you good people in that kind of situation... It is all because I lacked the strength to govern well.Edgeworth:Please, it is nothing of the sort, Ambassador...Alba:You weakling, Quercus! Curse your frailty and inability to affect change in your country!Edgeworth:Wh-What are you--!?Alba:The thing is, investigations conducted in my country have been under Agent Lang. And it is my judgment that in order to minimize disruption in the investigation... ...I should leave everything up to Agent Lang.Lang:...There, you see?Kay:Oh, no way!???:Palaeno:Ambassador Alba, I ask you to please reconsider letting them into Allebahst.Alba:What's that...?Palaeno:My very own secretary has been murdered in the Babahlese Embassy. And he was apparently caught up in some very shady dealings completely unbeknownst to me. So I ask for your cooperation in our investigation. These aren't much, but I hope they can cover your travel expenses to Babahl someday.Lang:Alright, alright. I get it. Even if you beg Ambassador Alba, I still have to give the final OK anyway.Kay:Alright! You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? We're in!Lang:Not so fast, my little crow-girl. You're still a witness in the Babahl murder. So I'd like you to please stay in the Republic of Babahl.Edgeworth:Detective Gumshoe. Please take good care of Kay for me.Gumshoe:Yes, sir!Lang:Sounds good to me. The fewer troublemakers, the better.Kay:......... *rasp!*Gumshoe:*rasp!*Kay:Hey, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:Yes?Kay:So I wanted to ask for a while now, but... ...that lady over there, is she who I think she is!?Edgeworth:Ah, that's right. I didn't introduce the two of you yet.Franziska:Franziska von Karma, the prosecutorial prodigy. ...It's nice to see you again.Kay:Ooh, I knew it! You're the whip lady!Franziska:.........You may address me as Ms. von Karma.Kay:Ms. von Karma, I leave the investigation of Allebahst in your hands!Franziska:Thanks. Rest assured, I will outsmart both the smuggling ring and the Yatagarasu!Edgeworth:(The smuggling ring, huh... Perhaps I should ask Franziska a bit more about them before I head into Allebahst. Ah, and I mustn't forget to thank Ambassador Palaeno for all that he has done for me.)TalkFranziska von KarmaEdgeworth:You've made so much progress in your investigation in such a short period of time.

As your subordinate, I'm a part of your investigation now. Don't you think it would be beneficial if I was [sic] as well-informed as you?Franziska:.........Point taken. Very well, I'll fill you in. Recently. we discovered some very well-made counterfeit bills circulating in Zheng Fa.Edgeworth:Counterfeit bills?Franziska:Yes... As you may have deduced... ...the counterfeits are being made with Babahl's special Babahlese ink. And it's virtually impossible to distinguish bills made with Babahlese ink from real ones. Thus, it was only natural for Interpol to keep an eye on the Republic of Babahl.Edgeworth:That's where this document comes into play, correct?Franziska:Correct. Mr. Coachen was smuggling large amounts of Babahlese ink. Furthermore, he was charged with running the Embassy's printing equipment. That's all the evidence I need to know that he was the head of the smuggling ring. However, there remains one tiny problem.Edgeworth:Let me guess. You still have yet to find the counterfeit bills or the smuggled ink?Franziska:Yes, and while we're listing things, I might as well add the counterfeit plates to the pile. Since we haven't been able to locate any of these items in the Babahlese Embassy... ...we're looking into the Allebahstian Embassy next.

Oh, and I hope the brush-clearing goes smoothly.ExamineFlag by left doorEdgeworth:The national flag of the Kingdom of Allebahst is on display here. The crest on it features a flower. The knife with the flower design on it that we found in the Babahlese Embassy... It would appear that it is definitely connected to the Kingdom of Allebahst.Window by left doorEdgeworth:(I can see the courtyard and the Allebahstian Embassy through this window. But this side is under the same dire straits as the Babahlese side. An incident has occurred on both sides of this one building. Why must fate make everything in my life so full of complexities?)Flowers on left sideEdgeworth:These flowers are a gift from the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. It appears that their business has boomed since they became a Steel Samurai sponsor.PamphletsEdgeworth:There are stacks of pamphlets about the two embassies here.Palaeno:Oh, Mr. Edgeworth. Please take as many as you would like! You'll find that you can cut out the last page and use it as a coupon.Edgeworth:I'm afraid I must decline, as I have little interest in them.Palaeno:Wait, I thought Americans loved coupons? That man in the green coat earlier was beyond ecstatic when I gave him some.Edgeworth:Ambassador Palaeno, I ask that you please not think of him as representative of all Americans.Center doorEdgeworth:The Steel Samurai and Jammin' Ninja stage shows were held just beyond these doors. After the Jammin' Ninja's show ended, we came out here, and were greeted with a fire... ...then the appearance of the Yatagarasu, and a murder; we're far from solving anything yet.TVEdgeworth:There is a flat-panel, a VCR, and a row of Steel Samurai videos on this table. There might be a clue among these... I had better check the titles of these videos. My my, the things I put myself through for the sake of the investigation.Flowers on right sideEdgeworth:These flowers are a gift from Global Studios. They seem to be prospering quite a bit, thanks to their constant stream of hit shows.Window by right doorEdgeworth:(The Babahlese Embassy is just outside this window. The burn marks on it look pretty bad. It's a shame that they were in the middle of renovations. The fire did little to help there. And behind me, Ambassador Palaeno's dry smile hides the tears in his eyes...)Flag by right doorEdgeworth:The national flag of the Republic of Babahl is on display here. The crest on it features a butterfly. The Babahlese Embassy, which sits to the right of the theater... ...and the Allebahstian Embassy which sits to the left... Something has happened in each of the two embassies. I sense that unconventional methods will be required to solve both of these mysteries.After talking with Franziska von Karma and Colias Palaeno:Edgeworth:Well, shall we get going????:Edgeworth:What's wrong, Kay?Kay:I didn't get permission to enter Allebahst... ...so we're going to go gather whatever info we can over on the Babahlese side, OK!?Edgeworth:Alright, I'm counting on you two.Kay:Right, and I'm counting on you and Ms. von Karma to sniff out clues in Allebahst!

Your best bud is in a bind, and you act like it's no big deal!Edgeworth:What sort of \"bind\" are we talking about here...?Larry:The suspect kind! I accidentally became a suspect in a murdeeeeeer!Edgeworth:I see. That is quite the bind.Franziska:...Not that we're in the least bit surprised.Edgeworth:Yes, I pretty much expected this news... ...from the instant I saw this unlucky face. (His name is Larry Butz. I've known him since grade school, and for as long as I've known him... ...he has been the world's largest source of Trouble with a capital T.)Larry:Hey! What kind of introduction is that!? You're so mean, Edgey! If you're not careful, you might find your tiny number of friends go down by one!Edgeworth:That was uncalled for. Besides, you're............ Wait, hold on. Laaaaaaryyyy! It was you!? YOU'RE the one who wrote my Steel Samurai autograph!?Larry:Hm? Oh, you didn't notice earlier? I even winked at you through my headpiece.Franziska:.........What's going on? And why are you beet-red?Edgeworth:Sorry... but could you not speak to me right now...????:Lang:Oh, sorry, am I interrupting your comical, yet melodramatic play?Edgeworth:! .........Aha. So this is the incident you mentioned earlier.Lang:Mr. Prosecutor, this man... this childhood friend of yours... is our prime suspect. Of what, you ask? Of the murder of a man who had snuck into this embassy, Mask\u2606DeMasque II!Edgeworth:Mask\u2606DeMasque II...? .................. (Only Larry could get himself into yet another mess as fine as this. But no matter what the facts seem to say, Larry is not the type to commit murder. Still, it's a rather daunting stroke of misfortune I've struck. I have to prove... that Larry Butz is innocent of all wrongdoing!)MIB:Shifu! We've identified the victim!Lang:Good work. I'll take that report now.Edgeworth:Agent Lang, would you mind if I took a peek at it as well?Lang:What did I tell you earlier, Mr. Prosecutor? Don't get in my way! There's only enough flesh here to feed one wolf, and that one is me! So, no, you may not take a \"peek\".Edgeworth:But Agent Lang...!???:Badd:...Agent Lang. Will you... allow an investigator such as myself... to take a look?Lang:Ah, yes. Of course. ...You, let the detective see the file.Edgeworth:You're... Detective Badd!Badd:You're... the prosecutor, Mr. Edgeworth, right?Edgeworth:Fancy meeting you here, Detective.Badd:You weren't expecting me...? Ever since that day seven years ago... I've chased after the Yatagarasu... non-stop. I even pressured Interpol... into keeping me in the loop... in case a card was ever found.Edgeworth:(What incredible dedication to the case.)Lang:Detective Badd knows the Yatagarasu's M. O. very well. And his passion for the chase hasn't died down in these seven long years. It's something... I can respect. But, Detective Badd, I must ask: are you going to make an ally out of this prosecutor?Badd:My only goal is to arrest the Yatagarasu. If he can get to the bottom of this case, then I'm willing to share info with him.Edgeworth:I am in your debt, Detective Badd.TalkInitial investigationEdgeworth:About the murder of DeMasque II... Would you be willing to fill me in on a few of the details?Badd:When the Yatagarasu showed up... Agent Lang and I took ourselves off guard duty... ...and put ourselves in charge of directing things... at this crime scene. Taking advantage of the chaos... ...DeMasque II... he broke into this embassy... Probably... to steal some treasure or another...Edgeworth:And I suppose he lost his life when he was forced to fight someone else in this room?Suspect (appears after \"Initial investigation\")Edgeworth:Why exactly was that man placed under arrest, Detective?Badd:That... samurai?Edgeworth:He was born looking suspicious, but not for the reasons you suspect, I assure you. As you can plainly see, he is completely harmless.Badd:Well, it was just a random guess... It's not like he's actually under arrest... Tonight... here, at the Allebahstian Embassy... ...Ambassador Alba... was to give a commemorative speech... And that's when... the Yatagarasu showed. But keep in mind... the Yatagarasu isn't who I'm talking about right now... Those seats... for the guests who had been called to sit in them... were empty.Edgeworth:A no-show...? Who was it that failed to take their seat?Badd:The Steel Samurai. Until the speech was to begin, each member of the entire Steel Samurai family... ...was to wait in a separate room, However, for some weird reason... ...that man... was spotted in a different location than his assigned room... at that time.Edgeworth:And where was he?Badd:He was on the roof... with one of his legs down a chimney... ...That chimney... leads directly into this room...Edgeworth:Nnrrrgh...! (Larry Butz...! You've really outdone yourself this time! What were you thinking!?)PresentNotes on Coachen's Body or Cohdopian Paper DocumentEdgeworth:I wonder if you might take a look at this, Detective Badd?Badd:Yeah... I heard. Coachen's dead... ...What a waste. ............Edgeworth:(He's staring at his mirror with his eyes unfocused and his jaw clenched tight...)Yatagarasu's KeyEdgeworth:Detective Badd, this is something you absolutely need to see.Badd:! What... is that doing here? I've been looking for that... for seven long years. Never in my wildest dreams... did I imagine... this turn of events. Without a doubt... this means that \"she\"... is involved. That Yew woman!Counterfeit Bills or Babahlese InkEdgeworth:Detective Badd, if you could please take a look at this for me?Badd:...I see. The truth... that lies beyond this piece of evidence... is not going to be fun. Are you ready to take it on?Edgeworth:Of course I am!Badd:I don't know how close to the truth you are... ...but there are only a few things... I can say. So listen up, and listen well... Don't ever lose your detective's spirit.Edgeworth:(That would be a good piece of advice... if I was [sic] a detective.)Anything elseEdgeworth:Detective Badd, I'm wondering if you might be able to tell me something about this?Badd:...Sorry, but I don't give a hoot about things that aren't related to the Yatagarasu...Franziska:Heh... It looks like nothing about you has changed in these seven years, huh?Badd:Hmph... Daughter of Von Karma, you're still just a sapling of a prosecutor, so..Franziska:Arngh! I-I'll have you know that I've already grown into a stately tree of a prosecutor!Badd:...Heh... Is that right...?Edgeworth:(Is he just toying with Franziska...? He seems to be enjoying this quite a bit.)After clearing all Talk options:Edgeworth:In any case, I believe it's high time for me to start my investigation.Begin InvestigationAllebahstian Embassy - Ambassador's OfficeTalkLarry ButzEdgeworth:Larry, there are a few things I need to ask you about.Larry:Hey, how about that!? I've got a few things I've gotta ask you, too!Edgeworth:......... What is it?Larry:It's like... both you and him... How is it that the two of you always manage to have some cute or hot girl by your side!? And Franzy! What about that promise you made to me!?Franziska:Promise...? What promise...?Larry:The one where you said you would model for my next book, \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip\"! Yeeoowww!Franziska:I made no such promise!Edgeworth:(Ever since grade school, we've had a certain saying about Larry. \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" One needs to look no further than this man to find the King of Troublemakers!)TalkSteel SamuraiEdgeworth:As I recall, aren't you calling yourself Laurice Dounim now?Larry:That's \"Deauxnim\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Get that straight in your head, Edgey! Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!Franziska:Now I remember... You're that rude, pale imitation of a real artist.Larry:No, no, no! You've got it all wrong. I gave up on that whole Laurice business! Besides, when Banjolina left me and my heart in pieces... ...that's when Mindy walked into my life. She's been so good to me that I wanted to help her in some way... ...and I figured I could through this Steel Samurai outfit!Franziska:Your inane blathering makes less and less sense each time we meet.Edgeworth:I believe he's saying that he picked up this part-time job as the Steel Samurai so that... ...he may attempt to capture the heart of the actress who plays the Pink Princess.Larry:You got it! I knew you'd know what I meant, Edgey!Edgeworth:(Not really. It's not so much as I understood... ...but a simple deduction based on your usual modus operandi, Larry.)Time of the murderEdgeworth:Larry, I'd like you to confess right now... to everything you did tonight.Larry:C-C-Confess!? Hey! Don't tell me you suspect me, too!Edgeworth:Nonsense. I don't believe you have the mental acuity needed to plan and execute a murder. However, we are talking about you here, so I find it hard to believe that nothing happened. For past experience has taught me that you are always at the center of some insane event!Larry:E-E-Edgey! How can you be so mean, stabbing me with your words like that!?Edgeworth:Unfortunately, I don't have the time to search out a key to unlock your heart this time. So I suggest that you cooperate and tell me what you know.Larry:OK, OK! I get it! Just stop Franzy from whipping me from behind! So... I guess you know what I did, right, Edgey?Edgeworth:...I can't even begin to imagine. However... ...I imagine that whatever you were up to was probably beyond my imagination. So you will tell me what exactly you did, Larry!Larry:Nope, not yet, Edgey! It'll take more than that to loosen my lips! A lot moooooooooooore!Franziska:Confess. Now.Larry:Ooooghnnn... OK, well, I was up on the roof.Edgeworth:And why exactly were you up there?Larry:Oh, you know, that wintry custom and the legendary hero!Franziska:Legendary...?Edgeworth:Hero...?Larry:Santa Claus!Franziska:Santa...Edgeworth:Claus...Larry:I wanted to do that thing he does, so I climbed up to one of the chimneys! But when I got there, there was smoke pouring out of the chimney (Smoke from chimney - Smoke was pouring out of the chimney when Larry thought to climb down it.).Edgeworth:...And?Larry:Well, I couldn't go down the chimney with smoke coming up, right? So, I gave up.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Larry, you do realize that Santa Claus does not exist, right?Larry:Of course I know! I did graduate from junior high, you know?Edgeworth:Then you should also understand this: If Santa was [sic] real... he would be the biggest unlawful trespasser in history!Larry:Aw, cruuuuuuuuuuud!Edgeworth:It is your attempt to imitate Santa that has landed you as prime suspect in this murder!Larry:Come on, man. What's so wrong with pretending to be Santa...?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Let's start with the fact that it will be the ides of March in a matter of hours. Santa only visits homes on December 24th! That's in December, you nitwit!Larry:Nooooooooooooooooooooooo! Hey, wait a sec! We're not in court!Murder weapon (appears after examining sword by body)Edgeworth:Larry, about the Samurai Sword that was used as the murder weapon...Larry:Oh, that. Well, I shook hands with the ambassador in this room, you know.Edgeworth:Yes.. apparently you did.Larry:And, well, I totally forgot about it and left it behind when I left afterwards! You wanna talk about shock, I was the most shocked of all when I heard it killed someone! Shooooooooooocked!Franziska:Foolish fool looking especially foolish for foolishly stating such a foolish excuse... You forgot to take something that big with you!? Who would believe such a tale!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:...Sorry, Ms. von Karma, but I believe him. Because if anyone could forget something like that, it would be Larry.Larry:Edgeyyyy... You believe meeeee...! I just knew that our friendship is something special!Edgeworth:(Anyway... even if Larry had simply forgotten the sword and left it behind... ...that, in no way, clears his name. Which means that I will have to prove his innocence from a different angle.)PresentSteel Samurai's Autograph or Photo with Steel SamuraiLarry:Oh, hey, it's the Steel Samurai.Edgeworth:I want you to answer this question for me, Larry, and depending on the answer, I may let you live. The Steel Samurai that was up there on that stage... Was that really you?Larry:Yup, sure was!Edgeworth:L-Laaaarrrrryyyyyyyyy! Yooooooooooou...!!Larry:Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!Edgeworth:! (I was moved by the performance of this man!? This completely useless, worthless bum!? I fear I may never recover from this...)Samurai Spear or Samurai SwordLarry:Hey! That's an official Steel Samurai weapon! Huh? What? You want me to do it? Oh, you have no idea how many fans ask that of me!Edgeworth:? What are you prattling on about now?Larry:Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!Edgeworth:!Larry:How was that? I bet it sent shivers up your spine!Edgeworth:......... (Ack! I let myself get caught up in being a spectator! How could I have failed myself!?)Anything elseEdgeworth:Larry, I wonder if you might know what this is?Larry:Nope, not a clue!Edgeworth:You didn't even look at it!Larry:Nah, that's because the only thing I can see right now is the form of my lovely Franzy!Franziska:Oh? In that case, allow me to help you sear my form into you for all eternity!Larry:Eek! Aaaah! Whippity-Whip Triiiiip!Edgeworth:Now THIS is a trip I'm willing to endorse, especially if we can finally get some peace here.Shi-Long LangLang:You did some investigating over in the Babahlese Embassy, too, right?Edgeworth:I did. Is there a problem?Lang:Lang Zi says: \"A wolf who aims to hunt for two rabbits at once...\"Edgeworth:I believe the idiom you require is, \"He who runs after two hares will catch neither.\"Lang:Heh. A REAL wolf can catch both.Edgeworth:I see. So what are you trying to say, seeing as how I am currently handling two cases?Lang:Heh... Suit yourself. But don't say I didn't warn you.MIBMIB:No matter how hard you try, you'll never be a necessity in our Shifu's investigation!Edgeworth:Is that a fact? But no matter how good he is, he is bound to overlook something.MIB:! If you insult our Shifu, then prepare to be punished!Franziska:Oh? And how exactly would you punish us?MIB:Every investigator under Shifu's command will work to disrupt your investigation!Edgeworth:(...Vindictive much?)Tyrell BaddPresent DeMasque II's NoteBadd:So... he clutched this note... as he went about his business... ...He was a poor excuse for a criminal... On top of which... he was only following in someone else's footsteps... What a small fry. I've been a detective for a long time. I can see straight through these people.Edgeworth:(He really has a different air about him. Now if only Gumshoe could understand that and be more like Detective Badd...)ExaminePlants in lower left cornerFranziska:There are decorative plants here as well... This room is overflowing with nature.Edgeworth:Humans used to live in the grandeur of nature once, long ago. I believe I'm not mistaken in thinking that those people truly loved nature.Franziska:...Hmph. This is coming from a man who loves shows featuring costumed actors.Edgeworth:(Arngh! She just had to go there again, didn't she?)Grandfather clockEdgeworth:There was a grandfather clock just like this one earlier in the Babahlese Embassy. You know, symmetry is a fine thing, but their interior design really suffers for it.Franziska:Really? I think this clock actually fits the d\u00e9cor of this room quite well.Edgeworth:I suppose the wood does suit the all-natural atmosphere of this room.Franziska:Its design and the material it's made of strikes a good balance with the plants.Larry:Hey! You two! Now's not the time to be talking about interior decorating, you know! Hurry up and save me!Franziska:Be quiet!Larry:Ack!Franziska:This is all a part of my elite investigation. All you need to do is be quiet and watch.Edgeworth:(Actually, I do believe Larry has a point for once.)Plants by knife rackFranziska:What is that plant supposed to be?Edgeworth:Franziska, can't you see that it's supposed to be a likeness of Ambassador Alba?Franziska:Miles Edgeworth! As a subordinate, you have a lot of nerve telling me what to think! ...I look forward to your salary assessment next month.Edgeworth:(You are deluding yourself if you think you have any control over that!)Knife rack areaEdgeworth:There are some weapons on display on this wall. A crossbow... and under that... ...a set of knives bearing a flower motif. They must be the counterparts to the Babahlese knives. Which means that the blades inside these scabbards... ...should match the blade that was used to kill Mr. Coachen. (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)ExaminePlantsFranziska:What is that plant supposed to be?Edgeworth:Franziska, can't you see that it's supposed to be a likeness of Ambassador Alba?Franziska:Miles Edgeworth! As a subordinate, you have a lot of nerve telling me what to think! ...I look forward to your salary assessment next month.Edgeworth:(You are deluding yourself if you think you have any control over that!)SpearEdgeworth:It's the Steel Samurai's primary weapon, the Samurai Spear.Larry:Isn't it awesome!? I totally fell for this thing! It's sleek and shiny, just like my heart! It comes at you like, whoosh! When you hold it, you just wanna live life like, BAM!Edgeworth:You'd do well to watch what you say, Larry. (Although, it is just as Larry says. The spear is quite the symbol of valor. However, speaking of spears... ...aren't you supposed to use them by thrusting the point straight into your opponent...? ...I'm not entirely convinced this spear is up to the task.)Larry:What's wrong, Edgey? You're just staring off into the distance! Oh! I get it! Tell you what. I'll tell the studio to make you one, OK? But this one's mine!Edgeworth:Did I say anything about wanting one!? (Maybe I can shut him up if I show him the piece of evidence... ...that will point something out about this spear.)CrossbowEdgeworth:(Why is there a weapon on display in a place like this?)Franziska:I wonder why there are no whips on display here?Knife rackEdgeworth:Knives adorned with flowers are on display here. I suspect that these are the counterparts to the Babahlese knives. The blades of these knives should match the blade of the knife that killed Mr. Coachen. Wh--!? One of the knives is missing its blade. Let's see if the two pieces, the blade and handle, fit each other.Franziska:It would appear that they fit together quite well, almost seamlessly.Edgeworth:Then this means that an Allebahstian knife did find its way into Babahl! But how...?Knife rack (subsequent times)Edgeworth:The knife display is set up almost identically to the one in the Babahlese Embassy.Franziska:I believe Ambassador Palaeno said that both Allebahst and Babahl... ...have a set of three knives each.Edgeworth:It would appear that way. Also, the knives here all have flowers on their handles.Franziska:The two countries embellished their knives with their own national symbols, I guess. And just like the Yatagarasu's Key, they are exquisitely made. This level of craftsmanship makes these knives worthy of being owned by me.Edgeworth:(I believe you already have all the dangerous toys you will ever need, Franziska.)StatueEdgeworth:I can spot absolutely no difference between this Primidux Statue and Babahl's.Franziska:The statue's face looks a bit like that costumed hero you like so very much. I only wonder why you Americans have such an affinity for this kind of face?Edgeworth:(The statue wasn't made by an American, you know. At least, I don't suppose so.)Deduce spearEdgeworth:(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)Present Steel Samurai's AutographEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Larry, about this spear...\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:The contradiction of this here is related to this piece of evidence!Franziska:...I don't see how they're related in any way.Edgeworth:Gnnrgh! .............................. Hmph... Franziska. This is not like you at all. Don't tell me that you don't understand the meaning behind this piece of evidence?Franziska:Well, I don't.Edgeworth:I suppose I have no choice then. I'll just have to explain it to you from the beginning.Franziska:What you should be doing from the very beginning is admitting your mistake!Edgeworth:Gnwaaaah! (Sh-She saw right through me...)Leads to examination of knife rack areaEdgeworth:Larry, about this spear...Larry:Oh! Are you feeling it? BAM!Edgeworth:I thought there was something strange about this spear... Tell me, Larry. Is it just me or is the spear a bit bent?Larry:Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What!? No way! It's exactly as it should be, yo!Edgeworth:I have here the autograph you wrote for me earlier. Now, take a good look at this which you drew with your own hands. You can see that the spear is clearly of a different shape!Larry:A...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!Edgeworth:What do you have to say to that!?Larry:I-I'm soooooooorry! When I hold the spear in my hands, all of a sudden I feel super powerful... And then, during practice, I was spinning it around and around... ...and BAM! It hit the waaaaaaaaaall!Franziska:Franziska:You unbelievable--! This is an EMBASSY!Larry:But I've always been like that... ever since I was a kid. One time on an overnight field trip, I bought a fake sword and played with it late that night. I'm just a useless, hot-blooded maaaaaaaaaaan!Edgeworth:Larry, clarify that for me, will you?Larry:OK, so it was some field trip, and I began to shadow-fight with myself...Edgeworth:Not that! I meant what you said earlier, about spinning the spear and hitting the wall!Larry:Oh, that! It's no biggie. It's not like I left a hole or anything!Edgeworth:That's not why I'm asking, Larry. The Samurai Spear is made of metal. I somehow doubt that a move as simple as spinning it around would cause it to bend.Larry:Man, Edgey, you're so na\u00efve!Edgeworth:Wh-What!? Where did that come from!?Larry:Well, you keep calling it the Samurai Spear. But it's not real. You can't really fight someone with it... ...because it's hollow on the inside! You could hit it against practically anything and it would bend.Edgeworth:I-Is that so...?Larry:Don't tell me you thought it was real? Oh, but don't take it the wrong way. I just think that part of your personality is cute.Franziska:I see. Your friendship truly is something \"special\", Miles Edgeworth.Edgeworth:(Arngh! That's not \"friendship\"; it's \"utter humiliation\"!)Samurai Spear data jotted down in my Organizer.Knife rack area (subsequent times)Edgeworth:(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)Knife rack area (after correctly deducing spear)Edgeworth:(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)SpearEdgeworth:It's the Steel Samurai's primary weapon, the Samurai Spear. By damaging the Samurai Spear, Larry... ...it is clear that you still lack the proper awareness to be a real actor.Larry:Well, it's not like I'm training to be a pro! Oh, but I guess you can call me a pro at getting caught up in all sorts of mischief!Edgeworth:(...You also seem to be a pro at being defiant in the face of punishment for said mischief.)Golden statueEdgeworth:There... was the exact same statue sitting in that Babahlese office we examined.Franziska:It's the Primidux Statue. It was the national treasure of the Principality of Cohdopia. There was only one of these statues, meaning that one of the two is a replica. But both Allebahst and Babahl claim to have the real thing.Edgeworth:(What an incredibly childish fight to have.)Allebahst's Primidux Statue data jotted down in my Organizer.Edgeworth:(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)ExamineKnife rackEdgeworth:(There was almost the exact same wall mount for the knives on the Babahlese side. But I can't see any of the details from this distance.)StatueEdgeworth:It's a Primidux Statue. There was one of these on the Babahlese side as well.Franziska:I hear it's very valuable and made of pure gold. It was the national treasure of Cohdopia. There was only one of these statues... ...meaning that one of the two is a replica. But both Allebahst and Babahl claim to have the real thing and won't budge from their claim.Edgeworth:(What an incredibly childish fight to have.)Flower on wallEdgeworth:The counterpart to the Babahlese butterfly is the Allebahstian flower.Franziska:The butterfly and flower. They're both lovely things... But can we interpret this to mean that Allebahst provides honey to Babahl?Edgeworth:Franziska, can't you come up with a more meaningful, or profound comment?Franziska:Very well then, let's hear what sort of profound comment you can come up with.Edgeworth:Ahem... Well, flowers cannot survive without the butterflies that spread their pollen. And butterflies cannot live without the nectar that flowers provide. If either one were to disappear from the equation, neither would survive. How was that, Ms. von Karma?Franziska:Your explanation took so long that I nearly fell asleep. Well, let's continue the investigation.Edgeworth:(Franziska, why can't you just admit I had something there?)Deduce statue (after examining table with photograph)Edgeworth:(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)Present Photo with Steel SamuraiEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Look at this photo, and tell me what you find odd about this scene, Ms. von Karma.\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:There is clearly... a contradiction here!Franziska:Yes, I believe you're right. Clearly, it's right there in your logic!Edgeworth:Arngh! (Apparently, I was mistaken.)Larry:That sure looks like fun, Edgey!Edgeworth:Well, it's not! (And let's not forget for whose sake I am suffering! I hope you're considering that!)Edgeworth:Look at this photo, and tell me what you find odd about this scene, Ms. von Karma.Franziska:...The apparent joy on the ambassador's face as he shakes that top-knot's hand?Edgeworth:That's not it! I was trying to point out that the statue in the photo is facing a different way!Franziska:You're right!Edgeworth:This statue is a national treasure. As such, only an ambassador or a secretariat-level person is allowed to handle it.

Well, let's continue the investigation.Edgeworth:(Franziska, why can't you just admit I had something there?)BodyEdgeworth:So this is the victim, DeMasque II...Franziska:What is with his gaudy outfit!?Badd:You don't know... about Mask\u2606DeMasque? A few months ago... this thief caused a lot of havoc on the populous [sic].Franziska:So this thief is separate from the Yatagarasu?Badd:...I thought they were for a while... because their M. O. and targets were different. DeMasque likes high-value trinkets and jewels, and being gaudy is his signature. Gumshoe was in charge of that investigation, so he'd know more about DeMasque.Franziska:That's alright. All I'd probably hear are tales of his failure anyway.Badd:Hmph... You haven't changed a bit, I see...Edgeworth:In any case... let's get started here, shall we? (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)Paper in handEdgeworth:What is he holding...? It looks like a piece of paper from a notepad. It would appear that directions on how to reach this room were written by hand. Hm? There is something written on the back as well.Franziska:...\"I'd like you to steal the Primidux Statue in this room\"... What is that supposed to mean? Who writes a note to themselves like that?Edgeworth:If I had to guess from the text... ...I would say that this is actually a request from someone about what to steal. (Just who is the person that requested the theft of the Primidux Statue?)DeMasque II's Note data jotted down in my Organizer.Paper in hand (subsequent times)Edgeworth:What is he holding...?

(Just who is the person that requested the theft of the Primidux Statue?)HeadEdgeworth:I thought that DeMasque had quit the business?Badd:This guy... he's just a copycat using the name. A phony \"successor\"... He's... just another petty thief... His real identity... is an out-of-work guy... by the name of Ka-Shi Nou. He's 29... and wanted on larceny charges. From his clothes... and what he was carrying... ...we determined... that this guy is the real DeMasque II...Edgeworth:The cause of death appears to be the loss of blood from the back of his head. It seems that he was struck with something very hard. In other words, he was bludgeoned to death.CostumeFranziska:There is not a single shred of fashion sense in DeMasque's costume.Edgeworth:Well, at least I can appreciate the great effort he must've put into making it.Badd:You two don't know? You can buy this costume almost anywhere now.Edgeworth:...It's being sold? Since when?Badd:Since around New Year's. The streets are practically flooded with them. Turns out, DeMasque is a lot more popular than I thought he'd be.Franziska:I can't believe that foolish fool would dress in fools' clothing to act foolishly!Edgeworth:(...We got your point about three \"foolish\"-es back, Franziska.)ClothFranziska:I suppose this was the wrapping cloth DeMasque II used to carry his stolen goods. But there's nothing wrapped in it now. I guess he never did manage to get his hands on whatever it was he was out to steal.SwordEdgeworth:So this is the murder weapon in this case.Franziska:There's blood on the blade. It's rather sweeping sword, isn't it?Edgeworth:What did you expect? It's Steel Samurai Daddy's secondary weapon. I only call it his secondary because although he uses his sword in most of his battles... ...it's his trusty Samurai Spear that he turns to in a real fight.Franziska:You sure know quite a bit about the Steel Samurai.Edgeworth:That's only because I saw the stage show earlier. (The owner of this sword is the Steel Samurai... or in other words, Larry. I should probably ask him about it... as detrimental as it is to proving him innocent.)Samurai Sword data jotted down in my Organizer.Sword (subsequent times)Edgeworth:So this is the murder weapon in this case.Franziska:There's blood on the blade.

What exactly is so great about top-knot there?Edgeworth:Hmph. Clearly, there is a depth to this show that a young person like you can't fathom.Franziska:Speaking of young people... Aren't young children the target audience of this show of costumed actors?FireplaceFranziska:It's a fireplace. And by the looks of it, I don't think it's been used recently.Edgeworth:Yes, I can't say that I see anything unusual about it.DeskFranziska:This must be Ambassador Alba's desk.Edgeworth:His notebook is open on his desk. He must've been in the middle of some important work.-- Sapling Growth Log --It finally sprouted today.........Franziska:Funny, it doesn't look like \"important work\" to me.Flowers on windowsillEdgeworth:(Hmm... Two gorgeous flowers are in full bloom here. I'm sure flowers as lovely as these must have an equally as lovely name.)Franziska:Miles Edgeworth! Are you done staring? I should hardly think passionflowers are all that rare.Edgeworth:...Passionflowers? That's a rather... unusual name.Franziska:It was named by priests in the 15th century for the Passion of Christ.Edgeworth:......... (As they say (changed from [Hmm, as they say] in the original release), you learn something new every day.)Passionflowers data jotted down in my Organizer, so that I may remember its name.Flowers on windowsill (subsequent times)Edgeworth:(Hmm...

(As they say (changed from [Hmm, as they say] in the original release), you learn something new every day.)Examine evidenceAllebahstian Knife (after examining knife rack)HandleEdgeworth:The handle on this knife was made to be removable. The killer tried to make this look like a Babahlese knife by switching the two handles. Which means that there must be some reason behind that action!Flower ornamentationEdgeworth:There's a striking flower ornament on the handle of this knife. Compared to the Babahlese knife's handle, this larger one gives Allebahst more presence.PartnerFranziska:Yes?TalkThe investigationFranziska:I've only just arrived in this room myself, which is why we need to investigate some more.Edgeworth:Yes, I agree.Franziska:Our priority should be on understanding what the current situation is.Edgeworth:Hmph... Of course. I was planning to do that from the very beginning.Franziska:In that case, hurry up and start the investigation already!Edgeworth:I-I will! So let's get started! (In order to find out the truth behind what happened here... ...I should start by gathering as much information as I can.)Mask\u2606DeMasque II (this Talk option disappears after examining piece of paper, Mask\u2606DeMasque II's head, and sword)Franziska:Mask\u2606DeMasque... I see that yet another weirdo has popped up in my absence.Edgeworth:Yes, and as I understand it, he was a brilliant thief to whom the world was his oyster. He stole extremely valuable objects one after another for a while. Detective Gumshoe was in charge of the case, and not once did he catch DeMasque.Franziska:Hmph... I had already researched all that, you know.Edgeworth:Last year, when DeMasque gave himself up and was finally arrested... ...he was apparently represented by that man. Knowing him, I'm almost curious as to how insane that trial turned out to be.Franziska:Indeed...Edgeworth:(But why would anyone want to kill DeMasque? I should really find out some more about the victim...)Steel Samurai (this Talk option disappears after correctly deducing spear)Franziska:What exactly is that hideous, fashion faux pas of a costume he's wearing supposed to be? I feel like I've seen it somewhere before... ...but there's something different about it than what I remember.Edgeworth:That costume is from the very first Steel Samurai. It's a live-action superheroes show on television, beloved by children and adults alike. The Steel Samurai's weapon is the Samurai Spear. And it is with the Samurai Spear that he performs his special attacks... ...which enthrall all who watch them in action.Franziska:You seem to know quite a bit.Edgeworth:N-Not at all! And in any case, Franziska... ...I believe the Samurai you are familiar with is the second one... ...the Nickel Samurai, which was part of that case last year. Do you recall that case?Franziska:! Y-Yes, I remember... Although, I'd much rather it stay buried in the depths of my mind...Edgeworth:(Not that I blame her... She was shot during the course of that trial. I fear she may still be suffering great trauma over the shooting...)Franziska:Nnrgh... Anyway, that aside... ...it looks like the Steel Samurai is the suspect this time.Edgeworth:Yes, although that's because of who is inside the costume rather than the character... Ack! That's right! If HE is the Steel Samurai...Franziska:Miles Edgeworth, have you been in shock over something this whole time?Edgeworth:N-No, I'm not in shock over anything... (I wanted to forget that I had received the Steel Samurai autograph from Larry... But... the autograph... The drawing of the Samurai Spear and the caricature of his face... Why did he waste so much time on the most useless parts of the autograph!?)Larry:Hm? Hey, Edgey! Did you say something?Edgeworth:NO! I didn't say anything!Primidux Statue (appears after examining golden statue and table with photograph) (this Talk option disappears after correctly deducing golden statue)Franziska:It's a statue of the founder of Cohdopia, Primi Dux. Because it's the national treasure, I've heard that only a few are allowed access to it.Lang:That's exactly right. Even we're not allowed to touch it. Not without the ambassador's permission, anyway. If we lay even a single finger on it... BAM! It's instant jail time!Edgeworth:...Understood. (So it's that precious of a national treasure that a single touch can lead to arrest. And yet, I sense that there is something off about the statue... What is the source of this unease I feel...?)PresentCounterfeit Bills or Babahlese InkFranziska:Recently, incredibly well-forged counterfeit bills have been found coming out of Zheng Fa. Counterfeits made using Babahlese ink, that is. That smuggling ring that I've been chasing is the group behind the whole operation. But mark my words, no one involved in it will escape my whip! They will all know pain! Hmph!!Edgeworth:Wh-What am I getting whipped for!?PassionflowersFranziska:Passionflowers... They are a most beautiful flower.Edgeworth:Indeed. They are a magnificent species.Franziska:But always be mindful of the fact that beautiful flowers have painful thorns.Edgeworth:......... (I suppose that advice coming from a woman with a whip is best heeded...)After correctly deducing spear and golden statue, and examining knife rack, paper in hand, Mask\u2606DeMasque II's head, sword, and flowers on windowsill:Edgeworth:Hmm... I guess that about wraps up my investigation. Hm? That's...Larry:Yo! Pink Princess! How're you feeling? Still feeling ill?Pink Princess:..................Franziska:...And yet another strange character comes out of the woodwork.Edgeworth:And so the Pink Princess also comes to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. (I believe I may need to speak with her as well...)TalkPink PrincessEdgeworth:Ms. Pink Princess. I have a few questions I'd like to ask you.Pink Princess:..................Edgeworth:Ms. Pink Princess! If you would please answer... ...meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!Oldbag:Heh... This must be what they call \"fate\".Edgeworth:H-How could this happen two days in a roooooooooooow!?Larry:Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat the--!? A-Aren't you Ms. Oldbag!?Edgeworth:Why are YOU so surprised!?Oldbag:Ah, so you're the one they got to play the Steel Samurai. It's too bad I didn't realize that until now.Edgeworth:...You are acquaintances with Larry...?Oldbag:Why, yes. We worked at the same company for a little while, you know. That's why it's OK, my Edgey-poo! You don't need to be jealous!Edgeworth:Nnnnghoooooooh!Oldbag:I was in the next room, you know, trying to get in some beauty sleep. But it was so noisy here that I couldn't fall asleep. So I came over to complain! So imagine my shock when I saw my precious Edgey-poo waiting here for me! I mean, who could've imagined that you would ever come to a show like this! I guess I've misjudged you, Edgey-poo!Franziska:You \"misjudged\" him...?Oldbag:I thought he was trying to avoid me, you know.Edgeworth:(That was no misjudgment on your part! That's PRECISELY what I was trying to do!)Oldbag:But it looks like the winds have shifted and he's now willing to be chased after! I'm simply overwhelmed! Don't you worry, Edgey-poo! I'd chase you for forever! To the ends of the Earth!Franziska:...Isn't that just peachy?Edgeworth:(This is one of those rare times when Franziska and I actually see eye to eye...)TalkPink PrincessEdgeworth:Now then, ahem... What are you doing here? I thought you were working at Gatewater Land as the Pink Badger...?Oldbag:What are you talking about!? That was ages ago!Edgeworth:(That was YESTERDAY!)Oldbag:Look, I worked at Global Studios before, a long time ago, right? Well, they called me up this morning, kind of out of the blue, actually.Franziska:They called you?Oldbag:Apparently, the girl who plays the Pink Princess collapsed from a bad cold. It happened so suddenly, so they called me in to be her last minute replacement.Edgeworth:(Do they not have enough people on staff at that studio...!?)Oldbag:I really couldn't say no, so here I am, playing the role of the heroine! Instead of that Mindy girl, I mean. But the poor girl, I feel bad for her. Because they let me stand in for her, she's going to have a terrible time when she returns. I mean, I'm not exactly great at reading that strange font they use, plus I was called in to be a stand-in at the very last second, so I tripped over all the most important lines, I threw that rag doll instead of the shuriken, hit the Steel Samurai instead of the enemy, and the audience was in an uproar, but as an avant-garde actress, they'll forgive me, because I tell you, they're really just a bunch of simpletons.Franziska:...You're a rather lively old lady.Edgeworth:S-So basically, you received the stand-in request this morning, correct?Oldbag:You got it. If you need to see it, I've got it right here. Look.Franziska:...It appears that she is telling the truth.Stand-In Request data jotted down in my Organizer.Oldbag:I tell you, my fine acting moved the entire audience to tears!Edgeworth:(Yes, tears of laughter, as I recall.)Oldbag:But being famous has its problems too, you know. Here, take a look at this.Franziska:...?Oldbag:It's a letter from a stalker! I was just taking my break when I found this stuck under the door to my room. Honestly, you really have to watch out for these kinds of things! Look at what it says! \"W\u00e9ndy, I'll be descending on you from above tonight. Your loving knight\". Hmph! How absolutely revolting! I mean, you'd think he could get my name right. There's no accent in my name!Edgeworth:(Wait, this horrible handwriting... Where have I seen this before...?)Oldbag:Ah, but now that you're here, Edgey-poo, I feel 100% safe.Edgeworth:Eh? I... Where do I factor into this?Oldbag:You'd bust that evil stalker-man for my sake, wouldn't you, Edgey-poo?Edgeworth:Well... if you allow me the liberty to handle this in my own way... ...I'll gladly dispatch a detective to your house later.Oldbag:Oh, come on, Edgey-poo!

Stop being so dismissive and playing hard to get!Time of the murderEdgeworth:What were you doing at the time of the crime?Oldbag:What crime?Edgeworth:What--!?Oldbag:After the show was over, I've had nothing but free time on my hands. So I used the fireplace (Used the fireplace - At the time of the crime, Ms. Oldbag was warming her hip in the room next door.) in the room next door to keep my bad hip warm.Franziska:Well, a murder occurred in the room right next to yours!Oldbag:Is that right? Oh, Edgey-poo! I'm so scared! Hold me! Carress me!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:I-If you could please not cling on to my personage! [sic]Franziska:In any case, I take it then, that you failed to show up at Ambassador Alba's speech?Oldbag:Oh, that. No, I didn't go. I mean, I may have the heart of a young, tender maiden... ...but my body just refuses to cooperate at times. As soon as the show ended, my hip started acting up and got stiff. I couldn't move at all!Edgeworth:Can you provide proof of your condition?Oldbag:Oh, you just go on ahead and ask the doctors in the infirmary. They're the ones who carried me from the theater all the way to this embassy.Edgeworth:(I have to admit, the thought of her not being able to leave that room is rather pleasant.)PresentStand-In RequestOldbag:Ah, what a strange twist of events. Because they needed a stand-in, I was able to become a heroine, just like that!Edgeworth:I assume that the actual reason you were called in is due to a lack of personnel.Oldbag:Well, there's that too. But no matter what you say, it's obvious that I have presence. I bet that's how I caught the eye of the director. I ask you, is being beautiful really such a crime!?Edgeworth:(I suspect even the director is lamenting the lack of personnel from the depths of his heart.)Letter from a StalkerOldbag:So this person will be descending on me from above tonight, huh!? Oh, Edgey-poo! I'm so scared! Hold meeeeeee!Edgeworth:I-If you could please not cling on to my personage! [sic]Oldbag:Honestly, beautiful people have it so hard. All it took was for me to be up on that stage for a little while, and a stalker is born!Edgeworth:Actually, the whole time while you were up on that stage, you were in-costume. Therefore, no one should've recognized you or what you looked like underneath...Oldbag:But there is that thing, you know. They say people can identify you by your aura. So even without seeing my face, my stalker could see the beauty within me. So you see! That's how I charm the pants off of men!Edgeworth:(Charm? You? Preposterous.)Anything elseOldbag:What's this!? A present for me?Edgeworth:N-No! Obviously, I can't simply give you a piece of evidence!Oldbag:Hmph... I see. You're just embarrassed to give it to me in front of all these people. But don't worry, I can wait. A \"present of love\" from my Edgey-poo is beyond worth it!Edgeworth:Gnnnrk.........!Franziska:...What a bother.Edgeworth:(If you only knew how much, Franziska...)LogicConnect \"Smoke from chimney\" (after clearing \"Time of the murder\" Talk option with Larry Butz) and \"Used the fireplace\"Edgeworth:There is no trace of this room's fireplace being used...Franziska:And your point is?Edgeworth:Ahem, smoke was supposedly pouring out of the chimney connected to this fireplace. At least, according to Larry. This is a contradiction of facts, is it not?Franziska:Are you sure he wasn't just disoriented or something up on that roof?Edgeworth:There is testimony from an investigator that puts Larry at this particular chimney... ...so, no, I don't think it was a mistaken impression on Larry's part. On the other hand, the fireplace in the next room was being used at the time. Where do you suppose the smoke from that fireplace went?Franziska:Ah, I see. So what you are proposing is this. The smoke that came out of the chimney was actually from Ms. Oldbag's fire. So basically, the fireplaces of neighboring rooms... ...share one chimney (Shared chimney - The office fireplace and the one in Ms. Oldbag's room share the same chimney.)! Is that what you are implying?Edgeworth:Precisely.After clearing all Talk options with Wendy Oldbag:Officer:Prosecutor von Karma! I've brought the police dog, as you requested, sir!Franziska:Good work. You may leave now, Officer.Edgeworth:Hmm... This dog...Franziska:I requested the assistance of a dog in our search for the Yatagarasu.Lang:Looks like you guys have some pretty bright dogs in this country, too.???:Woof! Woof!Lang:Hey... You're a real cutie, aren't you? Yeah! That's a good boy!Badd:...That's the police dog Gumshoe's been taking care of... I think its name is... Missile.Franziska:What a fitting name for a police dog that dashes out in front and attacks.Edgeworth:(That action alone isn't exactly what's going to solve the case for us, you know.)Franziska:Now, Missile. I want you to find some clues! Go!Missile:Woof!Franziska:Good dog. You really are quite bright, aren't you? ...Unlike a certain someone I know. Now, what do we have here? What... is this? It looks like a small hot dog, but...Edgeworth:Hm? Wait, Franziska, isn't that... an official Samurai Dog?Missile:Grrraaaaaaarh!Franziska:Ah! No! Bad Missile! .........He ate it. I wonder if it's alright for him to eat that?Edgeworth:It's just a meat-substance snack featuring the Steel Samurai. I'm sure he'll be fine.Franziska:That's quite a bit of information you gathered there in a single, quick glance.Edgeworth:(We should really be focusing on why there was a Samurai Dog there in the first place.)Franziska:Hm? It looks like that snack wasn't all Missile found.Edgeworth:Oh? And what do we have... here...?Franziska:It appears to be a lady's undershirt. I wonder if Ambassador Alba might have an interest in cross-dressing?Edgeworth:I somehow doubt that. It doesn't look like the shirt would even fit him. (A Samurai Dog and a lady's undershirt... What are these two items doing in a room like this? Given the circumstances, the lady's undershirt could only belong to one person. I suppose I should get this over with and ask the owner of said undershirt about it...)Lady's Undershirt data jotted down in my Organizer.TalkWendy OldbagPresent Lady's UndershirtLeads to:\"If you could please take a look at this brown-colored undershirt...\"MissileMissile:Woof!Franziska:He was a much bigger help than I thought he would be.Edgeworth:Yes... However, there are a few aspects I don't understand about what he found.Franziska:In that case, you should keep on investigating until you do understand. Now, my subordinate, continue with the investigation!Edgeworth:A-Alright, I will. (It is with great dread that I proceed and do what I must to solve the case...)PartnerMissileFranziska:We borrowed this dog from the local precinct... ...but is he really capable of handling this case? I thought police dogs are usually of a much larger breed.Edgeworth:He may be small, but he is an excellent police dog. Furthermore, he was raised by Detective Gumshoe.Franziska:You had me thinking the dog was capable until you said that he was raised by Scruffy.Edgeworth:Yes, well... (I suppose that wasn't the best of arguments to use...)Edgeworth:If you could please take a look at this brown-colored undershirt...Oldbag:Oh, Edgey-poo... What is the meaning of this!?Edgeworth:?Oldbag:Why did you steal that thing from my bags...? All you had to do was ask, and I would've gladly given you as many as you'd like!Edgeworth:Nnnrghk! Th-Thanks, but no thanks! This shirt was found here at this crime scene.Oldbag:What!?Edgeworth:Come now, why don't you just confess... and explain what it's doing here.Oldbag:I know nothing! NOTHING, I tell you!Edgeworth:What!?Oldbag:Oh, I admit that I used the fireplace to dry that shirt! But I can't really help the fact that I had to, you know! Wearing that Pink Princess costume was like being in a sauna! And on top of that, I get fingered as a suspect!? You're too cruel, Edgey-poo!Edgeworth:Are you claiming that you never once set foot inside this room?Oldbag:Of course I am! If I had been the one to find the body, do you think I'd be as calm and relaxed as I am!? I tell you, it's always like this! It's always my fault for some reason or another. That weekly tabloid article is missing? The camera is missing? That lawyer always makes sure it's my fault they're missing. Speaking of missing, there's the matter of my husband. Can you believe when we got married, he said, \"I guess I'm stuck marrying you.\" What kind of way to propose is that!? What he should've done is he should've whispered in my ear, \"I don't deserve you... but I can't help it. Will you marry me?\" Honestly, men these days!Edgeworth:Umm... Well... (I don't believe she is lying about her actions... So I can safely assume she really was drying her shirt by the fireplace on her break. And somehow, the undershirt managed to move from the next room into this one (Undershirt from next door - The undershirt was found in the office fireplace, but how did it get there?)...)

Don't just ignore me and my question! Aren't you going to stick up for me!?Oldbag:Ah, about that. See, after the show, I went to rest a spell in the dressing room. Because of my bad hip, you know.

And the owner of this piece of evidence was in the room next door. And yet, despite that, Missile found it in the fireplace of this room. This.. lady's undershirt...Franziska:Are you seriously claiming that it somehow passed through a solid brick wall?Edgeworth:Not quite. The fireplace in this room is connected to a chimney. The other fireplace in the other room is also connected to the same chimney... ...leading us to the possibility that the two fireplaces are connected to each other.Franziska:...Perhaps a closer look at the back of the fireplace is in order.Edgeworth:(There is an X on the back wall of the fireplace.

It's the fact that there is a secret passageway through this room's fireplace (Connected fireplaces - Ambassador Alba's office fireplace is connected to the neighboring room's fireplace.)!)Franziska:We now know that the fireplace connects the two rooms. But how exactly is that significant? You aren't going to suddenly name the old lady as DeMasque II's killer now, are you?Edgeworth:No, she couldn't move at all because of her stiff hip... ...so she could not have been the one. Unfortunately, I believe... ...that this fireplace has nothing whatsoever to do with DeMasque II's murder.ExamineFireplace (after connecting \"Shared chimney\" and \"Undershirt from next door\" Logic)Edgeworth:(This fireplace connects this room with the room next door. But the old bag was suffering from a stiff hip at the time and couldn't move. Which means that all of this is probably irrelevant to DeMasque II's murder.)After connecting all possible Logic and clearing \"Samurai Dogs\" Talk option with Wendy Oldbag:Investigation CompleteEdgeworth:(It would appear that the answer has made itself known.)Lang:You're making quite a confident face there, Mr. Prosecutor. Bring it on! I'm ready to counter any argument you may have!Edgeworth:Very well, then. If you are prepared... ...I'll show you exactly where my deductions have led me!Larry:Good! I'm counting on you, Edgey!Edgeworth:Leave it to me, Larry. My first attack will be... to expose your lie for what it really is.Larry:M-My liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!?Edgeworth:I know that there is still something you are keeping from the rest of us.Larry:Wh-What's wrong with you!? Why is it you won't believe me no matter what I say, Edgey!? Curse you! I should just hurry up and die already if that's how it's gonna be! I'll confess to every murder in the whole world, and then kill myself... ...and throw everything into mass confuuuuuuuuusion!Lang:Heh, you made some wonderful friends as a child, I see.Edgeworth:Larry, I only have one thing to say to you.Larry:Even if you make that face at me, it's no use! A man who is ready to die is strong-willed, you know!Edgeworth:Larry, it doesn't matter what sort of harebrained trouble you've caused... ...I only ask that you do not lie to me. If you cause an innocent person to be judged unfairly because of some insipid lie... ...I will never forgive you!Larry:E...Edgey...Edgeworth:Although, allow me to say... ...that I consider you to be among the innocent in this case. And that I will draw the real killer out. You can trust me on this.Larry:Alright. I... I... This time... This time, I'll tell you the whole truth, OK!? What happened, what didn't happen, the works!Edgeworth:Just what happened will do! Now then, if you would please testify as to what you did up on the roof tonight.Testimony-- Up on the Rooftop --Larry:After the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy.Then, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador.After that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around.That's when I spotted the chimney. A chimney like that is a rare thing, you know.So then, I wanted to play Santa and decided to give it a try.Edgeworth:Larry, I thought I just finished telling you to not lie anymore.Larry:Umm......... But it's... kinda, ultra-embarrassing.Edgeworth:And what exactly is so ultra-embarrassing that you can't tell me!?Larry:Edgey, man! I just said it was embarrassing, so of course I can't just blurt it out! So you're just gonna have to reason it ouuuuuuuuuuuuut of me!Franziska:As your superior, I command you to hurry up and expose this man's lie!Edgeworth:I have every intention to, for I'm not about to let us waste time on such a trifling matter.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You left the pushcart? Could you please clarify that statement for me? Larry: Yeah. So the wheels on the pushcart got covered in dirt from the Rose Garden. It would've made a mess of the floor inside, so Ambassador Alba said to just leave it. Edgeworth: (Well, it WOULD be rather impolite to dirty another country's embassy.) Larry: Come to think of it, I recall seeing the Pink Princess on my way into the Embassy. Edgeworth: And what was she doing? Larry: Nothing in particular. Because she was being carried by some docs on a stretcher! Edgeworth: (She must've been incapacitated by the pain of her bad hip that she suffered during the show.) Larry: So, I came into the embassy, right? And then...Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you shook hands with the ambassador of the Kingdom of Allebahst, did you...? Larry: Yeah! Can you believe it!? I did something really cool for a change. ...But, honestly speaking, there's nothing interesting about shaking some guy's hand. Lang: Hey, there. Are you disrespecting another country in their very own embassy? Franziska: As someone with roots in this country, I'm feeling nothing but incredible shame at this second. Edgeworth: Agreed... I apologize for his inconsiderate words. Now, Larry, please continue. Larry: Wh-What is with all of you!? You keep saying that kind of thing and I'll tell you only lies! Edgeworth: You're already telling us nothing but lies! So let it go and move on! Larry: Aaaaaaaalright, already! You don't need to glare at me like that, Edgeeeeeeey!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Larry, I want you to listen very carefully and take this to heart. The whole point of your life is to cause misery and pain to everyone you encounter. Larry: I-I knoooooooow! I get it! I'm totally the bad guy again! Lang: Lang: I thought you're his friend. Don't you think that was a bit harsh? Lang Zi says: \"True friends are bosom friends.\" If you are in trouble, call on your bosom friend, whose shoulder you can truly cry on. Larry: Hey! Bosom buddy! I hope you're listening carefully to my testimony! Edgeworth: (Has it crossed your pea-sized brain yet that Agent Lang is only out to arrest you, Larry?) Lang: Now then, you were wandering around inside the Embassy, and then what happened?Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I should hardly think that chimneys are that rare. Franziska: Agreed. Especially since they are a traditional feature of American houses. Lang: Plus, many grand buildings have even larger and fancier chimneys. Larry: Yeah, but the kind of chimney I'M talking about is the really romantic type! Edgeworth: A \"romantic\" chimney...? Larry: It might sound kinda silly... umm... but women seem to really enjoy them... And I just had a good feeling about that chimney!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You... suddenly wanted to play Santa...? Larry: Oh, well, actually, I dressed up as Santa once before already. That was down at Gourd Lake. Edgeworth: Gnnrk! ...I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't dredge up such unnecessary memories for me! Lang: Heh, sounds like you guys share a lot of history. A perk to being childhood friends, huh? Besides, it's not a felony to dress up and play Santa, you know. Santa doesn't go around killing people after he comes down a family's chimney, after all. Edgeworth: (Actually, is it worth delving into whether or not playing Santa is a big deal?) Raise an objection Leads to: \"Actually, I believe in the case of this man, playing Santa is actually quite a big deal.\" Don't raise an objection Lang: So I guess you don't have a problem with my statement? Edgeworth: Perhaps... (...I need to gather more information first.) Leads back to rebuttal Leads to: \"Actually, I believe in the case of this man, playing Santa is actually quite a big deal.\" Lang: So I guess you don't have a problem with my statement? Edgeworth: Perhaps... (...I need to gather more information first.) Leads back to rebuttalEdgeworth: As I suspected, you do have something to hide, Larry. But what could be so embarrassing that you'd be willing to go to jail for it!?Franziska: This man's mind is a complete mystery to me.Edgeworth: I believe it's a secret to everyone of a normal mindset how Larry's mind works. However, taking into account his usual, women-obsessed way of thinking... ...I believe that his lie this time is also related to a woman, and this is what I intend to prove.",

I totally didn't want to see Ms. Oldbag so much that I'd try to go down a chimney! Owww!Franziska:I advise you to stop right there in your bashing of a lady.Edgeworth:Well, I must admit that I, myself, hardly ever have the want to run into that lady. However... what if you were misinformed, and under the wrong impression? Then what?Lang:Define \"wrong impression\".Edgeworth:I simply mean that the man before you thought to enter the old lady's room... ...without knowing one very important fact.

It's always like this! You acting so high and mighty, and then you bully me! That's why... I refuse to look at it!Franziska:Be quiet and just take a look!Larry:Well, if you say so, Franzy. But only because you say so!Edgeworth:(Some people never change... Even if their attitudes do change at the whim of women.)Larry:...So what's up with that anyway?Edgeworth:Hmph. Why, it's proof that you never even knew existed, of course.Larry:Oh, is that all! Well, I don't need it right now, so I'll just give it back to you.Edgeworth:What!?Larry:Heh, I've got you on the ropes now, don't I?Edgeworth:(Was that piece of evidence unrelated to the question at hand...? I need to think through this one more time. Larry didn't know one very important fact when he tried to sneak into the old bat's room.)Leads back to:\"And that fact... is best summed up with this!\"Edgeworth:This is something the old lady received from her employer for the night. The girl who normally plays the Pink Princess... Mindy, was it again? It seems that this man is quite taken with that actress.Larry:Larry:But that's not true, Edgey!Edgeworth:...?Larry:She's the one with the hots for me! I just know it! I can feel her sexy beam piercing my heart when she's watching me! Seeeeeexy beam, I tell you!Franziska:You filthy, despicable, inconsiderate, fickle, idiotic, cowardly... ...apparition of a man! You haven't matured at all since we last met!Lang:Hey, Mr. Prosecutor.Edgeworth:Yes?Lang:This guy... He's got bigger problems than just getting involved in murders, I take it?Edgeworth:I suppose you could put it that way.Larry:Hey! What the heck, man!? I don't get you guys at all! Why do you all have to make me out to be some sort of bad guy!?Edgeworth:To return to the original topic, I propose that at least this much has been made clear. Without any knowledge that Ms. Mindy had fallen ill... ...Larry tried to make his way into the Pink Princess's room. That much we know for sure!Larry:Larry:Hey, Edgey... Looks like I've got the hang of this court thing now.Edgeworth:But we're not in court at the moment...Larry:Shut up! I see what's going on here, and it looks just like what you do in court!Lang:I guess old boy here still has something he'd like to say. Lang Zi says: \"Until the root of the tongue dries, one never knows the whole truth.\" You shouldn't form conclusions until everything is out in the open, which is why I'll listen.Larry:Alright! Then get ready to listen to me defeat Edgey in a battle of wits!Edgeworth:(Larry, have you forgotten that should I \"lose\", your victory prize will be your arrest?)Testimony-- Larry's Assertion --Larry:So you think that all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy?Well, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick.It was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech.Then, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant.But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!?Edgeworth:..................Lang:..................Larry:..................Hey! Someone say something!Edgeworth:Larry, are you seriously trying to submit this, not as a confession, but as testimony?Larry:So what if I am!? Is there something wrong with that!? My claim is a claim claiming my claim. Do you have a problem with that!?Oldbag:So it was you! You're my stalker! But I should warn you, it doesn't matter what kind of flattery you throw at me. I'm the devoted type of woman who's wholly focused on one man, and one man only! And as long as Edgey-poo is alive, I can't just drop him and be unfaithful! No, I can't! Although, earlier, I was tempted just a tiny-winy bit by that wolf-man! But that was just a test of my love for my dear Edgey-poo, which I passed with flying colors! But from now on, I will stay completely true to my beloved Edgey-poo for the rest of eternity! I swear it!Larry:Aaaaah! I-I'm so inspired!Franziska:You're such an inconsiderate, cowardly, idiotic, and all-around completely worthless man!Edgeworth:(I thought I heard something ominous just now, but perhaps it was just my imagination.) I believe there is nothing further for me to prove at this point...Larry:What do you mean!? Of course you've still got something to prove! You still have to show some proof that I was trying to meet up with Mindy!Edgeworth:\"Proof\", you say?Larry:Remember, Edgey!? Everything is evidence in court, right!?Edgeworth:You mean, \"Evidence is everything in court,\" Larry, but I understand your point.Larry:Yeah, see! I'm totally a pro at this now!Edgeworth:Very well. If you wish to see the evidence... ...then let me show you the last piece of evidence you'll ever wish to see.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, I have been saying that for a while now... After all, if not for that, then for what other reason did you wish to go down that chimney? Larry: Larry: You can't say that without any evidence! That's against the rules, Edgey! Lang: Lang: Heh! Thanks for keeping the prosecutor in line for me, Mr. Suspect! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph... I have the evidence. And if you wish to see it that badly, I can introduce you two. Franziska: Ah, but it's not good to keep them waiting, my subordinate. Hurry and show them already! Larry: L-Lies! All lies, Edgey! Edgeworth: Well, if YOU wish to lie, then by all means, continue. Because I'm ready to expose your lie at a moment's notice! Larry: Arrrrnngh... Y-You won't get the better of me! Now, let's see...Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the smoke coming from the chimney really that thick? Larry: You bet! It was so thick, I had tears pouring out of my eyes! It was a mess! Lang: .................. Franziska: .................. Edgeworth: Hmph... I see. You do realize that you've just confirmed for us, your chimney escapade? Larry: What!? Th-That's totally unfair! Y-You tricked me, Edgeyyyyyy! Edgeworth: Hardly. You simply have yet to master how to counter this cross-examination technique. Larry: W-Well, what I just said was a slip of the... No, I mean, I said the wrong thing! Besides, isn't this what you really meant to say about what I did tonight?Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not quite sure how you could mistake that actress for this lady... Oldbag: Ooh, Edgey-poo! Are you staring at me? Ah, are you finally succumbing to my feminine charms? Edgeworth: I-I should think that the Steel Samurai is the one who should know all about your \"charms\". Larry: Whaaaaat!? M-Meeeee!? Edgey! What are you trying to do to me!? Edgeworth: Nothing! Simply that the Steel Samurai and the Pink Princess are husband and wife. Oldbag: Aww, is my poor, little Edgey-poo jealous? Edgeworth: Arngh! I-If you could please drop that line of discussion right this instant...! Larry: But Edgey! I... I told you! I already have Mindyyyy! Edgeworth: Speaking of Mindy, exactly what kind of woman would you say she is? Larry: Larry: Edgey, are you seriously telling me you don't know who THE Mindy is? She's just like what her name means! She's super sweet with a great smile! I don't mean to brag, but she's one of the troupe's fastest rising stars! Edgeworth: Interesting... Lang: Lang: Hah! So you're saying a woman like that is what made you late to the speech? Larry: ...Huh? C-Curse you, too! Why is everyone out to make a suspect out of me!? Look, all I can say is this! I was late to the speech...Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I suppose you might be correct in a small way. Larry: Wh-What do you mean by that!? Franziska: Besides being a suspect in a murder, there are a few other things you are a suspect of. Larry: Oooonngh... Not you, too, Franzy! Oldbag: You tried to stalk me! But I won't let you intimidate me like that! Larry: Look! I already told you, Ms. Oldbag! I wasn't after you, I was trying to see Mindy... Lang: Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, can I just arrest this guy already? Edgeworth: .........I completely understand how you feel, Agent Lang. Larry: W-Wait! Pleeeease listen to what I have to saaaaaaaay! Edgeworth: If you have a serious assertion to make, then I'd consider listening, however... Larry: No problem! I'm gonna put all I've got into this, so listen good, OK!?Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Larry... This is the final point you wish to make? Larry: You got it! I've called on all the energy I have and told it to you with all my soul! Edgeworth: In that case, allow me to take that soul and break it. Larry: Huh? Franziska: Yes. We'll stamp it under our feet until it's been ground to a fine powder! Larry: A-A fine powder...!? Oldbag: .................. Larry: Eek! Lang: If you really put all your soul into that, then you're ready for what's coming, right? Larry: I-In place of the honorable Larry, I offer my soul to you. Edgeworth: ...Larry... Come out from behind there and face this like a man! Larry: Y-You're scary, My Lieeeeeeege!Edgeworth: (This whole testimony is one giant confession of all that he's done tonight.

So you're saying a woman like that is what made you late to the speech?Larry:...Huh? C-Curse you, too! Why is everyone out to make a suspect out of me!? Look, all I can say is this! I was late to the speech...Larry:Then, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant.PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:I suppose you might be correct in a small way.Larry:Wh-What do you mean by that!?Franziska:Besides being a suspect in a murder, there are a few other things you are a suspect of.Larry:Oooonngh... Not you, too, Franzy!Oldbag:You tried to stalk me! But I won't let you intimidate me like that!Larry:Look! I already told you, Ms. Oldbag! I wasn't after you, I was trying to see Mindy...Lang:Lang:Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, can I just arrest this guy already?Edgeworth:.........I completely understand how you feel, Agent Lang.Larry:W-Wait! Pleeeease listen to what I have to saaaaaaaay!Edgeworth:If you have a serious assertion to make, then I'd consider listening, however...Larry:No problem! I'm gonna put all I've got into this, so listen good, OK!?Larry:But why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!?PressEdgeworth:Edgeworth:Larry... This is the final point you wish to make?Larry:You got it! I've called on all the energy I have and told it to you with all my soul!Edgeworth:In that case, allow me to take that soul and break it.Larry:Huh?Franziska:Yes. We'll stamp it under our feet until it's been ground to a fine powder!Larry:A-A fine powder...!?Oldbag:..................Larry:Eek!Lang:If you really put all your soul into that, then you're ready for what's coming, right?Larry:I-In place of the honorable Larry, I offer my soul to you.Edgeworth:...Larry... Come out from behind there and face this like a man!Larry:Y-You're scary, My Lieeeeeeege!Present Letter from a StalkerEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Larry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter.\"Edgeworth:(This whole testimony is one giant confession of all that he's done tonight. He's practically begging me to show why he bothered to put himself through all of this.)Edgeworth:Larry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter.Larry:H-H-H-H-H-Hey! Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Why are you showing that thing to me!?Franziska:\"W\u00e9ndy, I'll be descending on you from above tonight. Your loving knight\" Well, isn't that just romantic?Edgeworth:But you weren't able to \"descend on her from above\", were you... Mr. Loving Knight?Larry:Aaaaaaaaaaaarghn! I-I have no idea what you're talking about! I don't remember a thing!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:You can pretend to be ignorant all you'd like, but it's written right here. This letter proves that you were not out to meet the old lady... ...but rather, that you were attempting to pay Ms. Mindy a visit! (What part of this letter shows that the person Larry had intended to meet was Mindy?)Present \"W\u00e9ndy\"Edgeworth:Leads to:\"Larry, I suggest you take up penmanship lessons.\"Present anywhere elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:Hmph... All will be answered if we simply look here!Larry:Really? Because I'm not sure where I'm supposed to be looking, Edgey!Edgeworth:Hmm... (My finger is apparently not as precise as I thought (changed from [thought it to be] in the original release).) You leave me with no other choice. I shall have to point you to a spot that even you can easily comprehend.Leads back to:\"What part of this letter shows that the person Larry had intended to meet was Mindy?\"Edgeworth:Larry, I suggest you take up penmanship lessons. That is... ...if you never wish to experience this level of embarrassment ever again.Larry:Wh-Wh-Wh-What the heck!? What are you talking about!? Speak English!Edgeworth:You wrote \"Mindy\" so sloppily that it became \"W\u00e9ndy\" to the average eye.Larry:...Hey, stop picking on me... It's so embarrassiiiiiiiiiing!Lang:There, there. Isn't that what childhood friends are for? They're the best, aren't they? ...For punching. But that will have to wait until we're off of this crime scene.Larry:Eek! Edgey! Save me from the scary man!Edgeworth:Sure, if you're willing to make amends. Starting with your incredibly embarrassing mistake!Larry:.........That... That... That wasn't me!Edgeworth:Come again?Larry:It's a fake! Someone's out to get me, so they made that fake letter... ...to set me uuuuuuuuup!Franziska:Accept your defeat graciously!Larry:But... you guys are being so mean...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:...Penmanship analysis.Larry:What's that?Edgeworth:No matter who, all people have certain unique features to their handwriting. Ergo, all we have to do is compare the handwriting in this letter to a sample of yours... ...and we'll know soon enough who it was that sent this letter.Larry:I...I...I... I'll never write another thing in my life!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Tsk, tsk, tsk... It's no use, Mr. Loving Knight. For you've already graciously provided me with a sample of your handwriting!Present Steel Samurai's AutographEdgeworth:Leads to:\"This autograph and our mysterious letter...\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:You remember this, don't you?Larry:Nope, But if you're giving it to me, I'll take it.Edgeworth:As if I'd give this to you! (Oops. wrong piece of evidence...) Hmph... A-Anyway! I don't need you to write anything for me!Leads back to:\"For you've already graciously provided me with a sample of your handwriting\"Edgeworth:This autograph and our mysterious letter... If we compare the handwriting, we'll know the answer to our questions soon enough.Larry:Gnn...nnn... Nnnnnnnn...!Edgeworth:Confess now, Larry... to your miserable failure!Larry:I...I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorry! I... I... I did it... It was me causing trouble again... I admit it. You hit the nail right on the head... Edgey...Edgeworth:(So, he finally confesses...)Larry:I saw the Pink Princess being carried around in a stretcher, and got worried, alright!? I wanted to go into Mindy's room, but the doctors wouldn't let me in. So what choice did I have!? It was the chimney or bust, Edgey!Franziska:Your mind jumped from the door to the chimney? What a criminally overactive imagination.Larry:Well, at least I was honest and wrote Mindy a letter, and stuck it under the door. That way, she wouldn't be so shocked when I came down through the chimney!Edgeworth:(Except for the fact that the letter was an utter failure at conveying said sentiment...)Larry:I'm really, really sorry...Edgeworth:Larry, you may be a shameful, good-for-nothing blight on the face of humanity... ...however, I always knew you weren't the killer. I told you to trust me... ...because, at the very least, I can attest to that about you.Larry:Edgey... You're... Aaaack!Franziska:We've lost a lot of valuable time because of you...!Larry:Owwwwwwwww!Franziska:In any case, I believe we can say that we now know exactly what happened. Mr. Larry Butz sought to climb down the chimney... ...not for access to the crime scene... ...but to enter the room of the elderly lady next door.Lang:Lang:Great job, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, I still find it a bit unbelievable that the two of you are friends.Edgeworth:..................Lang:But the suspicion on that guy over there... ...isn't completely resolved yet, so don't get any funny ideas about running off, OK?Larry:Owwwww...w? H-Hey... What--? Edgey... What does the wolf-man mean when he says I'm not off the hook yet?Edgeworth:.........He means the murder weapon. Larry, did you forget? There are two layers of suspicion hanging over your head.Lang:That's exactly what I mean. We can't only rely on the words of the suspect, after all. We may have figured out where he was and what he was doing all night... ...but the blood-stained Samurai Sword that was left at the crime scene... As long as there is no satisfactory explanation for that... ...this wolf will refuse to ease up on his bite!Larry:Eeeeeek! Edgey! That guy... He looks like he's seriously about to take a bite out of me!Edgeworth:I'm well aware. And you should be as well, that this upcoming battle will be crucial.Lang:Thanks to the cooperation of our lovely bumbler... ...I've been dealt a very nice hand, and a sweet trump card. Looks like we're about to enter the final bout! Now, Mr. Prosecutor! Let's see what you've got!Edgeworth:(I can easily point out the contradiction in the supposed \"murder weapon\"... ...but the real problem for me is figuring out what the real murder weapon is. This will be a high-stakes gamble! But this is one game I can't afford to lose!)Argument-- Why Larry? --Lang:I was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II.Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood.It was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead.Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too.Edgeworth:Isn't it a bit far-fetched to accuse someone simply on the basis of ownership?Lang:But this owner wanted to sneak onto the crime scene. I think that's plenty to go on, don't you?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:If you're alluding to his reason for being by the chimney, we've already established that!Lang:Lang:Hold on there, Mr. Prosecutor. You two are long-time friends, right? Who's to say you didn't fabricate the evidence to give him an alibi?Edgeworth:.........You're accusing me of fabricating evidence?Lang:You think I can believe anything you produce? Forging evidence is all you prosecutors do!Edgeworth:.........! (This man has some serious issues with prosecutors...)Larry:But come on, I can't think up something as complicated as that! Right, Edgey!?Edgeworth:Larry, I can agree because I know you and your personality well. However, Agent Lang knows nothing about you... or me, for that matter. (I sense his hatred for my entire profession emanating from his entire being. Meaning that the only way I can prove Larry's innocence is to present irrefutable evidence.)Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were the first to discover the body this time... Lang: \"This time\"...? What's that supposed to mean!? You'd better watch what you say! Edgeworth: I only said \"this time\" because earlier, Kay was the first to discover the body in Babahl... ...and your secretary, Agent Shih-na, was ready to accuse her of murder for that. Lang: Lang: Hah! So are you going to use that excuse to call me \"suspicious\" now? Edgeworth: Of course not; I was simply pointing out the usual pattern with discoverers of bodies. Lang: But in the Babahlese case, there was proof that she was holding the weapon, right? Well, in this one, it's a bit different, since we know exactly where the weapon is.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Excuse me, but \"glittering red and offering up the scent of blood\"...? Lang: Do I have to spell it out for you? I mean the sight and smell of blood, of course! And according to the tests, the blood on the sword belongs to the victim. The sword was made to only be used on stage, so it's not sharp. But it is pretty weighty. It's certainly heavy enough to beat someone to death with. Which leads me to suspect that the victim was beaten to death with the sword. Edgeworth: Beaten to death, huh? (This last statement is too important to just let it slip by.) Changes statement from \"Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood.\" to \"Beside him was the Samurai Sword... covered in the victim's blood.\" Adds statement \"I suspect he beat the victim to death with that thing.\"Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So the sword is covered in the victim's blood...? Lang: Yeah, the lab results confirm that the blood on the sword matches the victim's. But the sword is as dull as a vanilla envelope. It's just a stage prop, after all. Larry: The Steel Samurai is all about \"Safety First\"! So you can't use it like a real sword! Edgeworth: The Steel Samurai has spoken. Oldbag: .................. Franziska: The Pink Princess also appears to have something she'd like to petition to you personally. Edgeworth: ...Wh-What the Pink Princess would like to say can wait for the day after eternity! Lang: Anyway, my point is that even though the sword is too dull to slice with... ...it's certainly heavy enough to bludgeon someone to death with. Therefore...Edgeworth: Edgeworth: About this Samurai Sword... Have you received a report from forensics yet? Lang: They confirmed that the blood on the sword belongs to the victim. Edgeworth: Alright, but have they confirmed that the outline of his wound is consistent with the weapon? Lang: Tell me something... Do you see the dead body right there in front of you? So! If they were conducting the autopsy right now, shouldn't that body not be here!? Well!? Edgeworth: Hmph... I suppose so. (I guess they must still be investigating this room. Meaning that it's possible he doesn't know about that piece of evidence's true nature.) Lang: Anything else you'd like to chit-chat about? No? Good. Now let's continue.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Larry has already testified that he forgot the Samurai Sword here... Larry: Yeah! I was shaking hands with the ambassador in here, and I left it behind by accident! Lang: Lang: So what? You lied earlier, so who's to say that this excuse isn't just another lie? Larry: But I forget stuff all the time! Right, Edgey!? Tell him! Edgeworth: ...Why don't you tell him yourself!? Franziska: You see? What did I tell you earlier? No one will buy such a pathetically weak excuse. Edgeworth: Yes, well... I know that it's not possible to prove such an excuse as truth... Lang: And yet you offer it up as fact!? You're a worse person than I originally thought. Edgeworth: You are free to think what you'd like, however, I know that Larry is not the killer. Agent Lang, please continue with your argument. I'll expose the flaw in it soon enough!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because he is the owner of the weapon, therefore he must be the killer, is it? Lang: No. Climbing all the way up to the chimney is plenty suspicious in my book as well. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Regarding that, I have already drawn the truth out, and the truth is one thing I don't bend. Lang: Lang: It doesn't matter if it's you or whoever. You prosecutors are all the same. And as for me, prosecutors are the one thing I don't trust in! Franziska: Franziska: An agent who doesn't trust prosecutors? What are you playing at? Lang: ...Sorry, sis. But there are only two things I trust: my subordinates and evidence at the crime scene. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang hates prosecutors. But as long as he trusts evidence that has been left at a crime scene... ...then there IS something I can show him that he can believe in!)Edgeworth: (It's simply not possible that the Samurai Sword is the real murder weapon. So I should focus on proving that point to Agent Lang first.)",

So I should focus on proving that point to Agent Lang first.)Edgeworth:Do you know what this is, Agent Lang?Lang:Heh, it's a long spear, right? We used to use those a lot in my country a long time ago. Piercing, mowing people down... Spears are the weapon of heroes throughout history.Franziska:It's the next most effective weapon after the whip.Edgeworth:(I think the whip is in a slightly different category...)Lang:So, what's your point? Are you going to tell me that the spear is the real weapon?Edgeworth:No. I simply want you to take a look at this section here.Lang:The way it's bent...?Edgeworth:Precisely. Apparently, a certain troublemaker hit it against a wall in this embassy earlier. And as you can clearly see, the insides of the Steel Samurai's weapons are hollow. In other words, they're replicas that aren't strong enough to deliver a damaging blow... ...let alone the multiple strikes necessary to bludgeon someone to death. And yet, there is not even a dent in the Samurai Sword. How do you explain that!?Lang:A...Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!Larry:Oh, yeah... The sword and the spear are made of the same stuff, so they bend easily! But I wish they'd make them out of better stuff! Because the spear got bent... ...I wasn't able to do my special \"Early Summer Rain Jab!\" move! Man, I got such an earful from the director of the play for not doing it in the show!Edgeworth:(The Steel Samurai's special move was changed tonight because of him...!?)Samurai Spear data updated in my Organizer.Larry:Yeoooooooooowch!Franziska:That's more than enough of your whiny whimpering! Now... back on the topic of the spear.Edgeworth:Yes, let's return to the real topic of discussion. (This is where the real gamble begins. I don't have a real strategy, per se... ...so all I can do for now is let the chips fall where they may.)Franziska:Using guesswork and taking risks in place of real logic is hardly the Von Karma way. It's neither smart nor very clever.Edgeworth:Ms. von Karma, as you know, unlike your father, I am not a genius prosecutor. Plus, I doubt his record of a 40-year win streak will ever be broken.Franziska:..................Edgeworth:But perhaps, it is for the best if it remains unbroken. For no one should've conceived of the notion to \"convict all defendants\" in the first place!Franziska:Franziska:What a foolishly foolish statement from a foolish fool who hates to lose... It's the job of a prosecutor to make sure that all defendants are found guilty in court. There is nothing more important in this world than a perfect victory!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:That may be your opinion, however, I don't believe that's all we are.Lang:.........!Edgeworth:As a prosecutor, what I pursue is not the perfect victory, but the perfect truth. And if that means that the bridge I must cross will crumble beneath my feet... ...then let it crumble as I walk on towards the truth!Lang:Lang:You're good at keeping me entertained, Mr. Prosecutor! But you know... humans are delicate creatures. The slightest bump and we expire. I'd like you to consider, if you will, the possibility that... ...the sword was used in such a way that the attack killed DeMasque II without bending it.Edgeworth:..................Lang:So, what do you think of my hypothetical scenario? I think you know what to do here, right? And what you need!Edgeworth:Of course. (What I need is evidence even he (changed from [Agent Lang] in the original release) can't refute! This is it! It's time to bring this to a close!)Argument-- Why Larry? Pt. 2 --Lang:It's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone.And under these circumstances, it's the only logical conclusion.We searched the Embassy, top to bottom, but the victim's blood is only on that weapon.So isn't it only natural that suspicion would fall onto the owner of said weapon?Edgeworth:How long do you intend to cling onto that preposterous theory?Lang:As long as I want, because we examined every corner within the walls of this Embassy. There's no stone we've left unturned! And we have managed to come up with only one logical conclusion! That the only place inside this embassy with the victim's blood on it is this sword.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:You left no stone unturned? Is that a fact?Lang:Lang:If you've got something to say, then say it in the only way I respect, Mr. Prosecutor!Edgeworth:Yes, of course. In that case, allow me to make it all crystal clear for you!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: May I inquire as to how are you able to make such a claim, Agent Lang? Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Capable of miracles beyond comprehension, a mysterious creature is man.\" Edgeworth: (...Rather than man, it's Agent Lang's quotes that are getting increasingly incomprehensible.) Lang: The human body is a mysterious thing. Even with a toy-like sword... ...it's easy to kill a man if you hit just the right spot. Which is why I think it's possible to kill with this thing without leaving a dent. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But we can only be sure one way or the other by seeing if the wound matches the sword! Lang: Hmph, I know that. But as long as it's a possibility, I can proclaim it as much as I'd like.Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But you must know that your conclusion is wrong! Lang: Given the circumstance I'm in, the only people I can trust are my subordinates. Because they're a much more trustworthy bunch than you prosecutors will ever be. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you call yourself a professional...!? Lang: Lang: You still don't see, do you, Mr. Prosecutor? You have to earn my trust. And the only way to do that is to show me proof of another possible murder weapon! Edgeworth: (Another possible weapon... In this room, there is only one other thing left... This is going to be a gamble, but I can't withdraw from the game now!) Lang: You're not going to get me to trust you by the power of your glare alone, you know. Plus, I have other reasons as to why I think the Samurai Sword is the murder weapon!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The only place where you could find blood was on the Samurai Sword...? Lang: That's right. Even with Luminol. Which means that there are no other possibilities outside of what I've already outlined. Edgeworth: (Do I have a problem with Agent Lang's assertion that the Samurai Sword is the weapon?) Raise an objection Leads to: \"If you believe that there is no other door of possibility left to open...\" Don't raise an objection Edgeworth: (Hmm... Perhaps I should wait and see how this plays out for a bit longer.) Agent Lang, if you could be so kind as to continue with your testimony... Lang: Hrmph! Leads back to rebuttal Leads to: \"If you believe that there is no other door of possibility left to open...\" Edgeworth: (Hmm... Perhaps I should wait and see how this plays out for a bit longer.) Agent Lang, if you could be so kind as to continue with your testimony... Lang: Hrmph! Leads back to rebuttalEdgeworth: Edgeworth: And what if you were to find a different murder weapon? Would that clear Larry's name? Lang: Lang: Are you saying you can prove the possibility? Edgeworth: Of course. And if you don't believe that I can... ...then I'll show you something to convince you; evidence that you cannot refute! Lang: .........Hah! Ha ha ha ha ha! Sounds like fun, Mr. Prosecutor! Alright then, go ahead and show me what you've got!Edgeworth: ...I can prove to you... the possibility that the murder weapon is something else... ...but I cannot do so on my strength alone.Franziska:Franziska: Miles Edgeworth. What are you running straight into a quagmire for? I thought you said that you were busy in pursuit of the perfect truth. And if that's the case, then show me this perfect truth, if it exists at all!Edgeworth: Don't worry. Thanks to you, I've already prepared myself to do just that.Franziska: There's no need to thank me. I'm simply doing what any good superior would.Edgeworth: Heh... I suppose you are. Very well, then. I will show you the possibility of a different murder weapon.",

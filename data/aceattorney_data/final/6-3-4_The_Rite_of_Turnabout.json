We've got some more questions.\nSound the alarm! Prisoner 201's escaped!\nRebel 1:\nWell, you know, with Datz back on the streets, things'll be on the up and up for us.\nRebel 2:\nKeep your voice down! You WANT that rebel hunter to find us or something?\nRebel 1:\nCome on. We're small fries compared to--\nAaaagggh!\nMay 9, 3:30 PMTehm'pul Temple\nPhoenix:\nAhh... Another fine day in the Kingdom of Khura'in. ..................... It's so peaceful here... (I can't believe it's been two weeks already, but... ...this place is really starting to grow on me. Still... It sure was a rough start. Now, to do what I came here to do: To see Maya! Her long ascetic training is finally coming to an end. But before it does, she said something about one last rite she has to perform today.)\n???:\nMr. Wright!\nAhlbi:\nHap'piraki!\nPhoenix:\nHey, Ahlbi. Hap'piraki.\nAhlbi:\nOh, you've mastered the traditional greeting of Khura'in!\nPhoenix:\nI-I don't know about that... (But I guess all that practicing is paying off!)\nAhlbi:\nHave you gotten used to life at the temple?\nPhoenix:\nI'm grateful they're letting me stay here, but the mornings start a little too early for me.\nAhlbi:\nHa ha ha! Yes, well, morning prayers do begin at dawn! After all, you can never pray too much! Daily devotion is very important here in Khura'in!\nPhoenix:\nHats off to you guys. I don't know how you do it.\nAhlbi:\nAnd today's a special day, full of even more prayer than usual! There's nothing better in this world than being able to pray to your heart's content!\nPhoenix:\n(I... can think of a few things I'd rather do...) So, what makes today so special anyway?\nAhlbi:\nYou mean you don't know?! Today's the Purification Rite! It's only performed once a year!\nPhoenix:\n(That's what Maya must've been talking about on the phone yesterday. I wonder what her role in it is...) ...So, what exactly is Maya going to be doing for this \"Purification Rite\"?\nAhlbi:\nWhat?! Didn't she tell you?! She's playing the role of Lady Kee'ra! It's only the most important part of the entire rite! It's unprecedented to have a foreigner play such a key role!\nPhoenix:\nWow, that's really something.\nAhlbi:\nIt really is! Helping out such an amazing person... ...has been the greatest honor of this humble tour guide's life!\nPhoenix:\nSo, who is this \"Lady Kee'ra\" you mentioned?\nAhlbi:\nAllow me to explain! Once upon a time, hundreds upon hundreds of years ago... ...there lived a female warrior who fought valiantly to establish the Kingdom of Khura'in.\nPhoenix:\nLet me stop you right there!\nAhlbi:\n...Is something wrong?\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's just... I get the feeling I'm in for a really long story.\nAhlbi:\nYeah... I'd say it normally takes around two hours to tell.\nPhoenix:\n(Whew, dodged a bullet there.)\nAhlbi:\n...Oh, right! You're supposed to finally see Miss Maya today! The story can wait, then. In the meantime, you can read up on the rite with this!\nPhoenix:\nAn English guidebook? Where did you dig this up from?\nAhlbi:\nI found it just lying there in the temple library. I figured no one's using it, so I borrowed it!\nPhoenix:\nHm? Hey! This book belongs to Maya. See, there's her name on the back. Guess there's no harm in keeping this for a while, then.\nRites Guide added to the Court Record.\nAhlbi:\nMiss Maya should already be at the site where the rite is to take place. Let's go! ...To the Plaza of Devotion!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Maya's matured any since I last saw her.)\nAhlbi:\nIt's on a mountaintop, so it might get a little cold, though!\nPhoenix:\nI think I can handle it.\nExamine\nTemple\nPhoenix:\n(I should offer a prayer now and then since they're letting me stay here. Hmm, let's see... May there be a slightly softer futon tonight. And may tomorrow's breakfast be a little bigger.)\nAhlbi:\nI'm impressed by your prayerful heart! Prayer is at the heart of Khura'inism, after all. May the Holy Mother's blessings be upon you!\nPhoenix:\nOh, uh... (Now I feel kinda bad...)\nBuildings\nPhoenix:\nWhat are those buildings over there?\nAhlbi:\nThose are training halls. Monks continuously undergo rigorous training there, day in and day out.  ...You could try it out for a day if you'd like. They do really interesting stuff -- like meditating while standing on their heads!\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's REALLY okay, Ahlbi! Thanks!\nWater\nPhoenix:\nThis is a really gorgeous spring.\nAhlbi:\nYou have an excellent eye for beauty, sir! This is the Guiding Waters -- the centerpiece of our temple tour! It's a sacred pathway for people's mitamah, so don't ever wade into it.\nPhoenix:\nWhy? What would happen if I did?\nAhlbi:\nI-I don't think we should even be talking about this. Just don't go in it, okay?!\nPhoenix:\n(What's the worst that could happen...? (B-But we're okay for now, right...? As long as we stay out of the water?)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nAhlbi:\nThere have been a lot more tourists this year than last.\nPhoenix:\nThen your tour guide business must be booming.\nAhlbi:\nIt is! But I have more important things to do right now! Namely... helping you, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll tip him a little extra for his help later...)\nWhat to do\nAhlbi:\nLet's head over to where the Purification Rite will be held.\nPhoenix:\nWhat sort of rite is it?\nAhlbi:\nUmm... We'd wind up missing a whole day of the rite if I were to explain it...\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, I think I'll just go see it for myself...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nAhlbi:\nWooow! What a beautiful badge!\nPhoenix:\nIt's the attorney's badge we use in my country.\nAhlbi:\nIt kind of looks like a sunflower to me.\nPhoenix:\nYep, and I'm pretty sure there's even a reason for it.\nAhlbi:\nPlease do explain, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nM-Maybe next time. (I should've known he'd ask me to explain...)\nAnything else\nAhlbi:\nIs this... some sort of new tourist souvenir?!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but no.\nAhlbi:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nSorry to be such a disappointment...\nMay 9Plaza of Devotion\nPhoenix:\nBrrr... I-I-It's s-s-so c-c-cold... (It's like the air itself is made of ice.) But look at all these people...\nAhlbi:\nWell, this IS the day we come to offer prayers to Lady Kee'ra, the protector of our land. It's amazing to see how devoted everyone is!\nPhoenix:\nDevoted... Right... But couldn't they just as easily do all this praying someplace warmer?\nAhlbi:\nThis, too, is a part of our religious training! It helps us build strength of spirit and willpower! Further up, at the end of those stairs, is the Inner Sanctum.\nPhoenix:\nI see... Everyone I've met so far seems deeply religious.\nAhlbi:\nOf course we are! After all, Khura'in is also known as the Land of Prayer. It's said that we Khura'inese spend an average of fifteen hours a day in prayer.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! F-Fifteen...?!\nAhlbi:\nFrom the moment we wake, to the moment we fall asleep, our hearts are always in prayer. You see all the square flags around here? They're known as prayer flags. They contain the prayers of our people!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, he's talking about these colorful strips of cloth. There's something written on each one.)\nAhlbi:\nSuch piety is the glory of our people, and...\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm afraid that story's going to have to wait for another time, Ahlbi... Maya should be here any minute now.\nAhlbi:\n...Oh, yeah, you're right! I can't wait to see Miss Maya again.\n???:\n...Pardon me, O noble traveler.\nAnime cutscene\n???:\nHow do you fare, Mr. Wright? It's been many a day.\nPhoenix:\nA-And, uh, who might you be? M-Maya?!\nAhlbi:\nMiss Maya! Hap'piraki!\nMaya:\nHap'piraki, Ahlbi. And you, Mr. Wright... May the Holy Mother guide you on your journey.\nPhoenix:\n.........Oh, um, thanks.\nMaya:\n...Hee hee! Long time no see, Nick! Well? Well? Did I surprise you with my act?!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, you can say that again. (This is Maya Fey. She's a spirit medium from Kurain Village back home. She was also my assistant for quite some time. ...But that was many years ago. Her ability to channel spirits saved me more times than I can count.)\nMaya:\nI sure miss those days. It was a ton of fun being the REAL boss of Wright & Co. Law Offices!\nPhoenix:\n(Now she's here, training to be the leader of Kurain Village and the master of her craft. Apparently, to become the master of the Kurain Channeling Technique... ...you have to train here in Khura'in, since this is where the technique originated.)\nMaya:\nDidn't I sound just like a pious nun when you saw me just now?! Too bad that's about all I learned from all the training I did.\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. You haven't changed a bit, Maya.\nMaya:\nHuh? And what's THAT supposed to mean?\nPhoenix:\n(She may look a little more mature on the outside, but inside, she's the same old Maya. ...I'm actually kind of glad for that.)\nExamine\nFlags\nPhoenix:\n(Ahlbi said these are called prayer flags. And the prayers written on them are carried throughout the kingdom by the wind. Now, if I were to pray for something... ...it would be for me to not get dragged into any more trouble than I already have been.)\nGate\nPhoenix:\nWhat a magnificent gate. You can tell it leads to someplace sacred like the Inner Sanctum.\nMaya:\nSadly, only holy people are allowed through there. And here I am, hoping to show you just how amazing I've become during the rite today. All of that spiritual power I built up during my training is going to rush out like a raging river!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah... Just try not to overdo it, okay?\nPraying people\nPhoenix:\nWow... No one's moved a muscle.\nAhlbi:\nThose people will stay in that position and pray for two days straight, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nTwo days straight?\nMaya:\nGlad I'm not them! AND that I get to be Lady Kee'ra!\nPhoenix:\n(M-Maya...! Don't be rude!)\nMaya:\nYou just hang in there, Nick. It's only two days, after all!\nPhoenix:\nI don't recall signing up for this part of the tour...\nMaya:\nYou know what they say: \"When in Rome\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Now I understand the saying, \"There's no place like home.\")\nTalk\nMaya\nMaya:\nI heard what happened, Nick! You ended up in court almost as soon as you got off the plane, huh.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well, it's kind of a long story.\nAhlbi:\nI was the accused! But you should've seen Mr. Wright in action! He was amazing!\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha ha ha...\nMaya:\nHmm... I bet it was another one of your famous seat-of-your-pants, come-from-behind wins, huh.\nAhlbi:\nW-Well... I WAS almost found guilty any number of times.\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, so it wasn't my finest hour. So sue me.)\nMaya:\nYou haven't changed a bit, either, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch. It definitely stings more when it's coming from her...) So, I guess you've finished the bulk of the training needed to become the master, right?\nMaya:\nOh, you mean the \"Special Meditation Course for Increasing Spiritual Power\"? Yep! I've completed the full two years! I can finally go home once I perform the Purification Rite today!\nPhoenix:\nActually, I was wondering why they're having a foreigner conduct one of their sacred rites.\nMaya:\nWell, the high priest's wife usually conducts it each year... ...but with her baby on the way, it's just more than she could handle. So the high priest practically begged me to stand in for her this year.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you may not know all of their customs, but with your training, I'm sure you'll do great.\nMaya:\nYou bet! Just you watch, Nick! I'm going to be the best Lady Kee'ra: Guardian Diety [sic] ever!\nPhoenix:\nI'd better throw in a few prayers for things to not end in a flaming disaster, then.\nGuardian deity (appears after \"Maya\")\nPhoenix:\nSo about that guardian deity you'll be portraying today... What exactly are we talking about here?\nMaya:\nWell, first of all, Lady Kee'ra isn't really a deity in the way we think of them back home. She's a real person who fought to establish the Kingdom of Khura'in a long, long time ago.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, so she actually existed.)\nMaya:\nAnd now the kingdom's people worship her as a guardian deity. They believe she appears to protect the kingdom whenever it's in danger. Cloaked in a sacred robe, she's a champion of justice who defeats the kingdom's enemies!\nPhoenix:\nThat sounds like something you'd be into.\nMaya:\nI know, right?! Who wouldn't want to be a kick-butt warrior who takes on evil with a wicked dagger?\nPhoenix:\nR-Right... Whatever floats your boat. Still, Lady Kee'ra must really be a popular deity if all these people are here for her.\nMaya:\nYep. But there's more to it than just her popularity this year!\nPhoenix:\n(There's more?)\nThe rite's popularity (appears after \"Guardian deity\")\nLeads to:\n\"So, why's this rite attracting such a large crowd this year?\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nOh, hey! Congrats on getting your badge back, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Maya.\nMaya:\nNow you can go back to a life of bold-facedly bluffing the day away, everyday!\nPhoenix:\nThat's...  not exactly why I returned to the courtroom, you know...\nRites Guide\nMaya:\nHey! That's mine!\nPhoenix:\nWell, it was just sitting there in the temple's library, so Ahlbi sorta checked it out for me.\nMaya:\nHope it comes in handy, then! Oh, and by the way... the Maya Library of Guidebooks has a $2-a-day \"donation\" policy.\nPhoenix:\n...I guess Ahlbi's entrepreneurial spirit is contagious.\nPhoenix:\nSo, why's this rite attracting such a large crowd this year?\nMaya:\nBecause there's been actual sightings. You know, of the real deal.\nAhlbi:\nAllow me to explain! A mysterious figure clad in Lady Kee'ra's robes appeared, just like in the legends. And she began capturing members of the Defiant Dragons right and left!\nPhoenix:\nY-You're kidding, right?\nAhlbi:\nThey say it's only a matter of time till she gets their leader, the revolutionary Dhurke, too!\nPhoenix:\n(So Lady Kee'ra's a rebel hunter now, huh...) It's a bit hard to swallow though. I mean, even if they are trying to disrupt the peace... ...I doubt the actions of a band of rebels can bring a legendary figure back to life.\nMaya:\nI didn't believe it at first, either. But there's a real picture of her on the front page of today's newspaper! Sightings of her go back about two years... ...but this is the first actual picture of her to ever be taken!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe someone was able to actually capture her on film...) But couldn't this just be some Lady Kee'ra fan? You know, like you, Maya?\nMaya:\nYou mean like a cosplayer? Those rebels are no joke, Nick! They're trained in hand-to-hand combat and stuff! You think some regular cosplayer can take on people like that dressed in a costume, alone? That's why she HAS to be the real deal! It gives me chills just thinking about it! I bet Lady Kee'ra's spirit possessed the sacred robe or something!\nPhoenix:\nA spirit possessing a piece of clothing...? Umm... Maybe you should cut back on all those action-superhero shows, Maya.\nMaya:\nHey! What's that supposed to mean?! You're just jealous that I'm still young at heart! \"I've got a real office to run now, so I've gotta keep it real,\" right?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know who you're talking about, but that's definitely not me.)\nMaya:\n*sigh* You've really lost your edge since I last saw you. Those spikes of yours have grown really dull... and there's even one that's drooping!\nPhoenix:\n...Can we leave my hair out of this?\nMaya:\nAnyway! I swear that the Lady Kee'ra people have been spotting is the REAL DEAL! Besides, it's just so much more fun to believe it's true, you know?\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe you really buy all that... (Although... I wonder who's under that robe.)\nMay 9th Newspaper added to the Court Record.\nAhlbi:\nBut, Mr. Wright! She's the talk of the town! She even gave me this great new food idea! It's gonna be like a soul bun, but based on Lady Kee'ra! I'm calling it the \"Kee'ra Bun\"!\nPhoenix:\nT-Talk about a \"Kee'ra\" business strategy... Come on, Maya. Just admit it's you running around dressed as Lady Kee'ra already.\nMaya:\n! .................. Hee hee hee hee hee hee. I guess the jig is up!\nAhlbi:\nWhat?! I-Is it really true, Miss Maya?!\nMaya:\nIndeed! It is I... Lady Kee'ra! After hundreds of years, I have returned in this lovely young lady's body!\nAhlbi:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nMaya:\nOnly a minion of the Defiant Dragons could see through my disguise! Now... feel my wrath, foul lawyer! Hi-yah!\nPhoenix:\nOWWW!\nAhlbi:\nM-Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\n...Just kidding! I mean, come on. I may be dressing up as Lady Kee'ra for the rite today... ...but there's no way I could ever beat up one of those rebel-types!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know... That was a pretty solid left hook she just threw.)\nAhlbi:\nO-Oh! You were just trying to be funny! You really had me going there for a second!\nPhoenix:\n(No one can be THAT na\u00efve, right...?) Well, I hope you enjoy playing superhero at the rite today.\nMaya:\nOoh, when you put it that way! I'm even more hyped about it now than I was already!\n*jangle* *jangle*\nMaya:\nOh, I hear the sound of the high priest's footsteps. I'd better get going.\nPhoenix:\nHis footsteps?\nMaya:\nDuring the rite, he wears these really big bells on his ankles. That way I know he's coming. Pretty handy, right? Well, see you later!\nPhoenix:\n(I doubt they're actually meant to be a \"stop slacking\" warning system for you, Maya...)\nAhlbi:\nMiss Maya is always so bright and cheerful!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I'm glad to see she hasn't changed. (As in, at all... I wonder if this means her training's been all for naught... I hope not.)\nAhlbi:\nAh, it's Acolyte Zeh'lot.\nPhoenix:\nAcolyte Zeh'lot...?\nAhlbi:\nLook, he's the one praying in the red and saffron robe. He's a disciple of the high priest, Abbot Inmee, and lives and trains at his house. See how he prays in the cold without moving a muscle?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I could never do that...\nAhlbi:\nAh, it's Abbot Inmee! The Purification Rite is about to begin!\nPhoenix:\nSo that's the sacred robe Maya will be wearing during the rite. It looks almost exactly like what that figure in the newspaper photo was wearing. (Whoever it is must've worked really hard to copy it.)\nAhlbi:\nPlease, sir, it's not a good idea to stare like that. You could be struck blind!\nPhoenix:\nJust give me a few more seconds. I mean, this isn't something you see every day... ...Oh, those bells on the high priest's ankles... they're a lot bigger than I thought they'd be.\nAhlbi:\nMr. Wright! It's time to enter the prayer pose like everyone else. Those who don't will suffer the wrath of the Holy Mother!\nPhoenix:\nOkay, let's see... First, I kneel down and cross my ankles, and then I bow forward... Youch! Great... Now all I can see is the ground, and my back is killing me!\nAhlbi:\nYou really should have trained for this, sir...\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a sec... How long are we supposed to stay like this, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nThe rite requires that we stay like this... until the day after tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's two whole days! Nngh... I don't feel so...\nAhlbi:\nM-Mr. Wright! Are you okay, sir?! S-Somebody, heeelp!\n???:\n...ster... Wri... Mist... ...ight? Mister Wright! Please, you have to get up!\nPhoenix:\nUgh... Ouch, my aching...! ...Hm? Ahlbi...? Where are we?\nAhlbi:\nThe high priest's house at the foot of the Plaza of Devotion!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I passed out from that back pain. They must've carried me all the way here.)\nAhlbi:\nSomething terrible's happened! It's Miss Maya! She's... She's... Ooh, just follow me to the Plaza of Devotion!\nPhoenix:\n(Something must've happened while I was passed out.)\nAhlbi:\nMiss Maya's... She's been arrested!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What?!\nMay 10, 8:00 AMPlaza of Devotion\nPhoenix:\n*huff* *puff* (Where's Maya?)\nPoliceman:\nJust take it easy, all right!\nMaya:\nB-But I'm telling you! I-I... I haven't done anything wrong!\nPoliceman:\nHmph. You can talk all you want back at the station.\nMaya:\nL-Let me go!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nNick! I didn't kill him! I swear I didn't!\nPoliceman:\nQuiet, you! Come along peacefully or suffer the consequences!\nPhoenix:\nW-W-Wait a second! What on earth is going on?!\nPoliceman:\nI don't know who you are, but if you don't get out of my way--!\n???:\nHey! Back off, officer!\nPhoenix:\nE-Ema? Ema Skye?! (What's she doing in Khura'in?)\nEma:\nI'm so sorry, Mr. Wright... but we're placing Maya under arrest. All right, take her down to the station! But with respect -- got it?!\nPoliceman:\nYes, ma'am!\nMaya:\nN-Niiiiiiiiiiiiiick!\nEma:\n...............\nPhoenix:\nSo, what are you doing in Khura'in, Ema?\nEma:\nIt's a long story. Anyway, what are YOU doing in Khura'in, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nSame here -- it's a long story. But we can get caught up later. Right now, I need to know what happened.\nEma:\nMaya's... well... under arrest for the murder of the high priest.\nPhoenix:\nWait, the high priest was... murdered?\nExamine\nGate\nPhoenix:\nThat's a befitting gate for the path to the Inner Sanctum.\nEma:\nIt's apparently considered a sacred object to the people of Khura'in. I wasn't even allowed to dust it for prints.\nPhoenix:\nSo, even applying a little fingerprint dust to it would be sacrilegious, huh.\nEma:\nI guess so... But I applied some luminol on it instead when no one was looking!\nPhoenix:\nSounds like an invitation for the Holy Mother to strike you down later, Ema.\nPraying people\nPhoenix:\nWow... Even with the murder, all these people are still here, praying.\nEma:\nThey're so into it, they wouldn't notice anything you did to them.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean like... taking their fingerprints?\nEma:\nHuh?! Oh, um, who would ever do something like that?\nPhoenix:\nEma... You didn't...\nZeh'lot\nPhoenix:\nAcolyte Zeh'lot is really in the zone.\nEma:\nOh, you mean that monk who's been living at the victim's home? Yeah, he hasn't moved a muscle, even though his teacher has been murdered.\nPhoenix:\nI guess he's so deep in prayer, he's not aware of what's going on around him.\nTalk\nWhat happened?\nPhoenix:\nWhat happened, Ema? Please, tell me everything you can.\nEma:\nWell, basically, here was a murder during the rite as it was being performed last night. The victim is Tahrust Inmee, the high priest who was presiding over the rite.\nPhoenix:\nWait, hold on! \"Last night\"...? You mean to tell me, an entire day's passed since the Purification Rite?\nAhlbi:\nThat's right, sir. You passed out for a whole day from your back pain.\nPhoenix:\n(I never knew my back's like a ticking time bomb... I'd better take better care of it.)\nEma:\nThe murder took place at the Inner Sanctum where the rite was being held.\nPhoenix:\nThe Inner Sanctum...\nAhlbi:\nIt's the place where the spirit of Lady Kee'ra is enshrined! It's through that gate over there and up at the top of the mountain stairs just beyond!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, so that's why everyone is offering their prayers in that direction...)\nAhlbi:\nAbbot Inmee and Miss Maya went up to the Inner Sanctum to begin the rite... ...just after they finished the prayer you fainted in the middle of.\nPhoenix:\nSo, who do you think killed the high priest?\nEma:\nUnfortunately, Maya is our sole suspect right now. During the rite, the Inner Sanctum was off-limits to the general public.\nPhoenix:\nSo then, only the high priest and Maya could have been there when the murder occurred?\nEma:\nRight. Plus, the Inner Sanctum is on the side of a very steep mountain. The only way up there is the stairway that starts here at the Plaza of Devotion.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's why she's been arrested.)\nEma:\nAlso, the crime scene was only discovered after Maya came down alone. She's the one who told the worshippers in the plaza that the high priest was dead. ...And she made a police statement to that\neffect.\nPhoenix:\n(So she was the first one to discover the body... Well, that definitely doesn't help. That makes it even less likely that someone else was there at the crime scene.)\nAhlbi:\nMr. Wright, sir... Are you going to defend Miss Maya?\nPhoenix:\nYes, of course. There's no way she killed anyone.\nAhlbi:\nY-Yeah! I don't believe it, either! She's been framed! But this is really something else, huh, Mr. Wright? I mean, who'd have thought you'd have to take on that horrible court again?\nPhoenix:\n(Tell me about it. I never thought I'd have to go through another trial... ...where the Divination S\u00e9ance determines all, and defense lawyers are unwelcome.)\nEma (appears after \"What happened?\")\nPhoenix:\nSo, what brings you here, Ema?\nEma:\nBack in the U.S., I was working a case with an international prosecutor from Khura'in. He told me this is where I could see the latest techniques in international forensic science. I can't believe I fell for it! I mean, just look at this place. It's like we've gone back in time!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I can't say I've been impressed with the police work I've seen so far...)\nEma:\nStill, he said he takes on cases from around the world... ...so maybe next time, he'll have one in a major city somewhere.\nPhoenix:\nSounds like this prosecutor has taken a liking to you, Ema. After all, it's not every day a prosecutor takes a detective with them overseas.\nEma:\nI wonder... He's calm, and kind, and almost always has a smile on his face... ...but it's hard to tell what he's really thinking.\nPhoenix:\nThis international prosecutor... Is he the one who handled Trucy's case?\nEma:\nYes, he is!\nPhoenix:\nI take it he'll be the prosecutor on this one, too?\nEma:\nYes, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's already been assigned...\nAhlbi:\nP-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?! Pohlkunkaaa!\nPhoenix:\nYou know him, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nOf course! Everyone in Khura'in does. He's a highly revered individual, both as a prosecutor and a monk! If you go up against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... you'll incur the Holy Mother's wrath!\nPhoenix:\nBut it's my job to, as a lawyer...\nAhlbi:\nOh, right! Sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(Just great... A prosecutor who's also a revered monk in a deeply religious country... This trial's shaping up to be even more uniquely Khura'inese than the last one.)\nEma:\nI'm not sure I should be saying this, but he's a formidable opponent.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I heard Apollo had a really tough time, so I'd better give it everything I've got. Anyway, I'm glad you're here, Ema. They treat lawyers like criminals here.\nEma:\nCome to think of it, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi mentioned something to that effect. I'm not sure how much I can help, but I'll do what I can!\nPhoenix:\nReally? Are you sure you aren't going to get in trouble for helping \"the enemy\"...?\nEma:\n*gulp* He did come down on me pretty hard when I tried to help Trucy in that last trial... .................. Let's just say... I'll help where I can!\nPhoenix:\nTh-Thanks. But don't go getting yourself in trouble on my account, okay? (Prosecutor Sahdmadhi sounds pretty strict.)\nEma:\nSo, first things first. Let's start with this. Hot off the press, it's the high priest's autopsy report!\nTahrust's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nEma:\nThe victim bled to death from a deep stab wound to the abdomen. The murder weapon is believed to be Lady Kee'ra's Warbaa'd Dagger. It's used during the rite, however, the dagger has yet to be found.\nPhoenix:\nLady Kee'ra's dagger, huh... (I think Maya mentioned something about a dagger...)\nMaya:\nWho wouldn't want to be a kick-butt warrior who takes on evil with a wicked dagger?\nPhoenix:\nR-Right... Whatever floats your boat.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... And isn't that rebel hunter posing as Lady Kee'ra also armed with a dagger? Of course, hers must be a replica, right?) Would it be okay for me to go take a look at the crime scene, Ema?\nEma:\nThe police have already wrapped up their investigation... ...but the location itself is off-limits to the general public, so I'm not sure.\nPhoenix:\nEma, please! I'm begging you! Just like the police, I need access if I'm to mount a viable defense.\nEma:\n...All right, then. Leave it to me! I'll explain the situation to Prosecutor Sahdmadhi and the police later.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Ema!\nEma:\nYou have quite a climb ahead of you, so be sure to watch your step!\nPhoenix:\n...Wait, you're not coming with me?\nEma:\nO-Oh, no, I'm not climbing up there again. No way.\nPhoenix:\nI-Is it really that bad? I wonder if my back can handle it...\nAhlbi:\nYou get to go to the Inner Sanctum?! Oh, you're so lucky, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you join me, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nTh-Th-That's crazy talk, sir! If a commoner like myself were to set foot in there, I'd surely be cursed for all eternity!\nPhoenix:\nBecause the Inner Sanctum is off-limits for you, huh... Oh, well... Guess I'll just have to face this all by my lonesome. By the way, what about all the people still praying here? Aren't they going to go home?\nEma:\nThe customs of this rite require that they not move from this spot until tomorrow afternoon. It doesn't faze them to have police milling about. Some of them are even off-duty cops.\nPhoenix:\nWow, I guess this is what it's like to live in a deeply religious society, huh...\nEma (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo, what brings you here, Ema?\nEma:\nBack in the U.S., I was working a case with an international prosecutor from Khura'in. He told me this is where I could see the latest techniques in international forensic science. I can't believe I fell for it! I mean, just look at this place. It's like we've gone back in time!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I can't say I've been impressed with the police work I've seen so far...)\nEma:\nStill, he said he takes on cases from around the world... ...so maybe next time, he'll have one in a major city somewhere.\nPhoenix:\nSounds like this prosecutor has taken a liking to you, Ema. After all, it's not every day a prosecutor takes a detective with them overseas.\nEma:\nI wonder... He's calm, and kind, and almost always has a smile on his face... ...but it's hard to tell what he's really thinking.\nPhoenix:\nThis international prosecutor... Is he the one who handled Trucy's case?\nEma:\nYes, he is!\nPhoenix:\nI take it he'll be the prosecutor on this one, too?\nEma:\nYes, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's already been assigned...\nAhlbi:\nP-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?! Pohlkunkaaa!\nPhoenix:\nYou know him, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nOf course! Everyone in Khura'in does. He's a highly revered individual, both as a prosecutor and a monk! If you go up against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... you'll incur the Holy Mother's wrath!\nPhoenix:\nBut it's my job to, as a lawyer...\nAhlbi:\nOh, right! Sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(Just great... A prosecutor who's also a revered monk in a deeply religious country... This trial's shaping up to be even more uniquely Khura'inese than the last one.)\nEma:\nI'm not sure I should be saying this, but he's a formidable opponent.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I heard Apollo had a really tough time, so I'd better give it everything I've got. Anyway, I'm glad you're here, Ema. They treat lawyers like criminals here.\nEma:\nCome to think of it, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi mentioned something to that effect. I'm not sure how much I can help, but I'll do what I can!\nPhoenix:\nReally? Are you sure you aren't going to get in trouble for helping \"the enemy\"...?\nEma:\n*gulp* He did come down on me pretty hard when I tried to help Trucy in that last trial... .................. Let's just say... I'll help where I can!\nPhoenix:\nTh-Thanks. But don't go getting yourself in trouble on my account, okay? (Prosecutor Sahdmadhi sounds pretty strict.)\nEma:\nSo, first things first. Let's start with this. Hot off the press, it's the high priest's autopsy report! The victim bled to death from a deep stab wound to the abdomen. The murder weapon is believed to be Lady Kee'ra's Warbaa'd Dagger. It's used during the rite, however, the dagger has yet to be found.\nPhoenix:\nLady Kee'ra's dagger, huh... (I think Maya mentioned something about a dagger...)\nMaya:\nWho wouldn't want to be a kick-butt warrior who takes on evil with a wicked dagger?\nPhoenix:\nR-Right... Whatever floats your boat.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... And isn't that rebel hunter posing as Lady Kee'ra also armed with a dagger? Of course, hers must be a replica, right?)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nEma:\nCongrats on your return to the legal world! I wanted to congratulate you sooner, but I never had the chance.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Ema. And congratulations to you, too, on becoming a forensic investigator.\nEma:\nHeh heh, thanks. Oh, I know! Let's celebrate by dusting your attorney's badge for fingerprints! Or how about we do a luminol test on it?\nPhoenix:\nI think I'll pass on both, but thanks.\nTahrust's Autopsy Report\nEma:\nThe victim's name was Tahrust Inmee. He bled to death from a stab wound in the abdomen.\nPhoenix:\nAnd the killer?\nEma:\nAt the moment, our only suspect is the person who was with the victim at the time.\nPhoenix:\nIn other words, Maya.\nAnything else\nEma:\nIt's been ages since you've presented evidence to me.\nPhoenix:\nRemember when we worked that one case together? I seem to recall a thin layer of fingerprint powder on every piece of evidence then...\nEma:\nW-Well...! I guess they get that way from time to time now, too...\nPhoenix:\nAs enthusiastic as ever, huh, Ema.\nTehm'pul Temple\nExamine\nTemple\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not a Khura'inist, but maybe if I prayed with all my might... ...the Holy Mother will help me... Who am I kidding? I have to figure out how to solve this case myself.)\nBuildings\nPhoenix:\n(I can hear the monks' prayers all the way over here. Maybe the Holy Mother would answer mine if I slipped it in with theirs. Here goes... \"Please let me save Maya Fey!\")\nWater\nPhoenix:\n(I look a little haggard in my reflection. It's like the water's showing me how I feel on the inside... ...Wait, what am I doing?! I have to stay strong, especially for Maya.)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nAhlbi:\nI still can't believe there was a murder during the Purification Rite... Could it have been an act of divine justice by Lady Kee'ra?\nPhoenix:\nDivine justice, huh... (We wouldn't need a trial if that's what it was.)\nAhlbi:\nOh, no! Maybe I'm next for coming up with my \"Kee'ra Buns\"! P-Please, Lady Kee'ra! I meant no disrespect!\nPhoenix:\nUm, I don't think that's a terrible enough of a crime to be divinely punished for, Ahlbi...\nWhat to do\nAhlbi:\nWe don't have time for chit-chat, Mr. Wright! We have to prove Miss Maya's innocence!\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Let's hurry back to the Plaza of Devotion.\nMay 10Detention Center\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Maya is still being questioned. I'll just have to come back again later.)\nExamine\nBell\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bell here. I wonder if it's for calling the guard.\n*jingle, jingle*\nGuard:\nDon't do that unless you need something, you lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry! (I didn't even get to say anything!)\nGuard\nPhoenix:\n(Why does that guard keep eyeballing me? I can't let him get to me... I can't let him get to me... Ack! He's doing it again!)\nAfter clearing \"Ema\" Talk option in Plaza of Devotion:\nMay 10Inner Sanctum\nPhoenix:\nBrrrr... I-It's really high up, and really, really c-c-cold. What did I do to deserve this? At least I made it. I'd better get started while I can still feel my fingers. (...Hm? Who's that? It kind of looks like...)\nExamine\nRayfa Padma Khura'in\nLeads to:\n\"Umm... excuse me.\"\nAny other point of interest\nPhoenix:\n(.........Hmm. I should probably at least say hi to her before I start my investigation... Not that I want to, but...)\nPhoenix:\nUmm... excuse me.\nRayfa:\nAh! It's you...! Do you even know where you are, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nOf course, I do. May I ask why you're here, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nI came to pray for the high priest's soul. But what are YOU doing here? This is one of the most sacred spots in Khura'inism! Unscrupulous lawyers such as you have no business being here!\nPhoenix:\nBut I'm not \"unscrupulous\"...\nRayfa:\nQuiet! You dared to find fault with my Insights at every turn the other day!\nPhoenix:\n(She's STILL sore about that trial...?)\nExamine\nRayfa:\nHm? Why do you keep looking away?\nPhoenix:\nI was thinking about investigating the crime scene...\nRayfa:\nWell, you can do so later! You are speaking with me right now!\nPhoenix:\n(As you wish, Princess... I guess the investigation will have to wait until she's done talking at me.)\nMove\nPhoenix:\n(If I turn back now, I'll have to climb all the way back up here again later... *sigh* Guess I'll have to make Princess Rayfa see things my way somehow...)\nTalk\nInvestigating the incident\nPhoenix:\nAs you know, Your Benevolence, a murder has occurred, and I need to investigate--\nRayfa:\nBut we know the killer is one of your own!\nPhoenix:\nIn my country, suspects are innocent until proven guilty. Plus, she is a serious student of spirit channeling who came here to study. So, can't you at least give her a chance to explain what happened?\nRayfa:\nAll practitioners from overseas are big... big... phony baloneys! And her wish to train in the homeland of spirit channeling is but a bid for prestige.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. It seems like nothing I say will convince her otherwise, thanks to that last trial. Tweedledum and Tweedledee really did a number on her impression of foreigners.)\nThe defense (appears after \"Investigating the incident\")\nPhoenix:\nAs the defense attorney on this case... ...I really need to investigate this crime scene -- and I need to do it now. I've even been authorized by the police, so...\nRayfa:\n...What's this?! Y-You intend to make a mockery of our sacred Hall of Justice once more?\nPhoenix:\nN-No, I simply want to defend my client.\nRayfa:\nWhich means, you have come to forge evidence, then! I knew all lawyers were criminals! I must now redouble my vigilance!\nPhoenix:\nOuch, that's unfair. Who taught you to demonize a whole group of people anyway?\nRayfa:\nMy mother and father! Do you have an issue with their parental guidance?!\nPhoenix:\nN-No... I would never dare criticize the royal couple... (I still can't imagine what the lawyers here must've done to garner such hatred...)\nRayfa:\nHmmmmm ............... Oh, ho! Heh heh heh. I just had the most wonderful idea, Barbed Head.\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I have a bad feeling about that glint in her eye?)\nThe most wonderful idea (appears after \"The defense\")\nLeads to:\n\"So... what's this most wonderful idea of yours?\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nRayfa:\nHm?! What is that badge you bear?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a sunflower pin. They're quite popular in my country.\nRayfa:\nHmm... It IS rather cute, I must say.\nPhoenix:\nActually, it's just my attorney's badge.\nRayfa:\nOh? So you mean it would have actually been worth more as a cheap accessory?\nPhoenix:\nM-My profession is worth more than $1.20, you know.\nRites Guide\nRayfa:\nThat is a book from your land, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nYes, it's a guidebook about Khura'in that was written by people back home.\nRayfa:\nOh? So there are people in your land who know of our fair kingdom. Then I imagine it must say something about me in there, correct?\nPhoenix:\nActually, yes. It says the Dance of Devotion is performed by an adorable little princess...\nRayfa:\nH-How dare they write of me as though I were a child!\nPhoenix:\nHey, I'm just reading what it says... (Though, she does seem secretly pleased...)\nTahrust's Autopsy Report\nRayfa:\nWhat a dreadful way to die...\nPhoenix:\nDid you know the high priest, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nYes, he was a pious priest of Khura'inism. As such, he had the trust of the entire kingdom.\nPhoenix:\nThe entire kingdom...? Really?\nRayfa:\nYes. But what do you know of faith and trust? You, who can never hope to match his virtue. It is like comparing the moon to a pebble, or the sea to a puddle!\nPhoenix:\n(How did this suddenly become a game of \"Pin the Diss on the Lawyer\"?)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nA dahma for your thought?\nRayfa:\nUgh! Get that thing away from me!\nPhoenix:\nAll right, I'll just put it away, then.\nRayfa:\nWho told you to put it away? How am I to inspect it if you do that?!\nPhoenix:\n(Keep it out, put it away -- I wish she'd make up her mind...)\nPhoenix:\nSo... what's this most wonderful idea of yours?\nRayfa:\nIf you are to investigate this murder... ...then I shall oversee your every move, so as to prevent any misdeeds, naturally.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! You want to follow me around the entire time?!\nRayfa:\nOf course. Not that I want to, mind you. And I will not tolerate any objections, understood?!\nPhoenix:\nSh-She can't do this to me...\nRayfa:\nWhat was that, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nOh, n-no! It's nothing!\nRayfa:\nVery well, then. Let us get this investigation over with. We mustn't stay here in the Inner Sanctum a moment longer than necessary.\nPhoenix:\nP-Please don't rush me.\nRayfa:\nIt is not without reason that I insist on a speedy investigation, Barbed Head. I am a direct descendant of the Holy Mother, you see, who guides the people of Khura'in. As such, I must not sully myself with the blood of battle that Lady Kee'ra bears.\nPhoenix:\n(The blood of battle...?) If it's that big of a problem, why don't you head on down now? I won't do anything, I promise.\nRayfa:\nNo. Lawyers are never to be trusted! Now, make haste, so that we may leave here soon! ...Oh, and one more thing!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What now?\nRayfa:\nYour victory the other day was but a stroke of fortune! But this time, my Insights shall reveal the absolute truth! So brace yourself for a defeat most bitter, lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nI-I will. Now can I get on with my investigation?\nRayfa:\nAs long as you know where we stand.\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* I'd better hurry up and poke around for clues before she changes her mind...)\nExamine\nWall painting\nPhoenix:\nWhat an amazing wall painting! So this is Lady Kee'ra...\nRayfa:\nDo you see that red mark upon her brow? That is the character for death in Khura'inese. It is a mark of resolve to fight to the end. There are many different marks we make on our bodies, each with a different meaning.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, interesting... Come to think of it, you have marks on your face, Your Benevolence. So did the high priest. (Changed from [Come to think of it, Your Benevolence has marks on your face. So did the high priest.] in the original release)\nRayfa:\nThe high priest's marks are those of a monk, while mine are of a royal priestess. All members of the Khura'inist clergy have such marks upon them. The shape and location of the marks vary in accordance to conditions like status and age. And all records about them are kept at Tehm'pul Temple.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's kind of like a national ID registry, huh.\nTahrust's Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nIs that a weapon in her hand?\nRayfa:\nYes, it is Lady Kee'ra's dagger -- the very same one used in the rite. It is made to resemble a warbaa'd, the bird Lady Kee'ra fashioned herself after.\nPhoenix:\n(So that dagger is the weapon that took the high priest's life...)\nRayfa:\nIf you wish to know more about Lady Kee'ra, you need but ask.\nPhoenix:\n(I get the feeling she's going to be super relevant to this case... I should definitely ask the princess for more details later.)\nWall painting (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis wall painting really is amazing, no matter how many times I look at it.\nRayfa:\nDo you see that red mark upon her brow? That is the character for death in Khura'inese. It is a mark of resolve to fight to the end.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, interesting... Come to think of it, you have marks on your face, Your Benevolence. So did the high priest. (Changed from [Come to think of it, Your Benevolence has marks on your face.

The shape and location of the marks vary in accordance to conditions like status and age. And all records about them are kept at Tehm'pul Temple.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's kind of like a national ID registry, huh. Is that a weapon in her hand?\nRayfa:\nYes, it is Lady Kee'ra's dagger -- the very same one used in the rite. It is made to resemble a warbaa'd, the bird Lady Kee'ra fashioned herself after.\nPhoenix:\nSo that dagger was the murder weapon, huh...\nMountain face\nPhoenix:\n(This mountain face is like a towering wall. There are characters carved into it,  but I have no idea what they mean.)\nRayfa:\nThere is a prison at the apex of this mountain.\nPhoenix:\nA prison? Way up there?\nRayfa:\nIt is said that Lady Kee'ra laid those she defeated to rest atop this mountain... ...so that their souls would not spawn evil spirits.\nPhoenix:\nI'm feeling queasy just thinking about being all the way up there... (And the fact that it's a prison just makes it worse.)\nCurtain\nPhoenix:\nDuring the rite, the Inner Sanctum was fully enclosed by this ritual curtain... ...making this case something of a locked-room mystery.\nRitual Curtain added to the Court Record.\nRayfa:\nThe Purification Rite is akin to a bathing ritual for Lady Kee'ra. Therefore, it must be closed off from the outside world.\nPhoenix:\nOh, so the Inner Sanctum is like her private bathroom.\nRayfa:\nIndeed. So see to it that you keep it clean.\nPhoenix:\n(This flap in the center acts as the ritual curtain's door, but that's about it.) Eek!\nRayfa:\nAnd what was that shrill scream for just now?\nPhoenix:\nI-It's just... I'm afraid of heights. (I didn't notice it as I was climbing up, but now that I can see all the way down... *gulp*) I guess that flight of stairs from the Plaza of Devotion really is the only way up or down...\nCurtain (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDuring the rite, the Inner Sanctum was fully enclosed by this ritual curtain... ...making this case something of a locked-room mystery.\nRayfa:\nThe Purification Rite is akin to a bathing ritual for Lady Kee'ra. Therefore, it must be closed off from the outside world.\nPhoenix:\nOh, so the Inner Sanctum is like her private bathroom.\nRayfa:\nIndeed. So see to it that you keep it clean.\nFront of bird statue or spring\nPhoenix:\nLet's take a closer look, shall we?\nBird statue\nPhoenix:\nWhoa! (Th-This is blood!)\nRayfa:\n.........This is a statue of a warbaa'd, the bird on which Lady Kee'ra based her appearance.\nPhoenix:\nAnd all of this blood is from the high priest, huh...\nRayfa:\nHe no doubt embraced the statue in the hope that Lady Kee'ra would save him from death. May his soul rest in peace.\nPhoenix:\nConsidering the amount of blood, he must've been stabbed with considerable force. But there's no way Maya would be strong enough to deliver such a blow.\nSpring or body outline\nPhoenix:\nIt's been stained red by the high priest's blood.\nRayfa:\n\"The spring shall run red upon Lady Kee'ra's return.\"\nPhoenix:\nWhat's that from?\nRayfa:\n...An old legend.\nPhoenix:\n(Wait. Does that mean... ...that the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra in the newspaper is the real deal? ...Nah. That's crazy talk.)\nLady Kee'ra robe\nPhoenix:\nHey, isn't this Lady Kee'ra's robe?\nRayfa:\nO Holy Mother! Lady Kee'ra's robe is...!\nPhoenix:\nI know how you feel, but we should leave it as is to preserve the crime scene.\nRayfa:\nYou imbecile! This is the actual robe Lady Kee'ra once wore!\nPhoenix:\nI-It is?! What the heck is it made of? I mean, nothing should look this good after a few hundred years!\nRayfa:\n...............Enough! If I say it's the actual robe, it IS the actual robe! That foul murderer shall not get away with this!\nPhoenix:\n(It is tough to see a piece of history sloppily tossed on the ground like this, though... It even looks like it's been mended a number of times.) ...Hm? This robe kinda smells...\nRayfa:\nHow dare you insult such a sacred piece of clothing like that?!\nPhoenix:\nN-No, I meant that it smells like incense.\nRayfa:\n...Oh, I see. The scent you detected is from the sacred incense used to purify Lady Kee'ra's robe. Whenever a rite is to be performed, the robe is first scented with sacred incense.\nPhoenix:\n(If this still smells like incense now... ...the scent must have been much stronger last night when the victim was killed.)\nBloody paper\nPhoenix:\nA bloodstained scrap of paper... Looks like some kind of note or letter, perhaps? But it's written in Khura'inese, so I can't read a lick.\nRayfa:\nLet me see that. \".........once the flame is lit, then......... ...........................will be...\" This is simply impossible to read! ...Wait!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?!\nRayfa:\nThis stamp in the lower right! It's the mark of those insurgents -- the Defiant Dragons!\nPhoenix:\nThe rebel group?! (What's it doing here? Is there some kind of a connection between the high priest and the rebels?)\nBloodstained Letter added to the Court Record.\nAfter examining bird statue, spring or body outline, Lady Kee'ra robe, and bloody paper:\nPhoenix:\nLooke like that about does it for this area.\nLeft side of bird statue\nPhoenix:\nIt's a statue of a bird... Guess I'll take a closer look at it.\nStatue's missing eye\nPhoenix:\nLook, the bird's missing its eye. I feel sorry for the poor fella.\nRayfa:\nAre you the one who took it?!\nPhoenix:\nOf course not!\nRayfa:\nHmph. This statue has been here for ages. I suppose some damage is to be expected. I shall ask my mother to have it repaired.\nPhoenix:\n(No wonder there are no lawyers left. I'd leave, too, if I were always treated like this.) I don't think I'll find anything else of interest around here.\nStatue's missing eye (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nLook, the bird's missing its eye. I feel sorry for the poor fella.\nRayfa:\nAre you the one who took it?!\nPhoenix:\nOf course not!\nRayfa:\nHmph. This statue has been here for ages. I suppose some damage is to be expected. I shall ask my mother to have it repaired.\nPhoenix:\n(No wonder there are no lawyers left. I'd leave, too, if I were always treated like this.)\nSnowdrift or broken lantern\nPhoenix:\nI think I'd better go take a closer look.\nGap in snowdrift\nPhoenix:\nThere's no snow here. Maybe it was removed because it would interfere with the rite?\nRayfa:\nThe day before the rite, the temperature in this area plunged below freezing. Even the Plaza of Devotion was covered in a layer of white frost.\nPhoenix:\nMust be the elevation. It wasn't all that cold back in town, as I recall.\nBroken lantern\nPhoenix:\nThis lantern is damaged. (The wind guard is completely broken.)\nRayfa:\n...Damaged? Was this your doing?!\nPhoenix:\nN-N-No! I didn't even touch it!\nRayfa:\nHmph! Then perhaps a falling rock struck it. I will request that it be repaired when we are finished here. Of course, I doubt you will live long enough to see it restored.\nPhoenix:\nI-I'll be back to take a look! You'll see!\nAfter examining gap in snowdrift and broken lantern:\nPhoenix:\n(The snow has obviously been cleared away here, and the lantern is broken. I still have that camera I brought to take pictures of my trip. I should snap one of this area here just in case.)\nInner Sanctum Photo added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(Nothing else particularly interesting here.)\nAny intact lantern\nPhoenix:\nIt's a lantern. ...Hm? And it's still lit.\nRayfa:\nOf course it is. The sacred flames in the four lanterns here have burned for centuries. Anyone who extinguishes even one of them would be put to death immediately.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's why they're outfitted with glass wind guards. Still, I'd better keep my distance... Just in case.) So the moon and these lanterns were the only sources of light up here that night?\nRayfa:\nThe rite is performed by the light of the full moon because moonlight is a purifying force.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nRayfa:\nNo touching!\nPhoenix:\nI-I wasn't going to!\nStone slab\nPhoenix:\nThis rock must've fallen from higher up on the mountain. It's like the perfect perch for taking a peek over that curtain... Well, up I go! Wow, what an incredible view! It almost... boggles the mind...\nRayfa:\nGet down from there this instant!\nPhoenix:\nR-Right! Sorry! I'll be right down. (It looks like the Inner Sanctum is just slightly higher up than the top of that mountain.) ...I guess that confirms that the stairs from the Plaza of Devotion is the only way up here.\nStitched prayer flags\nPhoenix:\nHm? There's something hanging off of the ritual curtain there... These look like those prayer flags down at the Plaza of Devotion.\nRayfa:\nExcept, they are arranged like no prayer flags I have ever seen.\nPhoenix:\nHow so?\nRayfa:\nAll of these flags have been sewn together.\nPhoenix:\nHey, you're right. It's like they're one big banner now.\nRayfa:\nThere is something written on a piece of it... \"Donated by Tahrust Inmee\"... It seems this piece is from a donation Abbot Inmee made at some point.\nSanctum Prayer Flags added to the Court Record.\nStitched prayer flags (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nHm? There's something hanging off of the ritual curtain there... These look like those prayer flags down at the Plaza of Devotion.\nRayfa:\nExcept, they are arranged like no prayer flags I have ever seen.\nPhoenix:\nHow so?\nRayfa:\nAll of these flags have been sewn together.\nPhoenix:\nHey, you're right. It's like they're one big banner now.\nRayfa:\nThere is something written on a piece of it... \"Donated by Tahrust Inmee\"... It seems this piece is from a donation Abbot Inmee made at some point.\nBack of broken lantern\nPhoenix:\nThat lantern looks broken, but it's hard to make out the details from this angle. I'll take a closer look when I'm in a better spot.\nTalk\nInner Sanctum\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about this place, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\n...I have nothing to say to you, lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nIs that because you don't actually know much about it...?\nRayfa:\nYou ill-mannered--! I am the crown princess of Khura'in! There is nothing I do not know! ...Nayna!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoa! Where'd she come from?!) ...Hey! No cheating!\nRayfa:\nSilence, Barbed Head! Nayna's knowledge is my knowledge. End of discussion.\nPhoenix:\n(What is she, your pocket internet?)\nRayfa:\nThis spring is where Lady Kee'ra came to cleanse her body of the blood of battle. And today's Purification Rite is a ceremony that traces its origins back to those days. Cleansing Lady Kee'ra's robe in this sacred water lends one courage for the next battle.\nPhoenix:\nI-I see. Thank you for that excellent explanation.\nRayfa:\nCommoners are normally barred from here, except for the day of the rite.\nPhoenix:\nWho normally controls the access to this place?\nRayfa:\nThe high priest and his family are responsible for that.\nPhoenix:\nThe high priest and his family, huh...\nThe high priest's family (appears after \"Inner Sanctum\")\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about the high priest and his family?\nRayfa:\nAbbot Inmee lived with his wife and his disciple, Acolyte Puhray Zeh'lot... ...a young man the couple took into their home upon finding him near our kingdom's border.\nPhoenix:\nSpeaking of his wife, isn't she the one who usually plays the role of Lady Kee'ra?\nRayfa:\nYes, but as she is with child, the role was appointed to someone else. The killer no doubt offered to stand in, as she saw it as a chance to slay the high priest.\nPhoenix:\nNo, you have it backwards. He was the one who asked Maya to stand in.\nRayfa:\nThen that braggart must have embellished her qualifications.\nPhoenix:\nI'm really not sure how she could. Besides, why didn't you stand in for the high priest's wife, then?\nRayfa:\nDid I not tell you before? As a direct descendant of the Holy Mother, the role of Lady Kee'ra is forbidden to me. For those descended of Her Holiness must not defile their bodies with the blood of battle.\nPhoenix:\nOh, yeah... You did say that, didn't you? (I should probably talk with the high priest's wife and Acolyte Zeh'lot later, too.)\nLady Kee'ra (appears after examining wall painting)\nPhoenix:\nUm, so could you tell me more about this Lady Kee'ra?\nRayfa:\nAs an outsider I suppose your ignorance is all but unavoidable.\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever happened to \"you need but ask\"?!)\nRayfa:\nNayna! Lady Kee'ra was the Holy Mother's younger sister. But unlike her older sister, she lacked the ability to channel spirits. However, it is said that none could equal her skill with the dagger.\nPhoenix:\nA dagger? Well, this became relevant fast.\nRayfa:\nThe Holy Mother guides our souls, and Lady Kee'ra keeps the peace with her dagger. Lady Kee'ra was prepared to die for her people. She cloaked herself in a sacred battle robe, and concealed her face as her sister did.\nPhoenix:\nOkay, but who was she fighting against?\nRayfa:\nThroughout our history, we have been set upon by rebels... Now is no different. For our enemy now is the Defiant Dragons, led by that insurgent Dhurke.\nPhoenix:\nSo Lady Kee'ra played a role akin to the police, huh? So what's with the bird imagery?\nRayfa:\nLady Kee'ra's robe is fashioned in the likeness of a warbaa'd. It is a fearsome bird that is unique to Khura'in.\nPhoenix:\nI see... And what about the recent rebel hunter Lady Kee'ra? Who do you think she is?\nRayfa:\nI have heard about her, but I have yet to ascertain the truth. However, I believe her to be a vigilante -- or more precisely, a patriot.\nPhoenix:\n(So even Princess Rayfa doesn't know the true identity of the rebel hunter, huh?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining mountain face, curtain, bird statue, spring or body outline, Lady Kee'ra robe, bloody paper, statue's missing eye, gap in snowdrift, broken lantern, any intact lantern, stone slab, and stitched prayer flags:\nPhoenix:\n(That about does it for the Inner Sanctum... Hmm... I should probably head back to the Plaza of Devotion, and let Ema know I'm done. After all, she's the one putting her neck on the line for me to investigate this place.)\nDetention Center\nExamine\nBell\nPhoenix:\nThe guard will come over if I ring this, right?\nRayfa:\nHmph. I have no need for such an implement. .........Guard!\nGuard:\nYes, Your Benevolence?! It is my honor to be at your service!\nRayfa:\nNow, you try it, Barbed Head.\nPhoenix:\nOh, uh... Okay.... Um, Mr. Guard? Could I please speak with you?\nGuard:\n.........Tsk!\nRayfa:\nIt seems he will not respond to a lawyer's call.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I saw that coming a mile away.)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nRayfa:\nThe killer must have been the one they call Maya Fey. There can be no other.\nPhoenix:\nY-You never know. It's still pretty early in the investigation.\nRayfa:\nHmph. She has spent time in the company of lawyers, so she must have a wicked soul.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks for reminding me how much people like me are hated in this country...)\nRayfa:\nIt is only by the Holy Mother's mercy that you are allowed to investigate this sacred place. Remember that, and give thanks to Her Holiness for this great blessing at once!\nPhoenix:\nOh, um... Thank you, Your... Holy Motherness! (Er, that didn't come out right.)\nRayfa:\nThat seemed a little insincere. Shall we halt this investigation immediately?\nPhoenix:\nNo, wait! I'm grateful! Really!\nRayfa:\nHmm, I wonder...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... This is going to be worse than walking on holy eggshells.)\nWhat to do\nRayfa:\n...Well? Are you going to conduct your investigation or not?\nPhoenix:\nI will! I-It's just... are you going to keep following me around like this?\nRayfa:\nOf course! Unless you intend to do something you feel the need to hide?\nPhoenix:\nN-No! I do everything by the book!\nRayfa:\nThen get on with it. I am not doing this for fun, you know. I, too, have many duties I need to attend to.\nPhoenix:\n(Then why don't you go do them instead of hovering over me?)\nRayfa:\nHm? What is that look you are giving me? Am I perhaps, being bothersome?\nPhoenix:\nN-No, don't be absurd! (You're being INCREDIBLY bothersome...)\nMay 10Plaza of Devotion\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... They're STILL praying!)\nRayfa:\nThe religious devotion of our people is the pride of our kingdom. Come what may, they will continue to pray until tomorrow afternoon.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I will say this: This level of devotion is certainly to be respected...) Now, to find Ema.\n???:\nYou there! Wait. I want to ask ya something.\nPhoenix:\nO-Okay...\n???:\nDo ya know me? And do I know you?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I-I'm Phoenix. Phoenix Wright. I'm a lawyer.\n???:\nNo, no...! I wanna know if ya know who I am!\nPhoenix:\nH-Huh? How should I know? I've never even seen you before. (This guy's acting really strange. I wonder if he has amnesia or something? I should talk to him a little more, just in case he's connected to this case somehow.)\nTalk\nWho are you?\nLeads to:\n\"Um, are you having trouble remembering who you are?\"\nPresent\nAnything\n???:\nAh! M-My head...!\nPhoenix:\nA-Are you okay? (Did he remember something?!)\n???:\n...My head... is so itchy! Har har har har har har!\nPhoenix:\n(What is with this guy...?)\nPhoenix:\nUm, are you having trouble remembering who you are? Ack! I-I'm sorry if I offended you! (Whew! I thought he was going to pull a weapon on me! But he's just pulling some snack out one after another.)\n???:\nI'm trying to remember what I'm supposed to do. I know it's something important...\nRayfa:\nDo you know this man or something, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nNo! I just said I've never seen him before, didn't I?!\n???:\n...Are you Lady Kee'ra?\nRayfa:\nYou know of Lady Kee'ra? Then you are Khura'inese, I take it?\n???:\n*chomp, chomp*... Maybe...?\nPhoenix:\n(Wait... Are those LIZARDS he's eating?!)\n???:\nWhat? Ya want one?\nPhoenix:\nN-No thanks! I, uh... I just ate!\n???:\nAh, now I remember! Get a load of this! ...Well?\nPhoenix:\n.........W-Well, what?\nRayfa:\n...I believe he suffers from a far more serious malady than mere memory loss.\n???:\n...No good, huh? Guess I'll try somebody else!\nRayfa:\nSo, who was that man, and what did he want, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nI wish I knew.\n???:\nHey! Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nAck! What now?!\nEma:\nWhat's wrong? I didn't surprise you THAT badly, did I?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, it's nothing. Actually, I've been looking for you. I wanted to tell you I investigated the crime scene. I hope it wasn't too much trouble getting my investigation of the Inner Sanctum approved.\nEma:\nOh, it was fine. Prosecutor Sahdmadhi gave his okay straight away.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, he seems like a rather fair-minded prosecutor.)\nEma:\nHe said that you would probably give up once you saw the crime scene for yourself. ...And that moving on before the trial began would be the smart thing to do.\nPhoenix:\n(.........He must be feeling really confident about his case.) Well, just so you know, I have no intention of giving up.\nEma:\nI figured! That's why I've prepared a little gift for you! I thought it might help your investigation. Here, it's all yours! I wanted to bring you a bunch of other forensic tools... ...but they were confiscated at the airport.\nPhoenix:\n(Luminol testing fluid... This actually might come in handy.)\nEma:\nAlso, I made a copy of the crime scene photo for you!\nPhoenix:\nThanks. All of this will definitely come in handy. (So this is what the high priest's body looked like after the murder... I'll keep this along with the picture I took at the crime scene.)\nInner Sanctum Photo updated in the Court Record.\nEma:\nOh, yeah! They're done questioning Maya.\nPhoenix:\nReally? I should go pay her a visit, then! (Poor Maya. She must be feeling pretty lonely. I should let her know that I'll be defending her, too.)\nEma:\nOh, shoot! Look at the time! I have to get going.\nPhoenix:\nYou sure seem busy.\nEma:\nThat's because His Ephemeral Holiness is a real slave driver.\nPhoenix:\n\"His Ephemeral Holiness\"...?\nEma:\nProsecutor Sahdmadhi. He's like the world's hardest riddle, wrapped in a flowy sash. I keep wondering if it's just a clash-of-cultures type of thing, you know? Like, he'll ask the most insane things of me without batting a single, long eyelash of his!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, this Prosecutor Sahdmadhi sounds like he's used to holding some serious clout...)\nEma:\nArgh! Why do I have such bad luck with prosecutors! First it was the glimmerous fop. And now that I'm finally rid of that grating, bling-loving Europhile, I get this guy! Oh, no! Now I'm really going to be late! He'll probably make me listen to one of those really long sutras again. I'll see you later!\nPhoenix:\n(He makes her listen to sutras? Sounds like Ema's got it pretty rough, too...)\nRayfa:\nShe does not appreciate Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's sutras? What ingratitude. It appears that she, too, is lacking in religious devotion.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that's what the problem is here. Besides, Ema's not even a Khura'inist.)\nExamine\nGate\nRayfa:\n...To think I would witness a lawyer being allowed to pass through this sacred gate.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well, I wouldn't unless I had to. Those stairs were brutal to climb...\nRayfa:\nWhat's this?! Do you even know how many monks would give their lives to pass through that gate?! Be thankful for the great honor you have been afforded!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Benevolence!\nPraying people\nPhoenix:\nThey're still praying? Now that's really something!\nRayfa:\nIt's called \"their absolute devotion to Lady Kee'ra.\"\nPhoenix:\nBut you don't have to pray to her, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nOur customs dictate that I must never associate myself with Lady Kee'ra in any way. Instead, it is my duty to offer my prayers and dance to the Holy Mother every day. Why don't you try offering up a dance or two? I think you'll find it quite uplifting.\nPhoenix:\nN-No thanks! I'm good!\nPuhray Zeh'lot\nPhoenix:\nAcolyte Zeh'lot is still focused on his prayers.\nRayfa:\nIs not such devotion worthy of commendation? Still, he has not yet learned of the high priest's death. When I think of how he will learn of it once his prayers are over...\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, it does seem cruel, doesn't it?\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nRayfa:\nThat man we just met... He seemed quite suspicious to me. Don't tell me he is an acquaintance of yours?\nPhoenix:\nNot everyone who's suspicious is friends with a lawyer, or vice versa, you know. For example, I have many upstanding friends and acquaintances, like a chief prosecutor.\nRayfa:\nWell, as long as your friends are free from the taint of corruption.\nPhoenix:\nThey are! (And not everything is about good and evil!)\nWhat to do\nRayfa:\nAre you going to speak with that woman?\nPhoenix:\nIf you mean Maya, then yes. There's something I need to talk to her about.\nRayfa:\nSomething like... a jailbreak?!\nPhoenix:\nAnd how exactly could we do that with you and a guard watching us like hawks?\nMay 10Detention Center\nMaya:\nNick! I knew you'd come!\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... She sure looks tired.) How are you holding up?\nMaya:\nIt wasn't me... But no one will believe me. Nngh...\nPhoenix:\nI have to admit, I'm still a bit in shock. Who'd have thought you'd get caught up in something like this? And so far from home? But I'm going to defend you, so hang in there. We can do this if we work together.\nMaya:\n.............................. Nngh... This is all my fault. I mean, you came to Khura'in just to visit me. We hadn't seen each other in ages, and then, this happens.\nPhoenix:\n(I haven't seen her this down in ages, either.) Come on! Remember who you're talking to. Besides, I'd thought you'd be used to being the usual suspect by now!\nMaya:\n! Ha ha ha... I guess you're right. And you've saved me each and every time.\nPhoenix:\nYup, so just tell me everything you can and let's go from there.\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head! Stop stalling and go straight to the matter of true import! We know she is the murderer! Therefore, it is time for her confession!\nMaya:\nY-Your Benevolence... What brings the royal priestess to a place like this?\nRayfa:\nI am watching over this lawyer to keep him from tampering with anything in this case. Now, out with it! Confess to your crime!\nPhoenix:\nP-Please, Your Benevolence. Could you please take it down a notch or three...?\nRayfa:\nHmph!\nPhoenix:\nMaya, please tell me what you can. I know this must be difficult, but anything you can remember might help.\nMaya:\nS-Sure, okay...\nTalk\nThe incident\nMaya:\nI didn't kill the high priest. I wouldn't even dream of it... I mean, he always treated me so well. Abbot Inmee was an important figure with a ton of duties, including training acolytes. He was really kind, even to a foreigner like me. He even invited me over to his house whenever I was between training sessions. How could I ever kill someone like that?!\nPhoenix:\nHe sounds like a really good person. (I think I would've liked him.)\nMaya:\nIt was so much fun. I got to enjoy meals with his family and everything. And his wife was a master of Khura'inese cuisine! I've never eaten better in my life!\nPhoenix:\n(It's like they were her family, and home away from home in this foreign land. They must've been a source of comfort, what with being here for training all alone.)\nMaya:\n........................... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut what?\nMaya:\n...I can't completely deny the charge, either.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?!\nRayfa:\nAs I suspected! The snake has shown her true colors at last!\nPhoenix:\nYour Benevolence, please! I'm trying to figure out what really happened here.\nRayfa:\nNngh... Hmph!\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do mean, you can't completely deny the charge?\nMaya:\nW-Well... during the Purification Rite... ...I suddenly got really, really sleepy. The next thing I knew, Abbot Inmee was... you know...\nPhoenix:\nYou suddenly got sleepy? So then, you didn't actually see the high priest get murdered?\nMaya:\nNo, I didn't, but... ...if I was possessed by some crazed spirit while I was asleep... then...\nRayfa:\nWhat an excuse. How dare you pin your crime on another person's soul?!\nMaya:\nNngh...\nRayfa:\nHmph. Be honest: What you call \"training\" is but an extended vacation in reality. And that \"training\" here is simply for prestige.\nMaya:\nN-No! It's not like that at all!\nTraining (appears after \"The incident\")\nMaya:\nI'm training to become the master of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nRayfa:\nHmph. A neophyte practitioner such as you become a channeling master? I think not. The spiritual power required is beyond the means of an outsider like you.\nPhoenix:\n(Rayfa seems to really hate fakers... ...but Maya does actually have the power to channel spirits. I should let Rayfa know.) Your Benevolence. I wouldn't call Maya a neophyte, because... ...she can already cha--\nMaya:\nAhhh! Wait, wait, wait, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?!\nMaya:\nUmm... Can I talk to you for a second?\nPhoenix:\n(Why is she whispering all of a sudden?)\nMaya:\nI want to keep my spirit channeling ability a secret while I'm here, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Why?\nMaya:\nI'll, um... explain later. Just, keep it a secret for now, okay?!\nPhoenix:\nIf you say so... (What's that all about?)\nRayfa:\nWhat is all that whispering about over there?!\nPhoenix:\nOh, i-it's nothing, really. (I'll have to ask about this later when Princess Rayfa's not around.)\nMaya:\nOh, I almost forgot! Nick...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMaya:\nAbout Abbot Inmee's murder... There was something I noticed that I thought strange...\nPhoenix:\nOh...?\nWhat you noticed (appears after \"Training\")\nPhoenix:\nSo, what was it you noticed?\nMaya:\nWell... ...you probably won't believe me, but....\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you let me be the judge of that.\nMaya:\nOkay... So, you know that spring?\nPhoenix:\nThe spring? You mean the pool in front of the warbaa'd statue?\nMaya:\nYes, that! The water in there... was dark red!\nPhoenix:\n............\nMaya:\nAnd when I say \"dark\" red, I mean \"blood\" red!\nPhoenix:\nOh, that? Yeah, I saw it, too.\nMaya:\nYou did?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. The high priest's blood turned it red.\nMaya:\nWhat? No, that's not what I meant! The spring was red before he was killed.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What? Wait, so it was already red? Even before the high priest was killed?\nMaya:\nYeah. I noticed it during the the Purification Rite -- just before I passed out. It's just like the ancient legend says...\nPhoenix:\nWhat \"ancient legend\"?\nMaya:\n\"The spring shall run red upon Lady Kee'ra's return.\" That's how it goes, anyway.\nRayfa:\nHold on! Yes, there is a legend about the Inner Sanctum that says just that. But the water runs red this time thanks to the murder. The police investigation confirmed it. Perhaps your eyes were deceived by the lantern light reflecting off of the water.\nMaya:\nI-I don't think that was it, though...\nPhoenix:\nAn ancient legend, huh...? I wonder if it's connected to this murder, somehow.\nMaya's Statement added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\n........................ Um, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMaya:\nSo... Uhh... Actually, there's one more thing...\nRayfa:\n?\nPhoenix:\n(What's up with Maya? She keeps looking over at Her Benevolence, like she's worried what Rayfa will think.)\nWhat you noticed (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo, what was it you noticed?\nMaya:\nWell... ...you probably won't believe me, but....\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you let me be the judge of that.\nMaya:\nOkay... So, you know that spring?\nPhoenix:\nThe spring? You mean the pool in front of the warbaa'd statue?\nMaya:\nYes, that! The water in there... was dark red!\nPhoenix:\n............\nMaya:\nAnd when I say \"dark\" red, I mean \"blood\" red!\nPhoenix:\nOh, that? Yeah, I saw it, too.\nMaya:\nYou did?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. The high priest's blood turned it red.\nMaya:\nWhat? No, that's not what I meant! The spring was red before he was killed.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What? Wait, so it was already red? Even before the high priest was killed?\nMaya:\nYeah. I noticed it during the the Purification Rite -- just before I passed out. It's just like the ancient legend says...\nPhoenix:\nWhat \"ancient legend\"?\nMaya:\n\"The spring shall run red upon Lady Kee'ra's return.\" That's how it goes, anyway.\nRayfa:\nHold on! Yes, there is a legend about the Inner Sanctum that says just that. But the water runs red this time thanks to the murder. The police investigation confirmed it. Perhaps your eyes were deceived by the lantern light reflecting off of the water.\nMaya:\nI-I don't think that was it, though...\nPhoenix:\nAn ancient legend, huh...? I wonder if it's connected to this murder, somehow.\nMaya:\n........................ Um, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMaya:\nSo... Uhh... Actually, there's one more thing...\nRayfa:\n?\nPhoenix:\n(What's up with Maya? She keeps looking over at Her Benevolence, like she's worried what Rayfa will think.)\nOne more thing (appears after \"What you noticed\")\nMaya:\nThere's... There's something I want to show you.\nPhoenix:\nThere is?\nMaya:\nI found this at the Inner Sanctum after I came to.\nPhoenix:\nIs this... a letter? (It's in Khura'inese...)\nMaya:\nSee that stamp on the far left, at the end of the letter? Does it look familiar?\nPhoenix:\n(This red stamp here?)\nMaya:\nThat's the mark of Lady Kee'ra.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, right. It looks just like the mark on her forehead.)\nRayfa:\nL-Lady Kee'ra, you say?! Let me see that! ............... Wh-Why, this is...!\nPhoenix:\nWhat? What does it say?\nRayfa:\n...............\nMaya:\n\"Do not perform the rite. I know what you are planning. --Lady Kee'ra\"\nPhoenix:\nThat sounds like a threat -- or a warning! Whoever's pretending to be Lady Kee'ra was pressuring the high priest to stop the rite!\nMaya:\nYeah, that's what it looks like to me, too. Nick, do you think...\nPhoenix:\nWait, wait, wait, wait, wait! First, there's that ancient legend.\nMaya:\n\"The spring shall run red upon Lady Kee'ra's return.\"\nPhoenix:\nNow, there's also Lady Kee'ra's warning. Plus, with the Warbaa'd Dagger being eyed as the murder weapon... D-Don't tell me...!\nMaya:\nThat's why she HAS to be the real deal! It gives me chills just thinking about it! I bet Lady Kee'ra's spirit possessed the sacred robe or something!\nPhoenix:\nDon't tell me... ...you actually believe that the real Lady Kee'ra returned to kill the high priest?\nMaya:\n..................... Don't be silly, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nHistorical figures don't come back to life. I mean, give me a break.\nPhoenix:\nB-B-But! You were saying only yesterday, how it was more fun to believe that she's the real deal.\nMaya:\nYeah, YESTERDAY! I wish I could keep on entertaining that fantasy, too... ...but the fact is, we're dealing with a murder here! Thus, my days of dreaming have come to an end.\nPhoenix:\n........................\nMaya:\nI'm going to keep it real from now on. And you should, too, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(I thought you said I was the boring one because I was \"keeping it real\"...?)\nMaya:\nSorry, I guess I've outgrown that stepladder argument we always have...\nPhoenix:\nI think you mean \"ladder,\" Maya.\n\"Keeping it real\" (appears after \"One more thing\")\nLeads to:\n\"So, what do you mean by \"keeping it real\"?\"\nPresent\nTahrust's Autopsy Report or Inner Sanctum Photo\nMaya:\nI didn't kill the high priest! I swear!\nPhoenix:\nOf course you didn't.\nRayfa:\nAnd why should I believe the words of an accused?\nMaya:\nBut I really didn't kill him! And if you don't believe me, then prepare to get an earful! ...From Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! Keep me out of this!\nAnything else\nMaya:\nThere you go, presenting things left and right again, as always! Sure takes me back to the good old days! Ooh, ooh! Present something else, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh,  if that's what you really want...? At least it seemed to cheer her up a bit.)\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you mean by \"keeping it real\"?\nMaya:\nOh, umm... So you know how someone is dressing up like Lady Kee'ra and capturing rebels, right?\nPhoenix:\nOh, you mean the rebel-hunter Lady Kee'ra in the papers?\nMaya:\nYeah, that one. I think that's who probably sent this warning.\nRayfa:\nWhat nonsense is this?! You dare to suggest... ...that Abbot Inmee was slain by Lady Kee'ra?! You... Youuu... nincompoop!\nMaya:\nEek!\nRayfa:\nThe rebel hunter is sure to be a vigilante who loves this kingdom. And it is that patriotism that led them to cloak their identity in the guise of Lady Kee'ra. Such a patriot... would NEVER slay the high priest!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it's only natural for Princess Rayfa to see it that way, but I can't let it go at that...)\nRayfa:\nBesides, why would such a vigilante want to stop the Purification Rite in the first place?\nPhoenix:\n...I haven't figured that one out yet.\nRayfa:\nI rest my case!\nPhoenix:\n(Still, if this rebel hunter had a compelling enough reason... ...they might've killed the high priest after he ignored their warning.)\nRayfa:\nY-You... big dummy! You can't fool me! It was you who forged that warning letter! You are trying to shed your guilt onto our most sacred Lady Kee'ra! Admit it!\nMaya:\nN-No! I'd never do such a thing!\nPhoenix:\nNow, now, Your Benevolence. Let's try to remain rational about this...\nRayfa:\nGrrrrrrr...\nPhoenix:\nMaya, did you show that letter to the police?\nMaya:\nUmm... no. I was afraid that it would anger everybody needlessly. So I was waiting to show it to you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(And judging by Her Benevolence's reaction, I'd say Maya was right to be worried. ...Hm? Wait, what are... There are a number of places on this letter where there are three holes in a row. ...Are these supposed to be some sort of a message, too? Not that we'll be finding out any time soon, I suspect...)\nLady Kee'ra's Warning added to the Court Record.\nGuard:\nAll right, accused. Wrap it up.\nMaya:\nI guess they have more questions for me...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... At least I have a better idea of what we're up against now.\nMaya:\nUm, Nick...? There's something I've been meaning to say. I... don't need a lawyer this time.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you talking about?!\nMaya:\nIt's just, you know they have that Defense Culpability Act here in Khura'in, right? Well, if I'm found guilty... you'll be charged with abetting a criminal.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... Thanks for thinking of me, but...) Don't worry, Maya. We'll pull through this together somehow. We always have, haven't we?\nMaya:\nYeah... But we're not in Kansas anymore, you know?\nPhoenix:\nTrue, but I've been through one trial here already. So I know what I'm getting myself into. We're going to win this one, no matter what. Because I believe in your innocence.\nMaya:\n! Yeah, I know... We've always won because of your faith in me.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. So, it's \"All Aboard the Phoenix Freedom Express!\"\nMaya:\n...Thank you, Nick. Well, I'll see you later.\nRayfa:\nBravado will not save you tomorrow, and by then, it will be too late to ask for mercy.\nPhoenix:\n...We're going to beat this charge. You'll see.\nRayfa:\nHmph. I don't care to understand every single word that was spoken... ...but I don't like the sound of that \"Phoenix Freedom Express\" one bit.\nPhoenix:\nWait... Don't tell me you don't know what \"Freedom Express\" refers to?\nRayfa:\nAugh! Of course I know! D-Do not presume to know what I do not know! ........................\nPhoenix:\n(I'm no closer to understanding why someone would want the high priest dead... ...but given the use of the Warbaa'd Dagger and the existence of the warning letter... ...I'd say the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra is the real prime suspect. It might help if I knew a little more about this modern-day Lady Kee'ra. I wonder if anyone has any info on them... Hmm... Maybe the first thing I should do is to go someplace where locals like to gather.)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nRayfa:\nThat woman you call Maya Fey is not to be trusted. I hear she is already twenty-eight, and yet, she is still as antsy as a maiden in her teens. Surely, she must be hiding something!\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, that's... just Maya being Maya.)\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSo, what next?\nRayfa:\nHmm, let me think... Oh, I know!\nPhoenix:\nD-Dare I ask...\nRayfa:\nAdmit the accused's guilt, so we can go straight to the inevitable guilty verdict! That will solve everything!\nPhoenix:\nWhy did I even ask...? I think I'll just keep on investigating.\nPresent\nLady Kee'ra's Warning\nRayfa:\nWhy is that warning letter comprised of paper cutouts?\nPhoenix:\nProbably because the author wanted to hide their identity. It's not a common technique these days, what with the spread of computers and printers.\nRayfa:\nW-We have such modern conveniences here in Khura'in, too!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sure you do. (Not that I've ever actually seen any of them.)\nMay 10Khura'in - Bazaar\nPhoenix:\nI guess the bazaar is as good a place to start as any. Now, who should I... ...Hm?\nRayfa:\nHmm, I see... So that is what a \"Freedom Express\" is...\nPhoenix:\n(Consulting her pocket internet again, I see...)\n???\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nThat sounds like...\nAhlbi:\nIs Miss Maya okay? I believe her, Mr. Wright. I know she didn't do it!\nRayfa:\n...Do you now, boy?\nAhlbi:\nP-Pohlkunkaaa! Y-Y-Your Benevolence!\nRayfa:\nYou mustn't trust in lawyers, you... Hm? Are you not the accused from the last trial?\nAhlbi:\nOh, u-um...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's wrong, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nY-Your... Your Benevolence speaks... with the... um...\nRayfa:\nYou may speak in the vernacular, little monk. Now, what is your name?\nAhlbi:\nY-Yes, Your Benevolence! Ahlbi Ur'gaid, Your Benevolence!\nRayfa:\nKnow this, Ahlbi: Your soul is only as clean or filthy as the company you keep.\nPhoenix:\n(I wish she'd stop insinuating that all lawyers are trash.)\nAhlbi:\nP-Please forgive me, Your Benevolence, but Mr. Wright is a very trustworthy man. A-And I... I trust him as a lawyer!\nRayfa:\n.........What's this?!\nAhlbi:\nI-I'm sorry! ...F-Forgive my insolence!\nRayfa:\nI-If a common boy such as he can place his trust in lawyers... ...it can only be because of my failure at the Hall of Justice the other day. Ooooooh...\nAhlbi:\nMr. Wright! Her Benevolence has sunken to the ground!\nPhoenix:\nShe must really feel responsible for what happened in court that day... Let's give her some breathing room for now. I'm sure she'll be back on her feet in no time. In the meantime, do you mind if I ask you some questions?\nAhlbi:\nOf course not! I'm always glad to help!\nExamine\nWarbaa'd\nAhlbi:\nAllow me to explain! This bird is known as a warbaa'd. It's only found here in Khura'in.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right -- the bird Lady Kee'ra based herself on. It's a really beautiful bird. Tourists must love it.\nAhlbi:\nThey usually do. There's just one thing about it that's kind of hit or miss. Its unusual cry drives children to tears. It can even make some adults collapse in fear...\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe they should keep such a fearsome creature in a less crowded area...)\nYak\nPhoenix:\nHey, Ahlbi, what's this cow-like animal?\nAhlbi:\nIt's a yak. They carry heavy loads and provide milk. They're indispensible partners in our daily lives.\nPhoenix:\nInteresting... Hey, they're kind of cute up-close!\nAhlbi:\nOh, and they are also prized for their meat. You know -- the meat you enjoyed so much last night.\nPhoenix:\nOh... (\"Partner\" must mean something else here.)\nProduce cart\nPhoenix:\nLook at all these vegetables...\nAhlbi:\nLet's see... There's giah'pam, konuuro, and zabaas. And they're all freshly picked this morning!\nPhoenix:\nI've never heard of any of them. Maybe I'll buy some to see what they taste like. You want some, too, Ahlbi? My treat.\nAhlbi:\nReally?! Thank you, sir! I'll take some of this, and this, oh, and this, too!\nPhoenix:\n.........Um, Ahlbi? That's quite a lot you've got there already, don't you think...?\nAhlbi:\nBut this is barely enough for a side dish!\nPhoenix:\n(I hope I brought enough money.)\nManhole\nPhoenix:\n(A manhole...? I guess they have a sewer system here in Khura'in. What am I thinking? Of course they do. That was ignorant of me...)\nPoster\nPhoenix:\n(It's a poster. It looks like some kind of Khura'inese superhero. Why do all superheroes look the same, regardless of where they come from?)\nSteaming buns\nAhlbi:\nThis is a really popular bun shop here in Khura'in!\nPhoenix:\nOoh, they even sell magatah'man. Let's see... \"1 magatah'man: 15 dahmas.\" ...Wait a second. Ahlbi, weren't you selling them for 20 dahmas apiece...?\nAhlbi:\nThe extra 5 dahmas is the service fee!\nPhoenix:\n(He's quite the shrewd businessman.)\nVertical sign\nPhoenix:\n(I can't read the sign, but this looks like a souvenir shop. It's too bad I don't have time to do some shopping right now... ...but I'll have to stop by here before I go back home. I'm sure everyone's expecting something... Especially Trucy.)\nGate or staircase\n(The gate to Tehm'pul Temple... And at the top of those stairs is my home away from home. Just looking at them is making my back ache.)\nMove\nPhoenix:\n(Rayfa's still sitting slumped on the ground. I can't leave her here like this... ...so I guess I should keep talking to Ahlbi until she recovers.)\nTalk\nThe rebel hunter\nPhoenix:\nSo what have you heard about the rebel hunter that was in the newspaper?\nAhlbi:\nEveryone's overjoyed at her appearance! They say she's the modern-day Lady Kee'ra!\nPhoenix:\n(So they're treating this rebel hunter like a mysterious protector of the people, huh.)\nAhlbi:\nPeople have been on edge recently, what with that jailbreak and stuff. I sure hope they catch that escaped prisoner soon!\nPhoenix:\nEscaped prisoner?\nAhlbi:\nYes, he was one of the vicious rebels that Lady Kee'ra had captured.\nPhoenix:\nSo there's a hardened criminal on the loose? That IS bad news.\nAhlbi:\nYes, but the modern-day Lady Kee'ra is also super amazing! I mean, she takes down big, scary rebels all by herself.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. That's not exactly something just anyone can do. (Someone that strong... ...could've easily overpowered and killed the high priest.) Hmm... And what about that escaped prisoner, Ahlbi?\nThe escaped prisoner (appears after \"The rebel hunter\")\nPhoenix:\nSo, what's the escaped prisoner supposed to be like?\nAhlbi:\nThey say he's a vicious fiend who serves as Dhurke's right-hand man.\nPhoenix:\nDhurke? As in the leader of that rebel group?\nAhlbi:\nYes! The escapee serves that dreadful master of the Defiant Dragons. They say the prisoner's a former soldier, and that he wields a big scary knife. Rumor has it, he's a cold-blooded killer to boot.\nPhoenix:\nHe sounds like a really dangerous man.\nAhlbi:\nHe is. But the police still can't find him, even after an exhaustive search!\nPhoenix:\n...Wait. (I remember hearing about a prison...)\nRayfa:\nThere is a prison at the apex of this mountain.\nPhoenix:\nA prison? Way up there?\nPhoenix:\nThe prison is at the top of the Inner Sanctum's mountain, right? How did he even break out?\nAhlbi:\nNo one really knows. He supposedly did it without any tools to speak of, too. Some say he must've fallen to his death. Personally, I'd like to believe he did... Otherwise, something like that terrible incident might happen again...\nPhoenix:\nTerrible incident...?\nThe terrible incident (appears after \"The escaped prisoner\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat was that about a \"terrible incident,\" Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nIt happened before I was even born, but... ...Queen Amara -- the previous queen -- was assassinated. And it was the rebel leader Dhurke who did it.\nPhoenix:\nThe previous queen was assassinated?! (That's kind of unsettling...)\nAhlbi:\nOoh... It was the terrible deed of a heinous sinner. I mean, to take the life of such a gentle queen?! Only someone with a dark, defiled soul could have done that.\nPhoenix:\n(They really take their queens seriously here. Like, god-worshipping level serious... It really would take someone pretty bold and blasphemous to assassinate one.)\nAhlbi:\nThose Defiant Dragon rebels are not afraid to do anything to accomplish their goals! That's why, with that escaped prisoner on the loose... ...who knows who might be killed next!\nPhoenix:\n(So that's why the people of Khura'in are so afraid of that escapee. And why they want the rebel hunter to take him out, along with the other rebels.) So, is there anything else you can tell me about the rebel hunter Lady Kee'ra, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nUmm, I was just thinking there was something else, but what was it...? Oh, yeah! Here!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nAhlbi:\nShah'do found it!\nRayfa:\nWhy that's... the Warbaa'd Arrow!\nPhoenix:\nFeeling better now, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nThis is no time to be feeling sorry for myself. For I am the crown princess of Khura'in! Now, let me see that, boy.\nAhlbi:\nY-Yes, Your Benevolence!\nRayfa:\nHmm... It looks very much like one of the legendary weapons Lady Kee'ra once used in battle.\nPhoenix:\nA three-pronged arrow? (I could swear I've seen something resembling that arrowhead recently...) Where did Shah'do find it, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nNear Abbot Inmee's house.\nPhoenix:\n(Near the victim's house, huh... Something tells me I'd better look into this.)\nWarbaa'd Arrow added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nAhlbi, can I ask you to take me to the high priest's house?\nAhlbi:\n...Y-Yes, of course!\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, he was married, wasn't he? And his wife is the one who usually plays the part of Lady Kee'ra in the Purification Rite. I should probably talk to her, too.)\nThe terrible incident (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nWhat was that about a \"terrible incident,\" Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nIt happened before I was even born, but... ...Queen Amara -- the previous queen -- was assassinated. And it was the rebel leader Dhurke who did it.\nPhoenix:\nThe previous queen was assassinated?! (That's kind of unsettling...)\nAhlbi:\nOoh... It was the terrible deed of a heinous sinner.

And why they want the rebel hunter to take him out, along with the other rebels.)\nPresent\nWarbaa'd Arrow\nPhoenix:\nSo, that bird over there is a warbaa'd, right?\nAhlbi:\nYes, but they're endangered now.\nPhoenix:\n...I wonder how many of them were killed to make this arrow.\nAhlbi:\nOh... Would you like me to explain, sir?\nPhoenix:\nN-No, that's okay.\nTehmpul Temple\nPresent\nWarbaa'd Arrow\nRayfa:\nThat is the Warbaa'd Arrow.\nPhoenix:\nI don't see the connection between this arrow and a warbaa'd, though.\nRayfa:\nThe feathers of a warbaa'd were used in its fletching. And its design was also inspired by the official bird of Khura'in.\nPhoenix:\nWow, you were able to explain all that without Nayna.\nRayfa:\nWhat did you just say?\nPhoenix:\nUm... N-Nothing! Never mind! (Why can't I ever keep my big mouth shut?!)\nAfter clearing \"The terrible incident\" Talk option in Khura'in - Bazaar:\nMay 10High Priest's House\nPhoenix:\n(So this is where the high priest lived. Wait a minute. This is where they brought me when my back gave out. And the woman in front of that altar... She must be the high priest's wife...)\nExamine\nWoman\nLeads to:\n\"Excuse me...\"\nAnywhere else\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Rayfa is glaring at me with a piercing look in her eyes. Guess it'd be rude to start poking around before saying hi to the high priest's wife...)\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me...\nBeh'leeb:\n...Yes? May I help you?\nPhoenix:\nI was hoping to speak with the high priest's wife. Are you her? (Changed from [I was hoping to speak with the high priest's wife. Are you she?] in the original release)\nRayfa:\nPlease forgive the intrusion, Lady Beh'leeb.\nBeh'leeb:\nOh, my... Y-Your Benevolence.\nRayfa:\nPlease, be at ease. What a terrible time this must be for you. I owe much to your husband. You have my deepest sympathies for your tragic loss.\nBeh'leeb:\nYou honor me with your kind words. Look dear, the royal priestess has come to visit us. Yes... Mm-hm. ...What's that? ...Oh, of course... hee hee.\nPhoenix:\n(Sh-She's talking with his funeral picture!)\nBeh'leeb:\nMy husband, too, is delighted that the royal priestess has graced us with her presence.\nRayfa:\nY-You can speak with Abbot Inmee?\nBeh'leeb:\nNo, I don't possess the power to speak with the dead. But I can feel his presence. ...What's that? No, that can wait till later, dear.\nPhoenix:\n(Sh-She's definitely speaking with him!)\nBeh'leeb:\n...So, Your Benevolence. What is it that brings you to my humble abode?\nRayfa:\nThis lawyer is investigating your husband's death. And I am watching him to ensure he does not tamper with any of the evidence.\nPhoenix:\nI know this must be difficult, but could I ask you some questions? A good friend of mine has fallen under suspicion, you see.\nBeh'leeb:\nA friend of yours...? So then, you must be Maya's friend from the States... correct?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right.\nBeh'leeb:\n...I'm sorry, but I'm still grieving. ...Isn't that right, dear? ...Yes, I know.\nRayfa:\nAbbot Inmee and his wife were one of the closest and most loving couples in Khura'in. If she is not ready to talk, I will not allow you to press her any further.\nPhoenix:\n(She did just lose the love of her life... It would be incredibly insensitive of me to force answers out of her right now. But I need to talk to her if I want to learn more about the high priest. Plus, there's the Warbaa'd Arrow that Ahlbi found near the house. There's too much I need to find out for me to leave just yet.) Um... Would it be okay if I stayed here for a little while?\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head! Have you not been listening to a word I said?!\nPhoenix:\nLook, Your Benevolence. I'm sorry for her loss, but I'm running out of time. So what I will do is promise to leave if she doesn't change her mind.\nBeh'leeb:\nPlease, let me talk to my husband about this. ...Yes. Mm-hm. I know... No, don't. Not in front of the royal priestess. Now, if you would excuse me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What the heck were they even talking about?)\nRayfa:\nYou have but poured salt on her wounds. This is precisely why you lawyers are so despised!\nPhoenix:\nUrk! (I was just trying to help Maya's case. I didn't mean to hurt Mrs. Inmee...)\nRayfa:\nCould it be that you actually possess a conscience?\nPhoenix:\nOf course I do! But I'm also desperate for information.\nRayfa:\n...So, what do you plan to do now?\nPhoenix:\nPass the time by looking around the room, I guess, and see if she changes her mind.\nRayfa:\nJust see that you do not touch anything you should not.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I should watch what I touch, then. Just in case Princess Rayfa gets mad at me...)\nExamine\nAltar\nPhoenix:\nWhat a magnificent altar.\nRayfa:\nOf course it is magnificent -- it is for the Holy Mother, after all.\nPhoenix:\nThe Holy Mother... Is she that faceless figure there?\nRayfa:\nSuch insolence! How do you not know who Her Holiness is on sight?! Do you seek to cross over into the Twilight Realm right this instant?\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry! It won't happen again!\nRayfa:\n...Hmph, this is why lawyers are so despised. Now listen well: Depicting Her Holiness's face is the greatest taboo in all of Khura'inism. There are none alive today who know what her face really looks like. And that includes the members of the royal family.\nPhoenix:\nWow, now there's an unusual custom... (It's gotta be one heck of a secret if even the royal family can't know what she looks like.)\nInner Sanctum poster\nPhoenix:\nA poster... of the mountains? Oh, the Inner Sanctum mountain is featured against those other towering peaks.\nRayfa:\nThose beautiful mountains are known as the \"Roof of Khura'in.\" Ah, and I see they have even included Mt. Poniponi in that poster.\nPhoenix:\nMt. Poniponi? (Is that the smaller peak to the left?)\nRayfa:\nKnown as the \"Little Sanctum,\" it is just west of the Inner Sanctum. Is it not also beautiful? But I suppose a lawyer with a defiled soul such as you could not perceive such beauty.\nPhoenix:\nN-No, that's not true! I think it's absolutely stunning!\nMountain Range Poster added to the Court Record.\nInner Sanctum poster (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nA poster... of the mountains? Oh, the Inner Sanctum mountain is featured against those other towering peaks.\nRayfa:\nThose beautiful mountains are known as the \"Roof of Khura'in.\" Ah, and I see they have even included Mt. Poniponi in that poster.\nPhoenix:\nMt. Poniponi? (Is that the smaller peak to the left?)\nRayfa:\nKnown as the \"Little Sanctum,\" it is just west of the Inner Sanctum. Is it not also beautiful? But I suppose a lawyer with a defiled soul such as you could not perceive such beauty.\nPhoenix:\nN-No, that's not true! I think it's absolutely stunning!\nOrb\nPhoenix:\nIs this... a piece of art of some sort?\nRayfa:\nWhat a beautiful orb. ...Hm?\nPhoenix:\nIs something the matter?\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head, take one step back!\nPhoenix:\nO-Okay... Done. Did you spot something?\nRayfa:\nYes, your dismal reflection. It was ruining the orb's beauty.\nPhoenix:\nD-Did you have to put it like that, Your Benevolence?\nTV\nPhoenix:\nWhat show is this?\nRayfa:\nIt is \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm.\" It is based on Lady Kee'ra and is the number-one action-hero show in Khura'in.\nPhoenix:\n\"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\"?\nRayfa:\nYes, it is an entirely original show created right here in our kingdom.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not so sure about its \"originality,\" given its overall look and that theme song...)\nRayfa:\nIs something the matter?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's just, we have an action-hero show back home that is really similar to this. (I'm guessing this show's why Maya is so into Lady Kee'ra... Honestly, the theme song is exactly the same as the one for Maya's favorite show... ...\"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.\" It's a popular action-hero series filmed right in LA. Set in a city known as Neo Olde Tokyo, it pits the Steel Samurai in mortal combat... ...against his nemesis, the Evil Magistrate. Maya's collected DVDs and merchandise from that series as long as I've known her.) The Plumed Punisher seems awfully similar to the Steel Samura--\nRayfa:\nThe Plumed Punisher originated HERE, in Khura'in. Is that clear, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Benevolence! (Note to self: Never suggest that again.)\nWastebasket\nPhoenix:\nThis looks like a wastebasket... Hey, there's an envelope sticking out. (Hmm... There are three holes in a row near the top. Now, where have I seen holes like these before?)\nRayfa:\nScrounging around in other people's garbage like some stray dog... You are a pitiful creature, indeed.\nPhoenix:\nUm... What does it say here? (Say what you will, but I've got a job to do!)\nRayfa:\nIt says, \"To the high priest.\" Hmph... You cannot even read? You are even more pitiful than I had thought.\nPhoenix:\nTh-Thanks. And I will keep your words of wisdom in mind, Your Benevolence. (Guess I should've studied some Khura'inese before I came...) So the envelope was addressed to the high priest, huh? ...But it's empty. Still, there's something about it... I'd better hang on to it.\nEnvelope added to the Court Record.\nWastebasket (subsequent times)\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head, it appears you are quite fond of rummaging through the garbage.\nPhoenix:\nI just thought there might be some other important piece of evidence in here.\nRayfa:\nOh, is that right? ..................\nPhoenix:\n...Look, I'm not doing this for fun! Really! (Doesn't look like there's anything else of interest in there.)\nSpiked cushion\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is this scary-looking spiky thing?\nRayfa:\nIt is a floor cushion for heightening a practitioner's mental focus. Your ignorance astounds me. There is not a soul in Khura'in who would not recognize this.\nPhoenix:\nA floor cushion? You mean you're supposed to sit on this?\nRayfa:\nHmph. How else would you suggest it be used?\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like a torture device to me.)\nWanted poster\nPhoenix:\nOh, it's a wanted poster for the rebel escapee everyone's talking about.\nRayfa:\nWhat? Let me see that. \"Datz Are'bal, senior member of insurgent leadership, and former paratrooper of a... ...foreign land. Wanted for crimes against the kingdom. Considered armed and dangerous.\"\nPhoenix:\n(So he's ex-military, huh...)\nRayfa:\nHis appearance alone exudes menace. He must be captured at once.\nWanted Poster added to the Court Record.\nRayfa:\n...Hm?\nPhoenix:\nIs something wrong?\nRayfa:\nThe bounty is three million dahmas -- money that comes out of the people's tax payments. I shall have it lowered to about one million dahmas.\nPhoenix:\n...You seem unexpectedly concerned with the people's welfare.\nRayfa:\n\"Unexpectedly\"? How rude! Nayna has always taught me that \"kingdoms that do not value its people come to ruin.\" As crown princess, it is only natural that I care for my people!\nPhoenix:\nHow about sending some of that kindness this way?\nRayfa:\nHmm... Well, I suppose I could... ...If you quit being a lawyer, and paid taxes to our kingdom, that is!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh well. It was worth a shot...)\nWanted poster (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nOh, it's a wanted poster for the rebel escapee everyone's talking about.\nRayfa:\nWhat? Let me see that. \"Datz Are'bal, senior member of insurgent leadership, and former paratrooper of a... ...foreign land. Wanted for crimes against the kingdom.

Well, I suppose I could... ...If you quit being a lawyer, and paid taxes to our kingdom, that is!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh well. It was worth a shot...)\nBoard game\nPhoenix:\nThis game looks kind of like checkers or chess.\nRayfa:\nYou mean to say you have never heard of Kachu'demahl? I have heard people describe it as \"Khura'inese chess.\"\nPhoenix:\nSo two players take turns moving their pieces in a bid to capture the other's king?\nRayfa:\nNot quite. In Kachu'demahl, the object is the utter annihilation of your opponent. Furthermore, each piece has a special move that can only be used once per game.\nPhoenix:\n(Special moves? It sounds like a game right up Maya's alley...)\nHandbag\nPhoenix:\nThere's a Steel Samurai patch on this bag. Guess the bag must be Maya's. She probably left it here while she was performing that rite.\nPortraits\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't this that justice minister I met? But who's the woman in the picture next to him? She looks really important. Could she be the Queen of Khura'in?)\nAfter examining Inner Sanctum poster, TV, wastebasket, wanted poster, and handbag:\nRayfa:\nLady Beh'leeb has not had a change of heart, and simply waiting shall not change that.\nPhoenix:\nC-Can't we wait just a little longer? (I wonder if she'll ever open up?)\n???:\nOh, you're still here.\nRayfa:\nLady Beh'leeb...\nPhoenix:\nMrs. Inmee... Do you think you're ready to talk?\nBeh'leeb:\n...Is it okay with you, dear? ...Yes. Yes, I will let him know.\nRayfa:\nLady Beh'leeb, you don't have to speak to this lawyer if it is not your wish.\nBeh'leeb:\nNo, it's quite all right. If my husband were still with us, he would say... \"As much as it pains me to have my lovely wife speak on such matters... ...if it would help to find the truth... then ask whatever you may.\"\nPhoenix:\nO-Okay, I'll take you up on your generous offer. (Wait... Did Mrs. Inmee call herself \"lovely\" just now?)\nRayfa:\nWell, whatever are you waiting for?! Ask your questions quickly, so your departure may be just as swift!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, of course...\nTalk\nTahrust Inmee\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any idea why your husband might have been killed? Was he acting different or doing anything out-of-the-ordinary lately?\nBeh'leeb:\nNo, I don't recall anything of the sort. ........................\nPhoenix:\n(Argh, this is really difficult.) Did anybody have a grudge against him?\nBeh'leeb:\nHe was a kind man, and one of peace. He would never do anything that would cause someone to bear a grudge against him.\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(Th-These are... Psyche-Locks! This means Mrs. Inmee is trying to hide something from me. This is the magatama Maya gave me all those years ago... ...and it has a really amazing power. It reacts when someone is hiding something... ...and allows me to see the Psyche-Locks that are holding that person's mind shut. Whenever I see any... ...I only have to present my magatama ([X / Y / R]) to try and unlock them. (Changed from [...I only have to touch my magatama (X) to try and unlock them.] in the original release) Unlocking them all usually allows me to coax the truth out of someone.)\nTahrust Inmee (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure there was no one who held a grudge against your husband?\nBeh'leeb:\nHe was a kind and gentle soul. He would have never done anything to make someone want to harm him.\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(Psyche-Locks... I'll have to unlock them before I can get any more information out of her.)\nPresent Magatama\nPhoenix:\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- The High Priest --\nPhoenix:\n(Psyche-Locks... They appeared when I asked her whether anyone held a grudge against her husband. That must mean... ...that Mrs. Inmee thought of someone who just might have such a grudge. Let's just stir the pot a little and see what happens.) Mrs. Inmee, I have an idea who your husband's real killer might be.\nBeh'leeb:\nThat would be Maya, would it not?\nPhoenix:\nNo, of course not. It has to be someone with a motive to kill him. This is who I believe had a reason to kill your husband.\nThe escaped prisoner\nPhoenix:\nI believe the escaped prisoner killed your husband. He probably thought that your husband would get in the way of his escape plan.\nBeh'leeb:\nBut were that the case, wouldn't Maya have been slain as well?\nPhoenix:\nOh, you're right. (Guess I'd better find someone else with a possible motive...)\nBeh'leeb:\nSo you see, Maya must have been the killer.\nPhoenix:\nNo, it had to have been someone else.\nLeads back to:\n\"This is who I believe had a reason to kill your husband.\"\nLady Kee'ra\nLeads to:\n\"It was the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra. Everyone's talking about her.\"\nThe rebel Dhurke\nPhoenix:\nThe rebel leader Dhurke killed your husband. He did it to stop the Purification Rite.\nBeh'leeb:\nHe must despise Lady Kee'ra for capturing his fellow insurgents. But were that the case, wouldn't he have slain Maya for playing the part of Lady Kee'ra?\nPhoenix:\n...G-Good point. (All right, so it wasn't Dhurke. Time to think about who else might've had a motive.)\nBeh'leeb:\nSo you see, Maya must've been the killer.\nPhoenix:\nNo, it had to have been someone else.\nLeads back to:\n\"This is who I believe had a reason to kill your husband.\"\nPhoenix:\nIt was the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra. Everyone's talking about her.\nBeh'leeb:\n\"I know not of what you speak.\"\nPhoenix:\nReally? Because she even made the front page recently.\nBeh'leeb:\n\"Kwah kah kah kah kah! I am but a humble servant of Lady Kee'ra. What reason would she have to kill someone as insignificant as I?\"\nPhoenix:\nActually... I have something that just might show why Lady Kee'ra would kill Abbot Inmee.\nPresent Lady Kee'ra's Warning\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This is a letter of warning from Lady Kee'ra.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nBeh'leeb:\nI don't see how that's connected with my husband -- or Lady Kee'ra, for that matter.\nPhoenix:\nR- Really? B-But doesn't this part here remind you of your husband?\nBeh'leeb:\nWhat are you talking about?\nPhoenix:\nUm, then... take a look at this part here! It really resembles Lady Kee'ra, doesn't it!\nBeh'leeb:\nI am not seeing this \"resemblance.\"\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry. It looks like I was mistaken... (That's strange. I could swear I had something that could prove... ...that the high priest was being threatened by Lady Kee'ra.)\nBeh'leeb:\nIt seems there really was no connection between my husband and Lady Kee'ra.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but I beg to differ.\nLeads back to:\n\"I have something that just might show why Lady Kee'ra would kill Abbot Inmee.\"\nPhoenix:\nThis is a letter of warning from Lady Kee'ra. Maya found it. It was in the Inner Sanctum -- and only Maya and your husband were there at the time.\nBeh'leeb:\nAugh!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nPhoenix:\nThis letter reached its intended recipient, your husband -- the high priest -- didn't it?\nBeh'leeb:\nAnd how do you know Maya wasn't lying to you? Because I've never seen that letter before, and I doubt my husband ever did, either.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but... I have evidence that proves this warning was meant for your husband.\nPresent Envelope\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Wh-What's that?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis proves that the warning was meant for your husband.\nBeh'leeb:\nUm... I'm afraid I don't understand.\nPhoenix:\nNo, I believe you do. Please take a good look.\nBeh'leeb:\n..................\nPhoenix:\n.........Still drawing a blank, huh. (Maybe I should really compare the warning letter with the rest of the evidence again...)\nBeh'leeb:\nI don't believe the warning has anything to do with my husband.\nPhoenix:\nNo, this warning was meant for him.\nLeads back to:\n\"I have evidence that proves this warning was meant for your husband.\"\nBeh'leeb:\nWh-What's that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's an envelope... addressed to the high priest. The warning letter was delivered to your husband inside this, wasn't it?\nBeh'leeb:\nAugh!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nBeh'leeb:\n\"...What nonsense is this? How can you prove the warning was delivered in this envelope?\"\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... There's gotta be some way to prove it... Wait a second. Don't the envelope and the warning letter have something in common?) ...I think there just might be something that links the envelope to the warning letter.\nBeh'leeb:\n\"There is?!\"\nPhoenix:\nYes, and that proof is right here on the warning letter. This spot on the warning letter proves that it was delivered in that envelope!\nPresent holes\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The three holes in the envelope...\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nBeh'leeb:\nThis spot?\nPhoenix:\nUm, no, a little lower. Oh, no, a little to the right. Errr... maybe it was all in my mind?\nBeh'leeb:\n.........Are you trying to be funny? At a time like this?\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (Didn't the envelope and warning letter have something in common?)\nBeh'leeb:\nIt seems the envelope was for some other letter, and not this warning.\nPhoenix:\nNo, I'm positive the warning letter was in the envelope addressed to the high priest. Look at this spot on the warning letter. It shows that the letter was in that envelope!\nLeads back to examination\nPhoenix:\nThe three holes in the envelope... ...are in the same shape and arrangement as the holes in the warning letter. And if you fold the letter in thirds and place it in the envelope, the holes line up.\nBeh'leeb:\nAugh!\nPhoenix:\nAs for what made the holes... I believe it was this...!\nPresent Warbaa'd Arrow\nLeads to:\n\"They were made by this Warbaa'd Arrow -- one of the weapons favored by Lady Kee'ra.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nBeh'leeb:\nWhat do you think about this, dear?\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but I'd rather hear your opinion, Mrs. Inmee.\nBeh'leeb:\n\"There are limits to the jests that will be tolerated, lawyer!\"\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry! (So it wasn't this... I'd better take another look at the shape of the holes in the warning and envelope.)\nBeh'leeb:\nThere was never any connection between my husband's murder and Lady Kee'ra, it seems.\nPhoenix:\nNo, the holes in the warning and the envelope can both be linked to her.\nLeads back to:\n\"As for what made the holes... I believe it was this...!\"\nPhoenix:\nThey were made by this Warbaa'd Arrow -- one of the weapons favored by Lady Kee'ra. The warning was folded in thirds, placed in the envelope addressed to the high priest... ...and delivered to your husband on the points of this arrow!\nBeh'leeb:\nEeeeeek!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nTahrust Inmee (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nPhoenix:\n...Are you ready to tell me the truth now?\nBeh'leeb:\n.................. I admit the warning was sent to my husband. But he was not an insurgent.\nPhoenix:\nThen why did you keep it a secret?\nBeh'leeb:\nBecause... the authorities might've suspected him of being one if I hadn't.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that makes sense... If the rebel hunter was after him, I can see how people might at least suspect.)\nBeh'leeb:\nWe are a Khura'inist kingdom. As such, rising up against the monarchy... ...is the same as blaspheming Khura'inism itself.\nPhoenix:\nYour husband was a devout priest of Khura'inism... ...and you feared that his good name would be tarnished if the warning went public.\nBeh'leeb:\n...Yes.\nPhoenix:\n(That makes sense, but is it the honest truth? What if the high priest really was a rebel? The rebel hunter would've had a motive to kill him. Still...)\nBeh'leeb:\n..................\nPhoenix:\n(This just doesn't feel like the right time to ask her about it.)\nThe warning (appears after \"Tahrust Inmee\")\nLeads to:\n\"Could you tell me a little more about the warning?\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nBeh'leeb:\nWhat is that badge for?\nPhoenix:\nIt's the attorney's badge used in my country.\nBeh'leeb:\nYes... Mm-hm. ...I agree, dear.\nBeh'leeb:\nMy husband says I should have nothing to do with lawyers.\nPhoenix:\nIt's not like we top the popularity charts back home, but c'mon! Can't a lawyer get a break?\nTahrust's Autopsy Report\nBeh'leeb:\nMy husband's...\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head! Do you not consider the consequences of your actions?!\nPhoenix:\nOh, um... sorry. That was pretty inconsiderate of me.\nBeh'leeb:\nOh...? Is that so? You really are a kind soul, dear.\nBeh'leeb:\n...My husband says he forgives you.\nPhoenix:\nTh-Thank you.\nBeh'leeb:\n\"I understand that you're desperate, but do not cause my lovely wife undue pain.\" \"Do I make myself clear... Lawyer?\"\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, ma'am! Er, I mean, sir!\nWanted Poster\nBeh'leeb:\nWhy, that is the escaped criminal who has all of Khura'in astir.\nBeh'leeb:\nWhen I think how he might still be lurking about, I get so scared, I can't sleep at night.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't blame her, considering she just suddenly lost her husband.)\nBeh'leeb:\nYes... Mm-hm... Really, dear?\nBeh'leeb:\n...My husband said he would protect me if that escaped criminal shows up.\nPhoenix:\n(By \"protect,\" does she mean she'll pummel the escapee with her husband's portrait?)\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me a little more about the warning?\nBeh'leeb:\nIt arrived about three days before the Purification Rite. When we woke that morning, it was already there by the side of our bed.\nPhoenix:\nIt was by the side of your bed?\nBeh'leeb:\nYes. We had the whole house locked up tight. And yet, someone still managed to slip in. Oh, it was so frightening, wasn't it, dear?\nPhoenix:\nBut you didn't contact the police... ...because you didn't want them to suspect your husband of being a rebel?\nBeh'leeb:\n...That's right. If only we had told the police, maybe Tahrust would still be alive today. \"Oh, lovely wife... No need to fret, my dear. My only regret is that I left you all alone...\"\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head! That is quite enough!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, you're probably right. Mrs. Inmee, I'm sorry to have bothered you at such a difficult time.\nBeh'leeb:\n...Don't be silly. I'm happy if I have helped. \"Your Benevolence... May you swiftly shine light upon the truth.\"\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head. You seem bent on casting suspicion upon Lady Kee'ra. And by doing so, you seek to deflect the blame from the real killer, Maya Fey. That is the only logical conclusion.\nPhoenix:\n...Gnrk! (I'm in no position to disprove her at this point. If only I could find something to support my theory that the high priest was a rebel... The only other person who might know more about Abbot Inmee would be Maya. They might be done questioning her by now. Maybe I'll stop by the detention center.)\nRayfa:\nMy mother has said what...? Hm, it seems I must go.\nPhoenix:\nDid something happen?\nRayfa:\nYes. My mother has decreed that a rite shall be held for the high priest's passing. And that she shall conduct the Prayer of Lament therein.\nBeh'leeb:\nHer Eminence has so decreed, has she?! Oh, but she should not concern herself with a humble priest like my husband.\nRayfa:\nNo, it is only natural, considering his meritorious service. The rite will be held at the palace. You are to accompany me there at once, Lady Beh'leeb.\nBeh'leeb:\nThank you, Your Benevolence. My husband is most delighted, too.\nPhoenix:\nHow wonderful for you, Mrs. Inmee. (A direct decree from the queen. That must be quite an honor.)\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head, you are coming as well.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? B-But I don't have much time left to investigate...\nRayfa:\nAs the one charged with monitoring you, you must remain within my sight at all times. Besides, it will take but a moment. Now, come along!\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Arguing the point will probably just make things worse for me. I'd better let her have her way this time.)\nMay 10Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber\nGa'ran:\nWelcome, Lady Beh'leeb.\nPhoenix:\n(So this is the queen of Khura'in...)\nRayfa:\nWhat is wrong with you, Barbed Head?! Show some respect!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Oh, um... (Sh-Should I bow? Or prostrate myself?)\nGa'ran:\n...No, it is quite all right. Stay as you are.\nRayfa:\nMother...\nBeh'leeb:\n...Your Eminence, I would like to give thanks to you. You honor both me and my husband.\nGa'ran:\nHis exemplary service deserves to be honored. Oh, but what a terribly trying time this must be for you, Lady Beh'leeb. May my prayer comfort your soul, and that of your dearly departed husband. Nothing would please me more.\nBeh'leeb:\nOh, Your Eminence.  Your words are wasted on my humble husband and I... *sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(Now that's what I call a commanding presence.)\nGa'ran:\nSo, you are the lawyer of whom my daughter speaks.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Eminence! I am so very honored to make your... n-noble acquaintanceship. I-I'm humbled to bask in your... resplendence? (Ack... Did I overdo it? I have no idea how to talk to a queen.)\nGa'ran:\nHo ho... May the Holy Mother's blessing be upon you. Now then, Lady Beh'leeb. Let us go to the Chamber of Prayer. Rayfa, you are to accompany us, too.\nRayfa:\nYes, Mother.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, the queen is seriously something else.)\n???:\nHeh. The Prayer of Lament, huh...\nInga:\nDon't see how that'll do any good.\nPhoenix:\n(I-It's... Justice Minister Inga!)\nInga:\nHm? Who're you, buddy?\nPhoenix:\nN-Nice to see you again, Minister Inga.\nInga:\nAgain? Have we met?\nPhoenix:\nI'm Phoenix Wright. We met in the accused lobby the other day.\nInga:\nOh, right. Blue suit, jagged hair... You're that lawyer who brought my daughter down a peg or two.\nPhoenix:\nYour... daughter?\nInga:\nYeah, Rayfa.\nPhoenix:\n(He's Princess Rayfa's father? So he's Queen Ga'ran's husband?)\nInga:\nYou planning on sticking your fat nose in this mess, too?\nPhoenix:\nThe accused is a good friend of mine.\nInga:\nLike I said the last time... ...you better watch yourself, see?\nPhoenix:\nUm, do you mind if I ask you a few questions?\nInga:\nYou want to question me?\nPhoenix:\nThat would be great.\nInga:\nHeh heh heh heh! You got balls, for a lawyer! Guess I can play along a bit. But I got things to do, see? So we'll have to talk while I work.\nExamine\nInga:\nHey, keep your paws off that stuff over there. It's all pretty pricey -- more than you could possibly imagine, I'd wager.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... I'd better keep my hands to myself.)\nMove\nPhoenix:\n(I bet it'd tick him off if I left now. I should talk to him a bit, and see what he knows.)\nTalk\nThis incident\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to let you know that I'll be the defense lawyer on this case, too.\nInga:\nWell, don't say I didn't warn you. You only won last time 'cause that idiotic prosecutor filed false charges. But it's gonna be different this time. I got Khura'in's top prosecutor on this one, see?\nPhoenix:\nI don't care who I go up against. I'm going to prove my client innocent.\nInga:\nYou haven't forgotten that little thing called the Defense Culpability Act, have you? Blow this one, and you'll suffer the same fate as the accused.\nPhoenix:\nHow could I forget?\nInga:\nHeh, you lawyers are all the same. You strut your stuff till the DC Act comes down hard. Then you start begging and pleading for your lives. It's really hard to watch, I tell you.\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, I don't plan on letting it come to that.\nDefense Culpability Act (appears after \"This incident\")\nLeads to:\n\"Were you the one who wrote the Defense Culpability Act?\"\nPresent\nAnything\nInga:\nWhere do you get off sticking that thing in my face? You forget who you're dealing with? Don't poke your nose where it don't belong. Or do you want a spot on my execution list?\nPhoenix:\nN-No, I'm good! (I'd better end this conversation now, before I really rub him the wrong way.)\nPhoenix:\nWere you the one who wrote the Defense Culpability Act?\nInga:\nHeh, maybe I did, maybe I didn't. What's it to you? Either way, as justice minister I'm gonna enforce the thing.\nPhoenix:\n.........!\nInga:\nIt started as a way to counter the dirty tricks of your trade like falsified evidence. But it turned out to be quite handy... Efficient, even!\nPhoenix:\nHandy...? Efficient...?\nInga:\nYeah, made my job reeeal easy. Any goons who cross me or the Ga'ran administration... ...are gonna get just what they deserve, especially those rebel scum!\nPhoenix:\n......! You can get away with that here?\nInga:\nBetter watch your mouth, lawyer. I enforce the law in Khura'in, see? And being that I'm the queen's husband, that makes me king!\nPhoenix:\n(.........Um, no... I'm pretty sure the queen is the boss around here.)\nInga:\nGo on, say what you're thinking so I can charge you with lese-majesty.\nPhoenix:\nUrk! (I can't get myself arrested now.)\nInga:\nListen up, lawyer. We got a low crime rate and a populace that lives in peace. And that's all thanks to the DC Act. So I don't want to hear any more lip about it.\nPhoenix:\nBut I can't defend my client unless I can speak my mind.\nInga:\nHeh, even without the DC Act, Dhurke and his insurgent scum buddies' days are numbered.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's that supposed to mean?!\nInga:\nLet's just say... I got a little trick up my sleeve. So I'd watch it if I were you. 'Cause you got a defiant attitude -- like one o' them dragon dupes. Say, White, you know what these are?\nPhoenix:\n...No, what?\nInga:\nOrders of execution. They really pile up if I start slacking off.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\nInga:\nAnd tomorrow, I'll have even more work to do... processing the one for your little friend. And if you really do defend her, I'll have to add one more to the pile for you. But you're not stupid enough to waste your life on that criminal, are ya?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't worry, I'll make sure to lighten your workload, Inga... I won't give you a single execution order to sign tomorrow!)\nRayfa:\nI have returned, Barbed Head.\nPhoenix:\nYour Benevolence. Are you done with the rite?\nRayfa:\nYes. It was performed flawlessly. Lady Beh'leeb stayed behind to speak with Mother.\nPhoenix:\n(I hope this will help ease her sorrow, even if just a little.)\nRayfa:\nSo, you have been speaking with my father?\nPhoenix:\nYes, you could say that.\nRayfa:\nMy father is a great man. He works tirelessly to keep the peace in our kingdom. Khura'in as it stands today owes everything to the efforts of my mother and my father. You should feel deeply honored. Under normal circumstances, they would have never spoken so readily with a lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, of course. (It seems Rayfa doesn't know what her father is really like.) Well, now that we're done here, let's go see if I can talk to Maya now.\nMay 10Detention Center\nMaya:\nOh, it's you, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nMaya, are you okay? The questioning wasn't too harsh, was it?\nMaya:\nNo, I'm all right. How about you? Make any progress?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I haven't found any conclusive evidence that could prove your innocence... ...but I have a small lead.\nMaya:\nReally?\nPhoenix:\nBut for right now, I'd like to ask you about the high priest.\nMaya:\nSure, ask away. ...By the way, what's the princess doing with you still, Nick? Doesn't she have anything better to do?\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't seem like it...\nRayfa:\nI heard that! How rude! Of course I have many other things I could be doing!\nTalk\nThe high priest\nPhoenix:\nIt's just a thought, but... do you think the high priest could've been a rebel?\nMaya:\nA rebel?! Why would you even think that?!\nPhoenix:\nBecause if he was... ...then the rebel hunter Lady Kee'ra would've had a motive to kill him.\nRayfa:\nWh-Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh. Princess Rayfa overheard me.)\nRayfa:\nWh-Wh-What idiocy is this?! Abbot Inmee, a rebel?! It is beyond the pale! My mother has offered the Prayer of Lament to his soul! That is the sort of person he was!\nPhoenix:\nAll right, all right. I was just raising the possibility.\nRayfa:\nI will not listen to such... such... tomfoolery!\nPhoenix:\n(...She stormed out. Oh, well, nothing we can do about that.) Do you recall the high priest doing anything suspicious?\nMaya:\nHmm... Come to think of it, he seemed unusually restless during the rite. He kept glancing up at the sky, though I have no idea why.\nPhoenix:\n...He was restless and kept looking up at the sky? Hmm, that doesn't really tell us much, does it? Anything else come to mind?\nMaya:\n...Sorry, that's about it.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess this is all I'm going to learn about the high priest right now. Oh, but there is one thing I should follow up on...)\nMaya:\nI want to keep my spirit channeling ability a secret while I'm here, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Why?\nMaya:\nI'll, um... explain later.\nPhoenix:\n(With Princess Rayfa gone, this might be my only chance.)\nChanneling (appears after \"The high priest\")\nPhoenix:\nMaya, about what you said earlier... Why can't you tell anyone you're able to channel spirits?\nMaya:\nOh, that! You know how all the queens are also spirit mediums here?\nPhoenix:\nI heard. It was kind of a shock at first, though.\nMaya:\nIn Khura'inism, spirit channeling is a secret art that can only be performed by the queen. No one else is supposed to be able to do it.\nPhoenix:\nI see. So spirit channeling is a symbol of power or authority, then, in that sense. I can see why it would look bad if a \"nobody\" from another country were able to do it, too.\nMaya:\nSpirit Channeling in the Kurain Tradition... ...was developed from a Khura'inist style that was brought to the U.S. via Japan. But it seems like my clan's spiritual power is greater than that of the average Khura'inese. It may be a quirk due to how our styles diverged, but I don't really know.\nPhoenix:\n(So, if spirit channeling is a power possessed only by the queens of Khura'in... ...and it's a power that somehow made its way down the line to Maya... ...then I guess that makes Queen Ga'ran and Princess Rayfa distant relatives of Maya's...?)\nMaya:\nAnyway, it's not like there's some kind of rule about it. It's just, I'd rather not have it become an issue or anything. That's why mediums who come here to train hide the fact that they can channel spirits.\nPhoenix:\nI see... (I had no idea it was so complicated.)\nMaya:\nEither way, training here is a must to fulfill the qualification needed to become the master.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what is this qualification to become the master?\nMaya:\nTo be able to channel spirits of one's own volition and without fail every time. Like, remember how my spirit channeling was always hit or miss? I only ever succeeded about thirty percent of the time.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, and it was more like spirits possessed her, as apposed to her channeling them...) So you can do it every single time now, whenever you want?\nMaya:\nYep! ...At least, I think.\nPhoenix:\nYou think?\nMaya:\nWell, I haven't actually tried channeling anyone since I completed my training here. But once I get back home, I plan on taking the final spirit medium test. I'll have to try channeling one spirit after another in a marathon channeling session!\nPhoenix:\nOnly those who pass the test are worthy of becoming the master, huh?\nMaya:\nYeah, but I know I can do it. I'm going to ace that test and become the next master! After all, I can't let my clan and the other villagers down.\nPhoenix:\n(Right... Maya's the next big hope of Kurain Village. That's got to be a lot of pressure.) So, speaking of similarities... ...I've noticed another similarity between our countries besides spirit channeling. I saw a show on TV earlier that reminded me of \"The Steel Samurai.\"\nMaya:\nOh, you must mean \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\"!\nThe Plumed Punisher (appears after \"Channeling\")\nLeads to:\n\"So, you've already seen \"The Plumed Punisher\"? You really don't miss a beat!\"\nPresent\nLady Kee'ra's Warning\nPhoenix:\nWhy would Lady Kee'ra want to stop the Purification Rite? ...Ooh, I know!\nPhoenix:\nYou do?\nMaya:\nYeah! Because she's only got the one outfit and nothing to change into!\nPhoenix:\nYou'd think she'd have normal clothes for when she's not busy rebel hunting, Maya...\nMaya:\nSo, you've already seen \"The Plumed Punisher\"? You really don't miss a beat!\nPhoenix:\nActually, it was Her Benevolence who told me all about it.\nRayfa:\nThere is not a single person in Khura'in who does not know of it.\nPhoenix:\nOh, Your Benevolence. You're back.\nRayfa:\nAs the royal priestess, I am charged with monitoring your movements. So, I have changed my mind. For in order to fulfill my duty... ...I must not avert my ears -- not even from your blasphemous theories.\nPhoenix:\n(Her sense of duty is commendable... ...but I wouldn't mind if she backed off a bit.)\nMaya:\nGreat timing, Your Benevolence. There's, actually, something I wanted to show off to the both of you.\nPhoenix:\nShow off? (Maya sure seems excited all of a sudden...)\nMaya:\nYup! Ta-daaaah!\nPhoenix:\nWh- What's that?\nMaya:\nIt's an ultra-rare Plumed Punisher strap! There's only one of them in the whole world! It was specially made to promote the TV show!\nRayfa:\nY-You're the owner of this strap?!\nPhoenix:\nDon't tell me... you're a Plumed Punisher fan, too, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nN-No, of course not. Only little children watch that show! I have no interest in such things!\nPhoenix:\nRight...\nRayfa:\nNo, I am telling the truth!\nPhoenix:\n...Sure, let's just leave it at that. ...So, how did you get your hands on that, Maya?\nMaya:\nEh heh heh! I found a kindred spirit in a Plumed Punisher fan here in Khura'in! It resulted in an exchange of cultures transcending national borders!\nPhoenix:\nAnd by cultural exchange, you mean you swapped TV show promo merchandise?\nMaya:\nYou bet! I traded my Steel Samurai watch for this strap. It's a super rare watch that plays The Steel Samurai theme song when the alarm goes off. My newfound Khura'inese friend was so happy, I got this one-of-a-kind strap in return!\nPhoenix:\nI guess there are people like that wherever you go -- even here in Khura'in...\nMaya:\nWatch this! When you press the magatama on her belt, it plays the show's theme song!\nPhoenix:\nThat sounds just like The Steel Samurai theme song.\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about? Can't you hear the folk instruments in the intro and the exotic tones throughout? Plus, the Steel Samurai has Japanese taiko drums that go... ...daka don-don-don in the intro!\nPlumed Punisher Strap added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nUmm, right... Guess my ears just aren't as good as yours.\nMaya:\nAnyway, I have this amazing idea for a new show. \"The Plumed Punisher vs. The Steel Samurai\"! I'm going to totally go pitch it to some TV stations when I get back home! It's going to be a huge hit! Right, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nI-I have no interest in such things!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, if nothing else... ...talking about \"The Plumed Punisher\" has, thankfully, seemed to cheer Maya up a bit.) It's getting late. Try to get some sleep, okay, Maya? And leave tomorrow to me.\nMaya:\n...Okay. Thanks, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(I think I've covered just about everything. Time to head back to the temple and go over everything I've learned so far.)\nPlaza of Devotion, Inner Sanctum, Detention Center, or Bazaar\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nRayfa:\nMy father is a great man with a gentle soul, is he not?\nPhoenix:\nYes, well... (Are we talking about the same person here?)\nRayfa:\nYou, too, could become a man of upstanding character if you learned from his example.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sure... (Upstanding character? Him...?)\nRayfa:\n...I care little for that tone of yours. It is as if you do not agree!\nPhoenix:\nN- No, you have it all wrong! (Why is my face always such an open book?!)\nWhat to do\nRayfa:\nYou have visited the accused a number of times already. Could it be you are smuggling in tools one at a time for a jailbreak?\nPhoenix:\nOf course not! Besides, you've been watching me like a hawk!\nRayfa:\nWell then, perhaps you are cutting the bars in the visitor's room bit by bit.\nPhoenix:\nHow on earth would I even do that?!\nRayfa:\nWith that barbed head of yours, of course.\nPhoenix:\nNow this is getting ridiculous...\nRayfa:\nHeh, of course it is. I'm merely having a little fun here.\nPhoenix:\nWell, please don't have it at my expense! (I'm mentally taxed enough already...!)\nPresent\nWanted Poster\nRayfa:\nAh, the escaped prisoner... He has the very face of evil. It actually reminds me of you... lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nI hardly think I look that scary.\nRayfa:\nHmph. Do not doubt my all-seeing eye in such matters, Barbed Head. It is the appearance of your mitamah that reminds me of his evil face.\nPhoenix:\nWell, if we're talking about my soul, I guess I just have to trust your professional opinion. (If it wasn't for the express purpose of making me out to be a criminal, that is.)\nPlumed Punisher Strap\nRayfa:\nDo not flaunt that strap before me!\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I get the feeling you really want this for yourself, Your Benevolence.\nRayfa:\nYou... youuu... nincompoop! You know not of what you speak! I desired it so dearly, that I had all of our retainers dispatch multiple postcards for it.\nPhoenix:\n(All right, then. It seems \"really want\" was an understatement.)\nHigh Priest's House\nExamine\nPortraits\nPhoenix:\nPictures of the queen and her husband, the Justice Minister of Khura'in.\nRayfa:\nYes, my mother and my father. What do you think? Do they not possess an awe-inspiring air?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um... ( \"Terrifying\" is more the word I would use...)\nRayfa:\nWell?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes! They are very awe-inspiring!\nPresent\nPlumed Punisher Strap\nBeh'leeb:\nTh-That's...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's a strap that Maya received. Would you happen to know anything about it?\nBeh'leeb:\n...It's for the Plumed Punisher action hero.\nRayfa:\nOf course she knows, Barbed Head! It's only the most popular show in all of Khura'in!\nBeh'leeb:\nIt would seem... that the royal priestess is more familiar with the matter than I.\nRayfa:\nWhat?! N-No! I was... simply advocating on behalf of the show's fans!\nMay 10Tehm'pul Temple\nPhoenix:\n(It's getting late. Won't be long till sundown.)\n???:\nMr. Wright, Your Benevolence!\nAhlbi:\nAre you done with your investigation for today?\nPhoenix:\nPretty much. I thought I'd go over what I've learned so far. Care to join me?\nAhlbi:\nYes! Please allow me to help!\nPhoenix:\nOkay. First, we know that the high priest received a warning three days ago. It was from someone claiming to be Lady Kee'ra, and it told him not to perform the rite.\nAhlbi:\nThat's right! It was that rebel hunter. But what of it?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I'm not sure of yet. Why would Lady Kee'ra want to stop the rite?\nAhlbi:\nIf you could solve that mystery...\nPhoenix:\nRight. I could figure out her motive for threatening the high priest. It might be the break I need, but I just don't know enough right now to act on that lead.\nRayfa:\nHow unfortunate for you, Barbed Head. Your only hope is pure speculation. That shall not stand up in the Hall of Justice. You have no actual proof of Lady Kee'ra's involvement in this crime, after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah...The warning letter alone can't prove who killed the high priest.)\nRayfa:\nI'll give you one last chance to withdraw before you are charged under the DC Act.\nAhlbi:\nYour Benevolence!\nRayfa:\nWhile it is true you did not forge or suppress any evidence... ...that is, perhaps, a product of my careful monitoring of your every move.\nPhoenix:\nI wasn't planning to do anything like that in the first place, Your Benevolence. But I AM going to prove Maya's innocence, within the confines of the law!\nRayfa:\nH-How can you be so sure you will?\nPhoenix:\nBecause of my undying faith in my clients. That is a lawyer's greatest weapon.\nRayfa:\n.................. Hmph. What nonsense. You have chosen to dig your own grave. When next we meet, it shall be in the Hall of Justice. As royal priestess, it is my duty to reveal the truth through the Divination S\u00e9ance. This time, I will prove that the insights I glean thereof are the very truth itself. Prepare yourself, for this shall be your last trial... and your last rites. Tomorrow shall end with you under the headsman's axe!\nPhoenix:\n(Tomorrow... I'll be defending Maya in that so-called Hall of Justice again. That whole S\u00e9ance thing makes trials here completely different from those back home. Plus, I don't have a shred of conclusive evidence. On the other hand, I've got plenty of confusion and anxiety to spare. I'll have to think of something. After all, I'm the only lawyer in all of Khura'in. I have to do this. I WILL do this! I'll prove Maya's innocence if it's the last thing I do!)\nTo be continued\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNothing particularly interesting here.\nArea already examined\nPhoenix:\nI've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I think I have all the information I need.

But if I can figure out Lady Kee'ra's motive for threatening the high priest, then maybe...)\nMaya:\n...Nick, um... today, I... well...\nPhoenix:\nDon't look so down, Maya. I'm going to defend you with everything I've got!\n???:\nYou would do well to cease this insanity while you still can.\nPhoenix:\n...As I said yesterday, I'm going to defend my client in court.\nRayfa:\nWell, know this... You shall not witness a miracle of the sort that occurred last time. The moment she is found guilty, you, too, will be found guilty of abetting the accused.\nPhoenix:\nI never claimed to be a miracle maker. But I AM good at discovering the truth. And unlike miracles, the truth is always waiting to be found.\nRayfa:\nThe truth, you say? Hmph. Then it seems you have chosen your fate. This shall be... your very last trial.\nMaya:\nNick...\nPhoenix:\n...I'm going to prove you innocent, Maya, you'll see. After all, you have to introduce... ...\"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\" to the folks back home, right?\nMaya:\n...Right! I may be a defendant this time... ...but I'll be by your side like always, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Maya. This place is tough on lawyers. I'll need all the help I can get. Plus, it's always good to have you on the team! Well, it's time. Let's go!\nMay 11High Court of Khura'in\nDay 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise\nJudge:\nLet the trial of Maya Fey begin.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Magistry.\nNahyuta:\n........................\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nNahyuta:\n........................\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nQuiet! Can't you see Prosecutor Sahdmadhi is absorbed in silent prayer?\nPhoenix:\n(Great. The trial's barely started and the judge is already mad at me.)\nMaya:\nHe's very devout for a prosecutor.\nJudge:\nHm? Why is the accused standing over there?\nMaya:\nOh, umm... Well...\nPhoenix:\nYour Magistry. In addition to being the accused, she is also my assistant.\nJudge:\nThe accused is your assistant, you say? ...Very well, then. A criminal does indeed make a fitting partner to a lawyer with a defiled soul.\nMaya:\nThat... wasn't very nice.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well, bad-mouthing lawyers seems to be a custom of sorts here in Khura'in.\nJudge:\nI must say, I am surprised to see you still here in Khura'in, Mr. Wright. And even more so to find you in the Hall of Justice once more. I cannot fathom why you would willingly risk your life in yet another trial.\nPhoenix:\nThe answer is simple, Your Magistry: I am a lawyer, and this is what lawyers do. (Although to be frank, I'd rather be anywhere but here right now...)\nNahyuta:\n........................... Such foolishness.\nJudge:\nAh, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Are you ready to begin now?\nNahyuta:\nYes, Your Magistry. The prosecution is ready. Let us begin without further delay. But first, I promise you both this: I will cast your wicked souls into the fires of hell. Thus shall the soul of the victim attain salvation.\nJudge:\nHa ha ha ha ha! Splendid! I would expect nothing less of you, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.\nGallery:\nPlease save the victim's soul, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi!Punish the wicked lawyer who dares to stop these last rites!\nPhoenix:\nI think I'll pass on that whole fire and brimstone deal. But I'm not surprised by your words or stance, considering what Apollo's told me about you.\nNahyuta:\nSo, it was you who instilled that putrid lawyerly guile within him.\nPhoenix:\nP-Putrid... what?\nNahyuta:\nHe, too, must soon face the fires, lest his soul be lost to redemption. But I shall send you on ahead, so that he will not be lonely when he arrives.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but I'm afraid it won't be that easy. People say I never know when to give up! Nervous, Maya?\nMaya:\nA little...\nPhoenix:\nFeels like it's been ages since we stood side by side like this in court.\nMaya:\nToo bad I'm the defendant...\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry. We haven't lost a case together yet!\nMaya:\nYou're right! Let's give this everything we've got, Nick!\nJudge:\n...Now then, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, would you please explain the case at hand?\nNahyuta:\nOf course, Your Magistry. Let us begin the last rites of the victim. Maya Fey has been charged with the crime of murder. The victim of her heinous crime was high priest Tahrust Inmee. He was conducting the Purification Rite when he was brutally slain.\nJudge:\nAnd the cause of death?\nNahyuta:\nLet us review the victim's autopsy report and the crime scene photo, shall we? The cause of death was blood loss from a stab wound delivered to the abdomen. The murder weapon was likely the Warbaa'd Dagger, which was used in the rite. However, the weapon has yet to be found, though the scene was thoroughly searched.\nJudge:\nA sacred relic used as a tool of murder? The Holy Mother's wrath shall be most severe.\nNahyuta:\nThe murder itself took place at the height of the Purification Rite. The accused had donned Lady Kee'ra's sacred robes. And the victim was there to offer prayers as a high priest of Khura'inism. During the rite, the victim and accused were the only two at the Inner Sanctum. Therefore, the only person who could have slain the victim is Maya Fey.\nJudge:\nHmm... I must say, that does cast a great deal of suspicion upon the accused.\nNahyuta:\nIndeed. Now then, allow me to submit this diagram of the crime scene as evidence in this case.\nInner Sanctum Diagram added to the Court Record.\nNahyuta:\nIn Khura'inism, slaying a priest is a sin most grave and dreadful. As such, Maya Fey's soul shall be plunged into the lowest level of hell -- the Hell of Tickling. There, she shall be tickled without end for five hundred million years. (Changed from [There, she shall be tickled without end for 500 million years.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nThat is a terrible fate indeed. Would the defense care to respond?\nPhoenix:\n(And here I thought the lowest level of hell was the Hell of Back Pain!)\nMaya:\nI don't remember killing anyone, and I don't have that dagger or anything like it!\nPhoenix:\nAs my client stated, she has no memory of the event as described by the prosecution. But more importantly, she had no motive to kill the high priest in the first place!\nNahyuta:\nNahyuta:\nHmph. I thought you might say that. Nevertheless... The meaningless prattle of lawyers is utterly ineffectual here in the Hall of Justice. For all will be made clear by Her Benevolence Rayfa Padma Khura'in's Insights.\nJudge:\nSo it is, and so it shall be. The Divination S\u00e9ance reveals the truth for all to see.\nPhoenix:\n(Here we go again!)\nJudge:\nBailiff! Please show in the royal priestess!\nGallery:\nIt's Princess Rayfa! Oh, how beautiful Her Benevolence looks again today!Glory to the Holy Mother for this blessed day!\nPhoenix:\n(As popular as ever, I see.)\nRayfa:\nRest assured, good people of Khura'in. I will defeat this murderer and her abettor. They shall not escape on their Freedom Express today!\nJudge:\nWhat a joy it is to have the royal priestess back in the Hall of Justice! May the Holy Mother grant us her divine favor! Ur dihara Khura'in!\nGallery:\nUr dihara Khura'in!Ur dihara Khura'in!\nPhoenix:\n(She sure looks pleased with herself... Especially for someone who didn't know what a \"Freedom Express\" was until yesterday.)\nRayfa:\nHm? Is there something stuck to my face, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nN-No, nothing, Your Benevolence.\nJudge:\nNow then, Your Benevolence, the Divination S\u00e9ance if you please.\nRayfa:\nVery well... Nayna, my robe... O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination S\u00e9ance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!\nJudge:\nThe victim's mitamah has spoken... The Divination S\u00e9ance is complete.\nPhoenix:\n(Great... Another clearly incriminating S\u00e9ance vision.)\nNahyuta:\nIt could not be any clearer, O foul defense. The accused donned the sacred robes of Lady Kee'ra, and then attacked the victim.\nJudge:\nOh, how very terrible it must have been. The figure of Lady Kee'ra lit against the dim lantern light... The scent of incense growing ever more potent as she drew near... One can almost sense the horror Abbot Inmee must have felt!\nNahyuta:\nThe facts as presented by Her Benevolence are indisputable.\nMaya:\n...B-B-But! Th-That wasn't me! Do something, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm working on it! (That couldn't have been any clearer. Looks like I'm in for another uphill battle.)\nRayfa:\nThe accused committed this vile act during our ancient tradition, Purification Rite.\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, the Rites Guide explains the multipart Purification Rite in detail.) The Transformation Rite... The high priest reads scripture, while a priestess dons the robes of Lady Kee'ra. The Rite of Water... Lady Kee'ra enters the spring, and the high priest purifies her, along with her dagger. The Rite of Fire... The priestess circles the sacred flames to purify her soul.\nRayfa:\nIndeed... It would seem that the murder occurred during the Transformation Rite. The rite dictates that the high priest stand in front of the spring. Therefore, the accused must have attacked him from the direction of the broken lantern. Well, Barbed Head? Would you care to object?\nPhoenix:\nOf course. Because I know my client is innocent!\nRayfa:\nHeh heh, so you say. You truly do not know when you are beaten, do you?\nPhoenix:\n(I managed to pull it off last time with Ahlbi. I'll just have to do it again!)\nJudge:\n...You intend to find fault with Her Benevolence's Insights yet again? It would seem lawyers are pohlkunan creatures indeed.\nGallery:\nLook at that pohlkunan! Pohlkunan! Pohlkunan!\nPhoenix:\n...Wh-What exactly is a \"pohlkunan\"?\nMaya:\nSomeone who's a real piece of work, so to speak.\nPhoenix:\n(They can call me anything they want. The only thing I care about is uncovering the truth!)\nRayfa:\nSo, Barbed Head. Are you foolish enough to risk your life for your so-called truth? Because my Insights ARE the truth! To deny them is to willingly dig your own grave!\nInsight\n-- Rayfa's Insight --\nRayfa:\nThe victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra.\nAs the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly...\n...he heard the accused's approaching footsteps and smelled her incense-laden robes.\nIt was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed.\nAs his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world.\nRayfa:\n...That is everything the victim experienced in his final moments.\nInner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record.\nNahyuta:\nDressed in the sacred robes of Lady Kee'ra, the accused rushed the victim head-on. The brutal stabbing she perpetrated could not have been any clearer.\nRayfa:\nYes, it is plain for all to see.\nMaya:\nN-No, it wasn't me! A sudden drowsiness came over me during the Transformation Rite. I didn't even get a chance to put on Lady Kee'ra's robes!\nNahyuta:\nYou waste our time with such meaningless statements, accused. You cannot explain away the truths revealed by the royal priestess's divine Insight.\nMaya:\nOoooh... ...How did you end up finding contradictions last time?\nPhoenix:\nThe deceased's final memories include all five senses.\nMaya:\nOh, you mean those words that appeared in the Pool of Souls? It looked to me like the bigger the word, the stronger the sensation was to the victim.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's how it looked to me, too. The sensations themselves are never wrong -- only their interpretations. That's why I tried to point out mistakes in Rayfa's Insights the last time.\nMaya:\nSo, there could be contradictions between what Abbot Inmee felt and her Insights, huh!\nPhoenix:\nYou got it. And I'm going to find them this time, too. (Should I check how to point out contradictions in Rayfa's Insights?)\nLet's check, just in case\n(I can switch between Insights with [left analog stick left / A] and [left analog stick right / D]... (Changed from [I can switch between Rayfa's Insights using these arrows on the Touch Screen or D-Pad/Circle Pad...] in the original release) ...while I look for inconsistencies between them and the sensations in the vision. (Changed from [...while I look for inconsistencies between them and the sensations on the upper screen.] in the original release) S\u00e9ance visions can be paused with [B / Z]. (Changed from [S\u00e9ance visions can be paused by touching \"Pause\" (L) on the Touch Screen.] in the original release) I can even jump to different points in the S\u00e9ance vision... ...using [A / M] and [Y / B]. (Changed from [...by moving the mitamah mark to a different panel or by pressing A or Y.] in the original release) When I see an Insight that doesn't seem right, I should \"Select\" ([X / Y / R]) it. (Changed from [When I see an Insight that doesn't seem right, I should touch \"Select\" (X).] in the original release) Then all I have to do is point out the sensation that contradicts with the Insight! The sensations this time seem to fluctuate more than the ones from Ahlbi's trial. In which case, I'd better keep an eye on changes in their intensity, too.)\nLeads to S\u00e9ance vision\nI'm okay\nPhoenix:\n(Nah, I remember how it works. Still... The sensations this time seem to fluctuate more than the ones from Ahlbi's trial. In which case, I'd better keep an eye on changes in their intensity, too. Okay! Time to point out the sensations that contradict the Insights!)\nLeads to S\u00e9ance vision\nThe victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra.\nAs the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly...\n...he heard the accused's approaching footsteps and smelled her incense-laden robes.\nPresent Footsteps (Sound) on fifth panel\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The victim supposedly heard the accused's approaching footsteps.\"\nIt was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed.\nAs his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim supposedly heard the accused's approaching footsteps. But did he really?\nRayfa:\nWhat nonsense is this?! Is it not abundantly clear?!\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's not. Because there is something strange about those footsteps.\nRayfa:\nS-Strange? Explain yourself, Barbed Head.\nPhoenix:\nThe footsteps are strange because...\nThe timing doesn't make sense\nPhoenix:\nThe timing doesn't make any sense! There shouldn't be any footsteps!\nRayfa:\nThere should not be footsteps as the accused was approaching the victim? Really? Then do you suggest that the accused was actually floating through the air?!\nPhoenix:\nWell, I mean...\nRayfa:\n.........I suggest you hold your tongue.\nPhoenix:\nS-Suggestion noted. (If that's not it, then...) But there's definitely something strange about those footsteps. They're strange because...\nLeads to:\n\"They're not getting any louder!\"\nThey don't get louder\nLeads to:\n\"They're not getting any louder!\"\nPhoenix:\nThey're not getting any louder!\nJudge:\nAnd why exactly does that matter?\nPhoenix:\nPlease focus your attention on the incense the victim smelled. The scent grows stronger as the accused approaches. If the accused really had approached the victim... ...the sound of her footsteps would've grown louder as the scent of incense grew stronger!\nRayfa:\nAhhh!\nJudge:\nWh-Why, that makes perfect sense! How can this be explained, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nUm, w-well... There must be a reason...\nNahyuta:\nNahyuta:\nIt is as they say... \"Even a putrid worm of a lawyer will turn.\"\nPhoenix:\n(What does that even mean...?)\nMaya:\nHe's not exactly singing your praises, that's for sure.\nNahyuta:\nStill, we cannot discount this information solely on account of its lawyerly source. Your Benevolence... Perhaps you must listen more carefully to the abbot's mitamah.\nPhoenix:\n(Listen more carefully? What's he talking about?)\nRayfa:\nHmm... Yes, it would appear so. I shall try to refine the sensation.\nPhoenix:\nR-Refine the sensation?\nRayfa:\nI can more accurately gauge sensations by deepening my communication with a mitamah.\nPhoenix:\nI-I didn't know you could do that. (Why have we never done this before?!)\nNahyuta:\nBy refining a sensation, a clearer picture of the truth can be discovered.\nRayfa:\nO blessed mitamah, I beseech you! Hear me now and respond to my call!\nS\u00c9ANCE VISION REFINED\nJudge:\n\"Footsteps\" changed into \"bells\"? What could this mean?\nPhoenix:\n(Bells? But the only bells at the scene of the crime were...)\nMaya:\nAh! That jingling must've come from Abbot Inmee's bells!\nPhoenix:\nYou mean those big things he had on his ankles?\nNahyuta:\nWell, there you have it. The sound of bells was from the high priest's own footsteps.\nRayfa:\nTh-Then that means...!\nPhoenix:\nIf the footsteps belonged to the victim himself... It means it was the victim who was moving -- not the accused! The victim was the one who went running toward the broken lantern from the spring! A far cry from what Her Benevolence's Insight would have us believe!\nRayfa:\n...Nngh!\nInner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nBut why would the victim have approached the accused?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he was trying to defend himself.\nJudge:\nPlease explain.\nPhoenix:\nHe could've felt threatened by Lady Kee'ra standing there with a dagger. If so, he might have thought to overpower her before she attacked.\nRayfa:\nStill your voices! This is nothing but a theory, and a poor one at that! B-Be not led astray by this lawyer's obvious postulation!\nNahyuta:\nNahyuta:\nWhile his insolence is inexcusable... ...I would ask that you calm yourself, Your Benevolence.\nRayfa:\nIs there something you would care to say, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?\nNahyuta:\nEven if it was Abbot Inmee who moved, it does not negate the accused's crime.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nNahyuta:\nThe accused was likely waiting for the high priest to approach.\nRayfa:\nAh!\nNahyuta:\nAnd as he neared, she plunged the dagger into him. It is as simple as that.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, right... It really doesn't change much, does it...)\nRayfa:\nYes! It is as the prosecutor has said! In fact, it is as I meant to say all along as well!\nPhoenix:\n(Riiight... And that's why you were so shocked when you first heard it.)\nRayfa:\nUnderstand now, lawyer? That contradiction you conjured up has come to naught. Once I hone my Insights, it will vanish like the dying rays of the sun!\nInsight Revised\n...he heard the accused's approaching footsteps and smelled her incense-laden robes.\n...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the broken lantern.\nRayfa:\nSee? The fact that it was Abbot Inmee who moved... changes nothing!\nPhoenix:\nArngh! (C'mon Phoenix. You gotta keep your cool. That contradiction I pointed out must mean something. That one sensation changed after Princess Rayfa refined her vision. It stands to reason that something else might have changed too because of the refinement. I should focus on any sensations that have changed... ...while searching for more contradictions between them and her Insights!)\nThe victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra.\nAs the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra. Suddenly...\n...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the broken lantern.\nPresent Water (Sound) on fifth panel\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Hold it!\"\nIt was then that the victim felt an intense pain. I believe this is when he was stabbed.\nAs his life's blood spilled over, his vision dimmed, till finally, he passed from our world.\nPhoenix:\nHold it! How do we know the Purification Rite was performed exactly as it was supposed to be?\nRayfa:\nHmph. That's easy. The customs governing the rite are very clear, and Abbot Inmee would've adhered to them.\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's strange.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Would you care to explain just what is so strange?\nPhoenix:\nYes. I would ask you to consider the sound of the victim's footsteps. The sound of bells changes to the sound of water at one point.\nRayfa:\nWhat's this?\nPhoenix:\nIt's simple. The victim must have stepped in some water.\nNahyuta:\nOh?\nPhoenix:\nYes. And the only source of water in the Inner Sanctum... is the spring. ...And therein lies the contradiction!\nRayfa:\nWh-What contradiction?\nPhoenix:\nI believe the rite started out as it should have. The victim stood with his back to the spring, and the accused stood right in front of him. But, we now know that the victim then moved into the spring.\nJudge:\nP-Pohlkunka! That is absurd!\nPhoenix:\nThis means the accused's location differs from what Her Benevolence's Insight indicates!\nRayfa:\n...Aaaungh!\nJudge:\nTh-Then, where do you propose the accused stood once she donned Lady Kee'ra's robes?\nPhoenix:\n(Based on the sound of the victim's footsteps, I believe Maya was standing here.)\nPresent Spring\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Until this moment, we've all just assumed...\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nDo you really believe the accused was standing there?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Not when you say it that way, Your Magistry...\nJudge:\nKeep making sloppy statements like that, Mr. Wright, and I'll have your tongue!\nPhoenix:\nPlease... A-Anything but the chop-chop...\nJudge:\nThen let's have an actual answer out of you. Where do you believe the accused was actually standing?\nLeads back to:\n\"Based on the sound of the victim's footsteps, I believe Maya was standing here.\"\nPhoenix:\nUntil this moment, we've all just assumed... ...that Abbot Inmee and Ms. Fey were standing where they were supposed to be... ...as shown in this rites guide. In short... The victim should've been standing with his back to the spring, and the accused in front. However, if that is how they were really standing... ...he couldn't have stepped into the spring as he approached her. The problem is, the victim DID step into the spring. This can only mean that Ms. Fey had actually been standing in the water!\nJudge:\nB-But if this is true... then their positions would've been completely reversed!\nInner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nWh-What is going on here, Ms. Fey! Were you really standing in the spring?\nMaya:\n...I-I'm sorry, but... I barely remember anything about the rite.\nGallery:\nThe high priest would never make such an obvious blunder during a rite!What on earth...? Is that even possible?\nRayfa:\nRayfa:\nBe that as it may, this does not overturn my Insights!\nPhoenix:\n...It doesn't?\nRayfa:\nLet us say the accused was standing in the spring. ...So what?\nPhoenix:\n...\"So what\"? This completely reverses their positions is what!\nRayfa:\nThat their positions differed from what is customary is rather curious. However, what does that change? It certainly does not erase the accused's brutal crime!\nPhoenix:\n..................I guess you have a point there.\nRayfa:\nYou lawyers are an absurd breed. Never thinking ahead, you cling to the first insignificant contradiction you can muster.\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nMaya:\nSounds like Princess Rayfa has a pretty good grasp on what lawyers are all about.\nPhoenix:\n...Oh, Maya. Where would I be without your brutally frank commentary right now. (Is this contradiction really meaningless? But something really doesn't feel right. Did I take a wrong turn somewhere?)\nRayfa:\nHmph. I will now amend my Insight to account for this new truth.\nInsight Revised\n...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the broken lantern.\n...he rushed the accused and tried to fight her off by the pool-side lantern.\nRayfa:\nNow the contradiction is no more. But the truth of the matter still stands, no matter how stubbornly you deny it.\nJudge:\nWhat do you have to say for yourself now, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nNnngh...!\nMaya:\nN-Nick!\nNahyuta:\nYour Magistry, this lawyer may have raised a trivial objection... ...but Her Benevolence's Insights have no further inadequacies of any kind.\nJudge:\nYes... So it would seem.\nPhoenix:\nWait a second! But there IS another contradiction!\nNahyuta:\nStill you flounder about? Wretched beast... Though you rack that putrid brain of yours, nothing worthwhile will come of it.\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya, please tell me you remember something that might help us out here...\nMaya:\nSorry... I really don't remember a thing. But now that the place I was standing in has changed, who knows? That alone may cause a new discrepancy with Princess Rayfa's Insights.\nPhoenix:\n(That's right. We now know that Maya was standing in the spring. A major change like that could very well produce a contradiction. I should take another look at the Inner Sanctum diagram in the Court Record... ...and confirm where Maya and Abbot Inmee were standing. And then focus on finding any discrepancies between their positions and the Insights.)\nThe victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra.\nAs the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra.

I've found a new contradiction.\nRayfa:\nYou... You did? Hmph. No doubt it is but another of your vile attempts to slander my Insights.\nPhoenix:\nNope. Take a good look at what the victim saw. It just might change your mind. The lantern flame behind the accused was flickering.\nRayfa:\nThere is nothing unusual about that. Especially as the wind had stirred.\nPhoenix:\nNo, that's where you're wrong. If the accused had been standing in the spring... ...then what you see here should be one of the lanterns flanking the statue.\nRayfa:\nI fail to see your point.\nPhoenix:\nMy point is, something is wrong here. The two lanterns flanking the statue were both outfitted with glass wind guards. So neither lantern's flame should have been flickering in the wind in the first place!\nRayfa:\n........................Heh.\nMaya:\nShe seems pretty tickled, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI don't remember saying anything funny.\nRayfa:\nI fail to see what you wish to prove here, but... very well. I shall refine the vision and reveal the truth for all to see. O blessed mitamah, I beseech you! Fix your sight upon the lantern there.\nS\u00c9ANCE VISION REFINED\nPhoenix:\nH-Huh? That lantern doesn't have a wind guard on it.\nRayfa:\nAnd rightly so. For the wind guard was removed to reveal the sacred flame within for the Rite of Fire. Therefore, there is nothing odd about the flame flickering.\nPhoenix:\nS-Say whaaat?! B-But when we searched the crime scene, those lanterns had their wind guards on!\nNahyuta:\nThat's because the police put them back on. The sacred flames have burned uninterrupted for hundreds of years, defense. We could not risk them being extinguished, even during an investigation.\nPhoenix:\nTh-That would never fly back home...\nRayfa:\nWell, Barbed Head? Are you done quibbling? If so, then it is time to bow down before this testimony of the mitamah!\nPhoenix:\n.........Arnghk!\nMaya:\nNick...!\nPhoenix:\n...Don't worry, Maya! I'm just getting started! (All right, let's go over everything we know so far. Maya was wearing Lady Kee'ra's robes and standing in the spring. The high priest is thought to have been moving toward her. So I should look for sensations that stand in contradiction to this arrangement. I won't give up! I'm going to find a contradiction that will undermine the accusation against Maya!)\nThe victim commenced the Purification Rite by bowing to the lanterns and reading a sutra.\nAs the first part -- the Transformation Rite -- ended, he lowered the sutra.

One minute you shout out, and in the next, you fall silent.\nRayfa:\nPerhaps it is like the bellow of one who is barreling down a hill with no way of stopping.

Even if this overturns the entire case you've built so far... ...the only way is to keep moving forward -- because that's where we'll find the truth!) ...Sorry, but I'm not barreling down a hill. In fact, I'm in full control of everything with the indisputable contradiction I found!\nRayfa:\nIs that so?\nPhoenix:\nThe lantern behind the accused clearly-- No, BLATANTLY contradicts your Insight!\nRayfa:\nDoes it now...?\nPhoenix:\nOne of the lanterns on the entrance side of the Inner Sanctum was broken. And if you watch what Abbot Inmee saw in his final moments... ...you will notice that the lantern behind the praying form of Ms. Fey is broken. The lantern behind Lady Kee'ra, however, is still intact. In short, we are seeing two different lanterns in this S\u00e9ance vision!\nRayfa:\nH-How could this be?! And even if it were so, how would that contradict my Insights?!\nPhoenix:\n.................. Let me start by saying, the claim I'm about to raise... ...will overturn the case I've built thus far.\nJudge:\nWill the defense please explain himself?\nPhoenix:\nBased on the broken lantern, we can tell...\nMaya and Abbot Inmee's positions\nLeads to:\n\"Where the accused and the victim were standing!\"\nThe lanterns positions\nPhoenix:\nThe correct position of the lanterns!\nRayfa:\nBut did you not just explain that yourself?\nPhoenix:\nOh, did I?\nJudge:\nThe defense will own up to its own statements!\nPhoenix:\n(I'd better stop filling His Magistry's anger meter...)\nJudge:\nThe fact that there was a broken lantern does not change anything.\nPhoenix:\nI beg to differ, Your Magistry! There is one thing it makes clear. And that is...\nLeads to:\n\"Where the accused and the victim were standing!\"\nPhoenix:\nWhere the accused and the victim were standing!\nJudge:\nBut did you not just finish asserting that the accused was standing somewhere else?!\nPhoenix:\nI did. And I built my argument on that faulty premise. But thankfully, it has led us here... ...to the actual spot where Maya Fey was standing!\nJudge:\nI must say, if the defense keeps changing its assertions in such a capricious manner... ...its credibility may come into question.\nPhoenix:\nI'm willing to take that risk, Your Magistry, because I believe this will be the last time. I'd like to start by pointing out the actual spot where the accused was standing.\nJudge:\nVery well... Show us where you now believe the accused was actually standing.\nPhoenix:\n(Based on the location of the broken lantern, where was Maya really standing?)\nPresent area between southern lanterns\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I wasn't thinking straight before, but now it's all falling into place.\"\nPresent anywhere else\nJudge:\nHmm... And you are sure it was there?\nPhoenix:\nOh, uh, my hand slipped. Sorry, can we just say that one didn't count?\nJudge:\nCounting such baffling gaffes is my job, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nWell, it was worth a try... (I need to think about the location of the broken lantern. That should make the spot where Maya was standing more than apparent!)\nJudge:\nO Holy Mother of Khura'in, Mr. Wright! You remind us yet again why lawyers are reviled. This time, see that you point out where the accused was really standing.\nLeads back to:\n\"Based on the location of the broken lantern, where was Maya really standing?\"\nPhoenix:\nI wasn't thinking straight before, but now it's all falling into place. We know the victim had stepped into the spring. That means Maya Fey had to have been standing in the water as he approached. However, his memory, which has only now become clear, reveals that... ...Ms. Fey was standing by the side of the broken lantern. In other words... ...she was standing where she was supposed to be according to custom.\nRayfa:\nRayfa:\nDoes that not bring us back to the very beginning?!\nPhoenix:\nNo, this is where things take a different turn -- and I mean that literally. The victim had to have been moving toward the spring. That means that while he was moving, he had his back turned toward the accused!\nRayfa:\nWhat's this?! Do you mean to say the victim turned around during the rite?! But such an image appears nowhere in the S\u00e9ance vision!\nPhoenix:\nActually, it does appear. It's just that no one noticed until now.\nJudge:\nN-No one noticed?! How could no one have noticed something so big?!\nPhoenix:\nThere was a moment when the scripture the victim was holding was all we could see. Thanks to that, none of us could tell that he was, in fact, turning around in that moment.\nRayfa:\n...Nngh!\nNahyuta:\nNahyuta:\nIf it is as the defense asserts, then Her Benevolence's Insights no longer make sense. How do you intend to explain that?\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nI don't need to explain anything, because it's just as you said, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Her Benevolence's Insights DON'T make any sense because they contain a huge error!\nRayfa:\n...S-Such insolence!\nJudge:\nA huge error, you say? Do explain.\nPhoenix:\nThe huge error is...\nThe order of the rites\nPhoenix:\nThe order in which the smaller rites were performed is all wrong! But there's only one way to tell. So let's ask for confirmation from someone who was actually there. Well, Maya?\nMaya:\nSorry, Nick... I was out cold, so I don't remember a thing.\nJudge:\n...It seems there is no way to know.\nPhoenix:\n(Nngh...)\nJudge:\nBut what I'm wondering is... ...what does the order of the rites have to do with this case in the first place?\nPhoenix:\n............Truth be told, I hadn't considered that yet.\nJudge:\nConsider the meaning behind this penalty, then!\nPhoenix:\nConsider it done, Your Magistry... Your Magistry! Please give me another chance!\nJudge:\n...Very well. But do not test my patience any further. Now, tell me. What is the huge error in Her Benevolence's Insights?\nLeads back to:\n\"The huge error is...\"\nThe crime scene\nPhoenix:\nThe scene of the crime is wrong!\nRayfa:\nBut the vision clearly shows that Abbot Inmee was murdered at the Inner Sanctum!\nPhoenix:\nCould there be another place that looks just like it?\nJudge:\n...No, there can't.\nPhoenix:\n(Agh. If that's not it, then...) Your Magistry! Please give me another chance!\nJudge:\n...Very well. But do not test my patience any further. Now, tell me. What is the huge error in Her Benevolence's Insights?\nLeads back to:\n\"The huge error is...\"\nThe number of people there\nLeads to:\n\"I believe this is what happened at the scene of the crime:\"\nPhoenix:\nI believe this is what happened at the scene of the crime: The victim was reading a sutra when suddenly, he sensed someone behind him. He immediately looked back to see someone dressed as Lady Kee'ra standing there. Wishing to see who it was, he approached the robed figure. That's when he was stabbed!\nRayfa:\nThis cannot be!\nPhoenix:\nOh, but it can. And it is! The Insight stating the accused stabbed the victim is wrong! And that is the real truth lying behind this testimony of the dead!\nRayfa:\nPo...\nJudge:\nPo...\nNahyuta:\nPo...\nRayfa:\nPohlkunkaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\nJudge:\nA- Are you suggesting... ...that there was someone else at the scene of the crime?!\nRayfa:\nHnnnnnngh! Have I misunderstood... the voice of the mitamah... yet again? ...Th-This--! This cannot be!\nPhoenix:\n(Whew... That was a close one. But I managed to divine the true meaning behind the S\u00e9ance vision somehow. I should add these new facts to the Court Record.)\nInner Sanctum Diagram updated in the Court Record.\nNahyuta:\nYour Benevolence, please allow me to take it from here. I will overturn the brash accusations of this faithless, putrid-minded lawyer.\nRayfa:\nY-Yes... I shall place my trust in you.\nJudge:\nAre you sure about this, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?\nNahyuta:\nMy work as an international prosecutor has taken me to courtrooms around the world. And in that time, I have learned to perform last rites for souls in trials lacking a S\u00e9ance.\nJudge:\nYes, of course. Forgive my ludicrous inquiry.\nNahyuta:\nMoreover, I have with me a forensic investigator from overseas. I will show you all the most magnificent last rites ever seen.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess he really does think highly of Ema and her forensic expertise. I'm impressed that he's come to understand their value. Then again... ...he IS an international prosecutor who's solved tough cases around the world. Time to hunker down, huh...)\nJudge:\nNow then, let us continue with today's proceedings. Could the defense please tell us who the third party dressed as Lady Kee'ra was? Your new claim has negated the Insights of the royal priestess... ...so I trust you have some evidence to support it, correct?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, of course. (This third party must have really wanted to kill the high priest. I might be able to identify who it was if I had evidence of their murderous intent!)\nJudge:\nWell, we're waiting, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nThe evidence that can reveal the identity of the third party... is this!\nPresent Lady Kee'ra's Warning\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Three days before the Purification Rite...\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis piece of evidence tells us who the third party is!\nNahyuta:\nAh, yes. I suppose this evidence does clearly demonstrate one thing: The fact that you are lowlier than the lowliest of worms, that is.\nJudge:\nEven a lawyer like you cannot not worm your way out of this one, defense.\nPhoenix:\nNngh, talk about opening up a can of worms... Your Magistry, I'd like to present another piece of evidence!\nJudge:\nWell, it seems the worm is not without a spine. Very well. What other evidence do you have for us today?\nLeads back to:\n\"The evidence that can reveal the identity of the third party... is this!\"\nPhoenix:\nThree days before the Purification Rite... ...the victim received a warning letter from an unidentified individual!\nJudge:\nHe did?!\nPhoenix:\nWhoever sent it clearly meant to threaten the high priest. The letter said, \"Do not perform the rite.\" But the rite went on as scheduled. I believe that is why the high priest was murdered.\nJudge:\nWho do you suppose sent that letter?\nPhoenix:\nA person with something to hide -- the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra herself!\nJudge:\nPeace! I-I... I don't understand. I had heard the Lady Kee'ra that has been in the news of late only hunted rebels. If so, why would she have killed the high priest?\nPhoenix:\nExcellent question. Maybe it would help to think of it this way: What if the high priest... had secretly been a rebel?!\nGallery:\nThe high priest?! He couldn't possibly have been a rebel!\nJudge:\nThe high priest -- a devout follower of Khura'inism... a rebel?! Do you even comprehend the blasphemy of which you speak? Well? DO YOU?!\nPhoenix:\nI, too, found it hard to believe at first. But as I continued my investigation, it started to become more and more plausible.\nNahyuta:\nNahyuta:\nThe third party was the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra? And the high priest was a rebel? Your mockery of Khura'inism... No... ...of the Kingdom of Khura'in itself knows no bounds!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops.)\nGallery:\nThat shameless pohlkunan lawyer...He's making a mockery of our religion!\nJudge:\n...As a faithful Khura'inist, I take issue with these claims. And I am loath to admit them into today's proceedings.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't like where this is going.)\nNahyuta:\nThe defense's claims are but vile blasphemy tantamount to spitting on the Holy Mother.\nPhoenix:\nI-Is it really that big of a deal, Maya...?\nMaya:\nAbbot Inmee was a distinguished monk, and very well-respected, too, so... yeah.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Please don't let this turn into an international incident...)\nNahyuta:\nBut fear not, good people of Khura'in. The rantings of this putrid-brained lawyer who seeks to sully the soul of the deceased... ...shall come to no avail once I conclude these last rites. The prosecution's assertion that the accused killed the victim remains unchanged.\nPhoenix:\nB-But...the victim was stabbed in his abdomen! How is that possible when he had his back turned toward Ms. Fey?! Someone else must have killed him!\nNahyuta:\nNahyuta:\nAre you sure about that? You may have invalidated the S\u00e9ance, but do not let it go to your putrid head. The karmic flow of this trial is, as yet, still in my hands.\nPhoenix:\n(How can he be so confident?)\nNahyuta:\nHeh heh heh... Something has occurred to me, you see. And your allegations of a third party are but a deluded fantasy. And I shall prove that by calling a new witness to the stand. ...An eyewitness who will deliver a definitive answer that will dispel the defense's doubts.\nPhoenix:\nA-An eyewitness...?\nJudge:\nVery well. Let us call this eyewitness to the stand.\nPhoenix:\n(It's him again!)\nJudge:\nWell, now... He has to be the shaggiest witness I have ever laid eyes upon. Please state your name and occupation.\n???:\nOh, um... I'm, ya know, that so-and-so, whatchamacallit! A'nohn Ihmus TBD! 'Least that's what they've been calling me!\nJudge:\n\"TBD\"? As in \"to be determined\"? Can't you just tell us your real name?\nNahyuta:\nThe witness has suffered a blow to the head, rendering him amnesiac. Therefore... ...I named him \"A'nohn Ihmus (TBD)\" in my report, but he thinks \"TBD\" is part of his name.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou're letting an amnesiac testify?!\nNahyuta:\nHave no fear. I have already questioned him at length. While it is true he has utterly forgotten his name and past... ...his memory of what he witnessed is still very much intact.\nJudge:\nConsidering the dearth of information, any new knowledge may be of help. Therefore, I will permit his testimony. Now, Mr. Ihmus, please tell us what you saw.\nIhmus:\n..................\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Night of the Murder --\nIhmus:\nThat night, I was up at the top of Mt. Poniponi, the mountain next to the Inner Sanctum.\nI hate crowds, so I climbed up there to pray in peace.\nI know it's a no-no, but since there was no one around...\n...I used my binoculars to spy on the rite at the Inner Sanctum.\nThat's when I saw the accused... stab the high priest with a dagger!\nPhoenix:\nThere's no way you saw Ms. Fey stab the victim with a dagger!\nMaya:\nI-I swear I don't know what he's talking about! ...Or don't remember, at any rate!\nJudge:\nMt. Poniponi... the beautiful mountain that is also known as the Little Sanctum.\nPhoenix:\n(They must be talking about that smaller mountain from the poster...)\nJudge:\nMr. Ihmus, I was wondering...\nIhmus:\nWhat can I do ya for?\nJudge:\nThe Inner Sanctum lies at a high elevation where clouds and fog can obscure the view. Are you sure you were able to see what happened from the mountaintop next to it?\nPhoenix:\n(Good point!) H-His Magistry raises an excellent question! Well, Mr. Ihmus?!\nIhmus:\nOn the day of the rite, there wasn't a cloud in the sky! I had a perfect view! If ya don't believe me, check the weather forecast in the paper that day!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't we have the newspaper for that day?!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, let's take a look. Hmm... It does say calm, clear skies, doesn't it?\nIhmus:\nSee? Told ya so!\nMay 9th Newspaper updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, it would appear the witness has offered testimony worth hearing.\nNahyuta:\n...Mr. Ihmus. I, too, have a question for you.\nPhoenix:\n(Didn't he already question the witness?)\nIhmus:\nWell, that's what I'm here for, right? Shoot!\nNahyuta:\nHow was the accused holding the dagger? Was she holding it underhanded, its blade protruding from the bottom of her hand?\nIhmus:\nYep, I believe she was! It's called a reverse grip!\nNahyuta:\nAh... I thought as much.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHold it right there! What bearing does that have on this case?\nNahyuta:\nCease your interruptions, you putrid-headed lawyer. Do you not see the significance in how the blade was held?\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you enlighten me, O enlightened one?\nNahyuta:\nFeh. I knew you were a fool. I can already picture you in your next life.\nPhoenix:\nN-Next life...?\nNahyuta:\nYes... After your soul writhes for centuries in the pits of hell... ...you shall be reborn as a witless sea urchin, with barbs limited to your posterior. You shall live a short, inconsequential life, only to be brutally devoured by a sea otter.\nPhoenix:\n(That was a bit excessive. I simply asked what the dagger grip had to do with the case.)\nNahyuta:\nNow, pay attention. How the accused held the dagger is of vital importance. With such information, we can infer exactly what actions she took. You were saying that the victim was killed while he had his back to the accused. Is that correct?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes...\nNahyuta:\nAs such, the accused's dagger grip tells us something very important: The accused approached the victim from behind, swung her arms around him... ...and plunged the dagger deep into his abdomen, using a reverse grip!\nPhoenix:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nNahyuta:\nThus, Mr. Ihmus's testimony clears up any doubts that might remain.\nJudge:\nHa ha ha! And it coincides with Her Benevolence's Insights as well!\nPhoenix:\n(This is a disaster! I thought I'd blown those Insights out of the water, but now they're back to haunt me!)\nJudge:\nNow then, the defense may cross-examine the witness.\nCross-Examination\n-- The Night of the Murder --\nIhmus:\nThat night, I was up at the top of Mt. Poniponi, the mountain next to the Inner Sanctum.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure you're not mistaken, Mr. Ihmus? Was it really Mt. Poniponi that you climbed?\nIhmus:\nOh, I'm sure of it! It was a really poniponi-ish mountain!\nPhoenix:\n(What does that even mean?)\nIhmus:\nYa know, now that I think about it, it was a mighty fine view!\nIhmus:\nI hate crowds, so I climbed up there to pray in peace\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIf you hate crowds, why bother climbing to the top? Couldn't you have just as easily prayed at the bottom of Mt. Poniponi?\nIhmus:\nWrong, bucko! This is a once-a-year, epic event! I wanted to pray as close to the actual thing as possible!\nPhoenix:\nIf you're so gung-ho about it, why didn't you go pray at the Plaza of Devotion?\nIhmus:\nLike I said, I hate crowds. I wanted to pray in peace!\nPhoenix:\n(O Holy Mother, why do I only get the annoying ones...?)\nIhmus:\nAnd my burning faith demanded that I climb up the mountain closest to the Inner Sanctum! Also...\nIhmus:\nI know it's a no-no, but since there was no one around...\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSince nobody was around... ...there is nobody who can corroborate your actions, either.\nIhmus:\nHee-HO! Y-You're exactly right!\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, Mr. Ihmus, let me ask you this: Was there a reason you didn't want to be seen?\nIhmus:\nUh... About that... If ya get caught climbing the surrounding mountains on the day o' the rite... ...ya can get in big, big trouble!  Har har har har har!\nPhoenix:\n...Th-That's it?\nIhmus:\nYeah, it's totally embarrassing getting yelled at when you're a grown-up! Har har har har har!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you're a real \"grown-up,\" all right...\nIhmus:\nAnd since nobody was around, I lost all inhibition and...\nIhmus:\n...I used my binoculars to spy on the rite at the Inner Sanctum.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou had a pair of binoculars with you? That's pretty convenient. You weren't planning to spy on the rite all along, were you?\nIhmus:\nA-Actually, I just happened to have 'em for bird watching.\nPhoenix:\nBird watching, huh...? I see.\nMaya:\nYou're not going to keep pressing him on this?\nPhoenix:\nHe's sketchy as heck, but I don't really have anything I can really sink my teeth into yet.\nMaya:\nOh... okay then.\nIhmus:\nHaaar har har har har! I love the great outdoors! That's just the kinda guy I am! A guy called... A'nohn Ihmus TBD!\nPhoenix:\n..................\nMaya:\nH-He's... really starting to get on my nerves.\nIhmus:\nAs I looked through my binoculars, I couldn't believe what was unfolding before me.\nPresent Ritual Curtain\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Your Magistry!\"\nIhmus:\nThat's when I saw the accused... stab the high priest with a dagger!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nDid you really see what you say you did?\nIhmus:\nAre ya saying I'm lying about this?! Well, I'm not! It's etched permanently in this old noggin!\nMaya:\nB-But, I didn't do what you say I did... I didn't even get a chance to touch the dagger on the day of the rite!\nIhmus:\nWhadda I know o' that? All I know is what I saw! I've never even seen ya before in my life. What possible reason could I have to lie?!\nPhoenix:\nUrrrrrrgh...!\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't expect there to be any witnesses way up there.)\nMaya:\nB-But, I... I don't remember doing that at all!\nPhoenix:\nI know. I have a feeling the witness is lying. There has to be an inconsistency somewhere in his testimony. (I should take another look at the Court Record.)\nPhoenix:\nYour Magistry! I had my doubts about this bushy-bearded witness, but now I KNOW we can't trust him.\nIhmus:\nWhat?! You ain't just judging me solely on my bodacious beard, are ya?\nPhoenix:\nNot at all, Mr. Ihmus. It's much more than your sketchy appearance. It's your sketchy testimony.\nJudge:\nH-His testimony, you say?!\nPhoenix:\nYes. Recall how the Inner Sanctum was that day. Specifically, that it was completely enclosed by the ritual curtain.\nJudge:\nWhy yes! I believe you're right!\nPhoenix:\nThe curtain would have completely blocked the witness's view from Mt. Poniponi. Therefore, he couldn't possibly have seen the murder happen!\nIhmus:\nHoo-hah...!\nJudge:\nMr. Ihmus, have you been knowingly making false statements to this court?!\nIhmus:\nErr... Umm... Well, uhhh... AAIEEEEEE! YA GOT MEEEEEEEEEE!!!\nJudge:\nThe witness will lower his voice!\nIhmus:\nI didn't actually see the accused herself!\nPhoenix:\n(He \"didn't actually see the accused herself\"? What's that supposed to mean?)\nIhmus:\nLemme set the record straight! I beg ya!\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Night of the Murder (Amended) --\nIhmus:\nI saw their shadowy silhouettes, projected against the ritual curtain!\nThe figures were created by the light of the full moon on that clear and still night.\nShe was just a shadow, but I could tell it was the accused, reverse-gripping that dagger!\nPhoenix:\nSh-Shadows...? That's what you saw?\nIhmus:\nThat's right. I could see what was going on by the shadows projected onto the ritual curtain.\nJudge:\nIn the future, Mr. Ihmus, I would rather you offer up accurate testimony from the start.\nIhmus:\nForgive me, my main man Mr. Magistry. Chalk it up to my fuzzy memory!\nNahyuta:\nThough he saw but shadows, it is still valuable testimony.\nPhoenix:\n(You have to be kidding me...)\nMaya:\nWh-What are we going to do now, Nick?!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... All I can think of is... ...to look for inconsistencies between the actual rite and what Mr. Ihmus says he saw.\nJudge:\nNow then, the defense may cross-examine the witness once more.\nCross-Examination\n-- The Night of the Murder (Amended) --\nIhmus:\nI saw their shadowy silhouettes, projected against the ritual curtain!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo what you saw were simply shadows...?\nIhmus:\n...That's right. Those shadow figures on that bright white curtain... They showed through plain as day. I could see everything that happened!\nPhoenix:\nBut Ms. Fey and Abbot Inmee were at the top of a mountain, late at night. The only light up there was coming from four small lanterns. How could the shadows have been projected that clearly onto the curtain?\nIhmus:\nNo wonder people harp on you lawyers! You're always so dang skeptical! The lanterns weren't the only sources of light, ya know!\nIhmus:\nThe figures were created by the light of the full moon on that clear and still night.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou claim to have seen shadowy figures that were projected onto the ritual curtain. But did you really see them, Mr. Ihmus?\nIhmus:\n'Course I did! The bright moonlight projected them onto that curtain, clear as day. It was like watching a scene out o' a horror movie from my front row seat on Mt. Poniponi!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I guess the moon does shine a bit brighter when you're way up there...) Maya, do you recall how bright the moon was that night?\nMaya:\nUmm... I remember there weren't any clouds, and that the moon was definitely out. But I don't remember if it could cast any shadows.\nPhoenix:\nOkay, thanks. (We can't deny that the moon was really bright. Which means it's possible that it was bright enough to cause shadows to appear.)\nIhmus:\nHar har har har har! I remember it just like it happened!\nPresent Rites Guide\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"You saw silhouettes projected by the moonlight?\"\nIhmus:\nShe was just a shadow, but I could tell it was the accused, reverse-gripping that dagger!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHow do you know it was Ms. Fey, if all you saw were shadows?\nIhmus:\nIt was that little bun on toppa her head! Didn't need to see her face. That distinctive bob's a dead giveaway! Never underestimate my keen sense o' observation! Har har har har har! Now that's one funny haircut!\nMaya:\nIt's not nice to make fun of a girl's hairstyle! I like my hair this way! Besides! You're one to talk, you sasquatch!\nIhmus:\nYou're not into this wild, manly look I'm sporting? Shows what you know, little girl! Haaar har har har har!\nMaya:\nNick...!  Isn't there some kind of a crime you can charge him with?!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm afraid it doesn't work that way...\nPhoenix:\nNow he claims he only saw shadows? His testimony has sketchy written all over it.\nMaya:\nThen there must be an inconsistency in there somewhere!\nPhoenix:\n...Yep. (Was he really watching everything from Mt. Poniponi? If so, then I should see how his testimony lines up with the conditions of the rite.)\nPhoenix:\nYou saw silhouettes projected by the moonlight? Sorry, but that's just not possible.\nIhmus:\nWh-Whaddaya mean?! How's it not possible that it was totally possible?! That's impossible!\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'm going to need a \"logicalese\" translation on that...) Let's take a look at this rites guide, shall we, Mr. Ihmus? The rite is held \"when the moon is directly over the summit of Mt. Poniponi.\"\nIhmus:\nDoot doot doooooot...\nPhoenix:\nSo if the moon was shining from the west, shadows would've been cast eastward. But Mr. Ihmus was standing to the west of the Inner Sanctum on Mt. Poniponi.\nJudge:\nO Holy Mother!\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. Our witness here couldn't have seen any shadowy figures on that curtain!\nIhmus:\nN-N-No... NO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY-HEE-HEE-HEEEE!\nJudge:\nHmm... Perhaps it was the sacred flames of the lanterns that cast the shadows he saw?\nPhoenix:\nI'm afraid not. I inspected them during my investigation, but... ...the flames were too small to cast the crisp, distinct figures Mr. Ihmus claims to have seen.\nIhmus:\nBut...! I did see those silhouettes! Really!\nMaya:\nBut how could he, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe he was someplace where they WERE visible...? (Wait... Don't tell me...!) Your Magistry! If Mr. Ihmus really did see those shadows, it brings a brand-new fact to light!\nJudge:\nAnd that would be...?\nPhoenix:\nThe brand-new fact that comes to light if Mr. Ihmus really did see those shadows is...\nHe didn't see the murder\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't see the murder!\nIhmus:\nBut I just told ya I DID see the silhouettes on the curtain! If you think I didn't see the murder, then prove it!\nPhoenix:\nI can't actually prove it, but my lawyer's intuition tells me you didn't see it!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, you shall have to do better than that. Unless you want more of these, anyway.\nPhoenix:\n(He's saying he saw the shadows from Mt. Poniponi, which I've shown is impossible. In that case...) Your Magistry. If Mr. Ihmus really did see the shadows, there can be only one explanation.\nLeads to:\n\"He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder!\"\nHe was somewhere else\nLeads to:\n\"He wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder!\"\nPhoenix:\nHe wasn't where he claimed to be at the time of the murder!\nIhmus:\nD-Doot doot dooooot...\nJudge:\nOh? Then where do you propose the witness was?\nPhoenix:\nSomeplace where he could have seen the shadow figures, naturally!\nMaya:\nWait! You mean...\nPhoenix:\nNone of the mountains east of the Inner Sanctum are close enough for a good view. That leaves only one place he could've clearly seen the shadows from.\nJudge:\n...And where might that be?\nPhoenix:\nThis is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder.\nThe Plaza of Devotion\nPhoenix:\nHe was at the Plaza of Devotion!\nNahyuta:\nDo you truly believe Mr. Ihmus could see the Inner Sanctum from there?\nPhoenix:\nHe must have really good eyes.\nIhmus:\nOoh, I do pride myself on my excellent vision! But still, you think I could've seen the Inner Sanctum with a big ol' mountain in the way?\nJudge:\nIt's not a matter of good eyesight, defense. I must punish you for not seeing that.\nPhoenix:\nArgh... Should've seen that coming... (All righty, then...)\nJudge:\nYou lawyers are a desperate lot, aren't you.\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry, Your Magistry. I'll get it right this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder.\"\nThe high priest's home\nPhoenix:\nHe was at the high priest's home!\nJudge:\nAnd just how do you propose he saw those curtain shadows from there?\nPhoenix:\nUmm, the witness must be clairvoyant.\nJudge:\nClairvoyant?! Is this true, Mr. Ihmus?\nIhmus:\nDo I look like a psychic nutjob to you?\nJudge:\n...Not a psychic one, at any rate.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, at least the insult wasn't directed at me this time.)\nJudge:\nYou lawyers are a desperate lot, aren't you.\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry, Your Magistry. I'll get it right this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"This is where Mr. Ihmus was at the time of the murder.\"\nThe Inner Sanctum\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Ihmus was at the Inner Sanctum -- just outside the curtain on the east side!\"\nPhoenix:\nMr. Ihmus was at the Inner Sanctum -- just outside the curtain on the east side! That's the only place from which he could've seen the shadowy figures!\nIhmus:\nHoo-haaaaaah!\nNahyuta:\n.........Ngh!\nMaya:\nReally?! Wow, I didn't even think of that!\nJudge:\nBut wasn't the Inner Sanctum off-limits to all but the victim and the accused?\nPhoenix:\nAnd the third party who was there, you mean. I get the feeling that's a subject Prosecutor Sahdmadhi would rather not touch right now.\nNahyuta:\n.....................\nJudge:\nAh, you mean...!\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. This witness was at the scene of the crime. Which means he is the mysterious third party we saw during the Divination S\u00e9ance. He could be the one who dressed as Lady Kee'ra and killed the high priest!\nIhmus:\nGoo-geeeeeeh!\nJudge:\nWh-Wh-Whaaaaaat?!\nNahyuta:\nNahyuta:\nNo one but the two participants were allowed anywhere near the Inner Sanctum. And the only way up there are the stairs that start down at the Plaza of Devotion. So tell me: How do you propose the witness entered that sacred space?\nPhoenix:\nOh, umm... He must've, uhhh... (I haven't thought THAT far ahead...)\nJudge:\nThe sanctum has sheer cliffs on three sides and a steep, towering rock face on the other. No one could have made it there by climbing the faces of those cliffs.\nNahyuta:\nHis Magistry speaks true. To say Mr. Ihmus was at such an inaccessible location is but a bid to tarnish his credibility. Is that not right?\nIhmus:\nRight! I wasn't at the Inner Sanctum! No sir, no how! At least I'm pretty sure I wasn't!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nT-Then, what about those silhouettes you claim to have seen?\nIhmus:\nI'm starting to think I've been imagining things!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! Th... This is insane!\nGallery:\nI knew we couldn't trust that lawyer. He's trying to frame the witness!\nJudge:\nPeace! Peace, I say!\nPhoenix:\n(This is impossible! Unless I can show how he got to the Inner Sanctum... ...it just looks like I'm trying to slander Mr. Ihmus.)\nMaya:\nI believe in you, Nick! Rah, rah, siss boom bah! Fight, fight, Phoenix Wright!\nGallery:\nJust look at the accused. Has she no shame?\nMaya:\nWhat's your problem, lady?! Phoenix Wright is very trustworthy, I'll have you know!\nGallery:\nShe's got some nerve for a criminal! I bet that lawyer poisoned her mind.\nPhoenix:\nP-Please, Maya, you're only making it worse. I appreciate the vote of confidence, but it's probably best to keep it to yourself for now...\nJudge:\nI would advise the defense to think carefully before making any more sudden outbursts.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Magistry... (If I wasn't the bad guy before, I definitely am now!)\nNahyuta:\nNow, Mr. Ihmus. I would like you to think back carefully... ...before you testify next about where you were that night.\nWitness Testimony\n-- I Wasn't at the Inner Sanctum --\nIhmus:\nI was never at the Inner Sanctum, I tell ya!\nThat much I'm sure of, even with the fuzzy memory.\nBesides, it woulda been impossible to get there in the first place!\nBoy, you lawyers sure are scary!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it might've been impossible for him to get to the Inner Sanctum like he claims, but...)\nNahyuta:\nNow will you desist in trying to frame this innocent witness?\nGallery:\nYeah! I'd like to see you explain how he got up there!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Is it not time to end these cross-examinations?\nNahyuta:\n\"A moment of desperation leads to one hundred million years of torment.\" (Changed from ['A moment of desperation leads to 100 million years of torment.'] in the original release) It means that for each moment a sinner spends struggling to deny their sins... ...one hundred million years of torment are added to their time in hell. (Changed from [...100 million years of torment are added to their time in hell.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Khura'inism is the strictest religion ever!)\nNahyuta:\nAnd just so you know, you've already accrued two hundred million extra years.

(Changed from [Sure, what's another 200 million, give or take.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it's a big deal to me! I can't keep saying that the witness was there at the Inner Sanctum... ...if I can't prove it. The problem is, how am I going to do that?)\nCross-Examination\n-- I Wasn't at the Inner Sanctum --\nIhmus:\nI was never at the Inner Sanctum, I tell ya!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure you weren't there?\nIhmus:\nAll I'm sure of is that you're deeply skeptical! Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, are all lawyers always like this?\nNahyuta:\nMost certainly. They always try to pin crimes on innocent witnesses, without any proof whatsoever. They are no better than bacteria or viruses.\nIhmus:\nYikes! You mean he's contagious?! He's gonna give me... lawyer-itis!\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, this is getting ridiculous.)\nIhmus:\nWhew, that was a close one. He almost put me there at the scene of the crime when I wasn't even there!\nIhmus:\nThat much I'm sure of, even with the fuzzy memory.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou just said your memory was fuzzy!\nIhmus:\nI sure did. What's the big deal?\nPhoenix:\nI'll tell you what! Your testimony isn't very credible if your memory of the events is fuzzy!\nIhmus:\nOh, no worries there. My memory may be fuzzy, but I'm very clear on one thing!\nPhoenix:\n(Here we go again...)\nIhmus:\nIf you asked me whether or not I remember what I did that night, I'd say I do!\nJudge:\nIn short, you are confident that your testimony is true. ...Is that correct, Mr. Ihmus?\nIhmus:\nHar har har har har! Exactly! Guess ya don't get to be a judge for nothing! So, in closing, I can clearly say that I was totally not there!\nIhmus:\nBesides, it woulda been impossible to get there in the first place!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I wonder if it really was impossible for you to get to the Inner Sanctum...?\nNahyuta:\nIf you have something to say, just say it.\nPhoenix:\nCouldn't there have been another way to get there? A way that wouldn't attract attention?\nIhmus:\nNo, there isn't!\nPhoenix:\n(Which means, there is.)\nJudge:\nPerhaps the defense would share its theory with us.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't even have a wild guess, let alone a theory, though. Time to reach into my bag of bluffs!) To reach the Inner Sanctum without attracting any attention...\nHe climbed up the cliff\nPhoenix:\nNo one would've noticed if he had scaled up the side of the mountain. He could've snuck into the Inner Sanctum that way!\nIhmus:\nHar har har har har! The cliff face is all loose and crumbly 'round there. Even a pro mountain climber couldn't have made it up that way!\nNahyuta:\nEveryone here in Khura'in knows that. But let us forgive the defense's ignorance -- he is a foreigner, after all.\nPhoenix:\nW-Why doesn't anyone ever tell me these things?!\nIhmus:\nTough luck, lawyer! I couldn't have gotten up to the Inner Sanctum by scaling the cliff!\nPhoenix:\nArrrgh! ...Please add that to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus.\nAdds statement \"No one could climb up those cliffs.

With all those people at the plaza?! I don't think so!\nPhoenix:\nBut they were all completely absorbed in prayer. With a little stealth, you could've slipped by without drawing any attention!\nNahyuta:\nI am afraid that would have been impossible. During the rite... ...the gate to the stairs was locked tight from the Inner Sanctum side.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What?!\nIhmus:\nYeah! If I'd tried to force the lock open... ...someone there woulda noticed, even if they were deep in prayer!\nPhoenix:\nNngh! ...P-Please add that to your testimony, Mr. Ihmus.\nAdds statement \"The plaza gate is locked from the side facing the Inner Sanctum.\" if not already added or changes statement from \"No one could climb up those cliffs.

LAWYERS ARE SCARY!IT'S A SETUP! IT'S DEFINITELY A SETUP!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not trying to set anyone up! I-I'm going to provide evidence and explain exactly how it was done.\nNahyuta:\nThe gallery speaks true.

I'll still root for you, no matter how morally bankrupt you become!\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks a bunch, Maya...)\nIhmus:\nHar har har har har!\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Ihmus wasn't at the Inner Sanctum? Or more precisely, couldn't get there?)\nMaya:\nHmm... I don't see a way out of this.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, these kinds of debates only get worse if you argue them the wrong way. I'll have to pry some conclusive testimony out of him, and then present some evidence!\nMaya:\nLike when you're trying to catch frogs from a pond! Once you've got a grip on one, you'd better hold on tight!\nPhoenix:\nR-Right... Something like that.\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Ihmus is right. He couldn't have skydived down there without any gear.\nIhmus:\nWell now, finally come around, have ya? Now you see that I couldn't have possibly been there at the Inner Sanctum!\nPhoenix:\nRight. ...If you didn't have any gear, that is.\nIhmus:\nWh-Wh-Whaaat on eaaaarth are you talking about?!\nPhoenix:\n(That overreaction is a dead giveaway that I'm on the right track!) Take a look at this piece of evidence!\nJudge:\nThose are prayer flags, are they not?\nPhoenix:\nYes, but they have been sewn together... ...to create one big banner. A banner that could also function like a parachute!\nNahyuta:\nPohlkunka...!\nPhoenix:\nThe people of Khura'in are so used to seeing prayer flags... ...that the police didn't even think twice about these flags during their investigation.\nNahyuta:\nN-No, this cannot be!\nPhoenix:\nThe witness landed at the Inner Sanctum by using these prayer flags as a parachute! Is that not right, Mr. Ihmus?\nIhmus:\nThere's no way out. I'm surrounded!\nPhoenix:\nUm... Mr. Ihmus?\nIhmus:\nAll this talk's jogged my memory. I-I-I guess... I guess I WAS there at the Inner Sanctum after all!\nNahyuta:\nGrrrrrr...!\nPhoenix:\nAs I suspected, there WERE three people there that night!\nMaya:\nYou did it, Nick! You weren't wrong, after all!\nPhoenix:\nUm, thanks? Mr. Ihmus. You were the one disguised as Lady Kee'ra that night, weren't you?\nIhmus:\nWhaaa...?! N-No way, no how! Uhh... It's like this... Umm... Oh, yeah! I was only there at the Inner Sanctum by accident!\nPhoenix:\nBy accident?\nIhmus:\nExactly! And that thing's not a parachute. It's a homemade paraglider!\nPhoenix:\nA paraglider? Are you telling me you could fly using that patchwork mess of material?\nIhmus:\nIt may not look like much, but it's as sturdy as can be! I rode the wind like an eagle, going higher and higher from my earthly launching point! But then something happened that forced me to land at the Inner Sanctum!\nPhoenix:\nSo you just happened to land there? You expect me to believe that?!\nJudge:\nNow, now. Please calm yourself, Mr. Wright. However, the fact that the witness was at the Inner Sanctum is crucial testimony indeed. And it certainly warrants further explication. Therefore, let's continue with more testimony.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Why I Was at the Inner Sanctum --\nIhmus:\nThat evening, I was enjoying a trek through the night sky with my homemade paraglider.\nBut just as Mt. Poniponi was drawing near, something terrible happened!\nAn accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum!\nAs I landed, I banged my head, causing me to lose my memory!\nSo you see, I ended up at the Inner Sanctum purely by accident!\nNahyuta:\nMr. Ihmus, you failed to mention any of this during your pre-trial questioning.\nIhmus:\nCan't be helped! I mean, I'm just remembering it now!\nNahyuta:\nContinue such slipshod testimony and you will be cast into the Hell of Hangnails... ...where you shall have hangnails grown and ripped out for eight hundred million years.

This is my chance to rip his case to shreds!)\nCross-Examination\n-- Why I Was at the Inner Sanctum --\nIhmus:\nThat evening, I was enjoying a trek through the night sky with my homemade paraglider.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou were enjoying a trek through the night sky with your homemade paraglider? You didn't go to pray?\nIhmus:\nA devout Khura'inist like me can pray anywhere -- even while flying through the sky! But I wouldn't recommend you try it. You're bound to end up dead! Har har har har har!\nMaya:\nA paraglider? I didn't see anything like that!\nIhmus:\nThat's 'cause o' the ritual curtain! It blocked your view! You shoulda seen me, majestically soaring between the mountains!\nMaya:\nR-Really? ...What do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nD-Don't ask me.\nIhmus:\nHar har har! I was really enjoying that flight! At first, anyway...\nIhmus:\nBut just as Mt. Poniponi was drawing near, something terrible happened!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n...Something terrible happened?\nIhmus:\nExactly! And when I say terrible, I mean TERRIBLE!\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Was there something unexpected near Mt. Poniponi?\nIhmus:\nErr... What was it again?\nPhoenix:\n...Wait, you don't remember?\nIhmus:\nUhh... Let's just say it was terrible!\nIhmus:\nAn accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat exactly was this \"accident\" you had?\nIhmus:\nGood question. Now what was it again...? ...Wind? Oh yeah, it was the wind! And not just any wind, but a sudden gale force wind. Made me lose control.\nPhoenix:\nThe wind was strong enough to make you lose control?\nIhmus:\nYa got that right.\nPhoenix:\nOkay, then. Please add that to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"An accident forced me to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum!\" to \"Gale force winds came out of nowhere, so I made an emergency landing at the sanctum!\"\nIhmus:\nGale force winds came out of nowhere, so I made an emergency landing at the sanctum!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHad the wind been blowing the whole time around the mountains?\nIhmus:\nYep! Just the right amount o' wind for paragliding! So that sudden gale force wind was a real shocker!\nPhoenix:\nI see. So a decent wind had been blowing until then.\nIhmus:\nRight! A paraglider's not much use without a decent wind!\nPresent May 9th Newspaper\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"We have a saying in my country, Mr. Ihmus:\"\nIhmus:\nAs I landed, I banged my head, causing me to lose my memory!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhere at the Inner Sanctum did you land?\nIhmus:\nThat's easy! Where the paraglider ended up!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that makes sense. So, outside the ritual curtain, on the side where the moonlight shadows were cast.)\nIhmus:\nBut right as I landed, I hit my head on a rock! I lost both my consciousness and my memory! Haaar har har har har!\nPhoenix:\n(Something's seriously wrong with this guy.)\nIhmus:\nSo you see, I ended up at the Inner Sanctum purely by accident!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou're lucky to be alive after an accident like that.\nIhmus:\nYeah, I'm just a lucky kinda guy! It's times like these that separate the men from the boys!\nPhoenix:\nWow, I'd say you were incredibly lucky... Almost miraculously so.\nIhmus:\nIf ya got something to say, just say it!\nPhoenix:\n...All right, Mr. Ihmus. It wasn't an accident, was it? You landed at the Inner Sanctum on purpose.\nIhmus:\nWh-What the--?! No, it was an accident, I'm telling ya! You don't even have any proof! So stop making things up about me!\nPhoenix:\n(His testimony's like a moving target!)\nMaya:\nOkay, Nick! Time for some evidence. You know, really grab him by the scruff of his neck!\nPhoenix:\nO-One thing at a time, Maya. First, I have to find an inconsistency. (But where there is constantly changing testimony... ...there are bound to be discrepancies and other issues!)\nPhoenix:\nWe have a saying in my country, Mr. Ihmus: \"From one lie sprouts another.\" (Changed from ['One lie begets another.'] in the original release)\nIhmus:\nHuh? What's that supposed to mean?\nPhoenix:\nIt means someone caught lying will lie again in an attempt to conceal their first lie. In other words, this current testimony is just a blatant lie you're telling to cover your tracks!\nIhmus:\nWhat did you just say?!\nPhoenix:\nYou claimed gale force winds caused you to lose control... ...but this newspaper has the weather report for the day of the murder. It says, \"The area around the Inner Sanctum will enjoy calm, clear skies today.\"\nIhmus:\nP-P-P-Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaa!\nJudge:\nWhy, I do believe it does say that!\nMaya:\n\"From one lie sprouts another\"... That makes sense, but... (Chagned from [One lie begets another... That makes sense, but...] in the original release) Is it really a saying back home? I've never heard of it.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I kind of made that one up.\nMaya:\nFor real?\nPhoenix:\nYour Magistry! The witness's testimony contains another flaw -- one that's even more fatal to his cause.\nJudge:\nMore fatal, you say? The defense will explain himself at once!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Ihmus claims he was flying up around the Inner Sanctum with his paraglider. But it would've been impossible to get all the way up there without any wind!\nJudge:\nWhy, yes! I believe you're right! But we know the witness was at the Inner Sanctum, so... Mr. Ihmus! How did you get there?! And from where?\nIhmus:\n...........................\nPhoenix:\n(Without any wind, he couldn't have flown up there from the bottom of the mountain. By process of elimination... ...the only starting point that makes ANY sense is...!) Your Magistry, I believe I have the answer to your question. To reach the Inner Sanctum, Mr. Ihmus must have launched himself from here!\nPresent Royal Penitentiary No. 4\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Hoo-hah! ...Are you insane?!\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis was his starting point!\nNahyuta:\nDo you truly believe he arrived at the Inner Sanctum from there?\nPhoenix:\nYes! Positive!\nJudge:\nHmm... I fail to see how he could have reached the Inner Sanctum from there.\nPhoenix:\n(...Of course. What was I thinking?)\nNahyuta:\nYou are a fool. Such an answer is no better than what a monkey might offer.\nJudge:\nNow now, let us not be cruel. Even a monkey could point out a more probable location.\nPhoenix:\n(Great. Now the judge thinks I'm lower than a monkey.)\nNahyuta:\nSo, the lawyer was monkeying around when he claimed Mr. Ihmus flew down from above.\nPhoenix:\nNo, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. The witness DID fly down from above. With that in mind... To get to the Inner Sanctum, Mr. Ihmus must have launched himself from here!\nLeads back to examination\nIhmus:\nHoo-hah! ...Are you insane?!\nJudge:\nTh-That's where he came from?!\nPhoenix:\nIf he couldn't have come from below, the only other option is from above. So you see, A'nohn Ihmus came down from Royal Penitentiary No. 4! From there, he could have easily reached the Inner Sanctum by parachute! And that means he might have also killed the high priest!\nJudge:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Ihmus! Were you the third party at the Inner Sanctum?! And the one behind the warning to halt the rite that the victim received?! Was it you we saw in his final memory?! Are you the rebel hunter Lady Kee'ra?!\nIhmus:\nHOOOOOOOOO-HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, sir! Help me out here!\nNahyuta:\n..................\nMaya:\nYou did it! You finally left him speechless!\nIhmus:\nAw, c'mon, Mr. Prosecutor Man!\nNahyuta:\n...Quiet, you fool. You should use this time to prepare yourself for what is to come. For a fate far worse than Hangnail Hell awaits you now.\nIhmus:\n.........\nNahyuta:\nWell done, defense. I must concede this point to you. The witness did, in fact, descend to the Inner Sanctum from Royal Penitentiary No. 4.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? He didn't even put up a fight this time. That's awfully... generous of him.)\nNahyuta:\nBut if you are as perceptive as you seem, then surely you've already figured out the riddle. ...The riddle of A'nohn Ihmus's true identity.\nPhoenix:\nOh, umm... (His true identity? Not sure I know quite yet, but I guess I'll have to answer with something...)\nJudge:\n...It would seem I am the only one still in the dark here. Would the defense care to enlighten me? Who is this man we've been calling A'nohn Ihmus?\nPhoenix:\nThe witness's true identity is...\nPresent Wanted Poster\nLeads to:\n\"Is this really him?!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nHm? I fail to see how that shines any light on the matter.\nNahyuta:\nThat's because it doesn't. This piece of evidence has nothing to do with the witness's identity.\nPhoenix:\nI was just testing Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, to see if he really knew!\nJudge:\n...It seems you are the clueless one here, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Couldn't bluff my way out of that one... Hmm... If he was at Royal Penitentiary No. 4 before he landed at the Inner Sanctum... ...then he must be...!)\nJudge:\nUnless you wish to be removed from this Hall of Justice, I suggest you think carefully. What is A'nohn Ihmus's true identity?\nLeads back to:\n\"The witness's true identity is...\"\nPhoenix:\n(Is this really him?!)\nNahyuta:\nHmph. Only now do you realize the truth. Well? Please do share with us your belated insight.\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong, Nick? Why are you holding back?! (Changed from [What's wrong, Nick? Just say it!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nBecause this isn't going to be very helpful to our case...\nMaya:\nReally?! Are you sure?\nPhoenix:\n(Unfortunately, I've got no other choice.) That scruffy beard and shaggy mane completely threw me off. But it's all becoming clear now. The nighttime B.A.S.E. jump from the mountaintop prison... The precision landing at the Inner Sanctum using only a homemade parachute...\nIhmus:\n.....................\nPhoenix:\nOnly a paratrooper, or more precisely, a former paratrooper, could've pulled that off. This witness is Datz Are'bal -- prison escapee and key member of Dhurke's rebel group!\nJudge:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nIhmus:\nGAAAH-HAAAAAAH!\nJudge:\nThe witness is an escaped prisoner?!\nNahyuta:\nPrecisely. The police have been scouring every corner of the city to no avail. Meanwhile, here he was under our noses the entire time.\nIhmus:\nHoo-haaaaaaaaaaaah! Didn't think anyone would see through my clever disguise!\nNahyuta:\nHeh heh heh. But the witness's charade is not all that has been shattered. ...Is it, defense?\nPhoenix:\n(Boy, do I hate this guy...)\nNahyuta:\nPlease recall the defense's own words...\nPhoenix:\nWhoever sent it clearly meant to threaten the high priest. The letter said, \"Do not perform the rite.\" But the rite went on as scheduled. I believe that is why the high priest was murdered.\nJudge:\nWho do you suppose sent that letter?\nPhoenix:\nA person with something to hide -- the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra herself!\nNahyuta:\nHe claimed that the real killer was \"the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra.\"\nMaya:\nYeah, and what's your point?!\nNahyuta:\nWhat of the witness's true identity?\nPhoenix:\nOnly a paratrooper, or more precisely, a former paratrooper, could've pulled that off. This witness is Datz Are'bal -- prison escapee and key member of Dhurke's rebel group!\nMaya:\n*gasp* Oh no!\nNahyuta:\nHe is a rebel and an escaped prisoner. He could not possibly have been Lady Kee'ra, mortal enemy of the rebels!\nMaya:\nNooooooooooo!\nNahyuta:\n...Now, perhaps the witness will enlighten us to the truth. After all, he has yet to refute any of this.\nIhmus:\nHoo-haaah! Ya got me! I'm the razor-sharp fangs of the Defiant Dragons!\nDatz:\n...Datz Are'bal!\nNahyuta:\nWhen did you get your memory back?\nDatz:\nOh, around the time you guys were talking about there being no wind. But ya gotta gimme credit for making up all that testimony off the top o' my head!\nPhoenix:\nAre you prepared to tell us the truth now?\nDatz:\nWell, it's true I parachuted down to the Inner Sanctum...  ...but I banged my head on impact, and ended up unconscious outside the ritual curtain! In short, all my eyewitness testimony was a big fat lie.\nPhoenix:\nA big fat LIIIIIIEE?!\nDatz:\nOh, and by the way! Long time no see... Yuty!\nNahyuta:\n.........\nPhoenix:\n(Wait... They know each other?)\nNahyuta:\nYour Magistry. This filthy rebel belongs in a jail cell.\nJudge:\nOh, yes! Of course! Bailiff, seize him at once!\nDatz:\nSeems ya really have forgotten the will of the dragon, huh, Yuty. But I haven't. And no dogs of the Ga'ran regime are gonna lay a finger on me! ...Alley-oop!\nNahyuta:\nDeploy all available resources! I want all units placed on high alert!\nJudge:\nThe escaped prisoner... escaped again.\nNahyuta:\nThe police force has been placed on high alert. He will be caught before long.\nMaya:\nAn escaped prisoner who's escaped the law again after giving a ton of false testimony... Talk about a troublemaker.\nPhoenix:\nHe really pulled a number on all of us. (What was the point of all that, anyway?)\nJudge:\nWell, I can't help but feel that entire episode was an enormous waste of time.\nNahyuta:\n...Your Magistry. Perhaps it was not as great of a waste as you might believe.\nJudge:\nWhat makes you say that, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?\nNahyuta:\nDatz Are'bal dropped something as he made his escape from these halls.\nPhoenix:\n(Hm? That scrap of paper looks awfully familiar.)\nNahyuta:\nThese appear to be direct orders from Dhurke.\nJudge:\nFrom Dhurke?! The rebel leader?! Oh, but we only have a small corner of it...\nPhoenix:\n(Wait, I remember now...!) Your Magistry, I've seen that scrap of paper before!\nJudge:\nYou have?\nPhoenix:\nThe scrap of paper Datz Are'bal dropped is a part of this.\nPresent Bloodstained Letter\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"And this is...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this. This could be related to the scrap of paper Mr. Are'bal dropped.\nJudge:\nReally? Because I fail to see the connection.\nPhoenix:\nI suspected as much. Okay, on to the next piece of evidence.\nJudge:\nOne moment, Mr. Wright! We move on when I say it's time to move on!\nPhoenix:\nArngh, can't you let it slide once in a while? (I better carefully compare the scrap of paper Mr. Are'bal dropped to the evidence I have.)\nJudge:\nI will ask the defense once more. Where have you seen this scrap of paper before?\nLeads back to:\n\"The scrap of paper Datz Are'bal dropped is a part of this.\"\nJudge:\nAnd this is...?\nPhoenix:\nI found it at the scene of the crime. It appears to be a copy of the order that Mr. Are'bal dropped. If we put the two together, we should be able to read what the order says!\nJudge:\nOh, my! And just what does it say, Mr. Wright?!\nPhoenix:\n..................... I can't read Khura'inese.\nJudge:\nAh... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, if you please.\nNahyuta:\nThe ignorant lawyer has not bothered to learn our language? Very well, then... .............................. ...I do not understand.\nPhoenix:\nWell? Wh-What does it say?!\nNahyuta:\nUsing the lamplights as a landmark, he was to parachute down to the Inner Sanctum. Upon the rite's completion, he was to don Lady Kee'ra's robes and make his escape.\nJudge:\nWhat?! That is how he was to escape from prison?!\nPhoenix:\n(So, if I were to assume that Mr. Are'bal was the one who killed the high priest... ...then maybe it was because Abbot Inmee tried to thwart his escape plan...?)\nNahyuta:\nO foul lawyer... I'm afraid that is simply ludicrous.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? B-But I didn't say anything. (D-Did he just read my mind?)\nNahyuta:\nI know how your putrid mind works. Unfortunately for you, however, now that the rebel's escape plan has been revealed... ...it is clear that Datz Are'bal is not the high priest's killer.\nPhoenix:\nH-How can you be so sure?!\nNahyuta:\nIf only you would use that putrid brain of yours every once in a while. Datz Are'bal's plan could not have worked without the help of a certain individual.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What do you mean?\nNahyuta:\nI am speaking of Abbot Inmee, of course. Had Datz Are'bal simply donned Lady Kee'ra's robes and made his escape alone... ...he would have been far too conspicuous. But were he by the high priest's side... ...the faithful citizens praying in the plaza would have had no cause to suspect anything. It is, therefore, unthinkable that Datz Are'bal was the high priest's killer!\nPhoenix:\nAUGH!\nJudge:\nS-So then, you're saying...! The high priest was a...?! Oh, I cannot bear to say it!\nNahyuta:\nI am afraid it is so. He numbered among the rebels who threaten our kingdom.\nJudge:\nHow could this be?!\nGallery:\n...The high priest... a rebel?Th-There must be some kind of mistake!\nNahyuta:\nNahyuta:\n...Let it go, and move on. Accept the truth. It is the only way. And that goes double for you, defense. Cease your futile battle now.\nPhoenix:\nAnd why should I?\nNahyuta:\nBecause I will now put the final nail in the coffin of the accused. Now that we have eliminated Datz Are'bal from our list of suspects... ...there is only one person that still remains: the accused, Maya Fey.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHold it right there! Aren't you forgetting something important?\nJudge:\nSomething... important? Please do explain, defense.\nPhoenix:\nWe can't end this trial without looking into...\nThe arrow\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the arrow that was fired into the high priest's house?!\nNahyuta:\nIt was simply a means to deliver the warning letter to the victim.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...That's more or less the same conclusion we came to yesterday...) You know... I guess you're right.\nJudge:\nOh? Then THIS should be just about right as well! It seems there is no need to continue this trial any longer.\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Magistry. There is still something important that must be brought to light!\nLeads back to:\n\"We can't end this trial without looking into...\"\nThe murder weapon\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the murder weapon?! We haven't found it yet!\nNahyuta:\nWhat does it matter if it has been found or not? The fact remains that the victim was killed with it by the accused.\nJudge:\nI also fail to see how that would be important, Mr. Wright. This, however, is. It seems there is no need to continue this trial any longer.\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Magistry. There is still something important that must be brought to light!\nLeads back to:\n\"We can't end this trial without looking into...\"\nThe third party\nLeads to:\n\"I'm talking about the true identity of the Lady Kee'ra we saw in the S\u00e9ance vision!\nPhoenix:\nI'm talking about the true identity of the Lady Kee'ra we saw in the S\u00e9ance vision! If that wasn't Datz Are'bal, then who was it?!\nNahyuta:\nNahyuta:\nThat matter has already been resolved.\nPhoenix:\nIt has? (What's he talking about?)\nNahyuta:\nIt is as I have maintained from the start. There was no third party in the S\u00e9ance vision.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nB-But there was another Lady Kee'ra there besides Maya Fey! We all saw her!\nNahyuta:\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What the--?! I... I can't do my finger point!)\nNahyuta:\nHrnh!\nPhoenix:\nYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!\nNahyuta:\n...It is time to let it go, and move on. Your fate has already been sealed, much like your arm.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-This hardly seems fair.)\nNahyuta:\nIt is quite simple once you consider where the victim and the accused were at the time. If the victim was near the spring with his back to the accused, what would he see ahead?\nJudge:\nBesides the water itself... there is nothing but the warbaa'd statue.\nNahyuta:\nPrecisely. The Lady Kee'ra we saw in the S\u00e9ance is the warbaa'd statue draped in her sacred robes!\nPhoenix:\nN-NOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAY!\nNahyuta:\nThe accused wanted the false Lady Kee'ra to appear in the S\u00e9ance vision... ...before she came from behind and stabbed the victim with the dagger in a reverse grip.\nJudge:\nBut why would the accused want to do something like create a false Lady Kee'ra?\nNahyuta:\nTo show it to the victim as he was being slain.\nJudge:\nAnd what reason would the accused have to fool the victim she was about to kill?\nNahyuta:\nIt was not the victim she was trying to fool. ...It was this very court itself.\nJudge:\nCome again?\nNahyuta:\nSuspicion would not fall on the accused if it looked as if another Lady Kee'ra was there. And the defense was foolish enough to fall for it and claim it was a third party in disguise.\nJudge:\nAre... Are you saying...?!\nNahyuta:\nI am. It was all a cleverly wicked scheme, perpetrated by the accused. A scheme in which she sought to use the S\u00e9ance vision to mislead us!\nPhoenix:\n(This can't be happening!)\nNahyuta:\nWhat a face you are making, defense. I am surprised you are taking this so hard. After all, did I not clearly state a while back... ...that you were chasing after naught but a deluded fantasy?\nNahyuta:\nHeh heh heh... Something has occurred to me, you see. And your allegations of a third party are but a deluded fantasy.\nPhoenix:\n(You're telling me he knew this is how it would turn out all the way back then...? And that he was just waiting for the most effective moment to spring it on me?!)\nNahyuta:\nHeh heh heh. Do you understand now? I have had you dancing in the palm of my hand this entire time.\nPhoenix:\nIt... It can't be--!\nJudge:\nThis is an outrage! You took our royal priestess's sacred Divination S\u00e9ance... ...and used it to commit this most foul and despicable murder?!\nMaya:\nN-No! I did nothing of the sort!\nPhoenix:\n(Maya...)\nMaya:\nNick! It's not true! I... I didn't...!\nNahyuta:\nNahyuta:\nCease this ugly display. Your fate is sealed now that the facts have been exposed. Your Magistry. The time has come to convict this criminal who only seeks to taint this sacred hall.\nJudge:\nIndeed. It seems this trial is over.\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nDoes the defense wish to offer up yet another counterargument or something?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... The accused is... uhh... is not the killer! And uh... here's why... (Now what do I do!? I've got nothing!)\nJudge:\nIt would appear that the defense has run out of arguments to make.\nPhoenix:\n(I thought for sure that that rebel was the killer! The only person with a possible motive -- the one dressed as Lady Kee'ra -- has vanished. And I've got nothing to use against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's argument! Damn it! I can't lose now! Not like this!)\nJudge:\nVery well then, I shall now render my verdict.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait! Please, wait! I'm begging you!\nNahyuta:\nIt is time to let it go, and move on.\nJudge:\nThis trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then. This court finds the accused, Maya Fey... ...and the defense, Phoenix Wright...\nGuilty\nPhoenix:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\nBailiff:\nYour Magistry! Please forgive the interruption, but...\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of this?!\nBailiff:\nA body has been found in the Plaza of Devotion, Your Magistry!\nNahyuta:\n...What's this?\nPhoenix:\n(A body? What happened now?)\nBailiff:\nAnd we found this sticking out of the victim.\nJudge:\nWh-Why that's... Lady Kee'ra's Warbaa'd Dagger!\nGallery:\nLady Kee'ra! She has returned from the Twilight Realm once more!She has come to defeat the rebels!\nJudge:\nPeace!\nNahyuta:\nWell, it would seem the dagger that was once lost has now been found.\nBailiff:\nI have one more thing to report, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi!\nNahyuta:\nYes?\nBailiff:\nThis dagger... It bears the fingerprints of Maya Fey on it!\nPhoenix:\nWHA-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nMaya:\nB-But...\nPhoenix:\n(Why would Maya's prints be on it?)\nNahyuta:\n.............................. I cannot believe it, yet it must be true...\nJudge:\nIs something the matter, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?\nNahyuta:\nThis trial has run its course, and the accused's guilt has been firmly established. However... ...it would seem the defense was right about one thing.\nPhoenix:\nI-I was?\nNahyuta:\nYou claimed that the murder at the Inner Sanctum... ...had been carried out by the rebel hunter masquerading as Lady Kee'ra.\nPhoenix:\nI did say something to that effect, but what of it?\nJudge:\nProsecutor Sahdmadhi! A-Are you suggesting what I think you are?\nNahyuta:\nI believe the true identity of the rebel hunter who has been masquerading as Lady Kee'ra... ...is none other than the accused, Ms. Maya Fey!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat?!\nMaya:\nMeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?!\nJudge:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nNahyuta:\nI realize how shocking this must seem. Looking back, however, I now realize there was much that pointed to this fact. The rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra was first sighted about two years ago. And the accused first came to our kingdom two years ago as well.\nJudge:\nWh-Why, the timing matches perfectly!\nNahyuta:\nBut there is more... That warning letter was found in the high priest's bedroom three days before the rite. Despite his house being locked up tight that night.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHow does that prove anything?!\nNahyuta:\nNahyuta:\nIt is difficult to believe an intruder could have found a way to enter such a secure house. However, the accused was known to come and go freely there. ...Mainly to prepare for the Purification Rite.\nPhoenix:\nAh!\nMaya:\nAbbot Inmee was an important figure with a ton of duties, including training acolytes. He was really kind, even to a foreigner like me. He even invited me over to his house whenever I was between training sessions.\nNahyuta:\nThe accused could have easily left the house unlocked for herself without anyone noticing.\nPhoenix:\nNooooooooooooooo!\nLady Kee'ra's Warning updated in the Court Record.\nNahyuta:\nIf we assume that the accused was Lady Kee'ra... ...that more than establishes her motive for killing the high priest.\nJudge:\nYes, the victim was secretly an insurgent, bent on helping Datz Are'bal escape, after all.\nNahyuta:\nPrecisely. That made him a target of Lady Kee'ra's wrath. And after killing the high priest, she then unleashed her divine justice on another rebel. So, it seems the scope of this case has expanded. We now have... two murders perpetrated by Ms. Maya Fey, masquerading as Lady Kee'ra.\nJudge:\n.................. If Ms. Fey is indeed a serial killer, it would affect the severity of her punishment. In light of this, I believe this second murder must be investigated before we can proceed.\nNahyuta:\nAs you wish, Your Magistry. Maya Fey, I hereby charge you with this second murder. May your defiled soul feel the weight of your sins.\nPhoenix:\n(A new murder charge on top of a guilty verdict?)\nJudge:\nIt seems the defense will live to see one more day.\nPhoenix:\n(Talk about \"hanging on by a thread\"...)\nNahyuta:\nHeh heh heh. Come tomorrow, a far more terrible punishment awaits you.\nJudge:\nI hereby suspend these proceedings so that the second murder may be investigated. Until the conclusion of this new investigation, this court is adjourned!\nTo be continued\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThat statement is inconsistent with this piece of evidence.\nNahyuta:\nLet it go, and move on. Abandon this folly. You know very well your evidence proves nothing.\nPhoenix:\nNice try, but you can't make me give up. I'm going to prove I'm right!\nJudge:\nYou can point your finger as much as you want, but you're simply wasting your time. It is a pitiful sight to see a lawyer who doesn't know when he is beat.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I just need to hang in there a little longer.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nPlease take a look at this piece of evidence. Anything come to mind?\nNahyuta:\n............\nJudge:\n............\nPhoenix:\nW-Well...?\nJudge:\nHm? Did the defense have something he would like to say?\nPhoenix:\n(That fell on deaf ears.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nIs something the matter?\nPhoenix:\nSorry. That scream just sort of slipped out.\nJudge:\nI don't know about trials in your country, but we refrain from such rash outbursts here. Perhaps this will deter any future urges you might have.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not helping my case in the judge's eyes, both literally and figuratively.)\nPresenting incorrect sensation or Insight during Divination S\u00e9ance (on initial Insight)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Benevolence! isn't this statement inconsistent with the vision?\nRayfa:\nInconsistent...? I think not!\nPhoenix:\nExactly! That's where the inconsistency lies!\nJudge:\nNo, I believe it is in the defense's thought process that the inconsistency lies.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Guess there wasn't an inconsistency there after all...)\nMaya:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it, Maya?\nMaya:\nI'm... still trying to figure this whole Insight thing out. When the words change size... ...that means the intensity of those sensations is changing, too, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what it looks like to me.\nMaya:\nSo then... that's probably something we should keep an eye on, too. In short, we should be on the lookout for... ...changes that shouldn't take place, but they do anyway... ...and changes that don't occur when they should.\nPhoenix:\nHow very perceptive of you. (I guess all that training's sharpened Maya's mind along with her powers.)\nPhoenix:\nLet's compare the vision to the Insights, while looking for changes in sensory intensity!\nMaya:\nSounds like a plan!\nPresenting incorrect sensation or Insight during Divination S\u00e9ance (on all revised Insights)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Benevolence! isn't this statement inconsistent with the vision?\nRayfa:\nInconsistent...? I think not!\nPhoenix:\nExactly! That's where the inconsistency lies!\nJudge:\nNo, I believe it is in the defense's thought process that the inconsistency lies.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. Guess there wasn't an inconsistency there after all...)\nConsult (during a cross-examination, when evidence must be presented)\nMaya:\nLooks like you can't count on your bluffing skills to save your butt this time.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... This is a tough one.\nMaya:\nWell, to me, there's something about this one statement that seems off.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it does sound a little strange, doesn't it? Thanks, Maya. I'll take another look at the evidence.\nMaya:\nYou can always count on me!\nConsult (during a cross-examination, when statements must be pressed)\nMaya:\nYou're looking a little pale there, Nick. Are you all right?\nPhoenix:\nThis trial is really putting me through the wringer.\nMaya:\nMaybe it's just a matter of getting the information you need.\nPhoenix:\nRight... Thanks, Maya. (Guess I'd better keep pressing, then!)\nMaya:\nOnce you get more info, you can use it to make one of your famous bluffs!\nPhoenix:\n(She makes it sound like bluffing is my default move.)\nConsult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on initial Insight)\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nUm, I'm having a tough time spotting a contradiction.\nMaya:\nWell, there was one sensation that caught my eye. You know that footsteps sensation? Didn't something about it seem strange to you?\nPhoenix:\nNow that you mention it... Thanks. I'll focus on that as I review the Insights.\nConsult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on first revised Insight)\nMaya:\nYou're making that \"I-can't-find-a-contradiction\" face of yours again, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well... I'm kinda clutching at straws here.\nMaya:\nAnd I think we should focus on the sound of bells that were just uncovered.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. Let's focus on that sensation and take another look at Rayfa's Insights.\nConsult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on second revised Insight)\nMaya:\nYou look like you're having a tough time, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, because I can't find any contradictions. I mean, the sensations in the vision all seem perfectly fine to me...\nMaya:\nIn that case, why don't you read the Insights while focusing on what the victim saw?\nPhoenix:\n(Of course! His sense of sight! Time to go over those Insights again!)\nConsult (during a Divination S\u00e9ance, on third revised Insight)\nPhoenix:\nMaya... I can't find any contradictions.\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick. A bit early to throw in the towel, don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nBut I didn't notice anything wrong with the sensations that appeared as words just now.\nMaya:\nWell then, maybe the contradiction is in what Abbot Inmee saw. I think there's something fishy about the things that we can more clearly see now. Also... We should focus on not only the sensations, but the updated Insights, as well.\nPhoenix:\nRight. Thanks, Maya!\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThis trial need not be drawn out any longer. The defense has failed to counter the charge filed by the prosecution. In accordance with the law, I invoke the Defense Culpability Act against the defense. Now, then.

What's going to happen to Miss Maya now?\nPhoenix:\n...I'm worried about that, too. But right now...\nBailiff:\nI have one more thing to report, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi!\nNahyuta:\nYes?\nBailiff:\nThis dagger... It bears the fingerprints of Maya Fey on it!\nPhoenix:\nRight now, I need to focus on the next trial.\nAhlbi:\nThe murder of Acolyte Zeh'lot, right?\nPhoenix:\nAt least the jury is still out on that one, so to speak. (The two murders are most likely connected. If I can get to the bottom of Acolyte Zeh'lot's murder... ...it might give me the ammunition I need to overturn Maya's guilty verdict.)\nAhlbi:\nLet me help you investigate! I want to assist you any way I can!\nPhoenix:\nI appreciate it, Ahlbi, but we're talking about a murder.\nAhlbi:\nYeah, but it's going to be hard for a foreigner to investigate this on his own!\nPhoenix:\nYou have a point there.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I wish I knew what to do.)\nRayfa:\n.....................\nPhoenix:\n(Hm? Isn't that...?) ...Your Benevolence.\nRayfa:\n...............\nPhoenix:\nUm, Princess Rayfa?\nRayfa:\nHm? ...Oh, it is you again. ...The dead lawyer walking, guilty of abetting a murderer under the Defense Culpability Act.\nPhoenix:\nUrk! (I see she hasn't lost any of her charm.)\nRayfa:\n...........................\nPhoenix:\nWhy the long face? I thought you'd be glad I was found guilty under the DC Act.\nRayfa:\n...Hmph. I am in no mood to take joy in your suffering. For I was unable to defeat you, and had to leave the job to others. I failed in my sacred duty as the royal priestess.\nPhoenix:\nI guess that answers my question.)\nRayfa:\nHave I misunderstood... the voice of the mitamah... yet again? ...Th-This--! This cannot be!\nRayfa:\n..................\nPhoenix:\n(All I did was defend my client... Nngh... I can't bear to see her looking so sad like this, though...) ...Your Benevolence.\nRayfa:\n..................\nPhoenix:\nYour Benevolence!\nRayfa:\nHm? Oh, Barbed Head. I thought you had already begun your journey to the Twilight Realm.\nPhoenix:\nI'm not dead yet! I still have an investigation to do... for tomorrow's trial.\nRayfa:\nWhat's this?! D-Do you mean to say... ...you have not given up yet?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. I'm going to prove Maya innocent tomorrow.\nRayfa:\n............ But why? Why do you refuse to give up? I cannot fathom such obstinacy. Investigate all you want -- I care not!\nPhoenix:\n...You really don't mind? But aren't you worried that a lawyer backed into a corner by the DC Act... ...might do something desperate, like forge evidence?\nRayfa:\nWhat's this?!\nPhoenix:\nIf left unsupervised, I'd be free to do whatever I wanted, you know.\nRayfa:\n............Grrr!\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, now to see if she takes the bait.)\nRayfa:\nYes... I see your point. Barbed Head...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nRayfa:\nI know what happened yesterday. You perpetrated some sort of fraud or other misdeed while I was not watching!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nRayfa:\nThat explains why I misunderstood the voice of the high priest's soul! Yes, of course! That is the only explanation!\nPhoenix:\n............ (I was just trying to cheer her up. Now she thinks even less of me.)\nRayfa:\nI must not allow you to sully our sacred Hall of Justice with your misdeeds ever again. Therefore, today, I will be monitoring your every move once more! I will not fail to spot your misdeeds this time! The moment I see anything out of the ordinary, I will send you straight to prison. And you, boy. Do not throw your lot in with this foreign devil.\nAhlbi:\n...B-But... Your Benevolence!\nPhoenix:\nIt's okay, Ahlbi. You don't need to worry about me. I'll be back before you know it. (But first, I should probably lighten my load a bit.) Ahlbi, would you mind holding on to some evidence for me?\nAhlbi:\nOf course not! I'm always glad to help!\nUnnecessary evidence unloaded onto Ahlbi.\nAhlbi:\nMay the Holy Mother's blessings be upon you!\nPhoenix:\n(Now then... The scene of the crime is the logical place to start. If I recall correctly, the body was found at the Plaza of Devotion.)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nRayfa:\nThat boy has grown far too close to you. He will require re-education if he persists in befriending lawyers.\nPhoenix:\nRe-education? What exactly does that entail?\nRayfa:\nFirst, he must meditate upon Lady Kee'ra for forty-eight hours in the prayer pose.\nPhoenix:\nHow is that re-education? It sounds more like torture to me.\nWhat to do\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head! You have an investigation to conduct, do you not?! Get on with it!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, but... (Why does she always have to be like this?)\nRayfa:\nWhat? Would you have preferred that tour guide boy tag along instead?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?! Oh, umm...\nRayfa:\nHmph, it would appear I have read your mind most accurately.\nPhoenix:\n(That smile of hers is downright scary.)\nBazaar\nExamine\nWarbaa'd\nRAWWWRRR!\nPhoenix:\nAaaaaaah! What the heck was that?!\nRayfa:\nHonestly, what sort of grown man jumps at the call of a warbaa'd?\nPhoenix:\nWhat? That roar came from this bird? ...I-It is a bird, right?\nRayfa:\nW-Well... give me a moment! ...Nayna! The warbaa'd has many natural enemies. Therefore, it mimics a lion's roar in order to scare them away. But you did not know that, did you? And you call yourself a lawyer! Hmph!\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't know, either, until you asked Nayna.\nRayfa:\nEnough! You... You... lamebrain!\nYak\nRayfa:\nHave you never seen a yak before, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nOnly in zoos.\nRayfa:\nWell in Khura'in, they play an important part in our daily lives. Therefore, they must be treated with kindness and with respect.\nMOOOOOOOOO!\nRayfa:\nH-Hey! What are doing?! I command you to cease that at once!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... That yak is really licking and nuzzling the daylights out of Rayfa...)\nRayfa:\nFoul beast! You have made a mess of my royal raiment! For that, I shall make a leather coat out of you later!\nPhoenix:\nWhat was that about treating them with \"kindness and respect\" again...?\nProduce cart\nRayfa:\nWhy, this giah'pam looks positively delicious. I think I shall take this one.\nPhoenix:\nY-Your Benevolence! You can't just take things without paying!\nRayfa:\nShopkeeper! You will receive your payment from this barb-headed foreigner.\nLady:\nThank you, barb-headed foreigner.\nPhoenix:\nPeasants paying for princesses? This place is absolutely feudal.\nPoster\nPhoenix:\n(It's a poster... That's the Plumed Punisher, Khura'in's famous action hero. I guess we're not the only country with superheroes like that.)\nSteaming buns\nRayfa:\n........................\n*groooowl*...\nPhoenix:\n...Was that your stomach?\nRayfa:\nN-No! Th-That was not me!\n*groooowl*...\nRayfa:\nTh-That... was the cry of the warbaa'd!\nPhoenix:\nWould you like a magatah'man?\nRayfa:\nEnough! I am not hungry!\nPhoenix:\n(Why can't some people just admit when they're hungry?)\nMay 11Plaza of Devotion\nPhoenix:\nLooks like the police already finished their investigation. (To think someone would be killed here --  a place devoted to prayer. A body outline and... flowers? Did someone leave them here in memory of the deceased? Hm? And there's something different about the prayer flags today...)\nRayfa:\nAs the high priest's disciple, Acolyte Zeh'lot was utterly devoted to his training. First the high priest, and now his devoted disciple... Maya Fey will pay for this!\nPhoenix:\nAs I keep trying to tell you, Maya has nothing to do with any of this!\nRayfa:\nAnd you can prove this... how?!\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think I'm doing here?! Gathering dirt and dust for the trial?!\nRayfa:\nYou and your smart mouth! This is precisely why you and your lawyerly ilk are so reviled.\n???:\nHey, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nEma!\nRayfa:\nIt's that detective from your country again...\nEma:\nEep, it's the princess!\nRayfa:\nYou seem displeased that I am here.\nEma:\nOh, n-no, no! Don't be silly! Mr. Wright? I'm, uhh... I'm so sorry about what happened to Maya.\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault, Ema. You were just doing your job. And if I had just done mine...\nEma:\nMr. Wright...\nPhoenix:\n...But it's no use crying over spilled milk! Would you mind telling me what you know about the murder? It's do or die in court tomorrow. And I mean that literally.\nEma:\nGladly. I'll help in any way I can!\nRayfa:\nRemember, I have my eyes on the both of you, so see to it that you commit no misdeeds.\nEma:\nOf course not! Hmph, you're talking to a professional here.\nExamine\nBody outline\nPhoenix:\nAcolyte Zeh'lot died bent over in prayer. There's no trace of blood on the ground, though... The fact that there's so little bleeding could mean it was a single stab to a vital point. ...Not that that would've been very difficult, considering the position he was in.\nPrayer rug\nPhoenix:\nAcolyte Zeh'lot was killed in a prayer pose. With his head bent over like that, the last thing he saw must've been this rug.\nRayfa:\nIt is a prayer rug woven by devout monks. May the Holy Mother's blessing be upon his departed soul.\nPhoenix:\nIt's strange that there are no bloodstains, though...\nRayfa:\nHmm... Perhaps it was so cold, his blood froze. Or perhaps it was absorbed by his vestment.\nPhoenix:\n(It IS pretty cold. Maybe the blood really did just freeze inside his body.)\nFlowers\nPhoenix:\nSo these flowers were left here in memory of Acolyte Zeh'lot? What are they called?\nRayfa:\nThey are known as nahmanda, and they are given to express sorrow when a life is lost.\nPhoenix:\nIt seems offering flowers in memory of the dead is a universal practice.\nNahmanda Flower added to the Court Record.\nFlowers (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo these flowers were left here in memory of Acolyte Zeh'lot?

Umm, Your Benevolence? What does it say here?\nRayfa:\nThe dearest wishes of our subjects are written upon these prayer flags. Reading the prayers of others is considered rude, but if you must know... ...it says, \"At the usual spot. Bring grub. The key, too.\" Hmm, that is one of the more direct and practical prayers I have ever seen.\nPhoenix:\n...I wonder if it's even a prayer.\nBrand New Flag added to the Court Record.\nPurple prayer flag (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis prayer flag looks much newer than the rest.

How about starting with an overview of what happened.\nEma:\nSure. The victim is Puhray Zeh'lot. He was the high priest's disciple. His body was discovered around noon today... ...right after the rite wrapped up.\nPhoenix:\nSo, during the high priest's murder trial.\nEma:\nThat's right. Apparently, he had been here praying since the day before the rite even started. Talk about serious devotion.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... I barely lasted a few minutes.)\nEma:\nThis is a picture of Mr. Zeh'lot's body.\nPhoenix:\n(That dagger in his upper back looks like it would've been particularly painful. Hm? Is that a tattoo on the back of his neck? It's... peach shaped...?)\nEma:\nEveryone started leaving when the praying was finally done... ...but the victim remained bent over in prayer. And when they went over to check on him...\nPhoenix:\nThey discovered he was dead, right?\nCrime Photo (Zeh'lot) added to the Court Record.\nEma:\nYes. The estimated time of death is May 9, sometime between... ...the start of the rite and the discovery of the high priest's body. In other words, we believe the crime took place during the Purification Rite. And the murder weapon was the same ceremonial dagger that killed the high priest. The prosecution believes Maya came down the stairs after killing the high priest... ...and then stabbed Mr. Zeh'lot with the same dagger.\nPhoenix:\n(Circumstantial evidence does point to Maya, but...) What about the cause of death?\nEma:\nHe apparently died instantly from the dagger that was left thrust into his upper back. Here's the autopsy report.\nZeh'lot's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nRayfa:\nEstimated time of death, you say? How can you know such a thing? I want to know! ...Well, Barbed Head! Out with it!\nEma:\nOh, so the princess of the spirit medium kingdom is interested in forensic science?\nRayfa:\nHmph! I have no interest is science, forensic or otherwise! Nevertheless, I will someday be queen. As such, it would be wise to know what silly things the common folk believe in.\nEma:\nTsk! There's nothing silly about it! I'll have you know, even Prosecutor Sahdmadhi holds forensics in high regard.\nRayfa:\nDoes he?! Hmm... Perhaps I should not underestimate the power of science. Still, I suppose it is nothing much compared to the Divination S\u00e9ance.\nEma:\nShe really doesn't have an adorable bone in her body.\nPhoenix:\nEma, I think she's actually interested. Would you mind explaining it to her?\nEma:\n...I guess I have to now. ...Okay, there are many ways to estimate the time of death... ...but the most well-known method uses the change in body temperature.\nRayfa:\nInteresting...\nEma:\nBody temperature drops at a steady rate from the moment a person dies. That means we can tell how long someone's been dead by measuring their temperature.\nRayfa:\nHmm... I see, I see! That was quite enlightening. Barbed Head! Present your forehead now!\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Why?\nRayfa:\nHmm... You feel just a little over ninety-five degrees. It seems you are not dead yet.\nPhoenix:\nOf course I'm not!\nRayfa:\nHeh heh. It was but a jest. After all, you're still the dead lawyer walking.\nPhoenix:\n(I fail to see the humor in any of this.) Were there any witnesses? With so many people here at the plaza, you'd think somebody would've seen something.\nEma:\nYou'd think so, wouldn't you? But we haven't found a single witness.\nPhoenix:\nHow's that even possible?!\nRayfa:\nBecause everyone was bent over, utterly devoted to prayer, naturally.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right, the back-shattering pose that nearly killed me. Still, you'd think someone would've noticed something.\nEma:\nI thought so too, but... ...with the monk's scarf he had on, no one could see the dagger in his upper back. Plus, everyone was so absorbed in prayer, they didn't see or hear anything.\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe this.\nRayfa:\nWhat you choose to believe is your choice, but the fact remains there were no witnesses. However, there is one piece of irrefutable evidence. ...The dagger.\nEma:\nSadly, yes...\nPhoenix:\nArgh...\nThe incident (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nLet's see...

However, there is one piece of irrefutable evidence. ...The dagger.\nEma:\nSadly, yes...\nPhoenix:\nArgh...\nMurder weapon (appears after \"The incident\")\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about the murder weapon?\nEma:\nThe killer used the Warbaa'd Dagger, the legendary weapon of Lady Kee'ra. It was discovered impaled in the victim's upper back.\nRayfa:\nThe accused's fingerprints were found on the dagger, were they not?\nEma:\nY-Yes, they were.\nWarbaa'd Dagger added to the Court Record.\nRayfa:\nWith such irrefutable evidence, there is no questioning the accused's guilt.\nPhoenix:\nNot so fast. What about a motive? Maya had no reason to kill Acolyte Zeh'lot.\nRayfa:\nWhat do the police think about this matter?\nMurder weapon (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about the murder weapon?\nEma:\nThe killer used the Warbaa'd Dagger, the legendary weapon of Lady Kee'ra.

And since Mr. Zeh'lot was the disciple of the high priest, who turned out to be a rebel...\nRayfa:\nHe, too, was likely a rebel, and therefore met the same untimely demise as his teacher.\nEma:\n...Yes, that is how the police currently view this crime.\nPhoenix:\nThere's no way Maya is that Lady Kee'ra vigilante!\nEma:\nI agree on a personal level, but the police are just going with what today's trial concluded.\nPhoenix:\nNgrk! (I really blew it in court today.)\nPresent\nZeh'lot's Autopsy Report\nEma:\nBased on the estimated time of death, we believe he was killed during the rite itself. It appears he was stabbed in the upper back with a dagger and died instantly.\nPhoenix:\nBut there were so many people here. How could no one have noticed?\nEma:\nI know. I can't believe it, either. I guess they were just that focused on their prayers or something.\nWarbaa'd Dagger\nEma:\nMaya's fingerprints were found on the dagger that was used in the murder. The police are, therefore, investigating her as their prime suspect.\nRayfa:\nThe evidence is irrefutable, with no room for argument.\nEma:\nI really don't want to treat Maya as a suspect, but... ...based on the evidence and police reports I've received so far, it's not looking good.\nPhoenix:\n(Not good? More like, how could it get any worse?)\nAfter clearing \"Motive\" Talk option and examining prayer rug, flowers, and purple prayer flag:\nPhoenix:\nOkay... That message on the prayer flag seems a little weird, but...\nBefore clearing all Talk options in High Priest's House\nPhoenix:\n...I think I've seen everything there is to see around here.\nRayfa:\nYou have not found or heard anything of particular worth. Are you ready to give up?\nPhoenix:\nNo, I'm not calling it quits yet!\nEma:\n...D-Does it look like you have any hope of winning, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nEma... I can't really say at this point. All I know is I have to keep investigating.\nRayfa:\nWhat are you two sneaks up to? I would advise you to get back to work if you are done here, Detective. Otherwise, I will report you to Prosecutor Sahdmadhi for dereliction of duty.\nEma:\nI-I-I, I'm going, I'm going! Well, see you later, Mr. Wright. And good luck!\nPhoenix:\n(I should really pay a visit to everyone and every place connected with this case.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options in High Priest's House\nPhoenix:\n...I'm not sure it's related to this case.\nRayfa:\nWe have paid a visit to all of the people and places connected with this case.

Is it not time to give up?\nPhoenix:\nNo, there is still someone I need to talk to first.\nMay 11High Priest's House\nPhoenix:\nHello. I'm sorry to bother you again, but...\nBeh'leeb:\nOh, it's you.\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head! You are not contemplating casting suspicion upon Lady Beh'leeb, are you? She lost her beloved husband, and now Acolyte Zeh'lot, who was like a son to her.\nPhoenix:\nOf course, I'm not. But since she was close to both victims, I wanted to hear what she has to say.\nRayfa:\n...Very well.\nPhoenix:\n(And then there's the fact that Lady Kee'ra didn't attack Mrs. Inmee. That probably means she isn't a rebel.)\nBeh'leeb:\nIs this about poor Puhray? Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think I can talk about that right now.\nPhoenix:\n...B-But what about Maya? She's innocent.\nBeh'leeb:\nMaya? I heard she was found guilty. First, my dear husband, and now Puhray?\nPhoenix:\nMrs. Inmee, you don't really believe that Maya is the killer, do you?\nBeh'leeb:\nI-I... I don't know. But that was the verdict, so what else can I believe? What am I to do?\nPhoenix:\nThe verdict was already reached in your husband's case... ...but the truth of the matter is yet to be found!\nBeh'leeb:\nHow can you be so sure?\nPhoenix:\n...Because I believe that Maya is innocent. That is all I have right now -- my faith in her. So please. Help me understand what happened.\nBeh'leeb:\nSo you're... you're defending her based solely on faith? Even though you'll be punished for abetting the accused?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right.\nBeh'leeb:\n...A-All right, then. Your faith has moved me. I will tell you what I can.\nRayfa:\nA-Are you sure about this, Lady Beh'leeb?\nBeh'leeb:\n\"My lovely wife is also a devout follower of Khura'inism. As such, she is not one to make light of another's faith. But if I find that you have lied about your faith in Maya Fey's innocence... ...I shall curse your entire family and all your disciples for the next eight generations.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! Leave Athena and Apollo alone, buddy!)\nExamine\nPhoto frame near TV\nPhoenix:\nA photo of the high priest, his wife, Acolyte Zeh'lot, and Maya...

I mean, here she is posing with the two men whom she would soon kill.\nPhoenix:\nI beg to differ. I see this photo as proof that she didn't kill them.\nRayfa:\nHmph. That smile of hers does not fool me.

I don't suppose any of them could've possibly imagined what was to come...\nTalk\nPuhray Zeh'lot\nPhoenix:\nHow did Acolyte Zeh'lot end up living here as your husband's disciple?\nBeh'leeb:\nAbout two years ago, while my husband was at a spiritual retreat in the mountains... ...he came across Puhray collapsed on the ground. That's when he brought him here. You were always one to help those in need, weren't you, dear?\nPhoenix:\n...And he'd been living here ever since? (About two years ago... That's around the same time Maya arrived in Khura'in.)\nBeh'leeb:\nYes, he was born in a poor village and had nowhere to call home. My husband felt pity for the boy, so he took him in as his disciple. ...But not only as his disciple. He was like a member of our family, too.\nPhoenix:\nI see. (If this is where Acolyte Zeh'lot lived... ...there might be something I could learn about him lying around here.)\nThe day before (appears after presenting Family Photo)\nBeh'leeb:\nThis photo was taken during the Feast of Blessings.\nPhoenix:\nThe Feast of Blessings?\nBeh'leeb:\nYes. It is forbidden to eat during the days of the rite, so the day before it's performed... ...we enjoyed dishes full of gingihl, an herb known to strengthen the body and mind. You loved the gingihl-based dishes I make, didn't you, dear?\nPhoenix:\nGingihl... I heard you can go three days without sleeping after eating some.\nBeh'leeb:\nYes, but many foreigners don't care for it because of its strong smell. Our customs say that these dishes can only be eaten the day before the Purification Rite... ...and only between noon and 3 PM.\nPhoenix:\nThat's pretty specific. Is it because the smell is too strong?\nBeh'leeb:\nA very good guess, indeed. It is to ensure the smell is gone by the time Lady Kee'ra is welcomed the next day.\nPhoenix:\nWow, is it really that strong? (Come to think of it, the evening before the murder... ...an overwhelming odor was all over town. It was like a cross between garlic and mint.)\nBeh'leeb:\nAfter the Feast of Blessings, Puhray went over to the plaza to begin his supplication. I never thought that would be the last time I would see him.\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Maya doing at the time?\nBeh'leeb:\nShortly after Puhray left, she went to the temple to prepare for the rite. ...I don't know what she did after that.\nBeh'leeb's Statement added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nSo, Acolyte Zeh'lot went out to pray the afternoon before the rite? (According to the newspaper... ...on the day before the rite, the plaza was so cold, the whole place had iced over.)\nBeh'leeb:\nPuhray always prayed a lot -- far more than anyone I have ever known. He was a devout young man whose faith was twice as strong as others.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know why, but that's... kinda intimidating to me...)\nThe day before (subsequent times)\nBeh'leeb:\nThis photo was taken during the Feast of Blessings.\nPhoenix:\nThe Feast of Blessings?\nBeh'leeb:\nYes.

He has joined my husband in the Twilight Realm. He was so full of life before he went out to the plaza.\nRayfa:\nThis must be most difficult for you. It is like losing a family member.\nBeh'leeb:\nWhat's that, dear? ...Yes, you're right. I don't know what would've become of me if my husband were not here by my side.\nPhoenix:\nUmm...

I know he had been living under the care of Abbot Inmee at his home, but little else.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean like how they're letting me stay at the temple?\nRayfa:\nAre you seriously trying to insult the poor victim with your comparison, you filthy dog?\nPhoenix:\n(Hey! What was THAT comparison for?!)\nWarbaa'd Dagger\nRayfa:\nThat is the sacred dagger used in the Purification Rite. In using it for murder, the vile criminal known as Maya Fey shall be cursed for all eternity.\nPhoenix:\nNothing's been proven yet, so stop treating her like a criminal!\nRayfa:\nHow do explain the accused's fingerprints all over the dagger, then? And the fact that Abbot Inmee was slain with this very weapon?\nPhoenix:\n(I-I hate it when I have no comeback...!)\nAfter clearing \"Motive\" Talk option and examining prayer rug, flowers, and purple prayer flag in Plaza of Devotion and clearing all Talk options in High Priest's House:\nMay 11Detention Center\nMaya:\n...............\nPhoenix:\n(Maya sure looks tired.) I'm so sorry, Maya. I failed to defend you during that trial earlier today.\nMaya:\nI'm sorry, too, Nick. I never meant to get caught up in this whole mess. Even worse, I got you caught up in it, too, and you were convicted under that stupid law. Nick... You should really withdraw from this case. Maybe they'll even commute your sentence if you do!\nPhoenix:\nI-I could never abandon you like that! You might not believe me, but I'm going to pull off a win somehow.\nMaya:\nIt's not like I don't believe in you, it's just...\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry. Maybe this extra day in court is a blessing from the Holy Mother. Let's use it to our advantage. We'll turn this trial inside out and upside down! You'll see!\nMaya:\nO-Okay...\nRayfa:\n.....................\nPhoenix:\nYou're awfully quiet, Your Benevolence.\nRayfa:\nIt is only a matter of time until your executions are carried out. I simply thought I would allow you two a good talk before you depart from this world.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but we're not giving up yet. And we won't till the bitter end.\nRayfa:\nThere is no need to put on a brave face. Your fates were sealed with today's verdict. Worry not of Maya Fey. The Twilight Realm will cleanse the taint from that neophyte practitioner's soul. Then, perhaps, the Holy Mother may finally forgive her.\nMaya:\n...............\nPhoenix:\n(Wait... Was that her attempt at comforting me?)\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head, further resistance shall come to naught. Stop your desperate struggle. Accept the judgment that has been passed upon you.\nPhoenix:\n(She obviously doesn't know me very well.)\nRayfa:\nThen, perhaps, your sentence will be commuted, and--\nMaya:\nHold it right there, Your Benevolence. Why do you always have to be like that?\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya, what are you...\nRayfa:\nWh-What is the matter? I was simply showing some mercy upon your souls.\nMaya:\nNick here is risking his life to defend me.\nRayfa:\nAnd that is why I told you it will come to nau--\nMaya:\nNo, it won't! Nick is just doing what lawyers are supposed to! He's defending his client, no matter what!\nRayfa:\nEnough! There is no place for lawyers in the Hall of Justice! For we have the Divination S\u00e9ance!\nMaya:\nBut your Insights were wrong!\nRayfa:\nNnngrrrr...\nPhoenix:\n(Ooh boy, that's gotta hurt.)\nMaya:\nDon't you get it? Errors are bound to happen if your Insights are accepted without question. So I ask you, royal priestess: What is your true duty? Do the victims' souls or the Holy Mother herself wish you to judge people in error?\nRayfa:\nOooooh... You dare bring Her Holiness's name into this?! You know nothing, you... you... phony baloney!\nPhoenix:\nP-Please, you two! Enough already!\nMaya:\nS-Sorry, Nick. I got a little carried away. That's not really like me, huh? Aha ha ha.\nPhoenix:\nNo, I should be thanking you, Maya. It's good to have you in my corner.\nRayfa:\nHrrnh... How dare you mock me so! You will not get away with this! I was a fool to show you compassion. And to think I could convince you to accept your fate. So struggle all you want in the Hall of Justice tomorrow. You will receive your just desserts, as the scorn of our kingdom is heaped upon you!\nPhoenix:\n(...I can see straight through that contorted smile on your face, you know. *sigh* She may say these terrible things... ...but it's just the way she was raised, I guess.)\nExamine\nBell\nMaya:\nA guard will come running if you ring that bell there.\nPhoenix:\nReally? Let's put that to the test, shall we?\n*jingle, jingle*\nMaya:\nOh, but they got really mad last time when I rang it for no reason.\nPhoenix:\nYou could've told me that before I rang it!\nTalk\nZeh'lot's murder\nPhoenix:\nCould you try to remember what happened one more time?\nMaya:\nI've been trying as hard as I can... But I can't remember anything from the middle of the rite onward.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. You suddenly felt sleepy, and everything after that's a blank.\nMaya:\nEven so, I didn't kill anyone! And I'm not the one going around dressed like Lady Kee'ra! ...Although it's kind of cool to think there's a mysterious female vigilante out there.\nPhoenix:\nR-Right...\nPuhray Zeh'lot\nPhoenix:\nWere you close to Acolyte Zeh'lot?\nMaya:\nUmm... We met several times during the meetings about the rite. But I didn't know him very well. He seemed pretty quiet.\nPhoenix:\nDidn't you eat together the day before the rite?\nMaya:\nYeah! We ate this one super-stinky dish, but it was actually really good! I wasn't sure I'd like it, but it was love at first bite! Like... You know the salty noodles at Eldoon's Noodles? It's like if you added garlic and herbs to that, and then let it simmer for a really long time.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds more like a hot pot than ramen to me at that point...)\nMaya:\n*sigh* Now I miss ramen, too...\nPhoenix:\nUmm... so what was Acolyte Zeh'lot like while you were eating?\nMaya:\n...He seemed to be enjoying the food. But as soon as we were done, he left to go pray.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what did you do?\nMaya:\nOh, umm... I returned to the temple to prepare for the rite.\nPhoenix:\n(That coincides with Mrs. Inmee's description of events.)\nLady Kee'ra's identity (appears after \"Puhray Zeh'lot\")\nPhoenix:\nAny idea who might be pretending to be Lady Kee'ra?\nMaya:\nHmm... When the rite started, it was just me and Abbot Inmee.\nPhoenix:\nBut the S\u00e9ance vision showed a third figure who looked like Lady Kee'ra.\nMaya:\nI know... *sigh* Lady Kee'ra... I wish I could've seen her in the flesh.\nPhoenix:\nUmm, yeah... (Let's stay focused on the case, shall we?) It was supposed to have been impossible for a third party to enter the Inner Sanctum.\nMaya:\nAh! But what if she came from the sky? You know, like that bushy-bearded paratrooper! That mountain would've been no match for Lady Kee'ra's wings!\nPhoenix:\nThat's from the Plumed Punisher TV show, right?\nMaya:\nH-How'd you know?\nPhoenix:\nBecause the real Lady Kee'ra doesn't have wings.\nMaya:\nOoh! I've got it this time! There must be a secret room with a secret door at the Inner Sanctum! Did you know there are eighty-eight secret Plumed Punisher bases here in Khura'in?\nPhoenix:\nCan we please stop talking about the Plumed Punisher show for a sec, Maya?\nMaya:\nI guess so. *sigh* Keeping it real is much harder than it looks.\nPresent\nPlumed Punisher Strap\nMaya:\nIt's my Plumed Punisher strap! There's only one of them in the entire world! I'll treasure it for the rest of my life!\nPhoenix:\n.........Your Benevolence? I can't help but notice how hard you're staring at this strap.\nRayfa:\nM-Me?! Want that?! Sorry, but you are sorely mistaken!\nMaya:\nHey, Your Benevolence? Would you let me out of here in exchange for the strap?\nRayfa:\n....................................... ...What a preposterous idea!\nPhoenix:\n(It didn't stop you from entertaining it, though, did it?)\nLady Kee'ra's Warning\nMaya:\nNick, I'm not the one going around impersonating Lady Kee'ra.\nPhoenix:\nI know, Maya. I believe you.\nRayfa:\nOh, please. Dispense with this bungling act.\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to prove that Maya isn't Lady Kee'ra.\nRayfa:\nWhy bother? She is already as good as guilty. And floundering about will not change that fact.\nPhoenix:\nI don't care. I'll keep fighting until the very last crack of His Magistry's gavel!\nRayfa:\nHmph. You truly are...a nincompoop.\nCrime Photo (Zeh'lot) or Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report\nMaya:\nFirst Abbot Inmee, and now Acolyte Zeh'lot...\nRayfa:\nSpare me your crocodile tears. We both know it was YOU who slew those pious men!\nMaya:\nN-No, it wasn't me! Nick... How can we make her understand?\nPhoenix:\nProbably only by getting to the bottom of things in court tomorrow...\nWarbaa'd Dagger\nMaya:\nI can't believe the sacred dagger was used in a murder.\nRayfa:\nOnly a truly irreverent individual would dare do such a thing. And it was your fingerprints that were found upon the weapon. How do you explain that?\nMaya:\nI used the dagger during our rehearsals! That's why it has my fingerprints on it.\nRayfa:\nAnd how do I know you are not lying?\nMaya:\nUgh... Why won't you believe me?\nPhoenix:\nJust let it go, Maya. There's no changing her mind right now...\nFamily Photo\nMaya:\nWe took this picture during the Feast of Blessings... ...before all of these unthinkably tragic things happened...\nRayfa:\nUnthinkable? I doubt that. You were surely plotting your murderous rampage at the time.\nMaya:\nI was thinking of nothing of the sort -- especially not during that meal! The smell of gingihl was so strong, I couldn't think of anything else.\nRayfa:\nYes, well, it IS a rather intense aroma...\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... Do I even want to know how strong of a smell gingihl gives off up close...?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nWell, I should get going now.\nMaya:\n...Sorry I wasn't any help.\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry. I've got this. We'll beat the charges tomorrow and be on the first plane back home before you know it. Then we'll go grab dinner at Eldoon's, or your favorite burger joint! You pick!\nMaya:\n...Sounds good! I think I'll get the extra-large Hamburg steak topping on my salty bowl! Best of both worlds!\nPhoenix:\nYou can have whatever you like! (But first, I have to beat the charges.)\nMaya:\nAh! I almost forgot!\nPhoenix:\nAck! Wh-What is it?\nMaya:\nI have a favor to ask.\nPhoenix:\nOkay... But why are we whispering?\nMaya:\nI forgot I left something at the high priest's house. It's super important! Would you mind getting and holding on to it for me?\nPhoenix:\nSure. So what's this super important thing?\nMaya:\nIn my bag, you'll find a folding book. It's only given to the priestess who performs the rite. It's called the Tome of Secrets.\nPhoenix:\nThat does sound important. How could you leave something like that just lying around? (That explains all the whispering. If Rayfa found out, all heck would break loose.)\nMaya:\nLook, it's got Lady Kee'ra's real name written in it, so... Oops! Don't tell anyone I told you that! In fact, just forget I said anything at all! It's supposed to be a secret!\nPhoenix:\nThe Tome of Secrets contains... secrets? Imagine that.\nRayfa:\nHm? What are you two whispering about?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, n-nothing. It's just she forgot something, so I told her I'd go get it.\nRayfa:\n...You are up to something, I just know it.\nMaya:\nThanks, Nick! I'm counting on you!\nTehm'pul Temple, Plaza of Devotion, Inner Sanctum, Detention Center, or Bazaar\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nRayfa:\nSo, are you ready to give up, Barbed Head? Any more of this and you will cause Lady Inmee to suffer more than she already is.\nPhoenix:\nI understand what you mean, but I can't give up that easily. After all, I have to defend Maya in court.\nRayfa:\nStubborn fool. ...But you have already been found guilty. If you wish to continue floundering about, I suppose now is your last chance.\nPhoenix:\nI'll take every chance I can get.\nWhat to do\nRayfa:\nWhat? Have you given up already?\nPhoenix:\nNot even close! Still, it does feel like I'm barely treading water over here.\nRayfa:\nWater? Do all the people of your country go for a swim when they are troubled? If so, seek the rivers on the edge of town. There you will find all the water you need. Go ahead, paddle to your heart's content!\nPhoenix:\n(English idioms go right over her head.)\nMay 11High Priest's House\nPhoenix:\nHello? Anybody home? No answer... Mrs. Inmee's probably out right now. Well, I'll just get what I came for.\nRayfa:\nI am watching you like a warbaa'd, Barbed Head! You had better not steal anything!\nPhoenix:\nI would never do something like that! I'm just here to get what Maya asked for!\nRayfa:\nThen get on with it.\nPhoenix:\nI would if you'd stop interrupting me...\nExamine\nHandbag\nLeads to:\n\"Ah, here's Maya's bag.\"\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, here's Maya's bag.)\nRayfa:\nHm? What is that strange patch on her bag?\nPhoenix:\nIt's the Steel Samurai. He's the hero of an action-hero show back in my country. It's actually Maya's favorite show. She's got all sorts of merchandise related to it.\nRayfa:\nI see... He looks strikingly similar to the Plumed Punisher.\nPhoenix:\nThey are similar, but... (...the Steel Samurai definitely came first.)\nRayfa:\nI see... How interesting...\nPhoenix:\n(Rayfa seems genuinely intrigued. There must a common thread between Plumed Punisher and Steel Samurai fans. Come to think of it... ...didn't Maya mention something about trading with a Plumed Punisher fan? But I digress... I'd better find what she asked me to look for and get going.) Let's see here... This must be that Tome of Secrets that Maya was talking about.\nTome of Secrets added to the Court Record.\nRayfa:\nWell, Barbed Head? Are you finished now?\nPhoenix:\nHold on a second. The string around it is coming undone... Whoops! Oh...!\nRayfa:\nAHHHHH! YOU FOOL! Do not lay eyes upon it! Put it away! Quickly! Before we go blind!\nPhoenix:\nRelax. My hand just slipped.\nRayfa:\nThis is the Tome of Secrets! Are you trying to get us cursed?! Lady Kee'ra is liable to swoop down and gouge our eyes out!\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. This book is related to Lady Kee'ra, isn't it? Your Benevolence, would you mind if I asked you some questions?\nRayfa:\nHmph...\nExamine\nHandbag\nRayfa:\nWhat is that strange patch on her bag again?\nPhoenix:\nIt's for the Steel Samurai, this action hero back in my country.\nRayfa:\nIt looks so similar to the Plumed Punisher -- strikingly so. Hmm, I see... \"The Steel Samurai\"...\nPhoenix:\nYou're actually interested in it, aren't you?\nRayfa:\nWh-Whatever gave you that idea?!\nMove\nRayfa:\nWhere do you think you are going, Barbed Head? Were you not the one who said you wished to speak with me?\nPhoenix:\n(I better stay here and talk to Rayfa for now.)\nTalk\nTome of Secrets\nRayfa:\nThis is not something I would normally speak about to an outsider such as you.\nPhoenix:\nWell, can't you make an exception?!\nRayfa:\nIf you insist... Nayna! What of this folding book? ...Yes, I see... This very important tome is bestowed upon the priestess in the Purification Rite.\nPhoenix:\n*gulp* Very important? Wh-What's written inside?\nRayfa:\nYes, yes... Yes, I see... ...Really? Is it all right to reveal that?\nPhoenix:\n...Um, uhhh... Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nPatience, patience! The book contains Lady Kee'ra's true name.\nPhoenix:\nHer true name? Is a name really that important of a secret?\nRayfa:\nTo a Khura'inist priestess, a person's name is one of the most important things to know.\nLady Kee'ra's real name (appears after \"Tome of Secrets\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat's so important about a name?\nRayfa:\nWithout a name, a priestess's voice will fail to reach a person's mitamah. It is much like trying to send a letter without the recipient's address. A spirit can only be identified once you know the deceased's face and name.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I get it. It's like when you see someone in a crowd you recognize, but you don't know their name. It makes it impossible to get their attention.\nRayfa:\nIndeed. You must know a spirit's face and true name before you can commune with it. It is the same for Khura'inism's most secret art, one that my mother alone may use.\nPhoenix:\nThe queen has a secret art?\nRayfa:\nHmph, it is something a foreigner such as you could never hope to guess.\nMaya:\nIn Khura'inism, spirit channeling is a secret art that can only be performed by the queen. No one else is supposed to be able to do it.\nPhoenix:\n(I should pretend this is all new to me. Besides, I get the feeling she secretly really wants to tell me all about it.)\nThe queen's secret art (appears after \"Lady Kee'ra's real name\")\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about this secret art of the queen you spoke of?\nRayfa:\nCome again?\nPhoenix:\nOh, sorry. Maybe we shouldn't talk about this. It IS a secret after all, right?\nRayfa:\nIt is the secret art of spirit channeling. But I suppose those words are meaningless to you.\nPhoenix:\nI'm just surprised how willing you are to tell me about it.\nRayfa:\nA third-rate lawyer could not channel spirits simply by learning of the technique.\nPhoenix:\n(Third-rate is a bit harsh. I'd even settle for second.)\nRayfa:\nWhat is it? You have the look of a tentacled hag frog upon your face.\nPhoenix:\n(What the heck is a tentacled hag frog?!) ...Spirit channeling... That's where a medium lets a spirit possess her body to return to our world, right?\nRayfa:\nWell now. I see you have done your homework.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I guess I studied a bit. Eh heh.\nRayfa:\nWith the power of spirit channeling, one can bring back even the most ancient of spirits! It is quite a magnificent power, is it not?\nPhoenix:\n(I've never seen her eyes light up like this before.) I imagine they're pretty shocked when they come back from ancient times.\nRayfa:\nIndeed. A spirit's memory is cut off at the moment of death.\nPhoenix:\nSo even a spirit that is brought back after centuries doesn't sense any gap in time... ...between the moment of its death, and the moment it is channeled?\nRayfa:\nYes, and yet, it clearly recalls all of the memories it had in life. Thus, even heroes and scholars of antiquity can be channeled and directly learned from. Our queens have also used this power to help the rulers of neighboring lands seek counsel. That is why we have never been invaded, and how we have maintained our unique culture.\nPhoenix:\nSo, spirit channeling is a really effective tool for international politics.\nRayfa:\nIt is, indeed. And that is why only those with the power to channel spirits may rule our kingdom. But of late, there has been an endless influx of illegal immigrants from neighboring lands. The fools come seeking the same great power as my mother.\nPhoenix:\nIllegal immigrants?\nRayfa:\nYes. It is becoming quite a problem. Some have lost their way in life, and look to Khura'inism for their salvation. Among them are also those of dubious nature, who have been driven from their own lands.\nPhoenix:\n(Dubious nature... Driven from their own land... Gaspen Payne definitely fit that bill. But they sure weren't treating him like an illegal alien.)\nRayfa's spiritual power (appears after \"The queen's secret art\")\nLeads to:\n\"Can you channel spirits, Your Benevolence?\"\nPresent\nTome of Secrets\nRayfa:\nYou fool! Why have you put the Tome of Secrets before me?!\nPhoenix:\nWhat's the big deal?\nRayfa:\nS-Stay back! Come no closer!\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, this thing's actually pretty useful!) Lookie here, Your Benevolence. It's the Tome of Seeecrets.\nRayfa:\nIf you do not desist this instant, I shall have you put to death for the crime of blasphemy!\nPhoenix:\nUrk! S-Sorry! (...If looks could kill, I'd already be dead.)\nPhoenix:\nCan you channel spirits, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nI am but the royal priestess. There is still much that I must learn. As of now, the Divination S\u00e9ance takes me to the very limit of my ability.\nPhoenix:\n(So, her spiritual power doesn't measure up to Maya's.)\nRayfa:\n...You were just mocking me in your mind, weren't you?\nPhoenix:\nD-Don't be ridiculous!\nRayfa:\nIt is written all over your face! You... impudent nincompoop! The Divination S\u00e9ance was once one of the important roles fulfilled by the queen. That is what my mother taught me when I was little.\nPhoenix:\n(So the queen can perform the Dance of Devotion? That'd be a sight to see.)\nRayfa:\nSomeday, I will be a powerful priestess and queen, just like my mother. And the Divination S\u00e9ance is a vital part of my training to prepare me for that day!\nPhoenix:\nF-Forgive my ignorance, Your Benevolence.\nRayfa:\nHmph, you shall see. It will not be long before I, too, master the secret art of spirit channeling! I will be a magnificent queen who unites her people for the greater good of Khura'in!\nPhoenix:\n(Now I see... Spirit channeling is something she really aspires to.)\nMaya:\nI'm going to ace that test and become the next master! After all, I can't let my clan and the other villagers down.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like she actually has something in common with Maya.)\nRayfa:\nAre you quite through now? There are more important things to do than to stand here and talk about spirit channeling.\nPhoenix:\n(That's true. It doesn't have anything to do with this case, as far as I can tell. Or does it...?) Umm... If the queen is a spirit medium...\nRayfa:\nAre you about to suggest that my mother was channeling Lady Kee'ra?\nPhoenix:\nAck! (I guess she saw that one coming.)\nRayfa:\nHmph, lawyers are indeed a witless breed! On the day of the rite, my mother was engaged in other duties at the palace.\nPhoenix:\nOf course...\nRayfa:\nMy mother is a very busy woman. And the idea itself is preposterous. Do you truly believe the queen of Khura'in would personally battle the insurgents? This is precisely what makes you third-rate!\nPhoenix:\nUrk! (Another dead end! This is bad!) A-Anyway, I need to continue looking for leads, so...\n???:\nOver there! After him! Don't let him escape!\nRayfa:\nWhat is all that racket? What? That escaped prisoner has surfaced here in town?\nPhoenix:\nEscaped prisoner? You mean... that guy with the bushy beard?\nRayfa:\nThere is no reason to panic. The police are on his trail.\nPhoenix:\n(He's no longer a suspect... But he might know something, considering he was at the scene of the crime.) Let's go take a look!\nRayfa:\nWait!\nMay 11Khura'in - Bazaar\nPhoenix:\n*huff* *puff* Oww, my aching back. I forgot how badly I'd injured it. Ow, ow, ow... I need to do some stretching and exercise more when I get back home.\n???:\nAh, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n*huff* *puff* ...H-Hey, Ahlbi. Datz... Are'bal... Have you seen hi-- Ow, ow, ow!\nAhlbi:\nA-Are you all right, sir?\nPhoenix:\nOne second... *huff* *puff* *wheeeeeze* Have you seen... that escaped prisoner around here?\nAhlbi:\nOh, so that's why all those police came rushing over here. I heard them saying something about an escaped prisoner disappearing in this area.\nPhoenix:\nHe disappeared in this area? He couldn't have taken to the air again, could he?\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head! *huff* *huff* I told you to wait!\nPhoenix:\nIt's too dangerous for you around here, Your Benevolence. Mr. Are'bal could be lurking nearby!\nRayfa:\nWhat sort of a princess would I be if all it took was an escaped prisoner to frighten me?!\nPhoenix:\n(She's fearless, I'll give her that.) I can't be responsible if something happens to you. (As long as I'm here, though, I might as well search the area myself. Hmm... If I were an escaped prisoner, where would I hide?)\nExamine\nManhole\nPhoenix:\nThat manhole cover... It's open!\nShah'do:\nRuff, ruff, ruff, ruff!\nAhlbi:\nWhoa! What is it, Shah'do?!\nPhoenix:\nDid he sniff out someone or something in the manhole? (Hmm, I wonder...) Could Shah'do track Mr. Are'bal if he had something with the rebel's scent on it?\nAhlbi:\nI-I don't know...\nPhoenix:\n(I feel like I've got something with Mr. Are'bal's scent on it... Something he might've touched...)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nPhoenix:\nHave you noticed anything around here?\nAhlbi:\nI haven't seen the escaped prisoner. But I did notice how slow you run, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(It's just the high elevation. I'm out of breath before I know it!)\nWhat to do\nAhlbi:\nThe police said the escaped prisoner vanished right around here.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, there aren't any really good hiding places, so where could he have gone?\nAhlbi:\nMaybe he melted into the crowd.\nPhoenix:\nYou should be careful, Your Benevolence.\nRayfa:\nYou need not tell me that! I am not a child, after all!\nPhoenix:\nOkay, okay...\nPresent\nPlumed Punisher Strap\nAhlbi:\nThat is THE Plumed Punisher strap. There's only one in the entire world!\nPhoenix:\nOh, do you know a lot about the Plumed Punisher?\nAhlbi:\nOf course! She's a real hero to the people!\nPhoenix:\nThe ratings for the show must be through the roof.\nAhlbi:\nThey are! It reached 100 percent viewership at one point!\nPhoenix:\nOne hundred percent?!\nAhlbi:\nWell, when there's only one TV channel in the entire kingdom...\nPhoenix:\nOh, that explains it.\nWarbaa'd Dagger\nAhlbi:\nThat's the dagger that was used in the rite. It's said that Lady Kee'ra once wielded it. In addition to that dagger, there are many other items that are said to have been hers.\nPhoenix:\nReally? Like what?\nAhlbi:\nThere's the obvious stuff, like swords, spears, and other weapons. But there are other, more interesting items, like her favorite hat and her favorite pillow.\nPhoenix:\nHer pillow...?\nAhlbi:\nYes. They say if you use it, Lady Kee'ra will ensure you have a restful slumber.\nPhoenix:\nAs long as it's not eternal...\nBrand New Flag (after examining manhole)\nLeads to:\n\"Here, Shah'do. How about this?\"\nPhoenix:\nHere, Shah'do. How about this? I hope it works...\nShah'do:\nGrrr... Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff!\nPhoenix:\nI think he's picked up a scent! You mind if I borrow Shah'do for a bit?!\nAhlbi:\nBy all means! I had no idea you could do this! Yeah! Go get 'im, boy!\nShah'do:\nRuff, ruff, ruff!\nPhoenix:\nYour Benevolence, I'm heading down the manhole now. It could be dangerous, so please wait here!\nRayfa:\nWait!\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry, I won't commit any of those misdeeds you're so worried about.\nRayfa:\nThat is not what I fear! There may be a vicious insurgent lurking down there!\nPhoenix:\nOh, are you worried about me?\nRayfa:\nNo. I was simply wondering why you would go to such lengths in your investigation. After all, if you would simply withdraw from this case, they might commute your sentence.\nPhoenix:\nI'm doing this to prove Maya innocent.\nRayfa:\nBut how can you be so sure of the accused's innocence?! She has already been found guilty!\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry. Maybe this extra day in court is a blessing from the Holy Mother. Let's use it to our advantage. We'll turn this trial inside out and upside down! You'll see!\nMaya:\nO-Okay...\nPhoenix:\nI believe in her. If she says she's innocent, then that means she's innocent. Lawyers must trust in their clients to the bitter end. That's just what we do.\nRayfa:\n......... You... lamebrain. Do what you will!\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'm going in! Let's go, Shah'do!\nShah'do:\nRuff, ruff!\nAhlbi:\nBe careful!\nShah'do!:\nRuff, ruff!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait! Come back here! It's pitch black down here. I can't see a thing.\n*WHAM*\nPhoenix:\nAaagh!\nPhoenix:\nOoogh... Owww owww owwww... What happened? I went down into the manhole, and then...\n???:\nOh, ya finally came to?\nPhoenix:\nAh! (I'd remember that face anywhere! And that dragon symbol on his armband... That's the mark of the rebels! There can be no mistake! It's him -- Datz Are'bal!) YIKES!\nDatz:\nSorry I got a little rough with ya back there. Thought ya were the cops. Why ya making that face? ...Hey, want an apple?\nPhoenix:\n(Whew...I thought he was going to kill me.) I-I'll pass on the apple, but thanks. (I don't mind a good apple, but not right now.) What is this place?\nDatz:\nThis is the office of my brother in arms, Dhurke! But right now, we're using it as a rebel safe house!\nPhoenix:\nWait, back up a sec. What kind of office is this exactly?\nDatz:\nA law office, what else?!\nPhoenix:\nReally?! Dhurke used to be a lawyer?!\nDatz:\nYep! Just like you!\nPhoenix:\n(Khura'in's public enemy number one is an ex-lawyer? Didn't see that coming.)\nDatz:\nBut I don't suppose I'll be coming 'round here anymore.\nPhoenix:\nYou won't? Are you planning to flee or something?\nDatz:\nIt's just... I wanna get outta the rebel business. Tired o' being hounded by the cops and all that. So I came by today to pick up the last o' my stuff.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really...?\nDatz:\nI'm gonna sell Dhurke's info to the minister o' justice, then slip outta Khura'in!\nPhoenix:\n...W-Wait a second! You're a key person of interest in this case! You can't go running off like that!\nDatz:\nRelax, will ya? I'll tell ya whatever ya need to know. Oh, and sorry about punching your lights out back there. My bad! So, Mr. Lawyer Man, whaddaya wanna know?\nPhoenix:\nTell me about the murders of the high priest Tahrust Inmee, and his acolyte Puhray Zeh'lot.\nDatz:\nSure, I'll tell ya whatever I can. Don't know if it'll be much help, though. I mean, I'm not a rebel anymore, so...\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder how true that really is...)\nExamine\nPicture of Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in\nPhoenix:\n(There's a knife driven deep into a photo of the queen. I guess the rebels really hate her. I better remember to stay on their good side.)\nWhite flowers\nPhoenix:\nIncense and white flowers... (The flowers are still fresh. They must've been put here maybe today or yesterday.) Did you put these here, Mr. Are'bal?\nDatz:\n...Something wrong with flowers?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no!\nDatz:\nIt's just a traditional thing here in Khura'in. Pay it no mind.\nLadder\nPhoenix:\nThere's a ladder leading underground. He must've brought me in through there. But there's no reason for me to leave yet. I should see what else Mr. Are'bal has to say.\nPhotos\nPhoenix:\nThis looks like a photo of Dhurke and his compatriots... And here's one that looks really old... Wow, this was taken about twenty years ago.\nDatz:\nThose are Dhurke's sons.\nPhoenix:\nReally? So this is the rebel Dhurke in the center? He doesn't look so evil. And both of his sons... look kind of familiar...\nDatz:\nThe one on the left is Yuty. Oh, but you know him as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.\nPhoenix:\nP-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi is Dhurke's son?!\nDatz:\nThat he is! Yuty was once a rebel, too! He used to really respect his old man... ...both as a father and as a lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nThen why'd he become a prosecutor?\nDatz:\nBeing a lawyer in this kingdom is the same as signing your own death warrant.\nPhoenix:\nOn account of the Defense Culpability Act, right?\nDatz:\nYeah. That's why Yuty decided to be a prosecutor instead. He wanted to spark a revolution from the inside, so he dove right into the enemy's den!\nPhoenix:\nI would've never guessed it, looking at him now.\nDatz:\nYou can say that again. Dhurke is battling to change Khura'in's legal system. The will of the dragon spurs him on. We all thought Yuty was taking up the mantle to carry on that will, too... We were sure he'd help overthrow Ga'ran one day, but... As you've seen, he now uses the law to do her bidding. Dhurke's been beside himself.\nPhoenix:\n(So he no longer carries the will of the dragon in him, huh... I wonder what happened between father and son for it to come to this?) What about the other child in the photo?\nDatz:\nThat's Dhurke's adopted son, but he's gone back overseas. His name's Apollo.\nPhoenix:\n(Apollo? Wait a second... That bracelet... It really IS Apollo!)\nDatz:\nHe was a rascal, that one! And his voice could shake the entire room! I imagine he's out there raising high hell somewhere!\nPhoenix:\nHa, aha ha... Yes, I'm sure he's doing just fine. (Considering how far he's come, Mr. Are'bal's description really doesn't do Apollo justice!)\nPhoenix:\n............Apollo! I've been watching you grow over these past two years. That's why I know you're ready, why I know I can leave Trucy and the office to you. ...I believe in you, Apollo.\nApollo:\n...Thank you! I'll... I'll be fine! Everything will be fine!\nPhoenix:\n(He's a responsible young man now. He never lost that loud voice, though.)\nPhotos (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis looks like a photo of Dhurke and his compatriots... And here's one that's really old...\nDatz:\nThose are Dhurke's sons. The one on the left is Prosecutor Sahdmadhi when he was younger. I used to call him Yuty. Thought he'd carry on the will of the dragon and become a fine lawyer, but...\nPhoenix:\nAnd the other child is...?\nDatz:\nThat's Dhurke's adopted son, but he's gone back overseas. His name's Apollo.\nPhoenix:\n(That name, and that bracelet... Yep, that has to be our Apollo.)\nDatz:\nHe was a rascal, that one! And his voice could shake the entire room! I imagine he's out there raising high hell somewhere!\nPhoenix:\nHa, aha ha... Yes, I'm sure he's doing just fine. (Considering how far he's come, Mr. Are'bal's description really doesn't do Apollo justice!)\nLizards\nPhoenix:\nWhat are these hanging here? Lizards? ...If so, they're pretty big.\nDatz:\nThose're sewer lizards! We call 'em that 'cause they live in the sewer! They grow bigger than your average lizard, which makes 'em fine eating!\nPhoenix:\nWait, you eat these?\nDatz:\nWhat else would ya do with 'em?! Here, try one!\nPhoenix:\nPass! I'll definitely pass!\nDatz:\n...You're missing out on a fine treat, my man!\nPhoenix:\nS-Somehow, I think I'll live without it.\nFood on table\nPhoenix:\n(There are bowls and platters of food here. ...They're still warm, as if this was all recently prepared.) You must have a pretty big appetite, Mr. Are'bal.\nDatz:\nHar har har har har! Guys as big and strong as me... Got even bigger appetites, y'know!\nPhoenix:\nBut you just fled from the police. I don't know how you could eat this much after all that excitement. Ack! S-Sorry if I offended you!\nDatz:\nBut first, let's start with an apple-tizer!\nPhoenix:\n(Where's he getting all those apples from?!)\nDatz:\nWanna join me, Mr. Lawyer Man? Got plenty of sewer lizards, too!\nPhoenix:\nT-Thanks, but I already ate.\nCoat\nPhoenix:\nIs that coat yours, Mr. Are'bal?\nDatz:\nNah, it belongs to the rebel leader Dhurke.\nPhoenix:\nIt's pretty impressive. I like the color, too.\nDatz:\n...Wanna try it on?\nPhoenix:\nReally? You sure it's okay?\nDatz:\nOf course. Bet it would look great on ya!\nPhoenix:\nWell then, don't mind if I do... ......... Ack! It smells all moldy!\nDatz:\nHaaaar har har har har! I can't believe ya fell for it! Haaar haaar! That thing's been hanging there forever!\nPhoenix:\n(Note to self: Don't trust this guy ever again.)\nSign\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this thing with the dragon on it? Some kind of a sign?\nDatz:\nYep. That was his business sign back when this was Dhurke's office.\nPhoenix:\nHe used to be a lawyer, right?\nDatz:\nThat he was, but it was a really long time ago. This place has seen better days, that's for sure.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I hope he can put his sign back up someday.\nDatz:\n.........I wouldn't hold my breath.\nTV or refrigerator\nPhoenix:\nYou guys get electricity?\nDatz:\nYeah, but the power goes out occasionally.\nPhoenix:\nThat's pretty inconvenient.\nDatz:\nYou're telling me! Sometimes, it goes out for an entire day.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the stuff in the refrigerator?\nDatz:\nWhy don't you see for yourself?\nPhoenix:\nForget I asked! (I'm afraid of what I might find...)\nBook\nPhoenix:\nIs this... a law book? (A dragon mark's been branded into the cover.)\nDatz:\nThat's Dhurke's law book.\nPhoenix:\nReally?! The leader of the rebels? That Dhurke?\nDatz:\nThat's right. And that \"Mark of the Dragon\" is the emblem of the rebellion!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, the pages in this one section are really dirty.\nDatz:\nMust be the section on the Defense Culpability Act.\nDhurke's Law Book added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nHe must've done a ton of research on the Defense Culpability Act. He practically wore out the entire section.\nBook (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIs this... a law book? (A dragon mark's been branded into the cover.)\nDatz:\nThat's Dhurke's law book.\nPhoenix:\nReally?! The leader of the rebels? That Dhurke?\nDatz:\nThat's right. And that \"Mark of the Dragon\" is the emblem of the rebellion!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, the pages in this one section are really dirty.\nDatz:\nMust be the section on the Defense Culpability Act.\nPhoenix:\nHe must've done a ton of research on the Defense Culpability Act. He practically wore out the entire section.\nTalk\nThe high priest's murder\nPhoenix:\nTell me everything you know about the high priest's murder.\nDatz:\nUhh... Well, as ya know, I don't remember much about that. I banged my head on a rock as soon as I parachuted into the Inner Sanctum. So when I told you I had nothing to do with his murder, I meant it!\nPhoenix:\nOkay then, where were you when you came to after banging your head?\nDatz:\nUhh... By the time I came to, it was already dawn. I musta been out cold the whole time!\nPhoenix:\nSo you didn't see the crime happen at all...?\nDatz:\n...Ya got that right!\nPhoenix:\nThen why did you say you did when you testified?!\nDatz:\nOh, uhh... About that... Since I didn't remember a thing... ...I was afraid I'd seem suspicious, so I came up with that whole story!\nPhoenix:\n(Does he even realize how much trouble his big fat lie has caused me?)\nDatz:\nSorry for the trouble! It was definitely my bad!\nPhoenix:\n(He doesn't seem very sorry to me!) So, the bottom line is you were at the scene of the crime, but weren't involved in it. Got it.\nDhurke the attorney (appears after \"The high priest's murder\")\nPhoenix:\nSo, Dhurke used to be a lawyer?\nDatz:\nYep! He was a force to be reckoned with back when he was still practicing! He was a juggernaut of the law, and as mighty as a dragon! He could strike terror into a prosecutor's heart, just by glaring at him. People called it his \"dragon's glare.\" He even got criminals to confess and pass out with a well-placed glare!\nPhoenix:\n(You've got to be kidding me...)\nDatz:\nBut most important of all, he would never surrender. He'd fight for the accused, no matter how the odds were stacked against him.\nPhoenix:\nIs that what you mean by the will of the dragon?\nDatz:\nYep, that would be it! Actually... Your work in court yesterday was mighty impressive, too! You didn't give up, no matter how hard of a beating you took! ...Not unlike Dhurke, I might add!\nPhoenix:\nOh, um... thanks. (Even if a big part of that beating I took was because of you...)\nPresent\nAnything\nDatz:\nIs this a parting gift for me leaving the rebels?\nPhoenix:\nN-No, you can't keep it! (I'll just ask him what I can for now.)\nAfter clearing \"Dhurke the attorney\" Talk option and examining white flowers, photos, food on table, and book:\nDatz:\nWell, I gotta start packing. Who knows when they might catch up with me if I don't scram soon?\nPhoenix:\nPlease, wait! I still need to ask you something.\nDatz:\nGo ahead, shoot.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you rebels trying to do?\nDatz:\n..................\nPhoenix:\nAnd why were you at the Inner Sanctum in the first place?\nTalk\nMr. Are'bal's plan\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you at the Inner Sanctum on the day of the murder? Or more precisely, what were you trying to do there?\nDatz:\nI was trying to escape from prison, that's all. But that high priest was a fool for getting taken in by Dhurke. He shoulda tried hightailing it outta Khura'in like I'm doing!\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nAh... Psyche-Locks! (Mr. Are'bal is hiding something! But I won't know exactly what until I can undo the locks!) What exactly are you trying to hide, Mr. Are'bal?\nDatz:\nHuh? I'm not hiding anything! No way, no how!\nPhoenix:\n(...I'll just have to use my magatama on him, then.)\nPresent Magatama\nPhoenix:\n4 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- Datz's Plan --\nPhoenix:\nI'm going to ask you again: Why were you at the Inner Sanctum on the day of the murder? Or more precisely, what were you trying to do there?\nDatz:\nYa can keep asking, but the answer's still the same. I was trying to escape from prison, that's all. ...But that high priest was a fool. He fell for Dhurke's line and sold his own country out.\nPhoenix:\nHow can you say such things about him?! He helped you escape, didn't he? Don't you even care about what happened to him?\nDatz:\nNope. I was getting out of the rebellion, anyway. He should've opened his eyes. We never stood a chance against the Ga'ran regime.\nPhoenix:\nHang on. Do you really believe what you're saying? Didn't the high priest's death really hurt you on the inside?\nDatz:\nLike I just said, I couldn't care less about the whole thing!\nPhoenix:\nI beg to differ. This wouldn't be here in this room if you didn't feel a thing.\nPresent Nahmanda Flower\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I heard these flowers are offered in memory of the dead here in Khura'in.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nDatz:\nWhat does that have to do with anything?\nPhoenix:\nYou don't know? Try looking deep into your heart.\nDatz:\nUmm... I still don't get it. But I'm starting to think you don't, either!\nPhoenix:\n(Arngh... Why does it feel so much worse when it's him who's pointing out my failures?)\nDatz:\nI told ya, I couldn't care less about the high priest!\nPhoenix:\n(Really...? Because I'm pretty sure I have something that points to his grief.)\nLeads back to:\n\"I beg to differ. This wouldn't be here in this room if you didn't feel a thing.\"\nPhoenix:\nI heard these flowers are offered in memory of the dead here in Khura'in. The high priest's death hit you hard, so you've been grieving here alone, haven't you? Well?\nDatz:\nHee-HO!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nDatz:\nThose flowers don't mean anything. It's just a Khura'inese way o' saying goodbye.\nPhoenix:\nWhy hide the fact that you're mourning his death?\nDatz:\nYou're reading into this too much. I told ya, I'm done with the rebellion! I haven't even heard from Dhurke or the rest of 'em for a few days. And tomorrow, I'm planning to kiss this kingdom goodbye!\nPhoenix:\nNo, I know you've been in contact with the other rebels lately!\nDatz:\nAnd how exactly do you plan on proving that?!\nPhoenix:\nThis piece of evidence ties you to the other rebels!\nPresent Brand New Flag\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I found this prayer flag at the Plaza of Devotion.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nDatz:\n............\nPhoenix:\nCat got your tongue?\nDatz:\nNo, it's just, I was shocked at how off-target ya are. Wait, you're not stalling for time or something, are ya?\nPhoenix:\nN-No, I'd never do that. (I hope he doesn't think I'm in cahoots with the police or something...)\nDatz:\nI keep trying to tell ya -- I got nothing to do with the rebels anymore.\nPhoenix:\n(This food was brought here for Mr. Are'bal after he escaped from prison. So he must've gotten in contact with the other rebels somehow.) No, I know you're still involved with them!\nLeads back to:\n\"This piece of evidence ties you to the other rebels!\"\nPhoenix:\nI found this prayer flag at the Plaza of Devotion. You wrote a message on it, and left it behind for your fellow rebels, didn't you?\nDatz:\nGulp!\nPhoenix:\nThey brought this food for you at your request.\nDatz:\nHoo-HA HA!\nPhoenix:\nSo you're lying about leaving the rebels. You're still involved with Dhurke and the rest of them, aren't you?\nDatz:\nNaaaaaaaargh!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nPhoenix:\nAre you ready to tell me the truth now?\nDatz:\nOh, you're good, Mr. Lawyer Man! I admit it! I requested the grub. But I was just taking advantage of 'em, that's all!\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nDatz:\nWith my face plastered all over the place, I couldn't stay out in the open anymore. So, I just took advantage of my former comrades for some grub and a place to hide. I was gonna kiss this kingdom goodbye tomorrow!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not buying it. You're obviously lying. I can tell just by looking at you. The white-hot flames of revolution definitely still burn on inside of you!\nDatz:\nWhat?! That's ridiculous. Those flames burned out a long time ago!\nPhoenix:\nThis proves that the flames of revolution still burn on inside of you!\nPresent Dhurke's Law Book\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Dhurke's law book? I'm no lawyer, so what's that got to do with me?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nDatz:\nAh!\nPhoenix:\nI'm right, aren't I?! That's why you're so shocked!\nDatz:\nYeesh, I almost forgot about dessert!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that wasn't it.)\nDatz:\nWould you give up already? The flames of revolution burned out inside of me a long time ago!\nPhoenix:\n(No, I know they still burn on. Because he's wearing something that proves it!) You can't fool me, Mr. Are'bal.\nLeads back to:\n\"This proves that the flames of revolution still burn on inside of you!\"\nDatz:\nDhurke's law book? I'm no lawyer, so what's that got to do with me?\nPhoenix:\nLook at the mark branded onto the cover. This mark that stands for an unwavering commitment to the revolution. It is Dhurke's way of representing the will of the dragon!\nDatz:\nYeah? So what of it?!\nPhoenix:\nYou have that same mark on the scarf tied around your left arm. But you wouldn't be wearing that if you were no longer a rebel!\nDatz:\nI-I... I forgot to take it off, that's all!\nPhoenix:\nNo, as a wanted man, that should've been the first thing you took off! The fact that you haven't hidden that mark yet... proves you're still a rebel!\nDatz:\nHoo-HA!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nDatz:\nThink whatcha want! But you don't know nothing about me!\nPhoenix:\nNo, you're wrong. You wear your heart and your beliefs right on your sleeve -- just like me. And this is what I believe in.\nPresent Attorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...............\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nDatz:\nThat's what you believe in?\nPhoenix:\nSure! And I never waver from it!\nDatz:\nThat's the lamest belief I ever heard of! Haaaaaar har har har har!\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't think it was THAT funny...)\nDatz:\nI was right, you don't know a thing about me!\nPhoenix:\nActually, I know you wear your beliefs right on your sleeve -- just like me.\nLeads back to:\n\"And this is what I believe in.\"\nDatz:\n...............\nPhoenix:\nWhen a person's back is against a wall, they always fall back on what they believe in. Just as I always have my badge, you always have the will of the dragon with you.\nDatz:\nAnd would you risk your life for your beliefs?\nPhoenix:\n...No, I wouldn't.\nDatz:\nNo?\nPhoenix:\nNo, because I wouldn't be much use to my clients dead. Now, admit it! You've never once thought about leaving the Defiant Dragons, have you!\nDatz:\n.........That look in your eyes. It's just like Dhurke's. ...Looks like you've got the will of the dragon inside o' ya, too.\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nMr. Are'bal's plan (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nDatz:\nI had planned to take ya out if ya turned out to be on the side of the royals... But I think I can trust ya.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe I was that close to getting shanked here...)\nDatz:\nIt's like ya said. I've no intention of leaving Dhurke's group.\nPhoenix:\nIn other words, you were testing me.\nDatz:\nYou're a foreigner, and a lawyer who's been charged with abetting a criminal to boot. And I've seen a fair share of lawyers get pardoned... ...after weeping at the feet of the queen.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'm going to keep fighting till the end.\nDatz:\nYeah, I can see that now. Sorry I ever doubted ya.\nPhoenix:\nSo, what are you doing here, anyway?\nDatz:\nI came to get the secret hideout key from a helper.\nPhoenix:\nA secret hideout?\nDatz:\nYep. I was supposed to get my next order from Dhurke there. But the town's swarming with cops thanks to that murder. Nothing I can do about that.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the order Dhurke was supposed to give you?\nDatz:\nGonna have to abort that mission. Now I'm just lying low, waiting for a chance to make contact with Dhurke again. .........Hey, why the long face?\nPhoenix:\nI thought you'd be able to tell me something about the high priest's murder.\nDatz:\nSorry to disappoint ya... Oh, I know. Lemme make it up to ya with this.\nPhoenix:\n...What is it?\nDatz:\nThis orb is actually a key. It opens the door to one of our secret hideouts. I can't say any more than that. Anyway, I hope it helps.\nPhoenix:\nThis orb... is a key?\nDatz:\nYep! Plus the hideout's in a totally unexpected location! And being that it's super secret, we couldn't have just any ordinary key!\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nGolden Orb added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe this will help me unravel the truth behind this case. Thanks!\nDatz:\nDon't mention it! Besides, you're a fellow brother in arms, fighting the powers that be! If it'll help ya, feel free to pick my brain a bit more.\nLady Kee'ra (appears after \"Mr. Are'bal's plan\")\nDatz:\nEveryone's been talking about the return of Lady Kee'ra lately.\nPhoenix:\nWell, my friend Maya's suspected of being the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra. You wouldn't happen to know who she really is though, would you?!\nDatz:\nBeats me. But whoever she is, she bushwhacked me and hauled me off to jail! Even worse, on top o' attacking us and delivering us to the cops... ...she's been watching us like a hawk and framing us for different crimes!\nPhoenix:\nWatching you like a hawk? Framing you for crimes? Why would anyone go to all that trouble?\nDatz:\nOur kingdom likes to pretend that its people are free to think what they want. Because of that, the authorities can't arrest ya just for sympathizing with the rebellion. So they resort to framing people for things they didn't do.\nPhoenix:\nThen that Lady Kee'ra figure is...\nDatz:\nYep, she's just some lickspittle working for the Ga'ran regime.\nPhoenix:\nWow...\nInga:\nHeh, even without the DC Act, Dhurke and his insurgent scum buddies' days are numbered.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's that supposed to mean?!\nInga:\nLet's just say... I got a little trick up my sleeve. So I'd watch it if I were you. 'Cause you got a defiant attitude -- like one o' them dragon dupes.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was talking about Lady Kee'ra, then?)\nDatz:\nAdvanced combat skills, detailed surveillance, and clever set ups... She's no amateur if ya ask me.\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're saying the monarchy is using Lady Kee'ra to secretly take out the rebels?\nDatz:\nExactly! The Ga'ran regime is using her to control the people, even down to what we think!\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't the people protest if the monarchy is doing things like that?\nDatz:\nUnfortunately, we don't have any conclusive evidence. And without that, we can't prove anything.\nPhoenix:\nArngh! I know the feeling... If I bring this up in court, they'd probably dismiss it out of hand. (I'll have to unmask Lady Kee'ra if I want to get anywhere.)\nGoal of the revolution (appears after \"Lady Kee'ra\")\nLeads to:\n\"Our goal? To get rid o' that evil, no-good Defense Culpability Act!\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nDatz:\nI've seen the will of the dragon within ya! You're gonna make a fine rebel!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?!\nDatz:\nWhat's wrong, my friend! You've gotta rise up with me! Har har har har har!\nPhoenix:\nUm... I don't recall joining the rebellion, though...\nTahrust's Autopsy Report, Inner Sanctum Photo, Nahmanda Flower, or Family Photo\nDatz:\nThe high priest left Lady Inmee all alone when he died. Even worse, they say she's expecting a baby.\nPhoenix:\nIt's always hardest for the family members left behind.\nDatz:\nI know exactly what you mean. Blast it! If only I could remember what happened after I escaped from prison.\nPhoenix:\n(It seems Mr. Are'bal feels responsible for the high priest's death.)\nDhurke's Law Book\nDatz:\nThe dragon emblem branded into that book is a sign of defiance against the Ga'ran regime. That evil law's led to the deaths of many of our brothers in arms.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the Defense Culpability Act?\nDatz:\nYep. But we're not gonna stand for it much longer! That's the main reason we have to see this revolution through!\nPhoenix:\n(I've never seen him so serious before.)\nGolden Orb\nDatz:\nThat orb's the key to the secret hideout.\nPhoenix:\nSo, where exactly is this hideout, anyway?\nDatz:\nUmm............\nPhoenix:\nDon't tell me you forgot when you bumped your head?\nDatz:\n.........Har har har har har!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like I'll have to find it myself.)\nAnything else\nDatz:\nHmm... This is that whatchamacallit, ain't it.\nPhoenix:\nWhat is?\nDatz:\nYou know, that whatchamacallit. Um... What were we talking about again?\nPhoenix:\nIt's all right. You don't have to force yourself if you've got nothing to say...\nDatz:\nOur goal? To get rid o' that evil, no-good Defense Culpability Act!\nPhoenix:\nI can tell just by looking at Dhurke's law book.\nDatz:\nThe DC Act has turned this kingdom into a corrupt cesspool... ...where false charges are overlooked, and prosecutors are the only ones heard in court. It's been twenty-three years since it was first enacted.\nPhoenix:\nWhat happened twenty-three years ago to make them pass such a terrible law?\nDatz:\nThe assassination of Queen Amara... That's where it all began.\nAhlbi:\nIt happened before I was even born, but... ...Queen Amara -- the previous queen -- was assassinated. And it was the rebel leader Dhurke who did it.\nPhoenix:\nDhurke assassinated the former queen, didn't he?\nDatz:\nThat's the official line, but...\nPhoenix:\nThe official line?\nDatz:\nThose charges were completely trumped up! Dhurke was framed, I'm telling ya!\nPhoenix:\nH-He was?!\nDatz:\nPlus, Dhurke was a lawyer. Once the people thought a lawyer had killed the queen, they turned against all lawyers. And that's how the DC Act was first passed.\nPhoenix:\nSo, that's why there aren't any lawyers left in Khura'in.\nDatz:\nEven worse, it changed the significance of the Divination S\u00e9ance.\nPhoenix:\n(The significance of the Divination S\u00e9ance?) They were holding S\u00e9ances in court, even before the DC Act?\nDatz:\nYou bet they were! Lawyers and prosecutors used to hotly contest the Insights that came outta S\u00e9ances.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean like what I've been doing?\nDatz:\nRight! It's like Dhurke used to say: The royal priestess's Insights are just another piece of evidence.\nPhoenix:\nRight... I see what you mean about the significance of the Divination S\u00e9ance changing.\nDatz:\nYep! The Insights became the only truth, and arguing against them was banned!\nRayfa:\nAs royal priestess, it is my duty to reveal the truth through the Divination S\u00e9ance. This time, I will prove that the insights I glean thereof are the very truth itself. Prepare yourself, for this shall be your last trial... and your last rites. Tomorrow shall end with you under the headsman's axe!\nPhoenix:\n(From what I've seen, Rayfa would agree with that.)\nDatz:\nThis kingdom's a shadow of its former self. It's become a dictatorship where the royals use the fear of trumped-up charges to rule!\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's what Dhurke's been rebelling against?\nDatz:\nYep. All we want is to live in a kingdom with a fair and impartial legal system. And there's only one way to make that come true: Overthrow the current regime!\nPhoenix:\n(So, that's the truth behind the rebels.)\nDatz:\n...Well, PW, my friend, it's about time for me to get going. After all, I AM the fangs of the Defiant Dragons. Datz Are'bal!\nPhoenix:\nYou're not going to do that \"alley-oop\" thing again, are you?\nDatz:\nI was just getting to that! See ya when I see ya! Alley-oop!\nPhoenix:\n(Why does he have to jump like that before running off?) ...Well, I guess we're friends now. But enough about that. I've already spent way too much time here!\nTehm'pul Temple, Plaza of Devotion, Inner Sanctum, Detention Center, or High Priest's House (before examining manhole, then presenting Brand New Flag in Khura'in - Bazaar)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nRayfa:\nThat patch on the accused's bag... It is the Steel Samurai?\nPhoenix:\nYes. It's a huge hit back in my country.\nRayfa:\nI see... It has a rather fine design, I must say. However, it pales beside the Plumed Punisher, of course.\nPhoenix:\nOf course... (They all look the same to me, to be honest...)\nWhat to do\nRayfa:\nHow dare you leave me behind like that!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (It sure was a lot easier without her, though.)\nRayfa:\nDo that again and I will levy a penalty on you!\nPhoenix:\nA penalty? Like what...?\nRayfa:\nLike... Oh, I know! You must clean my room.\nPhoenix:\nHey, that's not so bad.\nRayfa:\n...All thirty of them.\nPhoenix:\nForgive me for leaving you behind, Your Benevolence!\nMay 11Khura'in - Bazaar\nPhoenix:\nWhew... I finally got out of there!\nAhlbi:\nMr. Wright! I'm so glad you're okay! I was so worried about you!\nShah'do:\n*whine*\nPhoenix:\nShah'do... What happened to him, anyway?\nAhlbi:\nHe came out of the manhole about five minutes after you went in. Sorry he wasn't much help!\nShah'do:\n*whine*\nRayfa:\n...Well? Did you find anything of worth?\nPhoenix:\nOh, uh... I tripped and fell down there. I must've been out cold for a while. (I better keep things to myself for now.)\nRayfa:\nI figured as much.\nPhoenix:\n(I have to find that secret hideout Mr. Are'bal was talking about. I should probably start with places that have something to do with the high priest.)\nExamine\nManhole\nRayfa:\nWhat is it, Barbed Head? Is the sewer calling to you once more?\nPhoenix:\nNot exactly... (I probably shouldn't tell her about Mr. Are'bal...)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head... I detect a foul odor emanating from you.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I did walk through the sewers, so...\nRayfa:\nStay back! Keep your stink to yourself!\nPhoenix:\nI'd be glad to leave you alone if you'd like.\nRayfa:\nWho said you could walk away from me, you muttonhead!\nPhoenix:\nFine, I'll stick to you like glue.\nRayfa:\nNo, that is too close!\nPhoenix:\n(I just can't win with her.)\nWhat to do\nRayfa:\nEven after investigating the sewers, you have nothing.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'm not ready to give up yet! (Besides, I wouldn't say I have nothing.) There's nowhere I wouldn't go if it would help Maya!\nRayfa:\nSo, what will it be next? Will you dive into a septic tank?\nPhoenix:\nUuh... I-If it would help Maya, I wouldn't rule it out!\nRayfa:\nS-Stay back!\nPhoenix:\nI thought it was just a hypothetical!\nPresent\nGolden Orb\nRayfa:\nThat orb has a mesmerizing core. I must take a closer look at it.\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Are'bal entrusted me with this, so maybe I shouldn't let even Princess Rayfa handle it.) Y-Your Benevolence? Wouldn't you be defiled by touching an object that has been in the hands of a lawyer?\nRayfa:\nI suppose so.\nPhoenix:\n...You do know that there are no such things as lawyer cooties, right?\nMay 11Inner Sanctum\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head. You already searched here, did you not?\nPhoenix:\nOh, umm... I just thought I'd look around again. You know, in case I missed something? (I probably shouldn't tell her I'm looking for the secret rebel hideout.) We have a saying back home: \"Leave no stone unturned.\"\nRayfa:\nHmm? ...Oh, yes. You cannot stump me. I know that one.\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, \"I don't have a clue\" is written all over your face...)\nExamine\nPrayer flags\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe Mr. Are'bal used this as a parachute.\nRayfa:\nThat reckless fool... Then again, he must have a screw loose if he counts himself among those vile rebels.\nPhoenix:\n(I wouldn't exactly call him crazy... but he's certainly one-of-a-kind.)\nLeft side of warbaa'd statue\nPhoenix:\nIt's a statue of a bird... Guess I'll take a closer look at it. (Changed from [It's a statue of a bird... I should take a closer look later.] in the original release)\nStatue's missing eye\nLeads to:\n\"Hey, this eye is missing.\"\nPhoenix:\nHey, this eye is missing.\nRayfa:\nWhat are you doing? You must not touch that for no reason!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry! But that shape... Hmm, I wonder...\nPresent Golden Orb\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I knew it!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis might fit in that cavity.\nRayfa:\nPohlkunka! Wh-What are you doing?! You... chowderhead! Remove your hand from there this instant!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry! I just thought this might fit in there.\nRayfa:\nAre you blind?! They have entirely different shapes!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, that was a long shot. Still, I can't help feeling I have something that would fit in there.)\nRayfa:\nDo not let me catch you needlessly touching the statue again!\nPhoenix:\nA-Alright already, I get it...\nLeads back to:\n\"But that shape... Hmm, I wonder...\"\nPhoenix:\nI knew it!\nRayfa:\nWh-Wh-Wha...?! ........................\nPhoenix:\n(She must be at a loss for words. And that doesn't happen too often.)\nRayfa:\n...What is this place?! E-Explain yourself at once, Barbed Head!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think she's ready for the full story...) I don't really know much myself, but... It seems to be a secret rebel hideout. (If I'm shocked there's a secret door here, I imagine that goes double for Rayfa.)\nRayfa:\nA rebel hideout in the Inner Sanctum?! Somebody will pay for this!\nPhoenix:\nW-Well for now, I think I'll have a look around.\nRayfa:\nWait! You must not enter before the police!\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry, I won't disturb anything. (Or at least I'll try not to...) Besides, with you watching over me, it should be fine, right? And, uh, you see...\nRayfa:\n...Fine. Just please stop pleading your case. I can only stand so much lawyerly drivel. But I will be presenting all information gleaned from your efforts here to the police.\nPhoenix:\nOf course. Now, shall we?\nRayfa:\nI will go no further.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. You're not supposed to come in contact with the taint of Lady Kee'ra's battles.\nRayfa:\nVery good, Barbed Head. I commend you for remembering!\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, well thank you! (Wait, why am I thanking her?)\nRayfa:\nI may not be able to enter, but I will allow no misdeeds on your part. I will be watching you like a warbaa'd from the entrance here!\nPhoenix:\nI told you I'm not going to do anything! (I better hurry before she changes her mind!)\nExamine\nRevolving door\nPhoenix:\n(Who'd have guessed a rebel hideout would be at the back of the Inner Sanctum? Then again, the sanctum's not open to the public. What better place to hide away from prying eyes?)\nMay 11Secret Hideout\nRayfa:\nI believe this to be a sacred space that enshrines the source of the spring water.\nPhoenix:\n(That makes sense. The rebels must've converted it into a secret hideout. But what about that warbaa'd revolving door? I wonder if that, too, was originally intended to hide and protect this sacred space.)\nRayfa:\nTo think those filthy rebels were scheming their schemes in this most sacred space...! It is a desecration upon Khura'inism itself! The Defiant Dragons shall pay for this!\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose it's only natural that she'd be upset. But the investigation must go on!) I think I'll start by taking a picture of the place. (Good thing I brought a camera to snap some souvenir shots.)\nRayfa:\nStop that! You must not take photos here without permission!\nPhoenix:\n(Rayfa's really fired up. She's sticking her head in as far as it will go. I guess she won't be \"tainted\" as long as she doesn't touch anything...?)\nRebel Hideout Photo added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nNow, to search every nook and cranny...\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head! Just because it is hard for me to see your every move... ...do not use that as an excuse to touch and break things!\nPhoenix:\nI heard you the first time! (Sheesh...)\nExamine\nBanner\nRayfa:\nHow dare those filthy insurgents raise their banner amid such a sacred space! Barbed Head! You must burn it at once!\nPhoenix:\n...Um, didn't you tell me not to touch or damage anything?\nRayfa:\nHmph, this is an exception! Very well, if you will not do it, then I will!\nPhoenix:\nBut, Your Benevolence, I thought you're not supposed to come in here.\nRayfa:\nNngrrrrrrr...!\nPhoenix:\n(For once, the strange customs of this kingdom are working in my favor.) Hm? (There's something under the banner. A microphone? What's this doing here? Was someone trying to record something with it?)\nSmaller stone slab\nPhoenix:\nA large stone slab... (It's shaped like a magatama. It looks rather unstable. I bet it'd tip over in an earthquake.) Hm? What's that earthy, grass-like smell?\nRayfa:\nIt is the smell of the moss that covers the stone.\nPhoenix:\nOh, so this shaggy green stuff is moss... ...Hm? It looks like some of the moss about halfway up has been disturbed. ...I wonder why that is? (One quick touch can't hurt, right...?) Whoa! (The slab's starting to wobble!)\nRayfa:\nWhat is happening?! What have you done to the sacred space?!\nPhoenix:\nN-N-Nothing! (All I did was nudge it a little... I knew it looked unstable. Probably best not to touch it again.)\nWater or larger stone slab\nPhoenix:\nSo, this is the water source that supplies the Inner Sanctum's spring. It flows through the channel built into the floor before heading outside.\nRayfa:\nLady Kee'ra uses this sacred water to wash the taint of battle from her body.\nPhoenix:\nIt's also not red like the water in the spring.\nChart\nPhoenix:\nLooks like an order from Dhurke.\nRayfa:\nWhat's this?! Let me see that!\nPhoenix:\nI thought you're not supposed to touch anything in here.\nRayfa:\nThis is an exception! Now hand it over! Let's see here... Hmm... ...O Holy Mother!\nPhoenix:\nWhat? What does it say?\nRayfa:\nIt is an order intended for that rebel named Datz. It reads... \"After the rite, infiltrate the palace under the guise of returning Lady Kee'ra's costume... ...and search for clues about that incident from twenty-three years ago. --Dhurke\"\nPhoenix:\nTwenty-three years ago? He must mean the assassination of Queen Amara. I wonder what the rebels are up to... (It's intriguing and all, but it doesn't seem related to the case at hand.)\nRayfa:\nThis will not do! I must warn my mother at once!\nPhoenix:\nNo need to do that. This order will never be carried out. Lady Kee'ra's costume is still here, and Abbot Inmee is no longer able to aid the rebels.\nRayfa:\nHmph, I-I knew that!\nChart (subsequent times)\nRayfa:\nIs there anything else you would like me to read, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, let's see... Uhh... How about this note?\nRayfa:\nLet me see that. Konuuro, zabaas, bahr'bahr, yak, and roux... Wait, this looks familiar!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it? Some kind of Khura'inist spell?\nRayfa:\nNo, it's a recipe for Khura'inese curry.\nPhoenix:\nI guess the rebels enjoy a home-cooked meal, just like everyone else.\nPlumed Punisher poster\nPhoenix:\nThere's a Plumed Punisher calendar here.\nRayfa:\nAh, now I understand. The villains in The Plumed Punisher are based on the insurgents. Watching the show must have roused their ire against Lady Kee'ra!\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... I doubt that's it.)\nPlumed Punisher clock\nPhoenix:\nLook!\nRayfa:\nWhat is it, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a Plumed Punisher clock!\nRayfa:\nWhy, I believe it's... It is a limited-edition promotional item given to fifty lucky viewers! This rare item plays the Plumed Punisher theme song ever hour! H-Hand it over now, Barbed Head!\nPhoenix:\nAh! (She snatched it away from me! No matter what she says, Rayfa is definitely a huge fan.)\nRayfa:\nHmm... What a fine item. And this switch... If I'm right...\nPhoenix:\n(It's the Plumed Punisher theme song...)\nRayfa:\nYes, now I see! The insurgents who use this room... ...must be Plumed Punisher fans!\nPhoenix:\n...That may be so, but I don't see how it's relevant to this case.\nChain\nPhoenix:\nThe statue door rotates when you pull this chain.\nRayfa:\nI see...Then you must shut the door and destroy its mechanism! That will deprive the insurgents of access to this place!\nPhoenix:\nB-But wouldn't that trap me in here?\nRayfa:\nNot to worry! I would come to visit you once a year.\nPhoenix:\n(She's actually serious!)\nCart or guns\nPhoenix:\nWeapons! And lots of them, too.\nRayfa:\nWe are lucky we found them before they could be used. Excellent work, Barbed Head!\nPhoenix:\nOh, uh, thanks... (If the rebellion ever happens, I hope it's bloodless.)\nBloodstain\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? A bloodstain...? I should probably try to figure out what happened in here. Hmm...\nRayfa:\nDo not tamper with any evidence before the police arrive!\nPhoenix:\n...The police? Hey, that reminds me. Ema gave me something just for times like these.\nEma:\nI thought it might help your investigation. Here, it's all yours! I wanted to bring you a bunch of other forensic tools... ...but they were confiscated at the airport.\nPhoenix:\n(Luminol testing fluid... This actually might come in handy.)\nPhoenix:\n(Luminol testing fluid glows in reaction to even the tiniest traces of blood. So it can even detect areas where blood has been wiped up. It might help us figure out what happened in here. Okay, time for science to do its thing! First, let me put these red-tinted glasses on to see the luminol's glow... ...then I just press [A / Space] wherever I want to spray some of the luminol. (Changed from [...then I just touch wherever I want to spray some of the luminol.] in the original release) Areas where there was blood will react by turning blue.)\nSpray area near where waterway diverges\nLeads to:\nLeads to:\n\"Th-This is a huge bloodstain! Something big must've happened here!\"\nPhoenix:\nTh-This is a huge bloodstain! Something big must've happened here!\nRayfa:\nPerhaps the high priest's blood flowed in there from under the warbaa'd statue.\nPhoenix:\n...There was definitely a lot of blood here. But it's impossible to say much else at this point. I'll just take a picture for now. Oh, right. Luminol reactions don't show up in photos. I'll just have to take some notes. That should do it! (...I didn't notice before, but the bloodstain looks like it was smeared away in one place. Is it because the warbaa'd revolving door passed over it?)\nRebel Hideout Photo updated in the Court Record.\nBloodstain (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThat bloodstain on the floor... The luminol showed that it was even bigger than I expected. Something definitely happened here, and it wasn't good.\nRayfa:\nHow can you be so sure? Perhaps the high priest's blood flowed in there from under the warbaa'd statue.\nPhoenix:\nTrue... But there's not much else we can say at this point.\nAfter examining banner, smaller stone slab, chart, Plumed Punisher clock, and bloodstain:\nPhoenix:\n...Well, I think that covers about everything here.\nEma:\nMr. Wright! You shouldn't have come in here before the police!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but I was in a hurry. I didn't do anything I wasn't supposed to. Her Benevolence can attest to that.\nRayfa:\nIt is your fault for being so slow. I expect the police to work faster and more efficiently!\nEma:\nSorry...\nRayfa:\nWell, Barbed Head? Have you not already seen enough?\nPhoenix:\nI guess it's about time I got back to the temple and go over everything I've learned.\nMay 11Tehm'pul Temple\nAhlbi:\nWelcome back, Mr. Wright! How'd it go?\nPhoenix:\nUnfortunately, I didn't find anything conclusive.\nAhlbi:\nN-No way!\nRayfa:\n...I do not understand, Barbed Head.\nPhoenix:\nWhat don't you understand?\nRayfa:\nWhy you did not commit any misdeeds during your investigation. After all, lawyers ply their trade primarily through illicit means and methods.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! Who told you that?\nRayfa:\nMy mother. Are you saying she was wrong? ...No, that cannot be! You must have committed some sort of misdeed right under my nose.\nPhoenix:\n(If that were so, she wasted her whole day following me around.)\nRayfa:\nHm? What is it? ........................ Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has need of me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's going on?\nRayfa:\nI must go perform a Divination S\u00e9ance for Puhray Zeh'lot. It is our custom for the prosecution to review its contents before a trial begins.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nRayfa:\n.........The third time will be the charm. My insights will finally bring you to your knees tomorrow! And I will teach that neophyte practitioner a lesson!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like the royal priestess is back with a vengeance. She's made a full recovery from when we started the investigation earlier today.) I look forward to seeing you in court, Your Benevolence!\nRayfa:\nHmph. Your overconfidence will be your downfall. You will not look so confident when I am finished with you tomorrow!\nPhoenix:\nActually... I'm not really looking forward to seeing her tomorrow. Especially without any solid evidence.\nAhlbi:\nWhy don't we go over everything you know so far?\nPhoenix:\nAll right. Hmm, let's see here... Acolyte Zeh'lot was killed during the rite with Lady Kee'ra's dagger. And Maya's fingerprints were found on it.\nAhlbi:\nThat doesn't sound very good!\nPhoenix:\nI know... It's the very definition of being up a creek without a paddle. The day before his murder, Zeh'lot enjoyed a meal with the high priest, his wife, and Maya. I also learned about spirit channeling here in Khura'in.\nAhlbi:\nNone of that sounds very helpful.\nPhoenix:\nOh, but I did hear something interesting. That the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra might be working for the justice minister.\nAhlbi:\nWhat?! Really?! Our kingdom is supposed to be ruled through faith and laws. We can't allow the people to be controlled by fear and violence!\nPhoenix:\nAhlbi, that sounds like something a rebel might say.\nAhlbi:\nI-It does? But if that Lady Kee'ra really is one of Minister Inga's subordinates... ...that would exonerate Miss Maya!\nPhoenix:\nUnfortunately, I have no way of proving it in court.\nAhlbi:\n...Oh, that's too bad.\nPhoenix:\nOh, I almost forgot about the secret rebel hideout we found at the Inner Sanctum. There was a bloodstain inside. But I don't know if or how it's connected to this case, though.\nAhlbi:\nWow! A secret room at the Inner Sanctum?! That would be a huge hit with tourists!\nPhoenix:\n(This kid really is an entrepreneur at heart.)\nAhlbi:\n...Er, what I mean is that hideout could be important to your case.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe, but it's still too early to tell. Argh... Looks like I'm heading into court without any useful evidence.\nAhlbi:\nWe'll just have to pray something appears during tomorrow's trial...\nPhoenix:\nPrincess Rayfa's Divination S\u00e9ance might be my only hope. There could be some new information in it that might help.\nAhlbi:\nTh-The Divination S\u00e9ance?! But I thought it always works against the accused!\nPhoenix:\n...Not always.\nDatz:\nRight! It's like Dhurke used to say: The royal priestess's Insights are just another piece of evidence.\nAhlbi:\nReally?! I never heard anyone say that before. It's hard to figure you out sometimes, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Divination S\u00e9ances worked both ways before the Defense Culpability Act. It's only now that the people of Khura'in find it strange.)\nAhlbi:\nUm, Mr. Wright? I just wanted to say... good luck tomorrow!\nPhoenix:\nThanks. I can't afford to lose this next one. (I've collected all sorts of information, but I haven't even started connecting the dots. If I could do that, I might have a shot at pulling off a win. Rayfa's Insights will be the deciding factor. It's a huge gamble, but it's all I've got!)\nTo be continued\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNothing particularly interesting here.\nArea already examined\nPhoenix:\nI've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I'm pretty sure I know what I need to, but... ...maybe I should go over it all again.)",

I never properly asked you to defend me, did I?Phoenix:\nIt doesn't matter. I'm on this case till the bitter end.Maya:\nI know. That's why... I wanted to officially ask you for your help.Phoenix:\nYou got it, Maya! Let's do this. We gotta wrap this up and get back home so you can make your dream show come true. \"The Steel Samurai vs. The Plumed Punisher,\" right?Maya:\nYou bet!Rayfa:\nYou look as if you did not sleep last night, Barbed Head. It is written all over your face. How can you expect to put up a respectable defense like that?Phoenix:\nI-I'm all fired up, and raring to go! (I guess Maya's not the only one looking exhausted.)Rayfa:\n...........................Phoenix:\n(Hm? Rayfa doesn't seem in the best spirits herself.)Rayfa:\nHmph. Go ahead, feign confidence now while you are still able. For I will see to it that your last rites are read to you this day!Phoenix:\n(Heh, guess it was just my imagination...)Maya:\nReady, Nick?Phoenix:\nOkay, Maya, let's head on in!May 12High Court of Khura'inDay 2Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge:\nNow then, if everyone is ready...Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Magistry.Nahyuta:\nThe prosecution is ready. Let us begin without further delay.Judge:\nOh, no prayers this time, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta:\nI already offered my prayers for the latest victim during my visit to the crime scene. Being that the accused has already been found guilty of the first murder... ...let us hasten this trial, so we may put this dead lawyer walking out of his misery.Judge:\nI could not agree more. In yesterday's trial, the accused was already found guilty of murdering the high priest. And today she will be tried for the murder of his disciple, Puhray Zeh'lot. Now then, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, your opening statement, if you would.Nahyuta:\n...Certainly. The accused has now slain two of the most devout clergymen in Khura'inism. Even the lowest level of Hell -- the Hell of Tickling -- would not be punishment enough.Judge:\n*gulp* Th-Then... what t-terrible fate awaits her?Nahyuta:\nBahlgilpo'kon Hell -- a realm of eternal agony. There she will suffer the endless punishment of ja'gar by the galuun of Puhlmo'ten. Furthermore, Guhljaama--Judge:\nE-Enough, enough! My blood runs cold at the mere thought that such a terrible place exists.Phoenix:\n(I was going to ask for a translation, but on second thought, ignorance is bliss.)Judge:\nN-Now then, please continue, minus the part about the terrible hell awaiting the accused.Nahyuta:\nAs you wish... The victim of this heinous crime was the high priest's disciple, Puhray Zeh'lot. He had been training under the high priest while living at the priest's home.Judge:\nI had met him a number of times, and he seemed like an earnest young man. How tragic that he met such a terrible end.Nahyuta:\nThe murder occurred at the Plaza of Devotion, during the Purification Rite. It was a bold crime carried out while the plaza was full of the faithful deep in prayer. The Warbaa'd Dagger was found impaled in the victim's upper back. The stabbing caused a spinal cord injury that killed him instantly.Judge:\nAh, the Warbaa'd Dagger. Lady Kee'ra's weapon of choice.Nahyuta:\nWe have already established that the accused's prints were on the weapon. Incredibly damning evidence in itself.Maya:\nN-No... I didn't do it!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nHold your tongue. Now, being that the accused, Maya Fey, is a serial killer... ...the prosecution believes that the death penalty is the only possible sentence.Judge:\nWould the defense care to respond?Phoenix:\nThe accused is innocent, and nothing can convince me otherwise! After all, the crime scene was packed with worshippers. How could my client possibly have committed this murder without a single witness?Nahyuta:\nThe accused's fingerprints on the murder weapon alone is enough to render a verdict. As such, I see no need to debate this any further.Phoenix:\nB-But...!Judge:\nWell, once Her Benevolence conducts her S\u00e9ance, it will be clear for all to see.Nahyuta:\n............... Your Magistry, might I have a word?Judge:\nHm? Is something the matter, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta:\nIt is about the Divination S\u00e9ance...Rayfa:Judge:\nY-Your Benevolence!Rayfa:\nStop right there, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.Nahyuta:\n...As you wish. Forgive me for overstepping my bounds.Phoenix:\n(What was that all about?)Rayfa:\nBarbed Head, have you made peace with your fate? For this time, the Divination S\u00e9ance will bring you to your knees!Phoenix:\nI'm ready. And I accept your challenge. (The only problem is, I have no weapons at my disposal. Our only hope now is what we can glean from the S\u00e9ance vision and Rayfa's Insights.)Judge:\nVery well. The Divination S\u00e9ance if you please, Your Benevolence.Rayfa:\nYes, let us begin. ...Nayna! O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination S\u00e9ance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!Rayfa:\n............Phoenix:\n............Judge:\n............Phoenix: \n(I don't get it. Why wasn't there anything to see?)Judge:\nY-Your Benevolence! What in the world...?Rayfa:\nUrgh... I was unable to evoke any sort of response. I called out the spirit's name many times... but to no avail!Nahyuta:\nJust as I thought...Phoenix:\n(Wait, what does he know that we don't?)Nahyuta:\nI had sought to confirm the contents of today's Divination S\u00e9ance. After all, it is customary for the prosecutor to verify it beforehand.Phoenix:\n(Come to think of it...)Rayfa:\nI must go perform a Divination S\u00e9ance for Puhray Zeh'lot. It is our custom for the prosecution to review its contents before a trial begins.Nahyuta:\nAnd that is why I sought to stop Her Benevolence from performing it here. However, she insisted that it be done. She wished to try one more time here in the Hall of Justice.Judge:\nIt would appear Her Benevolence is tired from her manifold duties.Rayfa:\nI am not anything of the sort! The victim's spirit will not answer my call, but I know not why! It is my sacred duty to convey the truth through the Divination S\u00e9ance!Phoenix:\n(Rayfa...)Judge:\nWhat are we to do without a Divination S\u00e9ance?Nahyuta:\nI suppose I shall have to deliver the last rites without them. The prosecution has already taken that into account when preparing for today. I am fully capable of proving the accused's guilt, with or without a Divination S\u00e9ance.Judge:\nHa ha ha ha ha! You never fail to impress, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.Phoenix:\n(This is bad... The Divination S\u00e9ance was my one and only hope.) Your Magistry, Her Benevolence said she isn't tired! So, shouldn't we try to find out why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed?Rayfa:\n!Judge:\nHow curious, Mr. Wright. Why have you suddenly taken such a keen interest in the Divination S\u00e9ance?Rayfa:\nYes, explain yourself! The Divination S\u00e9ance is for shedding light on an accused's crimes! It is the Holy Mother's hammer of wrath, that is ever poised to pound you into your grave! You should fear it, not plead for it!Phoenix:\n...I believe in my client. Plus, yesterday, somebody told me something that changed my mind: The Divination S\u00e9ance was once thought of as just another piece of evidence. If we were to correctly interpret the visions through careful analysis... ...then they would lead us to the truth behind what really happened. And the truth will show that my client, Maya Fey, is innocent.Maya:\nThe truth is, you don't have anything else to fall back on, huh, Nick?Phoenix:\n...Maya, please, you're not helping.Rayfa:\nHow dare you?! The voice of a mitamah is to be feared, not utilized by vile lawyers such as you!Nahyuta:\nS\u00e9ances exact a heavy toll upon the royal priestess. It would be best not to burden her any further. Or does the defense feel that it can pose no counterarguments without the S\u00e9ance?Phoenix:\nN-No, of course not! (He saw right through me! I'll have to find a way to make the Divination S\u00e9ance happen, or we're toast.)Judge:\nWell, since the Divination S\u00e9ance is not possible at this time, I see no other choice. Let us proceed with the trial without the S\u00e9ance, as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi suggested.Nahyuta:\nThank you, Your Magistry.Rayfa:\nWhy you...! I will not forget this, Barbed Head! This will NOT be the last you see of me!Nahyuta:\nNow then, I will now proceed by providing an outline of the case at hand.Judge:\nVery well. If the lead detective would please come to the stand, we may begin.Ema:\n........................ ...Sorry, Mr. Wright.Nahyuta:\nDetective Skye... I understand how you would wish to save the accused and the defense. They are your friends, after all. But you must let them go... and move on.Ema:\nB-But...!Nahyuta:\nThere is only one way to save them now: By giving their souls the chance to burn away the taint of their sins in the infernal flames.Ema:\nOoh... I... I... I can't do this!Judge:\nAh! No eating in the sacred Hall of Justice!Maya:\nMs. Skye!Ema:\nY-Yes?!Maya:\nDon't worry about me and Nick. You just do your job. I'm sure Nick will figure something out... eventually!Ema:\n............... Right. Thanks, Ms. Fey.Nahyuta:\nHow very brave for a criminal with a tainted soul. Very well, Detective Skye. Please proceed.Ema:\nOkay, I can do this... Let me start with an overview of this case.Witness Testimony-- Overview of the Second Murder --Ema:\nThe latest victim was Puhray Zeh'lot.\nHe had been training under the high priest, and living at his house for the past two years.\nThe high priest's widow Beh'leeb Inmee has identified the victim's body.\nHe may have been mistaken for a rebel and killed due to his connection to the high priest.Judge:\nI see... Well, that certainly makes sense. Would the defense care to respond?Phoenix:\n(I didn't spot any inconsistencies in her testimony so far. And I don't have any evidence in my arsenal. What am I going to do now?)Maya:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nWhat is it, Maya?Maya:\nI was just wondering about how much the police actually looked into Acolyte Zeh'lot. Because it just might prove to be the key as to why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed.Phoenix:\nWhat are you getting at?Maya:\nUmm, well... It's just a hunch.Phoenix:\n(Wait a second. During my investigation... ...Rayfa told me about how the Divination S\u00e9ance works. If I could figure out why it failed... ...maybe she could try it again. Okay! Time to press for some more information!)Cross-ExaminationCross-Examination-- Overview of the Second Murder --Ema:\nThe latest victim was Puhray Zeh'lot.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of person was Acolyte Zeh'lot?\nEma:\nAccording to the neighbors and others who knew him... ...he was a deeply devout youth.\nNahyuta:\nI, too, have heard his name mentioned as one who was a fervent practitioner. I suppose you might say he was the high priest's star disciple.\nEma:\nFurthermore...Ema:\nHe had been training under the high priest, and living at his house for the past two years.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nTwo years? Are you sure about that?\nEma:\nWe took statements from his neighbors and his fellow monks. They all corroborate our initial findings.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about you, Maya?\nMaya:\n...Well, when I first came here... ...I saw Zeh'lot praying under the high priest's instruction.\nPhoenix:\nI see... So the results of the police investigation seem to check out...Ema:\nThe high priest's widow Beh'leeb Inmee has identified the victim's body.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas Mrs. Inmee's positive ID the only way you verified the identity of the victim?\nEma:\nHuh? ...Well, no! We also checked the ID card he carried and the data in his family registry. But...\nPhoenix:\nBut what?\nEma:\nHis personal information didn't match any of the public records we cross-referenced.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe that's why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed.\nEma:\nI-I'm not sure what you mean, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nHere's what I'm thinking...\n\n\n\nHis address was wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe victim's address was wrong!\nEma:\nUm... Mr. Wright? Even if it was wrong, how would that affect the Divination S\u00e9ance?\nPhoenix:\nOh, uhh... You're right. It wouldn't. (What was it that a Divination S\u00e9ance required, again? Oh, right! Then there is only one possible answer!)\nEma:\nIt looks like the fact that his personal info wasn't in the public records isn't important.\nPhoenix:\nNo, Ema, it is important.\nLeads to:\n\"The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason...\"\n\n\n\n\nPuhray Zeh'lot is a fake name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason...\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe victim decided to hide his identity for some reason... In other words, he was using a fake name! The royal priestess uses a deceased's face and true name to summon their spirit.\nRayfa:\nWhy, yes, that is indeed true.\nNahyuta:\nIf he was using a forged ID and there is no mention of him in our public records... ...then he was likely an illegal immigrant. They are not uncommon here in Khura'in.\nPhoenix:\nAn illegal immigrant? (Come to think of it, Rayfa mentioned something about immigrants yesterday.)\nEma:\nBut if that's the case, we have no way of knowing who he really is. We'll have to proceed without holding a Divination S\u00e9ance this time.\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nI had always thought that Acolyte Zeh'lot was Khura'inese. Oh, how the high priest must be lamenting his disciple's deception in the Twilight Realm. Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think? Should we add this to the testimony?\n\n\n\nAdd it to the testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is an important fact. Please add it to the testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... It would seem to be a fact most inconvenient for the defense. But, if you insist. Detective Skye, please add what you just said to your testimony.\nEma:\nYes, Your Magistry.\nAdds statement \"He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.\"\n\n\n\n\nDon't add it to the testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Magistry. There's no need to add it to her testimony.\nJudge:\nVery well, then. Please continue if you would, Detective Skye.\nEma:\nYes, Your Magistry. We still don't know the victim's true identity, but...\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut the victim was using a fake name, so... ...he may very well have been in Khura'in illegally.\nEma:\nY-Yes, that's very likely the case.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that I have an opening, what next? It's still not going to help me learn Zeh'lot's true identity. Was he really an illegal alien?)Ema:\nHe was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIsn't there some way to track down his real name?\nEma:\nNo, not if he was an illegal immigrant.\nPhoenix:\nHave you actually confirmed that he was in Khura'in illegally?\nEma:\nWell, we don't have any conclusive evidence. But there's also no evidence of him being a citizen of Khura'in, either.\nPhoenix:\nHoh boy... Now what do we do...\nMaya:\nWhat if there was a clue in the evidence you gathered?\nPhoenix:\nThat's probably our only hope at this point. (If he really was an illegal immigrant, our proverbial goose is probably cooked.)Present Crime Photo (Zeh'lot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Sorry, Detective Skye...\"Ema:\nHe may have been mistaken for a rebel and killed due to his connection to the high priest.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya isn't that Lady Kee'ra who's been going around capturing rebels!\nEma:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Wright, but... \nNahyuta:\n\nNahyuta:\nThat verdict was already handed down in the previous trial. It is no longer a point of dispute, and I will not allow you to make it so.\nPhoenix:\nBut...!\nNahyuta:\nNo \"ifs,\" \"ands,\" and most of all, no \"buts.\" The accused was posing as Lady Kee'ra. And she killed Acolyte Zeh'lot because she mistakenly believed him to be a rebel.\nMaya:\nTh-That's not true!\nEma:\nI'm sorry... The verdict has already been read in that case. I have to assume that it's fact now.\nPhoenix:\nArngh!Before adding statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya, you mentioned that Ema's testimony might hold a clue as to why the S\u00e9ance failed.\nMaya:\nI did, but it's really just a hunch.\nPhoenix:\n(That might mean there was a mistake made during the investigation. It would have to be information that would impact the S\u00e9ance. Hmm, what could it be...?)After adding statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Now I know why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed, but...)\nMaya:\nUmm, nothing's really changed.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, which means we're in big trouble.\nMaya:\nIf he really was an illegal immigrant, it's going to be real hard to find out his real name...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess our only choice is to give up on the whole Divination S\u00e9ance thing.

But...\nPhoenix:\nBut what?\nEma:\nHis personal information didn't match any of the public records we cross-referenced.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe that's why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed.\nEma:\nI-I'm not sure what you mean, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nHere's what I'm thinking...\n\n\n\nHis address was wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe victim's address was wrong!\nEma:\nUm... Mr. Wright? Even if it was wrong, how would that affect the Divination S\u00e9ance?\nPhoenix:\nOh, uhh... You're right. It wouldn't. (What was it that a Divination S\u00e9ance required, again? Oh, right! Then there is only one possible answer!)\nEma:\nIt looks like the fact that his personal info wasn't in the public records isn't important.\nPhoenix:\nNo, Ema, it is important.\nLeads to:\n\"The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason...\"\n\n\n\n\nPuhray Zeh'lot is a fake name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The victim decided to hide his identity for some reason...\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe victim decided to hide his identity for some reason... In other words, he was using a fake name! The royal priestess uses a deceased's face and true name to summon their spirit.\nRayfa:\nWhy, yes, that is indeed true.\nNahyuta:\nIf he was using a forged ID and there is no mention of him in our public records... ...then he was likely an illegal immigrant. They are not uncommon here in Khura'in.\nPhoenix:\nAn illegal immigrant? (Come to think of it, Rayfa mentioned something about immigrants yesterday.)\nEma:\nBut if that's the case, we have no way of knowing who he really is. We'll have to proceed without holding a Divination S\u00e9ance this time.\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nI had always thought that Acolyte Zeh'lot was Khura'inese. Oh, how the high priest must be lamenting his disciple's deception in the Twilight Realm. Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think? Should we add this to the testimony?\n\n\n\nAdd it to the testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is an important fact. Please add it to the testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... It would seem to be a fact most inconvenient for the defense. But, if you insist. Detective Skye, please add what you just said to your testimony.\nEma:\nYes, Your Magistry.\nAdds statement \"He was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.\"\n\n\n\n\nDon't add it to the testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Magistry. There's no need to add it to her testimony.\nJudge:\nVery well, then. Please continue if you would, Detective Skye.\nEma:\nYes, Your Magistry. We still don't know the victim's true identity, but...\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut the victim was using a fake name, so... ...he may very well have been in Khura'in illegally.\nEma:\nY-Yes, that's very likely the case.\nPhoenix:\n(Now that I have an opening, what next? It's still not going to help me learn Zeh'lot's true identity. Was he really an illegal alien?)Ema:\nHe was an illegal immigrant, so we don't know his real name.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIsn't there some way to track down his real name?\nEma:\nNo, not if he was an illegal immigrant.\nPhoenix:\nHave you actually confirmed that he was in Khura'in illegally?\nEma:\nWell, we don't have any conclusive evidence. But there's also no evidence of him being a citizen of Khura'in, either.\nPhoenix:\nHoh boy... Now what do we do...\nMaya:\nWhat if there was a clue in the evidence you gathered?\nPhoenix:\nThat's probably our only hope at this point. (If he really was an illegal immigrant, our proverbial goose is probably cooked.)Present Crime Photo (Zeh'lot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Sorry, Detective Skye...\"Ema:\nHe may have been mistaken for a rebel and killed due to his connection to the high priest.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya isn't that Lady Kee'ra who's been going around capturing rebels!\nEma:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Wright, but... \nNahyuta:\n\nNahyuta:\nThat verdict was already handed down in the previous trial. It is no longer a point of dispute, and I will not allow you to make it so.\nPhoenix:\nBut...!\nNahyuta:\nNo \"ifs,\" \"ands,\" and most of all, no \"buts.\" The accused was posing as Lady Kee'ra. And she killed Acolyte Zeh'lot because she mistakenly believed him to be a rebel.\nMaya:\nTh-That's not true!\nEma:\nI'm sorry... The verdict has already been read in that case. I have to assume that it's fact now.\nPhoenix:\nArngh!Before adding statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya, you mentioned that Ema's testimony might hold a clue as to why the S\u00e9ance failed.\nMaya:\nI did, but it's really just a hunch.\nPhoenix:\n(That might mean there was a mistake made during the investigation. It would have to be information that would impact the S\u00e9ance. Hmm, what could it be...?)After adding statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Now I know why the Divination S\u00e9ance failed, but...)\nMaya:\nUmm, nothing's really changed.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, which means we're in big trouble.\nMaya:\nIf he really was an illegal immigrant, it's going to be real hard to find out his real name...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess our only choice is to give up on the whole Divination S\u00e9ance thing. If only there was some way to find out the victim's real name...)Phoenix:\nSorry, Detective Skye... But the police missed something important in their investigation.Ema:\nHuh?! Wh-What are you talking about?!Phoenix:\nThe victim was undeniably a Khura'inese native! And this crime scene photo proves it.Judge:\nI-It does?!Phoenix:\nIt's a little hard to see, but look closely. You'll see clear proof that the victim was Khura'inese.Ema:\nWh-Where? I don't see anything that would prove that!Phoenix:\nThis proves the victim was Khura'inese!Present neck tattoo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Look at this tattoo right here!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nHmm...  fail to understand how that proves anything.\nPhoenix:\nOh, don't worry, Your Magistry. I don't understand it, either!\nJudge:\nYour ineptitude is equally unfathomable, defense!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... I better take a good look at that photo again.)\nJudge:\nYour claim that the victim was Khura'inese... Is it not but another one of your lawyerly untruths?\nPhoenix:\nNo. If you look here in this photo, you'll see that he's definitely Khura'inese!\nLeads back to:\n\"This proves the victim was Khura'inese!\"Phoenix:\nLook at this tattoo right here!Judge:\nWhy that's... a tattoo of a peach?Phoenix:\nI would like you all to think about the meaning of this tattoo.Ema:\nOh, umm... The victim really liked peaches?Judge:\nWell, peaches are a favored delicacy here in Khura'in.Nahyuta:\nThey happen to be a personal favorite of mine. The sweetness of their abundant nectars and the softness of their perfectly ripe flesh... They are a blessing from the Holy Mother herself.Maya:\nNick, I've suddenly got a craving for peaches!Phoenix:\n...After the trial, Maya. Right now we have bigger fish to fry. Unfortunately, that is NOT a tattoo of a peach.Nahyuta:\n...It is not a peach, you say? Then what is it?Phoenix:\nTake a closer look. Haven't you seen something like that before? Namely, the tattoo on the high priest's brow.Judge:\nOh, my!Ema:\nWhat?!Phoenix:\nThis mark is only borne by members of the Khura'inist clergy!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nSo that is what you believe it to be. But are they not utterly different shapes?Phoenix:\nSure, they're shaped differently, but there's a reason for that. The victim had the peach-shaped tattoo inked over an existing tattoo for some reason. However, the dark red portion is exactly the same as the mark all Khura'inist clergy bear.Ema:\nHey, you're right!Judge:\nHmm... Until about twenty-some-odd years ago, everyone did get one, didn't they? I myself bear one on my right buttoc--Nahyuta:\nThat is entirely too much information, Your Magistry.Phoenix:\nInformation on everyone who enters the clergy is maintained at the temple! All we have to do is look up a monk with a mark in the same spot!Ema:\nI'm on it! I'll let you know if I get any hits!Nahyuta:\nThat will not be necessary. If you seek information on the clergy... ...I have it all right here.Judge:\nOh, my! You never cease to amaze! ...So, tell us, is there anyone who fits the bill?Nahyuta:\n.............................. ...There is just one, and his name is Rheel Neh'mu. He became a monk twenty years ago.Phoenix:\nThen that must be the victim's real name.Judge:\nBut why would he have tried to cover up his tattoo with another one?Phoenix:\n(Yeah... There must've been some reason...)Maya:\nNick! That's not important right now. The important thing is we know his real name.Phoenix:\nYou're right! Your Magistry! Now that we know the victim's real name... ...the Divination S\u00e9ance might finally work!Judge:\nHmm... A lawyer who willingly seeks a S\u00e9ance... This is entirely unprecedented.Nahyuta:\nHeh. You are but digging your own grave, defense.Phoenix:\nWe won't know that until we try. (Sure, it's risky, but it's our only hope!)Judge:\nVery well. Let the Divination S\u00e9ance be held once more!Rayfa:\n.............................. Why would a lawyer work so hard to see the Divination S\u00e9ance be held once more? You are a fool, Barbed Head. And your foolishness shall yield no gratitude from me. For with the truth revealed by my Insights, I shall gladly seek your demise!Phoenix:\n...Bring it on, Princess. Because I will correctly interpret each and every one of your Insights.Rayfa:\nHmph! You will regret ever thinking you could use my sacred Insights as evidence. O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination S\u00e9ance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!Judge:\n...Oh, my! It is just as Mr. Wright surmised. Puhray Zeh'lot wasn't the victim's true name! And now at last, we have seen the victim's final moments!Phoenix:\nB-But... All we could see was the ground!Nahyuta:\nYou seem terribly disappointed. I take it you did not find any fodder for one of your infamous turnabouts?Phoenix:\nNgrk!Nahyuta:\nI, on the other hand, have discovered something: Conclusive evidence that establishes the accused's guilt!Phoenix:\nY-You did?!Judge:\nHa ha ha ha ha! A most surprising surprise attack! ...So, tell us, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, what is this conclusive evidence you have found?Nahyuta:\n...The Plumed Punisher theme song that the deceased heard. Please consider this item here. It was confiscated from the accused during her interrogation.Maya:\nHey, that's my Plumed Punisher strap!Nahyuta:\nWhen you press the magatama on the Plumed Punisher's belt...Phoenix:\nAaaaaaaaaah!Nahyuta:\nIt seems the accused inadvertently pressed the button in the midst of her crime. This strap is an extremely rare item, is it not, Ms. Fey?Maya:\nYou'd better not break it! There's only one of those in the whole wide world!Phoenix:\nM-Maya, noooooooooo!Rayfa:\nHeh heh heh heh! It is just as I said. Your flights of fancy... have come crashing down on you!Maya:\nShe sure seems to be enjoying this.Phoenix:\nYeah... I've never seen her look so thrilled before either.Rayfa:\nIt is time to accept the fact that the Divination S\u00e9ance is far more than mere evidence! It is the very truth that brings the hammer of justice down upon the accused!Judge:\nThat is as conclusive as evidence can get. Now then, if there are no further objections...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nSlow down there, Your Magistry. At least let me make a counterargument!Judge:\nWhat's this? Do you take issue with the Divination S\u00e9ance?Phoenix:\n(Oh, I have issues with it. I just don't know what they are yet. But that's never stopped me before!) The Divination S\u00e9ance is not the absolute truth! It only becomes the truth after it's been interpreted correctly.Rayfa:\nGrr! You do not know when you are beaten, do you, you foolish lawyer. I am the only one who speaks for the mitamah of the deceased! If you believe there to be errors in my Insights, then let us see you prove it!Insight-- Rayfa's Insight --Rayfa:\nThe victim was offering up his prayers...\nIt was the night of the rite.

As they stand now, those Insights are really stacked against us. I'll just have to go over each and every one of the deceased's sensations very carefully.)The victim was offering up his prayers...It was the night of the rite.

It could not be otherwise! The accused slew Acolyte Zeh'lot after killing the high priest during the Purification Rite.Phoenix:\nThe only problem is, the deceased's spirit does not corroborate that.Rayfa:\nWhat's this?!Phoenix:\nTake a good look at what the victim smelled. Do you see how it says \"gingihl\"? Acolyte Zeh'lot shouldn't have smelled any gingihl on the night of the rite!Judge:\nWh-What do you mean?Phoenix:\nLet me back up my statement with some evidence for you. This should explain how the victim couldn't have smelled gingihl on the night of the rite!Present Beh'leeb's Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The high priest's wife, Beh'leeb Inmee, told me about the Feast of Blessings.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\t\t\t\nJudge:\n............... To be frank, your assertion stinks, defense.\nPhoenix:\nDoes it smell that bad?\nJudge:\nIndeed. I nearly passed out from the stench.\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't know my bluffs had such a pungent aroma...)\nJudge:\nIt would seem that the smell of gingihl is unrelated to the case at hand.\nPhoenix:\nNo, the fact that the victim smelled gingihl is extremely important. It's important because the smell shouldn't have been present on the night of the rite.\nLeads back to:\n\"This should explain how the victim couldn't have smelled gingihl on the night of the rite!\"Phoenix:\nThe high priest's wife, Beh'leeb Inmee, told me about the Feast of Blessings. The feast includes a number of gingihl-based dishes. And they're only supposed to be served at a certain time the day before the rite!Judge:\nWhy, I believe you're right! I had completely forgotten about that.Phoenix:\nDuring the feast, the unique smell of gingihl pervades the entire kingdom. The fact that the victim smelled it means... ...he was murdered between noon and 3 PM the day before the Purification Rite!Rayfa:Rayfa:\nHmph. I am not so easily fooled! Did that autopsy report not make it clear? The estimated time of death was during the rite!Phoenix:\n(Oh, right. I taught her about that yesterday.) Forgive me, Your Benevolence... ...but the estimated time of death is just that -- an estimate. Depending on the circumstances, it's possible for it to change.Rayfa:\nWh-What's this?!Phoenix:\nLike, if a body was kept cold, the slowed rate of decay makes the death seem more recent.Judge:\nWhy, I believe I have heard something of the sort before. Hmm... If it is as Mr. Wright claims... ...the estimated time of death in the autopsy report will have to be revised.Zeh'lot's Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Rayfa:\nNnnggrrrrrrrrrrr! Barbed Head! You... You blinded me with science!Phoenix:\nS-Sorry... (Wait, what am I apologizing for?)Rayfa:\nHmph. ...No matter. The murder may have occurred in the afternoon hours the day before the rite. Nevertheless... The murder weapon with the accused's prints on it is incontrovertible evidence.

Augh! You are making that irritating face again! Cease that at once!Phoenix:\nSorry, but this is the face I was born with. Now, let's focus on what is important -- what the victim saw in his final moments.Rayfa:\nDo you have bats in the belfry, Barbed Head? There is nothing to see. The ground at the plaza was all that entered the victim's eyes.Phoenix: \nAnd that's what I find so strange.

What piece of evidence shows that the plaza ground was not visible that day?\nLeads back to:\n\"This piece of evidence shows why the plaza's ground was not visible that day!\"Phoenix:\nThis newspaper has an article that is tiny in size, but huge in importance. It says that the ground was covered with \"thick, white ice\" the day before the rite.Rayfa:\nWhat?! B-But...!Judge:\nThe victim did not see so much as an ice cube on the ground!Phoenix:\nExactly. And so we must ask: What WAS the victim looking at in his final moments?Rayfa:\nIf you have something to say, then say it!Phoenix:\nThe last thing the victim saw was not the ground at the Plaza of Devotion. This can only mean that he was killed elsewhere!Rayfa:\nWha--!Nahyuta:\nWha--!Judge:\nWha... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!

Any ideas, Maya?Maya:\nUmm... Let me think... Well... it's somewhere green and shaggy, right?Phoenix:\nRight, but where could that be?Rayfa:\nWhat is it, Barbed Head?

Now, show me where you believe the victim was killed.\nLeads back to:\n\"This is what the victim saw in his final moments!\"Phoenix:\nThe shaggy green surface the victim saw was one of the moss-covered stone slabs!

However, one cannot definitely declare they are one and the same.Judge:\nI concur. There is no proof that a murder occurred in the rebel hideout.Rayfa:\nIndeed! What evidence do you have of this?!Phoenix:\nI've already shown you the evidence.Judge:\nWh-What do you mean?Phoenix:\nPlease take a look at this second version of the photo I just showed you.

Detective Skye, your report, please.Ema:\nThe blood found in the rebel hideout... ...belongs to Puhray Zeh'lot, just like the defense claims!Nahyuta:\nDetective Skye, do you realize what your blunder has done to me?

Please, anything but that!Maya:\n...Nick, maybe, just maybe... ...this is the chance we've been waiting for!Phoenix:\nYep, it would seem so. (I hate to do this to Ema, but...)Maya:\nGo for it! It's full speed ahead!Phoenix:\nThe victim was killed in the rebel hideout the day before the Purification Rite. Then, his body was moved to the Plaza of Devotion by someone we've yet to identify! So, when we thought we saw Acolyte Zeh'lot praying during the rite, he was already dead!Rayfa:\nAaaaaaugh!Phoenix:\nAnd that's not all. If he was killed at the Inner Sanctum, that would explain one more thing.Judge:\nAnd that would be...?Phoenix:\nHow the time of death was made to look later than it actually was. The proof of which, was left behind at the sanctum.

The proof is right here in this photo. This is how the time of death was made to appear later than it really was. Do you see how the snow has been removed from this one spot only? That's because it was used to keep the victim's body cold. And that's why the time of death wasn't what it seemed!Rayfa:Rayfa:\nThe time was mistaken? And the place, too?

Then that leaves...)\nRayfa:\nYou have not found any contradictions with the evidence!\nPhoenix:\nBut the fact that the murder didn't occur at the plaza DOES affect the evidence!

Do not twist the facts with your lawyerly wiles! Either way, the accused would still be guilty based off of her prints on the murder weapon. And here is what really happened!Insight RevisedThe victim was offering up his prayers...\nThe victim stood with his hands on the stone slab in the hideout.It was the afternoon of the day before the rite. Though it's dark, the pattern on the plaza's ground was visible. (Changed from [It was the afternoon of the day before the rite. Though a bit dark, the pattern on the plaza's ground was visible.] in the original release)\nIt was the afternoon of the day before the rite.Rayfa:\nThough there have been some twists and turns, that is the truth of what happened.Phoenix:\nArngh! (I won't get anywhere until I can eliminate the dagger.)Judge:\nMost impressive, Your Benevolence. I see no inconsistencies anywhere in the prosecution's case.Phoenix:\nNo, there is one!Judge:\nWhat's this?! You still claim there to be an inconsistency?!Rayfa:\nHmph. Try as you might, the outcome will always be the same.The victim stood with his hands on the stone slab in the hideout.Present Heavy (Touch) on third or fourth panels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The victim was originally thought to have been stabbed while bent over in prayer.\"It was the afternoon of the day before the rite.Then, someone was there... and the theme to \"The Plumed Punisher\" filled the air...The accused held the defenseless victim down and plunged her knife into his neck. (Changed from [The accused held the victim down and plunged her dagger into his upper back.] in the original release)The blade struck true, and in that instant, he departed from this world...Phoenix:\nThe victim was originally thought to have been stabbed while bent over in prayer. But he was actually standing with his hands against the stone slab. So the question is, where did the sensation of something heavy come from?Judge:\nHmm. Yes, I see your point.Phoenix:\nSince the victim was standing, he couldn't have been held down.Rayfa:\nEeeep!Judge:\nThen tell us, Mr. Wright, what was that heavy sensation felt by the victim?Phoenix:\nHmm... What caused the heavy sensation Zeh'lot felt? Any thoughts, Maya?Maya:\nUhh... I agree, that sense of heaviness seems important, but... There's also the matter of Zeh'lot's hands on the stone slab. Why were they even there?Phoenix:\nCould it be related to the cause of the heavy sensation?Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Do you have an answer for us?Phoenix:\nO-Of course! (If I just envision the state Zeh'lot was in when he was killed...) The cause of the heaviness the victim felt was...The falling stone slab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The only conceivable cause is...\"The culprit jumping on him\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe killer jumped on him from behind!\nRayfa:\nHmm... Why do you suppose the killer would do that?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe they craved human contact!\nJudge:\nPeople who crave human contact do not kill those they seek contact with. But it's clear you've lost contact... with reality!\nPhoenix:\nTalk about a reality check...\nMaya:\nWasn't there something really heavy in the rebel hideout?\nPhoenix:\nOf course! That's it! The cause of the heavy sensation...!\nLeads to:\n\"The only conceivable cause is...\"Phoenix:\nThe only conceivable cause is... ...the stone slab falling over, trapping the victim underneath!Judge:\nWhat?!Rayfa:\n...!Maya:\nOh...! The stone slab came falling down on him, crushing him underneath.Phoenix:\nRight. That was the cause of the heavy sensation the victim felt.Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nWhile your theory is impressive, you have overlooked a key fact. The victim was not crushed to death. Rather, he was stabbed.Phoenix:\nO-Oh yeah...Nahyuta:\nOr do you claim that the dagger was plunged in after the slab had fallen on him? Plus, had the killer been behind the victim, they would have both been crushed together.Judge:\nWell? Would you care to explain?Phoenix:\n(Sure, I'd love to. That doesn't mean I can! Hmm... How could the dagger have been plunged in after the slab fell on the victim?) The killer couldn't have plunged the dagger into the victim after the slab fell on him. But, what if the murder weapon wasn't what we thought it was?Nahyuta:\nWell, there WERE other weapons in the rebel hideout. But the entrance to the hideout is right by the stone slab. There isn't enough space between the two to use any of the weapons found within.Phoenix:\nYeah... There's not much space by the entrance, is there... (So, what was the real murder weapon, then? I better think of something!)Maya:\nIf the murder weapon wasn't the dagger... ...then the dagger must've been plunged into the victim after he was already dead. That means he was stabbed at least twice, but the autopsy doesn't mention that.Phoenix:\nThen he must've been stabbed in the same spot with something shaped like the dagger.Nahyuta:\nWould the defense care to offer an explanation sometime this century?Phoenix:\n(Wait, wasn't there something dagger-like near the scene of the crime? ...Something that had a shape similar to the Warbaa'd Dagger?)Judge:\nPresent your evidence at this time, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nThis shows what really killed the victim!Present Inner Sanctum Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Is this not the photo from the scene of the high priest's murder?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nNahyuta:\n........................... He was stabbed with a dagger-shaped object... Those were your exact words, were they not?!\nJudge:\nI do not see any similarities with the evidence presented.\nPhoenix:\nAck... Now that you mention it...\nJudge:\nYour ignorance shall cut you like a knife, defense.\nMaya:\nSomething shaped like a dagger...\nPhoenix:\nI better compare the shape of the dagger with the rest of the evidence again.\nJudge:\nNow then, I would have the defense cut the nonsense and offer a proper answer this time. What really killed the victim, if it wasn't the dagger?\nLeads back to:\t\n\"This shows what really killed the victim!\"Judge:\nIs this not the photo from the scene of the high priest's murder? Are you suggesting the murder weapon is hidden herein?Phoenix:\nThis is what really took Puhray Zeh'lot's life!Present warbaa'd statue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"B-But that is the...!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\n..................

Indeed! Perhaps the real murder weapon was the defense's own cranium!\nPhoenix:\nYou won't be laughing after I show you what really killed the victim!\nJudge:\nWell, you will not be laughing after this penalty, either!\nPhoenix:\nYowch! (Let's try that again... It's right here in the photo... The sharp object that took Zeh'lot's life!)\nLeads back to:\n\"This is what really took Puhray Zeh'lot's life!\"Judge:\nB-But that is the...!Rayfa:\nThe warbaa'd statue?!Phoenix:\nExactly! The warbaa'd statue has dagger-like feathers protruding from it. That is what really took the victim's life!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nYou imbecilic fool! The statue is outside of the hideout! How do you propose it impaled someone who was inside?Phoenix:\nHaven't you heard? The warbaa'd statue also functions as the hideout's door.Nahyuta:\n...What do you mean?Phoenix:\nThe statue can pull a complete switcheroo!Nahyuta:\nA switch... eroo...?Phoenix:\nTo put it simply... it's a revolving door!Judge:\nA revolving door?! Why, that makes perfect sense!Phoenix:\nTherefore, I believe the truth behind the Divination S\u00e9ance to be this! As the victim entered the secret hideout, the stone sculpture came toppling toward him. He threw up his hands to stop it, but its weight forced him backwards. Unfortunately, the warbaa'd statue was right behind him.Rayfa:\nTh-This... This cannot be...!Rayfa:Rayfa:\nB-But the accused's fingerprints were found on the dagger!Phoenix:\nShe had held it while rehearsing for the rite. Which is when her prints got on it!Nahyuta:\n...Gah!Judge:\nThis is a shocking turn of events, but... ...there is a great deal of circumstantial evidence in the defense's favor. I believe we must accept that the warbaa'd statue was what killed the victim.Warbaa'd Statue added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nNow that we know how Acolyte Zeh'lot really met his demise... ...there's no basis for claiming my client committed this crime!Maya:\nNice work, Nick!Rayfa:\n...How can this be happening yet again? The Divination S\u00e9ance... is the only truth!Phoenix:\nNo, Your Benevolence. It's not the truth itself, but it IS a means for shedding light on the truth!Rayfa:\nNnngh!Phoenix:\nDo you understand now? Your kingdom needs lawyers so that they can interpret your Insights.Rayfa:\nB-But... That means I... ...I have been misinterpreting the voices of the spirits all this time?Judge:\nY-Your Benevolence! Are you unwell? All the color has drained from your face.Rayfa:\n........................ I will be fine. Continue your proceedings without me.Judge:\n...As you wish.Phoenix:\n(I feel kind of bad for her.)Judge:\nNow then, I would have the defense continue. Please explain what you have learned now that we know how the victim actually died.Phoenix:\nAcolyte Zeh'lot was killed in the hideout before the high priest's murder. That means the body found at the Plaza of Devotion was moved there by the real killer... ...but only after the Warbaa'd Dagger was thrust into him... ...to make it look like the murder weapon.Judge:\nTh-That does seem to agree with what we now know. But why would the real killer go to such lengths?Phoenix:\nI believe stabbing Acolyte Zeh'lot's body with the dagger and moving it to the plaza was...A warning from the Twilight Realm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was a warning from the Twilight Realm. You know, something like... \"Thou shalt not leave bodies lying around the Inner Sanctum.\"\nNahyuta:\nYou putrid-headed lawyer. Have you already forgotten? The high priest's body WAS left lying in the Inner Sanctum.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right.\nNahyuta:\nIf the killer did not wish for bodies to be left at the Inner Sanctum... ...they would have moved the high priest's corpse, as well.\nPhoenix:\n(W-Well, he's not wrong...)\nJudge:\nHow is this for a warning, Mr. Wright? Thou shalt not offer half-baked answers!\nPhoenix:\n(Next time, I better look before I leap.)\nJudge:\nHmm. It seems the reason why the body was moved will remain a mystery.\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Magistry. I believe I can explain why!\nLeads back to:\n\"I believe stabbing Acolyte Zeh'lot's body with the dagger and moving it to the plaza was...\"A crime committed for fun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaybe this was a crime committed for fun. The killer is someone who loves watching people react to murder scenes. That explains why they placed the body where so many people would see it!\nNahyuta:\nBut then why would the killer bother meddling with the estimated time of death?\nPhoenix:\nOh, umm... That's a good point.\nJudge:\nSitting through your silly answers is no fun, but I do enjoy levying penalties afterwards.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... Well, I don't.)\nJudge:\nHmm. It seems the reason why the body was moved will remain a mystery.\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Magistry. I believe I can explain why!\nLeads back to:\n\"I believe stabbing Acolyte Zeh'lot's body with the dagger and moving it to the plaza was...\"To make it look like a serial murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It was an attempt to make my client look like a serial killer.\"Phoenix:\nIt was an attempt to make my client look like a serial killer. That's right! The real killer planned all of this. This forged serial murder case!Judge:\nThey did?!Maya:\nThat's it, Nick! Keep hammering away!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\n\nYour reasoning has more holes in it than that cheese you foreigners so enjoy.Phoenix:\nWhat...?Nahyuta:\nLike those putrid, hole-riddled clumps of curds that only a rat like you could love... ...your reasoning, much like your putrid, hole-riddled brain, has putrefied.Phoenix:\n(What's his deal with things going putrid...?)Nahyuta:\nYou have yet to overturn my argument that the accused is the killer. A careful analysis of the chain of events up to the killing exposes the truth as follows: Disguised as Lady Kee'ra, the accused found the rebel hideout the day before the rite. But Acolyte Zeh'lot had followed her there after noticing her suspicious behavior. Caught by surprise, she pushed the stone slab toward him... and we know the rest.Maya:\nI-I've never been to the rebel hideout in my life!Nahyuta:\nWhen the high priest arrived at the sanctum the next day, he realized what she had done. That is when the accused murdered him in order to silence him.Judge:\nHmm... I believe Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has posed a compelling scenario. The defense, on the other hand, has yet to disprove the accused's guilt.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nWhy would my client move Acolyte Zeh'lot's body to where everyone could see it? And why would she stab the dagger with her fingerprints into his dead body? She had no reason to do any of those things!Nahyuta:\nThe dagger in his corpse was likely a warning to the rebels. Something along the lines of \"Lady Kee'ra will slay the Defiant Dragons.\"Judge:\nSo that is why she moved the body to the plaza for all to see...Phoenix:\n(Now he has the judge convinced, too?! I thought I'd finally made some headway!)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? About time for one of your groans of distress, is it not?Phoenix:\n(\"G-Groan of distress\"...? It kills me to admit this, but I've got nothing to counter his argument with. And I still haven't disproven the allegations against Maya.)Judge:\nIs it not time to end your futile struggle? You were already judged guilty yesterday. That makes you a dead lawyer walking. Accept the death that now awaits you, and in doing so, finally know peace.Nahyuta:\nA dead lawyer walking, indeed... Then again, are not all lawyers who practice in Khura'in? But I must admit, I misspoke earlier. Allow me to amend my statement. I had said the defense's reasoning had a putrid, cheese-like smell... ...but I now realize the stench was from his own putrid body, on the verge of death.Phoenix:\n(Now I'm a rotting zombie... Think... Who could've killed Zeh'lot the day before the rite? Who knew about the rebel hideout, and could gain access to the Inner Sanctum?)Maya:\nHmm... Only those involved with the rite can enter the sanctum, so...Phoenix:\n...Wait a second! (Only a rebel would've known about the secret hideout. And the only person who was involved with the rite, had access to the sanctum... ...and was suspected of being a rebel is...) Ahhhhhhhhh!Maya:\nDid somebody come to mind?Phoenix:\nY-Yes... Except there's one huge problem.Maya:\nA huge problem?Nahyuta:\nWhat are you two going on about? Plotting your escape from this sacred hall? I would not put it past you, considering you have no means to raise further objection.Phoenix:\n(If I don't do something, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi will have this one in the bag. I'll just have to bluff my way out of this, regardless of that huge problem.) Your Magistry, I believe there is another suspect in Puhray Zeh'lot's murder!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nEven the most benevolent Holy Mother would not forgive such a desperate lie. After all, you know very well that such a person does not exist.Phoenix:\nN-No, there is one person who knew everything!Judge:\nD-Does such a figure truly exist?! Tell us, who might that be?Phoenix:\nI believe the prime suspect in Acolyte Zeh'lot's murder is...!Present Tahrust Inmee profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It had to be someone allowed to enter the sanctum, and who knew of the hideout.\"Present Maya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe prime suspect in Acolyte Zeh'lot's murder is my client, Maya Fey!\nMaya:\nWh... Whaaaaaaaat?! Wh-Why would you say such a thing, Nick?!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry, Maya. I had to say something, and I guess I just panicked.\nJudge:\nI pity the accused or being saddled with such a rash lawyer.\nMaya:\nJeez! This is all your fault, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nD-Don't worry, Maya! I'll get it right this time!\nJudge:\nIf you fail to give a serious answer this time, I will personally put a muzzle on you. Now, who is this new suspect you believe to have killed the victim?\nLeads back to:\n\"I believe the prime suspect in Acolyte Zeh'lot's murder is...!\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nNahyuta:\nDo you truly believe that person to be the killer?\nJudge:\nHmm. I, too, find it hard to believe.\nPhoenix:\nUlp... I guess that makes three.\nJudge:\nThree strikes and you're out, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nArgh,  I'd better rethink my strategy... (I'm looking for someone who was allowed to enter the sanctum and knew of the hideout. Such a person could very well have killed Zeh'lot!) \nJudge:\nIf you fail to give a serious answer this time, I will personally put a muzzle on you. Now, who is this new suspect you believe to have killed the victim?\nLeads back to:\n\"I believe the prime suspect in Acolyte Zeh'lot's murder is...!\"Phoenix:\nIt had to be someone allowed to enter the sanctum, and who knew of the hideout. And that would be... the high priest. He could've committed the crime if it occurred the day before the rite!Nahyuta:\nYou would pin a crime upon the dead, knowing very well they tell no tales? Have you no shame!Phoenix:\n(Dead men tell no tales... That is definitely a problem. If only the high priest could tell his side of the story.)Maya:\n...Umm. Hmm... ...Wh-What? Do I have something on my face?Phoenix:\n...Wait a second! (Could this actually work?!)Maya:\nOh, no! Don't tell me I have some of my breakfast caught between my teeth!Phoenix:\n(No, if there's even the slightest possibility, I'll have to go with it!) Your Magistry! Dead men DO tell tales! Therefore, I would like to request the high priest's testimony!Judge:\nHis... testimony?! And just how do you propose we get the deceased to testify?Phoenix:\nThere's a way for the dead to testify! It's known as...!Divination S\u00e9ance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAll we have to do is have another Divination S\u00e9ance with the high priest's spirit!\nNahyuta:\nWe already conducted a S\u00e9ance with his spirit during the previous trial. What do you possibly hope to gain from another one?\nPhoenix:\nOh, right...\nJudge:\nSpeak of that sacred ritual needlessly, defense, and reap the consequences.\nPhoenix:\n(How could we get a dead man to tell his tale?

But spirit channeling is a secret art that only Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran can perform. And Her Eminence is far too busy with other duties to perform it at our pleasure.Phoenix:\n(I suspected as much. That means our only hope is...)Maya:\n..................... ...It's okay, Nick. You can tell them.Phoenix:\nBut, Maya...! I thought you wanted to keep it a secret here in Khura'in.Maya:\nDon't worry. It's not like it's against the law or violates some religious precepts, so... ...I don't think we'll be punished. At least, I hope not.Phoenix:\nBut this is a crucial period for you. It'll decide whether you become master of Kurain.Maya:\nWe don't have any other choice, now do we? If I'm found guilty, it'll be a lot worse than not becoming master of Kurain.Phoenix:\n...All right.

Shall we not cut to the chase, and ask the most pressing of questions?Phoenix:\n...Oh, right!Nahyuta:\nAbbot Inmee, the prosecution believes the one who slew both you and Acolyte Zeh'lot... ...to be Maya Fey, who had been playing the role of Lady Kee'ra in the rite.Tahrust:\nHrrm.

It is all coming back to me. It is as Prosecutor Sahdmadhi concluded. I was slain by none other than Maya Fey.Nahyuta:\nThe high priest's statement has proven my assertions with regards to his murder correct.Phoenix:\nNOOOOOOOOO! B-But what about Acolyte Zeh'lot?! You were the one who killed him, weren't you?Tahrust:\nHrrmm...? I know naught about my disciple's murder. Furthermore, I have an alibi of my own.Phoenix:\nAn alibi?! Seriously?!Judge:\nHa ha ha ha!

I believe this can be explained thusly... He must have had a way to monitor the hideout from his home.Phoenix:\nWhat?!Tahrust:\n.................. Y-You never cease to amaze, Prosecutor. As he has surmised, there was a listening device installed at the hideout. It enabled me to instantly learn of anything unusual, even when I was not there.Nahyuta:\nRemember, the rebels had been using this as a top-secret hideout.

A microphone? What's this doing here? Was someone trying to record something with it?)Phoenix:\n(That was a listening device...?)Tahrust:\nIt starts recording whenever it detects movement.

It would follow that his favorite disciple could very well be a rebel, too!Judge:\nA-Are you suggesting that Mrs. Inmee killed her husband, as well?Phoenix:\nAs sad as it is to think she'd kill her own husband to rid the kingdom of rebels... ...I don't think we can rule it out.Tahrust:Tahrust:\n............... KAAAAAAAAAH!Phoenix:\nUrk!Judge:\nYikes!Tahrust:\nYou claim my wife is that rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra? And that she slew both Zeh'lot and myself? My lovely wife?! That is utterly impossible! KAAAAAAAAAH!Phoenix:\nUrk!Judge:\nYikes! I have never seen the high priest so angry!Nahyuta:\nIt is as Abbot Inmee stated. And the accused has already been found guilty of his murder. It is far too late to overturn it.Judge:\nTh-That's right, Mr. Wright! N-Now apologize to the good priest before he gets angry again! Quickly now!Phoenix:\nNo, I'm not going to apologize! The true identity of Lady Kee'ra is a major piece to this trial's puzzle! Admit it, Abbot Inmee -- your wife, Lady Inmee, killed you. Yet even now, you continue to lie in an effort to protect her.Tahrust:Tahrust:\nHow absurd! It appears the lawyer has forgotten. My lovely wife could not possibly battle the rebels in the guise of Lady Kee'ra. For we were blessed by Her Holiness and she is with child! Praise be to the Holy Mother!Phoenix:\n(Ack, I completely forgot about that.)Tahrust:\nThat abominable Lady Kee'ra figure who slew me and Acolyte Zeh'lot was the accused!Phoenix:\n(This is bad, but I can't give up now!) D-Don't forget! My client doesn't have the strength to fight rebels, either!Tahrust:\n..................Phoenix:\nHow could a weak young woman like her possibly...Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\n\nYou foolish oaf of a lawyer. If only you were as blessed as Lady Inmee.Phoenix:\nWhat?Nahyuta:\nSurely, the accused possesses the strength -- or should I say, the power. ...The power to battle those black-hearted rebels.Phoenix:\nWh-What are you talking about?Tahrust:\n...My good prosecutor, I see you have come to the same conclusion as I. Such keen insight!Nahyuta:\nThen you have figured it out as well, Abbot Inmee? May I ask you to explain it to this putrid-brained lawyer?Tahrust:\nCertainly. For I cannot allow him to frame my lovely wife for murder! Foreign devil! Your Magistry, allow me to testify as to how Maya Fey is that murderous Lady Kee'ra!Judge:\nW-Well, if it would assuage your anger... ...then by all means, please testify!Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey is Lady Kee'ra --Tahrust:\nAcolyte Fey channeled Lady Kee'ra's spirit.\nShe is a spirit medium who knows Lady Kee'ra's true name, so she could have done it.\nSo, it was the real Lady Kee'ra who returned to root out the rebels among us.\nShe attacked and killed me with a strength far beyond any mortal woman.Phoenix:\nB-But...Nahyuta:\nDo you understand now? Murder by spirit channeling explains everything. This is the only way the accused could have defeated one rebel after another!Tahrust:\nIndeed, I am a living... or shall I say \"dead\" proof of her terrible power.Phoenix:\nAaaaaaaaaagh! (Maya's ability to channel spirits... It's come back to haunt her!)Nahyuta:\nNow, is it not time to let it go, and move on, defense?Phoenix:\nNo, never! I'll never give up! (Now what? Think, think...! How can I prove that Maya couldn't have channeled Lady Kee'ra?!)Cross-ExaminationCross-Examination-- Maya Fey is Lady Kee'ra --Tahrust:\nAcolyte Fey channeled Lady Kee'ra's spirit.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMy client channeled Lady Kee'ra? Isn't that a little far-fetched?\nTahrust:\nFar-fetched, you say? Why, the very fact that I am here proves she has the power to channel spirits.\nPhoenix:\nArgh... B-But you've no proof she actually channeled Lady Kee'ra.\nTahrust:\nOh, but I do.Tahrust:\nShe is a spirit medium who knows Lady Kee'ra's true name, so she could have done it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhile it's true she may be capable of channeling Lady Kee'ra... ...I doubt there's any proof she actually did.\nTahrust:\nWe are talking about the infamous \"rebel hunter\" here. That modern-day Lady Kee'ra has captured many a rebel all by herself. And among them have been more than a few great warriors.  Who but the real Lady Kee'ra could have accomplished such a feat?\nJudge:\n...Hmm, it would be difficult for a mere mortal. That leaves the real Lady Kee'ra of legend as the only likely answer.\nTahrust:\nIndeed! Is this not proof enough that the real Lady Kee'ra of legend had been channeled?\nPhoenix:\n(The real Lady Kee'ra of legend. That's an oxymoron if I ever heard one. Then again, the people of Khura'in believe legends to be true.)Present Tome of Secrets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The Tome of Secrets is only given to the priestess who performs the Purification Rite.\"Tahrust:\nSo, it was the real Lady Kee'ra who returned to root out the rebels among us.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nLady Kee'ra is an actual person? Do you really believe there ever was a woman that powerful? One capable of battling rebels much bigger and stronger than herself?\nTahrust:\nThere is no way to prove that. But to doubt the existence of Lady Kee'ra is to doubt Khura'inism itself. It is not for us to question. We must simply believe.\nGallery:\n\nYeah! How dare you doubt our legends?!You'll regret saying that, you pohlkunan! Lady Kee'ra's gonna strike you down!\n\nPhoenix:\nUlp! (I won't get anywhere until I can refute their claims with some evidence!)Tahrust:\nShe attacked and killed me with a strength far beyond any mortal woman.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA strength far beyond any mortal woman? And just how strong would that be?\nTahrust:\nYou need but look at the wound she inflicted upon my body. ...Though I had hoped to never have to think about that again.\nPhoenix:\nYour wound...? (It was pretty deep, and there was a tremendous amount of blood.)\nTahrust:\nAnd while Acolyte Zeh'lot was rather small in stature, he was strong. Nevertheless, he was no match for the sheer strength of Lady Kee'ra.Phoenix:\n(Maya's spirit channeling is proof that she's Lady Kee'ra? This is not good! I'll have to prove she didn't channel the original Lady Kee'ra!)"

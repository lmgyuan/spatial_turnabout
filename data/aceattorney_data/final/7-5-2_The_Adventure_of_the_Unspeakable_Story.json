    "previousContext": "Episode V\nThe Adventure of the Unspeakable Story\nAnime cutscene\n'It's coming!' Sholmes' cry pierced through the thick wall of fog around us. Wisps of vapour flowed over the pistol as I cocked it, and I waited breathlessly in the stillness. The silence lasted for what seemed an eternity until, at last, it appeared. From the shadows of the cloud, an enormous beast sprang out upon us. A hound it was, but not such a hound as any mortal has ever seen. Its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, the whole of its ox-sized body was outlined in white-hot flames. Its rumbling pant and hideous howl... So terrified was I that I began to tremble with fear. 'Look well, Wilson!' Sholmes declared, gazing upon the mystical beast. 'For this! This is the diabolical Hound of the Baskervilles!'\nOur first two months in London passed by in a flash. In that disconcerting courtroom experience we were first thrown into on the day we arrived in the country... ...and in Soseki-san's terrible ordeal that had followed closely behind, we had emerged victorious. However... ...there then came an abrupt end to our opportunities to appear in court. Which was hardly surprising, of course... ...since I was nothing more than an amateur, an unknown student of law from a faraway land. So life in our little office was very quiet. That is... ...until it was shattered one day, by that fateful telegram...\n15th April, 9:13 a.m.\nNaruhodo's Legal Consultancy\n*Knock knock knock*\nThat morning... ...I was woken by the unreserved knocking on the door by the telegram boy. But after he'd gone... ...Susato-san's behaviour became very obviously strange.\nRyunosuke:\nUm...Susato-san?\nSusato:\nYes! Is it time to leave for court already? Let me see... What case is it today?\nRyunosuke:\nI...don't think I'm scheduled to defend anyone at the moment, am I?\nSusato:\nOh! No, of course not. How silly of me.\nRyunosuke:\nBut I think Iris said she would make us breakfast this morning. So shall we go down to Mr Sholmes's suite?\nSusato:\nYes! Iris makes the most delicious breakfast food.\nRyunosuke:\nShe does, doesn't she?\nSusato:\nAnd once our bellies are full, we can leave for court in fighting fit form! Let me see... What case is it today?\nRyunosuke:\n(Here we go again...)\n15th April\nSholmes's Suite\nIris:\nMorning, Runo! Morning, Susie!\nSusato:\nGood morning, Iris!\nRyunosuke:\nUm...Iris...\nIris:\nWhat is it, Runo?\nRyunosuke:\nWhat is that terrible noise? It sounds like a cat being strangled.\nIris:\nAh, yes... You noticed that, did you? Hurley isn't in the best form this morning, it seems.\nSholmes:\nHello...\nSusato:\nHello...Mr Sholmes.\nRyunosuke:\nG-Good morning.\nSholmes:\n......... A good morning to die perhaps...\nRyunosuke:\n...Has something happened, Mr Sholmes? You look miserable, and...the way you were playing the violin before...\nSholmes:\nHmph. My analytical mind is dead. Music is dead. The world...is dead. Damn this blanched existence! ...That's all it is, my dear fellow. Nothing of consequence.\nSusato:\nI'm afraid I don't understand.\nSholmes:\nWell, Iris? Isn't it time we ate? Some dry toast and insipid coffee for me...if it's not too much trouble.\n???:\nMiaow...\nRyunosuke:\nOh look, it's Wagahai.\nSusato:\nGood morning, boy.\nWagahai:\nMiaow.\nRyunosuke:\n......... (That must be some sort of tiny door for cats to use. But how did it get there?)\nIris:\nWell then, everyone, time for breakfast!\nSusato:\nOh, wonderful! Let me help you, Iris.\nSholmes:\nUgh...it would indeed be a fine day to die...\nRyunosuke:\n(Ah, I knew something looked different... Something's missing from Mr Sholmes's desk.)\nAfter clearing all Converse options with Herlock Sholmes and Iris Wilson:\nMIIIAAOWWW!\nSusato:\nOh! What was that?\nRyunosuke:\nWagahai?\n*Clatter clatter* *Screeeeeech...*\nSusato:\n.........\nSholmes:\nWhat was that?\nIris:\nOh no! Wagahai's tangled up in your violin!\nSusato:\nI think he thinks it's a toy!\nRyunosuke:\nNo! (What's he doing to it?!)\nSusato:\nOh dear... Mr Sholmes's precious violin...\nSholes:\n...Why should I care?\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nSholmes:\nI shouldn't be surprised... ...if the cat is a more accomplished musician than I now.\nSusato:\n...Mr Sholmes really is in poor spirits, isn't he?\nIris:\nWell anyway, I'll put it back where it lives, shall I, Hurley?\nRyunosuke:\nOut of the cat's reach, if possible. (Maybe we should assess the damage...)\nAfter examining \"violin\" and clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson:\nSholmes:\nCome, Mr Naruhodo! Dilly-dallying will get you nowhere!\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nSholmes:\nCrunching your toast with that vacant aspect... Fressing your coffee so obtusely... Are you not a little embarrassed by your own conduct, considering the urgency with which we are faced?\nSusato:\nWe must visit Mr Windibank's brokery at once! That's right, isn't it, Mr Sholmes?\nSholmes:\nPrecisely, Miss Susato. Without a moment's delay!\nRyunosuke:\nBut, but I haven't finished my bacon and eggs...\nSholmes:\nMy dear fellow! Surely you do not still intend... ...to crunch your bacon with an increasingly vacant aspect? To fress your egg ever more obtusely?\nRyunosuke:\nAlright, alright, say no more! Let's go then.\nIris:\nDon't worry, Runo, I'd be happy to heat it up for you again later.\nRyunosuke:\nOh, thank you, Iris. (As it happens, I am rather curious to see what a British pawnbroker's looks like.)\nNaruhodo's Legal Consultancy\nBaker Street\n15th April\nWindibank's Pawnbrokery\nRyunosuke:\nSo this...is a British pawnbrokery...\nSusato:\nOh my! There are all sorts of tools and contraptions in here that I've never laid eyes on before!\nRyunosuke:\n(Ah, Susato-san...and that spark of wonder in your eyes. You can't wait to scour the shelves, can you?) I get the impression you enjoy places like this?\nSusato:\nOh yes! I don't know why, but seeing such a lot of things I don't understand is a real thrill for me!\nSholmes:\nMy dear fellows...let us not forget why we are here.\nSusato:\nOh! Mr Sholmes!\nSholmes:\nWe are calling on matters of business, not pleasure.\nRyunosuke:\n(And clearly Mr Sholmes means business, too, judging from the spark of fury in HIS eyes.)\nWindibank:\nAh, Mr Sholmes, sir! Welcome back!\nSholmes:\n...Did you hear that brazen welcome?\nRyunosuke:\nWell, yes. We are potential customers, after all.\nSholmes:\nWe are disgruntled customers, Mr Naruhodo. And it's time to inform Mr Windibank of our ire. Come! The fight is afoot!\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nWindibank:\nNow then, Mr Sholmes, allow me to return your precious violin.\nSholmes:\nAh, the very thing! Thank you, Mr Windibank.\nWindibank:\nPerhaps this might mark the end of the peculiar items you try to pop, hm? Because if anything were to happen to one of them... ...this would be the only answer!\nRyunosuke:\nUm, I really think you ought to stop waving that gun around. Someone could get hurt.\nWindibank:\nFear not!\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nWindibank:\nI've only loaded a single bullet, so no one but myself could possibly be harmed!\nRyunosuke:\n(That's...not really what I meant.)\nSholmes:\nGood day to you then, Mr Windibank.\nWindibank:\nIt's been a pleasure as always, Mr Sholmes!\nSusato:\nSo, Mr Naruhodo! Now we can explore at last!\nAfter examining brown machine on left, shelves, brown machine on right, machine in foreground, and calendar:\n???:\nWot?! Only tuppence for it? That ain't fair, and you know it!\n???:\nThat article is barely worth a penny, miss. I cannot offer more.\nRyunosuke:\n(Sounds like there's an argument brewing over by the counter.)\n???:\nCome on, that can't be right! 'Ave you even 'ad a proper butcher's at it?\n???:\nI've seen all I need to see, young girl!\nRyunosuke:\nWait, don't we know...? (I'm sure I recognise her.)\nSusato:\nOh! Yes! It's the young lady...from Mr McGilded's trial two months ago!\nMcGilded:\nHer name is Gina Lestrade, My Lord. She's a chancer. Earns her crust among large crowds, relievin' people of their purses. What's commonly called a pickpocket.\nGina:\n......... Gordon Bennett! You lot!\nSusato:\nHello, Miss Lestrade. I hope you've been well.\nGina:\nEh?! Wot, you remember me then, do ya?\nRyunosuke:\nWell, I remember being completely surrounded by smoke, that's for sure.\nGina:\nSo...wot are you doin' in 'ere? Down and out, like the rest of us? Nuffin' to eat? Come to pop that black weasel - sorry, 'coat' - 'ave ya?\nRyunosuke:\n(...What is it about this black uniform that makes everyone comment on it?)\nSholmes:\nAh, good day. Unless I'm much mistaken... ...you would be the young pickpocket who stole our experimental smoke grenade launcher.\nGina:\nAgh! Mr Sholmes!\nSholmes:\nSo...you have something of value to pawn, do you? Allow me to see the article, and I shall negotiate with Mr Windibank on your behalf.\nGina:\nPull the other one! I don't need no 'elp from some stuck-up dee! Get outta my business! Go on, or I'll make trouble for ya!\nSholmes:\nAs you wish, Miss Lestrade. I will happily remove myself from your presence.\nRyunosuke:\n(He's really done it. He's gone.)\nWindibank:\nI'm sorry, but as I said, there really is no room for negotiation here.\nRyunosuke:\n(What is that thing he has in his hand? Some kind of metal disk?)\nGina:\nAnd you! Go on! Leave me alone!\nSusato:\nOh, Miss Lestrade, just pretend we aren't here. We shan't be offended in the slightest.\nGina:\n.........\nSusato:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n(Susato-san can really stand her ground when she wants to.)\nGina:\nWotever...\nAfter clearing \"Gina Lestrade\" and \"New article to pawn\" Converse options with Pop Windibank:\n???:\nOut of my way, please!\nRyunosuke:\n(Who's this picture-postcard English gentleman?)\n???:\nGood day to you, ladies. Gentlemen.\nGina:\nWot's your problem, eh?\n???:\nThere is no problem, as long as you remove yourself. I've a matter to discuss with the proprietor.\nGina:\n...!\n???:\nAnd if you intend to make a problem of it, I shall see you outside, little girl, for the hiding you deserve.\nGina:\nLook, ain't it obvious? I ain't done talkin' wiv 'im yet. If you think yer such a gent, you should know 'ow to wait in line.\n???:\n......... Well, you are an impudent little brat, aren't you? ...As well as a pickpocket.\nGina:\nEh? Who, who are you? 'Ow d'you know who I am?\n???:\nThe question is, how do YOU not know who I am? You haven't the courtesy even to remember the faces of your victims, it seems.\nGina:\n...! Wot?! You mean I...? From you...?\n???:\nBroker!\nWindibank:\nUm, yes, sir?\n???:\nI believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemd an article from you, no?\nWindibank:\nYes, yes, erm...\n???:\nThe article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once.\nSusato:\nOh my!\nGina:\nNow that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull?\n???:\nGive me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too.\nGina:\nNo! You, you can't 'ave it! You just can't! It's me old man's! Or it was! ...Now it's mine!\nSusato:\nGoodness, Mr Naruhodo... ...this is a very awkward situation.\nRyunosuke:\nYes... I think perhaps we should hear both sides of the story in a little more detail.\nAfter clearing all Converse options with Gina Lestrade and \"Eggert Benedict\":\nWindibank:\nSo, let that be an end to the matter. And thank you for your custom, Mr Eggert Benedict, sir.\nBenedict:\nWith such reasonable rates of interest...I may even decide to come back.\nGina:\n......... Tsk! This is why I 'ate grown-ups! Just cos I'm a diver, everyone thinks that makes me a liar.\nBenedict:\nAnd the contents of the coat pockets, if you please, broker.\nWindibank:\nBut of course, sir. Here is the disk for you.\nBenedict:\n......... Just this one?\nWindibank:\nPardon, sir?\nBenedict:\nI was expecting another. Er, that is...I deposited another.\nRyunosuke:\n(Another disk?)\nWindibank:\nOh, um... Oh dear. I regret to inform you, sir, that what was deposited with me was merely the overcoat. The disk happened to be in one of the pockets, but I was completely unaware of it until now.\nBenedict:\nSo, gutterling... You're hiding more of what's rightfully mine, are you?\nGina:\nSays who, eh? I don't know nuffin' about it!\nBenedict:\n......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style.\nGina:\nWait a minute! That disk... ...is mine!\nBenedict:\nArgh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal!\nSusato:\nOh my! Yes! There's blood on the disk!\nRyunosuke:\n(It's because of all those sharp little bumps! The man must have scratched his finger on them.)\nGina:\nI found it first, alright! I mean! It belonged to me old man! So yer not 'avin' it! ...Oi, you! You take it!\nRyunosuke:\nMe?\nGina:\nIf I 'ang onto it, they'll 'ave it off me again. So you keep 'old of it.\nRyunosuke:\nMiss Lestrade, I... (Why is this disk so important to her?)\nThe music box disc has been entered into the Court Record.\nBenedict:\nYou there! In the black livery! Hand that disk to me at once, please.\nGina:\nNo! Don't! He's lyin'! Grown-ups are all liars!\nRyunosuke:\n(Ugh... What do I do now? How am I going to resolve this?)\nRyunosuke:\nErm...Mr Sholmes... ...what are you examining with such keen interest there? As you enjoy a bar of caramel, I see.\nSholmes:\n......... So... ...you've found me at last...Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nSholmes:\nAfter that young pickpocket sent me on my way, I was forced to lurk in the shadows. Cruelly ostracised, as the rest of you partook in the jovial atmosphere of fellowship. I had nothing to occupy my mind, but was too ashamed to let society see what my downfall had done to me. So feigning mock interest, I pretended to examine the tedious trinkets in this desolate place. ...Whilst, as you shrewdly observed, gnawing on the only friend I have left: this seven per cent solution of caramel. Pray, do you claim to understand the depths of my despair, Mr Naruhodo? But how could you?! I was so lonely... So desperately lonely...\nRyunosuke:\nThen...why on earth didn't you rejoin the conversation? Things have gone from bad to worse here, you know!\nSholmes:\nYes...I overheard much of your conversation. Or rather...in my craving for human contact, my ears devoured every word that was uttered!\nRyunosuke:\n...You really were sad, weren't you?\nSusato:\nPoor Mr Sholmes. I feel simply awful for you.\nSholmes:\nIt would seem... ...that my inferences are correct.\nSusato:\nOh! ...Surely you're not about to tell us... ...that you've solved the entire case once again?!\nSholmes:\nMy dear madam, sometimes I wonder... Were my genius for deduction to be commoditised... ...how much could I pawn it for?\nRyunosuke:\n(It seems Mr Sholmes has had another of his flashes of inspiration. But who knows if it will help to resolve the situation between Miss Lestrade and the mysterious gentleman? What's the right thing to do here...?)\nSholmes:\nWell, Miss Lestrade...it would appear you find yourself in something of a predicament.\nGina:\nTsk! Where the blue blazes 'ave you been, eh?\nSholmes:\nPardon?\nGina:\nWhen a lady's in trouble, a true gent's s'posed to be there to 'elp. Straight away! Not an 'our later!\nRyunosuke:\n(...Harsh.)\nBenedict:\nAnd who, pray tell, are you?\nSholmes:\n......... Mr Eggert Benedict... ...you have, in my eyes, a veritably encyclopaedic array of curiosities about your person. Nevertheless, there are two immovable conclusions I have drawn.\nBenedict:\nI beg your pardon?\nSholmes:\nThe first is this: The true reason for your visit to this pawnbrokery today is something you have not yet revealed.\nBenedict:\n...!\nSholmes:\nAnd the second is this: A considerable crime is in contemplation. One you will orchestrate, with intent to steal a vast sum of money. Well, Mr Benedict? What say you to my deductions?\nBenedict:\nHow...!\nRyunosuke:\n(He's turned as white as a hard-boiled egg!)\nSusato:\nIt would seem that once again...Mr Sholmes has made a flawless deduction!\nBenedict:\nJust who do you think you are, sir?\nSholmes:\nAh yes, as I hoped... That is precisely the pained expression I was looking for. So...shall we begin? The time has come for yet another Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!\nThe Great DeductionThe game is afoot!\nTopic 1\nMystery Man's Aim\nSholmes:\nFirst of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer! The piece of paper in your hand is a 'staff wanted' advertisement from this very shop. Yet even the most unobservant would soon realise that a man of your appearance has no need of such employ. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions.\nBenedict:\n...!\nSholmes:\nThe cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction.\nBenedict:\nWhat utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years!\nSholmes:\nThe contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule. The end of any walking cane would be terminated with a metal ferrule to protect the wooden tip. And yet detailed analysis shows the wooden tip of this stick to be utterly bare. Therefore...there is only one conclusion: The rod that you hold in your hand, which appears to be a walking cane... ...is in fact no cane at all!\nBenedict:\n...!\nSholmes:\nYou recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong?\nBenedict:\nI... Well, I...\nSholmes:\nAnd in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear?\nBenedict:\n.........\nSholmes:\nYes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see. From the moment I saw it, my suspicions were aroused. 'What walking cane demands such a stout handle?' mused I.\nBenedict:\n.........\nSholmes:\nBut of course, as I said, this is no walking cane. No, that rod... ...is the broken handle of a shovel!\nBenedict:\nWha...? Are you insane?!\nSholmes:\nAnd now, having determined this undeniable truth, the conclusion is clear. Your true motive for coming here... ...was to take employment at this establishment in order to excavate the ground beneath the premises! What a calculated crime you have conceived, sir. A wickedly calculated crime.\nTopic 1\nMystery Man's Aim\nConclusion\nTo tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery\nTopic 2\nGreat Crime\nSholmes:\nNow, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning.\nBenedict:\nThis is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, intend to excavate the ground beneath this pawnbrokery with a broken shovel? What on earth do you propose I could expect to find there? Some long-forgotten treasure, I suppose? Save for such a fanciful theory, what possible reason could I have to do as you say?\nSholmes:\nOh, but there is ample reason... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped.\nBenedict:\nWhat?\nSholmes:\nLet us consider what would motivate a man to infiltrate a shop such as this and covertly dig beneath its floor... The answer is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn. This letter gives notice of public works to be carried out in the local area. And according to the enclosed plan of the upcoming sewerage works... ...beneath this shop runs a sewer that adjoins another, one that runs under the bank on the opposite side of the road.\nBenedict:\nThis madness has entered the sewers now, has it?!\nSholmes:\nBy excavating the ground beneath our feet, you would gain access to the waterway... ...that flows in very close proximity to the great vault of the financial institution opposite.\nBenedict:\nWhat are you...?\nSholmes:\nIn summary, sir... ...you devised a master plan to pull off an elaborate bank robbery by dint of the underground tunnels!\nBenedict:\nM... Master plan?!\nSholmes:\nWhich brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... With what plunder did the thief hope to make off from the underground vault of the bank?\nBenedict:\nAre you quite serious?\nSholmes:\nHaving consulted with Scotland Yard some days ago, I happen to know the answer. But naturally, the answer is no secret to you, is it, Mr Benedict?\nBenedict:\nI have no idea what you're talking about!\nSholmes:\nAllow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know.\nBenedict:\nA postcard of the Great Exhibition? I'm afraid you've quite lost me.\nSholmes:\nCurrently in the final stages of preparation, the Great Exhibition will soon be underway. And the government has provided extra funds to complete its centrepiece, the Crystal Tower. Funds that currently sit in the vault of the bank on the other side of this road!\nBenedict:\nPardon?\nSholmes:\nYes, the considerable crime you have been contemplating... ...is the theft of that which sits in the vault of that bank, the special reserve funds for the Great Exhibition! ...Of course, that is top-secret police information. So keep it under your hat, please.\nTopic 2\nGreat Crime\nConclusion\nTo steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds\nSholmes:\nThus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this pawnbroking puzzle!\nRyunosuke:\nUm...Mr Sholmes...\nSholmes:\nWell, Mr Naruhodo? An impressively upbeat deduction for a detective racked with loneliness, would you not agree?\nRyunosuke:\nWas it true what you said about the bank over the road and what it has in its vault?\nSholmes:\nIndeed. Though few know of its existence. It is one of the government's most closely guarded secrets. Gregson told me, in the strictest confidence.\nSusato:\nBut you just announced it to everyone here. Rather loudly, in fact.\nSholmes:\n...Ah.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd if it's such a big secret... ...how would Mr Benedict have come to find out about it?\nSholmes:\nThere can be but one explanation for that. Clearly it is because the man is a criminal!\nSusato:\nBut what if he didn't know anything about the money in the vault? If he is a criminal, as you said... ...then buying a brand new shovel is sure to be the first thing he does now that you've revealed the secret.\nSholmes:\n...Oh.\nRyunosuke:\nOr if he doesn't... ...maybe Mr Windibank will. He already has plenty of shovels here, after all.\nWindibank:\nOh my life! I assure you I'm not so unscrupulous!\nSholmes:\nHm, well... Hopefully this has taught you a valuable lesson. Sensitive information must be handled with the utmost of care. One can never be sure that someone privy to secrets won't disclose them. And once the word is out, it's out.\nRyunosuke:\n...Perhaps I'll think twice before confiding in you next time, Mr Sholmes.\nSholmes:\nAn excellent idea, Mr Naruhodo. An excellent idea. Ah ha ha ha ha hah!\nSusato:\nWell then, Mr Naruhodo, you know what to do, I'm sure.\nRyunosuke:\nYes. Let's listen to that great deduction again, and see if we can massage it into shape!\nSholmes:\nVery well, then. Let us start once more from the beginning... ...of Herlock Sholmes's magnificent 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'!\nCourse CorrectionHold it, Mr Sholmes!\nTopic 1\nMystery Man's Aim\nConclusion\nTo tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery\nSholmes:\nFirst of all, we must ask ourselves on what business you ventured to this pawnbrokery today. You claim to have followed this pickpocket here, having had the redemption ticket stolen from you on the street. But that...is most certainly a lie. The real truth is something quite different... ...as revealed by that which you hold in your hand! Yes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer!\nRyunosuke:\nSo, by Mr Sholmes's reasoning... ...Mr Benedict came here in order to apply for a job so he could dig down through the floor.\nSusato:\nYes. In an attempt to tunnel into the sewers to gain access to the money in the vault of the bank across the road. But...he wouldn't get very far with a broken shovel, would he?\nRyunosuke:\nNo. I think it's fair to say his motives lie elsewhere. The question is, where? What did bring Mr Benedict here at this particular point in time?\nYes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the staff recruitment flyer!\nSusato:\nI still don't quite understand why this gentleman came to Mr Windibank's today.\nRyunosuke:\nHe might look like a smartly dressed man about town, but perhaps he's destitute really. I really think that's the only explanation!\nSusato:\nWe must stop thinking along those lines, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\nYes...I suppose you're right. Well in that case... ...perhaps there's something in this pawn shop that the man was looking for?\nSusato:\nLet's look closely and see if there's anything about his person that gives us a clue.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, what brought you to this shop in the first place is the info about Miss Lestrade!\nSholmes:\nQuite so, my dear fellow! It would appear that the writing and sketch on the reverse of the flyer... ...pertain to the pickpocket, Miss Lestrade, and to Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery here.\nBenedict:\nAh!\nRyunosuke:\nYou originally told us... ...that you had merely given chase after Miss Lestrade stole the redemption ticket from you.\nSholmes:\nBut that, sir, is a thinly veiled lie.\nRyunosuke:\nIt is the information on the back of the flyer that led you here today. By which I mean... Here, to Windibank's Pawnbrokery, and today, the redemption deadline of that overcoat.\nSholmes:\nSo you waited outside for the young girl matching the description you have written down to arrive.\nBenedict:\nHmph!\nSholmes:\nAnd you have gone to some lengths to hide the reason for your pursuit of Miss Lestrade. In other words...there is some ulterior motive for your actions.\nBenedict:\n...!\nSholmes:\nThe cane, which you unwittingly clutch to your person, exhibits an incontrovertible contradiction.\nBenedict:\nWhat utter rot! I've, I've had this cane for years!\nSholmes:\nThe contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule.\nRyunosuke:\nUm...what's a ferrule?\nSusato:\nIt's the metal cap commonly found on the end of a cane, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\nAh, the bit that makes the nice clacking sound on the pavement?\nSusato:\nYes, exactly, And Mr Sholmes is right, it appears to be missing on this cane.\nRyunosuke:\n...But it doesn't actually look broken, does it?\nSusato:\nNo, it doesn't. Though the gentleman certainly did recoil when Mr Sholmes identified the cane as suspicious.\nRyunosuke:\nIn other words... ...there's some secret about the cane that Mr Benedict would rather we don't know!\nThe contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the missing ferrule.\nRyunosuke:\nI don't know, I just can't picture it. I mean, a respectable gentleman strolling the streets of London with a shovel in his hand? (I'm sure it's just that the cane is broken and the ferrule was lost somehow.)\nSusato:\nWell, there is one thing of which we can be certain in all of this. After all, we saw it with our own eyes. At the mention of his cane, Mr Benedict visibly recoiled.\nRyunosuke:\n...! (That's very true. So there's definitely something about this cane that's not right...)\nRyunosuke:\nThe contradiction of which I speak is, of course, the initialling.\nSholmes:\nA most astute observation...wouldn't you say, Mr Eggert Benedict?\nBenedict:\n...!\nSholmes:\nWe are led to believe, sir, that your initials are 'E. B.'. Yet in a most possessive manner, you have in your grasp a cane bearing the initials 'A. G.'. An incontrovertible contradiction indeed, would you not agree?\nBenedict:\nNo! You're, you're wrong. This cane isn't-\nRyunosuke:\nYou said before that you'd had that cane for years.\nBenedict:\nGrrr...\nRyunosuke:\nSo don't try to tell us that you just borrowed it from a friend or found it in the park!\nSholmes:\nIn short... ...though you hold yourself to be a gentleman, you have withheld your true name!\nBenedict:\n...!\nSholmes:\nYou recoil, sir. ...Is something wrong?\nBenedict:\nI... Well, I...\nSholmes:\nAnd in your recoiling, you inadvertently facilitate the answer of the next conundrum to present itself. Namely, what is the truth behind this rod you bear?\nBenedict:\n.........\nSholmes:\nYes, your reaction betrays the truth. The handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see.\nRyunosuke:\nLet's consider the bare bones of what's happened here: Miss Lestrade redeemed that fine-looking overcoat. And now a mysterious man has appeared, introducing himself with a fake name... ...and claiming that the overcoat belongs to him.\nSusato:\nBut we know that he actually identified Miss Lestrade from a written description. Which suggests that everything else he's told us is untrue.\nRyunosuke:\nSo what we need to do here... ...is somehow prove that the overcoat cannot possibly belong to him!\nThe handle, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see.\nRyunosuke:\nThe man is white all over, but for his overcoat. That's almost reason enough to say it doesn't belong to him, isn't it?\nSusato:\nBut I'm sure the gentleman's wardrobe isn't exclusively white, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\nWell mine is exclusively black!\nSusato:\n...I think perhaps we should go shopping together.\nRyunosuke:\n(There's no doubt about it. That black overcoat doesn't suit Mr Benedict at all. But we need a more tangible way of proving it...)\nRyunosuke:\nThe split seam, which you evidently would like to conceal, is the key to understanding this riddle, you see.\nBenedict:\nAh!\nSholmes:\nYes, because the overcoat is rather obviously a poor fit.\nRyunosuke:\nHaving forced it over your broad shoulders, the seam is already breaking apart.\nSholmes:\nMy suspicions were aroused from the outset... ...when you so baldly lied about your name and so boldly waylaid this pickpocket.\nBenedict:\nArgh!\nSholmes:\nThis catalogue of untruths has all been for one very specific purpose: To steal the article that the young girl redeemed from Mr Windibank!\nBenedict:\nAAAAAARGH!!!\nSholmes:\nBut what really irks me is this: The considerable crime I initially imagined has been considerably curtailed.\nTopic 1\nMystery Man's Aim\nConclusion\nTo tunnel underneath the pawnbrokery\nTo abscond with a redeemed item\nSolved\nTopic 2\nGreat Crime\nConclusion\nTo steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds\nSholmes:\nNow, Mr Benedict, let us continue... For we must expose the details of this elaborate crime you have in the planning.\nBenedict:\nThis is...utterly absurd! You suggest that I, a gentleman, designed a wheeze to filch some tawdry article of pawnage? Have you forgotten that I redeemed the article in the proper manner, using the watchword? Had I not been the one to deposit it in the first place... ...how could I possibly have known the relevant details? N'est-ce pas?\nSholmes:\nOh, but the watchword can be discovered... ...as you are only too well aware, Mr Benedict. Ah, and your furtive glance is more telling than I could have hoped.\nBenedict:\nWhat?\nSholmes:\nLet us consider how one might come to learn a secret watchword relating to the pawned property of another... The method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn.\nSusato:\nThe direction of the deduction must change rather dramatically now, I think.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, no more talk of tunnelling into the sewers. (Which is a pity, because it all sounded rather exciting.) Anyway... ...you can't deny that this mysterious gentleman did know the watchword.\nSusato:\nYes. 'Professor'... If you didn't know that word, Mr Windibank would never allow you to redeem the article.\nRyunosuke:\nOr, looking at it another way... ...if you did know that word, Mr Windibank would allow you to redeem the article whether it was yours or not. (So the question is, could this gentleman have found the watchword out somehow?)\nThe method is revealed by the council notice on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn.\nRyunosuke:\nThere's no question that Mr Benedict used some wheeze or other to find out the watchword. (Let's think. He only appeared in the shop after Miss Lestrade had redeemed the overcoat...)\nSusato:\nHe certainly couldn't have overheard Miss Lestrade saying the watchword. So he can only have discovered it from something on this countertop.\nRyunosuke:\n(It sounds like I need to have another look and examine things more closely this time.)\nRyunosuke:\nThe method is revealed by the notelet on the counter to which your eyes were inadvertently drawn.\nSholmes:\nYes, the broker here follows the same procedure whenever a customer comes to redeem an article. He asks the customer for the watchword, and notes down the response uttered on a notelet he has to hand. Then he consults his ledger, and confirms whether or not the watchword matches that of the article in question.\nBenedict:\nI would expect nothing less of a diligent pawnbroker.\nRyunosuke:\nBut his diligence clearly has its disadvantages.\nBenedict:\nWhat are you talking about?\nSholmes:\nIt is increasingly apparent that you were present in this shop before your accusation against Miss Lestrade.\nRyunosuke:\nIn all likelihood, you followed her inside, and then observed her talking to Mr Windibank.\nSholmes:\nWhen the diligent broker made a note of the watchword, as is his common practice...\nRyunosuke:\n...You observed him writing the word 'Professor' on the notelet beside the ledger.\nBenedict:\n...!\nSholmes:\nAnd that, sir... ...was the master plan you devised to steal the pawned article from the young Miss Lestrade!\nBenedict:\nM... Master plan?!\nSholmes:\nWhich brings us at last to the final chapter of this lurid scheme... Why would you go to such lengths to redeem that particular article from this pawnbroker?\nBenedict:\nAre you quite serious?\nSholmes:\nFor an ill-fitting overcoat hardly seems to justify the effort, much less a worthless music box disk. But naturally, you had very good reason to make them yours, didn't you, Mr Benedict?\nBenedict:\nI have no idea what you're talking about!\nSholmes:\nAllow me to present a rather interesting piece of evidence... You see, this picture postcard tells us all we need to know.\nRyunosuke:\nThe articles we're talking about are the overcoat and the music box disk that was in one of the pockets.\nSusato:\nWhich according to Mr Windibank, isn't even worth a penny.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd yet this man went to such lengths to steal them... Why?\nSusato:\nI wonder if perhaps... ...we already have the evidence we need to explain it, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\n(Could we? Really? I'd better have a thorough look through all the evidence we've collected so far.)\nRyunosuke:\nYou see, this music box disk tells us all we need to know.\nBenedict:\nWhat's that...on the back...?\nSholmes:\nIt reads, 'For McGilded'...\nBenedict:\nAgh!\nSholmes:\nAh, Mr Magnus McGilded... The unfortunate philanthropist who perished in curious circumstances at the Old Bailey two months ago. A prominent man in London...though his loan-mongering demonstrated a distinct lack of scruples. So...you're an associate of his, are you? Or perhaps a subordinate?\nBenedict:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nMr McGilded was a man of unusually small stature. In fact... ...he was precisely the right size for that overcoat that you've squeezed yourself into.\nBenedict:\nUgh!\nSholmes:\nYour true identity remains shrouded in mystery... Mr Eggert Benedict. But the final conclusion here is crystal clear. The reason you came to this pawnbrokery today...\n...was to retrieve an article left behind by the late Magnus McGilded!\nBenedict:\nTsk... AAAAAAAAARGH!!!\nTopic 2\nGreat Crime\nConclusion\nTo steal the Great Exhibition's reserve funds\nTo acquire an item deposited by Mr McGilded\nSolved\n\n\nDeduction CompleteElementary!\nSholmes:\nWell well, Mr Magnus McGilded... Not a name I expected to hear in these circumstances.\nBenedict:\n.........\nSusato:\nMr Sholmes, I'm afraid there's something very troubling on my mind.\nSholmes:\nPray tell, Miss Susato.\nSusato:\nWell, according to what Mr Windibank told us earlier... ...today was the final day on which the coat could have been redeemed, was it not?\nWindibank:\nYes, ma'am, that is correct. Today would be precisely two months since it was first deposited.\nRyunosuke:\nWell, today is 15th April, so...two months ago today...\nWindibank:\n...Would have been 15th February, sir, that's right. It's all carefully recorded in my ledger. Deposited at 10:30 p.m., I see.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! But, but that suggests...\nSusato:\nYes. 15th February...\nRyunosuke:\n...Is precisely the day on which the omnibus murder took place!\nSusato:\nAnd half past ten in the evening... ...is precisely the time at which the terrible events were unfolding!\nSholmes:\nSuggestive is not the word. It would seem the matter is entirely beyond coincidence.\nBenedict:\n......... You are of course at liberty to make whatever outlandish deductions you choose. However... ...I must insist you hand over the music box disk now.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nBenedict:\nIt would be a terrible shame to return to your native land in a box.\nRyunosuke:\nAgh... (What do I do?!)\nRyunosuke:\nMr Windibank!\nWindibank:\nThis is my shop! I can't allow any harm to come to my customers! If that were to happen... ...I should have to take my own life!\nRyunosuke:\nMr Windibank, no!\n???:\nAlright, that's enough!\nRyunosuke:\nInspector Gregson!\nBenedict:\nInspector...?\nGregson:\nThat's right, sunshine. The alarm was raised on one of our dedicated emergency lines. So we got here as fast as we could. Now, what's this all about, eh?\nWindibank:\nOh, praise be! You're here at last! I was moments away from forfeiting my own life in my very own establishment!\nBenedict:\n......... It would seem you have the upper hand.\nGregson:\nRight, you lot have got some explainin' to do! I don't appreciate bein' bothered with some petty argy-bargy!\nSusato:\nPetty?! Mr Windibank very nearly met with his end!\nGregson:\nYeah, with his own gun, as far as I can tell.\nWindibank:\nOh dear...\nGregson:\nAnd the whole of Britain could meet with its end if I don't get to the bottom of the case I'm s'posed to be workin' on!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! What on earth is the case, Inspector?\nSholmes:\nSpare no detail, Gregson!\nGregson:\n...I, I might have said a little too much. No matter. It's nothin' to do with you lot. Anyway, sir, you're gonna have to come with me down to the station.\nBenedict:\n......... But of course, Inspector...\nGregson:\nAah!\nHe's getting away!\nGet after him, lads! Whistle the beat officer, too!Sir!\nGregson:\n...There's been a spate of thefts at pawn shops round here recently. So we've fitted emergency buttons underneath the counters for brokers to let us know when there's trouble.\nWindibank:\nOh, Inspector...I was very worried there for a while. Very worried indeed.\nGregson:\nNow then, Mr Permanently-in-Mournin'...\nRyunosuke:\nOh! ...Yes?\nGregson:\nI'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much! So hand it over!\nRyunosuke:\nOh, yes, of course...\nGina:\nNo, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!\nGregson:\nI'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.\nRyunosuke:\nAs evidence...?\nSholmes:\nIf the police demand something as evidence, my dear fellow, we have no choice but to capitulate. It's all yours, Inspector.\nGina:\nGrrr...\nRyunosuke:\nAnd so, we handed Mr McGilded's disk over to Inspector Gregson... ...and were summarily turfed out of the shop and onto the street.\nTo be continued...\nNaruhodo's Legal Consultancy (before initiating Logic and Reasoning Spectacular)\n15th April\nBaker Street\nGina:\nSee? That's why I 'ate grown-ups. All they do is feed you a pack o' lies and take stuff away from ya!\nSholmes:\nOh really, Miss Lestrade? ...Tell me, is that overcoat keeping you warm?\nGina:\nWot?\nSusato:\nOh my! Surely, you were given that!\nGina:\nYeah, the dee let me keep it. After I looked daggers at 'im for long enough. 'E went through the pockets and then said, 'Go on, then, 'ave it' before tellin' me to scarper. Always pays off, givin' people a look like you 'ate 'em.\nRyunosuke:\nI can't help feeling that it's going to get you into serious trouble one day...\nGina:\nWot I really wanted was that nice, shiny disk, mind.\nSusato:\nThe music box disk?\nRyunosuke:\nBut Mr Windibank said it was practically worthless.\nGina:\nI think I'm gonna go and 'ave another bash. Give 'em a long, 'ard stare.\nSholmes:\nI think not, Miss Lestrade. We shan't enter Windibank's again today.\nGina:\nWhy not?! That's not fair!\nRyunosuke:\nIt can't be helped, I'm afraid. The police are investigating the scene now, and taking a statement from Mr Windibank.\nGina:\nBut that disk's mine! I 'ad the ticket for this coat, and it was in this coat's pocket! And there should be somefin' else an' all! That's wot that rotten cove said, ain't it?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, he did mention something about another article, didn't he?\nGina:\nWell then, that's mine, too! Wotever it is!\nRyunosuke:\n(Now she's really pushing her luck...)\nSholmes:\nMiss Lestrade, I think it's time to admit defeat. You've had your 'haul' for the day.\nGina:\nYeah! And it's all your fault, Sholmes!\nSholmes:\nSo what are your plans now? Will you dine with us this evening?\nGina:\nEh?\nSholmes:\nIris would be delighted to cook, I'm sure. And I might entertain you with a modest violin recital.\nGina:\n......... No, ta.\nSholmes:\nOh...\nGina:\nWhy would I come round your place, eh? 'Ave you lost your 'ead or somefin'?!\nSusato:\nOh dear. She's gone.\nSholmes:\nHm, having reviled on me quite unnecessarily, I might add.\nRyunosuke:\nI...can't help wondering... ...if perhaps she might turn up anyway.\nSholmes:\nInteresting...\nRyunosuke:\nOnce she's had a chance to calm down, I think there's a good chance she'll decide to come.\nSholmes:\n......... Very well, then. I'll inform Iris to set a place for our potential guest at the dinner table this evening. And one more thing... I should be glad of your company later, too.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nSholmes:\nI believe I will have a rather splendid surprise to show you.\nSusato:\nOh, how exciting! What is it?\nSholmes:\nYou shall have to wait and see, Miss Susato. ...Until later, then!\n15th April, 3:46 p.m.\nSholmes's Suite\nIris:\nAh, Susie! And Runo! Come in, come in!\nRyunosuke:\nGood afternoon, Iris.\nSusato:\nThank you so much for breakfast this morning.\nIris:\nOh, don't mention it! ...Goodness! Look at the time already!\nRyunosuke:\nBusy as always?\nIris:\nI am! I'm preparing everything for dinner this evening.\nRyunosuke:\nAlready? You're obviously cooking something special, are you?\nIris:\nOh, yes! After all, we have a special guest joining us! Guess who it is! Go on! Hee hee, you'll never guess!\nRyunosuke:\nUm... (Look at those little eyes of hers shining!)\nSusato:\nOh dear. It is awkward when you already know the answer, isn't it?\nIris:\nIt's Ginny! Isn't that exciting?!\nSusato:\nOh! Oh...what a surprise! Yes, that's wonderful news!\nRyunosuke:\n(Wow, Iris seems overjoyed at the idea!)\nIris:\nI can't wait to learn some pickpocketing tips from a real professional!\nRyunosuke:\nOh yes! That does sound like fun!\nSusato:\nI'm not sure that's entirely appropriate. Are you, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nErm... By the way, Iris, what's Mr Sholmes up to?\nIris:\nHurley? Oh, he's been like that ever since he got back.\nRyunosuke:\n...Hellooo! Mr Sholmes!\nSholmes:\nI beg that you won't speak to me.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nSholmes:\nI don't know who you are, but kindly take your leave. As you can see, I'm not here.\nRyunosuke:\n......... (I, I don't know how to respond to that.)\nIris:\nI do apologise. When he gets like this, he's completely oblivious to everything.\nRyunosuke:\nYes... I see...\nIris:\nReally, he behaves just like a child sometimes, Hurley does.\nSusato:\nMr Sholmes and Iris have something of a parent-and-child relationship, don't they?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, except that Iris is clearly the parent here... (Come to think of it... ...I wonder where her real parents are.)\nIris:\nWhat's the matter, Runo? You have ever such a funny look on your face!\nRyunosuke:\nOh...no...it's nothing.\nIris:\nI know what it is! 'Why does this girl live here with Mr Sholmes?' you're wondering. ...Am I right?\nRyunosuke:\nHow?! How did you...?\nIris:\nHeh heh, oh, Runo! I can read you like a book!\nRyunosuke:\n(Ugh... This girl is dangerous...)\nIris:\nDon't worry, you can ask me anything! I won't mind.\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nSholmes:\nAh, my dear fellows! How good to see you!\nSusato:\nEek! Mr, Mr Sholmes!\nSholmes:\nWhyever did you not make your presence known to me before?\nRyunosuke:\n...Haah.\nSholmes:\nWell, no matter now. So, how the devil are you?\nRyunosuke:\nWe've...been with you for most of the day.\nSholmes:\nGoodness, really?\nSusato:\nDo tell me, Mr Sholmes, is your violin unscathed?\nSholmes:\nHm? My violin? Whatever are you talking about, dear madam?\nSusato:\nOh! Um...\nSholmes:\nNever mind that now. I have something far more interesting to show you. Behold, my dear fellows!\nSusato:\nOh, another music box disk.\nSholmes:\nNo, not 'another' disk, Miss Susato. This is the one Gregson demanded we hand over as evidence: Mr McGilded's disk!\nSusato:\nOh my!\nRyunosuke:\nThen, then...what's it doing here?!\nSholmes:\nHeh heh heh! You know, at times, Mr Naruhodo... ...I think that though I have an undeniable turn for detection... ...I may well be even more adept at larceny!\nIris:\nOoh! That would be wonderfully exciting! I'd be your pickpocketing assistant! And Runo could be our go-to lawyer if we ever got caught!\nRyunosuke:\nRight...\nIris:\nPlus, Susie has such beautiful handwriting, she could write all our menacing crime notifications!\nSusato:\nYes! I'd be delighted!\nRyunosuke:\n(I'm just going to pretend this conversation never happened, I think.)\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nIris:\nWell, it's time I started getting things ready for dinner, I think. Ginny will be here before long.\nSholmes:\nThank you, Iris.\nSusato:\nOh, well you must let me help you, then.\nIris:\nOf course, Susie! There's plenty to do.\nSholmes:\nI think I shall investigate the condition of my faithful performing partner. Now then...where did I leave it...?\nRyunosuke:\nLet this be a lesson to you, Mr Sholmes: Never leave anything too precious with the pawnbroker.\nSholmes:\nHm, yes... You may be right.\nSusato:\nOh, that reminds me! Of something Mr Windibank said before. He said that he had a manuscript of Iris's in pawn, didn't he?\nSholmes:\nDid he?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, he definitely mentioned it. 'Mr Sholmes's latest tale of otherworldly mystery lies dormant in my storeroom,' were his words, I believe.\nIris:\nSo you heard about that, did you? I expect you were as incensed as I was!\nSusato:\nOh yes! The idea of such a wonderful story languishing in Mr Windibank's storeroom, gathering dust...\nSholmes:\nMy dear madam, I'm quite sure I told you already... ...the pawnbroker's storeroom is the safest place for it. More secure than a bank's vault!\nIris:\nAnd what about your Stradivarius, Hurley? Was that safe and secure?\nSholmes:\nWeeell... There may be the occasional mix-up.\nRyunosuke:\n(Caused by a certain impetuous someone not too far from me now...)\nIris:\nDo you have any idea how long it took me to write that Baskerville story, Hurley?\nSusato:\nOh, it sounds so exciting! 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'! I should love to read it!\nIris:\n.........\nSholmes:\n.........\nSusato:\n.........Ah!\nRyunosuke:\n......... (What's going on here? Why does it feel like an icy chill just swept through the room?)\nIris:\nSusie...what did you just say?\nSusato:\nErm...\nIris:\nYou said...'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... But...how could you know the full title?\nSusato:\nWell, that's... .........\nRyunosuke:\nThat's because Miss Susato is such a great fan of all the stories about Mr Sholmes, of course.\nIris:\nBut Runo, 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'... ...has never been published.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nIris:\nWhen I showed Hurley the manuscript, he told me that I wasn't allowed to publish it yet.\nRyunosuke:\nI don't understand...\nIris:\nThat's why he said that he'd keep it safe. Until it was the right time for the story to be made public, you see.\nRyunosuke:\nSo that's why the manuscript is at Windibank's...?\nIris:\nAnd yet, how could Susie here know its title? Well Hurley? What's going on?\nSholmes:\n......... ...Ah!\nRyunosuke:\n...? What is it, Mr Sholmes?\nSholmes:\nIt would appear our guest has arrived.\nRyunosuke:\nMiss Lestrade!\nGina:\n......... ...This was a bad idea. I knew I weren't welcome. I'm goin'!\nRyunosuke:\nNo! Wait! ...Miss Lestrade! We've all been eagerly awaiting your arrival. ...Haven't we, Iris?\nIris:\n......... Oh yes! Just wait there, Ginny. We'll have everything ready in a jiffy! Come along, Susie!\nSusato:\nRight! Of course! It's a pleasure to see you here, Miss Lestrade. Please, make yourself at home!\nSholmes:\nDon't stand in the doorway, my dear girl. Come along in! What say you to some Mendelssohn? I won't take 'no' for an answer!\nRyunosuke:\n...Meddlesome it is, then.\nGina:\n.........\nWagahai:\n...Miaow.\nRyunosuke:\nThat evening... ...Iris prepared us all a meal that was even more delicious than usual... ...Mr Sholmes's violin performance was in no way meddlesome... ...and Gina, as we came to call her, taught us all how to steal things from one another without being noticed. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves...well into the night.\n15th April, 9:34 p.m.\nNaruhodo's Legal Consultancy\nRyunosuke:\nThat was a very enjoyable evening, wasn't it?\nSusato:\nOh yes! Iris's cooking was truly divine!\nRyunosuke:\nAnd I feel as though I can still hear the enchanting strains of Mr Sholmes's violin even now.\nSusato:\nBest of all...I bet I could steal the glasses from His Lordship's face next time we're in court! ......... Naruhodo-san...could I consult with you about something, I wonder?\nRyunosuke:\nWhat's the matter, Susato-san?\nSusato:\n......... It's...about the telegram I received.\nRyunosuke:\nAh... (The one that arrived first thing this morning, I suppose.)\nSusato:\n......... I've...I've been summoned.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! Summoned? ...What do you mean?\nSusato:\nThe telegram was from the Lord Chief Justice's office. Lord Stronghart has asked to see me.\nRyunosuke:\nThe Lord Chief Justice? ...When?\nSusato:\nTomorrow morning.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! Then, then we have to start preparing at once!\nSusato:\nOh! No...that won't be necessary, Naruhodo-san. I've been summoned alone.\nRyunosuke:\nAlone? What on earth for?\nSusato:\n......... I have no idea. I suppose I shall find out tomorrow.\nRyunosuke:\n(What's all this about? Whatever it is, it's making me feel very uneasy...)\n*Knock knock*\nRyunosuke:\n(Oh, who could that be, I wonder?)\nIris:\nGood evening, friends!\nRyunosuke:\nAh, Iris. Hello again.\nGina:\n.........\nSusato:\nAnd Gina, too.\nIris:\nYes! Ginny's going to stay with us tonight. She's going to sleep in with me! ...Isn't that right, Ginny?\nGina:\nWell...yeah...\nSusato:\nHow lovely! Let me make a pot of tea.\nIris:\nYou know, I've learnt so much today!\nSusato:\nOh, what...in particular?\nIris:\nAll those things Ginny showed us! Wasn't it wonderful?\nRyunosuke:\nAh, you mean all those pickpocketing techniques? We had fun trying them out on each other, didn't we?\nIris:\nI think I've awakened a natural talent! I could earn a living from it!\nRyunosuke:\n(...You might be getting ahead of yourself a little there.) So...what brings you up to our humble quarters at this late hour?\nIris:\nWell, you see... ...I came to return this.\nRyunosuke:\nWait, what?! That's, that's mine!\nSusato:\nOh my! However did you...?\nIris:\nI told you, didn't I? I have a natural talent for it!\nRyunosuke:\n(Oh yes, I'd forgotten... ...Iris literally is a child genius.)\nIris:\nSo anyway, here...you can have it back. Not that I really understand why you wear it, though.\nRyunosuke:\nAh. Thank you.\nIris:\nAlright then, good night!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, good night.\nIris:\n......... Hm... So this is your office, is it? What do you think, Ginny?\nGina:\nI think I wouldn't fancy me chances wiv a lawyer wot lives in a place like this.\nIris:\nYes! Me too! Hahahaha!\nRyunosuke:\n(It seems as though Iris here... ...still has something she'd like to talk about.)\nSusato:\nI suppose...she probably wants to talk about the manuscript.\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes, I suppose she probably does.)\nAfter clearing all Converse options with Iris Wilson and Gina Lestrade:\nIris:\nOh my goodness! Look at the time! Come along, Ginny, we should go back downstairs.\nGina:\nYeah...alright.\nIris:\nAnd please, don't mention any of this to Hurley, will you?\nRyunosuke:\nNo...of course not. Good night then, Iris. Good night, Gina.\nSusato:\nYou must let me make breakfast for you tomorrow morning! I insist!\nIris:\nOh, yes please! I can't wait, Susie! Good night, then!\nRyunosuke:\n(Iris... It sure is easy to forget, isn't it? Sometimes she speaks just like an adult. But deep down, she's still just a child.)\nSusato:\nWell, I think it's time that I turned in for the night, too, Naruhodo-san.\nRyunosuke:\nDr John H. Wilson... Iris's father... But also... ...the name of the murdered visiting professor at Yumei University. It can't be a mere coincidence... There's something deeper going on... ........................... .................. .........\n???:\n...ster Naruhodo... ...Mr Naruhodo...\nRyunosuke:\n(That voice... That's...Mr Sholmes!) What's going on? It's the middle of the night.\nSholmes:\nIt's Miss Lestrade... She's gone.\nRyunosuke:\nGina?\nSholmes:\nShe was supposed to be sleeping in Iris's room. But her bed is empty.\nRyunosuke:\nWell...she's an independent young woman. She probably decided to go home, no?\nSholmes:\nI think not. From speaking to her before she retired... ...I received the distinct impression that she was looking forward to breakfasting with Miss Susato. No, I don't believe the girl has gone home. But I've been waiting for over an hour now.\nRyunosuke:\nOver an hour? Oh...\nSholmes:\nIf you'll indulge me, look out of the window, my dear fellow.\nRyunosuke:\n(What's this about?) ...! Wait a minute... (Why is there a light on at this time of night?)\nSholmes:\nThat's Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery.\nRyunosuke:\nMr Windibank's... (Oh no!)\nGina:\nIt's simple! If that story was really in old Windibank's storeroom... ...there's no way someone from 'alf way around the world - in other words, you - could know about it.\nGina:\nSorry, Iris, but if you ask me, 'e's sold it. Wivout tellin' you.\nRyunosuke:\n(Could Gina have gone...?)\nSholmes:\nIt seems you have some knowledge of the situation, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry? ...Oh, no! No, not really.\nSholmes:\nWell anyway, we must investigate.\n???:\nAt once!\nRyunosuke:\nMiss Susato!\n16th April, 1:14 a.m.\nBaker Street\nRyunosuke:\nThe door to Windibank's... It's open!\nSusato:\nAnd the lamp is burning.\nRyunosuke:\nIt must be Gina...mustn't it?\nSholmes:\nLet us hope it's nothing more sinister.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nSholmes:\nCome, there's not a moment to lose! Clearly something is afoot inside!\nRyunosuke:\n...There's no one here...\nSholmes:\n...Oh yes... ...there is!\n*BANG!*\nSusato:\nAAAAAAAH!!! Mr Sholmes! Mr Shooolmes!!!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat the- (Has Sholmes been shot?!)\nSholmes:\nLeave me, Mr Naruhodo!\nRyunosuke:\nBut...\nSholmes:\nAfter them! Go!\nRyunosuke:\nRight!\nRyunosuke:\n...Blast! (I've lost them!)\n???:\n'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere?\nBobby:\nThe alarm was just raised from this pawnbroker's sir. Would you know somethin' about that?\nRyunosuke:\nOfficer! Come with me! It's my friend! Mr Sholmes! He's been shot!\nBobby:\nShot?!\nRyunosuke:\nWith the policeman close behind me, I ran back to Windibank's...\nAnime cutscene\nRyunosuke:\nMr Sholmes!\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo!\nRyunosuke:\nHow bad is it?\nSholmes:\nAgh...never mind me. But there's much at stake. Behind that door... In the storeroom! ...Hurry!\nRyunosuke:\nHuh?! It's...it's Gina?!\nTo be continued...\n*BANG!*\nAAAAAAAH!!!\nI'll be alright, Mr Naruhodo! After them! Go! Behind that door. In the storeroom! ...Hurry!\nIt's...it's Gina?!\n\nFrom that moment, Windibank's Pawnbrokery became a crime scene. Everything that followed happened in a whirlwind of activity. The arrival of the police, the preliminary investigation of the scene and the questioning... It was just before dawn before I was allowed back to my lodgings at 221B.\n16th April, 6:21 a.m.\nNaruhodo's Legal Consultancy\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Iris!\nIris:\nA telegram came. But all it said was, 'Wait at home'.\nRyunosuke:\nOh, yes, we asked one of the policemen to have it sent. It was simply impossible to come back.\nIris:\nWhen I woke up...I was all alone. Hurley and Ginny were gone. Everyone was gone. What happened, Runo?\nRyunosuke:\n(Poor Iris. She's trembling. She's obviously trying very hard not to let herself get too worried.) ...I'll explain everything that I know.\nIris:\nSomething awful has happened, hasn't it?\nRyunosuke:\n......... Yes, I'm afraid so.\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nRyunosuke:\nI'm afraid I'll need to go out again now, Iris. There's not much I can do at the moment... But I can at least try to find out how Mr Sholmes and Gina are getting on.\nIris:\nI want to go, too. Take me with you, Runo!\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nIris:\nI can't stand just sitting around here waiting.\nRyunosuke:\n(I'm not sure how I feel about taking a ten-year-old child to the scene of a murder... But I don't want to leave her all alone here, either.) Alright then, Iris. Perhaps you can help me?\nIris:\nOh yes! I'd love to!\nRyunosuke:\nGina's at the prison. Mr Sholmes is...probably in his hospital bed.\nIris:\nAnd don't forget we have to visit the crime scene! We need to conduct a thorough investigation!\nRyunosuke:\nAh, I can see you're ready for action! (I imagine Iris would appreciate going to the hospital sooner rather than later...)\nSholmes's Suite\nBaker Street\n16th April\nSt Synner's Hospital, Ward 3\nIris:\nHurley! ...Oh! He's not here!\nRyunosuke:\nNo. That's strange... The nurse definitely said he was in the bed by the window, didn't she?\nIris:\nOoh, I know what's probably happened! Hurley was being a big baby. And the bullet wound wasn't that bad after all so he's been sent home.\nRyunosuke:\nHm, I'm not so sure about that. Baby or not... ...there's no question that it was a fairly serious injury that Mr Sholmes suffered.\nIris:\nOh...\n???:\n'Ello 'ello, what 'ave we 'ere?\nBobby:\nThis ward is off limits! No visitin'! So what are you doin' in 'ere, eh?\nIris:\nWell, I'll have you know, we're Hurley's next of kin!\nBobby:\nEh? ...Oh! Well beggin' your pardon then, ma'am. Sir. ...A little lady and a curious Eastern gentleman... The great mystery-solver 'as a mysterious family, eh.\nRyunosuke:\n(...If that's how you see us, um...sure.)\nIris:\nWhere is he, Constable? Where's Hurley?\nBobby:\nI believe 'e is currently in the operatin' theatre, ma'am. Undergoin' an extensive operation.\nIris:\nExtensive?!\nBobby:\nIt 'as been several 'ours since 'e went in.\nIris:\nOh dear... Is he going to be alright?\nBobby:\nWell, it doesn't appear to be workin', you see. The anaesthetic, that is.\nIris:\nOh!\nBobby:\nI 'ave 'eard a report that the gentleman claims 'e may 'ave 'ad a little too much to drink last night. Coffee, that is.\nRyunosuke:\nHaah...\nBobby:\nAnyway, I think it would be fair to assume that 'e won't be back 'ere for several 'ours yet.\nRyunosuke:\n...I see. Thank you, Constable. Perhaps we should leave and come back later.\nIris:\nOh, poor Hurley...\n16th April\nWindibank's Pawnbrokery\nIris:\nThis is where it happened, then? Last night.\nRyunosuke:\nThat's right. The two thugs I told you about were obviously ransacking the place, looking for valuables.\nIris:\nBut... ...apart from the policemen in here, you wouldn't know anything had happened. There's no sign of a disturbance.\nRyunosuke:\nNo...you're right about that, actually.\nIris:\nIn fact, if anyone, it's the police who seem to be the ones doing the ransacking.\nRyunosuke:\nI know what you mean. They're like a gang of organised criminals, all dressed in black!\n???:\nOi! I heard that!\nRyunosuke:\nOh, Inspector! Erm... Good morning.\nGregson:\nHmph. I s'pose I ought to thank you for your vigilance last night. We got to the scene before it was disturbed at least. Shame you let the two rogues get away, mind.\nRyunosuke:\nYes... I'm sorry about that.\nIris:\n...I thought you'd assigned extra men to the beat around here, Gregsy. Now look what's happened! Hurley's been injured because there weren't enough police on duty!\nGregson:\n.........Ah! Y...Y...Your Ladyship! No one told me you were comin'!\nIris:\nI expect you to take full responsibility for what happened to Hurley and see he has the very best medical care!\nGregson:\nOf course, Your Ladyship! The very best doctors in the capital are tendin' to him as we speak!\nIris:\nAnd I don't think it's Runo's fault that the rogues managed to get away, is it? Chasing criminals is the police's job.\nGregson:\nAbsolutely, Your Ladyship! As you say, ma'am, as you say! The gent in black is totally blameless! Everyone's in agreement about that.\nRyunosuke:\n(Would you believe it?! He's like a completely different person with Iris. Talk about a personality change...)\nGregson:\nOh! Where are me manners? Are you thirsty, Your Ladyship? Perhaps you'd like some juice? Some nice, refreshin' fruit juice?\nIris:\nOh, why? Are you thirsty, Gregsy? I have some of my special herbal tea with me, if you'd like some!\nGregson:\n*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Ta very much. That really hit the spot...Your Ladyship.\nRyunosuke:\n(I don't even recognise him like this...)\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nGregson:\nOh...yeah...there's somethin' I was s'posed to talk to you about, actually, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\nYes? What is it?\nGregson:\nI've got an important message for you. I clean forgot about it until now.\nRyunosuke:\nAn important message? (I wonder what it could be...)\n16th April\nBritish Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes... ...no matter how many times I come here, I always get the same sense of oppressiveness somehow...)\nIris:\nDo you think the place is oppressive? I think it's normal.\nRyunosuke:\nHow so?!\nIris:\nI mean, look at that suit of armour over there. You can't take that seriously, can you?\nRyunosuke:\n...Maybe it thinks the same about you.\n???:\n...So everything is clear with regard to tomorrow's arrangements, I trust?\n???:\nYes. Thank you very much.\nRyunosuke:\n(There they are. Susato-san and Lord Stronghart.)\nIris:\nI wonder what they're talking about. They both look very serious.\nStronghart:\nVery good. There is nothing further to discuss. You may return to your lodgings. No doubt you have much to do in preparation for your return to your homeland.\nRyunosuke:\n......... (...Wait, what did he just say? 'Your return to your homeland'...?) Susato-san!\nSusato:\n...! Oh! Um...Mr Naruhodo...\nRyunosuke:\n......... What was all that about?\nSusato:\n.........\nStronghart:\nAh, Mr Naruhodo. Thank you for coming to collect your colleague.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat's this all about? Why were you talking about Miss Susato's 'return to her homeland'? And, and... ...tomorrow?!\nSusato:\n.........\nIris:\nTomorrow...? But what about Ginny's trial?\nSusato:\n...! You mean... ...she's been formally charged now? Oh dear...\nIris:\n.........\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nStronghart:\n...Three minutes precisely until my next meeting. You must excuse me.\nRyunosuke:\n......... There's just...one more thing, Lord Stronghart.\nStronghart:\nWhich is?\nRyunosuke:\nIt's Miss Lestrade's trial... I wonder if you might permit me to defend her?\nStronghart:\n......... A timely suggestion.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nStronghart:\nThe girl currently has no representation.\nIris:\nBut, but that's not fair! Yes, she may be a pickpocket, but she still deserves a fair trial!\nStronghart:\n...Do not misunderstand me, young lady. The government provides for those too poor to afford representation with a public defender. The accused need only sign the relevant paperwork, and a defence barrister will be assigned to the case. However...the young girl in question has refused that right.\nRyunosuke:\nWhy would she do that?\nStronghart:\nA question you would do well to direct at Miss Lestrade. You'll find her at the local prison.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, thank you.\nStronghart:\nNow then, it's time I was leaving. Good day to you.\nRyunosuke:\n(What a day. Gina charged with murder... Susato-san about to leave...)\nSusato:\n......... Come, Mr Naruhodo. Iris. We must make haste.\nIris:\nBut, Susie... ...you're leaving for Japan tomorrow morning, aren't you? Don't you have packing and things to do?\nSusato:\n......... As Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant, my personal circumstances are of no consequence. My sole purpose remains to help you in whatever way I can.\nRyunosuke:\n...Thank you, Miss Susato. (That's a very pensive look...)\nRyunosuke:\n(If I'm honest, this has completely thrown me off. I'll just have to do what I can...as a lawyer...)\n16th April\nLocal Prison, Cell 13\nAfter clearing all Converse options at Local Prison, Cell 13 and Lord Chief Justice's Office:\nSusato:\nGina... ...I wonder if you might hear me out. There's something I'd like to say.\nGina:\nWot?\nSusato:\nI'm sorry to say...that I must reluctantly bid you farewell.\nGina:\nEh? Farewell?\nSusato:\nTomorrow, I must begin my journey back home. To Japan. ...I fear we may never meet again.\nGina:\n...! Oh...right...\nSusato:\nI've had the pleasure of meeting so many lovely people here in London. I have so many wonderful memories. And yet...as things stand now... ...it will be a glum parting indeed. Poor Iris is so miserable.\nIris:\nSusie...\nGina:\nWell...well...that ain't my business!\nSusato:\nBoth Iris and Mr Naruhodo believe you to be innocent, Gina. They've put their faith in you. But somehow...you can't find it in your heart to put your faith in them.\nGina:\nYeah! That's right, I can't! ...Wot of it?\nSusato:\nIt grieves me greatly to have to say goodbye to my friends when they are so clearly unhappy... ...because of you.\nGina:\n...! Wot, it's MY fault?!\nSusato:\nYes. So I have one final request, Gina, before our paths never cross again. Right here and now... ...I want you to show both of them that you don't deserve the faith they've invested in you.\nGina:\nEh?!\nSusato:\nOnly by doing that... ...will you truly be as alone as you claim to be.\nGina:\n...! Wot are you talkin' about? Wot d'you expect me to do, eh?\nSusato:\nYou've told us that everyone lies. So prove it! ...By admitting one of your own untruths.\nGina:\n.........\nIris:\nWhat about what you said before, Ginny? You said something about unforgivable lies.\nSusato:\nYou must tell Mr Naruhodo and Iris the truth now. That is my last request before I leave. My last request as a judicial assistant.\nGina:\nNo... I, I can't...\nRyunosuke:\n(Whatever these lies are, they're obviously weighing very heavily on Gina's mind...) Gina, I could be wrong, but... ...is it something to do with what happened two months ago? Something about that trial?\nThe one in which Magnus McGilded was acquitted?\nGina:\nAh...\nRyunosuke:\nThe case of that mysterious murder that took place inside the omnibus... You were called as a witness by the prosecution. Is that what this is about?\nGina:\n......... Yeah. You're right. Because...in that trial... ...I lied. I lied like you wouldn't believe.\nRyunosuke:\n......... Will you tell us about it now?\nGina:\n.........\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nGina:\n......... I bet yer ready to string me up, eh? I lied...in that big old courtroom. I told some corkers.\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nGina:\nThe thing is, 'e said 'e would make it so we couldn't live in the East End no more. That's wot 'e threatened me wiv.\nIris:\nWhat a wicked man...\nGina:\n'E knew everyfin' wot went on in the back slums. 'E knew we 'ad no one to look after us, and we was all just lookin' out for each other, gettin' by together.\nSusato:\nSo you mean...Mr McGilded would have-\nGina:\nIn an 'eartbeat! 'E could've 'ad the lot of us chased out o' there if 'e'd wanted. And then where could we 'ave gone, eh? Nowhere, that's where! So... I didn't 'ave no choice. .........\nRyunosuke:\nThank you, Gina, for telling us everything.\nGina:\nBut...I'm for it now, eh?! Go on, admit it! You must be livid!\nRyunosuke:\nWell...you can make amends by doing me a simple favour.\nGina:\n...A favour? Wot?\nRyunosuke:\nSign the representation papers for tomorrow's trial.\nGina:\nEh?!\nRyunosuke:\nIf you don't actually want me to represent you in court, you can rip it up later. But we need that paperwork or we can't investigate. The police won't let us.\nGina:\nInvestigate wot?\nRyunosuke:\nThe scene of the incident last night. Mr Sholmes was shot, you see.\nGina:\nYou wot?!\nIris:\nHurley's having a big operation right now, Ginny.\nGina:\nIs it bad?! Is, is 'e gonna be alright? Sholmes is gonna be alright...right?\nIris:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nThat's why I want to investigate. For Mr Sholmes's sake as much as anything.\nGina:\n......... Right. So wot yer sayin' is, if I sign that bit o' paper, everyone's 'appy, is that it?\nRyunosuke:\nSomething like that. ...Miss Susato?\nSusato:\nYes! Of course! I have the representation papers here.\nGina:\n......... ...I, I don't need no one to stick up for me, though. No lawyer or nuffin'.\nIris:\nPoor Ginny... She seems so lonely.\nGina's representation papers have been entered into the Court Record.\nRyunosuke:\nWell...at least this should mean we can investigate the scene at Windibank's now.\nIris:\nYes. And perhaps we can come back to visit Ginny when we're done there?\nRyunosuke:\n(I feel like we've finally cracked Gina. She's opened up to us at last. And now I have her representation papers... No one else knows just what a responsibility that is. Anyway, for now it means Inspector Gregson can't stop us investigating at Windibank's. Although something tells me he's not going to be happy about it...)\nTo be continued...\n16th April, 1:26 p.m.\nWindibank's Pawnbrokery\nRyunosuke:\n(Here we are again at the scene of the crime... Now to thrust these representation papers in Gregson's face and see what he makes of them!) Hello again, Inspector. Do you have a minute, please?\nGregson:\nWhat is it now? You should go home and get some rest.\nIris:\nHere you are, Gregsy! Here are the representation papers!\nGregson:\n.........Your Ladyship! Hooooooooooooooooooooow?! I don't believe it! How the devil did you get that stubborn little ragabash to sign that?! I salute you! That is good work, that is.\nIris:\nI can see you've been very busy here as well. How about some tea? It's a special blend designed to relieve fatigue!\nGregson:\n*Glug* *Glug glug glug* Ahhh... Lovely! Well, let's see now... Yes... Yes! I hardly feel tired at all! I'm fit as a fiddle, Your Ladyship!\nRyunosuke:\n...Would it be alright if we investigated the scene of the crime, then?\nGregson:\nDo as you please! You know where it happened. Through that door behind the counter.\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes, the storeroom... That's where I discovered Mr Windibank...and Gina.)\nGregson:\nRight, well...I'll be gettin' back to business then.\nRyunosuke:\nWill you be investigating in the storeroom as well, Inspector?\nGregson:\nIf I'm perfectly honest, we need to wrap this up before long. Can't afford to spend too much time on it. But there are so many articles to go through, it's taking forever, even with the lads workin' round the clock. Which is a problem, 'cause there's another case the Yard needs to investigate urgently.\nRyunosuke:\n(That must be what Lord Stronghart meant by 'far more serious matters' before...)\nGregson:\nSo what I'm sayin' is, don't get under my feet, sunshine!\nSusato:\nCome then! Let us not waste any time!\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nIris:\nSo what do you think of these stereoscopic prints then, Runo?\nRyunosuke:\nThey're certainly amazing, but it isn't easy to get the knack of viewing them properly.\nIris:\nNo, some people find it easier than others. But that's why contraptions like this exist. For people who find it tricky.\nSusato:\nOh! I recognise that. We saw one over there yesterday, didn't we? If I remember correctly, you press this little knob here... ...then set the pair of photographs in this stand at the back and...\nRyunosuke:\nIt's still amazing, even though I know roughly how it works now.\nIris:\nWell, London seems to agree with you. Stereoscopes are very popular at the moment. You can find one of these folding contraptions in lots of households in the capital currently.\nRyunosuke:\nBut if these little machines are so affordable... ...surely there's no need to go around staring cross-eyed at pictures like you hate them.\nIris:\n......... But it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Well, I think so, in any case.\nRyunosuke:\n(Stereoscopic pictures... I'd never even heard of them until yesterday. We've certainly learnt a lot about them. But I wonder if it's knowledge that I'll ever actually need...)\nThe second white cat photograph has been entered into the Court Record.\nIris:\nOh! That looks like blood!\nRyunosuke:\nI would say it's from a gloved finger. Almost certainly a glove made of leather.\niris:\nWell don't worry, Runo! You can leave the rest to me!\nRyunosuke:\nLook at that...\nIris:\nYes, that's a colour we haven't seen before, isn't it?\nSusato:\nWe simply must add it to the portfolio of blood samples! It could be an important clue. Although...it would be nice to find out whose blood these different colours correspond to at some point.\nRyunosuke:\n......... (Well, this particular stain of blood...)\nIris:\nOh! You've had an idea, haven't you? Do you know whose blood this is?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I have an idea whose blood it is. Not from the colour it turned, but with a little deduction.\nIris:\nThat's right! I think it's clear.\nSusato:\nIris, you know as well?\nIris:\nYou first, Runo. Who do you think it belongs to?\nRyunosuke:\nAlright, I believe that this is the blood of...\nRyunosuke:\n...'Thrice-Fired' Mason...?\nIris:\nYou don't sound very sure of yourself, the way you trailed off there.\nRyunosuke:\nWell it was two months ago now, that case. And of course I'd never met the victim. So I'm struggling to remember his name. He was definitely 'Thrice-Fired', though.\nSusato:\nThe victim...of the omnibus case? Yes, his name was indeed Mr 'Thrice-Fired' Mason. But that would mean that this bloodstain... ...was left on the ticket two months ago!\nRyunosuke:\nYes. I think it was. Gina brought this ticket here to Windibank's yesterday. I'm suggesting that the bloodstain was already on it at that time.\nIris:\nSo it's a smear of blood from the time that Mr Mason was killed two months ago!\nSusato:\nSomething else is coming back to me now... Mr McGilded was also wearing leather gloves that night.\nMcGilded:\nNow I ask youse, what good-hearted soul wouldn't rush to help a fella bleedin' from his stomach? I wasn't about to start worryin' about me gloves now, was I? I reached out to give the man a hand.\nRyunosuke:\nIt certainly does look like a leather-gloved thumbprint, this mark. But we know that Mr McGilded had no injuries at the time, anywhere on his body. From which we can conclude... ...that any blood on the glove...belonged to the victim, Mr Mason!\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo! You sound just like Mr Sholmes!\nRyunosuke:\n(...Minus the quirky slip-ups, I hope.)\nIris:\nYes, I think you're right, Runo!\nSusato:\nVery well. Let's make a note of this.\nThe details of the pawnbroker's ticket for the coat have been updated in the Court Record.\nThe blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record.\n16th April\nLocal Prison, Cell 13\nRyunosuke:\nGina doesn't appear to be here.\nSusato:\nI believe she must be in questioning at the moment.\nIris:\nOh, but...wait a minute...\nRyunosuke:\nWhat is it, Iris?\nIris:\nWell if you examine the scene here carefully, there's another possibility, isn't there? Ginny could have slipped the key from the jailer when he wasn't looking and escaped!\nSusato:\nOh my!\nRyunosuke:\nWhy, why would she do something like that? It would only make her situation worse!\nIris:\n......... Calm down, Runo! I was only joking of course!\nRyunosuke:\n......... Oh. Ugh...you had me worried there. I thought it was a 'great deduction'.\nSusato:\nYes, it must be your way with words, Iris. You're so wonderfully persuasive. Perhaps you don't fully understand the weight your words carry.\nIris:\nOh dear... I'm sorry. I suppose a light-hearted great detective is a contradiction in terms.\nRyunosuke:\nWell, in the same situation, I'm sure Mr Sholmes would just have thrown his head back and guffawed.\nSusato:\nI'm not entirely sure that's helpful, Mr Naruhodo...\nRyunosuke:\nWell anyway, it looks like we won't be able to talk to Gina for a while. We should try to make progress with our investigation in the meantime.\nIris:\nYes. Come along then, Runo! Come along, Susie!\n16th April\nWindibank's Storeroom\nIris:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n(Poor Iris... She's clammed up completely.)\nSusato:\nIris is bound to find this difficult. After all, Mr Windibank's life was taken in this very room only last night.\nIris:\n.........\nGregson:\n.........Ah!\nRyunosuke:\nWait! Inspector!\nGregson:\nWhat is it now, sunshine?\nRyunosuke:\nYou took one look at me and tried to run away!\nGregson:\nYou think a Scotland Yard inspector would run away from some jumped-up little defence lawyer, do ya?\nIris:\n.........\nGregson:\nI just! Well... ...I've never seen Her Ladyship lookin' like that before, is the thing. I didn't know what to say to her.\nRyunosuke:\n(So you weren't running away from me...you were running away from a ten-year-old.)\nSusato:\nI'm afraid this is all a little much for young Iris. Some gentle reassurance might go a long way perhaps, Inspector.\nGregson:\nEh?!\nIris:\n.........\nGregson:\nErm... Ahem! Don't, um... Don't trouble yourself unduly, Your Ladyship. I mean...at least you're not dead, are you?\nRyunosuke:\n...I don't think that went very well.\nGregson:\n......... WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! Look! I'm in the middle of an investigation here, sunshine! And I told you not to get under my feet!\nSusato:\nAnd we have investigating to do ourselves.\nRyunosuke:\nYes. I'd like to hear more of what the socially inept inspector has to say.\nIris:\nOh Hurley...\nRyunosuke:\n(And enquire into how Mr Sholmes's operation is going...)\nAfter clearing all Converse options, examining calendar, and presenting Pawnbroker's Ticket (Coat) in Windibank's Main Shop, and clearing all Converse options, examining chalk outline, red chest, and revolver in Windibank's Storeroom:\n*Dong* *Dong* *Dong*\nIris:\nAAAAAAGH!!! I nearly jumped out of my skin there! How could Mr Windibank set such a wicked trap?!\nRyunosuke:\nI...I doubt he set out to scare anyone.\nSusato:\nIs that really the time? I think perhaps we should pay Gina another visit soon.\nRyunosuke:\nOh?\nSusato:\nHer trial is tomorrow. We must establish whether or not you will be defending her. I think we should ask her one more time. ...She may have changed her mind.\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nIris:\nDon't you remember, Runo? You told her she could rip up the representation papers if she didn't want you to be her lawyer.\nRyunosuke:\n...Really? Did I say that?\nYes.\nYou did.\nSusato:\nThe deadline for submitting the paperwork is fast approaching.\nRyunosuke:\n(In that case, we had better hurry back to the prison and talk to Gina again.)\n16th April, 5:41 p.m.\nLocal Prison, Cell 13\nRyunosuke:\nAh, Gina, good... You're back.\nGina:\nAh! .........\nSusato:\nThe police must have finished questioning her, then.\nIris:\nOh, how was it, Ginny? Was it awful?\nGina:\nEh? Oh... Didn't bother me.\nRyunosuke:\nThank you for the papers you signed before. It meant we were able to investigate at Windibank's.\nGina:\nOh...right... .........\nIris:\nDon't you want to know how we got on? We've been ever so busy.\nGina:\n......... Wot's the point in askin'? Won't change wot everyone's sayin'. That I did it.\nIris:\nThat's not...\nGina:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nGina, we came to ask for your final decision.\nGina:\nEh? Wot decision?\nRyunosuke:\nAbout tomorrow's trial. Will you let me defend you or not?\nGina:\n...!\nSusato:\nI must submit the paperwork now if you'd like Mr Naruhodo to represent you.\nGina:\nRight...I see...\nRyunosuke:\n(She's really lost her fight all of a sudden. But I know what that feels like. The worry is just so hard to bear...)\nRyunosuke:\nThose stains on the sleeves of your new coat, Gina... They're blood, aren't they? Not that I know whose blood yet.\nGina:\nWOT?!\nSusato:\nB-Blood, Mr Naruhodo?!\nRyunosuke:\nYou don't appear to have any obvious wounds yourself, though. So could it be blood that spattered from Mr Windibank when he was shot last night?\nIris:\nLet's not beat around the bush here. This trusty friend of mine will get results much faster than anything else!\nGina:\nEh?! T-Take it easy, Iris!\nIris:\nDon't move, Ginny! I'm going to shoot!\nOh...\nSusato:\nOh my!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat the...? Forget the sleeves...\nIris:\n...The whole coat is covered in blood!\nRyunosuke:\n(Of course! The black colour of the fabric was masking the stains. That's why we haven't seen them until now!)\nSusato:\nAnd the blood has reacted with the chemical to turn a purple colour... ...which matches one of the samples we've already collected perfectly!\nIris:\nYes, now let's see...who had the purple blood? Aha! Yes, it was the brickmaker, Mr Mason. The victim of the murder case two months ago.\nRyunosuke:\n......... (I knew it...)\nGina:\nWot, wot are you all on about? The victim? Wot d'you mean?\nSusato:\n......... It's a rather uncomfortable situation, Mr Naruhodo, but I think this makes things quite clear. It means the omnibus case is finally solved. The truth about who really murdered the brickmaker, Mr Mason...is revealed.\nGina:\nOi! Would someone explain wot's goin' on?! Stop tellin' 'alf a story!\nSusato:\n.........\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nSusato:\nGina...may I ask you something?\nGina:\nWot?\nSusato:\nI'd just like to make absolutely sure... What would you like us to do with these representation papers for tomorrow's trial?\nGina:\n......... 'Ow many times do I 'ave to say it? Rip 'em up and chuck 'em away.\nSusato:\nAre you really sure that's what you want?\nGina:\nI bet that's wot 'e wants an' all now. Mr 'I'm-a-Believer' Lawyer over there.\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nGina:\nDon't forget it was me in that trial two months ago. I led everyone up the garden path, didn't I? An' yer tellin' me you can believe in me after that? Not likely.\nSusato:\n......... Well, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\n(A lawyer's primary weapon is an unwavering belief in his clients... Ultimately it comes down to whether or not I feel I can trust Gina after everything that's happened...)\nRyunosuke:\nGina...let me say it again... Please allow me to represent you in tomorrow's trial.\nGina:\nEh? Are you 'alf-baked?\nRyunosuke:\nNot at all. You've not once admitted to committing the crime, have you? What's more...I believe that you're telling me the truth.\nGina:\n......... Seriously, um...Mr Narrow-'Oddo... ...didn't you 'ear all of wot I said before? I'm a born liar. Fibs just trip off me tongue. And I'm a diver, don't forget. I pulled the wool over yer eyes two months ago and got you into all sorts o' trouble. Why would you ever trust me now? I just don't get it!\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nSusato:\nGina...\nGina:\n...!\nSusato:\n...I do understand why you choose not to put your trust in others. But I assure you, there is more to this life than you yet realise.\nGina:\nWot d'you mean?\nSusato:\nThe world we live in... ...is full of people you would do very well to trust. People who won't ever let you down.\nGina:\nEh?\nRyunosuke:\nIt's true that I'm just a student of law, and I'm certainly lacking in courtroom experience. But I can promise you this: Whatever happens...and until my very last breath... ...I am completely on your side!\nGina:\n......... Wot...wot d'you expect me to say to that? .........\nSusato:\nThen it's decided. I will take these papers now and carry out the necessary preparations for tomorrow's trial. It would be a shame to throw them away now after it's been penned with your name so beautifully.\nGina:\n...Do wot you like. You Eastern lot are...are... I dunno wot you are! I don't get ya!\nRyunosuke:\n(Gina's taken herself off to the back of her cell. She'd never admit it, but I hope she's feeling relieved. That turned out alright in the end...I think.)\n...........................\nSusato:\nWhoever's hiding there... ...show yourself at once! Eavesdropping is the height of cowardice!\nRyunosuke:\nMiss Susato?!\nSusato:\nSomebody is there in the shadows. I can sense it. Somebody who wasn't there before!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?!\n???:\n......... ...Blimey, you're sharp, eh?\nGregson:\nI s'pose you were usin' one of those mystic Japanese arts. Like the art of stealth I've heard so much about.\nRyunosuke:\n...If anyone was being stealthy, it was you, Inspector.\nIris:\nGregsy!\nGregson:\nOh dear me, I am most terribly sorry, Your Ladyship! I didn't mean to startle you!\nIris:\nHow long have you been listening in on our conversation?\nGregson:\nGood grief! Listenin' in?! No no no! I just got word that there were some visitors who were refusin' to leave even though it was after hours. I assure you, Your Ladyship, I only just arrived. This very minute! Not a moment earlier! That's all it is! Nothin' untoward! Nothin' at all!\nRyunosuke:\nAfter hours...? Is it that late already?\nGregson:\nSo then, I'll humbly excuse myself now, Your Ladyship. Ta-ta! Toodle-oo! Cheerio! All the best! Bye, by and by!\nRyunosuke:\n(That's a lot of farewells, and not one of them appropriate for 'Her Ladyship'.)\nIris:\nOh, but I wanted to have a chat!\nGregson:\nI'm, I'm terribly sorry, but time is pressin' at the minute.\nIris:\nOh, I see. ...That's a shame.\nGregson:\nIf I don't get this emergency at the Supreme Court dealt with sharpish, Lord  Stronghart will, well...\nIris:\nEmergency?!\nRyunosuke:\nLord Stronghart?\nGregson:\nNothin'! Forget I said anythin'! Anyway...ahem! I'm off!\nIris:\nAlright, Gregsy, if you have to. But let's chat soon!\nGregson:\nDelighted! Charmed! Can't wait! If you please! My pleasure!\nRyunosuke:\n(That's a lot of pleasantries, and not one of them sounded sincere...)\nIris:\nGregsy's so funny! He says such silly things!\nRyunosuke:\nIt's certainly entertaining to see an inspector of the police fawning to a ten-year-old girl. (But anyway, I wonder what this emergency is at the Supreme Court...)\nSusato:\nI must attend the court clerk's office now before it closes.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, of course. Thank you, Miss Susato.\nSusato:\n......... Kindly escort Iris home now, Mr Naruhodo. I shall meet you there later.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd so our investigation came to an end. Susato-san went to file the necessary papers for my defence of Gina the following day. And then it hit me... I could no longer suppress the wretched feeling that had been gnawing away at my insides. Tomorrow...Susato-san would be leaving. Leaving Britain and making her way back to Japan.\n16th April, 11:13 p.m.\nNaruhodo's Legal Consultancy\nSusato:\nNaruhodo-san... ...it's been a very trying day, hasn't it? I do hope you're not too exhausted.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat about you, Susato-san? Today has been even more trying for you, I'm sure. (Mr Sholmes was shot before our eyes, Gina was arrested... ...all on the back of the news that her father has fallen ill and that she must return to Japan at once.) I...hope your father recovers soon.\nSusato:\nThank you for your kind words. .........\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nSusato:\nI wonder why it is... ...that so many thoughts rage in my head like a storm... ...and yet I seem unable to find the words to express any of them.\nRyunosuke:\nI know exactly what you mean.\nSusato:\nAnyway, I have one final task to complete as your judicial assistant. Once that is done, I shall make preparations for my departure tomorrow.\nRyunosuke:\n(One final task...?)\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nSusato:\nWell...it's getting rather late. I think you should go to bed now, Naruhodo-san. I must finish packing up my things in my room.\nRyunosuke:\nSusato-san, I...\nSusato:\nI wish you the very best of luck tomorrow! ...Good night.\nRyunosuke:\nWait! There's, there's something I need to say!\nSusato:\nHaiiiiii-YA!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat, what was that...?\nSusato:\nA secret technique of mine... The 'Susato Shutdown'.\nRyunosuke:\nShutdown?\nSusato:\n......... Please...I implore you... If we have to voice our goodbyes... ...I won't be able to hold back my tears.\nRyunosuke:\n......... Susato-san...\nIt truly had been a trying day. On our feet for hours... Getting Gina to open up to us... And learning the truth about that nemesis of a case. Physically and mentally, I was exhausted. And yet the idea of sleep seemed impossible. But I forced myself to close my eyes... ...eventually...my fatigue triumphed, and I fell into a deep sleep.\n......................................................\n17th April, the Small Hours\nSt Synner's Hospital, Ward 3\n???:\n...Yes, I quite understand.\n???:\nThat is a great weight off my mind.\nSholmes:\nRest assured, I shall put everything in place, exactly as we have discussed.\n???:\nThank you so much. It has been an honour and a pleasure to be acquainted with you, Mr Sholmes.\nSholmes:\nOn the contrary. The pleasure has been mine. I bid you farewell...and Godspeed... ...my dear madam.\nTo be continued...",

I used Daddy's notes to write it. I think it's a great story! I don't know why Hurley's forbidden me to publish it.\nRyunosuke:\nNo, it's strange, isn't it? Perhaps it's a problem with the title? Perhaps Mr Sholmes is a family friend of someone who has that name or something?\nIris:\nHmmm... Well, it doesn't have quite the same ring to it, but I could change it to 'The Hound of the Naruhodos'...\nRyunosuke:\n...I'm fairly sure that Mr Sholmes is a friend of someone who has that name, too.17th April, 9:32 a.m.\nThe Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberRyunosuke:\nGood morning, Gina.Gina:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nI'm determined to prove your innocence today. I'm sure we can do it!Gina:\n......... So where's yer friend then?Ryunosuke:\nSorry?Gina:\nYa know, 'er in the fancy dress. ...Susarto or 'owever you say it. I dunno.Ryunosuke:\nAh, Miss Susato had to leave early in the morning. She was already gone by the time I woke up.Gina:\n......... You alright wiv that, are ya? Forget about me, if ya like. Go and see 'er off.Ryunosuke:\n...It's fine. It's not as though Miss Susato and I won't meet again... one day.Gina:\nE-Even so...Ryunosuke:\nBut you, Gina... ...you only get one chance.

Waggy!Ryunosuke:\n(...Great way to show your support, kitty.)Gina:\nLet 'im 'ave a nose around. Wot 'arm can it do?Iris:\nOh, that reminds me. I bought a paper on the way here. Now, would you like the good news or the bad news? What do you say, Runo? Ginny?Ryunosuke:\nOh, well, I think I'd rather get the bad news out of the way first.Gina:\nNah, always take the good news first. Ya might not live to 'ear the bad.Iris:\nYes...that question always gives away people's personalities.Ryunosuke:\n...Let's not go there.Iris:\nAlright then, I'll give you the bad news first. A record amount of rain has fallen this morning, and carriages all over the capital are struggling to move.Ryunosuke:\n...Huh? (The bad news...was a weather report?)Iris:\nSo I hope that Susie made her train to Dover and that the train isn't delayed on its way to the port.Ryunosuke:\nGosh...yes.Gina:\nAlright then, so wot's the good news?Iris:\nWell! The rain is forcast to subside this afternoon. So even if the train is delayed, it should be able to make up the time later! Well? That is good news, isn't it?Gina:\nI couldn't give a monkey's, really.Ryunosuke:\n(If only all good news cancelled out the bad.)Iris:\nAnd look! This trial has made the headlines, too! 'Pawnbroker Perishes in Pickpurse Plunder!' See?Gina:\nTsk, 'ow d'you like that? Well let 'em say wot they want! See if I care!Ryunosuke:\n(...I can't, because you're covering your face.)Iris:\nDon't worry! Runo will soon show everyone that this headline is nonsense.Ryunosuke:\nI will?Iris:\nAnd then, in tomorrow's papers, the headline will be: 'Discharged Diver is Dauntless Do-Gooder!' ...Isn't that right, Runo?Ryunosuke:\nOh, um...yes. Let's hope so.Iris:\nOf course they will! I have absolute faith in you! ...How was that? I was trying to sound like Susie. Did it work? Did it?Ryunosuke:\n(...It's like she was still here.)Today's paper has been entered into the Court Record.Iris:\nGood luck then, Runo.

She's trying to put on a brave face, but I can tell she's worried and scared. I have to believe in her from start to finish. That's the weapon that will secure our victory here.

This trial shall determine the guilt or innocence of Miss Gina Lestrade. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution is ready.Ryunosuke:\nThe defence...is ready.Judge:\nLord van Zieks...Van Zieks:\n...My Lord?Judge:\nRemind me, how many years ago was it that you withdrew from the public prosecution service?Van Zieks:\n......... It was some five years ago, My Lord.Judge:\nYes, and then two months ago you resurfaced somewhat unexpectedly. And here you are again today. Are there some circumstances of which the court should be aware that have led to this...erratic behaviour?Van Zieks:\n.........Judge:\nIn what one might describe as your former life five years past... ...you dealt exclusively in matters concerned with the highest echelons of society and government.Ryunosuke:\n...! (Really...?)Judge:\nYet today you choose to try a simple case of burglary and murder. I confess I find it more than a little befuddling, Counsel.Van Zieks:\n......... There are two types of person I cannot abide. Firstly, those wealthy scoundrels who hide behind a mask of philanthropy to cheat the public at large...Iris:\nHe means Mr McGilded, who you defended against the Reaper two months ago.Ryunosuke:\n...Yes, I'd just about managed to work that out. Thank you. (Magnus McGilded... If I'd known what a monster he was, I never would have defended him.)Van Zieks:\n...And secondly - even more loathsome... ...those wily scoundrels who masquerade as allies only to effect total betrayal in the final hour. In other words, the confidence tricksters from those tiny islands in the Far East...the Nipponese!Ryunosuke:\nWha...?! (Did he really just say that?!)Iris:\nHe means you now, Runo.Ryunosuke:\n...I actually managed to work that out, too. Thank you, Iris. 'Total betrayal'? What are you talking about?Van Zieks:\n.........Ryunosuke:\n(That torrid look of hatred in Lord van Zieks's eyes... Was that directed solely at me? Or was he talking about all Japanese people?)Judge:\n......... An alarmingly scathing explanation, Lord van Zieks. Still, the judiciary welcomes the return of the so-called 'Reaper of the Bailey', feared by all London's malefactors.Van Zieks:\n...Your Lordship is too kind.Judge:\nNow, jurors... The six of you have been selected at random to represent the will of the people in this trial. Are you ready to hear the evidence placed before you, and determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant?Juror No. 1:\nFormer lieutenant in the British Army here, don't you know. Chaps like me were born ready!Juror No. 2:\nClean crockery, clean cutlery and a clean conscience. His Lordship's motto is very appropriate here, I think.Juror No. 3:\nEverything will be stereoscopic in the future! Absolutely, absolutely everything! And I'm ready for it!Juror No. 4:\nI don't understand it. I can't have left it in there. It's not possible. ...But could I have?Juror No. 5:\nWomen indispensable in society. Stop. Female-centric future awaits. Stop.Juror No. 6:\n'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.'Ryunosuke:\n.........Iris:\nIs something wrong, Runo?Ryunosuke:\nOh...not exactly. It's just... ...I'm fairly sure I recognise these jurors. Almost all of them, in fact...Iris:\nReeeally? Funny coincidences like that do happen from time to time, don't they? But it is quite strange. The jurors are chosen at random from London's six million inhabitants, you know.Ryunosuke:\n...So I've been led to believe. (But something tells me I'm being duped.)Judge:\nVery well. Now, Lord van Zieks... ...the court calls upon the prosecution to introduce the facts of the case.Van Zieks:\nAs you wish, My Lord. Allow me to begin with a word of warning to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury. In short... ...there has never been a more self-evident case of cold-blooded murder.Juror No. 1:\n...!Juror No. 3:\n...!Van Zieks:\nThe victim, Mr Pop Windibank, proprietor of a pawn shop on Baker Street, was shot from behind and died instantly. The prosecution presents this photographic print of the crime scene. As the court will observe, there is a single bullet wound just below the gentleman's left shoulder. The evidence suggests that the bullet pierced the man's heart resulting in near instant death. Moving on to the findings of Scotland Yard's coroner... His report states that the bullet entered the body on a rising diagonal trajectory.Ryunosuke:\nAnd...what's that supposed to tell us?Van Zieks:\nIt means...the victim was likely shot by someone significantly shorter in height than himself. Someone...like the accused, you might say.Juror No. 2:\nOh!Juror No. 5:\n...!Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution wishes to present the autopsy report and crime scene photograph as evidence, My Lord.Judge:\nIndeed. The court accepts. Hand them to the bailiff, please.The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.The crime scene photograph has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks:\nI now ask the court to turn its attention to this plan of the establishment where the incident occurred. The proprietor, was found in the storeroom where he kept articles pawned to him. A windowless room with a single point of entry - a door to the main shop that was found locked. In this 'sealed chamber' there were only two persons present: The victim, Mr Windibank...and the accused.Gina:\n.........Juror No. 4:\n...!Juror No. 6:\n...!Van Zieks:\nIt may further interest the court to know that when the accused was discovered at the scene... ...she had in her hand the gun used to fire the fatal bullet!...Well, that's that then, isn't it? Nothing more to say....Isn't that grubby little girl a pickpocket anyway?...She's one of those filthy drabs that live in the slums in the East End.Oh well, it was only a matter of time before she got blood on her hands, then......What are the jurors waiting for? The girl's guilty as hell!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nWe can't jump to conclusions here! We mustn't assume her guilt because of what she has to do to survive!Van Zieks:\n...My learned Nipponese...friend. It is you who mustn't jump to conclusions. The prosecution has barely begun presenting its case.Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nConveniently, this appalling act of murder... ...did not go unobserved. There were witnesses.Judge:\nGood gracious!Van Zieks:\nAfter their testimony, this girl's true nature will be exposed. Pitiful pickpurse...or cold-hearted killer? Here's to establishing the truth.Gina:\n.........Judge:\nHmmm... The court will take the floor plan and firearm into evidence. Hand them to the bailiff, please, Lord van Zieks.Van Zieks:\n...At once, My Lord.The crime scene floor plan has been entered into the Court Record.Windibank's revolver has been entered into the Court Record.Examine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindibank's Gun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBullet cylinder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThis is Mr Windibank's gun. The cylinder is completely empty.\nIris:\nMr Windibank always used to keep this gun to hand on his shop counter.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, but only ever with a single bullet loaded, I understand.\nIris:\nThat's right. To keep all the pawned articles that were in his care safe.\nRyunosuke:\n(But his one bullet was fired that night, and the poor man lost his life. Was he protecting his shop, I wonder? Trying to keep the articles safe?)\nIris:\n.........Ryunosuke:\n(This isn't good.)Iris:\nI feel like the mood in here has turned very gloomy all of a sudden, Runo.Ryunosuke:\nI think...that's because it has.Van Zieks:\nLet us begin! Bring forth the witnesses to the foul murder of Mr Pop Windibank on 16th April of this year!Van Zieks:\nWitnesses, state your names and occupations for the court.Nash:\nName's Nash Skulkin! Occupation is, erm...baddie. Profeshnal baddie.Ringo:\nName's Ringo Skulkin! Occupation's, um...same as 'im.Gregson:\n...Tobias Gregson. Scotland Yard inspector.Nash:\nThat's right. We're wot they call......the Three Skulkin Bruvvers!.........Gregson:\nWhat are you lookin' at me like that for?! Don't lump me in with you lot!Nash:\nCor blimey, that's cold! Don'tcha know wot we're goin' fru?Ringo:\nIt's our older bruv! Lost contact wiv 'im, we 'ave! So we're scourin' every shady corner o' the capital!Nash:\nAnd then last night, we come across you! The very spit o' the bloke. Ain't that right, Ringo?Ringo:\n'E is, Nash, 'e is! The very spit of 'im!Nash:\nSo we decided there an' then wot we woz gonna do. We woz gonna call ya...Ringo:\n...Big Bruv Sulky!Gregson:\nCome on, leave it out, you two!Ryunosuke:\n(...Sulky Skulkin? And that's before he's run out of chips...)Judge:\nWell then...Inspector Sulky Gregson...Gregson:\nBeggin' your pardon, My Lord, but the name's Tobias.Judge:\nWhat I would like to know, Inspector, is what you are doing in the witness stand.Van Zieks:\nThe Skulkin Brothers are currently under arrest, My Lord, on suspicion of theft.Judge:\nHmph. Thieves, are they, these three?Gregson:\nNo, My Lord. Beggin' your pardon, but please don't lump me in with this lot.Van Zieks:\nTwo nights ago, these two brothers illegally entered an establishment with intent to burgle. And in the course of their nefarious activities, they became embroiled in a far more sinister crime.Judge:\nBy Jove, you mean to say...? What an extraordinary coincidence!Van Zieks:\n...Indeed, My Lord. While attempting to burglarise the pawnbrokery, they witnessed its proprietor's murder.Judge:\nOrdaaar! Orrrdaaar!Van Zieks:\nThe various trespasses of these brothers is not the subject of today's proceedings... ...though they will naturally face trial in the very near future.Gregson:\nWith Your Lordship's permission, I'd like to remain in the stand to keep these gents on the straight and narrow.Judge:\nOf course, Inspector. Sceptical as I am about the calibre of these witnesses, I will permit them to take the stand.Van Zieks:\nMr and Mr Skulkin...you will now testify before the court. Describe the events of the night in question, and what exactly you saw.'Appy to! ...Cos a Skulkin's never skulkin'!Gregson:\n...Get out of it!Witness Testimony\n- Illegal Entry -Nash:\nWe woz walkin' down Baker Street in the small hours, an' the gaff's door was ajar, see?Ringo:\nIt woz like some kinda sign. Beggin' for us to go in, it woz!Nash:\nBut once we got inside, cor blimey lummy! We 'eard a gunshot from the back room!Ringo:\nWe went to see wot woz wot, but the door was locked from the inside.Nash:\nWe never done nuffin', guvnor! We never took nuffin'! We just left after that, nice an' quiet.Judge:\nHmmm... A terrible coincidence, it would seem. At the precise moment these miscreants entered the property, an even more sinister crime was afoot.Van Zieks:\nThe witnesses' testimony is consistent with the crime scene in every detail. The door providing access to the storeroom from the main shop was indeed locked from the inside. And within, only the victim and the accused were found.Judge:\nHmmm... I must say, it does appear to be an overwhelmingly simple case. Still, the defence may cross-examine the witnesses now, of course. Counsel, if you please...Ryunosuke:\n.........Judge:\nCounsel?Ryunosuke:\nAh...erm...yes!Iris:\nWhat's the matter, Runo?Ryunosuke:\nSorry, I... ...I was just stunned into silence for a minute by the blatant lies being told by that pair in the stand.

The place would've been shut at one in the mornin'. Just like every other shop in town.\nNash:\nWell it woz pitch-black inside, it's true. ...Ain't that right, Ringo?\nRingo:\nI'm not so sure, Nash. I seem to remember a little light burnin' inside. Wot about you, Sulky, me old mucker?\nGregson:\n...Leave me alone.\nRyunosuke:\n(There definitely was a small lamp burning inside. That's what alerted us to the situation in the first place.)\nVan Zieks:\nAnd when these gentlemen ventured into the open establishment... ...the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, already had the muzzle of her gun trained on the unfortunate victim.\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThat is pure conjecture!\nJudge:\nHmmm...\nVan Zieks:\nHah, perhaps. But it changes nothing. These brothers inadvertently wandered into the middle of a cold-blooded murder... ...simply because they found the door of the victim's establishment open and ventured inside.\nNash:\nRight!

I can swear to that.\nRingo:\nIt woz, Nash, it woz. ...Ain't that right, Bruv?\nGregson:\n...The firearm used belonged to the victim himself.\nIris:\nYes, Mr Windibank always used to leave his gun lying around on the counter.\nRyunosuke:\nRight. I remember.\nGregson:\nWhen we examined it, we found the revolver was completely out of rounds.\nIris:\nThat makes sense. Mr Windibank always used to say he only ever kept a single bullet loaded.\nRyunosuke:\n(That's true. I remember him saying that as well.)\nJudge:\nSo we can say with considerable certainty... ...that only a single round was discharged from the firearm used as the murder weapon.\nGregson:\nYes, My Lord. We can.\nVan Zieks:\nAnd I should remind the court... ...that the firearm in question was discovered in the hand of the accused.\nJudge:\nHmmm...\nRyunosuke:\n(...Wonderful.)Ringo:\nWe went to see wot woz wot, but the door was locked from the inside.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nDo you mean the door between the main shop and the storeroom?\nVan Zieks:\nIf my learned friend is having difficulty grasping the situation, perhaps a drawing would help. Excluding the shop's entrance from the street, there is only one other door. That of the storeroom.\nNash:\n'Course there woz only a little oil lamp burnin'. Not much to see by.\nRingo:\nAn' the door woz 'idden be'ind a curtain an' all.\nRyunosuke:\n(That's right. When we arrived, the door was mostly obscured by the curtain.) Tell me... ...why exactly did you try to open that door?\nRingo:\nEh?\nRyunosuke:\nAny normal petty thief would run at the sound of a gunshot, I should think.\nNash:\nOh, well, erm...your turn to rabbit, Ringo.\nRingo:\nWell, Nash, erm...yeah... ...I s'pose...you'd 'ave to say we ain't 'normal', eh?\nVan Zieks:\nBroadly speaking, humans respond in one of two ways on hearing a gunshot or scream: The timid flee, gripped by fear, while the courageous investigate to see if they might help. These gentlemen are of the latter inclination. My learned Nipponese friend, it would seem, is of the former.\nRyunosuke:\n(Alright... Somehow I just proved that I was a coward that night...)\nJudge:\nThank you, Counsels... So, I believe we all understand that the door was locked and could not be opened.

Come again...?Ryunosuke:\nAs you fled from the pawnbroker's that night... ...did you not run into anyone else?Nash:\nUm...Ryunosuke:\nAnd...did you not fire a gun at that person?!Ringo:\nErm...Judge:\nSaints alive! They fired a gun, you say?Nash:\nAAAAAAGH!!! Blimey, guvnor!Ringo:\nYou ain't tellin' us it woz you in the doorway?!Ryunosuke:\nIt was.Ringo:\n......... Why the bleedin' Nora...Nash:\n...Didn't ya mention that before?!Ryunosuke:\nYou were armed with a gun. And as you fled the scene, you fired that gun... ...at London's greatest detective, Herlock Sholmes!They shot the great Mr Sholmes?\nI did hear that, actually. There was a rumour he'd been rushed to hospital....The great Sholmes? That's beyond the pale!Van Zieks:\nOn the night in question... ...this pair were arrested by the police within minutes of the discovery of the crime scene. ...Their suspicious countenance rapidly gave them away.Ringo:\nHehe...Van Zieks:\nAnd when searched... ...a firearm was indeed found in their possession.Juror No. 1:\n...!Juror No. 2:\n...!Van Zieks:\nFurthermore, the barrel shows signs of a shot having been fired from it.Juror No. 3:\n...!Juror No. 4:\n...!Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution invites His Lordship to examine the firearm recovered from these brothers.Judge:\nYes, indeed... Remnants of powder around the muzzle, as you say, Counsel.Juror No. 5:\n...!Juror No. 6:\n...!Judge:\nThe court will hold this weapon as evidence.The Skulkin brothers' gun has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks:\nNow, my learned Nipponese friend...Examine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkulkin Brothers' Gun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBullet cylinder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo, there's ammunition still loaded in five of this revolver's six cylinders.\nIris:\nYes, which tell us that only a single shot has been fired from it.\nRyunosuke:\nExactly.\nIris:\nThe bullet that hit Hurley in fact, isn't it?\nRyunosuke:\nYes... It happened almost as soon as we'd walked in through Windibank's door.\nIris:\n......... I'll make those brothers pay.Ryunosuke:\nY-Yes?Van Zieks:\nHere's to you successfully presenting the evidence.Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nFor yes, there are the telltale signs of spent powder on this gun, and a single bullet missing from the cylinder... ...but the prosecution demands evidence that it was fired at the scene of the crime under scrutiny in this trial!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nWell, I don't need evidence! Because I was there!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\n...However, the rest of us in this courtroom were not.Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nIf the defence fails to provide evidence in support of its rash claim... ...we shall have no choice but to toast your incompetence...and move on.Ryunosuke:\n(Evidence that these two fired that gun before they left Windibank's that night...)Judge:\nThe court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof. What evidence shows that these witnesses unloaded a firearm in the pawnbroker's shop that night?Present Blood Samples Portfolio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The evidence...is in this portfolio!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe evidence...is this!\nJudge:\n...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.\nRyunosuke:\nAh.\nVan Zieks:\nMy learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer.\nRyunosuke:\nAAARGH!\nIris:\nWell...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally.\nRyunosuke:\nThe kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...)\nLeads back to:\n\"The court demands that all claims are affirmed with clear proof.\"Ryunosuke:\nThe evidence...is in this portfolio!Judge:\nWhat, what on earth have you there, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\nDuring the course of our investigations, we discovered a number of bloodstains.Van Zieks:\n...Not trusting the police to do the job they're trained to do? How arrogantly Nipponese of you.Ryunosuke:\nW-Well anyway... ...we analysed all the blood samples we found and recorded the results in this portfolio.Judge:\nAnd you claim to have the evidence the court is demanding therein?Ryunosuke:\nYes, My Lord.Judge:\nNo more dallying then, Counsel. Present the pertinent evidence at once! What do you have in your portfolio that proves these witnesses unloaded a firearm at the scene?Present Windibank's Main Shop sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What is that? Explain!\"Present any other sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nTHIS is the blood sample that proves it!\nJudge:\n...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.\nRyunosuke:\nAh.\nVan Zieks:\nYou would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen.\nRyunosuke:\nAAARGH!\nIris:\nWell...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally.\nRyunosuke:\nThe kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...)\nLeads back to:\n\"No more dallying then, Counsel.\"Judge:\nWhat is that? Explain!Ryunosuke:\nIt's a photographic print taken at Windibank's pawnbrokery on the day of the incident.Judge:\nFrom the scene of the crime, is it? Is, is that... ...a bullet hole? And if my eyes do not deceive me, it appears the bullet is still lodged there.Ryunosuke:\nYes, as Your Lordship noticed... ...the bullet pierced Mr Windibank's calendar. The date shown being the 16th of April - the very day of the pawnbroker's death.Judge:\nThe incident occurred at one hour after midnight. But this indicates that a separate shot had been fired sometime after the calendar had been set to the 16th!Ryunosuke:\nThat's right. And while it isn't irrefutable, the defence believes... ...this is credible evidence that the witnesses did fire a round from their gun in the pawnbroker's that night!Nash:\nNAAAAAAAAAH!!!Judge:\nOrdaaar! ...How does the prosecution stand, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks:\n......... If that is the direction my learned friend wishes to take, the prosecution has no objection.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?Van Zieks:\nBut you'll forgive me for flinging my hallowed chalice aside in disgust at the repugnancy it exposes. Yes. On the night in question, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery illegally... ...and like the bold 'baddies' they claim to be, opened fire on the new arrivals before fleeing back onto the street!Nash:\nEEEEEEH?! Take it easy there, guvnor! Yer gonna land us in the soup!Ringo:\nWe 'ad a deal! You weren't gonna get into them...details. Tell 'im, Sulky! Set the bloke straight!Gregson:\n...I have nothin' to add.Ryunosuke:\n(So he knew, did he? Van Zieks knew their testimony would almost certainly expose the extent of their crimes.)Van Zieks:\nIt would seem now... ...that I owe my learned Nipponese friend a word of gratitude.Ryunosuke:\nWhat do you mean?Van Zieks:\nWhat I mean...is that you have helpfully confirmed an important fact.Judge:\nTo what fact do you refer, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks:\nAs has been established, at the point of their arrest, a single shot had been fired from the brothers' gun. However, if that shot found its target in Mr Sholmes... ...then clearly these witnesses cannot be accused of the fatal shooting of the proprietor and victim.Ryunosuke:\nAgh!Van Zieks:\nIn other words...these two men... ...have no material connection to the murder of Mr Windibank at all!Ryunosuke:\n...! (So that's it...)Nash:\nThat's it! We didn't 'ave nuffin' to do wiv it!Ringo:\nWe didn't, Nash, we didn't! That's wot I reckon!Van Zieks:\nYour crimes include unlawful entry, intent to steal, perjury and - let us not forget - attempted murder.Gregson:\nQuite a catalogue, eh, fellas?Nash:\nAh...Ringo:\nWe're in for it now, bruv...Van Zieks:\nNow then... ...let us take a moment to consider the aforementioned 'great detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes. It would seem the man patronised the pawnbroker's in question somewhat regularly.Ryunosuke:\n(Where's he going with this?)Van Zieks:\nMr Sholmes appears to take pleasure in tinkering with eccentric machinery.Iris:\n'Eccentric'? Says who?!Ryunosuke:\n...Not me. Don't give me that look!Van Zieks:\nHe installed a pair of machines like this one in the victim's shop.Iris:\nOh! That's one of Hurley's 'Red-Handed Recorders'!Judge:\nWhat is that, Counsel? It has the appearance of a photographic contraption.Van Zieks:\nAs Your Lordship has surmised, it is indeed a camera attached to a small timing device.Ryunosuke:\nEvery half an hour, it automatically photographs the interior of the establishment. The idea being that if a thief were to break in to the shop, he would be caught red-handed.Judge:\nHmmm...Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution has obtained the photographs taken by the device on the night in question. As the court will observe, copious identical prints are produced in a quite desultory fashion.Judge:\nHmph, rather prodigal, I feel.Van Zieks:\nIn fact there are two such devices in the victim's shop, My Lord. If I may refer the court to the plan of the premises, their respective positions are here...and here.Judge:\nYou say these cameras produce a print every half hour. I'm afraid I fail to see... ...how that would help if the anticipated thief conducted his activities in one of the many thirty-minute intervals.Van Zieks:\nOne can only pray that the would-be criminal lingers, My Lord.Judge:\nHmmm...Van Zieks:\nOn the night in question, the witnesses currently in the stand were not caught on camera.Nash:\nHehe, that's a bit o' Friar Tuck, eh, bruv?Ringo:\nLady Luck luvs a Skulkin!Judge:\nWitnesses, at what time did your trespassing begin?Nash:\nEh? ...Must've been just after one. ...Right, bruv?Ringo:\nMust've been, Nash, must've been. Yeah, just gone one.Van Zieks:\nIn which case, minutes before these brothers entered the establishment... ...what scene might we expect to see within the shop? Let us examine the evidence...Judge:\nGood Lord! It's...it's the defendant! Miss Gina Lestrade!Van Zieks:\nAs the court can clearly see... ...the accused is pictured, gun in hand, facing the victim over the shop counter. No doubt coercing the proprietor to open the door to his storeroom.Judge:\nQuite! One can only too easily imagine the events that unfolded. The court will take this photographic print as evidence, if you please, Counsel.The photograph of Gina has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke:\nUgh...Iris:\nI, I don't believe it! Ginny...Van Zieks:\nIn short... ...the accused is the only person who could possibly have killed Mr Windibank.Ryunosuke:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!???:I say, My Lord...Juror No. 1:\nWonder if I might put in a word at this point.Judge:\nGo ahead, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1:\nTook a bally bullet to the knee in the Battle of Maiwand, 1880, don't you know. Decorated for it and all that, but forced to retire from service, sadly. 'Course, a medal can never outshine the exploits of chaps like us on the battlefield.Judge:\nYes, Mr Foreman, and...? What exactly is your point?Juror No. 1:\nCarried on the battle after retirement, you see. The battle of daily life, if you like. And here I am now, leading this small squadron. Six men, all good and true. And we'll all go down together, you mark my words! One for all...and all for one!Van Zieks:\n...The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have reached agreement, have they? Is that what we are to understand?Judge:\nWell, Mr Foreman? Is that correct?Juror No. 1:\n......... In a manner of speaking...yes. That is the Garrideb Squadron's position, sir!Ryunosuke:\nWhat?! No! It's too soon to make a judgement here!Juror No. 1:\nStatus report for the court, men! On the double!Juror No. 2:\nHis Lordship insists on promptitude at all times. And that goes for making decisions, too.Juror No. 3:\nI think you'll find the truth is as clear as day now! I could reach out and touch it!Juror No. 4:\nI wouldn't have left it in there. I just wouldn't. But in all honesty, I can't actually remember...Juror No. 5:\nSituation clear. Stop. No room for doubt. Stop. Truth now undeniable. Stop.Juror No. 6:\nI am wery sorry for brothers. They are unlucky.Judge:\nVery well... ...I now call upon each member of the jury to state his or her leaning in this matter. Announce your considered verdicts to the court!Juror No. 1:\nGuilty!Juror No. 2:\nGuilty!Juror No. 3:\nGuilty!Juror No. 4:\nGuilty!Juror No. 5:\nGuilty!Juror No. 6:\nGuilty!Judge:\nIt does indeed appear that the jury is unanimous in its leaning already.Ryunosuke:\n(That photograph... It must be the definitive evidence that Gregson mentioned!)Iris:\nBut Ginny didn't shoot him!Ryunosuke:\nNo, of course not! My Lord! The defence wishes to assert its right to a summation examination!Judge:\nVery well. The court grants permission.Van Zieks:\nSo...you refuse to admit defeat again. How...unsurprising.Judge:\nWe shall proceed immediately with the summation examination. Mr Foreman, are all members of the jury ready?Juror No. 1:\nAbso-bally-lutely, sir! Always ready for action, my chaps!Judge:\n...Very good. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have determined the defendant to be guilty!Judicial Findings\n- The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1:\nAll the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.Juror No. 2:\nAs a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.Juror No. 3:\nI think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.Juror No. 4:\nIf I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...Juror No. 5:\nMind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.Juror No. 6:\nIn motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.Judge:\nHmmm... The circumstance of the crime and the evidence do indeed implicate the defendant rather comprehensively.Van Zieks:\nThe storeroom, locked from the inside, in which the victim and the accused were discovered alone. And in the accused's hand, the fatal revolver, the firing of which was heard by these witnesses.Juror No. 1:\nNot to mention this print! Take it from a chap whose [sic] seen action on the battlefield: That young girl's on the verge of pulling the bally trigger!Ryunosuke:\n(...Thanks a lot, Mr Sholmes.)Iris:\nOh dear... Hurley's cameras were supposed to help, not hinder.Judge:\nI'm afraid I think you have an uphill struggle ahead of you.Ryunosuke:\n(But Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank. Which means there's more to this situation that we've yet to see.)Iris:\nAgreed!Judge:\nYou have the floor, Counsel. Proceed with the summation examination!Jury Examination\n- The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1:\nAll the evidence clearly points the finger of guilt at this young pickpocketienne.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou're Mr Natsume's landlord, Mr Garrideb...aren't you? We really must stop meeting like this.\nJuror No. 1:\n......... Ah, you're that lawyer chap. Well, there's a turn-up for the books! Yes, rather a turbulent time we had back then.\nRyunosuke:\nSome extraordinary events took place at your house, that's for sure. Luckily Mr Sholmes and I were able to get to the bottom of it all.\nJuror No. 1:\n...!\nRyunosuke:\nI think we did rather a lot for you, didn't we?\nJuror No. 1:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nI mean, obviously... ...I wouldn't be suggesting that therefore you should change your leaning to not guilty or anything!\nJuror No. 1:\n......... Hmph. Can't be denied, I suppose. The 'curse of the Garrideb house' was the talk of the town after that business. Lodgers moved out, and I couldn't get a bally soul to take up the tenancies.\nRyunosuke:\nOh.\nJuror No. 1:\nHaven't had the heart to break the news to Joanie yet. Bad enough that the old girl's clapped up. Yes, can't be denied...you did do rather a lot. But not for us, that's for dashed certain.\nRyunosuke:\nI suppose not...\nJuror No. 1:\n'Course... ...there can be no suggestion of that being the reason I'm leaning towards guilty here, obviously.\nRyunosuke:\n(...Obviously. But honestly... ...I really wish he'd pay more attention to the trial, and less to juror number two.)Juror No. 2:\nAs a housemaid, I should like to see all filthy eyesores promptly and rigorously eliminated.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\n...Polishing the bench, I see...again.\nJuror No. 2:\nA maid's work is never done. Not a blemish must remain.\nRyunosuke:\nUm, what exactly do you mean by 'filthy eyesores'?\nJuror No. 2:\nOn my way to market for His Lordship, I have to pass through the East End. The place is full of beggars, pickpurses and crossmen. The scum of the earth!\nRyunosuke:\n...A little harsh, perhaps.\nJuror No. 2:\nLet me be plain... If it were up to me, all those back slums would be made spick and span or eradicated. At least we have people like the great detective working to achieve these important goals.\nRyunosuke:\nYou're referring to Mr Herlock Sholmes?\nJuror No. 2:\nThat's right. I like to keep abreast of his exploits by reading Randst Magazine in between my duties. He does wonders, cleaning up London's streets. In my opinion, he should be declared an honorary maid of the capital.\nRyunosuke:\n...Mr Sholmes? ...A maid?\nJuror No. 2:\nIt's really quite unforgivable... Gutter scum having the audacity to shoot our very greatest detective!\nRyunosuke:\n......... Minor detail: It was the two brothers in the stand who shot Mr Sholmes, not the defendant.\nJuror No. 2:\nA minor detail indeed. They're all gutter scum as far as I'm concerned!\nRyunosuke:\nWeeell...it just might be an idea to get our facts straight anyway...\nJuror No. 2:\n...Yes, alright. I shall amend my statement.\nChanges Juror No. 2's statement to \"Those brothers are the scum of the earth! They should swing for shooting the great detective!\"Juror No. 2:\nThose brothers are the scum of the earth! They should swing for shooting the great detective!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nI agree with you. The shooting of Mr Sholmes was an unforgivable act. But the purpose of this trial is to determine who shot the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank.\nJuror No. 2:\n...I'm afraid you're splitting hairs, sir.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nJuror No. 2:\nWhether it was the thieves or the pickpurse... ...it was still gutter trash that shot the pawnbroker in the end. Filth that should be cleaned up and eradicated...in my considered opinion.\nRyunosuke:\n(Thanks so much for sharing. ...Changing this maid's mind isn't going to be easy.)\nIris:\nRuno... ...it was one of those two brothers that shot Hurley, wasn't it?\nRyunosuke:\nYes. Without question.\nIris:\nWell then I'll never forgive them!\nRyunosuke:\nOh, Iris...\nIris:\nPerhaps we can use this maid's statement to help us somehow, do you think?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, maybe. Let's listen carefully to what each juror has to say first...Pit against Juror No. 6's statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThose two statements clearly contradict each other!\nJudge:\nGood Lord! Counsel, explain yourself!\nJuror No.2:\nOh my! My statement? Contradictory?\nJuror No. 6:\nContradict... C-o-n...\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick.\nJuror No. 6:\n...I do not have stick. I have mouse.\nRyunosuke:\nAs juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver.\nJuror No. 2:\nYes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand!\nRyunosuke:\n...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear?\nJuror No. 6:\n......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d...\nRyunosuke:\n...Sir?\nJuror No. 6:\nSorry, sorry. My English is still learning.\nRyunosuke:\n...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear?\nJuror No. 6:\n......... Forgive me. I did not hear.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...\nJuror No. 6:\n...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker.\nRyunosuke:\n(...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!)\nJuror No. 6:\nSo... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative.\nRyunosuke:\nYes! That's exactly right!\nJuror No. 6:\nLying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal!\nRyunosuke:\n...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced.\nJuror No. 6:\nThis means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?!\nRyunosuke:\nWell...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so...\nJuror No. 6:\nEnough! I trust no one now!\nRyunosuke:\n...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir.\nJuror No. 6:\nI must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself!\nRyunosuke:\nI'm afraid that won't be poss-\nIris:\nYes it is, Runo! Easily!\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nIris:\nWith the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder!\nRyunosuke:\nAh...\nIris:\nIf you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor!\nVan Zieks:\nTut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight.\nIris:\nSo this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken.\nRyunosuke:\n(That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.)\nJuror No. 6:\nSo, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing.\nRyunosuke:\nIt would seem so, yes.\nJuror No. 6:\nGood.\nRyunosuke:\nNo, not good.\nJuror No. 6:\nYou were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial.\nIris:\nYay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting!\nRyunosuke:\nWell...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still!\nJudge:\nThank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence.\nThe post-shooting photograph has been entered into the Court Record.\nRyunosuke:\n(Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...)\nChanges Juror No. 6's statement to \"In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.\"Juror No. 3:\nI think you'll find that if you look at that photograph in stereo, the truth will just pop out.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWhat do you mean, 'look at the photograph in stereo'?\nJuror No. 3:\nSorry? What? Don't, don't you know? If you look at the photographic print normally... ...it looks as though the pickpocket girl is about to shoot the victim, obviously.\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBut there's no indication that the defendant ever fired the gun!\nJuror No. 3:\nAll I'm saying is that if you look at the same print in stereo, it could reveal all sorts of new information.\nRyunosuke:\n......... By any chance... ...are you a fan of stereoscopes?\nJuror No. 3:\nOoooooh! How did you know?!\nRyunosuke:\n...Let's call it a lucky guess.\nJuror No. 3:\nIt never gets old, seeing the two prints merge into one before your eyes! It's extraordinary! It's captivating! It's the height of modernity!\nRyunosuke:\n...Of course.\nJuror No. 3:\nOh yes! I think you'll find that the stereoscope is here to stay! Giving us new perspectives we could only dream of before, it's the greatest invention the world has ever seen!\nRyunosuke:\n(...If only it could give me a new perspective on this case, I might agree with you.)Juror No. 3:\nAll we'd need is another shot from a slightly different location, and we could see the scene in three dimensions!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nCan it really show up new clues, though?\nJuror No. 3:\nDon't know unless you try!\nRyunosuke:\nHow about this print here? It should do the trick, I think.\n\n\n\nPresent Photograph of Gina or Post-Shooting Photograph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nAlright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints?\nJuror No. 3:\nOf course I can!\nRyunosuke:\nVery well then...I'd like you to demonstrate.\nJuror No. 3:\nI'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all!\n\n\n\nPresent Post-Shooting Photograph or Photograph of Gina (whichever has not been presented yet)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWait, sorry? What do you mean, one more print?\nJuror No. 3:\nOh dear, oh dear... Don't you have these in the Far East? Don't you know how a stereoscope works?\nIris:\nRuno!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nIris:\nYou need two photographs for a stereoscope, remember? You know, one for the left eye, and one for the right.\nRyunosuke:\nOh, oh yes. I remember now. But the print we have from the pawnbrokery is just a normal photograph.\nJuror No. 3:\nNo no no. I think you'll find... ...that the clue is in the name. It's a stereoscope, not a monoscope! You always need two prints!\nRyunosuke:\n(...Thanks for the friendly explanation.)\nIris:\nHmmm... Well, if we obtain another print at some point later in the trial... ...we can always show it to this young man then.\nJuror No. 3:\nHahaha!\nRyunosuke:\n(I think you'll find...that know-it-all expression is really starting to annoy me.)\nJudge:\nLet's get things back on track, shall we, Counsel?\nLeads back to summation examination\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...I was wrong. I can't actually think of anything we could use at all.\nIris:\nWhat? Really? Oh dear, I think maybe I need to have a stereoscopic look at your brain sometime.\nRyunosuke:\n(...What's that supposed to mean?)\nLeads back to summation examinationJuror No. 4:\nIf I have left it in there, I should think there'll be repercussions by now...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nUm, what exactly have you been muttering about all this time, sir? You keep talking about having left something somewhere or something like that.\nJuror No. 4:\nAh...so sorry. As you can probably tell, I'm a surgeon.\nRyunosuke:\nA surgeon?! (That totally passed me by...)\nJuror No. 4:\nOf course, people conducting surgery in this country aren't considered to be doctors. Oh no! Even though me and my kind are at the forefront of medical science! The real brains in the field!\nRyunosuke:\nSo...what is it that you think you've left behind?\nJuror No. 4:\nAh well, that's...a little embarrassing, to be honest. You see I was operating on someone yesterday. Standard thing - went in through the abdomen. But when I'd finished the procedure, I... Well, I couldn't find my scalpel anywhere.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! (Did he...? Surely not!)\nJuror No. 4:\nExactly! 'Surely not!' you say to yourself, don't you? Worrying, isn't it? That's what's been troubling me this whole time. Could I really have left my scalpel inside the fellow's belly? ...No, of course I couldn't! So...there you have it. Like I said, a little embarrassing, really.\nRyunosuke:\n...That's one way of putting it. The other is manslaughter.\nJuror No. 4:\nThat's exactly my concern! And seeing as this case appears to be all but sewn up... ...I need to focus on trying to remember exactly what I've sewn up elsewhere! Now...I'm sure I made sure everything was back as it should be. Well, as sure as you can be without being sure.\nRyunosuke:\n(...I'm sure you need to be more sure.)Juror No. 5:\nMind made up. Stop. Global radio transmission of verdict to follow. Stop.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nSorry, 'radio transmission'? What do you mean?\nJuror No. 5:\n...Are you from the Far East? Stop.\nRyunosuke:\nUm, yes. From the Empire of Japan.\nJuror No. 5:\nAll communication with Far Eastern nations used to take place by mail. Royal Mail steamers take more than a month to complete the journey.\nIris:\nAh, but now we have the electric telegram. So we can send messages using electrical signals. Thousands of miles of cables have been laid along the ocean beds, connecting the entire world.\nRyunosuke:\nThousands of miles of cable? ...On the ocean bed? (It makes my head hurt just thinking about it.)\nJuror No. 5:\nYou are well informed, young lady.\nIris:\nHehe!\nJuror No. 5:\nBut cables will soon become a thing of the past. Stop.\nRyunosuke:\n...And just when I was starting to catch up.\nJuror No. 5:\nRadio transmission is the future. Stop. Messages carried over airwaves to four corners of globe. Stop. Excitement growing! Stop. Atmosphere electric! Stop.\nRyunosuke:\nRight... (...Try not to wear out your fingers.)\nJuror No. 5:\nEra of wireless telegraphy! Stop. Driving technological revolution! Stop. And people say inventions like the stereoscope are the height of technology! What utter piffle! I can't understand it. I really can't. They're just silly toys!\n\n\n\nPursue Juror No. 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nErm, juror number three...sorry to interrupt when you're obviously fuming, but...\nJuror No. 3:\nWhat?!\nRyunosuke:\nDo you perhaps have something to say about juror number five's last remark? ...As if I couldn't guess.\nJuror No. 3:\nOh, you bet I do! Say that again! Go on! I dare you!\nJuror No. 5:\nGoodness! Are you talking to me?\nRyunosuke:\n...I think he just might be, yes.\nJuror No. 3:\nYou think stereoscopes are just toys, do you? Huh?\nJuror No. 5:\nAbsolutely. I mean, really! A machine to view photographs in three dimensions? Why on earth would you not just use your eyes to look at the world around you? It's all three-dimensional!\nRyunosuke:\n...What a great way to appease the man.\nJuror No. 5:\nNo, I'm sorry. Stereoscopes are of no practical use at all.\nJuror No. 3:\n......... You just don't know!\nJuror No. 5:\nPardon?\nJuror No. 3:\nI think you'll find that viewing a photograph through a stereoscope... ...can unlock all sorts of possibilities! I'm obviously going to have to demonstrate!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat sort of possibilities?\nJuror No. 3:\nWell, take a crime scene, for example. If you had a pair of photographs from a crime scene that you could view through a stereoscope... ...it could reveal hidden clues you'd never even noticed before!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?!\nIris:\nHave you got any, Runo? Any prints we could look at with a stereoscope?\n\n\n\nAbsolutely!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nHow about this print here? It should do the trick, I think.\n\n\n\nPresent Photograph of Gina or Post-Shooting Photograph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nAlright then, juror number three... ...are you saying you can do this with any two suitable photographic prints?\nJuror No. 3:\nOf course I can!\nRyunosuke:\nVery well then...I'd like you to demonstrate.\nJuror No. 3:\nI'd be delighted to! Just give me one more print and I'll amaze you all!\n\n\n\nPresent Post-Shooting Photograph or Photograph of Gina (whichever has not yet been presented)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Alright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWait, sorry? What do you mean, one more print?\nJuror No. 3:\nOh dear, oh dear... Don't you have these in the Far East? Don't you know how a stereoscope works?\nIris:\nRuno!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nIris:\nYou need two photographs for a stereoscope, remember? You know, one for the left eye, and one for the right.\nRyunosuke:\nOh, oh yes. I remember now. But the print we have from the pawnbrokery is just a normal photograph.\nJuror No. 3:\nNo no no. I think you'll find... ...that the clue is in the name. It's a stereoscope, not a monoscope! You always need two prints!\nRyunosuke:\n(...Thanks for the friendly explanation.)\nIris:\nHmmm... Well, if we obtain another print at some point later in the trial... ...we can always show it to this young man then.\nJuror No. 3:\nHahaha!\nRyunosuke:\n(I think you'll find...that know-it-all expression is really starting to annoy me.)\nJudge:\nLet's get things back on track, shall we, Counsel?\nChanges Juror No. 3's statement to \"All we'd need is another shot from a slightly different location, and we could see the scene in three dimensions!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...I was wrong. I can't actually think of anything we could use at all.\nIris:\nWhat? Really? Oh dear, I think maybe I need to have a stereoscopic look at your brain sometime.\nRyunosuke:\n(...What's that supposed to mean?)\nLeads back to summation examination\n\n\n\n\n\nNone spring to mind\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...no, I don't think so. None spring to mind, anyway.\nIris:\nWell if you find any, we should definitely try it!\nRyunosuke:\n...I don't think we're just going to find prints of the crime scene lying around, you know. (But I suppose if we somehow find ourselves with some, it would be worth a go...)\nLeads back to summation examination\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n...Don't spare any feelings, will you? It's not like there's anyone here who likes stereoscopes... So...why exactly do you think that the defendant is guilty?\nJuror No. 5:\nIt's quite simple... We haven't been shown a scrap of evidence to suggest that she isn't the culprit. And just as radio waves dash through the skies faster than the eye can see... ...so we should dash to the conclusion of this trial, and stop pandering to in-dit-cision!Juror No. 6:\nIn motherland we say never judge by clothes, judge by head. I am conwinced brothers are innocent.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nPlease tell me you're not Vilen Borshevik... ...the Russian revolutionary.\nJuror No. 5:\nRe-Revolutionary?!\nJuror No. 6:\n......... Da. I believe there is such a rumour.\nRyunosuke:\n...It's just a rumour?\nJuror No. 6:\nAs you see, I have unfortunate appearance. I look like wicious criminal.\nRyunosuke:\n(...Your words, not mine. Just want to point that out.)\nJuror No. 6:\nPeople call me revolutionary...murderer...autocrat...\nJuror No. 5:\nAnd...which glove fits?\nJuror No. 6:\n'Good day. I am wisiting London for sightseeing. I would like to take bus to Crystal Tower, please.'\nJuror No. 5:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n(Right. That didn't sound staged at all. You'll forgive me for having my doubts.)\nJuror No. 6:\nTo be treated like wicious criminal all the time... It is wery painful. People do not realise. So I have much sympathies for these brothers. People say they are criminals only because of how they look.\nRyunosuke:\nThe Skulkin brothers?\nJuror No. 6:\nDa, maybe they went inside pawnbroker's shop. But they have done nothing wrong. That is all what I want to say!\nRyunosuke:\n...The Skulkin brothers did nothing wrong that night? (Alright, well first of all... ...that's one not-so-little misunderstanding I'll need to clear up straight away.) Tell me something, Iris...\nIris:\nHm? What is it, Runo?\nRyunosuke:\nThe jurors are chosen at random from the inhabitants of London town, aren't they?\nIris:\nYes! It's amazing, isn't it?\nRyunosuke:\nIn that case... ...how is it that there's a Russian tourist sitting among them, who looks for all the world like a revolutionary?\nIris:\n...I wish I knew.Pit against Juror No. 2's statement (after Juror No. 2 changes her statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThose two statements clearly contradict each other!\nJudge:\nGood Lord! Counsel, explain yourself!\nJuror No.2:\nOh my! My statement? Contradictory?\nJuror No. 6:\nContradict... C-o-n...\nRyunosuke:\nJuror number six, you've got the wrong end of the stick.\nJuror No. 6:\n...I do not have stick. I have mouse.\nRyunosuke:\nAs juror number two said earlier... ...when the Skulkin brothers fled the scene on the night in question, they fired a shot from their revolver.\nJuror No. 2:\nYes, they shot poor Mr Sholmes in the abdomen, I understand!\nRyunosuke:\n...Surely you're not going to tell the court now that you didn't hear?\nJuror No. 6:\n......... Abdomen... Abdomen... A-b-d...\nRyunosuke:\n...Sir?\nJuror No. 6:\nSorry, sorry. My English is still learning.\nRyunosuke:\n...You ARE telling the court you didn't hear?\nJuror No. 6:\n......... Forgive me. I did not hear.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...\nJuror No. 6:\n...Ah! Here is word! 'Abdomen: Part of person's body containing stomach and other wital organs'. If this is what you mean, you should say in plain English. I am Russian, not native speaker.\nRyunosuke:\n(...Who thought it was a good idea to let this man be on the jury again?!)\nJuror No. 6:\nSo... ...you are telling me these brothers who look like criminals were lying? They said before, 'We never done nothing,' but truth is, they shot detective. ...Da. This is double negative.\nRyunosuke:\nYes! That's exactly right!\nJuror No. 6:\nLying is wrong! Especially when lie is said by person who looks like criminal!\nRyunosuke:\n...Coming from you, that seems...surprisingly prejudiced.\nJuror No. 6:\nThis means... ...when they said, 'We never took nothing,' maybe it was also big, fat lie! Is this true?!\nRyunosuke:\nWell...according to the police report, no stolen goods were found, so...\nJuror No. 6:\nEnough! I trust no one now!\nRyunosuke:\n...It's...not the mouse's fault though, sir.\nJuror No. 6:\nI must see with own eyes! I must investigate crime scene myself!\nRyunosuke:\nI'm afraid that won't be poss-\nIris:\nYes it is, Runo! Easily!\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nIris:\nWith the prints from Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder!\nRyunosuke:\nAh...\nIris:\nIf you compare the print that pictures Ginny, and the next print from half an hour later... ...you'll be able to see straight away if anything was taken or not. Cooey! Mr Prosecutor!\nVan Zieks:\nTut-tut... Calling on the prosecution in the middle of a summation examination of all times... The print showing the accused threatening the victim after she broke into the shop...is this one. Following this, the victim and the accused moved into the storeroom. Meanwhile, the Skulkin brothers entered the shop and summarily heard the fatal gunshot ring out. Sadly, none of these events were captured on film. This is the print produced by the camera half an hour later, after the brothers' flight.\nIris:\nSo this was taken after Hurley was shot, then. As far as I can tell... ...nothing has been taken.\nRyunosuke:\n(That does seem to be the case. I can't notice anything that's obviously missing in the second print.)\nJuror No. 6:\nSo, the brothers who look like criminals told only one lie. They shot man, but they stole nothing.\nRyunosuke:\nIt would seem so, yes.\nJuror No. 6:\nGood.\nRyunosuke:\nNo, not good.\nJuror No. 6:\nYou were right, I did not understood situation. Now I know brothers have lied, I think it is wery important to continue with trial.\nIris:\nYay! Well done, Runo! The balance is shifting!\nRyunosuke:\nWell...it's a start, I suppose. But there must be more in what these jurors are saying that I can use to expose the truth. And if I can do that, we just might turn the situation to our favour still!\nJudge:\nThank you, Counsel. Continue with the summation examination. And kindly hand that new photographic print to the bailiff to be filed as evidence.\nThe post-shooting photograph has been entered into the Court Record.\nRyunosuke:\n(Another print in the Court Record... I wonder if we can make use of that...)\nChanges Juror No. 6's statement to \"In lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.\"Juror No. 6:\nIn lake of lies are many dead fish. We must find truth. Therefore I say not guilty verdict.Ryunosuke:\n(If I can't change the minds of more than half of these six jurors... ...the trial will be over.)Iris:\nBut we know that Ginny would never shoot anyone.Ryunosuke:\nYes, so we need to find contradictions in what these jurors are saying and pit them against each other. (I must be ready to go to whatever lengths I have to... to convince them of Gina's innocence!)Ryunosuke:\nAlright, these two prints were both taken with the same camera in Windibank's on the night in question.Juror No. 3:\nYes, I see. Tell me, Mr, um...lawyer. Do you know how stereographic images work? Do you understand the principle?Ryunosuke:\nWell...I think so... (I did have a lesson only yesterday...) The left and right eye images need to be the same, only with a slight shift in the positions of some objects. Then when your brain merges the two images together inside your head, it notices the shift as if it were depth.Juror No. 3:\nYes, exactly.Iris:\nIt's that small shift between certain objects in the two pictures that's really important.Ryunosuke:\nSo what happens if you use two photographs that are exactly the same, then?Juror No. 3:\nNo no, obviously that wouldn't work at all. Not for seeing the scene three-dimensionally, anyway.Iris:\nOh... OOOOOOH! Of course! Now I see!Juror No. 3:\nAh! I think the young girl has discovered the secret!Iris:\nI have, I have!Ryunosuke:\n...Can you uncross your eyes before you tell me?Iris:\nHave another look at these two pictures from Hurley's camera, Runo! Go on! Can you see that there's a really obvious difference between them?Ryunosuke:\nOf course there is! There are two people in the first, and no people in the second!Iris:\nWell yes, you can see that straight away. But now... ...try looking at the pictures in three dimensions!Ryunosuke:\nAlright, I'll, I'll give it a go. (So, to start with... ...you have to cross your eyes, and then try to make the two pictures overlap exactly.) ........................... (Let's see if by crossing my eyes I can make the quill pens from each picture overlap in the middle...) ........................... (...Wait...)Iris:\nWell? Did you manage to see it properly, Runo?Not really...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nI'm just not very good at this, that's the trouble.\nIris:\nOh, don't worry. I have just the thing! I happened to bring with me...a portable stereoscope!\nRyunosuke:\n......... I know I mentioned this yesterday, but if you've had that contraption with you from the outset... ...you could have saved me staring at Mr Windibank and Gina like I hate them all that time!\nIris:\nAnd if you remember, I said in reply... ...that it's much more satisfying to be able to see the effect with your own eyes. Anyway, why don't we try using this helpful little aid now? Here goes...\nRyunosuke:\n........................... (Now, let's see what we've got... ...Wait! Look at that!) \nLeads to:\n\"Agh!\"Yes, I saw it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Agh!\"Ryunosuke:\nAgh! What's, what's going on with these two pictures? Some of the things on the counter sort of... They sort of jump out at you!Juror No. 3:\nYes yes yes! That's it, you see! That's the other amazing power of stereoscopes!Ryunosuke:\nO-Other amazing power?!Juror No. 1:\nIs someone going to explain this...black magic, eh? Why the deuce do some of the things on the counter seem to jump out at you like that, hm?Juror No. 3:\nI think you'll find that if you consider the basic principle of the stereoscope, you'll answer your own question.Juror No. 5:\nBasic principles...of the stereoscope...?Juror No. 3:\nAs I said before... ...if you try to look at two identical pictures using a stereoscope, it won't work at all. It's the slight shift in the positions of certain objects that lets you see pictures three-dimensionally.Ryunosuke:\n...In other words... ...even though at first glance it seems the objects on the counter haven't moved at all between the two pictures... ...this shows that actually...there must have been a slight shift in their positions!Iris:\nYes, there must have been.Juror No. 1:\nNow hold fire there, sir! Got a reasonable grasp of this whole cross-eyed business now, I'd say. But why the devil does this shift between the two prints exist in the first place? Well? What's the answer, fellow? Come on, you're the cross-eyed master!Ryunosuke:\nWhat? Me? (I haven't the first idea!)Iris:\nYou know, Runo! It's quite simple.Ryunosuke:\nIt, it is?Iris:\nJust think it through step by step. The first photograph was taken at 1:00 a.m. Then, thirty minutes later...the second photograph was taken. But the position of some items on the counter appears to have shifted slightly in the interim. So that means...?Ryunosuke:\nThat means that sometime in the half hour interval... ...someone must have tampered with the things on the counter!Juror No. 1:\nZookers!Juror No. 3:\nSomeone tampered...?Juror No. 5:\nNew information! Stop. Not mentioned in testimony so far! Stop.Ryunosuke:\n(Yes... ...we've had to go around in circles a little here, it seems... ...but I'm starting to see what I should be aiming at in this summation examination now.) Ladies and gentlemen! The question now is clear. We know the items on the countertop were moved. ...But by whom?Juror No. 1:\nAre you... Are you suggesting you might know?Ryunosuke:\nOf course. I can tell you right now who is responsible for the almost imperceptible shift in the items on the counter!Present Nash Skulkin or Ringo Skulkin profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nQuite clearly it was the work...of this meddler!\nJudge:\nHm... I'm afraid you've digressed there, Counsel.\nRyunosuke:\nOh.\nVan Zieks:\nIt should now be clear even to you... ...who is responsible for the impeachable shift in the direction of this trial...toward the absurd.\nRyunosuke:\nLet me guess... ...Me?\nVan Zieks:\nShift aside, my Nipponese friend, and let the real lawyers do the talking!\nRyunosuke:\nUargh! (I really felt that one...)\nIris:\nIf you think about it... ...it has to have been someone who was in Windibank's when everything was going on, doesn't it?\nRyunosuke:\nWell...yes, that's true.\nIris:\nSo... ...that narrows it down quite a lot, I think.\nRyunosuke:\nI'll have another think! (We know somebody must have touched the things on Mr Windibank's counter. So who was it?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Ladies and gentlemen!\"Ryunosuke:\nIt was the witnesses currently in the stand...the Skulkin brothers!Juror No. 2:\n...!Juror No. 4:\n...!Juror No. 6:\nWait! This does not agree with what brothers said in testimony before. They said they did not even have time to pull 'dukes' from 'Lucy Lockets'. My phrasebook says 'dukes' is meaning 'hands' and 'Lucy Lockets' is meaning 'pockets'. But is this...another lie?! Is this what you are saying?!Ryunosuke:\nYes, I'm afraid so.Juror No. 4:\nNow hold on there a minute! You can't be sure of that.Juror No. 2:\nI quite agree. The accused is a common pickpurse, after all. It's perfectly possible that she went through the things on the desk to see what she might steal.Ryunosuke:\nI think...that's unlikely.Juror No. 1:\nAnd why, exactly?Ryunosuke:\n...As you can see from...this photographic print, the defendant was pointing a gun at the victim. It would seem, as my learned friend indicated, that she was coercing Mr Windibank to open the storeroom door. In other words, Miss Lestrade's interests lay within the storeroom, not in the main shop... ...giving her no reason to touch anything on the counter. All of which points to one thing! The Skulkin brothers have omitted key facts in their testimony!Juror No. 1:\n...!Juror No. 2:\n...! But the accused is a pickpurse! Common gutter trash! Why look any further for the wrongdoer here?Ryunosuke:\nBecause the Skulkin brothers are thieves, madam. No better - in fact worse - than a pickpurse.Juror No. 2:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nI believe that these brothers were looking for something on the victim's counter that night.Juror No. 3:\n...!Juror No. 4:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, if you would condemn the defendant on the grounds that she's a pickpocket... ...would it not at least be right and proper to thoroughly scrutinise testimony given against her by two thieves?Juror No. 4:\n...Well said.Ryunosuke:\n...!Juror No. 4:\nI for one would like to hear more from that shady pair!Juror No. 3:\nCan you all see now? I think you'll find stereoscopes aren't playthings! You've seen their extraordinary potential firsthand!Juror No. 5:\nWholeheartedly agree! Stop. Must purchase after trial. Stop. Will return home via Regent Street. Stop.Judge:\nWell...it would seem this trial has yet to run its course. The ladies and gentlemen of the jury have declared their inclinations via the mighty Scales of Justice. I hereby call this summation examination to conclusion with the balance altered in the defendant's favour. Two lean to guilty. Four lean to not guilty. Accordingly, the jury is without consensus... ...and I order this trial to continue.Iris:\nYay! Well done! ...Oh, by the way...Ryunosuke:\nWhat?Iris:\nYou should hold onto this, Runo. You never know when it might come in useful!Ryunosuke:\n(Twice in one trial would be unusual, surely? But alright.)The stereoscope has been entered into the Court Record.Judge:\nLord van Zieks... ...you will instruct the witnesses that the court demands additional testimony from them.Examine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStereoscope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint tray\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nYou have to pop your two prints in here to start with, you see.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd then, when you look through the eyepieces, you can see the image in three dimensions!\nIris:\nThe important thing to get right is the position of the two prints.\nRyunosuke:\n(I don't know who came up with the idea of a stereoscope, but it's really quite fascinating.)\n\n\n\n\nButton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nOoh! Look at that! It's totally changed shape, just from one little button press!\nIris:\nWell, that is what the button's for, Runo. You're just like Hurley. You boys love pressing buttons, don't you, especially if you don't know what they do!\nRyunosuke:\n(Us boys? ...Says the ten-year-old girl.)\nIris:\nAnyway, now you can see that it really is a stereoscope, can't you?Van Zieks:\n......... I'm sure it won't spoil the bouquet to do so...My Lord.Ryunosuke:\n(I've won myself another chance to probe that pair about their activities that night at least. And I won't stop probing them until I've proven that Gina is innocent!)To be continued...Judge:\nOrder, please. Let us resume proceedings. Witnesses! You will now retake the stand.Judge:\nI presume you heard the defence counsel's summation examination?Nash:\nOh...yeah...guvnor.Ringo:\nI did, guv, I did.Ryunosuke:\n...Mr and Mr Skulkin!Cor!Blimey!Ryunosuke:\n(...This is going to be hard work.) Earlier in this trial, you gave the following testimony about your actions after you entered Windibank's...Nash:\nWell it was bedlam soon as, weren't it?Ringo:\nIt woz, Nash, it woz. Didn't even 'ave time to pull me dukes out me Lucy Lockets.Ryunosuke:\nHowever...that was a lie! You brothers!Cor!Blimey!Ryunosuke:\nOn the night in question... ...you rifled through the items on the victim's counter!We never done nuffin' o' the sort!'Ow d'you figure that out?.........Judge:\nYou will now give formal testimony once again. You will tell the court precisely what happened on the night in question. And this time...you will tell the truth.Van Zieks:\n...Each lie that passes your lips serves to increase the severity of your punishment. And that, gentlemen, may deal a crushing blow to your chances of ever seeing the light of day again....!...!Van Zieks:\nA thought worth pondering perhaps.Say no more, guv! We 'ear ya!We'll blab! We'll speak! We'll peach!Witness Testimony\n- Illegal Entry: The Whole Truth -Nash:\nAlright, we did knock a few things over. But we weren't riflin' fer nuffin'!Ringo:\nIt woz when we 'eard the gunshot, see. Made us both jump, an' all that stuff went flyin'.Nash:\nLummy, it didn't 'alf gimme a fright! We woz thinkin' the shooter'd come out the door and get us next.Ringo:\nWe stuck everyfin' back where we found it and scarpered...straight into 'im in the black.Nash:\nWe couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?Judge:\nHmmm...so you admit to the defence's accusation. You did indeed ransack Mr Windibank's countertop on the night in question.Nash:\nErr...not ransack, guvnor, no.Ringo:\nThat's right, Nash, that's right. It's...more like we tidied up. Yeah.Van Zieks:\n.........Ringo:\nUgh...sorry.Van Zieks:\nBy their own admission, these brothers entered the pawnbrokery under dubious circumstances. However, they panicked and fled on hearing the gunshot, having first made good their mess.Nash:\nThe way you say it...we 'ardly sound like roughs at all.Ringo:\nWe don't, Nash, we don't. Can't 'e make us sound a bit more...cut-throat?Ryunosuke:\n(It can't just be coincidence that these men showed up at Windibank's that night. There's more to their testimony than meets the eye.

We ain't exactly squeaky clean, are we?\nRingo:\nWe ain't, Nash, we ain't! If we admitted to somefin' like that, people would think we woz up to no good!\nNash:\nWell said, Ringo, me old china! We'd only land ourselves in even more trouble!\nRyunosuke:\nAnd in fact now, as a result of lying in your previous testimony... ...that's exactly what you've done. Landed yourselves in even more trouble.\nNash:\nAh, well, erm...\nRingo:\nThat's rotten luck.\nRyunosuke:\n(...Says the rotten apple-eater.)\nVan Zieks:\nWitnesses... ...explain your actions to the court. Why did you ransack the victim's counter?\nNash:\nWe never ransacked nuffin'!\nRingo:\nRight, Nash, right!

This bag o' nerves needs to learn to keep 'is shirt on!\nRingo:\nLook, it woz loud, alright? Blimey, me dead granny would 'ave woken up at that bang!\nNash:\n'Big' bruv 'ere screamed like a bloomin' baby and fell over on the counter. 'E knocked over a load o' books, a candlestick and some skull wotnot.\nRingo:\nThat got tangled in some marionette, wot knocked over a picture frame, wot knocked them scales on the floor.\nRyunosuke:\n...You've really mastered working quietly then.\nRingo:\nWot a racket! Me granny would 'ave been scared back into 'er grave at a clatter like that.\nRyunosuke:\nSo in short...the gunshot took you by surprise.\nNash:\nAnd then some!

Do you have something to add?\nGregson:\nLike I keep sayin', I don't appreciate bein' lumped in with these scoundrels!\nRyunosuke:\n......... No, something to add about their testimony? You seemed to react just now at what Mr Skulkin said. Did it make you think of something?\nGregson:\n......... It's probably nothin', of course. I wouldn't even bother to mention it, only... Well, the fact is, cases don't get solved if you ignore the little details.\nRyunosuke:\n...How about you just tell us what's on your mind?\nGregson:\n......... As you know, we brought these fellas in to the Yard for questionin' last night. And the statement they gave then told a slightly different story to what they're sayin' now.\nNash:\n...!\nRingo:\n...!\nNash:\nAh...um... Did it?\nGregson:\nYou claimed you heard the victim shout somethin' out before the gunshot.\nRingo:\nMight 'ave, guv, might 'ave.

Yep! It's all comin' back to me now!\nVan Zieks:\nThen speak! Supplement your testimony with whatever details have miraculously returned to your questionable minds...sirs.\nRingo:\nUm...hehe...

I 'ear the shot, then next thing I know, there's a skull rollin' across the floor!\nNash:\nThat deafenin' bang in the pitch-black... I ain't gonna forget that in an 'urry, I can tell ya.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd yet despite being so scared, you had the composure to tidy the mess you'd made?\nNash:\nEh? Wot d'ya mean, guv?\nRyunosuke:\nI would imagine most people would have left the rolling skull and fled without a second thought.\nRingo:\nD'you wanna give the Skulkin bruvs a bad name? If nuffin' else, we're tidy!\nRyunosuke:\n...Well pardon me for the slander.Ringo:\nJust before the gunshot, we 'eard a voice yellin' out, 'Gimme that gun!'Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo in fact you heard the voice and the gunshot almost simultaneously?\nRingo:\nWe did, guv, we did.\nNash:\nAlthough...I s'pose if yer bein'...honest...we 'eard a kind of waverin' voice before the yell an' all.\nRingo:\n'If, if ya don't wanna get shot...'\n'Gimme that gun! BAM!'\nRingo:\n...Kind o' thing!\nRyunosuke:\n(...A career in acting tragically missed...) And where were the voices coming from? Could you tell?\nRingo:\n'Course we could! From the other side o' that door behind the counter, it woz.\nRyunosuke:\n(From the storeroom, where the victim was found dead...)\nVan Zieks:\nAnd the voice you heard...it was that of the victim, Mr Windibank?\nRingo:\nOn me granny's life! 'Course it woz!\nNash:\nOn 'is granny's life! 'Course it woz!\nRyunosuke:\nSo...that would mean... ...that you both knew Mr Windibank and the sound of his voice?\nNash:\nEh? So that would mean...wot?!\nRingo:\nWot, Nash, wot? ...Any ideas?\nJudge:\nYes, Counsel, indeed it would.\nNash:\n......... Nah nah nah! We, we didn't know the geezer!\nRingo:\n'Ow am I s'posed to deny it when that bloke in all the fancy clobber's givin' us the evil eye?\nVan Zieks:\n......... If you value your lives, you will ensure your testimony is accurate and true.\nRingo:\nOn, on me granny's life, it is!\nNash:\nOn, on 'is granny's life, it must be!\nRyunosuke:\n(...It's a good job his granny's dead.)\nVan Zieks:\nTo summarise, then... Immediately after hearing the voice of the victim, you then hear the gunshot... ...causing you to stumble and upset the items on the counter, scattering them over the shop floor.\nRingo:\n...Ya make it sound like we're clumsy.\nNash:\nDon't forget we tidied up after like good little boys. Anyway, the way I see it...Nash:\nThe bloke wot owned the place was 'oldin' a gun, so 'e should 'ave just fired instead of yellin' at the girl!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou're saying that Mr Windibank had a gun in his hands?\nNash:\nOh yeah! Bet that woz a sight, eh? Them two wavin' them guns at each other. Must've got pretty 'eated! I mean, just before 'e shouted out, we 'eard the geezer say, 'If ya don't wanna get shot...'!\nRingo:\nDidn't really sound like 'e meant it, mind. More of an empty threat, ya could say.\nVan Zieks:\nMr Windibank was known to keep a revolver on his shop counter at all times. People say that to protect the articles in his keeping, he'd readily put a bullet in someone's head if required. ...That someone being himself, of course.\nJudge:\nGood grief! Extraordinary devotion, indeed, if alarmingly misguided.\nNash:\nWell 'e certainly sounded like 'e woz ready to pull the trigger the other night. Only, the person 'e woz gonna shoot beat 'im to it. Cooked 'is goose proper!\nRingo:\nBet 'e wished 'e'd squeezed the trigger instead of wastin' time shoutin', 'Gimme that gun!'\nRyunosuke:\nAnd it was directly after those words that you heard the gunshot?\nNash:\nIt woz more or less at the same time, guv.\n'Gimme that gun! BAM!'\nRingo:\n...Kind o' thing!\nRyunosuke:\n(...Yes... A career in acting very tragically missed...)\nNash:\nThen we 'eard the sound o' someone hittin' the deck... ...before everyfin' went dead quiet.\nRingo:\nAfter that, we dun a slap-dash job tidyin' the place up.Present Crime Scene Photograph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"So you're saying...\"Present Photograph of Gina\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou're saying that on the night in question... ...the victim, Mr Windibank, was wielding a gun, is that correct?\nNash:\nThat's it, guv. You've got the picture.\nRingo:\n'E has, Nash, 'e has. No question!\nRyunosuke:\nAnd yet the photographic evidence from the time of the incident clearly shows... ...that Mr Windibank was not in possession of a firearm of any description!\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\n...You surprise me. Does the defence really intend to highlight evidence that compromises the position of the accused even more?\nRyunosuke:\nAh.\nJudge:\nFurthermore, the defence has failed to establish that the photographic print presented... ...was taken a suitably short time prior to the victim's death. Your chronology is severely lacking, Counsel.\nNash:\nYeah! That's right!\nRingo:\nToo right, Nash, too right! The old geezer could've been about to turn the tables on the girl, eh?\nRyunosuke:\n(...Hardly likely.)\nJudge:\nNo, I'm afraid this won't stand as conclusive evidence.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...\nJudge:\nContinue with the cross-examination, Counsel! ...And heed my earlier warning, witnesses!\n...A Skulkin's never skulkin'!Nash:\nLummy, it didn't 'alf gimme a fright! We woz thinkin' the shooter'd come out the door and get us next.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo...you didn't try to open the storeroom door then?\nNash:\nNot on yer life!\nRingo:\nIt went deathly quiet after that, it did. Put the wind right up me. But anyway, the door woz locked, weren't it? No way that woz openin'!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, of course. It was locked from the inside, or so we've been led to believe.\nRingo:\nIt woz, guv, it woz! From the inside.\nNash:\nRight, so we 'ad no way of knowin' wot woz goin' on in there, did we?\nRyunosuke:\nUnless there was some other way to get a view of the inside of the storeroom. Like, through the keyhole or...a spyhole perhaps?\nDon't ring no bells! Don't light no lights!\nWe 'ad to cut an' run before we noticed anyfin' like that.\nWe're still cuttin' our teeth in this game, see. But one day...\n\n...we'll really cut the mustard!\n\nRyunosuke:\n...Please...cut it out.\nVan Zieks:\nBut as we know, behind that door was the victim's lifeless body...with the accused not two feet away.\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes...unfortunately... Gina was in there, unconscious...with the gun in her hand...)\nVan Zieks:\nTo confirm, would it be correct to say that neither of you set foot inside the storeroom?\nRingo:\nThat's right, guv, that's right!\nNash:\nCouldn't 'ave even if we'd wanted to!Ringo:\nWe stuck everyfin' back where we found it and scarpered...straight into 'im in the black.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYes, whereupon you fired a shot from your own gun... at Mr Herlock Sholmes!\nNash:\nOh, um...yeah...erm... We woz a bit 'asty there.\nRingo:\nWe woz, Nash, we woz! Troof be told, I woz already shakin' like a leaf when you lot turned up.\nIris:\nIf you're shaking like a leaf, don't put a loaded gun in your hand!\nRingo:\nG-Good advice, miss, good advice...\nNash:\nTroof be told, me mind went totally blank.\nIris:\nBefore your mind goes totally blank, make sure you don't have a loaded gun in your hand!\nNash:\nM-Mental note made, miss...\nRingo:\nAfter that we legged it down the street, but... ...'parently we looked dodgy to the coppers or summat, so they clapped the Darbies on us like winkin'.\nVan Zieks:\nAnd after you'd been handcuffed, the police found this revolver in your possession, correct?\nRingo:\nErm...well...yeah.\nNash:\nBut listen! That proves it, dunnit? Eh?Nash:\nWe couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nAnd why should we believe that?\nNash:\nEh? Wot? Well...cos it's true, innit!\nRingo:\nThe place was totally empty when we went in.\nVan Zieks:\nAt that time, the victim was already in the storeroom... ...having been forced to open the door by the accused who had a gun to his head.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nIn other words, on the night in question, these two witnesses... ...never even laid eyes on the proprietor of the pawnbrokery, Mr Windibank. Correct?\nRingo:\nYou've got it, mister!\nNash:\nDown to a tee!\nJudge:\nHmmm...\nRyunosuke:\n(So the Skulkin brothers never actually encountered Mr Windibank? Is that really true, I wonder...)Ryunosuke:\n(That's it? That's the full extent of their testimony?)Iris:\nWhat is it, Runo? You look very fierce! I could pour you some herbal tea if you're tired?Ryunosuke:\nOh...thank you, but I'm fine. Being such a logical thinker, you'll probably laugh... ...but I feel as though these brothers are still hiding something. Something important. It is nothing more than a feeling, though. I've no proof to support it.Iris:\nHm... Well, feelings can be very logical at times.Ryunosuke:\nSorry?Iris:\nPeople's expressions...the movement of their eyes... the words they choose... You can take all that in and your brain will quietly analyse it to come up with a 'feeling' like you describe. You've concluded that there's something suspicious about this testimony without knowing why, that's all. I think you should trust your instincts.Ryunosuke:\nIris...thank you... (...Sometimes I think if she's ten years old, I must be five.)Ryunosuke:\nSo you're saying... ...that on the night in question, the victim, Mr Windibank, was wielding a gun, is that correct?Nash:\nThat's it, guv. You've got the picture.Ringo:\n'E has, Nash, 'e has. No question!Ryunosuke:\nAnd yet...photographic evidence obtained immediately after the incident clearly shows... ...that Mr Windibank was not holding a firearm of any description!Ringo:\nEh?! You wot?!Nash:\nGordon Bennett! That ain't right!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nThere can be no question that the victim's revolver was used in the incident. I would remind the court that Mr Windibank's gun was found at the scene. Not only was it identified as the murder weapon...but it was found in the accused's hand!Nash:\nYeah! That moll-tooler used the victim's own gun to finish 'im off!'Gimme that gun! BAM!'Ringo:\n...Kind o' thing!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nStay exactly where you are! Right there!Ringo:\nEh?Ryunosuke:\nIf the crime had taken place as you've so colourfully described in your testimony... ...it would give rise to an undeniable and significant inconsistency in the final moments you just acted out.Judge:\nGoodness! Are you sure, Counsel?Van Zieks:\nYou intrigue me, my learned friend. ...But let's see some evidence to support your claim. Where is the proof that demonstrates this inconsistency in the witnesses' portrayal of the victim's final moments?Present Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nAccording to their testimony... ...the witnesses claim to have heard a shout of 'Give me that gun!' followed by the gunshot.\nJudge:\nIndeed. With the two events happening almost simultaneously, or so we've been led to believe.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, that's right. Now, if that testimony is true... ...it would mean that at the moment of death, the victim and his attacker would have been facing each other. However...in the autopsy report, it clearly states... ...that the victim died instantly after being shot from behind.\nLeads to:\n\"Ah.\"Present Crime Scene Photograph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nAccording to their testimony... ...the witnesses claim to have heard a shout of 'Give me that gun!' followed by the gunshot.\nJudge:\nIndeed. With the two events happening almost simultaneously, or so we've been led to believe.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, that's right. Now, if that testimony is true... ...it would mean that at the moment of death, the victim and his attacker would have been facing each other. However...if I could ask the court to study the photograph of the victim's body again... ...you can clearly see that Mr Windibank was in fact shot from behind.\nLeads to:\n\"Ah.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nI believe this is all the proof you need!\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nUnfortunately not. I require proof that actually proves something, you see.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh... (I knew it was a long shot...)\nVan Zieks:\nIt would appear that you have failed to grasp even the bare bones of this case. Perhaps your level of intellect is better suited to the theatricals of these witnesses than advocacy.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\n'Gimme that gun! BAM!'\nRingo:\n...Kind o' thing! Wanna take the stage wiv us, eh?\nNash:\nYou could be Sulky if ya like!\nRyunosuke:\nAAAAAAAAARGH! (Nash, Ringo and Sulky's Kabuki theatre troupe... No, it would never take off.)\nJudge:\nI believe the counsel for the defence still wishes to pursue his career in the courts, Lord van Zieks.\nLeads back to:\n\"You intrigue me, my learned friend.\"Ah.Ryunosuke:\nSo, as I stated before... ...there is an undeniable inconsistency in your testimony, Mr and Mr Skulkin!NYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!Nash:\nBut!

Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Witnesses! Explain yourselves at once!Nash:\nWell...the thing is... It weren't s'posed to, um...Van Zieks:\nIt would seem...that my previous warning fell on deaf ears. I made it quite clear that false witness...would be the death of you....!Judge:\nAm I to understand that you replaced the untruths of your original testimony with renewed lies?Nash:\nUm...ever so sorry, guvnor! Troof is, see...we, um...Ringo:\nCut it out, Nash, cut it out! If we blab now, ya know wot 'e'll do to us...Ryunosuke:\n('He'?

I demand that you testify again to explain the precise circumstances under which this meeting took place!Nash:\nErm...well...Ringo:\n...Do we 'ave to?Van Zieks:\nOn pain of death. I suggest you make yourselves fully aware that this is your very last chance to tell the truth.Witness Testimony\n- Encounter with the Victim -Ringo:\nAlright, so we'd just got inside the gaff and 'eaved a sigh o' relief when the geezer showed 'is mug!Nash:\n'Gimme that gun!'

But we never thought no one woz gonna come outta the back room like that!\nRyunosuke:\nThe back room being the pawnbrokery's storeroom?\nRingo:\nYeah, that must be where 'e popped up from. Only place 'e could've been.\nVan Zieks:\nSo it would seem the victim was already in the storeroom when these brothers entered the premises.\nIris:\nWhich means...Ginny must have been in there at that point as well.\nRyunosuke:\nBut that doesn't make sense...does it? If Gina had threatened Mr Windibank into the storeroom with her at gunpoint... ...then why would he have emerged from the same room all alone when the brothers arrived?\nIris:\nOh, I...don't know...\nRyunosuke:\nDid you see the accused at that time?\nRingo:\nWot, that moll-tooler? Couldn't tell ya!\nNash:\nNo way, cobber! We 'ad bigger fish to fry then! I mean the old geezer just lost it!Nash:\n'Gimme that gun!' 'e bellowed, and then 'e flew at us like 'e woz possessed! I thought we'd 'ad it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou mentioned that Mr Windibank shouted those words in your previous testimony, too. However, you claimed that you heard him yelling them on the other side of the storeroom door.\nNash:\nOh...um... Hehe. ...Did we?\nRyunosuke:\nBut the truth is, he he was shouting those words at you, wasn't he?\nNash:\nErm...well... Hehe. ...Yeah.\nVan Zieks:\nWas the victim - Mr Windibank - wielding a gun at the time?\nRingo:\nWoz 'e ever! Blimey lummy! A great ugly barrel 'e 'ad, pointed straight at me frontispiece!\nRyunosuke:\nSo what you're saying is... ...you definitely saw Mr Windibank with the gun at that time. Is that right?\nRingo:\nIt is, guv, it is. Spot on.\nNash:\nThen all of a sudden 'e came at us, 'e did!\nRingo:\nIt woz bedlam! I didn't know who woz goin' for who!\nRyunosuke:\n...You were clearly all going for each other.\nRingo:\nLike Nash said, we thought we'd 'ad it. I mean...Ringo:\nFor an old geezer, the bloke woz strong as an ox. 'E chucked me over the counter!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I noted that you mentioned the counter in your previous testimony, too.\nRingo:\nWell...yeah...'course we did!\nNash:\n'E knocked over a load o' books, a candlestick and some skull wotnot.\nRingo:\nThat got tangled in some marionette, wot knocked over a picture frame, wot knocked them scales on the floor.\nRyunosuke:\nSo in fact, it wasn't the sound of the gunshot that shocked you and made you knock those things off the counter?\nNash:\nWell...'big' bruv 'ere went flyin' over that counter like a gunshot, I can tell ya! Then the old geezer pinned 'im!\nRingo:\n'E did, Nash, 'e did! If you 'adn't been there, the bloke would've flattened me like a bloomin' pancake in seconds!\nVan Zieks:\nAt the time in question, the alarm was raised at the local police station via a secret cable from the pawnbrokery. There is a button under the counter used to activate it, which was presumably pressed by the victim.\nRyunosuke:\n(That's right... When the brothers fled the scene and back onto the street... ...they ran straight into the arriving police, didn't they?)\nIris:\nPoor Mr Windibank... He did everything he could to protect his shop...Nash:\nI pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWere you intending to shoot Mr Windibank?\nNash:\nNah nah nah nah! Never! I, I woz just...ya know... Lookin' out fer me bruv, weren't I? 'E woz bein' flattened, don't forget!\nRyunosuke:\n...By a man whose shop was being burgled, yes.\nVan Zieks:\nAnd then? The man fled into the storeroom when you pointed your gun at him, is that it?\nNash:\nYeah, that's it. 'E shoved me away, then ran off fru that door an' shut 'imself in!\nRyunosuke:\n......... (There's something about that last remark... Something that doesn't quite ring true.)\nIris:\nHm...I wonder why Mr Windibank ran away into the storeroom...\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nIris:\nWell, according to what everyone's saying... ...Ginny was in there waiting for him...with a gun.\nRyunosuke:\nAh... (Yes, that's right.) Gina allegedly used Mr Windibank's gun to threaten him and force him to open the storeroom door. In which case...how did the gun end up in Mr Windibank's hands again?\nIris:\nI have no idea... But that is strange, isn't it?\nRyunosuke:\n(This little inconsistency could be significant. I should make a mental note of it.)\nNash:\nLook, the point is, me an' me bruv 'ere...\nRingo:\nThat's right, Nash, that's right! Me an' me bruv 'ere...Ringo:\nWe never 'ad nuffin' to do wiv killin' 'im! That's all wot 'appened, I swear!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou say you had nothing to do with it?\nNash:\nNuffin' at all!\nRingo:\nNuffin', guv, nuffin'! The old geezer went and shut 'imself in the back room, didn't 'e?\nNash:\nLocked, it woz. From the inside.\nRingo:\nWe know it woz, cos we tried to open it.\nNash:\nBut it's a decent door, that one. Good an' strong. Wouldn't budge an inch!\nVan Zieks:\nSo in the end, the situation remains unchanged.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nInside the storeroom with the pawnbroker there was only one other person. The sole person  who could possibly have shot the victim: the accused, Miss Gina Lestrade!\nRyunosuke:\nAgh!\nJudge:\nHm... It would indeed appear so. What say you to that, Counsel?\nRyunosuke:\n(I don't know...) Was there anyone else apart from Gina who could possibly have shot Mr Windibank?\n\n\n\nThere's no one else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(He's right. Gina's the only one. There was no one else in the room!)\nIris:\nWith an attitude like that, Runo, it really will be all over.\nRyunosuke:\n(Now a ten-year-old is reading the expression on my face...)\nIris:\nWell, you just don't have that many. Wide-eyed, sweating, smug and happy. That's about it!\nRyunosuke:\n(Surely there's more than that... isn't there?)\nIris:\nAaanyway...I think you might want to consider some other possibilities here. ...Or rather, I think you have to. Otherwise we won't get anywhere. ...Or rather, YOU won't get anywhere. I'm just here for moral support, remember.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nThere could have been!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nMr and Mr Skulkin!\nNash:\nEh?! Wot?\nRingo:\nWot's that look for?\nRyunosuke:\nFrom the moment you admitted that you'd encountered the victim face to face that night... ...the course of this trial changed completely.\nNash:\nIt did?\nVan Zieks:\nWhat is your point...my learned friend?\nRyunosuke:\nThe question we must answer is who could have shot Mr Windibank. And it is the belief of the defence that the defendant is not the only possible answer at all.\nVan Zieks:\nYou have my attention. In that case...let us return to this plan of the premises. The victim was killed in the storeroom, which was locked from the inside. Those are the facts. So pray...what other possible answer to the question of who shot the man could there be?\nJudge:\nCounsel... ...you must now provide answers to the court in respect of two conundrums.\nRyunosuke:\nTwo...My Lord? (...Twice as many chances to be right, maybe?)\nJudge:\nIndeed. Namely... ...from what location did the culprit shoot the victim? And furthermore... ...where was the victim at the time?\nRyunosuke:\n......... Understood, My Lord.\nIris:\nAre you alright, Runo?\nRyunosuke:\nI'm not entirely sure. But there's one thing I am sure about. If I can prove that there's a credible new alternative to what happened... ...it would change Gina's prospects hugely!\nVan Zieks:\nSo now...time for some clarity. Show the court on this plan the answers to the questions posed by His Lordship. If you believe someone else could have killed the victim, indicate from where that person could have fired the gun!\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe defence believes that the culprit could have shot the victim from this location here.\nVan Zieks:\n......... And in answer to the second question... Assuming the culprit fired from the location indicated, where was the victim at the time?\n\n\n\nPresent storeroom (after presenting main shop)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The culprit shot the victim from outside the storeroom!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent storeroom (after presenting storeroom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe defence believes that the victim would have been in this position here.\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nWhat your answers in fact show... ...is that your own position is as absurd as those you have indicated on the plan.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat are you saying?\nJudge:\nWhat Lord van Zieks is saying, Counsel... ...is that your answers are clearly flawed!\nRyunosuke:\nUWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.)\nIris:\nSo the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...you have to at least choose a place that's outside the storeroom, don't you?\nRyunosuke:\nOh...\nIris:\nI mean, if you're saying that someone shot Mr Windibank from inside the storeroom, they'll just say it was Ginny.\nRyunosuke:\n......... You're right. (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?)\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe defence would like to point out the locations again!\nVan Zieks:\nWell well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment.\nLeads back to:\n\"So now...time for some clarity.\"\n\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nMy Lord, I would like to consider the situation a little more before giving my answers again.\nVan Zieks:\nConsider the situation as much as you like. The answers do not exist.\nJudge:\nVery well. The court will hear from the witnesses again while you deliberate, Counsel.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe defence believes that the victim would have been in this position here.\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nWhat your answers in fact show... ...is that your own position is as absurd as those you have indicated on the plan.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat are you saying?\nJudge:\nWhat Lord van Zieks is saying, Counsel... ...is that your answers are clearly flawed!\nRyunosuke:\nUWAAAAAAGH! (...I knew it. It's twice as many chances to be wrong.)\nIris:\nSo the questions are: from where did the culprit shoot the victim, and where was the victim at the time? Well... ...I don't see why we can't show that someone other than Ginny could have done it in the storeroom, do you?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, that's the right way of looking at it, I suppose. Someone other than Gina in the storeroom... (What's the best move here? Should I try again, or gather more information first?)\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe defence would like to point out the locations again!\nVan Zieks:\nWell well, you appear to be a glutton for punishment.\nLeads back to:\n\"So now...time for some clarity.\"\n\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nMy Lord, I would like to consider the situation a little more before giving my answers again.\nVan Zieks:\nConsider the situation as much as you like. The answers do not exist.\nJudge:\nVery well. The court will hear from the witnesses again while you deliberate, Counsel.\nLeads back to cross-examinationRyunosuke:\n(So that's all these brothers are willing to reveal this time, is it?)Iris:\nThey're still hiding something, don't you think?Ryunosuke:\nYes, I'm sure of it. And not just a minor detail, either.Iris:\nIt was almost certainly because of these two that poor Mr Windibank...well... You can't let them get away with it, Runo!Ryunosuke:\nI know. (But I get the feeling... ...that there's even less evidence at my disposal this time to prove that they did it.)Iris:\nWe've come so far... Now it's time to finish them off!Ryunosuke:\nWell, I'll do my best.Ryunosuke:\nThe culprit shot the victim from outside the storeroom!Van Zieks:\n......... Continue.Ryunosuke:\nMr Windibank died instantly from a bullet wound in his back. Looking at the stain of blood on the storeroom floor, it doesn't appear that the body was moved after death. Which tells us that he was almost certainly shot while he was in the storeroom. However, the crucial point is, where was the shooter when the fatal bullet was fired?Judge:\nSo you are adamant...that the shot was fired from outside the storeroom?Ryunosuke:\nWell, according to the Skulkin brothers' earlier testimony...Nash:\nI pulled me gun on 'im, an' then 'e legged it fru that door into the back room!Ryunosuke:\nIf Mr Windibank ran away through the door... ...we have to assume that the door was open at the time.Judge:\nAh!Ryunosuke:\nIt was at precisely that moment, when the victim was fleeing for his life... ...that these brothers had the perfect opportunity to shoot the man in the back once he was inside the storeroom!NAAAAAAAAAGH!GAAAAAAAAAGH!Van Zieks:\n...!Iris:\nCome to think of it...do you remember what the prosecutor said at the start of the trial?Van Zieks:\nMoving on to the findings of Scotland Yard's coroner... His report states that the bullet entered the body on a rising diagonal trajectory.Van Zieks:\nIt means...the victim was likely shot by someone significantly shorter in height than himself.Iris:\nPoor man... Shot while he was running as fast as he could to safety...Ryunosuke:\nAh! Of course! He would have been leaning forward as he was running away. So even if the bullet was fired horizontally, it would still have entered his body on an upward trajectory!Iris:\nSo the culprit isn't necessarily someone shorter than Mr Windibank!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nI'm sure my learned friend can't have forgotten... ...that the storeroom door was found closed, and...locked from the inside. You claim the victim was shot as he fled into the room. Do you also claim his corpse was dexterous enough to turn the key in the lock?Ryunosuke:\nAgh! But...but... ...what if someone else locked the door? Yes! There is someone else who could have locked the storeroom door!Van Zieks:\nIs that so?Judge:\nVery well then, Counsel. Present your hypothesis to the court. In the scenario just described... ...the defence's assertion is that the victim was shot from outside the storeroom. In which case, who shut and locked the storeroom door from the inside?Present Gina Lestrade profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the person who locked the door was the only other person inside the storeroom at the time...\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nObviously, that person could only have been...\nIris:\nJust a moment, Runo!\nRyunosuke:\nHm? What? I'm just about to point dramatically at the prosecution and unveil an amazing revelation!\nIris:\nSorry, but just before you do, maybe you should take a deep breath and think things through one more time? The storeroom was locked from the inside. So whoever locked it must have been inside, too...don't you think?\nRyunosuke:\nAh, like Mr Windibank, you mean?\nIris:\nWell yes, except that he was dead. But there's someone else it could have been. Only one other person, really.\nRyunosuke:\nOh... (Only one other?)\nJudge:\nYou're out of time, I'm afraid. ...For which you must be penalised.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh... (There's a time limit?)\nJudge:\nNow then, let me pose the question again.\nLeads back to:\n\"In the scenario just described...\"Ryunosuke:\nObviously, the person who locked the door was the only other person inside the storeroom at the time... ...the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nThat's absurd! You're suggesting that the accused deliberately engineered the sealed room? For what possible reason?! Such actions would only serve to tighten the noose around her neck!Judge:\nI am inclined to agree, I must say. ...Well, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\n......... Ah...yes...that's a tricky one, that...isn't it?Judge:\nHalf-baked notions have no place in my courtroom, Counsel. Remember that, please.Iris:\nBut of course Ginny would have locked the door. It almost goes without saying, doesn't it?Ryunosuke:\nIt, it does?Iris:\nWell if I was Ginny in that situation... ...I know I would have locked the door. As quickly as I could! I mean... ...those two burglars had just fired a gun in her direction, hadn't they?Ryunosuke:\n(Oh yes! Obviously...) Before the two brothers arrived, Miss Lestrade and Mr Windibank were in the storeroom together. Now...I don't know what went on between them at that time, but at some point... ...Mr Windibank must have heard the intruders breaking into his shop, and left the storeroom.Ringo:\nIntruders, eh? ...That's us, bruv!Van Zieks:\nIf your theory is correct, that would leave the accused alone in the storeroom.Ryunosuke:\n...Yes, it would. Then, probably only moments later, the victim fled back through the storeroom door hoping to escape danger.*BANG!*Ryunosuke:\nHit in the back by the bullet, Mr Windibank fell to the floor where he was, just inside the storeroom. And what we have to ask ourselves now is, what would the defendant have done in that moment?Nash:\nAh! I, I see where yer goin' wiv this!Ryunosuke:\nOutside the storeroom was a terrifying killer who had just murdered Mr Windibank. As soon as that thought struck Miss Lestrade, she slammed the door shut and locked it... ...in order to save her own life!Van Zieks:\n...!Judge:\n...!???:Nash:\nBut, but I ain't- I mean, we ain't the ones who dunnit!Ringo:\nWe ain't, guv, we ain't! You've gotta believe us! I mean, come on! We'd never shoot no one!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nThat's blatantly untrue! I know for a fact that you would. Because before my own eyes...you shot Mr Herlock Sholmes!Ringo:\n...!Nash:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nThere is only one logical conclusion here. Mr and Mr Skulkin, you brothers had every opportunity... ...to have been the true perpetrators of Mr Windibank's murder!Nash:\nAh...em...um...Ringo:\nErm...em...ugh...NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!Where, where does this leave us?\nYou mean to say it wasn't the pickpocket who shot the pawnbroker after all?\nI should have known it was those three brothers! They look as shady as a dense forest!Iris:\nThat was amazing, Runo! All the members of the jury seem to be firmly on your side now!Ryunosuke:\nI know! First time ever! And probably the last...Iris:\nWell, I think you've done it! Surely they'll have to give a verdict of not-Van Zieks:\n...Keh...heh...heh... An admirable effort...my learned friend.Ryunosuke:\n...! (What's this now? He's laughing?)Judge:\nYou find the situation amusing, Lord van Zieks? I myself find the defence's argument most persuasive.Van Zieks:\nI dare say... ...such chicanery is the bread and butter of the street performers in your provincial Eastern nation. But such blatantly malicious conjuring tricks amount to nothing more than inexcusable pettifoggery here.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?!Van Zieks:\nThe hypothesis you put forward so ostensibly credibly cannot, and will not stand. Because, you see, it contains a fatal flaw!Ryunosuke:\nA, a fatal flaw?!Van Zieks:\n...Do you mean to tell me that you're unaware of your logic's failing?Juror No. 1:\nI say! Lord van Zieks... Might be an idea to explain this bally conjuring trick or whatever it is to the troops on the ground, hm?Van Zieks:\nThe fatal flaw in my learned friend's argument is really very simple to understand... ...assuming you're not too dim-witted to count bullets!Juror No. 1:\nBy George! Count bullets?!Iris:\nOh dear... ...he noticed then.Ryunosuke:\nHuh? (What's everyone talking about?)Van Zieks:\nCounsel!Ryunosuke:\nY-Yes, sir?!Van Zieks:\nTell the court, how many bullets were found at the scene of the crime?Ryunosuke:\nUm...two. Two bullets.Van Zieks:\nCorrect. The first, that which hit the victim in the back, ending his life. And the second, that which struck the 'detective', Mr Herlock Sholmes, on his arrival at the scene.Judge:\nIndeed. The defence presented a picture showing the damage caused by the second bullet earlier in the proceedings. The bullet which injured Mr Sholmes appears to have passed through his body to strike the calendar.Van Zieks:\nYour Lordship's understanding is correct. Furthermore, we know there are two firearms involved in the incident. The revolver belonging to the victim, Mr Windibank... ...and the Skulkin brothers' revolver. The evidence shows that a single bullet was fired from each gun.Judge:\nYes! Indeed it does! A single bullet from each!Van Zieks:\nNow then, my learned friend...Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nYou yourself told the court only moments ago... ...that these two brothers shot Mr Herlock Sholmes right before your eyes.Ryunosuke:\nYes, I, I did!Juror No. 3:\nOh my goodness! I, I think you'll find...Juror No. 4:\nThat if the single bullet that was fired from the brothers' gun hit Mr Sholmes, it means...Juror No. 5:\nWindibank not shot by same gun! Stop. Only one bullet! Stop.Van Zieks:\n...Exactly. Yes, this Nipponese street performer presented an ostensibly credible argument. ...However! It was never anything more than a diversionary trick with no hope of standing up to scrutiny!Ryunosuke:\nUgh............ UWAAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge:\nOrdaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!Van Zieks:\n...Pray forgive the discourtesy of flinging the dregs of this hallowed nectar into the public gallery...Judge:\nL-Lord van Zieks!Van Zieks:\n...but this court needs to open its eyes. The accused, Miss Gina Lestrade, is no ordinary little girl. Despite her young years, she can, regrettably, no longer be described as a juvenile. No, the person in the dock is far from a law-abiding citizen. She has a past riddled with criminal conduct!Juror No. 1:\n...!Juror No. 2:\n...!Van Zieks:\nThe truth is, the accused broke into the pawnbrokery on the night in question with loathsome intent... ...as we can see beyond doubt in this print which depicts her threatening the victim with the murder weapon!Juror No. 3:\n...!Juror No. 4:\n...!Van Zieks:\nAnd I have here in my possession one more piece of evidence the prosecution wishes to present.Ryunosuke:\n...! (That disk!)Gregson:\nI'll be takin' that whatever-it-is of McGilded's down to the Yard, thank you very much!Gina:\nNo, don't! Don't give it to 'im! It's mine, that is! Mine!Gregson:\nI'm sorry, miss... ...but anythin' belongin' to McGilded has to be taken in as evidence now.Ryunosuke:\n(Yes, that music box disk... McGilded's music box disk...)Van Zieks:\nThe very day before the hateful murder of Mr Windibank... ...the accused attempted to make off with this article, which clearly doesn't belong to her. And with none of the subtlety of a pickpocket, I might add. But by brute force and brazen impudence.Judge:\nGood gracious!Van Zieks:\nMake no mistake! Any sympathy for the accused on account of her years is misguided and dangerous! There are no depths to which this girl would not stoop if pushed. No crime she would not commit. ...The court forgets that fact at its peril.Juror No. 5:\n...!Juror No. 6:\n...!Judge:\nHm...I see... I think it would be prudent to take this music box disk into evidence, Counsel. As a grim testament to the defendant's character.???:Gregson:\nUm...Lord van Zieks...I, um...Ryunosuke:\n(Inspector Gregson...what...?)Van Zieks:\nYes, Inspector?Gregson:\nWe had a meetin' yesterday at the Yard with the prosecution service, and, um... ...I, I think it was agreed that that disk wouldn't be used as evidence.Van Zieks:\n.........Ryunosuke:\n(What's this all about? Why is the inspector acting strangely? That's the first time he's said anything to van Zieks at all...)Van Zieks:\nI am unaware of any such meeting.Gregson:\nBut! But those were the instructions, right from the top. The government bigwigs were insistent!Van Zieks:\nInspector, I am the prosecutor, and I alone determine how to present my case. Your warning is noted. ...Thank you.Gregson:\n...!Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution wishes to proceed with submitting this disk as evidence, My Lord.Judge:\nIn-Indeed. Bailiff!The music box disk has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution has established the accused's motive, opportunity and baseness of character. There is nothing more to add. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I await your informed decisions...and rest my case.Examine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic Box Disk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloodstain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nOh! Runo, look! This is blood!\nRyunosuke:\nYes, you're right. (Just a small smear, but definitely blood. Actually, I feel as though I might have noticed that before...)\nIris:\nHaha! Then it's my time to shine again! I thought I'd be waiting forever! Alright, hold still with that disk, Runo.\nRyunosuke:\nCan we get this done quickly, Iris?\nIris:\nIn a flash! Ooh! A lovely bright shade again.\nRyunosuke:\n......... (Wait, that colour...)\nIris:\nWhat is it?\nRyunosuke:\nIt's just...that green, it... ...it's not the first time we've seen that colour, is it?\nThe blood samples portfolio has been updated in the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nBloodstain (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nSo this is blood! Probably from somebody's fingertip.\nRyunosuke:\nWell deduced. But not just somebody's fingertip... Mr Benedict's fingertip.\nIris:\nThe man dressed all in white?\nRyunosuke:\nYes. It happened that afternoon in Windibank's. Gina tried to snatch this disk out of the man's hands, and the sharp little bumps cut his thumb.\nIris:\nSo the lesson is, if someone tries to grab a music box disk from you, let go quickly.\nRyunosuke:\n...The lesson is don't snatch things, surely?\n\n\n\n\nNote on back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\n'For McGilded'... That's the man you defended in court a couple of months ago, isn't it, Runo?\nRyunosuke:\nYes. Or rather, mistakenly defended.\nIris:\nI wonder what his name is doing on the back of this disk...\nRyunosuke:\nThat's a question I'd love to know the answer to myself.Ryunosuke:\n(I don't believe it... I had the jury on my side for once, for all of five minutes...)Iris:\nOh dear... It wasn't even for five minutes, Runo...???:My Lord!Juror No. 1:\nWonder if I might say something at this point?Judge:\nProceed, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1:\nBeen stumbling about in a bit of a fog up to now, if truth be told. But all of a sudden... ...the answer's bally obvious to me and my men! There's only one thing for it!Ryunosuke:\n(Oh no!)Judge:\nVery well. The court will hear from the jury. Ladies and gentlemen, you will present your leanings as to the defendant's culpability.Juror No. 1:\nGuilty!Juror No. 2:\nGuilty!Juror No. 3:\nGuilty!Juror No. 4:\nGuilty!Juror No. 5:\nGuilty!Juror No. 6:\nGuilty!Judge:\nWe have a consensus among the jury, it seems.Van Zieks:\nWhen you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains...must be the truth.Iris:\nThat's, that's my line! I wrote that! For Hurley! Argh! How dare he use it against us?!Ryunosuke:\nDon't worry, Iris. I don't think we're finished yet. (There's still more to this case than we realise. There must be, because there's one thing that I'm absolutely certain of. Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank! That's beyond any doubt!)Judge:\nVery well... ...we will proceed with the second summation examination of the day. Mr Foreman, are you and the other jurors ready?Juror No. 1:\nGarrideb Squadron is primed and ready for action, sir!Judge:\nVery good. So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...you will each explain on what grounds you have now determined the defendant to be guilty!Judicial Findings\n- The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1:\nOnce a rogue always a rogue, I say...hm? Different breed to us law-abiding citizens!Juror No. 2:\nAs only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.Juror No. 3:\nYou don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!Juror No. 4:\nHm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...Juror No. 5:\nThe accused attempted a theft on the previous day. ...I can see I'm in for a busy day ahead.Juror No. 6:\nI am ballistics expert. I have seen many shootings. There is nothing I do not know about guns.Judge:\nHmmm... It would seem there is little remaining room for doubt.Juror No. 1:\nHave to admit, I was rather bowled over by the argument put forward by the chap in black. But when that fell apart like a house of cards, I saw that I'd jolly well been hoodwinked. Well, no more!Ryunosuke:\n(Ugh...the whole courtroom is turning against me.)Iris:\nIt's not fair!Ryunosuke:\nIris?Iris:\nThat prosecutor's being mean! Just because Ginny's done some things she shouldn't have done in the past... ...that doesn't make her a murderer!Van Zieks:\nAllow me to savour this fruity vintage while I savour the spectacle of your fruitless debate on the matter. Here's to the truth coming out...eventually.Ryunosuke:\n.........Judge:\nThat's enough preamble. Counsel, proceed with the summation examination.Ryunosuke:\n...Yes, My Lord.Jury Examination\n- The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1:\nOnce a rogue always a rogue, I say...hm? Different breed to us law-abiding citizens!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nJust because Miss Lestrade has a history of pickpocketing, she must be guilty of murder, is that what you're saying?\nJuror No. 1:\nAh...well...\nRyunosuke:\nAre all members of the British army so quick to judge?\nJuror No. 1:\nI beg your pardon? Are you mocking Her Majesty's armed forces? The greatest military organisation in the world!\nRyunosuke:\nNo. I'm simply illustrating my point.\nJuror No. 1:\n...!\nRyunosuke:\nMaking assumptions about people because they're a soldier...or a pickpocket...is wrong, and dangerous.\nJuror No. 1:\nHmph. Well, yes, might have a point there, I suppose. But let's not forget the girl had already shown she had it in her from before. She's clearly a criminal sort through and through. Can't deny it.\nRyunosuke:\nWhen you say that she'd 'shown she had it in her'...are you referring to this?\nJuror No. 1:\nExactly. Tried to swipe that only a day earlier, hm? Or am I mistaken?\nRyunosuke:\n...Not exactly. (Given that I was actually there at the time, it's hard to refute that.)\nIris:\nI've never actually seen the real thing. I can't wait to have a closer look at it!\nRyunosuke:\nOh yes, of course... Mr Sholmes did use his caramel bars to make a copy of the disk, didn't he. (And then ordered every type of music box he could find from across Europe...)\nIris:\nWe still don't know what tune it plays though, do we? But I'd love to see how the original compares to Hurley's copy.\nRyunosuke:\n(McGilded's disk... Could it be a clue somehow? Perhaps we should examine it in more detail...)Juror No. 2:\nAs only two bullets were found at the scene, I would say the whole case is done and dusted.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nIt's the number of bullets that has you convinced?\nJuror No. 2:\nOnly two bullets were fired, and the two guns that fired them have been examined by the police. When the parlour maid asks me how many are invited for dinner, I always tell her to count the table settings.\nRyunosuke:\n(Well, that's logical, I suppose.)\nJuror No. 2:\nAlthough...\nRyunosuke:\nYes?\nJuror No. 2:\n...sometimes after dining, crockery does go missing. One or two guests rather like the fine china.\nRyunosuke:\n...Does your employer dine with thieves?\nJuror No. 2:\nSo I suppose... ...if there was another bullet somewhere of which we were unaware... ...I'd have to reconsider my position.\nRyunosuke:\n(...A third bullet somewhere on the scene? Could that be possible?)\n\n\n\nIt's impossible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nUnfortunately... ...only two bullets were discovered by the police during their investigation.\nJuror No. 2:\nYes, I know.\nRyunosuke:\nRight...\nJuror No. 2:\nAnd I don't imagine the good men of Scotland Yard would have overlooked anything. If I missed a bullet while I was cleaning His Lordship's office, well! I should receive a sound scolding, I don't doubt.\nRyunosuke:\n...And he should receive a visit from the police, perhaps. It sounds like a crime scene to me.\nIris:\nHm, a third bullet....\nRyunosuke:\nIt would completely turn things around if there was one, wouldn't it?\nIris:\n...Do you think we might find one lying around somewhere?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nI can prove it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nAllow me to show you, then...the third bullet!\n\n\n\nPresent The Third Bullet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Here it is.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nI, um...don't suppose this would pass as the third bullet?\nVan Zieks:\nIt passes for a bullet as much as you pass for a lawyer... my learned friend.\nRyunosuke:\n(Coming from you, I'm going to take that as meaning, 'not much'.)\nVan Zieks:\nIn no way does it resemble a bullet...if that helps your understanding of my last remark.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...\nJudge:\nCounsel, at the very least I would expect the evidence you present to be of the correct form!\nRyunosuke:\n(...It's been a long day.)\nIris:\nLet's actually try to find this third bullet before we attempt that again, Runo.\nLeads back to cross-examinationJuror No. 3:\nYou don't need a stereoscope to see the truth here. Every which way you look at it, it was that pickpocket!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo if I've understood correctly, you need two pictures: a left eye one and a slightly different right eye one.\nJuror No. 3:\nEeexactly! Then you can see the scene in three dimensions ...like this!\nRyunosuke:\nSo...if we have two bullets...I don't suppose you can see anything useful with them?\nJuror No. 3:\nHm, I think you'll find... ...that no matter how much you squint, the truth of the situation always looks the same here. The only person who could have shot the victim is that girl in the dock!\nRyunosuke:\nHow can you be so sure of that?\nJuror No. 3:\nThink about it! The Skulkin brothers shot the great detective, didn't they?\nRyunosuke:\nYes...that's been mentioned once or twice...\nJuror No. 3:\nWell then! Surely it's coming into focus now, isn't it?\nRyunosuke:\n(This is a waste of time. I'm not going to change this man's mind any time soon.)Juror No. 4:\nHm...I never imagined that simple operation would cause me such grief...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWould you please stop muttering about things that have nothing to do with this trial, sir? The defendant's life is on the line here!\nJuror No. 4:\nHm, well, the thing is... ...I couldn't really say that it is nothing to do with this trial, to be honest.\nRyunosuke:\nHuh?\nJuror No. 4:\nI mean, there's no question that the man was shot, but the bullet had simply vanished from his stomach. It's quite inexplicable. ...Don't you think?\nRyunosuke:\n......... I almost don't want to ask, but this surgery you've been muttering about all this time. You were operating on...\nJuror No. 4:\nWhat was the fellow's name now? Herr Lich? ...No. Herr Loch? ...No. Hairlock?\nRyunosuke:\nHerlock Sholmes by any chance?\nJuror No. 4:\nYes! Good Lord! It was that Hairlock fellow!\nRyunosuke:\nWHAAAT?! You're, you're the surgeon that operated on Mr Sholmes?!\nJuror No. 4:\nThat's right. Using the very latest anaesthesia techniques, I might add! It was a fairly major op, I can tell you.\nRyunosuke:\n(This is crazy!)\nJuror No. 4:\nLet me see, the fellow was brought in not long after midnight, if I remember correctly. They said he'd been shot by some criminal or other. So I opened him up like a shot. But the funny thing is, I went over his insides with a fine-tooth comb, and couldn't find the bullet anywhere. So I'm afraid I had to throw up my hands and just stitch the fellow back up.\nRyunosuke:\n......... I hate to state the obvious, but...\nJuror No. 4:\nYes?\nRyunosuke:\n...surely that's because the bullet is still at the scene of the shooting!\nJudge:\nThe counsel for the defence is correct. As is clearly shown in this photographic print.\nRyunosuke:\nThe bullet that the Skulkin brothers fired at Mr Sholmes hit him in the stomach region... ...then exited his body and lodged into the shop wall where the calendar was hanging by the door. I think you'll find it's really quite simple if you just consider the problem three-dimensionally.\nJuror No. 4:\nHah! Who do you think I am, son?\nRyunosuke:\n...Um, well, 'juror number four' is about the best I can do.\nJuror No. 4:\nAs soon as I saw the wound to the man's stomach, I flipped him over.\nRyunosuke:\n...Like a pancake? Are, are you saying that you checked his back?\nJuror No. 4:\nOf course I did! And there wasn't a trace of injury. No sign that the bullet had left the body at all!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nJuror No. 4:\nThat's the point! The only logical conclusion was that the bullet was still somewhere in the man's innards! Which is exactly why I set about slicing him up! And I'm still none the wiser, even now! How many times do I have to say it? Can somebody please explain how it happened? Can somebody please solve the mystery!\nRyunosuke:\n...It's almost as much of a mystery as how this jury was put together.\nChanges Juror No. 4's statement to \"The mystery of where that bullet ended up is infuriating! Where's an expert when you need one?\"Juror No. 4:\nThe mystery of where that bullet ended up is infuriating!

I've experienced some coincidences recently, but this is ridiculous.\nJuror No. 4:\nI'm as surprised as anyone!\nRyunosuke:\nBut there's no question that Mr Sholmes was shot?\nJuror No. 4:\nWell, that's what the police told me when they brought him in.\nIris:\n...How bad were his injuries, doctor?\nJuror No. 4:\nHe was in a bad way. He'd lost a huge amount of blood, you know. And I suspect he was shot at quite close range, too. Because his skin was badly burnt around the point of entry.\nRyunosuke:\nBurnt?\nJuror No. 4:\nAs I said, I flipped the fellow over and examined his back, but there was no sign of an exit wound. Which is why I thought I'd better locate the lug and pop it out.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd yet you say you found no bullet inside the patient?\nJuror No. 4:\nWell I wouldn't have done, would I? Because it's in the wall of the pawnbroker's. But how did it get there?! I need someone to solve this mystery before it drives me to insanity! If only there were some expert in ballistics who could help! Even if he looked extremely untrustworthy!\nRyunosuke:\n(So we have a disappearing bullet on our hands...)Pit against Juror No. 6's statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThose two statements clearly contradict...the idea that all I do is pit jurors against each other!\nJuror No. 4:\nOoh! A ballistics expert!\nJuror No. 6:\n'Pitting'... 'P-i-t-t-...'\nRyunosuke:\nOn the night in question, Mr Sholmes was shot by one of the Skulkin brothers. But since there was no sign of an exit wound on his back, we must assume the bullet didn't pass through him. However, no bullet was found lodged in Mr Sholmes's body, either. Furthermore... ...a bullet was found lodged in the wall of the shop where Mr Sholmes was shot. Juror number six...\nJuror No. 6:\n'Hello. My name is Vilen. Pleased to meet you.'\nRyunosuke:\nThis apparent contradiction in the facts that is so clearly troubling juror number four... Are you able to explain the mystery?\nJuror No. 6:\n......... I have seen wery similar situation in motherland.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nJuror No. 6:\nIt was night. There was blizzard. I was running away long mountain round in freezing cold.\nJudge:\nGolly.\nJuror No. 6:\nThe snow was piling high on both sides of road. It was wery narrow and dangerous. My pursuers had hunting rifles and they were on dog sleds.\nRyunosuke:\n(...Mental note: don't ask too many questions.)\nJuror No. 6:\nI was shot from behind, and I fell down in snow. And this situation was wery similar to what I hear today from doctor. They could not find bullet in my body. And no sign of - how do you say? - exit wound.\nJudge:\nThen, then where did the bullet go?\nJuror No. 6:\nBullet never hit me.\nJuror No. 4:\nWell if it never hit you, why did you fall down?\nJuror No. 6:\nBullet hit frozen wall of ice wery close to my side.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?!\nJuror No. 6:\nOne small piece - wery sharp - broke away from lump of ice and pierced my body. It made deep wound that looks just like bullet wound.\nJuror No. 4:\nGood gracious...\nJuror No. 6:\nOf course, piece of ice quickly melted inside me. And that is solution to mystery of disappearing bullet.\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nJuror No. 6:\n.........\nJuror No. 4:\nBut, but that doesn't answer the question at all!\nRyunosuke:\nHm?\nJuror No. 4:\nThe shooting happened in a pawnbroker's shop... ...not some snowy mountain road in another country!\nRyunosuke:\n......... ...Just an idea, but we might not be looking at EXACTLY the same scenario here.\nIris:\nRuno... ...where exactly was Hurley shot again?\nRyunosuke:\nUm, well, according to the report, in his stomach. Sort of around this area, I think.\nIris:\nWell...that's precisely where he always wears a little pouch on his belt.\nRyunosuke:\nA pouch? (Actually, I might have noticed something like that.)\nIris:\nYes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three glass phials of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! (Really?) Doctor! Where is the pouch Mr Sholmes was wearing?\nJuror No. 4:\nHm, well... ...the fellow had nothing like that on his person when he arrived at the hospital as far as I remember.\nVan Zieks:\nIf I may...\nRyunosuke:\nLord van Zieks...?\nVan Zieks:\nWhile I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nVan Zieks:\nAs I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound.\nJuror No. 4:\nAh! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment!\nVan Zieks:\nSince then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred.\nJudge:\nVery well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed.\n\nBring forth Mr Herlock Sholmes's pouch!\n\nJudge:\nHm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it?\nRyunosuke:\nLook at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded!\nJudge:\nExploded?\nRyunosuke:\nSo...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch.\nJuror No. 4:\nAnd it was the glass phial exploding that caused the fellow's injury!\nJuror No. 6:\nThe bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop.\nVan Zieks:\n......... ...A delightfully complex aroma.\nJudge:\nWell, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least.\nVan Zieks:\nThough it has no bearing on the truth of this case.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nThe bungling and burgling brothers shot the detective, and the accused shot the pawnbroker. The pertinent facts of the case remain unaltered.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...\nJuror No. 4:\nBut at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man!\nJuror No. 6:\n...Da. 'Thank you wery much.'\nRyunosuke:\n...Glad I could help.\nJudge:\nDue to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence.\nIris:\nHurley's pouch isn't scruffy!\nSholmes's pouch has been entered into the Court Record.\nJudge:\nNow, the summation examination... It would appear the defence is somewhat struggling to alter opinion, hm?\nRyunosuke:\nPlease, My Lord! A little more time. (After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!)\nChanges Juror No. 4's statement to \"Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.\"Examine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSholmes's Pouch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScorch mark on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(It's really scorched badly just here...)\nIris:\nOh!

(It doesn't look much like a bullet hole. But clearly something's ripped through the leather with great force.)\nIris:\nSomething must have pierced it somehow to have left this hole behind.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, it looks that way.

But they're also quite tricky to handle. Safely, at least. They're very dangerous.\nRyunosuke:\nOh.\nIris:\nI'm sure that when this phial broke, the chemical inside would have ignited.\nRyunosuke:\n.........

It made deep wound that looks just like bullet wound.\nJuror No. 4:\nGood gracious...\nJuror No. 6:\nOf course, piece of ice quickly melted inside me. And that is solution to mystery of disappearing bullet.\nRyunosuke:\n.........\nJuror No. 6:\n.........\nJuror No. 4:\nBut, but that doesn't answer the question at all!\nRyunosuke:\nHm?\nJuror No. 4:\nThe shooting happened in a pawnbroker's shop... ...not some snowy mountain road in another country!\nRyunosuke:\n......... ...Just an idea, but we might not be looking at EXACTLY the same scenario here.\nIris:\nRuno... ...where exactly was Hurley shot again?\nRyunosuke:\nUm, well, according to the report, in his stomach. Sort of around this area, I think.\nIris:\nWell...that's precisely where he always wears a little pouch on his belt.\nRyunosuke:\nA pouch? (Actually, I might have noticed something like that.)\nIris:\nYes, a pouch. It's where he keeps three glass phials of very dangerous chemicals that he uses in his investigations.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! (Really?) Doctor! Where is the pouch Mr Sholmes was wearing?\nJuror No. 4:\nHm, well... ...the fellow had nothing like that on his person when he arrived at the hospital as far as I remember.\nVan Zieks:\nIf I may...\nRyunosuke:\nLord van Zieks...?\nVan Zieks:\nWhile I realise it is forbidden for the prosecution to interject during a summation examination... ...I should inform the defence that I have the pouch in question in the antechamber outside the courtroom.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nVan Zieks:\nAs I understand it, when the police arrived on the scene and found Mr Sholmes injured... ...they removed the pouch in order to assess the wound.\nJuror No. 4:\nAh! Thank goodness. I thought I was getting forgetful for a moment!\nVan Zieks:\nSince then, it has been in my safekeeping along with all other evidence relating to the case. I can personally vouch for the fact that it has not been touched since the incident occurred.\nJudge:\nVery well. While extremely unconventional during a summation examination... ...I must demand the prosecution presents the item in question with all speed.\n\nBring forth Mr Herlock Sholmes's pouch!\n\nJudge:\nHm, I see... So this is the pouch worn by Mr Sholmes on the night in question, is it?\nRyunosuke:\nLook at that! One of the phials is broken and the leather around it is scorched black! It's almost as if...the phial exploded!\nJudge:\nExploded?\nRyunosuke:\nSo...that night... ...the bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun struck Mr Sholmes's pouch.\nJuror No. 4:\nAnd it was the glass phial exploding that caused the fellow's injury!\nJuror No. 6:\nThe bullet did not penetrate wictim, but was deflected into wall of shop.\nVan Zieks:\n......... ...A delightfully complex aroma.\nJudge:\nWell, it would appear one mystery has been solved at least.\nVan Zieks:\nThough it has no bearing on the truth of this case.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nThe bungling and burgling brothers shot the detective, and the accused shot the pawnbroker. The pertinent facts of the case remain unaltered.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...\nJuror No. 4:\nBut at least the mystery is solved! I can sleep easy tonight! Thank you, young man!\nJuror No. 6:\n...Da. 'Thank you wery much.'\nRyunosuke:\n...Glad I could help.\nJudge:\nDue to its bearing on the conundrum just solved, the court will sequester this scruffy pouch as evidence.\nIris:\nHurley's pouch isn't scruffy!\nSholmes's pouch has been entered into the Court Record.\nJudge:\nNow, the summation examination... It would appear the defence is somewhat struggling to alter opinion, hm?\nRyunosuke:\nPlease, My Lord! A little more time. (After all, that's a new piece of evidence. It could be a valuable clue. And you can't afford to overlook anything here, Ryunosuke. There's still a way to turn this around...somehow. I'm sure of it!)\nChanges Juror No. 4's statement to \"Now the mystery of where that bullet ended up has been solved, I feel much better.\"Before Sholmes's Pouch is added to Court Record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(Van Zieks has managed to convince everyone...)\nIris:\n'When you have eliminated the impossible...' he said. But he hasn't!\nRyunosuke:\n(If we're going to fight back, we need more material. And we have to fight back! We have to turn this trial around again!)After Sholmes's Pouch is added to Court Record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIris:\nHurley always turns up at just the right moment!\nRyunosuke:\n...Does he always come in the form of a pouch? (Seriously though, it sounds like the great detective was on death's door. But maybe his injuries won't be for nothing. That pouch could be a very valuable clue.)Ryunosuke:\nHere it is. We discovered it just now. Yes! On the night in question in Windibank's pawnbrokery...another bullet was fired!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nWhat is this new trickery, you Nipponese conjurer?! Where did you find that bullet?Ryunosuke:\nIt was lodged inside Mr Sholmes's pouch.Van Zieks:\nWhat?!Ryunosuke:\nThis pouch was removed from around Mr Sholmes's waist before he was taken to hospital. And since then, it has been touched by no one.Judge:\nDo, do you mean to say... ...the shot fired by the Skulkin brothers that night...Ryunosuke:\nYes. As your Lordship has surmised...it hit this pouch.Judge:\nBut that makes no sense whatsoever! We already know the whereabouts of the bullet fired at Mr Sholmes. It's clearly visible in this photographic print!Juror No. 1:\nAh!Ryunosuke:\nTwo guns from the scene have already been submitted into the Court Record as evidence.Judge:\nYes. That of Mr Windibank, and that belonging to the Skulkin brothers.Ryunosuke:\nAnd examination of both guns revealed... ...that only a single bullet had been fired from each.Juror No. 2:\nAh!Juror No. 3:\nBut, but that must mean...Ryunosuke:\nThat's right. We now know that on the night in question, three bullets were fired. However! Only two bullets were fired from the guns recovered from the crime scene! And until that incontrovertible inconsistency is somehow explained... ...we cannot and must not pass judgement!Van Zieks:\nAgk......... AAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge:\nOrdaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! While this summation examination remains incomplete, the court has been presented with new facts. Facts that would appear to shake the very foundations upon which the case against the defendant has been built.Van Zieks:\n...!Judge:\nAs is my prerogative in this situation... ...I hereby temporarily suspend the summation examination.Juror No. 1:\nBy Jupiter!Ryunosuke:\nWhat?!Judge:\nBailiff! Bring the witnesses back to the stand at once!Judge:\nWitnesses...Nash:\nGuvnor!Judge:\nWere you listening to proceedings while the defence carried out the summation examination?Ringo:\nWe woz, guvnor, we woz!Van Zieks:\nPerhaps we can dispense with the tedious preamble. Simply answer this one question: A third bullet has been identified at the scene of the crime. ...What do you make of that?Nash:\nMake of it, guv? I dun't make nuffin' of nuffin' if I can 'elp it. Um...Van Zieks:\nIs it one of yours?Ringo:\nGorblimey, guv, gorblimey! Not a chance!Van Zieks:\nIn that case...did you have an accomplice?Nash:\nWot?! Eh? Wot?! Never! The Skulkin bruvvers work alone!Ringo:\nIt's just the two of us! That's our trademark!Ryunosuke:\n(...How soon we forget poor Sulky...)Van Zieks:\nOnly two of the bullets from the crime scene originated from the firearms we have in evidence. The third bullet was fired from another gun. ...Where is it?Nash:\nLummy...that's an 'ead-scratcher... .........Judge:\nHmmm... Counsel for the Defence...Ryunosuke:\nY-Yes?Judge:\nI should like to hear your thoughts regarding these new developments. The third bullet...and the mysterious missing firearm from whence it came.Ryunosuke:\n(Thinking back over all the testimony we've heard and all the evidence we've seen... ...I think I'm starting to form a picture. A picture of what really happened that night.) My Lord, I think it's clear what this third bullet tells us about the Skulkin brothers:They had a secret accomplice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nOn that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been working with a third man.\nNash:\nErm...\nRyunosuke:\nThe witnesses are clearly doing their best to cover up the existence of this accomplice... ...but the evidence all points to the fact that there was someone else present! Someone carrying a gun!\nVan Zieks:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...An accomplice, you say?\"They had another gun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nOn that night at Windibank's pawnbrokery...the brothers must have been in possession of another gun.\nNash:\nErm...\nRyunosuke:\nWe know that only one bullet was fired from each of the two firearms already in the Court Record. The logical conclusion, therefore... ...is that the brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun!\nLeads to:\n\"...An accomplice, you say?\"It's nothing to do with them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nI believe...it has nothing to do with them.\nNash:\nEh?\nRingo:\nEh, Nash, eh! That's right!\nNash:\nYeah! Nuffin' to do wiv us, guv!\nRyunosuke:\nWe've established that one bullet was fired from each of the two guns already known to the court. The logical conclusion therefore, is that on the night in question at Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...there was another person present in possession of a third firearm.\nVan Zieks:\n...!\nRyunosuke:\nWhilst the brothers may have had nothing to do with the third gun or the bullet fired from it... ...it's inconceivable that they had nothing to do with the third man. Yes! The brothers were working with an accomplice! An accomplice who was carrying a gun!\nLeads to:\n\"...An accomplice, you say?\"Van Zieks:\n...An accomplice, you say? Pigswill.Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nThese protracted proceedings have already forced us to endure two summation examinations. Yet in all that time, there has been not a murmur of a third man. If this apparently wraithlike being exists... ...the court must be shown hard evidence! Without it, this fantasy will be crushed.Ryunosuke:\nAgh!Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution demands answers on two counts: Firstly: proof - evidence - that this accomplice was ever at the scene of the crime. And secondly... ...the identity of this spurious character.Ryunosuke:\n(The Skulkins are lying. I know that. But... ...how can I ascertain the identity of the person they're hiding?)Judge:\nWell, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\n......... (I'm supposed to prove the existence of this accomplice... and reveal the person's identity, even...) In response to the prosecution's demands, My Lord, the defence is...Ready to present answers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe defence is ready. I believe I can provide all the answers the prosecution demands.\nVan Zieks:\nSo, my Nipponese friend, despite the swimming eyes, you seem to think you have something to say. This promises to be interesting.\nRyunosuke:\n(I have to push forward now. There's no other option. I need to use every single piece of evidence available to me if it will make a difference...)\nLeads to:\n\"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Unable to present answers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe defence is... .........\nVan Zieks:\nUnable to complete a sentence, it would seem. Much less provide any credible answers here.\nJudge:\nYes, it would appear so. Very well, this trial will now-\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWait! Please!\nJudge:\nGood gracious, Counsel!\nRyunosuke:\n(I have to keep the momentum going here. I can't give up now!)\nIris:\nThis is just like scientific research if you ask me.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nIris:\nWhen you start doubting yourself and thinking you can't possibly work something out, you become blind. Even though in truth, the answer you're looking for is right there in front of you.\nRyunosuke:\n(The answer...is right here in front of me!) ...My Lord! Actually...the defence would like to present answers to the questions posed by the prosecution.\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nSo, my Nipponese friend, despite the swimming eyes, you seem to think you have something to say. But your earlier tongue-tied display will not go unpunished.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh... (Now I wish I'd bit my tongue instead of speaking before I'd made up my mind. It would have hurt less.)\nLeads to:\n\"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Judge:\nIn that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay. On the night in question, in the moments leading up to the death of the victim... ...what proof have you that there was a third intruder present at the scene?Present Blood Samples Portfolio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The evidence is right here...in this portfolio.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe evidence...is this!\nJudge:\n...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.\nRyunosuke:\nAh.\nVan Zieks:\nMy learned friend has a knack for it, My Lord. It seems presenting nothing as though it were something is a favourite trick of the Nipponese conjurer.\nRyunosuke:\nAAARGH!\nIris:\nWell...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally.\nRyunosuke:\nThe kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...)\nLeads back to:\n\"In that case, Counsel, I would ask you to present the evidence without delay.\"Ryunosuke:\nThe evidence is right here...in this portfolio.Judge:\nBy Jove! That portfolio again, is it?Van Zieks:\nDo you expect the court to rifle through your papers itself? Be more specific!Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nYou claim one of those blood samples proves the presence of this third intruder. Well, which one is it?Present Windibank's Main Shop sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What am I looking at here?\"Present any other sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nTHIS is the blood sample that proves it!\nJudge:\n...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.\nRyunosuke:\nAh.\nVan Zieks:\nYou would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen.\nRyunosuke:\nAAARGH!\nIris:\nWell...I think it takes a certain genius to give such a completely wrong answer, personally.\nRyunosuke:\nThe kind of genius I could really do without. (Time to think again...)\nLeads back to:\n\"You claim one of those blood samples proves the presence of this third intruder.\"Judge:\nWhat am I looking at here? There appears to be some green paint or suchlike around the bullet hole in the middle of the calendar.Ryunosuke:\nThat's a bloodstain, My Lord.Judge:\nA bloodstain?Van Zieks:\nGreen blood? Curious, even for you. Is the court to understand that the intruder was some unhuman creature?Ryunosuke:\nIt's...something developed by Mr Herlock Sholmes.Juror No. 3:\nBy the great detective!Juror No. 5:\nNew invention! Stop. Not yet appeared in stories! Stop.Iris:\nIt's this, you see. It...doesn't have a name yet, though. This fogger sprays a chemical that reacts with the different elements in people's blood to change its colour.Judge:\nDifferent elements...of people's blood...?Iris:\nYes. Everyone's blood is slightly different, you see. Because it's made up of different elements. So by seeing what colour it changes to, you can tell in a flash whose blood it is!Juror No. 3:\nOoh! That brings a whole extra dimension to looking at blood!Juror No. 5:\nTalk of blood in courtroom! Stop. Very exciting! Stop.Ryunosuke:\nAs an example, this one shows the blood of the victim, Mr Windibank.Judge:\nAh... A striking blue.Ryunosuke:\nYes. So you see, the green colour of this bloodstain on the calendar... ...shows that somebody else was shot in the main part of the shop!Juror No. 1:\nNow hold fire there, young man! Could be from some unrelated incident, couldn't it?Ryunosuke:\nNo. It's not unrelated.Juror No. 1:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nThe date showing on the calendar is the date on which Mr Windibank was killed.Juror No. 1:\nBy golly!Ryunosuke:\nTherefore we can assume that whoever was shot, was shot on the same day.Juror No. 4:\nThen whose blood is it?!Ryunosuke:\nWell, the Skulkin brothers in the stand don't appear to be suffering from any gunshot injuries... Which means it must be the blood of somebody else. The third intruder, in fact.Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nWhose identity the court is still waiting to hear. You can't delay this any longer, my learned friend. Who is this alleged third intruder?Present Eggert Benedict profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The man's name...is Eggert Benedict.\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThere can be no doubt! THIS is the shadowy accomplice the brothers have been trying so hard to protect!\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nA lottery? Is that how you decide who's guilty?\nRyunosuke:\nHm?\nVan Zieks:\nIn that case, the name Ryunosuke Naruhodo should be added to the draw. For being guilty of incompetence!\nRyunosuke:\nGAAAAAAGH! (...And I bet my lot would be drawn, too.)\nIris:\nThe identity of this accomplice is our trump card, Runo. \nRyunosuke:\nYes...I, I expect it is...\nIris:\nAt this point, we're the only ones who know the person's identity. But it's time to stun the courtroom now! Let's give everyone something to think about!\nRyunosuke:\nYes... YES!\nLeads back to:\n\"You can't delay this any longer, my learned friend.\"!Ryunosuke:\nThe man's name...is Eggert Benedict.Judge:\nEggert Benedict?! Who on earth are you talking about, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\nHe paid a visit to Windibank's pawnbrokery on the afternoon before the incident took place.Van Zieks:\nWhen the accused attempted to deceive the pawnbroker into releasing this article into her possession.Ryunosuke:\n...That's right.Van Zieks:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nThe man identified by the defence, Mr Eggert Benedict... ...then attempted to take the article from the defendant by force.???:\nBroker!Windibank:\nUm, yes, sir????:\nI believe this filthy pocket thief has just redeemed an article from you, no?Windibank:\nYes, yes, erm...???:\nThe article in question belongs to me. I demand for it to be returned at once.Gina:\nNow that's a lie! Wot are you tryin' to pull????:\nGive me back my overcoat, you wastrel. And needless to say... ...any music box disks, too.Ryunosuke:\nInspector Gregson was there at the time, and can attest to what happened. In the end, it was the inspector himself who took the disk.Judge:\nCan you corroborate this account, Inspector?Gregson:\nErm, yes, My Lord. That's more or less what happened. And in the interests of bein' thorough, I asked Windibank for a print showin' the fellow. Taken from one of his 'Red-Handed Recorder' gubbinses.Ryunosuke:\n(Yes! That's him talking to Mr Windibank that morning.)Judge:\nAnd you claim this man is the brothers' accomplice?Ryunosuke:\nWell, Mr and Mr Skulkin?Nash:\n......... Never seen the geezer before in me life!Ringo:\nOn me life, guv, on me life! Never seen 'im!Judge:\nWell...somewhat unsurprisingly, it appears our witnesses disagree with the assertion.Van Zieks:\nI'm sure Your Lordship recalls my learned Nipponese friend's actual assertion. Which was that he could prove the identity of the alleged accomplice.Ryunosuke:\nYes, and I can!Juror No. 3:\nThen show us the evidence!Juror No. 2:\nI agree! We must see proof that the clean-cut gentleman in the photograph is the filthy criminal you say he is!Ryunosuke:\n......... (This is the last piece of evidence... I've had a feeling that something has been missing in this trial from the very start. But now...I'm going to drag it kicking and screaming into the courtroom!)Judge:\nAre you ready to present your answer to the court then, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\nYes, My Lord. The defence will present the evidence now. Proof that the man pictured in this photographic print was in fact the person struck by the third bullet!Present Music Box Disk (after examining bloodstain during trial)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question...\"Present Blood Samples Portfolio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThat proof is right here, in this portfolio!\nJudge:\nGood gracious, Counsel! Does that portfolio contain the answers to every question posed?\nVan Zieks:\n...I see you share my interest in claret-coloured liquids, my Nipponese friend. But... Enough. The court demands to see further evidence.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nWhich blood sample proves the man you identified was the one shot by the third bullet at the scene of the crime?\n\n\n\nPresent Music Box Disk sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"As I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question...\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent any other sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nTHIS is the blood sample that proves it!\nJudge:\n...You perplex me, Counsel, by looking so pleased with yourself despite this quite displeasing answer.\nRyunosuke:\nAh.\nVan Zieks:\nYou would do well to take your irrelevant specimens of blood and go back to whence you came. And I'll see to it that you go down in this court's history as an equally irrelevant specimen.\nRyunosuke:\nAAARGH! (It has to be a sample that links the bloodstain at the scene to Mr Benedict...)\nIris:\nIn other words, we need a sample of blood that turned the same colour as that bloodstain.\nRyunosuke:\n(Another green sample? ...Did we have one of those?)\nIris:\nI think perhaps you should have another look through everything, Runo.\nRyunosuke:\nRight. I might need to go over the evidence again. (Where else did we notice a bloodstain?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Enough. The court demands to see further evidence.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nHere it is! This is the irrefutable evidence!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, Counsel, but I fail to see the connection.\nRyunosuke:\nOh.\nVan Zieks:\nIt seems my learned friend is wide of the mark...again. In fact...he has just shot himself in the foot!\nRyunosuke:\nGYAAAAAAGH! (I'll have to try that one more time. Even though my foot is killing me here...)\nJudge:\nI might remind you, Counsel, of the gravity of the choices you make in this courtroom. Think very carefully.\nLeads back to:\n\".........\"Ryunosuke:\nAs I mentioned before, on the afternoon of the day in question... ...the defendant attempted - deceitfully, admittedly - to reclaim this disk from Windibank's.Judge:\nWhich is when the aforementioned Eggert Benedict appeared on the scene, I believe. This man then attempted to purloin the article from the defendant's possession, no?Ryunosuke:\nThat's correct, My Lord. I myself was present at the time. It was following this that a minor incident occurred.Windibank:\nBut of course, sir. Here is the disk for you.Benedict:\n......... Very well. Then I shall bid you farewell. ...Say goodbye to style.Gina:\nWait a minute! That disk... ...is mine!Benedict:\nArgh! What, what do you think you're doing, you little tramp?! You've...you've drawn blood, you filthy animal!Ryunosuke:\nBeing a music box disk, it has countless small but sharp metal protrusions over its surface. Those protrusions caused Mr Benedict's finger to bleed. And the resulting smear of blood is still visible on the disk now.Judge:\nGoodness! A bloodstain, is it?Ryunosuke:\nMy assistant and I have just analysed the bloodstain here in this very courtroom.Iris:\nUsing...my trusty fogger gun!Ryunosuke:\nYes. And we added the results to this portfolio.Juror No. 1:I say!Juror No. 2:It's green!Juror No. 5:It's exactly the same colour as the blood around the calendar!Ryunosuke:\nThe evidence is conclusive! The man calling himself Mr Eggert Benedict, who was in Windibank's earlier in the day... ...is the accomplice who was present at the scene of the crime that same night!So there was someone else there!\nLook at those two brothers now! They're sweating buckets!Oi! Who are you talkin' about? ...It's boilin' in 'ere!Ryunosuke:\nMy Lord! It is the opinion of the defence... ...that Mr Eggert Benedict...should be summoned to the courtroom to testify!Judge:\nHmmm... It would certainly seem that we can ill afford to ignore this gentleman's apparent presence.Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\n...This has gone on long enough now. This flagrant ignorance of the mechanics of law.Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nHerlock Sholmes, you say? Yes, I've heard the name. The protagonist in a series of short stories for the vulgar classes. A god of detection or some such.Iris:\n...!Van Zieks:\nAnd now you employ chemical substances devised by this fantastical persona in the highest court in the land? Do you expect us to take you seriously? The samples made by this plaything are not fit to be called evidence.Judge:\nHmmm...Van Zieks:\nSo the bloodstain turned a shade of green. What of it? Here's to you successfully proving that no other blood in the world would turn the same colour.Ryunosuke:\nAh...well...Van Zieks:\nAnd pray, do not even think of suggesting that we should take Mr Sholmes's word for it!Ryunosuke:\nUgh...Is he right? Is Mr Sholmes's concoction a load of rubbish?\nI don't know... I mean, he is a great detective.What are you talking about?! We can't let him get away with that!Ryunosuke:\n......... (I knew it would come to this. Of course Mr Sholmes's invention isn't going to be recognised by any official body. But...what other choice did I have...?)Iris:\nHm... I'm just remembering what Father Christmas over there said before. About how he was temporarily suspending the summation examination.Ryunosuke:\nAh!Iris:\nIn other words... ...the examination isn't over yet, is it?Judge:\nG-Good grief! What did you just say, young girl?Iris:\nAnd in a summation examination, the decision as to whether or not the trial continues... ...is in the hands of the six jurors, isn't it?Van Zieks:\n...!Iris:\nSo the way I see it... ...it doesn't matter what certain other people think of Hurley's invention. At least, not for now!Ryunosuke:\nYes! (She's right!)Judge:\nYoung lady, you have quite the devious mind!Iris:\nIt really just comes down to one thing: Whether these ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...are convinced by what you say, Runo! ...Is that about right, would you say? Or did I misunderstand something?Ryunosuke:\n(Unbelievable! Mr Sholmes's partner is a force to be reckoned with!)Iris:\nIris Wilson...sharpshooter!Judge:\nAfter that shrewd precis of the situation from an entirely unexpected source... ...it must be acknowledged that the previous summation examination has yet to reach its conclusion.Van Zieks:\nThis is absurd!Judge:\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury, the court now looks to you for your final leanings in this matter.Juror No. 1:\n...!Juror No. 2:\n...!Judge:\nAs proud citizens of Her Majesty's Britain, I'm sure you will come to fair and just conclusions.Juror No. 3:\n...!Juror No. 4:\n...!Judge:\nSo then, state your final decisions in turn, please.Juror No. 1:\nNot guilty!Juror No. 2:\nNot guilty!Juror No. 3:\nNot guilty!Juror No. 4:\nGuilty!Juror No. 5:\nGuilty!Juror No. 6:\nNot guilty!Judge:\nTwo call guilty, and four call not guilty. Such is the outcome of the summation examination.Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nMy Lord, with all due respect, this is an outrage! The prosecution refuses to accept this decision!Judge:\n...On what grounds?Van Zieks:\nIf these jurors are persuaded by some half-baked concoction devised by a pretender to real police work... ...then they are too ignorant to be trusted with the judgement of anyone's guilt.Judge:\nI'm sorry, Lord van Zieks, but the outcome of the summation examination cannot be ignored. This trial will continue!Van Zieks:\nAgk......... AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!Judge:\n...Nevertheless, we find ourselves in a rather awkward situation. The defence has very reasonably requested the subpoena of a new witness. But sadly, I fear that will be impossible.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?Judge:\nThe name the gentleman gave for himself - Eggert Benedict - is quite clearly false.Ryunosuke:\n(I don't believe it! Just when I'd managed to prove the man was there that night...)???:...Um... Could, could I say something?Judge:\n...? Who was that, please? Who spoke?Juror No. 5:\nUm...it was me, My Lord.Ryunosuke:\n(Juror number five...?)Judge:\nWhat have you to say, madam?Juror No. 5:\nIf possible...Inspector...Gregson:\nEh? ...Me, ma'am?Juror No. 5:\nI wonder if you might show the photographic print to me again? The one in which the gentleman is shown.Gregson:\nAh, right, yes. This one, you mean? Of Mr Benedict?Juror No. 5:\n......... ......... .........Yes... There's no doubt in my mind.Ryunosuke:\nJuror number five, you don't mean to say... You know this man?Juror No. 5:\nYes, I know him.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?!Van Zieks:\nNo!Judge:\nGOOD GRACIOUS!!! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Juror number five! How on earth...?Juror No. 5:\nI am a communications officer. Stop.Ryunosuke:\n...As we can clearly see...Juror No. 5:\nThe gentleman in the photograph is... Stop. ...also a communications officer. Stop. He works in my office. Stop. A very talented operator in fact! Stop. He should be in the communication station now. Stop. Tapping away on the telegraph. Stop.Ryunosuke:\n(This doesn't seem right somehow... I can't put my finger on why, but...it doesn't feel right.)Iris:\nHm... I suppose we all imagined the accomplice would be some sort of hardened criminal. It's...a bit unexpected to find out that he has a respectable job by day, whatever he gets up to at night.Ryunosuke:\nYes...I suppose that's it. (I suppose that's why I felt something was wrong...)Judge:\nIf the gentleman is at London's communication station, we should be able to subpoena him within the hour. Lord van Zieks, if you please...Van Zieks:\n...Yes, My Lord?Judge:\nMake the necessary arrangements with all haste!Van Zieks:\nAs Your Lordship bids.Judge:\nThe court will recess for one hour. When the new witness arrives, we shall reconvene to hear the gentleman's testimony. Inspector Gregson...Gregson:\nYes, My Lord?Judge:\nI should like to hear from you specifically about events at the pawnbrokery on the day in question. Come to my chambers during the recess.Gregson:\nYes, sir, My Lord.Judge:\nVery well... Court is adjourned until 1:40 p.m.!To be continued...17th April, 12:41 p.m.\nThe Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberRyunosuke:\nAh, Gina. How are you holding up?Gina:\n.........Ryunosuke:\n(I'm starting to feel quite warmly towards her frequent cold shoulders now.)Iris:\nGinny! Are you alright? Why aren't you saying anything?Gina:\n......... Wot's the point, eh? Why go to all this trouble an' fight so 'ard...for the likes o' me?Iris:\nWhat?Gina:\nWell you saw it! That picture.Ryunosuke:\nWhat picture?Iris:\nAh, you mean this? The photograph taken by Hurley's Red-Handed Recorder. Well, I didn't think it would have captured a scene like this, that's for sure!Gina:\nIt's 'opeless. Anyone who sees that's gonna think I did it, ain't they?Ryunosuke:\nWell...I won't pretend it wasn't a bit of a shock when the prosecution first presented it to the court.Gina:\nSurely you've gotta 'ave yer doubts about me now. Ya can't still think I'm innocent.Ryunosuke:\n......... Of course I can.Gina:\nHmph.........Iris:\nGinny...why don't you talk to us? Tell us what really happened that night.Gina:\nEh?Iris:\nRuno's cleverly managed to piece together a lot of new information, but still... ...we'd really like to hear it from you.Gina:\n......... Alright then. It was after we'd 'ad that dinner together at your place, right, Iris? Then we all 'ad a chat up in your office, didn't we?Ryunosuke:\nYes, I remember.Gina:\nAfter that, I just couldn't get to sleep. So I slipped out an' went down the street to the two-to-one. To Windibank's place. ...I 'ad to know.Ryunosuke:\nIf Iris's story was there or not? 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'.Gina:\nI dunno wot it's about or nuffin'... ...but if you ask me, there's somefin' in it that Sholmes don't like. Somefin' wot 'e don't want people readin'. So that's why 'e lied to Iris about stickin' it in lug wiv Windibank for safekeepin'. At least, that's wot I thought at the time.Ryunosuke:\nSo you broke into Windibank's?Gina:\nI just 'ad to know if it was there or not. I mean, I 'ad no idea all o' that was gonna kick off, did I? I struck the lock and snuck inside. It was dark as you like in there. So I gave the oil lamp on the counter a bit o' wick. And that's when...What d'you think you're doing?!AAAAAAGH!Gina:\nI nearly died, I did! And the next thing I knew... ...I'd grabbed the gun off the counter and was wavin' it in the air like...I dunno wot.Ah...you're the girl who was in here this afternoon. I didn't think pickpockets went in for armed robbery.The, the mantelscript... 'Ave you got it 'ere? Did Sholmes leave a load o' papers wiv you? A story.Windibank:I beg your pardon?Gina:'The Hound o' the...' somefin'-or-other. If it's 'ere, I wanna see it!Windibank:I'm sorry, young lady... ...but I'd sooner die than relinquish an article belonging to one of my customers.Gina:I don't want it! Wot would I do wiv it anyway? I just...wanna see it's 'ere, that's all.Windibank:Oh, you want to see it, do you?Gina:I wanna know if Sholmes really pawned it 'ere or not. Please! Just let me see it an' I'll go.Windibank:......... Oh, very well then. But for pity's sake, stop waving my gun around, would you?Gina:\nSo then the old cove unlocked the storeroom door, and we both went inside. And it was there alright. The mantelscript. Sholmes weren't lyin' after all.Iris:\nYou did all that just to check for me, Ginny?Gina:\n...Anyway, then there was a bit of a kick-up out in the main bit o' the shop.Ryunosuke:\nThe Skulkin brothers arriving on the scene, yes.Gina:Wot was that noise? Someone's breakin' in!Windibank:Dear me, is there some burglars' convention here tonight that I don't know about?Gina:...I think I forgot to shut the door be'ind me. Sorry.Windibank:I'd better go and take care of it. Could I possibly have my gun back?Gina:Oh, well I'll come wiv ya and-Windibank:Now don't be foolish, young girl. You must stay right here. Don't leave this room under any circumstances.Gina:\nAn' wiv that, 'e took the gun out of me 'ands and walked back out into the shop. I 'ung back in the storeroom like 'e said, strainin' me ears in the dark to 'ear wot was goin' on. It sounded like they got into a bit of a scrap. I started to think I should 'elp, see. So I was just about to go out the storeroom myself, when...*BANG!**BANG!*Gina:\nI 'eard a couple o' shots go off. Two, I think. Almost at the same time. And then there 'e was, right at me feet. Lyin' face down on the floor! I was right next to the storeroom door, so I slammed it shut an' locked it quick as ya like.Ryunosuke:\nBecause you thought whoever had shot Mr Windibank might come for you?Gina:\nYeah. So I went to grab the old cove's gun. I figured I'd put up a fight at least. But when I got a better look at 'im, I knew... ...Windibank was a goner. I felt funny in me 'ead all of a sudden. Kind of dizzy. And after that...I don't remember nuffin'.Ryunosuke:\nThat must be when you passed out, Gina.Gina:\n......... If...if I 'adn't done wot I done... ...the old cove might still be alive!Ryunosuke:\nDid you tell the police everything you just told us?Gina:\n'Course I did! But they didn't believe a word of it, did they? All they said was, if I kept tellin' lies, it'd make things even worse for me. .........Iris:\nIt'll be alright, Ginny, don't worry. Just stay strong a little longer. Runo's about to put the real culprit through the mill!Gina:\n......... That cove wot was there in the afternoon? That Eggert Benedict...I still remember 'ow 'e looked at me. Like I was nuffin'. 'E...'e was there that night.Ryunosuke:\nWe don't know his real name yet... ...but I'm convinced that he's involved somehow.Gina:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nAnyway, thank you for telling us what happened, Gina. I appreciate your honesty.Gina:\nYou wot?Iris:\nYou can leave it all in Runo's capable hands now, Ginny!Gina:\n......... Mr Narra-'Oddo...Ryunosuke:\nYes?Gina:\n...'Ow come you trust me? I don't get it.Ryunosuke:\n.........Gina:\nI mean, 'ave you forgotten wot 'appened 'ere before? Come on, it was only two months ago. Me and McGilded...we told you a whole pack o' lies. An' you got the bogtrotter off wiv 'em! Even though 'e was a killer!Ryunosuke:\n......... No, I could never forget that.Gina:\nOh...Ryunosuke:\n(I did what I thought was best at the time. But the pain of that error of judgement doesn't get any easier to bear.) Still, don't forget that I also made you a promise. I told you that I'd be on your side to the bitter end, no matter what.Gina:\nBut wot if I'm lyin'?! You could be workin' to get another killer off the 'ook for all you know!Ryunosuke:\n......... I was once in your position, Gina. I was the accused in a trial.Gina:\nYou were?Ryunosuke:\nBefore I left Japan. I was accused of murder. And strange as it might sound, the circumstances of the crime were pretty damning. I was sure that no one would believe it wasn't me who'd done it.Iris:\nOh, Runo...Ryunosuke:\nBut there was one person who stood up for me. Who believed in me, and was prepared to defend me. My best friend.Ryunosuke, no one believes in you more than I do. Leave this to me. All you need to do is put your faith in me, and I'll do the rest!Ryunosuke:\nI was so happy, I cried. But even then... ...somewhere inside me, I couldn't help thinking: 'Surely he doesn't really believe in me. Not completely.'Gina:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nBut...I was wrong.As soon as my trial began, it was obvious... ...that he had an absolute, unwavering belief in me. And in turn, I developed an absolute, unwavering belief in him.Ryunosuke:\nSince then, I came to realise... ...if you want someone to believe in you, you have to believe in the other person first.Gina:\nWot are you sayin'...?Ryunosuke:\nI promise you, Gina, that no matter what happens, I'll keep believing in you. So you don't need to worry. I won't let you down.Gina:\n......... Even though I'm a diver? ...And a no-good liar?Ryunosuke:\n......... You're not like McGilded. I know that.Gina:\nEh?Iris:\nThat's right! You're our friend, Ginny!Gina:\nI-Iris!Ryunosuke:\nWe know you better than you think. And we've come to the conclusion that you're someone we can trust.Iris:\nYes!Ryunosuke:\nThat's really all we need to know.Iris:\nExactly!Gina:\nUm...Mr Narra-'Oddo, I, um... I... *Sniffle, sniffle*Bailiff:\nDefendant Gina Lestrade and her legal representative! Court proceedings are about to resume. Please head into the courtroom immediately!Ryunosuke:\nYes, of course! Thank you.I'd been both a defendant and a defending lawyer in my time. So I knew only too well... ...just how hard it was to put all your faith in another. And I also knew... ...just how hard it was to bear the burden of another putting all their faith in you. (This is it at last. The final chapter. The final battle. Wish me luck, Susato-san... And I hope you're watching over me too...partner!)17th April, 1:41 p.m.\nThe Old Bailey CourtroomJudge:\nI hereby call this court to order as we resume the trial of Miss Gina Lestrade. Lord van Zieks, have you successfully subpoenaed the witness?Van Zieks:\nThe subpoena was delivered to the communication station where the man works immediately, My Lord. However, the heavy rain has delayed the arrival of his carriage, it would seem.Judge:\nHm, I see. Then let us turn our attention to Inspector Gregson's precis of the case heard by the court this morning. The glaring omission of the third bullet in your report is a serious blunder, Inspector.Gregson:\nYes, um, I can only apologise, My Lord.Judge:\nAnd although the defence's chemical analysis of the blood at the scene makes for a compelling argument... ...I cannot permit such untried methods to be used as evidence in my courtroom.Iris:\nHmph! It's a big mistake to cross Hurley and me. A very big mistake!Bailiff:\nMy Lord! The subpoenaed witness has just arrived in the building.Judge:\nThank you, Officer. Show him to the stand without delay.Ryunosuke:\n(Mr Eggert Benedict... I didn't expect to be crossing paths with him again so soon. And certainly not like this.)Judge:\nThank you for complying with the court's subpoena at such short notice, sir.???:\nBut of course, My Lord. As an upstanding member of London society, it is my pleasure to oblige.Judge:\nNow, kindly state your name and occupation for the record.Graydon:\nAshley Graydon, communications officer.Juror No. 5:\nMr Graydon and I both work at London's central communication station.Graydon:\nNow perhaps somebody would kindly explain what all this is about?Van Zieks:\nYou were apprised of the situation by the court officer on your way here, I presume.Graydon:\nYes, I was. Something to do with a murder that took place at a pawnbroker's on Baker Street. And some nonsense about me having been there on the night in question.Van Zieks:\nThat is the accusation, indeed.Graydon:\nThis really is beyond a joke, you know.Judge:\nVery well. Without further delay, the court will hear your testimony now, Mr Graydon. You will respond to the accusation made against you under oath.Graydon:\nGladly, My Lord. Gladly.Witness Testimony\n- The Accusation -Graydon:\nNaturally, I have occasion to make use of pawnbroking services from time to time.\nBut are you seriously suggesting I colluded with these thugs to break into the place on the night of the murder?\n...I have no intention of admitting to such an outrageous accusation.\nEven if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.\nSome scaramouch detective's homebrewed tincture can hardly be taken as serious evidence.Judge:\nSo...you deny the accusation completely, do you?Graydon:\nI must say, I am dismayed. For the highest court in the land to be swayed by this self-professed detective's toy...Van Zieks:\nIt was the will of the jury. And our great British justice system demands that the jury's will is upheld.Graydon:\nThen it would seem we have the misfortune of a most inept assembly of jurors today.Juror No. 1:\n...! By golly!Graydon:\nHow long am I expected to be detained here?Judge:\nIf, following the defence's cross-examination, your involvement in this matter has not been established... ...you will be free to leave immediately.Graydon:\nGood. Then I shall be away in time for afternoon tea. Some small consolation at least.Judge:\nLet us not hold up Mr Graydon any longer than necessary, Counsel. Proceed with the cross-examination.Ryunosuke:\nSo...we meet again, Mr Eggert Benedict. Or is it Mr Graydon?Graydon:\n......... My apologies. You are...?Ryunosuke:\nRyunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer. We have met.Graydon:\nIf you say so. Ashley Graydon. Enchant\u00e9. So...Ryunosuke:\nAgh!Graydon:\n...I trust we can conclude this quickly.Ryunosuke:\nUgh...

Because I certainly do not feel inclined to answer such an inappropriate question.\nRyunosuke:\n(So he's going to be evasive, is he? In an effort not to give anything away.

Who made this outlandish accusation against me?\nVan Zieks:\nThe young lawyer there in the black.\nGraydon:\nThis is a farce! Whose idea was it to permit an outsider to work in a British court anyway?\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nGraydon:\nWell, needless to say...Graydon:\n...I have no intention of admitting to such an outrageous accusation.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWhere were you at around one in the morning on the night in question, sir?\nGraydon:\nThat is past the hour at which I would normally retire. Certainly... ...I was not in the company of these rapscallions.\nRyunosuke:\nYou're able to prove that?\nGraydon:\n.........\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nListen carefully, my learned Nipponese friend... ...for you appear to be under a gross misapprehension on this point.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat do you mean?\nVan Zieks:\nThe witness maintains he was not at the scene of the crime. He has no obligation to prove his absence. If your accusation is that the witness was present at the scene... ...the obligation lies with you to prove your assertion.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nYou will fulfil that obligation before putting any more unreasonable questions to the witness.\nRyunosuke:\n(A silent victory wiggle. Thanks.)Graydon:\nEven if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBlood was found at the scene of the crime. There's no question of that. Mr Sholmes's chemical analysis has positively identified the substance as such.\nGraydon:\nBut I am not the only human to have blood running through my veins, am I? How can you be sure that the blood is mine? It could equally be the blood of one of these two miscreants.\nRyunosuke:\nEvery individual's blood has a slightly different composition, it seems. Mr Sholmes's chemical is able to differentiate different blood samples by-\nGraydon:\nSpare me the science lesson! ...Who is this Sholmes character anyway?\nRyunosuke:\nOh. I, I assumed all Londoners would know the name. He's a grea- Well, a renowned detective.\nVan Zieks:\nSo, even you are unable to bring yourself to say 'great detective'.\nGraydon:\nA great detective, you say? Tsk! Now we're in the realm of fairy tales, are we? The counsel for the defence thinks a British courtroom is an appropriate place for fairy tales, does he?\n\n\n\nPursue Nash Skulkin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nDo you have something to say about that, Mr Skulkin?\nRingo:\nEh? Wot? Me?\nRyunosuke:\n...No, the Mr Skulkin next to you.\nGregson:\nRight, I've had it up to here with this! How many times have I gotta tell you?\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I know. You're not 'Big Bruv Sulky'. Mr Nash Skulkin!\nNash:\nEh? Cor blimey, guvnor! You wot?!\nRyunosuke:\nIs it not the case that when Mr Graydon just spoke, a thought went through your mind? Would you care to share that thought with the court?\nNash:\nEh? Me thoughts? I dun 'ave none o' them! It must've been 'im!\nRingo:\nYou wot?!\nRyunosuke:\nMr Nash Skulkin! ...Answer the question, please. What went through your mind when Mr Graydon just spoke?\nNash:\nNuffin'! Honest, guv! Nuffin'! I, I woz just thinkin'... ...if 'e waves 'is arm around like that much more, it'll open up the wound again, that's all!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat wound?\nNash:\nWhere 'e took the bullet, o' course! It woz only two days ago. It ain't gonna be 'ealed up yet! So I woz, um... Well, ya know... I woz worryin' for 'im, and... ......... Oh, 'ell's bells!\nRyunosuke:\nMr Graydon! Did you hear that?\nGraydon:\nWhat?\nRyunosuke:\nYour comrade is worried about you, it seems. ...On account of your injured arm.\nGraydon:\n......... My Lord.\nJudge:\nYes, Mr Graydon?\nGraydon:\nI have no idea what these two wretches are talking about. Certainly, I shouldn't be expected to answer anything in relation to their mindless insinuations.\nJudge:\nHmmm...\nRyunosuke:\nWe know that someone other than the victim was hit by a bullet at the scene of the crime two nights ago. And from the height of the bullet hole in the wall, that person was likely hit in the upper arm or thereabouts.\nGraydon:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nPerhaps you'd allow a court official to examine your arm, sir? The left arm that you're currently clasping with your right hand, as if in pain!\nGraydon:\n......... No. ...I refuse.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nGraydon:\nYou have shown no evidence whatsoever that links me to these common thieves. Accordingly, I am not obliged to permit any such invasion of my privacy! As I've already said, I'm completely uninvolved in all this. I've never had anything to do with the pawnbrokery where this fellow was killed whatsoever! I take offence at the insinuation that I was in any way involved!\nJudge:\nHm...you claim to have had nothing whatsoever to do with Mr Windibank's pawnbrokery?\nRyunosuke:\nMy Lord! The defence would like that last statement to be added to Mr Graydon's formal testimony.\nJudge:\nVery well, Counsel. Continue with your testimony, My Graydon.\nGraydon:\n.........\nRemoves statement \"Even if certain parties here present claim that my blood was found at the scene.\"\nAdds statement \"The bottom line is, I've never had anything to do with the pawnbroking establishment where the man was killed!\"\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...\nIris:\nArgh! This is so unfair! That chemical test is based on solid science! Hurley and I know what we're doing!\nRyunosuke:\nThe trouble is, unless the technique can be independently verified... ...we'll never get beyond this man's flashy stick-waving.\nGraydon:\nGranted, it is a very colourful alchemy. Perhaps it would make a good souvenir for your uneducated friends back home in the East.\nRyunosuke:\n(Something riled him there. Just for a moment, Mr Graydon let his feathers get ruffled...)\nGraydon:\nBut a souvenir is all it's good for.Graydon:\nSome scaramouch detective's homebrewed tincture can hardly be taken as serious evidence.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nDon't forget, sir, that Mr Herlock Sholmes is the most famous detective in the world.\nGraydon:\nAnd the most famous detective in the world tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, hm?\nRyunosuke:\nErm, well, um... (Oh no! I can't think how to answer that!)\nVan Zieks:\nI once saw the world's most famous swindler thrown into jail. He allegedly told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but...what turned out to be a pack of lies.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...\nGraydon:\nQuite. Now... ...as you are no doubt aware, the central communication station is the heart of this country's information network. My work there is of paramount importance. And you have kept me from it for long enough already.Graydon:\nThe bottom line is, I've never had anything to do with the pawnbroking establishment where the man was killed!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nNever had anything to do with it? You forget that I was there, Mr Graydon! On the very afternoon of the incident!\nGraydon:\n...Obviously, I am not a complete stranger to the pawnbroker's. I'm currently on the lookout for an armchair to furnish my study.\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nNo! You were there to redeem an article!\nGraydon:\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n\n\nPursue Tobias Gregson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nDo you have something to add, Inspector?\nGregson:\nEh? Come again, sunshine?\nRyunosuke:\nYou were there, too, in fact, weren't you, Inspector? That afternoon.\nGregson:\n......... Well yes, I do remember meetin' yourself in the pawnbroker's that afternoon. You, your young Japanese assistant, and the accused were all present, as I recall.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd at that time, this witness, Mr Graydon, was trying to acquire a particular article...\nGregson:\nUm...well now...\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nGregson:\nI'm afraid I don't remember too clearly.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! But, but you must!\nGregson:\nI'm not going to lie and pretend I remember somethin' that I don't.\nRyunosuke:\n...! (What's going on here?)\nIris:\nGregsy showed us a picture before, didn't he? You know, from the cameras that Hurley installed in Windibank's.\nRyunosuke:\n...Yes, of course.\nJudge:\nIndeed. And the gentleman pictured bears a striking resemblance to the witness, I must say.\nRyunosuke:\nExactly! Which proves that Mr Graydon was in the shop on the afternoon in question!\nGraydon:\nAt no point have I denied that fact.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nGraydon:\nI merely entered the shop to peruse the articles on sale and have a word with the broker. Nothing more.\nGregson:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n(This makes no sense. I understand why Mr Graydon might be trying to cover his tracks... ...but why would Gregson be trying to avoid giving testimony about what happened?)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nGraydon:\nYou must be confusing me with somebody else. I wasn't there for any such purpose.\nRyunosuke:\nBut, but the redemption article!\nIris:\nThat won't get you anywhere, Runo.\nRyunosuke:\nIris! ...What do you mean?\nIris:\nMr Windibank never wrote the names of his customers on his redemption tickets. So you can't prove the ticket was his.\nRyunosuke:\nAh! (Of course... She's right.)\nIris:\nI'm afraid... ...you're going to need to produce some irrefutable evidence here. Otherwise he'll never admit to being there.\nRyunosuke:\nHm...irrefutable evidence...Present Music Box Disk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Have you ever seen this disk before, Mr Graydon?\"Before correctly pursuing Nash Skulkin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(That's all he's going to say on the matter, is it?)\nIris:\nWhat do you think, Runo?\nRyunosuke:\nI think he has no intention of telling us anything. He's well aware that the less he says, the less chance he has of giving himself away.\nIris:\nHm... The complete opposite of Hurley, then. He seems to think that the more he says, the better.\nRyunosuke:\nI need to find a way of getting more information out of this man somehow... (But compared to the bungling burglars beside him, he seems as innocent as a child.)\nIris:\nOr perhaps the Skulkin brothers might be the key here?\nRyunosuke:\nOh... (Could they be somehow...?)\nIris:\nRemember, if you don't prove this witness has some connection to the incident here, he'll be free to leave.\nRyunosuke:\nI know. I can't let that happen. (Let's listen to those statements again and see if there's any way I can make one of them tell us more.)After correctly pursuing Nash Skulkin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(That's all he's going to say on the matter, is it?)\nIris:\nWhat do you think, Runo?\nRyunosuke:\nI think he has no intention of telling us anything. He's well aware that the less he says, the less chance he has of giving himself away.\nIris:\nHm... The complete opposite of Hurley, then. He seems to think that the more he says, the better.\nRyunosuke:\nWell, at least I managed to prise a little more information from these witnesses' lips. All thanks to the Skulkin brothers...\nIris:\nYes! They were the key to it after all!\nRyunosuke:\nSo he says he had nothing to do with Windibank's... (Well, we know that's not true.)\nIris:\nPerhaps now would be a good time to have a proper look through the Court Record.\nRyunosuke:\nGood idea. You never know what tiny scrap of information could become a valuable weapon...Ryunosuke:\nHave you ever seen this disk before, Mr Graydon?Graydon:\n......... Why? Is it supposed to mean something?Ryunosuke:\nThis disk was, until the day of his murder, in pawn in Mr Windibank's shop. It was redeemed by the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade that afternoon. However... ...somebody mysteriously appeared to try to take it from her. And that somebody was you, of course. Wasn't it, Mr Graydon?Graydon:\nAs I have reiterated numerous times now...you are mistaken. That was not me. I've never seen that disk before in my life.Ryunosuke:\nIt may have escaped your notice, but there is a small smear of blood on the disk.Judge:\nAh yes. Resulting from an abrasion of the thumb, perhaps?Ryunosuke:\nThat's right. The surface of the disk is covered in hundreds of tiny metal bumps. In the skirmish to acquire the disk, the thumb of the person who tried to take it suffered minor lacerations.Graydon:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nSo! While the disk bears the remnants of that skirmish in the form of this smear of blood... ...the thumb of the person in question must bear the remnants also. In the form of a scratch!Judge:\nGood gracious! Indeed it must!Ryunosuke:\nMr Graydon!Graydon:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nYou refused to allow a court officer to examine your arm before. Are you now going to refuse to allow us to examine your thumb? Because I have no doubt that it bears a small scratch consistent with the smear of blood on this disk!Graydon:\n...! ......... Well well... ...it would seem I underestimated you.Judge:\nWhat, what is the meaning of this?Ryunosuke:\nSo you admit it now? You admit you have a scratch on your thumb from when you attempted to take the disk from the defendant?!Judge:\nOrdaaar! Orrrdaaar! ...Well, Mr Graydon?Graydon:\n...It would appear there has been something of a misunderstanding here. I did not attempt to take the disk, as you put it. No, quite the reverse.Ryunosuke:\nWhat are you trying to say?Graydon:\nIt's really quite simple, you see. The disk was mine from the outset. Is there some crime in taking an item that you own out of pawn?Ryunosuke:\nWhat?!Van Zieks:\nIt would seem, Mr Graydon... ...that in this piece of evidence, my learned friend has established a link between yourself and the incident. Accordingly...you will tell the court everything you know about this disk now.Graydon:\n...As you wish. Though I'm quite sure it has nothing whatsoever to do with the pawnbroker's murder.Witness Testimony\n- The Disk -Graydon:\nThere's a note on the disk saying, 'For McGilded', but the item belongs to me.\nThe redemption ticket was stolen from me by the accused - that filthy gutterling - on the day in question.\nI proceeded at once to the shop in order to explain my situation and redeem my article.\nIn the end, of course, the disk was taken by the police.\nIn other words...I had absolutely no reason to break into the shop later that same night.Judge:\nDid I hear you correctly, sir? 'McGilded', you say? The famous London philanthropist? Who perished in this very courtroom two months ago after being acquitted of a distinctly messy murder?Graydon:\nYes, My Lord. The one and the same.Judge:\nGood Lord! Mr Graydon! Are you saying that Mr McGilded and yourself were acquainted?Graydon:\n......... Yes. That's correct.Judge:\nOrdaaar! ...Well. I certainly didn't expect to hear that name uttered here in my courtroom again.Ryunosuke:\n(According to what Gina told us, this disk was placed in pawn on that fateful night two months ago. McGilded himself gave instructions to deposit it at Windibank's.)Iris:\nIt's funny that Mr Graydon here is claiming the disk belongs to him then, isn't it?Ryunosuke:\nIn all likelihood, he's lying. (So he appeared that afternoon at Windibank's in order to get his hands on McGilded's disk for some reason...)Judge:\nCounsel, you will commence your cross-examination, please.Cross-Examination\n- The Disk -",

However, I did once find myself in difficulties having misplaced my purse whilst on an errand. Which is why I pawned my fine black overcoat to the broker in question.\nRyunosuke:\nYou claim that was your overcoat?\nGraydon:\n...Obviously. And in my haste, I clean forgot... ...that the music box disk was in its pocket.\nVan Zieks:\nAnd yet there is a note on it that reads, 'For McGilded'.\nGraydon:\nI am a collector of rare and unusual music box music. I first met Mr McGilded at a gentlemen's club in the city, and was interested to discover... ...that he shared my penchant in that area.\nJudge:\nSo the disk in question...\nGraydon:\nIt's a pre-production sample. I promised to let Mr McGilded hear it.\nVan Zieks:\nBut then you forgot that it was in the pocket of the overcoat you were forced to pawn.\nGraydon:\nYes, exactly.\nIris:\nGina didn't mention any of that in her testimony two months ago, did she?\nRyunosuke:\nNo. Because McGilded had threatened her to keep her mouth shut. Which means that if we dig too deeply here... ...it's going to expose Gina's perjury.\nIris:\nOh dear...this is complicated, isn't it?\nRyunosuke:\n(Let's leave it alone for the time being...)Graydon:\nThe redemption ticket was stolen from me by the accused - that filthy gutterling - on the day in question.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo you're saying that Miss Lestrade lifted the ticket from your pocket or bag?\nGraydon:\nThat's right. Despite being mindful of danger when walking in the insalubrious areas her kind frequent.\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nMiss Lestrade did no such thing!\nGraydon:\nWell of course you would take that stance. But the girl is a regular offender.\nRyunosuke:\nYou came to the pawnbrokery that day prepared with all the information you needed to identify the defendant. You were looking for her. That's what brought you to Windibank's. To get your hands on Mr McGilded's disk!\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nMy learned friend is a veritable font of nonsense.\nRyunosuke:\nN-Nonsense?\nJudge:\nI concur with the prosecution. Counsel, you will refrain from conjecturing in this way. Is that clear?\nRyunosuke:\nYes...My Lord.\nGraydon:\nThen I will continue with my testimony, for what possible use it can be...Graydon:\nI proceeded at once to the shop in order to explain my situation and redeem my article.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nHad you ever been to Windibank's before?\nGraydon:\nOnly once for the purposes of pawning something. But, like many, I enjoy browsing in such establishments.\nVan Zieks:\nSo when you noticed that the pickpocket had taken your ticket, you chased after her. Is that correct?\nGraydon:\nYes, that's right. I didn't notice at first, of course. Such is the art of the pickpurse. But when I did, I headed to the pawnbrokery at once. In order to reclaim my coat before the thief could. I was merely trying to recover what was rightfully mine in the first place.\nRyunosuke:\n(Argh! He can say what he likes because he knows we have no evidence to contradict him on this!)Graydon:\nIn the end, of course, the disk was taken by the police.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYes, it was taken by Inspector Gregson here, wasn't it?\nGraydon:\nThat's right. This was the very man. Apparently the police are collecting anything that has a connection to Mr McGilded. As evidence. That's what the inspector said, at least, as he seized my disk. And thanks to the skirmish with that wastrel, I snagged the end of my thumb at the same time.\n\n\n\nPursue Tobias Gregson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nIs something wrong, Inspector?\nGregson:\nErm, well, erm... What d'you mean?\nRyunosuke:\nThe last remark Mr Graydon made in his testimony seemed to trouble you in some way.\nGregson:\nEh? No. No it didn't. It's nothin'. Leave it alone.\nRyunosuke:\nLet me ask you this, Inspector: Why is Scotland Yard gathering Mr McGilded's possessions?\nGregson:\nI can't tell you somethin' like that, sunshine!\nVan Zieks:\nWhat is it, Inspector? Investigative secrets?\nGregson:\nYes. Exactly. You should know all about that!\nVan Zieks:\nMagnus McGilded, who died so...unexpectedly after his trial two months ago. A man renowned throughout the capital for his great contributions to public life. Yet he had a dark side, too...\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nGregson:\nWhere are you goin' with this, van Zieks?\nVan Zieks:\nI suppose the police are dealing with the aftermath of his nefarious activities, are they?\nGregson:\n...That's enough! Coppers like me have duties to carry out that we're not at liberty to talk about. That's all you need to know.\nVan Zieks:\nDuties conferred by Lord Stronghart, I presume. The Lord Chief Justice appears to have great faith in you, Inspector.\nGregson:\n......... The bottom line is, if you wanna get more out of me... ...you're gonna need Lord Stronghart's pawprint first!\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n(What's all this about? It's like there's something going on between Gregson and Lord van Zieks here...)\nJudge:\nWell, it would appear that the inspector has revealed all he is at liberty to reveal. Mr Graydon, let us return to your testimony.\nGraydon:\nGladly, My Lord.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\nVan Zieks:\nAnd the disk in question is this disk here?\nGraydon:\nYes, it is.\nVan Zieks:\nScotland Yard have indeed been gathering items believed to have been the property of McGilded. Presumably to aid their investigations in some way.\nGraydon:\nNot something I would be aware of. I really didn't know the man well, anyway. After all, I'm merely a communications officer with a penchant for music boxes.\nRyunosuke:\n(...And flamboyant poses.)Graydon:\nIn other words...I had absolutely no reason to break into the shop later that same night.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBut perhaps you'd seen something of value among the forfeited items?\nGraydon:\nNo, not at all.\nRyunosuke:\nOh.\nVan Zieks:\nA valuer was brought in by the police to assess everything in the shop. Without exception, every article on the shelves was common-or-garden bric-a-brac.\nRyunosuke:\nIn that case, it's clear... ...that you broke into the shop later that day in order to recover Mr McGilded's disk.\nGraydon:\nHave you not been listening, man? Even if I had wanted to recover the disk... ...you may recall that it had been seized by the police that afternoon! It was no more in the shop that night than I! As I keep saying, I simply had no reason to break in.\nRyunosuke:\n......... (So there was nothing of McGilded's left in the shop that night. Nothing this man might have been after. I wonder if that's really true...)\nIris:\nRuno, if you have some evidence... ...then let him have it! I'm dying to see that irritatingly assured expression of his crumble!Present Pawnbroker's Ticket (Box)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This disk was deposited at Windibank's on Magnus McGilded's instructions.\"Ryunosuke:\n(McGilded slipped the disk into his coat pocket and had it deposited at Windibank's. Then, when he realised he was going to be arrested on suspicion of the omnibus murder... ...he threatened Gina and forced her to take the redemption ticket.)Iris:\nThere's no doubt about it, that witness is lying through his pearly white teeth!Ryunosuke:\nThe police were obviously after anything left behind by McGilded as well. That's why Inspector Gregson ended up taking the disk into custody that day.Iris:\nBut Gregsy's being very strange about all this.Ryunosuke:\nThere must be a reason for that, I'm sure. I just don't know what it is. (For now, I need to focus on exposing the fact that Mr Graydon is lying in his testimony.)Ryunosuke:\nThis disk was deposited at Windibank's on Magnus McGilded's instructions. You knew that, and you went there with the intention of obtaining it for yourself.Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nConjecture again. And in any case, the disk was taken into custody by the police that afternoon. The witness had no reason to visit the pawnbrokery again that night!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nSorry, my learned friend...but that's not true.Van Zieks:\nWhat?Ryunosuke:\nMr McGilded had another article in pawn at Windibank's... ...as this second pawnbroker's ticket proves!Graydon:\nAh!Ryunosuke:\nThere were two articles belonging to Mr McGilded in Windibank's pawnbrokery. And the reason you broke into the shop that night was to recover the second one... ...together with your two accomplices, the Skulkin brothers!Graydon:\nAgh!Judge:\nHmmm... This is the second ticket, is it?Van Zieks:\nWhat had the man deposited?Ryunosuke:\nThe article description reads, 'one small box'.Judge:\nA rather vague description, it seems to me.Graydon:\nAre you suggesting that I broke into the pawnbrokery with these...clowns in order to steal some trinket box?Ryunosuke:\nI believe there are adequate grounds to suspect that you did.Graydon:\nThis is absurd! Why on earth would I do such a thing? Once the article had been forfeited, I could simply walk into the shop and purchase it. There would be absolutely no need for me to resort to theft!Ryunosuke:\n...! (That's a good point.)Judge:\nHm, indeed. The witness makes a solid argument.Iris:\nSo that means that for some reason... ...this Graydon fellow needed the small box that very night, does it?Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nIt's time to put an end to this nonsense, My Lord.Judge:\nCould you be a little less cryptic, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks:\nI do hate to ruin my learned friend's argument, but the truth is quite incontrovertible. On the night in question, no small box was taken from Windibank's pawnbrokery. And rest assured, the prosecution can prove it.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?!Judge:\nGood gracious!Van Zieks:\nInspector, show the photographic prints to the court, if you please.Gregson:\nYes, sir!Ryunosuke:\n(What prints?)Gregson:\nThese prints were taken from one of the detective's security cameras.Iris:\nAh, Hurley's Red-Handed Recorders again!Van Zieks:\nAs previously explained using this plan of the shop layout... ...the victim's establishment was furnished with automatic cameras in two locations. One was set to capture the counter where Mr Windibank received his customers... ...and the other was set to capture the shelves on which articles were placed for sale once forfeited.Gregson:\nAccordin' to the information on this ticket... ...McGilded's small box had been forfeited already. Two days before the incident, at 9 p.m. on 13th April to be precise. Which means it would have been on the shelves of forfeited items in the shop front. Now, what I have here is a print taken by one of the cameras about two hours before the incident. That's at 11 p.m. on 15th April.Judge:\nHm, the victim certainly had a very full shop, it would appear.Gregson:\nAnd then here we have another print... This one was taken about two hours after the incident.Judge:\nI see. So we have two pictures to compare. Though I must say that placing them side by side leaves me cold. Dear me, that's starting to make my head ache.Gregson:\nObviously, at Scotland Yard we considered theft as one possible motive in this case. We explored the possibility that something had been taken in addition to the victim's life.Judge:\nSo your men have already compared these two prints thoroughly, Inspector?Gregson:\nYes, sir! We counted every single item in each of these two photographic prints. And the Yard's conclusion is that exactly the same number are present in both!Judge:\nHmmm...Van Zieks:\nIn other words, nothing was taken from the pawnbrokery on the night in question. And my learned friend's assertion is nothing more than a hopeful fantasy!Ryunosuke:\nAAAAAAAAARGH! (I don't believe it! If I could have just shown that he'd stolen McGilded's pawned box... ...I might have been able to break him down at last.)Iris:\nYou know what, Runo... ...I've been thinking. I wonder if these two photographs really are exactly the same.Ryunosuke:\nWhat...?Judge:\nSo, Counsel...in the light of the evidence put forward by the prosecution, what is your position? It seems that in fact, on the night in question, nothing was stolen from the victim's establishment. Do you accept the prosecution's assertion?Ryunosuke:\n(I don't know... Could there be some hidden discrepancy in these two photographic prints somewhere?)There's no discrepancy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(However much I look at these two prints, I just can't see that anything went missing.) Yes, My Lord. I can see nothing wrong with the photographic evidence put forward.\nGraydon:\n.........\nJudge:\nVery well. In that case, the matter is settled.\nIris:\nNo! Wait, Runo! There's something out of place with these two prints, I'm sure of it.\nRyunosuke:\nIris!\nIris:\nWhat about that trick that we just learnt? We should use that now to really examine these two prints thoroughly.\nRyunosuke:\nAlright! Just, just uncross your eyes...please!\nJudge:\nCounsel... ...I've finally become accustomed to the wide-eyed star that so frequently occupies your countenance. But that crossing of your eyes is another matter entirely! I'm afraid I must penalise you for it.\nRyunosuke:\nAAAAAARGH! (This could be our chance to fight back. I suppose I should explore all avenues before I just accept the prosecution's position.

There is a clear discrepancy between these two prints!Van Zieks:\nWhat?!Judge:\nYou must identify the location in question for the court, Counsel. Indicate the precise location of the discrepancy of which you speak.Present round box on right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Granted, these two prints are almost identical.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nObviously the discrepancy...is here!\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nI must thank my learned friend. His answer has clarified the situation greatly. There is indeed a discrepancy here. Between our respective powers of reasoning.\nRyunosuke:\n......... Let me guess... My powers of reasoning come up short?\nJudge:\nIt would appear you're learning, Counsel. But not quickly enough.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh... (But I'm sure it's there. It's subtle, but there's a difference between those two prints. I know there is!)\nIris:\nDon't give up, Runo! You can do this!\nLeads back to:\n\"So, Counsel...in the light of the evidence put forward by the prosecution, what is your position?\"Ryunosuke:\nGranted, these two prints are almost identical. However, there is one minor discrepancy between them.Gregson:\nWHAT?!Ryunosuke:\nWhen you view the two pictures stereoscopically... ...a single area stands out as being different: the location of this small box.Van Zieks:\nLet me... Wait... Un-Unbelievable!Judge:\nBy Jove, you're right! How extraordinary!Ryunosuke:\nWhat this tells us is very simple! Mr McGilded's small box was indeed not stolen from Windibank's on the night in question. However, there can be no doubt... ...that somebody picked up this particular box and then returned it to its place on the shelves!Judge:\nAre you suggesting that the small box originally deposited by Mr McGilded is in fact...Ryunosuke:\nYes! The very same small box I just identified in those photographic prints!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nMindless guesswork! What if it was?Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nSo a box was moved on the shelf. Nothing was stolen. Which means quite simply...that nothing has changed.Ryunosuke:\nThat, that may be true, but... (Alright, McGilded's box wasn't stolen then... ...but doesn't the fact that it was moved like that change things?)It changes nothing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nNo, you're right. It changes nothing.\nGraydon:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n...! (Is that a smile on Mr Graydon's lips? Wait a minute... What am I saying? Of course it changes things!) ...Or so I thought at first! But actually, I'd say it changes everything! ...Well?\nVan Zieks:\nWell! It's changed your mind, certainly. And that capricious behaviour earns you a penalty, my learned friend.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh... (I really should have thought that through better.)\nJudge:\nBut, but Counsel... ...if nothing was stolen and all that happened was that this box was moved slightly... ...how can that possibly alter the state of affairs here in the courtroom now?\nLeads to:\n\"The crucial point is the fact that what was moved was a small box.\"It changes everything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nI believe...this changes everything about the case.\nVan Zieks:\nHow can that possibly be?\nLeads to:\n\"The crucial point is the fact that what was moved was a small box.\"Ryunosuke:\nThe crucial point is the fact that what was moved was a small box. In other words, we have to consider what might have been inside that box.Van Zieks:\nWhat are you suggesting?Graydon:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nI'm suggesting that we need to examine that box. As soon as possible! A vital piece of evidence is sitting on the shelves at Windibank's as we speak!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nThat won't be necessary! Some little box belonging to a man who died two months ago can't possibly be relevant to this trial!Judge:\nThe court does not uphold your objection, Lord van Zieks. Bailiff! Arrange for an officer to go to Baker Street at once. Obtain the small box in question and bring it back here for further examination!Judge:\nWe should have a report within half an hour. I think perhaps we should recess for a short while until the evidence is brought forth.Van Zieks:\nTo be hoodwinked by such a farce... Hmph. Disappointing.Judge:\nI beg your pardon, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks:\nThis is nothing but a smoke screen. A Nipponese speciality, it would seem.Ryunosuke:\nWhat are you trying to say?Van Zieks:\nMy learned friend has persisted with the same line of reasoning from the very beginning. That this witness's intent was to steal an article belonging to Mr McGilded from the pawnbrokery. Yet common sense tells us...that none of the articles have value enough to be worth stealing in the first place.Graydon:\nExactly! It would be beyond absurd to break into a place for the purpose of stealing such commonplace property.Judge:\nHmmm...Van Zieks:\nIf Your Lordship recalls, Mr McGilded perished two months ago, immediately after the conclusion of his trial. A trial in which he was found not guilty. A trial in which it was established he was the upstanding member of society his reputation implied, in fact. So I propose a toast. To my learned friend, and his most...insightful defence.Ryunosuke:\n...!Graydon:\nThe articles this upstanding member of society pawned were entirely ordinary. A black overcoat that just happened to have a music box disk in one of its pockets. And a small box. I assure you, I wouldn't accept even if the man tried to make a gift of such things to me.You know, that does make rather a lot of sense.\nIt's not as if it was gold or jewels, is it? Though goodness knows, Mr McGilded was rich enough!\nBut you can't deposit cash at a pawnbrokery. I'm quite certain of that.Judge:\n...The prosecution's argument is undeniably compelling.Van Zieks:\nIt is incumbent on the defence now to bolster its argument. To explain what possible significance these commonplace articles pawned by this fine citizen could have!Ryunosuke:\n...!Judge:\nWell, Counsel? Is your argument in fact demonstrable? Are you able to show proof that the disk or the box are in any tangible way related to this case?Ryunosuke:\nWell...erm... .........Iris:\nWhat's the matter, Runo? We know that they're related, don't we? They're both vital pieces of evidence!Ryunosuke:\nYes, of course. You and I both know that. We know McGilded's true character. And we know the disk is significant, even if we don't know why. But if we explain all that to the court at this point... ...we'll have to acknowledge that McGilded's acquittal two months ago was a mistake. That the defence's argument was flawed. Based on false information.Iris:\nOh no!Ryunosuke:\nAnd that would mean... ...admitting that Gina committed perjury.Iris:\nBut Ginny...Ryunosuke:\n(Could it be that van Zieks knows? Is that why he's doing this now? Because he anticipated everything?)Iris:\nBut maybe... ...this could be a great opportunity for us.Ryunosuke:\nSorry? What do you mean, Iris?Iris:\nWell, what is it that you always say, Runo? 'Sooner or later, the truth comes out. Every time!'Ryunosuke:\n...! (Alright, the exact significance of the things that McGilded deposited with Mr Windibank... ...is something that only Gina can explain to the court. But if I put her on the stand to testify about that... ...it could critically damage our chances of winning this case. What's the right thing to do here?)Have Gina testify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"My Lord, the defence would like to make a proposal.\"Leave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(No, I can't get Gina to testify about this. If I did, she'd be forced to admit that she is guilty of a serious offence already. And for a pickpocket like her, that would surely be the nail in the coffin as far as this trial is concerned.)\nIris:\nSo you're not going to call Ginny, then?\nRyunosuke:\nWell, to be honest, I was on the verge of deciding not to. But...we have to uncover the truth here. And in order to do that, we might have to suffer a few consequences along the way.\nIris:\nRuno!\nRyunosuke:\n(In other words, there's only one course of action for us to take here.)\nLeads to:\n\"My Lord, the defence would like to make a proposal.\"Ryunosuke:\nMy Lord, the defence would like to make a proposal.Judge:\nOh? What proposal, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\nWhile the court awaits the arrival of Mr McGilded's small box... ...I would like to call the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade, to the witness stand.Judge:\nThe defendant? To what end?Ryunosuke:\nIt's to do with the various articles deposited at Windibank's by Mr McGilded, My Lord. Miss Lestrade has information relating to them. I believe it would be beneficial for the court to hear what she has to say. It will prove the significance of the articles in question once and for all!Van Zieks:\nWell well...things are becoming interesting. I presume you've considered the implications of the testimony you're proposing? In particular, the impact it will have on the accused's standing...and indeed your own.Ryunosuke:\n......... I have.Judge:\nLord van Zieks? Would you care to explain that last remark?Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution accepts the defence's proposal. I move to interrupt the cross-examination of the current witness and hear from the accused herself!Judge:\n......... Very well, if you have no objection. So, the court will now hear the testimony of the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade. You witnesses currently in the stand may step down until further notice.Graydon:\nThen I shall bid you good day.Van Zieks:\nWait. You, sir, shall remain in the stand while Miss Lestrade testifies.Graydon:\n......... As you wish.Ryunosuke:\n(Alright then, Gina, it's time... I know this will be hard, but please! Put your faith in me here!)Iris:\nGood luck, Runo...Gina:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nThe articles that Mr McGilded had deposited in Windibank's pawnbrokery... ...are intimately related with the omnibus case, the trial of which was heard in this courtroom two months ago.Judge:\nYes... And I remember this young lady being brought before me in that trial as well.Ryunosuke:\nThat's right, My Lord. Her testimony helped to establish the innocence of the defendant, Mr McGilded.Gina:\n.........Van Zieks:\nThe omnibus case was...intriguing, to say the least. And now here we all are again. The same players in that trial facing each other once more. A twist of fate perhaps...my Nipponese friend.Ryunosuke:\n......... Allow me to recap the events of two months ago. An old brickmaker was stabbed to death in an omnibus running along London's winter streets. Apart from the victim, there was only one other person in the carriage: Mr McGilded. Naturally, he was the prime suspect for the murder. But as the trial progressed, another possibility emerged. That the murder in fact took place above the defendant's head on the roof deck... ...with the body then being dropped through the skylight into the carriage below. It was Miss Lestrade whose testimony brought that possibility to light. At the time of the incident, Miss Lestrade was concealed under a seat in the carriage... ...hoping to pick the pockets of unsuspecting passengers. Then, immediately after the trial, having being acquitted of the murder... ...Mr McGilded died in this very courtroom, in the most extraordinary of circumstances.Van Zieks:\nA mystery that remains unsolved even now, two months on. As indeed does the omnibus murder itself.Judge:\nBe that as it may... ...I recall neither the disk nor this 'small box' being mentioned in the course of those proceedings.Ryunosuke:\nMiss Lestrade...Gina:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nWould you tell the court now, please? What really happened in the omnibus two months ago, I mean.Gina:\n......... I dunno wot ya mean. I already said all of wot I know!Ryunosuke:\nAnd what about everything you told us yesterday from inside your prison cell?Gina:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nPlease, Miss Lestrade. This is extremely important.Gina:\nB-But...Van Zieks:\nRemember, little girl... ...if it transpires that you wilfully withheld information in the trial two months ago... ...the Home Office will seek to prosecute you for perjury.Gina:\n...!Van Zieks:\nAnd naturally, you will lose all credibility as a witness. Although, let's face facts... ...you have little credibility to lose.Gina:\n.........Iris:\nGinny, don't listen to him! Please! You have to trust Runo now!Gina:\nI-Iris...?Iris:\nWe're on your side!Gina:\n......... Alright then. ...I'll talk.Ryunosuke:\nIt's the right choice, Gina.Van Zieks:\nWell, it would seem that my learned friend... ...is hell-bent on bringing the entire courtroom down about his ears. ...So be it.Judge:\nI must confess that I'm struggling to understand what on earth is happening here. However, it would appear that Mr McGilded's pawned articles and that extraordinary case of the omnibus... ...harbour secrets of which we have been hitherto unaware.Gina:\n.........Judge:\nSo, Miss Lestrade, you will now give your testimony before the court about the events of two months ago. You will reveal the truth, a commodity sorely lacking in your original statements!Ryunosuke:\n(This is it, then. Everything's going to come out. Like van Zieks said... ...this could bring the whole courtroom down about my ears. But as a lawyer, I'm prepared to take that risk.)Witness Testimony\n- The Real Truth of the Omnibus Case -Gina:\nTruth is, that brickmaker cove was in the cabin o' the omnibus the whole time.\nWhen the Irishman dragged me out from under the seat, I saw that disk on the floor.\nAll of a sudden, I 'eard a scream from over me 'ead, an' that pair on the roof deck went off to call the slops.\nThat's when McGilded slipped the driver some tin to do a run to the pawn shop round about.\n...He threatened me not to snitch. Not to say nuffin' to no one about wot I'd seen or 'eard.Judge:\nGood grief, this is outrageous! What you've just told the court bears almost no resemblance to your testimony two months ago!Van Zieks:\nAs you say, My Lord.Judge:\nThen, then there's every chance... ...I may have adjudicated in error in McGilded's trial! It sounds very much to me as if the man deliberately deceived this court... ...in an effort to cover up the most wicked of schemes!Van Zieks:\nWithout doubt, Your Lordship is correct. A great injustice was done in this courtroom two months ago. The actions of the accused in that trial, of this witness...and of my learned friend are entirely inexcusable!I don't believe it!The whole trial was a farce? It was all lies?That McGilded fellow was rotten to the core! Just like that pickpocket!Don't forget that lawyer from the East! They were all in on it together!Gina:\nYer wrong, the lot o' ya! Mr Narra-'Oddo - the lawyer there - 'e didn't know nuffin' about it!Juror No. 1:\nHumbug!Juror No. 2:\nI don't think so. Are we really expected to believe that?Juror No. 4:\nHe really stitched everyone up, didn't he? What an operation, to get the man off scot-free!Juror No. 5:\nUnforgivable! Stop. The lies have to stop! Stop.Ryunosuke:\nYes, the defence made a terrible error of judgement. I intend to take full responsibility and suffer whatever consequences are deemed appropriate. ...However! It's imperative that the court allows the witness to elaborate on her testimony. Because the true significance of McGilded's pawned articles must be brought to light!Van Zieks:\n......... Very well...my learned student friend...Ryunosuke:\n...!Van Zieks:\nGiven the depths of calamity you have just plunged yourself into, this may well be worth hearing.Judge:\nWords fail me. This situation is...utterly deplorable. Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke:\nYes, My Lord!Judge:\nI will decide upon your fate following the conclusion of this trial.Ryunosuke:\nOf course, My Lord.Gina:\nBlimey, Mr Narra-'Oddo...Judge:\nNow, Counsel.

First there was a kind of rappin' noise.Gina:\nAll of a sudden, I 'eard a scream from over me 'ead, an' that pair on the roof deck went off to call the slops.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThere were two gentlemen occupying the seats on the roof deck, I believe?\nGina:\nThat's right. They must've looked down through the skylight an' noticed the cove wiv the knife in 'is guts. When they screamed, the driver pulled up the 'orses an' McGilded got me out o' sight.\n\n\n\nPursue Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson (if not already pursued; before all statements have been pressed without pursuing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nIs there something you'd like to share with the court, Inspector Gregson and Mr Graydon?\n\n.........\n\nRyunosuke:\nINSPECTOR!!! MR GRAYDON!!!\nGregson:\nWHA-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Blimey! You tryin' to give me a heart attack?\nRyunosuke:\nYou have been whispering to each other for quite some time now.

You think I've got anythin' to talk about with a shady gent like this?\nGraydon:\nAnd I have nothing to say to this uncouth detective after he deprived me of that disk that was rightfully mine.\nRyunosuke:\n(But they've clearly been talking the entire time I've been cross-examining Gina.

Once the carriage came to an 'alt, the two coves from the roof ran off to fetch the slops.\nVan Zieks:\nIf they immediately left to fetch the police, it would appear they were entirely unrelated to the incident.\nJudge:\nHmmm...\nRyunosuke:\nSo that left McGilded, the driver and you still at the scene.\nGina:\nYeah. Only the driver didn't know I was there cos I was under the seat. I 'eard the cabin door open, an' a voice from outside.\nJudge:\nThe driver, yes... He also testified in the trial, I believe. A fellow who went by the name of Beppo, if memory serves.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat did McGilded and the driver say to each other?\nGina:\n'I dunno wot 'appened,' an' stuff like that mainly.Gina:\nThat's when McGilded slipped the driver some tin to do a run to the pawn shop round about.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThat pawn shop obviously being Windibank's on Baker Street.\nJudge:\nJu-Just a moment, Counsel! Do, do you mean to tell me... ...that the driver gave false testimony in that trial as well?!\nVan Zieks:\nPerhaps the excursion to the pawnbrokery slipped his mind when he was in the stand.\nJudge:\nIndeed, Lord van Zieks!\nGina:\nMcGilded took off 'is coat an' gave it to the driver. 'E folded it up, all careful like, before 'andin' it over. When I saw 'im do that, I remember thinkin'... ...that coat an' wot's in it 'as gotta be worth a few bob.\n\n\n\nPursue Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson (if not already pursued; before all statements have been pressed without pursuing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nIs there something you'd like to share with the court, Inspector Gregson and Mr Graydon?\n\n.........\n\nRyunosuke:\nINSPECTOR!!!

I remember her quibbling with him over the price that afternoon at the pawnbrokery.)\nGina:\nThe driver looked pretty 'appy when McGilded flashed some brass in 'is face. 'E went runnin' off at a lick. Then the bogtrotter called to me and told me to come out from the drag's cabin.Gina:\n...He threatened me not to snitch.

And there was one other thing 'e said.\nVan Zieks:\nWhich was?\nGina:\n'E told me I'd 'ave to 'ang on to the ticket from the pawn shop. An' make sure not to lose it.\nJudge:\nThe ticket...? Well I never!\nGina:\nSaid that if 'e didn't show up to get the ticket off me before two months passed... ...I 'ad to go to the pawn shop and pay the money to keep it in lug. To stop it bein' forfeited. 'E left me wiv some brass to pay for it.\nJudge:\nBut really... ...why on earth would Mr McGilded have done such a thing? Depositing his overcoat with a pawnbroker before the arrival of the police... It makes no sense at all.\nRyunosuke:\nThere would seem to be only one logical explanation, My Lord. What McGilded had the driver deposit at Windibank's was something he didn't want the police to see. Something very important, that he needed to hide at all costs.\nJudge:\n...!\nGina:\nAnyway...after that, 'e let me go. So I legged it before the coppers showed up.Before pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(Well done, Gina. It can't have been easy to tell the truth like that.)\nIris:\nGinny's really put her faith in you, Runo.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, and to thank her, she'll have to face a charge of perjury once this trial's over. (So I need to use the time we have now to get as much information out of her as possible.)\nIris:\nIt's time to really go for it! Press her on every statement!\nRyunosuke:\nI, I suppose I should...\nIris:\nOh! And another thing...\nRyunosuke:\nWhat's that?\nIris:\nTake a look at those two. Isn't it strange that they've been whispering to each other the entire time?\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes, that is strange. It looks like they're having a secret discussion about something... I'm not sure if I'm completely comfortable with that. I wonder if there's anything I can do about it...)After pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(Well done, Gina. It can't have been easy to tell the truth like that.)\nIris:\nGinny's really put her faith in you, Runo.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, and to thank her, she'll have to face a charge of perjury once this trial's over. (So I need to use the time we have now to get as much information out of her as possible.)\nIris:\nIt's time to really go for it! Press her on every statement!After pressing all statements (without pursuing) and pursuing Ashley Graydon or Tobias Gregson:Judge:\nThank you, Miss Lestrade. Thank you, Counsel. I've heard enough. I believe we now have a reasonable understanding of what actually transpired on the omnibus.Van Zieks:\nIt would appear on that night two months ago, a negotiation was taking place on the omnibus. A negotiation concerning this disk. However, matters did not run smoothly. When the parties involved began to quarrel over price, McGilded took what he wanted by force... ...at the expense of the other man's life.Ryunosuke:\nWhich proves my point! The disk is clearly extremely valuable in some way! (Although I don't understand why as yet.)Van Zieks:\nAnd two days ago, precisely two months after the omnibus incident... ...McGilded's coat and its contents were due to be forfeited.Gina:\nI didn't know wot I should do wiv the ticket. I mean, the cove died right after 'is trial. I knew that.Van Zieks:\nSo you decided you would try to claim the articles as your own.Gina:\nWell why not, eh? They were only gonna be forfeited! Why shouldn't I 'ave got 'em? Anyway, ya can't blame me for thinkin' about it. Thinkin' ain't no crime!Judge:\nMiss Lestrade, it would appear Mr McGilded was prepared to kill in order to take possession of this disk. Do you know why that would be?Gina:\nEh? I ain't got a clue! But I reckon it must be worth a fair bit o' brass. 'E was probably gonna sell it. An' ya can't blame me for thinkin' that! Thinkin' ain't no crime!Judge:\nHmmm...???:My Lord!Bailiff:The evidence Your Lordship requested has been located and is ready for the court's inspection, sir!Ryunosuke:\n(The mysterious little box, deposited by McGilded two months ago... There's no doubt in my mind that it's a key piece in this far-reaching puzzle!)To be continued...Judge:\nSo this is the article in question, is it? The 'small box' deposited with the pawnbroker by Mr McGilded two months ago.Ryunosuke:\n...And on the night of Mr Windibank's murder... ...the only item on the shelves that was touched by whoever broke in to the shop.Iris:\nQuick, quick! Let's open it and see what's inside!Judge:\nGood gracious! This is no ordinary box, it seems!Ryunosuke:\n(Wow! ...Although in truth, I had an inkling that might be the case.)Van Zieks:\n...It would appear that the box houses a miniature music box movement.Graydon:\n.........Judge:\nThen...is it too much to expect...?Van Zieks:\nI think it would be reasonable to assume that it is a device for the playback of this disk, My Lord.Judge:\nSo, here we have the means to play back Mr McGilded's disk, deposited at Windibank's at much the same time.Van Zieks:\nNot strictly correct, My Lord. It was not McGilded's disk. It was the disk of his victim in the omnibus.Judge:\nBut why, for heaven's sake? Are we to understand that the brickmaker was trying to sell this music box disk to Mr McGilded?Ryunosuke:\n......... I believe the answer will become clear if we listen to the music on the disk, My Lord.Judge:\nYes, very well. Let the court now listen to this curious disk at last.Gregson:Gregson:\nWait! ...My Lord!Judge:\nGood grief! What is the meaning of this, Inspector?Gregson:\nThe music box and the disk are, um... Well they're unrelated to the case! No, no need to spoil the sombre atmosphere in the courtroom with some silly bit o' music...Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nThis disk may very well have motivated the culprit in this case to commit murder! Clearly there's every chance that it's fundamentally important to understanding what happened!Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution has no objection.Gregson:\nBut, but no! That piece of evidence is police property now! You can't-Van Zieks:\nClearly Scotland Yard has some vested interest here. But it is policy of this prosecutor to leave no avenues unexplored. And you, Inspector, have no jurisdiction here to prevent that from happening.Gregson:\nGA-AAAAAAAARGH!Judge:\nNo further delays, please. Play the disk!...........................Judge:\nWh-What on earth...? That's certainly not what I would call music.Ryunosuke:\n(No... It's just the same note playing over and over again in an irregular sequence...)Judge:\nHmmm...Graydon:\nHa ha ha ha ha...Judge:\nMr Graydon?Graydon:\nThis, this really is priceless! After all that, the music box is broken!Ryunosuke:\nBroken?! (It, it can't be, can it?)Graydon:\nWell obviously! In fact, I wouldn't be surprised... ...if the officer sent to fetch it didn't drop it on the way back to the courtroom.Judge:\nWell, with much regret... ...I feel the court must accept that this music box offers little in the way of clues.Van Zieks:\n.........Judge:\nAre you ready to move on, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\n(Come on...! Yes, alright, it does sound as though it's completely broken, but...is it?) Could this 'music' emanating from the music box possibly be a new clue?No way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nI agree that it doesn't appear to be relevant, My Lord.\nGraydon:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n...What prompted that triumphant wiggle?\nGraydon:\nNothing in particular.\nRyunosuke:\nReally?! Or was it because that 'music' is in fact a very significant clue?!\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nYou never learn, do you? When you speak, you must mean what you say. ...Or be prepared to suffer the consequences!\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...\nJudge:\nErm... Am I to understand that you do indeed consider this repetitive monotone to be relevant somehow? \nLeads to:\n\"It's an abomination, Counsel! Mere noise!\"It could be a clue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nI believe that it could be relevant, My Lord.\nJudge:\nGood Lord! But, but how can it be?\nLeads to:\n\"It's an abomination, Counsel! Mere noise!\"Judge:\nIt's an abomination, Counsel! Mere noise! I fail to see how it can have any meaning whatsoever.Ryunosuke:\n(It does sound strange, I agree. But there's one thing bothering me... While Graydon stands there chortling victoriously... ...the inspector beside him has a rather telling expression on his face. It's as if Gregson recognises the sound. As if he's familiar with it somehow... And that's making him appear extremely on edge.)Van Zieks:\nIf that's the stance of the defence, my Nipponese friend, answer me this...Ryunosuke:\nOh!...........................Van Zieks:\nJust what relevance do you propose this woeful chiming has on this case?Ryunosuke:\n......... It's the defence's belief that the sound emanating from this music box is...Broken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nClearly the music box is broken in some way!\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nGraydon:\n.........\nJudge:\nCounsel... ...I feel you are perhaps floundering in your non-native tongue, but 'broken' is tantamount to irrelevant here.\nVan Zieks:\nIndeed. And here's to your own irrelevant noise, my learned friend!\nRyunosuke:\nNaaargh! (The music, or whatever you want to call it, has to be relevant somehow. ...Which might actually be the point!)\nVan Zieks:\nLet's see if you grasp the question better next time around...\nLeads back to:\n\"...........................\"An unusual genre of music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nIt could be an unusual genre of music that none of us are familiar with!\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nGraydon:\n.........\nJudge:\nCounsel... ...would you care to elaborate on that remark?\nRyunosuke:\nWell, it...it could be a new style of music that's about to take the world by storm, for example!\nJudge:\nI think not, Counsel. Such monotonous nonsense could be pleasing to no one's ear, surely.\nVan Zieks:\nWell said, My Lord. And here's to my learned friend seeing that remark's true meaning!\nRyunosuke:\nNaaargh! (The music, or whatever you want to call it, has to be relevant somehow. ...Which might actually be the point!)\nVan Zieks:\nLet's see if you grasp the question better next time around...\nLeads back to:\n\"...........................\"Not supposed to be music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Just because this is a music box, it doesn't necessarily mean the sounds we're hearing are music.\"Ryunosuke:\nJust because this is a music box, it doesn't necessarily mean the sounds we're hearing are music.Graydon:\n...!Ryunosuke:\n(Look at that. The smile vanished from Graydon's lips as soon as I said it. I'm on the right lines here. I must be!)Iris:\nHehe, making deductions based on how people react to what you say... You're acting just like Hurley, Runo!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nThe sounds we're hearing aren't necessarily music? Well, now that you've told us what they are not... ...I'm sure the court would like to hear what they are. Do enlighten us, my Nipponese friend.Ryunosuke:\n...! Well, um...Van Zieks:\nSurely you have an idea in mind? Because if not... ...it will be the death of your ill-formed argument!Graydon:\nExactly. The music box is clearly broken. Refusing to accept that fact is pure foolishness!Ryunosuke:\n(They've got me! I don't know what the answer is...yet!)Iris:\nUm, Runo... ...I've just examined the music box very thoroughly... ...and I'm fairly certain that it's not broken at all.Ryunosuke:\nReally?!Iris:\nReally. The way it's been made, it can only produce a single note anyway.Ryunosuke:\nThank you, Iris!(Alright, well if the music box isn't broken... ...it must mean that the sounds it's producing have some significance that isn't musical. ......... Ah! Could it be...? Is that what these sounds are?!)Iris:\nSomething's just struck me, Runo. I feel like recently - in the past few hours even... ...I've heard another sound very much like the one this music box makes.Ryunosuke:\n......... (Yes, it's a familiar sound.) Actually, Iris... ...I was just thinking exactly the same thing.Judge:\nI'm going to have to press the defence for an answer. If your assertion is that the sound produced by this music box is not in fact music at all... ...then what the devil is it, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\n(All the evidence we've seen so far... All the testimony we've heard... It's all pointing to one single answer now!)Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution demands that my learned Nipponese friend presents proof now! Tangible proof of this latest, wild speculation!Ryunosuke:\n......... Alright then. (This could be the best chance I'm going to get to fight back in this trial. And if I'm right, it's going to join all the dots together!) The evidence that explains the true nature of the sounds on this music box disk is...Present Today's Paper (after examining picture on back)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Today's paper, Counsel?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nObviously it's this!\nJudge:\nI'm afraid to say, Counsel... ...that you were being rather optimistic with that leading 'obviously' there.\nRyunosuke:\n......... If I'm honest, as I thumped my hands down just now... ...I had an inkling that it was going to hurt me more than the bench.\nVan Zieks:\nWell. At least one of your 'inklings' was correct, then.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh...\nIris:\nThat arrhythmic tinging sound the music box makes is definitely familiar somehow.\nRyunosuke:\nIt's almost like some sort of code... The question is how to show that the tinging sound has a connection to this case. (Perhaps I should have a good look through all the evidence in the Court Record again.)\nIris:\nI'm going to have a good look through the Court Record again too, I think!\nLeads back to:\n\"The evidence that explains the true nature of the sounds on this music box disk is...\"Judge:\nToday's paper, Counsel? The headline is 'Pawnbroker Perishes in Pickpurse Plunder!' ...Hardly supportive of your cause.Ryunosuke:\nAh...no, My Lord. I was hoping you'd look a little further down the page...Judge:\nFurther down? 'Ministry Mole? Classified Secrets May Have Been Leaked Overseas From Ministry of Justice'... Yes, this is a very serious matter, being investigated at the highest level, I understand.Van Zieks:\nI have heard that international transmissions along supposedly secure lines are somehow being intercepted... ...and leaked to various other countries.Ryunosuke:\nAnd presumably...those transmissions are in the form of wired telegrams?Van Zieks:\nOf course.Ryunosuke:\nJuror number five! Your input, please!Juror No. 5:\n......... Stop. Oh! M-Me, sir? Whatever is the matter?Ryunosuke:\nYou told the court before that you worked at the same communication station as Mr Graydon, did you not?Juror No. 5:\nY-Yes, that's correct.Ryunosuke:\nAnd the particular station where you work... ...deals with government communications and newspaper reports?Juror No. 5:\nOh, yes! We're not your run-of-the-mill communication station at all. Our work is extremely important.Ryunosuke:\nThen tell me...is this not a very familiar sound?Juror No. 5:\nHm...? ......... You, you don't mean to say...? Is it...?Ryunosuke:\nThat's right, madam. It bears more than a passing resemblance to the sound made by your telegraph machine as you tap it. I believe it's called...Morse code?Juror No. 5:\nBut... I don't believe it!Ryunosuke:\nNow correct me if I'm wrong...but when it comes to leaking telegrams from government departments... ...there could be nobody more perfectly placed than a highly skilled communications officer!Van Zieks:\nAre, are you suggesting that the music box disk... ...contains stolen government secrets in Morse code?!Judge:\nOrdaaar! Ordaaaaaar! Please, everyone! Ordaaar!!! But this... This is... This is high treason, Counsel! Deserving of capital punishment!Juror No. 6:\nToo much new wocabulary! What is this 'treason'? And what is 'capital punishment'?Ryunosuke:\n(The sorts of words I'd half expect you to know...)Judge:\nFor our sovereign government's confidential information, hostile nations would surely pay almost any price!Ryunosuke:\nYes...and on that night two months ago... ...that was the very negotiation that was taking place inside the omnibus!Van Zieks:\nBut in the end, McGilded perished, and the all-important disk lay unclaimed in the pawnbrokery...Judge:\nMy word!Ryunosuke:\nIn which case... ...whoever stole that information in the first place must surely have been beside himself with worry. Because if the disk were to be discovered before it found its way out of the country...Judge:\n...It would reveal an act of high treason punishable by death!Ryunosuke:\nSo the culprit had no choice but to retrieve it. And in order to do that... ...he would have to gain entry to the pawnbrokery illegally in the middle of the night. Because the article left behind by Mr McGilded would incriminate him too much if it got into the wrong hands. Isn't that right...Mr Graydon?!Graydon:\n......... You, you think I've been stealing government secrets? Preposterous! Absolutely preposterous!Judge:\nSo, in response to the defence's accusation... ...you claim complete innocence, do you?Graydon:\nWell of course I do! I've had to stand here in silence while that pretentious foreign lawyer has been prattling away!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nThen by all means...counter the charges, sir!Graydon:\n...!Van Zieks:\nThe prosecution demands the witness testifies...in response to the accusations brought by the defence!Graydon:\n......... ...Delighted, I'm sure.Judge:\nThe witness is reminded that the crime under scrutiny in this trial is the murder of the pawnbroker, Mr Windibank. That being a most flagitious offence, for which the law of this land sanctions a capital punishment. But the heinous act of high treason is no less serious a crime. ...I urge you to bear that in mind as you testify, Mr Graydon.Graydon:\n.........Judge:\nSo then, let us proceed. You may-???:Nash:\nYa gotta let us 'ave a rabbit an' pork 'ere, guvnor! We got things to say!Judge:\nI, I beg your pardon? Who do you think you are?Nash:\nName's Nash Skulkin!

And moreover...you did so as a party of three, in collaboration with Mr Graydon here?Nash:\n.........WE DID, GUV, WE DID!!!Judge:\nQuieten down, please. ...What say you to that, Mr Graydon?Graydon:\n...I have no idea what these two ruffians are referring to.Nash:\nYou little rotter, gettin' us mixed up in all this monkey business! You never said nuffin' about no gov'ment secrets! It woz s'posed to be a straight-up job!Ringo:\nAn' wot about the geezer whose shop it woz, eh? Poor old bloke didn't 'ave to die, did 'e?!Graydon:\nAgh...!Ryunosuke:\n(Nice to know who your friends are...)Graydon:\nWhatever these men say, I deny the accusations.Judge:\nIndeed... Well, I certainly wasn't expecting this little music box to become so significant in the proceedings. However, as it has, I will admit it into the Court Record as evidence.The small music box has been entered into the Court Record.Examine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall Music Box\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanism in top compartment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThis is the mechanism that turns the bumps on the disk into sound...isn't it?\nIris:\nYes, the 'movement'. It's all thanks to the comb with its teeth that are plucked by the passing bumps. Usually, the teeth on the comb are different lengths so that each one produces a different tone. But this comb is very strange. All the teeth are exactly the same length.\nRyunosuke:\nWell...what does that mean?\nIris:\nIt means that no matter which tooth is plucked by the passing bumps, the music box will make the same sound. I've never seen a music box like it before.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, it is strange. A music box that can only play a single note... (There has to be some significance to that, surely.)\n\n\n\n\nMusic box disk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nSee how the 'For McGilded' disk sits in the music box the man deposited at Windibank's. It couldn't be a more perfect fit.\nIris:\nSo there's no question then! The disk was designed to be played in this music box.\nRyunosuke:\nYet despite that, the sounds it produces are neither musical, nor do they appear to have any meaning. (It just doesn't make any sense...)\nIris:\nI wonder... ...if perhaps there's more to this music box than meets the eye. Maybe we haven't discovered all its secrets yet.\n\n\n\n\nKnob on bottom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n...Oh!\nIris:\nWhat is it, Runo?\nRyunosuke:\nI've, I've just noticed something about this music box... It looks like the bottom of it opens up as well.\nIris:\nAh! You're right! Well come on then! What are you waiting for? Let's open it!\nRyunosuke:\nAlright then...here goes...\nIris:\nLook at that! There's another movement on the underside!\nRyunosuke:\nSo...does that mean... ...you can set another disk to play back on this side?\nIris:\nYes, I think so. And it looks like the two movements are linked together.\nRyunosuke:\nThey're linked?\nIris:\nSo if you had two disks, they would both play back at the same time.\n\n\n\n\nBottom compartment (after examining knob on bottom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nWho'd have thought there would be a second movement on the underside of the box?\nIris:\nAnd this movement is like the other one. The comb's teeth are all the same length.\nRyunosuke:\nSo...this movement also only produces a single tone, like the other one?\nIris:\nYes, it must do. Except that the length of the teeth on the two combs isn't the same. So the single tone produced by this movement will be different to the single tone we've already heard.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nIris:\nBasically, each movement can only produce a single note...\nRyunosuke:\n...but the notes they produce are different.

By specialists. General members of staff in the station where I work would never be entrusted with sensitive information.\n\n???:Oh no! Stop. Must say something! Stop.\n\nRyunosuke:\n(Let me guess...) Juror number five!\nJuror No. 5:\nWe regular communication station officers aren't as lowly as you're being led to believe! A team of us are responsible for setting up and testing the telegraphs used by the ministry.

So you had access to the equipment used for these confidential communications, Mr Graydon...\nGraydon:\nWell, what of it?! The transmissions are always made behind closed doors so they can't be heard! And in any case, all messages are sent enciphered. Normal employees couldn't possibly understand them!\nJuror No. 5:\nOh no! Stop. Must say something! Stop. Mr Graydon regularly attends meetings with ministry technicians and the ministry communications team! He assists them in ensuring that there are no errors in important international communications!

Stop.\nGraydon:\nWell your idol would appreciate it if you'd keep your mouth shut!\nRyunosuke:\n(She should really pick her idols more carefully...)\nGraydon:\nI, I tell you this lawyer's accusations are completely unfounded!Graydon:\nBesides, the sounds produced by that music box aren't even Morse code!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThey're not?!\nGraydon:\nTo anyone with a brain, that would be blatantly apparent on listening to that music box for even a few seconds.\nRyunosuke:\n......... Of course, of course.\nVan Zieks:\nSurely it can't be that my learned friend is unfamiliar with Morse code?\nRyunosuke:\n(Ouch. He looks genuinely shocked at my ignorance.)\n\n???:Ha ha ha!\n\nJuror No. 5:\nI would be more than happy to demonstrate the basics for you, sir.\nRyunosuke:\nA, a lesson...here in court?\nJuror No. 5:\nMorse code is a continuous series of two distinct tones.\nRyunosuke:\nTones, you say?\nJuror No. 5:\nYes. A short 'dot' and a long 'dash'. By combining those in different ways, you construct letters.\nRyunosuke:\nI see...\nJuror No. 5:\nFor example, this is 'A'... And this is 'B'... But when you listen to the sound produced by this music box, you only hear one tone, don't you?\nRyunosuke:\nBut, but it sounds so similar! The rhythm of it is the same and everything!\nVan Zieks:\nBut there's no discernible meaning to this apparently random sequence of sounds. So your assertion is fundamentally flawed. This is not Morse code.\nRyunosuke:\nNOOOOOOOO!\nGraydon:\nHa ha ha ha ha... Really, you shouldn't be so surprised. What did I tell you? That music box is nothing but a worthless piece of scrap! Perhaps you might consider studying your subject matter before casting aspersions in future!\nRyunosuke:\n(Ugh... Stop. Nothing to say, but... Stop.)\nIris:\nOh, it's so frustrating, isn't it?\nRyunosuke:\nIris?\nIris:\nI mean, if the government secrets were somehow being leaked using the music box... ...so many other things would slot into place so nicely.\nRyunosuke:\n(Could there still be something I haven't considered...? Would it really be impossible to use this music box somehow to play back Morse code?)\n\n\n\nIt seems impossible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe defence will concede that the music box is irrelevant. ...For the time being.\nGraydon:\n'For the time being'? Such optimism. Too debonair to admit defeat, are we?\nRyunosuke:\n(Ugh...those gesticulations are really starting to grate.)\nIris:\nHm...it can't be Morse code unless is [sic] has two distinct tones...\nRyunosuke:\n(Perhaps I should examine that music box in a little more detail.)\nGraydon:\n.........\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThere's still every possibility that this music box was instrumental in the leaking of government secrets. That's the belief of the defence, at least.\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nDoes it please you in some way, my Nipponese friend, to repeat the same line of argument ad infinitum? It's already been established that to be Morse code, two tones are required. Dots...and dashes.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, I'm well aware of that.\nVan Zieks:\nThen, what?\nJudge:\nWell, it would appear the defence has a hypothesis to put forward.\nGraydon:\n...!\nJudge:\nYou had better present your idea at once, Counsel. How do you propose that this music box, which appears to produce only a single tone... ...could have been used to cipher secret messages into Morse code?\n\n\n\nExamine knob on bottom, then present bottom compartment (before correctly presenting McGilded Case Notes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nJudge:\nGood gracious! What am I looking at here? Another movement on the underside of the music box?\nVan Zieks:\nWhat?\nGraydon:\n...!\nRyunosuke:\nIt appears, My Lord, that the two movements are linked together. In other words, you can put two disks in this music box... ...and the sounds of both will play back at the same time!\nJudge:\nGood heavens!\nRyunosuke:\nAs the court has heard, Morse code comprises of two tones: a short 'dot' and a long 'dash'. With a second disk in place, this music box could be used to generate Morse code and convey a message!\nGraydon:\nThis is beyond a joke!\nRyunosuke:\nI'm sorry?\nGraydon:\nThis poor excuse for a lawyer has absolutely no evidence to support his claims!\nVan Zieks:\nThough of course... ...if my learned friend were able to present the court with the second disk, that would be another matter. ...Well?\nRyunosuke:\nI, I can't...at the moment.\nJudge:\nHmmm...\nVan Zieks:\nAnd may I remind the court that as the witness has pointed out... ...he was not the one in the omnibus with McGilded two months ago, striking a deal over the disk or disks.\nJudge:\nIndeed. That was Mr Mason, the brickmaker.\nGraydon:\nExactly! I had nothing whatsoever to do with it!\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nJudge:\nThough it has holes, I must admit the argument presented by the defence has much promise. I believe the cross-examination should continue.\nRyunosuke:\n(The link between Graydon and the victim of the omnibus case must be there somewhere. But I haven't found it yet...)\nIris:\nOh dear... It looks like you need to give your argument more strength, Runo.\nJudge:\nYou will reiterate your testimony if you please, Mr Graydon.\nGraydon:\nIf I must, though I maintain exactly what I did at the start of this pointless cross-examination.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nExamine knob on bottom, then present bottom compartment (after correctly presenting McGilded Case Notes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nJudge:\nGood gracious!

Clearly that was an answer given in desperation by one floundering to substantiate his argument!\nRyunosuke:\nGAAAAAAH! (Ugh... Was it that obvious?)\nIris:\nI'm sure you're on the right lines, Runo. There's something about that music box. There has to be!\nJudge:\nContinue with the cross-examination, Counsel.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after correctly presenting bottom compartment in Small Music Box)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nHowever! As the defence has just demonstrated... ...the music box is able to play a second disk simultaneously.\nGraydon:\n...!\nRyunosuke:\nWhich means there's a possibility the device could in fact have been used to produce Morse code!\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nMy Nipponese friend forces me to repeat myself. The courtroom is no place for mere possibilities. Present the second disk of which you speak...or your argument is dead in the water.\nRyunosuke:\nI, I just can't do that at this time.\nVan Zieks:\nAnd may I remind the court that as the witness has pointed out... ...he was not the one in the omnibus with McGilded two months ago, striking a deal over the disk or disks.\nJudge:\nIndeed. That was Mr Mason, the brickmaker.\nGraydon:\nExactly! I had nothing whatsoever to do with it!\nVan Zieks:\nSo as my learned friend appears to be persisting with this line of argument... ...I presume the defence is able to show a connection between the brickmaker and this witness?\nRyunosuke:\n...!

I've no relation to the man!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo two months ago in that omnibus...McGilded killed the brickmaker and stole the disk...\nVan Zieks:\nMr Mason was a single man with almost nothing to his name. It seems he lived in an artisan quarter some years ago, but people there remember little about him.\nRyunosuke:\nThat doesn't make much sense, though, does it? How would a humble brickmaker come to acquire secret government information?\nGraydon:\nHow indeed?\nRyunosuke:\nThere must have been somebody else involved behind the scenes in all of this. Somebody who acquired the disk and gave it to Mr Mason... ...in order to take it to the meeting with McGilded and negotiate a deal!\nGraydon:\n......... Dear me. You may have it in for me, sir, but I assure you...I have far more class than that.\nRyunosuke:\n(An old brickmaker from an artisan quarter and this well-to-do communications officer... If only I could find some evidence to link the two of them together...)\nGraydon:\n.........\nJudge:\nIf you have nothing more to add on that note, let us return to the witness testimony.Present McGilded Case Notes (after Ashley Graydon profile is updated in the Court Record; before correctly presenting bottom compartment in Small Music Box)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nMr Ashley Milverton...

The truth is...you had a reason to hide that name!\nGraydon:\n.........\nJudge:\nExplain yourself, please, Counsel.\nRyunosuke:\nI have here the notes from the omnibus case, My Lord. And as we all know, the victim - the man who we now understand to have been negotiating with McGilded...\nJudge:\nYes...Mr Mason, the brickmaker?\nRyunosuke:\nThat's right. Only 'Mason' wasn't his surname at all. It was his given name. His full name...was Mason Milverton.\nJudge:\nMil... Milverton?! Do, do you mean to say...? Saints alive!\nRyunosuke:\nMr Ashley Milverton... ...is it not the case that the brickmaker, Mr Mason Milverton...was your father?\nGraydon:\nUgh! I, I don't...\nVan Zieks:\nAs I believe I mentioned earlier... ...your family history will have been thoroughly checked when you joined the civil service. And it really would take no time at all for the court to subpoena those records.\nGraydon:\nGrrr...\nRyunosuke:\nThe truth is you have been illegally acquiring highly confidential government information... ...and selling it on to McGilded in collaboration with your father!\nGraydon:\n\nGraydon:\nThis is slander!\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nGraydon:\nI carved a new life for myself as a respectable communications officer. As a gentleman! I have no idea what my father has been up to. But it has nothing to do with me!\nVan Zieks:\nAnd may I remind the court... ...that the assertion that this disk contains some sort of message in Morse code has been reliably disproven. By a professional and independent communications officer, no less.\nJudge:\nHmmm... The relationship between the victim of the omnibus case and this witness is undoubtedly significant. However, the defence's argument remains somewhat incomplete, I feel.\nRyunosuke:\nNo!\nJudge:\nI believe the cross-examination should continue.\nRyunosuke:\n(Alright, so Morse code uses two tones. If I could just demonstrate the possibility that this could have been used to generate two distinct tones...)\nIris:\nHm...perhaps we should have a really good look over the music box, Runo.\nJudge:\nYou will reiterate your testimony if you please, Mr Graydon.\nGraydon:\nIf I must, though I maintain exactly what I did at the start of this pointless cross-examination.Present McGilded Case Notes (after Ashley Graydon profile is updated in the Court Record; after correctly presenting bottom compartment in Small Music Box)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nMr Ashley Milverton...

Now...I'm a man of more class. I severed ties with Mason long ago. He has no place in my new life.\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nCertainly, the idea of a humble brickmaker gaining access to government secrets seems far-fetched.

I'd love to crunch some of that apple!)\nIris:\nOh, I prefer pears! They're so sweet!\nJudge:\nVery good. So, Mr and Mr Skulkin, you will reiterate the rest of your testimony for the court.\n\nSay no more! ...A Skulkin's never skulkin'!\n\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\nGraydon:\nEnough! Why don't you 'baddies' desist with the fiction?\nNash:\n...!\nGraydon:\nObviously...I don't know these men from Adam! Now, for the last time, stop trying to implicate me in your sordid thievery!\nNash:\nWell that's bloomin' nice, innit? You little turncoat! Fine, if that's 'ow ya want it... Two can play at that game! We ain't never 'eard o' this geezer before, either! Don't know 'im from Adam!\nRyunosuke:\nUhh...\nNash:\nNever spoken to 'im before in me life! Never even seen 'im!\nRingo:\nNever, Nash! NEVER!\nJudge:\nGood grief! Such a blatant lie will not stand in my courtroom!\nRingo:\nWell, well...all I'll say is this...Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nLike Mr Graydon told you to do, you mean?\nNash:\nThat's it, yeah. Who else, eh? Silly me thought 'e woz just poppin' over for a natter after all them years, but the rotter 'ad a dodgy job for us! Eh, Ash?\nGraydon:\nEnough! Why don't you 'baddies' desist with the fiction?\nNash:\n...!\nGraydon:\nObviously...I don't know these men from Adam! Now, for the last time, stop trying to implicate me in your sordid thievery!\nNash:\nWell that's bloomin' nice, innit? You little turncoat! Fine, if that's 'ow ya want it...

Never even seen 'im!\nRingo:\nNever, Nash! NEVER!\nJudge:\nGood grief! Such a blatant lie will not stand in my courtroom!\nRingo:\nWell, well...all I'll say is this...Ringo:\nIf we'd known there woz dodgy gov'ment secrets involved, we wouldn't 'ave touched it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo did you know nothing about this music box?\nRingo:\nWe didn't know nuffin'! We still don't know nuffin'! And we ain't plannin' on knowin' nuffin' about it, neither!\nRyunosuke:\nBut two nights ago, you did indeed break into Windibank's pawnbrokery, didn't you? In your original testimony... ...you said that the door of the shop was ajar, and that it was like some kind of a sign, begging you to go in. But the truth is...you were planning to break into Windibank's all along, weren't you?\nRingo:\nWe were, guv, we were. Yer right there.\nNash:\nCos that's wot 'e told us to do! It woz 'is plan!\nGraydon:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nAnd why was it Mr Graydon's plan to break into Windibank's that night? Did you not ask the reason?\nRingo:\nWell, um...erm... ...'E said the place woz full o' stuff worth nickin'. That's wot 'e told us beforehand, anyway. Turned out it woz a load o' cobblers, didn't it? I weren't best pleased, I can tell ya!\nRyunosuke:\n(In any case, if they know the real reason, it doesn't sound like they're going to give it away...)Nash:\n'Milverton & Skulkin's Milk Run'... Gor, them were the days!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nI'm sure I'm going to regret asking, but...what exactly was that? Some kind of business?\nNash:\nJust a little scheme we 'ad goin' back when we woz youngsters. A bit o' fun, really.\nRingo:\nDeliverin' fresh milk to the locals, that's wot it woz all about!\nRyunosuke:\nThat sounds alarmingly legitimate. There must be a catch. (I suppose since we're here, I should ask them to elaborate. But on what?)\n\n\n\nThe business model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo...how did your little business work exactly?\nNash:\nWell, every mornin' down our way, the milkman would come wiv 'is cart to deliver milk, see. If ya stuck yer empties outside yer front door, 'e would leave ya them full again, right?\nRingo:\nSo...we swooped in on the action! Got people to sign up wiv us. We promised to deliver milk fer 'alf the price o' the other geezers doin' it! People couldn't wait to sign on the dotted line! We were rakin' it in, we were!\nRyunosuke:\nSo...did you live on a dairy farm or something?\nRingo:\nGordon Bennett! Are you off yer rocker?! We 'ad nuffin'! We were too poor to 'ave a farm!\nRyunosuke:\nRight.\nNash:\nNah, wot we 'ad goin' on woz simple once you 'ad the idea. We'd just switch 'em over, see. Our customers' empties wiv the full ones from anyone who wasn't on our books. A doddle, right?\nRyunosuke:\n......... I think you meant to say 'a diddle'. And that's a crime.\nNash:\nIt woz just an 'armless bit o' fun, that's all!\nJudge:\nMilking the general public in such a fashion is most certainly not ''armless', as you put it.\nRingo:\nWell, it woz 'im wot came up wiv the idea. Ash is the evil genius.\nRyunosuke:\nYou mean, Mr Graydon?\nGraydon:\n.........\nRingo:\nYeah, Ash always 'ad 'is 'ead in a book when we woz growin' up. Said 'e woz gonna get 'imself an edumation an' get out o' that slum we lived in.\nNash:\nCor, we all ragged 'im about that, didn't we? Told 'im 'e woz soft in the 'ead to even think it! But look at 'im now. 'E's only gone an' become a blinkin' com...commaca...comnication officer, ain't 'e?\nJudge:\nA communications officer, Mr Skulkin.\nIris:\n......... Hm...Sholmes & Wilson's Milk Run...\nRyunosuke:\nNo, Iris! Don't even think about it!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nThe business name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo this business was just a bit of fun, you say? And it was just yourselves and Mr Graydon involved?\nNash:\nYeah, that's it.\nRyunosuke:\n'Milverton & Skulkin's Milk Run', was it?\nRingo:\nYeah, that's it.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd where did the 'Milverton' part come from?\nNash:\nOh right. I thought a clever clogs like you'd 'ave worked that one out. That's 'is-\nGraydon:\n\nGraydon:\nEnough of this! How much longer are we expected to listen to this drivel? I don't-\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nLet me guess? You don't accept anything these two witnesses are saying?\nGraydon:\n...!\nRyunosuke:\nTell me! Why is it that it was only at the mention of the name Milverton that you decided to interject?\nGraydon:\nB-Because I...well...\nNash:\nIt weren't the 'appiest of 'omes that one came from.\nRingo:\nYeah, 'is old man woz strugglin' fer money so much, 'is wife walked out on 'im.\nNash:\nShe took the name Graydon then, see.\nRingo:\nBut Ash will always be Milverton to us!\nRyunosuke:\nMilverton... So that used to be your surname, did it?\nGraydon:\nOf course not! This is all bunkum! I've been a Graydon since I was born! Do you really think you can rely on the testimony of these two thieves, hm?\nVan Zieks:\nYou're a communications officer attached to the civil service. As such, your personal details will have been thoroughly checked at the time of your appointment. It would be a very simple matter indeed to subpoena those records, Mr...Graydon.\nGraydon:\nAgh!\nJudge:\nWell. It would appear that Mr and Mr Skulkin's testimony has been reliable...for once. You were born Ashley Milverton, then. Is that correct?\nGraydon:\n......... Very well. Yes.\nRyunosuke:\n(So Ashley Graydon was once Ashley Milverton... That information could change things... And could turn out to be extremely important.)\nAshley Graydon's personal profile has been updated in the Court Record.\nGraydon:\n.........\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nWell, nothing about that seems particularly relevant here, so...I think I've heard enough.\nNash:\nEh? Come on, guv, I woz just warmin' up there. I got plenty to tell!\nRingo:\nYeah, come on. Ya can't say you ain't gonna bite now. Yer the one who brought it up!\nRyunosuke:\n(That makes me the only one not biting here, in fact.)\nJudge:\nLet us return to the witnesses' testimony then.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Ashley Graydon profile is updated in the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo...how did your little business work exactly?\nNash:\nWell, every mornin' down our way, the milkman would come wiv 'is cart to deliver milk, see.

Ash is the evil genius!\nRyunosuke:\nYou mean, Mr Graydon?\nGraydon:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n(So Ashley Graydon was once Ashley Milverton... That information could change things... And could turn out to be extremely important.)Ryunosuke:\nAll of a sudden, we seem to be up to our necks in a serious matter of national security. Although all this talk about interception of secret government messages is still just conjecture at this stage.Iris:\nIt would explain a number of things though, wouldn't it? The negotiation Ginny overheard on the omnibus two months ago, and the break-in at Windibank's. But the trouble is, it wasn't Mr Graydon in the omnibus with Mr McGilded...Ryunosuke:\nNo, that was Mr Mason, the brickmaker who was so horribly murdered.Iris:\nHm...if only there was some link between the two men somehow.Ryunosuke:\nI know. But Mr Graydon's testimony seems to be as watertight as ever. I wonder if the key to us making headway with the cross-examination here... (...could be those two brothers.)Graydon:\nAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!Ryunosuke:\nThe new facts and evidence unveiled by the cross-examination of this witness... ...all come together to reveal the truth!Graydon:\nThe, the truth, you say?Ryunosuke:\nThat you collaborated with your father, Mr Mason Milverton, in illegal dealings with Magnus McGilded.Judge:\nBy dint of this music box, you mean, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\nYes. Stealing information being sent in secret government communications, and selling it on to McGilded... Mr Graydon concocted this elaborate scheme of using two music box disks to encode the information... ...as, presumably, a safety measure against the information falling into the wrong hands.Judge:\nAnd a very effective one. I shouldn't have given the scheme any credence whatsoever.Van Zieks:\nBut the deal with McGilded went sour...and the brickmaker met his end.Ryunosuke:\nYes, but before he was arrested, McGilded managed to temporarily dispose of the stolen disk at the pawnbroker. Then, having learnt of the situation, you appeared at Windibank's two days ago... ...in an attempt to recover the two articles McGilded had placed in pawn there.Graydon:\n.........Van Zieks:\nBut that attempt failed.Ryunosuke:\nOne of the disks was seized by the police, and the other, you never found. So that same night... ...you enlisted the help of the Skulkin brothers and broke into the pawnbrokery. This time, determined to recover the second disk!Judge:\nAre, are you suggesting that the second disk...was inside the music box?!Nash:\nEh?Ringo:\nWe, we never knew nuffin' about that!Ryunosuke:\nOn the night that Mr Windibank was killed... ...the intruder to the pawnbrokery touched one item, and one item alone: the music box.Judge:\nAs rather ingeniously demonstrated using the two prints from the security camera, indeed.Ryunosuke:\nSo, the question that naturally begs answering is this: why was only that one article disturbed? The answer is obvious: because it contained the second disk, which the intruder was desperate to retrieve. Since, if it were to fall into the hands of the police, it would be proof...of high treason.Graydon:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nWell, Mr Graydon? Do you deny that all of this actually began on that fateful night two months ago?Graydon:\n......... I... I... I refuse to accept any of this nonsense!Van Zieks:\n.........Judge:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nSir... ...there appears to be blood seeping through the sleeve of your jacket.Graydon:\nWhat?! Ah!Ryunosuke:\nTwo nights ago... ...we know that three shots were fired at the scene of the crime in Windibank's pawnbrokery. One took the life of the pawnbroker himself... One struck the pouch around Mr Sholmes's waist... And the final bullet... ...struck the calendar on the wall of the shop, having first pierced the arm of one of the intruders. Mr Graydon... ...that wound on your arm that you seem to be trying to hide... It's a bullet wound, isn't it?Graydon:\n.........Nash:\n'E's got ya now, me old china.Ringo:\nTime to call it quits an' croak, I reckon.Graydon:\n......... Tsk. 'Don't acknowledge my presence there under any circumstances whatsoever.' Those were my terms, remember? And I paid you handsomely to comply. Clearly I was a fool to think I could trust some common back slum thieves.Ryunosuke:\n...!Graydon:\nFine. I admit it. I was there in Windibank's that night. I paid this pair ten guineas to accompany me. And as you've noticed, I sustained an injury in the course of my adventures. But that is all! I admit to nothing more! Stealing government secrets? Negotiating with Mr McGilded? As God is my witness...I'm sure I recall nothing of the sort!Ryunosuke:\n(He's not going to go down without a fight. Not until I can show hard evidence, I suppose.) Nevertheless, the defence has now established a crucial fact.Van Zieks:\nWhich is...?Ryunosuke:\nWell, we know that one bullet was fired from each of the two firearms we have in evidence. The bullet from the Skulkin brothers' gun hit the pouch around Mr Sholmes's waist. And the bullet from Mr Windibank's gun... ...clearly must have been the one that caught Mr Graydon on the arm.Judge:\nIndeed it must. We can rule out the possibility that the man shot himself.Graydon:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nAnd that leads us to only one conclusion: Mr Windibank was shot by a third gun... ...which can only have been fired by the third intruder.Judge:\nGoodness!Van Zieks:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nThat's right, Mr Graydon.Graydon:\nGrrr...Ryunosuke:\nThe only person who could possibly have shot Mr Windibank that night...is you!???:Graydon:\nHa ha ha ha ha... You little upstart! You made a grave mistake when you summoned me here.Ryunosuke:\nWhat? (What's that supposed to mean?)Graydon:\nYes, as you rightly say, I was there at the pawnbroker's. I did my best to hide the fact, naturally. I had no intention of ruining the distinguished career I'd built for myself at the communication station. But did the thought never cross your mind? Did you never consider the possibility?Ryunosuke:\nWhat, what do you mean? What thought? What possibility?Graydon:\nThe possibility that if I was there at the scene... I may have witnessed the crucial moment. You see... ...this makes me a key witness in this case...and I have my hands firmly around the neck of your client!Ryunosuke:\nWhat?!Judge:\nAre, are you suggesting...?Graydon:\nI saw it all! I saw the very moment that pickpocket girl pointed the gun at that poor, defenceless pawnbroker...and shot him!Ryunosuke:\nYou... WHAAAAAAAAT?!Judge:\nOrdaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Well... ...it would seem we are finally entering the last act of this theatrical trial.Van Zieks:\nMr Graydon...Graydon:\nYes?Van Zieks:\nI trust you are fully aware of the implications here? If it is shown that your claim is false... ...you will have incriminated yourself as the killer.Graydon:\n......... Oh, I understand fully.Judge:\nThen I must ask you to give your formal testimony once more. You will explain to the court precisely what you saw at the moment the defendant allegedly shot the victim.Graydon:\n...Nothing would give me greater pleasure.Witness Testimony\n- The Moment of the Shooting -Graydon:\nWhile these ruffians were jostling with the broker, I was still near the entrance to the shop.\nWhen Windibank threw Nash over the counter, I felt a sharp pain in my arm.\nI pursued the man but he shut himself in the storeroom. I could see him through the peephole in the door, though.\nThe accused, in a black coat, shot the man in the back as he was trying to flee to safety!\nI saw the blood spatter all over that wretched girl.\nThen she tossed the gun out of the peephole. So I picked it up...and made my escape.Judge:\nGood gracious! This, this is quite extraordinary testimony!Graydon:\n.........Judge:\nYou claim, sir - under oath - to have clearly seen the defendant pulling the trigger! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar!Graydon:\nIt wasn't my intention to testify in this way. But neither is it my intention to be found guilty of a murder I didn't commit. So you see...my hand has been forced. I tell the truth now as an act of self-preservation.Ryunosuke:\n...! The truth?Van Zieks:\nUntil now, the prosecution was completely unaware of these details.Gregson:\nYes...well, um...sorry about that.Graydon:\nHaving shot me in the arm, the pawnbroker was then shot in the back by the accused. And as I said...she was showered in his blood.Van Zieks:\nYou say the blood splattered over the accused's coat? Are you sure on that point?Graydon:\nOh yes. Quite sure. All over the black overcoat that pickpocket girl was wearing at the time.Judge:\nReally? If her coat could somehow be shown to harbour vestiges of blood, that would be conclusive evidence here!Van Zieks:\n...Such an investigation is entirely possible, My Lord.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?Van Zieks:\nOnly very recently, a German scientist has developed a technique to identify human blood. So here's to true science...not some amateurish detective's dubious foray into the world of chemistry.Iris:\nThere's nothing dubious about Hurley's work! His ideas are all sound!Van Zieks:\nIdeas are no use to us here. In science, as in law, theories must be proven before they stand.Iris:\n...!Van Zieks:\nIn Germany, the technique has already been employed in the courtroom as the basis of evidence. Scotland Yard has a small quantity of the chemical reagent used. With Your Lordship's permission... ...we could shatter all vestiges of doubt within minutes!Judge:\nHm...Iris:\nThis doesn't look good, Runo.Ryunosuke:\nWhy not?Iris:\nWell, we know, don't we? That there's blood all over the front of Ginny's coat. If they test it with their chemicals...Ryunosuke:\nOh help! You're right! (I was forgetting what happened yesterday...)Iris:\nDon't move, Ginny! I'm going to shoot!Ryunosuke:\n(But that's not Mr Windibank's blood. That stain is from two months ago. That's Mr Mason's blood, from when he was stabbed by McGilded, who was wearing the coat at the time!) My Lord! The defence objects to the test proposed by the prosecution!Judge:\nOverruled. Lord van Zieks. Make it so at once!Van Zieks:\n...With pleasure, My Lord.Judge:\nAnd while we await the results, the defence may proceed with the cross-examination.Ryunosuke:\n......... (Once they find that blood on the overcoat... ...Gina will be...)Judge:\nCounsel!Ryunosuke:\nYes, My Lord!Judge:\nYour cross-examination!Ryunosuke:\nOf course, My Lord. (If this cross-examination doesn't go well... If I don't manage to uncover some decisive evidence or a really compelling clue now... ...I have a very bad feeling about the outcome of this trial.)Cross-Examination\n- The Moment of the Shooting -",

He already had the revolver in his hand. ...Fortunately, I wasn't too close.\nNash:\nI've never been so scared in all me life!\nRingo:\nYeah, we're just yer regular, mild-mannered burglars, that's all. We dun't like violence.\nRyunosuke:\n...Says the pair who carry a gun. What do you mean when you say you were 'near the entrance to the shop'?\nGraydon:\nI was in the doorway, running my eyes over the shelves of forfeited items.\nRyunosuke:\n(Looking for the music box, of course.)\nGraydon:\nThe broker went for Nash in the first place. Then Ringo joined in, making it two against one. So I assumed they could handle the situation. But I was wrong.\nRingo:\nI woz tryin' to 'elp me little bruv, but the old geezer chucked me over the bloomin' counter!\nNash:\nSo I pulled me gun on the old fella, an' that soon made 'im scarper.\nJudge:\nThe pair of you setting upon the poor, defenceless pawnbroker together? Shame on you!\nSorry, guv...Graydon:\nWhen Windibank threw Nash over the counter, I felt a sharp pain in my arm.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou mean that's the moment you were shot?\nGraydon:\nYes. Though I didn't immediately realise what had happened, of course. Things crashed to the floor from the counter as the three men were brawling. It was at exactly that moment that it happened. So I didn't hear the gunshot.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd the bullet went on to strike the calendar in the wall behind you...\nGraydon:\nSo it would appear. When I looked at my arm, I saw it was bleeding badly. So I wrapped my handkerchief around it. Seeing as I couldn't explain what had happened to a doctor, I had no choice but to wait for it to heal. I didn't imagine it would still be bleeding two days later.\nVan Zieks:\nDid Mr Windibank intend to shoot you, do you think?\nGraydon:\nWell now...I don't imagine he even noticed I was there, to be honest. Perhaps the gun went off accidentally. Anyway, it didn't quite strike home.\nNash:\nWhen I pulled me gun on 'im, 'e tried to shove me out the way.\nRingo:\nAnd then 'e scarpered fru that door out back.\nJudge:\nAt which point, what did you do?Graydon:\nI pursued the man but he shut himself in the storeroom. I could see him through the peephole in the door, though.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou mean you chased after him?\nGraydon:\nI don't recall the reason why. But I ran after him to the back of the shop.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd what about this 'peephole in the door' you mentioned?\nGregson:\nWell, unsurprisingly, the storeroom door's a solid job. Made of stout wood. But there's a small openin' in it about head height that lets you see what's what in there from the outside.\nRyunosuke:\n(Actually, I should know that, shouldn't I? I looked through it myself that night.)\nVan Zieks:\nAnd what about you burgling brothers? Did you see what went on through this peephole as well?\nN-N-Not likely, guv!\n\nD-Didn't see nuffin' o' the sort, guv!\n\nGraydon:\nI doubt these two buffoons were even aware of the peephole's existence.\nRyunosuke:\n(So the Skulkin brothers were there, but they didn't see the killing of Mr Windibank take place.)\nJudge:\nHm...\nGraydon:\nInside the storeroom, I could see the broker and that young girl standing there.\nJudge:\nThe defendant?\nGraydon:\nYes. Though neither of them noticed that I was looking. The girl raised her gun and pointed it straight at the man.\nJudge:\nAnd then...? What did you see next?Graydon:\nThe accused, in a black coat, shot the man in the back as he was trying to flee to safety!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYes, when the crime was discovered, the defendant was found with a gun in her hand. But that was Mr Windibank's gun, from which only a single bullet had been fired. And as we've clearly established, Mr Graydon, that bullet was fired at you!\nGraydon:\nAh, but no... It wasn't the broker's gun that the pickpocket girl had when I saw her. Yes, the bullet from Windibank's gun grazed my arm... And yes, the Skulkins' gun grounded the detective... But this...was another gun entirely. A third gun.\nVan Zieks:\nThe broker's gun was not the murder weapon. So clearly there had to be a third firearm involved. In other words, the accused must have had her own gun with her at the time.\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBut no other gun was found at the scene!\nGraydon:\nHa ha ha ha ha... Calm yourself, Counsel.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nGraydon:\nYou must consider the events in order.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nGraydon:\nAt first I saw the broker and the girl glaring at each other, but then, all of a sudden... ...the broker turned to run. And it was at that moment, that the little gutter rat shot him in the back!\nJudge:\n...A chilling image, I must say.\nGraydon:\n.........Graydon:\nI saw the blood spatter all over that wretched girl.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nAll, all over her?\nGraydon:\nYes, through the peephole, I saw it clearly. Of course, the stains are invisible now, what with the coat being such a dark colour. But I assure you...that garment is sullied with the victim's blood!\nRyunosuke:\n(Well...it is sullied with blood, that's for sure.)\nIris:\nBut it's not Mr Windibank's blood, is it?\nRyunosuke:\nNo, that's right. It's Mr Mason Milverton's blood from when McGilded stabbed him two months ago.\nIris:\nIt's so annoying! If they'd only accept Hurley's chemical analysis, we could prove that.\nRyunosuke:\nBut they won't. So unfortunately, we can't use it as evidence to support our case.\nIris:\nBother...Graydon:\nThen she tossed the gun out of the peephole. So I picked it up...and made my escape.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nDid, did I hear you correctly? She threw the gun out of the room?\nGraydon:\nThat's right. After the broker fell to the floor, she started walking over.\nJudge:\nOver where exactly?\nGraydon:\nIn the direction of the storeroom door. To where I was watching. Of course, I quickly retreated. And then... ...the girl dropped the gun through the peephole onto the floor on my side of the door.\nJudge:\nBut why on earth would she do such a thing?\nGraydon:\n...I couldn't tell you. Perhaps she was hoping to distance herself from the murder weapon. Without thinking, I went and picked it up. I suppose I was worried about just leaving it there, in case any more tragedies took place.\nVan Zieks:\n......... So it was you, in fact, who took the third gun from the scene of the crime?\nGraydon:\nYes...it was yours truly.\nJudge:\nHm...\nGraydon:\nI left the clear-up to my lackeys and left.\nRyunosuke:\nClear-up?\nNash:\nWe'd made a bit of a mess around the counter, so Mr Whistle 'n' Flute 'ere told us to tidy up.\nRingo:\n'E thinks 'e's our bloomin' mum sometimes!\nGraydon:\nWell I was paying you enough, by God!\nNash:\nUgh...\nRyunosuke:\nTell me, Mr Graydon, when you left the pawnbrokery that night... ...was it by any chance with the second disk in your jacket pocket?\nGraydon:\n......... You're like a bull at a gate, aren't you? But I admit to nothing of the sort. After all, you can't even show the court such a disk exists...can you?\n\n\n\nPursue Tobias Gregson or Nash Skulkin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nGentlemen!\nNash:\nHahh...hahh...hah...hahh... Hahh!\nGregson:\nSomethin' wrong, sunshine?\nRyunosuke:\nThat should be my line. You...do realise you were just violently shaking Mr Skulkin?\nNash:\nBlimey, this dee's a bit of an 'ooligan, ain't 'e?\nRyunosuke:\nWhat was going on just now?\nNash:\nYou saw 'im! 'E grabbed me whistle! 'Why the blazes,' 'e said, 'didn't ya mention the third gun when we got ya down the station?'\nRyunosuke:\nAnd why didn't you?\nNash:\nCos! We didn't know nuffin' about it! Or that flamin' peephole in the door!\nGregson:\nUm...sorry about that. I can be prone to losin' my rag sometimes. ...Not hurt, are you?\nNash:\nGor blimey, see the way 'e's lookin' at me? I'm tellin' ya, this dee gives me the willies!\nRyunosuke:\n(That was strange... The inspector doesn't normally get quite as worked up as that. He wouldn't normally grab someone...)\nIris:\nNo, that wasn't like Gregsy at all. He's normally all sweetness and light, no matter what I say to him.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, well... I think you might be a special case, Iris.\nIris:\nWell anyway. That was definitely out of character.\nGregson:\n.........\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(As expected... ...he won't admit to anything unless I can thrust the evidence in his face.)\nGraydon:\nHa ha ha ha ha... It's not as easy as you thought, is it? To pin a crime on this lapel.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nGraydon:\nHa ha... It won't stick. Not murder...not treason...\nRyunosuke:\n(Maybe not right now, but you won't be sniggering like that forever!)Iris:\nWhat's your feeling, Runo?Ryunosuke:\nAs much as I hate to admit it...I don't see any obvious holes in his testimony at the moment.Iris:\nBut you have to find a way to break this man!Ryunosuke:\n(And quickly, too. Because once they discover the blood on the overcoat Gina was wearing...)Iris:\nIt's a bit strange that he's so sure of himself about seeing the blood spatter over Ginny's coat. It doesn't strike me as the sort of thing you'd claim if you hadn't genuinely seen it happen.Ryunosuke:\nBut we know that Gina didn't shoot Mr Windibank. So what's going on...?Iris:\nAll I know is that it's very unfair! Why should some German scientist's test be acceptable as evidence when mine and Hurley's wasn't? Detectives can use test tubes, too!Ryunosuke:\n(Never mind that. I have to find a really stark inconsistency in this testimony somewhere. And I have to find it before the prosecution discovers the bloodstain on Gina's coat!)After pressing first, second, third, fourth, and fifth statements and pursuing Tobias Gregson or Nash Skulkin correctly:???:My Lord!Bailiff:\nRequesting Your Lordship's permission to interrupt the cross-examination!Judge:\nExplain yourself, Officer!Bailiff:\nI have the results of the test that was ordered earlier, My Lord!Van Zieks:\nAh...the blood... On the accused's overcoat.Judge:\nThank you, Officer. Very well, the cross-examination is hereby temporarily suspended. I presume you have no objection, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\nUm... No, My Lord.Gregson:\n......... Well, there you have it!Van Zieks:\nThe report, please, Inspector.Gregson:\nYes, sir! 'Traces of human blood were found on the overcoat of the defendant, Miss Gina Lestrade. From the extent of the stains, it would appear that they were the result of spattering following a gunshot wound.' ...End of report!Judge:\nGoodness me!Graydon:\n...See? What did I tell you?Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nNo! The blood on that coat is not Mr Windibank's!Judge:\nWhat on earth makes you say that, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\nThe coat originally belonged to Magnus McGilded. Just before his coat was deposited at Windibank's, McGilded had fatally stabbed Mr Mason Milverton. So the blood on that overcoat...is the blood of the brickmaker from the omnibus case!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nWell...the dead cannot speak. ...Isn't that right, my Nipponese friend?Ryunosuke:\nSorry?Van Zieks:\nTwo months ago in this very courtroom... ...did you not argue fervently for McGilded's innocence? And yet now that the man is dead...you brand him as a murderer? Your conduct shatters any shred of respect you may have earnt for yourself in this country!Ryunosuke:\nAgh! But, but that was...Juror No. 1:\nI call it a bally disgrace! Treachery, that's what it is!Juror No. 3:\nHm, how to determine whether the blood on that coat is two months old or not...? Even a stereoscope couldn't help the answer to that problem pop out. It can't be done!Ryunosuke:\nBut...but... ...we used Mr Sholmes's specially formulated chemicals-Juror No. 4:\nMr Sholmes is a detective, not a chemist!Juror No. 5:\nWould you put such faith in a chemical formula devised by me, for example, when I'm a communications officer?Juror No. 6:\nI held out pirozhki to starving boy, and he ran away crying.Van Zieks:\nHerlock Sholmes is barely more than a figment of the public's imagination. His name carries no weight in this courtroom! ...No weight at all.Ryunosuke:\nHow could you say that?!Graydon:\n...Victory is sweet indeed. This proves that my testimony is the whole truth from start to finish!Judge:\nHow do you arrive at such a conclusion, sir?Van Zieks:\nAs the witness said, the accused's coat was spattered with the blood of the victim. The only way Mr Graydon could possibly have known that fact, is if he saw it happen. In other words...his testimony is solid, and the conclusion is singular: It was the accused who shot the victim in this case. That...is the whole truth!Ryunosuke:\nAAAAAAAAARGH!???:My Lord!Juror No. 1:\nBeen a long battle, this one, but this old warhorse has something to say now, if you please.Judge:\nMr Foreman...?Juror No. 1:\nAs of this moment, sir, the squadron has reached its final decision. Ready, men? All for one now!SIR!Juror No. 1:\nGuilty!Juror No. 2:\nGuilty!Juror No. 3:\nGuilty!Juror No. 4:\nGuilty!Juror No. 5:\nGuilty!Juror No. 6:\nGuilty!Judge:\nWell, it would appear the ladies and gentlemen of the jury have reached a unanimous verdict.Van Zieks:\nThe defence has consistently failed to unpick this witness's testimony. Here's to any attempt you may make at unpicking the jurors' decisions being...equally successful.Ryunosuke:\nUgh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH! (I don't believe it... After I've come so far... How is it all unravelling on me so fast...?) .........???:How very distressing... ...to be held in such low esteem.Bailiff:\nWouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo?Judge:\nOfficer...? You've delivered the report now. That will be all, thank you.Bailiff:\nIt occurs to me with some regularity, Mr Naruhodo... ...that scientific truths are determined not by science... ...but by none other than the human mind.Ryunosuke:\n(I, I know that voice...) Am I going mad...? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr Sholmes!Judge:\nWha...? WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!Van Zieks:\nWhat business do you have here, detective? The last I heard, you were recuperating in hospital.Sholmes:\nAs well I would be...had I not been set upon an errand.Van Zieks:\nWhat errand?Iris:\nHurley! It's really you! You're awake at last!Sholmes:\nYes, good day, Iris. I appear to be rather late to rise. My apologies. Now, My Lord...if you will humour me?Judge:\nIn what manner, sir?Sholmes:\nI have something of great importance I wish to give to the young lawyer over there. I need no more than five minutes. Would you be so kind as to spare us the time?Judge:\nHmmm... What say you to this, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks:\n......... This trial has taken many hours of the court's time. Having spent so long already-Gregson:\nExactly! Havin' spent so long already, we don't wanna go wastin' any more precious time!Van Zieks:\nAs I was saying... Having spent so long already, it would seem churlish to deny the defence a mere five minutes.Gregson:\nEEEEEEEEEHHH?!Judge:\nVery well then. Counsel, you have five minutes.Sholmes:\nMy dear fellow, I apologise for my tardy arrival.Ryunosuke:\nMr Sholmes! Are you alright now?Sholmes:\nAh ha ha ha ha hah! Alright? I'm all wrong!Ryunosuke:\nSorry?Sholmes:\nI've only just managed to summon the strength to stand, man! I asked the judge for five minutes... ...but I fear even that may prove too much for me. Pray forgive me should I pass out.Ryunosuke:\nUm...let's make this discussion as short as possible.Iris:\nHurley, this place is full of idiots! None of them can see how wonderful your chemical blood analysis is!Sholmes:\nAh well...that concoction of mine was really just a bit of sport to assist me in my investigations. I never took the trouble to refine it for appraisal by the scientific community. ...An oversight on my part.Ryunosuke:\nRight... (Modesty? Surely not...)Sholmes:\nBut enough of that. I'm here to give you this, my dear fellow.Ryunosuke:\nWhat's that? (A lavender furoshiki wrapping...?)Sholmes:\nA leaving present. From Miss Susato.Ryunosuke:\nFrom Miss Susato?Sholmes:\nIf possible, matters were to be settled without me giving you this. Those were her instructions when she asked me to do her this favour.Ryunosuke:\nI...I don't understand.Sholmes:\nMiss Susato foresaw today's events, I believe. She knew that the culprit would attempt to escape justice by means both devious and underhand. And that you, Mr Naruhodo, fighting fairly as you are wont to do, would find yourself in considerable peril. At that very moment of crisis, you were to be given this small parcel. Those were the dear lady's instructions.Ryunosuke:\n(A leaving present from Susato-san... Whatever could it be?) What is this?Iris:\nOh! It's...it's the machine I made!Ryunosuke:\nAh!Wagahai:\nMiaow.Iris:\nLook! I used this! It's my latest invention!Ryunosuke:\nWhat...what is that?Iris:\nI call it...the Cat-Flapomat! It can make a cat flap for a little furry friend like Waggy in seconds!Iris:\nWhat's Susie up to?Sholmes:\nMiss Susato muttered the following words before she left: 'I'm a failure. I don't deserve to be a judicial assistant.'Ryunosuke:\nWhat? (Didn't she say something like that...?)Ryunosuke:\nYou really are the best judicial assistant in the world.Susato:\nWell...that's extremely flattering. But I'm sorry to say... ...that I've been a complete failure.Ryunosuke:\nWhatever did she mean by that, Mr Sholmes?Sholmes:\n......... That night, when you left Windibank's in pursuit of the thieves... ...Miss Susato made use of this contraption for...a certain purpose. That is your answer, dear fellow.Ryunosuke:\n(Not, not at all cryptic then... Susato-san used this Cat-Flapomat that night? But why?)The Cat-Flapomat has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks:\n...Your five minutes...is over.Examine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCat-Flapomat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrip or trigger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nWhew! Those vicious teeth look like they could rip through almost anything!\nIris:\nThey're good, aren't they? They're made of a special alloy I developed just for this job. The cutter rotates ten times per second so it can get through any kind of door in no time at all!\nRyunosuke:\nAnd...what are the two parts at the top there?\nIris:\nAh, those are for attaching hinges to the section of door that gets cut out.\nRyunosuke:\nRight. Of course.\nIris:\nNothing can match this machine for power! It can make mincemeat of even the toughest of doors!\nRyunosuke:\n......... It sounds so charming and friendly when you say what it's for, but... ...it feels like the reality of the Cat-Flapomat is that it's a grim weapon of door destruction.\nIris:\nWagahai's so adorable, there's nothing I wouldn't do for him! Even developing deadly weapons!Ryunosuke:\n...! (We're out of time already?)Sholmes:\nI'm grateful to you for affording us that brief recess, Mr Reaper.Van Zieks:\nI need no thanks, detective. After all... ...the die is cast.Sholmes:\n...Is it really?Van Zieks:\nThe jurors are unanimous in their leanings. No doubt my learned friend will consider a summation examination... ...but any attempt to alter the verdict now would be utterly futile.Sholmes:\n......... I wonder... Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke:\nYes?Sholmes:\nThe rest is down to you, dear fellow. What is your plan?Ryunosuke:\n(The rest is down to me...? I need to be careful here. If I make a wrong move, the trial will end...badly.) My Lord! The defence requests...A summation examination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(Now it's come to this, my only chance is to appeal to the jurors and try to change their minds.)\nSholmes:\nWhat do you think you're doing, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nSholmes:\nWhat of Miss Susato's gracious gesture? Would you let this final piece of evidence she left you go to waste?\nRyunosuke:\nFinal piece of...?\nSholmes:\nThis is not a time for inaction. This is a time to hear from a witness!\nRyunosuke:\nBut, but it's not possible for me to bring a new witness to the stand at this point!\nIris:\nI don't think that's what Hurley means, Runo.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nIris:\nHave you forgotten where we are in the trial?\nRyunosuke:\n......... (Ah-ha!)\nJudge:\nIf the defence has nothing more to add, I think we should proceed to the adjudication.\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWait, My Lord! The defence requests...\nLeads to:\n\"...further cross-examination.\"Further cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"...further cross-examination.\"Time to think\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(It's no good... I need time to think...)\nSholmes:\nWhat do you think you're doing, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?\nSholmes:\nWhat of Miss Susato's gracious gesture? Would you let this final piece of evidence she left you go to waste?\nRyunosuke:\nFinal piece of...?\nSholmes:\nThis is not a time for inaction. This is a time to hear from a witness!\nRyunosuke:\nBut, but it's not possible for me to bring a new witness to the stand at this point!\nIris:\nI don't think that's what Hurley means, Runo.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nIris:\nHave you forgotten where we are in the trial?\nRyunosuke:\n......... (Ah-ha!)\nJudge:\nIf the defence has nothing more to add, I think we should proceed to the adjudication.\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWait, My Lord! The defence requests...\nLeads to:\n\"...further cross-examination.\"Ryunosuke:\n...further cross-examination.Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nThe jurors have spoken! Protocol dictates that you may not cross-examine a new witness now.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nThe defence is not asking for the cross-examination of a new witness. Rather to continue with one of an existing witness.Van Zieks:\nWhat?Sholmes:\nIt would appear that a rather important detail has escaped your attention, Mr Reaper.???:My Lord!Bailiff:\nRequesting Your Lordship's permission to interrupt the cross-examination!Judge:\nThank you, Officer. Very well, the cross-examination is hereby temporarily suspended. I presume you have no objection, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\nUm... No, My Lord.Iris:\nSo nobody can say anything then! If Runo asks to resume his cross-examination of Mr Graydon...Sholmes:\n...The court is obliged to allow it!Van Zieks:\nThis...is absurd!Judge:\n......... I would remind those present that this is my courtroom. I concur that the defence is entirely within its rights to request the continuation of the cross-examination. However, I will not permit an unremitting protraction of these proceedings. Therefore... ...I have decided to afford the defence one final opportunity in concluding the cross-examination.Ryunosuke:\n...!Judge:\nCounsel, you must choose but one statement from the witness's testimony... ...and but one piece of evidence to present in support of your argument against it.Ryunosuke:\n(A single chance to present evidence...?)Judge:\nIf, following that, the situation remains unchanged, I shall move to adjudication. Is that clear, Counsels? You will not press the witness any further!Van Zieks:\nMy Lord.Ryunosuke:\nYes, My Lord!Sholmes:\nHm... A single statement and a single piece of evidence. ...Most generous. Well then, Mr Naruhodo. It's high time I...fell in a dead faint. I leave this...in your capable hands...*Thud!*Ryunosuke:\nMis...MR SHOOOOOOOOOLMES!Judge:\nTo stand so insouciantly before the court in a state of such high fever... Either the man has extraordinary strength of mind, or an extraordinary lack of feeling.Van Zieks:\nI imagine he's feeling very little now. The detective is sleeping soundly in one of the antechambers.Ryunosuke:\n(Strike a man when he's down, why don't you?)Judge:\nWell then, Counsel...are you fully prepared?Ryunosuke:\n...Yes. (One statement... One piece of evidence... I won't let Mr Sholmes down. Or Iris. And I won't waste this final chance that Susato-san has given me. This is going to decide the entire outcome of the trial!)Judge:\nVery well, then. Under the terms I have outlined...you may resume the cross-examination!Cross-Examination\n- The Moment of the Shooting Again -",

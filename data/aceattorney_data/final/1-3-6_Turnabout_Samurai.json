Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people!\nPhoenix:\nYoung...?

Not like you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHey! Don't talk to me like I'm your grandpa or something. I'm only 24 myself.\nMaya:\nThen watch it with me! He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, \"Steel Samurai\" was no. 1!

You mean the guy on that show?\nMaya:\nYes! They're saying that the Steel Samurai killed a villain!\nPhoenix:\n... Umm... Isn't that what he's supposed to do?\nMaya:\nYeah, on TV!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, on TV.\nMaya:\nNo! I mean, he actually did it! In real life!

Please, Nick!\nCellular:\n*beep*\nOctober 16, 9:22 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's here... watching television.)\nTV:\nNow for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.\" He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the \"Evil Magistrate.\" His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The \"Samurai Spear\" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.\nPhoenix:\n... This has to be a joke.\nMaya:\nNo, no, no!

It's him! In the flesh!\nMaya:\nUmm... Is that guy really him?\nPhoenix:\nWhaddya mean \"that guy\"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him.\nMaya:\nUm, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.\nPhoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?\nWill:\nUmm...\nMaya:\nY-yes!?\nWill:\nSomething wrong...?\nMaya:\nN-no! No!\nPhoenix:\n(This is getting off to a great start.)\nWill:\nI know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?\nMaya:\nD-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.\nWill:\nNo, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams.\nMaya:\nOh...\nWill:\nI guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!\nMaya:\nNick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nHe's a good guy! I mean, he's good!\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nMaya:\nHe didn't do it!\nPhoenix:\n...\nAfter clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option:\nPhoenix:\nI think I should probably check out the scene of the murder...\nWill:\nRight...

Awesome! Aren't you excited!?\nOldbag:\nHey! You there! You want in, you gotta go through me!\nMaya:\nO-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers.\nOldbag:\nOh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.\nMaya:\nG-gawkers?\nOldbag:\nGawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...\nMaya:\nUmm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say \"no.\"\nPhoenix:\nI dunno! It's possible.\nOldbag:\nHey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nOldbag:\nIsn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here.

Show me a \"letter of request.\" And maybe I'll just let you in.\nMaya:\nThis lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously.\nDetention Center\nWill:\nHello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they?\nMaya:\nN-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nRight, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect.\nWill:\n*sniff*\nWright & Co. Law Offices\nStudio - Main Gate\nPhoenix:\nMa'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers.\nOldbag:\nHmm...? Yes, yes. I recognize the bold, childish scrawl.\nGave Powers's Request to the security lady.\nOldbag:\nTo think he would entrust his fate to youths of such unreliable appearance... Really!\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nOldbag:\nAnyway, you may pass. But only left from here, toward the studios! No going to the right. That's the Employee Area. \"No one allowed inside, pal\" were my instructions. The good detective told me himself.\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nThere were maps in the security guard station.\nPhoenix:\nHey! Not bad!\nOldbag:\nThose are 50 cents a piece,\nthank you!\nMaya:\nWell, time to go, Nick.\nOldbag:\n50 cents!\nGuidemap of Global Studios added to the Court Record.\nOctober 16Studio One Entrance\nGumshoe:\nHey! Aren't you that murderer from the other day!\nMaya:\nAah! It's that confused detective!\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, you know Prosecutor Edgeworth is all upset, and it's your fault! I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... so?\nMaya:\nHey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work!\nGumshoe:\n!!! ... ... ...\nMaya:\nUm, Detective?\nPhoenix:\nI think you hurt his feelings.\nMaya:\nOh no! I... I'm sorry!\nPhoenix:\nWell, I think his feelings are easily hurt.\nGumshoe:\nYou're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart!\nMaya:\nHey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case!\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here?\nMaya:\nUm, well... We're on this case too, pal!\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? Hey! You can't just go saying \"pal\" like that! That's MY endearing character trait!\nMaya:\nI'd say he's a character alright...\nAfter clearing \"The investigation\" and \"Decisive evidence\" Talk options:\nGumshoe:\nWhat's wrong, pal? You seem down.\nPhoenix:\nDon't look so happy when you say that.\nGumshoe:\nOh hoh hoh hoh hoh!\nMaya:\nUmm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...\nGumshoe:\nSure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)\nMaya:\nNick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!\nStudio - Main Gate\nMaya:\nNick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...\nOldbag:\nHey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)\nOctober 16Wright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nWhat's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?\nPhoenix:\nDon't look at me! How should I know?\nOctober 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nApparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... right.\nGumshoe:\nLook pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!\nPhoenix:\nI have to ask him about that photograph!\nMaya:\nOh well. Let's try again later.\nOctober 16Global StudiosEmployee Area\nMaya:\nNick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!\nOctober 16Global StudiosDressing Room\nPhoenix:\n(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)\nMaya:\nNo one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?\nPhoenix:\nRight, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene.

That white tape! It's so... so real!\nPhoenix:\nWell, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...\nMaya:\nWow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\nPhoenix:\nYeah! So don't touch it!\nMaya:\nWhoa! It's heavier than I thought...\n???:\nHey! You! No touching that!\nPhoenix:\nAh, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...\nMaya:\n\"Y'know\"!? No I don't know!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... who are you?\nPenny:\nWho me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera.\nMaya:\nWe're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.\nPenny:\nOh, you're WP's people.\nMaya:\n\"WP\"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.\nPenny:\nI don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.\nMaya:\nDon't worry, leave it to us!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\nWhat do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nPenny:\nUmm... Sorry... I know you're busy.\nPhoenix:\nNot really.\nPenny:\nActually, there's been something bothering me.\nMaya:\nAh hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!\nPenny:\nWell, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...\nPhoenix:\nYou \"sensed\"?\nPenny:\nYes, several times.\nPhoenix:\nSome other studio employees, maybe?\nPenny:\nNo, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.\nPhoenix:\nR-really!?\nMaya:\nBut wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you're right.\nPenny:\nI'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.\nMaya:\nNo, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!\nOctober 16Global StudiosMain Gate\nOldbag:\nWhat? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost!\nOldbag:\nWhat? I saw that suspicious look on your face!\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?\nOldbag:\nSure as can be!\nMaya:\nBut we have a witness who thinks there was \"someone from outside\" here that day.\nOldbag:\nWhat!?\nMaya:\nAre you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?\nOldbag:\n...\nMaya:\nMa'am?\nOldbag:\nWho was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?\nMaya:\nEek!\nOldbag:\nAlright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?\nMaya:\nUh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.\nOldbag:\nHer! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!\nPhoenix:\nShe left...\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!\nPhoenix:\nThere! Entered! ...\nMaya:\nHey! It printed out the data for that day!\nPhoenix:\nLet's see what we got... ... Huh?\nMaya:\nHow is this a picture of Will Powers?\nPhoenix:\nWell, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him.\nMaya:\nI don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]\nMaya:\nWhat does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe there's more photo data from that day?\nMaya:\nNope--that's the only one in the computer.\nPowers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nMaya:\nWe'll put that security lady in her place with this!\nPhoenix:\nRight, we'll put her in her place...\nMaya:\nHey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!\nPhoenix:\nWait. Let's not.\nMaya:\nWhy not?\nPhoenix:\nIt's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.\nMaya:\nNick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!\nPhoenix:\nHey! Why do I have to be the villain.\nMaya:\nRelax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?\nPhoenix:\nI think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?\nTo be continued.\nBefore selecting \"ST1-307\" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate:\nOctober 16Studio One\nMaya:\nNo one's here. I wonder if the security lady got mad at that assistant?\nPhoenix:\nHmm. That's definitely a possibility.\n\nOctober 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.\nJudge:\nHmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?\nGumshoe:\nYes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)\nPhoenix:\n(I think I can probably remember that...)\nJudge:\nSo the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval!\nSamurai Spear added to the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"\nJudge:\nUnderstood.\nEdgeworth:\nLet's call this security officer to the stand!\nEdgeworth:\nWill the witness declare her name?\nOldbag:\n... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!\nEdgeworth:\nY-your name, please!\nOldbag:\nOh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"\nEdgeworth:\nYOUR NAME, PLEASE!\nPhoenix:\n(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)\nOldbag:\nWendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nO-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.\nJudge:\nObjection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.\nOldbag:\nI was just getting to the good part, dearie!\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps we can get to the testimony?\nJudge:\nNow, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?\nOldbag:\nYessey I was.\nJudge:\nAnd to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?\nOldbag:\nYou know your stuff, dearie!\nJudge:\n... You may begin your testimony.\nPhoenix:\n(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witness's Account --\nOldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!\nJudge:\nYou saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nCross Examination\n-- Witness's Account --\nOldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nOldbag:\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nOldbag:\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nOldbag:\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nOldbag:\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nOldbag:\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nOldbag:\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nOldbag:\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!\nMaya:\nNick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?\nPhoenix:\nWindbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.\nMaya:\nUgh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?\nPhoenix:\nLet me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you \"saw Mr. Powers,\" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!\nJudge:\nJ-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?\nPhoenix:\nNone other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the \"Mr. Powers\" that you saw!?\nOldbag:\nOf course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nTrue, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!\nOldbag:\n...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!\nJudge:\nNo one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.\nPhoenix:\n(He's having trouble calling her \"Oldbag\" apparently...)\nJudge:\nHowever, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?\nOldbag:\nHumph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nHuh!?\nPhoenix:\n(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!\nOldbag:\nHow was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me \"this isn't any good as evidence, pal.\" He didn't even give it a second look!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)\nJudge:\nLet's hear about your proof, then.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Man in the Photo --\nOldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...\nI saw Powers trip and fall!\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.\nNow, look at that picture!\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?\nJudge:\nHmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.\nPhoenix:\n(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)\nCross Examination\n-- The Man in the Photo --\nOldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!\nOldbag:\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...\nOldbag:\nI saw Powers trip and fall!\nOldbag:\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.\nOldbag:\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.\nOldbag:\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!\nOldbag:\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?\nPhoenix:\nWell, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...\nAfter pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:\nEdgeworth:\nI think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell, there is one thing that bothers me.\nEdgeworth:\nWhich is?\nJudge:\nWhere is this \"Steel Samurai\" costume now?\nEdgeworth:\nUmm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nAnyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose that's right.\nPhoenix:\n(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)\nEdgeworth:\nWill the witness continue her testimony, please?\nOldbag:\nNo need to ask twice!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witness's Account, cont. --\nOldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\nNo one else went there!\nIf they had, I would have seen them!\nJudge:\nHmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this \"Steel Samurai\" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.\nCross Examination\n-- Witness's Account, cont. --\nOldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?\nOldbag:\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\nOldbag:\nNo one else went there!\nOldbag:\nIf they had, I would have seen them!\nMaya:\nOld windbag sure has balls! Or... well, you know what I mean.\nPhoenix:\nOld windbags have a way of skipping over important details, after all... Or, for that matter, entirely forgetting them.\nMaya:\nHow convenient.\nPhoenix:\n(Something for you to look forward to, perhaps?)\nPhoenix:\nHold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?\nOldbag:\nYesiree, sonny.\nPhoenix:\nSo, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?\nOldbag:\nAnd here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.\nPhoenix:\nRight... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.\nOldbag:\nOoh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.\nPhoenix:\nThat very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]\nOldbag:\nEven I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!\nPhoenix:\nActually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: \"Photo #2\"...\nOldbag:\n\"Photo #2\"...?\nPhoenix:\nThe computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be \"Photo #1\" if it really was the ONLY photo!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nActually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access-- the security lady herself! (Changed from [Only someone with access... the security lady herself!] in the original release)\nOldbag:\nEh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers!\nPhoenix:\nBut the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!\nOldbag:\nUmm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean...\nJudge:\nCan the witness explain this to the court?\nOldbag:\nUmm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help!\nEdgeworth:\nHuh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either.\nOldbag:\nHumph! Some help you are! You're a whippersnapper too! ... ... Whippersnapper...?\nJudge:\nSomething the matter, Ms. Oldbag?\nOldbag:\nAh! That's right! I... I just remembered something!\nJudge:\nLet me guess... Someone else passed by the gate... someone other than the Steel Samurai?\nOldbag:\nEr... well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way.\nJudge:\n*sigh* I see. Your testimony, please.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Other Person --\nOldbag:\nEvery day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do.\nI go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.\nI throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.\nCome to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!\nEdgeworth:\nM-Ms. Oldbag! This is the first I've heard of this!\nOldbag:\nWell, of course, sonny! I've only just remembered it.\nJudge:\nRight... anyway, Mr. Wright, please begin the cross-examination.\nMaya:\nWell, I'd say this was a turn for the unexpected, but I kind of expected this...\nCross Examination\n-- The Other Person --\nOldbag:\nEvery day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do.\nOldbag:\nI go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.\nOldbag:\nI throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.\nOldbag:\nCome to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!\nMaya:\n\"Come to think of it\"? Couldn't she think of that a little earlier!?\nPhoenix:\nClassic old windbag maneuver, Maya.\nMaya:\nHmm... Might be a useful tactic to remember for use in my future career as a windbag.\nPhoenix:\n(Let's find out more about this \"erased\" photo.)\nPhoenix:\nWell, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?\nOldbag:\nHumph. A fanboy.\nPhoenix:\nF-fanboy?\nOldbag:\nSteel Samurai fanboys. Real freaks, if you ask me. They get information about the rehearsals from gosh-knows-where. They're always hanging about. One was there that day.\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nW-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? \"I locked the main gate so no one could get in\"... Those were your words!\nOldbag:\nWell! If you must know, there's a drain that goes into the Employee Area. The grate has been loose for a while. It leads outside, and well, that's where they come in.\nPhoenix:\nThey come in through the drain?\nOldbag:\nI told you they were freaks. Oh, and...\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nOldbag:\nThey're kids. Children. Whippersnappers.\nPhoenix:\nK-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?\nOldbag:\nIt was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.\nPhoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nO-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?\nOldbag:\nOh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em.\nEdgeworth:\nA boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?\nJudge:\nImpossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy.\nOldbag:\nRight! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data.\nMaya:\nUm, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and they're already trying to \"un-suspect\" him.\nJudge:\nThis court will take a five-minute recess. (Changed from [I'd like to take a five minute recess.] in the original release) I want the defense and the prosecution to consider this new information... And no forgetting vital information this time!\nOctober 18, 11:08 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nPhoenix:\nMr. WP?\nWill:\nY-yes?\nPhoenix:\nTell me straight: were you really in your dressing room? You didn't go to the studio?\nWill:\nI-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest.\nMaya:\nSo who was the \"Steel Samurai\" in that security photo?\nWill:\nHow should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really.\nMaya:\nWhat!? You should take better care of that stuff!\nWill:\nI couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me?\nPhoenix:\nIt doesn't look good...\nWill:\n*sniff*\nPhoenix:\nYou're the only likely suspect, right now.\nMaya:\nNick! W-what are we going to do!?\nPhoenix:\nFirst, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this!\nMaya:\nRight! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day!\nPhoenix:\nRight... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot.\nWill:\nYou... don't sound very optimistic.\nPhoenix:\nI'm not optimistic at all, actually.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. It's time.\nPhoenix:\nOkay. Let's go. *sigh*\nWill:\nWhat does that mean... Please don't sigh like that! *sniff*\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. (Changed from [The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of \"guilty\" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!\nJudge:\nOrder! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.\nPhoenix:\n(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)\nJudge:\nSo, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\nPhoenix:\nIt was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nW-who!?\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nW-what!? Whippersnapper!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!?\nOldbag:\nOldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you!\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!\nJudge:\nW-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?\nPhoenix:\nSimple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!\nJudge:\nI see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?\nEdgeworth:\n... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.\nOldbag:\nW-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!\nPhoenix:\n(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)\nPhoenix:\nThe very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!\nOldbag:\nB-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?\nPhoenix:\nYou forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.\nJudge:\nHmm... Indeed.\nPhoenix:\n(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)\nOldbag:\nWait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!\nJudge:\nHe's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?\nOldbag:\nTh-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!\nJudge:\nHmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThat boy is not the killer.\nOldbag:\nWhat!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\nI have proof.\nOldbag:\nP-proof!?\nJudge:\nIndeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?\nJudge:\nI see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this?\nOldbag:\nMrph.\nPhoenix:\n(The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.)\nJudge:\nVery well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name?\nEdgeworth:\nSomething \"Oldbag,\" Your Honor.\nJudge:\nThen the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned!\nOldbag:\nW-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking!\nMaya:\nOh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!\nJudge:\nMs. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony?\nOldbag:\nActually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about.\nPhoenix:\nN-not to talk about?\nEdgeworth:\nBy whom!?\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)\nJudge:\nW-well, testify!\nWitness Testimony\n-- My Lips Were Sealed --\nOldbag:\nGlobal Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.\nThere were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.\nThey said they had \"nothing to do with it,\" see?\nSo they told me to just pretend they \"hadn't been at the studios that day.\"\nBut if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Oldbag! This is crucial information! Why did you keep this from the court until now!?\nOldbag:\nAin't you been listening? They told me to shut my trap, and I always do what I'm told.\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(No, this isn't a bad dream, Your Honor. Witness the power of the Oldbag...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... Your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- My Lips Were Sealed --\nOldbag:\nGlobal Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.\nOldbag:\nThere were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.\nOldbag:\nThey said they had \"nothing to do with it,\" see?\nOldbag:\nSo they told me to just pretend they \"hadn't been at the studios that day.\"\nOldbag:\nBut if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!\nMaya:\nNick! I guess pressing her was the right thing to do! For an old windbag, she sure likes keeping secrets... Let's get as much information as we can!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. We have learned there were others at Global Studios on the day in question. The director and the producer and, er, some bigwigs, were all present. Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point. The prosecution will gather more information about the witness, Ms. Oldbag... and more information about these other people we have just been told of!\nEdgeworth:\n... I understand, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nThis ends the day's proceedings in the trial of Mr. Will Powers. That is all. The court is adjourned!\nOctober 18, 1:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3\nWill:\nTh-thank you so much, Mr. Wright. I was right to ask you to defend me.\nMaya:\nAww, really, it's nothing. *grin* Oh, or should I... *sniff*\nPhoenix:\nWe'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination!\nMaya:\nSo, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think, Mr. Powers?\nWill:\nI don't think it was her, really.\nMaya:\nNeither do I, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers.\nMaya:\nPoor old windbag... I feel kinda sorry for her.\nPhoenix:\nWell, she wasn't winning any points in there, with or without my accusation. Okay, let's get down to the studios.\nMaya:\nRight! We'll be back to visit you soon...\nWill:\nTh-thanks. Thanks, guys. *sniff*\nTo be continued.\n\nOctober 18Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nWhew, what a day.\nMaya:\nThis is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?\nPhoenix:\nI guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.\nMaya:\nThe director and producer...?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, them.\nMaya:\nWell, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!\nOctober 18Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nWill:\nOh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier.\nPhoenix:\nNot at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.\nMaya:\nYou can say that again!\nPhoenix:\nLet's not.\nMaya:\nSo, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?\nWill:\nHmm... S-sorry, but no.\nMaya:\nBe sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.\nPhoenix:\nWe can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow.\nWill:\nY-yes... *sniff*\nOctober 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain Gate\nMaya:\nNo one's here.\nPhoenix:\nRight, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her...\nMaya:\nH-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!\nOctober 18Studio One Entrance\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.\nMaya:\nSo, Nick... Remember that \"Studio Two\" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I think that's what they said.\nMaya:\nMaybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!\nOctober 18Studio One\nMaya:\nI... don't really want to be in here.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... It is a murder scene.\nMaya:\nI want to go someplace else. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh*...)\nOctober 18Studio Two Entrance\nMaya:\nThis... is Studio Two?\nPhoenix:\nI thought so...\nMaya:\nIt doesn't really look much like a \"studio,\" does it?\nPhoenix:\nNo, that it does not.\nMaya:\nHey...

Oh... oh hoh hoh!\nPenny:\nActually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain...\nPhoenix:\nYou mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)\nPenny:\nI... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?\nMaya:\nYeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?\nPenny:\nR-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.\nMaya:\nOh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!\nPenny:\nYou're right! I won't!\nPhoenix:\n(Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...)\nPenny:\nUm, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag.\nMaya:\nRight! See you later, then!\nPenny:\nGood luck with your investigation.\nOctober 18Global StudiosDressing Room\nMaya:\nThis is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.\nPhoenix:\nThat's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.\nMaya:\nBut Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?\nPhoenix:\nHuh...

How could I, a sweet little old lady, wear a giant suit like that?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers is pretty tall...\nOldbag:\nAs soon as they saw there was no way I could wear it, they let me go.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that would rule out her being the murderer.)\nOldbag:\nAnyway!

(What an original name...)\nVasquez:\nIts head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One.\nMaya:\nW-what!?\nVasquez:\nIt's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.\nPhoenix:\nB-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One!\nVasquez:\n2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come.\nOutside Studio One\nVasquez:\n... That's \"Mr. Monkey.\" When it wasn't broken, it announced the time... in \"ooks.\" One \"ook\" per hour. Ook ook ook ook. Always with the ooking.\nPhoenix:\n(It IS a monkey, after all.)\nVasquez:\nCheck its head. The clock inside stopped when it broke.\nMaya:\n...! Nick, it's stopped at 2:15.\nPhoenix:\n2:15...?\nVasquez:\nThat's right. This path was blocked from 2:15 till after 4:00. Therefore, we're innocent.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Hammer died in Studio One at 2:30...\nVasquez:\nSee? Good bye.\nMr. Monkey's Head data added to the Court Record.

I got a hostage now, whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(A \"hostage\"...!?)\nMia:\nWhy don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nI guess it can't hurt. Here you go, Ms. Oldbag.\nCardkey lent to Ms. Oldbag.\nOldbag:\n... Listen to me, sonny. I don't like having debts to no whippersnappers. You take this, and we're even. Deal?\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this...? A Steel Samurai trading card?\nOldbag:\nThat sneaky kid dropped it! I figure it's pretty important to him, though.\nPhoenix:\nThank you, I may have a use for this. (This must be the \"hostage\" she was talking about.)\nSteel Samurai Card added to the Court Record.\nOldbag:\nRight.

What brings you here?\nPenny:\nOh, well, I had to arrange some stuff... Umm...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nPenny:\nThe, um, girl with you. Doesn't she seem a little different? Like, is she even the same person as before?\nPhoenix:\nUm, nope! She's the same as always.\nMia:\nSame as always.\nPenny:\nOkay... whatever you say...\nPhoenix:\nDo you know anything about this?\nPenny:\nHey, that's a Steel Samurai trading card. I collect those, actually. I'm one card away from a complete set!\nPhoenix:\nA complete set?\nPenny:\nYeah, a set of one of each card.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...\nPenny:\n... Wait...Waitwaitwaitwait!!! That's it!!! That's the card I need! You don't know how long I've been looking for it!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nPenny:\nI don't care what kind of girl you might think I am, I need that card! P-please! I beg you! Please trade with me!\nPhoenix:\nT-trade with you?\nPenny:\nYes, trade cards! Look, I'll even trade you an Ultra Rare Premium card!\nPhoenix:\nTrade me a... huh?\nPenny:\nYes, it's a good deal for your Ultra Rare! Please!!!\nMia:\nPhoenix! Can't you see she's desperate?\nPhoenix:\n(W-what's everybody getting so excited about...?)\nPenny:\nReally!? Th-thanks!!! Then this is for you.\nURP Card added to the Court Record.\nPenny:\nYaa-hoo!\nPhoenix:\n(And there she goes...)\nMia:\nDoesn't doing good things like that make you feel great?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Yeah, it does.\nDressing Room\nPhoenix:\nSee this card?\nCody:\nYeah, so... Wait! That's it!!! That's the last Ultra Rare Premium card I need! C'mon give it to me, please! You gotta give it to me!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, I've never seen him so... eager.) R-right! Okay! How about a trade?\nCody:\nYou're on! I'll give you a \"Samurai Spear\" and throw in an \"Evil Magistrate\" to boot!!\nPhoenix:\nNo no no no... not that kind of trade. I don't want cards. I want information.\nCody:\nHuh? You sure? Fine by me!\nURP Card given to Cody. (Changed from [Gave URP Card to Cody.] in the original release)\nMia:\nOkay, Phoenix. Let's hear what he has to say. If he knows something that could help us, we can have him take the stand tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nCody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?\nCody:\n... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that...\nMia:\nWhat is it, Cody?\nCody:\nTh-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see. It must have been hard for you.\nCody:\nMan, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... right.) Mia?\nMia:\nYes?\nPhoenix:\nI think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.\nMia:\nTrue enough.\nPhoenix:\nAnd the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.\nMia:\nIndeed.\nPhoenix:\nSo... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!\nMia:\n... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be \"guilty\" for sure.\nPhoenix:\nLet's not call him then...\nMia:\nI think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.\n???:\nNot so fast, pal!\nGumshoe:\nI heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct!\nCody:\nNo! I ain't going! Waah!\nMia:\n... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court.\nPhoenix:\nW-what're we going to do, Mia!\nMia:\nWell, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there!\nMia:\nPhoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent?\nPhoenix:\nGreat! Thanks, Mia!\nMia:\nSee you soon.\nTo be continued.\n\nOctober 19, 9:42 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nWill:\n... ... Umm... Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nWill:\nWhy do you look so... unhappy?\nPhoenix:\nO-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)\nMia:\nPhoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.\nPhoenix:\nThis is no time for dead-people jokes, please.\nMia:\nYou know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.\nPhoenix:\nSomething \"overlooked\"...?\nMia:\nWe have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.\nPhoenix:\n(This isn't going to be easy.)\nOctober 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.\nEdgeworth:\nAn unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.\nJudge:\nVery well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release)\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.\nPhoenix:\n(...or that director.)\nEdgeworth:\nWill the witness state his name and profession?\nManella:\n... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL!\nEdgeworth:\n...\nManella:\nS... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.\nJudge:\nWere you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?\nManella:\nY-yes, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.\nMia:\nPhoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!\nPhoenix:\nR-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Day of the Murder --\nManella:\nI was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.\nDuring the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.\nIt took a lot more time than I thought it would.\nI hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...\nBut I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.\nWe were in the meeting until around 4:00...\nDuring the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.\nThat's about it.\nJudge:\nHmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.\nCross Examination\n-- The Day of the Murder --\nManella:\nI was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.\nManella:\nDuring the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.\nManella:\nIt took a lot more time than I thought it would.\nManella:\nI hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...\nManella:\nBut I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.\nManella:\nWe were in the meeting until around 4:00...\nManella:\nDuring the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.\nMia:\nPhoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!\nPhoenix:\nR-right!\nPhoenix:\nWait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?\nManella:\nOops! ROFL!\nPhoenix:\nWell?\nManella:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nMr. Manella, what's this all about?\nManella:\nW-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.\nMia:\nPhoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.\nManella:\nUrk!\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Break --\nManella:\nYeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!\nBut it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!\nNot enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!\nThat's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- The Break --\nManella:\nYeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!\nManella:\nBut it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!\nManella:\nNot enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!\nManella:\nThat's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*\nMia:\nWell, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nThat testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!\nMia:\nAll you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, great. Is that all...)\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHaven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nSomething wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright?\nMia:\nPhoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!\nJudge:\nDo you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?\nEdgeworth:\nI believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-what? It's over?)\nJudge:\nVery well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.\nJudge:\nWho is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nMy witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!\nJudge:\nOrder! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!\nOctober 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...\nMia:\n... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.\nPhoenix:\nM-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?\nMia:\n... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.\nWill:\nUmm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!\nMia:\nDon't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.\nWill:\nI... You... Thanks. *sniff*\nMia:\nOkay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!\nOctober 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4\nJudge:\nCourt is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?\nJudge:\nOh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.\nEdgeworth:\nWill the witness state his name and grade in school.\nCody:\n...\nEdgeworth:\nWitness!\nCody:\nWhat!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!\nEdgeworth:\nMrph...\nMia:\nCody? Answer his question, okay?\nCody:\nH-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!\nPhoenix:\n(I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.\nEdgeworth:\nM-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.\nPhoenix:\n(He's having trouble with this \"gentle\" thing.)\nEdgeworth:\nYou were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?\nCody:\nYou got a problem with that!?\nEdgeworth:\nPlease tell us what you saw that day.\nCody:\nWhat, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?\nEdgeworth:\nJust.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.\nJudge:\nI prefer \"bearded gentleman\" myself.\nPhoenix:\n(A very long day...)\nJudge:\nIncidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.\nEdgeworth:\nM-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.\nPhoenix:\nWait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?\nCody:\nHey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!\nMia:\nPhoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.\nCody's Camera added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nVery well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Witness's Account --\nCody:\nI wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.\nI found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.\nI went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.\nI was going for the studio.\nI got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.\nWhen I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!\nIt totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!\nOf course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!\nIf I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.\nAnyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. But be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child. (Changed from [And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.] in the original release)\nCody:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...)\nCross Examination\n-- Witness's Account --\nCody:\nI wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.\nCody:\nI found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.\nCody:\nI went through the woods, off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.\nCody:\nI was going for the studio.\nCody:\nI got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.\nCody:\nWhen I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!\nCody:\nIt totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!\nCody:\nOf course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!\nCody:\nIf I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess seeing the killing freaked him out and he went home...)\nMia:\nPhoenix. Remember, he's a child. Use gentle words... but be firm.\nPhoenix:\n(Easy for you to say...)\nPhoenix:\nCody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange. Didn't you say before that you always bring your digital camera wherever you go? You were quite clear about that.\nCody:\nHuh!?\nPhoenix:\nCody, you shouldn't lie here. You understand that, right?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! A word with you...\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... was I putting the pressure on too much?)\nJudge:\nWhat is this \"digital\" camera contraption you're talking about?\nPhoenix:\nIt's umm... a digital camera, Your Honor. It's kind of a new sort of camera. (How do I explain that!?)\nJudge:\nI see.\nPhoenix:\nAnyway, Cody... I can't believe you wouldn't bring your camera on a trip to the studios! You did bring it, didn't you?\nCody:\nUmm...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright! How cruel you are, to terrorize a poor child so!\nPhoenix:\nI don't care if he's a child or a prosecuting attorney! No one should lie in court!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean \"or a prosecuting attorney\"!?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Cody?\nCody:\nWh-what! Yeah, so I had my camera. So what!? You got a problem with that!?\nJudge:\nSo, you did have a camera? And did you use this camera?\nCody:\nW-why would I use it? I... I was too busy watching.\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about what you were so busy watching.\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Saw --\nCody:\nY-yeah, I had my camera with me.\nBut I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!\nThe Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!\nThen... then the bad guy stopped moving!\nHe's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules!\nJudge:\nHmm... Ah? Is that all? Well, that was brief. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Saw --\nCody:\nY-yeah, I had my camera with me.\nCody:\nBut I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!\nCody:\nThe Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!\nCody:\nThen... then the bad guy stopped moving!\nCody:\nHe's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules!\nPhoenix:\n(Something about his account doesn't seem right...)\nMia:\nPhoenix. It doesn't seem right because he's being deliberately vague! Press him on the facts, Phoenix! Find out what he saw!\nPhoenix:\nCody.\nCody:\nWh-what!?\nPhoenix:\nSomething's bothering me. Before you said that you \"couldn't take your eyes off\" the action.\nCody:\nY-yeah? So what?\nPhoenix:\nYet you missed the most important part!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou know as well as I do that he's being vague! Tell me, what kind of murderer uses a \"Samurai Slap\"!?\nEdgeworth:\nM-mmph!\nPhoenix:\nMy point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... er, that's the thing...\nMia:\nPhoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof!\nJudge:\nWhat's that? The camera...?\nPhoenix:\nThe witness stated that he recently received this camera.\nJudge:\nYes, I'm aware of that.\nPhoenix:\nHe wasn't entirely familiar with its operation.\nJudge:\nI'm aware of that, too. Ah!\nPhoenix:\nCorrect! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture!\nCody:\nHey!\nPhoenix:\nBullseye!\nCody:\nW-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!?\nPhoenix:\n(Pressing, not picking...)\nMia:\nGood job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!\nPhoenix:\nRight! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?\nCody:\n... ... ... Yeah.\nMia:\nWell, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!\nPhoenix:\nR-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.\nJudge:\nV-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?\nCody:\nUmm...\nPhoenix:\n(Welcome to the real world, kid!)\nWitness Testimony\n-- No Photo? --\nCody:\nYeah, you're right, pops.\nThe Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.\nSo I held up my camera to take a picture!\nBut the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.\nTh-that's all that happened. Yup.\nJudge:\nHmm... Anything strange in that testimony, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure... But I'd like to proceed with the cross-examination anyway.\nCross Examination\n-- No Photo? --\nCody:\nYeah, you're right, pops.\nCody:\nThe Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.\nCody:\nSo I held up my camera to take a picture!\nCody:\nBut the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.\nCody:\nTh-that's all that happened. Yup.\nCody:\nI took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.\nPhoenix:\n(How can I pick holes in such a short testimony?)\nMia:\nThere has to be something. Dig up the dirt, Phoenix! Find out what this kid's all about!\nPhoenix:\nCody!\nCody:\nWh-wh-what!? Man, every time you say \"Cody\" you follow it with something bad.\nPhoenix:\nI just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day.\nCody:\nHuh? O-oh... right.\nPhoenix:\nWhat was it you told me then?\nCody:\nI go to every live performance! I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection!\nPhoenix:\nCody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album?\nCody:\nAh!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... What exactly is this album?\nPhoenix:\nIt's called \"Path to Glory.\" It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won!\nJudge:\nI... I see.\nPhoenix:\nDon't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day!\nJudge:\nOrder! Mr. Wright. Have you an explanation? If the Steel Samurai had just defeated his adversary... I certainly would expect to see a picture of it in this album...\nPhoenix:\nExactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! (No... wait... no way!)\nMia:\nPhoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is!\nPhoenix:\nM-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...?\nMia:\nYes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please explain to the court what is going on here! Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder? Why would the boy have erased the photos he took?\nPhoenix:\nI can think of only one reason, Your Honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos.\nJudge:\nYou mean the Steel Samurai... lost?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai!\nCody:\nN-n-n-no way! No! I-it's impossible! Th-the Steel Samurai never loses! He never loses to anyone! Ever!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. He couldn't handle the truth!\nJudge:\nO-Order! I will have order! W-witness! I mean, Cody! Is this true!? W-what did you see? Tell the court what you saw!\nCody:\nI...... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\nPhoenix:\nCody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right?\nCody:\nWaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay okay! Y-you're right! Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell down... Th-then he didn't m-move... Waaaaaaaaah!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was the murderer, not the victim!\nPhoenix:\nYet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! What's going on?\nPhoenix:\nApparently, we have all made a serious error.\nEdgeworth:\nAn... error? What's this all about!?\nPhoenix:\nIf you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not the killer, he was the victim! Don't you see? Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! So, the Steel Samurai in this photograph... You're saying the man in this costume was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury.\nJudge:\nB-but wait! Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone to Studio One already?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony?\nOldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume.\nJudge:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\nJudge:\nBut why would the victim do such a thing?\nPhoenix:\nI... don't know.\nCody:\n... I get it!\nPhoenix:\n?\nCody:\nI thought that the Steel Samurai was moving strange. So it was a different person inside the suit! Pops!\nPhoenix:\nHuh, me? What?\nCody:\nActually, there was one piece of data I saved.\nPhoenix:\nData?\nCody:\nYeah, a photo on my digital camera!\nPhoenix:\n! W-what!?\nEdgeworth:\nShow us, quick!\nCody:\nNo way man, not if you're gonna look at me like that!\nJudge:\nNow!\nCody:\n*sniff* Here... This is it.\nJudge:\n... Well, looking at this it's still a little hard to say. I'm afraid that it could be anyone in that costume. Your opinion, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence.\nJudge:\nI'm sorry, this doesn't look like it's the proof we need. I'll give it back.\nMia:\nWait, Phoenix!\nPhoenix:\nMia? What?\nMia:\nLook at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial!\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please?\nJudge:\nC-certainly. I don't see why not.\nMia:\nPhoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo!\nPhoenix:\n(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Look at this!\nJudge:\nI see... a gate?\nPhoenix:\nMight I draw your attention to the number on that gate?\nJudge:\nThe number? Ah yes. Well, it's hard to see, but it looks like a \"2.\"\nPhoenix:\nClearly not a \"1,\" Your Honor, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nAaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nI believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at.\nEdgeworth:\nB-but... Th-that's impossible!\nJudge:\nHmm? Eh? What's this all about? Please explain so that I might be shocked along with the rest of the court.\nPhoenix:\nI'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say \"1\" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! (Show the judge where the murder took place!)\nPhoenix:\nHere, at Studio Two.\nJudge:\nI see! That would explain the \"2\" on the gate in the photo.\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!\nJudge:\nO-order! Order!\nPhoenix:\nThe defense makes the following claims: The scene of the crime was Studio Two! The person that the security guard, Ms. Oldbag saw was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer! Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThis is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! The victim! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!?\nPhoenix:\nW-well, no, of course not...\nJudge:\nHmm...\nEdgeworth:\nOr do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume!\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!\nPhoenix:\nThis is it.\nJudge:\nAn empty... medicine bottle?\nPhoenix:\nI found this on the table in the Employee Area. The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads \"sleeping pills.\"\nJudge:\n\"Sleeping pills\"...?\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer!\nJudge:\nWait a moment... That bottle does raise some suspicions, yes. But there is no proof that Mr. Hammer used it.\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, I have an idea.\nJudge:\nAn... idea? Very well, let's hear it.\nPhoenix:\nI want to check this bottle for fingerprints! If my claim is true, Mr. Hammer's fingerprints should show up on this bottle!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm...\nJudge:\nI suppose you're right. Very well. The court will take possession of the bottle.\nEmpty Bottle given to the judge.\nJudge:\nThis court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Cody Hackin's [sic] testimony has revealed new possibilities in this case. In fact, things may have happened very differently than we previously thought. The Steel Samurai seen by Ms. Oldbag may have been the victim, Jack Hammer. The scene of the crime was not Studio One, but Studio Two. And those in the trailer did have time to commit murder. Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nYour homework is to find the answer to the following question: Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Also, who killed him, and why? Find the answers for me by tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\n(That's a lot of homework!)\nJudge:\nMr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nMm?\nJudge:\nYou will need to reconsider your stance in this case. Above all, you will need to reconsider your suspicion of Mr. Will Powers.\nEdgeworth:\nAs you say, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nThis trial will be extended until tomorrow. This is the last extension! Very well... Court is adjourned!\nOctober 19, 2:47 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1\nPhoenix:\nWhew! That was a close one!\nMia:\nWe were saved by a hair, but that's all that counts. I thought seriously about going home about three times during the trial.\nPhoenix:\nM-me too!\nWill:\nReally? You both seemed so... so confident!\nPhoenix:\nHah! Maybe I should take up a career in acting? I was ready to pronounce you dead about three times back there.\nMia:\nMe too!\nWill:\nD-dead!?\nMia:\nHoh hoh. Of course, we're kidding.\nWill:\nAre you sure?\nPhoenix:\n(I wasn't kidding...) Now, Mr. Powers. We have to go make our final investigation. But I promise you, we'll find the true killer by tomorrow's trial!\nWill:\nR-right! Thanks! *sniff*\nTo be continued.\n\nOctober 19, 3:27 PMWright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nThat was a close one, huh, Mia?\nMaya:\nReally? Too bad, I'm sorry I missed it.\nPhoenix:\n? M-Maya!\nMaya:\nSo, what happened?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I think I've got a pretty good idea who did it. Now all I need is a motive... and proof.\nMaya:\nWow! Good going, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nUnder the \"initial trial\" system, tomorrow is the last day we have.\nMaya:\n\"Initial trial\"...? What's that?\nPhoenix:\nThat's the new court system they introduced two or three years ago. They had so many cases in the system, they decided to speed the whole process up.\nMaya:\nSo, under that system, trials have to end in three days?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, pretty much. Well, we've no time to waste!\nOctober 19Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nWill:\nMr. Wright! You did very well again today... Thank you!\nPhoenix:\nOh... thanks. Um, could you not look like you're about to burst into tears...?\nMaya:\nWow, Nick! You must have really wowed 'em in there.\nPhoenix:\nAnd could you wipe that grin off your face? (Changed from [You could stop looking so... vulnerable, too.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nHey, WP! Only one day left! Let's make it count!\nWill:\nYes... Though there's not really anything I can do to help.\nMaya:\nHah hah hah! I'm not really sure what I can do, either.\nPhoenix:\nPlease... this is no laughing matter.\nOctober 19Global StudiosMain Gate\nOldbag:\n... ... ...\nMaya:\nThe old windbag sure is quiet today.\nOldbag:\n...\nMaya:\nYou know, this place is really... peaceful, like this.\nOldbag:\n...\nMaya:\nNick? I think her guard's down...\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah?\nMaya:\nI bet we could even eat those donuts in the guard station... if we wanted.\nOldbag:\n... You eat, you die.\nMaya:\nWhew! She's alive!\nOctober 19Studio One Entrance\nMaya:\nThink back, Nick, to the day of the murder... Mr. Hammer put on the Steel Samurai costume. Then he left from here to go to Studio Two...?\nPhoenix:\nRight.\nMaya:\nBut why? I wonder if someone called him...? Like the director, or the producer...?\nOctober 19Studio Two Entrance\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... It's Ms. Vasquez! Hello?\nVasquez:\n...\nMaya:\nH-E-L-L-O!\nVasquez:\n...\nMaya:\nH! E! L! L! O!\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya! You should at least try to be polite...\nVasquez:\n... I'm watching the clouds. ...\nPhoenix:\n(That's all she had to say, apparently...)\nOctober 19Studio Two Trailer\nMaya:\n... Wasn't the assistant cleaning up yesterday? Funny, it still seems pretty messy in here.\nPhoenix:\nI guess she was still on a high from getting that rare card she needed.\nOctober 19Global StudiosEmployee Area\nMaya:\nI guess they're not filming today, either. I did want to see them filming... just one time.\nPhoenix:\nThis trial will be over and done by tomorrow. You can come see them film later.\nMaya:\nI guess... This is where you found that bottle of sleeping pills, right?\nPhoenix:\nUh huh.\nMaya:\nI wonder if there're any other clues lying around.\nGumshoe:\nYaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarh! No no no! No touchin'!\nMaya:\nEeek!\nGumshoe:\nOh, sorry, pal. Didn't mean to frighten you.\nMaya:\nD-didn't mean...? I almost had a heart attack!\nGumshoe:\nHeh heh. I guess I can be a little dramatique at times... I suppose it's the actor in me...\nPhoenix:\n(\"Dramatique\" indeed...)\nGumshoe:\nAhem. Anyway, I'm here to examine the plate on that table.\nPhoenix:\nWait, are you looking for sleeping pills?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal. Traces thereof.\nBefore clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nOctober 18Global StudiosDressing Room\nMaya:\nEmpty dressing rooms like this are kinda lonely, aren't they?\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure Mr. Powers will be back soon. He'll be fine...\nMaya:\nY-yeah...\nDressing Room (after clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)\nPenny:\nOh! Hello!\nMaya:\nWhat are you doing here?\nPenny:\nOh... I was just cleaning up the dressing room. I guess WP won't be using it anymore, so...\nMaya:\nWha!? What!? Why!? But WP's innocent!\nPenny:\nYes, and I'm really grateful for all you've done. But... This week is the last episode of the Steel Samurai...\nMaya:\nWhat!? Nooooooooooooooooo!\nStudio - Main Gate (after clearing \"Five years ago\" Talk option upon clearing \"Studio policy\" Talk option in Global Studios - Dressing Room)\nOldbag:\nWhat, you're still slinking around? If you like the place so much, why don't you take over for me?\nMaya:\nThe old windbag doesn't look so good...\nOldbag:\nE-everybody's doing their darnedest to forget Hammer. Who do they think made Global Studios what it is today? Hammer! It's all due to Hammer!\nMaya:\nShe's starting to froth at the mouth, Nick... Maybe we should keep a safe distance?\nOldbag:\n...! ... ... I see. Poor, poor Hammer. You did wrong, Hammer, rest your soul.\nMaya:\nMs. Oldbag...?\nOldbag:\nOkay. You win. I'll talk. I'm tired, see... Tired of holding it all in.\nPhoenix:\nMs. Oldbag...\nOldbag:\nYou're right. Five years ago there was an accident... a fatal accident. What's worse, a paparazzi took a photo of it. That photo, well, it caused quite a stir. And guess who made it all better? Vasquez! She has ties to the mafia... She silenced that paparazzi. That was the beginning. After that, she became a force to be reckoned with here at the studio.\nMaya:\nI see...!\nOldbag:\nBut, you have to understand... Poor old Hammer never meant any harm to anyone!\nMaya:\nMs. Oldbag...\nOldbag:\nHold on a minute.\nMaya:\nPoor Ms. Oldbag...\nOldbag:\nHere, take this.\nPhoenix:\n...? A photograph? W-wait a second!\nOldbag:\nThis is the picture.\nPhoenix:\nIs... this the trailer in Studio Two?\nOldbag:\nHammer was supposed to fight with a bad guy on the top of those stairs, there. He pushed the other actor, and the man fell onto the flowerbox fence.\nPhoenix:\nB-but how did you get this?\nOldbag:\nIt... was a long time ago. I don't feel much like talking about it.\nPhoenix:\nI understand...\nFive-Year-Old Photo added to the Court Record.\nEmployee Area\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe must have left by now.\nPhoenix:\nHe's probably thinking about what to do in tomorrow's trial.\nMaya:\nI bet Edgeworth is pretty angry with him.\nDressing Room\nMaya:\nThe assistant must have gone off somewhere. That stuff about Mr. Hammer must have come as a shock to her.\nOutside Studio Two\nVasquez:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(She's not even looking.)\nVasquez:\nWhere.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what?\nVasquez:\nWhere did you get that?\nPhoenix:\nI, well...\nVasquez:\nOldbag.\nPhoenix:\nO-Old...?\nMaya:\nShe means the security lady, Ms. Oldbag, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nRight... anyway... Ms. Vasquez. You hid this incident from the press, didn't you? And you used it to control Mr. Hammer!\nVasquez:\n... The wind.\nPhoenix:\nThe... huh?\nVasquez:\nIt's gotten stronger, don't you think? The wind. ... Your conversation interests me. Let's talk about it more inside the trailer.\nMaya:\nNick. She went inside the trailer.\nTrailer\nVasquez:\nHmph. You came. Well then, what was that you were talking about?\nPhoenix:\n(...! Why is she so eager to talk all of a sudden?) Ms. Vasquez. You were using that accident! You were blackmailing Mr. Hammer so you could control him, weren't you? That's why he was doing kids' shows for petty change!\nVasquez:\nHmph... So I'm a blackmailer now?\nMaya:\nWell, that's what it was, wasn't it! I mean, sure, it was an accident... But you used it to drag Mr. Hammer down from his rightful place as a star!\nVasquez:\nOh...? I haven't pulled anyone down from anywhere. Mr. Hammer's career went sour of its own accord.\nMaya:\nB-but! You were the cause! You pressured him... And to think it was just an accident...!\nVasquez:\nExcuse me! What is this all about? You keep saying \"accident,\" \"accident\"... How are you so sure?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nVasquez:\nMust I spell everything out for you? Think: what would it be if it wasn't an accident?\nPhoenix:\n...! No... No way! You mean Mr. Hammer did it... on purpose?\nVasquez:\nThat is what I mean.\nPhoenix:\nWh-where's your proof! Can you prove it!?\nVasquez:\nHmph! Just think! Would he have let me run his life for five years... over a mere accident? And I ran him hard, believe you me!\nMaya:\nB-but, the security lady said it was an accident!\nVasquez:\nOh. Well, she was a big fan of Hammer's, you see. She jumped on the reporter who brought that photo into the studio. She wrenched it out of his hands, she did. Gave him a few bruises, too.\nPhoenix:\n(... So that's why she had the photo...)\nVasquez:\nShe's an old fool. Of course, all the reporter would need is the negatives. He could have made a copy. But he didn't. The only copy of that photo is the one you hold. Give it to me. Now.\nMaya:\nW-what? This is valuable evidence!\nVasquez:\nBoys!\nPhoenix:\n... U-umm... Who are they...?\nVasquez:\nProfessionals. They're good at erasing... various things. What do you think...? Would you like to be erased?\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?\nVasquez:\nThe trial ends tomorrow? How unfortunate. It's a shame you'll have to miss it!\nPhoenix:\n... Tell me why. Why do you want this photograph so badly? This is Mr. Hammer's \"dirt\"... no? Why should Dee Vasquez care about it at all?\nVasquez:\n... I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to think about that where you're going. So long, friends. Boys, erase away.\nMaya:\nNooooooooooooo!\nGumshoe:\nHold it right there! I heard everything, pal! Dee Vasquez! You're coming down to the precinct with me, now!\nVasquez:\n... Hmph. Not bad. ... Very well. It appears this contest will be decided tomorrow then. In court. I'll be looking forward to it.\nGumshoe:\nH-hey, you okay, pal? Sorry I was a little late with my entrance. I don't get many chances to practice that sorta thing.\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe... Thank you thank you thank you! I was really scared...\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Don't mention it, pal. Just doing my job. ... ...\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, it's just... I've wanted to say that line ever since I became a detective. ... Okay. I've got one more job to do today. I'm sure we'll run into each other again soon!\nMaya:\nWell, Nick. It looks like we're getting close to the bottom of this.\nPhoenix:\n(And who's at the bottom...? Dee Vasquez!)\nTo be continued.",

I hope both the prosecution and the defense will be able to present decisive evidence. Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening statement.Edgeworth:\nIn yesterday's session, the defense presented us with a new theory for this case. He claims that the scene of the crime was, in fact, Studio Two. Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear.Judge:\nHmm... very well!Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)Judge:\nYou may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand. Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer who was present in the Studio Two trailer that day.Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state her name and occupation?Vasquez:\n... Dee Vasquez. I am a producer for Global Studios.Edgeworth:\nOn the day of the murder, you were in the trailer in Studio Two...Vasquez:\nAs everyone here knows, yes?Edgeworth:\n...?Vasquez:\nI dislike needless banter. If you must pontificate, do it when I'm not here.Edgeworth:\nMrrph!Judge:\nV-very well, Ms. Vasquez. Please give the court your testimony concerning the day of the murder.Maya:\nNick! I know she did it! Make her pay!Phoenix:\nR-right! (If she's guilty, I'll catch her with her pants down... So to speak.)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Vasquez:\nI entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.\nThe meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00.\nThere was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One...\nI was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.\nAt 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.\nSal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.\nWe found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One.\nThat's all.Judge:\nHmm... I have a question about one part of your testimony. You were \"fatigued\" so you had Sal \"take\" you...?Vasquez:\nThe van.Judge:\nHmm?Vasquez:\nThere's a van at Studio Two. I had him take me in that. I thought it might be risky to walk, what with that monkey's head toppling over.Van added to the Court Record.Judge:\nI... I see! Very well. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Maya:\nThis is the final battle, Nick! Let's do it!Cross Examination",

Are you always this... terse?\nVasquez:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh dear...)Vasquez:\nThe meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00..Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid no one leave during the meeting?\nVasquez:\nNo one. ...\nPhoenix:\n... C-come on... let's talk a bit more about that.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness did not come here to engage in idle conversation! Stop interrupting the testimony.\nVasquez:\nThe same could be said to you, Mr. Edgeworth. And please stop banging on your little desk. It hurts my ears.\nEdgeworth:\nMmph!Vasquez:\nThere was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd when exactly was that?\nVasquez:\nI've forgotten.\nPhoenix:\n...\nVasquez:\n...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you could try remembering?\nVasquez:\nNo.\nEdgeworth:\nThe meeting ended at 4:00, and the rehearsal was scheduled for 5:00... I would think it was between those times.\nPhoenix:\n(You \"would think\"!? C'mon, all you did was state the obvious, Edgeworth!)Vasquez:\nI was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHold on! You had Sal \"take\" you? What does that mean!?\nVasquez:\nIt means what I just said. I had Sal take me in the Studio Two van.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh... oh, right.)Vasquez:\nAt 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what were you doing during that time...?\nVasquez:\nDon't hit your desk. It irritates me.\nEdgeworth:\nYeah! Mr. Wright...! Oops.\nVasquez:\n... It was a 15 minute break...Vasquez:\nSal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have someone who can verify this?\nVasquez:\nSal.\nPhoenix:\nN-no... I mean someone else?\nVasquez:\nOne person is enough.\nPhoenix:\n(If she committed murder during that break... She wouldn't have had time to eat a t-bone steak! If I had some evidence that proved she didn't eat that steak...)Present Steak Plate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hah! As I thought!\"Maya:\nWell, Nick? Find anything?Phoenix:\nI kind of wish she'd said a little more...Maya:\nIt's hard. I think she's pretty used to being the boss. But I'm sure you'll find some contradiction in what she said... somewhere!Phoenix:\nHah! As I thought!Vasquez:\n...Phoenix:\nYou claim you ate a t-bone steak! But I say you did not!Judge:\nW-what's this, now, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nLook at this.Judge:\nIt's... a plate?Phoenix:\nThis plate was on the table in the employee room. As you can see, a large bone has been left behind.Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright. Need I remind you it was a T-BONE steak!? ([steak] is all-caps in the original release)Phoenix:\nExactly my point! Remember if you will... Ms. Vasquez and Mr. Manella ate at a table outside the trailer. Yet there were no bones left on the plates! The plates were bare!Vasquez:\n!Phoenix:\nMs. Vasquez? Tell me, how can a person eat a t-bone steak... and not leave the bone? I think I know how!You ate the bone, too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou ate the bone, too!\nMaya:\nUm, Nick... are you sure? I mean, I love steak, but even I don't eat the bone!\nPhoenix:\nHey, I don't eat it either!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! I, too, leave the bone.\nPhoenix:\nUm, can I try that again?\nLeads back to:\n\"I think I know how!\"You ate a boneless steak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nElementary! You were eating a boneless steak!\nJudge:\n... Mr. Wright, say you are right... What would that prove?\nPhoenix:\n... Um, right, Your Honor.\nMaya:\nNick! Remember her testimony? She said she ate a \"t-bone steak\"! She said \"bone\"!\nPhoenix:\nCorrect! I was... testing you!\nMaya:\nYeah, sure, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nSorry... Can I try that one more time?\nJudge:\n...\nLeads back to:\n\"I think I know how!\"You didn't eat the steak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You didn't eat any steak during that break!\"Phoenix:\nYou didn't eat any steak during that break! You took your steak and threw it somewhere... like that incinerator!Vasquez:\n! ...Judge:\nI... I see! Then what was Ms. Vasquez doing during her break?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious, Your Honor?Meeting the Steel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!\"Picking on Sal Manella\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nShe was picking on Mr. Manella!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... Sometimes this court finds it hard to tell whether you are joking or being serious.\nPhoenix:\nOh...?\nJudge:\nI would prefer it if you remained serious!\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor. I'll do my best.\nLeads to:\n\"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!\"Phoenix:\nShe was meeting with the Steel Samurai!Judge:\nOrder! A-are you saying...!?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor! As Ms. Vasquez left the trailer to eat her steak... She ran into the Steel Samurai! And then you did it. You killed him with your own hands!Vasquez:\n!!!Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright! I-isn't that a little presumptuous!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!?Vasquez:\nLet him claim what he wants.... You say I did it?Phoenix:\nYes.Vasquez:\nFascinating! And here I was worrying that today would be as boring as all the rest. ... Very well. Let us have a battle of wits, you and I.Phoenix:\n(Any day, Vasquez!)Maya:\nGood luck, Nick!Vasquez:\nLet's see... What was that murder weapon again? Oh yes, the \"Samurai Spear.\"Phoenix:\nYes...?Vasquez:\nI am, as you can see, a woman of petite stature. How could I possibly use that heavy spear as a weapon?I think you could!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's not impossible!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, maybe it's not impossible, but--\nVasquez:\nSilence. I'm speaking.\nEdgeworth:\nMmmph!\nVasquez:\nThe victim was stabbed through the chest from the front, yes? I believe this would indicate that the victim was aware of the killer's presence. Now, the Steel Samurai costume is quite light and mobile. Compared to the victim, I am weaker and slower... I couldn't possibly win such a fight! Not to mention, there is proof I did not have the spear! The photograph of the Steel Samurai shows that the victim himself was holding it! Or do you mean to suggest that I could have wrested it away from him?\nEdgeworth:\nY-yeah! Take that, Wright! If you still think she did it, show us proof!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... er...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. Look at the data we have on that Samurai Spear in the Court Record. Isn't there something in there that gets to you...?\nPhoenix:\nSomething odd about the Samurai Spear...? ... Wait!\nJudge:\nSomething the matter, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor. I'd like to take back my previous claim.\nJudge:\nVery well, I won't hold you to your claim. But I'm afraid I will have to penalize you.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh...)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's this? You're taking back your claim?\nPhoenix:\nLet's backtrack for a moment. I want to consider whether the witness could have used the Samurai Spear or not!\nLeads to:\n\"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"You couldn't, could you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI think you would have a great deal of difficulty using that as a weapon. Pretty much anyone would.\nVasquez:\nHah. You see?\nPhoenix:\nYes...\nLeads to:\n\"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"I don't know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't know.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"don't know\"!? What kind of a lawyer are you!?\nVasquez:\nQuiet. I'm speaking.\nEdgeworth:\nM-m-mmph!\nVasquez:\nYou \"don't know\"!? What kind of a lawyer...\nPhoenix:\nI don't know whether you could have fought with the Samurai Spear...\nLeads to:\n\"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"Phoenix:\nHowever, that has no bearing on this case!Vasquez:\n... Meaning?Phoenix:\nThe Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon!Vasquez:\nWhat!?Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!? The spear was found lying next to the victim's body!Phoenix:\nI have proof, Your Honor. I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!Present Samurai Spear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I present my proof: the so-called \"murder weapon\"!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWrong, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything yet...?\nJudge:\nI know you well enough by now to know when you're going to present the wrong evidence.\nMaya:\nI can sense it too, with my Fey blood...\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, okay, so I picked the wrong evidence! Enough with all the sensing!) Right. Okay, here's the real evidence, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!\"Phoenix:\nI present my proof: the so-called \"murder weapon\"!Edgeworth:\nB-but, that IS the murder weapon!Phoenix:\nNot so fast. Remember that this spear broke during the morning action scene run-through? But, someone fixed the spear. It was the security lady! She fixed it with duct tape! Now tell me, how is it possible... for someone to stab a man who is wearing a thick costume with this!? Through the chest!Judge:\nO-order! Order!Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright! What are you driving at!? Think about what you're--Vasquez:\nSilence! I'm the one testifying here and I will be heard!Edgeworth:\nMmmph...!Vasquez:\nAre you quite sane? Are you even aware of what you're saying? If the Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon, then pray tell what was!? How was Hammer killed?Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?I can tell you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Would I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?\"I can't tell you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course I can't.\nJudge:\n\"O-of course\"!?\nEdgeworth:\nCan the antics, Wright!\nJudge:\nI have to agree, Mr. Wright. At least pretend that you think you might know!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. Note to self: think before speaking. Tough crowd...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?\"Phoenix:\nWould I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?Judge:\nI'm afraid your confidence can sometimes be unfounded, Mr. Wright... Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then.Present Five-Year-Old Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Look at this photo.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMaya:\nNick! Think about this some more!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Think?\nMaya:\nPlease! How could that possibly have been the murder weapon!?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. She has a point.)\nJudge:\nSomething the matter?\nPhoenix:\nN-no, Your Honor. Nothing!\nLeads back to:\n\"Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then.\"Phoenix:\nLook at this photo.Judge:\nW-what is this? Why, that's Jack Hammer standing at the top of the stairs! O-order! Order! If I cannot have order this trial will be suspended! Mr. Wright! What is this all about!?Phoenix:\nThis photograph is from five years ago. There was an unfortunate accident at Global Studios. This is a photo of that very accident. Not a word of this was leaked to the outside. It was a close-kept secret at the studios.Edgeworth:\nWhat does this have to do with the current case!?Phoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth... You still can't see it? See the fallen man in this photo? See how the fencepost pierced him through the chest?Edgeworth:\nWh... what!? Are you saying...!?Phoenix:\nYes. What happened five years ago... has happened again!Vasquez:\n!!!Judge:\nMr. Wright! Continue!Phoenix:\nIt's 2:30 PM on the day of the murder! Ms. Dee Vasquez meets Jack Hammer outside the Studio Two trailer! Then she did it! She pushed Mr. Hammer off the stairs onto the fence! Just like Mr. Hammer had himself done five years ago! Though whether she did it on purpose or by accident, I cannot say.Vasquez:\n...!Edgeworth:\nI-in other words... th-the victim, Mr. Hammer... He died in the same way that he caused another man to die... five years ago!Phoenix:\nPrecisely. Ironic, isn't it?Vasquez:\n... Hoh hoh. Very creative, Mr. Wright. I could use a man like you on my script writing staff.Phoenix:\nYou deny that what I say is true?Vasquez:\n... Mr. Wright. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Hammer died at the trailer as you say. Yet the body was found at Studio One, was it not? And in the Evil Magistrate's costume, no less. Are you then claiming that I carried the body to Studio One... And returned to the trailer all in the space of a 15 minute break? How could I have disposed of the body!?Phoenix:\n...Edgeworth:\nThe break in the meeting at the trailer lasted 15 minutes, from 2:30 to 2:45. Could Jack Hammer have been pushed off the stairs to his death... then carried to Studio One and placed inside his costume? There wasn't enough time!Judge:\nHmm... indeed. Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?She couldn't deal with it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n15 minutes is kind of a short amount of time...\nVasquez:\nYou see? Even I cannot do the impossible. Therefore, Mr. Wright. I didn't do it. Agreed?\nPhoenix:\nNot agreed!\nVasquez:\n?\nLeads to:\n\"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?\"I bet she could move it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou'd be surprised! I bet she could do it! When people think their life depends on it, they can do amazing things!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, this is not an episode of \"That's Incredible.\"\nEdgeworth:\nIf you claim she did everything in 15 minutes...\nPhoenix:\n(Let me guess: \"Show Me Proof!\")\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect! Show me proof!\nPhoenix:\n(How am I supposed to do that...?)\nEdgeworth:\nThen I won't have you making any unsubstantiated claims!\nPhoenix:\n(... Wait a second, how does he know what I'm thinking!?)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! I need only look at the cold sweat running down your face to know what you're thinking!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your claim?\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?\"She had another way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?\"Phoenix:\nWhat if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?Vasquez:\nFor instance?Phoenix:\nActually, for that matter, there was no need for her to do the deed in 15 minutes! And there was a way for you to carry that body.Vasquez:\n!!! I-interesting! Let's hear it then.Judge:\nMr. Wright? Please show us how she carried the body.Present Van\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Vasquez.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDee Vasquez used this to carry the body to Studio One!\nVasquez:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, how can you carry a dead body with that?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nPlease rethink your statement.\nLeads back to:\n\"Please show us how she carried the body.\"Phoenix:\nMs. Vasquez. You carried the body to Studio One. And you used the studio van to do it!Vasquez:\n!!!Phoenix:\nRecall your testimony...Vasquez:\nThere was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One. I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me. There was a van there, right? I had Sal drive me.Phoenix:\nYou used the van to carry the body to Studio One! Then, before everyone else got there, you put the body into the Magistrate costume!Vasquez:\n...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHold on, Wright! Don't forget, it was Sal Manella that drove the van! Are you suggesting that Mr. Manella was a conspirator?Of course he was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!\"Of course he wasn't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course he wasn't!\nEdgeworth:\nHah! So, without Mr. Manella noticing anything, she put the body in the van... Then managed to put the body into the costume...? Are you seriously suggesting that is possible!?\nPhoenix:\n... Of course I'm not serious.\nEdgeworth:\nHa... hah!?\nPhoenix:\nI was kidding. To, er, lighten up the proceedings.\nEdgeworth:\nLi..light... Lighten!? Y-you can't lighten up a murder!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. The court requests you refrain from making claims in jest.\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor.\nLeads to:\n\"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!\"Phoenix:\nOf course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator! The body had to be placed in the van, and put into the costume. There's no way Ms. Vasquez could have done that alone! Also, don't forget that they had to dispose of the Steel Samurai costume. They had to... because it was covered in Mr. Hammer's blood! They probably burned it in that small incinerator. Well, Ms. Vasquez! Shall I continue?Vasquez:\n... No need. You're smarter than you look, Mr. Wright. Hmph. I lose. You win. It... was fun.Phoenix:\n(I... win!?) ...Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\n......Phoenix:\nUmm... So... what happens next?Vasquez:\n?Phoenix:\nDon't \"?\" me! Don't you have anything to say!?Vasquez:\nWhat would you like me to say?Phoenix:\nHuh? \"I lost\"? Something like that!Vasquez:\nI just said that.Phoenix:\nW-wait, so you mean... Dee Vasquez! So, it was you? You killed Jack Hammer! ...Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\n......Vasquez:\nWho can say?Phoenix:\nHuh?Vasquez:\nAre you sure I did? Mr. Wright... We just engaged in a battle of wits. And the result of that battle? You proved the possibility that I murdered Hammer.Phoenix:\nR-right!Vasquez:\nBut... that is only a possibility. Proof is another thing altogether. You lack decisive proof, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nWha... wha... wha... wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT!?Judge:\nOrder! Mr. Edgeworth, your thoughts?Edgeworth:\nUmm... uhh... mmmph. O-of course, it's as the witness says! ... Certainly, it does seem very likely she did it... but, uh, there's no proof!Phoenix:\n(...! Edgeworth isn't sure!)Vasquez:\n... Well? I came here as a witness today. If you've no more questions, I'll be leaving.Phoenix:\n(Urk! What do I do now!?)You did it, Vasquez!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Vasquez! You did it!\nVasquez:\n... That wasn't a question.\nPhoenix:\n... Um, did you do it?\nVasquez:\nNo.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI'm not sure that question helped this court get any closer to a verdict.\nLeads back to:\n\"Urk! What do I do now!?\"Testify again, Vasquez!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... I'd like you to testify again!\nJudge:\nTestify... again?\nVasquez:\nKnow when to give up, Mr. Wright. Think about it. Even if I were to testify again, what's the point? I can only say what I said before. The truth, Mr. Wright. I've already said all there is to say. What would happen if I said it again?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nVasquez:\nYou'd ask the same questions, get the same answers. A waste of time.\nLeads to:\n\"Damn... damn!\"No further questions, Vasquez!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI was hoping I'd come up with a question while pounding on my desk. I didn't.\nJudge:\n... You have my sympathies.\nLeads to:\n\"Damn... damn!\"Phoenix:\n(Damn... damn! To come so far, only to fail...)Judge:\nAs it seems there are no further questions... I would like to end the cross-examination of the witness, Ms. Vasquez.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nYes, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI was hoping I'd come up with a question while I was objecting, Your Honor... I didn't.Judge:\nI see... Very well.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor! I request that the witness testify again!Vasquez:\nYou are the prosecutor, are you not? Why are you badgering me? I'm your witness!Edgeworth:\nI... I just want to hear your testimony again.Vasquez:\nDoes this make any sense to you, Your Honor? I don't see that we have anything to gain by repeating the last several minutes.Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth... I, too, see little point in making Ms. Vasquez repeat herself. What exactly did you want her to testify about?Edgeworth:\nMmmph! Well, yes, um... ... Indeed! Verily, I say... Ergo! I want to hear about what happened... after they found the body!Judge:\nAfter they found the body...? Very well. The witness will testify to the court concerning this matter.Vasquez:\nHmph.Maya:\nNick! Why did Edgeworth...?Phoenix:\nWho knows? He probably realized she did it, too.Maya:\nBut... but! Wasn't he the one that said he always gets a guilty verdict...? After all that...Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- After Finding the Body --Vasquez:\nI was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body.\nThe assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent.\nI immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up.\nThe security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying \"he did it!\"\nI asked to be left out of the proceedings.\nI went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes.\nThen I went home.Judge:\nHmm... I see no issues raised by this testimony... Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Maya:\nOkay, Nick, we're close, real close! She may be acting tough now... But if you put her on the spot she's sure to falter! Find the key you need and twist the truth out of her, Nick!Phoenix:\nRight!Cross Examination",

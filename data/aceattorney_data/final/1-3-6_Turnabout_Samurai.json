I hope both the prosecution and the defense will be able to present decisive evidence. Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening statement.Edgeworth:\nIn yesterday's session, the defense presented us with a new theory for this case. He claims that the scene of the crime was, in fact, Studio Two. Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear.Judge:\nHmm... very well!Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)Judge:\nYou may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand. Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer who was present in the Studio Two trailer that day.Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state her name and occupation?Vasquez:\n... Dee Vasquez. I am a producer for Global Studios.Edgeworth:\nOn the day of the murder, you were in the trailer in Studio Two...Vasquez:\nAs everyone here knows, yes?Edgeworth:\n...?Vasquez:\nI dislike needless banter. If you must pontificate, do it when I'm not here.Edgeworth:\nMrrph!Judge:\nV-very well, Ms. Vasquez. Please give the court your testimony concerning the day of the murder.Maya:\nNick! I know she did it! Make her pay!Phoenix:\nR-right! (If she's guilty, I'll catch her with her pants down... So to speak.)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Vasquez:\nI entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.\nThe meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00.\nThere was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One...\nI was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.\nAt 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.\nSal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.\nWe found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One.\nThat's all.Judge:\nHmm... I have a question about one part of your testimony. You were \"fatigued\" so you had Sal \"take\" you...?Vasquez:\nThe van.Judge:\nHmm?Vasquez:\nThere's a van at Studio Two. I had him take me in that. I thought it might be risky to walk, what with that monkey's head toppling over.Van added to the Court Record.Judge:\nI... I see! Very well.

I mean, I love steak, but even I don't eat the bone!\nPhoenix:\nHey, I don't eat it either!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!

I'll do my best.\nLeads to:\n\"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!\"Phoenix:\nShe was meeting with the Steel Samurai!Judge:\nOrder! A-are you saying...!?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor! As Ms. Vasquez left the trailer to eat her steak... She ran into the Steel Samurai! And then you did it. You killed him with your own hands!Vasquez:\n!!!Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright! I-isn't that a little presumptuous!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!?Vasquez:\nLet him claim what he wants.... You say I did it?Phoenix:\nYes.Vasquez:\nFascinating! And here I was worrying that today would be as boring as all the rest. ... Very well. Let us have a battle of wits, you and I.Phoenix:\n(Any day, Vasquez!)Maya:\nGood luck, Nick!Vasquez:\nLet's see... What was that murder weapon again? Oh yes, the \"Samurai Spear.\"Phoenix:\nYes...?Vasquez:\nI am, as you can see, a woman of petite stature. How could I possibly use that heavy spear as a weapon?I think you could!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's not impossible!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, maybe it's not impossible, but--\nVasquez:\nSilence. I'm speaking.\nEdgeworth:\nMmmph!\nVasquez:\nThe victim was stabbed through the chest from the front, yes? I believe this would indicate that the victim was aware of the killer's presence. Now, the Steel Samurai costume is quite light and mobile. Compared to the victim, I am weaker and slower... I couldn't possibly win such a fight! Not to mention, there is proof I did not have the spear! The photograph of the Steel Samurai shows that the victim himself was holding it! Or do you mean to suggest that I could have wrested it away from him?\nEdgeworth:\nY-yeah! Take that, Wright! If you still think she did it, show us proof!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... er...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. Look at the data we have on that Samurai Spear in the Court Record. Isn't there something in there that gets to you...?\nPhoenix:\nSomething odd about the Samurai Spear...? ... Wait!\nJudge:\nSomething the matter, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor. I'd like to take back my previous claim.\nJudge:\nVery well, I won't hold you to your claim. But I'm afraid I will have to penalize you.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh...)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's this? You're taking back your claim?\nPhoenix:\nLet's backtrack for a moment. I want to consider whether the witness could have used the Samurai Spear or not!\nLeads to:\n\"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"You couldn't, could you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI think you would have a great deal of difficulty using that as a weapon. Pretty much anyone would.\nVasquez:\nHah. You see?\nPhoenix:\nYes...\nLeads to:\n\"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"I don't know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't know.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"don't know\"!?

What kind of a lawyer...\nPhoenix:\nI don't know whether you could have fought with the Samurai Spear...\nLeads to:\n\"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"Phoenix:\nHowever, that has no bearing on this case!Vasquez:\n... Meaning?Phoenix:\nThe Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon!Vasquez:\nWhat!?Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!? The spear was found lying next to the victim's body!Phoenix:\nI have proof, Your Honor. I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!Present Samurai Spear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I present my proof: the so-called \"murder weapon\"!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWrong, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything yet...?\nJudge:\nI know you well enough by now to know when you're going to present the wrong evidence.\nMaya:\nI can sense it too, with my Fey blood...\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, okay, so I picked the wrong evidence! Enough with all the sensing!) Right. Okay, here's the real evidence, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!\"Phoenix:\nI present my proof: the so-called \"murder weapon\"!Edgeworth:\nB-but, that IS the murder weapon!Phoenix:\nNot so fast. Remember that this spear broke during the morning action scene run-through? But, someone fixed the spear. It was the security lady! She fixed it with duct tape! Now tell me, how is it possible... for someone to stab a man who is wearing a thick costume with this!? Through the chest!Judge:\nO-order! Order!Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright! What are you driving at!? Think about what you're--Vasquez:\nSilence! I'm the one testifying here and I will be heard!Edgeworth:\nMmmph...!Vasquez:\nAre you quite sane? Are you even aware of what you're saying? If the Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon, then pray tell what was!? How was Hammer killed?Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?I can tell you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Would I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?\"I can't tell you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course I can't.\nJudge:\n\"O-of course\"!?\nEdgeworth:\nCan the antics, Wright!\nJudge:\nI have to agree, Mr. Wright. At least pretend that you think you might know!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. Note to self: think before speaking. Tough crowd...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?\"Phoenix:\nWould I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?Judge:\nI'm afraid your confidence can sometimes be unfounded, Mr. Wright...

Think about this some more!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Think?\nMaya:\nPlease! How could that possibly have been the murder weapon!?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. She has a point.)\nJudge:\nSomething the matter?\nPhoenix:\nN-no, Your Honor. Nothing!\nLeads back to:\n\"Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then.\"Phoenix:\nLook at this photo.Judge:\nW-what is this? Why, that's Jack Hammer standing at the top of the stairs! O-order! Order! If I cannot have order this trial will be suspended! Mr. Wright! What is this all about!?Phoenix:\nThis photograph is from five years ago. There was an unfortunate accident at Global Studios. This is a photo of that very accident. Not a word of this was leaked to the outside. It was a close-kept secret at the studios.Edgeworth:\nWhat does this have to do with the current case!?Phoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth... You still can't see it? See the fallen man in this photo? See how the fencepost pierced him through the chest?Edgeworth:\nWh... what!? Are you saying...!?Phoenix:\nYes. What happened five years ago... has happened again!Vasquez:\n!!!Judge:\nMr. Wright! Continue!Phoenix:\nIt's 2:30 PM on the day of the murder! Ms. Dee Vasquez meets Jack Hammer outside the Studio Two trailer! Then she did it! She pushed Mr. Hammer off the stairs onto the fence! Just like Mr. Hammer had himself done five years ago! Though whether she did it on purpose or by accident, I cannot say.Vasquez:\n...!Edgeworth:\nI-in other words... th-the victim, Mr. Hammer... He died in the same way that he caused another man to die... five years ago!Phoenix:\nPrecisely. Ironic, isn't it?Vasquez:\n... Hoh hoh. Very creative, Mr. Wright. I could use a man like you on my script writing staff.Phoenix:\nYou deny that what I say is true?Vasquez:\n... Mr. Wright. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Hammer died at the trailer as you say. Yet the body was found at Studio One, was it not? And in the Evil Magistrate's costume, no less. Are you then claiming that I carried the body to Studio One... And returned to the trailer all in the space of a 15 minute break? How could I have disposed of the body!?Phoenix:\n...Edgeworth:\nThe break in the meeting at the trailer lasted 15 minutes, from 2:30 to 2:45. Could Jack Hammer have been pushed off the stairs to his death... then carried to Studio One and placed inside his costume? There wasn't enough time!Judge:\nHmm... indeed. Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?She couldn't deal with it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n15 minutes is kind of a short amount of time...\nVasquez:\nYou see? Even I cannot do the impossible. Therefore, Mr. Wright. I didn't do it. Agreed?\nPhoenix:\nNot agreed!\nVasquez:\n?\nLeads to:\n\"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?\"I bet she could move it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou'd be surprised! I bet she could do it! When people think their life depends on it, they can do amazing things!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, this is not an episode of \"That's Incredible.\"\nEdgeworth:\nIf you claim she did everything in 15 minutes...\nPhoenix:\n(Let me guess: \"Show Me Proof!\")\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect! Show me proof!\nPhoenix:\n(How am I supposed to do that...?)\nEdgeworth:\nThen I won't have you making any unsubstantiated claims!\nPhoenix:\n(... Wait a second, how does he know what I'm thinking!?)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! I need only look at the cold sweat running down your face to know what you're thinking!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your claim?\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?\"She had another way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?\"Phoenix:\nWhat if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?Vasquez:\nFor instance?Phoenix:\nActually, for that matter, there was no need for her to do the deed in 15 minutes! And there was a way for you to carry that body.Vasquez:\n!!! I-interesting! Let's hear it then.Judge:\nMr. Wright? Please show us how she carried the body.Present Van\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Vasquez.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDee Vasquez used this to carry the body to Studio One!\nVasquez:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, how can you carry a dead body with that?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nPlease rethink your statement.\nLeads back to:\n\"Please show us how she carried the body.\"Phoenix:\nMs. Vasquez. You carried the body to Studio One. And you used the studio van to do it!Vasquez:\n!!!Phoenix:\nRecall your testimony...Vasquez:\nThere was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One. I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me. There was a van there, right? I had Sal drive me.Phoenix:\nYou used the van to carry the body to Studio One! Then, before everyone else got there, you put the body into the Magistrate costume!Vasquez:\n...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHold on, Wright! Don't forget, it was Sal Manella that drove the van! Are you suggesting that Mr. Manella was a conspirator?Of course he was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!\"Of course he wasn't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course he wasn't!\nEdgeworth:\nHah! So, without Mr. Manella noticing anything, she put the body in the van... Then managed to put the body into the costume...? Are you seriously suggesting that is possible!?\nPhoenix:\n... Of course I'm not serious.\nEdgeworth:\nHa... hah!?\nPhoenix:\nI was kidding. To, er, lighten up the proceedings.\nEdgeworth:\nLi..light... Lighten!? Y-you can't lighten up a murder!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. The court requests you refrain from making claims in jest.\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor.\nLeads to:\n\"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!\"Phoenix:\nOf course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator! The body had to be placed in the van, and put into the costume. There's no way Ms. Vasquez could have done that alone! Also, don't forget that they had to dispose of the Steel Samurai costume. They had to... because it was covered in Mr. Hammer's blood! They probably burned it in that small incinerator. Well, Ms. Vasquez! Shall I continue?Vasquez:\n... No need. You're smarter than you look, Mr. Wright. Hmph. I lose. You win. It... was fun.Phoenix:\n(I... win!?) ...Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\n......Phoenix:\nUmm... So... what happens next?Vasquez:\n?Phoenix:\nDon't \"?\" me! Don't you have anything to say!?Vasquez:\nWhat would you like me to say?Phoenix:\nHuh? \"I lost\"? Something like that!Vasquez:\nI just said that.Phoenix:\nW-wait, so you mean... Dee Vasquez! So, it was you? You killed Jack Hammer! ...Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\n......Vasquez:\nWho can say?Phoenix:\nHuh?Vasquez:\nAre you sure I did? Mr. Wright... We just engaged in a battle of wits. And the result of that battle? You proved the possibility that I murdered Hammer.Phoenix:\nR-right!Vasquez:\nBut... that is only a possibility. Proof is another thing altogether. You lack decisive proof, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nWha... wha... wha... wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT!?Judge:\nOrder! Mr. Edgeworth, your thoughts?Edgeworth:\nUmm... uhh... mmmph. O-of course, it's as the witness says! ... Certainly, it does seem very likely she did it... but, uh, there's no proof!Phoenix:\n(...! Edgeworth isn't sure!)Vasquez:\n... Well? I came here as a witness today. If you've no more questions, I'll be leaving.Phoenix:\n(Urk! What do I do now!?)You did it, Vasquez!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Vasquez! You did it!\nVasquez:\n... That wasn't a question.\nPhoenix:\n... Um, did you do it?\nVasquez:\nNo.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI'm not sure that question helped this court get any closer to a verdict.\nLeads back to:\n\"Urk! What do I do now!?\"Testify again, Vasquez!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... I'd like you to testify again!\nJudge:\nTestify... again?\nVasquez:\nKnow when to give up, Mr. Wright. Think about it. Even if I were to testify again, what's the point? I can only say what I said before. The truth, Mr. Wright. I've already said all there is to say. What would happen if I said it again?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nVasquez:\nYou'd ask the same questions, get the same answers. A waste of time.\nLeads to:\n\"Damn... damn!\"No further questions, Vasquez!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI was hoping I'd come up with a question while pounding on my desk. I didn't.\nJudge:\n... You have my sympathies.\nLeads to:\n\"Damn... damn!\"Phoenix:\n(Damn... damn! To come so far, only to fail...)Judge:\nAs it seems there are no further questions... I would like to end the cross-examination of the witness, Ms. Vasquez.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nYes, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI was hoping I'd come up with a question while I was objecting, Your Honor... I didn't.Judge:\nI see... Very well.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor! I request that the witness testify again!Vasquez:\nYou are the prosecutor, are you not? Why are you badgering me? I'm your witness!Edgeworth:\nI... I just want to hear your testimony again.Vasquez:\nDoes this make any sense to you, Your Honor? I don't see that we have anything to gain by repeating the last several minutes.Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth... I, too, see little point in making Ms. Vasquez repeat herself. What exactly did you want her to testify about?Edgeworth:\nMmmph! Well, yes, um... ... Indeed! Verily, I say... Ergo! I want to hear about what happened... after they found the body!Judge:\nAfter they found the body...? Very well. The witness will testify to the court concerning this matter.Vasquez:\nHmph.Maya:\nNick! Why did Edgeworth...?Phoenix:\nWho knows? He probably realized she did it, too.Maya:\nBut... but! Wasn't he the one that said he always gets a guilty verdict...? After all that...Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- After Finding the Body --Vasquez:\nI was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body.\nThe assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent.\nI immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up.\nThe security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying \"he did it!\"\nI asked to be left out of the proceedings.\nI went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes.\nThen I went home.Judge:\nHmm... I see no issues raised by this testimony... Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Maya:\nOkay, Nick, we're close, real close! She may be acting tough now... But if you put her on the spot she's sure to falter! Find the key you need and twist the truth out of her, Nick!Phoenix:\nRight!Cross Examination",

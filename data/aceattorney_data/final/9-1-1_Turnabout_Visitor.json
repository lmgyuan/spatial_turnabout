What other choice do I have? That's the job of a prosecutor, after all.\nTh-That may be true, but why...? Why go this far?\nSorry, maybe I wasn't clear enough, but a guilty verdict is all that matters to me. No matter what the cost. I'm a prodigy among prosecutors. Always have been, always will be.\nMarch 14, 2:05 AM\nProsecutor's Building - 12th Floor Hallway\nEdgeworth:\n(It's hard to believe that I've been away from my office for a whole month. I hope Detective Gumshoe has been keeping an eye on my office. And keeping it clean. Hm...? The door is unlocked...)\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe...? (Hm? What's this smell...? It's very familiar... Blood? Wh-What the!?) What's the meaning of this!?\n???:\nFreeze.\nEdgeworth:\nIdentify yourself.\n???:\n.................. Shut up.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. You've got some nerve, committing murder in a prosecutor's office. Is that a threat?\n???:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...Let me make one thing very clear.\n???:\nWhat?\nEdgeworth:\nNo one gets away with committing murder in my office. No one.\n???:\n............\nEdgeworth:\nMy name is Miles Edgeworth. And I work as a prosecutor in my local district. Little did I know that upon my return home after a month abroad... ...I would be thrusted into a multitude of cases, and some very frantic and busy days.\nMarch 14, 2:56 AM\nHigh Prosecutors' Offices - Room 1202\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nForensics:\nI've finished photographing the victim's body, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nVery well. Please continue your investigation.\nForensics:\nYes, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n.........\n???:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Mr. Edgeworth, sir!! Are you OK, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nKeep it down, Detective. This is a crime scene.\n???:\nWhen I heard that a murder had taken place in your office, I ran up here straight away!\nEdgeworth:\n(This is Dick Gumshoe. He is a detective with the local precinct... ...and the one they assigned to handle this murder case for the time being.)\nGumshoe:\nYou're looking a little pale, sir! Are you hurt!?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, I'm perfectly fine. However...\nGumshoe:\nAck! Look what they did to your office! It's totally trashed!\nEdgeworth:\nI'll say. The culprit sullied my floor with dirt rather well. No one gets away with tracking mud into my office.\nGumshoe:\nWhoa! Sounds like you're getting really burned up over this whole thing!\nEdgeworth:\nThis crime was committed in my office, so it is my responsibility to solve it.\nGumshoe:\nHo ho! That's just like you, Mr. Edgeworth! OK! Time to do some investigating!\nEdgeworth:\nAgreed. Our first course of action is to gather relevant facts and leads. (We must not overlook anything, no matter how small, if we are to find the truth. So I'll keep any leads or information we find etched in the forefront of my mind.) Speaking of things that pique my curiosity... Why of all places did the murder occur in my office (Crime scene: My office – Is it really coincidence that the murder took place in my office?)? (Hmm... I get the nagging feeling that this is something important to keep in mind.)\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I was wondering that myself, sir... I mean, you can't really say it's just a coincidence, can you?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, not really. Especially because of this.\nGumshoe:\nThe key to your office (The office key – For security reasons, this office's door has a lock built into it.)? What do you mean, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nIf you think about it carefully and use Logic, it should become clear to you.\nGumshoe:\nLogic...?\nEdgeworth:\nBy finding the connection between two pieces of information... ...and connecting them, new information is born. That is the end result of using Logic.\nGumshoe:\nSo how do you use it?\nEdgeworth:\nFirst, I recall the information we've gathered with [L / LB / L1 / Q], and then I Connect them together with [X / Y / triangle / T] (changed from [information through the Logic Button, and then Connect them together] in the original release). (Now, to use [L / LB / L1 / Q] (changed from [touch the Logic Button] in the original release) and recall the facts.)\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Crime scene: My office\" and \"The office key\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"For security reasons, all the prosecutors' doors are outfitted with locks.\"\nEdgeworth:\nFor security reasons, all prosecutors' doors are outfitted with locks. Which means it would have been hard for the murderer and the victim to get in here. Ergo, it's impossible to dismiss the location of this crime as mere coincidence.\nGumshoe:\nYes, that's exactly what I was thinking, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(There must be a reason why someone infiltrated my room... What was the killer after? (The killer's goal – Why did this happen in my office? What was the killer after?))\nGumshoe:\nYou're really on the ball today, Mr. Edgeworth! That's some beautiful Logic, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, well... When you follow leads to their conclusion, only the truth remains. (However... If the information doesn't line up properly, I may stray far from the truth as well... But if I think carefully before piecing leads together, the Logic should flow.) Well, let's get started with our investigation, shall we?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nBegin Investigation\nHigh Prosecutors' Offices - Room 1202\nGumshoe:\nThe basis of any good investigation is to examine everything, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nI know that. And when I want to examine something, I simply use [A / X / space] when I'm next to it (changed from [touch the Examine Button] in the original release).\nGumshoe:\nOh, if you ever feel lost and want to talk, just use [X / Y / triangle / T] (changed from [touch the Partner Button] in the original release), OK!? I'll give you great, precise advice as an Ace Investigator, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(*sigh* Something to try later if I have free time, I suppose.)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForensics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHow is it coming along?\nForensics:\nPlease, I need absolute silence. Fingerprint lifting is a delicate art!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Well, I never!)\n\n\n\n\nOfficer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have anything to report?\nOfficer:\nSir, yes, sir! Nothing out of the ordinary right now, sir! And yet, there's something out of the ordinary right in front of my eyes.\nGumshoe:\nTalk about a contradiction!\nEdgeworth:\n(Something out of the ordinary, huh... I should look around a bit more.)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBouquet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Is this... yet another batch of fresh flowers...?\nGumshoe:\nThe ones that come with a card attached every month like clockwork for you? Yup. Speaking of that! Let's see what's on the card this month, sir!\"All will be resolved.--Wendy\"\nEdgeworth:\n(Oh, Ms. Irony... How painful are thy thorns.)\nGumshoe:\nWendy... Isn't that the name of that old lady with the whiny voice that's stalk--\nEdgeworth:\nThat's enough, Detective. You need not remind me further. *shudder*\n\n\n\n\nSteel Samurai doll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, it's a good thing my Steel Samurai doll was spared any harm.\nGumshoe:\nSpeaking of which, I still haven't actually sat down and watched any of that show. What's it about again?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I don't know much about it myself, but... ...the hero of \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo\" is the Steel Samurai... ...and his goal is to defeat the Evil Magistrate. It's a show geared towards kids... ...however its high production values and riveting plot draws in a number of adults as well. Spin-offs like \"Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo\" and \"The Nickel Samurai\"... ...along with the deluge of merchandise, and even a new stage show, gives it presence.\nGumshoe:\nYou... sure know a lot. Are you sure you're not some sort of rabid fanboy?\nEdgeworth:\n...! O-Of course not! Anyone that keeps up with society know at least this much! And that conversation lasted longer than expected. Let us return to the investigation!\n\n\n\n\nKing of Prosecutors shield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh, it's your trophy! The um... Knight of Prosecutors, right!?\nEdgeworth:\n...King. King of Prosecutors. And it's not a trophy; it's a shield.\nGumshoe:\nThey only send this to the winning prosecutor, right!?\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, but I have no real interest in the perceived worth of other people. As for my own worth, that is something only I can determine for myself.\nGumshoe:\nTh-That's so slick, sir! I'm gonna have to try saying that sometime!\nEdgeworth:\n(Unfortunately for him, his monetary worth is tied directly to his worth to me.)\n\n\n\n\nBroken tea set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nAh! Watch out for the tea cup fragments there, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n.........Nnngh... That killer is going to pay! This tea set...!\nGumshoe:\nYikes! You're really mad over this!\nEdgeworth:\nThis tea set is very dear to my heart and can only be bought in England. It cost more than your whole month's paycheck.\nGumshoe:\nWh...Whaaaaaaaat!? Now I feel like the killer's wasted one of my monthly paychecks!\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's been a while since I've sat at this desk. Oh, how I've missed you. ...Hm? It's so tidy that it looks newer than when I first bought it.\nGumshoe:\nHo ho, yeah! That thing's so polished that it makes mirrors jealous!\nEdgeworth:\nDon't tell me you had no other work the entire time I was away, Detective...\nGumshoe:\nMy job is to protect your office, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n...And you did such a good job protecting it that a murder occurred in it.\nGumshoe:\n............ That's harsh, sir...\nEdgeworth:\n(I have to admit the desk has never looked better, so I guess I can't dock his pay.)\n\n\n\n\nSofa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI hope we can solve this case quickly. I'd like to return to relaxing on this sofa.\nGumshoe:\nThat thing looks a billion times softer than my mattress at home! C-Can I sit on it, too? Just for a little while, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. You know I can't allow that. Until this case is solved, neither of us has time to spare, let alone rest.\nGumshoe:\n...! You're right, sir! I'm gonna work hard and be a real trooper to the end!\nEdgeworth:\n(Even once this case is over, I don't think he can afford to take any time off...)\n\n\n\n\nRevolver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat have we here...? (Could this perhaps be the murder weapon? If so, it would mean that the killer made their escape after disposing of their gun here.)\nGumshoe:\nI think I've seen one of these before... Hmm...\nEdgeworth:\nCare to enlighten me as to where?\nGumshoe:\nOh! I know! I was issued the exact same model! .........I think.\nEdgeworth:\n*sigh* Detective...\nGumshoe:\nI don't really like guns all that much. I mean, they're really dangerous! But now that I think about it, you do see this model around the precinct a lot, sir. I don't use mine much, except in emergencies, so that's why I didn't recognize it...\nEdgeworth:\n(So it's the same type of revolver (Revolver - Found at the crime scene, it's the same model as those used by precinct detectives.) as the ones used by this precinct's detectives...)\n\n\n\nAfter Logic \"Victim was a detective\" is added\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm, I seem to have gathered a few pieces of pertinent information. Now to calmly use some Logic and figure out if any of them are connected to each other.)\n\n\n\n\n\nRevolver (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo the detectives of this precinct all use this same model of revolver?\nGumshoe:\nI guess. I don't really like guns, but at least I do know the different types out there!\nEdgeworth:\n(At least he knows SOMETHING related to his job.)\n\n\n\n\nFiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nYour files are all over the floor, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nThey probably fell during the struggle between the victim and his killer (Signs of a struggle - My files are a mess, pointing to a struggle between the victim and the killer.).\nGumshoe:\nAww, and I tried so hard to keep this place spotless while you were away... I mean, this just rendered all the time and effort I put in pointless!\nEdgeworth:\nI don't recall ever asking you to clean my room!\nGumshoe:\nWell, I watered the flowers every day, just like you requested, sir. I just added cleaning to the list as a weekend special! For about half a day every Saturday, I'd come in and clean this place until it sparkled!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does he have a life...?)\n\n\n\n\nChessboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOuch, they even knocked over your chess set! I had it all set up, ready for when you got back. I figured we could play a few games.\nEdgeworth:\nI had no idea you were interested in chess.\nGumshoe:\nI'm actually pretty good at checkers, so I thought I'd give chess a try.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... In that case, I suppose I can set some time aside after we solve this case. (Though I don't expect the games to tax my mental acuity much.)\n\n\n\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(They finished photographing the body, so it should be alright to examine this area. I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nFiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nYour files are all over the floor, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nThey probably fell during the struggle between the victim and his killer (Signs of a struggle - My files are a mess, pointing to a struggle between the victim and the killer.).\nGumshoe:\nAww, and I tried so hard to keep this place spotless while you were away... I mean, this just rendered all the time and effort I put in pointless!\nEdgeworth:\nI don't recall ever asking you to clean my room!\nGumshoe:\nWell, I watered the flowers every day, just like you requested, sir. I just added cleaning to the list as a weekend special! For about half a day every Saturday, I'd come in and clean this place until it sparkled!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does he have a life...?)\n\n\n\n\nShelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI don't believe it! I packed those files on these shelves so tight... ...that not even an earthquake could make them fall off, but just look at them! At this rate, the rest of the files won't be able to withstand an earthquake at all!\nEdgeworth:\n...A-A problem to be sure. Well, once the investigation is over, we'll put them back up on the shelf.\n\n\n\n\nWallet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do we have here...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, I think I've seen one of these before...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a police badge, Detective...\nGumshoe:\nOh, hey! I have the exact same thing, actually! What a coinkidink!\nEdgeworth:\n......... Let's take a look inside. Mr. Buddy Faith... It would appear that our victim was a detective (Victim was a detective - According to his badge and ID, Buddy Faith was a precinct detective.), just like you.\n\n\n\nAfter Logic \"Revolver\" is added\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm, I seem to have gathered a few pieces of pertinent information. Now to calmly use some Logic and figure out if any of them are connected to each other.)\n\n\n\n\n\nWallet (after Victim's Revolver is added to Organizer)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim's badge. It probably fell out of his pocket during the struggle.\nGumshoe:\nWell, I always take extra care to make sure mine doesn't fall out of my pockets, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nOh...?\nGumshoe:\nI always have it down at the bottom of one of my super-deep pockets! Without fail!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is it possible... that he has never taken his tattered coat to the cleaners!?)\n\n\n\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the holster is revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLet's see here...\n\n\n\n\nAfter the holster is revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLet's give the body a once over.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, there's blood all over his lower abdominal area.\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the bullet passed clean through his stomach area, sir...\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, he was shot.\nGumshoe:\nYup. And until the autopsy's done, I don't think we'll know much more than that.\nEdgeworth:\nPlease have the body sent to the morgue once they're done processing the crime scene.\nCrime Scene Notes jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\nIf first evidence added to Organizer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nAre you going to be OK with keeping track of the evidence we find, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nOf course. This is the safest way I know to keep track of it all.\nGumshoe:\nAlright, if you say so!\nEdgeworth:\n(I keep all the evidence I find either in or with my Organizer. When I want to re-examine a piece, I have but to press [R / RB / R1 / E] to open my Organizer (changed from [touch the Organizer Button] in the original release). But the Organizer isn't only for evidence; I keep people's profiles on hand in it, too. It's probably a good idea to make a habit of checking the facts often.)\n\n\n\n\n\nBody (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the holster is revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLet's see here...\n\n\n\n\nAfter the holster is revealed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLet's give the body a once over.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, there's blood all over his lower abdominal area.\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the bullet passed clean through his stomach area, sir...\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, he was shot.\nGumshoe:\nYup. And until the autopsy's done, I don't think we'll know much more than that.\nEdgeworth:\nPlease have the body sent to the morgue once they're done processing the crime scene.\n\n\n\n\nHolster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Faith's holster... I bet he never thought he'd be killed by his own gun.\nGumshoe:\nYeah... Shot down by the very thing that's supposed to protect the people. I just can't get over that, sir! It's not right! We're gonna get the killer for this!\nEdgeworth:\n(Maybe it's because the victim is a fellow detective... ...but for a second, Gumshoe sounded even more detective-like than usual.)\n\n\n\n\nBloodstain on pants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's some blood on the back of his pants... Which reminds me of this one time... Back in elementary school, I accidentally flopped onto this chair that had a tack on it... And oh man, that thing stabbed me good! It even drew blood! Hurts just thinking about it.\nEdgeworth:\n(That story was so painful, I spaced out in the middle of it...)\n\n\n\n\n\nBody (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nBody (subsequent times, after examining body, wallet, and files)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront of badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.\n\n\n\n\nBack of badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nEach Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Victim was a detective\" and \"Revolver\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe revolver, the standard model used by detectives... Could it have belonged to our recently departed? Detective Gumshoe, could you please thoroughly check the victim's body one more time?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir! On it now, sir! 'Scuse me, pal... Let's see... What have we got here... Mr. Edgeworth, sir! This guy's wearing a gun holster!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, so it appears that our killer somehow managed to take the victim's gun from him.\nVictim's Revolver data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\nIf first evidence added to Organizer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nAre you going to be OK with keeping track of the evidence we find, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nOf course. This is the safest way I know to keep track of it all.\nGumshoe:\nAlright, if you say so!\nEdgeworth:\n(I keep all the evidence I find either in or with my Organizer. When I want to re-examine a piece, I have but to press [R / RB / R1 / E] to open my Organizer (changed from [touch the Organizer Button] in the original release). But the Organizer isn't only for evidence; I keep people's profiles on hand in it, too. It's probably a good idea to make a habit of checking the facts often.)\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Let's see what else we can find out about this revolver.)\nGumshoe:\nAs I always say, you've gotta look really carefully at each piece of evidence! You can use [R analog stick / RS / arrow keys] (changed from [the Scroll Wheels] in the original release) to rotate an object. There's no such thing as a bad angle! Use [L / LB / L1 / Q] and [R / RB / R1 / E] (changed from [the Slide Bar or the X and Y Arrows] in the original release) to zoom in and out to get at the nitty gritty!\n\n\n\nExamine Trigger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nTo think that it's so easy to take a life with just the pull of a trigger...\nGumshoe:\nYou know, I can't ever see myself really liking guns. Oh! But I love the ones they use at track and field meets to start races! If you take off before it's fired, everybody always ends up following your lead!\nEdgeworth:\n...To chase you down for a false start, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nNow that you mention it, even when I finish first, I always wind up in last place...\n\n\n\n\nExamine Barrel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like only one round was fired from this.)\nGumshoe:\nWow, so the killer killed the vic with just one shot after wrestling the gun from him? Sounds like the guy knew how to handle a gun, huh, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nWe have no proof for now, but that is a distinct possibility...\nLeads back to investigation\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nYou called, sir?\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice anything?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIs there anything you noticed that you'd like to share, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nJust that I rushed over here as soon as I heard there was a murder in your office, sir! The investigation's just gotten started, so I guess there's not much else to say. So, uh, were you the one that found the body, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately. Upon my return, I found my office door to be unlocked. And what awaited me inside was this whole messy affair.\nGumshoe:\nOuch, that's rough...\nEdgeworth:\nEven though I left the security of this room to a \"certain detective\"...\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry, sir...\n\n\n\n\nAbout investigating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI assume you understand how to conduct investigations, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nOf course, sir! Examine anything and everything with [A / X / space] (changed from [things by tapping them or by touching the Examine Button] in the original release)!\nBy checking various things out, we can gather all sorts of (changed from [gather] in the original release) evidence and information. You can see the evidence we've collected with [R / RB / R1 / E] (changed from [by touching the Organizer Button] in the original release). For information... information... um...\nEdgeworth:\nFor information and leads, it's [L / LB / L1 / Q] (changed from [the Logic Button] in the original release).\nGumshoe:\nThat's it! Great job, sir! Deductive reasonable is the way to go!\nEdgeworth:\n(It's called \"deductive reasoning\", Detective... Clearly, something you lack.)\n\n\n\n\nThe info I've gathered (after examining files, body, wallet, and revolver)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI seem to have picked up a few good leads.\nGumshoe:\nOh! So now you're gonna do that thing you do with all that information, right?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you babbling about?\nGumshoe:\nThe brainy thing you were talking about just a few minutes ago, sir! Um... Logic! You said that you can look at all of your leads and info by pressing [L / LB / L1 / Q] (changed from [touching the Logic Button] in the original release). Then you pick the ones that seem related with [A / X / space] and Connect them with [X / Y / triangle / T] (changed from [pick the pieces you want to connect by touching them and hitting Connect] in the original release). That's your way of investigating, right, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, which is why this exercise in explaining my own method to me was unnecessary.\nGumshoe:\nOK, then how about I explain MY Logic to you next!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat is even more unnecessary!\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nYour Prosecutor's Badge is really tiny compared to my police badge. Oh! But, um...... It's really cool, sir! Much, much cooler than my badge could ever be!\nEdgeworth:\n...There's no need to suck up to me, Detective.\nGumshoe:\n..................\n\n\n\n\nVictim's Revolver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe victim's gun, huh. It's the same model as mine.\nEdgeworth:\nA tool used to protect lives, yet one that can also take lives away. Those who take a gun in hand wield a great responsibility. I hope you understand that.\nGumshoe:\nI don't really use my gun at all, sir. The only time I would use this baby is... ...when I'm fighting a hot duel with a convict to look ultra cool!\nEdgeworth:\n*sigh* You were doing so well until that last bit.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI'm just a lowly detective, so... ...I'm not sure what I should do with that other than to arrest it!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is that the only talent you have...? Oh, wait...)\nAfter examining body, files, and barrel of gun:\nEdgeworth:\n(I guess this is about all we're going to find out. We should send the body to aut--)\n???:\nJim! Why, oh why!? How could this have happened to a guy like you!?\nEdgeworth:\n......... Are you alright?\n???:\nDon't touch me! Leave me alone! Just let me be!\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, but I can't do that. The investigation is still ongoing, so please refrain from touching the body.\n???:\nThe \"body\"? The \"BODY\"!? Don't talk about him like he's just some lump of flesh! Look at him... Jim looks like he's just turned in for the night.\nGumshoe:\nUm, sure. Just in a blood-stained suit, pal.\n???:\nWhere are my manners?\nEdgeworth:\nAren't you that prosecutor...\nPortsman:\nWhy, yes, I am! I'm Jacques Portsman, Prosecutor. Jim here was my partner in crime busting...\nEdgeworth:\nI'm Miles Edgeworth, and like you, I am also a prosecutor.\nGumshoe:\nDetective Dick Gumshoe, sir.\nPortsman:\nSo you're Miles Edgeworth... I guess this is your office...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, that is correct.\nPortsman:\nThen it was you! You're the one who killed Jim!\nGumshoe:\nHey, don't go around jumping to conclusions, pal! Just calm down, OK!?\nPortsman:\nI will not! I know how things work around here! High prosecutors' office doors all have locks built into them. And only the owner of the office has the key to his or her own office door!\nEdgeworth:\nThat is correct. However, I was not the one who killed your partner.\nGumshoe:\nYeah! Mr. Edgeworth has been overseas on a business trip this whole time, pal. And the key to the door was with me the entire time, OK!? So the only one who could get in here was me! Ho ho ho ho. ...Wait, that means... .........I'm not sure what that means.\nPortsman:\nSo it was you, then! You're Jim's killer!!\nGumshoe:\nNo way, pal! You've got it all wrong!!\nEdgeworth:\nEveryone calm down!\nPortsman:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Portsman, correct? If you are a real prosecutor, you should know to stay collected. The investigation has only just begun. Isn't it too early to be drawing conclusions?\nPortsman:\n...Alright, I get the point. You're right, my mistake. I tend to get a little too hot-headed sometimes. You sure are one cool customer, though, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nPortsman:\nI've heard all the rumors about you. You're the great \"Genius Prosecutor\". You're something of a legend, you know. Anyway! Let's call a truce and work together, OK? Now, how about a handshake to seal the deal!?\nEdgeworth:\n............ A pleasure to work with you.\nPortsman:\nYou guys were conducting your investigation, right? Sorry for barging in like that. Carry on, then. It's your room, after all.\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, I intend to.\nPortsman:\nI just want a little more time to say good-bye to Jim... You there!\nForensics:\nSir!\nPortsman:\nI want you to capture this scene on film for me. My final farewell to my partner Jim...\nEdgeworth:\n............ (I should probably give them some space...)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForensics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHow is it coming along?\nForensics:\nPlease, I need absolute silence. This picture is too important to mess up.\nEdgeworth:\n(I'll just leave the man to his art.)\n\n\n\n\nPortsman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Portsman. A word, if I may.\nPortsman:\nJim... I swear I'll find your killer and bring them to justice! You wait and see. It'll be for the both of us! Now then! You wanted to talk to me about something?\nEdgeworth:\n...Um, no. That's alright. (I feel like I'm interrupting their... conversation.)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacket in frame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ah! Your jacket, sir! What's it doing on the floor!?\"\nGumshoe:\nAh! Your jacket, sir! What's it doing on the floor!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt must have fallen off the wall when the killer tried to threaten me by firing a round.\nGumshoe:\nSo the killer not only shot the victim, but they shot your jacket as well!? They dared to shoot the ultra-special jacket that you made your prosecutorial debut in!? What if they had shot through it!? It would've been a disaster!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's not worth getting worked up over, Detective. Not when there's something more here.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Like what?\nEdgeworth:\nI take it you haven't noticed it yet, Detective. There is a giant contradiction right here in front of us.\nGumshoe:\nReally!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Did I say \"contradiction\"? He must be rubbing off on me. I'm starting to sound like him... But I have my own methods and I will conduct this investigation my way. When the scene before me contradicts a piece of evidence or seems off... ...that's when my deductive skills come into play. First, I have to find the spot that holds the contradiction.)\nMove cursor/reticle over bullet hole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is it. This bullet hole is where the contradiction lies!\"\nExamine area around bullet hole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nSo the killer not only shot the victim, but they shot your jacket as well!?\nEdgeworth:\nTo prove the gun was real, no doubt.\nGumshoe:\nAnd two shots! I'd have been afraid of someone hearing either one of them.\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the middle of the night, Detective. Further, my office walls are soundproof. The culprit must have been very confident that no one would hear.\nExamine sofa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLooks like your sofa was spared! Talk about good luck!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd just what is so lucky about that?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I'd hate for my napping spot to have a huge hole in it.\nEdgeworth:\n...Napping spot?\nGumshoe:\nJ-J-Just joking, sir! Honest! I wouldn't dream of sleeping on such a nice, comfy sofa...\nEdgeworth:\n(He just keeps digging himself deeper and deeper with each passing word...)\nExamine jacket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis jacket sure brings back memories! I remember you used to wear this around the time you became a certified prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nIt was a present from my mentor.\nGumshoe:\nProsecutor Manfred von Karma, huh...\nEdgeworth:\nYes... I don't wear it anymore, yet I can't bring myself to throw it away...\nGumshoe:\nIt must mean a lot to you... Even with the little bittersweet memories it holds... Ah, but you know, I've got an old coat of mine hanging up in my room too, sir! ...Yesterday was laundry day, so it's just drying off, but you get the picture.\nEdgeworth:\n(This is it. This bullet hole is where the contradiction lies! When I spot something that's off, I should point my cursor at it and press [X / Y / triangle / T] (changed from [touch the Deduce Button] in the original release) with conviction!)\nDeduce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"And when I have found sufficient proof to prove the contradiction, I Present it!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(And when I have found sufficient proof to prove the contradiction, I Present it! This is how I do things.)\nPresent Victim's Revolver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This bullet hole is the contradiction!\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is clearly where the contradiction lies!\nGumshoe:\nI don't really see what's so wrong with that spot...\nEdgeworth:\nHah. You don't understand? You see, therein lies the contradiction.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth, sir... It'd be nice if you'd just admit when you're wrong...\nEdgeworth:\nTh-That wasn't a mistake! That was me keeping you on your toes, Detective! (When the crime scene and the evidence don't add up, I Present proof to show where!)\nLeads back to:\n\"This is how I do things.\"\nEdgeworth:\nThis bullet hole is the contradiction!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What do you mean, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's elementary. Two shots were fired in this room. The first felled the victim... ...and the second felled this frame.\nGumshoe:\nHey, that's right!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, this gun was only fired once.\nGumshoe:\nHey, that's true, too...\nEdgeworth:\nWhich means that one of these two bullets was fired from a different gun. (Did the killer have another gun (Another handgun – Other than the victim's gun that I found, could there be another gun in play here?) prepared for tonight...?)\nGumshoe:\nBy the way, I noticed something, sir...\nEdgeworth:\nYes?\nGumshoe:\nWhat's that thing sticking out from behind the frame?\nEdgeworth:\nAh, that. It's a secret safe.\nGumshoe:\nA s-secret safe!? Oh, I smell money!\nEdgeworth:\nI'll spare us the trouble and just say it. Nothing like what you're imagining is inside. Now, if you could kindly move this frame out of the way.\nGumshoe:\nRoger that! *achoo* *achoo* Talk about dusty!\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose that's what happens when I'm not here to dust it once in a while.\nGumshoe:\nI had no idea there was a safe here, or I'd have kept it clean for you, sir! So when did you put this thing in?\nEdgeworth:\nIt wasn't something I had installed personally. Every prosecutor's office has one.\nGumshoe:\nReally!? I had no idea!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, only prosecutors are supposed to have knowledge of their existence.\nGumshoe:\nSo... what's inside, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nRight now? Nothing. We only use them to store especially important evidence when a trial is in session.\nGumshoe:\nThat's it...? Talk about squashing my hopes and dreams...\nSecret Safe data jotted down in my Organizer.\nLeads to examination of secret safe\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecret safe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nSafe keypad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hm...? Now this is odd...\"\n\n\n\n\nSafe door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI never knew there was a safe hidden back here!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, if detectives knew about them, then they wouldn't be \"secret\" now would they?\nGumshoe:\nAre there any other secret, hidden things in this room?\nEdgeworth:\nEven if there were, it would defeat the purpose of them being \"hidden\" if I told you. So don't bother looking for them.\nGumshoe:\nS-So there's no, like, hidden camera around, right?\nEdgeworth:\nHm? And what if there was...? [sic]\nGumshoe:\nA-Ah! No, it's nothing! Forget I said anything!\nEdgeworth:\n(Do I even want to ask what he's been doing in my office while I've been away!?)\n\n\n\n\n\nRevolver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the victim's gun.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, and I guess there's one more, right?\nEdgeworth:\nWe certainly can't discount the possibility. However, we must then ask ourselves, why would the killer leave evidence behind?\nGumshoe:\nIt's not exactly something you'd put down and forget about...\nEdgeworth:\n...Not unless we're talking about you, Detective. (There's something unusual about the killer's actions. And none of it is adding up. What does it all mean?)\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent Secret Safe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI had no idea you had one of these things! I mean, I thought I knew everything there is to know about you, Mr. Edgeworth! I feel like I've caught a glimpse of the hidden side of Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(There's a great deal you don't know about me... At least, I hope so...)\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm...? Now this is odd...)\nGumshoe:\nYou found something, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nThis keypad... Don't you find it to be a bit too clean?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! There's a thick layer of dust all around it, but not on the keypad itself.\nEdgeworth:\nYou there, the forensic scientist!\nForensics:\nYes, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nCould you please dust this area for fingerprints?\nForensics:\nYou got it, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n............\nForensics:\nI couldn't find, let alone lift, a single print. Looks like it was wiped down well (Wiped fingerprints – All of the fingerprints on this have been wiped clean off.).\nSecret Safe data updated in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nAs I thought... (It appears that Logic is the only way around this setback. Time to rationally and calmly play connect the dots with the information we have.)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecret safe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I've already finished examining this area, but it never hurts to look again.)\n\n\n\nSafe keypad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's dust on the rest of the safe, but not here on this keypad.\nGumshoe:\nAccording to the forensic scientist, he couldn't find a single print, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nThat the keypad to the safe was wiped down this carefully... Hmm... Perhaps I should take a good look at all the information we've collected so far.\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"The killer's goal\" and \"Wiped fingerprints\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI believe I have figured out what the murderer was after.\nGumshoe:\nWell, what is it, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nThe fact that the safe was wiped clean of fingerprints suggests... ...that the criminal had at least attempted to open my safe. Making the culprit's motive for breaking and entering, theft (Motive: Theft (?) – The culpit [sic, typo added in 2024 re-release] tried to open my safe. Was the killer's motive theft?), I believe. (I wonder if knowing that the motive behind this break-in was theft... ...changes what the other pieces of information can tell me about this crime?)\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Signs of a struggle\" and \"Motive: Theft (?)\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is a possibility that the files splayed on the floor...\"\nEdgeworth:\nThere is a possibility that the files splayed on the floor... ...are not the result of a struggle between the victim and his killer.\nGumshoe:\nOh! You mean like it could be from when the killer tried to find something, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. We need to figure out if any of the files have been stolen.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir! I'm gonna shelve files like you've never seen before, even at a library!\nEdgeworth:\nUm, sure... Let's give that a try...\nPortsman:\nWhy do all the good ones always die young? Surely you must ponder that every once in a while, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n............ No matter how much we lament, the dead will not come back to life. All we can do is search for the truth.\nPortsman:\n......... And? So what are we supposed to do? How do we go about finding the truth?\nEdgeworth:\nFirst, we calmly restore the files to their rightful place.\nPortsman:\nYou got it! Here, let me help!\nGumshoe:\nUm, so this file goes here, and that book goes there...\nPortsman:\nYou sure know a lot about where things go, despite it being Mr. Edgeworth's office.\nGumshoe:\nBecause I'm the one who keeps it tidy, pal! OK! Done!\nEdgeworth:\nIt would appear that the murder was definitely committed here.\nGumshoe:\nUnnngh... The bloodstains on the bookshelf are still fresh...\nEdgeworth:\nI suspect that the victim was killed in a standing position, hence the prints on the shelf.\nGumshoe:\nAnd then the guy fell onto the floor, right? The blood on the floor's kinda grossing me out!\nEdgeworth:\n...Detective, I don't have the time to deal with your weak stomach right now.\nGumshoe:\nNnngh... But you know I'm no good with blood, sir...\nLeads to examination of crime scene\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForensics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMay I have a word with you?\nForensics:\nPlease, I need absolute silence. Dusting for prints at a crime scene is a most sacred process.\nEdgeworth:\n(The man loves his job... Maybe a bit too much.)\n\n\n\n\nOfficer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have anything to report?\nOfficer:\nSir, yes, sir! Seeing Mr. Portsman tearing up like that... ...has brought an unstoppable torrent of tears to my own eyes, sir!\nGumshoe:\n...Were you good friends with Mr. Faith, pal?\nOfficer:\nNo, sir! But I can't help myself. I'm sympathetic to other people's tears!\nEdgeworth:\n...If I may make a suggestion, I'd clean myself up so as to not give the wrong impression.\n\n\n\n\nPortsman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Portsman. A word, if I may.\nPortsman:\nOh, Jim... Your laugh, your smile... I'll never be able to joke around with you again... But don't you worry, Jim! I'll joke around enough for the both of us! You'll see!\nEdgeworth:\n...He's not listening at all. (Mr. Portsman is off in his own little world, it seems.)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm certain there's something wrong with this picture...)\n\n\n\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloody handprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe victim's handprints...\nEdgeworth:\nHe must have tried to support himself with his hands here after being shot.\nGumshoe:\nThere are prints on the floor, too.\nEdgeworth:\nThose must have been made when, unable to stay standing, he dropped to the floor.\n\n\n\n\nFiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI put them all back, just as they should be, sir! Doesn't look like anything's missing!\nEdgeworth:\nAlthough, it does look like the killer moved the body to flip through my shelves. (I wonder if they found what they were looking for...?)\n\n\n\n\nBullet hole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nSo this is where the bullet lodged itself after it went through the victim, huh.\nEdgeworth:\nFor the bullet to be lodged so squarely in a file spine... ...indicates that the files were ransacked after the shooting had occurred.\nGumshoe:\nThen I guess the victim was moved because he was in the killer's way...\n\n\n\n\nLarge bloodstain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt appears that the victim was in a sitting position here after being shot.\nGumshoe:\nOh! So that's why the seat of the victim's pants has blood on it!\nEdgeworth:\nThat would be the logical conclusion.\n\n\n\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe killer moved the body because it was leaning against the bookshelf.\nGumshoe:\nThe blood on this guy's pants proves that pretty well!\nEdgeworth:\nIn a sense, I suppose.\nGumshoe:\nSee! I'm not completely useless, Mr. Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\n\nDeduce bullet hole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Scene Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is clearly a contradiction here with this bullet hole!\"\n\n\n\n\nAny other deduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is clearly where the contradiction lies!\nGumshoe:\nI don't really see what's so wrong with that spot...\nEdgeworth:\nHah. You don't understand? You see, therein lies the contradiction.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth, sir... It'd be nice if you'd just admit when you're wrong...\nEdgeworth:\nTh-That wasn't a mistake! That was me keeping you on your toes, Detective!\nLeads back to examination of crime scene\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime scene oddity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo? Any keen insights, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I noticed that you... haven't found anything odd about the crime scene yet! That's unlike you, sir! If you spot something that seems off, you should check it out! All you have to do is line the cursor up with where you see a contradiction... ...and press [X / Y / triangle / T] (changed from [hit the Deduce Button] in the original release). But after that, you've still gotta back up your hunch. Pick the piece of evidence that does the job and Present it with [X / Y / triangle / T] (changed from [Present it] in the original release), sir! It's that easy!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I suppose you've spotted something already, which is why you explained all this?\nGumshoe:\nUm, not really... But hey! That's what you're here for, Mr. Edgeworth! To find them all in a jiffy!\nEdgeworth:\n(Beaming with overconfidence as he none too subtly cries for assistance.)\nEdgeworth:\nThere is clearly a contradiction here with this bullet hole!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What do you mean, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't see? Quite simply, the bullet hole itself is too low. If the victim was shot in the stomach, the hole should be much higher up.\nGumshoe:\nBut what if the guy was shot while he was sitting or lying down, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat would be illogical. The victim leaned against this shelf here after being shot. Which suggests that he was standing when he was shot.\nGumshoe:\nThen that means...! ............Wait, what does that mean, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nIt means you need to use your brain every once in a while instead of mine, Detective. In any case, it means someone made a faulty assumption. And it was from this mistake that our current contradiction was born! What is the faulty assumption that caused this problem with the bullet hole's position?\nThe position of the body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf the victim was shot while he was lying down...\nGumshoe:\nWait... Didn't you just say that line of reasoning is illogical, sir? You said, \"The victim leaned against this shelf here after being shot.\"\nEdgeworth:\n...I was trying to be nice and explain my complex logic in an easier way for you, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nOh, really!? Thanks for thinking of me, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Good, I don't think he noticed my mistake.)\nLeads back to:\n\"What is the faulty assumption that caused this problem with the bullet hole's position?\"\nThe position of the handprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe position of the handprints is what's causing this problem. We wouldn't be in this dilemma if the handprints were closer to the ground!\nGumshoe:\nBut the handprints are where they are... Up top.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, you are quite perceptive! Which is why this is not a viable hypothesis.\nGumshoe:\nOh, so it was just a \"what if\"? Then what's the right answer?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... You still can't figure it out? Then allow me to explain.\nGumshoe:\nYes, please, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(Guess he didn't notice the slip-up. Although, at this point, I shouldn't be surprised.)\nLeads back to:\n\"What is the faulty assumption that caused this problem with the bullet hole's position?\"\nThe order of the files\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I believe the order of the files is a bit off.\"\nEdgeworth:\nI believe the order of the files is a bit off.\nGumshoe:\nYou mean I put them back in the wrong order just now? Hey! Actually, I think the labels on the files are wrong, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nOh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah! You see here how the files that were shot begin with the number 0? What are those doing all the way down there after 1, 2, and 3!? That's really weird!!\nEdgeworth:\nActually, the way they are organized now is the correct order. They are exactly as I see them in my mind's eye.\nGumshoe:\nBut the numbers are all out of order.\nEdgeworth:\nThose white binders are special, so they are arranged a little differently. But from this, we know that the files were not in this order when the crime occurred. (Aha! So that's it!) I believe the killer made the same incorrect assumption as you just did, Detective. Let's re-arrange the files in numerical order and see what we find out.\nGumshoe:\nDo you think it'd be OK to prop the body back up to how it was before it was moved?\nEdgeworth:\nThey've finished processing the crime scene, so I don't see why it wouldn't be. If you please, Detective Gumshoe!\nEdgeworth:\nAs I suspected... The bullet hole is now where it should logically be. The killer went through my files first before shooting Mr. Faith.\nGumshoe:\nAnd then put the files back in numerical order, I guess.\nEdgeworth:\nExactly. And then proceeded to shoot the victim.\nGumshoe:\nBut why would someone kill a man and then look through your files one more time?\nEdgeworth:\nPuzzling indeed. The files were thrown into disarray twice (Files in disarray - The culprit re-arranged my files twice, once before and once after the murder. Why?), once before and once after the crime. But why?\nLeads to examination of crime scene\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Now the crime scene is as it was at the time of the murder. Time to give it another look.)\n\n\n\nBloody writing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Th-This...!\"\n\n\n\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere must be some reason as to why the victim's body was moved. But there is no time to ponder that now. Let us continue with our investigation, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nRoger that, sir! I'm raring to go!\n\n\n\n\nBloody handprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThese handprints belong to the victim, right? They make sense with the body position.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, he must have left them when he was trying to support himself after he was shot. (However, the final position of the body shows that it was moved... I need to go over this crime scene with a fine-toothed comb one more time.)\n\n\n\n\nBullet hole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs I suspected... The bullet hole is now where it should logically be.\nGumshoe:\nAnd we figured out that the killer went through your bookshelf twice.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed... There are many things the killer did that don't make sense. But to figure out the whys, we need more information.\nEdgeworth:\nTh-This...!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What is that!? Why does it say \"Gumshoe\" on there in blood!?\nPortsman:\nI'd say that's (changed from [it's] in the original release) some incredibly incriminating evidence...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, indicative of criminal activity, indeed.\nGumshoe:\nNo! Wait! There's gotta be some mistake! Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Help me! Say something, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n......... It appears that one of my files was stolen.\nGumshoe:\nIs that all, sir!? What about me and my situation!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this what the killer was really after?)\nStolen File data jotted down in my Organizer.\nInvestigation Complete\nPortsman:\nLooks like Jim was able to leave us the name of his killer in the end. And this most important message managed to reach us.\nGumshoe:\nI'm telling you! It wasn't me!!!\nPortsman:\nYou can't be terribly pleased to hear that your beloved partner is the guilty party.\nEdgeworth:\nIf you are going to accuse Detective Gumshoe of being the culprit... ...I sincerely hope you have some proof to back it up.\nPortsman:\nJim's words... They're more than enough, wouldn't you say?\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's how you want to play it, then at least allow me to understand your reasoning.\nPortsman:\nYou got it!\nEdgeworth:\n(I don't like this one bit. There's something strange about this man's attitude. And there must be some sort of flaw to his logic waiting for me to dig out.)\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth! Wh-What are you going to do?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat I always do in court; I'm going to cross-examine him. One way or another, I'll expose the flaw in his logic with this technique.\nGumshoe:\nOoh! How do you do that!? C-Can you explain it to me, sir!?\nMight as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAlright. First, I listen to the witness's testimony. If I find a flaw in the testimony, something that contradicts the evidence... ...I open the Organizer with [R / RB / R1 / E] (added in 2024 re-release) and Present the piece of contradictory evidence! (To Present something, I simply use [X / Y / triangle / T] (changed from [touch the Present Button] in the original release), but that's old news.)\nGumshoe:\nBut it's not like there's gonna be a flaw in their testimony every time, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect, and at those times, I need to Press the witness with [L / LB / L1 / Q] (changed from [by touching the Press Button] in the original release). Sometimes by pressing, I can draw out new information, and new or modified testimony.\nGumshoe:\nI think I get it, sir! I'll be sure to try this technique out during investigations, too!\nEdgeworth:\nVery well. I'll even show you how it's done. Now watch carefully.\nLeads to Argument\nMaybe some other time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Portsman... If you are ready.\nGumshoe:\n...Aww, if you don't have time, you could just say so, sir.\nLeads to Argument\nArgument\n-- Mr. Portsman's Logic --\nPortsman:\nDetective Gumshoe. You stole Jim's gun from him and shot him dead.\nFurthermore (changed from [Further] in the original release), you messed up the files to make it look like you had committed theft instead.\nThat's when you moved Jim's body that was sitting in front of the bookshelf!\nBut thanks to that, you didn't notice the bloody letters his body was hiding.\nAnd it will be by his final words that you will be brought to justice.\nEdgeworth:\nYou intend to argue that the victim's dying message points to his killer...?\nPortsman:\nI can hear Jim's voice, and he's calling for his killer's arrest!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Are you sure you're not mishearing his words, Mr. Portsman? (There is no way Detective Gumshoe is the culprit here... I will find the flaw in this man's logic... ...and expose it with credible evidence!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You know, there's something I've been meaning to ask... Portsman: Hm? What is it? Edgeworth: Why do you call the victim \"Jim\"... ...when clearly, his name is \"Buddy Faith\"...? Portsman: Isn't it obvious? \"Jim\" is the perfect name for my companion. \"Jacques and Jim\". Don't those two names go together like peanut butter and jelly (changed from [jam] in the original release)? Gumshoe: But \"Jim\" isn't even close to the guy's real name... Portsman: Well, \"Jacques and Buddy\" just sounds... off somehow. Besides, he was the third of a bunch of guys I decided to nickname \"Jim\". Edgeworth: (Hmph. He talks about the victim like he was his pet.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you really think it was necessary to dishevel my shelves twice to do that? Portsman: That's true... OK, then maybe his real intent WAS theft. Gumshoe: Hey! Are you accusing me of stealing something from Mr. Edgeworth!? Portsman: It's a possibility. Maybe your salary's been cut so much that life is getting a little too rough to handle...? Gumshoe: I'll have you know that I eat three square meals every day, pal! ...OK, so all three of them happen to be instant noodles, but... Portsman: Poor thing. What an evil prosecutor you were paired up with. And what a motive, no?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: And why would Detective Gumshoe do such a thing? Portsman: Because the body was getting in his way. He had to mess up your bookshelf somehow, right? Anyway...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Why do you think that the killer didn't notice the bloody letters? Portsman: The body was covering it quite well, wouldn't you say? That's how he missed it. But judging by what I've seen, it doesn't take much for your detective to miss something. Gumshoe: Who do you think you are!? You know nothing about me, pal! Portsman: There's a lot a person can understand about another from first impressions alone. Edgeworth: (I can't say I disagree with him on that point...) Gumshoe: Wh-Why don't you say something, sir!? ...*gasp!* N-Not you, too, Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: (Despite his lack of attention to detail, I don't believe the detective to be the culprit. Nobody could've overlooked the bloody letters, and I can prove it... with evidence.) Portsman: I couldn't ask for a better set-up... ...for the game-finishing spike!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you saying that those letters were intended for you? Portsman: Yup. Jim was an outstanding detective. I would expect no less from my former partner. Edgeworth: (It looks like Mr. Portsman still doesn't understand... He has yet to figure out the true meaning behind the bloody letters.) Portsman: What are you sputtering over there? Can't you just admit my logic is perfectly sound?\nEdgeworth: (Actually, there's a gigantic flaw in his logic... A gap so wide that even the good Detective can spot it. Now to clue Mr. Portsman in by presenting him with some evidence.)",

Ha ha ha.\nEdgeworth:\nIf you have the time to laugh, then you have the time to take another, closer look at this. Do you still not see? If not, may I direct your attention to the missing file...\nPortsman:\nWh-Whaaaaaaat!? That's impossible!!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's \"impossible\", Mr. Portsman?\nPortsman:\nUm, uh, nothing...\nEdgeworth:\nThe files on that shelf are all about a certain case. When the killer went to take the file after murdering your partner... ...I highly doubt they could've missed the bloody letters written on the spines.\nPortsman:\nPortsman:\nIt's possible that they could have taken the file before committing the murder!\nEdgeworth:\nI think it's pretty obvious that the file was stolen after it was written on. The missing letters in the detective's name where the file should be is proof.\nGumshoe:\nYeah! I mean, the \"s\" is gone, and there's only half an \"h\"!\nEdgeworth:\nIf Detective Gumshoe really was [sic] the culprit of this case... ...I highly doubt that even he could overlook his own name written in blood on the files. Especially as a detective who can't stand the sight of blood!\nPortsman:\n*gasp!*\nGumshoe:\nWhich means... what exactly? What does that make this dying message...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt makes it the work of a criminal intent on tampering with the crime scene.\nPortsman:\n............\nGumshoe:\nThat's so low! I can't believe the criminal tried to pin this whole thing on me, sir! I'm gonna get 'em, sir! You'll see! I'm gonna have them under arrest in no time!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Mr. Portsman?\nPortsman:\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Brilliant! Absolutely splendid! Logic deserving of Olympic gold!\nEdgeworth:\nI appreciate the praise, but it doesn't change the fact that your reasoning is flawed.\nPortsman:\nMeh, you win some and you lose some. That's how life goes.\nGumshoe:\nGlad everyone's so cheery... even though I feel more dead than alive.\nPortsman:\nAh, but you know, it really is a shame... I really didn't want to have to bring this up, however...\nGumshoe:\nW-What is it this time!? Are you still after me, pal!?\nPortsman:\nHumor me for a second. Who has the key to this office?\nGumshoe:\nThat would be me! But Mr. Edgeworth just proved that I'm innocent, pal!\nPortsman:\nThat's absolutely right! And I acknowledge your innocence.\nEdgeworth:\nThen why do I sense that you still have something to say?\nPortsman:\nWell, I was thinking. Did you know there is one other person with a key to this office?\nEdgeworth:\n(One other person...?)\nPortsman:\nHey, you there!\nOfficer:\nYes, sir! What is it, sir!?\nPortsman:\nWould you kindly fetch and escort that lovely young lady here for me...?\nEdgeworth:\n(A lady...?)\nPortsman:\nThe girl is a member of this building's security. Think of her as a \"material witness\".\nGumshoe:\nS-Security!? Did you say, \"Security\"!? No, stop it, pal! Don't!\nEdgeworth:\n(What's wrong with him all of a sudden?)\nPortsman:\nI believe she needs no introduction. I have called upon Ms. Maggey Byrde, a member of security.\nByrde:\nD-Detective Gumshoe, sir...\nGumshoe:\nMaggey!\nPortsman:\nMs. Byrde is the security guard on watch tonight.\nEdgeworth:\nI see. And your point is?\nPortsman:\nMy point is that she could very well have used it. And by \"it\", I mean the master key, which can open all the office doors in this building.\nGumshoe:\nWh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nPortsman:\nIf you are not the guilty party, Detective Gumshoe... ...then the only other person with access to this room is Ms. Byrde.\nByrde:\nHow dare you!? I would never sneak into someone's room!\nGumshoe:\nThat's right! I refuse to believe that Maggey's the culprit, pal! Um... It was me! That's right, I did it!\nPortsman:\nCan we take that as a confession, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUm, well, it wasn't really me... But it definitely wasn't Maggey, pal! So, yeah, it was me! If it was, you'd have no problems with that, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nPlease refrain from flying off the handle, Detective. There's no need for such theatrics.\nPortsman:\nListen to your boss, Detective. He understands what I'm saying here. That girl is the only one who could've committed the crime, and for one simple reason!\nArgument\n-- Reason for Suspicion --\nPortsman:\nIt's pretty obvious that Ms. Byrde snuck into your room using the master key.\nI mean, if Detective Gumshoe isn't the one who opened the door...\n...then that leaves only Ms. Byrde as our prime suspect.\nOn top of which, she knows our good detective, doesn't she?\nMaking it all the (changed from [that] in the original release) more probable that she was the one who faked the dying message.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you're saying she used the master key...\nMaster Key data jotted down in my Organizer.\nPortsman:\nIncredibly incriminating evidence, wouldn't you say?\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster Key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the master key to every office in the building.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's what you claimed about the evidence earlier as well...\nPortsman:\nThat was then, this is now. The flow of a good match always changes during a rally. It's all about your reflexes and reaction time, especially for an athlete like me!\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder if there was anyone else other than Ms. Byrde who could've used the master key? It seems that the only way to get Mr. Portsman to give me more details is to Press him.)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you sure Ms. Byrde is the only member of security who could've used the master key? Portsman: There's only one person on staff at this time of night. And tonight, she's it. Isn't that right, Ms. Byrde? Byrde: That's, um... true... But... But I wasn't able to use the master key at the time of the crime, sir! Edgeworth: (\"Wasn't able to\"...? What's that supposed to mean?) Portsman: Yes, yes... Moving on. I'd hate to get sidetracked by something unrelated. Gumshoe: Whaddaya mean, \"unrelated\"!? I wanna hear what she has to say, pal! Portsman: But you can't really trust her not to tell lies. Plus, I hate wasting time. Edgeworth: (Hmm, should I hear Ms. Byrde out...?) Ask for more details Edgeworth: Not so fast. I, too, am interested in hearing what Ms. Byrde has to say. Portsman: Didn't I just say it'd be a waste of time? We don't need to hear her lies. Edgeworth: I'll be the judge of that. Ms. Byrde, if you please. Byrde: I discovered that the master key was missing at around 1 AM, sir! Edgeworth: What do you mean by \"missing\"? Byrde: As in \"it wasn't anywhere in the security booth\", sir! The killer must've stolen it! Edgeworth: Mr. Portsman, I believe this to be an important piece of testimony. Don't you? Portsman: *sigh* I can't believe that someone like you would be taken in by such words. Byrde: I'm not lying, sir! Portsman: Portsman: If that's the case, then I'd like to know... why you have the master key now? Byrde: I... I don't quite know. It just reappeared all of a sudden, sir. Portsman: Hah, a likely story. And where is your proof that the key was stolen to begin with? I bet you just forgot where you put it and then \"found\" it again. Byrde: I never lose things! I can practically guarantee that! With me, if something disappears, it's usually because someone stole it! Gumshoe: Yeah, pal! Trust me, you don't want to test just how bad her luck is! Edgeworth: .........Unfortunately, I can't deem this piece of testimony as conclusive. Portsman: Glad you agree, Mr. Edgeworth. Gumshoe: Unnnngh... But! But! You still haven't established Maggey's motive for breaking into Mr. Edgeworth's office! Portsman: Her motive? Didn't we already establish that it was theft? I mean, the culprit clearly went through the bookshelves and at least tried the safe. Edgeworth: It is as Mr. Portsman says, Detective. (I can't ignore the fact that all the evidence points towards a motive of theft. But I'm done taking blows. It's time to counterattack with a few facts of my own.) Adds statement \"Her intent? From the messed-up shelves to the wiped-down safe, I'd say thievery.\" No details necessary Edgeworth: (Hmm, maybe I should pay more attention to what Mr. Portsman is saying for now.) Leads back to rebuttal Edgeworth: Not so fast. I, too, am interested in hearing what Ms. Byrde has to say. Portsman: Didn't I just say it'd be a waste of time? We don't need to hear her lies. Edgeworth: I'll be the judge of that. Ms. Byrde, if you please. Byrde: I discovered that the master key was missing at around 1 AM, sir! Edgeworth: What do you mean by \"missing\"?

Portsman: You mean her motive? Didn't we already establish that it was theft? I mean, the culprit clearly went through the bookshelves and at least tried the safe. Edgeworth: It is as Mr. Portsman says, Detective. (I can't ignore the fact that all the evidence points towards a motive of theft. But I'm done taking blows. It's time to counterattack with a few facts of my own.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I concur that the culprit's motive appears to have been thievery, however... Portsman: Glad to hear that the great Miles Edgeworth is in agreement with little ol' me. Edgeworth: However, with regard to the investigation of the bookshelves and safe... Portsman: Hey! Good thinking, asking for my opinion on the matter! Edgeworth: .........Would it be too much for you to allow me to complete a full sentence?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I thought we had established Detective Gumshoe's innocence pretty thoroughly. Portsman: It was just a theory, one hypothesis among the many possibilities. I mean, I had my doubts about Ms. Byrde from the very beginning. Edgeworth: If that's the case, then why didn't you mention her first? Portsman: Now, now. Don't make that face. See! There goes the truth, running the other way! Let's pick up the pace and see if we can't catch up to it! Edgeworth: I don't think you're catching my drift... Portsman: Ah, but we are in agreement that the detective isn't the killer, right? If so, then I hope you'll understand when I say... ...that since she is the only one who could've opened (changed from [open] in the original release, correcting the typo) your office door...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Don't you think it's a bit early to be jumping to conclusions? Portsman: Are you saying there's another way to open the door other than with the master key? Oh, I get it. Perhaps you had a spare made for someone else? Edgeworth: I'll have you know, I have never made a spare, so what are you insinuating? Portsman: Nothing. Guess I should've known better than to suggest that someone like you would.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Is there anyone in this district who hasn't at least heard of Detective Gumshoe? Portsman: Good point. He's practically a celebrity among us prosecutors. Gumshoe: Really!? I never knew I was so talked about, sir! Portsman: We're holding our collective breath, you know. For when you screw up so badly that you're literally chased off the force. Gumshoe: W-Wait, WHAT!? IS THAT TRUE, MR. EDGEWORTH!? Edgeworth: ............ O-Of course not. Th-That's (changed from [T-That's] in the original release) hogwash! Gumshoe: Phew... Don't scare me like that! I almost had a heart attack there...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: By \"dying message\", you mean the bloody letters that spell out \"Gumshoe\"...? Portsman: I figured that whoever wrote his name must have wanted to frame him. And just the act of choosing his name is proof enough that the two knew each other well.\nGumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! What are you waiting for! Hurry up and present some evidence!\nEdgeworth: I would love to... But first, we should listen a bit more, and digest what he is saying.

And tonight, she's it. Isn't that right, Ms. Byrde?\nByrde:\nThat's, um... true... But... But I wasn't able to use the master key at the time of the crime, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(\"Wasn't able to\"...? What's that supposed to mean?)\nPortsman:\nYes, yes... Moving on. I'd hate to get sidetracked by something unrelated.\nGumshoe:\nWhaddaya mean, \"unrelated\"!? I wanna hear what she has to say, pal!\nPortsman:\nBut you can't really trust her not to tell lies. Plus, I hate wasting time.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm, should I hear Ms. Byrde out...?)\n\n\n\nAsk for more details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nNot so fast. I, too, am interested in hearing what Ms. Byrde has to say.\nPortsman:\nDidn't I just say it'd be a waste of time? We don't need to hear her lies.\nEdgeworth:\nI'll be the judge of that. Ms. Byrde, if you please.\nByrde:\nI discovered that the master key was missing at around 1 AM, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean by \"missing\"?\nByrde:\nAs in \"it wasn't anywhere in the security booth\", sir! The killer must've stolen it!\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Portsman, I believe this to be an important piece of testimony. Don't you?\nPortsman:\n*sigh* I can't believe that someone like you would be taken in by such words.\nByrde:\nI'm not lying, sir!\nPortsman:\n\nPortsman:\nIf that's the case, then I'd like to know... why you have the master key now?\nByrde:\nI... I don't quite know. It just reappeared all of a sudden, sir.\nPortsman:\nHah, a likely story. And where is your proof that the key was stolen to begin with? I bet you just forgot where you put it and then \"found\" it again.\nByrde:\nI never lose things! I can practically guarantee that! With me, if something disappears, it's usually because someone stole it!\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal! Trust me, you don't want to test just how bad her luck is!\nEdgeworth:\n.........Unfortunately, I can't deem this piece of testimony as conclusive.\nPortsman:\nGlad you agree, Mr. Edgeworth.\nGumshoe:\nUnnnngh... But! But! You still haven't established Maggey's motive for breaking into Mr. Edgeworth's office!\nPortsman:\nHer motive? Didn't we already establish that it was theft? I mean, the culprit clearly went through the bookshelves and at least tried the safe.\nEdgeworth:\nIt is as Mr. Portsman says, Detective.

Besides, Maggey doesn't have any reason to want to sneak into Mr. Edgeworth's office!\nPortsman:\nYou mean her motive? Didn't we already establish that it was theft? I mean, the culprit clearly went through the bookshelves and at least tried the safe.\nEdgeworth:\nIt is as Mr. Portsman says, Detective.

Good thinking, asking for my opinion on the matter!\nEdgeworth:\n.........Would it be too much for you to allow me to complete a full sentence?\nPresent Secret Safe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Do you wish to continue insisting that Ms. Byrde was set on stealing something?\"\nPortsman:\nI mean, if Detective Gumshoe isn't the one who opened the door...\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI thought we had established Detective Gumshoe's innocence pretty thoroughly.\nPortsman:\nIt was just a theory, one hypothesis among the many possibilities. I mean, I had my doubts about Ms. Byrde from the very beginning.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case, then why didn't you mention her first?\nPortsman:\nNow, now. Don't make that face. See! There goes the truth, running the other way! Let's pick up the pace and see if we can't catch up to it!\nEdgeworth:\nI don't think you're catching my drift...\nPortsman:\nAh, but we are in agreement that the detective isn't the killer, right? If so, then I hope you'll understand when I say... ...that since she is the only one who could've opened (changed from [open] in the original release, correcting the typo) your office door...\nPortsman:\n...then that leaves only Ms. Byrde as our prime suspect.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nDon't you think it's a bit early to be jumping to conclusions?\nPortsman:\nAre you saying there's another way to open the door other than with the master key? Oh, I get it. Perhaps you had a spare made for someone else?\nEdgeworth:\nI'll have you know, I have never made a spare, so what are you insinuating?\nPortsman:\nNothing. Guess I should've known better than to suggest that someone like you would.\nPortsman:\nOn top of which, she knows our good detective, doesn't she?\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIs there anyone in this district who hasn't at least heard of Detective Gumshoe?\nPortsman:\nGood point. He's practically a celebrity among us prosecutors.\nGumshoe:\nReally!? I never knew I was so talked about, sir!\nPortsman:\nWe're holding our collective breath, you know. For when you screw up so badly that you're literally chased off the force.\nGumshoe:\nW-Wait, WHAT!? IS THAT TRUE, MR. EDGEWORTH!?\nEdgeworth:\n............ O-Of course not. Th-That's (changed from [T-That's] in the original release) hogwash!\nGumshoe:\nPhew... Don't scare me like that! I almost had a heart attack there...\nPortsman:\nMaking it all the (changed from [that] in the original release) more probable that she was the one who faked the dying message.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBy \"dying message\", you mean the bloody letters that spell out \"Gumshoe\"...?\nPortsman:\nI figured that whoever wrote his name must have wanted to frame him. And just the act of choosing his name is proof enough that the two knew each other well.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth! What are you waiting for! Hurry up and present some evidence!\nEdgeworth:\nI would love to... But first, we should listen a bit more, and digest what he is saying. (And Press him for more information.)\nEdgeworth:\nDo you wish to continue insisting that Ms. Byrde was set on stealing something?\nPortsman:\nWhy not? It's the truth, after all. It was also by your logic that we came to the whole thievery conclusion anyway.\nEdgeworth:\nThat may be, but you must also be aware of the fact that the safe is a secret safe. The existence of which is only privy to prosecutors...\nPortsman:\nAh!\nEdgeworth:\nI find it a little hard to believe that a hidden safe was a part of her cunning plan.\nPortsman:\nB-But...! But she could've found it by accident while she was turning everything else upside-down!\nEdgeworth:\nI highly doubt that. I'd say the culprit knew exactly what they were looking for. After all, only the bookshelf and the safe were targeted.\nPortsman:\nNnnnghaaaaaargh!\nGumshoe:\nYeah! Even I didn't know about that safe, pal! And that means there's no way Maggey could've known about it either!\nPortsman:\nTh-Then are you proposing... ...that the killer is a prosecutor...?\nEdgeworth:\nInteresting conclusion. That's definitely looking more and more probable.\nPortsman:\n............\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's wrong, Prosecutor? Do you have a different suspect in mind now?\nPortsman:\nI... I... Curses! Why!? What made you--!?\nGumshoe:\nWh-What's with the angry face all of a sudden...?\nPortsman:\nIt's... It's all my fault...!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean?\nPortsman:\nIt's Jim... He knew... about the existence of the secret safes.\nEdgeworth:\n! What did you just say...!?\nPortsman:\nWe were partners! Like inseparable conjoined twins! That's why I told him. I filled him in on the secret safes.\nGumshoe:\nThen that means...\nPortsman:\nYeah, I know. I had only just told him, too... Obviously, it was wrong of me to tell him... I still can't quite believe it, but the thief who broke into your room was probably Jim...\nEdgeworth:\n(Now he's claiming that the victim was the thief...?)\nPortsman:\nAnd... you were simply trying to stop him, weren't you? Ms. Maggey Byrde...\nByrde:\nExcuse me?\nEdgeworth:\n.........!\nPortsman:\nI mean, you ARE a security guard, right? That's your job. But, killing is going a bit too far, even in your risky profession.\nGumshoe:\nWhat the--!? You're still accusing Maggey of the murder!?\nPortsman:\nYes and no. I mean, she had stumbled upon Jim, who had probably drawn his gun... I get it! It was self defense, wasn't it!?\nByrde:\nN-No! I... I couldn't... I could never do something like that, not even as a security guard, sir!\nGumshoe:\nPlus, even if he was [sic] the thief, he wouldn't have a key to this office!\nPortsman:\nWhich is precisely why he had to steal it, wouldn't you say? It was Jim who stole the master key.\nByrde:\nAaah!\nPortsman:\nPretty impossible for a supposedly \"stolen\" key to be here with us, unless... ...well, unless you retrieved it from Jim after you killed him.\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Portsman, are you honestly accusing your own partner of being a thief?\nPortsman:\nI don't want to admit it, but it's the only way for everything else to make sense.\nEdgeworth:\n(Has he no honor!?)\nPortsman:\nNow then, I think we're done here. The investigation waits for no man. Would you people be so kind as to see yourselves out?\nGumshoe:\nYou can't kick us out! This is Mr. Edgeworth's office!\nPortsman:\nAh, but I'm the one who's been assigned to this case. You are all suspects to varying degrees, and therefore, ineligible to run this show.\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nGumshoe:\nListen, pal! How many times do I have to say this!? Maggey CAN'T be the culprit!!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe! Calm yourself.\nGumshoe:\nB-But, sir...\nEdgeworth:\nWe have no choice but to accommodate his request... for now.\nPortsman:\nHa ha! Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. At least ONE of you understands. Now, then, if you could remove yourselves from my crime scene, I'd be most grateful.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Mark my words, Mr. Portsman. We will meet again.\nPortsman:\nIf that's a formal request from the legendary prosecutor himself, then I suppose so. Now don't disappoint me, you hear!?\nTo be continued\nMarch 14, 4:18 AM\nProsecutor's Building - 12th Floor Hallway\nGumshoe:\nWhat is with that prosecutor!? I can't believe how rude he was! It was... unbelievable!\nEdgeworth:\nPlease maintain your professionalism, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nI'm gonna find some real solid evidence proving Maggey's innocence! You'll see, sir!\nByrde:\nBut we've been kicked out of the crime scene, sir!\nGumshoe:\nT-True... So then, what now!?\nByrde:\nLooks like my life's fallen into yet another gigantic ditch.\nEdgeworth:\nDo not despair, Ms. Byrde. We can overcome this as well. There are many other places and things we should be looking into anyway.\nGumshoe:\nEh!? Really, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nFor example, this hallway. The lynchpin of his argument against Ms. Byrde is related to the master key. In that case, this hallway is the perfect place to look for more information... ...regarding the mystery surrounding my door.\nBegin Investigation\nProsecutor's Building - 12th Floor Hallway\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaggey Byrde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering if I may speak with you for a bit concerning this case.\nByrde:\nI've always been a big fan of the courtroom, but this... ...this is like a dream! A dream where I'm being cross-examined by THE Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't let this chance pass me by. I must remember to ask her about the master key. I should jog her memory by showing my notes to her with [X / Y / triangle / T] (changed from [through the Present Button] in the original release).)\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHave you ever met the victim before?\nByrde:\nWell, I've seen him a couple of times before when I had to go to Mr. Portsman's office. Mr. Faith was always playing basketball with Mr. Portsman, sir.\nGumshoe:\nThat sounds like fun! Just once, I'd have loved to play with them.\nByrde:\nIt sounds fun, but the only person ever taking a shot was Mr. Portsman... All Mr. Faith ever did was pass him the ball, sir...\nGumshoe:\n...On second thought, I don't think I'd have fit in all that well with them.\n\n\n\n\nMaggey Byrde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Maggey Byrde, correct? I take it that you are an acquaintance of the detective?\nGumshoe:\nShe was under my supervision back when she was still on the force, sir. One day, she got caught up in a murder, and things started going downhill, so she quit.\nByrde:\nBut I owe a lot to Detective Gumshoe for introducing me to my current employer! Or so I thought until a few hours ago... Right before I was about to clock out for the night...\nEdgeworth:\n...You got caught up in this whirlwind of a case, correct?\nByrde:\nDon't worry. My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures.\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nByrde:\nSince I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... And now, I even managed to be named a criminal, just when I've become a security guard.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's... a lot to go through in one lifetime...\nByrde:\nI know! And just when I thought I had finally found my happiness... ...I wind up getting you and Detective Gumshoe involved in my bad luck.\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't need to worry about me, Ms. Byrde. Nor do you need to worry about yourself. I will solve this case and prove your innocence. All I ask in return is for your cooperation.\nByrde:\nYes, sir, Mr. Edgeworth! You can count on me! I'll do all I can to help!\n\n\n\n\nUsed the master key? (appears after presenting Master Key)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat did you mean by you \"used the master key\"?\nByrde:\nOh, I had to use it to open the door for this prosecutor who had forgotten his key. I mean, it's my job as a security guard, right? .........Ah!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it?\nByrde:\nThat's right! I just remembered! The prosecutor who forgot his key... It was Mr. Portsman, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!? Please tell me more, Ms. Byrde. Quickly!\n\n\n\n\nForgetful Mr. Portsman (appears after \"Used the master key?\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByrde:\nIt was around 12 AM. Mr. Portsman had forgotten his office key, so he came down to security, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that's when you loaned the master key to him?\nByrde:\nNo way! It's against regulations to loan the master key out to anyone! I walked with Mr. Portsman to his office and opened the door for him personally, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(I see...)\nGumshoe:\nAnd then? What happened after that!?\nByrde:\nWell, he called for me to come close up his office as he was leaving to go home. That was around 1:30 AM, I think.\nEdgeworth:\nSo, in summary, for the sake of one forgetful prosecutor... ...you used the master key twice (Used the master key – This key was used to unlock and lock Portsman's office at 12 AM and 1:30 AM.) tonight.\nGumshoe:\nTalk about suspicious!!\nEdgeworth:\nI doubt you can say that you've never left your keys at home, Detective... (I think this calls for a thorough examination of Mr. Portsman's door.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByrde:\nThat's a Prosecutor's Badge, isn't it? It proves that you're really a prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\n(Interesting... Despite all appearances, she seems to know more than Gumshoe.)\nByrde:\nWith that badge, even I could be a professional prosecutor... Sir, may I please try that on? Just for a little bit!?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't think that would be a very good idea, do you?\nByrde:\nI-I guess not...\nEdgeworth:\n(On second thought, they're actually on the same level...)\n\n\n\n\nMaster Key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo when did you discover that the master key was missing?\nByrde:\nBy the time I realized it, I think it was around 1 AM, sir. And I noticed it was back at around 2:30 AM. It was just sitting there on the ledge where the security room's reception window is. But I'm sure that between those two times it was not just gone, but stolen (Master key was stolen – This key went missing from approximately 1 AM until 2:30 AM.), sir!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy is such an important key stored in such an insecure place?\nByrde:\nAh, it's not like that, sir. We always keep the key further inside the room, away from the window.\nEdgeworth:\nAlways, you say? Except for this time, correct?\nByrde:\nWell, I admit that was a bit careless, but I had my reasons! I left it out because I was sorta using it at the time. It was after I had used it that I left it sitting out on the ledge.\nEdgeworth:\n(She used the master key?)\n\n\n\n\nPortsman's Office Door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByrde:\nI've had to open Mr. Portsman's office up for him a number of times before. I've also had the chance to see the inside of his office on a number of occasions, too. He's got shelves upon shelves of sports memorabilia, trophies, and awards in it... ...to the point where it's almost beyond gaudy, sir. ...But maybe I just feel that way because I'm jealous since I don't have even a single one.\nGumshoe:\nDon't say that, Maggey! I... I'll make a special \"Guard of the Month\" award, just for you!\nByrde:\n...Thanks for trying, but I've already got a mountain of consolation prizes, sir. They're proof of just how unbelievably unlucky my life has been. Plus, getting an award from you just isn't the same as getting a real award, sir!\nGumshoe:\nN...Nnnnnnnngh!\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByrde:\nI'm just a lowly security guard, so... ...I'm not sure what I should do with that other than to guard it!\nEdgeworth:\n(*sigh* It's like talking to another Gumshoe.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor:\nIt looks like you're in quite the pinch, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nTo be sure, a murder within the walls of the prosecutor's office is no trifling matter. We must find, apprehend, and punish the killer accordingly post-haste.\nProsecutor:\nSounds like a messy case you've got on your hands. If you ever feel lost, or need some advice, my door is always open!\nEdgeworth:\nHow gracious. I will keep your offer in mind. (...Who is this guy again?)\n\n\n\n\nOfficer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIs everything alright?\nOfficer:\nYes, sir! If you must know, I weighed myself this morning, and I'm finally at 154 pounds!\nEdgeworth:\n...Congratulations, but I was asking about this hallway and this room.\nOfficer:\nOh! Everything's OK, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nA word of advice. Stay focused, or you may start to lose even more weight.\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSofa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nFile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...? It's...\nGumshoe:\nAh! Isn't this that missing 0-series file, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nNo doubt about it. The bloody letters mark it clear as day. ...There seem to be a few pages missing. Our thief took only what was necessary, and left the rest behind.\nGumshoe:\nSo what are these 0 files about, sir? I guess they've got something worth stealing in them, huh.\nEdgeworth:\nNot particularly. It's just a collection of court case files. However... ...the cases within these files are not mine.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThey belonged to the high prosecutor that used to occupy my current office. I have my reasons, but let's just say I was charged with keeping them as they were.\nGumshoe:\nThen that means the thief must've also wanted the file for a specific reason, right?\nEdgeworth:\nIt would seem so. Only the pages related to that case from 10 years ago are missing.\nGumshoe:\nI wonder why anyone would care about such an old case?\n\n\n\n\nFile (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the stolen file... But what's it doing under here?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, and why would you steal something and then leave it behind?\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like our thief took only what was needed.\nGumshoe:\nSo what are these 0 files anyway?\nEdgeworth:\n(Didn't I just explain that a few minutes ago?)\nGumshoe:\nI guess they've got something worth stealing in them, huh.\nEdgeworth:\nNot particularly. It's just a collection of court case files. However... ...the cases within these files are not mine.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThey belonged to the high prosecutor that used to occupy my current office. I have my reasons, but let's just say I was charged with keeping them as they were.\nGumshoe:\nThen that means the thief must've also wanted the file for a specific reason, right?\nEdgeworth:\nIt would seem so. Only the pages related to that case from 10 years ago are missing.\nGumshoe:\nI wonder why anyone would care about such an old case?\n\n\n\n\nCushions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA well-crafted, high-quality sofa for visitors. The stitching is excellent.\nGumshoe:\nTalk about a luxury waiting area. These babies are also great for napping, you know!\nEdgeworth:\nYou would sleep even out here, Detective? In a hallway?\nGumshoe:\nWhenever I do, I always wind up dreaming about giving testimony up on the stand. But it always ends the same way: me getting trounced by a lawyer! Isn't that awful!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Maybe I should give it a try sometime... To envision myself winning, naturally.)\n\n\n\n\nSpace under sofa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI bet the thief's... not under here...\nGumshoe:\nI guess there isn't enough space for anyone to hide under here anyway. I mean, if someone could contort themselves to fit, I'd be REALLY impressed!\nEdgeworth:\n(Sounds to me like somebody has already tried at least once before...)\n\n\n\n\n\nSofa (subsequent times, after examining file)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nLeft office door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nDoor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA minimalist, yet classy door made of top-quality wood. It's sturdily made, making it near impossible to break in by force.\nGumshoe:\nIt's almost... majestic, sir. I wish I could be as stately as this door.\nEdgeworth:\n(Only Gumshoe would praise a door as something greater than himself...) Being a detective has its own rewards, and a certain virtuous value... I think. If you live up to your full potential... that's a poignant trait that anyone can admire.\nGumshoe:\nI see! So you're saying, sir, that me being me is the best thing I can do for everyone?\nEdgeworth:\n............Right.\nGumshoe:\n...That long pause wasn't exactly reassuring, sir.\n\n\n\n\nNumber plate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n1202. These four numbers on a number plate alone proclaim this to be my office.\nGumshoe:\nWhoops! ...Hey! These number plates slide right out, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nThey have to be able to take the plate off when a room becomes vacant, you know. Although... the idea that it can be so easily removed is kind of...\n\n\n\n\nDoorknob\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI don't see any signs of forced entry.\nGumshoe:\nAnd according to the guard, no signs that the lock was picked, either, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nMeaning that the door really was opened with a key. Hmm... Did you happen to ask if any prints were lifted from the doorknob?\nGumshoe:\nApparently, the doorknob's clean as a whistle. Wiped, they think.\nEdgeworth:\n(Whoever this thief is, they did a good job of not leaving any clues behind.)\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft office door (subsequent times, after examining doorknob on door)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nBasketball\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is a basketball doing here...?\nGumshoe:\nThat's Mr. Portsman's prized possession, sir. I heard he also plays soccer, dodge ball [sic], and even tennis.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd not a single one of those sports is suitable to be played in a hallway.\n\n\n\n\nRight office door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis office...\nGumshoe:\nUm... 1203... 1203... Hey Maggey, whose room is this again?\nByrde:\n...It's Mr. Portsman's, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nSo he's my new neighbor, I see... I suppose he moved in while I was away overseas?\n\n\n\n\nRight office door (after clearing \"Forgetful Mr. Portsman\" Talk option with Maggey Byrde)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA minimalist, yet classy door made of top-quality wood.\nGumshoe:\nIt's kinda majestic, too! Fits in really well with the ambiance of the prosecutor's offices! Even Mr. Portsman seems dignified, just because he works behind one of these.\nEdgeworth:\nNonsense. A man doesn't become more or less dignified because of where he works.\nGumshoe:\nWell, he still seems more dignified than Mr. Payne.\nEdgeworth:\n(Mr. Payne...? I suppose custodial work can also be dignified.)\n\n\n\n\nNumber plate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nRoom 1203. I take it that this is Mr. Portsman's office?\nByrde:\nYeah, you can't mistake it because of that basketball hoop, sir. Oh, that reminds me. Mr. Portsman had actually wanted room 1202 really badly. But since you were already occupying it, Mr. Edgeworth, we put him next door, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nSo why was Mr. Portsman so particular about getting room 1202?\nByrde:\nI'm not sure, but I bet it's because of something like his birthday is December 2nd...?\nGumshoe:\nYup! That's gotta be it! I can't think of another reason why!\nEdgeworth:\n(I can think of at least three... Bah. Why am I even wasting time thinking about this?)\n\n\n\n\nDoorknob\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe door is locked tight.\nGumshoe:\nHeh heh, I bet the ol' credit card trick wouldn't work here, huh Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the office of a high prosecutor, Detective. These doors would be pretty ineffective if the average cat burglar could get through them.\nGumshoe:\nAha! So I guess only a GREAT cat burglar could get in! That must be who our culprit is!\nEdgeworth:\n...Might I advise you to return that conclusion to whatever pawn shop you bought it from?\n\n\n\n\nBasketball hoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nIt's Mr. Portsman's personal basketball hoop.\nEdgeworth:\nI can't believe he put something like this in the hallway of a Prosecutor's Office.\nGumshoe:\nBut, you know, it's actually pretty useful, sir! I haven't gotten lost trying to get to your office since it's been here!\nEdgeworth:\n(How long have I had the same office, and yet you STILL managed to get lost!?)\n\n\n\n\n\nDeduce doorknob (after examining doorknob of door and connecting \"Master key was stolen\" and \"Used the master key\" Logic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)\n\n\n\nPresent Mr. Portsman's Office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's a contradiction here between reality and the evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nAny other deduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis location contradicts this piece of evidence!\nGumshoe:\nHmm? I don't see anything wrong at all, sir...\nByrde:\nDetective Gumshoe! You should think a little harder, sir! ...Although I don't really get it myself, either.\nEdgeworth:\nI-I see... In that case, I'll point out what's wrong once more for the two of you. (I sense that if I look a little harder, I'll find the contradiction slumbering here. I should probably also flip through my Organizer one more time...)\nLeads back to examination of right office door\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's a contradiction here between reality and the evidence. If what Ms. Byrde has said is true, then why is this door locked tight?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? You know, you're right!\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Byrde, are you sure you didn't re-lock this door?\nByrde:\nI am certain of it, sir. And I don't think Mr. Portsman noticed it himself that I hadn't...\nGumshoe:\nWhich means... what, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nIt either means that he actually DOES have the key to his office... ...or that the door Ms. Byrde opened wasn't this one at all, but a completely different one.\nGumshoe:\nShe opened a different door? But how can you prove that?\nEdgeworth:\nThere's an easy way to find out. All we need to do is... ...we need to examine these:\n\n\n\nPrints on the master key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf we examine the fingerprints on the master key...\nGumshoe:\nWell, if that's what you want to examine, sir, that was the very first thing we did. I can tell you that we didn't find any prints other than Maggey's.\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nByrde:\nThat's so brilliant, Mr. Edgeworth! So what can we deduce from that?\nEdgeworth:\nAh, well...\nByrde:\nI'll tell you what I deduced! I think this means that the culprit wiped their prints off!\nEdgeworth:\n............Y-Yes, that's exactly it. I'm glad you were able to come to the same conclusion. However, the more important matter is... \nLeads back to:\n\"...we need to examine these:\"\n\n\n\n\nPrints on the doorknob\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The prints on the doorknob will tell us everything!\"\n\n\n\n\nPrints on the number plate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe prints on the number plate, they will tell us all (changed from [all that] in the original release) we need to know.\nByrde:\nEverything? Really? ...Like what, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nLike... Well, for example... And such as... Well, we know for sure that Detective Gumshoe's dinner will only consist of instant noodles!\nGumshoe:\nWoooooow!!! That was amazing, sir! How did you know!?\nByrde:\nWas that supposed to be a joke to cheer me up, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nY-Yes, that's it. Now then, we should get back to doing what we need to do and that is...\nLeads back to:\n\"...we need to examine these:\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe prints on the doorknob will tell us everything!\nGumshoe:\nHey, you! Yeah, you, pal! Do us a favor and see what you can lift from this, OK!?\n\n\nGumshoe:\nSo!? What did you find out!?\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no need for such belligerent nostril flaring, Detective.\nForensics:\nSir! I have found only Mr. Portsman's and Mr. Faith's prints on this doorknob.\nEdgeworth:\nSo only two people's prints were found on this, huh? That's pretty decisive...\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I'm lost, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nThinking logically, a certain other person's prints should be on this knob as well. (Now then, whose prints should also be on this doorknob?)\n\n\n\nPresent Maggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Don't you find it odd that the prints of the person who unlocked this door are absent?\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent Buddy Faith or Jacques Portsman profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nGumshoe:\n............\nByrde:\n............\nGumshoe:\nUm, we already found Mr. Portsman's and Mr. Faith's prints, sir...\nEdgeworth:\n...Urngk! I-Is that so... W-Well, there should be one other person who left their mark on this.\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then, whose prints should also be on this doorknob?\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent Dick Gumshoe profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nGumshoe:\nAnd why would my prints be on this knob, sir?\nByrde:\nAre you saying that Mr. Gumshoe has broken into Mr. Portsman's office before!?\nGumshoe:\nWh-What!? I've never even been inside that office! What are you saying, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nY-Yes, well... ...I was just testing your naïveté. I'll answer you straight from now on.\nGumshoe:\nI wish you had done that from the very beginning, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nUm, sorry.\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then, whose prints should also be on this doorknob?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDon't you find it odd that the prints of the person who unlocked this door are absent?\nGumshoe:\nYou mean...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, the door that Ms. Byrde opened could not have been this one, but a different one.\nMr. Portsman's Office data updated in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? What have we here?)\nLeads to examination of right office door\n\n\n\n\n\nRight office door (after Mr. Portsman's Office data is updated in Organizer)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nBasketball\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIs this basketball property of Mr. Portsman?\nByrde:\nYes, sir! He's always ready for a match!\nGumshoe:\nBasketball, soccer, dodge ball [sic], tennis... It doesn't matter what sport it is, he's game. Although, I think it'd be a little hard to play tennis with this ball. Ho ho.\nEdgeworth:\nThat isn't the point you should be focusing on, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nY-You're right, sir! Now I know what I should be focusing on! Bad Mr. Portsman! Someone should teach him to clean his toys up after he's done playing!\nEdgeworth:\n...I think we've reached the end of this conversation.\n\n\n\n\nLower part of basketball hoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? What's this...?)\nGumshoe:\nWhat are you looking at, sir? Oh, hey! How about a game?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's OK, Detective... I just found the position of this hoop to be a little off.\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're right, sir! I guess it shifted when someone made a seriously sweet slam dunk!\nEdgeworth:\n(The positioning of the hoop is definitely unnatural... I'd better take note of this.)\nBasketball Hoop data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nLower part of basketball hoop (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm?

Oh, there's something written on it!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... It looks like a note from the victim.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, and it's for Mr. Portsman.\nNote Left by Victim data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nSlip of paper (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this?\nGumshoe:\nLooks like a scrap of paper. I'll get it, sir! Let's see... Oh, there's something written on it!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm...

I'm afraid there's a flaw in your story.\nByrde:\nWhat!? No way, pal! I mean, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nYou said that you locked up Mr. Portsman's office at around 1:30 AM, correct? However, the master key had already been stolen at that time.\nByrde:\nWoooow... Nothing gets by you, Mr. Edgeworth! You saw that contradiction like a pro! I had totally forgotten (changed from [forgot] in the original release) all about that! But thanks to you, I remember it now! You're right! It was around that very time that I realized the master key was missing.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd...?\nByrde:\nWell, I'm a security guard, sir! I couldn't just admit to losing the master key, could I? So I... I pretended to lock up his room... sir.\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"pretended\"?\nByrde:\nYeah, I used my house key and made it look like I was locking up, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nSo in actuality, you never did re-lock the door, then.\nByrde:\nWell, I thought that maybe I could go lock it after I found the key... Come to think of it, I guess the door still hasn't been locked properly...\nMr. Portsman's Office data jotted down in my Organizer.\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything of interest?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. You look rather intrigued by something. Care to share?\nGumshoe:\nAw, it's nothing... but I noticed that Mr. Portsman calls his partner \"Jim\". And the detective in that Sunday night drama, \"All My Cops\", is named Jim, too! I bet one of them is a big fan of that show.\nEdgeworth:\nYou seem to know a little something about it yourself. I take it you watch it, too.\nGumshoe:\nOf course! The tight bond of friendship between prosecutor and detective is great, sir! But it's nothing compared to the super strong friendship we have, ho ho ho.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Friendship\", Detective? I think you're mistaking it with \"pity\".\nGumshoe:\nH-How can you say that, sir!? And after all we've been through, too... *sniffle*\n\n\n\n\nTalking to witnesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAbout Ms. Byrde...\nGumshoe:\nNo way she's the killer! Please don't tell me you buy into that accusation, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nRest assured I think she's innocent. However, I need to ask her a few things regarding her security guard position.\nGumshoe:\nWell, if you're only asking, that's OK. Just stand next to her and then press [A / X / space] (changed from [touch the Talk Button] in the original release). Then you two can talk about whatever topic you pick. When you want to ask her about evidence, all you have to do is Present it to her with [X / Y / triangle / T] (changed from [Present it] in the original release). After you choose what to show her, press [X / Y / triangle / T] (changed from [touch \"Present\"] in the original release) again, and off you two go! I recommend showing different people different things. You'd be surprised by what they say!\nEdgeworth:\nThank you for the explanation, though I don't recall asking for one.\nGumshoe:\nOh, just so you know, sir, you can show ME evidence in the same way, too!\nEdgeworth:\nI do believe it's time to get down to business and ask some questions of Ms. Byrde.\nGumshoe:\nIgnored again... *sniffle*\n\n\n\n\nAce Investigator (appears after examining file under sofa and clearing \"The Victim\" Talk option with Maggey Byrde)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering about the investigation...\nGumshoe:\nOh, I've been waiting for this! Let a real, seasoned pro teach you how it's done!\nEdgeworth:\n(A real seasoned pro? Of instant noodle cuisine, perhaps.)\nGumshoe:\nYou know that you can always check out the really important spots in more detail, right?\nEdgeworth:\n... Yes...\nGumshoe:\nAnd if the area is too big, you can always use [R analog stick / RS / arrow keys] to take a look around. (changed from [the Arrow Buttons at the bottom, right?] in the original release) Oh, but don't worry, sir. The [R analog stick] command will (changed from [Arrows] in the original release) only show up when you need it (changed from [to use them to see more] in the original release).\nEdgeworth:\nI knew that as well.\nGumshoe:\nAND! When you think there's a contradiction or something unusual, try Deduction! First, you line up your cursor with the suspicious-looking area. Then press [X / Y / triangle / T] (changed from [touch \"Deduce\"] in the original release) and choose your poison, I mean, evidence. When you've settled on a piece, you've gotta Present it with [X / Y / triangle / T] again (changed from [Present it] in the original release)!\nEdgeworth:\nI'm pretty sure I already knew that as well, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nWell, if you can remember all that, then welcome to the world of pros! I dub you, \"Ace Investigator\"! Class dismissed!\nEdgeworth:\n(And all I wanted was an update about the investigation...)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasketball Hoop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey, I love basketball! I play all the time when I'm off duty!\nEdgeworth:\n...Interesting.\nGumshoe:\nYou should see me dribbling, faking, and weaving like a pro with my trusty coat on, sir! They call me the \"Green Supernova\"!\nEdgeworth:\n(He wears that tattered rag of a jacket even on his days off?)\nAfter examining file under sofa, doorknob of left office door, lower part of basketball hoop, and slip of paper under right office door:\nInvestigation Complete\nEdgeworth:\nPoking around in this hallway has actually paid off quite handsomely.\nGumshoe:\nHuh...? H-How so, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nIn a variety of different ways... I think it's time we had a little chat... ...with the real culprit of this case.\nByrde:\nY-You know who the real killer is!? Wow, Mr. Edgeworth!!\nEdgeworth:\nAs long as my logic is sound, then yes... The mastermind behind this murder is none other than Mr. Portsman.\nByrde:\nWhaaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Portsman!?\nGumshoe:\nI knew it! That's exactly what my logic senses were telling me, too! I suspected it was him from the instant he accused Maggey of being the killer, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(That is anything but logical.) Lady and gentleman. Prepare yourselves. Come what may, it's time to knock on Truth's Door.\nMarch 14, 5:12 AM\nHigh Prosecutor's Office - Room 1202\nForensics:\nMr. Portsman! I've finished processing the bloody letters, sir!\nPortsman:\nAlright! Let me take a gander at it! Pass it here! OK, looking good! You there! Take good care of this!\nGumshoe:\nGwwwwoooooooooooooooaaar!!!\nPortsman:\nWell, if it isn't Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nEnd of the line for you, Portsman. We've got you now!\nPortsman:\nCall off your dog, Mr. Edgeworth. Is this some kind of joke?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's no joke. We know, Mr. Jacques Portsman, that you are the guilty party in this case.\nPortsman:\n...! You must be pretty upset, getting chased out of your own room. I'd be mad, too. So I guess you can stay... If you promise to stay out of our way.\nEdgeworth:\nYou intend to hide your crime under the guise of a prosecutor doing his job? Hmph, I can see right through the unsightly, paper-thin mask you wear upon your cowl.\nPortsman:\nHa ha. Who'd have ever thought it would come to this? Actually, come to think of it, your mentor was Manfred von Karma, right?\nEdgeworth:\n!\nPortsman:\nThe legendary prosecutor who never lost a single case for 40 long years. But there was always this... incessant chatter about forged evidence with that guy.\nEdgeworth:\n............\nPortsman:\nReally teaches me that I've got to stay on the lookout for false accusations, you know?\nEdgeworth:\nAre you done trying to play mind games with me, because they won't work. The only thing you should be using that mouth of yours for now is explaining yourself. Although that, too, will only dig your hole deeper. Either way, your game is up.\nPortsman:\nWell, aren't we full of ourselves? Even though you have yet to prove anything.\nTestimony\n-- Mr. Portsman's Rebuttal --\nPortsman:\nI have no idea what sort of hair-brained idea you have in mind, but...\n...there's a mountain of evidence that points away from me being the culprit.\nBesides, how, may I ask, do you propose I unlocked your door and got in here?\nLook, I feel bad doing this to you, but I've got work to do, so we're done here.\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, but we are not finished, yet.\nPortsman:\nBoy you're stubborn. I suppose you're basing your accusations on something?\nEdgeworth:\n(I'll show you what I'm basing my accusation on... with evidence.)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: My accusation is a hair-brained idea, is it? Portsman: You tell me. I'd say it is. After all...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Oh? And what, pray tell, kind of evidence are we talking about here? Portsman: Jim was my partner, so you can't say I had a motive for killing him! Edgeworth: And...? That's it? That's not even an anthill, let alone a mountain. Portsman: But it's more than enough, wouldn't you agree? Edgeworth: ...Might I recommend that you review what the word \"evidence\" means. Portsman: It doesn't change the fact that the evidence doesn't point to me as the killer.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Unfortunately, I believe I have already shown how earlier. Portsman: Your speculations mean nothing, as I still insist that I could not gain access to your room. Edgeworth: (What should I do now? Should I raise an objection?) Raise an objection Edgeworth: You claim to have had no way to open my door, however, is that really the honest truth? Portsman: Ha ha! Alright, I'll humor you. Go ahead, shoot! Edgeworth: Very well, then. I propose that you used this to open my door! Present Master Key Edgeworth: Leads to: \"I believe you were able to open my office door.\" Present anything else Edgeworth: Portsman: ............? And how do you propose I used this object to open your door? Edgeworth: You... That is... Portsman: It's OK. I know when someone's just grasping at straws. Edgeworth: ...Gnnnrk! (What was it that Mr. Portsman used to gain entry into my office? I'd better take another look in my Organizer...) Leads back to rebuttal Don't raise an objection Edgeworth: (I need to gather a bit more information.) Portsman: What's wrong? Don't tell me all you wanted to do was find fault with my flawless logic? Leads back to rebuttal Edgeworth: You claim to have had no way to open my door, however, is that really the honest truth? Portsman: Ha ha! Alright, I'll humor you. Go ahead, shoot!

The saying, \"Evidence is everything\" isn't limited to just the courtroom, you know.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. You need not remind me. I'll show you all the evidence you want in time.\nEdgeworth:\nI believe you were able to open my office door. With the master key, no less.\nPortsman:\nPortsman:\nWait, wait, wait. Hold on for a sec. I never laid a finger on that key, as you already know.\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. You were able to open my door without lifting a single finger. Well, maybe you did, but only to direct.\nPortsman:\n.........!\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right.

But why don't we ask the girl herself whose door she opened, shall we?\nByrde:\nUm... I'm certain that it was Mr. Portsman's door, sir. I checked the number plate to make sure I was opening the right door, sir!\nPortsman:\nSee, Ms. Byrde backs up my story.\nEdgeworth:\nYet, what if you had mislead her, to fool her into thinking what you wanted?\nPortsman:\nHah! And how do you suppose I did that!?\nEdgeworth:\nBy switching the number plates on our doors, for example.\nByrde:\nThat's right! They do slide out pretty easily!\nEdgeworth:\nFurthermore, you then used one other thing to give a very strong impression... ...that the door she was opening was yours and not, in fact, mine.

The basketball hoop, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's quite the peculiar fixture in any hallway, let alone a hallway in this building. Which is why it left an usually [sic] strong impression on you. It's an object perfectly suited to sit just outside the office of a peculiar prosecutor.\nPortsman:\nGwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nByrde:\nThat's very true, sir! Because there was a basketball hoop sitting there... ...I thought the door I was opening had to be Mr. Portsman's!\nEdgeworth:\nThere are signs that the hoop has been moved. To sit it in front of my office, to be sure.\nPortsman:\nI...I see. So that's how you throw suspicion on people. Thanks for the tip. But I think your conjecture is a little off the race track.\nTestimony\n-- Conjecture's Rebuttal --\nPortsman:\nNow you're just spouting nonsense.\nI had the girl open my office door.\nAfter that, I was in my room the entire time.\nYou don't have a single reason to suspect me!\nEdgeworth:\n(So he intends to claim his innocence to the end, does he?)\nPortsman:\nI'm as pure and innocent as my jacket. And Ms. Byrde is as dirty and guilty as the jacket she wears.\nByrde:\nMy jacket's not dirty, I'll have you know! I just washed it yesterday!\nEdgeworth:\nPlease calm down, for I intend to show who is the one truly covered in slime here.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Nonsense, you say? Portsman: Yes. Because I'm telling the truth here.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Using the master key, of course... Portsman: Sure. You have a problem with that? That IS what the master key is for, right? Edgeworth: (Perhaps we should place it in an elaborate labyrinth of some sort for people like you.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: And what were you doing in your office? Portsman: I was doing my usual training regimen (changed from [regiment] in the original release). Edgeworth: Training regimen (changed from [regiment] in the original release)? Were you going through your law books from start to finish? Portsman: Mainly batting practice and some weights. Oh, and I jog when I get the chance. Gumshoe: Wow, you must be the buffest prosecutor we have! Edgeworth: ...With the weakest legal muscles, it would seem. Portsman: I was doing my usual workout so...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I think I've given you quite a few reasons, actually. Portsman: Portsman: B-But none of those would stand up on their own! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Then what about all the evidence!? Portsman: Portsman: It's all circumstantial! No judge would convict on such flimsy evidence!\nEdgeworth: (He seems to be trembling a little...

All I have to do is find the flaw in his testimony!)\nEdgeworth:\nDon't you think it's time you gave up your charade? We know you stole into my office with the intent of stealing something from me. And Detective Faith found you out. Possibly because he heard sounds coming from a room whose occupant was on leave. Mr. Portsman, you killed Mr. Faith to silence him. And I had the misfortune to return when I did; you had to threaten me as you escaped.\nPortsman:\n............\nEdgeworth:\nAs I said when you had the gun to my back... ...no one gets away with committing murder in my office.\nPortsman:\n.........Heh heh. Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh...\nEdgeworth:\n.........!\nPortsman:\nHaaaaa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!\nGumshoe:\nAnd just what's so funny, pal!?\nPortsman:\nWell, that look of stiff seriousness on the face of this office's finest prosecutor... ...as he makes a huge mistake in accusing me is simply too much to bear. There's just nothing else like it in the world!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nByrde:\nMr. Edgeworth just explained it all, and he even backed it up! You're the murderer! Stop trying to be slippery and just admit to the crime already!\nPortsman:\nAnd as I said earlier, it's all so circumstantial, so full of conjecture. You say you checked my doorknob for prints? Well, I can readily confess that I had wiped that knob down well.\nByrde:\nEh?\nPortsman:\nI'm a little obsessive-compulsive, you see. I didn't want to touch a doorknob that you had touched. Which is why I wiped the knob down as soon as I could after you opened the door. After that, it makes perfect sense that only Jim's and my own prints would be on there.\nGumshoe:\nYou! You made that up just now, didn't you!?\nPortsman:\nFurthermore, as for the note Jim left for me, do you know exactly when that was? For all we know, he could've left it there before I arrived at the office. Like, early evening, for example.\nEdgeworth:\nAre you saying you failed to notice a note in your doorway?\nPortsman:\nHey, even geniuses fail at times. I was probably too preoccupied by work-related matters, although that's no excuse.\nByrde:\nNow that's just a flat-out lie! There's no way you didn't notice a note that size!\nPortsman:\nAh, but you can't prove that, can you?\nEdgeworth:\n............\nByrde:\nSay something, Mr. Edgeworth! Back me up here, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... Portsman makes a good point. I can't prove that he didn't simply overlook it.)\nPortsman:\nBesides, I have an airtight alibi.\nEdgeworth:\nAirtight, you say?\nPortsman:\nI only just realized I had one (changed from [realized that I had one just now] in the original release) as we were talking. I guess it would've been better for all of us if I had told you sooner!\nTestimony\n-- Portsman's Alibi --\nPortsman:\nIf memory serves, you came back to this office at around 2 AM, correct?\nAnd it was then that you had that unfortunate confrontation at gunpoint with the culprit.\nBut at exactly that time, I was down in Criminal Affairs!\nAsk around. I'm sure the other detectives will corroborate my story. It's the perfect alibi!\nEdgeworth:\nDo you really think it's that perfect!?\nPortsman:\nLike I said, I don't care. Ask around all you like! You'll see for yourself.\nEdgeworth:\n......... Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nSir, yes, sir! I'll go check out his alibi, sir! Be right back!\nGumshoe:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth, sir! I think we're in trouble! It's just like Mr. Portsman said! The guys down in Criminal Affairs said they saw him at around 2 AM!\nPortsman:\nYou see?\nEdgeworth:\n............ (All of the evidence points to him being the culprit. So there must be a contradictory point in his alibi somewhere!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You are correct; it was around 2 AM... Portsman: Are you sure? It's really important to me that you're spot on with the time. Edgeworth: I remember checking my watch then, and make no mistake, it was 2. Portsman: Ooh! Giving testimony like a pro! OK, so you came back to your office at 2...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: It is as you say, however... Portsman: Yes, however, you are the only one who claims to have bumped into the culprit. So tell me, did you see the person's face? Was it me who you saw? Edgeworth: ...It was pitch black, so I couldn't actually see. Portsman: Portsman: Oh, come now. I'm sure you saw something! Try a little harder why don't you? Edgeworth: (I'm beginning to feel like I'M the one being interrogated here...) Portsman: Oh well, it doesn't matter if you remember or not. It only matters that you ran into the culprit.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you paid the Criminal Affairs Department a visit... Portsman: Yup! Right after I left the Prosecutors' Building, I headed straight for the precinct.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmm, well, we did go and ask around to confirm your testimony. Portsman: And it was just as I said, right? Gumshoe: ...Yes, sir. A number of detectives said that they saw you at around that time. Portsman: See! I have the perfect alibi! That's the ace I had up my sleeve. Edgeworth: (Argh...!)\nEdgeworth: (Portsman's alibi may seem perfect at first glance... ...but I know there's a hole in it somewhere.

Therefore... ...the second gun could've been the property of an entirely different person.\nLeads to:\n\"Which could mean...\"\nEdgeworth:\nWhich could mean... ...that there was another person (Another visitor – Maybe the victim and his killer weren't the only visitors to my office tonight.) who paid a visit to my office tonight.\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Another handgun\" and \"Another visitor\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf, indeed, there were two culprits... ...then that resolves the contradiction behind our murder weapon. Despite the fact that there are two bullets here in this room... ...the murder weapon only shows signs of being fired once. Leaving the possibility that the other bullet was fired from the other visitor's gun. Furthermore...\nLeads to:\n\"If we suppose that the second culprit's gun was the one that was pointed at my back...\"\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Files in disarray\" and \"Another visitor\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSupposing there was yet another visitor tonight... ...that would also resolve the issue of why my shelves were upended twice. We know that the shelves were disturbed once before and once after the murder... ...so it shouldn't be much of a stretch to think that it was the work of two different people. Once by the person who stole the victim's gun and then killed him with it... ...and once again after the murder by our second culprit... ...who was the owner of the second gun.\nLeads to:\n\"If we suppose that the second culprit's gun was the one that was pointed at my back...\"\nEdgeworth:\nIf we suppose that the second culprit's gun was the one that was pointed at my back...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Portsman. It seems that I need to amend my assumptions regarding this case.\nPortsman:\nGreat! So you've finally come to your senses.\nByrde:\nMr. Edgeworth!\nGumshoe:\nSir! What are you saying!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis has been a big misunderstanding on my part from the start. I had assumed that the person I ran into was the killer, but that may not be the case.\nPortsman:\nWhat do you mean?\nEdgeworth:\nThe person I ran into was just your average thief.\nGumshoe:\nA thief...? But, sir, doesn't that cause some sort of contradiction in the facts?\nEdgeworth:\nNot at all. It simply means that the killer was someone else. And it means that in actuality, two culprits stole into my office tonight!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What do you mean TWO!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt explains both why my shelves were disturbed twice and how there were two guns. Mr. Portsman tricked Ms. Byrde and gained entry into my office.\nPortsman:\nPortsman:\nNow you're just leading the argument. You still don't have any actual proof, you know!\nEdgeworth:\nIf you could please go along with my hypothetical scenario for now, Mr. Portsman. In the end, if you really are innocent, you should have nothing to worry about.\nPortsman:\nGrr...!\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, returning to my scenario, Mr. Portsman was out to steal something from me... ...which is why he checked my secret safe and ransacked my shelves. This is the first time.\nGumshoe:\nSo then... this would be when the files were put back in the wrong order, right?\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect. And then, just when he was about to look somewhere else... ...who should walk in but his own partner, Mr. Faith.\nGumshoe:\nBut why did Mr. Faith come into your room, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nHe probably had business with Mr. Portsman, which is why he was in the area. But that's when he noticed sounds coming from my office would be my guess.\nByrde:\nOh! Because you were supposed to be away, right!?\nGumshoe:\nAnd he must've thought it was odd, so he came into this office to check it out!\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect. And as a detective, that was the right thing to do.\nByrde:\nBut when he came in, he found his own partner standing there...\nEdgeworth:\nBecause it was Mr. Portsman, Mr. Faith probably let his guard down. But Mr. Portsman was not so merciful as to let him leave alive. He waited for a chance and stole Mr. Faith's gun from him, and then...! He killed him. He silenced Mr. Faith for catching him in the act of stealing.\nPortsman:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\nThis was the moment in which the first shot was fired, the one that landed in my files. Following that, Mr. Portsman wiped the gun down and left it behind as he made his exit. He could afford to do that because he had also left the fake dying message behind.\nGumshoe:\nYou're such a complicated troublemaker, you know that!?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, if things were as simple as that, then all would be solved. However... ...there was yet another visitor to my room, and this is where it gets complicated.\nPortsman:\nThere was another...?\nGumshoe:\n...Visitor, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, and this other person's objective was also to steal something from me. Now then, even after Mr. Portsman left, the door to my office remained unlocked. However, this new visitor had no way of knowing that, and so... ...they stole the master key from the security guard's room... ...and then entered my room and searched through my shelves. This was the second time they were disturbed, and it seems the thief found their prize.\nGumshoe:\nThe stolen 0 file, right, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect. Only, just as the thief was about to leave with the file, I appeared. The thief then threatened me with their own gun, and made their escape. The second bullet was fired during that brief encounter.\nGumshoe:\nSo the shelves getting messed up twice and the two bullets... It was all because two different people were doing those things at two different times!\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. So now do you see, Mr. Portsman? The person I met was just a thief, and was not, in fact, Mr. Faith's killer! Your alibi for the time frame in which I ran into the other person is now irrelevant... ...because we now know that the murder took place during the first culprit's visit!\nPortsman:\nPortsman:\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha.\nGumshoe:\nWhat's so funny, pal!?\nPortsman:\nAbsolutely splendid! Your scenario explains everything!\nGumshoe:\nOf course it does! It's Mr. Edgeworth, after all!\nPortsman:\nBut you know, it still doesn't change the fact that it's all circumstantial.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nPortsman:\nSupposing if, and that's a big \"if\", your theory is right... ...it would indeed render my alibi, which has withstood scrutiny, mind you, irrelevant. But there is still one defining point of your argument for which you have no evidence. Your supposition that I was the \"first visitor\".\nGumshoe:\nGrrrrrrr! Mr. Edgeworth! You can't let him get away with that, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n.........But he has a point. I have absolutely no proof at this point.\nByrde:\nDon't say that, sir...\nGumshoe:\nI-I don't believe this! Don't worry Maggey, I'll do something if I must!\nPortsman:\nYou know something? I find your attitude to be somewhat peculiar, Mr. Edgeworth. If the person you met really was just a plain ol' thief... ...then why is that person not your main suspect? That is, if your theory is correct.\nTestimony\n-- Portsman's Alibi, Pt. 2 --\nPortsman:\nThat thief you ran into should be your real suspect, wouldn't you say?\nWe should be out there looking for that thief right now. They might still be nearby.\nI hate to repeat myself, but as I've already said, I was training in my room.\nAnd when Jim came to deliver some evidence to me, I was down at Criminal Affairs.\nSo I can't be expected to know what happened around here after I left.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you think we should be out there looking for the thief?\nPortsman:\nOf course! Now isn't the time to be having these (changed from [wasting time on] in the original release) dead-end discussions!\nEdgeworth:\nI don't think it's at all \"dead-ended\". I find your alibi to be fascinating. Let's continue where we left off, shall we?\nPortsman:\n............\nEdgeworth:\n(I know he's lying. I know he was here, at the scene of the crime. I just have to find a way to prove it.)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Actually, no, I wouldn't. Portsman: Wh-Why not? Edgeworth: That's elementary. The dying message, of course. Mr. Faith's killer very clearly left those letters on the spines of those files... And it was after they were on there that the thief stole one of them. Gumshoe: You mean the 0 files, right!? Edgeworth: And that's how we also know the letters themselves were a set-up, and not from Mr. Faith. If the thief was [sic] the killer, do you think they would try to undermine themselves? Portsman: Aaaaah! Err, maybe the killer just didn't think of that either? Yes, that must be it! Maybe, just maybe...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Once escaped, I highly doubt a thief would linger nearby. Portsman: Well, you never know. Maybe they didn't get what they were really after. Edgeworth: Oh? You talk like you know quite a bit about this thief. Portsman: Ah, it's nothing like that! I have no idea about anything. After all...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: But according to Mr. Faith's note... Portsman: Hold on, I thought we already cleared that up. Didn't we say that Jim left that note for me in the early evening? If you have proof that he left it at a different time, say, just before he was murdered... Edgeworth: ...I don't have any, no. Portsman: You see! So I insist again that I was in my office the entire time...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Why didn't you go there with Ji... Mr. Faith? Portsman: Ah, that's because he said he was tired and was going to take a quick nap. You know those sofas in the hallway? He likes to sleep on those. It's one of his habits. Edgeworth: And what of the evidence he brought? Portsman: They were things related to yesterday's case. Just two items: a gun and a pendant. Edgeworth: (...Interesting. This piece of testimony seems too crucial to let slip through the cracks.) Adds statement \"He brought me two items, a gun and a pendant, that are related to yesterday's case.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: A gun and a pendant...? Portsman: Yes, this gun, which was the murder weapon... ...and this pendant, which belonged to the victim. Edgeworth: And why were you taking them to Criminal Affairs? Portsman: There was something in a past case file I wanted to compare these two to. But all this has nothing to do with this case right now. Anyway, I believe you'll find the long paper trail I left to be to your satisfaction. Edgeworth: (Hmm, this is all matching up with what Detective Gumshoe found out...)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I can't expect you to know, can I? Portsman: Nope. But I guess you can expect me to take a guess based on logical deductions. Edgeworth: Oh? Then let's see you deduce. Portsman: Jim waited for me to leave, and then stole the master key. For the purpose of sneaking into your room, of course. And that's when Ms. Byrde caught him red-handed... and the murder occurred. It's all exactly as I had laid out earlier.\nEdgeworth: (I know he's lying. I know he was here, at the scene of the crime. I just have to find a way to prove it.)",

I'll be following your every movement with my binoculars!\nEdgeworth:\nGood to hear. Now make sure you don't lose sight of me. I'm counting on you for backup.\nGumshoe:\nYou can count on me, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nI have to go. The kidnapper is supposed to contact me soon. (Who would've thought that upon my return, I'd be thrust into a kidnapping case. And that I would be the one who would have to make the ransom drop-off...)\nEdgeworth:\n(Let's see... I checked that the money is all there, safe inside this suitcase... Now all I have to do is await further instructions from the kidnapper... ...which I'm expecting to be transferred to my cell phone. I wonder who else is around? This is the meeting place, after all...)\n???:\nWelcome to Gatewater Land!\nEdgeworth:\nHm? Oh, thank you.\n???:\nAnd a big hello to you! I'm the Proto Badger! Nice to meet you! ............\nEdgeworth:\n............\nProto B.:\nExcuse me, but were you perhaps thinking of taking a picture of me?\nEdgeworth:\nA picture...? Of you...? Sorry, but I'm not interested.\nProto B.:\nAww, that's too bad. Well, have a good day!\nEdgeworth:\n...Hello?\n???:\n...Who aRE yOu? YoU'Re nOt ERNesT AmaNo!\nEdgeworth:\n(It sounds like the kidnapper is using some sort of voice alteration device...) I'm his representative, Miles Edgeworth.\n???:\n...ARE YoU a cOP?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, I'm......... a prosecutor.\n???:\n............\nEdgeworth:\n............ I know what you're wondering, and yes, I have brought the ransom money with me.\n???:\nI SeE... In THAt caSe, bRIng thE mOnEy wiTh You to tHe StaDIum.\nEdgeworth:\n(So this person intends to see if I'm being followed, huh. Please, Detective Gumshoe... I really need you to come through for me this one time.)\nEdgeworth:\n...Edgeworth speaking.\n???:\nNeXT, ComE to THe HaUNteD HOUsE.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd just how long do you intend to have me wander around for?\n???:\nThAt'S fOr mE To dECIdE. YoU dON't hAVE MucH of A cHOIce hERe, mY fRIeNd.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose not.\nEdgeworth:\n...I've arrived.\n???:\n...Go iNsIDe.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmph. What a dismal place...)\n???:\nThaT'S IT. GO thROuGh tHOsE DooRs...\nEdgeworth:\n(Am I being watched from somewhere?)\n???:\nLeAVe tHe MoNEy aND GO. NoW.\nEdgeworth:\nNnngh............ .................. (I was hoping for an exchange, but maybe I should do as they say for now and not push it.)\nEdgeworth:\n(I couldn't catch even a glimpse of the kidnapper. Perhaps I should keep an eye on this haunted house until police backup arrives.)\nEdgeworth:\n(Agh! It was a trap!)\nMarch 13, 11:23 AM\n????????????\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront of badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.\n\n\n\n\nBack of badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nEach Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!\n???:\nThat guy... betrayed...\n???:\nNo... can't be... Then the deal...\nEdgeworth:\n(Who is that...? And what are they talking about...?)\n???:\n...split... police...\n???:\n...Alright...\n???:\n...in front of... meet up...\nEdgeworth:\n(...I can't move my body... ...I-I fear I may faint again...)\nEdgeworth:\nWhere am I...? (How long was I out...? It wasn't raining like it is now when I made the drop-off... This was supposed to be a simple affair... ...so why have I been taken hostage as well!? I can only assume Detective Gumshoe lost sight of me at some point.)\nEdgeworth:\nThe only reason I agreed to be the drop-off man was because of that phone call. It was from Mr. Ernest Amano, the director of the powerful zaibatsu, the Amano Group. But aside from that, I also owe him a great debt of gratitude. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped. I know that Lance is already in his twenties, but I guess some things you never grow out of.\nEdgeworth:\n.................. (I can't sit around waiting for someone to come help me! I must escape somehow...) ...Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!!\n???:\nHahaha! Was that you making that funny sound!?\nEdgeworth:\n............Who's there!? And how dare you laugh at a gentleman's plight!? ...Who are you? Are you one of the kidnappers?\n???:\nA kidnapper? Me? No way! I'm not into such petty crimes. Nope! I'm after something much, much bigger!\nEdgeworth:\n.................. (Argh! I must be worn out from today's ordeal. Focus, Miles!)\n???:\nOh, I forgot to introduce myself! Sorry about that! Ahem! Even in the depths of night, when no other bird dares to take flight... ...one alone soars to shine the light of righteousness on the world's blight! And that one is me! For I am the Great Thief, Yatagarasu!\nEdgeworth:\nGreat Thief? (And did she really just claim to be the Yatagarasu?)\nKay:\nOh, but my real name is Kay Faraday. You can call me \"Kay\", 'kay!? Good! Glad that's settled!\nEdgeworth:\n.................. Not quite. I have a mountain of questions for you... ...but first, if you would be so kind as to remove these ropes.\nKay:\nHmm... I wonder... Should I remove them? I was actually having a lot of fun watching you make those silly faces...\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nKay:\nHey! There's no need to get all mad and icy glare-y on me, you know! This rope goes through here, and... there you go!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat a relief. I owe you my thanks.\nKay:\nAh, it's OK. You can pay me back in full later!\nEdgeworth:\n(Now then... What question should I start with? Unfortunately, I can already tell nothing is going to be easy with this cheeky girl...)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat Thief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou call yourself a Great Thief, yet are you really a thief at all?\nKay:\nYou doubt me? I get it! You think that a young lady like me couldn't possibly be such a big-time thief, right?\nEdgeworth:\n(That's... not the part I have a tough time believing...)\nKay:\nI am the real, genuine Yatagarasu, you know. Yup! I'm a pure-blooded Great Thief! It's a little something I inherited from my predecessor.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case... you wouldn't mind if I arrested you then, right?\nKay:\nWhat!? Of course I'd mind! I haven't stolen anything yet! Seriously, I don't know how you can (changed from [can you] in the original release, correcting the typo) say such a horrible thing to your savior!\nEdgeworth:\n(That's true. Technically, she hasn't stolen anything in front of me... yet.)\n\n\n\n\nYatagarasu (appears after \"Great Thief\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhen you say you're the \"Yatagarasu\", do you mean you are THE Yatagarasu...?\nKay:\nYup! The most righteous of the righteous! The legendary Great Thief! But I inherited the title only recently (changed from [the title was only recently succeeded to me] in the original release)... ...so I haven't had a chance to steal anything yet as the second Yatagarasu.\nEdgeworth:\n(I was not aware that thieves could pass down their titles like that...)\nKay:\nBut don't worry! I've got some big plans in the works!\nEdgeworth:\nBig plans, huh? They wouldn't happen to lead to a big arrest, would they?\nKay:\nI knew it! There's just no reasoning with a prosecutor.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm not the problem here!\nKay:\nI'll have you know that the Yatagarasu has no interest in stealing petty trinkets! There's one thing and only one thing I want to steal!\nEdgeworth:\n(Only one thing? And what would that be?)\nKay:\nBut that's going to have to wait until we find our way out of here!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, at least there is one thing we agree on. I'm sure I'll have plenty of time later to learn more about you.\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nDon't surprise me like that! I can't believe you're just shoving things in my face! I mean, aren't there more pressing things you'd rather ask little ol' me?\nEdgeworth:\n(She has a point... I should probably find out more about my mysterious savior first.)\nAfter clearing \"Yatagarasu\" Talk option:\nKay:\nSo, you never told me what your name is, Mr. Prosecutor.\nEdgeworth:\nAh, I guess not. I'm Miles Edgeworth.\nKay:\nAha! Now I remember!\nEdgeworth:\n(...How can you \"remember\" something I just told you...? But she sure is cheery.)\nKay:\nAlright, then Mr. Edgeworth, let's get outta here! ............Hm?\nEdgeworth:\n...It would seem that we are locked in from the other side.\nKay:\nWhat!? No way! I don't hear you! La la la!\nEdgeworth:\nKay, you do remember where you came in from, right...? It looks like that might be our only way out of this room...\nKay:\nWhoops, slight miscalculation. That's a good height to make an entrance from, but I can't jump that high to make an exit!\nEdgeworth:\n...*sigh* I suppose we have no choice but to look around and see if we can't find another way out.\nBegin Investigation\nIsolation Room\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay Faraday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nHey! Don't you think getting out of here is more important right now!? You can ask me about that later!\nEdgeworth:\n(I suppose she's right...)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hm? Isn't this my phone?\"\n\n\n\n\nLockers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nMan! Why did they have to put the windows so high up, anyway!? How is a thief supposed to make her daring escape!?\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose we could make our way out if we were able to climb on top of these lockers.\nKay:\nHaha! That's pretty clever! You'd make a good thief yet, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nPlease don't ever place my name and the word \"thief\" in the same sentence again.\nKay:\nLet's see... I wonder if I can jump and grab the top of the locker here... Man! Why did they have to make such ginormous lockers, anyway!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Even if we wanted to use these lockers, we'd need some sort of foothold (Lockers - If we can get to the top, then we can escape. If only there were some footholds...)...)\n\n\n\n\nBoxes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nHey! There's something inside the bottom-right box. Oh, I think it's a Pink Badger costume!\nEdgeworth:\nPink Badger...?\nKay:\nYou don't keep up with what's going on in the world, do you? In that case, you'd better study up on the whole Badger clan with this!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this thing?\nKay:\nThink of it as a bible of all the things you'll ever need to know about the clan!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Whatever. I suppose I can keep it as a reference guide or something.)\nBlue Badger Bible data jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose this means that this is where they keep all the costumes?\nKay:\nIt certainly looks that way! It's like the Badger family's home!\nEdgeworth:\n(There are eight boxes, but seven of them are empty. Which means that seven of the costumes (Costumes - It seems that the costumes of the Badger family are kept in the Isolation Room.) are in use right now.) But aren't these Badgers the mascots of the police force?\nKay:\nWell, I heard that the police had a hand in sponsoring this theme park. Probably because the Gatewater Group owes the police from all those cases they solved.\nEdgeworth:\nThey have all the power of the state, and they used it to make a theme park!?\nKay:\nIt's not just any theme park! They have a handcuff-shaped, double-looping roller coaster...\nEdgeworth:\nThat's quite enough. I'm feeling woozy from just the thought of such a thing. (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what have we here...?\nKay:\nAh! ..................\nEdgeworth:\n(Why do I feel a laser-like stare aimed right at me?) D-Did you want to take a look?\nKay:\nWell, don't mind if I do! Ooh! I see! Yes, this is definitely...! A key (Tiny key - I may be able to open something, somewhere in this room with this key.)! I'm sure it's a key to something!\nEdgeworth:\nThe \"something\" is what is relevant to my interest...\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badger boxes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nLook! It's the Blue Badger!\nEdgeworth:\n(I suppose even this thing can be popular with women.)\nKay:\nMy nemesis (changed from [I can't stand him] in the original release)!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What in the...!? (Why is she beating it (changed from [suddenly beating the Blue Badger's image] in the original release) up!?)\nKay:\nHe's got the word \"badge\" right in his name! That [sic] nothing but bad news for someone like me! (changed from [How bad is that for a girl like me!?] in the original release) And to think he's out there wandering around in this park... I'd better be careful, or he's going to arrest me by the power of his name alone!\nEdgeworth:\n(I somehow doubt that the Blue Badger has the power to arrest anyone.)\n\n\n\n\nBad Badger boxes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the Blue Badger's rival, the Bad Badger, huh. Do you feel some sort of reverence towards this Badger, Kay?\nKay:\n...Hah! I can't believe you would be so stereotypical when it comes to thieves! Surely you must also think there are much cooler, and cuter ones out there, right? That's it! I've decided that thieves and thievery need an image makeover!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Good luck with that one.)\n\n\n\n\nProto Badger boxes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is that Blue Badger I met at the main gate.\nKay:\nExcuse me, but his name is \"Proto Badger\", not \"Blue Badger\"! He's based off of the very first design created by the local police chief. You know, when you compare the two, the Blue Badger looks a bit cuter!\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose as he continued to redesign him, the chief managed to make him cuter and cuter. Even humanity has come a long way when you think about how much we've evolved.\nKay:\nAre we comparing the Blue Badger to humans now...?\n\n\n\n\nPink Badger boxes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose this is the Pink Badger? But since it has the same design, doesn't it seem forced to call this one a female?\nKay:\nYou think so? I mean, just look at how long her eyelashes are!\nEdgeworth:\nThat's the only difference.\nKay:\nAnd the fact that she's pink.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, and?\nKay:\nAnd her lips are red! See, lipstick!\nEdgeworth:\n.................. (What? She has nothing to say about the giant pink ribbon, or is that too obvious?)\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxes (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nBoxes (subsequent times, after examining key)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nBeam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the beam I was tied to. ............\nKay:\nHm? What's up?\nEdgeworth:\nI was pondering if perhaps we could make it over to and out the window if we climbed this.\nKay:\nGood thinking! And if it's climbing action you need, just leave it to me!\nEdgeworth:\nThanks. This little hook looks like it might make for a good foothold. Up you go, Kay, and good luck!\nKay:\nCount on it! The Great Thief Yatagarasu spreads her mighty wings, and takes to the skies! Here I go!\n\n\nKay:\n............\nEdgeworth:\nAs I thought, this beam (The beam I was tied to - There is a hook on this beam, but it's not enough of a foothold to climb out with.) was definitely not made for climbing.\nKay:\nWhat do you mean, \"As I thought\"!?

We're inside a building.\nKay:\nOK, then how about we light the paint on fire and send out colored smoke signals! Anyone who saw it would think some crazy arsonist was about, and call the cops! Hmm... Actually, that may not be all that great for me, seeing as I'm a thief and all.\nEdgeworth:\n...Let's try to find something other than this paint to use, shall we?\n\n\n\n\nPhoto rally sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThey're holding a Blue Badger photo rally?\nKay:\nYou didn't know?

Why not start with a picture of that?\nKay:\nYou can't do that! That's cheating! There's only one of each Badger in the park, so you have to work for it!\nEdgeworth:\nSpeaking of Badgers, there was one sitting against a wall in the haunted house.\nKay:\nSeriously?

(There must be another way out of here.)\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? Isn't this my phone? It looks like it made it through the ordeal intact.)\nKay:\nIf only there was [sic] a way for us to contact someone on the outside...\nEdgeworth:\nAh, but we do have a way... right here.\nKay:\nAh! There was a cell phone here this whole time!?\nEdgeworth:\nIf I'm right, Detective Gumshoe should have contacted the precinct for backup by now.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth, sir! Are you OK!? I was so worried, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nI'm fine. I was knocked unconscious for a spell by the kidnapper, that's all.\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry, sir! I'm such a failure! If only I hadn't lost sight of you...!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, we don't have time for this. Have the police set up a perimeter right now!\nGumshoe:\nYou don't have to worry about that, sir! I already got the boys working on that! But in doing that... I sorta... Aaaah...!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's wrong, Detective?\n???:\n...Sorry to butt in, but I'm afraid you're going to have to make do (changed from [make due] in the original release, correcting the typo) with me.\nEdgeworth:\nWho is this?\nLang:\nShi-Long Lang of Interpol. A pleasure to speak with you, Mr. Edgeworth. I've heard a great deal about you.\nEdgeworth:\nSo why exactly is an Interpol agent like yourself involved in a domestic kidnapping case?\nLang:\nDon't sweat the details. A crime's a crime whether it's on a local or a global scale. Besides... ...you're the one who's in a world of trouble.\nEdgeworth:\nA-And why would you say that!?\nLang:\nLang Zi says: \"The pack that runs together, stays together.\" You catch my drift? You caused quite a ruckus by running blindly into a situation and then getting caught.\nEdgeworth:\nTsk...!\nLang:\nYou should've contacted the police from the very beginning.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry that this happened because of a lapse in judgement. However, I humbly request that you please help me out of here posthaste.\nLang:\n......Sorry, no can do.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nLang:\nWe're hunting the kidnapper now, and I haven't got any hands to spare. As I said, my pack moves as one. You're the one who wanted to go it alone, so good luck to you... Mr. Prosecutor. Oh, and once we do catch the kidnapper, rest assured we'll come find you... eventually.\nEdgeworth:\n...You... You...\nKay:\nWhat's wrong? Did you get cut off!?\nEdgeworth:\nNo... My phone ran out of power.\nKay:\nNo way!\nEdgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter anyway. We should try to get out of here through our own means.\nKay:\nYeah! I have a name to live up to, after all! If we put our heads together, we're sure to find a way out!\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay Faraday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kidnapping (appears after examining cell phone, Bad Badger head, and photo rally sign)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know where the person who kidnapped me went?\nKay:\nWell, after they locked you up in here... ...it sounded like they went into the next room, and started talking to someone.\nEdgeworth:\n(I feel like I heard something as well, but it's all a haze in my mind. However, I do recall that the kidnapper was talking with someone... It was just a guess before, but I guess I really AM dealing with two kidnappers here.)\nKay:\nAfter that, they left. It almost seemed as if they were done with you.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose that is the case, as my kidnapping seems like an afterthought to the $1 million. Well, if they went into the next room, let's see what we can find out through the slot.\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoor (after clearing \"The kidnapping\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nOoh, we can peer into the room the kidnappers were in from there!\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nBeam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is a beam in the next room identical to the one in this room. There's even a hook on it to hold a propped-up floor panel in place. Which reminds me...\nKay:\nDid you find something useful, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, perhaps. I may have found a very handy hint to how we'll get out of here.\n\n\n\n\nHatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIs that what I think it is?\nKay:\nIt looks like the kidnappers had an escape tunnel prepared just in case. That's awesome! They're like a bunch of Great Thieves themselves!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, they're not, because I highly doubt they made the tunnel themselves. The floor panel was removed and propped up (Open floor panel - The panel is held in place by a hook. The entrance to an underground room perhaps?) against the beam in a very specific way. I think this building was originally built with a basement or underground area.\n\n\n\n\nGray door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's a door on the opposite side that appears to be the same as this one. Which would mean... ...that I can probably assume that these two rooms are very similar in structure. (I believe I may have just found our ticket out.)\n\n\n\n\n\nDoor (subsequent times, after examining hatch)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nOoh, we can peer into the room the kidnappers were in from there!\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Open floor panel\" and \"The beam I was tied to\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This hook on this beam...\"\nEdgeworth:\nThis hook on this beam...\nKay:\nYou know I already tried, and there's no way I can jump from this hook to the window! Come on, even you have to admit when something's just not possible.\nEdgeworth:\nHah, I wasn't about to suggest that again. Rather, that it's here for a different purpose.\nKay:\nReally!? Like what!?\nEdgeworth:\nAs you saw in the adjacent room, it's clearly for keeping a floor panel propped up. Which means that there should be a panel in this room that we can open as well.\nKay:\nOh! I get it!\nEdgeworth:\nWe didn't notice its existence all this time because it was being hidden by this tarp.\nKay:\nAlright then! Let's fold this thing up and see what's underneath!\nKay:\nNow THIS is what I call a treasure!\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosed hatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nWow, this must be another entrance to the secret, hidden basement! I totally smell treasure!\nEdgeworth:\nThe scent I wish to smell is the sweet fragrance of freedom.\nKay:\nThen what are you waiting for!? Hurry up and open the hatch!\nEdgeworth:\nAlright. .........Mmnph. This thing is locked down tight (Underground entrance - We might be able to escape through here, but the door is locked.).\nKay:\nAww! Fiddlesticks!\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Tiny key\" and \"Underground entrance\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I believe you're up, Kay.\"\nEdgeworth:\nI believe you're up, Kay.\nKay:\nHuh? Why me?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause we need to use the tiny key that you've taken quite a liking to.\nKay:\nOh, gotcha! Just leave it to me! I love the tense feeling of these moments when you're about to uncover something big!\nEdgeworth:\nI believe the feeling of freedom would be much more satisfying right about now.\nKay:\nAlright! I got the secret door open! And now...!\nEdgeworth:\nAck! Wait!\nKay:\nWha--!? Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nEdgeworth:\nAre you alright!? Kay!?\nKay:\nI'm fine. The ladder just slipped is all!\nEdgeworth:\n(Thank goodness she's alright. I about had a coronary...)\nKay:\nThere's a lot of really large machinery down here.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about an exit?\nKay:\nUmm... It's really dark and cramped down there, so I really doubt there's an exit. Argh, I can't believe that happened!\nEdgeworth:\nYou have only yourself to blame for leaping before you looked, you know.\nKay:\nNo way! I mean, how was I supposed to know that the ladder is removable (Underground ladder - It looks as though it can be easily removed, but is it really safe to use...?)!?\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen hatch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I finally got the door to the underground area open...) Kay, I just want to confirm with you that there wasn't an exit down there.\nKay:\nYeah, it was really cramped, and there was a lot of really large machinery.\nEdgeworth:\nI see. Are you hurt at all?\nKay:\nI'm perfectly fine! I was just a little surprised when the ladder suddenly slipped out from under me...\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder if this ladder can be put to some use...)\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Lockers\" and \"Underground ladder\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay.\"\nEdgeworth:\nI've figured out how we will escape this prison, Kay.\nKay:\nOh? So, how are we going to bust out?\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems that your reckless actions were of use after all.\nKay:\n...Are you actually praising me?\nEdgeworth:\nMore of a \"thank you\" for giving me an idea regarding this ladder.\nKay:\nThe underground ladder? What about it?\nEdgeworth:\nThis ladder isn't just for those who wish to go down...\nKay:\nOh! I see! If we use this...!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I believe it's long enough to reach the top of those lockers.\nKay:\nWell, then what are we waiting for!?\nInvestigation Complete\nKay:\nAlright! Now we can get out of here!\nEdgeworth:\nYes... We spent entirely too much time in here. (Kidnappers who held me hostage, and a mysterious Interpol agent... This case is only getting started, and I'll be the one to bring it to a resounding end!)\nMarch 13, 12:11 PM\nWild, Wild West Area\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like it's stopped raining for now.\nKay:\nYeah, and thank goodness! You have no idea how hard it was raining earlier!\n???:\nMr. Edgeworth! I'm so glad to see you managed to escape, sir! I was so stressed that I thought my heart was gonna give out!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe, may I ask what in the world that is?\nGumshoe:\nWell, that's... um...\nMIB:\nCount off!\n1! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8!\n98! 99!\nMIB:\nShifu! All 99 members are here and accounted for, sir!\n???:\nHeh... What the heck do you think you're doing counting my cubs off like that!? Every person is a valuable human being, you get me? And everyone has a name that their parents gave to them. No one is a 2 or a 3... Everyone, regardless of age or rank, is number 1! Got it!?\nShifu! Shifu!\nEdgeworth:\n...You are Agent Lang, I take it?\nMIB:\nYou infidel! How dare you address our Shifu so rudely!?\nLang:\nGrr! Lang Zi says: \"A cub who disrespects others soon feels the disciplinary bite of an elder.\" So don't you ever forget to show the proper respect towards another person! Shih-na. This isn't much, but please accept my card.\nEdgeworth:\nOh, thank you. ...Please, accept mine in return.\nLang:\nYou all see that just now!? That is the proper way for two people to show their respect! Keep that in mind and you'll get far in life, got it!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Ah, that's right... Franziska did warn me... Something about an elite Interpol Agent from the Republic of Zheng Fa. Apparently, this man has the highest successful arrest rate in the organization.) Agent Lang, why exactly is an Interpol agent involved with this clearly domestic case?\nLang:\nThat's none of your business, Mr. Prosecutor.\nEdgeworth:\nHow is it not!?\nLang:\nI've heard a rumor or two about you. You solved a murder that occurred during your flight home recently, right? Hah! But you sure took a while just to arrest one little flight attendant. How pathetic.\nGumshoe:\nH-How dare you say that about Mr. Edgeworth!? Are you saying you could've solved it faster, pal!?\nLang:\nThe comedic relief jumps to the aid (changed from [aide] in the original release) of his master... How clichÃ©. Look, what I'm getting at is that if I had been there, no one would've died.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nLang:\nI would've solved the entire case and Agent Hicks would still be with us here today.\nEdgeworth:\n(Agent Lang knew yesterday's victim, Agent Akbey Hicks...?)\nLang:\nHicks was like a brother to me, so now, I'm out to take my revenge!\nEdgeworth:\n(Agent Hicks was investigating a smuggling ring with Franziska and a third person... This must be the man she was talking about.) In that case, you should understand how I feel, as the kidnapped is someone I know. So I ask that you please allow me to participate in the investigation...\nLang:\nLang:\nThis isn't your neatly trimmed Courtroom of Eden, you know. You're out in the wilderness now, Mr. Prosecutor, and way out of your league. No hard feelings, but why don't you go on back to your courtroom now, pretty boy?\nEdgeworth:\nYou...! You dare to mock the court!?\nLang:\nI do... And I don't need the help of a filthy \"prosecutor\". Sorry, but the truth doesn't need the likes of you to distort it today!\nEdgeworth:\n(Who uses the adjective \"filthy\" to describe a prosecutor...!? And why...? Why do I feel such intense loathing emanating from him!?)\nLang:\nAlright, men! Good job on the perimeter around Gatewater Land. Now just find me the kidnapper, and bring the punk to me! Dismissed!\nSir!\nLang:\nNow then, Mr. Prosecutor, you just sit tight here and don't cause any trouble, understand?\nEdgeworth:\nW-Wait!\nGumshoe:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nIt's been a while since I last met someone so disagreeable. (Why of all places did he show up here? And completely out of the blue at that! I suppose I'll have to ask Detective Gumshoe to fill me in on that.)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay Faraday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nMaaaan... I can't calmly do any stealing at all with that detective around.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose it's not easy when there's this many members of law enforcement in the vicinity.\nKay:\nIt's alright! It's not like I'm in a hurry to steal just any ol' thing!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Which is it? Do you plan to steal something or not? Quite the mystery, this one. Maybe I should talk with her a bit more.)\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext step\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nSo what are you going to do about your investigation into the kidnapping?\nEdgeworth:\nGood question. Since Agent Lang holds the authority to investigate this case now... ...this makes things a bit more complicated.\nKay:\nOh, come on, you can't let that stop you! I'll even lend you a hand, so let's go!\nEdgeworth:\nBut you're a self-purported \"Great Thief\", are you not? I don't believe I can let someone of an unlawful nature participate in an investigation.\nKay:\nYou don't like to listen, do you? I'm not just any ol' (changed from [ordinary] in the original release) Great Thief; I'm the Yatagarasu! And as I said earlier... ...the Yatagarasu is after one and only one thing.\n\n\n\n\n\"One and only one\" (appears after \"Next step\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this \"one and only one\" thing you're after?\nKay:\nThe Yatagarasu is only interested in one thing... ...and that is the truth.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... \n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt was seven years ago... There was a vigilante who threw the business world into a panic. Labeled \"mysterious\" and \"phantom-like\", the Yatagarasu appeared and vanished at will. Though we still don't know much about this thief's ultimate goal, we do know the targets. The Yatagarasu liked to find and publicly disclose (changed from [make public,] in the original release) evidence of corrupt dealings of all sorts. Once a target was chosen, no dramatic calling card or announcement was sent forth. Instead, the chosen corporation was infiltrated without even the target noticing. Some days later, the evidence that was found was sent out to the mass media... ...along with a card with the mark of a three-legged raven. Looking back, I suppose you could call what the Yatagarasu was stealing the \"truth\". (Could this child really be the successor to the original Yatagarasu? But that can't be... can it...?)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nIf I had one of these, I could be a prosecutor, too, right?\nEdgeworth:\nDon't even think of stealing this from me.\nKay:\nIf it's that important to you, then why don't you wear it on your lapel?\nEdgeworth:\n(Why should I have to label myself as a prosecutor everywhere I go? And why does everyone ask that question of me? That's what I'D like to know.)\n\n\n\n\nGatewater Land Pamphlet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nI really love theme parks! Too bad we're not here to have a fun time...\nEdgeworth:\nSo why did you choose this one, and why choose to show yourself to me of all people?\nKay:\nBecause I was tailing you, silly! Duh!\nEdgeworth:\nYou were following me!? (But why?)\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badger Bible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nIt's a book of information about my arch-enemy, the Blue Badger. But I won't lose to the likes of him! You just wait and see. I'm going to write a \"Tome of Thievery\"! How's that, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\n(...The information that winds up on your wanted poster will suffice in this competition.)\n\n\n\n\nBadger Photo Rally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nCome on! The Badger family is waiting for us to find and take pictures of them! And remember, you have to yell, \"Badger GET!\" each time, or it doesn't count!\nEdgeworth:\nThey even have a rule for when you take their pictures...?\nKay:\nTell me about it! I was planning to steal all of my shots, as any proper Great Thief should!\nEdgeworth:\n(Does the concept of stealing permeate every aspect of this girl's life...?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nWhat do you think about this?\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're going to steal anything, at least keep your hands off of my lines.\nKay:\nAlright, alright. I'll return it to you. Here you go!\nEdgeworth:\n(I was hoping for some information in return, but my line will do for now.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nGreat job, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nSir!\nEdgeworth:\nFor losing sight of me and the kidnapper, and allowing my investigation to be hijacked.\nGumshoe:\nI... Sir...!\nEdgeworth:\nI look forward to your next month's salary assessment.\nGumshoe:\nBut... But the case isn't lost yet, sir! I'm gonna show you just how much of a man Dick Gumshoe can be!\nEdgeworth:\nShall I prepare the 21-gun salute now or later?\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent Lang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, are you sure it was the precinct you called for backup?\nGumshoe:\nO-Of course, sir! I think I would know the number to my own precinct like back of my hand!\nEdgeworth:\nThen why did an Interpol agent show up instead, with an army of his own agents?\nGumshoe:\nThat, I have no idea... About five minutes after I made the call, that wolf-man showed up out of nowhere, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(Agent Lang definitely has an agenda, so the question is, \"What is he after?\")\n\n\n\n\nNext step (appears after \"Agent Lang\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth! I was wondering if I may ask about one thing, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, what is it?\nGumshoe:\nUm... Who is that? The girl over there, I mean.\nKay:\nI'm Mr. Edgeworth's assistant, Kay Faraday!\nGumshoe:\nWh-Whaaaaat!?\nEdgeworth:\nFunny, I don't recall making you my assistant, Kay...\nGumshoe:\nYeah! I'M Mr. Edgeworth's assistant! ME! It's been like that since... forever!\nKay:\nSorry, but I just stole your supporting role.\nGumshoe:\nHow can you say something so serious with that giant grin on your face, pal!? Mr. Edgeworth! We've got a thief on our hands, sir! She stole my role, sir! I'm taking her in, getting her convicted, and making sure she serves out her sentence!\nKay:\nOh, come on, it'll be fun! Like musical chairs! You'd better stay fast on your feet!\nGumshoe:\nNo way! I won't... I will not lose the spotlight to you, little girl!\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nIf you're going to show me your Prosecutor's Badge, then I'll show you my police badge!\nEdgeworth:\n...Your wallet is looking rather thin, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Oh, whoops. I must've left my badge at home. I always get the two mixed up. Ha ha.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not a laughing matter, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nGatewater Land Pamphlet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nGatewater Land... Who would have guessed this place would be such a success? But the Gatewater Group and I go way back, you know?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Same here. I handled two murder cases that took place at two of their hotels. And it was you who headed the investigation in each case.\nGumshoe:\nOh, I remember that, sir! I was 16 back then, standing in front of the hotel in the snow...\nEdgeworth:\n(...Clearly, we are not on the same page here.)\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badger Bible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nYou actually got a copy, Mr. Edgeworth!? Ooh! Can you show me the very last page!?\nEdgeworth:\nThe last page? Very well... Let's see here... ...Interesting. Why is your name listed here under \"Special Thanks\"?\nGumshoe:\nThat's it, sir! You found it! Oh... Um... That's because I did the choreography for the \"Dance, Dance, Blue Badger\" song!\nEdgeworth:\n(I suspect that no one entrusts him with any real responsibilities at work...)\n\n\n\n\nBadger Photo Rally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOh, are you participating in the photo rally, too, Mr. Edgeworth!? Um... I mean, I'm only doing it as part of my duties! Yeah.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see. In that case, keep up the good work. So, how many have you found so far?\nGumshoe:\nI've been sorta busy with the investigation, so I haven't really found any yet, but...\nEdgeworth:\n(Something tells me finding the Badgers isn't really a part of his duties.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry, sir! Absolutely nothing is coming to mind right now! As a man, the only thing I can attest to is this: \"To be a man, I, Dick Gumshoe, will tell no lie!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(His heart's in the right place... Now to work on his deduction skills.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me, but if you could just let me through here...\nOfficer:\nSorry, I can't let anyone through. Agent Lang's orders.\nEdgeworth:\nNnngh... (I suppose I'll have to deal with this impasse for now.)\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badger:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\n(That wriggling... I just can't bring myself to call it \"dancing\"...)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarrels on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI highly doubt I'll find a clue in here, but I might as well check, just to be sure. ...Mnngh. This barrel sure is heavy. You there! Do you know what's inside of this thing?\nOfficer:\nIt's the emergency water supply for putting out fires.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see. Well, they certainly are well prepared.\n\n\n\n\nHorizontal bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis horizontal bar is used... for tying up horses. Apparently, you can ride real horses at the Cowboy's Ranch area just up ahead. Is it possible that the culprits have already escaped with the help of a stolen horse or two?\nOfficer:\nUnder Agent Lang's orders, we already rounded up all the horses... ...and every last one has been accounted for.\nEdgeworth:\n(Agent Lang is good, although, I won't go so far as to say I'm impressed just yet...)\n\n\n\n\nRocking chair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's an old-fashioned rocking chair, the kind that makes you feel instantly at ease. There's something written here... \"A soothing 10-minute sitting for only $100\"...!? I see. Reverse psychology. Make it so expensive that no one would dare sit on it...\n\n\n\n\nBarrels by cactus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's an empty barrel. I'd venture to guess that its only purpose is to set the mood.\n\n\n\n\nCactus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a cactus... and there's something written here on this sign... \"This cactus is a very gracious gift to Gatewater Land from the local police precinct.\" (I can't believe the police went so far as to even donate a cactus to this place.)\n\n\n\n\nGarage door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHorses are painted on this garage door to complete the Wild West theme. They almost look like they're ready to jump out into the real world and gallop away. ...Almost, being the key word.\n\n\n\n\nTracks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSome sort of tracks were left in the mud here thanks to the rain. They look like tire tracks. Too bad they're destroying the Wild West atmosphere they worked so hard to create. (The tires on whatever made these probably got pretty muddy, as well.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options with Dick Gumshoe and Kay Faraday:\n???:\nLaaaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, son!?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Amano?\nErnest:\nOh! Miles, my boy! I'm sorry to involve you in such an affair just after you've returned.\nEdgeworth:\nFor you, Mr. Amano, I gladly offer my assistance. After all, I have you to thank for how well things turned out during my time abroad. If it wasn't [sic] for you, I might not have been introduced to that law office... ...and had the chance to study the inner workings of another country's judicial system.\nErnest:\nNo, no, no. Think nothing of it. As you know, Manfred and I go way back. I consider a beloved disciple of his to be like one of my own blood.\nEdgeworth:\n............\nErnest:\nIf you ever want to go overseas again, you need only to ask. I can use my company's vast network to send you anywhere at any time.\nKay:\nSo who's the old man?\nEdgeworth:\nHe is the father of the currently kidnapped Lance Amano, Ernest Amano.\nErnest:\nNow then, have you found Lance yet, Miles? Please... I miss my poor boy dearly!\nEdgeworth:\nI'm terribly sorry, but your son's whereabouts remain unknown, Mr. Amano.\nErnest:\nWh-- Hold on there! Then, what happened to all that money!?\nEdgeworth:\n.........I believe the $1 million has been stolen, and that the culprits are now on the run.\nErnest:\nWhaaaaat!?\nKay:\nPoor old man... Don't you have anything you could give him to cheer him up, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Forgive me, Mr. Amano...)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErnest Amano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kidnapping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering if you could please tell me the details of the kidnapping one more time?\nErnest:\nOh. It was yesterday... A call came to the house. From the receiver came the sound of my son... \"Help me, Daddy!\"... *sniff*\nEdgeworth:\nI know this is tough, but please stay with me here, Mr. Amano...\nErnest:\nYou don't understand. He hasn't called me \"Daddy\" in ages... It was incredibly moving... I wish I had recorded him saying that.\nEdgeworth:\n(He definitely should have recorded that conversation... ...but not for the foolish sentimentalities of an old man.)\n\n\n\n\nLance Amano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nRefresh my memory, what kind of person is Lance again?\nErnest:\nHow will telling you about Lance help you get him back?\nEdgeworth:\nSurprisingly, a lot can be deduced from a person's relationships and behavior.\nErnest:\nVery well, then. Lance is my one and only son, and he turned 21 this year. He is very much like me when I was his age -- kind and very attractive. I'm sure women simply can't keep their hands off of him.\nEdgeworth:\nIs there anything else about him you noticed of late?\nErnest:\nNow that you mention it, I haven't been able to get in contact with our butler, Oliver.\nEdgeworth:\nYour butler...?\nErnest:\nYes, his name is Oliver Deacon. He's been with our family for years now. He gets along so well with Lance, so I thought maybe he would know where my son is...\n\n\n\n\nOliver Deacon (appears after \"Lance Amano\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Amano, could you please tell me a little more about your butler, Mr. Deacon?\nErnest:\nAs a butler, he's outstanding. He even serves as Lance's personal private tutor. He took a brief leave recently, but even after it was over, I haven't been able to reach him.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you still haven't spoken with him since his leave? What about his family and friends?\nErnest:\nThey said they hadn't seen him. I've tried everything I could think of, Miles. ...Do you think this could have something to do with Lance's kidnapping?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's possible, but I can't say anything for sure quite yet. (So even the person closest to the victim has gone missing... Oliver Deacon... Sounds like one name I had better keep in mind.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErnest:\nAh... Seeing that badge reminds me of Manfred. Now, HE was one fine prosecutor, the best of the best.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, I can't disagree with you there.\nErnest:\nHmm... I sense that you don't really want to talk about him.\nEdgeworth:\nHow I feel about him... It's hard for me to be truthful about that with another person.\nErnest:\nYour hard countenance... I don't know what you're thinking or feeling... ...but mark my words, I think you are Manfred's true successor. I really do.\nEdgeworth:\n..................\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErnest:\nHo, ho! That looks to be something with quite a bit of value. But then, all things have some value attached to them. Only by probing deep into the unknown can we become true winners in this world, Miles.\nEdgeworth:\n(Thanks, but knowledge isn't what's going to make me a winner here; it's information.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options with Ernest Amano:\nEdgeworth:\n.................. Detective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nLet's begin our investigation. Even if that Interpol agent holds the authority to head this investigation... ...we can't allow ourselves to stand idly by, twiddling our thumbs.\nGumshoe:\nI'm with you 100%, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! I, Dick Gumshoe, pledge to stick by your side through thick and thin!\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Amano, it was my fault that the culprits escaped. Which is why, with your blessing, I vow to return Lance to you myself.\nErnest:\nOh! I've never seen you so passionate before, Miles. Good luck to you, my boy.\nKay:\nAlright! Well, what are you waiting for!? Let's do some investigating!\nGumshoe:\nIf you think I'm losing to you, pal, forget it!\nBegin Investigation\nWild, Wild West Area\nGumshoe:\nSo what should we examine first!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... Thanks to Agent Lang, we can't leave this area. But the culprits were here until only very recently. Which means we may be able to find some clues that will tell us how they escaped.\nGumshoe:\nOK! Let's get looking!\nDetective:\nHey! You there!\nGumshoe:\nWho, me!?\nDetective:\nWhat are you doing goofing off in a place like this!?\nGumshoe:\nI wasn't goofing off! I was about to help Mr. Edgeworth kick off his investigation.\nDetective:\nYou imbecile! All precinct detectives are now under Agent Lang's direct command!\nGumshoe:\nN-No way! I am NOT working for Wolf-boy! Mr. Edgeworth! Can't you do something...!?\nEdgeworth:\n.................. I'm not exactly in a position to argue, seeing as how you ARE a member of the police.\nDetective:\nGood, now let's go!\nGumshoe:\nNooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!\nDetective:\nBoy, have I got just the job for someone of your talents!\nKay:\nWell, that was exciting.\nEdgeworth:\n............ Kay.\nKay:\nWhat? Can't you tell I'm all ready to get down to some detective work!?\nEdgeworth:\nYou should go home. Your parents must be worried about you.\nKay:\nOh, come on! I finally get to be your assistant and you try to ditch me!?\nEdgeworth:\n...I don't recall offering you the position.\nKay:\nHmmmph. Why do you have to be so difficult? Besides, it's already too late, you know! Like I said, I've already stolen the position of \"assistant\" a while back!\nEdgeworth:\nHah. You're the only one asserting that.\nKay:\nWell! By the time anyone notices, it's already gone! That's the Yatagarasu way!\nEdgeworth:\nYou shouldn't speak so lightly of things you know nothing about!\nKay:\nFine, whatever, you win. Go ahead and do your little investigation. But the talented assistant Kay, is going to tag along no matter what you say!\nEdgeworth:\n(Even if she turns out to be useless, she's not going to listen to me. I might as well surrender and let her come along for the ride...)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badger:\n..................\nKay:\nHey! It's the Blue Badger! Badger GET!\nEdgeworth:\n(I really don't understand why she is so excited over this badger hunt. Speaking of Badgers, there's a person inside of there...) Mr. Badger, I wonder if you might share with me what you saw?\nBlue Badger:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\n(He's doing that contorted wriggling \"dance\" again...)\nKay:\n............ Aha!\n???:\nAaaah! You've uncovered my undercover identity, sir! I was to remain under that head, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n...Aren't you Officer Meekins?\nMeekins:\nSIR! Mike Meekins, reporting for duty, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(This man was a witness in one of the cases I headed two years ago. About the only thing I remember about this officer is that... ...he often spoke and acted before he thought, which gave me a great deal of headaches.)\nKay:\nIs he a friend of yours, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nI've met him in the courtroom once before. (Hmm... Why was he so upset when we unmasked him? Does he have something to hide?)\n\n\n\n\nMike Meekins (after talking to Blue Badger)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMike Meekins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nOfficer Meekins, why are you standing here wasting time?\nMeekins:\nSIR! Because I'm not a police officer right now, sir! I'm the Blue Badger! And I'm creating memories and dreams for the kids! That's never a waste of time, sir! I have a dream to become as big as Detective Gumshoe, sir! I was patrolling the scorchingly boring beat until a little while ago... ...when the dispatch radio on my shoulder crackled that the kidnappers had escaped, sir! I thought maybe this was my shot at making Detective, sir! I rushed on over to join in, but when I got here, there was a sea of people already... ...and I couldn't spread my trademark friendliness and joy on to anyone...\nEdgeworth:\n(It would seem that some people never change...)\n\n\n\n\nThe Blue Badger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo why exactly are you in that ridiculous outfit?\nMeekins:\nSir! That's because, sir! I'm here to keep the visitors in good spirits, sir! But it's also to hide the fact that I'm an officer on the trail of a kidnapper, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nI see. Agent Lang is very wise to employ this sort of diversionary tactics.\nMeekins:\nTo be handed the role of THE Blue Badger out of all the different disguises, sir... It's... It's such an honor!\n\n\n\n\nAny clues? (appears after \"The Blue Badger\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHow long have you been standing here, Officer?\nMeekins:\nSIR! For about one little hour, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... That's around the time I woke up from being knocked unconscious...)\nMeekins:\nAnd I've been here even since, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(If that's true, then it's possible Officer Meekins saw the kidnappers escaping!)\nMeekins:\nB-B-B-However, sir! I must tell you I didn't see a thiiiiiiing, sir!!!\nEdgeworth:\nI haven't asked you anything yet, Officer.\nMeekins:\nNo no no no no! B-But I know you will, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(He's hiding something from me.) Officer Meekins, I insist that you tell me more about your recent movements!\nMeekins:\nSir! I've been playing the Blue Badger this whole time, sir! And getting into it, too! I patrolled the park, all while wearing this costume! And about one hour ago, I came over here, sir! I haven't seen any suspicious-looking people this whole time, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat you said just now is contradictory to the facts.\nKay:\nHow so, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is what Officer Meekins's testimony contradicts!\n\n\n\nPresent Badger Photo Rally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Officer Meekins, let's back things up. I'd like to ask you about your last statement.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour testimony contradicts this piece of evidence!\nMeekins:\nI'm just a little patrolman, so I don't understand what you're talking about, sir!\nKay:\nI can't say I get it, either.\nEdgeworth:\n(Gnnnrk! This isn't what I was looking for!) I'm sorry, Officer, but could you please repeat what you said one more time?\nMeekins:\nOf course, sir! I'd be honored to repeat myself as many times as needed, sir! For almost a whole little hour, I didn't see any suspicious-looking people around, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger!\nEdgeworth:\nAs I thought, what you said just now is contradictory to the facts.\nKay:\nOK, so what exactly is so contradictory, Mr. Edgeworth?\nLeads back to:\n\"This is what Officer Meekins's testimony contradicts!\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nOfficer Meekins, let's back things up. I'd like to ask you about your last statement.\nMeekins:\nSir! Of course, sir! If that's your wish, Mr. Prosecutor! This little patrolman will wait as long as I am commanded to wait!\nEdgeworth:\nYou said that you saw a Blue Badger, correct? And yet, if you take a look at this, what you saw was not supposed to happen. This park is supposed to have only one of each Badger in it at any given time. Which means that as long as you are the Blue Badger, Officer Meekins... ...you should not have seen another Blue Badger wandering the premises!\nMeekins:\nWh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!? SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!?\nKay:\nThen, that would mean that there are two Blue Badgers (A 2nd Blue Badger - There's only supposed to be 1 Blue Badger in the park, but a second was spotted.) walking around! But why!?\n\n\n\n\nAny clues? (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHow long have you been standing here, Officer?\nMeekins:\nSIR! For about one little hour, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... That's around the time I woke up from being knocked unconscious...)\nMeekins:\nAnd I've been here even since, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(If that's true, then it's possible Officer Meekins saw the kidnappers escaping!)\nMeekins:\nYup, I've been hanging around in this area ever since then, sir! But! I did see a Badger, sir! A lone Blue Badger!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd yet, if you take a look at this, what you saw was not supposed to happen. This park is supposed to have only one of each Badger in it at any given time. Which means that as long as you are the Blue Badger, Officer Meekins... ...you should not have seen another Blue Badger wandering the premises!\nMeekins:\nWh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!? SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR!?\nKay:\nBut then, that would mean that there are two Blue Badgers walking around the park!\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeekins:\nSir! It's so incredibly shiny, but it has a really ugly shape! I knew it! I was right to go for the much more manly police badge, sir! But I lose it alot [sic], and I just know I'm going to lose it for real one of these days, sir!\nKay:\n...Mr. Edgeworth, I think this cop is one donut short of a baker's dozen.\nEdgeworth:\nI know. Believe me, I know.\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badger Bible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeekins:\nSir! You have a copy of the Blue Badger Bible, too, sir!? That was written by experts on the Badger family, sir! And it's very, very thorough! It doesn't matter that I was made the Blue Badger only a little while ago, sir! That book helped me memorize every name of every Badger, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(It's not that hard to remember four incredibly obvious names...)\n\n\n\n\nBadger Photo Rally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeekins:\nDrip, drop, little by little our privacy is being sold off to the public through this, sir! But that means I need to work extra hard on my cute poses!\nKay:\nOoh, like what?\nMeekins:\nLike thiiiiiiiiiiis!\nKay:\nGreat! Now I know what your new pose will beeeeeeeeeee! Look, sir! I've successfully stolen his pose and speaking styyyyyyyyyyyyyle, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n*sigh* That's nice, Kay.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeekins:\nSir! I'm undercover as the Blue Badger now, sir! I must pretend to not know anything about anything, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(I mustn't respond to that. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErnest Amano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent Stolen Costumes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErnest:\nJust what sort of operation is this, that they would allow their valuables to be stolen!? It's a disgrace to the way businesses are run everywhere!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, thieves, by nature. generally tend to target these types.\nErnest:\nStealing is an abominable behavior, don't you agree, little miss!?\nKay:\n...Y-Yeah, the worst!\nEdgeworth:\n(Am I going to have to add \"hypocrite\" to the list of things you are, missy?)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarrels on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nHah! I've got you now, you vile criminals!\nEdgeworth:\n...I'd think the kidnappers would have better sense than to try hiding in these.\nKay:\nOh, come on! Lighten up, will ya? I was only joking! I don't REALLY think that the criminals would be hiding here, right in front of two officers!\nEdgeworth:\n...I-I certainly hope not.\n\n\n\n\nFootprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nHey! There's a bunch of footprints in the mud over here!\nEdgeworth:\nI remember hearing rain fall out here while I was being held in there.\nKay:\nYup, it was just a passing rain. That's why the ground has already pretty much dried up.\nEdgeworth:\nI should be thankful. It left us with some nice footprint samples.\nKay:\nYou know what? I bet if we followed them, we can find out where the kidnappers went! Plus, we'd be able to spot them because of their muddy shoes!\nEdgeworth:\n...I don't think it will be that easy.\nKay:\nWhy not?\nEdgeworth:\nLook carefully. There are quite a few different sets here. And we don't know which ones belong to the kidnappers.\nKay:\nOh, that's true... We don't know what kind of shoes (What kind of shoes? - If only we knew, we'd be able to track the kidnappers from the footprints.) they were wearing.\n\n\n\n\nHorizontal bar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nHey, Mr. Edgeworth, isn't this one of those things you tie horses to?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, although the horses are in another location at the moment.\nKay:\nAww... And here I was hoping I would get to ride one.\nEdgeworth:\nYou know how to ride a horse?\nKay:\nNope! Never rode one in my life! But I have an Asian friend who was born in the year of the horse!\nEdgeworth:\n(\"Non sequitur\" is the only way to describe your logic...)\n\n\n\n\nBarrels by cactus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nIf these were real, I wonder what you'd put in them.\nEdgeworth:\nWater would be the obvious answer...\nKay:\nBut if you stored water in a barrel under the blazing hot sun, wouldn't it go bad?\nEdgeworth:\nPeople of that period probably didn't care about how it tasted.\nKay:\nSorry, but I can't let you get away with making fun of our forefathers! I mean, maybe they really liked the strange taste!\nEdgeworth:\n...Look who's making fun of them now.\n\n\n\n\nCactus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nLook! There's a blurb about the cactus here! \"This cactus is a very gracious gift to Gatewater Land from the local police precinct.\"\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't believe the police went so far as to even donate a cactus to this place.)\nKay:\nSo, is the police department running a cactus farm on the side? Ha ha, just kidding! They wouldn't do something so silly!\nEdgeworth:\n(Actually, I have the vague impression I've seen a cactus farm at the precinct before.)\n\n\n\n\nGarage door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHorses are painted on this garage door to complete the Wild West theme.\nKay:\nThey look so life-like, don't you think!?\nEdgeworth:\nAre you thinking of wrangling, or rather, stealing them?\nKay:\nIf you can coax them out of there, sure! Come on, I know you can sweet-talk them out!\nEdgeworth:\nI could be holding a cube of sugar in my hand and they wouldn't budge, Kay.\n\n\n\n\nTracks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a set of tire tracks originating from the garage.\nKay:\nAha! So that means a car left from the garage at some time, right?\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect. But for the car to leave these tracks... ...it would mean that it left during the passing rain. (That's the only explanation as to why these tracks are made of mud.) Hmm, three treads... I think we can also safely assume it's a special type of car.\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Costumes\" and \"A 2nd Blue Badger\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA second Blue Badger that shouldn't exist... Clearly, the true identity of the person underneath is...\nKay:\nOh, I know! It's one of the kidnappers, right!? The person wore a costume to get away (Costumed escape - The identity of the second Blue Badger was probably the kidnapper in disguise.)!\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. After all, the costumes that went missing from the storage area are...\nKay:\n...A Blue Badger, a Proto Badger, and a Bad Badger.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, those three.\nKay:\nSo there are three phony Badgers running around in the park somewhere, huh!\nStolen Costumes data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"What kind of shoes?\" and \"Costumed escape\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Now that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes...\"\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nYes?\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kidnapping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nKay, what do you think about the kidnapping?\nKay:\nWell, I don't know anything about the victim... ...so actually, I was hoping you could tell me.\nEdgeworth:\nAh, that's right. I never did explain the situation to you. I got involved because of a phone call I received. It was from none other than the director of the Amano Group, Mr. Ernest Amano. His only son, Lance, had been kidnapped, and he wanted me to be the drop-off man. Little did I suspect that I would be abducted myself.\nKay:\nAnd that's when I found you tied to a pole screaming, \"Nnnnnggghhhhoooooooooooh!!\"\nEdgeworth:\nCan you please drop that already!?\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nIf I had one of these, I could be a prosecutor, too, right?\nEdgeworth:\nDon't even think of stealing this from me.\nKay:\nIf it's that important to you, then why don't you wear it on your lapel?\nEdgeworth:\n(I suppose I can't really tell her... ...that no one in the Prosecutor's Office wears their badges. But why does everyone ask that question of me? That's what I'D like to know.)\n\n\n\n\nStolen Costumes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nLooks like there's another thief afoot!\nEdgeworth:\nOnly if we assume that this is not your handiwork.\nKay:\nAre you kidding!? You know that the Blue Badger is enemy number one to me! Can you imagine me ever being on good terms with that thing!?\nEdgeworth:\n.................. Actually, it's surprisingly easy.\nEdgeworth:\nNow that we know that the kidnappers were wearing Badger costumes... ...those footprints from earlier take on a new, and very significant meaning.\nKay:\nOh, you mean now we know which tracks belong to the kidnappers, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. More than shoe prints, we need to follow the paw prints of Badgers.\nKay:\nOK, Mr. Edgeworth! It's time to use those footprints and go Badger hunting!\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume...\"\nKay:\nHmm... So we're looking for footprints made by a costume... Hey! I think I found them! There are two sets here!\nEdgeworth:\nThey both do look like possible candidates.\nKay:\nThis set is walking off to the west... Argh! It just stops! I can't make heads or tails of where it's headed from here!\nEdgeworth:\nI think we can assume it's headed towards the stadium...\nKay:\nHmm... I wonder where the other set leads? This one seems to be headed east... Huh? Quick, Mr. Edgeworth! I've got him! I got one of the culprits!\nMeekins:\nAaaah! Nooooo! I'm not a kidnapper, sir!!!\nEdgeworth:\nDown, Kay. Clearly, those footprints belong to Officer Meekins. But our criminals were each wearing a costume.\nKay:\nAha! Maybe they came over to this garage for something?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's what I would suppose. Officer Meekins, if you could step aside for a moment. We need to examine the garage.\nMeekins:\nSIR! Roger Wilco, sir!\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarage door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let's open this shutter and see what we find.\"\n\n\n\n\nFootprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere are two sets of prints that could be from the kidnappers...\nKay:\nOne set is headed off to the west...\nEdgeworth:\nTo the stadium, I would suppose...\nKay:\nAnd the other set heads to the east...\nEdgeworth:\nWe should follow these prints to their conclusion and investigate the garage.\nKay:\nOK!\nEdgeworth:\nLet's open this shutter and see what we find.\nKay:\nMaybe we'll find the kidnappers hiding inside!\nKay:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What in the--!? (We seem to have stumbled across a dead body...)\nKay:\n............\nEdgeworth:\n(She must be in severe shock to have been the first to find it... Now then, who is this man?)\nErnest:\nI-It's Oliver!\nEdgeworth:\n! Mr. Amano, are you saying that this man is...\nErnest:\nYes... He's my butler... How could something like this have happened!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Indeed. And why was Mr. Deacon here to begin with? I'd better investigate this crime scene quickly, before Agent Lang or his men return. The kidnapper's footprints lead right to this garage... ...and right to a dead body. Is it possible one of the kidnappers is now a murder victim (Victim was kidnapper? - Following a kidnapper's prints led us to a body. Was the victim in a costume?)...?) From my cursory examination, I believe this man died of a fatal bullet wound.\nPreliminary Findings data jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay:\nYou sure are calm for someone who just found a body.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's surprising what one can become accustomed to in the span of two days...)\nLeads to examination of body\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErnest Amano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Amano... This body...\nErnest:\nYes... That's my butler, Oliver... How could something like this have happened!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Indeed. And why was Mr. Deacon here to begin with?)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootprints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere are two sets of prints that could be from the kidnappers...\nKay:\nOne set is headed off to the west...\nEdgeworth:\nTo the stadium, I would suppose...\nKay:\nAnd the other set heads to the east...\nEdgeworth:\n...Right to the garage. (Do these prints belong to the victim we found inside the garage?)\n\n\n\n\nRocking chair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nOoh, did you know? I really love this kind of chair, the way it rocks back and forth! When I grow old, I plan to sit in one of these and rock the day away every day! But you don't have to wait, Mr. Edgeworth! You're at just the right age for one!\nEdgeworth:\n(Do I really project myself as someone of that age?)\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badgermobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat a peculiar car...\nKay:\nYeah. From the look of it, it must be the Blue Badgermobile. And it has three tires... So maybe it left those tire tracks behind!?\nEdgeworth:\n*sigh* That's simply not possible.\nKay:\nHuh? Why?\nEdgeworth:\nTake a look at the tires. There's no mud stuck to them. Therefore, it must have been here since before it started to rain.\nKay:\nOh, gotcha! Good eye!\nEdgeworth:\n(It's a shame I don't see any other clues around...)\n\n\n\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPendant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(This is an unusually-shaped pendant...)\nKay:\nWhat is it? Is it something valuable?\nEdgeworth:\n(She seems to have regained some of her composure...)\nKay:\nIt looks like a horse pendant! It's got an antique feel about it, and it's really pretty... Hold on... This is made of platinum silver! Nice! It IS worth something after all! Ooh, and look! There's something written on the back. \"Colin Devorae\"... It's a name.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Colin Devorae\"...? (But this man's name is...)\n\n\n\n\nWounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(As long as that Interpol agent has control of this case... ...I'm not going to be able to have a real autopsy done on the victim. I'm no doctor, but let's see what I can piece together myself.) Hmm, there are two gunshot wounds one in his abdomen and one in his shoulder.\nKay:\nSo that means he was shot twice...?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, I don't think so. I think the abdominal one is an entry wound, and the one near his shoulder is the exit wound.\nKay:\nNice! I knew you could figure it out!\nEdgeworth:\nIt comes with experience, and I've seen my share of crime scenes. (Speaking of experience... ...this crime scene seems a bit too clean for a murder where the bullet went clean through. I should make a note of this oddity.)\nPreliminary Findings data updated in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nWounds (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, there are two gunshot wounds one in his abdomen and one in his shoulder.\nKay:\nSo that means he was shot twice...?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, I don't think so.

The victim is the Amano family butler, and his name is \"Oliver Deacon\". But the name on the pendant is \"Colin Devorae\".\nKay:\nI wonder what's up with that?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know, but... ...I think we've hit upon an important piece of information.\nMr. Deacon's Pendant data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis piece of evidence alone solves this whole case!\nKay:\nReally!? You think so!? Because to be honest, I don't really see how it solves anything... You must be confused jumping from a kidnapping to a murder. Yeah, that's it!\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh! I can't believe I made such a large blunder... ...that even this little girl could point it out!)\nLeads back to examination of body\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Deacon's Pendant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the victim's pendant, which is shaped like a horse.\nKay:\nIt's got a real dignified look on its face. That makes it worth all the more...Â ! Oh no, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat? Did you find an important piece of evidence?\nKay:\nThis... is made of platinum silver! That makes this thing super-valuable! I've seen this type of jewelry at a lot of stores before, so I know it when I see it!\nEdgeworth:\n............Kay, if you ever laid so much as a finger on those pieces of jewelry...\nKay:\nWh-What? Me? I-I'd never do something like that!\nEdgeworth:\n(......Is it possible that she has never wanted to steal from a jewelry store before?)\n\n\n\n\nName on back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe name \"Colin Devorae\" is engraved here.\nKay:\nI really admire people who carve their own names into a pendant.\nEdgeworth:\nOh? And why would that be?\nKay:\nYou have no imagination, Mr. Edgeworth. Did you ever think that maybe people want to have their loved ones always nearby?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's not as if I have a wedding band, and I have no interest in accessorizing.\nKay:\n*sigh* I suppose. Anyway, you know what? More than wearing flashy accessories... ...I'd rather be engraving my name into every treasure I can find all around the world!\nEdgeworth:\n(A sign of affection is one thing, but blatant vandalizing is just a bit different.)\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt appears that this case has taken a turn for the unexpected.\nKay:\nI'll say! I was shocked to open that shutter and find a dead body inside!\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose most people would be, since the average person rarely runs across a corpse.\nKay:\nWait! You just compared me to a \"normal person\", didn't you!? I'll have you know that I'm...\nEdgeworth:\nSorry. I suppose I should have recognized that you're a... thief, correct?\nKay:\nNo! I'm a GREAT Thief! And a GREAT Thief is not surprised by anything! Got it!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Apparently, with GREAT thievery comes GREAT loss of short-term memory.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Deacon's Pendant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThis horse is really pretty...\nEdgeworth:\nDon't even think about it.\nKay:\nOK, I'll just hold onto it then! Don't worry, it's safe with me!\nEdgeworth:\n(Just so we're clear, Kay, a five-finger discount is not part of the bargain.)\nAfter examining wounds and correctly deducing pendant:\nInvestigation Complete\n???:\nLaaaaaance! Laaaaaaaaaance! Where are you, sweetie!?\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me, but you are...?\n???:\n*ba-dump*\nEdgeworth:\n?\n???:\nOh, this is bad... He's really good looking! Ack! Stop it, Lauren! You can't let yourself fall for a playboy like him! You're in love with...\nKay:\nSounds like someone doesn't know the meaning of the phrase \"inner monologue\", huh?\nEdgeworth:\nSorry to interrupt your... conversation, but might you be a friend of Lance?\n???:\nYes, I'm Lance's girlfriend... My name is Lauren Paups.\nEdgeworth:\nHis girlfriend...?\nPaups:\nOh, it's not like that! We're more like friends... and, um... We're not lovers or anything! We! Well, we haven't gotten that far yet! But... I guess that's how people are going to see it, so I should just accept it... I even got this ring as a present from Lance... *swoon*\nKay:\nHa ha, you know what she reminds of? A cartoon character!\nEdgeworth:\nN...Nnnnrrrghn... May I inquire as to why you are here?\nPaups:\nI haven't been able to get in contact with Lance lately... ...and I began to get really worried. *sob* I looked everywhere for him, and then I heard about the kidnapping, so I came here.\nKay:\nWow, you're really strong for having made it through all this by yourself!\nPaups:\nUm! Is it true!? Has Lance really been kidnapped!?\nEdgeworth:\n...No one is supposed to know, but yes, it's true.\nPaups:\nOh, Lance...! I can't believe you've been spirited away... I wonder how you're doing right now...\nKay:\nLooks like she's gone back to the \"fair maiden in love\" routine... So, Mr. Edgeworth, where do we go from here?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, we found a body, so we should look into the murder...\n???:\nLang:\nMy men brought me up to speed over the radio. And I have to say, you really should've called. I heard you found something very intriguing.\nEdgeworth:\nI have nothing to hide, Agent Lang. It's exactly what you see before you.\nLang:\nI'll take it from here. Yeah, that guy's really dead. Hey! You waiting for an invitation? Hurry up and detain the suspect, now.\nEdgeworth:\n(Suspect? Who...?)\nLang:\nOfficer Meekins, is it? You're coming with us.\nMeekins:\nWhat!? SIR! I had nothing to do with it, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang! Don't you think you're being a bit rash!? Do you even have a good reason to suspect Officer Meekins!?\nLang:\nHah, I leave that kind of stuff to you prosecutors. It's your job, after all. Like I said earlier, the crime scene isn't as forgiving as your precious courtroom.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's your answer!?\nLang:\nI know you like your logic and reasoning... ...but that sort of impractical fluff is not needed out here in the field.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nLang:\nAll you have to do is arrest suspicious person after suspicious person. That's how you eliminate crime from the streets!\nEdgeworth:\nBut that's also precisely how you unnecessarily arrest innocent people by mistake!\nLang:\n\"Innocent people\"? Nonsense! There's no such thing as an innocent person. We've all got a blemish or two in our hearts.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's tyranny! I won't allow such a thing to go on unchecked before my eyes!\nLang:\nHeh! Too bad you don't call the shots around here!\nEdgeworth:\nAs I have sworn to uphold the laws of this land, I cannot allow you to take this man in. That you would arrest a man on false charges without even conducting an investigation... ...have you no honor as a member of law enforcement!?\nMIB:\nYou! How dare you speak so disrespectfully to our Shifu!?\nLang:\nHold it! .................. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! You amuse me, Mr. Prosecutor. Lang Zi says: \"Every pack has its own rules.\" If you can play by their rules and come out on top, that is a true victory. Alright, I'll give your beloved laws a fair shake. I'll show you just how much investigating I've done... ...through my line of logic!\nArgument\n-- Shi-Long Lang's Logic --\nLang:\nI've seen a lot of bodies like the one being carted off in my time.\nI can say he was shot in a single glance, but even you figured that much out, right?\nWith your current gun laws, it's not exactly easy to get your hands on a gun.\nNot unless you're a member of law enforcement like Officer Meekins, isn't that right?\nEdgeworth:\nThat is your reasoning...?\nLang:\nSolid as a rock! It's based on the philosophy of detainment!\nKay:\nUm... What's this \"philosophy of detainment\"?\nLang:\nHah! You don't know!? In that case, pay attention, girlie. In my country, the criminals have a saying: \"Beware of the wolf.\"\nEdgeworth:\nWhy the wolf...?\nLang:\nBecause in my language, \"lang\" means \"wolf\", and you don't mess with me or my pack. And as for the detainment philosophy, its father is my honorable ancestor, Lang Zi.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... You'd think I'd have heard of him and his teachings if he is [sic] that famous...)\nLang:\nLang Zi developed it as he worked to lock criminals away thousands of years ago. To this day, the Zheng Fa police still trains its recruits using his philosophies.\nKay:\nBut \"thousands of years ago\"? That makes your story about as believable as a fairy tale!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Anything wears down and breaks over time. Do you really believe something as ancient as that can be applied to today's world?\nLang:\n......You want to put it to a test?\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So what can you tell me about the body? Lang: A lot. Even without an autopsy, I have my eyes. They teach you the basics of forensics along with the detention philosophy. Edgeworth: Oh? Then you wouldn't mind telling me a little of what you've figured out, correct?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Yes, I think anyone who saw the bullet wounds would come to the same conclusion. Lang: Lang: Heh, don't pat yourself on the back yet! Edgeworth: What's that supposed to mean? Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Search where the water is deepest.\" You have to keep your eyes on the big fish that lurks in the depths, which is the killer. Edgeworth: Is that right? And what would you know about the killer?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: It would appear you've studied a little of our laws. Lang: Studied? Who needs to study what every child on any street corner already knows? It's that... that......... Shih-na! Shih-na: The \"Federal Firearms Restriction Act\". Lang: That's it. The Federal Firearms Restriction Act. I hear it's not easy to get a gun these days. Edgeworth: (Interesting. That woman is the one in charge of keeping track of the information.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: If that's the case, there are plenty of other officers who might be potential suspects. You're not seriously going to arrest each and every one of them, are you? Lang: As if I would need to! I've already looked into everyone else here. Edgeworth: Oh? Lang: Other than Officer Meekins. I know no one else's weapon has been fired. Edgeworth: ! H-How did you check every single person's weapon in such a short span of time!? Lang: That's because each and every one of my subordinates is extremely capable. It didn't take more than a few minutes to conduct the entire investigation! Edgeworth: (The power of sheer numbers...) But you have yet to check Officer Meekins's weapon, correct? Lang: Thanks for reminding me. Hey, you! Show me your gun. Meekins: ..................Oh! Edgeworth: (What's wrong...? Why does he look so sickly pale all of a sudden?) Meekins: ............Gun! Lang: What did you say? I can't hear you. Stop mumbling and spit it out already! Meekins: Sir, sir... I LOST MY GUN, SIIIIIIIIIIR!!! Edgeworth: How could you be so irresponsible!? Lang: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! In the end, it looks like you're still the only suspect we've got. You're the one who waited here outside this garage to ambush and kill the victim! Edgeworth: (So you think that Officer Meekins waited here to kill the victim, do you, Lang? I think this little accusation deserves a lot more scrutiny.) Add statement \"Officer Meekins ambushed the victim in this garage and killed him here with his gun!\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you are implying that the murder weapon in this case is a policeman's service revolver? Lang: I don't know for sure just yet, but it's entirely possible. After all, Officer Meekins did just admit that he \"lost his gun\". Ha ha ha ha! You'd think he could come up with a better lie than that!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean to tell me that the murder occurred here, in this garage? Lang: From the fact that the suspect was found almost next to where the body was found... ...I'd say that it's pretty obvious that this is the crime scene. Lang Zi says: \"A criminal always returns to the scene of the crime.\" Kay: Hey! Finally, a quote even I've heard of before! Lang: Furthermore, Lang Zi says: \"Successful investigations are the result of multiple returns to a crime scene.\" Edgeworth: (Looks like neither detectives nor criminals have changed their ways over the millenniums.)\nEdgeworth: (So this is the kind of conclusion the philosophy of detainment can lead you to...)\nKay: I don't get it, Mr. Edgeworth. Why are you putting yourself on the line for Mr. Meekins?\nEdgeworth: It's not that I particularly care about what happens to Officer Meekins.\nKay: Whaaaaat!?\nEdgeworth: However, I can't simply stand by while Agent Lang ignores our country's laws.

Roger, sir!\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Alright then, where were you assigned to? Meekins: I-I was assigned to the main gate, sir! Edgeworth: (He must mean the area with the bridge and the outrageous fountain.) Kay: OK, then why are you here in the Wild, Wild West area? Meekins: That's because! It's because of a very deep reason, ma'am!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Describe for me how you conducted your investigation. Meekins: Yes, sir! Well! First, I made sure there were no suspicious-looking people in the area, sir! But! The only people that seemed to gather around me... ...were little girls, sir! Kay: Well, what did you expect when you're dressed like the Blue Badger? Meekins: I thought I had no choice at that point, sir, so...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: What exactly do you mean by \"selling dreams\"? Meekins: SIR! The Blue Badgermobile is where dreams are collected! Kay: Um, what? Meekins: Sweetness like you've never known except in dreams, ma'am, like \"Innocence Drops\". And bitterness found only in nightmares, ma'am, like \"Guilty Jawbreakers\". Selling those as I pushed the Blue Badgermobile along is my sworn duty, ma'am!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You completely forgot to look for the kidnappers? Meekins: NO, SIR! OF COURSE NOT, SIR! I! I would never do something like that, sir! Edgeworth: .................. Meekins: ..................Umm... You're absolutely riiiiiiiight! Kay: Wow, you're good at this forcing-people-to-confess thing, Mr. Edgeworth! Meekins: To be frank, I'm just a little man, sir... I'm better at selling kids a few small dreams than looking for a big crook, sir! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Enough wallowing in your own self-pity. Let's return to your testimony. Meekins: Yes, sir!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: How did you wind up all the way over here? Meekins: I was in the middle of a sea of kids, sir... But one of the kids decided to challenge me to a fight, sir! I had to run away from the child's painful dropkicks, and before I knew it... Kay: Ha ha, the good ol' dropkick! I dished out my fair share of those when I was a kid! It was always the best when you felt one really connect with your opponent! Edgeworth: In any case, you wound up here for a reason completely unrelated to the investigation? Meekins: SIR! That's right, sir! Edgeworth: ...That's not something you should be admitting to with your head held high, Officer.\nEdgeworth: (It sounds like he simply forgot about his real job and became the Blue Badger... However, there is one flaw in Officer Meekins's story. But I have the feeling that he'll need some prodding before he'll spill the beans.)",

But that's when you found me, Mr. Edgeworth! Sir!\nLang:\nLang:\nA likely story!

But I think we can assume the car was used alright. To move the dead body!\nMeekins:\nWh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nLang:\nYou killed the victim at some distant location, Officer Meekins.

If you don't... ...I'll arrest you for obstruction of justice.\nTo be continued\nMarch 13, 1:22 PM\nGatewater Land Main Gate\nEdgeworth:\nNnngh... Chased out like a pair of peasants.\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, Kay?\nKay:\nThere's something even thieves should never steal. Do you know what that is?\nEdgeworth:\nYou really shouldn't steal anything, however, I'll bite. What shouldn't a thief steal?\nKay:\nA life. It's too heavy of a burden on your soul to get away with, ever.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's something we can agree on. Well said, Kay. No matter what we may try, murder is the one crime that can never truly be hidden. And I intend to prove that by my own hands... ...when I apprehend the murderer myself.\nKay:\nAlright! And I'm going to work extra hard to be a good assistant! Let's go!\nEdgeworth:\n(I still never said she could be my assistant... *sigh* I'm just going to drop the issue.) The first thing we should do is locate the real scene of the murder.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe!\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth! The stadium! Hurry, sir! This is supposed to be hush-hush, but they found a witness at the stadium!\nEdgeworth:\nA witness!?\nDetective:\nYou! What did we tell you about leaving your assigned post!?\nGumshoe:\nAaah! The jig is up! Mr. Edgeworth! Remember that I'm always rooting for you, so go get 'em, sir!\nKay:\nThose detectives sure look like they're enjoying themselves!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's not all fun and games, Kay. Now then, let's head to the stadium and meet this witness.\nMarch 13, 1:42 PM\nStadium\nEdgeworth:\nI thought there was a witness here...\nKay:\nYeah, I don't see anyone...\n???:\nMr. Edgeworth! Long time no see!\nEdgeworth:\nYou are... Ms. Ema Skye, correct? (This girl is the younger sister of my former superior, Lana Skye. Two years ago, we stood in the same courtroom together as witness and prosecutor. But I thought she had gone to Europe to study forensics...)\nEma:\nI can't believe you remember me, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nOf course I do. How have you been? You look to be in good spirits. Are you still studying abroad?\nEma:\nYou bet! More than anything, I want to investigate crime scenes, scientifically! I've been studying non-stop every day to become a top-notch forensic scientist! But it's spring break now, so I thought I'd come back for a bit.\nEdgeworth:\nI see.\nApproach right side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nWhere are you going, Mr. Edgeworth!? We have to find the witness before that mean ol' werewolf does!\nEdgeworth:\nYou're right. The witness is supposed to be here in this stadium, but where?\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma Skye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI almost didn't recognize you. You've really grown in these past few years.\nEma:\nPlease don't tease me, Mr. Edgeworth! I know I still have a long way to go. But I'm going to be a super forensic scientist someday! You'll see!\nKay:\nYou seem to know Mr. Edgeworth really well. Are you two acquaintances?\nEma:\nOh! I forgot to introduce myself! I'm Ema Skye. Nice to meet you! I'm studying abroad now to be a forensic scientist! How about you?\nKay:\nWow, that's a great dream! My name's Kay Faraday! And I'm training to become an unstoppable Great Thief!\nEma:\nA-A Great Thief...?\nEdgeworth:\n...Don't think too hard on it, Ema. It's not worth the trouble. In any case, we have much to catch up on.\nEma:\nYou bet we do!\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma Skye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo, why are you here, Ema?\nEma:\nWell, I just happened to decide to come back home for spring break... ...and then I heard that you'd come back, too, so I raced on over here! I had really wanted to welcome you back at the airport, but I had just missed you.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd how exactly did you know I was here?\nEma:\nThrough the power of science, naturally! Never underestimate what science can do for you! I used these to track your footprints, and I followed them straight to you! This set is the greatest! It's so wonderfully scientific! You spray this chemical on the ground, and when you shine the special light on it... ...Zing! The footprints light up like an electrified noble gas in a glass tube! It's almost like magic, scientifically speaking!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Forensic science has never seemed more ominous to me than at this very moment.)\n\n\n\n\nThe witness (appears after \"Ema Skye\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nEma, I'd like to ask you about what you witnessed...\nEma:\nHuh? What are you talking about?\nEdgeworth:\nAre you not the witness Detective Gumshoe told us about?\nEma:\nWell, I did get a call from Detective Gumshoe earlier. He was practically yelling at me! \"Mr. Edgeworth needs your scientific doohickeys right now, pal!\" he said.\nEdgeworth:\n(What was that man thinking? ...Or rather, not thinking?)\nEma:\nSo let me guess, there's been a murder, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Unfortunately. (There's a sudden glint in her eyes... But I need to keep my mind focused on the witness. Now, where did that person go?)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nThis is the symbol of a prosecutor, right? But I don't think I've ever seen you wear it, though.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I'm not as enthusiastic about wearing it as you are with your pin badges.\nEma:\nI know, right!? I mean, I really wanted to put even more on today, actually (changed from [a few more on today] in the original release)! Oh, hey! I like yours, Kay! Do you have any extras?\nKay:\nSorry, but there's only one of these in the world, and it's proof that I am a Great Thief!\n\n\n\n\nGatewater Land Pamphlet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nNow, if I calculate this out scientifically using my time scheduler... Aha! I can definitely see all of the attractions before the park closes!\nKay:\nScience sure is useful, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm not even going to bother asking Ema how she calculated that...)\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badger Bible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nSeeing the Blue Badger sure brings back memories...\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Indeed.\nEma:\nI remember it like it was yesterday! That was really something, huh -- the red-hot courtroom battle between the two of us!\nEdgeworth:\n(I don't think it was quite as dramatic as that...)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nScientifically calculating and thinking critically about this... ...then putting it in a way that transmits the feeling that I understand... Whew! Done!\nKay:\nShe makes it sound like she knows what she's talking about, but she really has no idea.\nEdgeworth:\nAdmittedly, I am slightly confused by what she just rattled off...\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPink Badgermobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI assume this is another Badgermobile?\nKay:\nYeah, but it's a different color than the Blue Badger's car.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, this is the retina-searing pink model.\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice anything?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou look deep in thought. Care to share, Kay?\nKay:\nWith all that's happened, I'm getting a little confused. Umm... For example, what that detective said earlier...\nEdgeworth:\nAbout how we must look for the witness at the stadium...?\nKay:\nNo, not that. The \"I'm always rooting for you\" bit. I was thinking how sweet that is! It's like you two are best friends!\nEdgeworth:\nI think you're a little confused alright, Kay.\nAfter clearing all Talk options with Ema Skye and examining Pink Badgermobile:\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? What's that off in the distance...?)\nKay:\nOh, hey! It's the Pink Badger! Badger GET!\nEdgeworth:\n(Badger, badger, badger, badger... Just what does she see in these silly things?) ..................\nKay:\nI think this Badger has something to say to you, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nAre you, by chance, the witness I've been searching for? (Sorry, but I don't speak Badger Dance.)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPink Badger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"..................\"\nPink Badger:\n..................\n???:\nAaaargh! I can't take bring inside that stuffy head anymore!\nEdgeworth:\nY-You're--!!! (Nooooo! Why HER!? Why HERE!? Why NOW!? I first met this woman three years ago. She was a witness in one of my cases. She has since gone out of her way to pop up unexpectedly, and cause me great grief--)\n???:\nEdgey-pooooooooooo! Why couldn't you understand what I was trying to tell you!? I mean, really! I was trying so hard to keep the kids' dreams alive by staying in character! But you couldn't pick up on what I was trying to convey to you! I'm sick and tired of that roundabout way of talking, so I'm going to just be direct!\nEdgeworth:\n(I had a bad feeling before, but this just made it official. Today has gone beyond the typical \"not my day\" into the realm of \"waking nightmare\"!)\nKay:\nSo you're a friend of Mr. Edgeworth, too, Ms. Pink Badger?\n???:\nYou could say that. But right now, I'm just the Pink Badger, dearie.\nEdgeworth:\n(She may look the part, but I know better than to trust my eyes around this woman...)\nOldbag:\nMy name is Wendy Oldbag. But you can call me \"Wendy\", or \"Granny\", or whatever suits your fancy.\nKay:\nNice to meet you, Ms. Oldbag! I'm Kay Faraday.\nOldbag:\nHmph! What do I care about young whippersnapper like you!?\nKay:\nYeesh, I was just trying to be polite...\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWendy Oldbag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWendy Oldbag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWeren't you a security guard at one of the Gatewater hotels the last time we met?\nOldbag:\nHmph! I go where I'm needed! I'm very good at what I do, unlike the youth of today! I get called in all the time to fill in when there aren't enough hands. But enough about me, Edgey-poo! I'm thoroughly dejected right now! I finally get the chance to see you again, and here you are, talking with two young girls! Men are all the same! It doesn't matter how old they get, they continue to shamelessly flirt with young girls! Why, just the other day, it happened with my Yun, who I had finally gotten to notice me. He went and got into an arranged marriage with an 18-year-old (changed from [a 16-year-old] in the original release)! I don't see what he sees in her at all! As they say, the permission takes three years to ripen! That girl\nKay:\nYou seem to attract all sorts of interesting people, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nKay, please, I'm begging you. By all means, do not provoke her any further...\n\n\n\n\nThe witness (appears after \"Wendy Oldbag\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Aren't you forgetting about something, Mr. Edgeworth? This person could be the witness!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badger Bible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldbag:\nIt's like a line-up of ugly thugs.\nEdgeworth:\n...You cut to the quick.\nOldbag:\nOnly behind the scenes. I'm the Pink Badger right now to the kids. But don't you think I'd be even more lovable if I kept this headpiece off?\nEdgeworth:\nThink of the children! You're the one who wants to keep their sweet dreams alive, right!?\n\n\n\n\nBad Badger's Head\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldbag:\nYet another Blue Badger? I've had my fill of these things for a lifetime!\nEdgeworth:\nThank you for the extra commentary, but all I wanted was for you to take a look...\nOldbag:\nOh, alright. I guess I can do that... But only because it's you, Edgey-poo! .................. What is wrong with this thing!? Why is this Blue Badger wearing sunglasses!?\nEdgeworth:\n(...How could she have not noticed all this time?)\n\n\n\n\nBadger Photo Rally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldbag:\nThanks to this, people have been taking my picture all day. It's like I'm one of the mascot characters of this park.\nEdgeworth:\nIt's not \"like\"; you ARE the mascot character. Well, one of them, anyway.\nOldbag:\nBut you have no idea how hard it is to be one. You're not allowed to talk at all! Taking away my ability to talk halves my effectiveness as a human being!\nKay:\nYou have a hard time not talking? But it seems like such an easy thing to do!\nOldbag:\nWhat do you know, young'un!? Just wait until you're my age and then we'll see!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is it possible this loud, old lady was once a quiet, fair maiden? ...Hah, impossible.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldbag:\nGo on, Edgey-poo! Show me anything, and I'll tell you all about it!\nEdgeworth:\nVery well. What do you think about this?\nOldbag:\n...It's nothing special.\nEdgeworth:\n(Somehow, I figured she'd say as much.)\nKay:\nAren't you forgetting about something, Mr. Edgeworth? This person could be the witness!\nEdgeworth:\n(Honestly, I hope she isn't, but I don't think fate is going to be so kind today...)\nOldbag:\nI saw what happened! I even saw the exact moment it happened! How's that!?\nKay:\nSo it's true! She is the witness!\nEdgeworth:\n(*sigh* I don't suppose I can afford to ignore the old bag...)\nOldbag:\nYes, it was just a little while ago! I saw it happen right in front of me! The moment of the murder!\nEdgeworth:\nYou mean to say that you witnessed someone being killed right before your eyes?\nKay:\nSounds like a pretty important piece of testimony to me!\nTestimony\n-- What Oldbag Witnessed --\nOldbag:\nI came to this stadium to take a short break.\nAs I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area.\nSuddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground.\nIt was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you!\nKay:\nLooks like we hit the jackpot, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I can't afford to ignore what she has to say. ...Unfortunately.\nOldbag:\nWhat's that \"unfortunately\" you tacked on at the end supposed to mean, Edgey-poo!?\nKay:\nWell, anyway! Let's see what we can find out from this little ol' lady!\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean you took a break from being the Pink Badger? Oldbag: You may not think it, but it's hard work keeping kids' dreams alive. You smell of sweat, your hip creaks with pain -- you even begin to dream about work. Kay: That's the kind of story that would scar a child for life, you know... Oldbag: Well, that's why I chose to come take my break here, whippersnapper! I don't plan on playing the part of the Dead Badger in front of a bunch of kids! Edgeworth: So what did you see while you, the Pink Badger, were resting? Oldbag: Oh, yes, that! Well!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You saw two men...? Can you describe them for me? Oldbag: They looked like your average Joes, completely uninteresting and not worth fawning over. I'm telling you, they were so boring that I don't even remember much beyond that. Edgeworth: But did they have any special features? Anything you can recall would be very helpful. Oldbag: Oh, my! Don't tell me you're jealous of those two men! Kay: Hey, she's right. You do seem pretty worked-up over them, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: I-I'm not worked up over anyone! A-And I'm not jealous! Oldbag: It's alright, Edgey-poo. Those two were just foals compared to a stallion like you. I thought so little of them that I lost interest the instant I laid eyes on them.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You're claiming to have seen the exact moment in which the murder took place? Oldbag: Absolutely! That gun made a terrible racket when it was fired. Kay: You didn't try to go help the person that got shot? Oldbag: I'm only one person, you smart-alecky brat! What could I have done!? But I took off as soon as I could to find someone who could help.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: .................. Oldbag: .................. Well, don't you have anything to say to me!? Edgeworth: No, not especially. Oldbag: You're so cold, Edgey-poo. But... that is exactly what I like about you. Kay: You sure are one tough cookie! One part unshakable, and one part scary... Oldbag: Watch that smart mouth of yours, missy! What do you know about my fragile heart!?\nEdgeworth: (I can tell this is an important piece of testimony, but she's rather vague in a few spots. *sigh* I suppose this means I'm going to have to talk with her some more...)",

You smell of sweat, your hip creaks with pain -- you even begin to dream about work.\nKay:\nThat's the kind of story that would scar a child for life, you know...\nOldbag:\nWell, that's why I chose to come take my break here, whippersnapper! I don't plan on playing the part of the Dead Badger in front of a bunch of kids!\nEdgeworth:\nSo what did you see while you, the Pink Badger, were resting?\nOldbag:\nOh, yes, that! Well!\nOldbag:\nAs I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou saw two men...? Can you describe them for me?\nOldbag:\nThey looked like your average Joes, completely uninteresting and not worth fawning over. I'm telling you, they were so boring that I don't even remember much beyond that.\nEdgeworth:\nBut did they have any special features? Anything you can recall would be very helpful.\nOldbag:\nOh, my! Don't tell me you're jealous of those two men!\nKay:\nHey, she's right. You do seem pretty worked-up over them, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nI-I'm not worked up over anyone! A-And I'm not jealous!\nOldbag:\nIt's alright, Edgey-poo. Those two were just foals compared to a stallion like you. I thought so little of them that I lost interest the instant I laid eyes on them.\nOldbag:\nSuddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're claiming to have seen the exact moment in which the murder took place?\nOldbag:\nAbsolutely! That gun made a terrible racket when it was fired.\nKay:\nYou didn't try to go help the person that got shot?\nOldbag:\nI'm only one person, you smart-alecky brat! What could I have done!? But I took off as soon as I could to find someone who could help.\nOldbag:\nIt was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you!\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nOldbag:\n.................. Well, don't you have anything to say to me!?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, not especially.\nOldbag:\nYou're so cold, Edgey-poo. But... that is exactly what I like about you.\nKay:\nYou sure are one tough cookie! One part unshakable, and one part scary...\nOldbag:\nWatch that smart mouth of yours, missy! What do you know about my fragile heart!?\nEdgeworth:\n(I can tell this is an important piece of testimony, but she's rather vague in a few spots. *sigh* I suppose this means I'm going to have to talk with her some more...)\nAfter pressing second and third statements:\nEdgeworth:\n(Two men, one bullet... It's all consistent with what we found out from the body.) Sadly, there wasn't exactly a lot of new information to go on in your testimony...\nOldbag:\nWell, if I saw the guy again, I'm sure I could identify him for you! I mean, how do you expect me to remember anything without something to jog my memory!?\nKay:\nSelf-centered, aren't we?\nEdgeworth:\nWhile it was somewhat useful, her testimony also presents us with a new problem...\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nYes?\nKay:\nSo, about this new problem...\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is that giant grin on your face for?\nKay:\nDo you want me to show you something really nice?\nEdgeworth:\n...No, thank you.\nKay:\nDon't be so mean! I swear it's something you're going to like!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is that gadget you're holding?\nKay:\nWhat you see before you is the secret weapon of a Great Thief!\nEdgeworth:\n...Ahh, I should have known it would be worthless.\nKay:\nAww, don't be like that! Tee hee. *ahem!* What do you think now!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it doing...? It's projecting something into the air...\nKay:\nI'm going to input the necessary information to run the simulation now. Once I'm done, I'll increase the size of the projection to its maximum size... Dark skies of evening, when no other bird dares take wing, one alone remains all-seeing! Now, witness the true power of a real, modern-day Robin Hood!\nRe-creation\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What is this!?\nKay:\nThis is a re-creation of the murder based on the info I inputted into Little Thief!\nEdgeworth:\nL-Little Thief? I dare say I think you're taking the Robin Hood thing a bit too far...\nKay:\nLittle Thief is actually meant to be a simulator for me to plan my thefts. But I suppose if I used it like this... Let's see... Ms. Oldbag said that the two men were facing each other. And then, a gunshot rang out, and the victim fell to the ground...\nEdgeworth:\nAh... So with this, we can inspect the crime scene as it was in the past.\nKay:\nSee! So, what do you think?\nEdgeworth:\nI have to say, I'm impressed by the technology thieves have access to these days.\nKay:\nWell, it IS the super-secret weapon of the mighty Yatagarasu!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed.\nKay:\nOh, but if there isn't enough information, or if something is out of place... ...the re-creation could come out a little strange.\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, I can use this to authenticate the validity of a witness's testimony?\nKay:\nYou got it! You really catch on quick, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Right now, this simulation is a re-creation of that witness's testimony... So for now, I should re-examine everything... ...and if I find anything illogical or strange, I can then ask for clarification.)\nKay:\nFeel free to examine anything in this simulation in the way you always do! You can even present evidence when you find a contradiction! And if you find something, I've got Little Thief with me, so you just let me know, OK?\nBegin Investigation\nStadium\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma Skye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nThis is amazing! Just FEEL the power of science!\n\n\n\n\nWendy Oldbag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldbag:\nWhat is this? Some sort of new attraction?\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"According to the testimony, the victim fell to the ground here...\"\n\n\n\n\nStage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like they broke the stage down (Stage was packed up - The stage I saw this morning in the center of this stadium has been packed away.).\nKay:\nI guess this means they're done for the day...\nEdgeworth:\nOr maybe it's because a different show is scheduled to start its run tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\nKiller\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(It's the silhouette of the killer with his gun at the ready.) Kay, is it not possible to re-create the face of the killer?\nKay:\nWell, I can't exactly input what we don't know into Little Thief.\nEdgeworth:\n(She has a point...)\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRe-creation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you believe that this gadget will provide us with the proof we need?\nKay:\nYeah, of course! Pretty neat, huh? By inputting info like this, it can re-create the crime scene exactly as it was. Although, Little Thief was originally intended to be a training sim for heists...\nEdgeworth:\nA training sim for thievery!? I don't believe I can turn a deaf ear to that, Kay.\nKay:\nBah, it's for practice! Practice! It's not like I've actually stolen anything yet! Besides, we're in the middle of an investigation! So stop nit-picking!\nEdgeworth:\nEven if it is just \"practice\", I can't exactly endorse the act of stealing. Although, admittedly, this device is rather useful in an investigation.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Little Thief (appears after \"Re-creation\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo, how am I supposed to use this to aid my investigation...?\nKay:\nOh! That's right! I guess I should explain how to use it, huh? Objects outlined in yellow are things that are not present in our time, but were in the past. Things outlined in a dotted line are things that exist now, but didn't in the past.\nEdgeworth:\nI see...\nKay:\nYou can examine and interact with replicated people and objects as you normally do. You can even present evidence whenever you find an inconsistency. Oh, and be sure to point out mistakes in the re-creation with evidence, too!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... Very well, let's continue with the investigation.\nKay:\nIf there's something you don't get about Little Thief, feel free to ask anytime, OK?\nEdgeworth:\nAccording to the testimony, the victim fell to the ground here...\nKay:\nThat's right. But...?\nEdgeworth:\nBut, if that's the case, then we've already found our first contradiction.\nKay:\nHuh? What? Where!?\nEdgeworth:\nIf this is the real scene of the crime, there's something missing that should be here. Which piece of evidence shows the missing item?\nPresent Mr. Deacon's Murder Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is the contradiction!\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nKay:\n.................. Maybe you're still adjusting to the simulation...?\nEdgeworth:\n...Y-Yes, that's it. Allow me to find my bearings, and I'll present the contradiction again. (Maybe I need to review the evidence again. It should go without saying that the truth lies in what is missing from this scene!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Which piece of evidence shows the missing item?\"\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the contradiction!\nKay:\nEh? Is something wrong with my re-creation?\nEdgeworth:\nIf this is the real scene of the crime, something specific should be here. If you think back, how did we deduce that the other crime scene was not the real one?\nKay:\nOh! I get what's missing now! There's no blood on the ground here either, right?\nEdgeworth:\nRight. The fact that there is no blood here casts doubt on the witness's testimony.\nOldbag:\nEdgey-poooooooo! How can you doubt me like that!? Are you calling me a liar!? I know what I saw! And I saw the victim get shot down!\nKay:\nYou know, I don't think she's lying, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(To be honest, I can't think of a reason why she would lie to me. In that case, maybe there is another explanation for the distinct lack of blood (Why is there no blood? - Why is there no blood around the victim's prone body?).)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Now I'm fairly convinced that the victim was killed here. But then why is there no blood? There must be some explanation for this contradiction! Perhaps I should go over all of the information I've gathered one more time...)\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Victim was kidnapper?\" and \"Why is there no blood?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Is it not possible that the victim was wearing a costume?\"\nEdgeworth:\nIs it not possible that the victim was wearing a costume?\nKay:\nSo you really think that Mr. Deacon was one of the kidnappers?\nEdgeworth:\nI think we can reasonably assume there is a very good chance that he was. And that if he was [sic] shot while he was inside one of those stolen costumes...\nKay:\n...Then Mr. Deacon's blood would be inside the costume instead of on the ground!\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. Now, if only we could prove that the victim was wearing a costume...\nKay:\nYou'd think it'd be pretty easy if we could find some footprints... ...but the problem is FINDING them, since there doesn't seem to be any around.\nEdgeworth:\n(Footprints, huh...? I wonder how we can go about finding some of those...?)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma Skye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootprint analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ema, about that method you were talking about for finding footprints...\"\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Was the victim really wearing a costume? Maybe we can find out if we did some footprint analysis forensics...)\nEdgeworth:\nEma, about that method you were talking about for finding footprints...\nEma:\nAh, finally my expert knowledge in forensics is needed!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, well... Can you detect and trace even partial footprints?\nEma:\nLeave it to me! My cutting-edge detection kit can find anything!\nEdgeworth:\nVery well. If you could please analyze the footprints in this area...\nEma:\nOK! Stand back now, and witness the power of science at work!\nEma:\nHey! I found something! Look, right here!\nEdgeworth:\n? I don't see anything...\nEma:\nOh, that's right! Here, put these special glasses on, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n! These footprints here were definitely left by a Badger costume!\nEma:\nJudging by the way the prints are layered, those seem to be the newest.\nEdgeworth:\n(Then... we can conclude that the victim was definitely wearing a costume at the time.)\nVictim's Costume data jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay:\nOK! In that case, I'll update Little Thief's simulation parameters! I can't wait to see what we find out from this new info!\nRe-creation\nInvestigation Complete\nEdgeworth:\nSo the victim was wearing a costume when he died.\nKay:\nAnd with that, we should be one step closer to the truth, right?\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... I see the re-creation has changed in accordance with the new information.) We may be closer, but now, something else has caught my attention.\nOldbag:\nWhat do you want?\nEdgeworth:\nYour testimony, naturally. I'd like to hear it one more time, if you please.\nTestimony\n-- What Oldbag Witnessed --\nOldbag:\nI came to this stadium to take a short break.\nAs I was resting, I happened to glance over and I saw two men facing each other in that area.\nSuddenly, there was a loud gunshot, and the person who was shot fell to the ground.\nIt was a very terrifying experience, let me tell you!\nKay:\nSo! Does this mean that Ms. Oldbag's testimony has a contradiction in it?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, and I believe our best course of action is to compare it with your re-creation.\nKay:\nSee! I just KNEW Little Thief would be of help! Now let's see if we can pull more info from Ms. Oldbag to put into the re-creation!\nEdgeworth:\nFor that, we must first find the contradiction in her testimony.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean you took a break from being the Pink Badger? Oldbag: You may not think it, but it's hard work keeping kids' dreams alive. You smell of sweat, your hip creaks with pain -- you even begin to dream about work. Kay: That's the kind of story that would scar a child for life, you know... Oldbag: Well, that's why I chose to come take my break here, whippersnapper! I don't plan on playing the part of the Dead Badger in front of a bunch of kids! Edgeworth: So what did you see while you, the Pink Badger, were resting? Oldbag: Oh, yes, that!

What do you know about my fragile heart!?\nEdgeworth: Knowing what we know now, thanks to your re-creation...\nKay: ...The contradiction stands out like a giant sore thumb!\nEdgeworth: Precisely.

It's so high up!\nEdgeworth:\nWere you able to see even the victim's costume from way up there?\nOldbag:\nWell, I know I saw two people. But I couldn't really see what they looked like because they were in the stage's shadow (In the shadow of the stage - It was hard to make out the killer and victim that Oldbag saw in the stage's shadow.). My eyesight isn't what it used to be, you know. Not like when I was young. Ah, people used to call me \"Eagle-Eyed Wendy\" back then! could spot a good man from 100 paces away as I walked down the street, just like that! Of course, they also noticed me in a flash and tried to make their move. But I'm not that easy! I was a careful girl with a judgmental eye! But I never let a good man slip me by, you bet I didn't!

Big boys like me don't need silly toys, little girl.\nKay:\n*sigh*\nLang:\nNow THIS is a re-creation.\nEdgeworth:\nSo what? Do you still intend to assert that Officer Meekins is the killer?\nLang:\nOf course. Even knowing that the crime took place here doesn't let him off the hook.\nArgument\n-- Agent Lang's Logic --\nLang:\nThis is the real scene of the crime.\nOfficer Meekins lay in wait for the victim on top of the stage.\nAnd when the victim finally showed, he shot him from on high!\nThat's the truth your little re-creation showed.\nEdgeworth:\nHow far will you go to accuse Officer Meekins of the crime...?\nLang:\nHe's the most likely suspect we've got, especially given the situation with his gun.\nKay:\nWell, even if he is the killer, at least my re-creation was on the mark.\nLang:\nYou see? Thank you for understanding, my little crow-girl.\nKay:\nGrr... I'm not some common crow! I'm the Yatagarasu! The raven of legend!\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, your conclusion has yet to be tested, so let's see how well it holds up.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Looks like we found the real crime scene first. Lang: Ha! Brag all you want, but we don't have all that free time, unlike the two of you. Kay: Heh heh. You know what you remind me of? A dog licking his wounds as he whimpers home! Lang: Well, I guess I should be thankful for all the time you saved me. Xie xie. That's how we say \"thanks\" in my country. Edgeworth: Y-You're welcome. (I hope he realizes we didn't do all of this for him...) Lang: But I'm here now, so I'll be taking over! As I was saying, this is where the crime took place.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Lying in wait? How did Officer Meekins even know the victim was going to come here? Lang: Simple. He was investigating the kidnappers, right? And while he was doing so, he came to understand the victim, Mr. Deacon's movements. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hah! And why would the good officer want to ambush and kill a kidnapper? Lang: Lang: You mean his motive? Who knows, and who cares. You can find that out for yourself when you talk to him in jail. Edgeworth: Hmph. You have no respect for the order of law. Lang: Don't get me wrong, but I need more than \"There's no motive!\" to convince me otherwise. Edgeworth: (He's right. The lack of a motive is a rather weak argument by itself.) Lang: So, the officer lay in wait on top of the stage...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you agree with how our re-creation turned out...? Lang: Like I said, I'm grateful that you were able to save me some time. Edgeworth: Alright, but we still don't know why he chose to wait on top of the stage. Lang: Who cares. Maybe he wanted to become the Blue Badger. Who's to say he didn't see the stage and decided to put on a Badger stage show of his own? Edgeworth: (Or maybe there's a completely different reason...?) Lang: What does it matter!? It still doesn't change the fact that Officer Meekins... ...stood up on that stage and shot the victim on the ground below.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you honestly believe that what you're saying is what really occurred? Lang: Hey, you're the ones who came up with this scenario. Are you saying you doubt yourselves? Edgeworth: Nnngh... TouchÃ©...\nEdgeworth: Unfortunately, Agent Lang's conclusions do not contradict with our re-creation.\nKay: Hmm... Then, does that mean it all went down just as he says?\nEdgeworth: No, not quite. (I wonder if what we had re-created earlier was the whole truth?)",

(I wonder if what we had re-created earlier was the whole truth?)\nEdgeworth:\nI'm terribly sorry, Agent Lang.\nLang:\n?\nEdgeworth:\nI should have you warned you that our re-creation is incomplete. You cut in quite unexpectedly, after all.\nLang:\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\nEdgeworth:\nYou said that the victim was shot by the killer from up above, correct? I hate to break it to you, but that's not possible.\nKay:\nHuh? Why not?\nEdgeworth:\nRecall Mr. Deacon's body, specifically, where the gunshot wounds were located.\nKay:\n.................. Actually, I didn't get that good of a look.\nEdgeworth:\nOh. Well then. The bullet entered Mr. Deacon in his abdominal region, and exited his right shoulder. This is more consistent with an angled shot from beneath the victim.\nLang:\nKngh!\nKay:\nThen...!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, our re-creation had the victim being shot at an angle from above.\nKay:\nA clear contradiction!\nLang:\nYou're discounting your own conclusions!?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, this one point is the only flaw. This was the mistaken parameter in our re-creation:\nThe stage's location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right. The location of the stage was wrong.\nKay:\nYou mean the stage was in a totally different spot than where it is now?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, the stage was situated where the victim was standing in our simulation.\nLang:\nHah! Are you out of your mind, Mr. Prosecutor!? I've never heard of a stage show where the stage actually blocks the audience's view!\nEdgeworth:\nI-I suppose not... But I swear I know the reason for the error!\nLeads back to:\n\"This was the mistaken parameter in our re-creation:\"\nThe witness's location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe location of the witness was our mistake.\nOldbag:\nEdgey-poo! How can you betray me like this!?\nEdgeworth:\nYour testimony was riddled with vague statements.\nLang:\nHey, now. I can't let you get away with bad-mouthing a very valuable witness! Besides, if you're saying that it was wrong for you to think she saw it from far away... ...then, perhaps she saw it from up close? That'd make her story even more trustworthy.\nEdgeworth:\nI-I didn't mean it that way...\nOldbag:\nEdgey-poo! You can do it! Hang in there!\nEdgeworth:\n(So the wrong parameter was not where the witness was... In that case...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"This was the mistaken parameter in our re-creation:\"\nThe killer's & victim's locations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Yes, the locations of the killer and the victim were wrong.\"\nEdgeworth:\nYes, the locations of the killer and the victim were wrong.\nLang:\nAh, I get it. I see what you're trying to say!\nEdgeworth:\nI believe the killer and the victim were standing opposite to what we initially thought. It was the victim who was on top of the stage as he was being shot by the killer!\nRe-creation\nEdgeworth:\nIf this is [sic] what happened, it'd also explain the positioning of the gunshot wounds.\nKay:\nBut then, what about the footprints?\nEdgeworth:\nSince footprints don't lie, we can assume then, that the killer also wore a costume.\nKay:\nOK! I'll try using that data instead!\nRe-creation\nEdgeworth:\nJudging by the fact that both the killer and the victim were wearing costumes... ...I'd say it was a killing between the two kidnappers. That would be the most natural conclusion. Wouldn't you agree, Agent Lang?\nLang:\nHmph. Well done, Mr. Prosecutor! But that alone doesn't clear Officer Meekins of the crime!\nArgument\n-- Another Bit of Proof --\nLang:\nI ask that you take another good look at the tire marks over there.\nThe three marks are indicative of the Blue Badgermobile.\nThat story Officer Meekins told about that shop on wheels getting stolen was just a lie.\nHe drove the Blue Badgermobile here and committed the murder.\nThen, he used the car to move the body to the garage in the Wild, Wild West Area.\nEdgeworth:\nYou believe he moved the body with the car?\nLang:\nThat's right. It was Officer Meekins himself who pointed us to the way he did it.\nEdgeworth:\n(The three-tired tread marks are very telling, however... ...is the Blue Badgermobile the only thing capable of creating such a pattern?)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: The tire marks...? Lang: Yes, the tire marks. The ones there behind the stage. They were hidden up until now by the various pieces of stage equipment. As for when they were made... Edgeworth: ...They must have been made after the rain had begun to fall, correct? Lang: Yes, and probably around the same time as when the killer's footprints were made. The tires on that Blue Badgermobile probably got pretty muddy because of that. I say it's the Blue Badgermobile because, well, that's pretty obvious, too.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Three tire marks... I have to agree that the Blue Badgermobile has three tires. Lang: Of course! The only thing in this park that could make those marks is that roving shop. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you forgetting that there are, in fact, three of them? You can't simply ignore the Pink and the Proto Badgermobiles, Agent Lang. Lang: Lang: Of course. I didn't say it couldn't be either of the other two... ...but I see no reason to drag them into this just to complicate things!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Of course, you have some sort of proof that it was all a lie, correct? Lang: Of course not. Kay: Well, that was blunt. Lang: But, suppose it is a lie. It would explain a lot of things. Like his movements and his whereabouts.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you still claim that the tire marks belonged to the Blue Badgermobile? Lang: It must have arrived on the scene after the ground had become wet with rain. Officer Meekins committed the murder.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Besides the Blue Badgermobile, there are other ways the body could've been moved. Lang: Lang: Recall what the Wild, Wild West Area looked like. Only the Blue Badgermobile and Mr. Deacon's body were in the garage. I'd say that's proof. Edgeworth: (I suppose if one were to look at that place, that would be the only logical conclusion. However, my experience tells me that the truth is usually not so easily found. Is there some sort of problem with Agent Lang's statement with regard to that scene?)\nKay: Looks like the only thing that car was selling was death, not dreams.\nEdgeworth: Only if what Agent Lang believes turns out to be true. (The three-tired tread marks are very telling, however... ...is the Blue Badgermobile the only thing capable of creating such a pattern?)",

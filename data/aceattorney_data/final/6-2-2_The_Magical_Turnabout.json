Shame on you, Mr. Reus!\nMr. Reus:\nNo!\nTrucy:\nUsing magic for evil!\nMr. Reus:\nRrrrgh?! Nnnrrooogh!\nApril 27, 10:00 AMPenrose Theater - Stage\nTrucy:\nAnd that's how the evil magician, Mr. Reus, was defeated!\nMr. Reus:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!\nTrucy:\nSee you for Act Two, everybody!\nAthena:\nBrava! Brava, Trucy! Wow, Apollo! Wasn't that a great trick?!\nApollo:\nYou bet! I've never seen such a great magic act!\nAthena:\nDid you know they even featured Trucy's show on TV this morning?! \"Penrose Theater. A well-known gateway to success for entertainers! It's here at this famous theater that we'll finally get to see... ...Trucy Wright's... 'Trucy in Gramarye-Land'! The long-awaited revival of the magic of Troupe Gramarye!\"\nApollo:\nWow! That explains why there's a TV crew here to cover the show!\nAthena:\nThis is the perfect opportunity to promote the Wright Anything Agency, too! After all, people look up things they see on TV, right?\nApollo:\nBut wouldn't they be looking up the talent part, and not the law part of our agency?\nAthena:\nMamma mia! You're right! We'd get nothing but requests from Trucy's fans, wouldn't we?\nApollo:\nOh, well. Guess we'll just have to make it the old-fashioned way. My name is Apollo Justice. I'm a rookie lawyer with only about two years of experience under my belt. We're here to see Trucy's magic show. She's a fellow member of our agency. We came on behalf of our boss, Mr. Wright, who's away on a trip.\nAthena:\nOoh, and did you hear, Apollo? Even though it's only her debut, her shows are completely sold out!\nApollo:\nWhat? Really!? (That's amazing!)\nAthena:\nVoil\u00e0! A star is born! Who knows HOW far she'll go? At this rate, nothing in the world can stop us! Wahhh ha ha ha!\nApollo:\nUh, you do realize this has nothing to do with you, right? This is Athena Cykes. She's another member of our agency. She may not look it, but at just nineteen years old, she's a lawyer as well.\nAthena:\nWhat do you mean, \"She may not look it\"...? Of course I look the part!\nApollo:\n...Care to explain how, exactly?\nAthena:\nAww c'mon, have a heart...\nWidget:\nStop treating me like a child!\nApollo:\nThat gadget around Athena's neck that spoke just now? That's Widget. Widget helps Athena out with her special field of expertise: analytical psychology. He also has a habit of blurting out whatever Athena's really thinking.\nAthena:\nYeah, this little guy can be a little unruly at times.\nWidget:\nHey, upgrade me already!\n*buzzzzzzz*\nYour attention, please. The show will restart after a twenty-minute intermission. We ask that you please be back in your seats before the next act. Thank you.\nApollo:\nHey, why don't we go say hi to Trucy in her dressing room during the break?\nAthena:\nOoh, yes! Let's go see the big star! I'm so nervous! What should I say to her?!\nApollo:\nUm, whatever you usually say to her at the office every day...?\nApril 27Penrose Theater - Dressing Room\nApollo:\nSo this is Trucy's dressing room... Looks like she's busy over there with someone.\nStaff:\nCould you sign this, please, ma'am?\nTrucy:\nSure thing! Just the one sheet in this clipboard, right?\nAthena:\nA fan asking for Trucy's autograph, maybe?\nApollo:\nI don't think so. It looks like some kind of contract.\nStaff:\nThank you very much. I'll get this to the producer right away.\nTrucy:\nGreat. Thanks! ...Oh! Polly! Athena! You came!\nAthena:\nOf course! Congratulations on your big debut!\nTrucy:\nHee hee! Thanks!\nApollo:\nWho was that just now, by the way?\nTrucy:\nSomebody from Take-2 TV. They want to turn my magic show into a TV special! They're planning to broadcast it nationwide! Hee hee! Can you imagine?!\nApollo:\nWow. You really ARE a big star!\nAthena:\nHey, can I get your autograph later, Trucy?\nTrucy:\nSure! My signature's in high demand today! Would you like one, too, Polly?\nApollo:\n(............Yeah, actually, I would...)\nTrucy:\nOops! Looks like I ran out of flyers, so I'll have to sign your forehead instead!\nApollo:\nH-Hey! Knock it off! Look, just forget about the autograph! This is Trucy Wright. She's a magician, and Mr. Wright's adopted daughter. She's becoming quite renowned in the magic world these days for her impressive skills.\nTrucy:\nA lot of people get this wrong, but... ...Apollo's actual job is being my magic assistant!\nApollo:\nNo, YOU'RE the one who gets it wrong!\nAthena:\nOoh, think you can do that trick you always do at the office for me, Trucy?\nTrucy:\nOkay! Behold! The wondrous magic that can make anything disappear! Three, two, one... Ta-dah! My magic panties are an extra-dimensional galaxy!\nAthena:\nBrava, Trucy! Brava!\nApollo:\n...Okay, but why do you always have to make MY attorney's badge disappear?\nTrucy:\nWell, that's because, out of everyone at the Wright Anything Agency... ...you're the one I get the best reaction out of!\nApollo:\n(That doesn't make my poor badge feel any better...)\nExamine\nAnywhere\nApollo:\n(I guess I shouldn't touch anything while Trucy's around.)\nTrucy:\nYou shouldn't touch anything while I'm NOT around either!\nApollo:\n(She read my mind...)\nTalk\nThe show\nApollo:\nThanks again for inviting us, Trucy!\nTrucy:\nHee hee. Thank YOU for coming!\nApollo:\nYour show sure packs a wallop! I nearly fell out of my seat when that dragon showed up! And when it attacked you -- whew... ...I was terrified, even though I knew it was all just a part of the show!\nTrucy:\nThat's good! Because that trick is the crowning glory of Act One! I'm really glad you're enjoying the show!\nAthena:\nI heard your shows are completely sold out, Trucy! They say your fans were all over the tickets the instant they became available! Like hungry wolves going after their prey!\nApollo:\nSounds like you've made a loyal pack of followers for yourself already, Trucy.\nTrucy:\nBut you two are the only ones who got a special VIP invitation from me! Today's just a dress rehearsal for the performers, staff, family and friends.\nAthena:\nA \"Generalprobe,\" huh? That's what they call it in Germany!\nTrucy:\nThe real show isn't until the day after tomorrow.\nAthena:\nBy the way, are you going to finally do your magic panties trick onstage after the break?\nTrucy:\nSorry to disappoint anyone who came just to see my magic panties... ...but my next trick is completely new! I'm debuting it today!\nAthena:\nOoh! A new trick, huh? Are you gonna chop Apollo up into little lawyer bits?\nApollo:\nFunny, I don't recall EVER agreeing to anything like that...\nTrucy:\nHmm... While that DOES sound like a good idea... ...today's trick is a totally new Troupe Gramarye Original. The entire future of the troupe is riding on the success of this special new trick!\nApollo:\nHow so?\nSpecial new trick (appears after \"The show\")\nLeads to:\n\"This show is really important to me -- it isn't like any of the other shows I've done.\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nTrucy:\nOoh, your attorney's badge! Does this mean you want me to...?\nApollo:\n(...I knew I shouldn't have done that.)\nTrucy:\nHey! Why'd you put it away? Fine. If that's the way you're going to be... Three, two, one... Ta-dah!\nApollo:\nHey, don't make it...! Wait, my badge is still here...\nAthena:\nThat was MY badge, Trucy!\nTrucy:\nThis show is really important to me -- it isn't like any of the other shows I've done. As the rightful heir to the Troupe Gramarye repertoire of magic... ...this show is my first chance to unveil the tricks I've inherited.\nApollo:\nTroupe Gramarye, huh...\nTrucy:\nYeah, I have a poster of them hanging right over there!\nApollo:\nHeh. It feels like it's been ages since I've seen a picture of them. (Troupe Gramarye was a group of magicians who dominated the magic world in their day. Trucy is the sole heir to the troupe's entire repertoire of stage magic.) Huh? Who's this guy in green and purple on the left here...?\nTrucy:\nOh, that's The Great Mr. Reus, the other magician in today's show. He used to belong to Troupe Gramarye, too, a long time ago.\nApollo:\nHey, so tell us more about this special magic you're going to reveal today!\nTrucy:\nIt's a secret Troupe Gramarye trick... ...left behind by my late granddaddy, Magnifi Gramarye. It's never been performed before, so this is the first time it'll be seen by the public!\nApollo:\nThe grand unveiling, huh? (No wonder she's been working so hard.)\nTrucy:\nWell, I'd better get going!\nApollo:\nHuh? Where to?\nTrucy:\nTo practice my act, of course! The show's only a few days away!\nApollo:\nYou're really pushing yourself. Didn't you practice until late last night, too?\nTrucy:\nYup! Because everything's gotta be just right!\nApollo:\n(Trucy inherited all of Troupe Gramarye's magic tricks from her father when he died. And the troupe's entire legacy is now resting on her shoulders. No wonder she's feeling the pressure.) It looks like everything's going well today, though. I mean, that last trick was perfect!\nTrucy:\nGrace under pressure -- that's me! After all, \"a true entertainer always keeps a smile on their face!\" That's the Troupe Gramarye creed!\nApollo:\nIt's hard to believe you've accomplished so much, even though you're still in high school.\nTrucy:\nHee hee. But, to tell you the truth, I'm actually pretty nervous.\nApollo:\nWho wouldn't be? (Oh, I bet this would do the trick...) You'll be FINE, Trucy! If anybody can do it, you can!\nTrucy:\nP-Polly... That was just the boost I needed! Thanks!\nAthena:\nApollo's \"fine\" sure has a way of really hitting you right in the heart -- and in the ears.\nApollo:\nEnough ragging on my voice already...\n???:\nTrucy?\nTrucy:\nOh, hi, Bonny!\nBonny:\nIt's almost time for the second act.\nTrucy:\nOh, okay. Thanks! Well, Apollo, Athena -- enjoy the rest of the show!\nApollo:\nBreak a leg, Trucy!\nTrucy:\nThanks. I will!\nAthena:\nI hope her new trick goes well.\nApollo:\nHey, this is Trucy we're talking about. She'll be fine.\n???:\nOh, I wouldn't be so sure...\nApollo:\nHuh?\nBonny:\nPerforming magic is like walking a tightrope -- there's always an element of danger. One little mistake can even cost you your life, you know. I wonder if she'll make it across today...\nApollo:\nUmm... and what do you mean by that, exactly?\nBonny:\nHee hee. Oh, nothing! Now, if you'll excuse me...\nApollo:\nShe's gone... (What was that all about? Judging by what she said, I'm going to guess she's probably a magician, too.)\nAthena:\nCome on, Apollo! We've gotta get back to our seats now or we'll be late!\nApollo:\nOw! Hey, stop pulling! Okay, let's see... (Guess it's time to Move back to the stage...)\nApril 27Penrose Theater - Stage\nAthena:\nHurry up, Apollo! It's about to start! I want to see what Trucy's next trick is!\nApollo:\nYou're really wound up today, aren't you... Why don't you take your seat and try to relax?\nAthena:\nWhoa! Look! There's a TV reporter over there! With a TV camera and everything!\nWidget:\nOh, yeah, baby!\nApollo:\nAthena, sit down! You're blocking people's view! Yeesh, I feel like I'm babysitting here...\nReporter:\nHello, everyone! I'm reporting from the beautiful Penrose Theater... ...where the public performance of \"Trucy in Gramarye-Land\" begins in just two short days! But today, they've very kindly agreed to give us a sneak preview! Isn't this exciting!\nAthena:\nApollo! Do you think I was on TV just now?!\nApollo:\nHow should I know? But if you were, you were disgracing our entire agency, that's for sure.\nAthena:\nH-Hey! What the heck's that supposed to mean?!\nApollo:\nOoh! Here it comes!\nAnime cutscene\nTrucy:\nNow, give up your dastardly ways! Huh?\nBonny:\nOver here!\nTrucy:\nAhhh!\nBonny:\nCome now, Mr. Hat! Offer the girl's life up to Mr. Reus and bring him back to life! Wh-What?!\nAthena:\n- Whaaahaha!\nApollo:\n- Wow! Just when and how did she make the switch?!\nTrucy:\nYou won't be reviving anyone today!\nAthena:\nWow, that was amazing! I have no idea how she escaped that coffin!\nApollo:\n(I'm glad Trucy's escape trick went off without a hitch.)\nTrucy:\nAnd when I open the coffin, like this... inside you seeeee... ...M-Mr. Reus? But how...?\nAthena:\nI wonder what's going on.\nApollo:\nHe's... not getting up...\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\nTrucy?! Wh-What just happened?!\nWhoa man! An accident?!\nIs, like, that guy DEAD?!\nAthena:\n...Wait. That's not part of the act?\nStaff:\nAttention, please! For your own safety, we ask that everyone please evacuate the building.\nApollo:\nWhat's going on? Is Trucy okay?!\nStaff:\nOutside, everyone! Evacuate immediately, please!\nApollo:\nWhoa! Hey! Stop grabbing at me!\nAthena:\nTrucyyyyyyy!\nApril 27Penrose Theater\nApollo:\n(They kicked us out.)\nHey, what gives?!\nWill somebody please tell us what's going on?!\nAthena:\nPoor Trucy! I hope she's okay... ...Hey, here comes that staff member from before.\nStaff:\nYour attention, please! We regret to inform you that today's show has been canceled!\nWhat?!\nBut I was looking forward to the rest of it!\nStaff:\nW-We are very sorry, but the theater is on lock-down pending a police investigation.\nApollo:\nE-Excuse me! Is it because of that accident? That man in the coffin -- is he...?\nStaff:\nU-Um, well... We're still trying to figure things out, sir... But I can tell you that Ms. Wright is fine. She wasn't injured, so please don't worry.\nApollo:\nThank goodness she's okay...\n???:\nHey, you there! What the heck's going on?! They wouldn't even let ME in. ME, for crying out loud!\nStaff:\nOh, Mr. Retinz! There was an accident during the show.\nRetinz:\nAn accident? Great, just great. That's all I need right now. Do you have any idea how much money we're sinking into this program?!\nApollo:\nUm... and you are...?\nRetinz:\nThe man behind the scenes, that's who. This is a fine kettle of fish, let me tell ya! Spinning all this is gonna be a real pain in my posterior, believe you me!\nApollo:\n(Spinning? As in covering it up?)\nRetinz:\nLook, I gotta get inside. Seriously, can't a guy catch a break around here?!\nApollo:\nWell, there he goes...\nAthena:\nWhy don't we go back to the office for now? I'm sure Trucy will call us once things have settled down.\nApollo:\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nExamine\nPenrose Theater building\nApollo:\nWhat an odd building.\nAthena:\nThe name \"Penrose Theater\" comes from the \"Penrose triangle\" -- an impossible object. It's called an impossible object because it only exists as an optical illusion.\nApollo:\nAn optical illusion?\nAthena:\nUh-huh. Just like how that \"cube\" on the front of the building isn't really a cube at all.\nApollo:\n............ It isn't? It sure looks like a cube to me.\nAthena:\nIt's just the way it's shaded. The dark and light parts make it look like it's jutting outward towards us, but it really isn't.\nApollo:\nHuh-whuh? It isn't?\nAthena:\nCome on. Let's take a look at it from over there.\nApollo:\nO-Okay? Whaaat?! You're right! That's so weird!\nAthena:\nNow do you get it?\nApollo:\nI think so? It's kinda hard to tell...\nIllusion clock or Penrose triangle\nApollo:\nWhat are all these weird objects, anyway? Are they supposed to be \"modern art\"? Like that clock... Is it just me, or are the hands moving awfully fast?\nAthena:\n\u00a1Ay, caramba! What kind of clock doesn't show the proper time? Is that part of what makes it \"art\"?\nApollo:\nWho knows? ...Hey, take a look at that man in front of the clock. He's trying real hard to set his watch to it.\nAthena:\n! H-Hey! Mister!\n\"Trucy in Gramarye-Land\" poster\nAthena:\nLook! There's Trucy -- front and center! So the show actually starts the day after tomorrow, huh?\nApollo:\nI don't know if you've noticed, but... ...you see that man in front of the poster? He's been standing there a long time looking at it.\nAthena:\nYeah, I noticed! And sometimes, he kind of stretches his hand towards it a little bit...\nApollo:\nOh... I bet he's one of Trucy's fans. You think he's gonna try to make off with it?\nAthena:\nWho knows... Oh, look! I guess we don't have to worry! Ha ha ha! Every time the man reaches for it, the dog growls and pulls at his pant leg.\nApollo:\nYeah, it kinda begs the question: Who's the master and who's the pet?\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nApollo:\nSo, Athena, any ideas?\nAthena:\nSorry... I've got nothing. I mean, it was just one amazing trick after another! Who could figure it all out?!\nApollo:\nUm... I was asking if you have any ideas about the accident, not the show, Athena...\nWhat to do\nApollo:\nI can't believe they had to cancel the rest of the show. I wonder if Trucy's okay...\nAthena:\nYeah, poor thing... After all her hard work, too! I sure with Mr. Wright was here right now.\nApollo:\nWell, I guess we'd better head back to the office. There's nothing we can do here.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nAthena:\nHeh heh! Myyy badge is shinier than yooours!\nApollo:\nOf course. Yours is newer than mine. A great weathered finish like this only comes with age and experience.\nAthena:\nWh-What?! I can get a finish just as good as that on my badge, too, you know!\nApollo:\nGetting it dirty on purpose doesn't count, Athena.\nAthena:\n\u00bfPerd\u00f3n? Ha ha ha! Wh-What makes you think I'd ever do anything like that?\nApril 27Wright Anything Agency\n*ring ring*\n............*beep*\nApollo:\nIt's no use. I can't get a hold of Mr. Wright. I wonder if something happened to him in Khura'in.\nAthena:\nMaybe he got caught up in some kind of trouble again, as always.\nApollo:\nYeah, trouble's drawn to him like iron filings to a magnet.\nAthena:\nHey, Apollo! Speaking of Khura'in, they're showing something about it on TV right now!\nTV:\nThere has been some surprising news coming out of the Kingdom of Khura'in. The country recently saw defense attorney Phoenix Wright win a \"not guilty\" verdict... ...the first verdict of its kind in twenty-three years!\nApollo:\n...! Mr. Wright won a trial in Khura'in?!\nTV:\nLawyers are said to be highly disrespected in the Kingdom of Khura'in... ...so Mr. Wright's win was an upset victory amidst entrenched hostility.\nAthena:\nWow! Did you hear that?! The first time in twenty-three years!\nApollo:\nYeah... But what was he doing in court there in the first place? I thought he just went for a visit.\nAthena:\nSo he WAS in some kind of trouble, just like we thought!\nTV:\nNext, an update on the unfortunate accident that occurred at the Penrose Theater...\nAthena:\nHey, now they're talking about the accident at Trucy's show!\nTV:\nFamed magician \"The Great Mr. Reus\" was skewered with a sword and died on the spot.\nApollo:\nOh, no! So... he really is dead...\nTV:\nAnd now, here is the footage of that deadly moment.\nTV:\nMr. Reus's body isn't visible in this footage... ...but these are still very shocking images. The magician, Trucy Wright, is reportedly still only a high school student. Could it be that this unfortunate accident happened due to a lack of proper training? Did the young magician have enough experience, preparation, and knowledge? Some might say that Troupe Gramarye should be held accountable for this incident.\nApollo:\nHey! What kind of biased reporting is this?\nAthena:\nYeah! They're making it sound like it's all Trucy's fault!\nTV:\nOh! We've just received more breaking news. ......Oh, my! The young magician in question, Trucy Wright... ...is now under arrest on the charge of involuntary manslaughter!\nApollo:\nWh-Whaaaat?!\nTV:\nWe will keep you updated as this unfortunate tale unfolds. Stay tuned!\nApollo:\nTrucy's under arrest?! She can't be!\nAthena:\n...Apollo! We've gotta do something!\nApollo:\nYeah. Let's get down to the detention center right away! (But before I forget, I think I'll jot a few things down about the case. I'll just open up the Court Record with [R / RB / E]... (Changed from [I'll just open up the Court Record...] in the original release) ...and flip to this bottom-most tab here with [L / LB / Q] or [R / RB / E] to make a few Notes. (Changed from [...and make a few Notes.] in the original release) I can use it like a kind of \"To Do\" list. If I ever get stuck, I can just refer to these notes.)\nExamine\nBookshelf\nApollo:\nMr. Wright sure has a lot of law books and old case files.\nAthena:\nIt sure looks that way, doesn't it. But take a closer look. Most of those books and files have to do with magic.\nApollo:\nOh, wow. You're right... They're just hidden behind law book covers...\nAthena:\nLittle by little, Trucy is taking over the whole office with her magic equipment.\nApollo:\nI hate to admit it, but recently... ...I sometimes feel like I'm going to forget I'm even a lawyer when I'm here.\nAthena:\nIt sounds like Trucy's magic is starting to take over your brain, too.\nCharley the plant\nAthena:\nI just watered Charley, so he's looking pretty perky.\nApollo:\nFor a guy whose desk is always a big jumbled mess... ...Mr. Wright never forgets to water Charley.\nAthena:\nSometimes, I catch him staring at that plant and smiling. It must hold some special meaning for him.\nApollo:\nCould be. He did say Charley's been in this office since his first days as a lawyer... He doesn't seem to want to talk about it much, though.\nAthena:\nOne thing's for sure: Charley is no ordinary plant.\nHula hoop\nApollo:\nIt's yet another magic prop.\nAthena:\nOh! A hoop! I'm really good at that! How about you?\nApollo:\nNope. I just don't seem to have the knack for it.\nAthena:\nI figured as much. After all, you're not really in-tune with your body.\nApollo:\nYou DO realize this hoop is used for the \"levitating woman\" trick, right?\nAthena:\nWhat?! It's not for hula dancing?!\nAthena:\nAnd since you're \"really good at that\"...\nAthena:\nNo! What I meant was...\nApollo:\n...I think I'll recommend you to Trucy for the assistant role, then! You can take over for me!\nAthena:\nWhat did I hula myself into...?\nMagic props\nAthena:\nI wonder what kinds of tricks Trucy uses these things for. Like this little guillotine, for example.\nApollo:\nWell, a human head definitely wouldn't fit. So maybe something small and fuzzy?\nAthena:\nEww! That's disgusting! Not to mention cruel! Trucy would never do anything like that!\nApollo:\nHmph. You didn't get mad that time Trucy put MY head in a guillotine!\nAthena:\nThat's because you performed your role with such gusto! I mean, your screams were so realistic, I couldn't stop laughing!\nApollo:\n(That's because they were 100% real...)\nMagic split box\nAthena:\nI've always thought these shelves were a little awkward and hard to use.\nApollo:\nYeah. The shape doesn't really lend itself well to the concept of \"shelves.\" I mean, there's a hole in the top part and everything.\nAthena:\nDid you ever notice that every now and then, things disappear when you put them inside? It's like the shelves remember that they used to be a magic prop or something.\nApollo:\nNot the most useful piece of furniture in the world, to say the least.\nTable\nApollo:\nWith everyone's personal items littering the office, this place is as messy as ever.\nAthena:\nYeah... Take this loud jacket of yours, for example. It's been sitting here forever.\nApollo:\n\"Loud\"?! What do you mean by, \"loud\"? I love that jacket!\nAthena:\nOh, yeah? Why don't you ever wear it, then?\nApollo:\nWell, uh... (The last time I wore that jacket...)\nTrucy:\nOh, Polly! I'm so happy for you! You finally decided to take the plunge! Now you're ready for your stand-up comedy debut! You, Daddy, and Athena should form a group! I can see it now: \"Primary Color Punch-Lines\"!\nApollo:\nLet's just say that jacket brings back painful memories...\nAthena:\n?\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nAthena:\nHow dare they cover it like that?! They're putting everything on Trucy! I'm going to stage a huge protest! You'll see!\nApollo:\n(Yikes. Athena's scary when she's mad!) Okay... So what's the plan?\nAthena:\nI'm gonna stop watching TV completely, starting today!\nApollo:\nThat's your \"huge protest\"?\nAthena:\nAh...! But there's this show I want to watch this week... Nrrrrgh! I can already tell this is going to be a hard, uphill battle!\nApollo:\nYeah... Good luck with that, Sisyphus.\nWhat to do\nAthena:\nI'll race you to the detention center! Loser buys the winner juice. Deal?\nApollo:\nA race?! You mean, I have to RUN?! ...Let's just skip the running and go straight to me buying you juice.\nApollo:\nYES!!! That's the fourth free juice this month!\nApollo:\n(Athena is getting really good at sponging off of me.)\nApril 27Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nTrucy:\n............\nApollo:\n(Poor Trucy... What can we even say to her?)\nTrucy:\n...Oh! Polly! Athena!\nAthena:\nTrucy... Are you okay?\nTrucy:\n...I'm fine. Don't worry about me.\nApollo:\nWe saw the news about the accident on TV.\nTrucy:\nEh heh heh. Guess I can't Houdini my way out of this one. I got arrested and everything! They say I'm the one who caused the accident.\nApollo:\nBut that's not true... right?\nTrucy:\nTo be honest... I don't really know. I mean, I have no idea how an accident like that could've happened. The trick went off without a hitch. I'm sure of that much! Still, the police just won't listen to me! They've already decided that it was all my fault! *sigh* I'm exhausted after all their questions...\nAthena:\nLooks like she's been able to hang in there at least.\nApollo:\nYeah... (She really is one tough cookie.) I know you're tired, but... ...can you tell us a little bit about the accident?\nTrucy:\nYes, of course! Go ahead and ask me anything! I'll be... I'll be fine!\nExamine\nCamera\nApollo:\n(The security camera stares at us with its cold, unblinking eye. I don't know why, but it gives me the heebies, with a side order of jeebies.)\nGuard\nApollo:\n(The guard is just standing there completely motionless... ...and Athena keeps making faces at him, trying to make him crack at least a smile.)\nAthena:\nOoh! I think I made him smirk a little!\nApollo:\nC'mon. Leave the poor guy alone, Athena.\nMicrophone\nApollo:\n(It's the microphone for speaking with people on the other side of the glass. Athena is trying to stump the guard with trivia questions.)\nAthena:\nOoh, this guy is good! He answers in the blink of an eye without batting an eyelash... or moving a muscle!\nApollo:\n(Is he that bored?)\nTalk\nThe incident\nApollo:\nFor starters, can you help us understand what happened? In today's show, there was a dead body in the coffin. How did that happen? Was there some kind of... accident?\nTrucy:\nI-I don't really know. The coffin was supposed to be empty when I opened it. But instead, Mr. Reus's body was in there...\nApollo:\nThat must've been a huge shock for you.\nAthena:\nAnd when the dragon set piece fell down at the end -- was that an accident, too?\nTrucy:\nIt must have been. I have no idea how or why that happened, either. Nothing went the way it was supposed to! I still can't believe Mr. Reus is actually dead...\nApollo:\n(As tough as she is, this is obviously taking a toll on her...)\nAthena:\nBut how did Mr. Reus's body get into the coffin in the first place?\nApollo:\nTrucy, we need you to tell us the secret of the trick.\nTrucy:\nHmm... You know what they say, \"a magician never reveals her secrets.\" ...But I guess I should make an exception this time. But if you ever tell anybody... ...I'll make you my guinea pig for every single new magic trick from now on!\nApollo:\nD-Don't worry! I'm a lawyer, remember? Client confidentiality is part of the job!\nThe magic trick (appears after \"The incident\")\nApollo:\nSo let's call this trick \"Trucy's Great Escape.\" How did you get out of the coffin?\nTrucy:\n...All right. Here goes. I'll reveal the trick just for you two. Prepare yourselves for an exclusive explanation by Magical Girl Trucy Wright! There's a secret trapdoor in the stage that leads down to the understage passage.\nApollo:\nA trapdoor...? So when did you slip down into the understage passage?\nTrucy:\nRemember when Mr. Hat was onstage, holding a sword next to the coffin? Well, by then, I had already escaped from the coffin and was waiting understage. And, while I was down there, I did several things to get ready for the next part.\nAthena:\nWhat technique! Okay, so what happened next?\nTrucy:\nMr. Hat was quickly raised up to the catwalk by wire. There's a cushion up there that acts as a shock absorber when Mr. Hat hits it. Meanwhile, I popped back up onto the stage through a different trapdoor! And voil\u00e0! The switch is complete!\nStage Diagram added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nI had no idea all of that was happening! I was convinced you were still in the coffin!\nTrucy:\nThat's what professional magicians do. They make their audience see something that isn't really there.\nApollo:\nIn other words, you make us see illusion, right?\nTrucy:\nWe call it \"misdirection.\" While we keep you busy believing one thing, we're busy making something else happen. What we say is there really isn't, and what we say isn't there actually is!\nApollo:\nI get it -- it's kind of like a magical bluff.\nAthena:\nHmm... but there's no escaping the fact that the victim's body was actually in the coffin. It wasn't empty like it was supposed to be.\nTrucy:\nYeah, that's the part I don't understand. The last thing in the world I expected to see in there was Mr. Reus!\nApollo:\nCould he have climbed in there by mistake? (I should get back to asking Trucy about the accident.) Can you tell us more about the victim?\nThe magic trick (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nSo let's call this trick \"Trucy's Great Escape.\" How did you get out of the coffin?\nTrucy:\n...All right.

The last thing in the world I expected to see in there was Mr. Reus!\nApollo:\nCould he have climbed in there by mistake? (I should get back to asking Trucy about the accident.) Can you tell us more about the victim?\nThe Great Mr. Reus (appears after \"The magic trick\")\nApollo:\nWho exactly is this Mr. Reus? You said he used to belong to Troupe Gramarye, right?\nAthena:\nWait, you don't know who The Great Mr. Reus is, Apollo?! He's super famous! He's all people talk about on TV!\nApollo:\nReally? I just assumed he was one of Trucy's assistants.\nAthena:\nWay to diss the dead, Apollo...\nApollo:\nSo how did the two of you come to perform together, Trucy?\nTrucy:\nWell, like I said, he used to be a member of Troupe Gramarye. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of my granddaddy, Magnifi Gramarye. So the TV station arranged for us to perform together this time because of that connection.\nApollo:\nDid he continue performing as a magician after he left Troupe Gramarye?\nTrucy:\nNo. He got injured while practicing for a show about thirteen years ago. That's why he left the troupe. After that, he took a break from magic for a while.\nAthena:\nI'm pretty sure it's a recent thing, him getting famous again. I only started seeing him on TV again maybe last year.\nTrucy:\nI had nothing but respect for Mr. Reus as a magician. I can't tell you how sad I am this happened...\nApollo:\n(I can't imagine how traumatic it must be to have someone die during your big show...)\nTrucy:\nOh! But, hey... Don't worry, I'm fine! I have to stay strong for my fans!\nBRACELET THUMPS\nApollo:\nHuh? (My bracelet is reacting... People tend to unconsciously tense up when they're trying to hide something. And when I pick up on their distress, the bracelet around my wrist starts to feel tight. So I guess this means that Trucy's trying to hide something from me. Well, I guess I should give my bracelet a tap with [X / Y / R]... (Changed from [Well, I guess I should give my bracelet a touch (X)...] in the original release))\nPresent Bracelet\nApollo:\n(I can see things others can't -- the slightest twitch, gesture, or change in expression... Yes... I can see it all when I'm concentrating intensely like this. And when people are feeling nervous, they sometimes reveal a certain habit or tell. (Changed from [And when people are feeling tense, they sometimes reveal a certain habit or little tic.] in the original release) I'll just shift my viewpoint around until I find Trucy's tell. (Changed from [I'll just shift my viewpoint around until I find Trucy's nervous tic.] in the original release))\nPan to face\nLeads to:\n\"Okay. I think I found her telltale tell.\"\nApollo:\n(Okay. I think I found her telltale tell. (Changed from [Okay. I think I found her telltale tic.] in the original release) Now, to listen carefully to every word and see what she gets shifty-eyed over. Then I'll \"Perceive\" ([X / Y / R]) whatever she seems nervous about to get to the bottom of things!)\nTrucy:\nDon't worry, I'm fine! I have to stay strong for my fans!\nPerceive darting eyes on \"I'm fine!\"\nApollo:\nApollo:\nCome on, Trucy. You should know by now that you can't hide anything from me.\nTrucy:\n! Don't tell me that your bracelet reacted...\nApollo:\nYup.\nTrucy:\nAnd here I thought my smile was going to do the trick... Heh. Looks like I broke the first rule of being a magician. \"A true entertainer always keeps a smile on their face,\" right?\nApollo:\nI remember hearing you say that before.\nTrucy:\nThat's right. It's a Gramarye motto that my daddy used to say before he passed away. I'll never forget it. It's one of the few precious memories I have of him.\nApollo:\nBut you can't keep everything inside, Trucy. You'll burst! Why don't you tell me what's bothering you?\nTrucy:\nI can't! If I did... ...you wouldn't believe in me anymore!\nApollo:\nThat's not true. As an entertainer, you believe in always keeping a smile on your face. And as a lawyer, I have a belief that's important to me as well.\nPresent Attorney's Badge\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"! Your attorney's badge...?\"\nPresent anything else\nApollo:\nTrucy:\nPolly...? What does that have to do with your beliefs?\nApollo:\nUm, well... Something about the shape maybe...? Or the color...?  Heh. Heh heh...\nTrucy:\nIt's okay... If you can't believe in me, then you just can't.\nApollo:\nNo! I just made a mistake. Let me try that again, okay?\nLeads back to:\n\"As an entertainer, you believe in always keeping a smile on your face.\"\nTrucy:\n! Your attorney's badge...?\nApollo:\nI swore on this badge that I would always believe in my client to the bitter end. That's the cornerstone of being a good lawyer. Mr. Wright taught me as much. So no matter what you tell me, I'm going to keep on believing in you, Trucy! All I ask is for you to have a little faith in me, too.\nTrucy:\n............ All right. Thanks, Polly.\nLeads back to Talk options\nPerceive wrong area\nApollo:\nApollo:\nTrucy, are you okay? You looked a little flustered just now.\nTrucy:\nFlustered? I don't think so? What about you? You have little beads of sweat on your forehead! And you only display that tic when you don't know what you're doing.\nApollo:\n(Ouch. Trucy's tongue is as sharp as her eyes.)\nLeads back to Talk options\nStarting over\nApollo:\nI should \"Perceive\" with [X / Y / R] when she's displaying her nervous habit. (Changed from [I should touch \"Perceive\" (X) while she's displaying her nervous tic.] in the original release)\nLeads back to:\n\"Don't worry, I'm fine! I have to stay strong for my fans!\"\nThe truth (appears after percieving)\nLeads to:\n\"Polly... What if I made a mistake...?\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nTrucy:\nOh, your attorney's badge! Does this mean you want me to...?\nApollo:\nNot even you can make it disappear through this glass.\nTrucy:\nThree, two, one... Ta-dah!\nApollo:\nHuh?! It's gone! Wow, how did you do that?! And how are you going to make it reappear?!\nTrucy:\nOh, guaaard! I'm ready to go now!\nApollo:\nWait, what about the rest of the trick?\nAnything else\nTrucy:\nAre you saying you want me to conjure up a copy or two of this?\nApollo:\nAbsolutely not! Forged evidence isn't going to help us in court.\nTrucy:\nIt'll be fine! With my magic, I'll make sure the audience can't see the strings attached!\nApollo:\n(It's not the audience, but the discerning eyes of the law I'm worried about...)\nTrucy:\nPolly... What if I made a mistake...?\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean?\nTrucy:\nWhat if it really was me who stabbed Mr. Reus...?\nApollo:\n...What makes you say that?\nTrucy:\nWell, in my escape trick, I use both a real sword and a rubber sword. I switch the real sword for the rubber sword just before I stab it into the coffin. So even if somebody HAD been in there, the rubber sword shouldn't have hurt them.\nApollo:\nBut Mr. Reus was found dead in the coffin...\nTrucy:\nI know! It just doesn't make any sense! I know I swapped the swords!\nApollo:\nYou're absolutely sure?\nTrucy:\nPositive! I practiced that trick hundreds of times with no mistakes! I remember very clearly swapping the swords this time, too! But could I have...? Could I have made a mistake this time...?\nApollo:\n............ (Could she really have...?)\nTrucy:\nWell, I'd better get going!\nApollo:\nHuh? Where to?\nTrucy:\nTo practice my act, of course! The show's only a few days away!\nApollo:\nYou're really pushing yourself. Didn't you practice until late last night, too?\nTrucy:\nYup! Because everything's gotta be just right!\nTrucy:\n......... M-Maybe I really did kill Mr. Reus.\nApollo:\nTrucy...\nTrucy:\nThe worst possible mistake I could make... Such a horrific accident, right in the middle of my show... And yet, all I can think about is... ...now that this has happened... ...Troupe Gramarye will get its performance rights pulled! There'll never be another show! Everything my family worked so hard for will be gone forever! And poor Mr. Reus had his whole life and a great career ahead of him! I... ruined everything...! I destroyed it all!\nI took it all away!\nTrucy:\n...Polly... I... I'm ready to pay for what I did...\nApollo:\n............ Trucy, I don't think you did anything wrong.\nTrucy:\nYou don't?!\nApollo:\n...I've had one question going through my mind this whole time... Was this accident... really your fault?\nTrucy:\n...What do you mean?\nApollo:\nI don't have any proof or anything -- it's just... ...I don't think you'd ever make a mistake like that.\nTrucy:\nApollo...\nApollo:\nI saw how hard you worked on your tricks, staying up late every night to practice. And I know you. You always get everything picture-perfect.\nTrucy:\nNobody's perfect all of the time...\nApollo:\nStill, I think something else caused Mr. Reus's death, not any mistake of yours. After all, you're sure you swapped the swords, right?\nTrucy:\nYes... I remember doing it...\nApollo:\nThen I just know it wasn't your fault, Trucy!\nTrucy:\nB-But... how can you say that?! We don't have any proof it wasn't me! I-I mean, I know you're a great lawyer, Polly, but...!\nApollo:\nI believe in you, Trucy. And I believe in your skill as a professional magician. So I'm going to prove your innocence. Don't worry -- you're going to be FINE!\nTrucy:\n............ ............ ............ *sniffle*\nApollo:\n!\nTrucy:\nThank you, Apollo. Thank you for believing in me. I-I'm going to... believe in you, too!\nApollo:\n.........Good!\nTrucy:\nI-I'm sorry... I need a tissue... *sniffle*\nApollo:\n(I've never seen Trucy cry like this before... She always seems so strong... ...but maybe sometimes, she's just putting on a brave face. She's still just a kid, after all...)\nApollo:\nSo, I have to ask to make it official, but... will you let me defend you?\nTrucy:\nYes! I'm counting on you! I don't want to have to cancel the show on its opening day!\nApollo:\nRight! (She seems fine now.)\nAthena:\n*sniffle* Truuucyyyy! Let's wiiiin this triaaaal togetherrrr! *sob*\nApollo:\n(Unlike some people...)\nApollo:\nWell, we'd better get right to investigating. Come on, Athena. Wipe that nose and let's go.\nAthena:\nExcuse you! Do you see any snot on my face, Apollo?!\nApollo:\n(Yeesh... Talk about an emotional roller coaster...)\nAthena:\nWe'll need to investigate the stage at the Penrose Theater where the body was found.\nApollo:\nYeah... I hope no one will try to stop us.\nTrucy:\nIf you're going to the Penrose Theater, can I ask you a favor?\nApollo:\nOf course. What is it?\nTrucy:\nI left a very special notebook behind in my dressing room...\nApollo:\nSure. We can pick it up for you.\nTrucy:\nThat notebook is really, REALLY important to me! I-I don't know WHAT I'd do if anybody read it...! Nngh...\nApollo:\n(W-Wow. I wonder what's in it...)\nTrucy:\nThe notebook is in my blue handbag on the table. It's big and black -- you can't miss it. Thanks in advance! And with that, I've gotta go. It seems they've got more questions for me.\nApollo:\nAll right. See you later, Trucy. (So, should we investigate the stage first, or go get the notebook...?)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nAthena:\nIt must be so hard for Trucy, yet you saw how bravely she held back her tears!\nApollo:\nMaybe you should practice a little of that \"bravely holding back your tears\" thing, too. And by \"maybe,\" I mean your nose is running again...\nAthena:\nEnough with the snot-shaming! Haven't you ever heard the song, \"Into Each Life Some Boogers Must Fall\"?!\nApollo:\n...I'll take your word for it.\nWhat to do\nAthena:\nWe have to investigate the Penrose Theater from top to bottom! And talk to every single person involved as well!\nApollo:\nWow, you're really fired up!\nAthena:\nOf course! Trucy's entire future depends on this!\nApollo:\n(The agency's entire financial future, too...)\nPresent\nAnything else\nAthena:\nOh, some evidence from the case? Well, too bad. I don't have a single thing to say about it!\nApollo:\nAnd you're proud of that... why?\nBefore clearing all Talk options with Ema Skye in Penrose Theater:\nApril 27Penrose Theater - Stage\nApollo:\nOkay, let's get down to business...\nPoliceman:\nHey! What do you think you're doing?!\nApollo:\nWe're the attorneys for the defendant in this case. Is it all right if we examine the scene?\nPoliceman:\nOf course it's not all right! I don't care if you're the defense or the president! No unauthorized investigations!\nApollo:\nAw, come on. It wouldn't kill you to let us take a little look around...\nPoliceman:\nI said no! Now get out of here! Scram!\nAthena:\nI guess we'll just have to try and get permission from the lead detective.\nExamine\nAnywhere\nAthena:\nIf we're real quiet and sneaky, maybe we can--\nPoliceman:\nHey, you kids! Don't touch the crime scene!\nApollo:\nBut we're the defendant's lawyers.\nPoliceman:\nBig deal! You think that buys you some kind of special privilege or something?! If you try and touch anything again, I'm gonna arrest you!\nAthena:\nWhat if we give you a super discount coupon for when you need legal representation?\nPoliceman:\n.........I said no!\nApollo:\n(He actually thought about it for a second there...)\nAthena:\nI guess we'll have to find the lead detective and get permission after all.\nApril 27Penrose Theater\nThe person you are trying to call is not available. After the tone, please reco--\n*beep*\nApollo:\nArgh. I've tried calling Mr. Wright a hundred times, but he never picks up.\nAthena:\nWe've left him some voicemails, so he'll probably call once he gets them.\nApollo:\nHe's going to flip out when he hears what happened to Trucy.\n???:\nHey, this is the place -- the theater where that \"magical murder\" happened!\n???:\nOh, yeah. Wonder if they brought the dead body out yet.\n???:\nI hear they already arrested the murderer. They say it's a young girl!\n???:\nYeah, a high school student. Can you believe it? Kids these days.\nApollo:\nWhat's with all the curious bystanders? They sure are kicking up a fuss.\nAthena:\nHow dare they call Trucy a murderer?!\nWidget:\nThey've got some nerve!\nApollo:\nWe can't let people think that about her. We have to defend her!\n???:\nApollo? Is that you?\nApollo:\n...E-Ema?\nEma:\nIt's sure been a while. How've you been?\nApollo:\nOh, can't complain. I haven't seen you in ages. ............ (Ema is not usually in the best of moods... ...so I never quite know what to do or say around her...) ...Well, we have some business to take care of, so I guess we'd better get going!\nEma:\nHey, wait a minute!\nApollo:\nWhat? Was it something I said?\nEma:\nYou're darn right it's something you said! What's with you brushing me off like that? We've got heaps to catch up on! After all we've been through... You're not still mad at me about something, are you?\nApollo:\nS-Sorry. I didn't mean to upset you...\nAthena:\nWho's this, Apollo? A distant cousin or something?\nApollo:\nN-No, Ema's a detective I've had the, uh... pleasure of working with before.\nEma:\nHello. I'm Ema Skye, forensic investigator.\nApollo:\nWhat? So you're finally a full-fledged forensic investigator?\nEma:\nYeah! I finally achieved my life-long dream! Look! I even have an official forensic investigator armband and everything!\nApollo:\nThat's great, Ema! I bet the exam was really hard, huh.\nEma:\nOh, it was a cinch!\nApollo:\nReally? 'Cause I thought you said something about failing it over and over...\nEma:\nWell, never mind that! The important thing is, I'm not a plain ol' detective anymore! So no more boring ol' investigations for me! I'm so happy, I could hug the whole world!\nApollo:\nComing from you, that's really something.\nEma:\nCriminals beware! Fingerprinting, luminol testing, DNA analysis -- Ema Skye is raring to go, so bring it on!\nApollo:\n(Wow. I guess it's \"goodbye, grumpy clouds -- hello, fanatical sun.\")\nAthena:\nShe's very cheerful, isn't she? Is it because of the weather or something?\nApollo:\nShe sure wasn't like this before. She was pretty frustrated back when she was assigned to the Criminal Affairs Department. And she was always munching on chocolate Snackoos to relieve her stress.\nEma:\nSnackoos and stress are a thing of the past. I've said goodbye to both of them.\nApollo:\nAnd may you never have to see either again.\nEma:\nBy the way, are you two here because of the murder?\nApollo:\n\"Murder\"? Don't you mean the \"accident\"?\nEma:\nOh. Then I guess you haven't heard. The case is being treated as a straight-up homicide now.\nApollo:\nWhat?\nEma:\nJust so you know, I heard that the prosecution is going to argue tomorrow that... ...Trucy outright murdered Mr. Reus.\nApollo:\nWH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nAthena:\nAre you kidding?! They're treating it as a murder?!\nApollo:\nEma! Please tell us everything you know!\nEma:\nOf course! Anything to help Trucy!\nTalk\nThe incident\nApollo:\nWhy is the case being treated as a homicide now, and not involuntary manslaughter?!\nEma:\nWell, apparently... ...there's something that proves it was a straight-up homicide.\nApollo:\nWell, that's vague. Do you know any of the details?\nEma:\nN-No... I'm afraid that's all I was told...\nApollo:\nReally? How come?\nEma:\nWell, because the lead prosecutor is kind of a hard guy to read. Though maybe it's just a culture gap thing? Anyway, he's not one to really share his thoughts.\nApollo:\nWait, what do you mean by \"culture gap\"?\nEma:\nI mean that he's a foreigner, so his way of going about things is different.\nApollo:\nSo who exactly am I up against tomorrow?\nEma\nApollo:\nCongrats on finally becoming the forensic investigator you always wanted to be.\nEma:\nThanks! I failed that exam so many times, but I finally did it! I can finally use my forensics kit openly, whenever I want!\nApollo:\nOh, yeah. You used to have to stealth use a kit you sent away for.\nEma:\nOh, I still use that one, too. But now, it's more of a hobby kit. It's important to have hobbies too, you know.\nApollo:\nSo, basically, nothing's changed.\nEma:\nAre you kidding? I don't have to worry about getting in trouble for taking fingerprints for fun now! It's positively life-changing! I can take all the prints I want!\nApollo:\nA-Are you sure you're allowed to do that?\nEma:\nSure, I'm sure! I've been collecting all the prints I've taken into a personal database! Now, hold out your hands! I need to get your prints, too.\nApollo:\nJust promise me you won't use them for evil...\nAthena:\n...I can't believe she took my prints, too, Apollo...\nThe prosecution (appears after \"The incident\")\nEma:\nChief Prosecutor Edgeworth has been reorganizing the prosecutor's office lately. As a part of that effort, he's gotten rid of a lot of corrupt prosecutors. So the prosecutor's office is looking pretty empty these days...\nApollo:\nAnd that's how a foreign prosecutor got assigned to this case?\nEma:\nThat's part of it, yes. We were short on prosecutors, and this guy just happened to be visiting.\nApollo:\nAnd what's the purpose of his visit?\nEma:\nWell, some insurgents from the Kingdom of Khura'in are thought to be hiding out here. As an international prosecutor, he apparently came to investigate the matter personally.\nApollo:\nSo he's from the Kingdom of Khura'in?\nEma:\nThat's right. He's also a Khura'inist monk.\nApollo:\nA monk? So how did he get assigned to this particular case anyway?\nEma:\nIt seems he's very devoted to furthering his studies as a prosecutor. He wanted to learn how crime scenes are investigated here, so he just showed up.\nApollo:\nSo he was just curious, huh.\nEma:\nHe looked the entire crime scene over quite earnestly... ...and just as everyone else was ready to call it a case of involuntary manslaughter...\n\"This is most certainly a murder, the cruel act of an impure soul.\"\nEma:\nThat's what he said. Just like that. Then he volunteered himself as the prosecutor for this case. With the shortage of prosecutors right now, the prosecutor's office was glad to have him.\nAthena:\nSo Trucy was arrested for murder all because of this guy, huh?\nEma:\nI have to say, he's definitely not your typical prosecutor. He says court is where a victim receives their last rites. Where the truth is revealed, the criminal is judged, and the victim's soul sees salvation... Receiving last rites in court allows the victim to finally rest in peace, or so he claims.\nAthena:\nSo, to him, a trial is like performing funeral rites for the victim, huh?\nApollo:\nThat's certainly a unique way of looking at it...\nEma:\nHis name is... Nahyuta Sahdmadhi.\nApollo:\nWhat?! Nahyuta... Sahdmadhi?!\nEma:\nThat's right. What, do you know him or something?\nApollo:\nOh, uh... I guess you could say I've heard of him...\nEma:\nYeah, well, he IS pretty famous.\nAthena:\nReally?\nEma:\nYes. They say he travels the world, solving difficult case after difficult case. Where there is a hard case to crack, he's called in to prosecute it.\nAthena:\nWow. Sounds like he's going to be tough to beat.\nApollo:\n(I... I can't believe this... I have to stand in court against... him?)\nEma:\nHe seems like a very kind and gentle person, though. He's very polite and understanding to everyone he talks to.\nApollo:\nHuh. So he's a pretty agreeable guy, then?\nEma:\nYeah. He's bound to see what kind of person Trucy really is.\nAthena:\nBut don't they hate defense attorneys in Khura'in? Would he even listen to what we have to say?\nEma:\nI don't see why not. He certainly seems like the type of person who would.\nApollo:\nEven so... do you think you could do us a favor, Ema? Could you tell Prosecutor Sahdmadhi about Trucy -- about what a good person she is?\nEma:\nOf course. Leave it to me! I'll make him understand there's no way Trucy could've committed murder!\nAthena:\nI hope he listens to reason.\nApollo:\nM-Me, too...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nEma:\nIt's been two years since we first met... ...but you're still just a newbie to me.\nApollo:\nHey, that's not fair! I'm not even the newest lawyer in our office anymore!\nAthena:\nYup! That's Apollo and me -- just two newbies working our way up!\nEma:\nAww. Look at you two, the newbie duo. Must be nice, right, Apollo?\nApollo:\n............\nAnything else\nEma:\nO-ho! Are you asking me to test that? .........Hey! Why are you putting it away?\nApollo:\n(I can't... I just can't let her cover this in chemical reagents...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nAthena:\nThis is looking pretty bad, Apollo... They're calling it a murder, and they've even got proof! What are we gonna do?\nApollo:\n...Look on the bright side, that's what.\nAthena:\nBright side? What bright side?\nApollo:\nWell, the good thing about there being proof is that it has to point to the real killer. If we can find out who that is... ...we can prove Trucy's innocence!\nAthena:\nOh! H-Hey, you're right...\nApollo:\nWhich means our objectives are clear. We have to find two things: proof of Trucy's innocence... ...and evidence of the true culprit's identity.\nAthena:\nYou know what, Apollo? You're starting to give me a glimmer of hope!\nApollo:\n(And that means there's only one thing to do...) Ema, would it be all right if we investigate the scene?\nEma:\nIf I said no, you'd just do it behind my back anyway, right?\nApollo:\nHa ha ha... Would I do something like that? (Guess the jig is up.)\nEma:\nOh, all right. But I'd better come along. Who knows what sorts of mischief you'd get up to if I'm not there to keep an eye on you.\nAthena:\n\"Mischief\"? Sounds like Ema trusts you about as far as she can throw you, Apollo.\nEma:\nHe HAS been known to move things around at the scene of a crime, you know.\nApollo:\nAnd what about you? You used to do all kinds of forensic tests on things without permission.\nEma:\nThere's nothing wrong with that! After all, forensics is ALWAYS on the side of justice!\nApollo:\nHow is that even remotely fair?!\nApril 27Penrose Theater - Dressing Room\nApollo:\n(The dressing room looks just the way it did before the incident. All these items look kind of lonely without their owners...)\nAthena:\nWe have to find Trucy's notebook for her.\nApollo:\nLet's see. She said it would be in her blue handbag on the table, right? (We should see what else we can check out while we're here.)\nExamine\nBlue handbag\nApollo:\nOh, here's that handbag Trucy was talking about. (I feel a little funny about digging around in a girl's purse...) .........I guess it's okay to open it. After all, she DID ask us to.\nAthena:\nBut not you, Apollo! Let me do it! Let's see... Huh? No, not this... What's this? Oh, wow! She has--?! Oh, Trucy! You are BAD!\nApollo:\nWhat is it? I want to see, too.\nAthena:\nThat's funny... She said it was a black notebook, right? But there's nothing like that in here.\nApollo:\nMaybe Trucy was wrong about where she left it? Let's keep looking around for it.\nTrucy's handbag (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nI can't believe you! You were just going to open a lady's bag without any consideration!\nApollo:\nI-I did so give it consideration! Bagloads of it! It's just, well... Okay, I'll admit I was a bit curious...\nAthena:\nIt only took seconds for your ethics and morals to crumble... ...giving way to a desire to satisfy your insatiable curiosity...\nApollo:\nO-Objection! You don't have to make it sound so obscene!\nMr. Reus's props\nApollo:\nLook at all of this stuff. They must belong to Mr. Reus.\nAthena:\nWow, look at the colors on that briefcase. Do you think he carries that around with him on his time off?\nApollo:\nWell, during his shows, he wears a mask to hide his identity. If he carried that briefcase around when he wasn't working, wouldn't it give him away?\nAthena:\nAhh, but you've got to change gears and look at things in a different way at a time like this.\nApollo:\nOh, yeah? Meaning...?\nAthena:\nWell, what if Mr. Reus wore his full costume all the time -- even when he wasn't working? Then that briefcase wouldn't have given him away one bit!\nApollo:\nOkaaaaay...\nAthena:\nHeh heh. I'm getting pretty good at this \"turn your thinking around\" stuff, huh?\nApollo:\n(She's like a little kid who's learned a new trick and couldn't wait to try it out...)\nMr. Reus's props (after examining blue handbag)\nAthena:\nI say we take a look through Mr. Reus's things, too.\nApollo:\nHey... Is that a notebook sticking out from behind his briefcase?\nAthena:\nYou're right. It's practically screaming, \"Over here! Look at me!\"\nApollo:\nDo you think it could be...? Oh, wow! Athena! Our hunch was right... It's Trucy's notebook!\nAthena:\nWhat's it doing mixed in with Mr. Reus's stuff?!\nApollo:\nGood question.\nTrucy's Notebook added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nHmm, it's locked. I guess that means we can't read it...\nApollo:\nI wonder what kinds of secrets are in there to make her want to lock it.\nAthena:\nA girl her age needs her privacy! Besides, everybody has a secret or two they don't want others to know about.\nApollo:\nIf there's anything in there about kisses or crushes, I think Mr. Wright would cry.\nMr. Reus's props (after examining blue handbag; subsequent times)\nAthena:\nWhat was Trucy's notebook doing in the middle of Mr. Reus's things?\nApollo:\nThe obvious assumption is that he was trying to steal it.\nAthena:\nBut if he was, then why would he leave it sticking halfway out?\nApollo:\nMaybe he was just a sloppy guy? I can think of a few people like that. (Like Mr. Wright, for example.)\nAthena:\nHmm... If you say so... Takes one to know one, I guess.\nApollo:\n...Say what now?\nPosters\nApollo:\nTrucy put some posters up, I see. Oh, here's one of Troupe Gramarye.\nAthena:\n\"Troupe Gramarye: Magical Menagerie,\" huh? Looks like a bunch of folks dressed in outfits a bit too gaudy for their age, if you ask me...\nApollo:\nBut isn't that pretty much how all the best magicians dress?\nAthena:\nWas Troupe Gramarye really such a big deal back in the day?\nApollo:\nI guess so. Everybody in the country knew them back then. They had great tricks... ...like making a building disappear, or escaping a safe dropped from a helicopter.\nAthena:\nWow. I was in Europe at the time, so I had no idea. But if even YOU know about them, then they must've been really, really famous!\nApollo:\nI used to see them a lot on TV. I think it was back when I was in junior high. The one in black was the original leader of Troupe Gramarye, Trucy's grandfather. His name was Magnifi Gramarye. The one in pink with the mustache -- that's Zak Gramarye. Trucy's late biological father.\nAthena:\nOh! And look. There's Mr. Reus. So this poster's from back when he was a member of Troupe Gramarye, huh.\nApollo:\nTrucy said he left the troupe after he was injured during a show or something, right?\nThirteen-Year-Old Poster added to the Court Record.\nPosters (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nTrucy put some posters up, I see. Oh, here's one of Troupe Gramarye.\nAthena:\n\"Troupe Gramarye: Magical Menagerie,\" huh?

So this poster's from back when he was a member of Troupe Gramarye, huh.\nApollo:\nTrucy said he left the troupe after he was injured during a show or something, right?\nDove\nApollo:\nIt's a dove. Trucy must use it in one of her tricks.\nAthena:\nYeah. Hm? There's another birdcage next to it. I wonder what's in that one.\n???:\nCooooooo cooooooo ka-choooooooo!\nAthena:\n............ Wh-What in the world was that?!\nRabbits\nAthena:\nOh, look at the adorable little bunnies!\nApollo:\nRabbits, huh? I used to have a pet rabbit.\nAthena:\nReally? You? Ha ha ha ha ha! You sure don't look the type!\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean?! What's wrong with me having a pet rabbit?!\nAthena:\nAren't people who have rabbits as pets usually the quiet, sensitive type?\nApollo:\nW-Well, pardon me for being so loud and insensitive.\nYellow Nine-Tails flowers\nApollo:\nHuh? Aren't these nine-tails flowers? You know, those flowers that only grow in Nine-Tails Vale?\nAthena:\nOh, my goodness! You're right. There's a card here, and a letter to go with it. The card says, \"Good luck, Trucy! From Damian and Jinxie Tenma.\"\nApollo:\nMayor Tenma and Jinxie, huh? What does the letter say?\nAthena:\nLet's see... Oh! There's a message for you in here, too! \"Please tell Mr. Demon Lawyer I said thank you for everything. Thanks to him, I overcame my fears and now I'm not afraid of yokai anymore! And guess what? I've even become friends with yokai like Ittan Momen and Konaki Jiji!\"\nApollo:\nHa ha ha. No matter what happens, I guess she'll never grow out of her demon obsession.\nRed roses\nAthena:\nOh, these are from Prosecutor Gavin.\nApollo:\nRoses, huh? How like him: pretentious.\nAthena:\nThey might be pretentious, but you know what? He makes it work!\nApollo:\nHmph.\nAthena:\nApollo, I've noticed this for a while now, but... ...you get awfully prickly when it comes to Prosecutor Gavin.\nApollo:\nY-You think so?\nAthena:\nI mean, don't hate him just because he's beautiful.\nApollo:\nTh-That's not it at all!\nBellis flowers\nApollo:\nHey, these flowers! They're from Lamiroir.\nAthena:\nLamiroir...? Where have I heard that name before?\nApollo:\nShe's a famous singer. They call her the \"Siren of the Ballad,\" and she's pretty popular.\nAthena:\nWhy would a famous singer be sending Trucy flowers?\nApollo:\nWell, we met her through a case I headed up once.\nAthena:\nWow. Your circle of acquaintances is bigger than I thought.\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir... I don't know why, but her songs really touch me for some reason... I hope she's doing well...)\nMakeup or black suitcase\nAthena:\nLook at all this stuff. I bet it belongs to that bunny assistant we saw in the show.\nApollo:\nWow. That's a LOT of stuff. Does she really need all of that? I mean, I don't think I've ever seen so much makeup.\nAthena:\nWhen it comes to sheer number of items, your desk back at the office isn't any better.\nApollo:\nThose things are the natural accumulation of two years of work, and they're all necessary.\nAthena:\nReally? Instant noodles and crackers?\nApollo:\nOf course! I need those for when I have to stay at the office all night prepping a case.\nAthena:\nAnd the comic books, too?\nApollo:\nOh, um... O-Of course I need those, too. Manga these days are super realistic and informative. I need them for research...\nAthena:\nUh-huh. I see. So you need to research street fighting and the funnies, do you?\nScript\nApollo:\nWhat's this? A script of the show? It says \"Bonny,\" so it must belong to that bunny assistant we saw in the show. You and I got to see the first two parts, up to the end of the 10:20 AM segment. But this \"Mr. Reus's fire trick\"... We didn't get to see that part.\nAthena:\nYeah, because they canceled the show after the accident.\nApollo:\nHey, there's a note about the fire trick. \"This will be dangerous. Make sure the fire bucket is ready!\" Come to think of it, when Mr. Reus turned into a dragon, it breathed fire, didn't it?\nAthena:\nCoin tricks and fire tricks were Mr. Reus's specialties. Maybe they had some big finale planned... ...where Mr. Reus and Trucy would face off in a grand magical showdown after his revival.\nShow Script added to the Court Record.\nScript (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nWhat's this?

I bet they're all Trucy's.\nAthena:\nOoh, could you tell by the scent? Are you like, some kind of bloodhound or something?\nApollo:\nI'm her \"assistant,\" not her pet!\nPresent\nThirteen-Year-Old Poster\nAthena:\nIt's a shame Troupe Gramarye won't ever be as they were back in their heyday...\nApollo:\nYeah... But I have every faith Trucy will restore the troupe to its former glory.\nAthena:\nAnd then you'll be REALLY busy as Trucy's assistant...\nApollo:\nYeah, I guess so...\nAthena:\nWait, did you just agree with me?\nApollo:\n(Ack! Why DID I agree?!)\nAthena:\nI guess it means you're finally settling into the role!\nApollo:\nN- No, it doesn't!\nTrucy's Notebook\nAthena:\nA mysterious, locked notebook... I wonder if there's anything about me in there! Like that one time I ate her pudding... I wonder if she was mad at me for doing that.\nApollo:\nDon't worry. If there's one thing I know about Trucy, it's that... ...she's more mature than some people I know.\nAfter examining blue handbag, posters, and script, then examining Mr. Reus's props:\nAthena:\nWell, we've examined just about everything, I think! Looking through other people's stuff was so thrilling -- like I'm doing something naughty!\nApollo:\nI know what you mean. Just don't go poking around in my things at the office!\nAthena:\nWhy? What do you have to hide?\nApollo:\n(I don't think I like how her eyes lit up all of a sudden...) Anyway, we'd better get this notebook to Trucy.\nPenrose Theater\nPresent\nThirteen-Year-Old Poster\nEma:\nIt's weird, but I keep running into the name \"Troupe Gramarye\" over the years.\nAthena:\nMaybe it's fate. Have you ever considered joining them? You could use your expertise in forensics to do scientific magic!\nEma:\nYou're not thinking of stuff like picking the right card using fingerprint powder, are you?\nApollo:\nHa ha ha! You can hardly call that \"magic,\" Athena!\nAthena:\nA-ha ha... Yeah, I guess not...\nApollo:\n(Looks like we hit the nail right on the head...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options with Ema Skye in Penrose Theater:\nApril 27Penrose Theater - Stage\nApollo:\nAll right. Let's get down to investigating, shall we?\nEma:\nJust make sure you don't move anything or I'll get in big trouble!\nApollo:\nFine. I promise... (...to only move the things I have to.)\nEma:\nWell, I have my own investigation to conduct, but let me know if you need anything.\nApollo:\nIt's been a while since we've done any investigating.\nAthena:\nWell? What are we waiting for? Let's dive right in! You DO remember how to do this, right? If you don't, I can give you a quick rundown.\nApollo:\n(Should I have Athena give me a rundown?)\nGuess I should\nApollo:\nYeah, I guess I could use a refresher course.\nAthena:\nThen take a seat, Mr. Justice! Professor Cykes here's gonna learn you a thing or two!\nApollo:\nOh, brother. What did I get myself into?\nAthena:\nDo you remember how to go about examining a crime scene?\nApollo:\nLet's see. I just place the cursor over what I want to \"Examine\" and press [A / Space], right? (Changed from [Let's see. I just touch whatever I want to examine, right?] in the original release)* (Line [Either that, or I can place the cursor over it and press A.] removed in the Trilogy release) How'd I do?\nAthena:\nHrmph, hrmph. I suppose that's acceptable. What else do you know about examining?\nApollo:\nIf I recall correctly, we can also take a closer look at certain notable areas or objects.\nAthena:\nVery good! Now, do you know how to change perspectives? (Changed from [Ten points to House Justice! Now, do you know how to change perspectives?] in the original release)\nApollo:\nWith [right analog stick left / left arrow key] and [right analog stick right / right arrow key], I think. (Changed from [Touch the arrows on the Touch Screen, press left or right on [D-Pad], right?] in the original release) By changing our perspective, we might even find some new evidence.\nAthena:\nMarvelous, Apollo! Top of the class! I'm proud to have such a model student! And thanks to you, Professor Cykes here just remembered how to investigate, too!\nApollo:\nYou could've just asked!\nLeads to options\nI'm okay\nApollo:\nDon't worry about me! I've got it all locked away in the vault up here!\nAthena:\nAnd I'm sure it'll all come back to me, too, as we go along.\nApollo:\n...Wait, wasn't it YOU who just offered to give ME a rundown?\nLeads to options\nExamine\nBackdrop\nApollo:\nOh, hey. This is a curtain. I wonder what's behind it.\nEma:\nThe backstage area. There's magic equipment and stuff like that back there.\nApollo:\n............ (I'll open it a crack and check it out later...)\nEma:\n...You weren't thinking of opening that curtain, were you?\nApollo:\nWh-Who me? Ha... ha ha! Would I ever do a thing like that? (Rats. Guess I'll have to ask her to open it for me later.)\nVideo camera\nApollo:\nThat video camera is pointed right at the stage. I wonder what it recorded? I want to take a peek, but Ema would...\nEma:\nWow... This residue data is so fascinating! Hee hee hee!\nApollo:\n(She's so fixated on that bloodstain data, her eyes are getting bloodshot...)\nAthena:\nQuick, Apollo -- while Ema's off in forensics fantasyland... ...let's see what's recorded on the camera!\nApollo:\nIt's the same video we saw on TV where you can't see the body at all.\nAthena:\nApollo, did you notice a strange shadow in that footage?\nApollo:\nNo, why?\nAthena:\nI don't think it was my imagination, but I'm pretty sure I saw something...\nApollo:\n(A strange shadow, huh? I wonder what it was.)\nVideo camera (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nI want to take another look at that footage, but Ema's right there.\nAthena:\nYou just leave this one to me -- Athena Cykes: Human Whisperer! Oh, Eeemaaaaa! Could you teach me how to find fingerprints?\nEma:\nCould I ever! I like your moxy, girl! Here, now watch carefully. What you do is...\nApollo:\n(Nice work, Athena! Now's my chance...)\nApollo:\n(I really want to check out that shadow. I sure wish I could take this video with me, but I guess I'd better not...)\nSword stand (before examining front of dragon prop, or subsequent times)\nApollo:\nThere's a sword here... It's covered in blood. Must be the murder weapon.\nAthena:\nTrucy said she was sure she switched it out with the rubber sword.\nApollo:\nUnfortunately, this one certainly doesn't look like it's made of rubber... Hey, Ema? Were there any fingerprints on the sword?\nEma:\nLet's see... According to my data... ...no prints were found. But that could be because the culprit wiped them off.\nApollo:\n(Come to think of it, Trucy was wearing gloves during the show. So she certainly wouldn't have left any prints either...)\nSword stand (after examining front of dragon prop)\nApollo:\nThere's a sword here... It's covered in blood.

You're making that weird thinking face again.\nApollo:\n(How did what should have been a rubber sword get switched with a metal one? Plus, the timing of that dragon set piece falling down... Wasn't that just a little too convenient? Something just isn't sitting right.)\nAthena:\nGround control to Major Apollo! Can you hear me, Major Apollo?\nApollo:\n...Athena! I think I've got it! I think somebody switched Trucy's rubber sword for the metal one.\nAthena:\nHuh?\nApollo:\nTo pin the murder on her.\nAthena:\nSomeone switched the swords? But when could they have done that?\nApollo:\nWhen everyone was too busy to notice. Somebody could have switched Trucy's rubber sword with a metal one...\nRight before the trick\nApollo:\nThey could've switched the swords right before Trucy's trick.\nAthena:\nWhat? But wouldn't that mean... ...Trucy herself stabbed the victim with the metal sword?\nApollo:\n...Exactly. And that's why it COULDN'T have been right before Trucy's trick. Very good, Athena. You managed to avoid my little trap.\nAthena:\n...Apollo, do you really think you can pull the wool over my eyes so easily?\nApollo:\nH-Heh, heh... There's no fooling you, is there...?\nAthena:\nCould the swords have been switched at some other point in time?\nLeads back to:\n\"Somebody could have switched Trucy's rubber sword with a metal one...\"\nAfter the set piece fell\nLeads to:\n\"After the set piece fell, everybody in the audience was kicked out of the theater.\"\nDuring Trucy's trick\nApollo:\nDuring Trucy's trick, maybe?\nAthena:\nHmm... And how would they have done that?\nApollo:\nWell, they would just... Er... Hmm... ...If I knew how they did it, I could be a magician, too.\nAthena:\nIn other words, you have absolutely no idea.

(Now, if we could just figure out who it is...)\nFront of dragon prop (before examining sword stand, or subsequent times)\nApollo:\nThis is what they call a \"set piece.\" It's a piece of the onstage scenery. It suddenly fell down after the body was revealed, if I remember correctly.\nAthena:\nJust as the brave heroine screams, the spell on the dragon breaks... Losing its wings, the dragon falls to the ground... That moment marked the collapse of Trucy's magical kingdom...\nApollo:\nMagic, huh... Yeah, sure.

I can't tell you how many hours I put into that freaking thing.\nAthena:\nWhat? You made it?!\nApollo:\nTrucy had me help put it together. You know, as her \"assistant\"...\nAthena:\n...She has you wrapped around her little finger, doesn't she.\nApollo:\n(Trucy's smile has some kind of magical power that makes it impossible to say no...)\nBox with swords\nAthena:\nOoh! I've seen something like this before! It's like that game where you stick swords into a barrel until a little man inside pops up.\nApollo:\nHuh, that doesn't sound like any game I've ever heard of.\nAthena:\nReally? It's pretty famous in Europe... Did you have ANYTHING to play with as a kid?\nApollo:\nOh, you know us simple Americans -- we're happy with just a hoop and a stick.\nZig-zag box\nAthena:\nWe have one of these in the office, too, don't we?\nApollo:\nYeah, that poor magic prop we use as a shelving unit. I'd kinda like to see Trucy perform this trick sometime...\nAthena:\nWell, we both know you'd be the one in the box if she ever did.\nApollo:\nI feel bad for the prop, but... ...it can stay a shelving unit, in that case.\nEma Skye\nApollo:\nUm, Ema, can I ask you a question?\nEma:\nShh! This is the best part!\nApollo:\n(She won't even look this way.)\nEma:\nOoh, what great prints! Another set for my collection! Hee hee hee!\nAthena:\nShe, uh... certainly seems to enjoy her work, doesn't she?\nCollapsed coffin or body outline\nApollo:\nSo this is the coffin the dead body appeared from.\nEma:\nI actually haven't examined that yet. Would you two mind giving me a hand?\nAthena:\nNo sweat!\nApollo:\nTrucy said the coffin was supposed to be empty when she stabbed it. So how did the victim even get in there?\nAthena:\nI bet there's a secret door or something.\nApollo:\nIt sure is an oddly shaped thing, isn't it? Who knew it could unfold into something like this?\nEma:\nWell, I heard that since it's used for magic tricks... ...the left and right panels are made to be interchangeable. How that helps with magic tricks, though, I have no idea.\nApollo:\nI'm sure they make use of it in some way we can't even imagine.\nBody outline\nApollo:\nA white outline, huh? So this is where the body was.\nAthena:\nWhat exactly did it look like just after the incident occurred, I wonder?\nEma:\nOh, I have a photo of the crime scene. Here you go.\nAthena:\nOh, wow... It looks like he was stabbed in the back.\nEma:\nYes, that's definitely what killed him.\nApollo:\nWhat's this thing around his waist?\nEma:\nIt's a stunt harness. A stunt wire can be attached to it so the person can float and fly through the air.\nApollo:\nCome to think of it, he did fly in Act One, didn't he.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nBody outline (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nA white outline, huh?

There's a secret door in the back panel of the coffin. Do you think Mr. Reus could have entered the coffin through there?\nApollo:\nIf he could've done it without Trucy noticing, then maybe.\nAthena:\nIt's like two magicians trying to out-magic one another right under each other's noses.\nBack panel (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nThere's a secret door in the back panel of the coffin, too. I wonder if Mr. Reus entered the coffin through there?\nBottom panel\nApollo:\nWait a minute. It looks like the bottom of the coffin opens, too.\nAthena:\nOoh, a secret door! Let's try opening it!\nApollo:\nWell, look at that...\nAthena:\nIt seems to lead to someplace under the stage.\nEma:\nThat's right. It goes to the understage passage.\nAthena:\nIt's pitch-black down there... Hold on. I think I see something glowing faintly. It's hard to make ANYTHING out from up here.\nEma:\nIf you try to go down there, the magicians will get mad at you. Apparently, there are things down there that will give away the secrets behind their tricks.\nAthena:\nWell, that sucks. It's all right there and we can't even check it out?\nApollo:\nWe're definitely gonna have to examine that understage passage at some point, though.\nBottom panel (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nSo this is how Trucy pulled her Great Escape trick off, huh. She went through this hole and down into the understage passage.\nAthena:\nLooking at it like this, the trick seems so simple.\nApollo:\nI remember Trucy saying once that... ...making a simple trick seem mysterious and magical is the hallmark of a great magician.\nAthena:\nKind of like how pulling off the most amazing bluffs is the hallmark of a great lawyer, huh!\nCollapsed coffin or body outline (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nLet's check it out up close.\nPresent\nCrime Photo\nAthena:\nThe victim was a popular magician, \"The Great Mr. Reus\"...\nApollo:\nWas this Mr. Reus really all that famous?\nAthena:\nYeah -- he was especially well-known for his \"time reversal\" tricks. He could turn even a fully-grown chicken back into a baby chick!\nApollo:\nWow. I wish I could've seen that...\nAfter examining backdrop, video camera, sword stand, front of dragon prop, body outline, back panel, and bottom panel:\nApollo:\nLet's see. What else do we need to do on this stage? Ema, did you find any fingerprints on the coffin?\nEma:\nActually, I haven't checked yet. I was going to do that at the end. I like to save the best for last!\nApollo:\nUh, we aren't exactly talking about dessert here.\nEma:\nOh, but we are! Would you like to partake in my delicious dessert? I don't mind sharing.\nAthena:\nOh, yes, please! There's always room for dessert, right?!\nApollo:\nAll right... I guess I'll join you two.\nApollo:\nSo, could you show us how you check for prints, Ema?\nEma:\nSure. Let's start with the basics. As you know, fingerprints are an excellent way of identifying someone. That's because no two people have the same set of fingerprints -- not even twins.\nApollo:\nSo if we find any prints on the coffin, they might lead us to the killer.\nEma:\nIf the culprit was dumb enough to leave prints behind -- sure. Let's go ahead and dust for prints now. Let's see... This looks like a promising spot. Try dusting the area with fingerprint powder. Move the cursor around and keep pressing [A / Space] until it's thoroughly covered in powder. (Changed from [Keep tapping the Touch Screen until the powder covers the surface thoroughly.] in the original release) When you're done, \"Blow\" with [X / Y / R] to get rid of the excess powder. (Changed from [When you're done, blow into the mic to get rid of the excess powder.] in the original release) The powder in this bottle is all we have to work with. If you run out, try blowing on the area. Any excess powder will be returned to the bottle. (Changed from [If you run out, try blowing into the mic. Any excess powder will be returned to the bottle.] in the original release)\nApollo:\nAll right. I think I'm ready to give it a try.\nObtain faint handprint\nLeads to:\n\"You found some prints. Looks like the fingers of somebody's left hand.\"\nEma:\nYou found some prints. Looks like the fingers of somebody's left hand. Now, let's try comparing these with the ones we have on file. First, switch to \"Analyze\" mode with [L / LB / Q] to select a print. (Changed from [First, touch \"Analyze\" (L) to select a print.] in the original release)\nSwitch to analysis\nLeads to:\n\"Next, select the print you want to analyze and \"Confirm\" it with [A / Space].\"\nEma:\nNext, select the print you want to analyze and \"Confirm\" it with [A / Space]. (Changed from [Next, select the print you want to analyze and touch \"Confirm\" (X).] in the original release)\nExamine any fingerprint\nLeads to:\n\"I've got a pretty clear print here. I wonder whose it is.\"\nApollo:\nI've got a pretty clear print here. I wonder whose it is.\nEma:\nI have the prints of everyone involved in the case right here. Just choose the person whose prints you'd like to compare the sample against.\nApollo:\nWell, the last person who was in the coffin was...\nCompare The Great Mr. Reus profile\nAnalyzing...Analysis CompleteMatch Found\nLeads to:\n\"Bingo. Looks like the prints belong to the deceased, Mr. Reus.\"\nCompare anyone else\nAnalyzing...No Match Found\nEma:\n...You seriously thought THAT was the last person in the coffin?\nApollo:\nI just wanted to see what would happen if I picked the wrong person, that's all.\nEma:\nYeah, right. Anyway... If you're done with your little experiment, would you care to try again?\nApollo:\nYes, please... Let's see... The last person who was in the coffin was...\nLeads back to profile selection\nEma:\nBingo. Looks like the prints belong to the deceased, Mr. Reus.\nApollo:\nWell, if we found prints here... ...maybe we can find them elsewhere on the coffin, too. (Guess I'll try dusting for more prints.)\nExamine any complete fingerprint\nLeads to:\n\"There. I found some!\"\nExamine any incomplete fingerprint\nEma:\nThere's not enough powder on this print -- it's too faint to analyze. Let's use a different, clearer print.\nExamine excess powder\nEma:\nThere's too much powder stuck to this print, making it impossible to analyze. Let's use a different, clearer print.\nApollo:\nThere. I found some!\nEma:\nThese prints are apparently Mr. Reus's, too. Shall we try looking for prints on the outside of the coffin now?\nApollo:\nYes, let's.\nEma:\nThis time, you'll be able to rotate the coffin and look at it from different angles. That'll give you a chance to examine it thoroughly. You can use [right analog stick / arrow keys] to turn the coffin in any which way you'd like... (Line added in the Trilogy release) and holding [R / RB / E] while using [right analog stick / arrow keys] will let you jump right to where the action is! (Line added in the Trilogy release) If you ever get stuck or confused... ...you can always reset things with [right analog stick button / N]. (Changed from [...you can always touch \"Reset.\"] in the original release)\nApollo:\nOkay. And if I find any prints, I'll choose one to run against your data -- just like before.\nExamine any fingerprint on either side of lid (before examining fingerprint on top)\nApollo:\nI found another print! Judging from its position and location... ...it might've been made when someone put this lid on the coffin. Let's see, now... There was one part during the show where someone put this lid on... ...after Trucy had gotten into the coffin. Therefore, this print should belong to...\nCompare Bonny profile\nAnalyzing...Analysis CompleteMatch Found\nLeads to:\n\"Looks like the print belongs to that bunny girl.\"\nCompare Trucy Wright profile\nAnalyzing...No Match Found\nApollo:\nNo good, huh...\nAthena:\nBecause Trucy was wearing gloves, remember? She couldn't have left any prints.\nApollo:\nRight. Let's see... The person who closed the coffin with this lid during the show was...\nLeads back to profile selection\nCompare anyone else\nAnalyzing...No Match Found\nApollo:\nGuess it wasn't that person.\nEma:\nSince the print is on the lid of the coffin... ...it's got to be someone who had a chance to touch it.\nApollo:\nRight. Let's see... The person who closed the coffin with this lid during the show was...\nLeads back to profile selection\nEma:\nLooks like the print belongs to that bunny girl.\nAthena:\nCome to think of it... ...she DID put the lid on the coffin during the show.\nApollo:\nThat's probably when she left her print on the lid. Now, then. I wonder if I can find any more prints...\nExamine any fingerprint on either side of lid (after examining fingerprint on top)\nApollo:\nI found another print! Judging from its position and location... ...it might've been made when someone put this lid on the coffin. Let's see, now...

I got a print!\nEma:\nAll right. I'll just check it against my data... Huh? That's funny. It doesn't match the prints of anyone involved in this case.\nApollo:\nReally? None of them? (How can that be?) Now, then. I wonder if I can find any more prints...\nExamine fingerprint on top (after examining any fingerprint on either side of lid)\nApollo:\nThere. I got a print!\nEma:\nAll right. I'll just check it against my data... Huh? That's funny. It doesn't match the prints of anyone involved in this case.\nApollo:\nReally? None of them? (How can that be?)\nLeads to:\n\"It looks like that's about all the prints we're going to find.\"\nExamine palm print\nApollo:\nHow's this, Ema?\nEma:\nThat print is from the base of the palm. You want to get prints from the fingers or the thumb, so why don't you give it another try?\nExamine any incomplete fingerprint\nEma:\nThis print is too faint for analysis. Try applying some more powder to it.\nExamine excess powder\nEma:\nThere's still too much powder left on this print. Try blowing some more of it off.\nEma:\nIt looks like that's about all the prints we're going to find. To sum everything up, the prints we found belong to... ...the victim Mr. Reus, the bunny assistant Bonny... ...and some third, unidentified person.\nAthena:\nBut that's strange. We didn't see anybody else up there on that stage during the show... Does this mean some outsider was up there -- somebody unrelated to the show?\nApollo:\nHmm... I guess we can't really say at this point...\nEma:\nWell, thank goodness we didn't find any of Trucy's fingerprints, right?\nApollo:\n(But that's only because Trucy was wearing gloves.) Hey, Ema, there's something else that's been bothering me about the prints... Don't you think there's something odd about Mr. Reus's prints?\nEma:\nOdd? What's odd about them?\nApollo:\nWell, if Mr. Reus was standing in the coffin facing forward... ...he would've left prints like this, right? But when we look at the actual prints... ...they're facing backwards. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\nEma:\nHey, what do you know! You're right! I wonder how they wound up like that.\nAthena:\nMaybe he was accidentally facing the wrong way at first, but then turned around later?\nApollo:\nNo, the coffin is much too small for a guy his size to turn around in. About all he would've been able to manage is maybe a little bit of twisting.\nAthena:\nThen it really doesn't make any sense, does it!\nApollo:\n(I think I might've hit on something major here...) ......Oh, I have just one more question, Ema.\nEma:\nOh, yeah? What is it?\nApollo:\nMr. Reus was stabbed in the back, right? But if he was standing in the coffin like this... ...how would that have worked?\nEma:\nOh, right. That. The lead prosecutor has an explanation, actually. He thought that the victim might've tried to dodge the sword as it came into the coffin... ...so maybe he twisted his body and the sword ended up stabbing him in the back. That's his theory, anyway.\nApollo:\nI see... (I guess that sounds plausible...)\nFingerprinting Results added to the Court Record.\nApollo:\nWell, guess that about wraps up our investigation of the stage.\nAthena:\nActually... there's still the area behind that curtain... Don't you want to know what's back there?\nApollo:\nSure do. But Ema told us not to move or touch anything, remember? ............\nEma:\n............Would you quit staring at me?! Fine. I'll go open it for you.\nAthena:\nWow, look at you, flaunting your lady-killer eyes.\nApollo:\nA-ha ha. I have my ways!\nEma:\nI'm only doing this so I won't get charged with animal abuse for not throwing you a bone.\nAthena:\nI guess puppy eyes can be just as effective.\nApollo:\n............\nEma:\nAll right, I'll be back. Well, go on and investigate to your hearts' content. But before you go moving anything...\nApollo:\nI know, I know -- we'll be sure to ask first.\nEma:\nOh, by the way... Just \"Examine\" the backstage to move to the area beyond the curtain.\nApollo:\n(Okay! Time to get investigating!)\nExamine\nBackstage\nAthena:\nSeeing the stage this way kind of breaks the illusion, doesn't it?\nApollo:\nIt just goes to show that some things are better left unseen.\nAthena:\nOoh, listen to you -- sounding all grown-up and stuff!\nApollo:\nDon't worry. I'm sure you'll have some cynical one-liners of your own someday, too.\nAthena:\nOh, boy... I can't wait.\nApollo:\nAnyway, on to more pressing matters. Let's go examine the backstage area.\nWinch (before examining large pulley, small pulley, cushions, and Mr. Hat)\nAthena:\nWhat is this thing?\nApollo:\nIt's a winch. I'm guessing they used it to pull Mr. Hat up. Oh, look. There are two winches -- one back there, and one up here.\nEma:\nApparently, each winch was rigged up to something different. One of them was used to hold up the dragon set piece... ...while the other was connected to that weird puppet up in the catwalk.\nApollo:\nA \"weird puppet,\" huh? (We'd better go check out the catwalk later.)\nWinch (before examining large pulley, small pulley, cushions, and Mr. Hat; subsequent times)\nApollo:\nOf the two winches, one is connected to the dragon set piece......while the other seems to be connected to the weird puppet on the catwalk. Guess we'll have to go up there to check it out eventually.\nWinch (after examining large pulley, small pulley, cushions, and Mr. Hat)\nAthena:\nWhat is this thing?\nApollo:\nIt's a winch. I'm guessing they used it to pull Mr. Hat up. Oh, look. There are two winches -- one back there, and one up here.\nEma:\nApparently, each winch was rigged up to something different. One of them was used to hold up the dragon set piece... ...while the other was connected to that weird puppet up in the catwalk.\nApollo:\nI think you mean Mr. Hat, Ema.\nWinch (after examining large pulley, small pulley, cushions, and Mr. Hat; subsequent times)\nApollo:\nThe wires from the winches have been pulled up through the catwalk. One of them is connected to the dragon... ...while the other is connected to Mr. Hat.\nBucket\nAthena:\nA dustpan, a broom, and a bucket. Guess they use these to keep the stage tidy.\nApollo:\nI doubt that's what this bucket is for, though. See how it says \"FIRE\" on it?\nAthena:\nOh. I guess it's a fire bucket, then.\nEma:\nYes, I heard the theater owner went out and bought that just for this show. When he heard there was going to be a fire trick, he flew to the store to get it.\nApollo:\nBut can a little bucket like this really put out a raging fire?\nEma:\nI'm guessing the owner thought it could.\nAthena:\nBut it doesn't look like it's been used. In fact, the inside is caked with dust. What was the point of even buying the bucket, then?!\nApollo:\n(Wait a minute. That means nobody actually prepared for the fire trick after all... Hmm... I have a feeling this might be an important bit of information...)\nFire Bucket added to the Court Record.\nBucket (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nA dustpan, a broom, and a bucket. Guess they use these to keep the stage tidy.\nApollo:\nI doubt that's what this bucket is for, though. See how it says \"FIRE\" on it?\nAthena:\nOh. I guess it's a fire bucket, then.\nEma:\nYes, I heard the theater owner went out and bought that just for this show.

In fact, the inside is caked with dust. What was the point of even buying the bucket, then?!\nApollo:\n(Wait a minute. That means nobody actually prepared for the fire trick after all... Hmm... I have a feeling this might be an important bit of information...)\nBackstage coffin\nApollo:\nHey, there's a coffin back here, too. It looks like there's a stuffed dragon inside.\nAthena:\nNo wait, look. It's just an illusion. See? The dragon looks like it's inside... ...but it's really just painted on the front lid.\nApollo:\nOh, wow! You're right! That's really something else.\nAthena:\nIf the show hadn't been canceled, we might've gotten to see this trick, too, huh.\nGuillotine\nAthena:\nIt's a guillotine. But it's not real -- it's just another one of Trucy's props.\nApollo:\nI wonder if it was supposed to appear in the show.\nAthena:\nHuh? You mean she didn't mention it to you? She said you were going to make a guest appearance onstage for her guillotine trick.\nApollo:\nNo! I'd DEFINITELY remember not agreeing to something like losing my head on national TV!\n\"Understage\" sign\nApollo:\nThere's a sign here that says \"Understage.\" I bet these stairs go to the understage area.\nAthena:\nTrucy told me she and her fellow magicians call it \"the Abyss.\" I wonder why?\nApollo:\nWho knows. Maybe because it's really dark down there or something.\nAthena:\nOoh, I bet they've got all kinds of magical goodies stashed away down there. C'mon! Let's go check it out! Huh? The door's locked. The entrance to the abyss is barred to mere mortals like us, huh?\nApollo:\nOh, well. That's what you call \"a swing and abyss.\"\nLadder\nAthena:\nIt looks like this ladder leads to the catwalk overhead.\nApollo:\n(Do I really have to go up there...?) Why don't you go on up and check it out, Athena? I'm sure you'll like the air up there.\nAthena:\nHuh? Where in the world did you get that idea fro... Waaait a minute... Are you saying I'm an airhead?! How rude can you get?!\nApollo:\nA-ha ha... That's not what I'm saying at all. Now, up you go! I'll just wait down here...\nAthena:\n...Okay, NOW I'm starting to get the picture. You're afraid of heights, aren't you, Apollo?\nApollo:\n!\nAthena:\nCome on, now! This is for Trucy. She NEEDS us, so up to the catwalk we go!\nApollo:\n(W-Well, guess it's time to put on my big-boy pants...) ............\nAthena:\nAre you all right, Apollo? You're white as a sheet.\nApollo:\nHa, ha ha! I'm F-F-FINE! (Don't look down, Justice. Don't look down.)\nAthena:\nThose green things over there look like cushions. I guess one of them was used to absorb the force of impact when Mr. Hat zipped into it. Let's go check it out.\nApollo:\n(W- Way over there...?!)\nLarge pulley\nApollo:\nWow. That's a big pulley! Looks like it's connected to one of the winches down below.\nAthena:\nThe dragon set piece must've been hanging from this.\nSmall pulley\nApollo:\nIt looks like Mr. Hat is rigged to this smaller pulley. Let's see... How did it go? After being blown a kiss, Mr. Hat goes wild and... ...just as he's about to stab the coffin, he gets pulled up to the catwalk... ...and the smokescreen was to hide his ascent from the audience's view.\nSet pieces\nAthena:\nThese set pieces look like a rabbit and a moon. Although... they kinda look like they could be a duck and a croissant, too... What do they look like to you, Apollo?\nApollo:\n.........The Grim Reaper, and a guy falling to his death.\nAthena:\nC'mon, let's wrap up this investigation before your imagination catches up with you.\nCushions\nAthena:\nHey, look! There are cushions attached to the underside. Well, what are you standing way over there for? Come on over and look!\nApollo:\nYou're not gonna try and push me off, are you?!\nAthena:\nSeriously, Apollo? C'mon, you'll be fine. Here, do you want me to hold your hand?\nApollo:\nY-Yes, actually... if you wouldn't mind... Looks like you're right... And Trucy mentioned something about this, didn't she? That a cushion was supposed to absorb the force of impact when Mr. Hat was pulled up.\nMr. Hat\nAthena:\nHm? What's that? Look, Apollo! It's Mr. Hat!\nApollo:\nHe's attached to a wire. Actually, didn't Trucy say something like: They quickly raise Mr. Hat up by wire... ...into a cushion on the catwalk.\nAthena:\nMaybe the stagehands pulled Mr. Hat up and left him here afterwards?\nApollo:\nThat wire attached to his back... It looks like it's connected to one of the winches down below. Huh? Mr. Hat's cape is ripped. Did that happen during the show? That's odd... It almost looks like... it was slashed with a blade... How in the world did that happen?\nAthena:\nApollo, I see that you're trying to take this all in stride, and I respect that... ...but seriously, you're trembling like a newborn fawn up here!\nWidget:\nGet it together, man!\nApollo:\nI-I can't help it!\nAfter examining large pulley, small pulley, cushions, and Mr. Hat:\nAthena:\nWell, I think that about does it for the catwalk. Do you think we missed anyth--?\nApollo:\nNope! Uh-uh! Didn't miss a single thing! We're all done here, yes siree!\nAthena:\n...I take it you're ready to go down?\nApollo:\nYeah, I think we'd better. I feel a fainting spell coming on...\nAthena:\nOh, brother. You don't need me to hold your hand again, do you?\nBackstage (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nBack to the backstage.\nAfter examining winch, bucket, \"Understage\" sign, large pulley, small pulley, cushions, and Mr. Hat:\nEma:\nAll done?\nApollo:\nPretty much. There's just one thing: The door to the understage passage was locked. Any way we can get down there?\nEma:\nThat place? They locked it up as soon as we police finished our investigation down there. If you want to check it out, you'll have to ask a magician.\nApollo:\nWell, Trucy's at the detention center, so she can't help us. I guess we'll have to look for somebody else from the show.\nEma:\nOkay. And I'd better get back to my own investigation. See you around.\nApollo:\nIt's too bad about the understage area, but at least we learned a few things.\nAthena:\nYeah, like one of your greatest fears, heh heh!\nApollo:\nI-I wasn't talking about that... I meant how all the behind-the-scenes stuff is set up. Let's see... We found out there are two winches backstage. Mr. Hat was rigged to the first winch... ...and the dragon set piece was attached to the other one.\nAthena:\nAnd both of them were used during the show. Right after the body was discovered, the dragon set piece fell to the stage.\nApollo:\nAnd in the chaos that ensued... ...the culprit could have switched the rubber sword with the real one. (So it looks like the best way to prove Trucy's innocence... ...is to identify the real killer.)\n???:\nWhat a complete and utter mess! This is all great! Just great! That Wright kid is bush league, small potatoes -- a half-grown has-been!\nApollo:\nHm? (There's somebody on the stage. I wonder who it is and what they're doing. Maybe we should go talk to them.)\nExamine\nMan\nLeads to:\n\"Excuse me. Are you connected to the show?\"\nApollo:\nExcuse me. Are you connected to the show?\n???:\nWhat, you two got a couple more headaches for me to handle? I got my hands full as it is.\nApollo:\n(Hey, I remember this guy...)\n???:\nHey, you there! What the heck's going on?! They wouldn't even let ME in. ME, for crying out loud!\nStaff:\nOh, Mr. Retinz! There was an accident during the show.\nRetinz:\nAn accident? Great, just great. That's all I need right now. Do you have any idea how much money we're sinking into this program?!\nApollo:\n(It's that man who was going off at the staff in front of the theater.)\nRetinz:\nI ain't never seen you guys before. If I had to guess, I'd say you're not production staff. Hm? What's that I spy with my little eye? An attorney's badge...? Well how dooo you dooo! I didn't know you fine folks were laaawyers! My business card, if you would. Chaaarmed to make your acquaintance, I'm suuure!\nApollo:\nOh, uh, thank you. So you're from the TV station I take it?\nRetinz:\nSharp as a tack, you are! I'm the producer of this TV special -- all myyyy idea, by the way.\nApollo:\nI'm Apollo Justice, Trucy Wright's defense attorney.\nRetinz:\n...Trucy Wright's....? Well ain't that a kick in the head. How about you open with that tidbit next time, champ?\nApollo:\nUh, okay? (What happened to the schmoozy magoo bit?)\nRetinz:\nI'm Roger Retinz. Hold the applause! And no autographs, kids -- I'm on the clock.\nAthena:\nApollo, this guy looks reeeeally familiar, but I can't quite...\nRetinz:\nReally, kid? Then try this on for size... Hang loose, baby!\nAthena:\n\"Hang loose, baby\"? ......*gasp!* Apollo! It's the Ratings Rajah! From Take-2 TV! He's huge! CRAZY HUGE! Like a real famous producer!\nApollo:\nReally? I've never heard of him.\nRetinz:\nSeriously, man? What kind of cave did you crawl out of? \"Roger Retinz, the Ratings Rajah -- Titan of the TV screen!\" Still not ringing a bell?! You ain't seen my hit Saturday night talk show at 8 PM eastern, 7 PM central?\nApollo:\nUh, no. I can't say that I have.\nRetinz:\nYou're blowing my mind, kid. You even know what a TV is? Say it with me: \"Teh-leh-vi-sion.\"\nApollo:\n...Um, do you mind if I ask you a few questions about the incident?\nRetinz:\nNo, no, no! What kind of comeback is that?! Grow some backbone, kid! I basically lobbed that one at you. Now hit me with your best barb! Viewers'll love that! C'mon -- you gotta sell it!\nApollo:\nSell what...?\nRetinz:\nSay something funny for the nice people at home! Go on, hit me with your best shot!\nApollo:\nM-My \"best shot\"?!\nRetinz:\nWe're rolling here! Hurry up before they change the channel! Chop, chop!\nApollo:\nUh, okay... Here goes... \"T-Talk to the hand! KA-POW!\"\nRetinz:\n............\nAthena:\n\"Ka-pow\"? Really? And why are you pointing all dramatically like we're in court?\nApollo:\nI-I dunno... It just seemed like the thing to do... Ha ha ha...\nAthena:\n............\nApollo:\n...Ha ha... Heh.\nAthena:\n............Apollo...\nRetinz:\nOof! That's going in the cringe reel for sure. I think we can all agree that was a mistake.\nApollo:\n(Ugh. If I choked any harder I'd need the Heimlich maneuver.)\nRetinz:\nI blame myself, really. Should've known better than to waste good film on a nobody. ...So, you wanted an exclusive or what?\nTalk\nRoger Retinz\nApollo:\nToday's magic show was being broadcast live on TV, wasn't it? And you were the producer, right?\nRetinz:\nThat's right. Rising Magic Star versus Old-School Gramarye -- it was gonna be wild! We were gonna have viewers vote for their favorite magician during the show. And the loser would've had a really embarrassing prank done to them. It was gold, I tell you! Guaranteed ratings!\nApollo:\nI don't know... It sounds kind of tacky, if you ask me.\nRetinz:\nI'm telling you, man -- modern viewers eat this stuff up with a spoon! Trust me! All we gotta do is serve it up nice and hot. A feast for the eyes!\nApollo:\n(More like junk food for the brain.)\nRetinz:\nBut that little brat had to go and ruin everything with that accident of hers! You have any idea how many times they dragged me over here to prepare for today?!\nApollo:\n(Hmm... He must know this theater pretty well if he came by that often...)\nRetinz:\nOoh! That gives me an idea! How 'bout this?! \"Mad Mindscape of a Magical Murderess! Closest Comrades Come Clean!\" Tell me, has Trucy always shown signs of being unhinged?\nRetinz [on cue card]:\nGIVE ME THE LOWDOWN!\nRetinz:\nWhen could you tell she was about ready to snap?\nAthena:\nThis guy's cruisin' for a bruisin', Apollo!\nApollo:\nAs long as you don't get caught on camera...\nRetinz:\nTruth be told, I'm not surprised about the way things turned out. Magicians are pretty much the dregs of society, am I right?\nApollo:\nWhat's that supposed to mean?\nThe incident\nApollo:\nWhat were you doing at the time of the incident?\nRetinz:\nShooting a show in the station's studio. We had a whole bunch of girls in bikinis wrestle each other for the camera.\nApollo:\nSo you didn't see the accident as it actually happened?\nRetinz:\nThat's right. That's why I was shocked when I first got here.\nApollo:\n(So he didn't hear about the accident until he arrived, huh?)\nRetinz:\n...I'm guessing what you really want to know is whether or not I have an alibi, am I right? My staff at the TV studio can vouch for me. Why not go there and ask them yourself? You can give 'em my card, and they'll let you in.\nApollo:\nSo you have an alibi, huh? Good to know.\nMagicians (appears after \"Roger Retinz\")\nRetinz:\nMagicians are all a bunch of good-for-nothings, if you ask me! Con artists and thieves is what they are! They trick people and take their money!\nApollo:\n............ (Coming from you, that's rich, pal.)\nAthena:\nMagic tricks aren't the same as con jobs, you know!\nApollo:\nThat's right! The people watching never feel like they've been cheated!\nRetinz:\n\"Lawyers spout hypocritical nonsense. Big surprise there, lol\" ...Aaaand \"Post\"!\nAthena:\nDid he just post about us in real time?!\nRetinz:\nThose Gramaryes are all criminals! It's in their blood. Trucy Wright ain't no different! That girl is no good! She may look all sweet and innocent, but she's a stone-cold killer!\nAthena:\nDon't you dare talk about Trucy like that! You don't know the first thing about her! You won't find a sweeter, harder-working girl anywhere, period!\nRetinz:\nHa ha ha! She's got the wool pulled over your eyes, I see!\nApollo:\nWhat in the world are you talking about?\nRetinz:\nYou'll see! I'll dig up the dirt and expose the dark heart behind that sweet smile. I'll prove those Gramarye magicians are all a bunch of low-lifes.\nApollo:\n(Does he have a grudge against Trucy? Or maybe against all of Troupe Gramarye?)\nRetinz:\nTV is a window to the truth! It's not like that magic stuff, or the streetwise charlatans that perform it!\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nApollo:\nHere. Take a look at this.\nRetinz:\nWhat are you showing me that for? What, you want me to do a special on you guys? \"It's a Lawyer-ful Life: Justice in the Courtroom!\"\nApollo:\nThat doesn't sound half-bad, actually...\nAthena:\nPlus, it'd get some publicity for the agency! Count us in, Mr. Retinz!\nRetinz:\nAll right, then let's jump right into it. Eh-hem. \"What made you decide to become lawyers?\"\nRetinz [on cue card]:\nSAY SOMETHING DUMB!!\nApollo:\nHuh? S-\"Say something dumb\"...? I, uh...\nRetinz:\nNow it's your turn! Jump in with a snappy comeback!\nRetinz [on cue card]:\nLAY DOWN A SICK BURN!\nAthena:\nWhat? \"Lay down a sick burn\"? Me?\nRetinz:\nYou two... I'm practically falling asleep over here! Where's the drama? The gravitas? How're you gonna draw in viewers with that yawn-fest? Work on your delivery and get back to me!\nApollo:\nHuh? Y-Yeah, okay, sure...\nAthena:\nI think he's confusing actors and attorneys...\nAnything else\nRetinz:\nIs that a scoop? No? Then get it out of my face! Who's gonna tune in to see something like that?\nApollo:\n(Does this guy judge everything by potential TV ratings?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nRetinz:\nIt's a shame -- a crying shame, I tell you! What was supposed to be a fun, light-hearted program turned into this sorry affair... I'll have to sell it to news outlets all over the world if I'm gonna make my money back. Trucy Wright will make her debut, all right -- not as a magician, but as a criminal!\nApollo:\nWH-WHAAAAT?!\nRetinz:\nIt's my duty to report it! Can't let a tragedy like this happen again, now can I?! Even if she gets off somehow, I'll make sure she never walks the streets again!\nApollo:\nWe won't let that happen -- we won't let you do that to her. We're going to prove her innocence in court.\nRetinz:\nHmph! Listen to you, acting all high-and-mighty! You're just another money-grubber! I know how you lawyers do things! You'll stop at nothing to win!\nApollo:\nI beg your pardon?\nRetinz:\nIf you win your trials, you get fat stacks, right? Is money really all you care about?!\nAthena:\nWhat's with him, Apollo? Why won't he listen?\nRetinz:\nBut enough about you -- I'm all about going after Trucy now. I won't stop until she's behind bars. That's how we in the media dish out justice! Before you even get to court, my expos\u00e9 is gonna take you down!\nApollo:\n(Not if I have anything to say about it!)\nRetinz:\nWelp, gotta get back to the station. Hang loose, baby!\nApollo:\nIt looks like the prosecution won't be our only opponent this time.\nAthena:\nBut no way are we gonna let that guy have his way, either!\nApollo:\nThat's right! Okay, we're done with this stage, so let's go someplace else. (I still wish we could check out that understage passage... But what else can we investigate right now?)\nApril 27Penrose Theater - Dressing Room\nIf moving from any other location upon examining blue handbag, posters, and script, then examining Mr. Reus's props in Penrose Theater - Dressing Room, then clearing all Talk options with Roger Retinz in Penrose Theater - Stage\nApollo:\n(About all that's left to check out is that understage passage. We'll have to try to get one of the staff members to unlock the door.) Hm? Someone just came into the dressing room.\n???:\nOh, it's you people again! You came back.\nApollo:\nHuh?\nLeads to:\n\"I... I saw you, you know.\"\n???:\nI... I saw you, you know.\nAthena:\nOh, it's you! The bunny assistant from the show, right?\nBonny:\nWhat? Oh, um, yes, that's right. .........My name is Bonny de Famme.\nApollo:\n(I remember her talking to us earlier...)\nBonny:\nPerforming magic is like walking a tightrope -- there's always an element of danger. One little mistake can even cost you your life, you know. I wonder if she'll make it across today...\nApollo:\nUmm... and what do you mean by that, exactly?\nBonny:\nHee hee. Oh, nothing! Now, if you'll excuse me...\nApollo:\n(She said some pretty strange things then...)\nBonny:\nI... I saw you take it. Y-You took something from our dressing room... The, um...\nAthena:\nOh, Bonny! That teleportation trick you did was AMAZING! Fantastisch!\nBonny:\nWhat? Oh, um, thank you! But what you did... S-Stealing is...\nAthena:\nWhat other kinds of magic tricks can you do?\nBonny:\nMe? Oh, well... H-How about this?\nAthena:\nSplendido!\nApollo:\nAthena, I think Bonny's trying to say something to us.\nAthena:\nShe is?\nBonny:\nThank you, Mr. Thief.\nApollo:\nThief?!\nBonny:\nI saw you. I saw you take that notebook. Please don't take things from our dressing room.\nApollo:\nHuh?!\nBonny:\nSo it's true what they say... Thieves really do return to the scene of the crime, don't they?\nApollo:\n(Thieves? I thought it was just arsonists in real life...)\nAthena:\nGuess that means she really saw us, huh.\nApollo:\nI bet this looks pretty bad...\nBonny:\nIf you return what you stole right now, I won't call the police.\nApollo:\n(Oh, boy...) You've got it all wrong -- we're Trucy's lawyers. She asked us to bring the notebook to her.\nBonny:\nT-Trucy's lawyers? Oh! I'm so sorry I called you thieves!\nApollo:\nIf you really thought we were thieves, why were you still doing magic tricks for us?\nBonny:\nI can't help it. Whenever anybody asks, I just can't bring myself to refuse...\nApollo:\n(Does that mean she's a real people-person or that she aims to please a little too hard?)\nAthena:\nIn that case, can you tell us the secret to your teleportation trick?\nBonny:\nW-Well... I don't know if I should... Oooh.\nAthena:\nIf I keep up the pressure, she just might tell us! I've been dying to know!\nApollo:\nLeave the poor girl alone.\nBonny:\nAre you... investigating the case...?\nApollo:\nYes, that's right.\nBonny:\nI'm Trucy's biggest fan! I just love her to bits! I'd do anything to help her!\nApollo:\nWe appreciate that. In that case, would you mind if we asked you a few questions?\nTalk\nBonny\nApollo:\nYou're a magician, right, Bonny?\nBonny:\nThat's right! My specialties are teleportation and this little trick right here... ........L-Looks like Mr. Bunny's in a bad mood right now...\nApollo:\n(Or that she messed up...) You said you are a big fan of Trucy's, right?\nBonny:\nOh, yes! I look up to her more than anyone else in the whole world!\nApollo:\nWhat about her makes you respect her so much?\nBonny:\nShe's just incredible! Not only is she extremely talented... ...but she's so cool under pressure and always manages to keep a smile on her face! In spite of all that talent, she still works harder than anybody I know! You couldn't ask for more out of a magician!\nApollo:\n(I'm sensing a shift into hyper-fangirl drive...)\nBonny:\nI love the unique way she does her tricks, and how she charms the audience! I especially love her magic panties trick, which is both cute and comical! The first time I saw her do that trick, I was so impressed... and so moved... I've gone to her shows to see her perform so many times, I've lost count, and...\nBonny:\n...And that's why I think Trucy is top class -- a real first-rate magician!\nAthena:\n...I-I see. I think we have a pretty good idea of how much you adore her now.\nBonny:\nOh! W-Was I talking too much? I'm so sorry!\nApollo:\n(I'd better be careful about when and how I ask her about Trucy...)\nBonny:\nAnyway, that's why I'll do anything -- anything at all -- to help Trucy! Oh, Mr. Lawyer, you just have to prove her innocence!\nApollo:\nDon't worry, I plan to do just that. (I wish Trucy could see that she has people like Bonny in her corner, rooting for her.)\nThe show\nApollo:\nYou were in the magic show, right?\nBonny:\nThat's right. I take it you saw my teleportation trick?\nAthena:\nYes, it was just wonderful! You moved from one place to another in the blink of an eye!\nApollo:\nI admit it WAS pretty amazing. I have no idea how you transported yourself over such a distance in just a split-second.\nAthena:\nIt must be so fun to be able to do a trick like that! Teleportation looks so cool! It's like a superpower or something!\nBonny:\nYeah, my trick is turning some heads in the magic world right now. They're calling it \"new, miraculous magic.\" Some even say it's the real deal! Hee hee!\nApollo:\n(Real magic, huh? I know there must be an explanation, but it sure does look real.)\nAthena:\nI just have to figure that trick out... I want to do it myself!\nBonny:\nOh, you'll never figure it out. I always perform it perfectly!\nBRACELET THUMPS\nApollo:\nAh! (This feeling... Looks to me like Bonny is hiding something.)\nPresent Bracelet\nBonny:\nOh, you'll never figure it out. I always perform it perfectly!\nPerceive right hand lifting hat on \"perform it perfectly!\"\nApollo:\nApollo:\nBonny, when you said, \"perform it perfectly\"... ...your right hand would tremble and move your hat a tiny bit. I even caught a glimpse of the little rabbit hiding underneath.\nBonny:\nUlp!\nApollo:\nDid you really perform the teleportation trick perfectly this time?\nBonny:\nO-Of course! I definitely got THAT part right!\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean, \"THAT part\"?\nBonny:\nOops!\nApollo:\nWait a minute. Are you saying that you...?\nPicked the wrong career\nApollo:\nDoes that mean you regret ever choosing to become a magician? Is that why you perform your job with such a forced smile on your face? Is it to hide your true feelings of regret?\nBonny:\nWhat?!\nApollo:\nDo you feel like you made a mistake in your choice of career?\nBonny:\n...How can you even say that to me? I became a magician because I looked up to Trucy, and wanted to be like her. I'd never regret that decision!\nApollo:\nNo? Are you sure?\nBonny:\nMaybe YOU'RE the one in the wrong line of work, Mr. Lawyer!\nApollo:\nOuch! So I made ONE mistake! Look, if what you messed up wasn't the teleportation trick, then...\nLeads back to:\n\"Wait a minute. Are you saying that you...?\"\nDidn't switch the swords\nApollo:\nDid you maybe make a mistake in the switching the swords?\nBonny:\nI wasn't involved with that part, so how could I make a mistake? Not even I could mess up if I was simply watching!\nApollo:\nIf you were simply watching...?\nBonny:\nUlp! I-I-I never make any mistakes under any circumstances! That's what I meant!\nApollo:\n(She seemed pretty flustered just now... I bet she DID make a mistake somewhere...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Wait a minute. Are you saying that you...?\"\nMessed up Trucy's escape\nLeads to:\n\"You might have performed the teleportation trick flawlessly...\"\nApollo:\nYou might have performed the teleportation trick flawlessly... ...but what about Trucy's escape trick after that? Did you make some kind of mistake during that?\nBonny:\nOh, er... Well...\nApollo:\nWell, did you?\nBonny:\nI, uh... You see...\nApollo:\nDid you or didn't you?!\nBonny:\nEep! I-I did... You're absolutely right, Mr. Lawyer. I made a mistake during Trucy's escape trick. I'm sorry I lied...\nApollo:\n(Whew... I feel like I pulled off a magic trick of my own just trying to get that out of her.)\nLeads back to Talk options\nPerceive wrong area\nApollo:\nBonny:\nAaah! Wh-Why are you yelling at me?!\nApollo:\nHuh? Oh, uh, I just thought you looked a bit flustered, that's all.\nBonny:\nWell, anyone would get flustered with you shouting at them like that! Any more of that... ...and I'll bend those horns of yours like a spoon!\nApollo:\n(Hands off! Do you have any idea how early I have to wake up to get these just right?!)\nLeads back to Talk options\nThe show (after perceiving)\nApollo:\nSo you made a mistake during Trucy's escape trick?\nBonny:\nYes... I was in charge of operating Mr. Hat, you see... ...but I made a huge goof. So, um, did Trucy explain to you how the escape trick works...?\nApollo:\nYes, she knew we'd need to know for our investigation, so she shared the secret. Let's see... After Trucy escaped from the coffin down into the understage passage... ...Mr. Hat was to be pulled up to the catwalk by a winch. Trucy would then pop up on stage through a trapdoor.\nBonny:\nI was operating Mr. Hat at the time... ...but I flubbed up where I was supposed to have him stand. I was supposed to make Mr. Hat stand to the left of the coffin. But I messed up, and had him stand to the right by accident.\nApollo:\nHmm... That matches up with what we saw during the show.\nAthena:\nHuh? But, then, doesn't that mean... ...Trucy would've ended up popping up on the side opposite to Mr. Hat?\nBonny:\nYes, she would have, if she hadn't done some quick thinking on her feet. She managed to pop up on the right-hand side of the coffin for me. So the audience never even knew a mistake had been made.\nAthena:\nWay to go, Trucy!\nBonny:\nBut my mistake caused her so much trouble...\nApollo:\n(I think I'd better ask Trucy about this later, too.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nBonny:\nI'm sorry I accused you of stealing earlier...\nApollo:\nDid you think we were some random fans who had snuck into your dressing room?\nBonny:\nNo... Your flashy red and yellow getups had me thinking you're some new comedy duo...\nApollo:\nC-Comedy duo?!\nBonny:\nI thought you were polishing your old married couple routine while you were poking around.\nAthena:\nO-Old married couple routine?! Is that really how other people see us...?\nApollo:\n(I-I guess I'd better keep my badge handy at all times...)\nThirteen-Year-Old Poster\nBonny:\nI-I've been a fan of Troupe Gramarye for a really long time!\nAthena:\nWas Troupe Gramarye really as amazing at magic as people say?\nBonny:\nO-Oh, yes! Yes, of course! Magnifi Gramarye's unique and wonderful tricks kept his audience mesmerized! And he crafted so many rare and special tricks -- things I could never come up with! He just created them one after another! He really was like a god when it came to magic! And Magnifi's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Zak and Valant...\nBonny:\n...and that's why I think Troupe Gramarye is truly a legendary group of magicians!\nAthena:\n............Oh, yes! Wow! V-Very, very interesting! I see!\nApollo:\n(I can't believe she dozed off halfway through Bonny's history lesson... No, wait -- I can.)\nCrime Photo\nBonny:\nThat's Mr. Reus...\nApollo:\nYou were Mr. Reus's assistant, right? Did he teach you any tricks?\nBonny:\nA few, yes. But he once said to me... \"Your magic isn't strong enough yet.\" \"You would have a difficult time transforming into a dragon at this time.\"\nApollo:\nHuh? What was all that supposed to mean?\nBonny:\nMr. Reus always stayed in character, even when he wasn't on stage. It made it kind of difficult to talk with him sometimes...\nApollo:\nSounds like he was a rather quirky guy...\nAnything else\nBonny:\nOh! What is that? Some kind of new magic prop? I can help when it comes to all things magic!\nApollo:\nUmm... It's actually case evidence...\nBonny:\nOh. Sorry. I'm afraid I can't be of much help then...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nApollo:\nOh, by the way, we'd like to investigate the understage passage. Would that be all right?\nBonny:\nOh, yes, by all means -- anything to help prove Trucy's innocence! I'll unlock it for you.\n???:\nHey, there you are! You got a minute?\nBonny:\nOh, Mr. Retinz! Y-Yes, of course.\nRetinz:\nNot you, bunny. The lawyers! They're the ones I want to see!\nApollo:\nYou have business with us?\nRetinz:\nI hear you two are from the same agency as Trucy. Is that true?\nApollo:\nYes, that's right.\nRetinz:\nThis is for you, then. Hang loose, baby!\nApollo:\nA contract? ...between Take-2 TV (the 'first party') and Trucy Wright (the 'second party'). If, through the fault of the second party, the show must be canceled in part or in full... ...the second party will pay three million dollars as compensation to the first party.\" TH-TH-THREE MILLION DOLLARS?!\nRetinz:\nYeah! That's more like it! That shocked reaction, that dopey expression! You'd make a great comedian!\nApollo:\nR-Really...?\nRetinz:\nI know -- I'll put you on my show. We'll get one of those cartoon anvils to fall on your head.\nAthena:\nWait a minute... Is this for one of those hidden camera prank shows?\nRetinz:\nYou wish! That's an official contract! See for yourselves. You're the lawyers, after all. You should know one when you see one, right?\nApollo:\n(He's right... It's all signed and everything.)\nRetinz:\nYou better make sure your agency pays what Trucy owes me -- in full!\nApollo:\nA-Are you kidding me?! The Wright Anything Agency doesn't have that kind of money!\nRetinz:\nThen I guess you're gonna have to go fishing for some. I can see it now: \"Craziest Catch: Legend of the Seasick Lawyers\"! Heh heh heh!\nApollo:\nF-Fishing on the high seas?! No, thanks! (I can't even swim!)\nAthena:\nObjection! What kind of ridiculous, lowdown, unfair, one-sided contract is this?!\nRetinz:\nHey, now! There's nothing ridiculous here! It's all perfectly legit! It's got her signature on it, see?\nAthena:\nUrrrgh...\nApollo:\nAaaaarghh...\n*click*\nRetinz:\nMy boys have gotta see the stupid look on your faces! It's priceless! ...Aaaand \"Post\"! Ha ha ha! I'm getting responses already. It's gonna go viral!\nAthena:\nNooooooo... How could he...?\nWidget:\nBye-bye, reputation...\nContract added to the Court Record.\nRetinz:\nYou ain't seen nothing yet, baby! Heh heh! I'm gonna drive Troupe Gramarye and everybody associated with it into the ground! Serves ya right for getting involved with the Gramaryes!\nApollo:\n...What's this grudge you have against the Gramaryes, anyway?\nRetinz:\nHuh? What are you talking about? Stress is making you paranoid, champ! Come on, Bonny. We have more filming to do!\nBonny:\nOh, um... Y-Yes, sir! Excuse me, Mr. Lawyer! Oh! And I'll unlock the door to the understage passage for you later!\nRetinz:\nLater, lawyers! Hang loose, baby!\nAthena:\nWhy would Trucy sign a contract like this?\nApollo:\n(And why did all of this have to happen when Mr. Wright isn't here?!) We'll have to come back for the understage later. Let's go hear Trucy's side of the story.\nAthena:\nGood thinking! We can't let you hit the high seas just yet!\nApollo:\n(There must be something we can do! We can't let the \"Ratings Rajah\" get his way!)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nApollo:\nSo if we can't pay back the money, I'm off on a tuna expedition for a TV show?\nAthena:\nCheer up, Apollo! You have to have a positive attitude about these things! Mmm, tuna... I wanna eat tuna tartare! Although... herb-crusted seared tuna sounds pretty delish, too... Hmm... Which one do you think sounds better, Apollo?\nApollo:\nHaving a positive attitude is one thing, but I have zero intention of going tuna fishing.\nAthena:\n......Aw, phooey.\nApollo:\n(She really thought I was going to go...?!)\nWhat to do\nApollo:\nAny bright ideas on how to get us through this crisis?\nAthena:\nHmm... Our biggest problem right now is how to pay the money... Y'know, in times like this... ...we should consult a lawyer!\nApollo:\n.........Gee, now why didn't I think of that.\nAthena:\n.........Wait.\nApril 27Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nTrucy:\nThree, two, one... Ta-dah!\nGuard:\nWow! Now you made my handcuffs disappear! How did you do that?!\nApollo:\n(She's doing magic tricks for the guard?)\nTrucy:\nNow, should I try making YOU disappear next, Mr. Guard?\nGuard:\nC-Can you do that?! Ooh, yes, please! This is so exciting!\nAthena:\nWe should probably stop her before there's another \"incident\"...\nApollo:\nT-Trucy!\nTrucy:\nOh! Hi, Polly! Hi, Athena!\nApollo:\nWe, um, have some more questions for you.\nTrucy:\nJudging by the look on your faces, it must be about something big.\nApollo:\nYeah, I guess you could say that... Things have gotten a little... sticky. (Oh, and I have to remember to give her that thing she asked for, too.)\nTalk\nThe contract\nApollo:\nTrucy, do you remember this contract?\nTrucy:\nYes. I signed it before I went on stage.\nApollo:\nWhat about this liability for compensation article here?\nTrucy:\nLiability for compensation...? What are you talking about? Let me see that! ...What?! Th-Three million dollars?!\nApollo:\n(Just as I suspected, she didn't know about that part.)\nTrucy:\nI've never seen this article! And I read the whole contract from top to bottom!\nApollo:\nYeah, I didn't think you'd miss such a big thing. But there's your signature, so what's going on?\nTrucy:\n.........Maybe... ...there was some kind of trick involved? You know, like, when I signed it...\nAthena:\nIn other words, you think there might be some foul play afoot?\nApollo:\nAnd I'm willing to bet that the Ratings Rajah is the one behind it.\nBonny's mistake\nApollo:\nBonny told us about the mistake she made on stage.\nTrucy:\nOh, you mean with where Mr. Hat had been placed? Even I was at a loss about what to do for a second there.\nApollo:\nSo how did you fix the problem?\nTrucy:\nWell, I was down in the understage passage when I found out. I had to work my butt off to fix it, let me tell you! After I escaped from the coffin and went down into the understage passage... ...I got a signal from Bonny saying she'd made a mistake with Mr. Hat's positioning. No joke, I was freaking out... After all, I had to be back up on stage in a few short minutes! Magical Girl Trucy Wright was faced with an unprecedented crisis beneath the stage! Would this spell the end for \"Trucy in Gramarye-Land\"?!\nAthena:\nA-And? And then what happened?!\nApollo:\n(Athena's totally hooked...)\nTrucy:\nI was supposed to get back up to the stage through trapdoor #1 on the left... ...using a platform that can be raised and lowered called a stage lift. There was a stage lift, ready and waiting in the lowered position, under trapdoor #1. But Mr. Hat had been placed on the right, above trapdoor #2, by mistake. There was already another stage lift under trapdoor #2, but... ...it was in the raised position, since we hadn't planned on using it.\nApollo:\nOkay. So how did you get back up onto the stage?\nTrucy:\nWhy... through brute strength! I couldn't lower stage lift #2 by myself. So I pushed it back and out of the way. Then, I moved the lowered stage lift #1 into place under trapdoor #2.\nTrucy:\nHngrh! Ggggh! This thing is heavy!\nTrucy:\n............ I wish I could've moved it with magic! Unfortunately, my magic is useless under the stage. The understage is a dark abyss that drains magicians of all their powers.\nApollo:\nI can see why it's called \"the Abyss\" -- I never knew it could take so much out of you.\nTrucy:\nThat's just how it goes in the real world. Illusions are created by the blood, sweat, and tears of those behind the scenes.\nAthena:\nWow, I learned so much just now!\nApollo:\nTrucy, have you told anybody else about all this?\nTrucy:\nNope. Nobody.\nApollo:\n(This sounds like some critical information. I'd better make a note of it.)\nTrucy's Statement added to the Court Record.\nBonny's mistake (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nBonny told us about the mistake she made on stage.\nTrucy:\nOh, you mean with where Mr. Hat had been placed? Even I was at a loss about what to do for a second there.\nApollo:\nSo how did you fix the problem?\nTrucy:\nWell, I was down in the understage passage when I found out.

I can't believe it! The Great Mr. Reus would never do any such thing!\nApollo:\n(But would it be so far-fetched if he was after Troupe Gramarye's secret tricks...? It makes for a pretty compelling motive to take the notebook...)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nApollo:\nHere you go, Trucy.\nTrucy:\nYou're just letting me have it? What's come over you all of a sudden?\nApollo:\n(If it'll take her mind off things for a bit, why not let her have a little fun with it?)\nTrucy:\nOh, I see how it is! Throwing down the gauntlet, are you, Polly? Fine then. In that case, why don't I make the money vanish from your wallet?\nApollo:\nHa ha ha. My money will disappear on its own when I take you out for a treat after this trial. Ramen at Eldoon's Noodles, cake -- anything you want!\nTrucy:\n...That's it? No sarcastic barb at the end? Are you sure you're feeling all right?\nApollo:\n(Huh? Did I say something wrong?)\nThirteen-Year-Old Poster\nTrucy:\nNo matter where I perform, always put this poster up in my dressing room. As long as it's up on the wall, I feel like I won't make any mistakes.\nApollo:\nLike a superstition, I know the feeling.\nTrucy:\nStill, it didn't stop such an awful thing from happening today... I hope my granddaddy doesn't show up at my bedside to scold me tonight...\nApollo:\n(Me, too, Trucy... Me, too...)\nCrime Photo\nTrucy:\nI still can't believe Mr. Reus is gone...\nApollo:\nHad you been acquainted with him long\nTrucy:\nNo, I just met him for the first time for this show.\nAthena:\nBut didn't he used to belong to Troupe Gramarye?\nTrucy:\nYes, but he left when I was still little. Even if I had met him back then, I don't remember it. That's why I was so excited about working with him...\nApollo:\n(Yeah. Who could've predicted anything like this would happen...?)\nTrucy's Notebook\nApollo:\nHere you go, Trucy. Here's your notebook back.\nTrucy:\nOh, great! Thank you very much!\nApollo:\nSo what's written in there, anyway? It looks like it's full of secrets or something.\nTrucy:\nThat's because it is. It was originally my granddaddy Magnifi Gramarye's notebook. He used it like a diary, and as a place to jot down ideas for new magic tricks. Some of which, only members of Troupe Gramarye have ever laid eyes on.\nApollo:\nWow... This notebook is a really big deal, then.\nTrucy:\nYes. That's why it's always kept under lock and key.\nAthena:\nI bet a magician would do just about anything to get their hands on that notebook!\nApollo:\n(And we found it mixed in with Mr. Reus's belongings... Could he really have been trying to steal it...?)\nTrucy:\nThe Troupe Gramarye creed is also written inside. \"A true entertainer always keeps a smile on their face.\" That creed was passed down to me from my daddy, as his daddy passed it down to him.\nApollo:\n(It's true that Trucy always keeps a smile on her face... I guess it's due, in part, to her family creed.)\nGramarye Notebook updated in the Court Record.\nApollo:\nTrucy, I want to talk to you about where we found this notebook...\nGramarye Notebook\nTrucy:\nThis notebook is super important to me... Thanks for getting it back.\nAthena:\nIs it like a diary or something?\nTrucy:\nOh, sure. Sometimes I write about my love troubles -- you know, stuff like that.\nAthena:\nReally?!\nApollo:\nWhat?!\nTrucy:\nJust kidding! Did I get you?!\nApollo:\nN-No. So you were just joking, huh.\nTrucy:\n...Maaaaaybe. Wouldn't you like to know?\nApollo:\n(Am I ever going to get a straight answer out of a Wright...?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nApollo:\nIn any case, we'd better focus on doing something about this contract for now.\nAthena:\nTrucy signed it in her dressing room, right?\nApollo:\nThen we'd better do a little more investigating there.\nTrucy:\nI'm so sorry to put the two of you through all of this...\nApollo:\nDon't worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. There's gotta be some kind of mistake.\nTrucy:\nIf you need me to, I'm willing to take drastic measures! With my magic!\nApollo:\n...Y-You're not planning on pulling some \"magical money\" out of there, are you?\nTrucy:\nNo. My magic panties are much better at making things disappear than appear!\nApollo:\n(...D-Do I WANT to know what she's planning to make disappear?)\nAthena:\nApollo! We have to do something -- anything -- to fix this!\nApollo:\nI agree. Let's check out the dressing room again, for starters.\nAthena:\nOkay. And we should finally check out that understage passage, too.\nTrucy:\nThe Abyss? Then you'll have to go through the backstage area. Be careful down there!\nWright Anything Agency\nPresent\nGramarye Notebook\nAthena:\nThis notebook pretty much embodies the Troupe Gramarye creed, huh?\nApollo:\nWhat about you, Athena? Do you have any principles of your own?\nAthena:\nOf course! First of all... I believe in doing at least one good deed every day!\nApollo:\nKindness to your fellow man, huh? That's a good thing to believe in.\nAthena:\nNext, I believe in always working to improve yourself.\nApollo:\nKeep challenging yourself, huh? That's some resolve you've got there.\nAthena:\nAnd last but not least, I believe you gotta have steak the night before a trial!\nApollo:\nWell, I guess it's true that no one can fight on an empty stomach, but...\nApril 27Penrose Theater - Dressing Room\nApollo:\nOkay. This is where Trucy signed that contract.\nAthena:\nRight. And there must've been some kind of trick that was used when she signed it. The question is what kind of trick and how was it done.\nApollo:\nIf some kind of object or tool was used, there still may be a trace of it somewhere. Like with the pen, or the paper...\nAthena:\nWell! It's time to find the secret to that trick! Auf geht's! Let's do this!\nExamine\nClipboard\nApollo:\nHuh? Hey, take a look at this clipboard.\nStaff:\nCould you sign this, please, ma'am?\nTrucy:\nSure thing! Just the one sheet in this clipboard, right?\nApollo:\nIsn't this the clipboard Trucy used when she signed the contract?\nAthena:\nI think you're right! Let's give it the once-over!\nExamine front side\nApollo:\nLet's try opening the folder.\nExamine clip (after examining front side)\nApollo:\nThis part here holds papers in place.\nAthena:\nCould this clip have something to do with how they conned her? ...OW! It bit me!\nApollo:\nOnly you could get hurt by a clipboard, Athena...\nExamine lower left screw (after examining front side)\nApollo:\nIt looks like a screw.\nAthena:\nI guess that means this clipboard can be taken apart.\nApollo:\nBut I can't loosen this one without a screwdriver.\nExamine upper left screw (after examining front side)\nApollo:\nThis screw won't budge. I don't think even your crazy strength could budge it.\nAthena:\n\"Crazy strength\"? What kind of thing is that to say to a delicate young lady?!\nApollo:\nI don't see you denying it, either...\nExamine upper right screw (after examining front side)\nApollo:\nIt's just a screw.\nAthena:\nHmph. That observation won't get you any laughs.\nApollo:\n(What? Do I have to make with the funny all the time?)\nExamine lower right screw (after examining front side)\nApollo:\nHey, this screw... It's different from the others. Not only that, but... ...I think it's loose. Look. I can move it!\nAthena:\nAre you sure you should be fooling with it like that, Apollo...?\nApollo:\nWhoa! It came right out...\nAthena:\nSee? I tried to tell you, but would you listen? Noooooo.\nApollo:\n...Hm? Hey, take a look through the hole, Athena. I think there's something back there.\nAthena:\nOh, wow, you're right. What is it?\nExamine back side (after examining lower right screw)\nApollo:\nHey, look. The back panel is loose. I think I can take it off. Got it!\nAthena:\nYou're just breaking things left and right today, aren't you?\nApollo:\nL-Look! There's something inside!\nExamine black paper (after examining back side)\nLeads to:\n\"What is this black sheet of... I want to say, paper?\"\nApollo:\nWhat is this black sheet of... I want to say, paper?\nAthena:\nOh I know! It's carbon paper! You put it between two pieces of paper and it copies what you write onto the bottom one.\nApollo:\nSo when Trucy signed the contract... ...there was actually another contract underneath.\nAthena:\nAnd her signature on the top contract got copied onto the hidden contract!\nApollo:\nSo THAT'S how Trucy was conned! This is that Ratings Rajah's doing! I just know it!\nWidget:\nHow dare he?!\nAthena:\nYou gotta hand it to him, though. It couldn't have been easy fooling Trucy. That girl's no slouch!\nApollo:\nYeah. But I bet we can use this clipboard as evidence if we ever take this to trial.\nClipboard added to the Court Record.\nClipboard (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nWhat a rotten trick he played on Trucy with this clipboard!\nApollo:\nAnd three million dollars? That guy is a real crook. It's quite the feat he pulled off, though. It's not everybody who can fool our Trucy.\nAthena:\nYou can say that again! I still can't quite believe it, though. She may be the youngest member of our agency, but she's also the most level-headed.\nApollo:\nIt kind of feels like someone sunk our battleship...\nApril 27Penrose Theater - Stage\nApollo:\nLet's see... We should be able to get to the understage passage from backstage. Hopefully, Bonny unlocked the door for us like she said she would.\nExamine\nBackstage\n\"Understage\" sign\nLeads to:\n\"The door's unlocked!\"\nApollo:\nThe door's unlocked! Thank you, Bonny! Well, Athena, here we go.\nApril 27Penrose Theater - Understage\nApollo:\nIt sure is dark and dusty down here.\nAthena:\n\"The Abyss\" -- the magical underworld. And look! There's a denizen of the Abyss now! A fearsome beast with long, sharp fangs, ready to prey on unsuspecting souls...!\nApollo:\nHuh? What're you...? Oh, you mean that tiny little rat over there?\nAthena:\nNo. I mean that \"fearsome beast\" over there!\nApollo:\nI take it you don't like rodents.\nExamine\nMagic props\nAthena:\nLook at all these props! Hey! There's something in this hat!\nApollo:\nA dove? Cards?\nAthena:\nUmm... A juice box and some snacks...\nApollo:\nLooks like somebody planned to have a little treat in the middle of the show...\nSword stand\nAthena:\nThis sword is the exact same design as the murder weapon. Wait... What's this...? HYAAAH!\nApollo:\nOWWW! What are you doing?! That hurts! I-- I think I'm bleeding out!\nAthena:\nOh, stop being such a drama queen. It's only rubber.\nApollo:\nHuh? ...Hey, you're right. So this must be the sword Trucy used during the trick.\nAthena:\nAfter the incident, someone must've switched this rubber sword with the real one onstage.\nApollo:\nAnd maybe that's when they brought the rubber sword here.\nSword Stand added to the Court Record.\nSword stand (subsequent times)\nAthena:\nThis sword is the exact same design as the murder weapon. Wait... What's this...? HYAAAH!\nApollo:\nOWWW! What are you doing?! That hurts! I-- I think I'm bleeding out!\nAthena:\nOh, stop being such a drama queen. It's only rubber.\nApollo:\nHuh? ...Hey, you're right. So this must be the sword Trucy used during the trick.\nAthena:\nAfter the incident, someone must've switched this rubber sword with the real one onstage.\nApollo:\nAnd maybe that's when they brought the rubber sword here.\nGraffiti\nAthena:\n\"I'm gonna make it big someday, too! Just you wait and see!\" Wh-What's that all about?\nApollo:\nMy guess is... ...it's the soulful cry of some poor assistant made to toil here in the darkness.\nAthena:\nAnd who would know about the soulful cry of a bitter assistant better than you, right? You really understand the writer's feelings of despair and frustration!\nApollo:\nSadly, yes. Yes, I do.\nAthena:\n...You really shouldn't scribble on the walls, you know, Apollo.\nApollo:\nIt wasn't me!\nRed tape\nApollo:\nWhat's this glowy stuff? Oh, it's glow-in-the-dark tape.\nAthena:\nHey. This must be what I saw through that secret door in the bottom of the coffin.\nApollo:\nBut who put it here, and why?\nAthena:\nIt's probably a marker of some sort since it's so dark down here...\nApollo:\nSounds about right. Maybe it's meant to mark which ladder to climb.\nLadder on left\nApollo:\nThis ladder goes up to the ceiling. I wonder what's just above?\nAthena:\nApollo. ............\nApollo:\nA-All right. Fine! I'll climb the ladder! Why does it always have to be ladders...? H-Huh? Where am I? It's pitch-black! And cramped, too!\nAthena:\nYou know what I think? I think you're in that coffin we saw backstage.\nApollo:\nHmm... So that's where this ladder leads. But I still don't get what that coffin was for.\nLadder on right\nApollo:\nThis ladder goes up to the ceiling. So I guess it leads to one of the trapdoors on stage?\nAthena:\nTrucy must've used this ladder when she escaped from the coffin. ...Why don't you climb up there and see if I'm correct? It's not so high. You'll be fine, right?\nApollo:\nHuh? Why me?\nAthena:\nYou'd make a young lady wearing a skirt climb a ladder?\nApollo:\nFine... I'm going, I'm going... Aaagh! T-The lights! It BUUUUUURNS! Ooooow...\nAthena:\nAre you all right?\nApollo:\n...I can now confirm that the ladder does indeed lead up to the stage.\nAthena:\nWell, that tasty bit of info was definitely worth risking life and limb for. Well done!\nStage lift #1\nApollo:\nIt's a stage lift for getting up to the stage. Trucy moved this one here.\nAthena:\nI guess it used to be where that yellow tape is. How in the world did she manage to move this huge thing?\nApollo:\nIt couldn't have been easy for her. She's pretty petite. But I bet it'd be easy for you.\nAthena:\nJust what are you implying?! That's it, chump. You're looking up \"microaggressions\" later.\nStage lift #2\nApollo:\nIt's a stage lift for getting up to the stage. It looks like this crank lowers the platform. But Trucy said it's impossible for one person to do it alone.\nAthena:\nThat sounds like a challenge! Now I wanna try it! HRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH! GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! ............ *huff, huff* *huff, huff* Ha ha... It's probably just broken...\nApollo:\n(Or you could just take people at their word.) If I'm reading this room right... ...this must be the stage lift Trucy moved during the show. Originally, it was there, where stage lift #1 is now.\nStage Lift #2 added to the Court Record.\nStage lift #2 (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nIt's a stage lift for getting up to the stage. It looks like this crank lowers the platform. But Trucy said it's impossible for one person to do it alone.\nAthena:\nThat sounds like a challenge! Now I wanna try it! HRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH! GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! ............ *huff, huff* *huff, huff* Ha ha... It's probably just broken...\nApollo:\n(Or you could just take people at their word.) If I'm reading this room right... ...this must be the stage lift Trucy moved during the show. Originally, it was there, where stage lift #1 is now.\nAfter examining sword stand, red tape, ladder on right, stage lift #1, and stage lift #2:\nAthena:\nHold on, Apollo. I hear... voices... Quick, hide!\nApollo:\nHuh? OW! Quit shoving!\nAthena:\nHurry up and get down there!\nApollo:\nYEOW! My arm doesn't bend that way! What the heck, Athena?!\nAthena:\nShh! Look!\nBonny:\n*sigh* It's so much WORK pretending to be cute and sweet.\nApollo:\n(Isn't that Bonny?)\nRetinz:\nHey, bunny! Wait for me!\nApollo:\n(And the Ratings Rajah?) What did we have to hide for, Athena?\nAthena:\nBecause I heard something funny. There was something off in their voices...\nApollo:\n(Oh, right. Athena's super-sensitive hearing...)\nBonny:\nThose lawyers are poking around, trying to stir up trouble. Should I be worried?\nRetinz:\nRelax! I didn't say anything to the police, and I won't say anything to them, either.\nBonny:\nYou better not! Or you're gonna get it! POW! Right in the kisser!\nApollo:\nWhat the...? Is it just me or does Bonny seem kinda different from before?\nAthena:\nApollo, shhh!\nBonny:\nI'm sick and tired of this whole investigation! All I want is Trucy's head on a platter!\nRetinz:\nHeh heh. Leave everything to me, babe. Don't forget the power of mass media! TV can accomplish anything! I'll make sure Trucy gets much worse than a guilty verdict!\nBonny:\nHmph. I can't wait to see that girl crying and begging for mercy.\nRetinz:\nYou really hate Trucy, don't you, bunny?\nBonny:\nI hate her. I LOATHE her! I can't stand that Trucy Wright! Just because she's a little good at magic, she thinks she's all that! So this is exactly what that sniveling brat deserves!\nApollo:\n(Hey! What the heck...?!)\nBonny:\nIf you mess this up, you're gonna really be sorry. You hear me? I'll crush you flat. Like a cockroach under my foot!\nRetinz:\nOh, you KYOOT widdle thing! You're so adooorwable when you're thwowing a fit! OW! OW! My foot! C-Can't you take a joke?\nBonny:\nC'mon! Grab my things! We're leaving!\nRetinz:\nD'awwwwwww. Lead the hippity-hopping way, my little bun-bun!\nAthena:\n............\nApollo:\n............\nAthena:\nWh-What was that absolutely revolting scene all about?\nApollo:\nI guess the entertainment industry attracts all kind of eccentrics... But that conversation... It set off every red flag in the book.\nAthena:\nYou said it! I smell \"plot\" with a capital \"P.U.\"!\nApollo:\nHmm... Retinz claims he was at the TV station at the time of the incident... ...and we saw Bonny onstage ourselves.\nAthena:\nHey, Apollo, I have an idea. Why don't we pay Take-2 TV a visit? We can check up on the Rating [sic] Rajah's alibi while we're there.\nApollo:\nSounds like a plan.\nStage\nExamine\nBackstage\n\"Understage\" sign\nApollo:\nThe stairs to the Abyss... This is how we get to the understage passage.\nDetention Center\nPresent\nStage Lift #2\nTrucy:\nThis is one of the stage lifts I moved in the understage passage during the show.\nApollo:\nI can't believe you were able to move something this heavy all by yourself.\nTrucy:\nWell, I couldn't disappoint the audience, now could I!\nAthena:\nThat's some real determination! You're a true pro, Trucy!\nTrucy:\nOh, it was nothing, really. My granddaddy once finished an entire show after throwing out his back on stage!\nApollo:\nReally? Now THAT'S magic!\nApril 27Take-2 TV - Studio\nAthena:\nYikes! Look at this place!\nApollo:\nThere's so much going on at once, it's making my head spin.\nAthena:\nTake a look at that screen! And listen to those hosts! \"Magical Murder! Live audience witnesses shocking skewering! Seventeen-Year-Old Magician, Trucy Wright! (Changed from [17-Year-Old Magician, Trucy Wright!] in the original release) See exclusive, unedited footage of the heinous crime -- complete and uncut!\" We can't let them broadcast that! Trucy will get tried in the court of public opinion!\nApollo:\nWell, I doubt we can stop them from airing it... ...but we can prove her innocence in a real court of law! No matter what garbage they report on TV, we can set the record straight at the trial!\nExamine\nSlot machine or roulette wheel\nApollo:\nA slot machine and roulette wheel, huh. They really went all in with the gambling theme.\nAthena:\nIt looks like that slot machine really works! I've always wanted to give gambling a try!\nApollo:\nIt's not worth it. Besides, you're not even old enough to gamble in most states yet.\nAthena:\nThat's all right. I get to experience it enough in court... ...guessing whether you'll win or lose the case on any given day.\nApollo:\nThanks for the vote of confidence.\nAthena:\nDon't worry, Apollo. I only bet on winners and I haven't lost yet!\nScreen\nApollo:\nLook at that logo above the screen. \"Scandal Gamble Gambit!\" Is that the title of this show?\nAthena:\nYup. Haven't you ever seen it? They present scandalous rumors about celebrities... ...and then people bet on whether the rumors are true or not.\nApollo:\nUgh... o it's just another tasteless TV show. Today's scandal is... \"Tragedy on stage! Did Trucy Wright cause an accident, or did she commit murder?!\" It looks like \"murder\" is in the lead.\nApollo:\nWell, I say neither.\nAthena:\nThen we'll just have to create a third option tomorrow -- in court!\nWorkstation\nApollo:\nThis must be a video production workstation of some sort.\nAthena:\nHmm... That coffee cup looks awfully familiar.\nStaff:\nYeah, that's where Mr. Retinz always sits. He's very hands-on, you know. You'll always find him on the set of his projects.\nApollo:\nBut he was here at the station during the magic show, right?\nStaff:\nYeah, well, he had two shows going at once this morning. He had his regular program to oversee here, so he couldn't be at the Penrose.\nAthena:\nSo you can vouch for him -- that he was here at the station during the magic show?\nStaff:\nWhat, like an alibi? Sure can. He was definitely here. Still, after a while he couldn't stand being away from the Penrose, it seems. As soon as his part was over here, he took a taxi to the theater... ...but he apparently didn't get there until after that thing had already occurred.\nApollo:\n(Sounds like he has a rock solid alibi...)\nSitting staff member\nAthena:\nI wonder what that guy sitting down there is doing.\nApollo:\nHmm... It looks like he's reading that script he's holding.\nStaff: WHAAAT?! Are you serious?! Those two are gonna break up?! What?! And the series is going on hiatus 'cause the cartoonist is sick?! No way!\nAthena:\n.........I think he's reading a comic book he's hiding in his script.\nApollo:\nIf you're gonna goof off on set, that's a pretty bold way to do it...\nCameraman\nApollo:\nWe're looking into the incident that happened at the magic show this morning...\nStaff:\nOh, that? Yeah, I was the cameraman for that.\nApollo:\nCan you tell us anything about what you saw?\nStaff:\n...Bonny was supes adorbs! Heh heh...\nApollo:\nUm... that's not exactly what I...\nStaff:\nI couldn't get enough of her! I filmed her the whole time! Got some primo footage, if I do say so myself! Heh heh!\nApollo:\n(I'd better quit before he decides to share what he intends to do with said footage...)\nStaff member next to roulette wheel\nApollo:\nPardon me. I know you're busy right now...\nStaff:\nWhat are you guys? Street?\nApollo:\n(\"Street\"? Does that mean \"people off the street\" or something?) We're Trucy Wright's lawyers.\nStaff:\nOh, okay. Lawyers. Got it. Well, whaddaya want?\nApollo:\n(He must be REALLY busy. He hasn't even looked this way.) We're investigating the incident that occurred at the magic show this morning... ...and we heard that Roger Retinz was in charge of that program.\nStaff:\nYeah, that's right. The guy hates magic, but the show was all his idea. Just between you and me, I think it was Bonny that egged him on.\nApollo:\nEgged him on? How so?\nStaff:\nI saw the two of them together -- you know, walking along arm in arm. I bet she sweet-talked him into doing the program because she wanted the work. She hasn't been selling very well on her own, apparently.\nApollo:\nI see...\nStaff:\nOh, hey, if you're looking into the incident, I guess you'd want the show footage, right? It's on the disc in my back pocket. If you want it, go ahead and fish it out.\nApollo:\nWow. Thank you very much. (He turned out to be surprisingly helpful.)\nShow Footage disc retrieved from the staff member's back pocket.\nStaff member next to roulette wheel (subsequent times)\nStaff:\nHuh? You want something else?\nApollo:\nNo, uh, we're good. Thanks for your help earlier.\nAthena:\nThat's a pretty big back pocket you have to be able to fit a whole disc in there.\nStaff:\nYeah, I can fit all kinds of things in there! It's pretty handy for when I have to be out on location.\nApollo:\nSo what other kinds of things do you put in there?\nStaff:\n...........\nApollo:\nSir?\nStaff:\nUm, maybe I'd better not tell you...\nApollo:\nHuh? (Now I really want to know...!)\nApollo:\nWell, I guess we got just about everything we can out of this place. It looks like Retinz's alibi is pretty airtight. (But if that's true... then who could've killed Mr. Reus?)\nAfter examining workstation and staff member next to roulette wheel:\nApollo:\nWell, I guess we got just about everything we can out of this place. It looks like Retinz's alibi is pretty airtight. (But if that's true... then who could've killed Mr. Reus?)\nAfter examining clipboard in Penrose Theater - Dressing Room and examining workstation and staff member next to roulette wheel in Take-2 TV - Studio:\nAthena:\nLooks like we're pretty much done here. Should we go back to the office? We can get a snack and talk over our plan of attack.\nApollo:\nSounds good to me.\nApril 27Wright Anything Agency\nApollo:\nWh-What in the world...? What's going on here?!\nAthena:\nAll these stickers say \"REPOSSESSED\"...\nApollo:\nWho did this? Who's responsible for this?!\n???:\nWhoa, now! This is a restricted area, champ! No trespassing!\nApollo:\n\"Trespassing\"?! But this is our office! You're the one who's trespassing!\nRetinz:\nEnough with the lip, boy. Don't tell me you forgot about your debt?\nAthena:\nWh-What are you talking about?!\nRetinz:\nI'm just abiding by the contract. If the agency can't pay me, I have every right to seize its property, am I right?\nApollo:\n(Just like that?! We haven't even had a chance to take this to trial!)\nRetinz:\nHeh heh. If you're gonna be mad, shouldn't Trucy be the one you're mad at? I told you. It serves you right for getting involved with those Gramaryes!\nApollo:\n(Why, you dirty, rotten--!)\nExamine\nAnywhere\nApollo:\nThese stupid stickers are all over the place!\nRetinz:\nWell, would you look at that? There's something I forgot to put a sticker on!\nApollo:\nHey! Don't put one on me!\nTalk\nOffice seizure\nApollo:\nWhat are you going to do with all of our stuff?!\nRetinz:\nSell it, of course. Every last bit of it. That's why I'm seizing everything. And I'll take this little office of yours, too.\nAthena:\nYou think you can just waltz in here and do whatever you want?!\nRetinz:\nIndeed I do! Unless you Wright Whatever Warehouse jokers got three million ready?\nAthena:\nNnrgh...\nRetinz:\nThat a no, then? Because I gotta recoup my money somehow. After all, the entire program went south because of Trucy. It's called \"liability for compensation.\" And this infantile agency is the liable party!\nApollo:\nWhy, you black-hearted...\nAthena:\nHey, Apollo. What about the crooked clipboard?\nApollo:\nIt's no good. We don't have any proof that Retinz was behind it.\nAthena:\nDarn...\nRetinz:\nHeh heh. You're gonna have to do better than that, folks! Looks like the famed Mr. Wright left behind nothing but incompetent newbs to run things.\nApollo:\n(No way... He was counting on Mr. Wright to be away for this plan of his...? What a two-bit thug! We'll show him!)\nRetinz:\nHa ha! There's the sugar! That expression! It's priceless! So, how does it feel to lose the precious office your boss left you in charge of?\nRetinz [on cue card]:\nSAY SOMETHING DUMB!!\nApollo:\nGrrrrrrr...\nRetinz:\nNow, not to rub it in or anything... ...but I think you should know where you stand right now.\nApollo:\n(Oh, man. What now?!)\nWhere we stand (appears after \"Office seizure\")\nLeads to:\n\"Here. Have a gander.\"\nPresent\nClipboard\nRetinz:\nHuh? What's this? You want me to look at something?\nAthena:\nDon't show him that now, Apollo. He'll just try to take it from you.\nApollo:\nYeah, good point. (Better play our cards closer to our chests.)\nRetinz:\nWhat do you want, a handout? Fine, fine. Here. Now go away, kids -- ya bother me.\nAthena:\nOoh, Apollo! The humiliation! He's treating us like beggars!\nApollo:\nIf it bothers you so much, why do you have your palm stretched out?\nAnything else\nRetinz:\nWhat, you want me to repo that, too? I'll take anything you wanna give me as collateral.\nApollo:\nEr, no. It's not for you. (I'd better be careful not to show him any important evidence...)\nRetinz:\nHere. Have a gander.\nTV:\nThe trial of young, up-and-coming magician Trucy Wright is scheduled for tomorrow. We're here, just outside the office of the suspect, hoping for an exclusive peak inside.\nApollo:\nWhat?! Is this LIVE?!\nAthena:\nAhh! Apollo, look! There's a sea of reporters outside!\nTV:\nOh! A questionable-looking pair are peeking out the window at this very moment! Our viewers at home can see for themselves their vicious, brutal expressions...\nAthena:\nYellow journalism at its finest...\nRetinz:\nAnd that's the way it is. The majority of the public already thinks Trucy is guilty. They saw the whole thing happen with their own eyes during the show's live broadcast. Everybody in the country is against you!\nApollo:\nN-No way...\nRetinz:\nNo office... No allies... Are you sure you still want to represent that girl?\nApollo:\nO-Of course we do! We believe in her innocence!\nRetinz:\nHeh heh. Go ahead, think what you want -- it's a free country! Just know that you'll be the biggest losers in the end. In the meantime, feel free to keep on flopping around like the dying fish you are. Now then, you gotta be outta here by tomorrow. Take in this cozy little office tonight while you still can! Heh heh. Hang loose, baby!\nApollo:\nI... I can't believe we let Mr. Wright's office get placed under seizure! Of all the--!\nAthena:\nThis is just ridiculous!\n*CRASH!*\nAthena:\nEeeeek!\nWidget:\nLook out!\nGallery:\nClear out! We don't want murderers here!\nAthena:\nHEY!

Our office...!\nPhoenix:\nA-Apollo...? Okay, okay. We'd better both take a deep breath...\nPhoenix:\nWow... I see... And he's saying you have to be out by tomorrow?\nApollo:\nI'm so sorry, Mr. Wright... I wish there was something I could've done...\nPhoenix:\nThis... is quite the mess, isn't it? Even if I left right now, I wouldn't be there in time for the trial tomorrow. I'm sorry, Apollo, but I need you to handle this for me.\nApollo:\nO-Of course! We can handle the defense, but the office...\nPhoenix:\nIt's too soon to give up on that!\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nThe contract only addresses Trucy's liability if she causes the show to be canceled. So you just have to prove in court tomorrow that it wasn't Trucy's fault.\nApollo:\n...Hey, you're right!\nPhoenix:\nSo everything depends on your winning that trial tomorrow. Trucy's fate... and the fate of our office. It's all riding on your shoulders, Apollo.\nApollo:\n...I-I know... (I-I'll be... fine... right?)\nPhoenix:\n............Apollo!\nApollo:\n!\nPhoenix:\nI've been watching you grow over these past two years. That's why I can say, with absolute confidence... that you'll be fine.\nApollo:\nR-Really?\nPhoenix:\nI've seen you earn victory after victory in some pretty dicey situations... ...and guide Athena -- helping her along her way, too. That's why I know you're ready, why I know I can leave Trucy and the office to you. ...I believe in you, Apollo.\nApollo:\nTh-Thank you, Mr. Wright...\nPhoenix:\nGood luck tomorrow!\nApollo:\n...Thank you! I'm... I'm fine! Everything will be fine!\nPhoenix:\nYou can call me anytime if you feel you need to, but...\nApollo:\n...But I'll be fine on my own, right? Yes, I think so, too. I can do this!\nPhoenix:\nThat's the spirit. Give it your best out there, Apollo!\nPhone:\n......*beep*\nApollo:\n............\nAthena:\nWhat is it, Apollo? What are you smiling about?\nApollo:\nWho, me? I-It's nothing... (Mr. Wright believes in me. I-I can't let him down!) We have to win this trial, Athena!\nAthena:\nI couldn't agree more! And I'll do everything in my power to help!\nApollo:\n(Our opponent tomorrow... \"Prosecutor Sahdmadhi,\" huh? Why now of all times...? Still, I don't care who it is! I can't afford to let my guard down for anyone!)\nAnime cutsceme\nNahyuta:\nO restless wandering soul of the dead...\nEma:\nProsecutor Sahdmadhi. Sorry to disturb you, but...

I'm Apollo Justice, and I'm fine...Trucy:\nIs Apollo okay? He's been muttering to himself all morning...Athena:\nHe's been like that since yesterday. Guess the pressure of today's trial is getting to him.Trucy:\nPoor Polly... He's really tearing himself up over all of this.Athena:\nGet it together, Apollo!Apollo:\nYikes! Athena! Wh-When did you get here?Athena:\nTry to relax a little bit, will you? You're getting yourself way too worked up.Apollo:\nY-Yeah... But I'm all right. I'm fine!Athena:\nYou know, I did a little digging on this Nahyuta Sahdmadhi guy... He's apparently not your run-of-the-mill prosecutor.Apollo:\n...Oh, yeah? What did you find out?Athena:\nWell, they say he wields an incredible power... ...to accurately read a trial's karma and its ultimate fate.Apollo:\nWhat is THAT supposed to mean?Athena:\nI don't have all the details, but apparently... ...he can foresee how the arguments will go, and even lead his opposition. So the defense basically ends up going in whatever direction he has in his head.Apollo:\n...Man, this isn't going to be a cake walk, if that's true...Athena:\nEma DID say she'd talk to him for us, though. Here's hoping that went well.Apollo:\n(In any case, it sounds like he's going to keep us on our toes.)That's why I know you're ready, why I know I can leave Trucy and the office to you. ...I believe in you, Apollo.Apollo:\n(Mr. Wright is putting his faith in me. I can't let him down now!) I'm fine... I'm fine. I'm fine!Trucy:\nThere he goes again. It's almost like he's chanting a prayer.Apollo:\nI'm fine... I'm fine... I'm Apollo Justice, and I'm fine!Athena:\nIf you say so, Apollo...Guard:\nThe trial will start momentarily. Is the defense ready?Apollo:\nYes! WE'RE FINE! (Trucy's fate and the fate of the agency rest on this trial... This is it, Justice! If ever there was a time to shine, it's now!)April 28, 9:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 6Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Trucy Wright.Apollo:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Nahyuta:\n............Judge:\nAnd the prosecution?Nahyuta:\n............Judge:\nUm, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi...?Nahyuta:\n...A thousand pardons. It was rude of me to keep you waiting. I was praying for the victim.Judge:\nOh! Praying... Yes. Yes, I see. You're a Khura'inist monk, correct, Prosecutor?Nahyuta:\n...Yes, that is correct. I am but a lowly monk from the Kingdom of Khura'in. I beg in advance for the forgiveness and kind patience of everyone here in this court. I am unfamiliar with the proceedings of this country, and may make many blunders.Athena:\nHmm... He seems like such a gentle-mannered soul, doesn't he?Apollo:\n(I wonder if Ema had a chance to talk with him about Trucy...)Judge:\nNow then, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, your opening statement, if you would.Nahyuta:\n...Certainly. In the name of the Holy Mother... ...I vow to guide the victim's soul to a land of eternal peace known as the Twilight Realm. Now, let the last rites of the victim begin.Apollo:\n(Nahyuta Sahdmadhi... He's really been making a name for himself apparently, but... ...that nickname -- \"Last Rites Prosecutor\"... I wonder how that will come into play today.)Nahyuta:\nThe incident took place in the middle of a spectacular magic show. The accused performed a magic trick in which she thrust a sword into a coffin... ...a coffin from which the body of the victim then spilled out -- dead from a fatal stabbing. The victim's name was Manov Mistree, otherwise known as \"The Great Mr. Reus.\" His blood was found on the sword that was used during the magic trick.Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:\nSo his death was just an unfortunate accident?Nahyuta:\nIt is only natural for one to assume as such, Your Honor... ...however, it was no mere accident, but rather... a homicide. The prosecution's position is thus: that this was a murder made to look like an accident.Judge:\nI see. And you believe this crime was committed by the defendant?Nahyuta:\n...After a thorough consideration of all possible scenarios... ...I, unfortunately, had no other choice but to conclude as much.Apollo:\n! (So that's how it's going to be, huh...)Athena:\nI guess Ema couldn't convince him after all...Judge:\n...Very well. And now, let us hear from the defense.Apollo:\nNaturally, we maintain that the defendant is innocent, Your Honor.Nahyuta:\n...If the defense wouldn't mind... ...could you please explain your reasoning?Apollo:\nMy reasoning...? Um, well... I would have to say that my main reason is because... I believe in the defendant.Nahyuta:\n...I see. So you find it difficult to come up with anything more concrete than that, do you? What a fine demonstration of the fact that you are indeed a lawyer of putrid mind.Apollo:\n...\"P-Putrid mind\"...?Judge:\nP-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Apollo:\nE-Excuse me, but I don--Nahyuta:Apollo:\n!Nahyuta:Judge:\n...If you don't mind my asking, Prosecutor, what was that you were just chanting?Nahyuta:\nA sutra of the Holy Mother that guides those of tainted soul toward enlightenment. It is a Khura'inist incantation to awaken the foolish from their fruitless slumber. Fitting for a lawyer who indulges in such fancy as the innocence of the accused.Judge:\nI-I see... So basically, you're asking the defense to \"get real\"?Nahyuta:\nAllow me these few words, defense. It is my duty as a monk to punish sinners, and to guide victims' souls to the Twilight Realm. Should you show repentance and admit to the accused's guilt now, no harm will come to you. But... should you interfere with my sacred last rites for the victim... ...then I shall cast you down into the pit of hell, along with Trucy Wright!Apollo:\n............N-Now wait just one minute here! \"Putrid\"?! \"Pit of hell\"?! Is that any way to address someone in a court of law?!Judge:\nHmm... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... That may be the way you conduct trials in Khura'in... ...but I would appreciate it if you would refrain from such charged language here.Nahyuta:\nYour Honor, that was but a Khura'inist sermon for those who have strayed from the path. Harsh words are often necessary to admonish contemptible deviants who cannot see reason.Judge:\nO-Oh, I see... I-I didn't realize...Athena:\nI guess they really do hate defense attorneys in Khura'in, huh. Even still, that was way, way over the top as far as verbal abuse goes.Apollo:\nAnd the trial's only just begun...Judge:\nHmm... Well, defense, I suppose the way a prosecutor does things varies by country. Why don't we look at this as cross-cultural exchange and try to be open-minded about it?Apollo:\nWhat?!Judge:\nBailiff, please bring in the first witness.Ema:\nMUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCHApollo:\n(Uh-oh. I thought she'd \"said goodbye\" to the Snackoos...)Ema:\nMUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCHJudge:\n............Detective Skye! The courtroom is no place for gorging yourself!Ema:\n......What's wrong with having a little snack? Girl's gotta eat, right?!Athena:\nShe, uh, seems a little stressed out.Nahyuta:\nDetective Skye, your testimony, please.Ema:\nY-Yeah, about that... I just want to state for the record that... I believe Trucy Wright is innocent!Judge:\nI-I'm sorry?!Nahyuta:\n...Detective Skye, this path you seek to follow is misguided. Giving the wrongdoer false hope will only deepen her despair in the end.Ema:\nBut I...!Nahyuta:\nLet it go, and move on. Acts which go against your duty will earn you divine punishment from the Holy Mother.Ema:\n! ............ MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH CHEW CHEW CHEW... ...Fine. I don't know about the \"divine\" part, but I get the \"punishment\" bit loud and clear...Athena:\nI guess Ema got assigned tons of paperwork or something for sticking up for Trucy...Apollo:\nShe and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi don't seem to get along very well, do they?Nahyuta:\nShall we continue? The prosecution contends that the accused had a clear motive. The evidence, if you would, Detective Skye.Ema:\nAll right... Please take a look at this poster. It's a Troupe Gramarye poster from thirteen years ago.Apollo:\nHm? Is it just me or is it a little different from the one in Ms. Wright's dressing room?Ema:\nThis is a revised version of that poster.Apollo:\nThis one says \"CANCELED\" under Mr. Reus.Ema:\nThat's right. Mr. Reus left the troupe after the first version of the poster was printed. Take a look at Mr. Reus's right forearm, near his elbow. See the big scar there? He apparently got that when he made a mistake while practicing a magic trick.Apollo:\n(Ouch. That's quite a scar...)Ema:\nBecause of the accident, Magnifi Gramarye concluded Mr. Reus was too unskilled. Just before the show was to open, Magnifi announced Mr. Reus wouldn't be appearing. But in defiance of Magnifi's decision, Mr. Reus tried to go on stage anyway. This, in turn, caused Magnifi to oust Mr. Reus from the troupe on the spot.Judge:\nHe kicked Mr. Reus out? That seems rather extreme. Did he really have to go that far?Nahyuta:\nWhen it came to magic, Troupe Gramarye was so passionate... ...or should I say \"extreme,\" about it that it caused problems for them from time to time.Judge:\nHmm... Yes, they even caused this court a mountain of trouble with their extreme antics.Nahyuta:\nAnd now, the troupe's successor has committed a murder. It seems the troupe's rare talent was inherited by the right person after all. A putrid talent for criminality.Apollo:\n........................Judge:\n............Y-You sound rather extreme yourself, Prosecutor.Nahyuta:\nCriminals with impure souls do not deserve sympathy, Your Honor.Ema:\nAhem! As I was saying... After his expulsion, Mr. Reus apparently went on to hold a grudge against the troupe.Nahyuta:\nHe would tell those close to him, \"I will get my revenge on Troupe Gramarye someday!\"Judge:\nRevenge, hmm? That certainly sounds antagonistic.Thirteen-Year-Old Poster updated in the Court Record.Nahyuta:\nAnd then, his chance for revenge finally came. If you would be so kind, Detective Skye?Ema:\n...I guess I don't have a choice, do I?Witness Testimony-- The Defendant's Motive --Ema:\nThe victim planned to get his revenge on Troupe Gramarye during Trucy's magic show.\nMr. Reus was going to first steal the Gramarye notebook from the defendant.\nHe then intended to reveal the secrets behind their magic tricks during the show.\nThat was the victim's plan for revenge. And while he did, in fact, steal the notebook...\n...the defendant murdered him before he had a chance to reveal the secrets.Nahyuta:\nBy the time the accused had discovered the notebook's theft, it was too late. Her only option was to kill Mr. Reus, and make it look like an accident.Apollo:Apollo:\nThat's nothing but conjecture!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nThe victim's assistant, Bonny de Famme, gave the police a statement. She testified that just before the start of the show, Mr. Reus said... \"I'm going to reveal all of Troupe Gramarye's secrets on stage today!\"Apollo:\nWhat?!Athena:\nHmm... Well, that isn't exactly a great starting point for a rebuttal, is it...?Apollo:\nYou're telling me...Nahyuta:\nAllow me to give you one piece of advice, defense.Apollo:\nOh? And what's that?Nahyuta:\nLet it go, and move on.Apollo:\nExcuse me?Nahyuta:\nHelping a sinner will only sully your own soul. One possessed of an unclean soul will burn in the flames of hell... ...and then be ever burdened with that sin in their next life.Apollo:\nB-But I don't believe in that sort of thing... Besides, I have no intention of giving up!Nahyuta:\nO Holy Mother, grant me the strength to deal with this putrid lawyer. All actions have consequences, and yours will surely earn you the honor of being... ...a mere stink bug, at best, in your next life.Apollo:\nA stink bug?!Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Stink Bu-- I mean, Mr. Justice. Your cross-examination, please.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Defendant's Motive --Ema:\nThe victim planned to get his revenge on Troupe Gramarye during Trucy's magic show.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nRevenge after all this time? It's been thirteen years already. Why now?\nEma:\n...I know, right? I thought that was pretty sketchy, myself. I mean, wouldn't he have done it a long time ago, if he was gonna do it? After all--\nNahyuta:\n\nNahyuta:\nDetective Skye, self-indulgent outbursts such as those will earn you divine punishment. In the form of a salary evaluation.\nEma:\nEep! .........MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH!\nApollo:\n(Wait, THAT'S what \"divine punishment\" means?)\nNahyuta:\nLet the detective have her snack. This humble servant of the Holy Mother shall explain. Over a decade ago, Troupe Gramarye was at the height of their popularity. But then their reputation declined, and they had all but faded from public memory. Until recently, that is, when Trucy Wright sought to recapture their former glory.\nJudge:\nThe defendant? And at such a young age, too! How impressive!\nNahyuta:\n...Yes, the accused's skill at magic is undeniably impressive. If she hadn't fallen onto the path of sin, she would have had a bright future ahead of her.\nJudge:\nHmm... It's always sad to see such promising young potential go to waste... Now, then, Detective Skye. How did Mr. Reus plan to get his revenge? And please put down the Snackoos before you continue with your testimony.\nEma:\nMUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. ...Yes, Your Honor.Ema:\nMr. Reus was going to first steal the Gramarye notebook from the defendant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWhat evidence do you have that Mr. Reus actually stole the notebook?\nEma:\n...Well, you see... I... ...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH!\nApollo:\nUm, whenever you're ready, Detective...\nNahyuta:\nFret not, Detective Skye. You have nothing to repent for. You should be proud of the fine forensic discovery that you made.\nApollo:\n\"Forensic discovery\"? And what did she discover, specifically?\nNahyuta:\nDetective Skye identified a certain set of fingerprints on the notebook. Upon further inspection, she determined that they belonged to Mr. Reus.\nApollo:\nWhat?!\nNahyuta:\nThe detective found the fingerprints entirely of her own volition. For that, I must say well done, Detective Skye.\nEma:\nUrk! ...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.\nApollo:\n(Get a little too addicted to using your precious white powder, did you, Ema?)\nNahyuta:\nNow, Detective Skye, I would ask you to explain... ...exactly how Mr. Reus intended to use the notebook to exact his revenge.\nEma:\nAll right... Well, first, he stole the notebook...Ema:\nHe then intended to reveal the secrets behind their magic tricks during the show.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n\"I'm going to reveal all of Troupe Gramarye's secrets on stage today!\" That's what Mr. Reus himself said, right?\nEma:\nRight, but he didn't exactly specify which \"Gramarye secrets\" he was talking about.\nApollo:\nBut the prosecution thinks he was referring to the secrets behind Troupe Gramarye's magic?\nNahyuta:\nYes, that is the prosecution's assertion. When the accused realized that Mr. Reus was to reveal... ...her family's most closely-guarded secrets, she naturally panicked.\nApollo:\n(So basically... ...Trucy's notebook was hiding in Mr. Reus's things because he had stolen it himself?)\nJudge:\nI see... Truly, a motive that only a magician could have.\nEma:\n...Yes. That's what the prosecution believes, anyway...Ema:\nThat was the victim's plan for revenge. And while he did, in fact, steal the notebook...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nDo you really believe what you're saying, Detective Skye? Do you really think Ms. Wright killed Mr. Reus to stop him from getting his revenge?\nEma:\nO-Of course I don't think that!

She's really been risking everything for us.) Well, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? What are your grounds for claiming homicide?\nNahyuta:\nIt was the luminous tape in the understage passage. I realized that it had been moved. Moved so that Mr. Reus would climb up into the downstage coffin by mistake.\nApollo:\nWhat?!\nNahyuta:\nMr. Reus, who was waiting in the understage passage... ...was supposed to have used the upstage ladder, shown here on the left. He was to climb up into the coffin that had been set up in the backstage area.

Really?Apollo:\nThe prosecution is claiming that Ms. Wright moved the understage tape during the show... ...in order to guide the victim into the coffin downstage. But it doesn't make sense that she would leave prints on the tape at that time.Judge:\nIt doesn't?Apollo:\nPlease consider the fingerprinting results of the main coffin... ...which shows that not one of my client's fingerprints was found on or in it.Ema:\nThat's true... We didn't find any of her prints on that coffin. ............Hm?Apollo:\nI think you've realized what the flaw in your testimony is. Claiming Ms. Wright left prints on the tape during the show is inconsistent with the facts. Because she was wearing gloves during the show.Ema:\nOh!Apollo:\nShe must've left the prints sometime BEFORE the show started. In other words, her prints do NOT prove she moved the tape to mislead the victim. The prosecution's investigation was insufficient!Ema:\nOh, my! ............But, on a personal level, I'm very happy about that!Judge:\nWell, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? If the defense's argument is true... ...then you have no evidence the defendant moved the tape to deceive the victim.Nahyuta:\nI see... Apparently, the defense is more intelligent than I had thought... More than a stink bug, at any rate.Apollo:\nCome on. You can bump me up to at least a stag beetle now, can't you?Athena:\nWould that really be any better?Apollo:\nOf course! WAY better! Stag beetles are cool, with those huge mandibles of theirs!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nIf the defense wishes to be promoted to a stag beetle... ...then answer me this question.Apollo:\nAll right. Shoot.Nahyuta:\nEven with no evidence that the accused moved the tape to misguide the victim... ...the victim still climbed the ladder, using the tape as a guide... ...and entered the coffin on the stage. The accused then thrust her sword into said coffin with the victim in it.Judge:\nSo what you're saying is, the fact remains that the victim was stabbed to death, right?Nahyuta:\nPrecisely. However, this does drastically change one aspect of this case: If the accused did not lead the victim into the coffin on purpose... ...then it means the victim's death could have been accidental. If it was indeed an accident, the defense can argue that it was involuntary manslaughter.Judge:\nI see... If it was involuntary manslaughter, they could plead extenuating circumstances. And the severity of the crime could be mitigated.Nahyuta:\nDefense, if you believe the accused did not murder the victim... ...then do you argue that it was an accident?Apollo:\n(This is it -- the all-important question.) The defense argues that Mr. Reus's death was...An accident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nThe defense believes this incident was an unfortunate acci--\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nApollo! Wait! Wouldn't that mean we're admitting Trucy stabbed the victim?! If we do that, we won't be able to plead that Trucy was not at fault!\nApollo:\n...Oops.\nJudge:\nSo the defense argues that the victim's death was an accident, is that correct?\nApollo:\n(No, because I definitely can't allow Trucy to be implicated in the stabbing.)\nLeads to:\n\"The defense maintains that the defendant is entirely innocent.\"Murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The defense maintains that the defendant is entirely innocent.\"Apollo:\nThe defense maintains that the defendant is entirely innocent. We believe that it wasn't an accident, but murder. And, what's more, we believe it was committed by a third party.Ema:\nA-A third party?! As in the true culprit is someone else?Nahyuta:\nHmph. That is quite a brazen claim to make -- and one wholly without grounds. Your voice is as loud as your suit, and your mind echoes just as loudly in emptiness. Surely, you were but a loud red pepper in your previous life.Apollo:\nI've been demoted to a vegetable?!Athena:\nWow... I didn't know a person could be reincarnated as a non-sentient plant...Apollo:\nI-In any case! I DO have grounds to make this claim!Nahyuta:\n............Let us hear this reasoning of yours, then.Apollo:\nAll right. But before I give it, there is one question that we need to address. If the victim was killed by some third party... ...then the sword the defendant thrust into the coffin wasn't the cause of death. If that's the case, then how did we wind up with a dead body inside the coffin?Judge:\nNow let's hear your opinion, Mr. Justice. How did the victim's body wind up inside the coffin?He was killed in the coffin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nI suppose the victim might have been killed inside the coffin.\nNahyuta:\n...Exactly. And who was the one who thrust the sword into the coffin?\nApollo:\nIt was Ms. Wright, of cour-- Ack!\nNahyuta:\nYour Honor, it would appear the defense has finally given up. Please render your verdict.\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nNow wait just a minute! I said \"might have been.\" I didn't say \"definitely was.\"\nJudge:\nDid you really think such verbal acrobatics would get you off the hook?\nApollo:\n(Oh, if only I could've stuck the landing better...)\nJudge:\nWhy don't you try again, defense?\nLeads back to:\n\"How did the victim's body wind up inside the coffin?\"It was magic!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nThe defense would like to contend that it was magic. I've seen that kind of trick before. Money appearing in an empty box, for example.\nJudge:\nI see. And how does a trick like that work? What's the secret to it?\nApollo:\nThe appeal of magic is in the mystery, wouldn't you agree, Your Honor? Sometimes it's better to just accept it for what it is -- enjoy it, and move on.\nJudge:\n...The real mystery here... is how you passed the bar exam, Mr. Justice!\nApollo:\nAll right, let's just move on then, shall we...?\nJudge:\nWhy don't you try again, defense?\nLeads back to:\n\"How did the victim's body wind up inside the coffin?\"He was killed understage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"What if the victim was killed under the stage before being put into the coffin?\"Apollo:\nWhat if the victim was killed under the stage before being put into the coffin? In other words, what if the victim was already dead in the coffin from the get-go?!Judge:\nOh, I see! In that case, the defendant's sword wouldn't have been the cause of death. How do you respond, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta:\n............That is the third time.Judge:\nThe third time of what?Nahyuta:\nHyah!Apollo:\n............ Wh-What the heck is this?Nahyuta:\n\nHrnh!Apollo:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Owowowowow! M-My heaaaaaaaad! What do you think you're doing?!Nahyuta:\n\"Even the merciful Holy Mother loses patience if she is struck three times.\" Since you never learn, you needed to be punished.Apollo:\nWhy don't you let ME worry about what I need and don't need?!Nahyuta:\nIt is what you deserve for interfering with my sacred last rites for the victim. You are a brainless lawyer chasing phantoms. You know nothing. Let this humble servant of the Holy Mother give you an edifying sermon.Apollo:\nA sermon? Now?Nahyuta:\nThere is a passage in the sacred scriptures of Khura'inism. \"A cornered frog will swallow even a snake.\"Apollo:\nHuh?Judge:\n.........A cornered lawyer has unexpectedly struck back hard against the prosecution. Did I get it right?Nahyuta:\nNo, for I am not done with my sermon. \"And yet, the frog still dies, its belly bitten and torn from within.\"Apollo:\nJust great...Nahyuta:\nAnd in this case, you are that frog, defense.Apollo:\n...Um, what exactly is your point, anyway?Nahyuta:\nLet us assume for a moment that the victim was killed under the stage. Who, then, had the opportunity to do so during the show?Apollo:\nLet's see... The people in the show were...Nahyuta:\nBonny de Famme, the victim Mr. Reus, and Trucy Wright. Bonny de Famme was onstage throughout the entire show... ...as easily confirmed by the footage from the show. Which leaves us with only one suspect: Trucy Wright.Apollo:\nAgnk!Nahyuta:\nNow do you see? The accused killed Mr. Reus as he waited on standby in the understage passage... ...and then placed his dead body in the coffin above. Thus making the murder look like an accident!Apollo:\nNooooooooooooooooo!Nahyuta:\nO great and merciful Holy Mother... Thus, another putrid mind has been guided toward enlightenment.Apollo:\n(Ugh... I can't believe I swallowed his trick question whole.)Athena:Athena:\nSorry, but I have to raise an objection here!Apollo:\nAthena? What are you...?Athena:\nThere's something I want to point out, Apollo.Nahyuta:\nAnd who might you be? You strike me as a mere child in countenance.Athena:\nI may be young... ...but I have an attorney's badge just the same!Nahyuta:\nAnd you would contribute to this discussion in that capacity?Athena:\nI most certainly would! You just argued that the defendant killed the victim under the stage. But let me remind you that Ms. Wright... is a girl.Nahyuta:\n...Clearly. Surely you didn't raise an objection simply to point out such an obvious fact? Your Honor, please send for this little child's guardian to come take her home.Athena:Athena:\nB-But I'm not done with my sermon!Apollo:\nYou don't need to talk like Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, you know.Athena:\nListen. If the victim was killed in the understage passage... ...then his body would then have to be hauled up to the stage, right? However... ...Ms. Wright is a young girl -- and a pretty petite one, at that. She couldn't possibly have hefted that large body up and put it in the coffin!Judge:\nThat's true! It does seem like it would be a rather difficult task for the defendant... I don't think even I could do it.Athena:\nWhat do you think of that, Prosecutor?! Who's the child now?!Nahyuta:\nIn my religion, the priestesses of Khura'inism are revered as the pillars of our beliefs. So I naturally hold nothing but deep respect for women. I also think highly of the female perspective.Athena:\nSays the man who called this fair maiden a \"little child\"...Apollo:\n(Who's a \"fair maiden\"...?)Nahyuta:\nI agree that your point is worth discussing, defense. How, indeed, was the dead body raised up into the coffin? By the accused, Trucy Wright, that is.Athena:\nYou're committed to pointing the finger at her no matter what, huh! Then YOU explain how that'd even be possible!Nahyuta:\nBut of course. There was a way for even a small creature like her to raise the victim's body up.Athena:\n...Wait! You really CAN explain it?!Nahyuta:\nI foresaw that our arguments would come to this, so I have prepared a witness.Judge:\nWell, well. I admire your readiness, Prosecutor.Nahyuta:\nIt is really not that difficult when one can read the ultimate outcome of any trial.Athena:\nHe couldn't have REALLY predicted that things would turn out like this, could he?Apollo:\n(It's pretty hard to believe...)Ema:\n...Excuse me, but may I step down now?Judge:\nHmm... Yes, I suppose you may.Nahyuta:\nOne moment, Detective Skye.Ema:\n! U-Um... I'm sorry... for, you know... the way I handled all of this...Nahyuta:\nYou did a fine job, Detective. Your testimony was invaluable.Ema:\nIt was?Nahyuta:\nYes. You served well as a detective, and did not allow your personal feelings to interfere. You overcame the conflicted emotions you felt and performed your duty admirably. You will be rewarded for your fine work.Ema:\n............Oh! Uh, thank you.Nahyuta:\nI hope we can work together again in the future.Apollo:\n(Ema seems bewildered by the unexpected praise.)Athena:\nI guess he's a pretty nice person like they say -- as long as you're not up against him.Judge:\nNow, then. Let us call the next witness.Nahyuta:\nWitness, please state your name and occupation.Bonny:\nHello, ladies and gentlemen of the court! It's very nice to meet all of you! I'm a lagomorph-ing illusionist from the land of fairy tales, Bonny de Famme! I can't wait to do some magic tricks for all of you!Nahyuta:\nPlease, witness... There is a time and a place for all things, including magic.Bonny:\nAw! B-But... But it would be okay if I do just a LITTLE magic, right? Come on! Please? Look! Everybody is waiting! Now's my chance to shine!Nahyuta:Bonny:\n!Nahyuta:\nThat is your second time...Bonny:\nMy second time doing what?Nahyuta:\n...There will be no further warnings. You should know that from our preparatory meeting, correct?Bonny:\nYeep!Apollo:\n(Is no one exempt from His Holiness's rosary of suffering...?)Judge:\nMay we have your testimony, witness? Once you've recovered from your disappointment...Bonny:\nWell, as a huge fan of Trucy's... ...I don't really want to testify against her... But I guess I have to... don't I?Apollo:\n(As a \"huge fan of Trucy's,\" huh...)Bonny:\nI hate her. I LOATHE her! I can't stand that Trucy Wright! Just because she's a little good at magic, she thinks she's all that! So this is exactly what that sniveling brat deserves!Apollo:\n(Sure, you're a real fan, all right... Of destroying Trucy, you mean.)Witness Testimony-- The Understage Passage --Bonny:\nI really can't believe that Trucy killed Mr. Reus...\nI guess it's possible for a small girl to lift a dead body up if she used a stage lift...\nIs it possible...? Could Trucy really have...?\nIf Trucy did use a stage lift, I think she must've used stage lift #2...\nI was onstage for the entire show, by the way.Apollo:\nYou were onstage the whole time...? And you're sure about that?Nahyuta:\nThere is no question. The entire audience could testify to that fact. What's more, she is shown clearly in the TV show footage as well.Bonny:\nI couldn't possibly have killed Mr. Reus! Not little old me!Nahyuta:\nTherefore, the only person who could have killed the victim understage is the accused. Furthermore, by using a stage lift, even a petite young lady... ...could have raised the body up to the stage without difficulty.Apollo:\n(You've gotta be kidding me...)Judge:\nVery well. The defense may now cross-examine the witness.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Understage Passage --Bonny:\nI really can't believe that Trucy killed Mr. Reus...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou said you are a \"huge fan of Trucy's,\" isn't that right?\nBonny:\nOh, yes! I even became a magician because I wanted to be just like her! The first time I saw her, she was performing at the Wonder Bar. She was only in junior high back then, but she got up on stage with tons of confidence. And then, she proceeded to win my heart with her astonishing tricks and winning smile!\nApollo:\n(Hmm... She certainly sounds like she means all of that...)\nApollo:\nSo, finally being able to perform with her must have been quite a treat for you, right?\nBonny:\nOh, yes! After all, it was my chance to have her see me... ...not just as a fan, but as a fellow magician! ............But then that horrible accident happened...\nNahyuta:\n............It was not an accident. It was murder. Witness, please explain, if you would... ...how a small young woman such as Trucy Wright could have raised the body.Bonny:\nI guess it's possible for a small girl to lift a dead body up if she used a stage lift...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWhat makes you think it would be possible? It's not like you tried it out yourself, right?\nBonny:\nWell, uh... Actually, we did try it out for ourselves.\nApollo:\nYou did?!\nNahyuta:\n...Detective Skye, if you would.\nEma:\nOh! ...S-So that's why you made me do that!\nApollo:\nDetective Skye, what did he have you do?\nEma:\nThe prosecutor asked me to try raising one of the male police officers with the stage lift. Without a single word of explanation as to WHY he was making me do it!\nApollo:\nYou're kidding...\nAthena:\nIt's as if he really CAN foresee all of our counterarguments...\nNahyuta:\n...Hmph. Do not underestimate this humble servant of the Holy Mother.\nApollo:\nMore like \"haughty\"...\nBonny:\nI guess that means Trucy COULD have lifted the dead body up... Does that mean...?Bonny:\nIs it possible...? Could Trucy really have...?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nIs what possible...? \"Could Trucy really have\" what, Ms. de Famme? Please finish your sentence.\nBonny:\nEek! Well, I-I...\nApollo:\nDon't try to beat around the bush! Come right out and say it. Why not tell this court what you REALLY believe?!\nBonny:\nWhat I REALLY believe? Of course I... Of course I don't believe Trucy could ever commit murder! Such an amazing and wonderful magician would never do such a thing! But... taking all the facts into account... what else can I think?\nApollo:\n(I know of at least three other unflattering things you REALLY think about Trucy...)\nNahyuta:\n\nNahyuta:\nHow can you attack this girl when she is obviously speaking with reserve?\nJudge:\nThere is such a thing as \"reading between the lines,\" Mr. Justice. It's sad how the youth of today lack the ability to do such a basic thing. ............\nApollo:\n(Looking at me like that isn't going to help me stick my foot in my mouth less, Your Honor.)\nNahyuta:\nWitness, please describe what the accused might have used to lift the dead body.\nBonny:\nAll right...Bonny:\nIf Trucy did use a stage lift, I think she must've used stage lift #2...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nStage lift #2? You mean the stage lift shown here on the left?\nBonny:\nThat's right. With a stage lift... ...I'd think even a small girl could easily lift a dead body up to the stage.\nApollo:\nAnd so that makes her the murderer, in your opinion?\nBonny:\nO-Of course not! I believe in Trucy! Like I said, I'm a huge fan of hers!\nApollo:\n(Oh, brother. How long is she gonna keep this act up?)\nNahyuta:\nDefense, what position was stage lift #2 in after the show?\nApollo:\nLet's see... If I recall, it was in the fully raised position. ...AHHH!\nNahyuta:\nAnd the reason why it was fully raised... ...is because the accused used it to lift the victim's body. Wouldn't you agree?\nApollo:\nNnngggh...!\nNahyuta:\nFeel free to slowly mull it over while you roast over the flames of hell, you evil red pepper!\nApollo:\n(So now I'm also \"evil\"...?)Bonny:\nI was onstage for the entire show, by the way.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou didn't have a single spare moment to slip down to the understage passage?\nBonny:\nD-Don't tell me you suspect ME now?\nApollo:\nI'm just trying to do my job by fully examining your alibi. Depending on how solid it is, I might have to suspect you, yes.\nBonny:\n...You gotta be kidding me! Don't spit on my head and tell me it's raining, lawyer boy! I'm right there in the footage! Or are you too much of an idiot to see?!\nApollo:\nHuh?\nJudge:\nM-Ms. de Famme? Are you feeling all right? You seem... suddenly different...\nBonny:\n............Oh, uh, oops! Where did THAT come from, right? Oh, my! I seem to have snapped there for a second, didn't I? Tee hee!\nApollo:\n(You didn't just snap -- you broke character just now.)\nBonny:\nIn any case, I was onstage the whole time, performing magic! I mean, you saw me in the footage, right? My dazzling and flawless performance?\nApollo:\n\"Flawless\"? That's odd, considering what you told me. You said that you'd made a mistake with where you positioned Mr. Hat.\nBonny:\nNgh!\nJudge:\nMs. de Famme, to what is the defense referring?\nBonny:\nW-Well, I made a little mistake on stage... I was in charge of operating Mr. Hat, you see. According to the script, I was supposed to place him to the left of the coffin. But I flubbed it up, and made him stand to the right of the coffin instead.\nApollo:\n(And because of that mistake... ...Trucy had to move the stage lifts around.)\nBonny:\nI feel really bad about messing Trucy up like that with my goof. Tee hee!Athena:\nI wonder if it's really possible for a small girl to lift a dead body up like Bonny claims.Apollo:\nI guess it's possible with a stage lift...Athena:\nProsecutor Sahdmadhi also said Trucy was the only one who could've done it understage.Apollo:\n(This testimony sure isn't doing our case any favors...)"

(Oh, wait, that's Khura'inese...)Judge:\nWh-What sort of terrible place is \"Pahpul Boljhig\"?Nahyuta:\nA place where the more one struggles, the further one falls into the abyss.

Khura'inist hell is closer to home than I thought...Judge:\nNow, then. It would appear that the witness's testimony supports the prosecution's claims... ...that the defendant is the only one who could have killed the victim understage.Apollo:\nGrk... (How are we supposed to get out of this jam?)Athena:\n...Hey, Apollo? If you can't find any contradictions... ...maybe it's time to use analytical psychology!Apollo:\nYou mean...?Athena:\nI heard some discord in Bonny's voice while she was testifying.NOISE LEVEL100%Athena:\nSee? Widget is picking up on the noise in her heart, too.Apollo:\n(That's right. Athena can hear things others can't with her super-sensitive hearing. She can hear the emotions people suppress as a kind of noise or discord in their voices.) ...All right, Athena. Let's give it a try.Athena:\nYou got it!Athena:Athena:\nYour Honor! I'm afraid that our witness, Ms. de Famme... ...is suffering under terrible traumatic stress due to this horrible incident.Judge:\nShe is?Athena:\nYes, what with that terrible death on stage... ...and her beloved Trucy getting arrested, she's under awful strain and shock. In fact, I don't know how much more she can take before she is unfit to testify.Bonny:\nWhat?!Judge:\nI've heard of that. What is it called? \"Postal Stress Disorder,\" right? It's where a person becomes uncontrollably angry, I think... I read about it somewhere.Athena:\n...That's \"going postal,\" Your Honor. This is PTSD.Judge:\nOh, my. So that's why the witness acts so hostile at times -- as if she were a different person.Athena:\nYes. And I think her condition is clouding her memory of the incident. Therefore, I suggest a short therapy session for the witness!Bonny:Bonny:\nHuuuh? Therapy?! You don't know the first thing about a magician's mental strength! I've risked my life jumping through rings of fire and having my body sawn in half! Oopsie! Boy, I have to watch my temper, don't I? Tee hee!Judge:\nMs. Cykes, please do whatever you can to help this unfortunate young lady.Nahyuta:\nAnd what exactly is this child planning to do, Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nWith her super-sensitive hearing, Ms. Cykes can hear a witness's true emotions. Simply from tone and inflection, she can tell exactly what a person is feeling.Athena:\nI can even pick out feelings that a witness is trying to suppress or hide. Widget projects the emotions I hear into the Mood Matrix, where I can analyze them.Nahyuta:\nIt sounds like some sort of spurious devilry. Though I find it hard to believe, I must ask: How do emotions constitute evidence?Judge:\nHmm... While I won't say that emotions can be taken as evidence, per se... ...I have seen how instrumental Ms. Cykes's work has been in cracking a case. Therefore, I wholly support giving it a try.Nahyuta:\n...I see. If you are in favor of it, Your Honor, then I have no objections. Even this mere monk can see that something disturbs the witness.Bonny:\nHmph! I'll disturb YOU!Athena:\nOh, thank you for understanding, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Apollo, you remember how to conduct a therapy session, right?Apollo:\nYou want ME to lead the session?Athena:\nOf course. You're the lead on this case, after all.Apollo:\n(Fair enough. But, hmm... Do I need a refresher?)Request an explanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nOkay, but I think I could use a refresher. So Bonny's emotions are shown here in the Mood Matrix, right?\nAthena:\nExactly. The emotions I pick up on from her testimony are projected into this program. The Mood Matrix gives a visual representation of a witness's testimony and emotions. These four mood markers reflect fluctuations in a witness's emotions. As testimony unfolds, the mood markers flash in reaction to the witness's feelings. When the witness feels happy or is enjoying the memory, the \"Happy\" marker will light up. When the witness feels angry or frustrated, the \"Angry\" marker will react. When the witness feels sad or is scared by a memory, the \"Sad\" marker will blink. And when the witness feels surprised or confused, the \"Surprised\" marker will tell us.\nApollo:\nOkay. I remember now. I need to find a conflict between what she's saying and which mood markers are blinking?\nAthena:\nThat's right. And Ms. de Famme definitely has some conflicted emotions! See?\n\nNOISE LEVEL100%\n\nAthena:\nWidget reacts to the suppressed emotions I pick up and projects them as noise. If we can pinpoint the inconsistencies between her testimony and her feelings... ...the noise level should drop to 0%, and the therapy session will be a success! When you find an unexpected emotion, first \"Pinpoint\" it with [L / LB / Q]... (Changed from [When you find an unexpected emotion, touch \"Pinpoint\" (L)...] in the original release) ...and then select the unexpected emotion or reaction from the four mood markers with [A / Space].

Now to give it a whirl.)\nLeads to Mood Matrix sessionNo need\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nI think I still remember from the last time, let's get right into it.\nAthena:\nOkey-dokey. You ready, Widget?\nWidget:\nLet's do this!\nLeads to Mood Matrix sessionBonny:\nI guess Trucy is the one who killed Mr. Reus...Bonny:\nEven she could move the body with that lift.Bonny:\nI was onstage at the time.Bonny:\nBut that terrible mistake...Bonny:\n...My stupid flub caused Trucy so much trouble!Bonny:\nI feel so bad about it.Pinpoint Happy marker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I have to say, Ms. de Famme, you certainly are a strange one.\"Apollo:\nOkay, so I look for inconsistencies between her testimony and her emotions, right?Athena:\nThat's right. Like if she says \"I was so happy!\" when the \"Sad\" marker is lit up... ...or if the \"Sad\" marker doesn't react, even though she says she was feeling down. When you find an unexpected emotion, go ahead and \"Pinpoint\" it.Apollo:\n(Okay. I'll give it a try.)Apollo:\nI have to say, Ms. de Famme, you certainly are a strange one. Even though you said, \"I feel so bad about it,\" it seems you were feeling happy about it.Bonny:\nNnnnnngh... Ouch!Apollo:\nI think I can guess why you were feeling happy. It must be because...It was Trucy's big debut\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nI think you were happy because it was Ms. Wright's big debut. You're a big fan of hers, after all, right?\nBonny:\nYou kidding me, forehead boy?! Why in the world would I be HAPPY about HER debut?!\nJudge:\nWh-What did you just say, Ms. de Famme? I thought you said you were Trucy Wright's biggest fan?\nBonny:\nOopsy! Y-Yes, of course I was happy for her! Ho ho ho!\nApollo:\n(Her act is starting to get pretty sloppy...) All right. If that wasn't it, then maybe it was something else.\nLeads back to:\n\"I think I can guess why you were feeling happy. It must be because...\"You made a mistake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nI think you were happy because of your own mistake. Maybe you don't have confidence in yourself, so your mistake gives you a reason to quit.\nBonny:\nMe? Lack confidence?! What a bunch of hooey! I've got confidence oozing out of every pore on my body! If I could bottle it, I'd be rich!\nApollo:\nRight... Well, it certainly wouldn't be off of MY money... Look, just let me try one more time, Ms. de Famme.\nLeads back to:\n\"I think I can guess why you were feeling happy. It must be because...\"You messed Trucy up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I think you were happy because you messed the defendant up.\"Apollo:\nI think you were happy because you messed the defendant up.Bonny:\nNnnnnnngh...Apollo:\nI'm right, aren't I?!Bonny:\nY-Y-You gotta be kidding me! Why would I be happy I messed Trucy up? I'm a big fan of hers!Apollo:\nBecause we saw you.Bonny:\nI hate her. I LOATHE her! I can't stand that Trucy Wright! Just because she's a little good at magic, she thinks she's all that! So this is exactly what that sniveling brat deserves!Apollo:\nWe saw how you said you hated Trucy Wright. How you were glad she was in trouble and even how it was \"what she deserved.\"Bonny:\nOuch.Apollo:\nIt looks like I hit the bunny on the head, so to speak.Bonny:\n............Nnngrr...NOISE LEVEL50%Athena:\nApollo, the noise level dropped! Now if we could get it down to 0%...!Apollo:\n...Well, Ms. de Famme? Are you ready to confess how you really feel?Bonny:\n...Wh-What? What do you mean? I'm Bonny -- the sweet, cute little bunny! I'm a rookie magician working hard to be just like my idol, Trucy! That's the character I'm supposed to be!Athena:Athena:\nKeep that up, Ms. de Famme, and you're going to have a mental breakdown. Just let yourself be who you really are!Bonny:\nWh-Who I really am?Athena:\nThe two sides of you are fighting each other and doing you psychic harm. I can hear them -- two distinct voices battling inside you.Bonny:\nSh-Shut your pie hole, you know-nothing know-it-all! Urk! I-I mean, you mustn't say things like that, or I might get flustered!Apollo:\nMs. de Famme, how long do you insist on maintaining this wolf in sheep's clothing act? We can't end this therapy session until you get real with us. Set the wild beast inside you free!Bonny:\nOuch. Urrgh... ...Grrrrr!........................Heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha!Bonny:\nDon't make me laugh! You don't know a dang thing about me. You wanna see who I really am? Fine! Take a good look! Kee hee hee... Kee kee kee kee!Apollo:\nWh-What in the world...?!Bonny:\nSheep's clothing?! You've got it all wrong! It's a rabbit suit I've got on! And I'm not a wolf. I'm a blood-sucking vampire! A bat with fangs and wings! Kee hee hee! Kee kee kee kee kee!Athena:\nEeeeeek! I-I think we just opened Pandora's box...Bonny:\nKee kee kee kee! I'm finally done with that goody-two-shoes cottontail act! I feel free as a bat! Kee kee kee!Judge:\nDefense! Your \"therapy session\" has taken a turn for the worse, from the looks of it!Apollo:\nTh-There's... a perfectly good explanation for this... isn't there, Ms. Cykes?Athena:\nUm... Eh heh... Methinks I created a monster...Widget:\nWe blew it!Bonny:\nHey, you! Lobster boy!Apollo:\nWh-Who, ME?!Bonny:\nYou think I'm glad Trucy is in trouble -- that I think she's getting her just desserts? Well, guess what... ...you're right! Kee hee hee! Kee kee kee kee!Apollo:\nUm... Does this mean you admit to wishing the defendant harm?Bonny:\nWell, the bat is out of the bag now! Kee hee hee! That mistake of mine was a work of art! Thanks to my goof, poor little Trucy had to do all of that hard physical labor.Apollo:\nWhen you say \"hard physical labor,\" what are you referring to?Bonny:\nBecause of Mr. Hat's new position, Trucy had to move both of those huge stage lifts! They must've been sooo heavy... What a riot! Kee hee hee!Apollo:\n(...That's strange...) Athena, could you please add that last statement to Bonny's testimony?Athena:\nAll right. I'll update the Mood Matrix with the new info. ......Hm? Hey, Apollo. Now there's a new inconsistency in the testimony.Apollo:\nYeah. She finally slipped up. So what do I need to do now?Athena:\nWell, from this point onward, you just do what you do best. Find the contradiction in the testimony and present evidence to refute it!Apollo:\n(All right. I've got you now, Bonny de Famme!)Bonny:\nI guess Trucy is the one who killed Mr. Reus...Bonny:\nEven she could move the body with that lift.Bonny:\nI was onstage at the time.Bonny:\nYou know what? Serves her right! Kee kee kee kee!Bonny:\nThanks to that, she ended up having to move the stage lifts.Present Trucy's Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...That doesn't make sense.\"Apollo:\nThere's definitely a contradiction in her testimony.Athena:\nSo just present evidence like you always do. And since we finally found something, I'd say we can call the therapy session a success!Apollo:\nYou call Batsy McBatty over there a \"success\"...?Apollo:\n...That doesn't make sense.Bonny:\nWhat?! So you think I'm crazy now?!Apollo:\nNo. That's not the point I was trying to make.Bonny:\nBut I don't hear you denying it!Apollo:\nMs. de Famme, allow me to repeat your statement: \"Thanks to that, she ended up having to move the stage lifts.\"Bonny:\nKee hee hee! That's right! And I still say that's just what she deser--Apollo:\nBut how did you know? How did you know Ms. Wright moved the stage lifts?Bonny:\nHuh?Apollo:\nAccording to her own statement... ...she didn't tell anyone that she had done so.Bonny:\nWH-WHAT?!Apollo:\nSo how could you possibly have known what she had done, unless... you saw her...? You saw Ms. Wright moving the lifts in the understage passage, didn't you!NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYEAthena:\nYou did it, Apollo! Noise levels are at 0%!Judge:\nB-But, Mr. Justice! Wouldn't that mean...?Apollo:\nYes, Your Honor. Ms. de Famme herself was under the stage where the victim was killed. And I hardly need to tell the court what that means...Bonny:\nNnnnngh...Apollo:\nYou are one artful liar, Ms. de Famme, and one spectacular suspect!Bonny:\nKeeyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Wh-Why, you shiny red lobster boy! You're saying I killed Mr. Reus?!Apollo:\nI'm saying that it's a possibility. What's more... ...I say you had a solid motive to frame my client for the murder as well.Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nMy apologies for raining on the defense's merry revelry... ...but you seem to have forgotten one very important point.Apollo:\nOh, really?Nahyuta:\nThe TV footage. As you can clearly see... ...Ms. de Famme was on the stage the whole time. The entire audience can bear witness to that fact -- including you.Apollo:\nOh, yeah...Nahyuta:\nYou have just taken a long and senseless journey, only to return to the starting line. The witness could not have been in the understage passage, which means... ...the only one left who could have killed the victim is the accused!Apollo:\nAck!Athena:\nGuess the party's over.Apollo:\nNnngh... B-But... ...Ms. de Famme knew something she couldn't have known unless she was under the stage! How do you explain that, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta:\nIt's quite simple: The accused must have told Ms. de Famme about it, but then forgot.Apollo:\nHrrrmm...Bonny:\nHa! Open those useless eyes of yours and take a good look at the footage!Athena:\nHmm... If Ms. de Famme really WAS in the understage passage... ...it would mean she was onstage and understage at the same time.Apollo:\nYou mean, she was in two places at once? ...........That does seem to be the only explanation that makes any sense...Athena:\nIt may be an \"explanation,\" but I'm not so sure about the \"makes sense\" part.Apollo:\nThen we'll just have to MAKE it make sense! Your Honor, the witness was both onstage and understage at the same time. That is the defense's assertion!Judge:\n.........Hmm... I've heard some illogical things come out of you before, but this is absurd.Apollo:\nI'm sure you'll change your tune once you hear my reasoning, Your Honor.Judge:\nMy gut tells me you're bluffing, but I'll bite. Very well, Mr. Justice. How do you explain how the witness was in two places at once?She teleported\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nLet's not forget that Ms. de Famme's specialty is teleportation magic. With teleportation, she can be in two places at practically the same time!\nNahyuta:\n............\nJudge:\n............So you believe that teleportation actually exists?\nApollo:\nWell, you know what magicians always say about their magic: \"It's all real! No tricks or gimmicks involved!\"\nJudge:\n............Well, I have listened patiently to your reasoning... ...and the only thing dispelled is the false air of competency you tried to project.\nApollo:\nHa ha, I see what you did there. Good one, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHo ho ho. You might be surprised to hear this, but... ...I used to be known as the \"Jokester Judge\"!\nApollo:\n(Well, at least I avoided a penalty with some well-placed brown-nosing.) Please let me try again, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"Very well, Mr. Justice.\"There were two Bonnys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"............There were two Bonnys, Your Honor.\"The Bonny onstage was fake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nThe Bonny de Famme onstage was fake.\nJudge:\nF-Fake? Really...?\nNahyuta:\n...Such an assertion is not something one would expect to hear from a genuine lawyer.\nJudge:\nOh! Maybe YOU are the fake, and your attorney's badge is made out of cardboard!\nApollo:\nNo, no! I'm the real thing, I swear! ...And why cardboard, specifically...?\nJudge:\nLet's just say I had an infuriating experience once thanks to one... In any case, your fake Bonny theory doesn't sound very convincing.\nAthena:\nIt's not a bad idea, in theory... ...but I think the one on the stage was the real Bonny. You can just tell.\nApollo:\n(If the one on the stage wasn't fake... ...does that mean the one understage was real, too...?) Please let me try again, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"Very well, Mr. Justice.\"Apollo:\n............There were two Bonnys, Your Honor. If that were the case, it would all make sense, wouldn't it?Judge:\nThere were...Athena:\n...Two of them?Nahyuta:\nI suspected you had a few screws loose, but now I see some are missing altogether. Is there a tool kit in this courtroom, Your Honor? I suppose two... no, three screws to the head should righten his putrid brain...Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Bailiff, could you--Apollo:Apollo:\nNo, wait! Please listen to my argument!Judge:\nVery well. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to at least give it a listen.Apollo:\nAs was argued earlier... ...Ms. de Famme is shown in the footage the whole time. But, at the same time, she was also watching Ms. Wright in the understage passage. The only possible explanation is that there are two Bonnys.Judge:\nHmm... That almost sounds like it makes sense...Judge:\nWhat do you think, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta:\n............This humble servant of the Holy Mother is of the opinion... ...that we should lose no time in replacing the defense's many lost screws.Athena:\nBut, Apollo, it goes against reality itself to say that one person is actually two.Apollo:\nBut we don't have to be bound by reality -- after all, we're talking about magic here. So, if the Bonny de Famme in the footage is the real Bonny... ...then the Bonny here on the witness stand, the one who must've been understage... This Bonny de Famme... ...is our \"second Bonny.\"Bonny:\nKeeeeeee!Athena:\nShe is?Apollo:\nSay we call the one in front of us \"Bonny #2.\" I believe I have just the piece of evidence to prove that a Ms. Bonny #2 exists.Judge:\nOh? Then please submit your evidence, Mr. Justice. What proves the existence of a Bonny #2?Present Fingerprinting Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What's this...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\nTHAT piece proves the existence of a second Bonny?\nApollo:\nIsn't it obvious, Your Honor?\nJudge:\n...Not in the slightest.\nApollo:\nWhat a coincidence... I was thinking the same thing.\nJudge:\nBut THIS should be plenty obvious!\nApollo:\n(Yikes. I really made him mad this time...)\nAthena:\nSo, another Bonny, huh? A \"Bonny #2\"... She's basically some yet unknown third party that was there in the theater, right?\nApollo:\nExactly. And I believe we have a piece of evidence that proves such a person exists. Your Honor, please let me try that again!\nJudge:\nVery well. But be warned that I won't let you get away with further shenanigans. Now then, Mr. Justice.\nLeads back to:\n\"What proves the existence of a Bonny #2?\"Judge:\nWhat's this...?Apollo:\nDuring our investigation, we found a set of unknown prints on the coffin on the stage. These prints were most likely left during the course of the show. But they didn't match the prints of any of the people involved in this case.Nahyuta:\nA-An unknown third party's fingerprints? ............I was not told of this.Athena:\nEma must've kept it from him.Apollo:\nSo the question is, who could these prints possibly belong to?Bonny:\n............Apollo:\nMs. de Famme... or should I say, \"Bonny #2\"... These are your fingerprints, aren't they?!Bonny:\nKeeyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nEnough of this foolishness! One person could not possibly be two! Those fingerprints could have been left, not only during the show, but at any time!Apollo:Apollo:\nIt's not like you to lose your cool like that, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.Nahyuta:\n............Apollo:\nAnd I'm sure you know that... ...exactly WHEN the fingerprints were made is not the main issue.Judge:\nWhat do you mean by that, Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nThe issue is WHO do these unknown prints belong to? They're certainly not Bonny de Famme's. But what if they belong to the person standing right in front of us?Judge:\nOh! You mean, Bonny #2 is the \"second Bonny\"? Is that what you're implying?Nahyuta:\n......Nngh. It's preposterous to suggest that those prints belong to the witness. I say they must belong to some other unknown individual.Apollo:\nProsecutor Sahdmadhi, can you really look at her and still say that?Bonny:\n............What're you lookin' at?! Take a picture -- it'll last longer!Nahyuta:\nHow could this be...?Apollo:\nIf we check her prints, I'm sure they'll match the unknown set. Well, \"Bonny\"? The prints that don't belong to the real you... ...belong to you, don't they, Bonny #2?!Bonny:\nKeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!Judge:\nW-Witness! Is what the defense has said true?Bonny:\n............Kee hee hee. Fine! I admit it! The fingerprints are mine!Judge:\nThen does that mean... you AREN'T Bonny de Famme...?Nahyuta:\nWhat?! Ridiculous!Judge:\nAre there really... two Bonnys?Bonny:\nNope! There's only one Bonny. That's because... I'm Betty! Betty de Famme!Apollo:\nWhat?Betty:\n......Ladies and gentlemen of the court, it's time for a wondrous magic show! Gasp in amazement as this lagomorph-ing illusionist performs her teleportation magic! Watch closely! It's showtime!Judge:\nWhat an amazing trick! The witness has suddenly split into two people!Betty:\nIt's not a trick! No gimmick to it, either!Bonny:\nWe're simply... twins!Apollo:\nWHAAAAAT?!Athena:\nTwins?!Apollo:\nSo that's how the teleportation trick works...Betty:\nEver since our debut, I've had to hide or pretend I'm Bonny. All cute and sweet and goody-goody... I can't tell you how stressful it's been! But I don't have to hide anymore!Bonny:\nThat's right! Our days of sneaking around are finally over!Apollo:\nTheir cover is blown, but they actually seem pretty happy about it...Athena:\nSo which one of you is the nice Bonny de Famme we met in the dressing room?Bonny:\nThat would be me...Apollo:\nAnd the sharp-tongued Bonny we saw with the Ratings Rajah understage was...?Betty:\nHey! Who are you calling \"sharp-tongued\"?!Apollo:\nIt's all starting to make sense now...Fingerprinting Results updated in the Court Record.Judge:\nSo, Mr. Justice, this changes the facts of the case rather dramatically, doesn't it?Apollo:\nIt certainly does. During the show, it was Bonny who was onstage the whole time. So Bonny couldn't have committed the crime. But Betty, on the other hand, who was understage, DID have the opportunity.Nahyuta:\nNgh...!Judge:\nW-Well! So we now have two suspects!Betty:Betty:\nWait just a minute there, lobster boy! I didn't do it!Bonny:\nThat's right. Betty might have a foul mouth, but she'd never kill anybody!Betty:\n...Hey! Who's got a foul mouth here?!Bonny:\nOh! Uh...Betty:\nWell?! Speak up! Huh?!Apollo:Apollo:\nPlease save your sibling squabbling for later.Betty:\n............Apollo:\nBetty, you must've been in the understage passage during the show. Otherwise, you wouldn't have known about the stage lifts being moved. So what exactly were you doing down there?Betty:\n...Fine! I'll testify! Anything to get you off my back!Judge:\nProsecutor Sahdmadhi, Betty de Famme is ready to testify. What do you say?Nahyuta:\n............Betty, you lied to this humble servant of the Holy Mother.Betty:\nHey, what else could I do? I couldn't blow our cover and ruin our magic act. Kee hee hee! Besides, am I gonna go to your twilight hell or whatever for being a liar?Nahyuta:\n...You will indeed. However, it won't be after your death. Rather... ...I shall give you a taste of your punishment on this mortal coil -- in interrogation hell.Betty:\nEek!Judge:\nNow, then, Betty de Famme. Please explain to this court... ...what exactly you WERE doing under the stage.Witness Testimony-- What Happened Understage --Betty:\nIt's true. I had business in the understage passage because of the upcoming trick.Bonny:\nIt was the fire trick, right? The one Mr. Reus was supposed to do?Betty:\nThat's right. It's a very dangerous trick, so I had to make sure we were prepared for it.Bonny:\nI-It was in the script... and I really wanted to see it... but I couldn't because of the accident.Betty:\nShut up! You're gonna give it away! ...Anyway, I was real busy.Bonny:\nYeah... Way too busy to have the chance to kill Mr. Reus...Apollo:\n............ (Well, that was certainly... different.)Betty:\nKee hee hee! How's THAT for a flawless testimony and alibi?! Our magic is real! It's not a trick or a gimmick!Judge:\nO-Oh, my! She's floating!Apollo:\n............Um, Your Honor... You can see she's being held up from below...Athena:\nYou were supposed to pretend you didn't see that. It's a little something called \"etiquette.\"Apollo:\nB-But... (I can't help it! Whenever I see a contradiction or inconsistency, I just HAVE to point it out!)Judge:\nNow, then. The defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What Happened Understage --Betty:\nIt's true. I had business in the understage passage because of the upcoming trick.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nIf you were in the understage passage, need I remind you, was the crime scene... ...then you most certainly should be counted as a potential suspect.\nBetty:\nBut I don't have any motive to kill Mr. Reus.\nApollo:\nBut you, by your own admission, hate Ms. Wright. When she was arrested as a suspect... ...you said it was \"what she deserved.\"\nNahyuta:\n \nNahyuta:\nSo you believe the witness killed a man, simply due to her dislike of Trucy Wright? As a motive, is that not improbable at best?\nApollo:\nBut what if her hatred caused her to bear a strong sense of malice against my client?\nBetty:\nLook, Trucy just made me mad, that's all. I mean, even though she's younger than me, she's got so much skill and popularity! And she's cute, besides! Grr! She makes me so mad, I wish she would drop dead!\nBonny:\nB-Betty, don't talk like that.\nBetty:\nShut yer yap!\nApollo:\n(So was it just simple jealousy?)\nBonny:\nSay, Betty, that next trick you were getting ready for...Bonny:\nIt was the fire trick, right? The one Mr. Reus was supposed to do?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n...Um, Bonny? We're trying to get Betty's testimony right now, so...\nBonny:\nOh! Right. I'm sorry.\nApollo:\nYou can step down if you'd like.\nBonny:\nI'm worried about Betty, though... She can lose her temper and say awful things sometimes...\nBetty:\nHey! What are you, my mother?! Don't forget! I'M the older sister! You got that?!\nBonny:\nMeep! Y-Yes, I got it.\nApollo:\n(I guess I'd worry about Mt. Betty constantly blowing her top if I were Bonny, too...) So, Betty, you were down understage getting ready for the fire trick, were you?Betty:\nThat's right. It's a very dangerous trick, so I had to make sure we were prepared for it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAnd you were taking every necessary precaution, is that right?\nBetty:\nOf course! Every precaution. After all, it's a very dangerous trick that uses real fire. I mean, we had to be ready in case the curtain caught on fire or something, right?\nAthena:\nBy the time people realized it wasn't a part of the act, it might be too late, huh.\nApollo:\n(If by \"people,\" you mean \"Athena Cykes,\" then yes.)\nJudge:\nWow, a fire trick... That sounds really impressive!\nBetty:\nKee hee hee! Your beard would go up in smoke, old man! bet people'd mistake you for a cue ball or something without it.\nJudge:\nA-A cue ball?!\nBonny:\nB-Betty, don't be rude to the judge.\nBetty:\nKee hee hee!\nBonny:\nU-Um, B-Betty, you know that fire trick...?Present Fire Bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I hate to break this to you, Betty, but there's a big flaw in your testimony.\"Bonny:\nI-It was in the script... and I really wanted to see it... but I couldn't because of the accident.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nI see the fire trick was a part of the script. It seems Mr. Reus was scheduled to perform it later in the show. Did you not get to see him practice it beforehand?\nBonny:\nNo. During rehearsal, he said he didn't feel well, so he couldn't breathe any fire for me.\nApollo:\nWait, let me get this straight: He couldn't breathe fire because he wasn't feeling well...?\nBonny:\n\"My magical powers appear to be on the wane today.\" That's what he said.\nApollo:\n(S-So it was just a part of his usual The Great Mr. Reus shtick...)\nBonny:\nIt's really too bad I didn't get to see the trick because of the incident... Wh-Which was completely unexpected, of course.\nBetty:\n! H-Hey!Betty:\nShut up! You're gonna give it away! ...Anyway, I was real busy.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nUmm... so what exactly do you mean by \"you're gonna give it away\"?\nBetty:\n............! See, Bonny?! You and your big mouth! Now lobster boy wants to know what we're talking about!\nBonny:\nEep! I'm sorry...\nApollo:\n............\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, well, if you were preparing for the next magic trick... ...I'm sure you wouldn't have had the time to commit murder.\nBetty:\nWow. Looks like the old geezer isn't senile just yet, huh! I bet you'll live a good, long life.\nJudge:\nHo ho ho. I plan to be sitting up here at least another ten years.\nAthena:\nTen more years? I don't know about that...\nApollo:\nWhat did we discuss about inner monologues, Athena?!\nBetty:\nWelp, more power to ya, I guess. I was so busy, I didn't have the time to off anybody!Bonny:\nYeah... Way too busy to have the chance to kill Mr. Reus...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAre you just trying to cover for Betty?\nBonny:\nN-No, of course not! I believe in my sister! I know she'd never murder anyone.\nApollo:\nBut you think my client would?\nBonny:\nNo! I believe in Trucy, too. I know she'd never murder anyone, either.\nApollo:\nWell, we just ran out of suspects, in that case.\nBonny:\nY-Yes, but...\nBetty:\nSee? You should've just kept your mouth shut, dummy. You're just making a fool of yourself. Just be nice and quite like a good little bunny, got it?\nBonny:\n...All right. I guess I'm no help...\nApollo:\n(Oh, boy... It's impossible to get anything out of Bonny with Betty right there.)Apollo:\nSo Betty was too busy getting ready for the next trick to have time for murder, huh?Athena:\nThere must be some way to prove that that wasn't the case..."

I had business in the understage passage because of the upcoming trick.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nIf you were in the understage passage, need I remind you, was the crime scene... ...then you most certainly should be counted as a potential suspect.\nBetty:\nBut I don't have any motive to kill Mr. Reus.\nApollo:\nBut you, by your own admission, hate Ms. Wright. When she was arrested as a suspect... ...you said it was \"what she deserved.\"\nNahyuta:\n \nNahyuta:\nSo you believe the witness killed a man, simply due to her dislike of Trucy Wright? As a motive, is that not improbable at best?\nApollo:\nBut what if her hatred caused her to bear a strong sense of malice against my client?\nBetty:\nLook, Trucy just made me mad, that's all. I mean, even though she's younger than me, she's got so much skill and popularity! And she's cute, besides! Grr! She makes me so mad, I wish she would drop dead!\nBonny:\nB-Betty, don't talk like that.\nBetty:\nShut yer yap!\nApollo:\n(So was it just simple jealousy?)\nBonny:\nSay, Betty, that next trick you were getting ready for...Bonny:\nIt was the fire trick, right? The one Mr. Reus was supposed to do?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n...Um, Bonny? We're trying to get Betty's testimony right now, so...\nBonny:\nOh! Right. I'm sorry.\nApollo:\nYou can step down if you'd like.\nBonny:\nI'm worried about Betty, though... She can lose her temper and say awful things sometimes...\nBetty:\nHey! What are you, my mother?! Don't forget! I'M the older sister! You got that?!\nBonny:\nMeep! Y-Yes, I got it.\nApollo:\n(I guess I'd worry about Mt. Betty constantly blowing her top if I were Bonny, too...) So, Betty, you were down understage getting ready for the fire trick, were you?Betty:\nThat's right. It's a very dangerous trick, so I had to make sure we were prepared for it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAnd you were taking every necessary precaution, is that right?\nBetty:\nOf course! Every precaution. After all, it's a very dangerous trick that uses real fire. I mean, we had to be ready in case the curtain caught on fire or something, right?\nAthena:\nBy the time people realized it wasn't a part of the act, it might be too late, huh.\nApollo:\n(If by \"people,\" you mean \"Athena Cykes,\" then yes.)\nJudge:\nWow, a fire trick... That sounds really impressive!\nBetty:\nKee hee hee! Your beard would go up in smoke, old man! bet people'd mistake you for a cue ball or something without it.\nJudge:\nA-A cue ball?!\nBonny:\nB-Betty, don't be rude to the judge.\nBetty:\nKee hee hee!\nBonny:\nU-Um, B-Betty, you know that fire trick...?Present Fire Bucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I hate to break this to you, Betty, but there's a big flaw in your testimony.\"Bonny:\nI-It was in the script... and I really wanted to see it... but I couldn't because of the accident.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nI see the fire trick was a part of the script. It seems Mr. Reus was scheduled to perform it later in the show. Did you not get to see him practice it beforehand?\nBonny:\nNo. During rehearsal, he said he didn't feel well, so he couldn't breathe any fire for me.\nApollo:\nWait, let me get this straight: He couldn't breathe fire because he wasn't feeling well...?\nBonny:\n\"My magical powers appear to be on the wane today.\" That's what he said.\nApollo:\n(S-So it was just a part of his usual The Great Mr. Reus shtick...)\nBonny:\nIt's really too bad I didn't get to see the trick because of the incident... Wh-Which was completely unexpected, of course.\nBetty:\n! H-Hey!Betty:\nShut up! You're gonna give it away! ...Anyway, I was real busy.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nUmm... so what exactly do you mean by \"you're gonna give it away\"?\nBetty:\n............! See, Bonny?! You and your big mouth! Now lobster boy wants to know what we're talking about!\nBonny:\nEep! I'm sorry...\nApollo:\n............\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, well, if you were preparing for the next magic trick... ...I'm sure you wouldn't have had the time to commit murder.\nBetty:\nWow. Looks like the old geezer isn't senile just yet, huh! I bet you'll live a good, long life.\nJudge:\nHo ho ho. I plan to be sitting up here at least another ten years.\nAthena:\nTen more years? I don't know about that...\nApollo:\nWhat did we discuss about inner monologues, Athena?!\nBetty:\nWelp, more power to ya, I guess. I was so busy, I didn't have the time to off anybody!Bonny:\nYeah... Way too busy to have the chance to kill Mr. Reus...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAre you just trying to cover for Betty?\nBonny:\nN-No, of course not! I believe in my sister! I know she'd never murder anyone.\nApollo:\nBut you think my client would?\nBonny:\nNo! I believe in Trucy, too. I know she'd never murder anyone, either.\nApollo:\nWell, we just ran out of suspects, in that case.\nBonny:\nY-Yes, but...\nBetty:\nSee? You should've just kept your mouth shut, dummy. You're just making a fool of yourself. Just be nice and quite like a good little bunny, got it?\nBonny:\n...All right. I guess I'm no help...\nApollo:\n(Oh, boy... It's impossible to get anything out of Bonny with Betty right there.)Apollo:\nSo Betty was too busy getting ready for the next trick to have time for murder, huh?Athena:\nThere must be some way to prove that that wasn't the case...Apollo:\nI hate to break this to you, Betty, but there's a big flaw in your testimony. As big as the one in that \"floating\" trick you did earlier.Betty:\nOoh, harsh words! Well, lemme tell you something, forehead boy! No one has ever figured out how we do our teleportation trick!Apollo:\nNo one except me, you mean.Betty:\nWell... hmph! We have even better tricks up our sleeves!Bonny:\n...Huh? We do?Betty:\nI told you to keep it zipped!Judge:\nNow, now. Don't fight, you two. Mr. Justice, what's this about a flaw in the testimony?Apollo:\nThe script has this to say about the fire trick: \"This will be dangerous. Make sure the fire bucket is ready!\" However, we found the fire bucket lying empty backstage except for a layer of dust.Betty:\nAck! I... I...Bonny:\nOuch!Apollo:\nYou didn't even ATTEMPT to get ready for the next trick, did you, Betty?!Betty:\nY-Ya got meeee!Judge:\nBetty de Famme! You will explain yourself!Betty:\nNnngh... T-There's nothing to explain.Bonny:\nCome on, Betty. We can't hide it any longer. We might as well tell them.Betty:\nShut up! You can barely take care of yourself! Don't try and tell me what to do!Apollo:\nWell, if neither of you will explain, I guess I'll have to. The reason Betty didn't prepare for the fire trick is because she...Is afraid of fire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nIt's because you're afraid of fire, right?\nBetty:\nKee hee hee! Are you kidding?! What kind of magician is afraid of fire? I should burn your hair off right now for that, starting with those stupid lobster antennae!\nJudge:\nI'm afraid the loss of one's hair is too great a penalty for anyone to pay, Ms. de Famme... I hope you can be satisfied with this penalty for Mr. Justice instead.\nApollo:\n(Now I really want to know how His Honor and his hair parted ways...) Your Honor, please let me try again.\nLeads back to:\n\"The reason Betty didn't prepare for the fire trick is because she...\"Knew the show wouldn't go on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You didn't prepare for the fire trick because you knew, didn't you?\"Was slacking off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nYou were supposed to prepare for the next trick, but you were slacking off, weren't you?\nBetty:\n............Yeah, okay. Whatever you say.\nApollo:\nYou should be ashamed of yourself, neglecting your duties like that.\nBetty:\nOh yes, I'm veeery sorry. It'll never happen again, honest.\nApollo:\n(Yes! I got a sorry out of her!)\nAthena:\n\nAthena:\nThat isn't going to do us any good, Apollo! All we got out of that was an apology.\nApollo:\nOh... Good point... I'm veeery sorry, Your Honor. It looks like I made a mistake?\nJudge:\nNo, it looks like your brain is the one slacking off. You should be ashamed of yourself!\nApollo:\nYipes! Your Honor! Please let me try again.\nLeads back to:\n\"The reason Betty didn't prepare for the fire trick is because she...\"Apollo:\nYou didn't prepare for the fire trick because you knew, didn't you? You knew that the body would be found, and that the show would then be canceled!Betty:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaagh! D-D-Don't be ridiculous, you insignificant speck of a man! I'm gonna yank those lame bangs of yours off. Is that what you want?! Huh?!Apollo:Apollo:\nWhatever -- they can grow back! Now stop stalling and just tell us the truth already!Betty:\n...Ngh! I-I can't reveal my secrets! I'm a magician!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nYou have been chasing the shadow of an illusory culprit, defense. And having chanced upon a convenient target, you have let yourself get carried away.Apollo:\n!Betty:\nExactly! Where's your proof?! Huh?!Nahyuta:\nAnd yet, I concede that the witness's taste for false words has also been proven. I advise you to confine your deceitful trickery to your magic act, witness!Betty:\nGrrrrr! D-Deceitful trickery?!Athena:Athena:\nAs your court-appointed therapist, I'd like to add something here, Betty. You finally let yourself be who you really are. But if you continue to hide behind lies, you'll just be imprisoning your heart all over again.Betty:\nHmph! But all these questions mean you're trying to put me in prison for real! So I'll be behind bars either way!Judge:\nDoes that mean you're admitting your guilt?Betty:\nOf course not! I can't believe you people! Every one of you thinks I did something I didn't do! You... ...lobster boy! Cue ball geezer! Head case brat! Cerberus monk!............Judge:\nCue ball... geezer?Athena:\nH-Head case brat? Really?Bonny:Bonny:\nB-Betty! Calm down! Come on, now! Deep breaths! Deep breaths!Betty:\n*huff*... *huff*... *huff*... L-Look... I'm not the murderer, I tell you!Apollo:\nThen how did you know the show would be called off before the fire trick?Betty:\nI... I told you. We can't reveal our secrets. We're... under contract.Apollo:\n(Contract? What is she talking about?) Be that as it may, you're obviously a suspect in this case.Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\n............I'm beginning to see... ...the karmic threads that make up the intricate tapestry that is this case.Apollo:\nHuh?Nahyuta:\nAllow me to summarize your assertions, defense. First, that the victim was killed in the understage passage. And second, that the witness and the accused are the only two who could have done it.Apollo:\nExactly. What's more, Betty knew that the body would be found... ...and that the magic show would then be called off. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that Betty killed the victim understage.Nahyuta:\nBut what if Betty knew that the show would be called off for some other reason?Apollo:\nLike what?Nahyuta:\n............In the course of my investigation... ...I found it strange that the dragon set piece fell when it did. That, in conjunction with the body tumbling from the coffin in such a dramatic fashion... ...all seemed too perfect for mere happenstance. It was as though the entire chain of events had been planned out in advance.Betty:\nK-Kee!Bonny:\nOuch!Apollo:\nPlanned out?Nahyuta:\nAfter deciding to take this case... ...I scrupulously studied everything I could about the mass media in this country. I read the newspaper, old news reports -- I even browsed tabloid magazines.Judge:\nHow very industrious of you! I'm impressed.Nahyuta:\nDuring this process, I learned about a strange practice favored by the TV world. A practice called the \"hidden camera prank.\"Betty:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!Nahyuta:\nBetty and Bonny, you knew about this, did you not? About the dead body appearing, the set piece falling, the show being suspended... You two were informed of this plan... ...by Take-2 TV in advance, correct?Betty:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!Apollo:\nI-Is that true...?Bonny:\nBetty! Please, let's tell them now! I can't hold it in anymore!Betty:\nNnnnnnnnnnnggggrrrrrrrrrrrr! D-Dang it! F-Fine, you got us! Everything the prosecutor said is true! The TV station paid us to cooperate with them on this plan! It was all a prank -- a big setup planned out in advance! Mr. Reus showing up dead in the coffin... The set piece falling down... It was all... completely scripted!Apollo:\nI-It was all...Judge:\n...A PRANK?! Bonny! Is this really true?!Bonny:\nYes. Mr. Reus was supposed to pretend to be dead. That's how it was supposed to go.Apollo:\nSo he was in on it, too?Betty:\nThat's right. He was supposed to show up \"dead\" in the coffin... ...and then the set piece would fall down. Trucy would be shocked and start to panic.Bonny:\nThat's how the prank script went...Apollo:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! (What the heck kind of prank is that?!)Betty:\nBut we never thought... ...he'd actually wind up dead...Bonny:\nYeah... That was the only thing that was different from the script. Poor Mr. Reus...Apollo:\nI'm so completely lost right now...Judge:\nWell, Betty and Bonny, it certainly sounds like you have some explaining to do!Betty:\nAll right, all right. I guess desperate times call for desperate measures! Kee hee hee! Just this once, we'll share how it was done with you. So listen carefully! You'll never hear this kind of thing anywhere else! After our teleportation trick, I went down understage.Bonny:\nWhen Mr. Reus's body appeared from the coffin on stage... ...it was time for Betty to do her job in the understage passage.Betty:\nThat's right. I used the remote control for the winch connected to the dragon set piece... ...and made it fall down.Bonny:\nAnd just before the dragon fell... ...I called Trucy to the backstage, so she wouldn't get hurt.Betty:\nAfter that, the plan was for Mr. Reus to come back to life in front of a panicked Trucy. He was supposed to laugh and fly up and away. That was how it was scripted, anyway. But for some reason, he really DID turn up dead, so he kinda just stayed on the ground.Apollo:\n............ (Wh-What kind of sick joke is that...?)Judge:\nIt sounds like a terribly mean-spirited prank to me. The poor defendant was trying to do her magic show!Bonny:\nI guess so... I'm sorry, Trucy.Betty:\nHmph! Whatever. It was all the Ratings Rajah's idea anyway.Athena:\nYeah... It sounds like just the kind of thing a guy like him would come up with.Bonny:\nUm... This is the prank plan script we got from the Ratings Rajah.Prank Plan Script added to the Court Record.Betty:\nDang it! You made us break our contract! Now we won't get paid!Judge:\nHmm... But where does this all leave us? Who killed the victim... and when?Nahyuta:\n...Yes, exactly. Those are the key questions. If Mr. Reus was only pretending to be dead in the coffin as a part of the prank... ...then when he was understage... ...there would still be life within him. And if that is the case... ...then Betty, who was also understage, may be excluded from our list of suspects.Apollo:\nAh... AAAAAH!Nahyuta:\nWitness, was the victim alive up until he entered the coffin?Betty:\nOh, well. Now that we've spilled the beans, we might as well show you this video.Mr. Reus:\nGreetings, viewers! It is I, The Great Mr. Reus! We are currently in the middle of Trucy's escape trick. Having snuck through the understage passage undetected, I am now hiding backstage... ...preparing to play a little prank on Trucy! I'm about to hide in the coffin, which Trucy will stab with her rubber sword. And when the coffin opens -- ho ho! I will be in it, acting as though I've met my maker! Can you imagine the look on Trucy's face then! Ho ho, I can hardly WAIT!Apollo:\nHe's \"about to\" hide in the coffin...?Nahyuta:\n...It would seem the threads of karmic destiny... ...have led us to the truth.Apollo:\n............Nahyuta:\nThe victim passed through the understage, where Betty de Famme was... ...and came up into the backstage area. We know this because Mr. Reus appeared to be backstage when he shot the video we saw.Apollo:\n...It appears that way, yes.Nahyuta:\nAnd defense, you proposed the following, did you not? \"What if the victim was killed under the stage before being put into the coffin?\" But then, what about this video? This footage was taken just before Mr. Reus entered the coffin.Apollo:\nNnngh...Judge:\nOh! So does that mean...?Nahyuta:\nYes, it is horrible, but true. The tragedy did indeed play out right there on the stage... ...when into the coffin where Mr. Reus was hiding... ...Trucy Wright thrust her blade!Apollo:\nArngh... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!Betty:\nKee hee hee! Seeee? Told you so!Judge:\nSo are you saying the incident was a tragic accident that happened during a prank?Nahyuta:\nIt would be an accident... if the accused had no knowledge of the prank beforehand. So let us ask the accused herself: Ms. Wright, did you have prior knowledge of the prank?Trucy:\nWhat?! I... I...Apollo:\nTell him, Trucy! You didn't know anything about it, right?!Trucy:\nOf course I didn't... I didn't know a single thing about it!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nStill think you can play innocent, do you? In that case... ...you leave me little choice but to present this piece of evidence.Judge:\nIt looks like... some sort of note?Betty:\nAaaaaaaaaaaagh! Th-That's...!Nahyuta:\nI found this note in the dressing room after the incident. At the time, I did not understand what it meant, but all is clear to me now.Apollo:\nWhat's this?Athena:\nLet's see. \"Get the video camera after Mr. Reus comes tumbling out.\"...?Nahyuta:\nIt is a note signed by the accused... ...instructing Bonny to collect Mr. Reus's video camera from him, it seems.Athena:\n......I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense...Betty:\nI found it in the dressing room before the show. When I saw it, I realized that Trucy knew about the prank.Apollo:\nIt does bear her signature... I'll give you that much...Trucy's Note added to the Court Record.Judge:\nSo the defendant had prior knowledge of the prank?Nahyuta:\nIt would appear so, yes. When she learned about the plan to trick her, she decided to use it to her own advantage. So she thrust the steel sword into the coffin where the victim stood chuckling to himself... Is that not what happened, Ms. Wright?Trucy:\nO-Of course not! And I didn't write or sign that note!Nahyuta:\nAh, but the handwriting matches yours. All of the evidence and testimony points to you being the culprit.Trucy:\nB-But... I didn't do it! It wasn't me!Nahyuta:\nThen explain the existence of this note! You can do that, can you not?Trucy:\nI... I can't explain it. I didn't write it, so I don't understand... I didn't kill Mr. Reus! You have to believe me!Nahyuta:\n............Judge:\n............Athena:\n........................Apollo:\n............ (The silence is deafening...)Nahyuta:\nContinue struggling against the threads of your own karma if you wish, accused.Even as you are inescapably caught in the web of fate you've spun for yourself.Nahyuta:\n......Ms. Wright. It is time to resign yourself to your fate.Trucy:\nN-No... I didn't do it... I...Gallery:Ha! I knew it!That sweet-looking girl? A murderer?She took all of us in with that act of hers!I knew she was a homicidal little witch from the start!Trucy:\nBut I didn't do it... I really didn't... Why doesn't anybody believe me?Gallery:Shut up, you killer!We won't fall for that anymore!Apollo:\nTh-This is bad...Nahyuta:\nYour Honor, I suggest we put an end to this tragedy now. Give your official ruling, and let us offer the victim's soul the last rites it deserves.Judge:\n......Very well. I suppose I have no other choice. ......This court hereby finds the defendant, Trucy Wri--Apollo:Apollo:\n............The defense has an objection!Trucy:\nApollo!Nahyuta:\n...Y-You! Even now, you would...!Apollo:\n(...I won't give up. And I refuse to let either of them down... Mr. Wright, who's counting on me... And Trucy, who's put all of her faith in me...!)Judge:\n......Mr. Justice, the fact that you have raised an objection... ...means that you have evidence with which to refute the prosecution's claims, correct?Apollo:\nY-Yes, of course, Your Honor!Athena:\nDo we really have anything, Apollo...?Apollo:\n......Actually, we do! There's one piece of evidence we can present here!Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Justice. You may proceed.Apollo:\nAs we saw in the show footage... ...there's no question that the defendant thrust a sword into the coffin. The defense doesn't dispute this point. But let us not forget that this was a magic show, filled with tricks and illusions. We can't take everything we see at face value.Judge:\nHmm... So you're saying some sleight of hand was somehow involved?Apollo:\nYes. The defense contends that the sword the defendant used was not the cause of death. (Now what was it Trucy told me she did just before she thrust the sword into the coffin?)Judge:\n......Very well. Let us see your evidence, then, Mr. Justice. But remember: you interrupted my verdict to make this claim. You will be severely penalized if I find you are bluffing.Apollo:\nNgrk...! Th-That's fine, Your Honor! This shows that it's possible that the sword Ms. Wright used was not the cause of death!Present Sword Stand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What's this? A sword from the show?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\nAnd how exactly does that prove your point?\nApollo:\n...Huh? (Uh-oh. Looks like I got it wrong.) As I said earlier, Your Honor, you can't take everything at face value. All I was trying to say with this is... that it's not the evidence we are looking for.\nJudge:\nAnd just as I said earlier, Mr. Justice, I have a whopper of a penalty for that bluff.\nApollo:\nOwie... (I guess I can't always have it my way... There's only one piece of evidence that makes sense here... Now, what was it that Trucy said she did... ...just before she thrust the sword into the coffin?)\nJudge:\nSee to it you do better this time, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\n...Yes, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"This shows that it's possible that the sword Ms. Wright used was not the cause of death!\"Judge:\nWhat's this? A sword from the show?Apollo:\nThat's right, Your Honor. This rubber sword was in the sword stand understage. Ms. Wright was supposed to swap the real sword for a rubber sword. And she told us on record that she remembers very clearly that she did.Judge:\nI see. So the sword the defendant thrust into the coffin was a rubber sword, was it? But then why was a steel sword found lying on the stage?Apollo:\n...Somebody must have put the steel sword there by swapping it with the rubber one. Just after the incident occurred, the dragon set piece fell, and the theater was evacuated. The real culprit must have used the resulting chaos... ...to swap the rubber sword for the steel one!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nDo you not know when to give up, stink bug?! That is NOT possible! Blood was found in the coffin hole that the sword was thrust into! It must have been left there when the accused withdrew the sword. This is incontrovertible proof that the sword she used was the steel one!Apollo:Apollo:\nBut that blood could be the result of someone tampering with the crime scene after the fact. After the set piece fell and the audience was cleared out of the theater... ...there was plenty of time for somebody to plant that blood there!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\n............If the sword the accused used was a rubber one... ...then when exactly do you propose the victim was killed... ...given that Mr. Reus was alive when he entered that coffin!Apollo:Apollo:\nFinding the answer to that question... is precisely why we need to continue this trial!Judge:\nLet me express my opinion. By all accounts, it is certainly reasonable to suspect the defendant based on the evidence. But as to the question of whether the sword the defendant used was rubber or steel... ...I believe further discussion is warranted. I suggest we hear from the defendant herself on this issue.Nahyuta:\n......Very well, Your Honor.Apollo:\n(Yes! I saved it... somehow! Too close for comfort, but still...)Crime Photo updated in the Court Record.Judge:\nLet's adjourn for a brief fifteen-minute recess. I advise the prosecution and the defense to use this time to prepare.April 28District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3Athena:\nWhew... That was hairy!Apollo:\nTell me about it. We barely made it through by the skin of my teeth.Trucy:\nI can't say I'm crazy about that Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, either... You know, with the way he says \"let it go, and move on\" as if it's nothing.Apollo:\n(\"Let it go, and move on,\" huh...)???:\nWhoa boy, am I interrupting a secret conclave of villains or something?Retinz:\nGot your next evil scheme in the works already?Apollo:\n...What do you want?Retinz:\nHeh heh. Keep making that face, champ, and everybody's gonna change the channel. Look this way, Trucy! Now, smile for the camera! Let's see those pearly whites! Isn't that what the Gramarye creed tells you to do?Trucy:\n............Retinz:\nHow does it feel, Trucy? Everybody online can't stop talking about you! They're calling you a real witch out there! Could this be the end of Troupe Gramarye?Athena:\nGO AWAY, YOU CREEP!Retinz:\nOh, what's this? Something just charged into frame! It looks like a yellow gorilla or something. Could it be Trucy's pet?Athena:\nFilming is prohibited inside the courthouse! Do you want me to get the bailiff?!Retinz:\nHuh? Filming? What are you talking about? I don't even have a camera on me.Athena:\nHuh? What happened to the camera...?Apollo:\n(It just disappeared, right before our very eyes...)Retinz:\nHeh heh. I'll be enjoying the rest of The Trucy Show from the gallery. I put out a call for Trucy's fans to come and support her earlier, by the way. Bet I'll get some great footage outta them! This is gonna be good! Hang loose, baby!Apollo:\nHe called in some of Trucy's fans? (But for what purpose...?)Trucy:\n...Apollo? That thing Mr. Retinz just did... that was some high-level sleight of hand.Apollo:\nHuh? Why would he know how to do something like that?Trucy:\nI don't know, but he definitely has some serious magic skills.Apollo:\n(No way. But I thought he said magicians were all \"a bunch of good-for-nothings\"!)???:\nMr. Lawyer?Apollo:\nOh, hello, Bonny. Can I help you with something?Bonny:\nUh, well... There's something that's been bothering me...Apollo:\nReally? What is it?Bonny:\nWell, you see...Betty:\nHey, dummy!

It's just... ...I wonder what Mr. Retinz has up his sleeve. I doubt he's bringing in actual fans...Apollo:\nY-Yeah, probably not... (I wonder what he has up his sleeve, too. He'd better not be trying to get under Trucy's skin right now, of all times.)Trucy:\n............Apollo:\n............You're Trucy Wright, and you'll be FINE!Trucy:\nOh!Athena:\nThere goes Apollo with his best trick!Apollo:\nThat's right. Whenever I'm feeling down, I always tell myself I'm fine.Trucy:\n......All right. I'll give it a try! I'm Trucy Wright, and I'm FINE! ......Thanks, Polly!

I knew I shouldn't have let her go through with this...)Trucy:\n......Um... I'd like to make a small request. How about, instead of testifying with words... ...I show you exactly what happened.

I-I'm not asking out of mere curiosity, just so you know!Trucy:\nI usually hide the steel sword backstage when I switch them during the show.Judge:\nSo when you thrust the rubber sword into the coffin... ...the steel sword wasn't even onstage, but behind the curtain?Trucy:\nExactly. So, you see, there IS a trick and a gimmick to it after all. And as for where the steel sword went when I performed the trick just now... It's a secret! Wouldn't want to spoil the magic for you, now would I!Judge:\nHo ho ho!Athena:\nThat's our Trucy!Apollo:\nYeah... Still... ......Ms. Wright? That part where you spun around... ...that's an actual part of the sword-switching trick you do for the show, right?Trucy:\nRight.

I think I found an inconsistency in her testimony...)Nahyuta:\n............Hmph.Apollo:\n(And it looks like I'm not the only one...

We can see the footage for ourselves. The claims of this witness are false.Trucy:\nB-But...!Nahyuta:\nNow that it has been proven that the accused did not swap swords... ...it means that the use of the steel sword to pierce the coffin was wholly intentional.Apollo:\nGurk!Nahyuta:\nAnd by the way, was it not you, Mr. Justice, who argued... ...that Mr. Reus's death was not an accident, but murder?

She's just incredible. So I'm not going to run away! I'm scared, but, for once... ...I'm going to be brave!Betty:\nGrrr! What have you done to my sister, Trucy Wright?! You've practically brainwashed her!Athena:\nIt's the power of Trucy's conviction -- that's what it is! It's touched Bonny's heart!Apollo:\nYeah. Trucy really is one magical girl. Bonny, is the topic of your testimony related to that thing that was bothering you? The thing you tried to tell us about in the lobby during the recess?Bonny:\nYes. Ever since I saw the show footage, something's been nagging at me. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but something is off. I feel like something about it is different from what I saw on the stage.Judge:\nWhat do you mean by that, Bonny?Bonny:\nI wonder if what was shown on TV is really the same as what happened onstage.Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nOf course it is. The show has only been performed once, after all. It can't show anything other than what happened on that stage yesterday.Apollo:Apollo:\nBut Bonny's testimony deserves our attention! We have to examine the show footage!Judge:\nHmm... But what can we check it against? Do you have some other footage of the show?Apollo:\nW-Well...Bonny:\nI have some show footage.Apollo:\nYou do?Bonny:\nOne of the TV station's cameramen said he was a fan of mine. He kept his camera on me throughout the entire show. And then, afterwards... he gave me the footage he shot as a present.Apollo:\nH-He did...?Bonny:\nTo tell you the truth, I thought it was kind of creepy, so I was going to get rid of it...Apollo:Apollo:\nP-Please submit that footage to the court!Judge:\nNow, then. Let's take a look at this new footage.Apollo:\nW-Wow... Okay, then...Judge:\nHe really did keep his camera on Bonny the whole time, didn't he!Athena:\nI think this cameraman needs to keep his personal feelings out of his work.Nahyuta:\nWell, defense? Do you still believe this new show footage is worth inspecting?Apollo:\nO-Of course I do...!Athena:\nOkay, so how are we going to go about this?Apollo:\nLet's try comparing the two. We just might find an inconsistency between them.Athena:\nAn inconsistency, huh?Apollo:\nYes. The two pieces of footage are of the same scene, so they should match up. But Bonny felt there was something off about the original footage. So if we can pick out what's different between the two...Athena:\n...We'll know what Bonny found strange.Apollo:\nExactly. Plus, we may figure out why the original doesn't show the sword-switching trick. Your Honor, the defense would like to compare these two pieces of show footage!Judge:\nVery well. I will allow it.Nahyuta:\nWhat a waste of time...Athena:\nApollo, do you know how to compare the two pieces of footage?Apollo:\nNo, I've never done it before...Athena:\nI'll give you a little lesson, then! Use the video player's buttons to go through the footage. (Changed from [Use the buttons on the bottom screen to operate the playback.] in the original release) When you want to speed through, use the \"Fast Forward\" button ([A / M]). (Changed from [When you want to speed through, touch the 'Fast Forward' button (A).] in the original release) And if you want to go back, use the \"Rewind\" button ([Y / B]). (Changed from [And if you want to go back, touch the 'Rewind' button (Y).] in the original release) If you want to halt the playback, just use the \"Pause\" button ([B / Z]). (Changed from [If you want to halt the playback, you can touch the 'Pause' button (B).] in the original release) Oh, and, by the way, if you fast-forward or rewind when the playback is paused... ...you can do a slow, frame-by-frame playback.Apollo:\nOkay. And so how do I switch between the two videos?Athena:\nJust use the \"Switch Camera\" button ([L / LB / Q]). (Changed from [Just touch the 'Switch Camera' button (L) at the top left.] in the original release) Now, if you find a difference between the two pieces of footage... ...put the cursor over what's different and \"Present\" ([X / Y / R]) it to the court.Apollo:\nThanks, Athena. You really know your stuff.Athena:\nNot really. I just gave it some gusto, and then went with my gut on most of it.Apollo:\nWhat?! (I-I sure hope she guessed right... Anyway, let's give it a try.)Present playing cards (Camera 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is it right here!\"Present Bonny de Famme after Trucy Wright stabs coffin (Camera 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nIt's right here! In the cameraman's video, Bonny's reaction is delayed... ...relative to when Ms. Wright thrust her sword into the coffin.\nJudge:\nOh, my! You're right.\nNahyuta:\n\nNahyuta:\nCould that not simply be because Bonny was not paying attention? Besides, her reaction is not shown in the video that was shot from the front. You can hardly call it a proper discrepancy if you cannot even compare the two shots.\nApollo:\nUgh... I-I guess you're right... (But still... ...there's definitely something different between the two -- I can just tell. Is there something else? Something that's shown in one of the videos... ...but not in the other?)\nJudge:\nHmm... While I think that Mr. Justice's claim is not totally without merit... ...I'm afraid it's not quite strong enough to constitute proof of his claims.\nApollo:\nPlease let me try again, Your Honor.\nLeads back to footagePresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThere's a clear difference between the two pieces of footage right here!\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm afraid I don't see any difference there...\nApollo:\nBlink and you'll miss it, Your Honor. So, don't blink!\nJudge:\n......Hmm... Staring so hard at these images for such a long time... ...is starting to make my eyes feel funny. Is this what they call \"eye strain\"? But besides that, I don't sense anything else strange with this footage.\nApollo:\n(I guess it was too much to ask of His Honor's ancient eyes...) Um, would you like some reading glasses, Your Honor? S-Sorry!\nAthena:\nSo we're looking for some kind of difference or discrepancy between the two, right?\nApollo:\nThat's right. Something that's shown in one of the videos, but not in the other. If we can find something like that, it'll prove that the two videos are different. Let me try that again, Your Honor! \nLeads back to footageApollo:\nThis is it right here! Take a good look at this scene and compare it to the video shot from the front.Judge:\nOh! The playing cards don't appear in the video shot from the front!Athena:\nHey, you're right! What's going on here?Apollo:\nMs. Wright, what can you tell us about these playing cards?Trucy:\nOh! Those? They're the cards I throw when I do the sword-switching trick!Apollo:\nWHAT?!Judge:\nMr. Justice! Does this mean...?Apollo:\nYes, it means that the sword-switching trick... ...was cut from the TV show footage.Nahyuta:\nSo the footage was edited?Apollo:\nYes, with malicious intent.Nahyuta:\n...That is absurd.Judge:\nWell! We must get to the bottom of this right away! Bailiff, the TV station might still have the unedited footage. Go see what you can find out!Bailiff:\nYes, Your Honor!Retinz:Apollo:\nIt's you!Retinz:\nNow hold up, Your Honor! This is all just a big misunderstanding -- believe you me! Give a guy a chance to defend himself before you start pointing fingers!Judge:\nAnd who might you be?Retinz:\nRight, right! Sorry about that -- got ahead of myself there. Here is my business card. Chaaarmed to make your acquaintance, Your Hooonor!Judge:\nOh! Well! How very polite of you.Retinz:\nIt's looovely to meet you, too, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Please, take my caaard!Nahyuta:\nA business card...? Ah, yes. I read about this custom among businessmen in this country. I have even familiarized myself with the various replies. \"How do you do, good sir?\" or, \"What's crack-a-lackin', homie?\" for example.Judge:\nO-ho! You're from Take-2 TV, are you, witness? Come to think of it, I believe I've seen you on television before.Nahyuta:\nYes. Roger Retinz -- otherwise known as the \"Ratings Rajah.\" He is a TV producer, and appears on many of his own shows as of late. He is best known for his catchphrase, \"Hang loose, baby!\"Judge:\nOh, my! So YOU'RE the Ratings Rajah!Retinz:\nHang loose, Judgey baby! Nice courtroom you got here!Judge:\nI never thought I'd get to meet you in person! But Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, how do you know so much about him?Nahyuta:\nIn preparation for the case, I watched all of his shows. I found \"The Ratings Rajah Goes to Burger Barn\" of particular interest. It inspired me to visit that restaurant straight away to learn more about the local cuisine.Judge:\nWhat?! YOU went to Burger Barn?!Apollo:\n(Who would've thought...?)Retinz:\nYou must've really wanted to try it, huh, buddy. 'Cause that line -- whew.Nahyuta:\nCompared to my ascetic training, an hour's wait is nothing. I recommend the Southwestern burger with Jalapeno Jack cheese, by the way.Athena:\nI'm having a really hard time picturing him in line for burgers...Judge:\nAhem! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's unexpected enthusiasm for food aside... ...Mr. Retinz, what is this \"misunderstanding\" you mentioned?Retinz:\nWell, for starters, it's true that the footage was edited. You'll get your hands on this anyway, so I might as well show you the unedited footage. It's a pretty long video, o I'll just show you the part with the playing cards. You can see the cards when Trucy spins around, so keep your eyes peeled.Retinz:\nDid you see the part that was cut where Trucy switched the swords? She spins around and the playing cards go flying -- everything's like it's supposed to be.Judge:\nHmm... Then it seems the defendant really did swap swords during the trick.Apollo:\nWhich means the sword Ms. Wright thrust into the coffin was the rubber one. In other words, Ms. Wright couldn't have killed Mr. Reus!Retinz:Retinz:\nYeah, see... that's the first misunderstanding right there.Apollo:\nWhat do you mean?Retinz:\nWell, Trucy definitely did swap swords, as you saw. So, yeah, maybe she didn't kill Mr. Reus when she stabbed the coffin. But that just means he was killed AFTER he showed up pretending to be a corpse.Apollo:\nSo you're saying that up until that point, everything was going according to the script? If that's true, then when and how exactly do you think he was killed?Retinz:\nIt was after the dragon set piece came crashing down. I say Trucy murdered Mr. Reus when she was hidden from view behind the set piece. She could've easily done it behind that huge dragon, and nobody'd be the wiser.Nahyuta:\nHmm... I see. Indeed, there is a ring of truth to your assertion.Retinz:\nYou bet! Plus, there's a suspicious-looking shadow in the footage, too! It's toward the end of the footage, just before the dragon hits the stage. It might be easier to just see it for yourselves.Retinz:\nIt's only for a split second, so it's hard to catch, but... look here. This suspicious shadow must be Trucy. She's using the steel sword she hid behind the curtain during the trick to kill the victim.Judge:\nHmm... Now that you mention it, I suppose it does look that way...Apollo:Apollo:\nThis witness is just trying to ram his theory down our throats, Your Honor! And that's not all. Aren't we forgetting... ...that the witness willfully edited the sword switch out of the footage?!Retinz:Retinz:\nYou see? There's your second misunderstanding right there. Your Honor, would you mind if I testified about it? I've seen people testify on TV, and I've always wanted to give it a shot.Judge:\nThat would be fine with me. Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta:\n...This is quite unexpected. It threatens to disrupt the karmic course of this case.Retinz:\nHey, lighten up, pretty boy! You're gonna LIKE what I've got to say! Promise!Nahyuta:\n............Very well. However... ...if you do anything to impede the last rites for the victim... I will have you removed.Judge:\nAll right. With Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's permission... ...please give us your testimony, Mr. Retinz.Retinz:\nRoger Retinz, the Ratings Rajah! Now, Kaiser of the Courtroom! I'm taking over the floor, so listen up, loyal viewers!Witness Testimony-- It Wasn't Deliberate, I Tell You --Retinz:\nFootage is meant to be edited, I tell you!\nScenes are spliced together, and long or boring scenes are cut out.\nAll the stations edit footage this way! It wasn't like it was done maliciously or something.\nIt was just a coincidence that particular scene was cut. It wasn't intentional.\nOr, what? You got some proof that I had an ulterior motive for editing that footage?Judge:\nI see. So you're saying it was a coincidence that the sword swapping scene was cut.Retinz:\nThat's right! Glad you got the picture!Apollo:Apollo:\nCoincidence?! That's just a little TOO convenient, if you ask me!Retinz:\nOoh! An \"Objection!\" How cool! It sure packs a lot more punch when you hear it live! Do that again! I wanna get another shot from a different angle.Apollo:\nMy \"Objection!\" is not for your entertainment!Retinz:\nAaand cut! There! I got some good stuff there!Judge:\nMr. Retinz, filming is prohibited inside the courthouse.Retinz:\nWhoops. My bad, judge!Judge:\nAnd if the defense has an issue, it can point it out during its cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- It Wasn't Deliberate, I Tell You --Retinz:\nFootage is meant to be edited, I tell you!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nReally? I've never heard anybody say that.\nRetinz:\nIt's common knowledge in the TV world! You got any idea what a snooze cruise it'd be to watch a magic show without editing? ...A magic show like that one, anyway.\nApollo:\n(That was ice cold.)\nRetinz:\nAnyway, editing is what makes TV worth watching!Retinz:\nScenes are spliced together, and long or boring scenes are cut out.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAre you saying you thought there were boring scenes in Ms. Wright's magic show?\nRetinz:\nYou gotta ask? That script and presentation deserve a place on the cutting room floor. Broadcasting that mess as-is would've been a complete disaster. That's why I had to edit the footage. It's just what a TV man does!\nApollo:\nWhat didn't you like about the show, exactly?\nRetinz:\nThe whole thing -- it was a major snoozefest. Maybe common folk like you don't get it... ...but a show's only as good as how loud, flashy, and trashy it is.\nApollo:\n(It was plenty loud and flashy on its own. All you did was add the trash.)\nNahyuta:\nI suppose each industry has its own way of doing things. Just as we in the legal profession focus exclusively on evidence and testimony...\nRetinz:\nExactly. Whether it's show biz or the legal biz, we do what we gotta do to get the job done. Anyway, editing footage is just a matter of course in the TV industry.Retinz:\nAll the stations edit footage this way! It wasn't like it was done maliciously or something.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nIt wasn't done maliciously, huh? But I get the distinct impression... ...that you bear feelings of ill will toward Troupe Gramarye.\nRetinz:\n...Huh? What makes you think that?\nApollo:\nThe things that you yourself have said.\n\n\nYou'll see! I'll dig up the dirt and expose the dark heart behind that sweet smile. I'll prove those Gramarye magicians are all a bunch of low-lifes.\n\n\nApollo:\nAnd I also get the impression that you've felt this way for a long time.\nNahyuta:\n\nNahyuta:\nWords such as those can be interpreted in many different ways. For example, though I bear the defense no ill will... ..I would not hesitate to say that he is a good-for-nothing lout of a lawyer.\nApollo:\nYou bear me no ill will...? Could've fooled me.\nNahyuta:\nAnd yet, it is the truth. I am only strict on you as it seems you have strayed from the path.\nJudge:\nIf you have any objections, Mr. Justice, please make your case with evidence in the future. Mr. Retinz, please continue your testimony.Retinz:\nIt was just a coincidence that particular scene was cut. It wasn't intentional.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nOf all the scenes you could have cut, why the sword-switching trick? That seems like TOO much of a coincidence to me.\nRetinz:\nOh, so now you're gonna tell me how I'm supposed to edit my programs, big shot? It's hard being the boss, kid. You gotta make the tough choices, like which content gets cut!\nApollo:\nThen let me ask you this: Why exactly did you make such a \"tough choice\" in this case?\nRetinz:\nYou wouldn't understand, champ. It's all about artistic vision. I tell ya -- people tell you how to do your job when they don't know the first thing about it!\nApollo:\n(I may not know TV, but I know evidence law. And boy do I have some for you, \"champ.\") I might not be able to show that your \"selective editing\" was intentional. However, I know you bear the defendant ill will. And this is the evidence that proves it!\n\n\n\nPresent Clipboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nRetinz:\nHuh? What's that you got there?\nApollo:\nThis is the contract you had Ms. Wright sign just before the magic show. This contract between the first party, Take-2 TV, and the second party, Ms. Wright, reads: \"If, through the fault of the second party, the show must be canceled in part or in full... ...the second party will pay three million dollars as compensation to the first party.\"\nJudge:\nTh-Three million dollars?! That's a completely unreasonable sum.\nApollo:\nI couldn't agree more. And of course Ms. Wright doesn't have that kind of money. Nevertheless, Roger Retinz had her sign this unreasonable contract anyway. Or, more accurately, he conned her into signing it.\nJudge:\nConned her? How did he do that?\nApollo:\nThere's a trick to the clipboard that was used by Ms. Wright to sign her contract. It houses carbon paper that can secretly copy her signature onto other documents.\nRetinz:\nOh, c'mon, now! That's quite a nasty accusation you're slinging my way. For starters, you don't have any proof I had anything to do with that carbon paper stuff. Just because Trucy and her agency can't pay up, that doesn't mean I conned her!\nJudge:\nHmm... But three million dollars... That's totally out of reach for the average person. In any case, this is important new information. Please add it to your testimony, Mr. Retinz.\nAdds statement \"Where's your proof linking me to that tricked-out clipboard? You don't have any, do you?\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThis piece of evidence proves that you bear ill will toward the defendant.\nRetinz:\nHmph. That thing? What could THAT possibly prove?\nApollo:\nBut take a good look right here. Wouldn't you agree that it puts you in a bad light?\nRetinz:\nBut looking bad and having evil intentions are two entirely different things! Look at me, for example. I'm not evil, but I AM a bit of a bad boy.\nJudge:\nOh, if I could be a bad boy myself...! But bad lawyers get penalties for presenting bad evidence.\nApollo:\nNgh. (Yeah. That was my bad...)\nRetinz:\nLook, I didn't mean anything by it. It was just a coincidence I edited out that scene.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThen how do you explain the carbon paper in the clipboard?\nRetinz:\nMy assistant must've picked that paper up in the dressing room thinking it was some prop. He's a new guy, you see, and he's pretty incompetent. He's always making mistakes. I'll make sure to give him a good talking to later.\nApollo:\n(Poor new guy...)\nNahyuta:\nPlease continue with your testimony, Mr. Retinz.\nRetinz:\nSure, but I don't like the way the defense is trying to paint me as the bad guy here.Retinz:\nWhere's your proof linking me to that tricked-out clipboard? You don't have any, do you?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThis clipboard is yours, though, isn't it, Mr. Retinz?\nRetinz:\nWell, it belongs to the TV station, anyway. That much I know. Maybe it was an old prop from one of our TV shows that got used by mistake.\nApollo:\nOr maybe you used it on purpose... to con Ms. Wright.\nNahyuta:\n\nNahyuta:\nMr. Retinz has already stated that he did not. Mr. Justice, please do not use this trial to try to get out of paying your agency's debt.\nApollo:\nTh-That's not what I'm doing!\nAthena:\nHmm... Proof Mr. Retinz is connected to the carbon paper, huh? If Trucy's signature was copied onto the fake contract... ...then there must be an original contract that Trucy actually did sign...\nApollo:\nTrue, but I bet Retinz is too savvy to leave something like that behind as evidence. But what if her signature was copied onto more than just the fake contract?\nAthena:\nLike a third document with Trucy's signature on it? Have we seen anything like that, though...? \nRetinz:\nHey, what are you guys whispering about? Lemme continue my testimony!Present Trucy's Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You must be quite the con man if you can fool a magician with a simple trick.\"Retinz:\nOr, what? You got some proof that I had an ulterior motive for editing that footage?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWhat other scenes did you cut from the footage?\nRetinz:\n...Huh? Oh, no others, I guess.\nApollo:\nYou mean you only edited out the sword-switching trick scene and nothing else? Don't you think it's too much of a stretch to claim that as mere coincidence?!\nNahyuta:\n\nNahyuta:\nNo matter how artificial you find the affair, stranger things have happened on their own. That is, unless you have something with which to prove otherwise, defense?\nApollo:\nWell, uh...\nNahyuta:\nIf you have a valid criticism of Mr. Retinz's testimony, feel free to counter with evidence.\nAthena:\nWell, Apollo? Hmm... It would sure make things easier if we had some.\nRetinz:\nI think the defense team needs to be edited out of this trial -- that's what they need! I'll have to clean up this footage later...\nApollo:\n(He isn't really gonna put this on TV, is he?!)Before adding statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nTrying to prove malicious intent is tough. All he has to do is say it was all a coincidence.\nAthena:\nWe'll need to find some kind of foothold if we want to make any progress.\nApollo:\nTrue.

So we'll just have to get the information out of him bit by bit.After adding statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nProof that Trucy's signature was copied, huh?\nAthena:\nBut we don't have proof.

So the show footage was definitely edited with malicious intentions. Isn't that right?Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nWhat a forced argument, defense. All you have really proven is not his ill will toward Ms. Wright, but his pecuniary greed.Retinz:\nThat's right. I just wanted money, baby! Fat stacks of cheddar, that's all. After all, I'd never even crossed paths with Trucy before this magic show. So I'd have absolutely no reason to bear her any ill will, right?Apollo:\n............ (He didn't bear her any ill will, huh? Hmph. Fat chance. This guy definitely has some major hate for Trucy...)Retinz:\nYou'll see! I'll dig up the dirt and expose the dark heart behind that sweet smile. I'll prove those Gramarye magicians are all a bunch of low-lifes.Apollo:\n(I can't prove it with anything, but the things he's said all point to that fact. There must be something between the two of them that gave birth to this grudge. Some sort of connection that not even Trucy is aware of...) ......Your Honor. I'd like to argue that Roger Retinz and Trucy Wright must have crossed paths before. There must be some hidden connection between them!Judge:\nHidden...?Athena:\n...Connection?Nahyuta:\n*sigh* What is it now?Judge:\nJust what are you getting at, Mr. Justice?Nahyuta:\nIt is futile to even ask, Your Honor. Surely, it is just another one of the defense's feckless claims.Apollo:Apollo:\nYou don't seem to have a very high opinion of me, but once you hear my argument... ...you'll wish you'd taken me a whole lot more seriously.Nahyuta:\nWill I really? Very well, then. Do proceed.Athena:\nDid you figure something out, Apollo?Apollo:\n......Nope, not a thing.Athena:\nWhat?Apollo:\nThat was just some good old-fashioned bluffing, courtesy of Mr. Wright's fine training.Athena:\nI hope you know what you're doing...Judge:\nIf you're going to make such a bold claim, Mr. Justice, I hope you're ready to elaborate. What is this \"hidden connection\" between the defendant and Roger Retinz?He's Trucy's biggest fan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nRoger Retinz is Ms. Wright's biggest fan.\nRetinz:\nThaaat's right! Huge fan! Huuuge fan of hers! So, naaaturally, I don't bear her any ill will or malice whaaatsoever!\nApollo:\n............ (All right, I set myself up for that one.) Um, can we edit that scene out?\nJudge:\nNo. This isn't The Public's Court, and I'm not Judge Wackner!\nApollo:\nNgh... (I know, 'cause his penalties would hurt less.)\nJudge:\nNow, why don't you try again, Mr. Justice?\nLeads back to:\n\"What is this \"hidden connection\" between the defendant and Roger Retinz?\"They're dating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nI don't even like to imagine this, but could it be possible the two of them are dating?\nApollo:\nIf Mr. Retinz and Ms. Wright were in a relationship...\nRetinz:\nOh, that's good! Viewers love a secret romance to dish about! Yes, Trucy and I looove each other sooo much! She's gonna introduce me to her father sometime reeeal soon!\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nTrucy would never fall for a guy like you! Not in a million years!\nJudge:\nMr. Justice! Are you aware that you're objecting to your own argument?!\nApollo:\nI'm sorry, Your Honor, but when I saw Mr. Retinz's antics, I just had to speak out!\nJudge:\nHmm... I can't say that I blame you for wanting to do that... ...but you're the one who came up with such a disturbing idea in the first place.\nApollo:\n(What was I even thinking?! All that ended up doing is grossing everyone out...)\nJudge:\nNow, why don't you try again, Mr. Justice?\nLeads back to:\n\"What is this \"hidden connection\" between the defendant and Roger Retinz?\"Retinz is a magician, too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"That sleight-of-hand trick Mr. Retinz did during the recess earlier...\"Apollo:\n(That sleight-of-hand trick Mr. Retinz did during the recess earlier...)Athena:\nFilming is prohibited inside the courthouse! Do you want me to get the bailiff?!Retinz:\nHuh? Filming? What are you talking about? I don't even have a camera on me.Apollo:\nWhat if... Mr. Retinz is a magician, too?Judge:\n\"What if\"...? I believe it's up to the defense to fill in the blanks, not me.Apollo:\nWell, if he is, he may have had some contact with Ms. Wright somewhere along the way.Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\n............*sigh* Your argument is hardly worth responding to. But, by all means, please do continue. As a passage in the sacred scriptures of Khura'inism states: \"He who gives a sermon to a monkey is himself a monkey.\"Retinz:\nYeah, it doesn't matter what you say to a dimwit. He isn't gonna get it anyway.Apollo:\nBut we saw Mr. Retinz perform a magic trick! He made his video camera disappear in the blink of an eye!Retinz:\nWhile I think it would be pretty funny if I were a magician... ...you must've been seeing things. Want me to introduce you to a good eye doctor?Nahyuta:\nIf a connection as tenuous as that is all it takes... ...then every magician in the country could potentially bear ill will toward the accused.Apollo:\nI... I guess you're right...Retinz:\nYou're not the sharpest knife in the drawer, are you, short stuff?Nahyuta:\nYou would do well to cleanse that putrid mind of yours in the holy waters of Mt. Poniponi. Three days under a frigid waterfall, and even you should rise to the level of a monkey.Retinz:\nHa ha ha! A numb skull for a numbskull!Apollo:\nUrrrgh... (Well, this numbskull has thick skin, so there.)Athena:\nI think I get what they're driving at... Even if he is a magician, it's not exactly a reason to bear a grudge against Trucy, is it?Apollo:\n............Hold on! I can think of one person... ...one magician who has a reason to bear a grudge against Trucy. Or, rather, one magician who has a reason to bear a grudge against Troupe Gramarye...Athena:\nOh?Apollo:\n............! N-N-N... ...NO WAY!Judge:\nIs something wrong, Mr. Justice?Apollo:\n......Your Honor, the defense wishes to submit evidence at this time.Judge:\nI see. And what sort of evidence do you have for us?Apollo:\nEvidence that points to the real killer -- the one who had a motive to commit this crime.Judge:\nWhat?!Nahyuta:\n...*sigh* And what have you come up with this time, defense?Apollo:\nTrucy Wright is the sole heir to Troupe Gramarye and its name. This puts her square in the crosshairs of one particular magician. And this piece of evidence points to that one person with a grudge against Ms. Wright.Present Thirteen-Year-Old Poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"And who exactly are you naming, Mr. Justice?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\nThat points to the person who has a grudge against Ms. Wright, does it, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\nThat it does, and it does it surprisingly well.\nJudge:\nOh...? How?\nApollo:\nUm, well... you'll find that out after this short intermission. See you in Act Two! ...is how it goes, right?\nJudge:\n......Keep this up, and it's curtains for you, Mr. Justice!\nApollo:\nAll right... Guess I WON'T be seeing you in Act Two then...\nAthena:\nBut you're right, Apollo. There IS someone with a grudge against Troupe Gramarye.\nApollo:\nYeah... Your Honor. Please recall that... ...Trucy Wright is the sole heir to Troupe Gramarye and its name. This puts her square in the crosshairs of one particular magician.\nLeads back to:\n\"And this piece of evidence points to that one person with a grudge against Ms. Wright.\"Judge:\nAnd who exactly are you naming, Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nThirteen years ago, The Great Mr. Reus belonged to Troupe Gramarye. But then, the troupe ousted him, and Mr. Reus vowed to get revenge on them someday. And what better way to accomplish that than through the ruination of their sole heir?Judge:\nBut Mr. Reus is the victim, Mr. Justice! You've named a dead man as your suspect!Apollo:\n...But is he really dead?Judge:\n......What do you mean, \"is he really dead\"?Apollo:\nIf the fact that Mr. Reus is the victim is what's throwing you off... ...then how about we consider this possibility? What if the man who died on that stage yesterday... WASN'T Mr. Reus!Athena:\nWh-What...? You mean the victim was an imposter?Retinz:\n............Judge:\nNot Mr. Reus?! Then what about the real Mr. Reus...?Apollo:\nIt would mean the real Mr. Reus is still alive.Nahyuta:\n...That's absurd.Judge:\nMr. Justice! Who is the real Mr. Reus, if not the victim of this case?Apollo:\n(......It's all coming together now... I finally see the gimmick -- the trick to this entire case!) ...This should explain everything, Your Honor. The real killer -- the one who hated Troupe Gramarye and wanted to sully its name... The magician lurking in the shadows who set up a fake Mr. Reus in his stead... The real Mr. Reus is...!Present Roger Retinz profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"B-But that's...!\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nNahyuta:\n............\nApollo:\nYou look like you don't get it, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi.\nNahyuta:\nIt looks to me as if YOU are the one who does not \"get it\"...\nApollo:\nWow, you saw right through that one. You Khura'inist monks sure are perceptive!\nNahyuta:\nYour Honor, do I have your permission... ...to hasten this foolish lawyer's descent into hell?\nJudge:\nI wish I could say yes, but... I hope this will do instead.\nApollo:\nNrgh... (Okay, if that person wasn't it, then...)\nLeads back to:\n\"The real Mr. Reus is...!\"Judge:\nB-But that's...!Apollo:\nYes, yes it is. Roger Retinz... is the real Mr. Reus!Judge:\nWH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Athena:\nHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIM?!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:\nO hollow red pepper. Your impotent seeds sprout naught but meaningless, empty words. You can't possibly have proof to support such an outlandish theory.Retinz:\nIt's not a bad idea for a soap opera... ...but not even die-hard fans of the genre would stick around past the pilot.Apollo:\n............You want proof? Well, I've got proof. I can prove it by... ...proving that the Mr. Reus in yesterday's magic show was a fake. And to do that... ...I just need you to look at this spot on this poster.Present Mr. Reus's right arm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is the injury Mr. Reus sustained while practicing a magic trick thirteen years ago.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nRetinz:\n............You know what? I'm gonna create a TV show just for you. You'll be a star!\nApollo:\nMe? Really?\nRetinz:\nYup. \"Misguided Guys.\" We'll gather up a bunch of big ol' dumb-dumbs who like to spew idiotic nonsense... ...and then let you all jabber on like gibbons for hours about the future of the Union!\nApollo:\n(I doubt this is how the Founding Fathers expected the country to end...)\nJudge:\nYou may be misguided, Mr. Justice, but there is nothing misguided about this penalty.\nApollo:\nGaaaaagh!\nAthena:\nYou said it yourself earlier, but... ...all we have to do is prove that this fake Mr. Reus... ...and the real Mr. Reus here are two different people, right?\nApollo:\nRight... And I see one very obvious difference between the two men. I can prove that the Mr. Reus in yesterday's magic show was a fake, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"And to do that...\"Apollo:\nThis is the injury Mr. Reus sustained while practicing a magic trick thirteen years ago. However... ...the video the victim shot of himself shows no trace of that injury.Judge:\nOh, my! You're absolutely right!Apollo:\nNow, Mr. Retinz, what do you suppose we'd find if we took a look at YOUR right forearm? Is there by chance, a nasty, thirteen-year-old scar under that sleeve of yours?Retinz:\n............Apollo:\nWell, Mr. Retinz?! Why don't you roll up your sleeve and let the court have a look?! Or are you hiding something else up there!Retinz:\n............ Ha ha ha ha. Come on, now! I have nothing up my sleeve. I don't NEED to hide anything up there... because I require no tricks or gimmicks. For you see... my magic is the real deal. Is THIS what you were hoping to see?Athena:\nOH! There it is! The scar!Apollo:\nJust as I thought!Retinz:\nThat's right! I am the forgotten magician -- abandoned to the dark understage of history. The Great Mr. Reus!Judge:\nTh-Th-This...Athena:\n...Is totally...Nahyuta:\n...Absurd!Retinz:\nHo ho ho. How ironic, wouldn't you say? That this odious mark, carved into me by Troupe Gramarye... ...would bring me back into the limelight once more.Nahyuta:\nStrange are the karmic threads before me... If the witness is the real Mr. Reus, then who is the victim who perished in the magic show?Retinz:\nHe was but a fan. I met him on one of my programs several years ago. He said he had become a magician out of admiration for The Great Mr. Reus. In confidence, I told him my true identity, and let him take on my mantle.Judge:\nAnd when did this man take over for you?Retinz:\nAbout two years ago. I taught him my tricks, and even acted as his producer. And so, a mere amateur became a popular magician overnight... ...courtesy of my magic, on the stage we call television. Hope you enjoyed the show!Judge:\nYou really had us all fooled.Apollo:\nMr. Retinz... or, should I say, Mr. Reus! In your hatred of Troupe Gramarye, you killed the victim, Mr. Mistree... ...and then set up Ms. Wright to take the fall, didn't you? You did it all just to tarnish the Gramarye name!Retinz:\nHo ho ho. I have no idea what you're talking about, lad. I set up the prank, that much is true. But it was simply a harmless joke on Trucy, I assure you. Yet, she learned of the plan, and made use of it to commit murder. That is how strongly the criminal element runs in the blood of these Gramaryes!Apollo:Apollo:\nBut if it was a secret prank plan that very few people knew about... ...couldn't YOU have been the one to use it for murder instead?!Retinz:\nGaaagh!Apollo:\nYikes!Judge:\nEeeeeek!Athena:\nH-His head...!Retinz:\nHeh. Just kidding.Apollo:\nWh-What the heck was that?Retinz:\nHeed my words, lawyer lad, for I fear your grasp on reality is slipping. I do believe I told you that my magic is real! It employs neither tricks nor gimmicks.Apollo:\nEnough with the ambiguity. Why don't you make your point already?Retinz:\nMy alibi is as pristine as ever. Wouldn't you agree, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta:\n......Yes, I suppose that is correct. The witness does have a solid alibi.Apollo:\nWhat?Nahyuta:\nRecall, defense, that at the time of the magic show, Mr. Retinz was at Take-2 TV. A fact that many people can easily attest to.Apollo:\nGah! (That's right... I forgot all about that!)Retinz:\nHo ho ho. So what do you think, Your Honor? Would you like me to testify on the matter?Judge:\nYes, I think you'd better. Please tell the court more about your alibi.Retinz:\nVery well, then -- on with the show! Are you watching, Magnifi Gramarye?! The time has finally come for my magic to snuff out your precious pedigree! The Gramarye line will be no more!Witness Testimony-- My Perfect Alibi --Retinz:\nI was at the TV station at the time of the Penrose performance.\nI was busy working on another TV program. I could spare no time for the magic show.\nDo ask my staff if you doubt my claim.\nAnd there it is: a simple and perfect alibi. No tricks. No gimmicks. Just the truth!Retinz:\nDo you understand now, perhaps? I did not grace the theater with my presence until after the incident. So how could I have committed the murder?Apollo:\n(Hmm... His staff did say he was there at the station... ...so it sure does sound like a rock-solid alibi...)Athena:\nBut that can't be right. If Mr. Retinz is the killer, he'd had to have been at the theater.Apollo:\nThere's gotta be a hole somewhere in his story...Retinz:\nHeh heh heh. I assure you there are no holes on Mr. Reus's stage. No tricks, no gimmicks. True magic doesn't need trapdoors to escape through! Do enjoy my show to the fullest... ...and my real alibi!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- My Perfect Alibi --Retinz:\nI was at the TV station at the time of the Penrose performance.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nBut you did come to the theater eventually, isn't that right?\nRetinz:\nIndeed. Anxious to see how the show was progressing, I made my way to the theater. Let's see... My journey took about ten minutes by car.\nApollo:\n(Could he actually have been at the theater during those ten minutes, killing the victim?)\nRetinz:\nHo ho ho. Allow me a stab at reading your mind. ......A-ha. Could I have been at the theater during those ten minutes, killing the victim?\nApollo:\nHow in the--!\nRetinz:\nBut no, I took a taxi. The driver can attest to that. Feel free to call the taxi company, if my word does not satisfy you. The driver is a big fan of the Ratings Rajah. I even gave him my card.\nApollo:\n(He gave the driver his card? That was very clever of him...)\nRetinz:\nYou might as well give it up, lad. Questioning real magic is a fool's errand. Besides, you know very well what I was doing at the time of the incident.Retinz:\nI was busy working on another TV program. I could spare no time for the magic show.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWhat was this other TV show you were working on?\nRetinz:\nMy own special project, you see. I... Ah, one moment. Perhaps this is more appropriate... It's a Ratings Rajah special production! Yeah! Hang loose, baby! It's called \"Desperation Regeneration!\"\nApollo:\n(He switched personas just to say that?) What's the show about?\nRetinz:\nWashed-up, has-been singers and comedians get together and play musical chairs. The winner of the game is given a second chance at their career. A priceless prize for chumps who washed up too early in life. Sounds great, right?\nNahyuta:\nMight I suggest you appear on that show, Mr. Justice? As the ex-lawyer who used to make ridiculous bluffs in court, and faded sadly into obscurity.\nApollo:\n(And let the Ratings Rajah produce my TV debut...? Not in this lifetime.)\nAthena:\nYou have great reactions. Who knows? TV might be your true calling.\nApollo:\nHey! Whose side are you on?!\nRetinz:\nIn any case, I was overseeing production of this program during the Penrose performance.Retinz:\nDo ask my staff if you doubt my claim.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nHow do we know those staff members aren't in cahoots with you?\nRetinz:\nI make it my business to perform solo. My magic has neither need nor want of assistants. After all, one of them could reveal the secrets behind my magic, could they not?\nApollo:\n(So he doesn't trust anybody, huh? He's the complete opposite of Trucy.)\nNahyuta:\nThere were many people there in the studio audience who saw the witness as well. Even if he had been able to persuade his own staff to cover for him... ...he could not have convinced so many complete strangers to do the same.\nAthena:\nHe really has made a rock-solid alibi for himself.\nApollo:\nYeah. It's almost... too good, you know? (It's eerie how perfect it is...)\nRetinz:\nHas all been revealed to you now?Retinz:\nAnd there it is: a simple and perfect alibi. No tricks. No gimmicks. Just the truth!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nI-I've got it! Do you have a brother? A brother that looks exactly like you, maybe?\nRetinz:\nAgain with the twins business?! You think the audience will let you get away with using the same gimmick twice in a row?\nNahyuta:\nIf you do not believe him, defense, why not investigate for yourself? Though I am sure your efforts will prove to be thoroughly fruitless.\nApollo:\n(Yeah, I guess the twins theory is a little far-fetched...)Athena:\nThe perfect alibi, huh? It's no good, Apollo. I can't find a hole anywhere...Apollo:\nThere's gotta be some kind of trick to it. I just know there's a trapdoor in there somewhere!"

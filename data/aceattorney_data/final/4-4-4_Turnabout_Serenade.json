Get out your handkerchiefs for our special guest! That's right, baby! The night's just getting started!Thank you for coming to the Gavinners: \"Guilty as Charged\" Tour! This ends the first part of tonight's show. There will now be a 20-minute intermission.July 7, 8:05 PMBackstage HallwayExamine evidenceAttorney's BadgeBack sideApollo:There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it.Trucy:This is so cool! Us, at a Gavinners concert!Apollo:Huh? Did you say something? My ears are still ringing... The Gavinners: putting the \"sick\" back in \"music\".Trucy:Well, I thought Mr. Gavin was really nice! Sending us those tickets at 20% off! They're hard to get ahold of, you know.Apollo:When you invite people to a concert it's usually free.Trucy:Let's head to his dressing room, Apollo! You know, like we're a couple of VIPs. I've always dreamed of being a VIP at a Gavinners show!Apollo:Um, Trucy... You didn't know who Prosecutor Gavin was before that case. What kind of fan doesn't know the lead vocalist's name?Trucy:Oh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in...Trucy:Klavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy!Trucy:Yeah, but I'm a girl! I'm supposed to swoon over gods of rock!Apollo:God-awful, maybe.Trucy:I bought all their stuff on the way home from the trial! I got twelve Gavinners albums, and fifteen concert videos!Apollo:...That was quite a bit of impulse shopping.Trucy:I got an advance on my next 15-years-worth of allowance.Apollo:...For Mr. Wright that sounds like a real act of generosity.Apollo:(Who would have imagined me here... ...at a Gavinners concert, watching Prosecutor Gavin \"rock\". To be honest... ...he was kind of cool. And I'm kind of envious. Not that I'd ever admit that to Trucy.)July 7Gavinners's Dressing RoomKlavier:Ah, you made it.Trucy:Mr. Gavin! Thanks so much for the tickets!Apollo:...And the invoice you sent along with them.Trucy:You were incredible up on stage, Mr. Gavin!Klavier:Nothing like music to brighten the mood after a trial, ja? ...And we're almost ready for our next act. I'm looking forward to it myself.Trucy:Lamiroir's singing, right!? The \"Siren of the Ballad\"?Apollo:Oh yeah... That flyer said she flew all the way over for this show.Klavier:That's right. I happened to catch her show while overseas. Her voice... is divine. I knew I had to invite her to perform with us.???:Lamiroir says... \"You praise me too highly.\"Apollo:(Whoa! Who's this guy? He's huge!)Klavier:Ah, allow me to introduce Mr. Romein LeTouse. ...Lamiroir's manager. And her interpreter, incidentally.LeTouse:It is a great honor for us to be here. And a great honor for Lamiroir to be heard in this country.???:[Foreign text]....Apollo:(That voice... I wish I could understand it... It's beautiful.)???:[Foreign text]... [Foreign text]...Trucy:Ooooh! It's Lamiroir! I'm actually meeting Lamiroir!Apollo:(Lamiroir... Mysterious songstress... Her quiet, deep song glides through the air... Lilting above a sparse, but elegant piano accompaniment. Now this is music. She's a real artist.)Lamiroir:[Foreign text]....LeTouse:Lamiroir says... \"We have long looked forward to this joint performance.\"Klavier:Ah, Lamiroir... Your voice... ...It is art.Lamiroir:[Foreign text]....LeTouse:\"Yet without his piano to guide me... ...it is but a voice.\"???:....................Apollo:(I've seen this kid somewhere before.)Trucy:He plays piano at all of Lamiroir's concerts! He's cute! And he's a really good pianist.Apollo:Good pianists are a dying breed, I hear.LeTouse:Allow me to introduce Machi Tobaye. ...He is blind. This is why he never strays far from Lamiroir. They are always together.Machi:....................Apollo:(They're like characters from some fairy tale..)Trucy:Lamiroir's so, um, what's that word... Exotic! ...And mysterious!Apollo:She does seem quite pretty. At least, her eyes do.Klavier:Hers is a kind of \"sight-seeing musique\"...Trucy:Huh?Klavier:She travels the globe, putting the sights she sees into song. Even though her appearance and voice are exotic... ...her songs remind us of something close, and warm.Trucy:Sights into song... That's so poetic!Klavier:She was gracious enough to put music to my lyrics tonight. \"The Guitar's Serenade\". ...I hope you enjoy it.Trucy:I can't wait!Klavier:...And now it is time. For the next part, we're giving the Gavinners's hard rock a little rest. Lamiroir, the stage is yours.Lamiroir:[Foreign text]....LeTouse:The band members will not play during Lamiroir's ballad. Only Machi's tender tones, and Lamiroir's dulcet voice...Klavier:...And my guitar, of course.Trucy:Woo hoo! Nights like this make it all worthwhile, you know!Apollo:(I should have learned to play the guitar. There's not much romance in Chords of Steel.)Klavier:Shall we hit the stage, then?Trucy:Good luck, Mr. Gavin!Klavier:Take care your hearts aren't stolen away, ja?Trucy:Let's get back to the concert hall, Polly!Sugar, Sugar...O that night, in your embrace.When you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.Pleasure...But a fleeting melodyIt wraps itself around me,And now through the air I fly.Woh... Woh...Burning on in my heart. Fire.Burn my love away. All away.Like a bullet of love. Fire.Take my life away. All away.Guitar, Guitar...Up together to the sky.July 7, 9:05 PMBackstage HallwayTrucy:Wow, wasn't Lamiroir amazing? I *sniffle* I even cried a little!Apollo:I was surprised Prosecutor Gavin actually burned his guitar.Trucy:Yeah! That even surprised me, and I'm a magician! What a production!Apollo:What a destruction. (I don't think Prosecutor Gavin was expecting it either, oddly. He looked as surprised as I was.)Trucy:Is that what they call \"risking life and limb for art\"? I think he's my new hero!Apollo:I'm not sure I'd call that \"art\".Trucy:Well, what are we doing here? Let's get going to Mr. Gavin's dressing room! There's twenty minutes till the last part of the show!Apollo:How many breaks does this band need?July 7Gavinners's Dressing RoomKlavier:What the heck was that!? I was never consulted about it!Staff:S-Sorry, Mr. Gavin, sir! I've asked the man in charge...Klavier:I play new rock, not Great Balls of Fire! Speaking of fire, I have a good mind to fire whoever's responsible!Trucy:...He seems upset.Klavier:Apollo Justice! Were you the one who tried to torch me!?Apollo:Hey, I didn't do it!Trucy:So much for risking your life for art...Klavier:\"The Guitar's Serenade\" is ruined! Ruined!Trucy:Well, let's try to talk to him at least.Apollo:...I'm not sure that's the best move right now.ExamineBlack glovesApollo:Those are some pretty heavy-duty gloves. Maybe they have to carry around hot pots or something?Trucy:They are a little thick. I couldn't even stuff a pigeon in those.Apollo:...... That's exactly what I was thinking.Bowl of stewApollo:Why is that plastic bowl of stew sitting there?Trucy:Maybe they use it for interrogating bad guys... \"'Fess up to what you did, and we'll let you eat that stew!\"Apollo:That's just mean.Trucy:It gets worse! See, if the bad guy confesses, they say: \"OK, eat it... If you can! See, it's made of plastic!\" It's like, you don't know which ones are the real bad guys!Apollo:I think you need to take a deep breath, Trucy.ChainsApollo:This place is decorated like a high-school dance. Though I think our decorations were paper, not... chains.Trucy:The Gavinners are into chains. It's part of their image.Apollo:Huh, no kidding.Trucy:Ever since they used chains on the cover art for \"Gunna Lock U Up\".Apollo:They're really into the whole police thing, aren't they.Trucy:It'd be cooler if they turned that red light on.Apollo:...They don't have to turn on the red light.Cruiser GuitarTrucy:Ooh! A \"Cruiser Guitar\"! They sold those to commemorate five years of the band.Apollo:Rocking it hard... under the speed limit.Trucy:There's a \"Cruiser Bass\", and a \"Cruiser Drum Set\", and a \"Cruiser Keyboard\"... ...Even a \"Cruiser Whistle\".Apollo:...I'm not so sure about that last one.Trucy:It's for blowing the whistle on criminals!Apollo:...I don't think that requires an actual whistle, Trucy.Lipstick on mirrorApollo:Someone drew the Gavinners's mark in lipstick here.Trucy:Lipstick... I'd like to wear lipstick someday.Apollo:Oh? You don't use lipstick yet, Trucy?Trucy:Daddy won't let me. \"Not until I learn to play piano,\" he says.Apollo:You'll be waiting a long time then, I'm afraid.Police uniformApollo:A police uniform hangs on the stand here.Trucy:Ooh! I want to try it on! \"Nothing to see here, move along.\"Apollo:...It's OK, you don't have to go that far to be \"special\". I mean, you're not exactly the type who's \"just another face in the crowd\".Trucy:Really? You think so? Hmm... I guess you're right!Apollo:(...Now I feel like a meanie for making that insinuation.)PostcardsTrucy:Look! It's a postcard of Lamiroir!Apollo:What are these letters at the bottom? I've never seen these before.Trucy:It must be her native tongue, Borginian! (Changed from [It must be her native tongue, Borginese!] in the original release)Apollo:Borginian, huh...? (Changed from [Borginese, huh...?] in the original release)Postcard added to the Court Record.Postcards (subsequent times)Apollo:It's a stack of Lamiroir's postcards. They have an air of mystery to them that matches her voice.Red Badger GuitarTrucy:That guitar! That's the legendary AA-400! The \"Red Badger\".Apollo:I thought rock was supposed to be rebellious, not... civic.Trucy:Every aspiring guitarist wants one of these! They even paint their own guitars to look like it.Apollo:Ah, the fickleness of youth.Trucy:You should dye your hair \"Badger Red\", too!Apollo:I like my hair the way it is, thank you very much.Trucy:Argh, the stubbornness of age!SpeakerApollo:That speaker looks familiar.Trucy:Oh?Apollo:Yeah, like the one for the P.A. system back in school.Trucy:Oh, we have one of those in my classroom, too!Apollo:(That's right, she's still in junior high. ...I feel old.)Wall posterApollo:What's a police recruitment poster doing here? \"Rock on ...with the police.\"Trucy:Maybe they're trying to trick kids into thinking the police are some kind of band.Apollo:But that's just silly. Who'd name a band the \"police\"?MoveTrucy:Apollo! Where do you think you're going!?Apollo:Huh? Oh, I was just...Trucy:Let's talk to Mr. Gavin while we have the chance!Apollo:(OK, I suppose...)TalkThe flaming guitarTrucy:You mean, the guitar... That wasn't part of the act?Klavier:Part of the act!? Who'd burn up a guitar on purpose!?Trucy:But, it worked really well with the lyrics just then... Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away. All away.Klavier:......\u00a0! Wait, you think the audience thought it was...?Apollo:(Sounds like he got lucky.)Trucy:They probably thought it was part of the act. At least, I did.Klavier:......Apollo:(He got lucky, and he didn't realize it...)Klavier:A-Anyway, that guitar was the Ferrari of guitars! All the speed, all the sound ...and all the price. If I burned one of those at every show I'd go broke!Apollo:Unusually frugal for a rock band.Trucy:Try saying that to Mr. Gavin.Klavier:Achtung! Today's been one disaster after another... My hog won't run, my guitar case's broken...Trucy:Daddy told me there'd be days like these.Lamiroir's songTrucy:W-Wasn't Lamiroir's song incredible!? You worked on it too, right, Mr. Gavin?Klavier:Ah, yes, thanks. It was a collaboration. I wrote the lyrics, and she wrote the melody.Trucy:You know... I was surprised she could sing in English...Klavier:I'm sure she practiced a long time for this day. Ah, here.Apollo:What's this...?Klavier:A lyrics sheet. It's yours. Signed by myself and Lamiroir.Trucy:Yippee! Thanks so much!Apollo:(All I ever get to sign are client defense agreements.)Lyrics Sheet added to the Court Record.Lamiroir's song (subsequent times)Klavier:For that song, I wrote the lyrics and she wrote the melody. It was a collaboration.Trucy:That's so cool... I'd love to do a collaboration myself some day, or a song...Apollo:You can't do a collaboration alone, you know, Trucy.Trucy:I know that!Klavier:Then practice singing those lyrics. If you get good, I'll invite you into the band.Trucy:Eeeek! R-Really!? I'll sing 'em every day!Apollo:What about your magic act?Trucy:...... Maybe I can be a singing and dancing magician!Apollo:Then you'd end up only being average in both, no?Klavier:Not at all. Why, I'm a rock star and a star prosecutor.Apollo:Urk! (That's right, he is. I'd totally forgotten.)Trucy:Ooh! See, you can excel in more than one thing!Apollo:(Ugh... I'm having trouble enough with just one thing.)PresentAttorney's BadgeKlavier:...... Herr Forehead.Apollo:Y-Yeah?Klavier:Understand that I am not Prosecutor Gavin now. I am lead vocal of the Gavinners. That badge sings a different song... on a different stage.Apollo:Right... (I wish I had an alter-ego to hide behind sometimes.)PostcardApollo:What are those postcards there, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:Eh? Lamiroir's, you mean? It's part of her PR campaign. I received a stack. You can have one if you'd like.Apollo:...Ah, that's good to hear. Trucy already swiped one, is why.Trucy:Eh! B-But that... But I... ... What's the big idea!? Making me look like a criminal... It was... a collaboration! I've always wanted to do a collaboration!Klavier:Usually, a collaboration is for creating, not stealing.Apollo:...Let the kid dream.Lyrics SheetKlavier:I wrote those lyrics, you know. Though it was Lamiroir who gave them life.Trucy:Wow... That's beautiful!Apollo:(Grr. Maybe I should try to write some lyrics someday.)After clearing all Talk options:Klavier:Almost time for the third act of the night.Trucy:Oh! There's more?Klavier:Yes! Lamiroir's part is done. Now it's time for us to drop our groove again, ja? Hope you're ready to catch it.Trucy:Woo hoo! Ready, Apollo?Apollo:Uh... I think I'll pass.Trucy:Eh.Apollo:I liked the bit with Lamiroir. But the rest could use a volume knob. Turned way down.Trucy:Ah, Apollo, you're getting old!Apollo:Ack! (Does 22 quality as \"old\" to a 15-year-old...?)Trucy:Well, I'm going!Klavier:Let the old folks rest backstage, ja? ...Time to rock.Apollo:(Hey, you're older than I am!)ExamineBlack glovesApollo:Thick leather gloves and sunglasses... Maybe I'll try these on... ...On second thought, no. They might be evidence for one of Prosecutor Gavin's cases.Bowl of stewApollo:A delicious bowl of stew! ...Made of plastic. Huh, the bottom of the bowl has a \"G\" on it. They sell these at concerts? Whatever happened to T-shirts?ChainsApollo:Chains dangle from the ceiling. They aren't \"glimmerous\", but I bet Detective Skye'd have something to say about them.Cruiser GuitarApollo:That guitar looks like it was made out of a cop car door. ...... That's right. Trucy's not here to set me straight. Now I feel kinda lonely.Lipstick on mirrorApollo:There's graffiti on the mirror... in lipstick. Wait, but the Gavinners are all guys. ...Maybe Prosecutor Gavin wears lipstick?Police uniformApollo:A police uniform. Next to it is a policeman's hat, and a pair of handcuffs. One of the band members must like the police. Must be Mr. Gavin's \"bad influence\". ...... I thought rock 'n' roll was all about being rebellious.PostcardsApollo:A postcard of Lamiroir... I can't read a single word of the sentence at the bottom. Hmm. Trucy might want one of these. I'll show it to her next time we're here.Red Badger GuitarApollo:That's an odd guitar. The design is that character I saw in the hallway, but with sunglasses. What a strange mascot. He looks like he's crying. Since when was rock about crying? ...They should name this guy \"Emo\".SpeakerApollo:An old-fashioned speaker hangs from the ceiling. That must be to monitor what's happening out on stage. I think we had the same kind for my school's P.A. system.Wall posterApollo:...That police officer looks ready to rock. Some kids must see this and actually want to be cops. Somehow I don't think a rocking defense attorney would work too well.July 7Backstage HallwayEma:Hey, it's you! That Wright kid.Apollo:Detective Skye! (I'll let that \"Wright kid\" business pass.)Ema:Call me Ema. There's no need for titles once you've shared a bottle of fingerprinting powder!Apollo:That's a new one. So, um, Ema, what are you doing here?Ema:...Isn't it obvious? I'm snacking. You think I want to be here!? Me, in charge of security in this pit!?Apollo:Security...? Did something happen?Ema:There's no knowing with that glimmerous fop. Apparently, he's all upset because something was stolen. He wanted security back here during the concert. Where does he get off acting like he's some big rock star?Apollo:(...He is a big rock star.)Ema:Hey! You listening to me?Apollo:So... Where's this door here lead to?Ema:This one? That's Lamiroir's dressing room. Don't even think of going in there unless you want a piece of Snackoos in your face!Apollo:(Is she ever in a good mood, I wonder?)ExamineBlue Badger dollApollo:What's that odd looking doll doing there?Ema:MUNCH MUNCH... oh, MUNCH, that's the Blue MUNCH Badger.Apollo:Could you try either talking or munching, but not both?*ka-tonk*Apollo:(She hit me with a snack.)Ema:Serves me MUNCH right MUNCH for going MUNCH out MUNCH of MUNCH my MUNCH way MUNCHApollo:...... (Sorry, I don't speak Snackoos.)Ema:MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.EarpieceApollo:What's this? Some kind of headset earpiece?Ema:MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.Apollo:Why would someone leave this in the hallway?Ema:MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.Apollo:Maybe Lamiroir's bodyguard dropped it?Ema:MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.Apollo:Ema! Will you stop eating those snacks for one second and listen!?Ema:Hah! If you think you're going to pull me away from my snacks just to hear you mumbling... ...on and on about whatever, you're going to be sorely disappointed!Apollo:(...At least I got her to stop munching.)Instrument trunkApollo:That's a pretty sturdy-looking box there. Maybe it's an instrument case. There's a guitar next to it.Ema:Don't even think about taking that!Apollo:I don't think I could even carry it...*ka-tonk*Apollo:(She Snackoo'd me.)\"Dressing #1\" doorApollo:That's Prosecutor Gavin's... er, the Gavinners's dressing room.Ema:Put so much as a hand on the door and I'll Snackoo you.Apollo:Hold on! But I just came out of there!Ema:Don't play smart with me!Apollo:(*sigh*)\"Dressing #2\" doorLeads to:\"So this is Lamiroir's dressing room.\"Vending machineApollo:Come to think of it, I am a little thirsty.Ema:I'll have some tea.Apollo:...... I think I'll get a water.Ema:I'll have tea!Apollo:If you want tea so bad go buy it yourself!*ka-tonk*Apollo:(She Snackoo'd me.)Ema:I'll take a tea.Wall posterApollo:A Gavinners \"Guilty As Charged\" tour poster.Ema:They're plastered all over the place. It's annoying.Apollo:Well, this is the concert venue. It makes sense.Ema:Why? Everyone here is already here! Why advertise to them?Apollo:People like to see the poster at the concert... It's part of the experience.Ema:Do you have to find fault with everything I say?*ka-tonk*Apollo:(She Snackoo'd me.)TalkAny optionApollo:Um... Ema?Ema:MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.Apollo:(I've never seen someone eat snacks with such vehemence. Better give her a wide berth...)*ka-tonk*Apollo:(She Snackoo'd me.)PresentAnythingApollo:Ema, could you take a look at this?Ema:MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.Apollo:Um... What do you think?Ema:MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.Apollo:(That must be a bottomless bag of snacks.)Apollo:So this is Lamiroir's dressing room.Ema:If you even think about going in there, I'll--...BANG...!Apollo:......Ema:......Apollo:What was that?...BANG...!Apollo:Was that... a gunshot?...CRASH...!Apollo:(Something's going on!)Ema:You, out of my way!Apollo:E-Ema!Ema:Lamiroir! Lamiroir!......Ema:It's not locked... I'm going in!July 7, 9:30 PMLamiroir's Dressing RoomApollo:(What's that awful noise... Oh, it's the concert.) Aaack! That's-- (It's Lamiroir's manager! Mister what's-his-name...)Ema:LeTouse! Oh no... Hey, you!Apollo:M-Me?Ema:Watch this room for me. I have to call for backup!Apollo:R-Right, understood. You want me to make sure no one comes in, right?Ema:And don't touch anything! I'll be right back!Apollo:(...What's going on? I just talked to him, and now...)LeTouse:......Nnnh......Apollo:...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?LeTouse:...Sh...Shot. ...I was...shot.Apollo:Who? Who shot you!?LeTouse:...I don't know... Ask...Apollo:Ask? Ask what?LeTouse:Ask... wi...witness...Apollo:Witness... There was a witness!? Who!?LeTouse:...Cold... so cold... Witness...Apollo:You're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!LeTouse:...Can't s...see...Apollo:Hang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?LeTouse:The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...Apollo:(...\"Siren\"? How can a siren witness anything...?) Mr. LeTouse! Yipes! Ema!? (What was that!?) Wh-Who's there!?Ema:What's wrong?Apollo:Ema! Did you see anyone just now!?Ema:Huh? No...Apollo:(I could have sworn I heard a door close...)Ema:The concert's been cancelled. Backup's on its way. Is Mr. LeTouse... ...He's dead, isn't he? That's terrible.Apollo:...! (I lost him!)Apollo:(Romein LeTouse... shot. And I heard his last words... \"The witness is the siren\"... Whatever that means.)July 7Backstage Hallway???:The venue's locked down. We took names and addresses before letting the crowd go.Klavier:Good work, Daryan.???:I'll let you know if I find out anything about the victim. Later.Klavier:It's investigation time, then, ja, Fr\u00e4ulein Detective?Ema:I don't need some rock 'n' rolling prosecutor to tell me that.Klavier:One request I must make... Tell no one, on staff or otherwise, anything of this.Trucy:Ooh, a gag order!Klavier:No word gets out, other than that Mr. LeTouse is dead. No word of the cause of death, or of the murder.Apollo:Tell no one... Not even Lamiroir?Klavier:Not even her. We must keep everything under wraps. Oh, one other thing. I'll need your signature on this, Herr Forehead. Yours too, Fr\u00e4ulein.Apollo:On that? Hmm... An \"Investigation Request\"...?Trucy:Why just us?Klavier:You two are civilians. It's standard procedure.Apollo:(That should be OK to sign, I think...)Signed Prosecutor Gavin's Investigation Request.Klavier:Right, well, get started with the investigation!Ema:I'm on it already!Klavier:Ah, and one tip for you.Apollo:Huh? Me?Klavier:Try not to get in the Fr\u00e4ulein detective's way. ...She's in a foul mood today.Apollo:(Gee, I wonder why...)Apollo:(We were all questioned as witnesses... ...And now none of us can go home. We'll investigate alright. ...Our way!)Trucy:...Somehow I don't see us getting back to that crime scene any time soon.Apollo:I still can't believe I was there when it happened. Not an experience I care to repeat any time soon.Trucy:This is no time for navel-gazing! Let's crack this case!Apollo:(I worry about Trucy. She seems to have a very loose idea of what it means to be an \"attorney\". Of course, that's not surprising considering who her father is...)Trucy:Something the matter?Apollo:No... Let's get cracking!Apollo:(I'm the only one who was there... The only one who heard Mr. LeTouse's last words.)LeTouse:The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...Apollo:(First order of business is to find out what he meant by \"siren\"!)ExamineBlue Badger dollTrucy:That's the Blue Badger, the police mascot!Apollo:Does the Blue Badger have something to do with the band?Trucy:Well, yeah! The Blue Badger is the Gavinners's mascot, too!Apollo:Huh. Go figure.Trucy:I hear those things fly off the shelves.Apollo:(I'll have to take a closer look at one some day.)EarpieceTrucy:What's that? It looks like some kind of future-phone!Apollo:Not a phone, a transceiver. It's called a \"headset\".Trucy:What's a headset doing on the floor? Wait! Do you think Mr. LeTouse might have been wearing it? Like one of those bodyguards?Apollo:Hmm. I don't think he was wearing one when we first met. (The L.E.D. on this thing is lit. It must be on.)Instrument trunkApollo:Looks like an instrument case. A big instrument case.Trucy:There's a great magic trick you can do with one of these!Apollo:Huh? What kind?Trucy:The \"Miraculous Beautiful Girl Escapes the Case\" illusion.Apollo:So it's the girl who's miraculous, not the escape?Trucy:So picky!\"Dressing #1\" doorApollo:That's the Gavinners's dressing room. The crime scene was Lamiroir's dressing room... ...Next door.Trucy:Never know where clues might be hiding, Apollo! Let's case this joint!Apollo:(After you, Trucy, P.I.)\"Dressing #2\" doorApollo:Lamiroir's dressing room...Trucy:The scene of the crime!Apollo:We're not supposed to go in there.Trucy:But aren't we involved? Aren't we duty-bound to investigate!?Apollo:Sadly, no. (Though, the situation being what it is... Now may be our best chance to do some snooping...)Vending machineTrucy:I'm thirsty, Apollo!Apollo:...Want something to drink?Trucy:Hmm... How about... this one! A Steel Samurai Soda!Apollo:(\"Now in Real Steel flavor.\") ...Hmm.Trucy:Huh?Apollo:...Here, my treat.Trucy:Hey! This isn't enough change.Apollo:The machines outside are cheaper. This one is highway robbery.Wall posterApollo:A concert poster for the \"Guilty as Charged\" Tour.Trucy:I love that name! \"Guilty As Charged\"!Apollo:...Seems kind of negative to me.Trucy:Well, why don't we do the opposite! Magician Trucy presents the \"Innocent as Charged\" tour!Apollo:It kind of loses its impact, doesn't it?July 7Gavinners's Dressing RoomTrucy:Huh. Looks like nobody's here.Apollo:Prosecutor Gavin's probably busy with the case, too. No rest for the wicked.Trucy:No rest for us, either, Apollo! Let's get rocking! Rock, rock!July 7In the WingsTrucy:Hmm. The stage looks empty.Apollo:I was hoping to get a chance to talk to Prosecutor Gavin...Trucy:Oh well. Nothing to do but go to the crime scene, I guess!Apollo:I guess...ExamineComputerApollo:Look at all these electronic devices. I'm guessing they have something to do with sound.Trucy:Why guess when we can fiddle? Hmm... let's see here...Apollo:Don't touch that!Trucy:A healthy curiosity is the key to a good investigation! When in doubt, fiddle! That's what Daddy always says.Apollo:(They should require parental testing, clearly...)Guitar caseApollo:Now that's a big instrument case.Trucy:That's a case for a contrabass, I think.Apollo:You could fit twenty violins in there, I bet.Trucy:It may look like a violin, but it's a completely different instrument!Apollo:You could fit five Trucys in there, I bet.Trucy:Hey! Are you comparing me to an instrument? Hmm. I wonder who left it sitting open like that.(Step)ladderApollo:Look, a ladder. I guess they need one to work on the lights and such.Trucy:Why don't they use a stepladder? I prefer stepladders, really. ...Is that so wrong?Apollo:Not wrong, just... well, why do you prefer stepladders?Trucy:...... They're so much more flexible than plain old ladders!Apollo:...... (I prefer my ladders rigid and stable, thank you.)PianoTrucy:Wow, that piano looks much bigger close up! Machi played so beautifully...Apollo:Yeah, like a real pianist.Trucy:That's just silly, Apollo! How can you call someone as good as Machi a \"pianist\"? Why, that's like throwing him in the same class as Daddy!Apollo:...Good thing Mr. Wright didn't hear that one.StageTrucy:What a big stage! It's on a whole other scale than the Wonder Bar!Apollo:The lights were so bright I couldn't see the whole first part of the concert.Trucy:I'd love to do my act on a stage like this some day!Apollo:Just hold back on the lights, for my eyes' sake, please.Trucy:You'll be too blinded by my magic to worry about lights!Apollo:You probably don't want to blind the audience if you plan on showing them magic.July 7Lamiroir's Dressing RoomEma:Oh, it's you. I figured you'd come.Apollo:You have to let us investigate the scene, please!Ema:You're attorneys, no? Shouldn't you wait until you have a client...?Apollo:(LeTouse did tell me to ask the witness, the siren... ...With his dying breath, no less. Doesn't that count?)Ema:...G-Glare at me all you want, you'll get no snacks from me.Trucy:Please! Think of poor Lamiroir!Ema:Hmph. Oh well, I suppose. You did find the body with me.Apollo:Great! Let's get to it!Trucy:Right!Ema:Just try not to touch anything!Apollo:(She's letting us look! And she's not munching her snacks! This bodes well. There are clues here, I can feel it! Leave no hanger unhung, no spot unspotted!)ExamineAir ventApollo:......Trucy:What's wrong, Apollo? Your mouth is catching flies.Apollo:Ah? Um, nothing. It's nothing.Ema:\"Maybe that's how the killer escaped.\" ...That's what you were thinking, right?Apollo:Eh.Ema:When we arrived on the scene, the killer had already fled. He or she must have had a way out. And that air vent is one possibility.Trucy:But it's much too small.Apollo:Hmm... Not if the killer were about your size, Trucy...Trucy:......Apollo:......Trucy:I didn't do it!Apollo:Eh.Trucy:I was cutting up the dance floor at the time, thank you!Apollo:I know, I know! Of course I don't think you did it.Trucy:It's hard to tell with you, sometimes, Apollo.Apollo:(Hey! What have I done?)BroochTrucy:Ooh, what a pretty brooch! Oh, Ema...?Ema:You're not going to say, \"Can I have it, please,\" are you?Trucy:Oh.Ema:Look you may be a cute little girl of fifteen... ...but that doesn't get you any special treatment with me!Trucy:Oh...Apollo:It's not healthy to envy the young, Ema.Ema:It's not about envy! It's about tampering with evidence!Apollo:(Note to self: Ema lacks a sense of humor. Use caution.)Ema:You need to learn to respect your elders a little!Apollo:(...Something seems so familiar about that brooch.)Brooch added to the Court Record.Brooch (subsequent times)Trucy:......Apollo:(Trucy's still after that brooch, clearly...)Ema:No way! If you want one that bad, get your daddy to buy it for you!Trucy:Daddy always says: \"Trucy, if you want something go find or borrow it.\" Oh, and \"When in doubt, beg.\"Ema:Leave it to Mr. Wright...Apollo:(I'm a little concerned for Trucy's future... But I'm more concerned about the owner of that brooch.)Bullet holesTrucy:Are these... bullet holes?Apollo:Looks like it. There are two here in the wall.Ema:From the look of it, the victim was shot once in the shoulder. The first shot must have missed.Trucy:But there are two holes. Wouldn't that mean two misses?Ema:The murder weapon is a 45-caliber revolver. It's very powerful. I believe what we're seeing here... ...is the mark left by the second bullet after it passed through his shoulder!Trucy:Ouch... Sounds painful.Apollo:(No kidding. I wonder about this murder weapon...)Fruit basketTrucy:Ooh! Apollo! Can I eat some of those, please!?Ema:Absolutely not!Trucy:I know. I know! But still, I yearn!Ema:Look, you're not the only one eyeing that fruit here.Trucy:Well then, what are we waiting for? Let's eat!Ema:Right!Apollo:Whoa whoa whoa! Stop it! Are you two crazy? Ema, you of all people should know better...Ema:But she tempted me! She's a... She's a temptress!Apollo:(Please, grow up...)(Step)ladderApollo:Huh, another ladder.Trucy:Actually, it's technically a stepladder.Apollo:Well hello, Ms. Fancy Pants! Please forgive my lack of ladder discrimination.Trucy:! ......Ema:I'm less worried about the stepladder, and more worried about why it's there.Apollo:(Why is the ladder there? Well, to climb, right? To reach something on the ceiling?)Trucy:...... I still say it's a stepladder.Poster right of TVApollo:What's this poster...?Trucy:Let's see... \"This Summer: A Legal Eagles Production of 'Case Closed'.\" ...Looks like a poster for a different show.Apollo:...One I wouldn't mind seeing real soon.Poster above TVApollo:There's another Gavinners poster here.Ema:I'm just about sick of seeing those, personally. Maybe I'll tear it down! Ha ha!Apollo:No tampering with the crime scene, Ema!Ema:Hmph. Maybe there's something else I can tear to shreds...Trucy:D-Don't look at me!SpeakerApollo:That speaker was blaring at the time of the murder...Ema:Ah, that's for monitoring the stage from this room.Trucy:Monitoring?Ema:It pipes in a real-time feed from the stage microphones. Useful for knowing when your set is coming up.Apollo:Yes, I seem to recall it being loud and vaguely musical. (It made it hard to hear Mr. LeTouse's last words.)TelevisionTrucy:Ah, ah, Apollo! Look at that thing! It's huge! That... That's a TV!!!Apollo:Um, yeah, a wide flatscreen TV. I want one of those.Ema:You'll be wanting for a long time on your salary, junior. Wait till you're as famous as Mr. Wright was, then dream.Trucy:I don't think Daddy was ever rich, even when he was in law.Apollo:Great, just stomp on my dreams why don't you.Flower bouquetApollo:What an amazing bouquet. I mean, it's giant.Ema:Not sure I approve. It'd be better if this flower was a bit more... Oh.Trucy:Eek! The flower fell off!Apollo:What happened to preserving the crime scene, Ema?Ema:It's fine! Fine! I'll just put it back, see?Apollo:(How scientific...)HairdryerApollo:This is one of those... uh, things, right? At the barbers?Ema:A permanent dryer. Want me to curl those bangs of yours?Apollo:Um, no thanks.Trucy:Better not mess with his hair, Ema. It's part of his identity, you know.Romein LeTouse's bodyTrucy:Th-That's a body, isn't it?Ema:Sure is. The victim, no less. Let's take a closer look.Trucy:Eeek! G-Go ahead, Apollo. You first.Apollo:Me!? No, you should go first, Trucy, really...Ema:Will you two stop bickering and get over here!?Apollo:(She's munching on Snackoos again. Hope she's not too annoyed.)Romein LeTouse's left handTrucy:Apollo, look at this hand...Apollo:Hmm. He's holding something.Ema:Hey! No touching!Apollo:You can throw all the snacks at me you'd like, Ema. But sooner or later... you're going to run out of them.Ema:Hmm. You raise a good point. ...I'm a bit intrigued by this scene. Let's take a look.Trucy:Ah... see there? He's holding something! What's this...?Apollo:...A key ring?Trucy:You think it might belong to the killer!?Ema:Certainly a possibility...Apollo:(What an unusual key ring... And what unusual keys. This could be a vital clue.)Key Ring added to the Court Record.Romein LeTouse's left hand (subsequent times)Apollo:The body was holding a key ring...Ema:I wonder what it could mean?Trucy:It must mean something!Apollo:It doesn't look like the kind Mr. LeTouse would use. So the question is, whose key ring is it?Ema:Well, you're practically a detective there, Apollo.Trucy:Practically!Apollo:...... (I'm glad it brings them so much joy to mock me.)Smeared bloodTrucy:Eeek! Is that... blood? Umm... Why don't you examine this one, Apollo. You know more about, uh, red stuff than I do. Yep!Apollo:...Says who? (Something is strange about this blood, though... Is that what it looks like?)Mirror dresserApollo:Seeing these mirrors lined up like that makes me think I'm really in a dressing room.Ema:You are in a dressing room. Hmm... This must be makeup. ...I've never heard of most of these brands.Ema:Maybe they're Borginian?Trucy:Well, I haven't got a clue, and I doubt those are.Gift boxesApollo:Look at all these presents. Lamiroir sure is popular.Trucy:Ooh! I wonder what's inside? We... can't open them, can we?Ema:Probably not a good idea. You never know what you might find in one of these boxes. Bombs, razors, ransom notes... It could be anything.Trucy:...... I'm never having a birthday party again.RevolverApollo:This is the murder weapon, isn't it? This revolver...?Ema:That's right. A big 45-caliber revolver.Trucy:Wow. I wonder who brought this in here? I thought only police were allowed to have one of those.Apollo:......Ema:Why are you giving me that look!? I didn't do it!Apollo:I didn't...Ema:Listen, I was out in the hall eating Snackoos when it happened!Apollo:I know, I know! No one here thinks you did it, Ema.Ema:It's hard to tell with you, sometimes, Apollo.Apollo:(Hey! What have I done?)Trucy:Wait... If the killer brought a revolver... ...it must mean they had planned this from the start. That's right, right?Revolver added to the Court Record.Revolver (subsequent times)Apollo:A 45-caliber revolver, very deadly.Trucy:You know, Apollo, I was wondering... What's a caliber? And what does the \"45\" mean?Apollo:Huh?Ema:Heh, you want me to tell you? It's the size of the barrel. Simply put, the larger the caliber, the bigger the round. ...The bullet, in other words. Bigger bullets do more damage.Apollo:Wow, chalk one point up for forensic science.Ema:You know it!Trucy:...But it's not 45 inches, right? That'd be too big. What's the unit of measurement they use, Ms. Science? Well?Ema:...... Hush. Kids shouldn't ask so many questions.Small windowTrucy:Look, there's a little window over here! Maybe the killer escaped through that!Apollo:It's barely big enough for me to get my head through.Ema:Not to mention it only opens a crack.Trucy:...What? I was just saying it's possible.Apollo:Right, right, no harm in that. (Except I'm pretty sure it is impossible.)Ema:You could peek into the room through it, though, you know.TalkThe victimEma:Mr. \"Romein LeTouse\", wasn't it? He was Lamiroir's manager. And interpreter, apparently. This was his first time in the country.Trucy:Hmm... So I'm guessing he didn't know many people here.Ema:It doesn't seem likely. Nor can I think of anyone with a motive to murder him. ...Except for one person, of course.Trucy:One person...? Who?Apollo:Lamiroir. No one here might have had a motive, but she's from...Trucy:What are you talking about!?Apollo:Urk! H-Hey, it was Ema's idea!Ema:I said nothing. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.Apollo:(Always with the snacks...)Trucy:He's a big man. Or was. I don't think even I would win in a fight with him.Apollo:Which is why whoever it was used a revolver, I'm guessing.Ema:We've sent a request to the Borginian Embassy for more info on him.The crimeEma:Well, you and I know more about the crime than anyone.Trucy:Y-You do?Apollo:That's true. It was us who found the body.Trucy:Whaaaa-!? Hmph. I guess that's what I miss for watching the concert.Apollo:Hey, I wish I was watching the concert. ...Anything would be better than this.Ema:Well, we know the crime took place during the concert.Apollo:And when we heard the shot and entered the room... ...the killer was already gone.Trucy:What? But that doesn't make sense! You came in when you heard the shot and no one was here? How did they leave the room?Apollo:Hmm, that window is a little too small, isn't it?Ema:......Apollo:(The mystery of the disappearing killer...)The murder weapon (appears after presenting Revolver)Ema:What do you think about this revolver?Apollo:Well... it's pretty big. And heavy.Ema:That's right. It's a 45-caliber. That makes it one of the deadliest revolvers around. Even the police don't carry guns this big.Apollo:Really?Ema:Yeah. It doesn't make sense... You don't need so much power to kill at such close range. ...It's overkill.Trucy:I'm not sure I see the problem. I mean, whenever I go out to eat curry... ...I order it \"extra spicy\". Just to be sure it's spicy. Of course, I can only ever eat one or two bites.Apollo:...Um, and that's not a problem?Ema:There's another thing about a gun this big. It puts a lot of strain on the shooter.Apollo:Strain...?Ema:Yeah. Say, if you were to fire this revolver... ...the recoil would probably dislocate your shoulder.Trucy:Ouuuuuch! It's like the shooter's a victim, too!Ema:Yet, the killer used this revolver, and quite well. I'm guessing whoever did it was used to shooting.Apollo:(Used to shooting a high-caliber weapon? Hmm...)PresentAttorney's BadgeEma:You always carry that around, do you? ...Just like Mr. Wright.Apollo:Huh?Ema:It's good to never let yourself forget who you are. I'm proud of you. Keep up the good work.Apollo:(...Come to think of it, why do I carry this around? Though I suppose that's one compliment it's got me.)RevolverApollo:So this... is the murder weapon? (This revolver is incredibly heavy!)Ema:It's been fired twice. You can still smell the gunpowder... ...That's odd.Apollo:What's odd?Ema:Hmm? Oh, nothing.Trucy:Hey, no fair! Tell us!Ema:It's just, something about this revolver seems... strange.Apollo:Strange...?Anything elseEma:Hmm, sorry. I can't comment on anything not scientifically relevant. I am a forensic scientist after all.Apollo:(A self-styled one, at least.)Examine evidenceBroochBack sideApollo:A sort of pin-fastener for attaching things to clothes. Not a safety pin-type, though.Trucy:So if it's not a safety pin... ...is it a danger pin!?Apollo:I suppose if you stuck it in your eye, then yeah, sure. But you could do that with a safety pin, too, for that matter.Trucy:...... Thanks for taking the fun out of my danger pin.Apollo:(Aw, you're driving a danger pin through my heart here.)RevolverMuzzleApollo:Yikes! Don't point that thing at me!Trucy:Don't worry! I'm an old hand with firearms. I have one that shoots \"Bullets\".Apollo:I don't want it shooting any bullets, thank you!Trucy:Not those bullets, silly! My gun shoots \"Bullets, the Magic Cat\".Apollo:A cat... comes out of a gun?Trucy:I can tell your expression you've never heard of that trick. It's a great one!Apollo:(Honestly, That one sounds halfway interesting.)ChamberApollo:The middle of the weapon is a revolving chamber. That's where you load the bullets. A revolver, see?Trucy:Revolver... Revolver... That sounds a bit like \"Wonder Bar\"! Especially if you say it really fast!Apollo:Uh... I guess.Trucy:You know what I always used to think? I used to think the closest sound to \"Wonder Bar\" was \"One Liver\"! There's just so many words in the world, Apollo! Isn't it amazing!?Apollo:...... So many different words, so many different people. (...People like Trucy.)Key RingGuitar-shaped keyApollo:There are three keys on this heart-shaped key ring. Hmm? This middle key is shaped like... a guitar?Trucy:I get it! It must be the key to a guitar case!Apollo:A guitar case key... (I'll bet I know who this belongs to.)Trucy:...... Thanks for taking the fun out of my danger pin.Apollo:(Aw, you're driving a danger pin through my heart here.)After clearing all Talk options and examining brooch and Romein LeTouse's left hand:Ema:Well, that's about it. I think we've looked at just about everything there is.Apollo:I guess you're right.Ema:I know how you're feeling. It is hard to know when to stop. But anything more involved has to wait until the squad gets here.Trucy:Argh... I suppose...Ema:I'll go report the evidence. Sorry, but could you wait here till I get back?Apollo:Huh? Oh, actually, we have to--Ema:Great! Thanks!Apollo:...She left.Trucy:What do we do, Apollo? She told us to wait...Apollo:Great. Now how am I supposed to investigate?Trucy:Oh well, I guess it can't be helped. Let's go.Apollo:Huh? Go?Trucy:Time's a wasting, Apollo! We've got a lot of ground to cover!Apollo:Well, that's true, but... ...On second thought, why not. I'm sure everything will be fine.Trucy:Of course it will! Let's go!ExamineAir ventApollo:...... That air vent bothers me. If Ema and I came in through the door... That makes that vent the only exit from the room.Trucy:But it's much too small.Apollo:Hmm... Not if the killer were about your size, Trucy...Trucy:......Apollo:......Trucy:I didn't do it!Apollo:Eh.Trucy:I was cutting up the dance floor at the time, thank you!Apollo:I know, I know! Of course I don't think you did it.Trucy:It's hard to tell with you, sometimes, Apollo.Apollo:(Hey! What have I done?)BroochTrucy:......Apollo:No snatching people's brooches.Trucy:Darn... Maybe there's another one lying around here somewhere.Apollo:If there is, you can't have that one either.Trucy:...Don't be so stingy, Apollo.Apollo:...I think the word you're looking for is \"principled\".Bullet holesTrucy:Are these... bullet holes?Apollo:Looks like it. There are two here in the wall.Trucy:Well, if there are two marks, they must have missed twice.Apollo:Not necessarily... Some revolvers can put a bullet through a person. So it wasn't necessarily a miss.Trucy:Ouch... Sounds painful.Fruit basketTrucy:Ooh! Apollo! Can I eat some of those, please!?Apollo:Better not. Ema will find out. Somehow, she will. \"How could you eat those without telling me!?\"Trucy:Yeah... I'll make sure to leave some for her to eat, too.Apollo:(I don't think that's the issue here...)(Step)ladderApollo:Huh, another ladder.Trucy:Actually, it's technically a stepladder.Apollo:Well hello, Ms. Fancy Pants! Please forgive my lack of ladder discrimination.Trucy:! ......Apollo:I'd say this ladder is used to climb up to reach things. ...Is there something on the ceiling?Trucy:I still say it's a stepladder.Poster over TVApollo:Look, there's another Gavinners poster. Ema didn't seem too happy about it.Trucy:Maybe I should take it down before she rips it up.Apollo:You walk around with that thing and she'll sniff it out.Trucy:...Maybe I'll pass then.Apollo:(It's probably wise to be wary of Ema...)SpeakerApollo:That speaker was blaring when it happened. Apparently, it monitors sound from the main stage. ...Which made it hard to hear Mr. LeTouse's last words.Trucy:Well, you know what I do at loud concerts? I wear earplugs! It really cuts down on the noise.Apollo:...And this would have helped me hear him how?TelevisionTrucy:Ah, ah, Apollo! Look at that thing! It's huge! That... That's a TV!!!Apollo:Um, yeah, a wide flatscreen TV. I want one of those. Someday when I'm a famous attorney, I'll get one...Trucy:But Daddy never had one. I don't think he ever even had money when he was a lawyer.Apollo:Great, just stomp on my dreams why don't you.Flower bouquetApollo:What an amazing bouquet. I mean, it's giant.Trucy:That's super dazzle-frazzle!Apollo:...\"Dazzle-frazzle\"?Trucy:Yeah, it's super, and it makes you feel all dazzle-frazzle!Apollo:Um... Who taught you to say that?Trucy:Oh, Daddy.Apollo:(...I knew it.)HairdryerApollo:This is one of those... uh, things, right? At the barbers? It's one of those permanent hair things.Trucy:I've never tried one.Apollo:Want to?Trucy:Hmm... I think I'll stick with my top hat. We have an understanding, me and my hat.Apollo:(It's... just a hat, Trucy.)Romein LeTouse's bodyRomein LeTouse's left handApollo:The body was holding a key ring...Trucy:Do you think it belongs to the killer?Apollo:If it's not Mr. LeTouse's, that seems like a possibility.Mirror dresserApollo:Seeing these mirrors lined up like that makes me think I'm really in a dressing room. Look at all that makeup.Trucy:Well, I haven't got a clue, and I doubt those are.Apollo:(I guess she's not into makeup yet.)Gift boxesApollo:Look at all these presents. Lamiroir sure is popular.Trucy:I got a present once, from a person in the audience.Apollo:That's pretty cool.Trucy:Isn't it! Maybe you'll get one someday. ...From someone you defend!Apollo:(That's called getting paid, and I certainly hope I do.)RevolverApollo:A 45-caliber revolver, very powerful. This is definitely the murder weapon.Trucy:I wonder who brought this revolver in here? It's huge.Apollo:Someone unusual, that's for sure.Trucy:No one I want to meet, that's also for sure.Apollo:Me either. Unless it's in court, of course!Small windowTrucy:Look, there's a little window over here! Maybe the killer escaped through that!Apollo:It's only big enough to stick your head through. And it doesn't even open all the way.Trucy:...What? I was just saying it's possible.Apollo:Right, right, no harm in that. (Except I'm pretty sure it is impossible.)July 7Backstage HallwayTrucy:Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!Apollo:Who's there!?Trucy:We... didn't just imagine that, did we?Apollo:He was wearing a silk hat. ...Friend of yours?Trucy:Hardly!Apollo:(Whoever that was, he sure looked suspicious!)July 7In the WingsKlavier:What is it with today!? Problem after problem! Achtung!???:You ain't kidding.Trucy:It's the two leading members of the Gavinners, Apollo! Klavier on vocals, and Daryan on guitar! They're so cool!Apollo:I have a hard time thinking of \"Klavier\" as anything but a prosecutor, honestly.Trucy:Huh? What are they arguing about?Apollo:Probably the case, I'd bet.Klavier:My hog won't start. My guitar case is busted... ...my guitar's been burnt to a crisp, and to top it all off, someone's dead! ...And then there was that performance just now. What was that all about!?Daryan:Hey, man, don't blame me. You were the one who missed the cue.Klavier:Me? Miss a cue!? How could I conceivably get the most important part of that song wrong? How!? And what was all that tinny playing of yours?Daryan:Who you calling \"tinny\"!?Trucy:...Sounds like they're having a spat. One of those \"differences in musical direction\" bands are always splitting up over.Apollo:This is hardly the time...Klavier:...Hmm? What are you two doing here?Apollo:Ah, um, hiya. ......Klavier:We were just discussing the investigation, if you don't mind.Apollo:Sorry. Wait... You were what?Klavier:Listen... You need to confirm that with the Republic of Borginia, Detective Crescend.Daryan:Right. Anything else?Apollo:What did he just call him? \"Detective\"...?Daryan:Ah, greetings. Daryan Crescend... Criminal Affairs, Division 3.Apollo:Uh... H-Hello. (\"Criminal Affairs\"!?)Trucy:*sigh* Apollo... You really don't know anything about the Gavinners, do you?Apollo:(Something tells me that's about to be remedied.)TalkThe caseApollo:Um, about the crime...Klavier:...Which crime do you mean?Apollo:The murder, what else!?Klavier:Oh, that. For me, today has been a hit parade of crimes, you see.Trucy:Prosecutor Gavin was singing the blues earlier, wasn't he? ...Something about his hog, and his guitar case.Klavier:...Anyway. I'm afraid you know more about the killing of Mr. LeTouse than I do. ...For now, at least.Apollo:Huh?Klavier:You were the one who found the body, ja? While we were in the middle of a performance, no less.Trucy:Aren't you going to examine the crime scene, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:I'll leave that to Fr\u00e4ulein Detective. Wouldn't want to step on her toes.Trucy:They're not exactly best buddies are they. Ema and Prosecutor Gavin, I mean.Apollo:Well, what to do next. We've already checked out the scene. (Prosecutor Gavin may be right. We might be the most informed, for once.)Trucy:Maybe Prosecutor Gavin can shed some light on things we've found!The GavinnersTrucy:I don't believe you, Apollo! How can you come to this concert and not know about the Gavinners!?Klavier:It's not surprising. Why, even our ancestors knew nothing of America's existence once.Apollo:Um... I know America exists.Trucy:The Gavinners aren't just an average rock band, Apollo. Each member is connected to the police somehow!Apollo:The Police?Trucy:The real police! By day they pack heat, but by night they heat up the stage! By day those lips interrogate, by night they sing songs of unrequited passion!Apollo:...Um, OK.Trucy:They debuted seven years ago with \"13 Years Hard Time For Love\"... Then came \"Love With No Chance Of Parole\", and \"My Boyfriend Is The Prosecution's Witness\". The list of hits goes on and on!Klavier:This here's my right-hand man. ...Daryan Crescend. I make the melodies, and he attacks them with his guitar. He's a bit of a rogue, really.Daryan:Heh. And this guy's a bit of a perfectionist. When a performance goes the least bit wrong he goes into this funk... Just like today.Apollo:(I'd hope murder would be a bit more off-putting than a ruined concert...)Klavier:The concert today? A disaster! I'll get to the bottom of this and then we'll see who missed a cue!Trucy:The missed cue... They were arguing about that before...Apollo:(Great, I love nothing more than questioning tormented artists.)The missed cue (appears after \"The Gavinners\")Trucy:What's this missed cue you keep talking about?Klavier:Ah ha, you heard it, didn't you? From the audience?Trucy:Um, actually, I didn't notice anything...Daryan:See! No amateur is going to pick up on that!Klavier:Can you guarantee an entire audience of amateurs? No! Now take a listen to this!Trucy:What's that...?Klavier:A mixing board. We used it to record our concert tonight.Apollo:(Aren't we supposed to be investigating a murder...?)Trucy:Well, we've come this far, might as well go all the way! I've always wanted to learn about the recording industry!Klavier:This is but one of the devices used in recordings. We're a five-part band... This lets us record each member's performance separately. You use the sliders to adjust the volume for each part. Check it out!Trucy:Wow, neat! So, could you, say, hear only the drum part?Klavier:Of course. That's how we'll find the criminal guilty of missing his cue tonight!Apollo:I'm more concerned with the other criminal. The one who kills people.Klavier:You want help on the case? Then help me with mine!Apollo:(I guess rock 'n' roll comes before prosecuting.)Klavier:Let's begin! First, we bring up the part of the performance in question. You simply choose the section of the song you wish to hear on the upper-most bar. (Changed from [You simply choose the section of the song you wish to hear on the bottom-most bar.] in the original release) Like so. There it is. Now, listen.Trucy:...Was something wrong?Klavier:You couldn't hear it? Listen again, closely...Trucy:Ah... the timing's a little off, isn't it!?Klavier:You see? There! Right at the most important part! And even an amateur can hear it!Daryan:An amateur with a mixing board, maybe.Klavier:You're missing the point! We'll never stamp out crime until we're perfect. Perfect!Daryan:Here he goes again...Klavier:Right. Herr Amateur, you will prove my point.Apollo:Huh? Me!?Klavier:You will find the missed cue! You will tell us which instrument, which part, is the guilty party!Apollo:But how...?Klavier:Did I not just explain it? Move the sliders with [left analog stick up / W] and [left analog stick down / S] to adjust the volume for each part. (Changed from [Use these sliders to adjust the volume for each part.] in the original release) Then you will find the part that hopelessly bungles the cue with [left analog stick left / A] and [left analog stick right / D]! (Changed from [Then you will find the part that hopelessly bungles the cue!] in the original release) You'll find it, with your untrained amateur ears!Trucy:Nothing to do but try, Apollo!Apollo:(I guess... I'll admit, this looks kind of fun.)Klavier:First, a quick review: use [left analog stick up / W] and [left analog stick down / S] to adjust a part's volume. (Changed from [First, a quick review: use the slider to adjust volumes.] in the original release) Jump to another section of the song with [L / LB / Q] and [R / RB / E]. (Changed from [Press the section of the song you wish to hear on the bottom bar.] in the original release)Apollo:(And use [left analog stick left / A] and [left analog stick right / D] to switch parts, right? Got it.) (Changed from [Sliders and the bar, got it.] in the original release)Klavier:Once you've found the guilty part, press [X / Y / R] to point it out! (Changed from [Once you've found the guilty part, press the corresponding number!] in the original release) Time to rock!Present part 2Apollo:Leads to:\"This part is off.\"Present any other partApollo:Apollo:This part sounds a little off.Klavier:Let's see............... ...Herr Forehead.Apollo:Yes?Klavier:Let me guess... ...You got a D in high school chorus, didn't you?Apollo:(How'd he know!?)Klavier:This part is perfection. Absolute perfection. I'd bet all the royalties from my last platinum-selling album on it. The guilty part is elsewhere.Apollo:(Yeah, yeah, I know you sold a bazillion records.)Trucy:Focus, Apollo! I'll cheer you on!Apollo:Actually, it's probably better if you stay quiet... (Let's give this another shot.)Leads back to track selectionApollo:This part is off.Klavier:Which is that? Hmm... 2nd Guitar.Daryan:Ah.Klavier:It was you Daryan!Daryan:...... Ah well, looks like the cat's out of the bag.Klavier:\"Ah well\"? That's all you have to say!? That kind of attitude lets killers walk free, Daryan!Trucy:Here they go again.Apollo:Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to ask about the concert. It's starting to feel like we're just wasting time.Trucy:It's all experience under our belts! That can't be bad!Mixing Board added to the Court Record.Apollo:(I still can't get over the title for that song... ...\"Guilty Love\"...?)The missed cue (subsequent times)Apollo:(Best to avoid bringing up that topic again... I'm sure I can think of something else to ask about.)Gavin's troubles (appears after presenting Key Ring)Apollo:You were saying something about your motorcycle not starting?Trucy:And something about your guitar case being busted?Klavier:...You're well informed.Trucy:You mentioned it a few times.Klavier:Ach. Ach! It all happened this morning. It's all this key ring's fault.Apollo:The key ring...Klavier:It's got all my keys on it, ja? My bike key, my car key... and the key to my guitar case.Trucy:Wait, so this key ring...Klavier:...It disappeared. I thought I'd put it in my jacket pocket...Apollo:(Prosecutor Gavin's key ring... disappeared?)Klavier:I had to come to the concert by taxi. How embarrassing! And in order to get my guitar out, I had to break the lock.Apollo:Wait, this guitar wasn't the one that...Klavier:The very one. Up in flames... ...And right on stage, too.Trucy:I actually thought that was part of the show.Klavier:Crazy. ...And to top it off, Mr. LeTouse's life was taken. Nobody told me 'bout days like these.Apollo:Strange days, indeed.Klavier:...You think?Trucy:......Apollo:What's wrong, Trucy?Trucy:Well, I was just trying to make sense of everything. First this heart-shaped key ring gets stolen. Then a very expensive guitar flares up on stage. Then Mr. LeTouse dies...Klavier:Yes, and...?Trucy:Could it all really be just a coincidence?Klavier:Coincidence...? Meaning...? Daryan, can you make any sense of all this?Daryan:...Hey, don't look at me.Trucy:What do you think, Apollo?Apollo:Huh?Trucy:I mean, either Mr. Gavin's having a really bad day... ...or all this was planned.Klavier:...... You... aren't thinking what I think you're thinking... ...are you, Fr\u00e4ulein?Trucy:I am!Daryan:What? What!? Hey, don't leave me in the dark with Spike, here.Apollo:(...The name's Apollo, but yeah, I agree... Don't leave us in the dark! What are you talking about?)Trucy:Haven't you noticed a connection, Apollo? ...A curious connection between all of Mr. Gavin's troubles today?Apollo:Um, well...I have noticedApollo:You know, something was bugging me, too! That key ring, and the guitar, and the body...Trucy:Slow down there, Polly. You look a wee bit dizzy.Daryan:He's bluffing. He hasn't figured it out. Fess up, if you're a man. You're as clueless as I am!Apollo:Huh?Klavier:No, no, give Herr Forehead a chance. Let's see your evidence of the connection, shall we?Apollo:E-Evidence!? (Ack! I'd better think of something pronto!)Trucy:C'mon c'mon c'mon! Let's see it! What's the connection between all of Mr. Gavin's troubles?Present Lyrics SheetApollo:Leads to:\"It's this, isn't it?\"Present anything elseApollo:Apollo:The connection... is this! Right?Trucy:Um, I would say you were close, but really, you're kinda far. Remote, even.Apollo:(Oops. Try not to anger the Trucy, Apollo. No sudden motions... Just find that evidence slowly.)Leads back to:\"C'mon c'mon c'mon! Let's see it!\"Apollo:It's this, isn't it?Leads to:\"A lyrics sheet? ...\"The Guitar's Serenade\"...? What's that got to do with anything?\"I haven't noticedTrucy:You haven't!?Apollo:...I just don't see the connection. Sorry.Trucy:Well don't just give up! Give it a little more thought!Apollo:Wait... You don't mean this, do you?Leads to:\"A lyrics sheet? ...\"The Guitar's Serenade\"...? What's that got to do with anything?\"Daryan:A lyrics sheet? ...\"The Guitar's Serenade\"...? What's that got to do with anything?Klavier:It has everything to do with everything. Though I wouldn't have believed it if the Fr\u00e4ulein hadn't pointed it out.Daryan:What are you talking about, man? Enough with the riddles!Klavier:Maybe it is a coincidence, or perhaps it means something. Don't you think, Fr\u00e4ulein?Trucy:I do. Everything that's happened to Mr. Gavin today... ...is predicted in the lyrics to this song!Daryan:Wh-Whaaat!? No way!The song's prediction (appears after \"Gavin's troubles\")Trucy:Look, just think about everything that's happened to Mr. Gavin. Let's list them in the order that they occurred... ...while reading this lyrics sheet!Apollo:First, the key ring was stolen.Trucy:And not just any key ring! A heart-shaped key ring!Apollo:That's right here! \"When you stole away the keys my heart held on to so tight.\" This is a \"heart\" holding \"keys\"!Trucy:And next, his guitar burst into flame.Apollo:\"Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away...\"Trucy:And then Mr. LeTouse was killed...Apollo:\"Like a bullet of love. Fire. Take my life away...\" But... But that's crazy!Trucy:Yeah, no kidding!Daryan:So everything that happened today, here... ...This song predicted it all?Klavier:Or perhaps it was the other way around...Apollo:Huh?Klavier:The criminal could have based their crime on the lyrics. (Changed from [The criminal could have based his crime on the lyrics.] in the original release)Apollo:But who would go through all that trouble...?Klavier:Someone who moves in mysterious ways, no doubt. I believe you've stumbled upon something quite vital... and quite annoying, Fr\u00e4ulein.Trucy:Eh heh.Apollo:(She looks pleased...)PresentKey RingApollo:Um, I was wondering if you knew anything about this?Klavier:Th-That...!Apollo:Does it look familiar?Klavier:Familiar! It's mine! That's my key ring! I've been looking all over for it!Trucy:Whaaaaaat!? This is yours, Mr. Gavin!?Apollo:(I knew it...)Trucy:Apollo! How can you make that \"I knew it\" face!? This is the key ring that was...Apollo:Yeah, I know.Klavier:Thanks, anyway. So, where did you find it?Apollo:Erm, actually, the victim was holding it. Like he was trying to keep it from the killer. Even if it meant his life.Klavier:...... Wh-Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? The victim... you mean, Mr. LeTouse had my keys?Apollo:Indeed.Klavier:Hrmm... When will my trials be over?Trucy:Speaking of trials, I've never heard Mr. Gavin whine in court like he has been today.Apollo:Ema was right about the fop, I'll give her that.Trucy:Apollo! Mr. Gavin, maybe we can help. Tell us about your troubles today.Klavier:I really don't think that's...Trucy:Tell us... ...and we'll keep mum about the key ring for now.Klavier:Are... you blackmailing me, Fr\u00e4ulein?Key Ring (subsequent times)Klavier:Anyway... Thanks for finding this. If you'd found it under different circumstances, I'd be even happier.Trucy:I wonder why Mr. LeTouse was holding it?Apollo:Maybe he was trying to tell us something? Maybe that Prosecutor Gavin is the killer?Klavier:Herr Forehead, save your wild accusations for the court. I do so enjoy the penalties.Anything elseKlavier:Sorry, but I'm not in the mood to talk about that right now. Even I can only take so much in one day.Apollo:(Funny, I always thought of Prosecutor Gavin as one of those cool, stoic types. The sort that never complains. How wrong I was!)After clearing \"The missed cue\" and \"The song's prediction\" Talk options:Daryan:The lyrics predicting the crime... Klavier?Klavier:Seems a bit more than just a coincidence to me.Daryan:I have to agree. The key ring, the guitar, and the murder...Apollo:The key ring might have been dropped by accident.Klavier:Yet the victim was holding it. Hard to think that it was unconnected.Apollo:That's true. (Prosecutor Gavin's as calm and collected as ever...)Trucy:So the criminal matched their actions to the lyrics?Daryan:That sounds likely.Apollo:Why would anyone do that?Daryan:...While we think about that, I'm going to get cracking on the biggest crime here. I'm going to talk to the Borginian Embassy about this Mr. LeTouse.Klavier:Ah, right. Thanks, Daryan.Daryan:I'll leave the pondering of mysteries to you. I'm outta here.Klavier:A foreign national, Mr. LeTouse was killed... It seems like that would have to be the \"point\" of all this. But they did more than that. They left us with not only a murder, but a mystery!Trucy:Mr. Gavin sure is irritable today.Apollo:Maybe this is the real Prosecutor Gavin we don't get to see in the courtroom.Klavier:...I've had enough, frankly. If you find any more mysteries, do me a favor and keep them to yourselves, ja?Apollo:Ja... (I guess this is all we're going to get from Prosecutor Gavin. That leaves Lamiroir to question.) Prosecutor Gavin... do you know where Lamiroir is now?Klavier:Ah, I had her go to my dressing room. With that pianist, Machi Tobaye, of course. She seemed rather shocked by Mr. LeTouse's sudden passing.Apollo:(The Gavinners's dressing room. Got it!)TalkThe GavinnersTrucy:I don't believe you, Apollo! How can you come to this concert and not know about the Gavinners!?Klavier:It's not surprising. Why, even our ancestors knew nothing of America's existence once.Apollo:Um... I know America exists.Trucy:The Gavinners aren't just an average rock band, Apollo. Each member is connected to the police somehow!Apollo:The Police?Trucy:The real police! By day they pack heat, but by night they heat up the stage! By day those lips interrogate, by night they sing songs of unrequited passion!Apollo:...Um, OK.The song's predictionTrucy:Look, just think about everything that's happened to Mr. Gavin. Let's list them in the order that they occurred... ...while reading this lyrics sheet!Apollo:First, the key ring was stolen.Trucy:And not just any key ring! A heart-shaped key ring!Apollo:\"When you stole away the keys my heart held on to so tight.\" This is a \"heart\" holding \"keys\"!Trucy:And next, his guitar burst into flame.Apollo:\"Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away...\"Trucy:And then Mr. LeTouse was killed...Apollo:\"Like a bullet of love. Fire. Take my life away...\"Apollo:So this song prerdicted everything that was going to happen!?Klavier:Or perhaps it was the other way around...Apollo:Huh?Klavier:The criminal could have based their crime on the lyrics. (Changed from [The criminal could have based his crime on the lyrics.] in the original release)Klavier:Someone who moves in mysterious ways, no doubt. I believe you've stumbled upon something quite vital... and quite annoying, Fr\u00e4ulein.Trucy:Eh heh.Apollo:(She looks pleased...)July 7Backstage HallwayTrucy:Eeeeeeeeeeeeek!Apollo:Who's there!? ...There he goes again. Who is that guy!?Trucy:......Apollo:Huh? Trucy?Trucy:You know, he did look sort of familiar...Apollo:...So he is a friend of yours!Trucy:No, that's not it. ...Sorry, I don't remember.Apollo:(Curiouser and curiouser...)Examine evidenceKey RingGuitar-shaped keyApollo:There are three keys on this heart-shaped key ring. And this guitar-shaped key was the key to a guitar case.Trucy:Wasn't he saying he had to break his case because he couldn't get it unlocked? I could open a lock like that in 10 seconds, easy! He should have given me a call.Apollo:...So he could slap handcuffs on you after you opened it?Trucy:Handcuffs? 20 seconds, tops!Apollo:(I'm glad she's on my side.)July 7Gavinners's Dressing RoomTrucy:Ah... Lamiroir!Lamiroir:What... What has happened? I heard that Mr. LeTouse has died!Apollo:L-Lamiroir! You speak? I mean, you speak English?Lamiroir:Ah... Yes. I was invited here from the Republic of Borginia... But I am not Borginian by birth.Trucy:But wasn't Mr. LeTouse your interpreter...?Lamiroir:Ah that. Yes, well... It was Mr. LeTouse's idea. He thought it would add to the mystery, you see.Apollo:Then, your pianist is also...?Machi:....................Lamiroir:No, Machi Tobaye is Borginian. He does not speak English. Now, please tell me! What has happened to Mr. LeTouse? Why did he...Trucy:Actually, Mr. LeTouse was...Apollo:Trucy!Trucy:Huh?Apollo:Remember what Prosecutor Gavin said? \"Not a word\"!Trucy:B-But Mr. LeTouse is Lamiroir's manager! That's not fair to her! I mean, isn't she a related party?Apollo:(Precisely who Prosecutor Gavin doesn't want to alert, I'd suspect.)Lamiroir:All we have been told is to wait here in this room. It is very unsettling.Apollo:I'm sorry, we're trying to figure it out ourselves. Do... you think I could ask you some questions?Lamiroir:Of course. I am always willing to help.Apollo:(She's as calm as she looked on stage... I can't put my finger on why, but I like this Lamiroir.)Machi:[Foreign text]....Lamiroir:What is it, Machi?Machi:[Foreign text]....Lamiroir:What... but you'd be alone!Machi:[Foreign text]....Apollo:Um, what seems to be the problem?Lamiroir:Machi... he is not good around strangers. He wishes to go out for a breath of fresh air. Would that be alright?Apollo:Uh, sure, of course.Machi:....................Lamiroir:Very well. What is it you wished to ask me about?ExaminePostcards (if not already examined)Trucy:Look! It's a postcard of Lamiroir!Apollo:What are these letters at the bottom? I've never seen these before.Trucy:It must be her native tongue, Borginian! (Changed from [It must be her native tongue, Borginese!] in the original release)Lamiroir:\"A landscape painter in sound\"... This is how it would translate, roughly. Please, take one.Apollo:(\"A landscape painter in sound\"...? That's a nice image...)Postcard added to the Court Record.Postcards (subsequent times)Lamiroir:You see the words written upon the postcard? They say \"a landscape painter in sound\".Apollo:(\"A landscape painter in sound\"...? That's a nice image...)TalkLamiroirApollo:The Republic of Borginia... that's in Northern Europe, right?Trucy:I've never even heard of it...Lamiroir:I started out singing in a restaurant... Then a producer called me. Before I knew it... here I am.Trucy:You don't say! You know, my daddy plays piano in a restaurant!Apollo:Producers tend to look for talent, Trucy. ...Lamiroir, you're not from Borginia originally? Were you born here?Lamiroir:Well...Apollo:Oh, is that supposed to be a secret?Trucy:Image is everything when you're a star! I know a bit about that, of course...Lamiroir:Ah, yes, it is something like this. A contract, you might say. I'm also not to speak anything but Borginian in public. (Changed from [I'm also not to speak anything but Borginese in public.] in the original release)Apollo:Image is important, I guess.Trucy:She's not all image, though! Her songs are lovely! A real \"landscape painter in sound\"!Apollo:A painter in what?Trucy:She travels the world, turning the sights she sees into music! That's the secret to your music's beauty, right?Lamiroir:You're very perceptive.Trucy:Oh, I use your songs all the time in my stage act. ...I don't have to pay royalties for that, do I?Apollo:Stop while you're ahead, Trucy.Lamiroir:This \"landscape painter in sound\", too, is an image. Yet without it, my songs would not be so widely heard.Trucy:They even call you the \"Siren of the Ballad\", right?Lamiroir:Yes. In Borginian, \"Lamiroir\" means \"the Siren\". (Changed from [Yes. In Borginese, \"Lamiroir\" means \"the Siren\".] in the original release) I fear that, perhaps, already I am not the siren I once was.MachiTrucy:Your pianist... Machi, was it? He's cute! Like a porcelain doll...Apollo:He's very \"European\".Lamiroir:I met him while singing in restaurants in Borginia. He is an orphan... yet his playing is exquisite. Soon he came to live with me.Trucy:It's like a fairy tale, almost...Apollo:I noticed he hardly leaves your side.Lamiroir:Yes, well, he is blind. At first, I hesitated at dragging him across the world.Apollo:He doesn't speak English, either, does he?Lamiroir:He had never left Borginia before we met. I made his presence part of my contract. Machi and I together are \"Lamiroir\". Together, always.Mr. LeTouseLamiroir:Mr. LeTouse... was my new manager.Apollo:New?Lamiroir:Yes, from three months ago. Around when I received Mr. Gavin's invitation to come. I met Mr. LeTouse at my office. He was to be my manager and bodyguard... And, as it turned out, my interpreter.Apollo:Interpreter... even though you speak English.Lamiroir:Yes... but we were to visit more places than just here. We had a concert in Japan scheduled after this one. Though I fear that may have to be canceled now...Trucy:Was Mr. LeTouse from the Republic of Borginia, too?Lamiroir:Well... he was only with me for three months. I'm afraid there is much I do not know about him. And now, I shall never know. No one will even tell me why he has died.Apollo:I-I'm sorry... Prosecutor Gavin said we weren't to talk to anyone...Lamiroir:Mr. LeTouse... was a talented man. The \"Siren of the Ballad\"... That phrase was his idea, you know. I am happy for him that it has become so well known.After clearing \"Lamiroir\" and \"Mr. LeTouse\" Talk options:Apollo:The \"siren\"... That's what he meant!Trucy:Huh? Apollo?Apollo:You are \"the Siren\", right Lamiroir?Lamiroir:That is the meaning of my name in Borginian, yes. (Changed from [That is the meaning of my name in Borginese, yes.] in the original release) It was the name my producer gave me. But why do you ask?Apollo:...It's very important. I had to know for sure if the \"Siren\" was you.Lamiroir:What do you mean, important?Apollo:...I'll tell you. You deserve to know.TalkThe \"Siren\"Apollo:\"Siren\"... It turns out that's a very important word in this case.Trucy:H-How?Apollo:When we found Mr. LeTouse... ...he was still alive.Lamiroir:What...?Apollo:I heard him say something... ...his last words.Apollo:Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?LeTouse:Ask... wi...witness...Apollo:Hang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?LeTouse:The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...Trucy:He said \"siren\"... Really?Apollo:I was the only one there to hear it... ...but I'm sure that's what he said!Lamiroir:Mr. LeTouse said that!? \"Ask the witness\"...?Apollo:And you're the Siren, Lamiroir.Lamiroir:......Apollo:Did you see what happened?Lamiroir:......Apollo:Lamiroir...?Lamiroir:Might I ask, are you with the police?Apollo:Eh! Uh, well, no. I'm a defense attorney.Lamiroir:An attorney? Yet there have been no arrests, yes?Apollo:...Is that a problem?Lamiroir:Does an attorney not work for a \"client\"? If you have no client, you should leave the investigation to the police, I think.Trucy:But Lamiroir, we...Lamiroir:I am sorry, but I cannot answer your questions. I'm afraid you lack the authority to ask them.Apollo:Ack... (Why...? If she witnessed the crime, why won't she tell us...?)Lamiroir:I believe we are through here.Apollo:...I believe so.The \"Siren\" (subsequent times)Apollo:\"Siren\"... It turns out that's a very important word in this case.Trucy:H-How?Apollo:When we found Mr. LeTouse... ...he was still alive.Lamiroir:What...?Apollo:I heard him say something... ...his last words.Apollo:Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?LeTouse:Ask... wi...witness...Apollo:Hang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?LeTouse:The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...Trucy:He said \"siren\"... Really?Apollo:I was the only one there to hear it... ...but I'm sure that's what he said!Lamiroir:Mr. LeTouse said that!? \"Ask the witness\"...?Apollo:And you're the Siren, Lamiroir.Lamiroir:......Apollo:Did you see what happened?Lamiroir:......PresentBroochApollo:That reminds me... Does this brooch look familiar to you?Lamiroir:My brooch... yes! Well... It may be mine.Apollo:Yours, Lamiroir...?Lamiroir:I was wearing a brooch earlier, you see. I must have lost it.Trucy:Well that explains the brooch we found. It was Lamiroir's!Lamiroir:Thank you. I was wondering where I'd dropped it.Apollo:(So this brooch belongs to her... That begs the question...)Trucy:Is something wrong, Apollo?Apollo:(...What was this brooch doing at the crime scene?)Brooch (subsequent times)Lamiroir:I believe that brooch is mine, yes. ... I was wondering where I had dropped it.Apollo:(So it's Lamiroir's brooch, which begs the question... ...what was it doing at the crime scene?)Anything elseApollo:Would you mind taking a look at this, Lamiroir?Lamiroir:...... I'm sorry, I'm not sure what to say. I wish I could help you.Apollo:Ah, don't worry about it.

It's all your fault, you know!Apollo:(Oops. Maybe this is about us leaving the crime scene.)Trucy:What do you mean by \"impossible\"?Ema:Well it's gone!

I'm rather enjoying this.Apollo:(How could Mr. LeTouse's body just \"disappear\"?)Trucy:Well, you heard the man. Let's get searching!Daryan:...Hey, I don't know if this's exactly the right time, but...Klavier:Yes, Daryan?Daryan:See, Geeter's gone missing. It was in the dressing room.Trucy:Geeter? Who's Geeter!?Daryan:That's what I call my guitar! You like, man?Klavier:Your guitar... was stolen?Ema:This hasn't been a good day for guitars or geeters.Klavier:OK. Body first, then guitar.

And we've got to find it!Apollo:(She would be more convincing if she wasn't standing around eating her precious Snackoos.)July 8, 12:57 AMIn the WingsTrucy:Hmm. Does something seem different to you, Apollo?Apollo:Something is definitely different here.Trucy:Let's check it out!ExamineStage towerLeads to:\"That stage there must have been lowered before.\"Anywhere elseTrucy:I'm not sure that's all that important right now. Let's check out that thing in the middle of the stage!Trucy:That stage there must have been lowered before.Apollo:That's the tower that Lamiroir and Prosecutor Gavin were singing on.Trucy:Someone must have raised it. Hmm. I don't see a way to control it from here. Apollo, what about that ladder there against the wall? We could use that to take a look up top...Apollo:...... Maybe we should get Ema.Trucy:What are you talking about? We have to see this sort of thing for ourselves!Apollo:(I'm... not so good with heights.)Trucy:Stop whining and start climbing!Apollo:Urk...Apollo:(It didn't look that high from below, really. But when we got to the top, I felt every one of those fifteen feet down.

I apologize for being so upset...Trucy:Mr. Gavin, do you know what's going on? Why did they arrest Machi!? Why!?Apollo:Don't look at him like it's his fault either.Klavier:It was tough for me, too. We performed together that night, after all. Yet...Trucy:Yet?Klavier:The powers that be say that, given the circumstances, it could only have been him.Apollo:What do you mean by the \"circumstances\"?Klavier:Lamiroir was invited from Borginia as an ambassador of goodwill. It is vital that this case be wrapped up swiftly. That's all the powers that be want, really.Apollo:Well those are circumstances, alright. But what makes Machi the only possible suspect?Klavier:Herr Forehead... You seem to have forgotten that you're talking to the prosecution... the enemy.Apollo:Ah. Right. (I think I like this side of Prosecutor Gavin better, actually.)Klavier:I'm not at liberty to discuss the particulars of the case. ...Especially not to the defense attorney.Apollo:What... did you just say? Me? The defense attorney?Klavier:That's what I came to tell you. He's down at the detention center... He wants to request your services.Apollo:He...? You mean Machi?

Yes?Judge:Say you're going to visit someone in the hospital with an incurable disease... What do you say to them?Klavier:Eh?Judge:I mean, you wouldn't say \"get well soon\", right? You'd only be kicking them when they're down...Apollo:Um, what are you talking about?Judge:Ahem, actually I'm going to visit someone who is terminally ill. ...Right after this trial. The Chief Justice's son.Apollo:The Chief Justice...?Judge:His son is afflicted with a most terrible disease... He doesn't have long, it seems.Apollo:Ah...Judge:So I thought I'd go pay him a visit. I thought saying something moving might be the order of the day.Trucy:Why don't grown-ups ever just say what's on their mind instead of pretending?Apollo:(She's looking at me with something like... disgust.) ...Hey! What are you looking at me like that for!?Judge:In any case... I'm a bit busy today, so let's wrap this up quickly. Prosecutor Gavin, your opening statement, briefly!Klavier:You're in luck, Herr Judge... I believe you'll be going on your hospital visit sooner than you think.Apollo:...!Klavier:First, to review the victim in this case. Romein LeTouse, age 35. The global manager for diva songstress, Lamiroir. The cause of death: blood loss due to being shot by a large caliber revolver. This report has all the details.Judge:The court accepts this into evidence.LeTouse's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:45-caliber... That's quite large, isn't it? A direct hit from that could knock a man off his feet.Klavier:However, the bullet struck him in his shoulder. The damage to his body was slight... death was not immediate. Sadly, his blood loss was such that he could not be saved.Judge:Hmm... I suppose the victim's condition could have been much worse, considering.Crime Photo added to the Court Record.Klavier:...Two shots were fired. One shot missed, the other penetrated and passed through the victim's shoulder. Both bullets were found in the wall at the scene. Observe the diagram... ...This is where the bullets hit.Judge:I see... The court accepts this evidence.Diagram added to the Court Record.Judge:If we're talking about a 45-caliber revolver... ...we must assume that the killer was adept at the weapon's use.Trucy:Really?Apollo:Yeah, apparently, weapons that size have a powerful kickback. If, say, the judge tried to fire one, it'd break every bone in his body.Judge:The defense will take more care in choosing examples!Klavier:...As I was saying, the victim was shot backstage, in a dressing room. This dressing room has only one entrance: this door.Judge:That does seem to be the case, yes.Klavier:However, there were witnesses who heard the gunshots.Trucy:He's talking about you and Ema, huh.Klavier:Yet when the witnesses entered the room... ...it was empty, save for the victim's body, of course.Judge:B-But that's... That's impossible!Klavier:Exactly. This murder was impossible. ...For all but one person.Judge:One person?Klavier:That is, of course... ...the defendant, Machi Tobaye.Judge:Only this defendant could have committed the crime? But how?Klavier:It's quite simple. The circumstances of the crime scene make it clear.Judge:Very well, I assume you have testimony to back up this claim. Please show the witness to the stand! (Changed from [Let the witness please take the stand!] in the original release)Klavier:Your name and profession, please.Ema:Ema Skye, I'm a detective for the police department. I was on security detail at the concert forum that night.Apollo:(Ema seems... tired, somehow.)Judge:Hmm... Security at the concert, you say?Ema:Some security I was. Couldn't even stop a murder... ......Judge:Now, don't blame yourself! Things like this happen! I've made even bigger mistakes in my career, you know!Apollo:(I'm sure that makes her feel much better.)Trucy:I want to hear about these bigger mistakes!Klavier:In any case... Because you were on security detail, the crime was quickly discovered. And, we were able to identify the killer.Ema:......Klavier:You may give the court your testimony, if you would. Describe the circumstances of that day, and your discovery of the crime, please.Ema:...Alright.Witness Testimony-- Murderous Circumstances --Ema:The night of the murder, I was on security backstage, at Prosecutor Gavin's request.Only people involved with the concert in some way were allowed backstage.At the beginning of the third set... I heard shots.I went into the room, filled with blaring rock music, and found the body.I examined the scene and determined that only the defendant could have done it.Judge:Hmm... It was lucky that a detective was the first on the scene.Trucy:But that door was the only way out of the room, right?Apollo:Yeah, pretty much.Trucy:Then I don't get it. How can they say that Machi did it?Apollo:Looks like we need a bit more information.Judge:Very well, the defense may begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Murderous Circumstances --Ema:The night of the murder, I was on security backstage, at Prosecutor Gavin's request.PressApollo:Apollo:The night of the murder was the night of the concert, yes?Ema:That's right.Apollo:What was a detective doing on security detail, might I ask? ...If it was only a concert?Ema:My thoughts exactly. But, orders are orders. Even when they come from rock gods.Apollo:Prosecutor Gavin...?Klavier:Yes, allow me to explain. I smelled something that day, you might say. The stench... of conspiracy. That day, at the concert hall.Apollo:Conspiracy...?Klavier:Well, isn't it obvious!? My keys! That whole morning, no, the whole day was ruined! And it's all because someone stole my keys! I couldn't ride my hog to the show, I couldn't open my guitar case...Trucy:There he goes again.Apollo:Isn't it possible he simply misplaced them?Klavier:Misplaced them!? Misplaced items don't just wander into a murder victim's hand on their own!Judge:What's this!? Prosecutor Gavin, if your keys were in the victim's hand... That makes you a prime suspect!Klavier:...\"Love, slow-acting and new. Atroquinine... is waiting for you...\"Trucy:He's singing something.Apollo:Does everything with this guy have to be so over-the-top?Klavier:...The killing happened in the middle of my concert. I was... like a sailor, adrift on a sea of sound. Anyway, I didn't want anything else stolen. So I put the detective with the most time on their hands on the task.Judge:I see. I can accept that.Ema:Well I can't! What do you mean \"time on their hands\"!?Judge:Please, the testimony.Ema:Only people involved with the concert in some way were allowed backstage.PressApollo:Apollo:...We were let in, though.Ema:I didn't know about that! I certainly didn't invite you.Klavier:I gave the Fr\u00e4ulein special permission to be there. ...I wanted to see her again.Trucy:Oh boy! Did you hear that? We're officially involved now!Apollo:Gee, great.Ema:Some other hangers-on tried to get backstage, but I drove them off.Apollo:(So no other \"outsiders\" were there, then.)Ema:And then...Ema:At the beginning of the third set... I heard shots.PressApollo:Apollo:I believe we were having a chat when we heard the shots.Ema:You were the one chatting. I was eating Snackoos.Judge:Ah! Hey! No snacking in court!Klavier:And you're sure the shots came from Lamiroir's room?Apollo:Yes, absolutely.Ema:Hey, I'm the one being cross-examined here! Here, this'll keep you quiet!*ka-tonk*Apollo:Ah, thanks. So...MUNCH...how about it ...MUNCH...Ema?Ema:We were right...MUNCH...there. Hard to be mistaken about that...MUNCH.Judge:Please, either talk, or eat. Not both at the same time!Ema:...... *gulp* Right, so after that... ...me and Mr. Lawyer there opened the dressing room door.Ema:I went into the room, filled with blaring rock music, and found the body.PressApollo:Apollo:Rock?Ema:Blaring, yes.Judge:When you say \"rock\", are you referring, perhaps... ...to this \"rock 'n' roll\" music that's so popular these days?Apollo:(That's right, when we went into the dressing room... ...music was blaring over the speaker on the wall.)Ema:They pipe sound from the stage into the backstage through speakers. That way people in the back can hear when they're supposed to be on stage.Apollo:Did it have to be so loud?Klavier:You don't listen to the Gavinners with your ears. You feel it with your entire body and soul! I always have the backstage monitors at full volume.Ema:When we walked in the room... ...the band was playing \"Guilty Love\", I believe. Making it easy to determine the time of the crime.Judge:Hmm... If you could hear that music playing...Klavier:...Then everyone on stage for that song has an alibi. Including myself.Ema:Anyway, I closed off the scene and started my investigation.Ema:I examined the scene and determined that only the defendant could have done it.PressApollo:Apollo:How could you know something like that!?Ema:As I said, it was clear from the circumstances. Listen... We know there was only one exit from the room: that door. The small window only opened a tiny crack. And I was standing in front of that door. So, how could the killer have fled the scene? There's only one possibility: the air vent.Judge:Ah...Apollo:Apollo:B-But that air vent was too small! Who could possibly...Ema:Exactly.Apollo:...!Ema:There's certainly no way you could get through. Nor me. The only one who could fit through... was a child.Apollo:A child...Ema:Remember, access to those rooms was limited. Only those involved with the concert were allowed.Klavier:And of all the people involved with the concert... ...only one is small enough to be considered a \"child\".Judge:The... The defendant!?Klavier:The pixie of the arpeggio flitted up toward the sky... ...and disappeared from the scene of the crime.Apollo:Apollo:B-But that's just conjecture!Klavier:Oh? There was no other way out of that room. You were there. You should know, Herr Forehead.Apollo:...!Ema:And... there is another vital piece of evidence.Apollo:Evidence...? What!?Ema:Marks were found on the air vent grill. Traces that it had recently been opened.Apollo:Wait, what...!?Ema:And something else was found, quite clearly. The defendant, Machi Tobaye's fingerprints.Apollo:Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge:Order! Order! Order!Klavier:That air vent was the only way out of the room! The defendant's fingerprints were found on the grill! ...Well, Herr Forehead? What fairy tale does this suggest to you?Apollo:Urk...!Klavier:Only one could pass through that vent, that \"doorway to heaven\"... ...and that one is our pixie.Apollo:......Trucy:Why are you looking at me, Apollo? Hey! I was out whooping it up in the audience!Apollo:(So this was his decisive evidence...)Judge:Hmm... Quite decisive, indeed.Apollo:(I know the circumstances under which the body was found... I was there.)Trucy:An examination of the crime scene was enough to nail down the killer?Apollo:I'm sure they have a good reason. (They must have had a good reason to arrest Machi... ...And I'm going to find out what it was!)After pressing first, fourth, and fifth statements:Judge:I believe that's enough of that.Apollo:!Judge:The prosecution has a rather convincing case. The only way in and out of the crime scene was watched. Making the defendant the only one who could possibly leave the scene. Simple, and decisive.Apollo:Ugh...Judge:I believe we've heard enough to determine our verdict. Even if I wasn't in a hurry to make a hospital visit.Klavier:I'm sure the Chief Justice will appreciate the gesture. Unfortunately, we have no direct witnesses. Fortunately, the criminal left decisive evidence for us. That will have to be enough.Apollo:(Argh! It can't be over already!)Judge:Very well, I believe this trial is finished. If the defense has no contradicting evidence...?Klavier:The prosecution has presented our proof, clear and plain. If you have contradicting evidence... ...it'd better be clear and plain.Trucy:Ack, Apollo! They've got us on the ropes already! We'd better come up with something quick!Apollo:I know! I know! (Think! What can get us out of this!? We need evidence, or a witness, that can prove Machi is innocent beyond a doubt. Without that... *gulp*)Judge:Mr. Justice? Do you have contradicting proof that can overturn the prosecution's case? If you do, you'd better tell us about it now.Apollo:(This is it... and so soon! If I mess this one up, it's all over...!) The court wants contradicting proof?Present evidenceApollo:The defense is prepared to show contradicting evidence!Klavier:This should be interesting! What sort of evidence?Judge:Yes, what sort of evidence, Mr. Justice? Show us evidence contradicting the prosecution's claims!Present anythingApollo:Apollo:This evidence does more than contradict, it flips the whole case on its head!Judge:......Klavier:Thank you for presenting evidence that is both clear and plain, as requested.Judge:Yes... Clearly and plainly wrong! I'm afraid the only thing flipped on its head here was you as a child, Mr. Justice.Apollo:(Ugh... I guess that wasn't it.)Klavier:My claim is clear: the only person who could have fled the scene was the defendant.Judge:And there were no witnesses, either.Klavier:I fear the defense's options are limited, Mr. Justice.Apollo:(Grr! There's only one way out of this... Evidence, or a witness, that can prove Machi's innocence beyond a doubt.)Judge:Let's ask the defense once again.Leads back to:\"Do you have contradicting proof that can overturn the prosecution's case?\"Call a witnessLeads to:\"Prosecutor Gavin, you claim that there were no witnesses to this crime.\"I don't have proofApollo:I... don't have contradicting proof, actually.Judge:Too bad. Very well, this court finds the defendant...???:Trucy:W-Waaait!Judge:Wh-What for?Trucy:We have, uh, what was it called? Contradictual proof? Anyway, whatever it is, we've got it!Judge:Is this true?Trucy:Of course it's true! Show 'em, Apollo!Apollo:What the heck are you talking about!?Trucy:Look, we give up now, Machi's really done for!Apollo:(She's right... If we give up here, we're finished. I need proof or a witness... I must have something...!)Judge:Alright, we'll give you another chance, then.Leads back to:\"Do you have contradicting proof that can overturn the prosecution's case?\"Apollo:Prosecutor Gavin, you claim that there were no witnesses to this crime. Are you absolutely sure?Klavier:Absolutely. I'd swear it on my career as a prosecutor... And on my million-seller hit song \"Atroquinine, My Love\".Trucy:...There he goes again.Apollo:That's too bad, because there was a witness.Judge:Ho ho! Really now? But how did you come to possess knowledge the prosecution clearly does not?Apollo:Because I am the only one in the world who knows this.Apollo:(...What's going on? I just talked to him, and now...)LeTouse:......Nnnh......Apollo:...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?LeTouse:...Cold... so cold... Witness...Apollo:You're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!LeTouse:...Can't s...see...Apollo:Hang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?LeTouse:The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...Judge:Whaaat!? The victim said this before he died!?Klavier:Perhaps he did... and perhaps he did not.Apollo:What do you mean by that?Klavier:All we know is what Herr Forehead says he said. It's no testimony, especially since it comes from the defense attorney himself.Apollo:Apollo:But it's the truth! He said it! I even told you about it! But apparently, you ignored me completely.Klavier:It's my policy to fully investigate everything I deem relevant. Clearly this rookie lawyer thinks he can tell me how to do my job.Judge:...That's enough! Mr. Justice, we need clear contradictory proof from you. This witness of yours, unknown to the prosecution... ...I hope you're right. Failure carries a stiff penalty.Klavier:Perhaps... A stiffer penalty than usual is called for?Apollo:(Urk! There's no backing out now!)Judge:Let's hear the name of your witness, Mr. Justice.Present Lamiroir profileApollo:Leads to:\"Lamiroir...?\"Present anyone elseApollo:Judge:And you claim that they witnessed the murder?Klavier:This is a bit unexpected. And you have proof?Apollo:Well, actually... (Uh oh. I can't think of anything.)Judge:I know that look, Mr. Justice. It's the look of a man who's about to be penalized.Klavier:I doubted there was a witness in the first place. No one had time! They were far too busy rocking to our wild sounds!Trucy:My heart was handcuffed to the stage, I know that!Ema:I felt nothing.Klavier:...It's sad but true. Some people will never appreciate true art.Apollo:(Why's he pointing at me!? Think, how can I get him to accept there was a witness? I need some kind of proof...)Judge:Let's start over, shall we?Leads back to:\"Let's hear the name of your witness, Mr. Justice.\"Judge:Lamiroir...?Apollo:Recall Mr. LeTouse's last words.LeTouse:The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...Judge:The siren... Ah ha! He meant the \"Siren\"!Apollo:That's right. The \"Siren of the Ballad\"... Lamiroir! Lamiroir was only on stage for the second set... ...and she had access to the backstage area. She could have been a witness!Judge:I see... Well, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:My claim still stands. There was no witness to this crime!Judge:Very well! Let's hear it from the horse's mouth then, shall we? We will now take a break from Detective Ema Skye's cross-examination. ...Please show Lamiroir to the witness stand.Apollo:(Lamiroir would say nothing the night of the murder... Not today, though. Today we'll drag that story out of her no matter what it is!)Klavier:......Klavier:It is my distinct honor to welcome the Siren of the Ballad to our courtroom...Lamiroir:You are too kind.Judge:Ah, y-you can speak English?Lamiroir:Yes... Yes I can. Though I am not very good. ...There is much I do not know.Judge:You speak so well! Have you spent time here before?Lamiroir:Actually, I do not know how I came by my knowledge of your language. Nor where I studied it...Apollo:...? (What does she mean, she doesn't know...?)Klavier:I, too, thought to call her as a witness. But I did not. I had a reason, of course.Apollo:What's that?Klavier:Lamiroir... suffers from amnesia.Judge:Amnesia...?Lamiroir:Lamiroir... is not my true name. Yet I remember nothing of the time before I was given it. ...Nothing of the time before I started singing on stage.Trucy:Whoa! She's even more mysterious than I thought!Klavier:As lauded singer Lamiroir, she lives a good life. There are little difficulties for her, thanks to her success. Yet... I did not wish to subject her to unnecessary stress.Judge:Hmm... I see. I care surprisingly little about people's pasts. You have nothing to fear in this court, Lamiroir.Lamiroir:...Thank you. Yet there is something I do not understand. I am being called as a witness? What might I say? No one will tell me anything of what happened...Klavier:Lamiroir, let me be frank. I did not want to ask you up here to testify. Yet, that young gentleman with the wide forehead over there was adamant that you stand.Lamiroir:Oh my...Trucy:Congratulations, Apollo. You're the bad guy!Apollo:Ugh...Judge:Well, now that you're here, please give us your testimony. ...If nothing else, the sound of your voice is welcome. Tell us what you saw the night of the crime!Witness Testimony-- What I Saw --Lamiroir:As for what I saw... I saw nothing.That night, I was invited to sing on stage, and this I did.I did not return backstage after the second set.Then I was led by the police to Mr. Gavin's dressing room, and told to wait there.That was where I learned that something had happened... But I wasn't told the details.Judge:Hmm... I must say, you sound wonderful just testifying.Apollo:(I hope he was too distracted to hear what she was actually saying...)Klavier:There you have it. She saw nothing that night. Now we can only pray that the defense has the sense to admit defeat. ...And refrain from detaining her here longer than need be.Trucy:Wow, you just got badder, Apollo! Way to go!Apollo:Grr...Judge:Very well, Mr. Justice. Keep it short and sweet!Apollo:(Lamiroir wouldn't talk to me the night of the crime. She must know something, and I've got to find out what!)Cross Examination-- What I Saw --Lamiroir:As for what I saw... I saw nothing.PressApollo:Apollo:But you must have seen something! Mr. LeTouse named you!Lamiroir:Mr. LeTouse... ...How can I tell you what I don't know?Apollo:Lamiroir! He said you were a witness with his dying words!Lamiroir:I do not know what he meant to say, but that night...Lamiroir:That night, I was invited to sing on stage, and this I did.PressApollo:Apollo:It... It was a great concert.Lamiroir:You heard me sing? Thank you.Apollo:I was hoping to get an autograph later, actually...Lamiroir:Of course.Judge:Mr. Justice! This is a cross-examination! You're out of line! ...If anyone deserves an autograph here, it's me. One on my gavel would be nice.Klavier:Herr Judge.Judge:Wh-What's this?Klavier:It's my autograph. Now keep this trial moving.Judge:Wh-What!?Judge:Oh, my grandchild will be so happy!Apollo:(Apparently his grandson is a big fan...)Klavier:Let us continue, shall we? If you would, Lamiroir... ...Tell us what you did after your stellar performance.Lamiroir:I did not return backstage after the second set.PressApollo:Apollo:You did not return backstage once? Where were you then? What were you doing?Lamiroir:I was cleaning up on stage. There are many things I must do for a performance other than simply sing.Apollo:And was Machi with you at the time?Lamiroir:Unfortunately, I do not know where he was...Apollo:(So much for an alibi for Machi...)Present BroochApollo:Apollo:I'm sorry Lamiroir, but I'm having trouble believing you.Lamiroir:......Apollo:You remember this brooch, do you not?Klavier:Why that's Lamiroir's. She was wearing it for her song.Apollo:...Care to add that to the testimony, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:Wh-What...?Apollo:This brooch was found after the murder took place. ...At the very scene of the crime!Klavier:What...!?Apollo:...Lamiroir. How did your brooch get backstage if you did not go there yourself? And, as Prosecutor Gavin has just told us... ...you had been wearing it during your performance that night!Lamiroir:...!Judge:What is the meaning of this? Lamiroir, please explain!Lamiroir:......Apollo:Lamiroir...?Lamiroir:............ [Foreign text]....Klavier:...She says, \"English is quite difficult.\"Apollo:That trick's not going to work here!Lamiroir:[Foreign text]....Klavier:\"Your forehead may be large, but you are a lawyer, truly. But... you have missed one important fact.\"Apollo:What now?Lamiroir:[Foreign text]....Klavier:\"In fact, at the time of the incident... ...I went backstage, but only for a moment.\"Apollo:Wh-Whaat!?Lamiroir:[Foreign text]....Klavier:\"Think back to the moment of the crime. You know whereof I speak.\"Apollo:(Is she really saying all that?)Trucy:What's she talking about, Apollo?Apollo:Right when the incident occurred... Ah! (Is she talking about that!?)Ema:Watch this room for me. I have to call for backup!Apollo:R-Right, understood. You want me to make sure no one comes in, right? Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?LeTouse:...Cold...so cold... Witness...Apollo:You're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!LeTouse:The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...Apollo:(...\"Siren\"? How can a siren witness anything...?) Yipes! Ema!? (What was that!?) Wh-Who's there!?Ema:What's wrong?Apollo:Ema! Did you see anyone just now!?Ema:Huh? No...Apollo:(I could have sworn I heard a door close...)Lamiroir:I... looked into the room. Just a glance, mind you.Klavier:So this was when your brooch dropped? That explains that.Lamiroir:It does. There was no other time I could have dropped it.Apollo:But that's ridiculous! You only looked in for an instant, but you dropped your brooch?Klavier:...Herr Forehead.Apollo:!Klavier:She has raised a possibility. The only thing that can counter that... is evidence.Judge:Hmm... So she looked in at the crime scene.Lamiroir:Actually, I intended to go into the dressing room. I knew nothing of what had happened, of course. But the moment I opened the door, I heard a horrible voice.Klavier:Herr Forehead shouting, \"Who's there!\" no doubt. A horrible voice indeed...Apollo:Ugh...Lamiroir:I closed the door immediately.Judge:Well, that explains the brooch. Let's return to your testimony.Apollo:(That's too convenient... She's hiding something!) Lamiroir! You did look into the room though, right?Lamiroir:Y-Yes...Apollo:Testify as to what you saw!Lamiroir:Very well. Though it was only the briefest of glimpses...Changes statement from \"I did not return backstage after the second set.\" to \"When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\"Adds statement \"I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall.\"Lamiroir:When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...PressApollo:Apollo:What did you see in that brief glimpse?Lamiroir:I had only opened the door slightly when I heard that horrible voice...Judge:...And shut the door.Klavier:I have always wondered, Herr Forehead. Does that voice of yours lack a volume knob?Apollo:(It's my Chords of Steel, man. Just back off!)Lamiroir:I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall.PressApollo:Apollo:A wall...? Was there a wall there?Lamiroir:\"[Foreign text]\" is what in English?Klavier:A \"division\" or \"partition\", I believe. It was a large dressing room, divided into two halves.Apollo:(And the murder took place in the inside half. I guess that partition might have hidden the body...)Perceive swallowing on \"The late Mr. LeTouse's body\"Apollo:Apollo:\"The late Mr. LeTouse's body\", you say?Lamiroir:Yes...?Apollo:You know something more about Mr. LeTouse's death than you are saying.Lamiroir:What...?Apollo:I could see you trying not to remember... But the effort made you swallow! ...You can't fool my eyes.Lamiroir:! ...It is true. It was so terrible, after all. Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot?Apollo:One moment, Lamiroir.Lamiroir:Yes...?Apollo:What was that you just said? \"Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot?\"Lamiroir:Yes...?Apollo:(She was hiding something, I knew it!) Lamiroir, I'm afraid you haven't realized it, but... ...your words just now contradict your testimony!Lamiroir:Eh? How could that be!?Apollo:(...Take this! Lamiroir contradicted her own testimony, and I have the evidence to prove it!)Present Investigation RequestApollo:Leads to:\"Tell me, Lamiroir...\"Present anything elseApollo:Lamiroir:If I do not misunderstand the meaning of \"contradiction\"... ...it is you who contradict, Mr. Justice.Apollo:Huh?Lamiroir:Your evidence... is meaningless.Apollo:(Ack! Wrong evidence! Gotta think this over... What did she say again? \"Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot\"? That's right... That totally contradicts her testimony!)Leads back to:\"...Take this!\"Apollo:Tell me, Lamiroir... How did you know he had been shot?Lamiroir:Eh. Well, I...Apollo:Immediately following the incident, a gag order was placed on the scene. This is the document proving that. In your testimony, you told the court... \"No one told me anything about the incident.\"Lamiroir:Ah...Apollo:Furthermore, you testified that you had \"seen nothing\".Lamiroir:...!Apollo:Yet you knew that Mr. LeTouse had been shot! How could you have known!?Lamiroir:...! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooooowrk!Judge:Lamiroir! You aren't hiding something from this court, I hope!Lamiroir:......Apollo:(That sweet song of hers was sounding a little too sweet!)Lamiroir:Ah, now I remember. Please... allow me to add to my testimony.Klavier:...Of course. All we want to know... is the truth.Trucy:She looks kind of pale, huh?Apollo:She saw something, I know it. Even the victim said so!Changes statement from \"I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall.\" to \"I saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot...\"Lamiroir:I saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot...PressApollo:Apollo:Only a glimpse, yet you knew they were bullet holes?Lamiroir:Yes. I recognized them immediately. I have seen bullet holes before, you know.Klavier:You have traveled the world as a singer... You must have sung in places far more dangerous than our country.Lamiroir:I go wherever my voice is needed. Those places... are many, these days.Trucy:That's really cool! I hope I get to travel like Lamiroir some day.Klavier:I plan on recording my next album overseas. Their studios have a different sound, you know.Apollo:(Hmm. Maybe I should go on a Chords of Steel tour, too.)Present DiagramApollo:Leads to:\"Lamiroir. They call you the Siren of the Ballad...\"Lamiroir:Then I was led by the police to Mr. Gavin's dressing room, and told to wait there.PressApollo:Apollo:With Machi, correct? How was he then?Lamiroir:He seemed as he always does. Though I believe he was shocked by the news of Mr. LeTouse's death. Yet... He is not the type to show much emotion.Klavier:Yes. He's given the police no end of headaches. He answers most questions with silence... and those glinting frames speak nothing. The questioning hasn't gotten very far.Lamiroir:We sat there, waiting...Lamiroir:That was where I learned that something had happened... But I wasn't told the details.PressApollo:Apollo:How was the incident explained to you?Lamiroir:I was told nothing in detail. Only that Mr. LeTouse died.Judge:Of course, investigations require some security.Lamiroir:But Mr. LeTouse was my manager! I wanted to know more. I should have been told. Both Machi and I were beside ourselves with concern.Klavier:...Allow me to apologize. But please understand... ...keeping you in the dark was as painful for me as it was for you.Lamiroir:Yes, I understand.Apollo:(Think, what doesn't ring true about her testimony?)Trucy:...It's hard to imagine Lamiroir lying...Apollo:She might not be lying, but she's hiding something... (What wouldn't she tell me the night of the murder?)Apollo:Lamiroir. They call you the Siren of the Ballad... ...but lies are hardly becoming of such a creature.Judge:...A put-down worthy of our prosecutor, Mr. Justice.Trucy:...Such put-downs are hardly becoming of you, Apollo.Klavier:...Stop polishing your forehead and start polishing your character, ja?Apollo:(C'mon, can't I be cool for once!?) Observe the diagram! Lamiroir, you looked in from the door for just a moment. Correct?Lamiroir:Y-Yes, that is so.Apollo:There were bullet holes in the room, yes. But they were in the wall the door is on!Lamiroir:Eh...Apollo:You see? Assuming you merely glanced into the room... ...you couldn't have seen those bullet holes!Lamiroir:Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeooowrk!Judge:...... Lamiroir.Lamiroir:...Yes.Judge:I'm afraid the defense has raised a good point. It appears you have been holding back something.Lamiroir:...And I must tell you? I must tell you what it is that I saw?Judge:Yes. The happenings in this trial are being recorded. And I'm certain it will be on the news in Borginia. You understand your reputation is at stake. It falls to you to avoid tarnishing it.Klavier:Personally speaking... I still believe that cross-examining her will yield us absolutely nothing.Apollo:But she knew how Mr. LeTouse died! And he named her as a witness! You must have seen something, Lamiroir!Judge:...Very well. Lamiroir... Please continue your testimony.Lamiroir:... Very well, I shall.Witness Testimony-- What I Saw 2 --Lamiroir:I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.There was something like a little window there... That's how I saw it.There were two shots... I couldn't do anything to stop it.But it wasn't Machi!It was a grown person! ...I know it was!Judge:So you did witness the crime! And the killer was... a grown person, you say?Klavier:Ach. This is my first time hearing this, I assure you. Nice play, Herr Forehead.Apollo:......Judge:Very well, Herr... er, Mr. Justice. You may begin your cross-examination!Trucy:Great going, Apollo! You were right about Lamiroir. ...What's wrong? You don't look too happy.Apollo:(This whole thing smells fishy... That's what's wrong.)Trucy:...?Cross Examination-- What I Saw 2 --Lamiroir:I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.PressApollo:Apollo:So you were heading toward the dressing room?Lamiroir:Yes.Apollo:(So this is a little before she opened the dressing room door and dropped her brooch. ...About the same time Ema and I heard those shots.)Lamiroir:I was on my way back...Lamiroir:There was something like a little window there... That's how I saw it.PressApollo:Apollo:Um, what exactly is something like a little window?Lamiroir:Yes, well... \"Window\" is the best word I know in English. I think this is how it is said, yes.Klavier:You need not worry, Lamiroir. Your choice of words is impeccable. There is a small window in the dressing room in question. Perhaps the defense remembers this detail?Apollo:(That little window on the wall...)Lamiroir:I, er, saw the crime from there.Lamiroir:There were two shots... I couldn't do anything to stop it.PressApollo:Apollo:You are certain you heard two shots fired?Lamiroir:Yes, quite certain. I was on my way to the backstage exit. This was when I heard a faint sound... like a gunshot. Wondering what it had been, I peered through the window. That is when I heard the second gunshot, much closer.Apollo:(And there were two bullet holes at the scene... no contradictions so far.)Lamiroir:...It all happened on the other side of that window. There was nothing I could do.Lamiroir:But it wasn't Machi!PressApollo:Apollo:It wasn't Machi who shot... Are you sure?Lamiroir:Yes, quite certain.Klavier:Ah ha ha... It amuses me that you would question her testimony. It is testimony in your favor! Isn't it my job to object?Trucy:Yeah, Apollo, what were you thinking!?Apollo:Trucy... Let's just listen to what Lamiroir has to say. Can you tell me how you were so sure?Lamiroir:Yes, of course. You see...Lamiroir:It was a grown person! ...I know it was!PressApollo:Leads to:\"A \"grown person\"... That's a little vague.\"Trucy:You can't ask for a better testimony than that!Apollo:I'm not so sure it's all that simple, Trucy. (There's a critical flaw in this testimony... And I have to point it out, even if it isn't good for our case...)Apollo:A \"grown person\"... That's a little vague.Lamiroir:I am sorry. My skill with your language is... lacking, I know.Judge:Certainly you could at least see whether the shooter was male or female?Lamiroir:...... It was a man. A young man.Judge:And you're sure of that?Lamiroir:Yes, his voice was quite clear.Apollo:Voice...?Judge:Hmm... Looking at this diagram, it seems the dressing room was quite cluttered. It does seem likely that you wouldn't have had a clear view of the shooter.Lamiroir:As a singer, I rely more on my ears than my eyes. When I hear a voice, I do not forget it. That voice... was the voice of a man.Klavier:So you heard a voice. But wait... ...Couldn't that have been the victim, Mr. LeTouse?Lamiroir:Absolutely not. Did I not just say that I do not forget a voice? If it was Mr. LeTouse who spoke, I would have known.Judge:Hmm... Indeed. So you were at the window, and you heard the shooter's voice, the voice of a young man.Trucy:Apollo! This is a good testimony! That proves it wasn't Machi!Apollo:......Judge:Indeed... If this turns out to be true, it would cast this case in a considerably different light. What is the defense's opinion of this testimony...?It's pretty goodApollo:...Well, I'd have to say it's pretty good. Vital, even. This shows that the shooter wasn't Machi...Klavier:Hah!Apollo:...!Klavier:Surely you can't be serious, Herr Forehead.Apollo:Wh-Why not!?Leads to:\"Lamiroir.\"It's contradictoryApollo:Though it pains me to say this... ...There's something about Lamiroir's testimony that rings false.Lamiroir:...!Klavier:Heh. Bravo, Herr Forehead. You're colder than I thought.Apollo:(I'm sure you remember what the problem is as well as I do, Gavin.) As has been established... No grown man could pass through that air vent. He couldn't have fled the scene of the crime.Lamiroir:......Trucy:B-But that means Lamiroir has to be lying!Apollo:I know, and I know it's bad for our case, but I can't shut my eyes to this. (Believe me, the idea was tempting...)Klavier:It is as Herr Forehead says. Yet, this is not the only contradiction within her testimony.Apollo:Wh-What next!? (What's he talking about?)Leads to:\"Lamiroir.\"Klavier:Lamiroir. I understand why you would want to protect Machi. Yet remember, you are the Siren of the Ballad... ...And lies do not become such a creature.Judge:What does the prosecution mean!?Trucy:Apollo! What's he talking about!?Apollo:(How come no one bats an eye when he says stuff like that?)Klavier:I recall the state of the crime scene quite well.Apollo:The state of the room...?Klavier:Yes, and when the murder took place... ...that window was closed. I find it hard to believe you could hear a voice through it.Lamiroir:What!? B-But I... I'm sure...Klavier:...Lamiroir. I have nothing but the highest regard for your musical sense. ...But my opinion of you as a witness is somewhat lesser.Apollo:Apollo:B-But she's the only eye-witness we have!Klavier:Klavier:So you say. And the victim named her, the \"Siren\" as the witness?Apollo:Th-That's right! That's what Mr. LeTouse...Klavier:We heard your claim. We even entertained the possibility. And it brought us to this. Herr Judge!Judge:Yes?Klavier:The prosecution requests that the witness... be excused. Please.Judge:Hmm... I'm afraid I must honor the prosecution's request. There is indeed a question of the witness's credibility.Apollo:B-But if Lamiroir can't testify...Trucy:Then we don't have a chance of proving Machi's innocence.Judge:This cross-examination is over! ...Prosecutor Gavin. You may continue making your case.Klavier:...Danke. Now where were we? Ah yes, I would like to hear from Fr\u00e4ulein Detective again.Apollo:Apollo:Wait! Let me hear Lamiroir's testimony one last time...Judge:But the cross-examination is already over. Until such a time as a need arises... ...this witness may leave the stand.Lamiroir:...... I'm sorry I could not be of more assistance.Klavier:......Klavier:At last, back to the real trial. Ready, Herr Forehead?Apollo:(Grr... I hope I didn't just miss my only chance.)Klavier:Fr\u00e4ulein Detective, how far had we gotten until we were so rudely interrupted?Ema:Don't ask me!Klavier:I dislike saying the same thing twice. And I never repeat a song for an encore.Judge:...If you would, Ms. Skye.Ema:...Hmph. I believe I was saying that the only way Mr. LeTouse's killer could have escaped... ...was through that air vent on the ceiling.Judge:Ah, yes, there was only one door in the room. And a witness, you, was standing in front of it.Ema:That air vent isn't very big, see. Kind of limits the people who could possibly get through.Judge:I certainly would have a difficult time.Ema:You sure would. Not that you would have been there in the first place, though. Remember, the whole backstage area was off-limits to people not involved with the concert. The only one who meets the conditions for our killer... is the defendant.Klavier:...A virtuoso performance! I couldn't have put it better myself.Judge:Hmm. She does state a clear case. Though, reading the report, something caught my eye.Klavier:Oh? What's that?Judge:The circumstances of the defendant's arrest.Apollo:The circumstances...? (Again...?)Trucy:Hey, that's right, Apollo! Remember when we found Machi? That was bizarre!Apollo:(She's right... Why did Mr. LeTouse's body disappear from the room... ...and end up on top of that stage tower? ...Holding a guitar, no less.)Klavier:...A perceptive observation, Herr Judge.Judge:Ah, er, thanks! It was kind of an accident, really. But you work in this job long enough... ...you get a nose for things. Eh he he.Trucy:The judge sure seems pleased with himself!Klavier:Very good, Fr\u00e4ulein Detective. Perhaps you can tie it all together for us. Why was the body moved? And how does that lead us to the killer!?Witness Testimony-- The Missing Body --Ema:I believe Machi stole the body because of some lyrics.He moved the body to match Lamiroir's song.No one in this country had a motive to kill the victim.And, Machi practically left his signature at the scene.All of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.Apollo:Lamiroir's... song?Klavier:Yes... \"The Guitar's Serenade\". You noticed its \"code\" too, did you not?Apollo:Its \"code\"...?Klavier:All the events that day followed the lyrics to our song. First, the keys my \"heart\" held on to so tightly were stolen.Apollo:Then Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flames on stage. Mr. LeTouse's life was taken by a bullet...Klavier:The rest hardly needs explanation... \"Guitar, Guitar... Up together to the sky.\"Judge:Th-That's mad! It's like a story out of some fairy tale!Apollo:(I admit, I'd forgotten about the song... But there it is now, waiting for me... the grand finale, as it were.)Trucy:Hey! You know I was the one who first noticed that!Judge:I've heard of jumping rope to songs, and counting to songs... ...But killing!?Klavier:It's a wild world out there, Herr Judge.Judge:Very well! We've heard one song and dance, let's get on to the next: the cross-examination!Apollo:(I'm not so sure I'm going to be doing much singing...)Cross Examination-- The Missing Body --Ema:I believe Machi stole the body because of some lyrics.PressApollo:Apollo:Who would steal a body just to match some lyrics!?Ema:I didn't believe it myself. But it can't just be a coincidence.Klavier:It is as Fr\u00e4ulein Detective says. Let us begin with the first verse. If you would, Fr\u00e4ulein Detective.Ema:What? You want me to sing it?Klavier:You are the witness, ja? Or did you want me to sing? I warn you, my fee as vocalist is not trivial.Ema:Fine, fine! Er, ahem. Let's look at the first part of the lyrics, shall we? \"When you stole away the keys my heart held on to so tight.\"Klavier:Indeed, my favorite heart-shaped key ring was stolen that morning.Ema:Next, we go to the right page of the lyrics sheet. Where we find... \"Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away. All away.\" As we know, Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flame. \"Like a bullet of love. Fire. Take my life away. All away.\" Mr. LeTouse's life was taken by a bullet.Klavier:Bravo, Fr\u00e4ulein Detective. Your singing... it's not bad. Now, for the finale! \"Guitar, Guitar... Up together to the sky.\" As it says in the lyrics, Mr. LeTouse... ...was found with a guitar, high in the \"sky\" over the stage. No series of coincidences could be so well conceived!Ema:He's right. ...Scientifically speaking.Apollo:(What would Wocky have said? ...\"That concert was wack.\")Trucy:It's hard to argue when she pours her heart into it like that.Ema:Ah, er, ahem! Anyway, the shooter...Ema:He moved the body to match Lamiroir's song.PressApollo:Apollo:Does the prosecution have any idea why he'd do all this?Ema:You want my scientific opinion? \"No clue.\" But, he clearly had a reason to go through all that trouble. Some deep reason.Apollo:A deep reason?Klavier:Not only did he steal my keys, he torched my guitar! ...Unforgivable acts even if he had a reason... and worse if he had none!Ema:The diva's complaints aside, I can't imagine someone doing this on \"just a whim\".Klavier:Fr\u00e4ulein Detective! I take offense at that description...Judge:Indeed, it does seem too well rehearsed, shall we say.Ema:Yes. This crime was planned for sure.Ema:No one in this country had a motive to kill the victim.PressApollo:Apollo:But... Mr. LeTouse spoke English! He may have come to this country before!Ema:I looked into that, I assure you.Apollo:Oh.Ema:...It was his first time in the country, it seems. Apparently, he learned English on his own.Apollo:(Great...)Klavier:You see? No one here had a motive to kill him, and certainly not in such an elaborate fashion.Judge:Hmm... It does seem difficult to imagine.Ema:Unless our famous prosecutor did it as a publicity stunt.Klavier:Wh-What did you say!?Judge:Prosecutor Gavin! You did this to promote your song!?Klavier:...... Of course not, and I am quite dismayed by the ludicrous nature of her claim. Why would I need promotion? Everyone already listens to my music.Trucy:They're even in my textbook at school.Apollo:(And I'd never heard of them. What does that say about me?)Ema:I was just kidding! Don't get all worked up, glimmer-boy.Ema:And, Machi practically left his signature at the scene.PressApollo:Apollo:What do you mean by his \"signature\"?Ema:The bullet holes in the wall, of course.Apollo:The bullet holes...?Ema:The revolver was fired twice. One shot missed, and left a hole in the wall.Judge:And that means what, exactly?Ema:That dressing room isn't exactly spacious. Picture the shooter facing off with the victim in there. They can't have been more than five feet apart. It would be difficult, almost impossible to miss at that range.Judge:Difficult to miss, you say?Ema:Very. Assuming the shooter could properly aim.Apollo:No! Y-You can't be serious...Trucy:Machi! He can't see... ...That's why he missed?Ema:It's the only explanation that makes sense. He used sound and other senses to fire the gun... ...poorly.Klavier:That reminds me, the monitor in that room was blaring at the time, ja? Hardly ideal conditions for tracking by sound.Judge:A blind shooter... No wonder he missed!Apollo:(I knew those bullet holes would come back to haunt me. Think Justice, what do I do now!?)Raise an objectionApollo:Sure, there were bullet holes left in the wall... ...but that doesn't prove the shooter couldn't see!Klavier:Oh? How so?Apollo:Well, there could have been a struggle with the victim.Judge:Hmm, that's certainly possible.Apollo:And... it might have been the revolver's fault.Judge:The revolver...?Apollo:The revolver was a very large caliber, correct?Judge:If the shooter wasn't used to firing such a large weapon... Why, it could dislocate their shoulder.Apollo:...Exactly. The defendant, Machi Tobaye, is, as you can see, tiny. It's not so hard to picture him firing the gun and missing entirely! The kickback alone would throw off his aim.Judge:......Klavier:......Ema:......Judge:A convincing argument, to be sure.Apollo:(Ha ha! Take that, smug prosecution!)Trucy:Um, Apollo?Apollo:Huh? What?Trucy:That bit about Machi being tiny... ...and the gun throwing off his aim? Um, aren't you kind of, um... ...admitting that he did it?Apollo:......Oh.Klavier:It does not matter why he missed. What matters is that the shooter was, without a doubt, the defendant. Even the defense seems to agree on that point.Apollo:Yurk! Uhh... (Cripes! I really put my foot in it this time!)Klavier:But, let's get the facts of the matter on the record. If you would, Fr\u00e4ulein Detective.Judge:Very well. The witness will add this to her testimony.Ema:Right.Changes statement from \"All of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.\" to \"From the state of the crime scene, I conclude the shooter was blind.\"Sit back and watchApollo:(He couldn't see, so the first shot missed... ...As explanations go, it's airtight.)Judge:Hmm... It appears the shooter did leave his signature. I'm afraid this is looking bad for our young defendant. The witness may continue with her testimony.Ema:You got it.Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement)Apollo:By \"signature\", you mean the bullet holes in the wall?Ema:That's right. Allow me to explain it... scientifically. The murder weapon was fired twice. The shot that missed left a hole in the wall. Furthermore, there was no more than five feet between shooter and victim. Hard to miss at that distance.Trucy:But, Machi can't see...Ema:He would have had to use sound and other senses to aim... ...and miss.Klavier:And our music was blaring over the room monitor. Not the best circumstances for aiming by sound.Ema:Which makes it very likely that the shooter was blind.Klavier:Thus the prosecution's position.Ema:Ahh! Nothing like a scientific explanation to get the blood pumping!Apollo:(Why's mine frozen in my veins, then...?)Ema:All of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.PressApollo:Apollo:But, but you can't say that for sure!Ema:Please, none of those non-scientific objections. They're bad for my complexion.Apollo:What's so scientific about a murder to lyrics!?Ema:Lyrics can be explained scientifically! ...Never underestimate the power of science!Apollo:(Put that bottle of finger-printing powder down before you hurt someone, like me!) OK, then explain it! Scientifically!Ema:...... I require more data.Apollo:(Hah! Likely story...)Ema:From the state of the crime scene, I conclude the shooter was blind.PressApollo:Apollo:You can't say he was blind just because of those bullet holes in the wall! I think I've proven that!Ema:...I wouldn't call it \"proof\", per se.Apollo:Huh?Klavier:You've merely raised a \"possibility\".Apollo:...!Klavier:Fr\u00e4ulein Detective has made a most logical conjecture based upon the evidence. Of course, there is more evidence than just bullet holes. The defendant was the only one who could have escaped through the air vent.Apollo:Apollo:But wait! If he was blind... ...how would he know about the air vent in the first place?Klavier:...Ah, a very good point. Well, Fr\u00e4ulein Detective? If you would care to explain?Apollo:(He certainly seems sure of himself...)Ema:Recall the crime scene, if you would. There was a stepladder below the air vent. As it happens, maintenance was scheduled for that day. Custodial staff went around checking all the air vents.Apollo:I don't believe it.Ema:Everyone backstage was told about the maintenance. ...Including Machi Tobaye. He would have known that there would be a way out at the top of that stepladder.Apollo:But that's... Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this!?Klavier:You could have figured it out for yourself. You only needed to consider what that stepladder was doing there.Judge:...Looks like the defense's objection has been squished by a stepladder.Klavier:Well, Herr Forehead? Out of ammunition, perhaps?Apollo:(I've never seen Prosecutor Gavin so... so aggressive! Maybe he's caught the scent of blood...)Trucy:Apollo! Don't you have something? Anything? You know what we need... We need something to prove the killer could see! That'll put him in his place!Klavier:......Apollo:(Proving the shooter was sighted would do it. That would take down one of their central points... Do I have any evidence that can prove that though...?)Present evidenceApollo:Fine... I accept the prosecution's challenge.Klavier:As I knew you would, Herr Forehead.Apollo:(What exactly am I up against here...? The prosecution is saying the shooter missed because he or she couldn't see... Therefore, Machi, who's blind, did it.)Judge:The defense will please present their evidence. ...Evidence that overturns the prosecution's claim that the shooter couldn't see!Present Crime PhotoApollo:Leads to:\"This is that evidence!\"Present anything elseApollo:Judge:...... I'm not sure that overturns anything, Mr. Justice.Apollo:(Ugh. Wrong evidence, I'm guessing...)Klavier:Apparently both love... and Justice are blind.Apollo:(I have to think! There must be something... anything!)Leads back to cross-examinationNo needApollo:(I can't think of anything that proves the shooter could see!)Klavier:Your face does not exactly project... confidence.Ema:Maybe you should just accept it and move on?Trucy:Apollo! Grow a backbone!Judge:Very well. The witness may continue her testimony.Apollo:(I couldn't even get a word in edgewise...)Leads back to cross-examinationPresent Crime PhotoApollo:Apollo:The prosecution holds that the \"shooter couldn't see\".Ema:A scientific conclusion based on a thorough examination of the crime scene, yes.Apollo:Apparently not thorough enough. I have a certain piece of evidence that completely overturns your claim!Ema:Wh-What!?Klavier:......Leads to:\"This is that evidence!\"Trucy:This doesn't look so good, does it, Apollo?Apollo:No, it doesn't.Trucy:...... What do we do!?Apollo:(First, we don't panic. Even though Machi's case is leaking water by the gallon. Gavin's on a roll, and it's up to me to stop him!)Apollo:This is that evidence!Judge:The photograph of the crime scene...?Apollo:(I don't care much for the smirk on Prosecutor Gavin's face... But this is no time to think twice... Time to press on!) Yes, Your Honor, the crime scene. There is something in here that decisively contradicts the prosecution's point!Klavier:Then perhaps you'd best show us this \"something\". Get your finger out of the breeze and put it to good use, ja?Judge:Very well, show us what you're talking about, Mr. Justice! The contradiction at the scene of the crime is...Present smeared bloodApollo:Leads to:\"The contradiction is right here!\"Present anywhere elseApollo:Apollo:Look! The contradiction's right there! Plain as day!Judge:...... Your finger has a force of weight... ...that I'm afraid your argument lacks, Mr. Justice. I see nothing!Apollo:(Ugh... What a time to mess up.)Klavier:I believe all he has added to our understanding of this photo... is his fingerprint. I would hope you could refrain from soiling the evidence, Herr Forehead.Judge:Perhaps Mr. Justice would care to try again?Leads back to:\"The contradiction at the scene of the crime is...\"Apollo:The contradiction is right here!Ema:The smeared blood stains...!Judge:Hmm... I thought it was just my blurry vision. But it really was blurry! The way the victim's hand is raised above his head... ...Much like a gesture I have seen many times in this court.Ema:It's almost as if he wrote something...?Trucy:Ah ha! I get it! At least, I think I get it!Klavier:Get what, Fr\u00e4ulein?Trucy:When Mr. LeTouse was shot, he tried to write something! And what would he write but the shooter's name? And what would he write it in but his own blood? Pretty good, huh?Apollo:(Thanks for making my point for me...) Yes, in fact, that's what I think happened here.Judge:Hmm... That does seem to be a distinct possibility.Ema:The victim wrote the killer's name... ...It's certainly a logical conclusion.Trucy:Drat! I just wish it wasn't all rubbed out like that.Judge:Of course it's rubbed out. Why, if I were a killer... ...I certainly wouldn't want to leave my own name behind!Klavier:Neither would I.Ema:......Klavier:......Judge:......Apollo:Um... No one has anything else to say?Judge:...About what?Apollo:So the prosecution accepts this? You agree this was the victim making an attempt to record the name of the killer? ...And that the killer tried to rub the name out?Ema:What's your point?Apollo:What's my point!? Let me ask you this: How did the killer know the victim was writing their name?Ema:Well, Mr. LeTouse was writing something in blood. Once the killer saw what it was... ...Wait.Judge:Once he \"saw\" what it was...?Apollo:But what did you just testify about the shooter?Ema:I said... they were blind. Ack!!!Apollo:Yet the crime scene itself contradicts that! The killer had to have been able to see! Why would they rub out the name in blood otherwise?Ema:Ah... ahh...Apollo:May I remind the court that the defendant, Machi Tobaye, is blind! He couldn't have been the shooter!Ema:Urk... Immmmmmmmposssssibbleee!Judge:Order! Order! Order!!! P-Prosecutor Gavin! Please explain to me what all this means!?Klavier:......Judge:I mean, looking at this photo... It seems quite clear that the shooter could see! Yet, up until now...Klavier:...It seems I owe the court an apology.Judge:Hmm!?Klavier:The Gavinners are a band with law enforcement ties, yet a murder occurred... ...during our concert! Apparently, this caused some confusion over jurisdiction. As a result, some reports were not filed in an entirely timely manner.Apollo:(I... I'm not sure I like the vibe I'm getting here.)Trucy:Hey Apollo, look at him. Why is Prosecutor Gavin all relaxed and smiling like that? Like he knows something we don't... and he's about to tell us.Klavier:Heh heh heh. I've got an idea... Let's rock! ...With these documents. But before that. I have a question for the Fr\u00e4ulein Detective. If I may?Ema:Wh-What?Klavier:Tell me... Why do you think that Machi Tobaye is blind?Ema:Huh...?Apollo:Wh-What did he say?Ema:What are you saying? Of course he's blind!Klavier:Of course...?Ema:H-He's the blind pianist, right? So... So he's... Doesn't Lamiroir lead him around by the hand all the time?Apollo:(No way...)Klavier:I have a report here on the defendant, Machi Tobaye. According to this, Machi Tobaye... ...can see perfectly well.Ema:What...?Klavier:His blindness was merely a publicity ploy by those clever Borginians. He can see quite well.Apollo:Apollo:B-But you said...Klavier:...What did I say, exactly?Apollo:!Klavier:Herr Forehead, not once in the course of this trial... ...have I claimed the defendant was blind. The only one who did was Fr\u00e4ulein Detective.Apollo:Bu-But that's...Klavier:...A significant fact, yes! Consider: Machi Tobaye sees. And he was the only one who could have fled through the air vent. I see no problems with this.Ema:But what about the bullet holes in the wall?Klavier:Yes, the bullet holes. I believe Herr Forehead neatly explained those for us. He didn't miss because he couldn't see. It was the kickback from the 45-caliber revolver. A simple accident, in other words.Apollo:Ack...!Klavier:How's that? I'm afraid your \"objection\" has just flown off for brighter skies...Apollo:Urk...Klavier:This is where the real fun begins, Herr Forehead!Apollo:Yeeeeaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrggh!Klavier:I knew you didn't have what it took.Ema:You... You jerk! Just what was I in here for? Comic relief!?Trucy:Yeah! Apologize!Klavier:Ah ha ha. Oh, sorry!Trucy:That's no way to apologize!Apollo:(He's angered the Trucy now. Look out...)Judge:Ahem. If we can please end the bickering. Now.Ema:Whatever! I'm not leaving! I can't leave like this. I'll come up with some clue to solving this case if it kills me!Judge:But your testimony has already given us enough to convict the defendant...Apollo:(Ugh, don't say that...)Ema:Ah! Ah ha!Apollo:\"Ah ha\" what?Ema:This blood stain... The criminal tried to wipe it off, right?Apollo:That seems to be what happened, yes.Ema:We might be able to find out what was really written here!Apollo:...! Really...? You can do that?Ema:That's right, with this! It's called Luminol! Maybe you know of it? It's a chemical that reacts to blood.Klavier:Ah yes, have we done those tests yet...?Ema:Hah! As if I'm going to tell you!Klavier:The blood stains covered a section of the carpet. In order to perform blood tests, that section was removed and submitted. Perhaps we should request it here in court now.Ema:Right! Go for it, Apollo!Apollo:Huh? I have to do the test?Ema:You just have to spray the luminol on it! Simple!Apollo:(A chemical that reacts to blood... I've heard of this somewhere.)Judge:...Yes, I believe an analysis is called for. Have at it!Ema:Right, ready? It's easy as pie! Just press [A / Space] to spray an area. (Changed from [Just touch the screen to spray an area.] in the original release) Here! Give it a try!Apollo:(...The eyes of the entire court are focused on me!)Trucy:Apollo! Your hand's shaking!Apollo:(Ugh... Grrrah! Let's do this!)Spray smeared writingLeads to:\"Wow... it really works!\"Apollo:(Wow... it really works!)Trucy:This must be... this must be the power of science!Ema:It says... \"IPXX314206\"... ...Is that the killer's name?Judge:Hmm. Maybe it is... if the killer was a robot!Klavier:Ah hah! I have it!Apollo:...So what is it?Klavier:I thought those letters \"IPXX\" looked familiar. This is an Interpol ID number.Ema:I-Interpol? You mean the international police agency?Klavier:Yes. Most are undercover agents working to solve international crimes. But why would he write that number...?Apollo:Why would Mr. LeTouse even know a number like that!?Klavier:Good show, Fr\u00e4ulein Detective. Rock on.Ema:Eh?Klavier:Your Honor! We can verify this number immediately. ...Daryan, are you there? Come up to the witness stand!Klavier:Daryan... you heard what we need. Go check into this Interpol ID number.Daryan:Sure thing. Gimme 30 minutes. No... Gimme 27.Judge:Hmm... I'm not sure what to think of all this. The prosecution's case is airtight, or so it seems. Yet if this number is really that of an Interpol agent...Ema:Oh, wait, I know... What if Machi Tobaye's really an undercover Interpol agent?Klavier:That would be a possibility.Judge:A possibility, yes. And one that would mark him as the killer for certain.Apollo:(Why did LeTouse know an Interpol ID number...? That's what I want to know.)Klavier:Well, we have some time while we await Daryan's report. Let's work on unraveling another mystery, shall we? A curious mystery concerning Machi Tobaye.Apollo:...What are you talking about?Klavier:Fr\u00e4ulein Detective, please accept my apologies. I received word that the defendant could, in fact, see, just before the trial began. It seemed too much of a bother to tell you.Ema:...You had me until that last bit.Klavier:Does this not raise a rather straightforward question?Ema:Well, sure... Why did Machi pretend he couldn't see?Klavier:Exactly... It makes little sense. What do you think, Herr Forehead?Apollo:Huh? Me?Klavier:Machi Tobaye pretended he was blind... ...Do you know why?Ema:How could he know!?Trucy:Wait... Prosecutor Gavin knows why, doesn't he...Apollo:(He's known from the start of the trial. He's been leading us on the whole time!)Klavier:Hmm? Something wrong? Do you think, perhaps, this is all some kind of game? Know that the moment I heard that report... ...I knew why.Judge:Hmm... I suppose people who have sold over a million records really are something else.Apollo:(What does that have to do with anything!?)Klavier:There was a reason why Machi Tobaye pretended to be blind. But it wasn't for his own sake. ...Getting the picture now?Apollo:It wasn't for himself...!?Judge:Well, Mr. Justice? Can you present evidence that shows us why the defendant had to feign blindness?Show evidenceApollo:(Machi had no reason to pretend he couldn't see... Which means... No. It couldn't be!)Klavier:...Good show, Herr Forehead. It seems you've thought of something.Apollo:(Grr... Why can't I figure these things out on my own? I hate having to take my cues from this guy.) ...Very well. Look at this. This is why he was pretending he couldn't see!Present PostcardApollo:Judge:That is... Lamiroir?Apollo:Lamiroir and Machi Tobaye. Recall their relationship. In particular, their unique arrangement over the years before visiting our country.Ema:Lamiroir and her pianist... They would always walk together, she leading him by the hand. Even when they got on stage, she would lead him to the piano. She would walk all the way over there with him!Apollo:That's right. Because he was \"blind\". She led him at all times, never letting him go.Judge:All times... Hmm.Apollo:Yet, we have just learned something that makes their arrangement peculiar indeed. Machi could see! Why did they have to keep up this act the whole time?Judge:Well, wasn't it part of their, er, performance?Apollo:I think there's a simpler explanation. Machi did not need to be led by the hand at all. That can only mean one thing.Ema:Ah! Aaaaaaaaaaa... Really!?Apollo:Really. It was all the other way around. The one who needed to be led by the hand... ...was Lamiroir!Judge:Wh-What's this...? S-So you mean to say that Lamiroir is... she's...Apollo:Yes, Your Honor. Lamiroir is blind.Ema:Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge:Order! Order! Order!!! This is crazy, Prosecutor Gavin!Klavier:Is it now?Judge:Please... Please shed some sanity on this madness! The defense has made an outrageous claim...Klavier:The only thing outrageous I see about the defense is his vast forehead... ...Yet I see it is not vast in vain. This time. He's quite correct.Judge:B-But that makes no sense!Leads to:\"Yeah! Wasn't she supposed to be the \"landscape painter in sound\" or something?\"Present anything elseApollo:Judge:What... is that supposed to mean? I don't see how it relates to the defendant's vision or lack thereof.Apollo:Well, see, it... (...is the wrong piece of evidence.)Judge:I do see how your lack of an answer relates to this penalty, however!Klavier:Ah ha ha ha. Herr Forehead, I'm disappointed in you. Unless you're merely \"feigning\" stupidity? Ja?Apollo:(Keep it up wise guy...)Klavier:Recall the relationship of Lamiroir and Machi Tobaye. In particular, their arrangement over the years before visiting our country.Ema:Lamiroir and her pianist... They would always walk together, she leading him by the hand.

Why keep up the charade?Judge:Well, wasn't it part of their, er, performance?Klavier:There is a simpler explanation, Herr Judge. Machi did not need to be led by the hand at all. Which means...Apollo:Aaaaah! You don't mean---!?Klavier:I do. It was the other way around! The one who needed to be led by the hand... ...was Lamiroir!Judge:Wh-What's this...?Judge:S-So you mean to say that Lamiroir is... she's...Klavier:Blind as a bat, Herr Judge.Ema:Wha...

I hadn't even imagined it until now!Judge:Bailiff! Bring in Lamiroir!Klavier:...Lamiroir. It pains me deeply to call you before us again in this way. And yet I must.Lamiroir:Please, do not be concerned on my behalf.Apollo:(Those eyes... She really can't see? Really?)Lamiroir:...... It is true.Apollo:...!Lamiroir:How funny it is that a tiny lie born in the Borginian countryside... ...would one day grow to entangle the entire world.Judge:So... So you are...!?Lamiroir:Yes. As I mentioned before... ...I have no memory of the time before I became Lamiroir. Know too that my memories begin in darkness. The word \"light\" has no meaning for Lamiroir.Judge:I see...Klavier:You may recall me saying something toward the beginning of this trial, Herr Forehead.Apollo:...? What's that?Klavier:I believe I said it was unfortunate this crime had no \"direct\" witnesses.Apollo:Ah...Klavier:Now, Lamiroir, I must ask you to stand once more. Will you testify to the court about your eyes?Lamiroir:Of course. It was never my intent to deceive any of you. May I begin, Your Honor?Judge:Uh, yes, yes of course... Though I admit, I'm a little lost here.Apollo:I think we're all a bit lost here, Your Honor.Witness Testimony-- Lamiroir's Eyes --Lamiroir:I have no memory of the \"light\".I debuted in a world of darkness and sound...My producer came up with my PR line before he knew this.So, silly as it may sound, I had to pretend I could see.Everyone on my staff knew, of course, but no others.Judge:But... this is a murder trial!Lamiroir:I apologize. It was part of my contract, you see. I was to keep my blindness a secret, no matter what. Music is everything for me. I never imagined something like this would...Klavier:She told us the truth in the beginning. When she said she \"saw nothing\".Judge:Very well. Does the defense have anything to add?Apollo:...... I'd like to cross-examine.Trucy:But, what is there left to ask!?Apollo:There was one thing in her testimony that bothered me.Klavier:Perhaps it is best we let you get it out of your system. Someday you'll come to understand... ...the importance of thinking for yourself.Judge:Very well. The defense may proceed. However... Be aware this court will not tolerate any questions deemed too stressful to the witness.Apollo:...OK. (There was only one part that bothered me... Just let me ask about that and I'll be happy.)Cross Examination-- Lamiroir's Eyes --Lamiroir:I have no memory of the \"light\".PressApollo:Apollo:So, you don't know why you went blind?Lamiroir:...I do not. I may have been born this way, in fact.Klavier:...It's fruitless to attempt to pry into her past. And, I might add, it's a delicate subject.Judge:I'm not sure we can reasonably expect Mr. Justice to do anything delicately.Apollo:(Hey! Why I oughta... take a deep breath and calm down.)Lamiroir:What I am now is all that I have. It is enough, I think.Lamiroir:I debuted in a world of darkness and sound...PressApollo:Apollo:Weren't you nervous to hit the stage in your condition?Lamiroir:No, not at all, surprisingly. It felt natural, singing in front of everyone.Judge:It's not something just anyone can do.Klavier:She has talent, that much is quite clear. You might even say she is beloved by the gods of music.Lamiroir:Even without light, I live perfectly happy in my world of sound. If that is a talent, as you say, then I thank the gods responsible.Apollo:What about your PR motto?Lamiroir:My producer came up with my PR line before he knew this.PressApollo:Apollo:Perhaps your music reminded him of the Borginian scenery?Lamiroir:Ah ha ha. No, it was quite the opposite.Apollo:The opposite?Lamiroir:According to my producer... ...my music has a certain \"global\" quality.Judge:Global?Lamiroir:Multicultural, if you will. Hard to pin to one region. When people listen to it, they picture the country closest to their hearts. Which is why my music has reached so many.Trucy:What a lovely story!Klavier:It sounds like this producer might have known what he was doing after all.Lamiroir:My songs are nothing more than a white canvas. To me, the real landscape painter [sic] are the listeners. When I think of that, I do not mind how I am represented to the world so much. Yet, one thing quickly led to another...Lamiroir:So, silly as it may sound, I had to pretend I could see.PressApollo:Apollo:Was that to protect your image as the \"landscape painter in sound\"?Lamiroir:That does not matter so much to me, really. But the label is quite concerned about it, I think.Trucy:A landscape painter who can't see... that's like a pianist who can't play, huh.Apollo:I'm not sure you can compare your father to Lamiroir.Lamiroir:The world of commercial music is filled with these little white lies. Nothing is sacred when it comes to publicity...Lamiroir:Everyone on my staff knew, of course, but no others.PressApollo:Leads to:\"When you say your staff, do you include Mr. LeTouse?\"Apollo:(I suppose that's her confession, of sorts. There's just one part that bothers me... ...And I'm going to get to the bottom of it.)Apollo:When you say your staff, do you include Mr. LeTouse?Lamiroir:Of course. He was my manager.Apollo:(So he knew... and that's what's been bugging me!)Judge:Something the matter, Mr. Justice?Klavier:I believe I know what is bothering our young defense attorney. ...You are thinking of when you discovered the body, yes?Apollo:...!Trucy:Is he right, Apollo?Apollo:...Yes, I was.LeTouse:......Nnnh......Apollo:...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?LeTouse:...Cold... so cold... Witness...Apollo:You're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!LeTouse:...Can't s...see...Apollo:Hang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?LeTouse:The wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...Apollo:Mr. LeTouse told me to ask the witness, and he named you.Lamiroir:...!Apollo:Why would he do that? He knew you were blind!Lamiroir:I... I don't know...Klavier:Tsk, tsk.Apollo:...!Klavier:What did I just say? You need to learn to think for yourself.Apollo:Meaning what...?Klavier:There is no mystery here if you recall everything he said. Think of his last words once more.Judge:\"The witness... siren\"? We've heard them many times. Along with a little play-acting by our defense.Klavier:I remember them well myself, but that statement is not to what I refer. I mean what he said before that.Apollo:...Before? (What came before that...?) Ack!Klavier:...That's right. He tried to tell you. When he said \"can't see\" he wasn't talking about himself. He was talking about the witness!Judge:I see!Klavier:Too bad the defense did not. Well, Herr Forehead? Try relaxing and \"looking\" at the facts first next time.Apollo:...Urk!Judge:Order! Order!Klavier:Recall Lamiroir's earlier testimony...Lamiroir:I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit. There were two shots... I couldn't do anything to stop it.Judge:But she couldn't have heard those gunshots! I thought we proved that...Klavier:That is not the most important point here.Judge:Hmm?Klavier:The moment he was shot, Mr. LeTouse \"witnessed\" her through that window. ...Why else would he have named her as the witness?Apollo:Ah...Lamiroir:But I really did hear them! Two gunshots... and the man's voice!Klavier:Unfortunately, such a thing was impossible. The window was closed. We have already run a simulation, of course.Lamiroir:But it was so clear... If I heard that voice again, I would know it in an instant...Judge:Hmm...Bailiff:...Your Honor!Judge:What is it, Bailiff? Can't you see we're in session here!?Bailiff:We have the results back from the investigation!Judge:The investigation...?Klavier:Ah, the Interpol number that Mr. LeTouse left us.Judge:...! Well let's hear it! ...We will continue this cross-examination afterward. Detective Crescend! Your report please!Daryan:I asked Interpol about that number. I'm sure you'll find their answer intriguing.Klavier:...Quick work as always, Daryan.Judge:Well, tell us about the number! Is the defendant a secret agent!?Daryan:\"IPXX314206\"... The agent registered under that number... ...was Romein LeTouse.Klavier:What...?Daryan:Our undercover Interpol agent was Mr. LeTouse himself! He was apparently in the middle of an operation.Apollo:So, when he wrote those letters...Daryan:...He was trying to tell us his own identity. And a cautious killer tried to wipe them away.Trucy:Mr. LeTouse was an undercover Interpol agent... So him being Lamiroir's manager...Apollo:...Was just a cover, most likely.Daryan:There's one other important detail I found.Klavier:Well, out with it.Daryan:It concerns that 45-caliber revolver, the murder weapon. Apparently, it belonged to Romein LeTouse. He had an Interpol permit to carry firearms. ...And the registration number on the revolver matched.Klavier:So the victim was killed with his own weapon, which makes sense. It's hard to imagine someone who wasn't an Interpol agent with such a large revolver.Apollo:(So the victim was an Interpol agent on an undercover op... I wonder how that ties into everything.)Trucy:It's got to tie in somehow, you'd think.Apollo:Yeah, somehow...Judge:Thanks for looking into that for us, Detective Crescend. It's a great help.Daryan:Oh, no problem at all, Your Honor. ...I'll be heading out...???:Lamiroir:Wait!Judge:La-Lamiroir! Is something the matter?Lamiroir:That voice just now...Klavier:Daryan?Lamiroir:Mr. Daryan, is it...? ............ It was him. I am sure of it.Judge:It was \"him\"?Klavier:Y-You aren't saying--!?Lamiroir:That voice I heard, talking to Mr. LeTouse... when I heard the gunshots fired. It was him! It was Mr. Daryan!Klavier:Is this some kind of a joke!?Apollo:Whaaaaaaaat!?Daryan:...No way...Apollo:(The courtroom fell into such a chaotic state, the trial had to be suspended temporarily. I'd never seen that happen before. Of course, it's not every day that you get an accusation like that one. Lamiroir, fingering Daryan Crescend. Not only is he a guitarist, he's a detective! Could it really have been his voice Lamiroir heard? Things were changing fast, and frankly, I wasn't sure I could keep up with it.)Trucy:Hey! No wimping out now, Apollo!To be continued.Presenting wrong evidence during testimonyApollo:Apollo:Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?Judge:Uh... I'm not sure I follow you.Apollo:It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...Judge:...You don't sound very sure, Mr. Justice. Objection overruled.Apollo:(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimonyApollo:Apollo:This evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!Judge:How exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?Apollo:They aren't, are they...?Judge:Not at all. Mr. Justice, please think the facts over before making accusations.Apollo:(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimonyApollo:Apollo:Your Honor! That statement contradicts the evidence!Judge:...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...Apollo:...Um... You sure about that?Judge:Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Justice!Apollo:(Ack! That didn't go so well.)Perceive wrong area (during cross-examination segment \"What I Saw\")Apollo:Apollo:You may have seen the world, but I've seen your heart. You were flustered during your testimony just now!Lamiroir:...... I do not understand what it is you are saying. Perhaps this is a joke, in your culture?Trucy:She doesn't seem very flustered to me, Apollo.Apollo:(Hmm. Maybe I got that one wrong. I have to look harder! I'll find that weak spot!)Too many penaltiesJudge:That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Machi Tobaye...GuiltyJudge:The defendant will surrender himself to the court's care... ...to undergo a regular trial at the High Court within a month's time.

I mean, something. ...Or maybe not.Apollo:Out with it. The suspense is giving me an ulcer.Trucy:Well, you know, the trial today? I was thinking... If you gave it a score, what score would you give it?Apollo:Score? Um, gee... I guess I would... um, or maybe... well... ...Bah. I'm just as bad as you.Trucy:See? It's so... so vague!Apollo:Clearly. Machi avoided a guilty verdict, which is something. Though I can't say I'm any less confused about the case.Daryan:I asked Interpol about that number. I'm sure you'll find their answer intriguing. \"IPXX314206\"... The agent registered under that number... ...was Romein LeTouse.Apollo:And the victim, Mr. LeTouse...

Lamiroir told the whole court!Lamiroir:Wait! That voice just now... ............ It was him. I am sure of it. That voice I heard, talking to Mr. LeTouse... when I heard the gunshots fired. It was him! It was Mr. Daryan!Trucy:It's another mystery, Apollo! I love mysteries.Apollo:I don't. Speaking of mysteries, what's Mr. Wright up to? I wouldn't mind asking his opinion.Trucy:Now that you mention it, I haven't seen Daddy around.Apollo:What, is he some kind of stray that just wanders in and out at will?Trucy:I wouldn't say that, but he has been going out a lot. Some \"top-secret mission\", he said.Apollo:Top secret...?Trucy:Anyway, you can't just rely on him to save the day! And you've got me to help you. We'll be fine!Apollo:Fine... right. Well, time's a-wasting, as they say. Let's investigate.Trucy:That's the spirit!ExamineBookshelfApollo:There are several books of magic mixed in with the legal books on the shelves.

The very same! Here, watch... First, I put one of the cups over the ball... then I snap my fingers! Ta da! The ball's under the other cup!Apollo:...It's not there.Trucy:...... ...Watch me pull something out of my magic panties!Apollo:Nice try.Trucy:Guess I know what I'll be doing tonight. Practicing! You can be my audience, Apollo!Apollo:(*sigh*)Silk hatApollo:That's one of those hats you pull things out of, right?Trucy:Of course! My hat's like a little universe! Bigger on the inside than on the outside!Apollo:Hmm... That reminds me of a sci-fi show I used to watch.Trucy:Incidentally, my pocket is a little universe, too! And my panties, and...Apollo:I get the idea.SpaghettiApollo:I've seen some restaurants that set out real food to show what's on the menu.Trucy:I have, too! But I noticed something strange... One time, there was a sandwich without any lettuce! Like it had disappeared... by magic!Apollo:...I'm sure someone just swiped the lettuce and ate it.Trucy:Wait, that sandwich... You didn't...! Apollo, you shouldn't eat sample food, no matter how hungry you are!Apollo:Just how hard up do you think I am!?TableTrucy:Well, how about some tea? Here you go!Apollo:Um, thanks. That's nice. ...But this is not the time to be drinking tea!Trucy:That's right, we have to get investigating! Ack, that was a close call! We almost relaxed!TalkDaryan did itApollo:Lamiroir dropped a bomb in court today... \"It was Daryan\"...Trucy:Lamiroir said she's never forgotten a voice, right? That's so cool!Apollo:Um, I guess.Trucy:What's that called again? Um... Elephant ears...? I bet that's what they're called...Apollo:...Somehow I don't think that means what you think it means. ...And she has to be wrong, this time.Trucy:Wrong? Why?Apollo:I mean, look... Those gunshots were right during the concert!Trucy:That's right! I was burning up the dance floor at the time.Apollo:Right... Did you happen to look up on stage? Maybe... at Daryan, even?Trucy:You bet I did! He is one of the Gavinners's guitarists after all! He's so cool! ...Oh.Apollo:Right. All the Gavinners have a rock-solid alibi. He couldn't have shot Mr. LeTouse backstage.Trucy:But... Lamiroir heard him, didn't she? She heard Daryan backstage... Right...?Apollo:(Somebody's either wrong, or lying very badly here...)Agent LeTouseApollo:An Interpol agent... hmm.Trucy:I was wondering, what is \"Interpol\" anyway?Apollo:Huh? Interpol? They're the guys who catch international criminals.Trucy:Why can't they just call them \"International Police\" instead of making up some silly name?Apollo:Yeah... ...Anyway, you think he was investigating Lamiroir?Trucy:Whaaaa--!? Why would anyone do that? She's not a criminal! She couldn't be!Apollo:Don't be fooled by appearances is all I'm saying.Trucy:But remember I'm a magician, Apollo! I can spot a palmed coin at fifty paces!Apollo:If only it were that easy. ...In any case, we know he was working on something.Trucy:I wonder if it was something that has something to do with something. That something being our case. The last something, I mean.Apollo:Something like that. ...Frankly, the whole thing is making my head hurt. (What was Mr. LeTouse up to?)PresentAttorney's BadgeTrucy:That again? You sure like your attorney's badge. Still, I'm afraid our clients are getting tired of it...Apollo:...Well I'm not. So there.Anything elseTrucy:I'm not sure about that, sorry. I was ripping up the dance floor at the time of the shooting, after all.After clearing all Talk options:???:Ahhh ha ha ha ha haa!Apollo:......Trucy:......Apollo:Um, Trucy?

Who... are you? (And could you please stop smirking like that?)Trucy:Ah. Ahhhhhhh! It's you!!! Uncle Valant!Apollo:Uncle Valant...? He's your uncle!?Trucy:No, silly! It's the Great Gramarye, Valant Gramarye! The Grand Magician!Valant:Yes, it is I, the Great Valant Gramarye. As seen on television.Apollo:(And could you please stop smirking like that?)Valant:It's been a while, Miss Trucy. Seven years to be exact! My, how you've grown!Trucy:Good to see you again, Uncle Valant! You... look exactly the same!Apollo:Um, I hate to intrude, but... What is a Great Magician doing paying us a visit?Valant:I believe it was you who wished to see me? So, be quick with your questions! And do not quail, quake, or quiver. I am quite tame. Though my stardom may sear the sight... I'm quite down to earth when need calls.Apollo:(He does have a certain aura to him, it's true.)Trucy:Let's ask him about the case, Apollo!Apollo:(His \"aura\" sure isn't lost on our magician-in-the-making. She's practically drooling with enthusiasm.)Trucy:After all... ...Uncle Valant's one of Daddy's best friends! That's why I call him \"uncle\".Apollo:Wh-What? Daddy... you mean Mr. Wright...?Trucy:No, I mean... My real Daddy.Apollo:...! (Trucy's real father!?)TalkTroupe GramaryeTrucy:Wait, Apollo... Don't tell me you don't know about Troupe Gramarye?Apollo:Troupe \"Gram-uh-ree\"... huh? No. (Changed form [Troupe Grammarie... huh? No.] in the original release) But it does sound kind of familiar...Valant:Oh, lost life! Lamentably listless lad! To not know of the greatest troupe of magicians on the planet!Apollo:(Valant Gramarye... The name began to surface in my mind. It was a name I'd heard on television as a child.)Trucy:You bet you've heard the name! He made a cruise ship disappear, and blew up an amusement park... ...Oh, and he made all this gold disappear from a safe! And then escaped from a high security prison!Apollo:Um... ...You said he is a magician?Valant:I open the locks to hearts chained... by mediocrity. This is the true miracle of Troupe Gramarye.Apollo:...Wait.Trucy:What, Apollo?Apollo:I do remember... seeing you on television... a long time ago. Weren't you with someone else...? Like, a duo?Trucy:A duo?Apollo:Yeah, you had a partner. \"Something Gramarye\"...Valant:Yes... Zak. Zak Gramarye. A masterful maker of magic, a capable crafter of shining showmanship!Trucy:......Apollo:? Why's everyone so quiet?Trucy:Daddy...Apollo:Daddy...? (Huh!? Oh, no way!)Trucy's fatherValant:Once upon a time, the Troupe Gramarye included two Grand Magicians. Myself, Valant Gramarye, and my partner... Zak Gramarye!Apollo:And this Zak was...?Trucy:He was my real Daddy.Apollo:(Trucy's father, a magician... I guess it makes sense.) ...I had no idea.Trucy:There wasn't much point in talking about it... Not now that he's gone.Apollo:...Oh, I'm sorry.Trucy:No, it's OK. I'm not lonely. I've got my Daddy, after all! And you make me laugh, Apollo.Apollo:Glad that I'm good for comic relief, at least.Trucy:...Not that I see Daddy around much these days.PresentAnythingValant:What's this? You would ask me for a miracle? Free of fee? Then thy wish be granted! Thy will be done! Thy evidence evicted into the ether!Apollo:Ack! No evicting, please! (...Are all magicians like this, I wonder?)After clearing all Talk options:Valant:...Ach, I've been remiss in remembering my reasons for my visit.Apollo:Reasons?Valant:Two, in fact! The first being, of course... ...to see you, Miss Trucy.Trucy:You don't know how happy I am to see you again, Uncle Valant!Valant:I'm sure you are.Apollo:...Not one for modesty, are you?Valant:When I encountered you at the Coliseum... the first time in seven years... ...I could fain not contain my emotions! I wept oceans! (Chagned from [...I could fain contain my emotions! I wept oceans!] in the original release) And to learn you now defend that poor pianist, that blinded boy! 'Twas a hot topic of talk amongst the staff, you know. And defend him you did!Trucy:Eh heh. Well, it wasn't all my doing.Apollo:Um, I'm his defense attorney, actually.Valant:My other reason for coming here today... was this.Trucy:That's... a video tape?Valant:Quite so. A recording of the concert, no less. I've brought it for you, Trucy, on behalf of Troupe Gramarye. Will you watch it?Sugar, Sugar...O that night, in your embrace.When you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.Pleasure...But a fleeting melodyIt wraps itself around me,And now through the air I fly.Woh... Woh...Burning on in my heart. Fire.Burn my love away. All away.Like a bullet of love. Fire.Take my life away. All away.Guitar, Guitar...Up together to the sky.Trucy:Wow... It's almost as good as it was live. So... what's the word? Mysterious...Apollo:(There are more mysterious things than her song going on... Way more mysterious...)Valant:Ah ha ha ha ha...!Apollo:(This Valant Gramarye has good reasons to be here today... But I wonder what his \"reasons\" were to be at that concert?)Video Tape received from Valant.PresentVideo TapeLeads to:\"So, I was wondering... That stunt in the middle of the song there...\"Apollo:So, I was wondering... That stunt in the middle of the song there...Trucy:I didn't see a stunt...Apollo:What about Lamiroir vanishing and reappearing!?Trucy:Oh, that? I guess I'm so used to seeing that happen I didn't even notice.Apollo:(So young to be so jaded...)Valant:A simple sleight-of-hand, a petite prestidigitation. (Changed from [A simple slight-of-hand [sic], a petit prestidigitation.] in the original release) A modicum of magic from me... to you.Trucy:So that's why you were at the concert!Valant:Yes. I was there to watch my trick take to the air...Apollo:So you're the one who knows how it was all done.Valant:Of course. I am like a deity, with the stage as my domain! I suffer no mystery upon those floodlit boards not grasped tightly 'twixt my fingers. It is a potent, primeval power I possess.Apollo:Um... Well... Do you think you could... ...tell me how it was done!?Trucy:Hey now!Apollo:Trucy...?Trucy:That's like, totally against the rules, Apollo!Apollo:Not during a murder investigation, it's not!Valant:Mais non, for my illusions are mine alone, m'sieur. Also...Apollo:Also what?Valant:Recall that the terrible occurrence happened later. Well after my illusion entranced the audience.Apollo:Oh.Valant:Don't even ask. I won't answer.Trucy:Too bad for you, Apollo!Apollo:(Grr. Whose side are you on?)Valant:...I, Valant Gramarye, now make my leave, Miss Trucy.Trucy:There's no need to rush, Uncle Valant! You should stay a while!Valant:I am afraid I cannot. I may not. I shall not. I have been asked to assist with an analysis and so I shall slink back to the scene.Apollo:So... you'll be at the concert venue today?Valant:Correct. If you would call on me, come to the Coliseum! See you later, crocodile.Apollo:(With a whir of his cloak, and a wink of his eye... ...he turned and walked out through the door. Normally.)Trucy:Well, there you go, Apollo! Let's get cracking!Apollo:...Right. (Valant Gramarye... I've got a few more things to ask him. Foremost among them, that bit of magic that made Lamiroir disappear... ...And how he knows Trucy, and her \"real\" father...!)ExaminePhotographApollo:So this photo is of your father, Trucy?Trucy:Someday, I'll be as good a magician as Zak Gramarye! You'll see!Apollo:(No wonder she's so devoted to her art...)Trucy:You should have seen him on stage, Apollo! He made things disappear right and left! Poof poof poof! Until he even made himself disappear! Cool, huh?Apollo:Uh, yeah... (Is that how it really happened?)July 9Detention CenterVisitor's RoomApollo:(Machi may not be guilty, but he's still a suspect.)Trucy:But they don't have any decisive evidence!Apollo:Yeah, but only someone as small as him could have gotten out of that room.Trucy:Right... the air vent.Apollo:And... he lied.Trucy:Lied?Apollo:(Machi Tobaye can see...)Machi:....................Trucy:Ah! Machi!Apollo:Speak of the devil.Machi:....................Trucy:He looks like he's doing OK!Apollo:I forget. Why did we come here? It's not like we can talk to him or anything.Trucy:Words are overrated! Feelings are what matter, Apollo.Apollo:It's kinda hard to build a court case on feelings. But, since we're here, anyway. Might as well get what I want to say off my chest.Trucy:If you need someone to complain to, I'll listen...Apollo:(I think she's actually worried for me...)Machi:.....................ExamineSecurity cameraApollo:That security camera is looking at me. Why do I feel this sudden urge to make a silly face?Security guardApollo:A security guard. He stands here, watching this room. His eyes when he looks at Machi are gentle. Maybe he has a kid the same age.TalkThe trial todayTrucy:So, what did you think of the trial today?Machi:.....................Trucy:...Whew. I'm glad he doesn't understand English after all. If he did, he would have been scared out of his mind by that trial.Apollo:Hey, all's well that ends well. You have to be more goal-oriented. If he's innocent, we win. (Changed from [You have to be more goal oriented. If he's not guilty, we win.] in the original release)Trucy:No, if he's found \"not guilty\", we win. (Changed from [No, if he's innocent, we win.] in the original release) Machi might not understand English, but I bet he gets that better than you do.Machi:.....................Apollo:...! (Huh...?)Lamiroir's testimonyTrucy:I'm glad Lamiroir testified! What a great person. She even got Machi off the hook by naming another suspect!Apollo:Daryan of the Gavinners... The detective. I wonder if Machi knows what happened?Trucy:?Apollo:I mean, if he could follow how the trial went at all. If no one told him there's a new suspect, how would he know? Hey...Trucy:What is it, Apollo?Apollo:No... It's nothing.Machi:.....................Machi's eyesightTrucy:So, Machi... You can see, right?Machi:........................Trucy:Machi can see, and Lamiroir can't... The whole world's gone topsy-turvy!Machi:........................Trucy:Sorry, Apollo. I don't think we're going to get any information out of Machi. ...Which makes sense.Apollo:(...Yeah, I guess it does...)PresentAnythingMachi:[Foreign text]...Trucy:I think he said... \"I am sorry I cannot speak your language. You are very beautiful, fair maiden.\"Apollo:...This is why I never trust a translator.After clearing \"The trial today\" and \"Lamiroir's testimony\" Talk options:Apollo:...I must be imagining it.Trucy:Imagining what, Apollo?Apollo:It's just, I couldn't help but feel that... I dunno. Machi... ...He doesn't understand what we're saying, right?Trucy:How could he? He's a young Borginian! He doesn't speak English.Apollo:Yeah, but my bracelet is reacting to him.Trucy:Huh? Maybe it's malfunctioning? Or it's scared, because you keep making those \"I'm so mad\" faces.Apollo:Was I that bad? (Machi lied about not being able to see... But what if that's not all he lied about?)Trucy:If you're curious about it there's only one thing to do. You should ask him.Apollo:(I think it'll take something big to get to him... Some kind of undeniable evidence.) ...We'll be back, Machi.Machi:........................July 9Sunshine ColiseumTrucy:Woo! What a great day! It's perfect weather for sleuthing!Apollo:The weather matters for an investigation?Trucy:Don't some days just feel like \"magic\" days or \"defense\" days?Apollo:Um, sure. Let's get started, shall we?Trucy:Right on! Show us your stuff, Apollo!Apollo:Um, what stuff?Trucy:Your voice training! This is the perfect place for it!Apollo:I did enough at home, thanks.Trucy:Aw, there's no need to be shy! Keep that up and you'll never make it on the big stage!Apollo:I'm happy in the courtroom, thank you. I am a lawyer.Trucy:Then you're in luck, because it's lawyer weather today! Don't you just want to face the blue sky and shout, \"Objection!\"?Apollo:Look, the weather has nothing to do with lawyers. Let's get going already!ExamineBlimpTrucy:Look! A blimp!Apollo:Those balloons next to it have ad banners on them.Trucy:Let's see... \"Big Sale, All Shirts 50% Off.\"Apollo:Oh. It's an ad for the department store next door.Blue BadgerApollo:What's that... creature there?Trucy:Oooh! That's the police mascot, the Blue Badger!Apollo:Eh? It's life size!Trucy:Haven't you seen them around town? Patrolling the streets? Yes, now even law and order has a mascot!Apollo:...I'd run from that thing even if I wasn't a criminal. Why does its head wobble like that when it walks? It's freaky.Trucy:I don't think you're showing true Blue Badger spirit, Apollo.Coliseum buildingApollo:Sunshine Coliseum sure is living up to its name today.Trucy:It's huge! And Mr. Gavin got to play on that enormous stage... I'm so jealous! Someday, I'll fight my first battle on this stage!Apollo:Battle?Trucy:Well, yeah, it's a coliseum, isn't it?Apollo:Um, they don't do gladiatorial contests at these places any more, Trucy.Trucy:Really? I had no idea! I wonder why they stopped.Apollo:(Sometimes I worry about her.)SignboardApollo:Look, a massive sign for the \"Guilty as Charged\" Tour. A giant Prosecutor Gavin stares out over the arena.Trucy:Ooh! Maybe I can take it to the office when they're done with it!Apollo:Um, where would you put it? You couldn't even get that thing through the front door.Trucy:Then I'll put it outside! I bet it'd be good for business!Apollo:Just as long as no one comes expecting us to prosecute.Trucy:Well, if anyone comes looking for a concert, leave it to me!Apollo:(Is this part of some twisted plan of hers to make her singing debut, I wonder?)July 9Backstage HallwayLamiroir:Ah, Mr. Attorney.Apollo:Lamiroir! I'm sorry about today... I...Lamiroir:There is nothing you need to apologize for. You were merely defending Machi.Trucy:Um... Are you OK? Alone, I mean.Lamiroir:Humans are blessed with five senses. Even robbed of one, we get by. ...Though it does make being a witness rather difficult.Trucy:Speaking of \"seeing\", you knew who we were before we spotted you just now. And we weren't even talking.Lamiroir:...I heard your footsteps several times the day before.Trucy:Oh... You must have great ears!Apollo:(Ears that heard the crime taking place... Or so she claimed yesterday. ...But how?)ExamineBlue BadgerApollo:That would be the Blue Badger, the police mascot. There's a guy outside in a giant Blue Badger costume, lumbering about... He stands out even more than those Gavinners posters.Trucy:It's all the same! He's the band mascot, too, you know.Apollo:I can't picture Prosecutor Gavin going for that kind of thing.Trucy:Neither can I. I'll bet there's a story there just waiting to be told!HeadsetTrucy:That's been lying there since the day before yesterday.Apollo:It's small. Maybe no one's noticed it.Trucy:I kinda want to pick it up. It'd make a cool souvenir, don't you think?Apollo:(It does stick out in my mind for some reason...)\"Dressing #1\" doorApollo:That's the Gavinners's dressing room. They're all out on the investigation. Being backstage isn't half as glamorous without a band here.\"Dressing #2\" doorApollo:That's Lamiroir's dressing room... and the scene of the crime. It's kind of lightly guarded for being a crime scene.Trucy:I'm not complaining! Makes it easier for us to go in! And Ema gave us her OK, right? We can wander in and do as we like!Apollo:(How is Ema doing, anyway...? I hope she's not getting cavities from eating all those chocolate Snackoos...)TalkThe voiceApollo:That was quite a statement you made today in court. ...About hearing Daryan Crescend's voice at the scene of the crime.Lamiroir:I did not know his name... ...but I never forget a voice.Lamiroir:Wait!Judge:La-Lamiroir! Is something the matter?Lamiroir:That voice just now... ............ It was him. I am sure of it.Daryan:...No way...Lamiroir:...As I said in court: I was on my way backstage from the stage. That is when I heard his voice.Apollo:I'm guessing Daryan and Mr. LeTouse were talking about something?Lamiroir:...The next moment, I heard those gunshots.Apollo:Why didn't you call security?Lamiroir:To be honest, though the noise was quite frightening... ...I never imagined the gunshots might be real. And, I was in quite a hurry myself. I left the scene at once.Trucy:So... it really was Daryan's voice that she heard.Apollo:Yeah... (At least, she certainly thinks it was.)MachiLamiroir:I met Machi before my debut as Lamiroir... I was singing in a restaurant in Borginia.Apollo:And he was playing the piano?Lamiroir:...Yes. He was very kind to me when he learned I could not see.Apollo:Is that when you started playing \"opposites\"? With Machi pretending he couldn't see...Lamiroir:Ah, no, it wasn't then. That began after our major debut. ...After I became known as the \"landscape painter in sound\".Trucy:It must have been tough for Machi... ...Pretending he couldn't see, and all the while acting as your eyes.Lamiroir:We held hands always. He would write with his finger on my palm to signal to me thing I should know. He is a smart, gentle boy.Apollo:(I think I see what she's getting at... ...\"Machi would never harm a soul\"...)Mr. LeTouseApollo:About Mr. LeTouse...Lamiroir:Ah yes. He was an Interpol agent, I hear?Apollo:So, you had no idea?Lamiroir:Of course not. No one did.Trucy:I guess that's what it means to be undercover.Apollo:But someone was after him... They had to know who he really was.Lamiroir:Why did he pose as my manager? I do not understand.Apollo:You have no idea?Lamiroir:I can only assume that he was investigating me... But why?Apollo:What makes you think that?Lamiroir:Perhaps it is not so, but I cannot deny the possibility. Because of my condition... As my present is veiled in darkness, so, too, is my past clouded from my memory.Apollo:Clouded... right.\"Darkness\" (appears after \"Mr. LeTouse\")Lamiroir:The darkness that I fear is not the darkness that I see whenever I open my eyes. The real darkness... lies in my heart.Apollo:In your heart?Lamiroir:I have no memory of the time before I became Lamiroir. I awoke from darkness, into darkness, you might say. I was singing in a restaurant those days.Apollo:(What was it that she said about not being able to remember the light...?)Lamiroir:I do not know my past. Perhaps I committed some terrible crime in my past. Everything before becoming Lamiroir is lost to me.Trucy:B-But I don't think you...Lamiroir:I can think of no other explanation. Why else would an agent of Interpol approach me?Apollo:Do you think your past might be related to this case?Trucy:No way! That seems really unlikely to me. I mean, you're such a sweet person, Lamiroir!Lamiroir:...I thank you. Machi, too, tells me this often when I fear who I might have been.PresentVideo TapeApollo:We took a look at your performance again. It was even better the second time!Lamiroir:Thank you.Trucy:That reminds me... That was an incredible illusion you pulled off!Lamiroir:Illusion...?Trucy:When you teleported from one stage to the other? Remember?Lamiroir:Ah, yes. Apparently, they hired a professional magician.Apollo:(Valant Gramarye...) I was wondering, do you think you could tell us how it was done?Lamiroir:...I'm afraid I cannot. Mr. Gramarye made me swear to never tell a soul.Apollo:I was afraid of that...Trucy:Hard to be a magician if you can't keep a secret, you know?Anything elseApollo:Do you think you could tell me about this?Lamiroir:I'm sorry, but my information about the outside world is somewhat limited. I only know what I have heard, or felt.Apollo:(Maybe that explains why she didn't react when I showed her stuff the other day. She was still pretending she could see then...)After clearing all Talk options and presenting Video Tape:Lamiroir:Ah, I am reminded that I wished to speak to you about something.Apollo:Yes?Lamiroir:When I was walking this hallway before... I stumbled upon a small device of some kind. It was lying on the floor.Apollo:Device...? Maybe you mean this?Trucy:That's been lying there since the day before yesterday!Lamiroir:Might I... touch it? ...... I thought as much.Apollo:What? What did you think?Lamiroir:This is one of our headsets. Everyone on staff wears one during a concert.Apollo:I wonder whose this is?Lamiroir:We use it for communication. It would be quite inconvenient should it go missing.Apollo:We'll hold on to it for you then. We'll give it to Prosecutor Gavin when we see him.Lamiroir:Yes, that's best. Thank you.Trucy:So, can I put it on?Headset attached to Trucy.Trucy:\"Attached\"? I'm not some kind of robot, Apollo!Apollo:(Everyone on staff was wearing one of these headsets... This might warrant some further inquiry.)PresentHeadsetApollo:Can I ask you about this headset, Lamiroir? You said that all concert staff were wearing one?Lamiroir:That's correct. You need them to communicate across such a large stage. Everyone on the staff had one, of course... ...And all of the band members, too, I should think.Apollo:(So Prosecutor Gavin and his lackeys had them on, too, then...)Lamiroir:They're quite helpful, though limited. They only work within thirty feet or so. After all, they're only for use on stage. And a stronger signal would interfere with the sound system.Apollo:Hmm, that makes sense. (You'd think someone would notice if they dropped their only communications lifeline. ...So why was this one lying here?)Examine evidenceHeadsetReceiverTrucy:10-4 that, little buddy, this is Trucy reporting in, over. ......Apollo:Why the sudden silence?Trucy:No one answered.Apollo:Don't be silly.Trucy:What good is a receiver that doesn't receive? That's like Ema not performing forensic investigations!Apollo:You make her sound like she's some kind of forensic investigation machine! Which is just silly. Unless... she's a super hi-tech android that runs on Snackoos! Hmm...Gavinners's Dressing RoomExaminePostcardsApollo:It's a stack of Lamiroir's postcards. There it is... The \"landscape painter in sound\"...Trucy:It must be hard to pretend you can see when you can't.Apollo:Yet the way she sings so effortlessly... you'd think she had life easy. Some people are just impressive like that.Trucy:You know it! It just makes me think about how much further I have to go!Apollo:(I hope we can solve this quickly and not add to her troubles...)SpeakerApollo:The speaker here is the same as the one in Lamiroir's room. I wonder if this one was blaring as loud as hers.Trucy:I don't see a volume control anywhere in the room... My guess is they give all the rooms equal treatment!Apollo:...You mean equal punishment.Lamiroir's Dressing RoomExamineAir ventApollo:They found Machi Tobaye's fingerprints on that air vent.Trucy:......Apollo:What's with the long face?Trucy:It's a little lackluster, you know.Apollo:Lackluster...?Trucy:I mean, using the air vent is so obvious! No audience is going to pay good money to see a trick like that.Apollo:...... Things must look different through a magician's eyes.Trucy:It'd be much cooler if the killer got out through that tiny window!Apollo:Don't go there. You'll get your head stuck.BroochApollo:Right after the shooting took place... ...Lamiroir tried to come into the dressing room, and dropped her brooch.Trucy:I think that fits with the other stuff we know. Do you think the timing of when she dropped it is important?Apollo:Yeah... Something about it bugs me, that's for sure.Bullet holesApollo:Look at the way those bullets tore through this thick wall. That revolver really was something else.Trucy:I wonder if someone as little as me could even fire it?Apollo:Dislocating your shoulder would kind of put a crimp on your stage career.Trucy:Daddy always has stiff shoulders, maybe that could loosen him up!Apollo:Don't even mention it. I'm afraid he might go out and actually try it.Trucy:Nah, he doesn't have the guts to pull the trigger, I bet.Fruit basketTrucy:Look! It's fruit! Fruit, Apollo! Fruit!!!Apollo:...I heard you the first time. It sure is a lot of fruit. I doubt anyone would miss a bit of watermelon...Trucy:I know, I'll make it vanish! Into my stomach!Apollo:Better not. They might make you pay for it. And if you have the money for that, you should probably repaint the office first.Trucy:Watermelons are that expensive!?Apollo:*shrug* These could've been imported from some exotic locale, for all we know.(Step)ladderApollo:The shooter must have used that to climb up to the vent.Trucy:All this tragedy, because someone left a stepladder here.Apollo:...I don't think Mr. LeTouse was shot because of the ladder.Trucy:You think it was Machi?Apollo:I guess... That air vent is pretty small, after all. (Does that prove he was at the scene...? Did he escape in the time between the gunshots and us opening the door?)Poster next to TVApollo:It's a poster for another show. \"This Summer: A Legal Eagles Production of 'Case Closed'.\"Trucy:I looked into that performance group. Turns out they're all law enforcement-related, too. Apparently, their serious portrayal of law and order is a big draw!Apollo:...That sounds so boring, it's probably pretty interesting.Trucy:You're a complicated man, Mr. Apollo Justice.Poster over TVTrucy:A Gavinners poster.Apollo:How many of those did they put up, anyway?Trucy:Prosecutor Gavin looked so cool on stage! You should learn to play the guitar, too, Apollo! You can accompany my magic act!Apollo:...We'd certainly be a novelty act, if nothing else. (I'll think about it if I ever lose my attorney's badge.)SpeakerApollo:A speaker for monitoring the stage. It was blaring at the time of the shooting.Trucy:It's a pretty old model for such a nice place.Apollo:I guess they don't care about sound quality back here. As long as you can hear it... (Not that a loss of fidelity could possibly make that music worse...)Trucy:Good speakers must cost a lot. You have any idea how much a nice one that size would cost, Apollo?Apollo:Probably a good ten years of your allowance, give or take.Trucy:Whaaat!? But that's almost 600 dollars!Apollo:...... (Five dollars a month...? Poor Trucy... Wait till she finds out you need to buy two speakers for a stereo...)TelevisionApollo:That's one of the biggest, most expensive-looking TVs I've ever seen.Trucy:Too bad you'll never own one.Apollo:\"Never\"'s kind of harsh, Trucy.Trucy:Hmm. How about \"for all eternity\" then?Apollo:Same difference.Cut off section of carpetApollo:Hey, look. A part of the carpet has been torn up here.Trucy:That was the part we did the luminol testing on in court!Apollo:Luminol... right.Trucy:You know what I couldn't stop thinking? Who's going to pay for this carpet?Apollo:As long as it's not us... Maybe... the shooter?Trucy:I guess it's true what they say. Crime doesn't pay!Apollo:I would hope that carpet replacement costs weren't the only thing holding you back.Flower bouquetTrucy:That's one heavy-duty bouquet there.Apollo:I have trouble thinking of flowers as being \"heavy-duty\".Trucy:But they call lots of things heavy-duty!Apollo:Not flowers, they don't.Trucy:What about a \"heavy\" scent?Apollo:I think you mean \"heady\".Trucy:What if the flowers were plastic?Apollo:They still wouldn't be heavy.Trucy:OK, what if they were made out of metal?Apollo:What, like a magnolia made out of steel?Trucy:Exactly! Though I hope all my fans don't start throwing metal flowers at me.HairdryerApollo:That's one of those permanent dryers you see in hair salons.Trucy:Is that what they're really called? \"Permanent dryers\"?Apollo:Do I look like a beautician? I just know they dry your hair and give you a permanent...Trucy:It just doesn't sound very glamorous, you know?Apollo:OK, how about a \"permachine\"!?Trucy:Or you could go more simple, like \"permer\"!Apollo:...This isn't a bad game, thinking up official names for things. Not that it makes the name actually official or anything.Gift boxesTrucy:A stack of presents for Lamiroir. Stars always get the biggest presents. You know, you could give me a present, Apollo.Apollo:...Here, have a piece of candy.Trucy:Gee! Thanks!!!Apollo:(She must not get a lot of presents... Poor girl.)RevolverApollo:The murder weapon. So it belonged to Mr. LeTouse.Trucy:That thing makes normal revolvers look like water guns!Apollo:Mr. LeTouse was a big man. (But how about the person who shot him? Wouldn't they have to be about his size?)Small windowApollo:This was the window where Lamiroir \"saw\" the crime from... I wish it was that simple.Trucy:Kind of hard to see a crime when you can't see. But she did hear it!Apollo:Yeah, but the window was closed...Trucy:Maybe she heard it some other way?The StageExamineComputerApollo:Look at all the electronics. They must be sound-related.Trucy:Doesn't seeing a bunch of machines like this make you want to just fiddle with 'em? Can I, Apollo? Please?Apollo:No, no fiddling! You'll break something.Trucy:If you're going to make an omelet, you gotta break some eggs! That's what Daddy always says.Apollo:These eggs look kind of expensive.(Step)ladderApollo:That's the ladder we used to climb up the stage tower. ...Not a moment I'm likely to forget any time soon.Trucy:Me neither... I'll never be able to climb another tower again without thinking about it, you know?Apollo:...I'll never be able to climb a tower again, period.StageTrucy:I still can't believe we found Machi and Mr. LeTouse up there...Apollo:Yeah. I used to not like high places. Now I hate them.Trucy:It's not like it would have been nicer if we found a dead body closer to the ground. ...Though that reminds me. Daddy's bad with heights, too.Apollo:Huh, no kidding.Trucy:He took me on a Ferris wheel ride a while ago, you know! Halfway through, his face got all green and he mumbled \"objection\" over and over.Apollo:(...Poor guy.)After presenting Video Tape to Valant Gramarye in Wright Anything Agency:July 9In the WingsTrucy:That song... Isn't that the one Lamiroir was singing?Apollo:Yeah, you're right. \"The Guitar's Serenade\"...Trucy:Wow, I'd love to do a show on a stage like this!Apollo:I'd come to see that.Trucy:The house is full, and as one, the audience sighs with wonderment! There I am, singing my ballad, rose petals swirling through the air...Apollo:Not bad... wait. Aren't you a magician!?Trucy:...Oh. That's right. I was a magician, wasn't I.Apollo:(Some dedication...)Valant:Ah ha! If it isn't Miss Trucy! And indeed it is!Trucy:Uncle Valant!Apollo:What exactly are you doing here?Valant:...I take real responsibility in tasks undertaken. I am inspecting my equipment of illusion to make sure naught is amiss. (Changed from [I am inspecting my equipment of illusion to make sure naught is amiss, Miss.] in the original release)Trucy:The Lamiroir Teleportation Illusion! Ooh!Valant:Should anything go wrong, it would reflect poorly upon me and my troupe. As I went about my exacting examination, I happened to notice that piano. ...And I remembered that fair lady's melancholy melody.Trucy:Hey Apollo, maybe Uncle Valant can shed some light on this whole thing for us!ExaminePianoTrucy:That's one big piano! I've never actually played one.Apollo:Heh. You should get Mr. Wright to teach you sometime.Trucy:No good, he can't play either.Apollo:(I kind of feel bad for the guy now...)Trucy:Maybe now's my big chance! Stand back, this could be the debut of a prodigy! ...Eww.Apollo:Did you make that noise just now?Trucy:Um... Let me try it again. You know, I think something's stuck in the piano! Time to take a look under the hood... ...Huh. Look! This was stuck between the strings. It looks like some kind of switch.Apollo:(Someone must have thrown this into the piano...)Switch placed in pocket.Piano (subsequent times)Apollo:What do you think that thing was doing in there?Trucy:Throwing things inside pianos can't be good for them.Apollo:Not to mention you wouldn't be able to play whatever notes go with the strings it was on. (But the piano was fine during the concert... That must mean it was thrown in here after Machi played.)Trucy:So maybe someone threw it in here after the second set...TalkLamiroir's illusionTrucy:I was wondering about the show the night of the murder. Lamiroir's vanishing act was your illusion, right?Valant:Indeed. The purple prosecutor petitioned my performance. At the climax of the song, he said, make her disappear. ...Like a dream.Apollo:Like a dream...Valant:Yet, what can I work with on a stage meant for musical endeavors? There are none of the conveniences of a stage built for sorcerous acts. It was a challenging task, and so I accepted.Apollo:She disappeared from the top of the tower... ...But in order to move, you would have had to use some sort of secret tunnel.Valant:People come to me because I am a professional among professionals. My illusions are custom-made for a time and a place. ...Now, because of the murder, all the eyes of the nation are on this concert. Not a bad thing, as far as the fortunes of Troupe Gramarye are concerned.Trucy:So... you were here checking up on your trick to make sure it went well.Valant:And went well it did. Now, speaking of pianos... ...That piano over there troubles me.Apollo:It troubles you...? Why?Valant:Why? Why do you ask, why?Apollo:(I think it's probably quicker if I just go check it out myself, thanks.)Troupe GramaryeValant:I know what you are thinking in that head of yours. \"Gramarye, yes,\" you say. \"I recall seeing him on television.\" Something of that sort?Apollo:Um, actually, yes, you're right.Trucy:Wow! He just read your mind, Apollo!Apollo:...Or everyone tells him that and he made a good guess.Valant:It was twenty years ago... A young magician, a genius of his time, came down among us... His name... was Magnifi Gramarye! It was he who began the great Troupe Gramarye! At his prime, not a day passed that he did not play upon the screens of every TV there was.Apollo:(I do have a vague memory of someone like that on TV...)Valant:Yet, several years ago, that time came to an end. My troupe pulled a vanishing act, yes. Cries for magic no longer heard, the TV screen a barren waste, stripped of illusion.Trucy:Th-That's not true! I still went to all your shows! Like that one in the parking lot down at the supermarket.Apollo:(When you start playing supermarket parking lots, you know you're in trouble.)Valant:...We hone our skill at these small venues, always awaiting our time. ...Yes, one day we will rise, up from obscurity, onto fame's shining stage once more! I do this not only for the magic that is Gramarye, but for my partner...Apollo:Your partner...? You mean...Valant:Yes. Zak Gramarye.Apollo:(Trucy's father...)Valant:Before he disappeared seven years ago... ...there was no name higher than Gramarye in show business circles. None. I will see us returned to glory! I, Valant Gramarye!Valant and Zak (appears after \"Troupe Gramarye\")Valant:Our founder Magnifi Gramarye was truly a genius, a worker of miracles.Trucy:I'll never forget the one I saw when I was little! How he made that whole jumbo jet go... um, what happened to the jet again?Apollo:(...Apparently someone doesn't remember it as well as they thought.)Valant:Of all the would-be magicians who came to his door, only Zak and I had the talent. In no time at all, Valant and Zak were the shining stars in the Gramarye crown.Trucy:Cool, huh? And Zak Gramarye was my daddy!Valant:Now that Magnifi and Zak are gone, I have but one wish. Let it be I, Valant Gramarye who brings the Gramarye miracle back to the big stage!Trucy:I'm rooting for you!Valant:Miss Trucy, you cannot grow up quick enough! I need your skill by my side!Trucy:One skill, coming up!Apollo:(How do we manage to get off the topic of the case so quickly all the time?)PresentAttorney's BadgeValant:Ah... The proof positive of your profession, yes?Apollo:Um, yeah.Valant:Might I... have a look? Oh! What's this? It is gone!Apollo:Ack! What'd you do with my attorney's badge!?Valant:Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha. Don't be alarmed. Miss Trucy! Take a look into your topit, if you would.Trucy:Eek! It's your badge, Apollo! What's it doing in there? That was amazing! Wasn't it, Apollo?Apollo:(He called that pouch at her waist a \"topit\"...? Is that some kind of magician speak?)RevolverValant:...Pardon me? I have no money, if that's what you want.Apollo:Ack! No, no, I was just... Um, never mind. (The way he looked at the revolver... What was that? It was almost as if he had seen one before... and maybe wasn't too happy about it.)Valant:......Video TapeApollo:I was wondering about the stunt in the video, right in the middle of the song.Trucy:I didn't see a stunt... Oh, that? I guess I'm so used to seeing that happen I didn't even notice.Apollo:(So young to be so jaded...)Valant:A simple sleight-of-hand, a petite prestidigitation. (Changed from [A simple slight-of-hand [sic], a petit prestidigitation.] in the original release) A modicum of magic from me... to you.Trucy:So that's why you were at the concert!Valant:Yes. I was there to watch my trick take to the air...Apollo:So! Can you tell me how you did it?Trucy:Whoa! You can't just ask that sort of thing, Apollo!Apollo:Trucy...?Trucy:It's against the rules to ask a magician how they did it.Apollo:Not when you're doing a murder investigation it's not!Trucy:...Well, you might have a point, there. Will you tell us, Uncle Valant?Valant:It is against all that is sacred to inquire as to how a trick is performed.Apollo:OK, so you tell me how he did it, Trucy.Trucy:But I don't know!Apollo:(C'mon, you're a magician! Aren't you part of the same secret club?)Anything elseValant:Words cannot express my shock and chagrin... All I can see before me is this stage, and me, upon it. ...Nothing smaller, nothing less radiant catches my eye.Trucy:True. You're getting on in years. Not much time left to make your mark, huh...Valant:............ This is not how I was seeing it.Apollo:(So he doesn't care about what I have to show him, I get the point...)Examine evidenceSwitchButtonTrucy:This switch, sitting here, tempting me to push it...Apollo:Don't. You might blow up the whole coliseum.Trucy:Apollo, please... To think that every strange switch triggers a bomb... That kind of old-fashioned crime drama thinking doesn't cut it in our busy times!Apollo:Alright, Trucy P.I., please enlighten me. What do you think this switch does?Trucy:Hmm... Maybe it turns on the electric razor in Prosecutor Gavin's dressing room?Apollo:...A switch as big as razor to turn on a razor? OK...After presenting Headset in Backstage Hallway:July 9Lamiroir's Dressing Room...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH...Apollo:Uh oh... There's only one person I know who can munch with such... venom.Ema:...What are you doing here?Apollo:Hello, Ema. You're looking as grumpy as ever.Ema:Oh, am I supposed to be happy? You give me the second degree in court, and Prosecutor Gavin makes me look like a fool.Apollo:...You're talking about the blood stain Mr. LeTouse left?Ema:My department chief had a field day with that one. \"Even a blind person could see the shooter wasn't blind!\" Funny guy, huh?Trucy:But that blood stain helped uncover the biggest mystery of all!Apollo:Now we know that Mr. LeTouse was really with Interpol.Trucy:We wouldn't have found that out without you!Ema:I suppose. Maybe that's why the chief gave me these after he was finished chewing me out. Said it was my reward.Apollo:...Are chocolate Snackoos popular down at the precinct or something?Ema:...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH...Trucy:...I was hoping we could check out the crime scene again.Ema:Be my guest. You're not going to find any clues in here. ...Though I did find something strange.Trucy:Something strange?ExamineAir ventApollo:That's the air vent with Machi Tobaye's fingerprints.Trucy:......Apollo:What's with the frown?Ema:Can't a girl frown anymore? Is that a crime?Apollo:Ack! No, of course not, I just meant...Ema:Machi Tobaye's fingerprints are on that air vent. Why would his fingerprints be there if he wasn't the shooter?Apollo:(That's not a question I want to have to answer in court.)Ema:Hey! Wipe that frown off your face. One stick in the mud per crime scene, please.Apollo:(I guess girls can frown, but defense attorneys can't.)Cut off section of carpetApollo:Look, the carpet's been torn up here.Trucy:That's the part we did the lunimol testing on in court!Ema:\"Loony mall\"? What's \"Loony mall\"!? It's \"Luminol\"! Get it right!Trucy:...! Ema's kind of scary when it comes to science.Apollo:...Best learn the word and not incite her wrath again.TalkThe trial todayEma:I met my embarrassment quota for the year, that's for sure.Trucy:Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?Ema:Um, how?Trucy:I mean, think about it. Now you don't have to be embarrassed about anything else all year!Apollo:...If only it worked that way.Ema:It just bugs me to think that little kid outsmarted me. And it makes him even more suspicious now that we know he can see! He could have seen the air duct, and he could have shot that revolver.Trucy:But that's not how it sounded in Lamiroir's testimony.Ema:You mean her saying she heard Detective Daryan's voice at the scene? Hmm...Trucy:That's right!Ema:Why can't we have a normal, straightforward killing once in a while in this country!?Apollo:I'll pretend I didn't hear that.The caseEma:Was that true what you said in court today? You know, about the case... About how everything was happening according to those song lyrics?Apollo:...\"The Guitar's Serenade\", you mean?Trucy:I found the link, you know! First, Prosecutor Gavin's heart-shaped key ring was stolen. Then Lamiroir flew through the air. Then Prosecutor Gavin's guitar caught on fire. And in the end, a bullet took Mr. LeTouse's life... And he went up into the sky with a guitar... Well, fifteen feet up, at least. (Changed from [And he went up into the sky with a guitar... Well, thirty feet up, at least.] in the original release)Ema:It is kind of hard to chalk it up to coincidence, hmm.Trucy:I know! And I found it.Ema:You think the same person did all of this?Apollo:Don't ask me. I didn't do it.Ema:Neither did I! I couldn't fit through that air vent anyway.Trucy:What... You all think I did it!?Apollo:(Sometimes I worry about that girl.)Something strangeTrucy:...So what did you find?Ema:It's so little I must have passed over it yesterday. I found it under the sofa.Trucy:...What is it?Ema:Part of some device, I think. I haven't a clue what. The bit sticking out from the end looked familiar, so I had it examined. Turns out it's an antenna.Trucy:Ooh, like on a beetle?Ema:Like on a cell phone. This device must use an electronic signal of some sort.Trucy:An electronic signal, you say? Hmm...The switch (appears after \"Something strange\", then presenting Switch)Ema:...What are you trying to do, burn me alive!?Apollo:C'mon, it was just a few sparks.Ema:Says you! You weren't the one holding it!Trucy:There's enough sparks flying around here just with you two talking.Apollo:Anyway...

Pretty noble, really.Apollo:(I guess there really isn't a need for me to carry this around. Though it seems to have made a decent impression...)Lyrics SheetEma:Why did they have to commit their crime according to the song? Seems like it'd be more trouble than it's worth.Trucy:Maybe they were trying to throw off the investigation?Ema:That's certainly possible. But risky, don't you think? Just carrying someone as big as Mr. LeTouse would be tough enough.Apollo:(She may be a snacking fiend, but sometimes, she actually makes some sense.)RevolverEma:That's an Interpol-issue revolver, right?Apollo:Which means it belonged to Mr. LeTouse.

You mean the songs just kind of \"come to him\"?Daryan:Yeah, something like that. I guess you could call him a genius. Of course he changes the song and lyrics on a whim. Drives me up the wall.Apollo:He makes his court cases on a whim sometimes, too.Daryan:He changed the lyrics to a song just before a recording the other day, even. Wants to put in this line about a university student obsessed with girls. Whatever!Apollo:(Hmm? Why does that sound strangely familiar?)Daryan:Of course it always turns out good in the end.

That might be a little too rocking.Klavier:Ah ha ha ha. Of course, I would never do such a thing. Did I not say, they are like my lovers?

He does them all at once!?)Trucy:I wish I had three TVs.Apollo:What would you possibly do with three television sets?Trucy:I may look laid back and relaxed, but in reality, I'm quite busy, you know! I'm living life at turbo speed! Doing magic, going to school, investigating cases... But... But if I had three big TVs...! I could watch a magic video, do my homework, and catch a crime drama all at once!Apollo:The first two seem useful, I suppose.Reclining chairApollo:......Trucy:What's wrong, Apollo?

It is a harmony between the logical mind, and the primal spirit within!Apollo:(Is it so hard to admit that you like staring out your window and daydreaming?)TalkThe caseKlavier:Ah, that reminds me, did you see the paper today?Trucy:Yes! I always read the TV section.Klavier:Good girl. How about you, Herr Forehead?Apollo:...I read the funnies.Klavier:...Then you will not have seen this!Apollo:\"Concert of Tragedy -- The Prosecutor's Deadly Song!\"Trucy:Ooh, is that a new show? I haven't heard about that one.Klavier:It's not a show. It's an article. News, you know?Trucy:Oh, does this have anything to do with the case...?Klavier:Since getting back from the trial, my phone has been ringing off the hook! \"How does it feel to take a man's life with a song?\" \"Have you ever hummed a man all the way to death row?\" \"Do you think you could sing for me over the phone?\" ...It is endless. Endless! Thanks to the case you made today, of course.Trucy:Oh, that was all Apollo's idea!Apollo:(Hey!) Hmm? Is that a newspaper over there, too?Klavier:Ah yes. The Borginian Daily Bugle. Go ahead, take a look.Apollo:Um, thanks, but I can't read Borginian.Klavier:Oh, that's right. Suffice it to say this is big news over there as well. Though they didn't go so far as to mention the lyrics to my song.Trucy:Probably no one in Borginia could believe it.Klavier:...It's probably seen as \"just a theory\" at this point. Their journalists didn't see the need to mention it.Apollo:That makes sense. I hardly know what to think of it myself.Borginian Newspaper added to the Court Record.Klavier:Lamiroir's testimony will probably be in the evening edition, I'd imagine. Which is why I've had Daryan step down from the investigation for now.Trucy:Yeah, we ran into him moping in front of the coliseum.Klavier:Lamiroir was my invited guest, so it is a rather delicate situation... ...You understand how much I want to solve this case. Quickly, if possible.The case (subsequent times)Klavier:Ah, that reminds me, did you see the paper today?Trucy:Yes! I always read the TV section.Klavier:Good girl.

Quickly, if possible.The Guitar's SerenadeTrucy:I really love that song. It has such a great atmosphere to it.Apollo:You co-wrote it with Lamiroir, if I remember correctly?Klavier:That's right. It was last year... I had gone to tour Borginia's legal system, as a matter of fact.Trucy:And that's when you heard Lamiroir's voice?Klavier:It was at a small jazz club. ...I wept that night. I knew I had to meet her, to talk with her. So I used my influence, which is not inconsiderable, to arrange a meeting.Trucy:Wow, prosecutors really have a lot of clout.Apollo:I think he's sort of a special case, Trucy.Klavier:Thankfully, she liked the work I did, and we wrote a song right there, backstage. Machi on piano, that dulcet voice... And myself on a guitar that I borrowed from Lamiroir.Trucy:And music history was made! Probably not an experience your average lawyer would ever have. Like Apollo, say.Klavier:It is a memory I hold dear. And the song we wrote that night... was this. And that very guitar is right over there.Apollo:You mean... this charred lump?Trucy:Don't call it a lump! That's a piece of history! And it's only browned, not really \"charred\".Klavier:No matter. I shall never sing that song again. I wouldn't have used that guitar again either, even if I could have.Apollo:(What happened during that song, anyway? Why did his guitar suddenly catch on fire?)Trucy:Do you think you could show it to us? Your charred... I mean slightly burnt guitar?Apollo:I'm sure he doesn't mind. What more could happen to it?Lamiroir's guitar (appears after clearing \"The Guitar's Serenade\" Talk option and examining burnt guitar)Klavier:...It was a beautiful instrument. It was played lovingly for many years. A guitar befitting a woman like Lamiroir.Trucy:How did it end up here?Klavier:She gave it to me. I mentioned how much I enjoyed playing it that night, and she made a present of it.Trucy:So this guitar is from Borginia?Klavier:That it is. We couldn't carry it on the plane. Changes in air pressure and humidity ruin the wood. So, we vacuum packed it in Lamiroir's studio. I used a special shipping service available to me for transporting evidence. They brought it right up to my office for me. ...Pristine and untouched.Trucy:See, prosecutors do have a lot of clout.Apollo:Um, I still think he's a special case.Trucy:Such a valuable guitar... It's too bad it got burned.Prosecutor Gavin's Guitar added to the Court Record.Apollo:What was it that you were saying earlier? ...Something about intriguing results from an examination of the guitar?Trucy:That's right! What was that all about?Klavier:Well, you know how guitars have a round hole in the front? It is called the \"sound hole\".Apollo:Ah, so that's what it's called.Klavier:Well, they found something attached to the wood just inside the hole. ...A broken device of some sort.Trucy:A broken... device?Klavier:Yes. This, in fact. The examiner is busy with evidence for the case now, however. So he'll be checking this out once he's finished with everything else.Trucy:Hmm...Apollo:(Odd. That device looks strangely familiar...)Lamiroir's guitar (subsequent times)Klavier:...It was a beautiful instrument. It was played lovingly for many years.

That device looks strangely familiar...)The strange lump (appears after examining glass case)Klavier:This was found in Mr. LeTouse's bag. It's apparently a replica of something.Apollo:A replica... (It's a small lump, about an inch and a half long.)Klavier:We analyzed it... but there's not much to say, other than it's a lump of plastic. Perhaps it was to be used in the identification of whatever it is a replica of.Apollo:You mean... whatever Mr. LeTouse was after?Klavier:That seems to be the most logical explanation.Trucy:Well? Well? What is it?Klavier:Don't ask me, Fr\u00e4ulein.Trucy:Oh? If you don't want to tell us, you could just say so.Klavier:I've put in a request to Interpol via my contacts in Borginia... But, apparently there is a block on information somewhere along the chain.Trucy:Oh?Klavier:There's something either Interpol or Borginia doesn't want to share... (Changed from [Something Interpol doesn't want to tell Borginia...] in the original release) Something about this little piece of plastic.Apollo:(Mr. LeTouse went through all that trouble to become Lamiroir's manager... ...just to come to this country to find out more about... this lump? And he died for it.)Replica added to the Court Record.Klavier:I've sent someone to the coliseum to fetch Lamiroir.

Perhaps she knows something about it, being a Borginian.PresentLyrics SheetKlavier:The Guitar's Serenade... Might I ask, did you enjoy it?Trucy:It's a lovely song! I got all teary-eyed!Apollo:Ah yes, the \"cursed song that turned a concert into a tragedy\", wasn't it?Klavier:I was singing it for you, Fr\u00e4ulein.Trucy:Whoa! Th-That's so special!Apollo:...It was Lamiroir singing, actually.Klavier:I am glad you were moved. It is that kind of song.Apollo:(......Ack! I've run out of snide comments!)HeadsetKlavier:That looks like one of our tour-issue headsets. Why are you wearing it, Fr\u00e4ulein?Trucy:I thought it'd be cool! I could pretend I was concert security and stuff.Apollo:Actually, we found it at the venue and thought you might want it.Klavier:Oh, no, please, you keep it. It goes well with your cape, Fr\u00e4ulein.Trucy:Tee hee! You think?Apollo:(She does look like she belongs on a stage, that's for sure.)Remote TriggerApollo:Prosecutor Gavin, about this remote... (Wait!)Klavier:Excuse me, did you say something?Apollo:(This remote control might be valuable ammunition for the trial tomorrow! It's too early to show my hand now...)Klavier:You would think someone with such a loud voice would speak more clearly, ja?Igniter (after clearing \"Lamiroir's guitar\" Talk option)Apollo:(It has to be one of these...)Trucy:What is it, Apollo?Apollo:That \"device\" that was found in your guitar...! ...Take a look at this.Klavier:...! Why, that looks like the same thing! What is it...?Apollo:It's an igniter.Trucy:A-Another one!?Apollo:It was at the crime scene... In Lamiroir's dressing room. Detective Skye found it, actually.Klavier:...At the scene of the crime? What could that mean, I wonder?Anything elseKlavier:My apologies, but there's no way I'm going to talk details about the case with you. If you want to get my attention, bring me something... dramatic.Apollo:(I'm not here to get your attention, Gavin... ...I'm here to get your information.)Examine evidenceProsecutor Gavin's GuitarBurnt areaApollo:There's lightly scorched, and then there's this...Trucy:It's burned clean through!Apollo:Yep, It's pretty much a useless piece of junk.Trucy:...It's kind of like you after a trial, Apollo!Apollo:(Which part? The burned clean through, or the useless piece of junk?)Replica\"Sample\" labelApollo:\"Sample\", huh? Think they out a big enough label on it?Trucy:Maybe it's to keep people from eating it by mistake.Apollo:Yes, they might think it was an otherwise tasty, multi-colored lump of plastic. (Changed from [Yes, they might think it was an otherwise tasty, white lump of plastic.] in the original release)Trucy:Maybe it's the manufacturer? \"Sample Toys: When you can't afford the real thing!\"Apollo:Sounds like a company Mr. Wright would like.After clearing all Talk options and correctly presenting Igniter:Klavier:I believe that covers everything I'm at liberty to talk to you about.Apollo:Oh.Klavier:Thanks for dropping by, ...Herr Forehead.Apollo:Thanks...?Klavier:Why, you gave me so much information! That igniter, for instance...Apollo:Oh. That.Klavier:I've never met an attorney so forthcoming with the prosecution. It's a big help. ...Or perhaps you're just a tad na\u00efve, hmm?Apollo:(...I guess I could have hid it, but somehow, showing it felt like the right thing.) I could say the same... to you, Prosecutor Gavin.Klavier:...?Apollo:Thanks for the information. About the, er, strange lump of plastic. The one that Mr. LeTouse was investigating.Trucy:Hey, that's right...Klavier:I've been thinking, Herr Forehead. We encounter many incidents in our lives, all of us. Not all of them simple.Apollo:...Especially not the ones where people are killing to song lyrics.Klavier:That is why I try to at least remain simple inside. And I keep a simple goal: to discover the truth.Apollo:......Klavier:That's why I like to keep relations civil, ja? ...That is all.Apollo:...I can live with that.Trucy:Um... Mr. Prosecutor?Klavier:Fr\u00e4ulein?Trucy:Can I ask you why you sing in a band?Klavier:Ah. Because I want women to turn and look when I walk down the street.Apollo:That's pretty simple, too.Klavier:Now if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do. Another time, perhaps.ExamineBurnt guitarApollo:The charred remains of what was once a fine guitar.Trucy:Mr. Gavin got it as a present from Lamiroir!Apollo:And he had it shipped back from Borginia in a vacuum-sealed case.Trucy:Kinda sad how it ended up.Apollo:(...Not to mention there was an igniter placed just inside the sound hole. I wish I knew why...)Glass caseTrucy:......Apollo:Why the sudden silence, Trucy?Trucy:Oh, I'm sorry. It's nothing, really. I was just wondering, wouldn't it be cool if that replica just happened to vanish?Apollo:(Ah, the young magician at work again.)Trucy:Though a simple disappearance would kind of lack punch. What if it hatched into a dove? Or a person, dressed like a dove...Apollo:(There she goes...)Guitar display wallApollo:These guitars are vintage models. Probably pretty expensive, too.Trucy:They've even got little locks on them!Apollo:Weren't you good at picking locks?Trucy:Apollo! You don't want me to...? ...Well, I do kinda like that cherry red one!Apollo:I'm kidding! I'm kidding!Trucy:Oh. That's too bad.Apollo:(Sorry, my little thief in the making. Maybe next time.)DeskApollo:That's an insanely big speaker for a room this small. Oh, look... All the CDs are Gavinners CDs.MonitorsTrucy:He left his TV on. Think we should turn it off for him?Apollo:Nah, wouldn't want to make him angry.Trucy:OK, if you say so. It's kind of a waste of electricity.Apollo:You just want to play with his TV. I know you.Trucy:Tee hee! How'd you know? It's just, I've never seen a TV this big before!Apollo:I hate to break it to you, but it's actually a monitor. It doesn't play TV shows.Trucy:What!? You mean no soap operas!? No Saturday morning cartoons!?Apollo:...Nope. Sorry.Trucy:I... I had no idea.Apollo:(There, there, you'll get over it.)Reclining chairTrucy:What a cool chair! I'm going to sit in it now while no one's looking! Wow! So this is what it feels like to be a star!Apollo:(Who would have thought a chair could bring so much joy into someone's life.)Trucy:I can imagine sitting here, strumming my guitar... \"Oh, it's you, Herr Forehead. Sorry... I'm busy. Woooo.\"Apollo:You know, that was a remarkably good imitation.Trucy:Tee hee! Maybe I'll make that part of my Wonder Bar repertoire!WindowApollo:What floor are we on again? The view is incredible!Trucy:Wow! The people look like little rice grains! Hey! That one with the blonde hair! Do you think that's Mr. Gavin?Apollo:Uh... He's a little too small to see.Trucy:But look at the one next to him with the big black poof of hair pointing straight ahead!Apollo:Oh yeah, that's Daryan alright.After examining glass case in Prosecutor Gavin's Office:July 9Detention CenterVisitor's RoomTrucy:Looks like Machi is in questioning.Apollo:Huh, the police must have a Borginian interpreter. That's no fair. I wish we could talk to him.Trucy:I guess we'll just have to come back later if we want to see him.Apollo:I guess so.ExamineSecurity cameraApollo:That security camera is looking at me. Does that thing just sit there recording 24 hours a day? It must use one of those ultra-long-play tapes.Security guardApollo:A security guard. He stands here, watching this room. I think the guard is trying to set a record for the longest time without blinking.July 9Sunshine ColiseumEma:...Oh, it's you. You came at a good time.Apollo:Hello there, Ema. What's up?Ema:Either of you know where Lamiroir is?Apollo:Um... well, I saw her in the backstage hallway a while ago.Ema:Yeah? That's strange...Trucy:What's strange?Ema:I can't find her anywhere. I was supposed to bring her to the prosecutor's office...Apollo:(Lamiroir's missing!?)Ema:It's hard to imagine her wandering off somewhere on her own. ...Being that she's blind and all.Apollo:Yeah. We'll help you look for her.Ema:Great! Thanks.July 9, 4:46 PMIn the WingsTrucy:Huh? The stage is pitch dark!Apollo:The power breaker must be off for this section... Great.Trucy:I'll go get someone! Yipes, it was really dark out there.Apollo:Dark... That's all Lamiroir has, when you think about it. (What would it be like to live in a world of darkness?)Trucy:...Hey, Apollo.Apollo:Huh? What?Trucy:...Doesn't something about the stage seem different to you? Like, something's changed?Apollo:Changed?Trucy:I can't put my finger on it, but it's bugging me.Apollo:(Now it's bugging me, too! What's she talking about?)ExamineGuitar caseLeads to:\"Hey, that case...\"Trucy:Hey, that case... Wasn't that open before?Apollo:Huh. I guess someone closed it.Trucy:Wait... Look!

We have to get Ema!Apollo:(Lamiroir was taken directly to the hospital. Ema ran around, barking orders, making phone calls. Trucy just clung to my arm and cried... And me, I was still in shock. Two bodies in two days is two too many.)July 9, 5:53 PMHickfield ClinicWaiting RoomTrucy:Ema! How's Lamiroir? Is she OK?Ema:Ah, you. We all owe you a big \"thanks\", that's for sure.Trucy:So... she's OK?Ema:Yes. She came to a short while ago. You found her before it was too late.Trucy:Th-That's good to hear...Apollo:So, what happened!?Ema:Someone attacked her. ...She was struck on the forehead.Apollo:By who!?Ema:We don't know.Trucy:But they hit her on the forehead, right? That's right in front of her! How could she not see... Oh.Ema:Right. Would you like to see her now?Apollo:Is that alright?Ema:She wants to thank you for saving her life.Apollo:Lamiroir!Lamiroir:Ah, Mr. Attorney. You were the one who found me? Thank you from the bottom of my heart.Apollo:I-I'm just glad you're OK. Tell me, what happened?Lamiroir:......ExamineHallwayApollo:The door down the hall reads \"X-ray Room\". I never did like X-rays... I don't think I'd enjoy looking at someone's insides. Spotting nervous tics is intense enough.Man on crutchesApollo:That must be a recovering patient. He keeps staring at us. What's so unusual about an attorney and a magician?Reception deskApollo:A nurse watches, hawk-like, from the reception desk. She glares at me whenever I talk. Maybe my voice carries?Waiting areaApollo:Some visitors are here in the waiting room, watching TV.TV:\"...murder during a concert at Sunshine Coliseum...\"Apollo:Huh, looks like we're on the news.TV:\"...with his current hit song, \"Guilty Love\", is in the courtroom as prosecutor... ...singing the defendant all the way to death row...\"Apollo:......

When I went to return to my dressing room...Apollo:...You were hit?Lamiroir:I knew, that very moment, I knew! The assailant... was trying to kill me.Trucy:Ack!Lamiroir:It was lucky for me the first blow did not knock me out. I turned and ran for the stage. Someone was chasing me, I could hear footsteps... Yet I reached the stage first.Apollo:Why the stage?Lamiroir:I had overheard maintenance people talking. The power to the stage area was off, they said, for electrical work.Trucy:Ah...Lamiroir:Darkness is my ally. There was a contrabass case near the stage. That is where I hid.Apollo:So the assailant couldn't see you!Lamiroir:Once in the case... I'm afraid I passed out.Apollo:Wow, that sounds like a really close call.The assailantApollo:Do you have any idea who it might have been?Lamiroir:Unfortunately, no. Whoever it was, they said not a word.Apollo:Too bad...Lamiroir:Yet, when I consider that I was struck high on the forehead... I must conclude that whoever hit me was taller than I am.Apollo:Good point... (She's sharp!)Trucy:And you're much taller than I am. You're about as tall as Apollo.Apollo:So, that means it was likely an adult, and probably a man. (...Could it be him!?)Trucy:But why would anyone attack you, Lamiroir!?Lamiroir:The detective asked me this, too. And to her I gave the same answer I give you: I do not know.Apollo:Hmm...The Borginian Cocoon (appears after presenting Replica)Lamiroir:Well, they call it \"Borginian\"... It must only be found in Borginia. For certain, all in Borginia know of these.Trucy:It's a cocoon... so, do you get silk from it?Lamiroir:I do not know the details, I am sorry to say.Apollo:(I thought she said all in Borginia knew of these?)Lamiroir:There is one fact I do know about the cocoon, though. Something all in Borginia know.Apollo:...What's that?Lamiroir:The cocoons... They are not to be taken out of the country. If someone does, and is caught, they will be put to death.Trucy:T-T-T-To death!?Apollo:Why!?Lamiroir:I do not know. Yet, if Interpol was involved... ...I'm sure there is a good reason.Trucy:But this is just a piece of plastic!Apollo:He was carrying a replica... but looking for the real deal. That's my best guess.Trucy:So, that's what he was up to?Apollo:Tracking down Borginian Cocoon smuggling...Trucy:Smuggling...Smuggling (appears after \"The Borginian Cocoon\")Lamiroir:It seems I was \"marked\".Trucy:\"Marked\"...?Lamiroir:Life changed for me with the popularity of my songs. I began to travel around the world.Trucy:Ah! So you could have brought those Borginian Cocoons with you...Lamiroir:...On my trips, yes. That was probably the suspicion.Apollo:And Mr. LeTouse was placed as an undercover agent to look into it.Lamiroir:Borginia is a small, sheltered country. Not many of our people venture into the world outside.Trucy:Is that why they suspected you?Apollo:But... Mr. LeTouse wasn't a Borginian, was he. He was an Interpol agent, which means...Trucy:What, Apollo?Apollo:There must be some reason why Borginia didn't want those cocoons getting out. (Changed from [Well, there must have been some reason other countries didn't want the cocoons out.] in the original release) Something scary enough to get Interpol involved.Trucy:Huh? Like what? How could such a tiny ball of thread cause such a commotion?PresentReplicaApollo:Ah, Lamiroir, I wanted to ask you about this. Do you know what this is?Lamiroir:This... this is what?Apollo:Mr. LeTouse was carrying it. It's a replica of the thing he was after.Lamiroir:He was \"after\"...?Trucy:You know, in his secret identity! As an undercover agent!Lamiroir:...So that's what he was doing.Apollo:...! You mean, you know what...Lamiroir:Yes, I know, of course. This must be... ...a Borginian Cocoon. ...Or rather a convincing replica thereof.Apollo:(Why haven't I heard of a Borginian Cocoon before?)Trucy:Why would he be carrying this around? Was it some kind of souvenir?Lamiroir:I wonder...Anything elseLamiroir:I'm sorry, I'm not quite recovered from the attack...Apollo:(She looks like she's had a rough day... I'll just put this piece of evidence away for later.)After clearing all Talk options:Apollo:(Cocoon smuggling... And Mr. LeTouse had Lamiroir marked...

We're leaving.Trucy:Daryan! Wait!Daryan:...I never liked you. Either of you.Apollo:Huh...?Trucy:Darn it! We were so close! He was about to tell us! Hey, Apollo...Apollo:(He didn't want us to hear what Machi had to say...)Apollo:(...And I think I know why. Time to bring down a little Justice!)...BANG!...Trucy:Eeek!Apollo:Wh-What was that!????:He is heard but unseen...Trucy:Who's that talking...?Apollo:...Valant Gramarye! (...I exclaimed as he walked in through the door. Normally.) (Changed from [...Valant Gramarye! (...Using the door like an average muggle, no less.)] in the original release)Trucy:You... aren't the witness today, are you, Uncle Valant?Valant:Ah ha ha ha ha ha! A preposterous proposition. How could I stand to stand upon the stand? Why, my secrets would be free for the plucking! ...I might even have to sign autographs! That is why I intend to remain hidden for the entire day.Trucy:Ooh, with vanishing magic!?Valant:Indeed! I will jump upon an express train, and express myself to the next town over! But before I go... a word of warning.Trucy:Warning...? What?Valant:A grand Gramarye glamour resides at the root of all that has happened. Do not forget this truth.Apollo:A... glamour?Valant:A spell, a sorcery... a great illusion! ...Miss Trucy, though it pains me to part so... ...I need to get in line for a ticket. Farewell!Trucy:And there he goes.Apollo:He sure seemed happy about that illusion thing...Trucy:Oh, big illusions are the bread and butter of a magician! You can't pull off a show without one! The big illusion is always a spectacle to remember! Usually, it involves cutting up things, like people or elephants... ...or the Eiffel Tower. Anything, really!Apollo:So he was talking about what we saw at the concert.Trucy:Lamiroir's disappearing act.Apollo:And Prosecutor Gavin's exploding guitar.Trucy:I wonder what he meant by it being at \"the root of all that has happened\"?Apollo:Well, it's about time. Shall we go?Bailiff:Ah, excuse me, sir.Apollo:Y-Yes?Bailiff:The scheduled starting time for the trial has been changed. The trial will not be commencing until 10:30 AM. Sorry for the inconvenience.Apollo:Huh? Did something happen? This is a first...Bailiff:It was by the judge's request. Some urgent personal business.Apollo:(Great. I bet he stayed up too late last night, watching courtroom dramas.)Bailiff:Apparently, he's visiting the hospital again.Apollo:The hospital?Bailiff:I believe it was mentioned that the Chief Justice's son is unwell. Apparently his condition worsened considerably this morning.Apollo:The Chief Justice's son...Trucy:Oh, that's right... Remember yesterday morning? The judge said he had to go visit him after the trial.Bailiff:There's an article about it in the newspaper. If you care to read about it yourself...Newspaper Article added to the Court Record.Apollo:(\"Incuritis\"...? Where have I heard that before?)Trucy:I'll let you read that article for us, Apollo! Just leave the TV guide page to me!Apollo:...Try not to lose the page with the funnies if you can.July 10, 10:30 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:Ahem. My apologies for the delay. Court is now in session for the trial of... erm, how do you say this name again?Klavier:Machi Tobaye... our suspect fortissimo.Judge:...Right. It's his trial, in any case.Apollo:The defense is prepared, Your Honor.Klavier:The prosecution... is ready to rock.Judge:......Apollo:I-Is something wrong, Your Honor?Judge:No. Well, yes... It's just, I've been friends with the Chief Justice since we were students. It pains me to see him going through such a difficult time.Trucy:\"Incuritis\", was it? That article said there is no known cure!Klavier:Herr Judge, let me say, with all honesty, I feel your pain. But, now is not the time for tears. Now is the time... for law.Judge:...Indeed. We left off at quite the juncture yesterday.Daryan:I asked Interpol about that number. \"IPXX314206\"... The agent registered under this number... ...was Romein LeTouse.Judge:Thanks for looking into that for us, Detective Crescend. It's a great help.Daryan:Oh, no problem at all, Your Honor. ...I'll be heading out...???:Lamiroir:Wait! That voice just now... ............ It was him. I am sure of it.Judge:It was \"him\"?Lamiroir:That voice I heard, talking to Mr. LeTouse... when I heard the gunshots fired. It was him! It was Mr. Daryan!Daryan:...No way...Klavier:Quite a sensational ending. Who would have thought Daryan would guest star in the season cliff-hanger... as a suspect?Judge:I asked the prosecution to look into this matter. ...Please tell the court your findings.Klavier:Daryan Crescend is a member of my band, the Gavinners... ...He is also a detective, making the current charges serious indeed. Yet, after investigation, I have found no cause to alter our case, or file new charges.Apollo:...And your reason is?Klavier:Weren't you aware, Herr Forehead? He has an impeccable alibi.Judge:An alibi?Klavier:Let us review the facts again, shall we? The concert held on the night of the shooting was in three sets. The Gavinners ripped up the stage during the first set. For the second set, our guest took center stage... The only performers appearing were myself, Lamiroir, and Machi... ...along with a drummer and bassist, for a total of five. The shooting in the dressing room, however, took place during the third set. Lamiroir and the defendant, Machi Tobaye had left the stage at that point... ...and the Gavinners were already rocking. This is when two shots rang out at the scene of the crime. Shots heard by Detective Ema Skye, mind you.Trucy:And Apollo. You heard them too, right?Apollo:I sure did.Klavier:Furthermore, Lamiroir herself witnessed the moment of the crime... ...Well, perhaps I should say, she \"heard\" the moment of the crime. ...When she claims to have heard Mr. LeTouse and Detective Crescend \"talking\".Judge:B-But that's impossible! Detective Crescend was...Klavier:Precisely. Detective Crescend was on stage, getting his groove on, no less. Voila. A perfect alibi!Judge:Hmm. Does the defense have anything to add to this?Apollo:(It's true. When I heard those gunshots, he must have been on stage. Still, there's something here that doesn't quite add up...)Judge:...It appears the defense has no objections. I believe we can safely say that Daryan Crescend's alibi has been acknowledged.Klavier:Which means that Lamiroir was sadly mistaken. Her testimony cannot be true.Judge:Very well. Of course, if we disregard her testimony... ...then I see no evidence keeping us from declaring a verdict. ...If indeed, there are no objections?Trucy:Uh oh, Apollo! If he declares a verdict now...Apollo:(Ack! But Prosecutor Gavin's case is airtight! Lamiroir might have been lying to protect Machi! How can I rely on her testimony...? Wait... What about yesterday in the detention center...?)Machi:[Foreign text]........Lamiroir:\"About the case...\"? What about the case?Apollo:(He wants to tell us about Mr. LeTouse's death!?)Machi:[Foreign text], [Foreign text]....???:This meeting's over.Trucy:...Daryan?Apollo:(Machi was trying to tell us something, I know it! ...Maybe the best thing to do is ask him... under oath!)Judge:Very well. The court finds the defendant, er, what was his name again?Apollo:Apollo:Your Honor!!!Judge:No, that wasn't it. It was something like \"marquis\" or-- ...Mr. Justice?Apollo:Your Honor, before you declare a verdict, I would like to call another witness!Klavier:Exactly who else do you need to hear from?Apollo:A witness who, until now, has not been given a chance to speak in this court. ...Because he doesn't speak English.Klavier:You don't mean...Apollo:I do. The defense calls defendant Machi Tobaye to the stand!Judge:Wh-What!? But he doesn't speak English...Apollo:We'll use an interpreter!Klavier:Interpreter? I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere. I only speak a few phrases, such as, \"I love you,\" and, \"Where is the toilet?\"Apollo:The defense would like to request Lamiroir as the interpreter.Judge:L-Lamiroir!? But there's a possibility she's protecting the defendant...!Apollo:But she'd be interpreting for the defendant! Why would she lie?Judge:This is most unusual...Klavier:Ah ha ha... Bravo, Herr Forehead. Herr Judge! The prosecution agrees with the defense's request. If Lamiroir lies, I'll be able to tell. Even my limited knowledge of the language should be enough for that.Judge:Well, if both prosecution and defense are for this, I see little cause for refusal.Apollo:(Finally! Some progress!)Judge:Bailiff! Please show the defendant and Lamiroir to the witness stand!Klavier:I suppose there is a first time for everything. Shall we proceed? Your name, to begin with. ...If you would, Lamiroir.Lamiroir:Yes... He says, \"Machi Tobaye, the defendant.\"Judge:Hmm, this is certainly a first for this courtroom. Not that we really needed an interpretation of that message in particular.Apollo:(So far, so good...)Judge:Very well. Mr. Justice, if you would.Apollo:Huh? If I would what, Your Honor?Judge:\"Would what\"!? You called the defendant to the stand, did you not? What would you have him testify about!?Apollo:What do I want him to testify about...? (Ack, I hadn't thought that far yet!)Trucy:Apollo! Aren't you going to ask him what he was about to tell us yesterday?Apollo:How can I if I don't know what he was saying...?Lamiroir:Excuse me, a moment. If I might speak?Judge:Yes, Lamiroir?Lamiroir:Just now, Machi said there is something about which he \"wishes to testify\".Apollo:(Machi wants to testify about something? What could it be?)Judge:What sort of testimony is he talking about?Lamiroir:...One moment, please.Apollo:(Argh! The suspense is killing me...)Lamiroir:What...!?Apollo:(What? What!?)Judge:W-Well, Lamiroir?Lamiroir:According to Machi... He has \"proof of his innocence\".Judge:Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaat!?Klavier:...This is a surprise.Trucy:Yahoo! Victory, Apollo! We did it!Apollo:(This is sounding too good to believe. And I know what that usually means...)Judge:Well, if that's true, then this is vital testimony! Lamiroir... I mean, Machi! Please testify to the court!Lamiroir:\"Very well.\"Witness Testimony-- Proof of Innocence --Lamiroir:He says that word of Mr. LeTouse's death came as a great shock.But if the killing truly followed the lyrics of my song......I, that is, he, could not have done it.He says that because the lyrics are in English, he does not understand them.Judge:Hmm. I see! He wouldn't have understood the English lyrics to the song. That would prevent him from following them so closely.Klavier:I wondered what he meant by \"proof\". Why, he would only have to ask Lamiroir to know the meaning of that song.Apollo:Lamiroir! Did you ever explain the lyrics of that song to him?Lamiroir:I did tell him, generally, what the song was about. But never in so much detail. And he never asked.Klavier:Has my oft-repeated warning already fled that forehead? Lamiroir might be protecting the witness!Apollo:......Judge:Well, anyway, let us proceed with the cross-examination. Mr. Justice, if you would.Apollo:Yes, Your Honor. (Something's hidden in that testimony, I know it. I'll just have to trust my bracelet to tell me where! It worked yesterday, it'll work today!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Proof of Innocence --Lamiroir:He says that word of Mr. LeTouse's death came as a great shock.PressApollo:Apollo:Were Machi and Mr. LeTouse close?Lamiroir:Yes, after we traveled around the world on tour together...Klavier:Klavier:Lamiroir... This is Machi's cross-examination, not yours.Lamiroir:But I knew the answer...Klavier:This is a court of law. We'll play by the book.Lamiroir:...I understand.Trucy:When Prosecutor Gavin's tough, he's really tough!Lamiroir:Machi says he was very good friends with Mr. LeTouse. \"Mr. LeTouse was always a gentle man, never angry.. We got along quite well. I never dreamed something like this would happen...\"Lamiroir:But if the killing truly followed the lyrics of my song...PressApollo:Apollo:\"The Guitar's Serenade\", correct?Lamiroir:Yes. \"The crime followed the lyrics of the song...

Close. Very close. Then, I hear voice.Apollo:You heard gunshots?Machi:Yes. Is true. I hear revolver. But only sound.Apollo:Wait, you're saying you went into the dressing room... ...and found Mr. LeTouse already dead, and THEN you heard shots?

What do you know?Machi:I know if I opening vent... ...I can leave stage and back... backstage.Apollo:(So the vents went to both the stage and the backstage area?

But how did you know it was connected like that?Trucy:Wait, I bet his father was the architect that designed the hall or something!Machi:I hear this. From magician.Apollo:Magician...?Trucy:D-Don't look at me!Apollo:(A magician, huh?)Trucy:Well, at least we're clear on one thing: Machi didn't shoot Mr. LeTouse!Apollo:Yeah, but what does that leave us with? We're supposed to say he went into the room to find the body and then he heard the shots? (That one's going to go over well in court. Not.)Trucy:Apollo! You're his defense! You're supposed to believe whatever he says. Even lies! That's what Daddy always told me!Apollo:Um, I'll just pretend you misheard him. Every time.

So will he testify?Apollo:Your Honor, the defendant... will not testify.Judge:Wh-What!?Klavier:...... Shame. And here I thought this was your big chance to turn the case around.Apollo:Actually, it is. ...The defense would like to approach this case from a different angle, Your Honor!Judge:A different... angle?Apollo:(If Machi won't testify... ...then I know who will!) I would like to cross-examine the witness in this case... Lamiroir!Judge:L-Lamiroir...?Klavier:Klavier:What are you up to now? I thought we determined yesterday that Lamiroir's testimony was insubstantial! There's nothing you can--Apollo:...Lamiroir was taken to the hospital yesterday with injuries.Judge:What happened?Apollo:She was assaulted, Your Honor.Judge:Assaulted!?Apollo:Someone wanted Lamiroir dead. Thankfully, she was able to save herself...Klavier:What!? I've heard no such report!Apollo:Prosecutor Gavin...Klavier:!Apollo:Why would anyone be out to kill Lamiroir? Can you think of a reason?Klavier:W-Well...Apollo:Think of how she is known in our country... A singer, from overseas, who doesn't speak English, yes? Yet someone tried to keep her mouth shut! Who could that have been?Judge:You don't think...Apollo:I do! It was the same person who shot Mr. LeTouse! The killer was afraid of her, afraid of what she might say! The defense believes that something was hidden in her testimony yesterday. Something that the killer doesn't want getting out!Klavier:So, am I to understand that this is what you are saying? Namely, that there is a nugget of \"truth\" in Lamiroir's testimony... ...A nugget we have yet to uncover?Apollo:...Exactly.Judge:Hmm... If Lamiroir was attacked, this has serious implications! Very well... There were some vague points in her testimony during yesterday's trial. Perhaps we did not inquire as deeply as we might have into some. The court will hear Lamiroir's testimony once more!Klavier:...Lamiroir, I must apologize. We must ask you to stand again and speak.Lamiroir:You need not apologize. I know that Machi is innocent. And I will do all that I can until the court realizes this.Apollo:Let's review your testimony from yesterday. You told us you heard two gunshots and the shooter's voice through the window. ...And that the voice belonged to Daryan Crescend, yes?Lamiroir:...That is correct.Klavier:At which point I proved she could not be correct. She couldn't have heard any of those things. The small window at the scene was closed, and was found to be quite soundproof.Apollo:......Judge:...You have nothing to say to that, Mr. Justice?Apollo:I don't know exactly what, yet, but I do know there's something there!Klavier:There is, it seems, much you do not know.Judge:And yet it is my duty to hear him out. Perhaps the witness would be so kind as to testify once more to the court?Lamiroir:...Of course, Your Honor.Witness Testimony-- What I Heard --Lamiroir:I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.That's when I heard them: Mr. LeTouse and the detective.I heard the faint sound of a gunshot and stopped. Then I heard another gunshot.There was the smell of gunpowder... I knew I must tell someone, but...I was in a hurry, so I kept moving past the small window.Judge:Hmm... Pretty much the same as yesterday's testimony.Lamiroir:I am sorry. I am not used to speaking much in this language. Perhaps my descriptions are lacking in some way. Yet, everything I have said here is the truth.Klavier:Then it is my distinct displeasure to say this. What you have said to have happened... is impossible.Apollo:Do I have to repeat myself? Lamiroir was attacked because of this testimony!Klavier:...!Trucy:......Apollo:Wh-What? Trucy?Trucy:Apollo... You know, for a moment there... ...You were pretty cool.Apollo:(...Maybe I do better when I don't try to think ahead.)Judge:Very well, Mr. Justice. Perhaps you can \"coolly\" cross-examine the witness?Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What I Heard --Lamiroir:I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.PressApollo:Apollo:......Lamiroir:Is something wrong?Apollo:(I raised an objection... ...but she's saying the same thing she said before...)Judge:Mr. Justice?Apollo:S-Sorry, it's nothing. Please continue with your testimony.Judge:Hmm. Now I know what they mean about the reckless youth these days.Klavier:The one in red over there is a shining example, Herr Judge.Apollo:(You're the last person who should be pointing fingers, Mr. Rock Star...)Lamiroir:That's when I heard them: Mr. LeTouse and the detective.PressApollo:Apollo:Daryan Crescend...?Lamiroir:I did not know his name at the time. But yes, it was him, the one who took the stand yesterday.Klavier:How many times do I need to remind you that's impossible? There is no way you could have heard him.Apollo:Because the window at the scene was closed? Is that why?Klavier:Of course.Trucy:Apollo! If we keep asking the same questions as yesterday we won't get anywhere!Apollo:(She's right. Maybe there's a different angle I can try?)What were they talking about?Apollo:Lamiroir, do you by any chance remember what they were saying to each other? If so, please tell us!Klavier:......Lamiroir:I have given it much reflection, but...Apollo:(I was afraid of this. She doesn't remember...)Lamiroir:...I only heard one phrase clearly.Apollo:A whole phrase!?Klavier:You remember something that was said!?Apollo:Why didn't you say anything yesterday!?Lamiroir:Though my memory is clear, I was afraid to speak. You see, I do not understand what was said.Apollo:(This could be it! The clue I've been waiting for!) W-Well what did he say!?Lamiroir:It was the other man speaking, not Mr. LeTouse.Apollo:The shooter, then. (Daryan Crescend...)Judge:Well, what did he say!?Lamiroir:...... \"It's over. Press the switch! Now!\"Judge:\"Switch\"...? And the shooter said this to the victim, Mr. LeTouse?Lamiroir:I thought it quite strange myself, afterward.Judge:Hmm. It is a mystery.

Yet there was nothing at the scene that could be called a \"switch\". Save the lights'. [sic]Apollo:True, there wasn't a switch at the scene. But, it just so happens... I have a \"switch\" right here.Judge:That certainly does look like a switch, doesn't it.Apollo:The problem is... ...this was found not at the scene of the crime, but on the stage.Judge:The stage...?Apollo:Where the concert was held, yes. This was found hidden there!Klavier:On the stage...Judge:Are you claiming that the voice Lamiroir heard... ...was of someone commanding another to press this switch?Apollo:...It's a possibility.Klavier:Klavier:Oh, Herr Forehead? I'd call that an \"impossibility\".Apollo:...Why?Klavier:It's hardly necessary for me to remind the court of the layout of the concert forum. The stage is quite far from Lamiroir's dressing room. Not to mention that the Gavinners were in the middle of a concert on said stage. We aren't known for being a quiet band. You could shout all you wanted and not be heard.Lamiroir:The detective's voice was loud... but certainly not a shout.Klavier:So, too, have Herr Forehead's cries of \"possibility\" fallen far short of being heard...Apollo:...Sorry, but he wouldn't have needed to shout.Klavier:...Excuse me?Apollo:You heard what I said. Or... do you need me to shout it out for you? It would have been quite simple to be heard on the stage from that dressing room. Oh, wait, you like evidence don't you? How about this! Using this, it would be easy to get a message to someone on stage from the dressing room.Present HeadsetApollo:Leads to:\"Prosecutor Gavin. Perhaps you're familiar with this?\"Present anything elseApollo:Judge:Hmm. So the shooter used this to erm, get his message to the stage? Perhaps you could demonstrate how this was done for us?Apollo:...... (Um... Maybe I was wrong?) ...Sorry, Your Honor.Judge:What? I can't hear you!Apollo:(Ha ha, very funny...)Klavier:Apparently, it is easier said than done.Apollo:Your Honor! If I might show another piece of evidence!!!Judge:No need to shout, Mr. Justice. Go ahead, show your evidence.Apollo:Neither did the shooter need to shout, Your Honor. Not with this...!Leads back to:\"Using this, it would be easy to get a message to someone on stage from the dressing room.\"Apollo:Prosecutor Gavin. Perhaps you're familiar with this?Klavier:! Wh-Why that's...Judge:What? What is it!? Is that some kind of new-fangled phone they invented while I wasn't looking!?Apollo:This is a type of transmitter. A communications device.Judge:Communications? Device?Apollo:From what I've heard, that night... ...everyone on stage was wearing one of these. Isn't that right, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:Ah, yes, actually. They're for talking between band members. We all had one on.Apollo:So you admit that if you were wearing one of these... ...talking from the backstage to the stage would be simple!Klavier:Klavier:True, but wait! Those send out an electronic signal. To avoid interference with the audio systems, their range is quite limited.Trucy:Lamiroir said it was about thirty feet, right?Apollo:Look at this cross-section diagram of the concert forum.Klavier:Ah...Apollo:Exactly. The walk from the stage to the backstage seems far. But the direct distance is less than thirty feet!Klavier:That... can't be...Judge:So, when Lamiroir heard the shooter's voice... ...he could have been talking to someone on stage!Klavier:Klavier:Hah! You're claiming this is the \"switch\" in question? Why did it have to be on the stage at the time? It could be placed in a pocket and carried anywhere! Someone could have hid it on the stage after the fact!Trucy:Hey... he's got a point! How do we know where it was when she heard the voice? ...When the shooter said \"press the switch\"?Apollo:Well, I guess we don't...Judge:Hmm... An unfortunate situation. I'm afraid that until we know where this switch was, there's little point in debating it.Apollo:Ugh... (I was sure this was the way to go with this...!)Klavier:What is this switch, anyway? We don't even know that basic fact.Apollo:...... (Wait a second... I do know what this \"switch\" is! And if you follow that train of logic to its incredible conclusion... ...it ends up in proof that completely changes this case!)Trucy:What's up, Apollo? Apollo...?Apollo:We know about this \"switch\", right? We know what it is.Trucy:Y...Yeah?Apollo:Well... think of when it was used that day... Think of what happened!Judge:Well, Mr. Justice? If you have no further information to share concerning this switch...Apollo:...Your Honor!Judge:Yes, Mr. Justice?Apollo:I've been remiss in not telling the court this before. I know what this \"switch\" is.Judge:Hmm... Well, it seems the defense is set upon linking this switch to the case. Let's see your evidence of the link! What evidence do you have to explain what this \"switch\" is?Present IgniterApollo:Leads to:\"Prosecutor Gavin, you remember this?\"Present anything elseApollo:Judge:......Apollo:(...Huh?)Klavier:I fail to see how this evidence links the \"switch\" to this case in any way.Judge:Mr. Justice... Might I recommend a \"switch\" of evidence?Apollo:(Ugh... I knew it.)Judge:Once again, please!Leads back to:\"What evidence do you have to explain what this \"switch\" is?\"Apollo:Prosecutor Gavin, you remember this?Klavier:Ach! That's that...Judge:That what!? Is it another one of those new-fangled phones!?Apollo:This... is an igniter. (What phone looks like this!?)Judge:I-I-Igniter? You mean it's like a lighter?Apollo:Yes, actually.Klavier:You aren't saying this switch is a remote...?Apollo:I am. This is a remote trigger for an igniter.Klavier:What...?Apollo:Look, I'll show you.Judge:.................. Yow yow yow yow yow! Mr. Justice! You will cease and desist from burning down this courtroom!Apollo:Er, sorry. That was a bit more fire than I'd expected.Judge:If my whiskers had caught on fire...Apollo:...Prosecutor Gavin. Let me repeat myself. This switch is a remote igniter trigger.Klavier:......Apollo:Doesn't that suggest something to you?Klavier:You're... talking about what happened to me, aren't you?Trucy:Ah...!Apollo:Exactly. That night at the concert there was one unusual burst of flame. ...When your guitar caught fire in the middle of the performance!Judge:Wasn't that part of the stage show, though?Apollo:Prosecutor Gavin was entirely unaware such a thing had been planned. And the guitar that burned was a valuable keepsake.Trucy:That's right... He got it in Borginia from Lamiroir! He said the sound was amazing. Before it burned, of course. Now it just kind of smokes.Klavier:The better the guitar, the brighter it burns. Herr Forehead!Apollo:Yes?Klavier:Don't tell me you're trying to tie these two things together? Those being the shooter's voice, heard by Lamiroir... ...and the guitar suddenly catching on fire?Apollo:I am. It's really simple when you think about it. Mr. LeTouse and the shooter were at the crime scene. The shooter was wearing a headset. He ordered someone on stage to \"press the switch\". The switch was pressed, and the guitar caught fire.Judge:Well, that does seem to make sense... Though something about it is bugging me. Can't quite put my finger on it...Apollo:Really? It seems pretty simple to me.Klavier:Klavier:Herr Forehead, don't destroy what little respect I have for you!Apollo:......Klavier:I was expecting something a little more... sensible. I guess I was wrong.Judge:What's this all about, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:His simple story simply makes no sense. Think! That night, my guitar caught fire, yes. The cause... may have been this, indeed. However! The guitar caught fire during the second set!Trucy:Ack! That's right! Of course! The guitar caught fire during Lamiroir's song!Klavier:Indeed. Yet the shooting happened during the third set. The two are utterly unrelated!Judge:Hmm, yes, that must have been what was bugging me. The whole premise for this is faulty!Klavier:See? His story makes no sense.Apollo:Apollo:Are you sure about that?Judge:...! What exactly do you mean, Mr. Justice?Apollo:Maybe it's not the premise for my explanation of the switch that's at fault... ...Maybe it's our premise for the entire case so far!Judge:What premise is this, specifically?Apollo:I'm glad you asked. I'm saying that maybe the killing didn't take place in the third act!Klavier:Klavier:What's this? But Detective Ema Skye heard shots and found the body. All of this happened in the third act!Apollo:Apollo:Gunshots rang out... And, according to his testimony, Machi was in that dressing room at the time.Judge:Where are you going with this, Mr. Justice?Apollo:Stay with me, Your Honor! He also told us this in his testimony: Namely, that the victim had already been shot! We all heard gunshots... but no one saw the shooting!Klavier:This... This is insane!Apollo:Just before the \"shooting\" took place, the \"shooter\" was heard on his headset... ...telling someone to \"press the switch\"! The next moment, Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flame. We know that a remote triggered igniter was inside the guitar. From all these facts, we can draw only one conclusion! The crime did not take place during the third act... ...but during the ballad performance... The second act!Klavier:Whaaat!?Judge:Order! Order! Order! B-But that goes against the evidence!Apollo:...What does, Your Honor?Judge:This crime was carried out according to the lyrics of that song, yes?Trucy:Hey, he's right! Look! The \"bullet\" is supposed to come after the \"fire\"!Apollo:You're thinking about it the wrong way.Trucy:Huh?Apollo:Look... Why would the shooter craft the events of the day to follow the lyrics anyway? It's an awful lot of trouble to go through. ...With little merit for the person doing it.Judge:Well, I'm sure whoever it was had some reason...Apollo:Yes, they did. A reason that made it advantageous to follow the lyrics.Klavier:...You're saying the order was reversed on purpose!Judge:Hmm? Reversed, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:If the criminal followed the lyrics strictly, then yes... ...the shooting would have had to come after the guitar burst into flame. Yet, Herr Forehead has raised another possibility. He's claiming that the bullet came not after, but just before the \"fire\".Apollo:...Couldn't have put it better myself. We were only meant to think that the shooting came after the guitar burst into flame! That was the criminal's objective! The crime followed the lyrics to a point, but that was the ruse! Why else would the killer risk discovery by moving the body? That was the final touch to make us think he'd followed the lyrics the whole way!Judge:Order! Order! Order! That would explain this most unusual situation...Apollo:It does! The killer changed the order of events to create himself an alibi! In other words... The killer was someone who had an alibi for the third set, but not the second!Klavier:Klavier:I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. But sadly, it has. Let me tell you why your little fairy tale makes no sense at all.Apollo:......Klavier:Oh, it sounds good, I'll give you that. You've given us a reason why the killer bothered following the lyrics of my song. But I question your logic! ...For it's flawed from the very beginning.Apollo:Flawed?Klavier:Yes. A contradiction, Herr Forehead, one I've pointed out several times, no less. At the time of the crime, the small window at the scene was closed... How could Lamiroir have heard a voice through it?Apollo:Oh...Klavier:I know that you would like to divert our attention from this critical fact. But you're basing your entire line of reasoning on a false premise!Apollo:...... (Right... Lamiroir's testimony is my entire case... ...That voice she heard... The shooter's voice...)Trucy:W-What if she couldn't hear it, Apollo?Apollo:Look, what do we have. A man saying \"press the switch!\" And near the crime scene, we have a switch. Which acts as a remote trigger for an igniter. And last, but not least, Prosecutor Gavin's flaming guitar. (It can't all be coincidence! But how do I make it work?)Klavier:I see a more direct line of questioning is required. When the crime scene was investigated, immediately after the crime... ...that window was closed! Care to tell us how Lamiroir heard the voice?Judge:Hmm... A key point, to be sure. ...Mr. Justice! Can you explain this to the court?Apollo:(OK Justice, you've got one thing to prove, and one thing only. Lamiroir heard a \"voice\"... ...and she heard it during the second set! Think! How was Lamiroir able to hear the voice?)The window was open.Apollo:Obviously, the window was open... It had to be for her to hear the voice!Klavier:Klavier:News bulletin, Herr Forehead: That horse is dead. Stop beating it, for all our sakes. That window was closed! This is a hard fact, reported by the investigation team.Apollo:B-But...Klavier:Oh? You have evidence to the contrary, perhaps?Apollo:Well, no, but...Klavier:Then do be quiet. I tire of this charade.Apollo:(Grr... Time to rethink this!)Leads back to:\"Lamiroir heard a \"voice\"...\"She has divine hearing.Apollo:The window was closed, as you say, yet Lamiroir could still hear the voice... ...because she has the power of divine hearing! That's the only explanation!Lamiroir:......Klavier:......Judge:...The witness is a Siren, Mr. Justice. Not a Saint.Apollo:Um, I said \"hearing\", Your Honor, not \"healing\". (Well that fell on deaf ears.)Lamiroir:I'm not sure I know what this \"divine hearing\" ability is...Klavier:Then perhaps we should hear it straight from the All-Powerful Voice himself. Care to explain how clairaudience has anything to do with this case?Apollo:Uh... Erm... Can we just move on now?Judge:Only if you can enlighten this court!Apollo:(Time to rethink this...!)Leads back to:\"Lamiroir heard a \"voice\"...\"She was somewhere else.Leads to:\"When we investigated the scene, the window was closed.\"Apollo:When we investigated the scene, the window was closed. The shooter had no reason to close it, had it been open, either. Meaning, it was impossible to hear the voice through that window.Klavier:Ah, it's good to hear you making sense again. For a moment, I was afraid you might be a Borginian, too.Apollo:...As I was saying, Lamiroir could not hear the voice through that window. So there can be only one explanation. She heard the voice from another location entirely!Judge:Wh-What's this...?Klavier:Ha ha ha, you do amuse me so. And here I thought you and good sense were back on speaking terms. Now, I'm afraid you and good sense speak two entirely different languages.Apollo:......Klavier:Shall I interpret for you, Herr Forehead? Lamiroir clearly stated she heard the voice through that small window! And there is only one \"small window\" at the scene!Apollo:...Are you sure?Klavier:!Apollo:Think about it... Isn't there another \"small window\" at the scene?Trucy:Th-There is!?Judge:Ah, I know that look. He wants us to ask him. Very well. You claim Lamiroir heard the voice from another location? Mr. Justice, show us where this location was!Apollo:Lamiroir heard the voice from... here!Present air vent above ladderApollo:Leads to:\"...This is where Lamiroir heard that voice from.\"Present small windowApollo:Apollo:There! That's a small window!Klavier:And this changes what?Apollo:(Not much, I know...) ...Erm, I couldn't find anything better, so...Judge:The court applauds your honesty. And weeps for your case, Mr. Justice.Apollo:(You're not the only one crying here...)Trucy:Apollo! Think it through again!Apollo:I know... I'm trying... (Lamiroir claims she heard the voice through a \"small window\". ...And if the small window we know about was closed... ...there's only one other thing she could have meant!)Leads back to:\"Lamiroir heard the voice from... here!\"Present anywhere elseApollo:Judge:...... Does this look like a small window to you, Mr. Justice?Apollo:...The state of modern society can be read from numerous objects and artifacts. In a sense, anything can be a \"window\" on our society.Judge:I didn't ask you to point out a window on society. I want a window on the crime scene!Apollo:(No points for trying...? Lamiroir claims she heard the voice through a \"small window\". ...And if the small window we know about was closed... ...there's only one other thing she could have meant!)Leads back to:\"Lamiroir heard the voice from... here!\"Apollo:...This is where Lamiroir heard that voice from.Judge:B-But that's no \"small window\"! That's the air vent!Apollo:What did she tell us? She said she's a Borginian, unfamiliar with our language! It's not a stretch to imagine she called this \"air vent\" a \"small window\"!Klavier:Klavier:Now you've done it. You've gone beyond ridiculous and into... ludicrous. So Lamiroir was up in the ventilation system listening to this man's voice?Apollo:That's the only logical explanation, yes.Klavier:\"Logical\"? I do not think this word means what you think it means, Herr Forehead!Apollo:OK, what about it isn't logical?Klavier:Hah! It hardly merits saying! Why would Lamiroir be in the ventilation system? Hiding like a rat! No offense intended to her, of course.Apollo:The explanation for that is simple, Prosecutor Gavin. Isn't it... Lamiroir?Lamiroir:...!Apollo:You have been listening to our discussion here, yes?Lamiroir:...Yes. I admit, it's had me quite confused since yesterday. Yes, the small window was closed... ...but why should that mean I could not hear through it? I feared our prosecutor might himself need an interpreter...Klavier:Urk...Apollo:The problem here is words. Lamiroir, this \"small window\" through which you heard the voice... Was it up high, on the ceiling of the room? Not low on a wall?Lamiroir:...Yes, it was up on the ceiling.Klavier:Whaaaat!?Judge:Order! Order! I will have order!!!Judge:...Witness! You will clarify this statement to the court! Are you, in fact, saying that you were up above the ceiling of the room? And that's where you heard the moment of the crime?Lamiroir:Yes, in fact, I was. I am sorry. I never imagined it would become such an important point...Apollo:Yes, well... why the heck were you up there!?Lamiroir:......Judge:I believe it's time for another testimony.Lamiroir:I... I'm not sure I... I can't.Judge:May I remind you this is a murder trial? We will hear your testimony! Tell us why you \"witnessed\" the crime from above the ceiling of that room! ...Please.Lamiroir:......Apollo:(Well... Looks like I'm on the right track...)Witness Testimony-- Above the Ceiling --Lamiroir:Yes, I was above the ceiling when I heard the voice.I had heard there was a, er, \"small window\" there before.It was in the middle of my performance... I had no time to report what I had heard.As to why I was there... I cannot say.I am bound to secrecy on this matter.Judge:B-Bound to secrecy!?Lamiroir:In my line of work, one has many obligations to uphold.Judge:But you say you were in the middle of your performance! So this did happen during the second set!Lamiroir:...I did not witness the crime, you must understand. I only know what I heard.Judge:Yes, but you must tell us what you were doing, in detail!Klavier:That's what the cross-examination is for, ja, Herr Forehead?Apollo:...!Klavier:Our mission in this court is to discern the truth. No obligation, no binding pact, may hinder that mission.Judge:Hmm... Very well. Mr. Justice, you may begin the cross-examination.Trucy:Wh-What are you going to do, Apollo!?Apollo:...I'm going to find out the truth. (...She was up above that ceiling for a reason. I just have to get it out of her.)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Above the Ceiling --Lamiroir:Yes, I was above the ceiling when I heard the voice.PressApollo:Apollo:Above the ceiling... Could you be more specific?Lamiroir:I... cannot.Apollo:Because you're bound to secrecy?Lamiroir:Yes... To tell the truth, I was not supposed to even say I was above the ceiling. I dare not say more...Apollo:(Hmm. Doesn't sound like I'll be able to coax it out of her just by asking...)Lamiroir:I had heard there was a, er, \"small window\" there before.PressApollo:Apollo:By \"small window\", you mean the air vent?Lamiroir:I only remembered I needed to be careful of where I put my hands and feet. I cannot see the light coming through the window, of course.Judge:The air vent grate could trip you up, certainly.Lamiroir:So, I was walking very carefully when I heard the gunshots. Startled, I crouched and listened. That is when I heard his voice come from the room.Apollo:(Daryan's voice...)Lamiroir:I knew something terrible had happened, yet...Lamiroir:It was in the middle of my performance... I had no time to report what I had heard.PressApollo:Apollo:So, without a word, you just let the third set start?Lamiroir:After the curtain closed for the second set, there was still much to do...Apollo:You could have prevented this whole misunderstanding if you had only told us sooner!Lamiroir:...Yes, perhaps I could have.Klavier:I see little point in badgering the witness. What's done is done! The mind works differently when one is in the middle of a performance. Why, I've lost my voice in the middle of a show and kept on singing, completely unaware.Apollo:(Singing without a voice? ...If only all contradictions were so obvious. ...If only I could get Lamiroir to talk. Pressuring her like this doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere.)Lamiroir:As to why I was there... I cannot say.PressApollo:Apollo:You heard the gunshots during the second set, during your performance. ...You're quite sure?Lamiroir:Yes... Why would I lie about the time?Judge:Why didn't you tell us this yesterday!?Lamiroir:No one asked me. I thought you all knew...Judge:Hmrgh...Lamiroir:I told you Machi was not the killer. I told you this many times!Apollo:Yes, you did... ...But you never told us why.Lamiroir:...I am sorry. I... was not able to speak of it.Apollo:(Unable... or unwilling?)Trucy:She's not talking, Apollo. What do we do?Apollo:We'll just have to prove it ourselves. ...As long as she is bound by this pact of silence, she won't talk. But if I can prove why she was up there, she'll have to admit it.Trucy:But how are you going to do that!? She was singing on the stage, Apollo! She couldn't have been up above the ceiling, too!Apollo:Yes she could.Trucy:!Apollo:I've got a theory as to why, too...

It's all right here on this video.It wraps itself around me,And now through the air I fly.Woh... Woh...Burning on in my heart. Fire.Burn my love away. All away.Like a bullet of love. Fire.Take my life away. All away.Guitar, Guitar...Up together to the sky.Lamiroir:......Apollo:As we can see, Lamiroir was clearly not on stage for her entire performance!Judge:Ah...Apollo:Though it saddens me to be so realistic... Lamiroir is incapable of actually vanishing, let alone teleportation. So, the only explanation is that she was hidden from view. And during that time, she moved to the back of the forum.Trucy:Apollo!Apollo:Wh-What, Trucy?Trucy:It's not nice to reveal a magician's secrets! And it's against the rules!Apollo:But I'm a lawyer! I'm not supposed to be nice!Judge:This... is all very fascinating. But how is it possible? There is only twenty seconds between when she disappears and reappears! She couldn't have moved that fast!Klavier:......Judge:Is... something wrong, Prosecutor Gavin?Apollo:...This was his concert, his show. He knows how the illusion was performed.Judge:Ah ha!Apollo:He's just realizing his own oversight. Let's look at the cross-section diagram again. Here, we can trace a route through the ceiling... It goes from the stage, through the backstage to the rear of the forum.Judge:Ah... Aaaaah!Apollo:Recall Lamiroir's testimony from yesterday...Lamiroir:I was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit. There was something like a little window there... That's how I saw it.Judge:She went from the stage to the backstage exit... ...a perfect description of this route above the ceiling!Apollo:Lamiroir knew of this because of her part in the illusion. But she wasn't the only one who knew.Klavier:What...?Apollo:Just now in the lobby, Machi told me something:Machi:I know. I know if I opening vent...  ...I can leave stage and back... backstage.Klavier:He said that!?Apollo:Oh, were you not informed, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:............ I... I knew about the vanishing act, of course. Yet, I had no idea of the route that would be used. Why didn't that magician tell me!Trucy:Magicians only reveal details of their acts on a need-to-know basis. They're the bread and butter of a magician's life, you know.Apollo:(Which is why he bound Lamiroir to secrecy...) ...Well, Lamiroir?Lamiroir:...I am impressed, Mr. Attorney. Machi was right about you.Judge:So... what does this mean? Are you saying you used this route above the ceiling?Lamiroir:...I did.Judge:Well, that's that... but I'm still a little confused.Apollo:Why's that, Your Honor?Judge:As I said before... There was very little time between when she disappeared and when she reappeared. Twenty seconds, tops! How could she do it so fast? Especially if she stopped to hear the shooter's voice!Apollo:That... That's a good question.Judge:Can the witness explain this to the court?Lamiroir:I... cannot.Judge:...Very well. Mr. Justice?Apollo:Yes?Judge:It's all up to you. Do your thing.Apollo:Um, what thing, Your Honor?Judge:You need to explain how Lamiroir was able to teleport like she did. Or I'm throwing your case out with the bathwater.Apollo:Ugh... (Why do I get picked on? It's Lamiroir who isn't going along with the program here!)Lamiroir:As I have stated before... I am not at liberty to speak of the illusion that night in detail.Judge:Then, you'll just have to tell us what you can. We'll hear your testimony on this. Mr. Justice, it will be your job to wring the truth out of her.Lamiroir:Yes, if you would, please.Apollo:...Right. (I feel like a student before finals...)Trucy:Good luck, Apollo!Witness Testimony-- The Big Illusion --Lamiroir:I followed the route exactly as I was instructed.There is an emergency exit in the backstage, where a stagehand waited.From there, one can enter the forum on the opposite side from the stage.The plan was for me to move there in two minutes.I was on my way, when I heard the voice.Judge:Hmm... Two minutes, you say? The mystery deepens!Apollo:(I suppose it was too much to hope that the judge would come up with something...)Judge:As does my curiosity! Take it away, Mr. Justice.Apollo:...Right, Your Honor. (All I have to do is find the contradiction between what Lamiroir is saying... ...and what we can see plainly in the video.)Trucy:I figured it out already! I am a magician, after all.Apollo:Well, tell me!Trucy:Not a chance! I can't reveal another magician's secrets! C'mon!Apollo:(Hey! You're supposed to be on my side here!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Big Illusion --Lamiroir:I followed the route exactly as I was instructed.PressApollo:Apollo:How did you, er, proceed along this \"route\"?Lamiroir:How? Why, I walked.Apollo:But you arrived behind the forum much too fast to have been walking! Tell the truth Lamiroir... you rode some kind of vehicle!Judge:What!? A vehicle!? What vehicle?Klavier:Ah, what a novel idea. I like it.Trucy:Hey, that's not a bad guess! Wrong, but not bad!Apollo:(Hah hah, yes, laugh at the dumb attorney. I don't mind.)Lamiroir:Ah ha ha. I'm sorry, but the girl is right. That vent was much too small for vehicles.Lamiroir:It was a tight fit. Even I had to crouch as I walked. I cannot imagine a vehicle that would fit in such a small space.Apollo:(Argh! If it wasn't a vehicle what was it?)Judge:You had me going for a while there, Mr. Justice. Too bad! Ready for the next part?Apollo:(Why do I feel like I'm on some kind of quiz show?)Lamiroir:There is an emergency exit in the backstage, where a stagehand waited.PressApollo:Apollo:Did everyone on the concert staff know about the trick?Lamiroir:Not all. Only a few that were needed to help.Trucy:See? Like I said, it's on a need-to-know basis.Apollo:(So, not many people knew about the trick...)Judge:What were these stagehands required to do?Lamiroir:One needed to open the emergency exit. The door to the stairs is locked, but once through there...Lamiroir:From there, one can enter the forum on the opposite side from the stage.PressApollo:Apollo:So when you came back out, you were behind the audience.Lamiroir:Yes, that is how it worked.Klavier:Not a bad show, if I do say so myself.Trucy:That's Uncle Valant for you! The old Gramarye touch!Judge:But on the video, you were only gone for twenty seconds! How is that possible?Apollo:(That's the part I don't get either...)Lamiroir:Ah ha ha. Yes, it would be hard to go so far in only twenty seconds...Lamiroir:The plan was for me to move there in two minutes.PressApollo:Apollo:Two minutes...?Lamiroir:Yes. It can be done in one minute, if you are running.Apollo:Running? In that cramped, dark tunnel above the ceiling?Lamiroir:Ha ha, Mr. Attorney. Have you forgotten? Dark or lit, it makes no difference to me.Apollo:Ah, that's true, but...Judge:So, you're saying that on the night of the concert, you made the trip in two minutes?Lamiroir:Yes... though I nearly didn't make it in time. You see... I stopped halfway.Apollo:(Lamiroir disappears on the video for twenty seconds. But she says she made the trip in two minutes! How?)Trucy:If you want my professional opinion, I'll bet the answer's right there in that video.Judge:Well, Mr. Justice? Perhaps you have some evidence for us? Something that can explain the discrepancy between the video and her testimony?Apollo:Ack! (Evidence explaining the discrepancy...?)Present evidenceApollo:There's one piece of evidence that explains the discrepancy between video and testimony!Present BroochApollo:Apollo:Lamiroir... do you happen to remember this brooch?Judge:Ah ha! The brooch! We saw that yesterday, did we not?Apollo:It was found at the scene, Your Honor.Klavier:And you're bringing this up now... why? I thought we had already determined when that was dropped.Apollo:So did I... but we hadn't.Klavier:...!Apollo:Take another look at the video... Here, you can see she's wearing the brooch!Judge:Hmm... So she is.Apollo:Let's look a bit later.Judge:Wh-Whaaat? The brooch! It's gone!Klavier:Whaaat...!?Apollo:Yes... the brooch disappeared in the short space of twenty seconds. And it takes a full minute to run from the stage to the backstage... Which means there can be only one explanation. The Lamiroir we see before the vanishing act and the Lamiroir we see after... ...are two different people!Judge:Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaat!?Apollo:The brooch was found on the floor at the crime scene. And not just on the floor... ...but on the floor directly beneath the air vent! Lamiroir, tell me... Did you drop the brooch on your way from the stage to the backstage? ...At the very moment you \"witnessed\" the crime?Lamiroir:...Yes, I think I did.Judge:Order! P-Prosecutor Gavin!Klavier:...From your expression, I gather you had no idea this was the case, Herr Judge. I, of course, knew about it.Judge:Wh-What?Klavier:Don't get me wrong, I wasn't hiding it. It just never occurred to me... ...that the switch and the shooting took place at the same time.Apollo:So... I was right? There was a switch?Klavier:There was. Just before the stage's tower rose, Lamiroir was \"replaced\".Judge:While we're on the subject, just who was this replacement Lamiroir...?Klavier:Why, the man behind the illusion. Valant Gramarye.Apollo:(It was Gramarye...!?) That's... quite the illusion. But I still don't get one thing...Lamiroir:Yes?Apollo:...The switch happened before the tower rose, correct? So you weren't on the stage!Lamiroir:That's right.Apollo:But this, er, fake Lamiroir is still singing! And she's pretty good!Judge:That's true!Trucy:C'mon, Apollo! That's an easy one. They were just playing a recording!Klavier:Ah ha ha... The Gavinners aren't some kind of air guitar band, Fr\u00e4ulein.Trucy:Oh? You mean, I'm wrong?Klavier:When we play a show live, we play live. No recordings. ...Perhaps you can explain, Lamiroir?Lamiroir:Very well...Judge:Yes, do tell! And add it to your testimony.Changes statement from \"I was on my way, when I heard the voice.\" to \"I... had to keep singing, even while I moved.\"Present anything elseApollo:Judge:Ah ha! So this is it? The magical key to unlocking this illusion's dark secret!? Tell us how it works! Quickly! I can't bear the suspense!Apollo:(...I was kind of hoping someone else would jump in at this point.) W-Well, you see...Klavier:Klavier:Herr Judge, I do hate to spoil the mood... ...but I haven't the faintest idea what he's talking about. And neither does he.Trucy:I'm a little confused, too, there, Apollo.Apollo:...Right! By which I conclude that... I was wrong.Trucy:Better luck next time, Polly-wog!Judge:...Mr. Justice. I'm holding you responsible for spoiling my mood!Apollo:(Was that a tear I just saw in the judge's eye? ...Alright, nothing to do but rethink this through. The key's in the video somewhere. I'm sure of it!)Leads back to cross-examinationThere's no evidenceApollo:(What kind of evidence could prove that...?) Um, what's your professional opinion about this one, Trucy?Trucy:Sorry. I don't work in evidence.Apollo:And I don't work in tricks! I'm an attorney, not a magician for crying out loud!Trucy:Really? I'm sure Daddy would have loved working on this.Apollo:Thanks, that makes me feel oh so much better.Judge:Well, I don't know about all of you, but I find this mystery fascinating! And I'm not letting this trial go any further until we get to the bottom of it! The defense will continue with the cross-examination until we have some answers!Apollo:(Easier said than done...)Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after changing fifth statement)Apollo:Apollo:All made possible by the switching trick.Lamiroir:It was quite a surprise to me at first. To think, a man, posing as me!Klavier:An enchantment woven with music and magic... Perfection!Lamiroir:Yes, above all else, I was careful that the music did not stop.Lamiroir:I was on my way, when I heard the voice.PressApollo:Apollo:And it was Daryan's voice you heard?Lamiroir:Yes, I am certain it was him.Klavier:Klavier:A matter best left for later, ja? Put that forehead of yours to work on this illusion first.Apollo:Apollo:Hold on! I think the identity of the killer is a little more important, don't you?Judge:Importance shmortance! Objection overruled! Tell us about the illusion!Trucy:No use trying to avoid the problem at hand, Apollo.Apollo:(Trying to avoid the problem? This is a murder trial, the killer is the problem!)Lamiroir:I... had to keep singing, even while I moved.PressApollo:Leads to:\"You were... singing...?\"Apollo:(The contradiction between Lamiroir's testimony and the video... Unraveling an illusion can't be so different from solving a normal case... Right...?)Trucy:Sorry, Apollo. I'm not telling. Not even if you make those puppy dog faces.Apollo:(...Fine, fine.)",

So she is.Apollo:Let's look a bit later.Judge:Wh-Whaaat? The brooch! It's gone!Klavier:Whaaat...!?Apollo:Yes... the brooch disappeared in the short space of twenty seconds. And it takes a full minute to run from the stage to the backstage... Which means there can be only one explanation. The Lamiroir we see before the vanishing act and the Lamiroir we see after... ...are two different people!Judge:Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaat!?Apollo:The brooch was found on the floor at the crime scene. And not just on the floor... ...but on the floor directly beneath the air vent! Lamiroir, tell me... Did you drop the brooch on your way from the stage to the backstage? ...At the very moment you \"witnessed\" the crime?Lamiroir:...Yes, I think I did.Judge:Order! P-Prosecutor Gavin!Klavier:...From your expression, I gather you had no idea this was the case, Herr Judge. I, of course, knew about it.Judge:Wh-What?Klavier:Don't get me wrong, I wasn't hiding it. It just never occurred to me... ...that the switch and the shooting took place at the same time.Apollo:So... I was right? There was a switch?Klavier:There was. Just before the stage's tower rose, Lamiroir was \"replaced\".Judge:While we're on the subject, just who was this replacement Lamiroir...?Klavier:Why, the man behind the illusion. Valant Gramarye.Apollo:(It was Gramarye...!?) That's... quite the illusion. But I still don't get one thing...Lamiroir:Yes?Apollo:...The switch happened before the tower rose, correct? So you weren't on the stage!Lamiroir:That's right.Apollo:But this, er, fake Lamiroir is still singing! And she's pretty good!Judge:That's true!Trucy:C'mon, Apollo! That's an easy one. They were just playing a recording!Klavier:Ah ha ha... The Gavinners aren't some kind of air guitar band, Fr\u00e4ulein.Trucy:Oh? You mean, I'm wrong?Klavier:When we play a show live, we play live. No recordings. ...Perhaps you can explain, Lamiroir?Lamiroir:Very well...Judge:Yes, do tell! And add it to your testimony.Changes statement from \"I was on my way, when I heard the voice.\" to \"I... had to keep singing, even while I moved.\"Present anything elseApollo:Judge:Ah ha! So this is it? The magical key to unlocking this illusion's dark secret!? Tell us how it works! Quickly! I can't bear the suspense!Apollo:(...I was kind of hoping someone else would jump in at this point.) W-Well, you see...Klavier:Klavier:Herr Judge, I do hate to spoil the mood... ...but I haven't the faintest idea what he's talking about. And neither does he.Trucy:I'm a little confused, too, there, Apollo.Apollo:...Right! By which I conclude that... I was wrong.Trucy:Better luck next time, Polly-wog!Judge:...Mr. Justice. I'm holding you responsible for spoiling my mood!Apollo:(Was that a tear I just saw in the judge's eye? ...Alright, nothing to do but rethink this through. The key's in the video somewhere. I'm sure of it!)Leads back to cross-examinationThere's no evidenceApollo:(What kind of evidence could prove that...?) Um, what's your professional opinion about this one, Trucy?Trucy:Sorry. I don't work in evidence.Apollo:And I don't work in tricks! I'm an attorney, not a magician for crying out loud!Trucy:Really? I'm sure Daddy would have loved working on this.Apollo:Thanks, that makes me feel oh so much better.Judge:Well, I don't know about all of you, but I find this mystery fascinating! And I'm not letting this trial go any further until we get to the bottom of it! The defense will continue with the cross-examination until we have some answers!Apollo:(Easier said than done...)Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after changing fifth statement)Apollo:Apollo:All made possible by the switching trick.Lamiroir:It was quite a surprise to me at first. To think, a man, posing as me!Klavier:An enchantment woven with music and magic... Perfection!Lamiroir:Yes, above all else, I was careful that the music did not stop.Lamiroir:I was on my way, when I heard the voice.PressApollo:Apollo:And it was Daryan's voice you heard?Lamiroir:Yes, I am certain it was him.Klavier:Klavier:A matter best left for later, ja? Put that forehead of yours to work on this illusion first.Apollo:Apollo:Hold on! I think the identity of the killer is a little more important, don't you?Judge:Importance shmortance! Objection overruled! Tell us about the illusion!Trucy:No use trying to avoid the problem at hand, Apollo.Apollo:(Trying to avoid the problem? This is a murder trial, the killer is the problem!)Lamiroir:I... had to keep singing, even while I moved.PressApollo:Leads to:\"You were... singing...?\"Apollo:(The contradiction between Lamiroir's testimony and the video... Unraveling an illusion can't be so different from solving a normal case... Right...?)Trucy:Sorry, Apollo. I'm not telling. Not even if you make those puppy dog faces.Apollo:(...Fine, fine.)Apollo:You were... singing...?Lamiroir:Yes. Mr. Gavin expressed a dislike for recordings... So I used this.Apollo:Wait... so you were singing the whole time? Even when you were crawling above the ceiling toward the backstage!?Lamiroir:Why should it matter where I sing, when everywhere I go is the same darkness?Judge:B-But if you were singing while you were walking...Trucy:That's right! Wouldn't the shooter and victim have heard? She was singing right over their heads, after all!Apollo:That... is right!Klavier:...Are you sure?Apollo:You'd have to be pretty hard of hearing to miss someone singing in the ceiling!Klavier:Once again we come back to the state of the scene of the crime.Apollo:What state...?Trucy:Ack... I know what he means! That old speaker, Apollo!Apollo:The speaker!?Apollo:That speaker was blaring at the time of the murder...Ema:Ah, that's for monitoring the stage from this room.Trucy:Monitoring?Ema:It pipes in a real-time feed from the stage microphones. Useful for knowing when your set is coming up.Klavier:...Satisfied? That dressing room was fitted with a large speaker playing a direct feed from the stage. ...At my request, actually.Apollo:So Lamiroir singing in the ceiling... ...sounded just like Lamiroir singing over the speaker.Judge:Ingenious! Her voice was hidden... by her voice!Lamiroir:Ah...Apollo:Lamiroir?Lamiroir:I... have just remembered something.Judge:Do tell!Lamiroir:When I heard the noise... the gunshots, yes? It startled me, so I...Apollo:So you...?Lamiroir:I stopped singing.Judge:What...?Lamiroir:I forgot the words I was supposed to sing!!Apollo:(The song... stopped!?)Lamiroir:Thankfully, it was the very beginning of the second verse. So not many would notice.Klavier:Forehead! That mixing board I lent you! Where is it?Apollo:The mixing... huh?Trucy:That machine, Apollo! The one that breaks music into tracks!Apollo:Oh, this! I'd completely forgotten about it... Let's take a listen!Sugar, Sugar...O that night, in your embrace.When you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.Pleasure...But a fleeting melodyApollo:The song does stop there!Judge:It does? I must have missed it...Apollo:Look at the lyrics sheet, at the top of the second verse. See where it says \"Pleasure, Pleasure...\"? Now listen again!When you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.Pleasure...But a fleeting melodyJudge:...This is evidence indeed! I believe we are guilty of making a terrible mistake.Apollo:The crime didn't happen during the third set. It happened during the second, during Lamiroir's ballad.Judge:If that is true... ...then no one on stage during the second set could have been the shooter!Apollo:Which means that Daryan Crescend could have done it! He wasn't on stage for the second set!Klavier:......Apollo:Well, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:...Fascinating.Apollo:!Klavier:I don't believe I've ever seen a trial turned around quite so thoroughly. ...Yet one problem remains.Judge:What's that, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:Herr Forehead's theory does have a certain kind of logic to it. Yet it is entirely based upon Lamiroir's testimony.Judge:Yes? Is there a problem with that?Klavier:Well, it's quite simple, though it pains me to say it. What if she is lying to protect the defendant?Apollo:Apollo:But you have no proof...!Klavier:All I'm saying is that the truth is as yet unclear. ...Until we hear directly from the man himself.Judge:The man... you don't mean!?Klavier:...Yes. Though he is a friend, and band member, Daryan Crescend must take the stand. I see no other way.Judge:As... someone with a new perspective on the case?Klavier:...As a suspect, to be frank.Apollo:(...Finally! The rat's coming out of his hole! And I'm ready to catch him! Daryan Crescend, get ready for Justice!)Judge:This is as good a time as any to pause for a brief recess. The prosecution will summon the witness. Have him here and ready by the time we begin.Klavier:...I'm the last man who needs to be reminded of what his duties are.Judge:Very well, court is adjourned for a fifteen-minute recess!To be continued.July 10, 1:40 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Trucy:Apollo! I can't believe it! It really happened during the second act? A-And right in the middle of Lamiroir's performance!?Apollo:The reason why she was in that air vent... (Changed from [Why she was in that air vent...] in the original release) ...and that \"switch\" and the flaming guitar. When you link it all together, that's what you end up with.???:...I knew you had what it took.Trucy:Ah... Daddy!Apollo:Mr. Wright! You... believed in me?Phoenix:Not really.Apollo:Huh?Phoenix:I just thought that'd make a cooler entrance than, say, \"hiya\"!Apollo:...Why do I even bother hoping?Trucy:Where have you been lately, Daddy? You haven't been coming to the office at all!Phoenix:Ah, sorry about that, Trucy. I'm on a... secret mission.Trucy:Secret? You mean like, you're undercover?Apollo:Like Mr. LeTouse, only shorter and not as well dressed.Trucy:Oh no! What if you're shot, too, Daddy!?Phoenix:Ah ha ha! Would I do a thing like that to you? Anyway, I'm off for a while again.Apollo:Huh? You're leaving?Phoenix:Oh, one thing before I go.Apollo:What?Phoenix:............... Good luck.Apollo:...Right.Phoenix:......Apollo:...... Um... Is that all you came to say?Phoenix:...I think you have things pretty much under control. You'll get Machi Tobaye off the hook, no doubt.Apollo:Yeah, but...Phoenix:But you're after that detective, aren't you?Apollo:Daryan Crescend...Phoenix:It won't be easy proving he did it. Especially not under the current court system...Apollo:The current court system...?Phoenix:What did Prosecutor Gavin say during the trial? Your case is based on one fragile assumption. ...Namely, that our diva divine is telling the truth.Trucy:But what about all the proof? The brooch... and the switch!Phoenix:A piece of jewelry, and a lyrical blunder... There are plenty of other ways to explain these things. The flaming guitar, too. ...All because you lack definitive proof of their connection to the case.Trucy:But...!Phoenix:If the sultry songstress is lying... ...your case melts like butter in a frying pan. Leaving behind the faintly singed scent of failure.Apollo:So what do I do!?Phoenix:Like I said. Good luck. And be aware that it will be impossible to prove his guilt by conventional methods.Apollo:Ugh...Phoenix:Oh, that reminds me. I have something to give you from our detective friend.Apollo:Detective Skye... Ema!?Phoenix:Let's see. This bag of snacks here was meant for me... Ah, here it is.Trucy:What are those, Daddy? They don't look like very good snacking material.Phoenix:They were found at the scene. Analysis of the fragments revealed traces of gunpowder.Trucy:Gunpowder...!?Phoenix:Probably a firecracker or something similar, like the ones kids are into these days. These fragments were found under the sofa at the scene of the crime, actually.Apollo:Under the sofa...Trucy:Hey, Apollo! That's where we found that little device thingy!Apollo:Right... this. (Well, finally, some evidence that makes sense...)Burnt Fragments added to the Court Record.Examine evidenceBurnt FragmentsFragmentsApollo:So... you think this was some kind of firecracker?Trucy:Yeah, or one of those noisemakers, like you shoot off on New Years!Apollo:Did you know that in China, they use firecrackers on New Years to scare off evil? So, it's kind of same thing.Trucy:Really!? I had no idea! Well did you know this? It takes more than 500 peanuts to make one 12-ounce jar of peanut butter!Apollo:(At least my useless fact had something to do with the evidence...)Phoenix:That's all for me, I suppose. See you after the verdict. Maybe.Apollo:Right...Phoenix:Every man has an igniter inside him.Apollo:...Excuse me?Phoenix:Find Daryan Crescend's igniter... and set it off.Apollo:(And he walked out the door, just like... just like a magician. Normally.)Trucy:Uhh... What does he want us to do? No \"conventional methods\"? What does that mean?Apollo:I guess we just have to take his advice, and hope it makes sense when the time comes.Trucy:I guess...Apollo:(We're almost at the finish line. Hang in there, Trucy.)July 10, 1:55 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:...Court is now back in session. Prosecutor Gavin, where is Detective Crescend?Klavier:In the witness lounge, ready to be called at any time.Judge:Very well.Klavier:Might I add... I don't believe any of this. He... Daryan was the first detective I ever worked with. We stopped working together when he moved to Criminal Affairs, Division 3... But his guitar playing... it fires my imagination!Apollo:That's nice, but it has nothing to do with the matter at hand. ...Correct?Klavier:Oh, I know. ...Herr Forehead.Judge:Very well, call the final witness to the stand! ...Detective Daryan Crescend!Klavier:...Name and occupation, please.Daryan:Daryan Crescend. Detective, Criminal Affairs, Division 3. That's the International Affairs Division, for those of you who didn't know. ...And I'm a guitarist for the Gavinners. Maybe you've heard of us?Judge:Do you fully understand the circumstances under which you stand before us today?Daryan:Yeah, I understand, Your Honor. What I don't understand... is how you let this happen, \"partner\".Klavier:......Daryan:You gave me your word I wouldn't be standing here.Klavier:The situation's changed, Daryan... And don't call me \"partner\".Daryan:Feh. So much for old friends.Klavier:......Apollo:(I see what you're doing, Daryan. You're \"pressing\" the prosecution!) ...Your Honor, if we could begin the trial?Judge:Yes, it's high time we did. Let's hear your testimony. You may begin with your response to Lamiroir's testimony. If, in fact you have anything to say about it.Daryan:Oh I got plenty to say. Lying must be a national pastime in Borginia. ...And wherever you're from, Mr. \"Justice\". Hah!Apollo:...... (Conventional methods are out the window, huh... ...Here goes nothing!)Witness Testimony-- Daryan's Rebuttal --Daryan:The diva's lying, plain and simple. She's got nothing to back up her story.In the first place, she never heard my voice!She \"forgot the words because she heard gunshots\"? As if!Didn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?The shooting took place when I was on stage, man!Judge:Hmm... So you claim Lamiroir's testimony was a lie?Daryan:Hey, don't get me wrong, I dig what she's doing, trying to protect that kid. And she's got the court eating vague statements out of her hand just 'cause she's blind.Klavier:...You go too far, Daryan.Daryan:Look, all I'm saying is, you've got a reliable witness. Why not listen to the detective?Judge:Detective Skye...? Hmm... I see. Mr. Justice, you may begin the cross-examination.Apollo:(He didn't waste any time finding our weak spot... I can't do this with Lamiroir's testimony alone. I'll have to find some other way to prove when the shooting took place!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Daryan's Rebuttal --Daryan:The diva's lying, plain and simple. She's got nothing to back up her story.PressApollo:Apollo:You don't have any proof she was lying!Daryan:Oh yeah, kid? You saying I lied?Apollo:No! I'm just saying, uh...Trucy:Apollo!

How are you supposed to hear gunshots back in that dressing room out on stage?Klavier:Have you forgotten, Daryan?

We have a report that it was something like a firecracker.Apollo:Eh... (How did Gavin know about this...?)Klavier:What? You think Detective Skye works for you? I received the report this morning, before coming here. That's when I made my decision, actually.Judge:What decision is this, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:I registered Daryan as a witness in today's trial. ...Just in case.Daryan:......Apollo:This raises another possibility. Those gunshot-like sounds during the third set... ...could have been two firecrackers rigged to go off by remote control!Daryan:Ha ha! You got an active imagination, don't you?

Your explanation there seems a bit too convenient to me.Apollo:How so?Daryan:So, you're saying these firecrackers just happened to go off... ...right when two witnesses came walking by? Hah!Apollo:...!Trucy:That's right! Daryan was out on stage when it happened, Apollo! How would he know someone was backstage right then!?Daryan:If a firecracker goes off in the forest, and there's no one there to hear... You get my drift!

Show any weakness, and he's sure to find it.Daryan:\"He may not look it\", partner? Gee, thanks, man.Klavier:...That reminds me. I happened to pass through that very hallway several times that day myself. And I saw something odd there just before the third set.Apollo:Something... odd?Klavier:A headset. The kind all of the band and staff members were wearing.Apollo:...! (That's right! We picked this up in front of the door to that dressing room!)Klavier:What if that headset wasn't dropped, but placed? And what if it was turned on?Apollo:You could hear what was going on in that hallway! Even if you were out on stage!Daryan:Feh... Whose side are you on, Gavin?Klavier:Listen to me, Daryan. There are no sides in a court of law.Daryan:......Klavier:In any case...Leads to:\"I believe a case has been made.\"Daryan:In the first place, she never heard my voice!PressApollo:Apollo:You never talked to her, even though you were playing in the same concert?Daryan:Not a word, as far as I can recall.Apollo:But, weren't there planning sessions or something?Daryan:Gavin took care of all that himself.Klavier:...Daryan wasn't involved in any of the meetings with her.Apollo:Ugh...Daryan:As if you can just go around remembering everyone's voice like that anyway. Only an idiot would believe that!Apollo:(Lamiroir's hearing is very sensitive... She could remember him if she heard him, I'm sure of it... I just can't prove it. And I need proof!)Daryan:She \"forgot the words because she heard gunshots\"? As if!PressApollo:Apollo:We know she missed the words. The mixing board proved it!Daryan:Oh, yeah, there was a mistake. But blaming it on gunshots is just a lame excuse.Apollo:What do you mean...?Daryan:The mixing board proves what? It proves there was a mistake in the song. A missed cue. So? She just flubbed it up, big time. That's all. She spins this story about a gunshot to protect the kid... and cover for her own goof. Man, I'd have to hand it to her... if she wasn't sticking it to me at the same time.Klavier:...Daryan, watch what you say. Lamiroir is an artist. She \"just flubbed it up\"? That's no small accusation for a performer of her caliber.Daryan:Heh. She got to you, alright. I can see it in your eyes. I tell you, most of her stuff is so pretentious, it's way over my head.Apollo:(I'm detecting a rift in the Gavinners's ranks.)Daryan:Anyway, she's too close to the defendant.

Don't even think about telling me you were \"mistaken\"!Judge:Were you thinking of telling him that, Mr. Justice?Apollo:No, Your Honor. Detective Skye and I clearly heard what sounded like gunshots.

And... one more thing.Judge:What are those? The remains of something burnt? Not another guitar, I hope!?Klavier:Traces of gunpowder were found on these fragments. We have a report that it was something like a firecracker.Apollo:Eh... (How did Gavin know about this...?)Klavier:What? You think Detective Skye works for you? I received the report this morning, before coming here. That's when I made my decision, actually.Judge:What decision is this, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:I registered Daryan as a witness in today's trial. ...Just in case.Daryan:......Apollo:This raises another possibility.

The kind all of the band and staff members were wearing.Apollo:...! (That's right! We picked this up in front of the door to that dressing room!)Klavier:What if that headset wasn't dropped, but placed? And what if it was turned on?Apollo:You could hear what was going on in that hallway! Even if you were out on stage!Daryan:Feh... Whose side are you on, Gavin?Klavier:Listen to me, Daryan. There are no sides in a court of law.Daryan:......Klavier:In any case...Leads to:\"I believe a case has been made.\"Daryan:Didn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?PressApollo:Apollo:Actually... I was there, too.Daryan:So I hear. Which means you heard them, too, right? The gunshots.Apollo:Yes. We heard \"gunshots\". Neither I nor Ema actually saw the shooting, mind you.Daryan:...... Heh. I guess you and Lamiroir got the same excuse then.Klavier:We know one thing for certain here. There were gunshot-like sounds that emanated from that room during the third set. What we must determine is whether those sounds were actually gunshots.Trucy:Machi heard them, too! Remember he said he ran for the air duct when he heard them?Apollo:(So... how do we figure out just what those \"gunshots\" during the third set were?)Present Igniter or Burnt FragmentsApollo:Apollo:Some things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.Judge:What things?Apollo:The first was this small device...Klavier:...That's the remote-triggered igniter.Apollo:Correct.

For me...?Klavier:The igniter and the burnt fragments that were found at the scene of the crime... It's certainly a possibility that they were part of a ruse to fake the sound of gunshots. Throw the headset from the hallway into the mix, and you could fabricate an alibi. But we're still no closer to proving anything. Those gunshots might have been real, or fake. We can't say.Apollo:Ugh...Klavier:You've raised the possibility that the shots heard during the third set were faked. Now you need to prove the other half of the case.Apollo:The other half...?Daryan:Look, I'll just tell him.Apollo:!Daryan:He wants you to prove the thing went down in the second act... ...while our little piano player was on stage. That right, Gavin?Klavier:Indeed. If you can't prove that... ...then to continue this cross-examination would be pointless.Judge:Hmm... Well, Mr. Justice? Can you prove the crime took place during the second set?Apollo:Uh... Yeah, I think...Trucy:You'd better know, Apollo! Otherwise we're through...Apollo:It can be proven!Klavier:...You make it sound like someone else is going to come along and do it for you.Judge:Let's continue with the cross-examination then, shall we? Witness, your testimony, if you would.Apollo:(This isn't going to be easy. I need some decisive proof, and fast...)Daryan:Heh... You ready, kid?

He wants you to think the diva heard me in that room.Apollo:(Ack! I'm back to relying on Lamiroir's testimony!)Klavier:As much as I'm enjoying the Daryan & Forehead show, there is no need for such tempers.Apollo:Don't make us into some comedy duo.Daryan:This mean the Gavin & Daryan show's cancelled?Klavier:Neither of your claims can be proven... or disproved. We could argue for days like this and get nowhere.Judge:Prosecutor Gavin is quite right. This court will hear no further discussion on this topic without new facts.Apollo:(New facts, huh...?)Present Mixing BoardApollo:Apollo:Remember this, Detective Crescend?Daryan:...The mixing board? What about it!?Apollo:...It seems there was clear proof left behind. ...Right here in Lamiroir's song.Daryan:Her song...!?Judge:What exactly is this, erm, device thingy?

Don't even think about telling me you were \"mistaken\"!Judge:Were you thinking of telling him that, Mr. Justice?Apollo:No, Your Honor. Detective Skye and I clearly heard what sounded like gunshots.

We have a report that it was something like a firecracker.Apollo:Eh... (How did Gavin know about this...?)Klavier:What? You think Detective Skye works for you?

Show any weakness, and he's sure to find it.Daryan:\"He may not look it\", partner? Gee, thanks, man.Klavier:...That reminds me. I happened to pass through that very hallway several times that day myself. And I saw something odd there just before the third set.Apollo:Something... odd?Klavier:A headset. The kind all of the band and staff members were wearing.Apollo:...! (That's right! We picked this up in front of the door to that dressing room!)Klavier:What if that headset wasn't dropped, but placed? And what if it was turned on?Apollo:You could hear what was going on in that hallway! Even if you were out on stage!Daryan:Feh... Whose side are you on, Gavin?Klavier:Listen to me, Daryan. There are no sides in a court of law.Daryan:......Klavier:In any case...Leads to:\"I believe a case has been made.\"Daryan:In the first place, she never heard my voice!PressApollo:Apollo:You never talked to her, even though you were playing in the same concert?Daryan:Not a word, as far as I can recall.Apollo:But, weren't there planning sessions or something?Daryan:Gavin took care of all that himself.Klavier:...Daryan wasn't involved in any of the meetings with her.Apollo:Ugh...Daryan:As if you can just go around remembering everyone's voice like that anyway. Only an idiot would believe that!Apollo:(Lamiroir's hearing is very sensitive... She could remember him if she heard him, I'm sure of it... I just can't prove it. And I need proof!)Daryan:She \"forgot the words because she heard gunshots\"? As if!PressApollo:Apollo:We know she missed the words. The mixing board proved it!Daryan:Oh, yeah, there was a mistake. But blaming it on gunshots is just a lame excuse.Apollo:What do you mean...?Daryan:The mixing board proves what? It proves there was a mistake in the song. A missed cue. So? She just flubbed it up, big time. That's all. She spins this story about a gunshot to protect the kid... and cover for her own goof. Man, I'd have to hand it to her... if she wasn't sticking it to me at the same time.Klavier:...Daryan, watch what you say. Lamiroir is an artist. She \"just flubbed it up\"? That's no small accusation for a performer of her caliber.Daryan:Heh. She got to you, alright. I can see it in your eyes. I tell you, most of her stuff is so pretentious, it's way over my head.Apollo:(I'm detecting a rift in the Gavinners's ranks.)Daryan:Anyway, she's too close to the defendant. Her testimony can't be trusted. You ask me, I'd go with Detective Skye's story at the drop of a pick.Present Mixing Board (if Igniter or Burnt Fragments was presented on fourth statement)Apollo:Apollo:...It seems there was clear proof left behind. ...Right here in Lamiroir's song.Daryan:Her song...!?Judge:What exactly is this, erm, device thingy?

This device was used to record the performance part by part.Judge:Part...?Klavier:You move the sliders to adjust the volume. Each instrument is adjustable separately. Lamiroir's voice included.Judge:Ho hoh! ...But what does this prove?Apollo:According to Lamiroir's testimony... At the moment of the shooting, she forgot the words to the song.Klavier:Ah... You intend to examine the recording at that moment, ja? We might even hear those gunshots!Apollo:...Exactly.Daryan:Hah! Ridiculous. How are you supposed to hear gunshots back in that dressing room out on stage?Klavier:Have you forgotten, Daryan? We were all wearing these headsets.Daryan:Oh...Klavier:We were all deeply involved in our performance... ...but Lamiroir's headset would've picked up what she heard all the same.Judge:Then let's get to analyzing that recording! ...Right now!Apollo:(Lamiroir stopped singing when she heard the shots fired...

For me...?Klavier:The igniter and the burnt fragments that were found at the scene of the crime... It's certainly a possibility that they were part of a ruse to fake the sound of gunshots. Throw the headset from the hallway into the mix, and you could fabricate an alibi. But we're still no closer to proving anything. Those gunshots might have been real, or fake. We can't say.Apollo:Ugh...Klavier:You've raised the possibility that the shots heard during the third set were faked. Now you need to prove the other half of the case.Apollo:The other half...?Daryan:Look, I'll just tell him.Apollo:!Daryan:He wants you to prove the thing went down in the second act... ...while our little piano player was on stage. That right, Gavin?Klavier:Indeed. If you can't prove that... ...then to continue this cross-examination would be pointless.Judge:Hmm... Well, Mr. Justice? Can you prove the crime took place during the second set?Apollo:Uh... Yeah, I think...Trucy:You'd better know, Apollo! Otherwise we're through...Apollo:It can be proven!Klavier:...You make it sound like someone else is going to come along and do it for you.Judge:Let's continue with the cross-examination then, shall we?

'Cause I am.Changes statement from \"Didn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?\" to \"The shooting took place during the second set? If you're so sure, let's see your proof.\"Removes statement \"The shooting took place when I was on stage, man!\"Daryan:The shooting took place when I was on stage, man!PressApollo:Apollo:That could have been what the shooter wanted us to think!Daryan:I'll tell you what the shooter, that kid, wants you to think. He wants you to think the diva heard me in that room.Apollo:(Ack! I'm back to relying on Lamiroir's testimony!)Klavier:As much as I'm enjoying the Daryan & Forehead show, there is no need for such tempers.Apollo:Don't make us into some comedy duo.Daryan:This mean the Gavin & Daryan show's cancelled?Klavier:Neither of your claims can be proven... or disproved. We could argue for days like this and get nowhere.Judge:Prosecutor Gavin is quite right. This court will hear no further discussion on this topic without new facts.Apollo:(New facts, huh...?)Present Mixing BoardApollo:Apollo:Remember this, Detective Crescend?Daryan:...The mixing board? What about it!?Apollo:...It seems there was clear proof left behind. ...Right here in Lamiroir's song.Daryan:Her song...!?Judge:What exactly is this, erm, device thingy?

But why did we only hear one gunshot on the recording? Weren't two bullets fired from this weapon?Apollo:Lamiroir was moving through the air vent, Your Honor. She must not have been close enough for her mic to catch the first shot. But then, as she passed over the dressing room... ...the gun fired again, and Mr. LeTouse's life was taken. Well, Detective Crescend?Daryan:......Klavier:Ah, once again I am reminded of something.Apollo:...?Klavier:Our performance that day...Judge:Your performance?Klavier:Seeing the mixing board jogged my memory. You were there, too, Herr Forehead.Klavier:What is it with today!? Problem after problem! Achtung! My hog won't start. My guitar case is busted... ...my guitar's been burnt to a crisp, and to top it all off, someone's dead! ...And then there was that performance just now. What was that all about!?Apollo:This part is off.Klavier:Which is that? Hmm... 2nd Guitar.Daryan:Ah.Klavier:It was you Daryan!Klavier:...I thought it strange at the time. How could you miss such a simple cue? I know you, I know how you play. You're better than that.Daryan:Yeah, well, I...Judge:You what? And Prosecutor Gavin, what are you getting at?Klavier:I'm talking about the murder weapon. Mr. LeTouse's 45-caliber hand cannon. As we have learned, even the shooter doesn't go unscarred with a revolver that size. The kickback is enough to dislocate your shoulder, if you're an amateur.Apollo:Wait...! You mean his playing was affected because he hurt himself shooting that revolver?Daryan:Hah! You're forgetting something.Judge:Yes, Detective Crescend...?Daryan:I am a trained police officer, you know. I've had firearms training. Plenty of it. I'm no amateur.Klavier:The standard sidearm issued to police officers is a 38-caliber weapon. A much tamer beast. Also, the murder weapon belonged to the victim, Mr. LeTouse. ...Which suggests there was a struggle between killer and victim.Judge:So... the killer might not have been holding the revolver correctly when he fired! Is that what you mean!?Klavier:...The thought had occurred to me, yes.Judge:Well, does the witness have anything to say to this?Daryan:......Judge:Detective Crescend!!!Daryan:What I want to ask is what Mr. Sleeves-rolled-up-ready-for-action has to say. Hey, you. Attorney.Apollo:Me?Daryan:Exactly which piece of your evidence is decisive, again? You got a little noise on a tape that could be anything. And you have an alleged guitar cue miss due to a 45-caliber kickback. I weep for this case, Gavin, I really do.Klavier:......Daryan:You can line up your little weak pieces of evidence all you want. I didn't shoot that manager. And that's the obvious truth.Judge:Hmm... The witness has a point. The defense's arguments, while persuasive, are not decisive. I believe we should hear what the witness has to say in response to the case so far. ...Your testimony, please, Detective Crescend. Tell us your reasons why you couldn't have done it!Witness Testimony-- Proof of Innocence --Daryan:C'mon! Why would I even want to kill that manager?You want a reason? Easy. I got no motive, man!This was that diva's first trip to this country, right?How could I possibly know her manager?If I didn't know him, why would I want to kill him!?Judge:Hmm. A simple reason, indeed. Prosecutor Gavin. Is it the case that Mr. LeTouse had not been to our country before?Klavier:According to our records... Yes. Not even once.Judge:I see... Very well! Mr. Justice, you may begin the cross-examination.Apollo:(Great, now I need to find a motive...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Proof of Innocence --Daryan:C'mon! Why would I even want to kill that manager?PressApollo:Apollo:Her manager, sure, but Mr. LeTouse was...Daryan:Oh, right. Sorry. An Interpol agent, wasn't he?

Well, Detective Crescend?Daryan:Heh heh heh. That's your game, is it? Guess I'd better confess, then.Judge:\"Confess\"...!?Daryan:Yeah.

Detective Crescend. ...Ever seen this?Daryan:...Looks like a piece of candy.Apollo:What it is... is evidence. Don't lick it before you try it.Daryan:......Apollo:Specifically, this is a replica of a cocoon... ...It was found among the victim's belongings.Judge:A cocoon? Never seen one that color.Klavier:It is a variety only found in the Republic of Borginia. Nowhere else.Judge:Alright... But what is this cocoon replica doing in my courtroom? Surely, this has nothing to do with a motive for killing Mr. LeTouse! ...Does it?Apollo:It does! ...Wait! I mean, I think it does.Daryan:...You don't sound so confident, man.Judge:A cocoon... Is it one of those silky cocoons? The kind that you can make, well, silk out of?Apollo:...Not this one. This cocoon makes a powerful \"curative\".Judge:A curative? For what...?Klavier:Apparently, it is most efficacious at treating a disease thought incurable. It is the only medicine of its kind. ...However, it is illegal to take one of these healing cocoons out of Borginia.Judge:Whatever for? If it's such a miracle cure, why not share it with the world?Trucy:Yeah, that's what I've been wondering!Klavier:We looked into the matter at some length. Apparently, it isn't difficult at all to manufacture the remedy from the cocoon. Yet, if you change the process only slightly... ...you can easily make a large quantity of something else entirely. ...A deadly poison, in fact.Judge:Wh-What!?Klavier:There was an incident, several years ago, where some of these got out onto the black market. It caused quite the commotion in the global community. Though the media was kept largely unaware.Judge:Hmm... Intriguing!Klavier:All this has led to a strict ban on the cocoons' export. One rigidly enforced... by Interpol, among others.Judge:Interpol...Apollo:Right! The victim, Romein LeTouse, was an Interpol agent. Detective Crescend! You insist on referring to him as a \"manager\"... But that is misleading! Romein LeTouse wasn't killed as a manager! He was killed as an undercover agent!Daryan:...... So I was trying to smuggle this gumball into the country? That what you're trying to say?Apollo:I'm saying that could well be a motive for murder.Daryan:Oh, so I was going to sell it on the black market, make myself a pretty penny? ...Ridiculous. I mean, totally unthinkable.Apollo:\"Unthinkable\", you say? Why?Judge:Perhaps it's time for another testimony... ...about this \"smuggling of cocoons\" business!Witness Testimony-- Cocoon Smuggling --Daryan:International Affairs got a memo about these cocoons.Interpol's all hot and bothered about 'em.Can't sell 'em on the black market. Too dangerous.Yeah, cocoon smuggling ain't exactly lucrative anymore.Man, I'm in International Affairs! I know the deal!Judge:Indeed... Interpol wanted these cocoons bad enough to send Mr. LeTouse undercover.Daryan:You kids think up the craziest things... But no way am I going to risk life and limb... ...just to get my hands on some dirty cocoon money!Judge:Not the most noble of statements, but duly noted.Klavier:According to reports, these cocoons top Interpol's list. Selling them to an underground organization would be risky.Judge:Hmm... Very well, you may begin the cross-examination.Apollo:(This is the only motive I've got... He was up to something, and I'm going to find out what!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Cocoon Smuggling --Daryan:International Affairs got a memo about these cocoons.PressApollo:Apollo:That memo! That's how you knew about the cocoons!Daryan:Oh, nice one, nice one! I'm runnin' scared now!Apollo:You had to know about the cocoons to plan this.Judge:Just how well known are these cocoons? I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I'd never heard of them.Apollo:Well, Lamiroir knew about them, though not their use.Klavier:My reports indicate that there are ongoing efforts to control information about the cocoons. Most people only know they're illegal to export, that's all.Judge:Then... I've nothing to be embarrassed about after all!Daryan:You could say people like me who know about them are a minority, yeah. But that includes everyone in International Affairs, man! And everyone in Interpol, too, for that matter. Yeah...Daryan:Interpol's all hot and bothered about 'em.PressApollo:Apollo:So there are other Interpol agents like Mr. LeTouse?Daryan:All over the world, likely. Deep undercover, most of 'em. That's why these cocoons are too hot for the black market. You don't want Interpol sniffing through your wares. Most came to the conclusion that...Daryan:Can't sell 'em on the black market. Too dangerous.PressApollo:Apollo:Dangerous...?Daryan:Yeah, Interpol finds you, they arrest you on the spot. Or another marketeer might think you're part of a sting and take you out himself. Times have changed...Present Newspaper ArticleApollo:Apollo:...Why not choose a less dangerous buyer then? I would.Daryan:How clueless are you? Everyone in the market's dangerous! The second they found out I was a cop, I could kiss my keester goodbye.Apollo:Why sell to a black market buyer? How about someone... like this!?Judge:That article... That's about the Chief Justice's...Apollo:A deadly poison can be extracted from the cocoon. But so can a cure! And not a cure for just any disease... ...A cure for Incuritis!Judge:I-Incuritis! ...I've heard of that somewhere!Apollo:(You went to visit a victim of the disease this morning!)Judge:Aha! Why, that's the disease the Chief Justice's son has! You aren't saying...!Apollo:Our witness is a detective. He would have contact with the Chief Justice!Judge:You are saying! The Chief Justice would never deal in contraband!Apollo:...Not even to save his own son's life?Judge:...! But, even if the deal went through... Why it'd be an international scandal!Apollo:That's Detective Crescend's insurance! If word ever got out, the one with his neck on the line... ...would be the Chief Justice!Daryan:......Judge:Detective Crescend! Is this true!?Daryan:First I'm a murderer, now I'm a smuggler...? How many crimes are you trying to pin on me, anyway?Judge:Distasteful as it is to think about, if the Chief Justice were the buyer... ...why, a seller couldn't hope for a better deal. A very cowardly seller!Daryan:Don't let Sleeves over there trick you. So I made a deal with the Chief Justice? Where's your proof!?Apollo:W-Well...Daryan:Oh yeah, and you're forgetting one other important thing.Apollo:...Do tell.Daryan:Interpol isn't the only ones out there watching this. Borginian Customs barely sleeps, they're so worried about cocoons getting out.Judge:Hmm... So we were informed. Let's continue with the cross-examination.Changes statement from \"Can't sell 'em on the black market. Too dangerous.\" to \"Borginian Customs is very thorough.

They were even confiscating gumdrops and marshmallows.Judge:Yes... it would be hard to distinguish them.Apollo:(That's right. Gavin was in Borginia, wasn't he.)Klavier:I remember setting off the metal detectors several times. I had to practically strip naked to walk through.Apollo:(Here's a travel tip for you, Gavin: leave the bling at home, you glimmerous fop.)Present Prosecutor Gavin's GuitarApollo:Leads to:\"Actually, there is one way.\"Daryan:Yeah, cocoon smuggling ain't exactly lucrative anymore.PressApollo:Apollo:But, wouldn't scarcity drive up prices?Daryan:Yeah, and attention.

Truth is, they're beyond hard core with security.Klavier:The Republic of Borginia is a peaceful, pleasant country. So this level of security shows us how truly concerned they are about these cocoons.Daryan:That's the situation...Daryan:Man, I'm in International Affairs! I know the deal!PressApollo:Apollo:Which is why you'd know how to find a loophole in the system!Daryan:Hey... You can say what you want about me, but back off of International Affairs! There ain't no \"loopholes\", OK? What do you think we are, boy scouts?Apollo:That wasn't what I was trying to... um...Klavier:Down, Daryan. ...It's as you say. There are no loopholes, at least in the case of these cocoons. International Affairs, Interpol, and Borginian Customs are all watching.Daryan:See, we know what we're doing!

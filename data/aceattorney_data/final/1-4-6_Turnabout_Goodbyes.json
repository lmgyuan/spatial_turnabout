You can't imagine how much I've suffered...You... suffered?And now... the perfect opportunity presents itself. At last... I shall have my revenge!What!?...Merry Christmas.December 25, 10:08 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:Hey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?Phoenix:Waterfalls...? Dare I ask why?Maya:Duh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!Phoenix:... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?Maya:Of course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!Phoenix:Umm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...Maya:Oh. Darn.Phoenix:Sorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?Maya:... Good idea!Phoenix:(So much for the rushing spring waters...)TV:Next in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it \"Gourdy\" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ...Phoenix:*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?Maya:Nick?Phoenix:?Maya:The water pressure's kind of low in that shower.Phoenix:... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?Maya:... Good idea, Nick!Phoenix:(Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) (Changed from [Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...] in the original release)TV:We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder!Phoenix:(Gourd Lake again?)TV:The body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away?Phoenix:(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--Maya:Nick?Phoenix:Yipes! M-Maya!Maya:The fireman yelled at me when I called him.Phoenix:We've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!Maya:What? You mean, the prosecutor?Phoenix:Yeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!Maya:Whaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?Phoenix:I-I don't know!Maya:Let's go find out, Nick!ExamineBookshelfPhoenix:Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.Charley the plantPhoenix:Mia's favorite plant. Its name is \"Charley.\" Maya's gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley's been perking up these days.DeskPhoenix:Mia's desk. If we had more clients, I would probably sit here more often. Lately, I've been spending more time on the couch, watching TV.Movie posterPhoenix:Maya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day. We had a big fight over whether to put it up or not. I know she's just waiting for a chance to sneak it up on the wall.WindowPhoenix:Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. I can see the bellboy, getting the angle of that screwdriver in the drawer just right.TalkWhat to doPhoenix:Well, what should we do?Maya:What do you mean!? Let's investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene!Phoenix:(You're right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!)Any ideasPhoenix:Well? Got any good ideas?Maya:Not really. I do my best thinking when I'm standing underneath a waterfall.PresentAttorney's BadgePhoenix:You know, I think it's developing a nice luster.Maya:I'll look at your badge later, Nick. We've got work to do!Phoenix:(I suppose you're right...)December 25Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:You know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?Phoenix:I guess it comes with the territory.Maya:I'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!Phoenix:... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!Edgeworth:What are you doing here!?Maya:Nick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.Phoenix:Well, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?Edgeworth:So, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?Maya:Nick... Should we be laughing?Phoenix:Nah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.Edgeworth:... Yes you do.Phoenix:(Actually, he's right.)Edgeworth:... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.Phoenix:(I didn't want to see you like this, either. Believe me.) (Changed from [Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.] in the original release)ExamineSurveillance cameraPhoenix:Smile for the camera...Security guardPhoenix:This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room.TalkWhat happenedPhoenix:Edgeworth. Tell me what happened.Edgeworth:... Why should I? What are you going to do about it?Maya:Duh! We're going to help you, that's what!Edgeworth:...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous.Phoenix:Sorry...?Edgeworth:You're a novice! You've only been in three trials!Phoenix:H-hey!Edgeworth:Sure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience!Phoenix:...Maya:Nick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!?Gourd LakePhoenix:The murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct?Edgeworth:Yes... late last night.Phoenix:The lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there?Edgeworth:... I see no need to tell you.Maya:M-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...?Edgeworth:... Gourdy.Maya:Huh?Edgeworth:I went to see Gourdy.Maya:\"Gourdy\"? What's that!?Phoenix:I'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?)Did you do it (appears after \"What happened\", \"Gourd Lake\", and presenting Attorney's Badge)Phoenix:Edgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right?Edgeworth:... Think what you will. I have only one request.Phoenix:Huh?Edgeworth:Stay out of this case.Maya:Why!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!Edgeworth:I know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay?Maya:!!! Why not?Edgeworth:... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!Maya:Nick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he.Phoenix:Maya! Let's go investigate elsewhere.Maya:But, Nick...PresentAttorney's BadgeEdgeworth:Your attorney's badge...?Phoenix:Edgeworth. Let me defend you.Edgeworth:... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet.Maya:Wh-what do you mean by that?Edgeworth:Me? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!Maya:Wh-what!?Edgeworth:My case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down.Phoenix:What?Edgeworth:Simply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared \"guilty.\"Phoenix:I don't believe it!Edgeworth:Regardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this.December 25Gourd Lake ParkEntranceMaya:This is where it happened?Phoenix:Yeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.Maya:I can see some police walking around in there.Phoenix:Questioning people, probably.Maya:Hey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?Gumshoe:Well, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?Police:S-sorry, sir... Nothing.Gumshoe:Idiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!Police:B-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--Gumshoe:Shaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... I'll... I'll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal! (Changed from [I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!] in the original release)Police:Y-yes, sir!Maya:Detective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!Gumshoe:Recruits... peh! ... Aah!Maya:Eek!Gumshoe:Hey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!Phoenix:Wright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)Gumshoe:And just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?Phoenix:Huh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.Gumshoe:Well, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!Maya:He seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...Gumshoe:Huh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...ExamineTreesPhoenix:I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?Maya:I don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.Phoenix:(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)SignPhoenix:The sign says \"Gourd Lake Nature Park.\" This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend.Maya:But... no waterfall.Phoenix:Not many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya.TalkWhat happenedPhoenix:Detective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?Gumshoe:Huh? You don't know, pal?Phoenix:No...Gumshoe:Wow, okay, Mr. Head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.Phoenix:Head-in-the... huh?Gumshoe:Never mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol.Maya:And... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?Gumshoe:A cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.Maya:How did they get there so fast? (Changed from [How did he get there so fast?] in the original release)Gumshoe:Well... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake.Phoenix:A witness?EdgeworthMaya:You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer, do you!? (Changed from [You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?] in the original release)Gumshoe:Absolutely not! It's impossible! I don't care if there's a witness either! I don't believe a lick of it!Maya:R-right! Who cares what the witness says!Phoenix:(I care!)Maya:... You really believe in him, don't you, Detective?Gumshoe:Course I do! But... the police are pretty sure he's the killer. Nobody's even really taking this investigation that seriously.Maya:Oh no!Gumshoe:After all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one's standing up to take his side.Maya:Well, at least you are, Detective. At least you are.Defense requestMaya:Do you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth's defense attorney in tomorrow's trial?Gumshoe:He hasn't got one yet.Maya:What? The trial IS tomorrow, isn't it?Gumshoe:Well, I don't know the whole story... But apparently no one he's been talking to will take his case.Maya:W-why not?Gumshoe:Mr. Edgeworth won't tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he'd asked you to defend him.Phoenix:U-unfortunately not...Gumshoe:Well, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn't just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you're an attorney!Defense request (after presenting Attorney's Badge in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)Maya:I-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case?Gumshoe:Yeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid.Phoenix:(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)Gumshoe:Hey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai case? (Changed from [Remember the Steel Samurai!] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!Phoenix:I... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said.Gumshoe:What!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after that trial! (Changed from [You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case!] in the original release) He kept saying \"Wright, Wright, Wright,\" over and over.Maya:... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign.Phoenix:Neither am I...Gumshoe:Why wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it.The witness (appears after \"What happened\")Phoenix:Who was this witness?Gumshoe:Er, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow.Phoenix:Was there only that one witness?Gumshoe:Yep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty...Maya:Oh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick?Phoenix:Talk to Santa.PresentAttorney's BadgeGumshoe:That badge! You're showing that to the wrong guy, pal! You gotta show that to someone who needs it!After clearing all Talk options:Police:Detective Gumshoe, sir!Gumshoe:What? Find something!?Police:Um, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing...Gumshoe:A briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?The autopsy reportMaya:Well, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...?Gumshoe:Sorry... They haven't worked up the autopsy report yet. I'm still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal!Leads to:\"You're not coming back, Detective?\"How to get in touch with youLeads to:\"You're not coming back, Detective?\"Phoenix:You're not coming back, Detective?Gumshoe:Erm... Probably not, pal.Phoenix:So, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?Gumshoe:Ah, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.Detective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station.Phoenix:Oh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:W-what!?Phoenix:Um, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?Gumshoe:Yeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.Maya:You know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy.Phoenix:Yeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...Maya:Right! Now, let's get investigating!December 25Police DepartmentCriminal AffairsMaya:... Looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here.Chief:Something wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in? Okay, what did you do? Shoplifting? Larceny? Public indecency...?Maya:N-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around?Chief:Gumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon.Maya:Okay, we'll come back.Chief:You do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that?Maya:... Do I look like a criminal or something?ExaminePosterPhoenix:A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad.DetectivePhoenix:That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.Police:\"...your mama could see you know she'd be crying'... ...a break and spit it out, you lowlife scumbag...\"Phoenix:... He must be doing image training for interrogations.DeskPhoenix:These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.Blue BadgerPhoenix:Hey, is that the police department's mascot...?Chief:That's the \"Blue Badger\"! It was my idea! I made it! It's my mascot!Phoenix:I... see. How nice.Chief:I'll get him assigned mascot of the Criminal Affairs Dept. if it's the last thing I do!Phoenix:Um, good luck!ChiefPhoenix:This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.Chief:Wha...!? \"Gourd Lake...!\" \"Gourdy sighted\"!!! I don't believe it!Phoenix:(Shouldn't you be reading something more important...?)December 25Gourd LakePublic BeachMaya:Wowsers! This is \"Gourd Lake\"?Phoenix:Yup. I'm not sure it warrants a \"wowsers,\" though.Maya:Hmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!Phoenix:\"Samurai Dogs\"...?Maya:I wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great!Phoenix:With a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?Maya:They're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into \"The Pink Princess\" now. I mean, like, y'know!?Phoenix:(Nope.)ExamineLakeMaya:Wow. Gourd Lake is really big.Phoenix:Yeah.Maya:Say, Nick. Why is it called \"Gourd Lake\"?Phoenix:Oh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here.Maya:Whoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape?Phoenix:Well, it is shaped like a gourd, actually. But that's just a coincidence.Maya:Oh. Okay.Trash canPhoenix:The trashcan is empty. At least the place is well maintained.BenchPhoenix:A lineup of plastic benches. I guess the idea is you buy a dog and eat it here. I doubt anyone would sit here and eat on a day like this. Except maybe Maya... if she had a Samurai Dog.SignPhoenix:Huh... I almost didn't see that signpost. \"Left - Boat docks\" \"Right - Exit\"Vendor standPhoenix:A hotdog stand. It's closed... The Christmas fringe looks a little half-baked. The banner reads \"Samurai Dogs\"... Somebody needs to redecorate.PopperMaya:Huh. Someone left some poppers here. You know, you pull the string... (Changed from [Huh. Someone left one of those poppers here. You know, you pull the string...] in the original release)Phoenix:...And it goes \"pop.\" Yeah, I know the ones. You see them a lot around New Year's.Maya:Hey, Nick! They might be a clue! (Changed from [Hey, Nick! It might be a clue!] in the original release) Let's take them. (Changed from [Let's take it.] in the original release)Phoenix:C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop them, right? (Changed from [C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop it, right?] in the original release)Maya:Was it that obvious?Phoenix:(Poppers... hmm.) (Changed from [A popper... hmm.] in the original release)Take them (Changed from [Take it] in the original release)Phoenix:I suppose it couldn't hurt. Huh? Where'd they go? (Changed from [Huh? Where'd it go?] in the original release)Maya:Into my pocket. (Changed from [I already put it in my pocket.] in the original release)Poppers put in pocket. (Changed from [Popper put in pocket.] in the original release)Leads back to examinationLeave them (Changed from [Leave it] in the original release)Phoenix:Nah, let's leave them.

Law OfficesPresentAnything elseMaya:Nick! If we don't hurry Mr. Edgeworth will get the death sentence!!!Phoenix:Whoa! O-okay! Let's go check things out.Detention CenterPresentAnything elseEdgeworth:What's that? I'm not in the mood for idle banter, Wright.December 25Boat Rental ShopMaya:Nick... what is this place?Phoenix:A boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either.Maya:Boats... I've never ridden on a boat.Phoenix:Really? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished?Maya:Hey, good idea! You bet!ExamineTreesPhoenix:There's more forest off that way. I doubt I'd find any helpful clues in there.ShopPhoenix:A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because it's Christmas.BoatsPhoenix:There are some boats floating at the dock. Was one of these boats used in the murder, I wonder?Maya:Nick?Phoenix:Huh?Maya:I changed my mind. I don't really want to go for a boat ride.December 25Gourd Lake WoodsMaya:I like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping!Phoenix:They've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder.Maya:Hey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder!Phoenix:(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them.ExamineCameraMaya:Hey, Nick. Check out this camera!Phoenix:Yeah... what's with the big mic and that box on top, I wonder? It looks like some sort of automatic system for taking a photo when a noise is heard.Maya:Wow! Hey, let's see if it works! *cough* \"Hi, I'm Nick!\" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. \"YO! I'M NICK!!!\" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!Phoenix:Will you stop that?Maya:I think it's broken, Nick.Phoenix:D-don't kick it! (It must not be set up to respond to voices.)Camera (after Popper is added to the Court Record)Leads to:\"This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment.\"TreesPhoenix:The trees grow quite thick here. Further back, the trees fade into the shadow where the sunlight can't reach them.SignPhoenix:The sign says \"No Camping.\" Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.Maya:Wait, what if the sign said \"No Setting Tents on Fire\"?Phoenix:... I don't think they have signs like that.Maya:Oh...SheetPhoenix:There's food and some magazines on the sheet. It takes a pretty tough skin to camp in this cold.CampfireMaya:Hey, Nick!Phoenix:What, don't tell me you're hungry again?Maya:No, no. I was just wondering, why are camping pots and pans made of aluminum?Phoenix:... They didn't talk about that in any of the law books.Maya:So, there's no law saying they have to be made out of aluminum, then!Phoenix:(I'm not having this conversation...)SUVPhoenix:This SUV has seen better days. It's dented all over. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.Phoenix:This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment. It must take pictures when triggered by a noise.Maya:Wow! Cool! Let's try it out! *cough* \"Hi, I'm Nick!\" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. \"HEY! I'M NICK!!!\" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!Phoenix:Will you stop that?Maya:Maybe it's broken?Phoenix:D-don't kick it! Maybe it isn't set up to respond to voices?Maya:Well what then? These things?

Someone--I'm not namin' any names--but someone used up a WHOLE ROLL.Maya:Sorry...Phoenix:(That didn't work...

Aren't badges supposed t' be all shiny and impressive? You a cop or something?Phoenix:Umm... I'm a lawyer.???:Wh-what!? Y'all ain't gonna try and pull one o' them lawsuits on me over that film now? Cause I'll have you know I'm a fighter and I wrassled meaner looking' things'n you!Phoenix:N-no, that's not it at all. We're here investigating a murder that took place here, on the lake.???:A murder...? ... Sounds cool! Why didn't y'all say that in the first place! Go ahead, ask me anything ya like!Phoenix:(Finally! Some cooperation!)???:You too. Y'all can come out of hiding now. I won't bite. Hard.Phoenix:(Come to think of it, where did Maya get to?)Maya:S-sorry... I-I was feeling a little overwhelmed.

Kinda hard to remember which I seen when.LottaMaya:So, what is it you do, Lotta?Lotta:Huh? Me? Hah hah. Y'all don't really want to know that, do ya? Actually, I'm a research student at Country U., right in the heart of the heartland.Maya:Wow! Neat! Nick! She's a research student at a university! Country U.!Phoenix:Uh... so I hear.Maya:So, when did you come up here?Lotta:Hmm, lemme see...

He's mumbling something to himself.Police:\"Never talk to people in the neighborhood... Turn all the lights in the room off, and close the curtains...\"Phoenix:... He must be doing image training for a stake-out.TalkLotta's testimonyPhoenix:So... what did Ms. Hart say?Gumshoe:She says she saw Mr. Edgeworth fire the pistol.Maya:What!?Gumshoe:She even had a photograph to prove it.Phoenix:Right. I saw it too... But you really can't tell from the photo who it is shooting.Gumshoe:That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said \"it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!\"Maya:She can do that!?Phoenix:(Okay, so there's going to be an enlarged photograph that shows Edgeworth in the act. Great. Just great.)Gumshoe:In any case, she's going to be the one testifying tomorrow.Maya:Huh? What happened to the other witness?Gumshoe:Well... Apparently, there was a cancellation.Phoenix:(A \"cancellation\"...!?)Tomorrow's trialGumshoe:I'm afraid tomorrow is going to be life or death for poor Mr. Edgeworth. We got a witness who says she saw the very moment of the murder. And we got a photo taken when the shot rang out.Phoenix:(I'd say that sounds like a pretty unwinnable case... But wait... What did Mia used to say? If he's innocent, there's got to be something I've overlooked...)EdgeworthGumshoe:It sound like Mr. Edgeworth is going to ask the state to assign a public defender. I was just asked to file the paperwork. But you still got time, pal! Go talk to him again, for me, please! You have to convince him! You have to make him let you defend him! Please! I know you're the only one who can do it, pal. You're the only one who can save Mr. Edgeworth!PresentEdgeworth's RequestLeads to:\"Look what I got.\"Anything elseGumshoe:Hey, pal, there's only one thing I want to see from you! And that's a letter of request from Mr. Edgeworth for you to be his defense attorney!Phoenix:Look what I got.Gumshoe:... Hey, you did it, pal! Glad I waited till the last minute to file those papers! I'll rip 'em up and start new ones for you!Phoenix:Thanks, Detective. Well, see you in court tomorrow, then.Gumshoe:Good luck, pal. Hey! You guys feel that earthquake a little while back? I was worried!Maya:Worried? We're fine! I've lived out here my whole life. I'm pretty used to them by now.Gumshoe:Oh, I wasn't worried about you two. I was worried about Mr. Edgeworth!Phoenix:(Oh, right...) He did seem to over-react a little, now that you mention it.Gumshoe:Yeah, well, I'm not surprised. It was a pretty big quake. I'm going to go check on him. You two go eat and get your rest for tomorrow's trial. Later!Maya:... I wonder what it is with Mr. Edgeworth and earthquakes?Phoenix:I wonder... He was never that scared of them when he was in school.Phoenix:(Then again, I only really got to know him in 4th grade. (Changed from [Then again, I was only in the same class as him for 4th grade.] in the original release) He transferred to another school after that.

He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!Maya:Not a single case?Edgeworth:He'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.Phoenix:Hmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:Hmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.Phoenix:(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)Edgeworth:He taught me what it really means to \"prosecute.\"Phoenix:Wh-what!?Edgeworth:Just picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.Maya:Ugh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:Something like that...Maya:And now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.Edgeworth:Not a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!Maya:That's pretty ruthless...Edgeworth:Like I said. He's a god among prosecutors.Phoenix:(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?Maya:Uh huh?Phoenix:We could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?Maya:Oh...Phoenix:?Maya:I can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.Phoenix:You couldn't \"reach\"?Maya:I think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...Phoenix:Oh man, what bad timing!Maya:I'm really sorry. I'll try my best!Phoenix:I hope so!Edgeworth:What are you whispering about?Phoenix:O-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:The defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:...Judge:Err, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?Karma:... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?Judge:R-right, my apologies!Phoenix:(He's even got the Judge scared!)Judge:Very well, your opening statement, please.Karma:... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?Judge:Ah... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.Maya:What's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?Phoenix:How am I supposed to fight against this!?Karma:I call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.Phoenix:(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)Karma:Describe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:Y-yessir!Phoenix:(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:Er, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:Hmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:Testify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:W-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...Karma:Yes?Judge:Actually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings...Karma:Wrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word \"guilty.\" That is your role!Judge:Y-yes, of course. You're quite right.Phoenix:(No, he's not!!!)Witness Testimony-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Judge:Hmm... I see. Very well...Karma:Begin your cross-examination, attorney. Now!Judge:...Cross Examination-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You received a call from a \"man\"?Gumshoe:Er... yup.Phoenix:But you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right?Karma:Karma:That woman and the \"man\" who called in the report are two different people, obviously!Phoenix:Different people?Karma:There were two witnesses!Phoenix:(Urk!)Karma:Their testimonies were quite similar however. Today I've summoned the woman who was camping.Phoenix:(The woman who was camping... Lotta Hart.)Karma:What happened next, Detective?Gumshoe:We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:How long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake?Gumshoe:Er, well... I'd say it was about three minutes.Phoenix:That's pretty fast!Gumshoe:Our motto for the month is \"get there quick.\"Karma:Karma:Detective! You will refrain from casually revealing department secrets!Gumshoe:Y-yessir! Sorry, sir!Karma:Do that, and you'll be able to look forward to your next salary review.Gumshoe:So much to look forward to, these days...Karma:This is no time for daydreaming! Continue!Gumshoe:Y-yessir!Gumshoe:That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What was Mr. Edgeworth like when you saw him then?Gumshoe:Well... From what I saw, he looked pretty relaxed. Not like a murderer at all, really.Karma:Karma:Detective! The court requires the facts, NOT your opinion! How many years have you been on the force!? Facts only, Detective! Hard, cold, objective facts!Gumshoe:Y-y-yessir!Phoenix:(Man, he's got his share of objections...)Gumshoe:Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Why didn't you think he was suspicious?Gumshoe:You should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors.Karma:Karma:Detective! The court isn't interested in your musings! \"Deep\"? \"Trusting\"? Poppycock! I've never heard so many flippant comments from an active detective on the force!Gumshoe:Mmph!Phoenix:(Detective Gumshoe doesn't look so good...)Karma:Continue! Now!Gumshoe:But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Did you find any clues on the body?Gumshoe:A single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.Karma:Judge! Here's the bullet... It didn't strike bone, so its shape is well preserved.Judge:Very well. The court accepts this bullet into evidence.Pistol Bullet added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)Phoenix:Phoenix:Did you find any clues on the body?Gumshoe:A single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.Gumshoe:So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:W-why is that?Gumshoe:Well, we found the murder weapon in the boat.Phoenix:The murder weapon...?Gumshoe:A pistol.Judge:Detective Gumshoe... That is a vital piece of information. Please revise your testimony.Gumshoe:Right! S-sorry, Your Honor.Changes statement from \"So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.\" to \"The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.\"Gumshoe:The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"?Karma:Tsk tsk tsk...Phoenix:(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)Gumshoe:There were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.Phoenix:Wh-what!?Judge:Order! Order! So Mr. Edgeworth's fingerprints were found on the murder weapon!?Gumshoe:Y-yes, Your Honor.Karma:Judge! This is the weapon in question.Judge:A-accepted into evidence.Pistol added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)Phoenix:Phoenix:What about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"?Karma:Tsk tsk tsk...Phoenix:(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)Gumshoe:There were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.Phoenix:Wh-what!?Maya:Nick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?Phoenix:I bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.Maya:What do we do?Phoenix:Grit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?Maya:Well said, Nick! You're the man!After pressing fifth statement and pressing modified sixth statement:Karma:Members of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!Gumshoe:Y-y-yessir!Karma:Was the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:Yes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:Hmm...Maya:Hey, Nick! What does he mean, \"ballistic markings\"?Karma:Shocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:N-Nick! He's glaring at me!Karma:Tsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:Eh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the \"fingerprints\" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these \"ballistic fingerprints\" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.Karma:Indeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!Judge:O-order! Order!Phoenix:(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)Karma:Well, Judge?Judge:I'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:You wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!Judge:Y-yes?Karma:What are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!Judge:B-but, wait, I...Karma:Just bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!Judge:Y-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess.Phoenix:(Who's running this court, anyway!?)December 26, 11:09 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:Edgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!Edgeworth:Uh... hmm...Phoenix:And that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!Edgeworth:True...Phoenix:Was that you in the boat?Edgeworth:... Yes. It was me.Phoenix:What!?Edgeworth:But... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.Phoenix:Th-then who did!?Edgeworth:I... don't know.Phoenix:You don't know!? Weren't you right there!?Edgeworth:... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!Phoenix:Y-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:... That's the only explanation I can come up with.Phoenix:Huh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?Maya:Huh? Wh-what?Phoenix:Any progress with Mia?Maya:Oh... Sorry. It's no good.Phoenix:Ugh...Maya:I know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?No, I need you herePhoenix:No, of course not, I need you here!

Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?Karma:Lotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?Lotta:That I am.Karma:Good. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?Lotta:... Y'all need to learn some manners.Karma:UNDERSTAND?Lotta:Y-yeah, I understand, I understand!Judge:Er... very well.

She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:W-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:As the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:Order! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:... Well, Judge?Judge:The evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:W-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:A cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:...!Karma:Very well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:Uh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:\"Contempt of court,\" you know?Maya:I... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do?

Was that really to take pictures of meteor showers?Karma:Karma:The camera is irrelevant to this case!Phoenix:You can't say that for certain!Judge:Hmm... Mr. Wright.

You will testify to the court about the camera!Lotta:Yeah, yeah, I hear ya.Changes statement from \"Still, I brought my binoculars with me.\" to \"The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.\"Hold backPhoenix:Okay, Your Honor... I withdraw my question. (I have to remember who I'm dealing with! I bet von Karma wants to trap me so he can put me in contempt! I think I'll hang back for now and see what happens.)Karma:Hah!Leads back to cross-examinationLotta:The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Ms. Hart. What made you choose that lake to photograph meteors? You know the fog gets thick on that lake. It's not very suited to stargazing.Lotta:Yeah, well... Y'see, I... I guess I wasn't thinking too straight! Har!Karma:Karma:Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness because of her challenged intellect!Lotta:Now wait a minute!Karma:Continue your testimony. You were saying how it was that you saw Edgeworth?Lotta:Grr...Karma:No unnecessary comments, please.Present Lotta's CameraPhoenix:Phoenix:You were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie!Lotta:S-says who!?Phoenix:I saw the camera you set up yesterday. It was pointed directly at the lake! You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart!Leads to:\"Ooof!\"Present Lake PhotoPhoenix:Phoenix:You were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie!Lotta:S-says who!?Phoenix:Take a look at this photograph. This was taken on an automatic setting, was it not?Lotta:Y-yeah, that's right.Phoenix:You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart! But, as this photograph clearly shows... The camera was pointed directly at the lake!Leads to:\"Ooof!\"Lotta:When I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:If there was a heavy fog, how would binoculars change that at all?Lotta:What do you mean?Phoenix:Even binoculars can't see through fog! But... you say you clearly saw him?Lotta:Er... I did... yeah.Karma:Enough! There is no room for doubt in her testimony!Phoenix:(Hmm. She sounded pretty doubtful to me! But... I have to find a clear contradiction first.)Phoenix:(I don't care how many von Karmic objections I get... I'm going to find a hole in this testimony if it's the last thing I do!)Lotta:Ooof!Judge:Mr. Wright! What are you driving at?Phoenix:The witness was not at the lake to photograph shooting stars, Your Honor!Lotta:...!Judge:W-well then, what exactly was she photographing?Show evidenceLeads to:\"Your Honor! Take a look at this...\"I don't knowPhoenix:Well... that I don't know.Karma:Karma:What the witness takes photos of is entirely her business! This has nothing to do with the case!

Here's the real evidence!Judge:\"Enough playing around\" is my line, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:Uh...Leads back to:\"What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?\"Phoenix:Ms. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph!Judge:What's this? A newspaper article? \"Gourdy\"...? Ah, the sighting at Gourd Lake...Phoenix:Well, Ms. Hart?Lotta:I... I never heard of no lake monster! You got proof or something? Let's see you prove that I was down at the lake trying to photograph this \"Gourdy.\"I don't have proofPhoenix:Well, I don't have proof...Karma:Karma:Bah! Your ineptitude is entertaining, Mr. Wright, but enough is enough! I've had enough of baseless claims made without a hair of evidence to support them!Phoenix:Phoenix:Well all right, if that's how you want to play... I'll show you evidence!Judge:Mr. Wright!

Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!Present Lotta's CameraPhoenix:Phoenix:The proof, Ms. Hart, is your own camera!Lotta:...!Phoenix:You camera was set to take photos in response to loud noises, correct? Thus this photograph here, taken when a gun fired on the lake.Lotta:...Phoenix:And here, this article about \"Gourdy.\" According to this article... Gourdy made a loud noise when it emerged! Well? You were trying to photograph Gourdy, weren't you! That's why you had set your camera to respond to loud noises!Leads to:\"Order! Order!\"Present Gourdy ArticlePhoenix:Phoenix:The proof is this article about Gourdy the lake monster!Lotta:...!Phoenix:According to this article... When Gourdy breaks through the water, it makes a loud noise! Which is why you set up your camera with that microphone! You had it set to respond to loud noises! And that's how you got this picture when the pistol fired!Leads to:\"Order! Order!\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Phoenix:Here's my proof! It's simple!Judge:... If it's simple... then why have you obviously made an error, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:Urk...?Lotta:What's that!?Karma:Go home. Consider a career change.Phoenix:(Gah! How can they so casually toss aside this eviden... Oh. Whoops. Wrong evidence.)Judge:Luckily for you, I'm in a patient mood, Mr. Wright. One more time please.Leads back to:\"Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!\"Judge:Order! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange.Phoenix:(Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren't you?Lotta:... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what?Phoenix:Huh...?Lotta:That don't change what I saw, does it?Karma:Exactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist!Lotta:H-hey!Karma:But, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing!Phoenix:(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!)Judge:Ms. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony.Lotta:... Right. Fine, I'll testify. It won't change nothing, though.Phoenix:(Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!)Karma:...Witness Testimony-- Lotta's New Testimony --Lotta:Actually, I'm not a research student at a university.I'm an investigative photographer.Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!That's why I was camping out by the lake.But, that's all I was hiding.When I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake.There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot.I was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry.Judge:Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Karma:Karma:The witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!Judge:Er... hmm.Phoenix:Phoenix:I claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)Judge:Very well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.Karma:Hah! That would be a first!Phoenix:(Hah hah, very funny.)Judge:You understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright.

You get your photo, and sell it to the press. It's that kind of business. Hey, I was taking pictures at my sister's graduation last year... N' guess what!Phoenix:Umm... what?Lotta:There was a yoofoh just a' hanging in the sky!Phoenix:A \"yoofoh\"...?Lotta:You know, an \"Unidentified Flying Object\"? A yoofoh! That's when I had sort of a revelation. I knew I should become an investigative photographer!Phoenix:I... I see. (Kind of a shaky basis for a career...)Lotta:Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Is \"Gourdy\" really all that newsworthy?Lotta:Heck yeah! They even had him up on the TV!Phoenix:(I'm not sure that appearing on the local news \"rumor of the month\" show qualifies. Last month's show was \"Bigfoot Sighted on Acorn Hill,\" I believe.)Lotta:Hey! They also had a picture of him in the newspaper! For real!Judge:Mr. Wright. This is one fight I do not believe you can win. Let's keep moving, shall we?Phoenix:Yes, Your Honor.Lotta:That's why I was camping out by the lake.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:That's why you put the automatic senior on your camera?Lotta:Yep. Borrowed it from a friend at a university. It analyzes every sound it picks up, and when it gets a \"bang!\"...Phoenix:It snaps a shot.Lotta:Yep.Phoenix:So, how many pictures has it taken so far?Lotta:The only time the camera triggered was that night.Phoenix:(Hmm...)Lotta:But, that's all I was hiding.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:I think it's time you told us why you felt you had to hide your true purpose at the lake.Lotta:Heck, if word got out what I was up to, the lake'd be swarmin' with competitors!Phoenix:Competitors...?Lotta:Yeah! Second-rate shutterbugs trying to steal my scoop!Phoenix:Ah... Is that the only reason you were hiding the truth?Lotta:W-well, actually...Karma:Karma:Mr. Wright! I'll not have you asking questions with no relevance to this case!!!Phoenix:(Whatever you say, von Karma. I know you told her to keep quiet.)Lotta:When I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Exactly what sort of sound was it?Lotta:Well, I never heard one before so I can't say for sure... but it sounded like a gunshot. It was a lot sharper a sound than I would have expected.Phoenix:(Hmmm...)Present Gourdy ArticlePhoenix:Leads to:\"Ms. Hart!\"Lotta:There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:There wasn't \"much else to look at\"?Lotta:Yep.Phoenix:(I dunno.

It was the only thing out there! Any normal person'd be looking at it!Phoenix:I agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal!Lotta:Wh-what!? Y'all wanna step over here and say that!?Phoenix:You were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought!Lotta:Aah!Judge:Order! Continue, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:You testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat!

She said \"it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!\"Phoenix:(She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch!

Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Yes, Your Honor.Judge:You have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However...

The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!Judge:Order! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide?Phoenix:Yes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.Judge:Hmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option.Karma:Karma:I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question.Phoenix:Wh-what!?Karma:An examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot.Phoenix:The... distance?Karma:The victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away!Phoenix:A meter!

I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Judge:Hmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter.

Don't you have anything to say!?Edgeworth:No. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright.Phoenix:Well, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!?

Jerk!] in the original release)Phoenix:I requisitioned a transcript of Lotta's entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow.

Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrancePhoenix:There are fewer than there were yesterday, but the cops are still around in the park. I wonder if Detective Gumshoe is here today?ExamineTreesPhoenix:I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... There's a lot of trees here. I guess that's why they call it a \"nature park.\" It's quite pretty when the cherry trees along the lakeside blossom in spring. Today... it's just cold.SignPhoenix:The sign says \"Gourd Lake Nature Park.\" This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. It's a little cold for picnicking these days, though.December 26Gourd LakePublic BeachPhoenix:Haven't seen Larry around at all. Probably off paying through the nose on a date with the lovely Kiyance...ExamineLakePhoenix:The famous Gourd Lake... Its green waters stretch out on both sides... It's a pretty big lake, really.December 26Boat Rental ShopPhoenix:(Looks like the boat rental shop is closed today, too.)ExamineShopPhoenix:A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because of the murder.BoatsPhoenix:There are some boats floating at the dock. The murder took place in a boat from this dock... Apparently, the police took away the actual boat that was used that night. Indeed, there's space for one more boat at the dock.December 26Gourd Lake WoodsPhoenix:Hey, Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:Hey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ...Phoenix:Yes? What about the trial?Gumshoe:Well, I was going to say \"good show,\" but it wasn't really all that... Though you did save Mr. Edgeworth, I guess... (Changed from [Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess...] in the original release) I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know?Phoenix:Er... thanks.ExamineCameraPhoenix:Lotta's camera is staring out at the lake, as usual. Even a novice like me can tell that camera must cost a pretty penny. I hope she doesn't leave it out here to get stolen.SignPhoenix:The sign says \"No Camping.\" Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.CampfirePhoenix:I wonder why she brought a camping cooker with her? There's a convenience store right up the street... I guess she wanted to get into the outdoor spirit.SUVPhoenix:I don't think Lotta takes very good care of her SUV. It's covered with dents. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.TalkTomorrow's trialPhoenix:Detective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow?Gumshoe:It sounds like he's bringing in another witness!Phoenix:Another witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today...Karma:There were two witnesses!Phoenix:I was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it?Gumshoe:S... sorry, pal. As much as I'd like to, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.Phoenix:(Right...)Prosecutor EdgeworthPhoenix:Oh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth.Gumshoe:What's up?Phoenix:Is he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before.Gumshoe:... Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk about himself too much, see. But there's one thing that's clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident.Phoenix:The DL-6 Incident?Gumshoe:Yep, that's the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes.Maya FeyPhoenix:I wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey...Gumshoe:Huh? She's not out on bail yet? That's strange. I told 'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don't know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren't for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I'll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Mr. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling. (Changed from [Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.] in the original release)Phoenix:Really!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?)Gumshoe:He was really grateful for what she did, you know.PresentAttorney's BadgeGumshoe:I think it's a little early for you to be proudly waving that thing around. You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal!Lotta's CameraGumshoe:That woman really took us for a ride, didn't she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all...Phoenix:Still, if it weren't for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't have made it today.Gumshoe:Oh, huh, really?Phoenix:(Umm... you were at the trial, weren't you, Detective?)Robert's Autopsy ReportGumshoe:Robert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He's the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I'd wager.Lake PhotoGumshoe:I don't care who you are, no one can tell me that that's Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn't look like him at all!Phoenix:But Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat.Gumshoe:Then he's the one being shot, then!Phoenix:He seemed fine in court today...Gumshoe:... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway?Phoenix:(All I'm saying is we have to respect the evidence...)Pistol BulletGumshoe:Yep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt.Phoenix:From a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat.Gumshoe:Hmm...Phoenix:What do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe?Gumshoe:Hey, making something of things is your job!Phoenix:Er... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives' work for them!?)PistolGumshoe:Maybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth's prints were on the weapon, pal.Phoenix:Huh? How should I know!?Lotta's DepositionGumshoe:Now, she heard two gunshots, right?Phoenix:But wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times!Gumshoe:What!? How's that possible!?Phoenix:Where was the third shot fired?Gumshoe:I wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something?Anything elseGumshoe:Sorry to disappoint you, pal. I'm drawing a blank.After clearing all Talk options:Gumshoe:I'm going to head back to the station. I'll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can.Phoenix:Thank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?Gumshoe:Don't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.Phoenix:What? Edgeworth...?Gumshoe:Didn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay?Phoenix:(Hmm... Maybe I can get Edgeworth to pay this month's rent, too...)After clearing all Talk options in Gourd Lake Woods:December 26Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:Hey, Nick! You finally came! They just finished the paperwork, I'm free to go.Phoenix:Free at last, eh?Maya:Those interrogators were really mean! They were like \"okay, what did you do THIS time?\" Like I was some kind of criminal! Can you believe it?Phoenix:Well, they let you out in the end, didn't they?Maya:Mmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail.Phoenix:Thank Edgeworth.Maya:Huh?Phoenix:He posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did.Maya:Mr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We've got to win this case, Nick!TalkWhat to doPhoenix:What do you think we should do next?Maya:We're kind of lacking in the clues department. We could go to the park and look for Gourdy.Phoenix:...Maya:I-I was kidding!Phoenix:Still, if there are any clues out there, the park's as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there?Maya:Sure!Any ideasPhoenix:Have you noticed anything lately?Maya:Hmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It's really pretty comfortable here. It's warm, and they keep it very clean.Phoenix:I meant have you noticed anything about the case...?Maya:Well... Not much more than that, no.Phoenix:(She's probably still upset about Mia. I should leave her alone.)Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:Ahh! Fresh air! I gotta say, freedom feels great.Phoenix:Behave yourself in the courtroom tomorrow, okay?Maya:Heh heh heh. Misbehaving's much more fun.Phoenix:It's not going to be so much fun when Edgeworth refuses to pay your bail again.Maya:... Right. I'll behave.Phoenix:(Oh dear...)TalkWhat to doPhoenix:Well, what should we do?Maya:I don't know! I've been in detention this whole time. I think I'll let you decide what we should do. Deal?Any ideasPhoenix:Well? Any thoughts you want to share?Maya:Well, I was detention all day. I think I'd like more time to think.Phoenix:(Poor Maya, she probably thought about Mia the whole time she was in there...)PresentAnythingMaya:Don't waste time showing me things! We have to get cracking on this case! You know the enemy has more tricks up his sleeve! He's bringing in another witness!December 26Detention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:Looks like Edgeworth is in questioning.Maya:Let's come back later.Phoenix:Guess so...December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntranceMaya:There aren't many cops around today, are there?Phoenix:They're probably back at the precinct, working up the case against Edgeworth.Maya:Mmm...Lotta:Hey y'all!Maya:Hey, it's Lotta!Lotta:Y'all really did it today...Phoenix:Wh-what did we do now?Lotta:Naw, I'm not complaining! See, I did a little thinking. A little... self-reflection, you might say. I realized that bein' a witness is a mighty big responsibility. But I just went up there and started blabbing any old thing that came to mind.Phoenix:Lotta...Lotta:So, you see, I want to make it up to y'all.Phoenix:\"Make it up\"...?TalkToday's trialPhoenix:What did you think of the trial?Lotta:To be honest, I was doin' it half just to say I'd been a witness... Even though I didn't really see anything. I kinda convinced myself I had though... I'm sorry, I know I caused y'all a lot of trouble.Maya:Well, memory is a tricky, vague little thing.Lotta:Yeah, I sure know that now. I'll be fine the next time I witness a murder!Maya:Right!Phoenix:(You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...)GourdyPhoenix:What about Gourdy?Lotta:Right! Well, the way I figure, the trial's only stoking the flames of Gourdy fever! I'll get my exclusive photos and rocket to stardom!Maya:All right, Lotta! You go, girl! I wish I could be an investigative photographer too!Phoenix:(Finish your spirit medium training first!)Making it upPhoenix:Lotta, what do you mean by \"making it up to us\"?Lotta:Well, ya see... Actually, I got a bit of information for you.Maya:What!?Lotta:That von Karma didn't want me to say nothin' about it.Maya:Wh-what information!?Lotta:Now we're getting to the heart of it! See, I reckoned we might be able to do ourselves a little \"exchange.\"Phoenix:E-\"exchange\"? Umm... I thought this was to \"make it up to us\"...?Lotta:Right! I propose a little exchange, to make it up to you!Phoenix:...Lotta:What!? Information don't come cheap, my friend!Maya:Uh...Lotta:Hey! I see you thinking \"my, how unsophisticated these southern folks are\"!!! It's written all over yer face! Let me tell you, most southerners are WAY more sophisticated than you... I'm just the exception, okay? Well, what'll it be? We gonna deal, or not!?Maya:Wh-what should we do, Nick?DealPhoenix:(We don't have any other leads so I don't think we have a choice here...) Okay.

You know, I was wondering...Lotta:Yeah?Maya:What if you get a picture of Gourdy... and it turns out like this enlargement did?Lotta:Y'all crazy!? A blurry picture like this doesn't make a hit story! I need a picture that screams \"I am Gourdy! Hear me roar!\" I can't turn something like this into the paper! What kind of fool do y'all think I am?Phoenix:(The kind of fool that would turn a blurry picture in as evidence in a murder trial? Not to mention claiming she saw something she didn't see!)Anything elseLotta:Yep, I'd have to say I know exactly squat about that.Phoenix:(It's painfully easy to know when something doesn't catch Lotta's interest...)Phoenix:Huh?Lotta:The only fair exchange for information is... information!

So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.)Victim dataPhoenix:Do you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father?Maya:Yeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it!Phoenix:Gregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles.Maya:\"Miles\"...!Phoenix:Miles Edgeworth, of course.Maya:So he was on the elevator with his father!Phoenix:From the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?)Suspect dataPhoenix:Got any data on the suspect in there?Maya:Hmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it.Phoenix:The man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently.Maya:So he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it!Phoenix:But... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond.Maya:Hammond... the victim in our case!Phoenix:Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared.Maya:Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?Phoenix:(He may be closer than we think...)PresentAnythingMaya:Let's just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here...After clearing all Talk options:Phoenix:I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...Maya:Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.Phoenix:Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record.Phoenix:Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how \"Dad\" will do testifying in court...To be continued.Nothing to examine during investigationPhoenix:No clues here.Turnabout GoodbyesTranscriptPart 1Part 2Part 3Part 4Part 5Part 6December 27, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:The defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:... ...Judge:Very well, apparently the prosecution is also ready.Phoenix:(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)Judge:Mr. von Karma, your opening statement.Karma:... ...Judge:Er... very well, no opening statement so...Karma:Karma:Not so fast, Judge! I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking!Judge:R-right, of course.Karma:A prediction! Today's trial will end three minutes from now!Judge:Order... order! Mr. von Karma! What is the meaning of your statement just now!?Karma:Karma:Bah! Must you question everything! It will be over in three minutes! We have no time to waste! I'll call my witness now!Judge:R-right...Karma:I call my witness... my decisive witness to the stand!Phoenix:(It's that mysterious boat shop owner.)Karma:Witness... state your profession.Uncle:Mmph... zzzz... ... I, er, am the proprietor of the restaurant the \"Wet Noodle\" at Gourd Lake.Karma:...Uncle:And I, er, also rent boats.Karma:The night of the incident, you were in the boat rental shop, correct?Uncle:Er... ayup, yup I was.Karma:Please testify.Phoenix:(Wait a second... We still haven't heard who this old guy is!)Raise an objectionPhoenix:Leads to:\"Wait a minute!\"Let it slidePhoenix:(On second thought, I guess it doesn't really matter.)Maya:Doesn't matter!? What are you thinking, Nick!? What if that old man had something to do with the DL-6 Incident? If we don't find out who he is, we won't be able to build a case here!Phoenix:(Hmm, she has a point.)Phoenix:Leads to:\"Wait a minute!\"Phoenix:Wait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!Karma:Karma:Because I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate!Phoenix:(Yeah, right!)Judge:The witness will state his name.Uncle:Zzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I'm not really sure, ayup.Judge:What do you mean?Uncle:My, er, memory...Karma:Your Honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name.Judge:Hmm... he can't recall, you say?Karma:Yes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify.Judge:Very well. Let's hear his testimony then, shall we. Witness?Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.Then I heard a \"bang!\" Ayup.When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.Then I heard another \"bang.\"Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Judge:Hmm...Very well. I'd like to begin the cross-examination...Karma:Karma:There is nothing to question in my witness's testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now!Judge:Er... yes... M-Mr. Wright...?Cross-examinePhoenix:What are you saying!? Of course I'll cross-examine the witness!Judge:Hmm... Very well, you may begin.Leads to:\"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\"Don't cross-examinePhoenix:(He's right. That testimony sounded pretty solid. Maybe I should hold back.)Maya:B-but, Nick! You have to cross-examine him! This is your only chance to turn this trial around! Your last chance!Phoenix:(O-oh... right.)Leads to:\"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\"Karma:Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:E-excuse me? Mr. von Karma?Karma:Three minutes just passed.Judge:I see. Well then, let's just take our time. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:\"Just after midnight,\" you say?Uncle:Ayup, just around then.Phoenix:Are you sure?Uncle:Pretty sure, ayup.Phoenix:When I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I'm surprised you seem so sure about it today.Uncle:...Karma:Karma:I asked him, and he remembered. Isn't that right!?Uncle:Zzzz... D-don't glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup.Karma:You see? Continue!Uncle:I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Is there anyone who can verify that?Uncle:... Well, I guess Polly could.Phoenix:Th-that's not good enough for a court of law!Judge:Mr. Wright... exactly what's not good enough?Phoenix:Ah, uh, Your Honor, this \"Polly\" is a parrot.Judge:A... parrot?Uncle:Don't be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy!Judge:Keith...?Karma:Karma:The prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop. Witness... please continue.Uncle:Then I heard a \"bang!\" Ayup.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:And where did the \"bang\" seem to come from?Uncle:From the lake, I figure.Karma:Are you certain?Uncle:A-ayup.Karma:Good. Continue!Uncle:When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Was there someone in the boat?Uncle:It was pretty far out there... I couldn't see clearly... But I figure there was two men out there, ayup.Phoenix:But you couldn't see them clearly!Uncle:Ayup... at the time, that is.Phoenix:(At the time...?)Uncle:Then I heard another \"bang.\"PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So you heard two gunshots total?Uncle:Ayup.Phoenix:(That's what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)Uncle:Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:\"By your window\"?Uncle:Ayup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack.Phoenix:And, could you see the man's face?Uncle:Well, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me. I saw him.Judge:This is rather important detail! Please add it to your testimony.Uncle:...Karma:Tsk, tsk, tsk...Phoenix:(I have a bad feeling about this...)Adds statement \"That man was the defendant... he was saying \"I can't believe he's dead.\"Uncle:That man was the defendant... he was saying \"I can't believe he's dead.\"PressPhoenix:Leads to:\"A-are you sure!?\"Phoenix:(If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I'm not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it's tough being a lawyer.)Phoenix:A-are you sure!?Uncle:...Phoenix:(Uh oh!) D-Dad!Uncle:Dead certain, Keith! He said \"I can't believe he's dead\" as he was walking by, too.Karma:Witness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?Uncle:It was him! That Edgeworth boy!Judge:... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.Phoenix:(von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)Karma:Tsk, tsk, tsk...Maya:N-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!Phoenix:(I'd better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)Raise an objectionPhoenix:Phoenix:Your Honor! We proved in yesterday's court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun!Karma:Karma:Mr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth's right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...?Phoenix:Exactly!Karma:That is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness's testimony is true!Leads to:\"Hmm...\"Wait and see what happensPhoenix:(But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?)Karma:Judge! There is no room for doubt in the witness's testimony!

This witness claims that Edgeworth said \"I can' t believe he's dead\"... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie...Karma:Karma:Mr. Wright. In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof!Phoenix:Urk...Maya:Nick! Do we have evidence...?Leads to:\"It's no good! There's nothing I can do.\"Wait and see what happensPhoenix:(I can't see any room to raise an objection... I'd better hold back and see how things develop.)Maya:Nick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth'll be found guilty for sure!Leads to:\"It's no good! There's nothing I can do.\"Phoenix:It's no good! There's nothing I can do.Maya:A... are you sure?Phoenix:To be honest... I don't know what to do anymore.Maya:Please... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...Karma:Tsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record.Judge:Enough! The witness may leave the stand.Uncle:Zzzz...Judge:This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.Phoenix:(W-what!? No!)Karma:Hmph.Judge:This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...GuiltyJudge:The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date.

I was...  I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn't sure about it until just yesterday. B-but today I remembered it!Judge:Remembered what?Butz:The gunshot! I heard it too!Judge:O-order!Karma:Karma:What is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!Judge:One moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?Butz:Yeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can't just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It's... It's just not right! I'll testify! Lemme testify!Judge:Order! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I'm not quite sure how to proceed...Karma:Judge! You've already given your decision! The trial is over!Maya:Nick! This is it! Larry's given us one final chance at this!Phoenix:(She's right! If only it wasn't Larry... He could make things even worse...)Maya:Mr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn't get any worse!Phoenix:You're right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!Karma:A waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned!Judge:Hmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard!Karma:Wh-what is this!?Judge:I withdraw my previous verdict of \"guilty\"! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now!Karma:Whaaaat!Judge:The court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned!December 27, 10:28 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:Whew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:Hmph. I've seen worse.Phoenix:(Yeah right, Edgeworth. You're sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there.Maya:Larry was at the lake that night?Phoenix:Yes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.Maya:Oh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?Phoenix:Yeah.Edgeworth:...Phoenix:Hey, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:... Huh? You say something, Wright?Phoenix:Yeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What's wrong?Edgeworth:It... it's nothing.Phoenix:Hmm?Maya:Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? There's something I've been meaning to ask you.Edgeworth:What's that?Maya:Why are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?Edgeworth:Oh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn't have a reason, really.Maya:I see...Edgeworth:Wright...Phoenix:Yeah?Edgeworth:This might be our chance.Phoenix:Our chance?Edgeworth:von Karma has only ever run perfect trials.Phoenix:Perfect trials...?Edgeworth:Perfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That's the secret to his success. This is the first time he's ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has to let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court! (Changed from [He has let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court!] in the original release) And that someone... is Larry!Phoenix:What are you getting at?Edgeworth:It's likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright.Maya:That's right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We'll milk this one for all it's worth!Phoenix:Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything's on Larry now...) (Changed from [Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)] in the original release)December 27, 10:35 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:Court is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th.Butz:Right... leave it to me!Phoenix:(Please, Larry, don't mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you're our last chance!)Karma:...Phoenix:(von Karma didn't even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...)Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:That night, I was out in a boat on the lake.I was looking for something and I, er, found it.So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this \"bang\"!I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Judge:Hmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:Yes, Your Honor...Maya:What's wrong, Nick?Phoenix:It's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him. I'm a little scared.Maya:Hmm... Well, we've come this far. There's no way to go but forward, Nick!Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:That night, I was out in a boat on the lake.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:...Judge:Something wrong, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:There were so many things wrong I don't know where to begin...Judge:Ah...Phoenix:Um, well, okay. First of all, what time was it?Butz:Oh, it was after 11:00 when I went out in the boat. By that time everyone had gone home for the night. So I waited until the coast was clear, so to speak.Phoenix:And why were you out on a boat at such a late hour...?Butz:I was looking for something and I, er, found it.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:\"Looking for something\"...?Butz:Er, yeah.Judge:Mr. Butz, what was it you were looking for?Karma:Karma:What the witness was searching for is irrelevant! Most likely he was hunting for this \"Gourdy\"!Phoenix:(You know, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was the truth.)Karma:This is all irrelevant! Let's get it over with.Butz:So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Around what time was that?Butz:Uh... Well, let's see... I figured I was out searching for about an hour... I guess it was around 12:00. Yeah.Judge:You're not sure?Butz:Hey! Don't give me that face! I'm not some sort of human sundial, okay!?Phoenix:(People use watches these days, Larry...)Butz:Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this \"bang\"!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Where did the sound come from?Butz:Yeah, well, I wasn't too sure about that. I looked around, y'know.Judge:Did you look at the lake?Butz:Yeah, I looked.Butz:I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Wasn't there a boat on the lake!?Judge:Order! Order! Well? Mr. Butz!Butz:Whoa, whoa. Everybody just calm down, okay? I mean, it was real foggy that night. I'm not sure whether there was a boat out there or not.Phoenix:(Oh, okay, no problem. That's just the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the case!!!)Karma:Hmph!Butz:So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So, you only heard one \"bang\" correct?Butz:Yeah.Phoenix:(Huh.)Present Lotta's DepositionPhoenix:Leads to:\"W-wait a sec, Larry!\"Maya:Well, Nick?Phoenix:Hmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn't it? I guess I should just start working on the contradictions.Maya:Sorry...I wish I could be more helpful. I wish I could call my sister...Phoenix:W-wait a sec, Larry!Butz:Wh-what!?Phoenix:You only heard one \"bang\"!? You're sure!?Butz:That's what I said!Phoenix:But Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two \"bang\"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!Butz:Huh?Phoenix:Were you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said?Butz:Yo, Nick, please!Phoenix:Huh?Butz:You know, something's been bothering me. I'm a witness, see? I'm like a customer here! So you got to treat me nice and stuff, okay!?Phoenix:...Judge:Mr. Butz.Butz:What!?Judge:You only heard one gunshot? Are you sure?Butz:... Umm... Well, to tell ya the truth... I'm not sure.Judge:Eh...?Phoenix:Not sure!? H-how could you not be sure?Butz:Yeah, well... I, uh, I might have missed the other gunshot. I was, uh, listening to something else...Phoenix:Something... else?Butz:My radio, dude! With my headphones. (Changed from [My radio, dude! On my headphones.] in the original release)Phoenix:Whaaaaaaat!?Judge:Order! Order! And stop that booing! M-Mr. Butz! You were listening to the radio with your headphones? (Changed from [You were listening to a radio on earphones?] in the original release)Butz:Y-yeah! So what! That a crime!? I listen to my radio! Everybody listens to the radio! What's the big deal!?Judge:Hmm... Mr. von Karma... your opinion?Karma:Waste of time. I do not accept this witness, nor his shoddy testimony.Judge:Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Should he continue the testimony?That's enoughPhoenix:(No, I think I've heard enough. This is all too embarrassing... In fact, I think we've all heard enough.)Maya:What are you saying, Nick!? If you stop now, Mr. Edgeworth will be found guilty! We have to turn this trial around now!Phoenix:Uh...Leads to:\"Your Honor.\"ContinueLeads to:\"Your Honor.\"Phoenix:Your Honor. Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony.Karma:Bah! Nothing is more pitiful than a lawyer who doesn't know when he's lost!Judge:Very well, Mr. Butz. Please give your testimony, and be sure to include details like your RADIO.Butz:Right! Leave it to me!Phoenix:(I wouldn't if there were any other way out of this, believe me.)Witness Testimony-- What Larry Heard --Butz:It's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!That's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?I was listening to it real booming loud, like.But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.Judge:You were listening to your radio... at a high volume!?Butz:Yeah, what's the big problem? Can't a man listen to his radio in peace? Isn't this a free country!?Phoenix:(I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem here is.)Karma:Judge. Can you believe a word this witness says? What he heard was probably nothing more than a drum beat from the radio!Judge:True enough, it is difficult to believe this testimony.Phoenix:Phoenix:Wait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot!Judge:Excuse me? \"Dee-jay\"...?Phoenix:An announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake! I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor!Judge:V-very well, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:(I can't believe I'm continuing this charade...)Cross Examination-- What Larry Heard --Butz:It's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So, you turned on the radio?Butz:Right! I just wanted to hear someone's voice, y'know? You don't know what it's like out there, alone, on Christmas Eve! Alone!Phoenix:(I shouldn't have said anything...)Butz:That's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Do you by any chance remember the name of the program you were listening to?Karma:Karma:This has nothing to do with the case, Your Honor!Judge:Objection sustained. The witness was listening to the radio. That is all we need to know. Tell us, Mr. Butz, how loud was your radio set to that night?Butz:I was listening to it real booming loud, like.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Real \"booming\" loud?Butz:Yeah, y'know.Judge:And you had headphones on?Butz:Yup.Judge:I wouldn't think you could hear anything going on outside at all...Butz:But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Can you prove that...? No... no, of course you can't.Butz:Nah, I can't prove it. But I remember that moment real clear. I mean, while I was talking about it, it came back real clear to me, y'know?Butz:I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What did she say? (Changed from [What did he say?] in the original release)Karma:Karma:Mr. Wright! Please cease these pointless questions! What possible good could knowing what a radio DJ said do us!?Judge:Indeed, Mr. von Karma has a point. I'll allow the question only if you see some reason why we should care...?We don't carePhoenix:(Hmm... right. I didn't really have a deep reason for asking that question, now that I think about it.) Understood, Your Honor. I withdraw my question.Judge:Continue your examination of the witness, then.Phoenix:(This is getting nowhere...)Leads back to cross-examinationWe should carePhoenix:We should care, Your Honor! Of course we should!Karma:Why?Phoenix:Uh. W-well, how do you know if we don't ask, hmm?Judge:Fine, very well. Mr. Butz, please testify to the court. What was the radio announcer saying when you heard the gunshot?Adds statement \"Just when she said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" I heard the gunshot!\"Butz:Just when she said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" I heard the gunshot!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you sure?Butz:Course I am! She had this real sexy voice...Phoenix:(Hmm... maybe von Karma was right. I'm not sure how that helped us at all.)Present Lake PhotoPhoenix:Phoenix:Larry! Are you absolutely sure what you're saying is correct!?Butz:Huh? What's with the face? You look scary, dude. Hey, if you're trying to scare me, you better know I don't scare that easy!Judge:Is something the matter, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:Your Honor! Did you hear what the witness just said? The DJ said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" when he heard the gunshot!Judge:Indeed... And...?Phoenix:\"Almost Christmas\" means it wasn't Christmas! Do you realize what this means? When he heard the gunshot, it was still Christmas Eve!!!Judge:That would seem to be the case, yes...Phoenix:But he should have heard that gunshot after midnight! This photograph is irrefutable proof of this fact!Judge:Let's see what the time was on the photo taken when the gun triggered Ms. Hart's camera. < 12/25 00:15 >...! Fifteen minutes after midnight, on Christmas Day!Leads to:\"This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!\"Present Lotta's DepositionPhoenix:Phoenix:Larry! Are you absolutely sure what you're saying is correct!?Butz:Huh? What's with the face? You look scary, dude. Hey, if you're trying to scare me, you better know I don't scare that easy!Judge:Is something the matter, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:Your Honor! Did you hear what the witness just said? The DJ said \"Hey! It's almost Christmas!\" when he heard the gunshot!Judge:Indeed... And...?Phoenix:\"Almost Christmas\" means it wasn't Christmas! Do you realize what this means? When he heard the gunshot, it was still Christmas Eve!!!Judge:That would seem to be the case, yes...Phoenix:But that contradicts the two testimonies we have heard, Your Honor! Both Ms. Hart and the old man said it was after midnight when they heard the shots! In other words... When they heard the gunshots, it was already Christmas!!!Leads to:\"This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!\"Phoenix:(This is the most ludicrous testimony I've ever heard. But there is one gleaming ray of hope in there! I've got to press it until we get to the bottom of what happened!)Phoenix:This is a clear contradiction, Your Honor!Judge:Order! Order! What does this mean? The two prior witnesses heard gunshots after midnight. However, this witness says he heard a gunshot before midnight...Karma:Judge. The answer is simple. The current witness is plainly mistaken. Just look at him! Suspicious!Butz:Wh-whaaat!?Judge:Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think about Mr. Butz's claim that he heard the gunshot before midnight?Larry's wrongPhoenix:Well... I guess, it had to have been Larry's mistake.Karma:Hah!Judge:Very well.Butz:W-w-waaaaait! I come up here, I give you a riveting testimony... And you laugh it off as some kinda mistake!? What about me!? How can you call yourself a friend, Nick? How!? Get used to disappointment!!!Phoenix:...Leads back to:\"Well, Mr. Wright?\"Larry's rightLeads to:\"Larry's not mistaken, Your Honor!\"Phoenix:Larry's not mistaken, Your Honor! He heard that gunshot before midnight!Karma:... Intriguing. I'm assuming you have evidence for this wild claim? Show me evidence there was a gunshot before midnight!Present Second Lake PhotoPhoenix:Phoenix:Look at this photograph! This was taken by our witness yesterday, Ms. Lotta Hart, with her automatic camera. The timestamp on the photo reads \"December 24, 11:50 PM.\"Judge:Oh yeah? Hmm? But, there's nothing on the lake in this picture.Phoenix:Your Honor. The real issue here is not why nothing is shown in the photograph. It is why this photograph exists at all!Judge:What do you mean?Phoenix:Your Honor... This photograph was taken by an automatic camera. That camera was set to go off in response to loud noises!Judge:Ahah!Phoenix:Correct! There was a loud noise on the lake at 11:50 PM. That is why this photograph was taken! In other words... When Larry heard that gunshot, it was most definitely Christmas Eve!Judge:Indeed, it would seem that is the case! Then... where does that leave us? Ms. Hart testified that she heard the gunshots after midnight. Are you claiming she was mistaken?Phoenix:Not at all, Your Honor. It is a fact that the camera also triggered at 15 minutes after midnight! Your Honor! That night, there were two sets of gunshots, with a 25 minute pause between them!Judge:Why would this be...?Karma:Karma:Don't be fooled, Judge!

That camera was set to go off in response to loud noises!Judge:Ahah!Phoenix:Correct! There was a loud noise on the lake at 11:50 PM. That is why this photograph was taken! In other words...

So, you've finally realized the truth? There can be no other murderer here than Miles Edgeworth himself.Phoenix:Wrong, von Karma! A man was shot that night, but it wasn't Edgeworth who did the shooting!Karma:Listen, rookie. Take a deep breath, and consider the facts. At the time of the murder, one boat was on the lake. This was shown by the witness's photograph. The defendant, Edgeworth, and victim, Robert Hammond, were on that boat. There was a gunshot fired on that boat, and Robert Hammond fell into the lake. The distance of the shooting was one meter. It couldn't have been suicide! Well? The guilty party has to be the other man on that boat!Judge:I admit, it is hard to imagine any other possibility.Phoenix:Yes... But this assumes that the victim was shot at 15 minutes after midnight.Judge:... What do you mean by that, Mr. Wright? We have photographic evidence of the time of the shooting. The timestamp on the photo says 00:15.Phoenix:But Larry heard a gunshot 25 minutes before that! Robert Hammond was killed then! 25 minutes before the shot on the lake!

That contradicts what you just told the court. You said that Robert Hammond had been killed 25 minutes before this gunshot!Phoenix:Y-yes, that's right.Judge:Also, might I mention... The defendant, Mr. Edgeworth, has admitted to being on that boat.Phoenix:Er, right, Your Honor. (Crash and burn...)Judge:Mr. Wright! Your client has already been declared guilty once!

He assumed the guise of Mr. Hammond and met Edgeworth!Judge:Wh... What!? Are you serious?Phoenix:Yes. Edgeworth won't tell us why he went to the lake that night. However, I have a hunch. That night, Robert Hammond called Edgeworth to the lake. Now, Edgeworth didn't know Robert Hammond's face that well. That's why he didn't suspect anything when the murderer took Robert Hammond's place!Judge:... I'm not sure what to make of all this.Karma:L-Ludicrous!Judge:Mr. Wright.

That night he was out on the lake in a boat, searching for something. He finds it, and returns the boat. Then, just as he's starting to head for home, he hears a gunshot! He heard a gunshot, Your Honor! Even though he was wearing headphones at the time! In other words, the gunshot was very, very close by! And where would that be if he had just returned a boat?Judge:The boat shop...! Mr. Wright! What happened that night on Gourd Lake!? Please tell the court, from the beginning!Phoenix:Y-yes, Your Honor.Maya:Nick, are you sure about this...?Phoenix:Um, not really. But, I think if I start at the very beginning... And I take it slow, I must just be able to figure this out...Phoenix:That night... The caretaker of the boat shop called Robert Hammond to his shop. This was around 11:50. That was when the gunshot that Larry heard was fired. After that, the caretaker put on Robert Hammond's coat... He became Robert Hammond! Then he got in the boat with Edgeworth, and went out into the middle of the lake.Judge:Then... who fired the pistol on the boat, Mr. Wright?Miles EdgeworthPhoenix:It was Miles Edgeworth...Maya:N-Nick! How could that be!? Wasn't the old man holding the pistol!?Phoenix:Uh, yeah. Good thinking!Maya:That was easy, Nick!

Details!)Karma:Know this, Mr. Wright. The moment you run out of explanations is the moment you lose.

That ensures that anyone who heard the shot would look at the lake. Indeed, Ms. Hart did exactly that after hearing the first gunshot. Next! The murderer waits a bit and he fires again. Then... The murderer jumps from the boat himself! Leaving the pistol in the boat behind him.Judge:... I see! To someone looking from the edge of the lake... It would appear that one of the men on the boat had shot the other!Phoenix:The murderer didn't know about the automatic camera, of course. That's why he shot twice to draw attention to the boat!Judge:Hmm...Phoenix:Once you realize that, everything else falls into place! The boat shop caretaker swam back to his shop. Then he put Mr. Hammond's coat back on the body. And threw the body into the lake! This is what happened, Your Honor. These are the events that transpired that night on Gourd Lake.Judge:...Karma:......Judge:... Bailiff! Bring out the witness from before! The boat shop caretaker! Quickly!Judge:Very well. While we are waiting for the caretaker... I would like to ask the defendant, Miles Edgeworth, a few questions. Mr. Edgeworth. Please take the stand.Judge:Mr. Edgeworth... You heard what the defense has said?Edgeworth:Yes.Judge:Well? Why did you go to the lake that night?Edgeworth:... What Wright has said was mostly correct. Astonishingly so, actually. Yes... Several days ago, I received a letter. The letter was signed, \"Robert Hammond.\" He asked me to come to the boat shop by the lake at midnight on Christmas Eve. He said he had something very important to discuss with me.Judge:Something important?Edgeworth:... I'm sorry. I can't say what it was.Judge:Hmm...Guard:Your Honor, sir!Judge:Bailiff! We are conducting a trial here, I ask that you remain quiet...Guard:The witness has disappeared! He isn't at the boat shop, either!Judge:What!?Guard:What should I do?Judge:F-find him, quickly! We cannot allow him to get away!Judge:Mr. von Karma! Your witness has disappeared!Karma:... A search warrant has already been issued.Judge:Hmm... It goes without saying that I cannot declare a verdict under these circumstances. I will extend the trial until tomorrow, the final day allowed. I request that the police department utilize all its forces to find that witness! Am I understood?Karma:...Judge:One more thing. Just who is that boat shop caretaker?

I heard the story about the class trial...Edgeworth:Class trial? What do you mean?Maya:You... don't remember?Edgeworth:No, I don't.Maya:Your lunch money was stolen, wasn't it? In 3rd grade...? (Changed from [Your lunch money was stolen, wasn't it? In 4th grade...?] in the original release)Edgeworth:Lunch money...? ... Oh... Oh, right. Yes, I seem to remember something like that.Maya:Nick. I think you're the only one who really remembers.Phoenix:Well, it probably only really mattered to me anyway.Maya:Mr. Edgeworth, didn't you know? That trial was the reason Nick became a defense attorney!Edgeworth:... Ridiculous!Phoenix:(Gee... thanks.)Edgeworth:That said... It does sound like that kind of thing you'd do. You haven't changed a bit, have you, Wright? So...simple. To a fault, even.Phoenix:Well, maybe yeah, but... I think you changed too much, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:... Perhaps.TalkWhy prosecute?Phoenix:Hey, Edgeworth. Why did you become a prosecutor, anyway? You used to look up to your dad... You said you wanted to be a defense attorney, right?Edgeworth:... I couldn't let myself deny reality like you.Phoenix:What do you mean?Edgeworth:My father was taken from me, and you want me to defend criminals? I'm sorry, Wright, but I'm not that good of a person!Maya:One suspect was apprehended in your father's murder, right?Edgeworth:Yes. The man trapped in the elevator with my father. His name... was Yanni Yogi. He had to be the shooter, any way you look at it! Yet... he was found innocent. That defense attorney got him off the hook!Phoenix:(That would be Robert Hammond...)Edgeworth:On that day, 15 years ago... The three of us were trapped in that elevator for five hours. When we were rescued, we all suffered oxygen deprivation. I had lost all memory of the murder.Phoenix:Lost your memory?Edgeworth:Even now, I can't recall what happened in that elevator. That was the crux of Yogi's argument in court. He claimed Yanni Yogi had been \"not of sound mind\" due to the oxygen deprivation. Yogi was released due to a lack of evidence... innocent. That's when I changed my mind. I started to hate defense attorneys.Prosecutor von KarmaPhoenix:What's your relationship with von Karma?Edgeworth:He's my teacher, and a man who deserves respect. I learned everything I know of courtroom techniques from him.Maya:So, he's like my sister was to you, Nick.Edgeworth:He is a perfectionist in all things. In court... In his personal life... He is obsessed with doing everything perfectly.Maya:Perfectly, huh?Edgeworth:In all the cases he has taken on, none were left unsolved. And not one suspect was declared innocent. Ever.Maya:But... but that's...Edgeworth:I know. It's possible some of the suspects were indeed innocent. However, it is impossible for us to accurately determine that in every case. All von Karma does is his job, to find the suspect guilty, perfectly. In any case... It's nigh well impossible to find a weakness in him. Should a weakness appear, he would do everything in his power to make it go away.Phoenix:Um, Edgeworth? If what you're saying is true, you're headed for a guilty sentence tomorrow!Maya:H-he's right! Now's no time to be praising the enemy, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:Mmph... It's a strange situation in which I find myself, I'll admit.Phoenix:(No kidding.)PresentLake PhotoEdgeworth:What are you showing me this picture for?Phoenix:Um, uh, no reason.Edgeworth:... You know, I was impressed by your deduction in the trial today. Granted, you were at the end of your rope, but still.Maya:Nick, he noticed.Phoenix:Hah hah.DL-6 Case FileEdgeworth:... It was that case that changed my life. And tomorrow, on December 28, its statute of limitations runs out.Phoenix:(Tomorrow... Could that be a coincidence?)Edgeworth:But... even if the case is finally closed on paper... It will never be erased from my memory. Never...Maya:Poor Mr. Edgeworth!DL-6 Incident PhotoMaya:N-Nick! No! Th-that's a photo of his father! Don't show him that!Phoenix:(You're right... Now probably isn't a good time to dredge up those old memories...)Edgeworth:What is it?Phoenix:Uh, um, n-nothing.Edgeworth:Huh?Anything elseEdgeworth:Sorry. I'm not sure I can help you with that.December 27Gourd Lake ParkEntranceGumshoe:Hey, pal! Long time no see!Maya:Oh! Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:Close one today, eh! I got so worked up, I snapped my tie in half!Phoenix:Uh... Sorry about that.Gumshoe:No prob, pal! Thanks to you, we now know who really did it!Maya:You mean, the boat shop caretaker?Gumshoe:Look, I'll make you a promise. I'll have that scoundrel in my custody by trial time tomorrow! Come what may! It's my duty to you as a police officer! Now, I'm off to catch me a criminal!Maya:... Detective Gumshoe sure is... active today.Gumshoe:Oh, one other thing!Maya:Eek!Gumshoe:No one can go into the woods today.Maya:The woods?Phoenix:(Where Lotta was camping?)Gumshoe:The woods are off-limits to camping, and apparently the park ranger found out. He got pretty mad. No one can go in for a while.Maya:I guess Lotta's in a 'lotta' trouble...Gumshoe:Anyway, I'll be seeing you tomorrow!December 27Gourd LakePublic BeachPhoenix:Huh?

At least the place is well maintained.BenchMaya:No one's going to sit here on a cold day like today.

Mr. Edgeworth's trial ends tomorrow!Grossberg:Er... that is true, yes. But, from what I saw of today's trial, Edgeworth should be fine, right?Phoenix:Well... I'm not so sure about that.Grossberg:Ho ho! What do you mean by that?Phoenix:Well... I'm not sure.Grossberg:Hmm... If you find anything out, come by my office at once.

You mean picture of the fish they caught, right?Maya:Right... but don't all the fish on the wall here look really puny to you?Phoenix:Well, you know what they say... \"You shoulda seen the one that got away!\"Maya:Except the one that got away from us was the caretaker! And we did see him!Phoenix:(Why do I feel like we're having two different conversations here?)Fishing polePhoenix:This fishing pole looks expensive.Maya:Maybe we should bring it to Detective Gumshoe.Phoenix:Don't you think the caretaker would mind?Maya:Well, we can just leave him the metal detector in exchange!Phoenix:Uh... maybe we'd better not.TablePhoenix:Hmm. Everything's cold. Looks like he didn't turn his heater on. I guess he hasn't been back here since the trial.TelevisionMaya:Aah!Phoenix:W-what's wrong?Maya:Huh? Oh... N-never mind.Phoenix:What?

The only thing in here is a letter.Maya:A letter? Aww... boring!Phoenix:(Hmm... There's no name or signature on this thing. It's handwritten in very precise, clear letters...) ... \"Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth...\" Edgeworth!Maya:N-N-Nick! Why would Mr. Edgeworth's name be on here...?Phoenix:How should I know!?

It's all here... in perfect detail!) ...Maya:What do you think it means, Nick?Phoenix:I don't know... but it looks like these are instructions for that caretaker. When he killed Robert Hammond and called out Edgeworth, he was following instructions!Maya:But who could have written that letter? And... what does it mean, to \"get revenge on Miles Edgeworth\"...?Phoenix:Look, I don't know, okay? But one thing's for certain.

We only have today to get to the bottom of this!Detention CenterTalkYanni Yogi (after presenting Letter from the Safe)Edgeworth:Yanni Yogi was a court bailiff at the time. We just happened to be in that elevator together 15 years ago. The quake was incredibly strong... Before I knew it, everything was dark. We were there for so long, it felt like forever. The air thinned... and the darkness closed in on us in that little box. We became... unsettled.\"H-help! I can't breathe!\"\"Quiet! I said quiet! You're not making this any easier!\"\"I want to get out! Help! Get us out!\"\"Don't shout! You'll just use up more oxygen!\"\"...!\"Edgeworth:That's all I remember... When I came to, I was in a hospital bed, staring up at the ceiling. In court, Yanni Yogi's mental condition was called into question. They claimed the oxygen deprivation and stress had caused temporary insanity. In the end, the claim passed the court, and Yogi was found innocent.Maya:Huh... But, isn't that strange? This letter tells him to \"get revenge on Edgeworth\"... Why would he want to take revenge on you?Edgeworth:... Wright.Phoenix:Yeah?Edgeworth:There's something that's been troubling me these last few days. I... didn't know whether or not I should tell you.Phoenix:You mean the nightmare?Edgeworth:It's... a nightmare I've had. A memory of a crime... that I committed.Phoenix:A crime you committed?Edgeworth:... A memory... of a murder.Edgeworth:I think... I think the time has come to tell all.The nightmare (appears after \"Yanni Yogi\")Edgeworth:For the last 15 years, I've had the same dream almost every night. I wake up in a fearful sweat, every time.Maya:What kind of dream?Edgeworth:It's a dream about my father's killing... in the dark.\"H-help! I can't breathe!\"\"Quiet! I said quiet! You're not making this any easier!\"\"I want to get out! Help! Get us out!\"\"Don't shout! You'll just use up more oxygen!\"\"I... I can't breathe!

I don't know if it was evidence from that day in court, or the bailiff's... In a daze, I pick up the pistol...Edgeworth:(Get away...! Get away from my father!)*BANG*Uuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Edgeworth:And with that scream... I wake. It's a bone-chilling scream. A scream that has rung in my ears for the past 15 years.Maya:... B-but... That's just a dream, right? Right?Edgeworth:... That thought is the only thing that has kept me sane for the last 15 years. But what if I'm wrong? What if it's real? They say that sometimes people shut out memories in self-defense. Maybe it was I who killed my father!Maya:What!?Edgeworth:If you think about it that way, this letter makes sense. \"Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth.\" Think about it. Yogi was really innocent. That's why he wanted revenge against me!Phoenix:Wait, Edgeworth! You... you mean...!Edgeworth:It was me. I was the true criminal of DL-6. I shot my father!Phoenix:This is bad...Maya:What are we doing to do, Nick? What can we do!?Phoenix:I don't know... I don't think there is anything we can do. Like it or not. If there's someone else who knows a lot about the DL-6 Incident, maybe...Maya:...! There is, Nick! There is someone else who knows about DL-6!PresentLetter from the SafePhoenix:Edgeworth... See this letter?Edgeworth:Hmm?Phoenix:This came out of the safe in the shack where that boat rental caretaker lives.Edgeworth:I see... ...! Revenge... on me?Maya:Who is that old guy, anyway!?Edgeworth:I... I don't know.Phoenix:Could he be an innocent defendant you got declared guilty or something?Edgeworth:Nice, Wright. But I don't remember that old man. Not at all.Maya:So, he was following this letter, then?Edgeworth:Which means there was someone else behind it!\"Now is the time to get revenge on the two men who ruined your life! (Changed from [Now is your time to get revenge on the two men who ruined your life!] in the original release)\"Edgeworth:Two men... meaning myself and Robert Hammond?Maya:It also says: \"This is your last chance!\"Phoenix:Last chance...? Wait, maybe... Maybe he's talking about the statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident!Edgeworth:... Wait... Wait, that old man...!Maya:Wh-what is it!? Do you know who he is!?Edgeworth:Yogi... Could he be Yogi!?Maya:Yogi?Edgeworth:The suspect in the DL-6 Incident. The one who was found innocent.After clearing \"The nightmare\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:December 27Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:M-Mr. Grossberg!Grossberg:Ah, hello there. What's wrong? You look troubled.Maya:No kidding! I can't believe you're not!Grossberg:M-my my my... Just calm down and tell me what's happened, hmm?Maya:It's M-Mr. Edgeworth! He... He... *sob*Grossberg:I see... So, Edgeworth dreamt he shot his own father?Maya:It's o-only a dream! Only a dream!Grossberg:... I wonder...Maya:W-what...?Grossberg:If that's the case, then why do you two look so troubled, hmm?Maya:W-well...Grossberg:Also, consider this. Yogi quite certainly holds a deep grudge against Miles Edgeworth. So deep, he'd want to frame him for murder. This leads me to surmise... That Mr. Edgeworth's dream was NOT a dream. It was real. As you imagined. Miles Edgeworth threw the pistol to save his father... the pistol fired... and the deed was done. ...Maya:N... No! I don't believe it!Grossberg:Yogi was suspected of murder, and his career as bailiff was irrevocably wrecked. Thus, he sought revenge on Miles Edgeworth. This was his last chance, of course, with the statute of limitations so close.TalkGregory EdgeworthPhoenix:What do you know about Edgeworth's father?Grossberg:... He was a defense attorney without peer. It sounds trite, but it's true. Well, he may have had one peer now that I think about it. Your mentor, Mia Fey.Maya:My sister...?Grossberg:Gregory Edgeworth was very disapproving of Mr. von Karma's techniques.Phoenix:(That's no surprise...)Grossberg:von Karma is an extreme man. Forged testimonies and evidence are nothing to him. The result: he has a perfect win record in court. To beat him, Gregory Edgeworth tried to call attention to his methods.Maya:And...?Grossberg:He lost. And died in despair, as it were.Maya:I see...The spirit mediumGrossberg:When Gregory Edgeworth was killed, the police called on a spirit medium. That was your mother, Misty Fey.\"I am Gregory Edgeworth... I have been killed... The one who shot me... was the bailiff... Yanni Yogi.\"Grossberg:Yet Yogi was found innocent.Maya:That's when my mother left us. Everyone called her a fraud.Grossberg:That's right. Everyone thought she was, you see. Yet... now that I think about it. It seem the one who lied was Gregory Edgeworth's ghost... Gregory Edgeworth must have known who shot him.Phoenix:I don't believe it... So you're saying he falsified his \"testimony\"? That Edgeworth's dad lied to protect his son...?Grossberg:It's only a possibility, mind you. But... a possibility nonetheless.Prosecutor von Karma (appears after presenting Letter from the Safe)Grossberg:If it truly was von Karma who wrote this letter, then he would know the truth. He would know that Miles Edgeworth had accidentally killed his own father.Phoenix:...!Grossberg:He'll say as much tomorrow in court, I should think. He'll press the point until the court finds Miles Edgeworth \"guilty.\"Phoenix:Oh no!Maya:B-but how could von Karma know about Mr. Edgeworth's past like that? Even Mr. Edgeworth thought it was just a nightmare!Grossberg:Hmm... That, I do not know. Yet I do know that von Karma is both persistent... and a perfectionist. He may be seeking to satisfy a grudge against Gregory Edgeworth by hurting his son.Phoenix:What do you mean?Grossberg:It was fifteen years ago... von Karma met Gregory Edgeworth in court, and von Karma did win... But he didn't make it through the trial unscarred.Gregory vs. Manfred (appears after \"Prosecutor von Karma\")Phoenix:What happened in the trial between Edgeworth's dad and von Karma?Grossberg:von Karma got the \"guilty\" verdict he wanted. He won the trial. But Gregory Edgeworth accused von Karma of faulty evidence. And though he lost the trial, Mr. Edgeworth's accusation stood.Maya:Faulty evidence?Grossberg:It was the only penalty von Karma has ever received in his career as a prosecutor. Gregory Edgeworth dealt a blow to his perfect trial record.Maya:Wow.Grossberg:It must have been quite a shock for von Karma. He took a vacation for several months after that, you see.Phoenix:A vacation...?Grossberg:Yes, an unusual event for the man. That was the first, and the last vacation he's taken in his many years of prosecuting.Maya:Really!? He doesn't take vacations!? Like... go to the sea, or, uh, to the mountains? Don't tell me he's never been to Europe!?Phoenix:You have strange ideas about vacations, Maya.Grossberg:In any case... That was the only time he took a vacation from work. I believe the penalty upset him quite a lot.Phoenix:(Odd... If he wanted to keep a perfect record so badly... why would he take such a long vacation?)Maya:What do we do, Nick? von Karma is going to bring up DL-6, you can bet on it! What if Mr. Edgeworth pleads guilty to DL-6!?Phoenix:I won't let him!Grossberg:Erm, yes, Mr. Wright... I hate to say this... But even accidental murder is murder, you know.Phoenix:I know that! ... I... I just believe in Edgeworth's innocence! I can't believe he'd kill someone!Maya:B-but, Nick! Mr. Edgeworth admits it himself! His father must have lied to protect him, from beyond the grave...Phoenix:I don't care! I know he's not guilty!Grossberg:... Mr. Wright... If you say so, I suppose I could go check again. The police files might hold something of interest.Phoenix:Mr. Grossberg... thank you!Grossberg:I can't promise anything. In fact, I think the chances of finding something are slim.Phoenix:I understand. (The police materials... hmm.)PresentLake PhotoGrossberg:In any case, it's good that the one shooting isn't Miles.Phoenix:You bet it's good!

I wonder what would have become of von Karma were he alive...Letter from the SafeGrossberg:Oh ho! So this is the letter? It does seem that Yogi was following this letter... when he killed Hammond.Maya:But, why kill Robert Hammond?Grossberg:Hammond was a skilled defense attorney. But... he defended clients not for their sake, but for his own.Phoenix:Huh? His own sake?Grossberg:He never trusted his clients, that one. The only thing he trusted was his own ability.Maya:But, he got his client found innocent. So why should it matter?Grossberg:Actually, my dear, it's quite different. He won that innocent verdict for no one but himself. Yogi was a free man, but socially, he was ruined.Phoenix:(Huh...?)Grossberg:You'll understand soon enough. ... Wait!Phoenix:What is it?Grossberg:This letter... I've seen this handwriting somewhere before... a long time ago! Whose handwriting was this...?

It's been a while since I've had a defense attorney last this long. Still, you will lose in the end. Miles Edgeworth will admit his own guilt.Phoenix:His guilt of 15 years ago, you mean?Karma:... You're quite the researcher. If you've done your homework so well, then certainly, you must understand. You know what Miles Edgeworth will tell the court tomorrow.Phoenix:(We were right... So von Karma is going to bring up DL-6 in court tomorrow.)PresentLetter from the SafeLeads to:\"Mr. von Karma, have a look at this.\"Anything elseKarma:Fool. You think I, a prosecutor, would give you, a defense attorney, information? Bah!Maya:(Creep!)Phoenix:Mr. von Karma, have a look at this.Karma:...Phoenix:This was you, wasn't it? You instructed Yanni Yogi to commit murder.Karma:... Yanni Yogi... How many years has it been since I've heard him called by that name. He's a fool. I told him to burn it after he read it.Maya:...! S-so you admit it! You... you wrote Mr. Yogi this letter!Karma:Yes, my dear defense attorney. Thank you for taking the trouble to bring it to me. You've saved me from a lot of needless hassle.Phoenix:Wh-what!?Maya:N-Nick! What is that thing!?Phoenix:A stun gun. For self defense... usually.Karma:Indeed. 600,000 volts will course through your body like a dog touching an electric fence.Phoenix:Six hundred thous...!?Karma:Oh, don't worry. People don't die from it, usually. Now, give me the letter.Phoenix:(No!!!)Maya:Nooooooooooo!Karma:Whoa! What are you--!?Maya:N-Nick! Run!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!Phoenix:M-Maya!Karma:Out of my way!Phoenix:Waaaaaaaaaaaah!... ... ...Phoenix:(Ugh... he got us. The letter's... gone, of course. And he took the DL-6 evidence... all of it. Back to having no clues. Wait... Maya jumped first. Maya...! Is she okay? ...) Ma...Maya!Maya:...Phoenix:Maya! Open your eyes!Maya:...Phoenix:Maya!Maya:... The letter! Did he take it?Phoenix:Huh!? Oh... yeah. A-are you okay!?Maya:... I... I couldn't stop him. I jumped as fast as I could, but one shot from that thing knocked me out cold. I'm useless. I'm not good as a lawyer, or a medium! I can't even call my sister. Not even now, when we need her the most. I wish I hadn't woken up at all.Phoenix:Maya! (Grr! There has to be some way I can help her! I'd better do something about her self-confidence, first.) ...? (Maya... She's holding something! What is that? A bullet?) \"DL-6 Incident, Evidence No. 7 Taken from the heart of Gregory Edgeworth.\" I remember... von Karma was holding this when Maya jumped him.DL-6 Bullet stashed in a pocket. (Changed from [Put DL-6 Bullet in pocket.] in the original release)Phoenix:(I'll prove it to you, Maya. You're most definitely not useless! I'll prove it to you in court tomorrow!)To be continued.Nothing to examine during investigationPhoenix:No clues here.",

I ask that the prosecution submit decisive evidence.Karma:Understood.Judge:...Phoenix:(C'mon! Don't be awed into silence by every little thing he says!)Judge:Very well, Mr. von Karma, your opening statement.Karma:Right. Thanks to Detective Gumshoe's efforts, the boat rental shop caretaker has been arrested. In yesterday's trial, the defense asserted that the caretaker was the murderer. However, the caretaker has yet to confirm this. I would like to ask the defense to cross-examine him as much as necessary.Judge:Very well! Please bring the witness into the courtroom.Karma:Ladies and gentlemen of the court... I believe you all remember our witness. He lives in the boat rental shop on the lake, from where he witnessed the incident. In addition, he has currently lost memory of his name and identity.Judge:Witness!

What!? No fingerprints!?Uncle:Er... you see, before I worked as a caretaker, I worked at a chemical plant. I burned my fingers working with the stuff. Ayup.Phoenix:Wh-what!? (Yogi, you sneak! You burned your fingerprints off to hide your past!)Judge:Hmm... Well, if the witness has no fingerprints... I guess we will not be able to prove his identity.Phoenix:(No...!)Karma:Tsk tsk tsk... Well, what will you do, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:Uh...Karma:Hmm? It seems that the case has been decided, no?Phoenix:(No!!! I know what happened! I know everything! I... I just can't prove it! But no...

We have a duty to hear Mr. Edgeworth out.Leads to:\"For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream.\"Leave it to EdgeworthPhoenix:(No... I'm sure Edgeworth thought about this one long and hard. This isn't my place to interfere!)Maya:Nick, are you sure!?Phoenix:There's nothing we can do about it. This is his problem, now.Leads to:\"For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream.\"Edgeworth:For fifteen years... I have had a recurring dream. A nightmare... it's only a nightmare. That's what I told myself. But now I know, it wasn't a dream. Yanni Yogi wasn't the killer.Judge:You mean... in the incident where your father died?Edgeworth:From the distance of the shot, it wasn't suicide, either. Everything was as clear as day. The murderer... The criminal in the DL-6 Incident... It was me! Your Honor! I confess my guilt! I am guilty for DL-6, the statute of limitations of which ends today! The culprit... is me!Judge:Order! Order! This is certainly unexpected! The defendant, declared innocent, is confessing to a different crime! A crime for which the statute of limitations runs out today! I'm not really sure how I should deal with this...Karma:Bah! It's obvious. We hold a trial. Right here. Right now. We try this man for his crime of fifteen years ago!Judge:I think... I think I would like to take a five-minute recess. During this time, I will consider the appropriate course of action to take. Court is adjourned!December 28, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Edgeworth:I'm sorry, Wright. I've just wasted all of your effort.Gumshoe:... Mr. Edgeworth... I just don't believe it, sir! (Changed from [Mr. Edgeworth... I just don't believe it, pal!] in the original release) I mean, you... kill your dad?Edgeworth:I didn't want to believe it myself, Detective! But... it's the truth. I deserve to be punished. Murder is murder, no matter what the circumstances.Gumshoe:This is crazy! Just crazy!Maya:... ...? Nick? What are you doing?Phoenix:Huh? Oh... I was just reading through the Court Record once more. I'm getting my case ready.Maya:Your case... for what?Phoenix:Huh? Isn't it obvious? I'm going to prove that Miles Edgeworth is innocent.Gumshoe:...! Wh-what are you talking about, pal! He just admitted to it! He confessed that he did it! In court!Phoenix:I'm sorry, Edgeworth. But I don't believe in your \"nightmare.\"Edgeworth:Wh-what!?Phoenix:It's just a dream. It's not real. The truth is right here in this Court Record. In any case, tighten your belts. The real fight is just beginning. I'll prove you're innocent. Trust me.Edgeworth:W-Wright...December 28, 2:30 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:Now then, I would like to resume our trial. (Changed from [Then, I would like to resume our trial.] in the original release)Karma:Judge! Miles Edgeworth has admitted his own guilt. He has confessed his crime. Let us begin by hearing his testimony. Then, though pointless, let the defense do their cross-examining. The statute of limitations on the DL-6 Incident runs out today. Though it's unconventional for me, I'd like to run this one by the book.Judge:I see. Does the defense have any objections?Phoenix:No, Your Honor. (von Karma... you knew this was going to happen from the very beginning, didn't you!)Judge:Very well. Will Miles Edgeworth take the stand?Karma:Will the witness state his name and profession.Edgeworth:Miles Edgeworth... I am a prosecuting attorney.Karma:Mr. Edgeworth. Fifteen years ago, you mistakenly killed your father, Gregory Edgeworth. Is this correct?Edgeworth:... It is correct.Karma:Then testify about this matter to the court.Phoenix:(When Edgeworth was telling me about his dream yesterday I noticed something... One detail didn't quite fit. That will be the key... but only if I can get it to work!)Maya:Please... Please...Witness Testimony-- The DL-6 Incident --Edgeworth:That day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials.As we went to leave, an earthquake struck, trapping us in the elevator.My father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue.Just then, something heavy fell at my feet.I picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting.A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream.It was a terrible scream. I remember it to this day.That's all.Judge:Hmm... And, until now, you thought this memory was a \"dream\"?Edgeworth:We were stuck in that elevator for five hours. The oxygen in the elevator ran out, and I lost my memory of the events.Karma:Bah! The same claim Mr. Yogi has made!Judge:Very well. Mr. Wright? Your cross-examination, please.Phoenix:Yes, Your Honor.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The DL-6 Incident --Edgeworth:That day, I had gone to the courtroom to observe one of my father's trials.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What was the trial your father was involved in on that day?Edgeworth:I don't remember things very clearly. Only two things... I know my father lost, and Mr. von Karma was the prosecuting attorney.Judge:Mr. von Karma? You were handling that case?Karma:It was fifteen years ago. I don't remember the details.Phoenix:(That was when Edgeworth pointed out the problem in von Karma's evidence...)Edgeworth:As we went to leave, an earthquake struck, trapping us in the elevator.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So, there were three people including yourself trapped in that elevator?Edgeworth:Yes. Myself, my father, and Yanni Yogi. We were fine at first... But then as time passed, and no one came to help...Edgeworth:My father and Mr. Yogi lost their composure, and began to argue.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What did you do then?Edgeworth:I was a nine-year-old boy at the time. What could I do? I was scared... Trembling, in the corner. But then...Edgeworth:Just then, something heavy fell at my feet.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What was it?Edgeworth:A pistol. I assume it was the bailiff, Yanni Yogi's. The safety must have come off when it fell from his holster.Karma:And you picked it up. What happened next?Edgeworth:I picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Did you know it was a pistol when you threw it?Edgeworth:I think I knew. I knew it was dangerous. But... the air was getting so thick. I panicked.Karma:So, you're saying that you threw the pistol at Mr. Yogi.Edgeworth:I was... in a daze.Edgeworth:A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:The gun fired once?Edgeworth:Yes... I think... after I threw it, I lost consciousness. Since then... They've echoed in my head, every day. That gunshot, and that horrible scream.Phoenix:The scream...Present DL-6 Case FilePhoenix:Phoenix:Are you sure you only heard one gunshot?Edgeworth:Yes. I'm sure of that. I heard the shot, and the scream... Then everything faded. I was unconscious until the rescuers came.Judge:I see...Phoenix:No, Your Honor, unfortunately, you don't.

Was there, perhaps, another shooter who fired that second shot?Karma:Karma:Your Honor. As I'm sure you're aware... This incident occurred fifteen years ago. The evidence is dated... The pistol did fire twice. However, we do not know WHEN that second shot was fired. It might have been fired the day before the incident! There is no proof that the second shot had anything to do with this incident!Phoenix:(What...!)Judge:Hmm... I see, I see. You do have a point. Mr. Wright?

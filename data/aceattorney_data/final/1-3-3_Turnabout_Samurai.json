Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people!Phoenix:Young...?

When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, \"Steel Samurai\" was no. 1! ([no. 1] written as [no.1] in the original release)Phoenix:I really worry about kids these days.Maya:Gramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office.Phoenix:I guess... Wish we had some clients!Phoenix:A month has passed since my trial. Mia's murder was the talk of the town for some time... But no one paid any attention to the Wright & Co. Law Offices... How am I going to pay the rent this month?Maya:It'll be okay. I'm sure some big client is just around the corner!Phoenix:Hmph.October 16, 8:14 AMPhoenix Wright's BedroomCellular:Brrrrring... Brrrrring...*beep*Phoenix:H-hello?

They're saying that the Steel Samurai killed a villain!Phoenix:... Umm... Isn't that what he's supposed to do?Maya:Yeah, on TV!Phoenix:Yeah, on TV.Maya:No! I mean, he actually did it! In real life! He skewered a villain with his Samurai Spear!Phoenix:I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.Maya:Just come to the office, quick! Please, Nick!Cellular:*beep*October 16, 9:22 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:(Maya's here... watching television.)TV:Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.\" He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the \"Evil Magistrate.\" His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The \"Samurai Spear\" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.Phoenix:... This has to be a joke.Maya:No, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over!Cellular:Brrrrring... Brrrrring...*beep*Maya:Yes... Wright & Co. Law Offices. ... What!? Nick!

Go where?Maya:They have the Steel Samurai down in detention!Phoenix:So what!?Maya:So, I've decided this will be our first case!ExamineBookshelfPhoenix:There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.HouseplantPhoenix:Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.Movie posterPhoenix:A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.DeskPhoenix:Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.WindowPhoenix:It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.TalkWhat to doPhoenix:Well, what should we do?Maya:What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!Phoenix:(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)Any ideasMaya:We don't have enough information to make a case yet.Phoenix:Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.Maya:No! We just don't have enough information!PresentAttorney's BadgePhoenix:What about this?Maya:You like showing that off, don't you, Nick?Phoenix:(My poor, poor ego...)Anything elsePhoenix:What about this?Maya:Sorry, but I don't see how that will help us figure this out...October 16Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:...Phoenix:What's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh!Maya:Umm... Is that guy really him?Phoenix:Whaddya mean \"that guy\"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him.Maya:Um, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.Phoenix:Whoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?Will:Umm...Maya:Y-yes!?Will:Something wrong...?Maya:N-no! No!Phoenix:(This is getting off to a great start.)Will:I know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?Maya:D-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.Will:No, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams.Maya:Oh...Will:I guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!Maya:Nick!Phoenix:What?Maya:He's a good guy! I mean, he's good!Phoenix:Yeah.Maya:He didn't do it!Phoenix:...ExamineSecurity cameraPhoenix:Smile for the camera...Security guardPhoenix:This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.TalkWhat happenedPhoenix:Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.Will:Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.Phoenix:The \"Samurai Spear\"...?Will:Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.The Steel SamuraiPhoenix:Maybe you could explain to me just what \"the Steel Samurai\" is.Maya:Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.Phoenix:Hey! Who's \"new to this\"!?Will:No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!Phoenix:I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)Powers's alibi (appears after \"What happened\")Phoenix:Now, where were you on the day of the murder?Will:Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.Phoenix:(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)Will:What will the kids think? *sniff*PresentAttorney's BadgePhoenix:Um, here.Will:I... I see. ...Phoenix:(Let me guess... this guy wasn't the top student in improv class.)Anything elseWill:I-I'm sorry. I'm sure that's very important and all. I just don't see what it has to do with my problem.After clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option:Phoenix:I think I should probably check out the scene of the murder...Will:Right... Global Studios. I'll draw you a map.Maya:Wow! Nick! Let's go!Phoenix:(I'm willing to bet 10 bucks she asks for autographs.)Wright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)TalkWhat to doPhoenix:Well, what should we do?Maya:Sitting around here won't get us anywhere, that's for sure. The studio! We should go to the studio! I'm sure we could find some clues there!Phoenix:(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)October 16Global StudiosMain GateMaya:Wow! So this is where they make the Steel Samurai show! Awesome! Aren't you excited!?Oldbag:Hey! You there! You want in, you gotta go through me!Maya:O-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers.Oldbag:Oh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.Maya:G-gawkers?Oldbag:Gawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...Maya:Umm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say \"no.\"Phoenix:I dunno! It's possible.Oldbag:Hey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today!ExamineComputerPhoenix:The computer that runs the studio security cameras.Oldbag:Hey! No touching!Guard stationPhoenix:The security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.Main gatePhoenix:The main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.Studio mapPhoenix:An overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.Studio vanPhoenix:Looks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.TalkThe studiosPhoenix:So, what do you do here at the studios?Oldbag:At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...Maya:No! You were a star!?Oldbag:Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.Maya:Wo... wow.Oldbag:This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...Phoenix:Hammer...?Oldbag:The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...Will PowersPhoenix:Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?Oldbag:He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his \"big chance.\" No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...Maya:We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!Oldbag:Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.Mr. Hammer (appears after \"The studios\")Phoenix:What kind of person was Jack Hammer?Oldbag:What \"kind of person\"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!Phoenix:(Should I have heard of that...?)Oldbag:But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.Reason for suspicion (appears after \"Will Powers\")Phoenix:Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?Oldbag:I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!Phoenix:And... that person was Mr. Powers?Oldbag:Yes. I saw him!Phoenix:But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.Oldbag:Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.PresentAnythingOldbag:What's that? You giving that to me?Phoenix:(Absolutely not!)After clearing all Talk options:Oldbag:Isn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here. Move along.Phoenix:Um, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request.Oldbag:Hmph! I thought you were suspicious lookin'! Show me a \"letter of request.\" And maybe I'll just let you in.Maya:This lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously.Detention CenterWill:Hello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they?Maya:N-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick?Phoenix:Right, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect.Will:*sniff*TalkYour alibiPhoenix:Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?Will:W-what? No! I'd never do that!Phoenix:Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.Will:Yes. Like a baby.Phoenix:But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!Will:W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!Phoenix:Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.Will:I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?Phoenix:(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)The security ladyPhoenix:Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...Will:Oh, the security lady?Maya:She's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"!Will:Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.Maya:Grr! She's got some nerve!Phoenix:Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?Will:Of c-course.Powers's Request added to the Court Record.Phoenix:(I just hope this will get me past that security lady.)The security lady (subsequent times)Phoenix:Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...Will:Oh, the security lady?Maya:She's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"!Will:Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.Maya:Grr! She's got some nerve!PresentPowers's LetterPhoenix:Thank you for the letter of request.Will:Show that to the security lady and she should let you in.Wright & Co. Law OfficesPresentPowers's LetterPhoenix:Hey, look what I have!Maya:Hey! The Steel Samurai said we'd need that to get into the studio.Phoenix:You mean Will Powers said we'd need it...?Maya:Yes, the Steel Samurai.Phoenix:*sigh*Studio - Main GatePresentPowers's LetterLeads to:\"Ma'am, have a look at this.\"Phoenix:Ma'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers.Oldbag:Hmm...? Yes, yes. I recognize the bold, childish scrawl.Gave Powers's Request to the security lady.Oldbag:To think he would entrust his fate to youths of such unreliable appearance... Really!Phoenix:Really?Oldbag:Anyway, you may pass. But only left from here, toward the studios! No going to the right. That's the Employee Area. \"No one allowed inside, pal\" were my instructions. The good detective told me himself.Maya:Hey, hey, Nick.Phoenix:Huh?Maya:There were maps in the security guard station.Phoenix:Hey! Not bad!Oldbag:Those are 50 cents a piece,thank you!Maya:Well, time to go, Nick.Oldbag:50 cents!Guidemap of Global Studios added to the Court Record.October 16Studio One EntranceGumshoe:Hey! Aren't you that murderer from the other day!Maya:Aah! It's that confused detective!Gumshoe:Hey pal, you know Prosecutor Edgeworth is all upset, and it's your fault! I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window!Phoenix:Umm... so?Maya:Hey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work!Gumshoe:!!! ... ... ...Maya:Um, Detective?Phoenix:I think you hurt his feelings.Maya:Oh no! I... I'm sorry!Phoenix:Well, I think his feelings are easily hurt.Gumshoe:You're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart!Maya:Hey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case!Gumshoe:Yeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here?Maya:Um, well... We're on this case too, pal!Gumshoe:Huh!? Hey! You can't just go saying \"pal\" like that! That's MY endearing character trait!Maya:I'd say he's a character alright...ExamineBenchPhoenix:I'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here.Gumshoe:Hey, good idea, pal!Maya:Detective! Aren't you on the case?Gumshoe:W-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!Left pathPhoenix:Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?Gumshoe:Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.Statue with broken headPhoenix:The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]Maya:What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.Gumshoe:Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.Security cameraPhoenix:Hey, there's a camera here.Gumshoe:That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!Phoenix:There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.Studio One entrancePhoenix:The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.Maya:Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!Phoenix:Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.Welcome signMaya:There's a big welcome sign above the path.Gumshoe:Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.Maya:Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?Phoenix:Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.Gumshoe:Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?TalkThe investigationPhoenix:So, how is your investigation going, Detective?Gumshoe:Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.Maya:Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?Phoenix:Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?Gumshoe:What I got?Phoenix:The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...Gumshoe:Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.The investigation (subsequent times)Phoenix:So, how is your investigation going, Detective?Gumshoe:I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!Phoenix:(Oh well, it was worth a try.)Reason for arrestPhoenix:Why was Mr. Powers arrested?Gumshoe:Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.Maya:Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!Phoenix:Thanks for cheering me up...The security ladyPhoenix:About the security lady...Gumshoe:Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!Phoenix:Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?Gumshoe:When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!Maya:Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.Gumshoe:She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!Maya:Whaat!?Decisive evidence (appears after \"The security lady\")Phoenix:What kind of evidence!?Gumshoe:Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!Maya:What! Who took that!?Gumshoe:See the camera up on that gate, pal?Maya:The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?Gumshoe:Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!Maya:Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!Phoenix:(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)Gumshoe:...PresentAttorney's BadgePhoenix:Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.Gumshoe:Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!Phoenix:I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...Maya:Maybe it should just be a big \"L\" for \"Lawyer\"?Phoenix:Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.Anything elsePhoenix:Um, Detective. Any ideas about this?Gumshoe:Look, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?After clearing \"The investigation\" and \"Decisive evidence\" Talk options:Gumshoe:What's wrong, pal? You seem down.Phoenix:Don't look so happy when you say that.Gumshoe:Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh!Maya:Umm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...Gumshoe:Sure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!Phoenix:(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)Maya:Nick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!Studio - Main GateMaya:Nick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!Phoenix:Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...Oldbag:Hey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?Phoenix:(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)TalkPhotographic proofPhoenix:Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?Oldbag:Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.Reason for suspicionOldbag:This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!Phoenix:Maybe... it was you?Oldbag:Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.Phoenix:(She thinks I was joking.)Mr. HammerPhoenix:Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?Oldbag:Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!Phoenix:(\"Was\"? Past tense?)Maya:Oh yes! He was great as the \"Bearded Samurai\"!Oldbag:That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the \"Evil Magistrate\"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?Automatic camera (appears after \"Photographic proof\")Phoenix:About the security camera...Oldbag:Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?Phoenix:Don't look at me! How should I know?TalkWhat to doPhoenix:What do you think?Maya:That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.Phoenix:Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.Photographic proofPhoenix:Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.Maya:I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?Phoenix:Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?Maya:On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.October 16Detention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:...Maya:Apparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.Phoenix:Hmm... right.Gumshoe:Look pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!Phoenix:I have to ask him about that photograph!Maya:Oh well. Let's try again later.ExamineSecurity guardPhoenix:This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.October 16Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!ExamineBicyclePhoenix:Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?Maya:It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!Phoenix:Don't people cycle to get exercise!?Drain gratePhoenix:The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.Maya:Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!Phoenix:Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.Maya:Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!GratePhoenix:The grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on.Lunch tablePhoenix:The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.Maya:Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.Phoenix:You just had a burger!Maya:Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.Phoenix:(What!?)Stage backdropPhoenix:There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably \"Neo Olde Tokyo Castle.\"Dressing room doorPhoenix:The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.Maya:Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?Phoenix:What do you mean \"find\"!?Maya:You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!Phoenix:We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)Dressing room signPhoenix:There's a sign on the dressing room door. \"Mr. Will Powers\"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.Dressing room windowPhoenix:A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.Storage room doorPhoenix:That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.Maya:Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!Phoenix:Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio?Vending machinePhoenix:Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!Maya:W-wait! Look! \"Samurai Soda\"! Nick! Try this!Phoenix:(Ladies first...)October 16Global StudiosDressing RoomPhoenix:(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)Maya:No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?Phoenix:Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)ExamineCosmeticsPhoenix:There's a vast array of cosmetics here.Maya:Ooh! This is the wig he used in \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey\"! Nick! Try this on!Phoenix:No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?Maya:I, um, kinda like samurai movies.Phoenix:(\"Kinda\"...?)Costume rackPhoenix:There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.Maya:It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...Phoenix:(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)CouchPhoenix:Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...MirrorPhoenix:They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.BagMaya:Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.Phoenix:Hey, don't open that.Maya:Look!Phoenix:An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says \"Studio One.\"Maya:Let's take it, Nick!Phoenix:Borrow it. You mean borrow.Cardkey added to the Court Record.Bag (subsequent times)Maya:I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?Phoenix:Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)TablePhoenix:There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...Maya:Nick... I'm hungry!Phoenix:You just had a burger!Maya:Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!Phoenix:(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)WindowPhoenix:It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.Wright & Co. Law OfficesPresentCardkeyMaya:Oh, hey!

No, that's mine!Oldbag:Look, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died.Phoenix:W... well you'll just have to wait!Outside Studio OneExamineStudio One entrancePhoenix:The entrance to Studio One.

We're in!Phoenix:(She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.)PresentCardkeyMaya:Hey, Detective! Take a look at this!Gumshoe:Whazzat?Phoenix:Whoa whoa whoa! Don't show him that! He'll confiscate it!Maya:Aww... I just wanted to show it off.After examining Studio One entrance in Studio One Entrance:October 16Studio OneMaya:...Phoenix:What is it?Maya:...Phoenix:You're real quiet all of a sudden.Maya:Doesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real!Phoenix:Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...ExamineDirector's chairMaya:Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that.

Action!Phoenix:(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)Film cameraLeads to:\"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\"Reflecting screenMaya:What's this?Phoenix:That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that.

Or maybe the Steel Samurai!Phoenix:(I think she's being serious...!)Stage backdropPhoenix:Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.Maya:Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!Phoenix:Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?Maya:Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! \"Neo\" Olde Tokyo!Phoenix:Oh. Right.(Step)ladderMaya:Look, a ladder!Phoenix:That's a \"step\"-ladder.Maya:So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!Phoenix:R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)Tape outlinePhoenix:They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...Maya:Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!Phoenix:Yeah! So don't touch it!Maya:Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...???:Hey! You! No touching that!Phoenix:Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...Maya:\"Y'know\"!? No I don't know!Phoenix:Umm... who are you?Penny:Who me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera.Maya:We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.Penny:Oh, you're WP's people.Maya:\"WP\"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.Penny:I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.Maya:Don't worry, leave it to us!TalkThe day of the crimePhoenix:Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?Penny:Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.Maya:Only one assistant!?Penny:Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.Maya:Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)Penny:In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.Phoenix:The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?Penny:Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.Will PowersPhoenix:Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?Penny:No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?Phoenix:W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)PresentAnythingPhoenix:Um, any thoughts about this?Penny:Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...Phoenix:Hmm...Penny:Umm... Sorry... I know you're busy.Phoenix:Not really.Penny:Actually, there's been something bothering me.Maya:Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!Penny:Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...Phoenix:You \"sensed\"?Penny:Yes, several times.Phoenix:Some other studio employees, maybe?Penny:No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.Phoenix:R-really!?Maya:But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?Phoenix:Yeah, you're right.Penny:I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.Maya:No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!TalkSensing someonePhoenix:So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?Penny:Yes... I think.Phoenix:(\"I think\" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.)Maya:Nick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them!October 16Global StudiosMain GateOldbag:What? You're still here? Really!

I saw that suspicious look on your face!Phoenix:I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?Oldbag:Sure as can be!Maya:But we have a witness who thinks there was \"someone from outside\" here that day.Oldbag:What!?Maya:Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?Oldbag:...Maya:Ma'am?Oldbag:Who was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?Maya:Eek!Oldbag:Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?Maya:Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.Oldbag:Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!Phoenix:She left...Maya:Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!ExamineComputerPhoenix:The computer that runs the studio security cameras.Maya:Nick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer!Phoenix:Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)Try itPhoenix:Okay. Let's give it a try.Maya:You know how to work these things, Nick?Phoenix:Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)[Please enter the number of the security camera.]ST1-703Phoenix:There!

Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?Phoenix:Yeah.Maya:We'll put that security lady in her place with this!Phoenix:Right, we'll put her in her place...Maya:Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!Phoenix:Wait. Let's not.Maya:Why not?Phoenix:It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.Maya:Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!Phoenix:Hey! Why do I have to be the villain.Maya:Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?Phoenix:I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was!

Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip itLeads to:\"I think I can probably remember that...\"Listen againPhoenix:I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?Gumshoe:I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.Phoenix:(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)Leads back to:\"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?\"Phoenix:(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:So the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"Judge:Understood.Edgeworth:Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag:... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:Y-your name, please!Oldbag:Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"Edgeworth:YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:Yessey I was.Judge:And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:You know your stuff, dearie!Judge:... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?Oldbag:Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.Phoenix:(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)Edgeworth:Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:A \"run-through\"...?Oldbag:They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.Phoenix:(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)Edgeworth:If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What kind of \"errands\"?Oldbag:Oh, well, you know.Phoenix:Answer the question!Oldbag:Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?Phoenix:O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?Oldbag:Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!Phoenix:(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)Oldbag:Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.Maya:Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!Phoenix:You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.Maya:Not a bad idea...Oldbag:Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Did you see the victim then?Oldbag:Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.Edgeworth:Tell us what happened next.Oldbag:I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?Oldbag:O-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!Phoenix:No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...Oldbag:I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!Maya:\"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.Phoenix:Why don't you raise an objection?Judge:So, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?PressPhoenix:Phoenix:How did you know that?Oldbag:Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.Edgeworth:...Phoenix:(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag:Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:2:00? You're sure?Oldbag:Sure as spit!Judge:Well, who was the man!?Oldbag:Really, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.Judge:...Oldbag:Now, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!Present Powers's(?) PhotoPhoenix:Leads to:\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Oldbag:It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So you saw Mr. Powers?Oldbag:That's what I said!

Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?Phoenix:Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you \"saw Mr. Powers,\" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the \"Mr. Powers\" that you saw!?Oldbag:Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:No, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:True, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!Judge:No one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.Phoenix:(He's having trouble calling her \"Oldbag\" apparently...)Judge:However, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?Oldbag:Humph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!Phoenix:What!?Edgeworth:Huh!?Phoenix:(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)Edgeworth:The prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:How was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me \"this isn't any good as evidence, pal.\" He didn't even give it a second look!Edgeworth:...Phoenix:(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)Judge:Let's hear about your proof, then.Witness Testimony-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:I never say anything I don't mean, mind you!That morning, during the run-through of the action scene...I saw Powers trip and fall!He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.Now, look at that picture!You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Judge:Hmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)Cross Examination-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:I never say anything I don't mean, mind you!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Umm...Oldbag:Whippersnapper!Phoenix:(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)Oldbag:I'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry...Edgeworth:Mr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!Phoenix:(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)Oldbag:That morning, during the run-through of the action scene...PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Who was present at the run-through?Oldbag:Well, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.Judge:And what exactly were you doing?Oldbag:Observing! Just... observing.Phoenix:What about the assistant?Oldbag:Oh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.Phoenix:(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)Oldbag:I saw Powers trip and fall!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:\"Trip and fall\"...?Oldbag:Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.Judge:You... helped make it better?Oldbag:I kissed it where it hurt.Judge:L-let's just skip over that part, shall we?Phoenix:Where was the assistant then?Oldbag:Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.Phoenix:(Hmm...)Edgeworth:You may continue your testimony.Oldbag:He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:He broke a prop?Oldbag:Sure did! His own Samurai Spear.Phoenix:(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)Oldbag:Luckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.Phoenix:(This strikes me as a significant detail...

He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.Phoenix:(Thus the nap...)Oldbag:Anyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked.Phoenix:(Dragging his foot... okay.)Oldbag:You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)Judge:Hmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.Oldbag:See! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!Oldbag:That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Still, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Yes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!Judge:He has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.Phoenix:(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)Maya:Well, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?Phoenix:Well, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...After pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:Edgeworth:I think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?Judge:Well, there is one thing that bothers me.Edgeworth:Which is?Judge:Where is this \"Steel Samurai\" costume now?Edgeworth:Umm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:Hmm...Edgeworth:Anyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!Judge:Hmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)ObjectPhoenix:Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!Judge:Hmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.Edgeworth:Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...Leads to:\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Wait and see what happensPhoenix:(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)Judge:I suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.Edgeworth:Most perceptive, Your Honor!Phoenix:(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)Leads to:\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Edgeworth:Will the witness continue her testimony, please?Oldbag:No need to ask twice!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account, cont. --Oldbag:The time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!No one else went there!If they had, I would have seen them!Judge:Hmm...

PhotoPhoenix:Leads to:\"Hold on!\"Oldbag:No one else went there!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What about before you got to the guard station?Oldbag:You mean before 1:00? Why, everyone was in the Employee Area before then. And I locked the main gate so no one could get in. Not to mention...Present Powers's(?) PhotoPhoenix:Leads to:\"Hold on!\"Oldbag:If they had, I would have seen them!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you sure!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:The witness has answered the question! Anyone going into the studio had to pass by the witness!Oldbag:That's right, sonny! You let 'em have it, Edgey-boy!Phoenix:(E-Edgey-boy...?)Edgeworth:...Present Powers's(?) PhotoPhoenix:Leads to:\"Hold on!\"Maya:Old windbag sure has balls! Or... well, you know what I mean.Phoenix:Old windbags have a way of skipping over important details, after all... Or, for that matter, entirely forgetting them.Maya:How convenient.Phoenix:(Something for you to look forward to, perhaps?)Phoenix:Hold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?Oldbag:Yesiree, sonny.Phoenix:So, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?Oldbag:And here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.Phoenix:Right... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.Oldbag:Ooh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.Phoenix:That very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]Oldbag:Even I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!Phoenix:Actually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: \"Photo #2\"...Oldbag:\"Photo #2\"...?Phoenix:The computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be \"Photo #1\" if it really was the ONLY photo!?Judge:Order! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:Actually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access-- the security lady herself! (Changed from [Only someone with access... the security lady herself!] in the original release)Oldbag:Eh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers!Phoenix:But the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!Oldbag:Umm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean...Judge:Can the witness explain this to the court?Oldbag:Umm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help!Edgeworth:Huh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either.Oldbag:Humph! Some help you are! You're a whippersnapper too! ... ... Whippersnapper...?Judge:Something the matter, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:Ah! That's right! I... I just remembered something!Judge:Let me guess... Someone else passed by the gate... someone other than the Steel Samurai?Oldbag:Er... well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way.Judge:*sigh* I see. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- The Other Person --Oldbag:Every day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do.I go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.I throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.Come to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!Edgeworth:M-Ms. Oldbag! This is the first I've heard of this!Oldbag:Well, of course, sonny! I've only just remembered it.Judge:Right... anyway, Mr. Wright, please begin the cross-examination.Maya:Well, I'd say this was a turn for the unexpected, but I kind of expected this...Cross Examination-- The Other Person --Oldbag:Every day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Another \"job\"?Oldbag:T-that's right. I check all the people that passed by the main gate that day. I look closely at every one of the photos that security camera takes.Edgeworth:Do you backup all of the security camera data?Oldbag:Well, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating.Oldbag:I go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:How many photos are there, usually?Oldbag:On a day when we're open to the public, we get more than 500 people. But on filming days or rehearsal days... well, we don't have much money. We never get more than 50, and that's a big day.Edgeworth:Do you backup all of the security camera data?Oldbag:Well, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating.Oldbag:I throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:How exactly do you determine what isn't \"suspicious lookin'\"?Oldbag:Oh, you can tell by looking at their faces. For the most part.Phoenix:F-for the most part? This is a murder trial, Ms. Oldbag!Oldbag:Well, I didn't touch that suspicious lookin' Will Powers's photo, did I?Phoenix:(I think she's missing the point.)Oldbag:Come to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!PressPhoenix:Leads to:\"Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?\"Maya:\"Come to think of it\"? Couldn't she think of that a little earlier!?Phoenix:Classic old windbag maneuver, Maya.Maya:Hmm... Might be a useful tactic to remember for use in my future career as a windbag.Phoenix:(Let's find out more about this \"erased\" photo.)Phoenix:Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?Oldbag:Humph. A fanboy.Phoenix:F-fanboy?Oldbag:Steel Samurai fanboys. Real freaks, if you ask me. They get information about the rehearsals from gosh-knows-where. They're always hanging about. One was there that day.Phoenix:Phoenix:W-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? \"I locked the main gate so no one could get in\"... Those were your words!Oldbag:Well! If you must know, there's a drain that goes into the Employee Area. The grate has been loose for a while. It leads outside, and well, that's where they come in.Phoenix:They come in through the drain?Oldbag:I told you they were freaks. Oh, and...Phoenix:And...?Oldbag:They're kids. Children. Whippersnappers.Phoenix:K-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?Oldbag:It was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.Phoenix:Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge:O-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?Oldbag:Oh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em.Edgeworth:A boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?Judge:Impossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy.Oldbag:Right! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data.Maya:Um, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!Phoenix:Yeah, and they're already trying to \"un-suspect\" him.Judge:This court will take a five-minute recess. (Changed from [I'd like to take a five minute recess.] in the original release) I want the defense and the prosecution to consider this new information... And no forgetting vital information this time!October 18, 11:08 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Phoenix:Mr. WP?Will:Y-yes?Phoenix:Tell me straight: were you really in your dressing room? You didn't go to the studio?Will:I-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest.Maya:So who was the \"Steel Samurai\" in that security photo?Will:How should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really.Maya:What!? You should take better care of that stuff!Will:I couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me?Phoenix:It doesn't look good...Will:*sniff*Phoenix:You're the only likely suspect, right now.Maya:Nick! W-what are we going to do!?Phoenix:First, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this!Maya:Right! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day!Phoenix:Right... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot.Will:You... don't sound very optimistic.Phoenix:I'm not optimistic at all, actually.Maya:Hey, Nick. It's time.Phoenix:Okay. Let's go. *sigh*Will:What does that mean... Please don't sigh like that! *sniff*Judge:Court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. (Changed from [The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?Edgeworth:The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of \"guilty\" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!Judge:Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?Phoenix:The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!Judge:Order! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.Phoenix:(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)Judge:So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?The assistant girlPhoenix:It was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!Judge:So you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?Phoenix:That's correct, Your Honor!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:If you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!Phoenix:Oh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.)Edgeworth:Remember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!Oldbag:Powers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me.Phoenix:What about the assistant?Oldbag:Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.Edgeworth:The assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!Phoenix:Ungh!Maya:That kind of takes the legs out from under that case...Judge:Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.Phoenix:(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)Judge:May we move on, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.Judge:Very well. Go ahead.Leads back to:\"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\"The grade-school boyPhoenix:It was the grade-school boy! ... ... ... Why isn't anyone saying anything?Edgeworth:Bah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? \"Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!\" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved?Phoenix:(Hmm... maybe that was a dumb move on my part.)Maya:\"Maybe\"? \"Maybe\"!? How about \"absolutely,\" Nick!Judge:Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.Phoenix:(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)Judge:May we move on, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.Judge:Very well. Go ahead.Leads back to:\"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\"The security ladyLeads to:\"It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!\"Phoenix:It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!Oldbag:W-who!?Phoenix:The Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!Oldbag:W-what!? Whippersnapper!Judge:Order! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!?Oldbag:Oldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you!Phoenix:Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!Judge:W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?Phoenix:Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!Judge:I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)Judge:Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?Edgeworth:... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.Oldbag:W-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!Phoenix:(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)Press furtherLeads to:\"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\"Give granny a breakPhoenix:(I guess this does kind of make it look like she's the killer. Funny, I feel bad for her all of a sudden.)Judge:Hmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough.Phoenix:(Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.)Leads to:\"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\"Phoenix:The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!Oldbag:B-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?Phoenix:You forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.Judge:Hmm... Indeed.Phoenix:(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)Oldbag:Wait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!Judge:He's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?Oldbag:Th-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!Judge:Hmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:That boy is not the killer.Oldbag:What!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!Phoenix:I have proof.Oldbag:P-proof!?Judge:Indeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?Present CardkeyPhoenix:Phoenix:The scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?Leads to:\"I see!\"Present Powers's(?) Photo or Samurai SpearPhoenix:Phoenix:Your Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible!Leads to:\"I see!\"Present anything elsePhoenix:Phoenix:This is my proof!Judge:... I can't see how that has anything to do with this matter, Mr. Wright? Mr. Wright. There aren't that many pieces of evidence in the Court Record. Please try not to pick the wrong ones!Phoenix:S-sorry, Your Honor.Judge:I'll ask again, Mr. Wright.Leads back to:\"You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?\"Judge:I see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this?Oldbag:Mrph.Phoenix:(The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.)Judge:Very well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name?Edgeworth:Something \"Oldbag,\" Your Honor.Judge:Then the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned!Oldbag:W-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking!Maya:Oh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!Judge:Ms. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony?Oldbag:Actually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about.Phoenix:N-not to talk about?Edgeworth:By whom!?Phoenix:(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)Judge:W-well, testify!Witness Testimony-- My Lips Were Sealed --Oldbag:Global Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.They said they had \"nothing to do with it,\" see?So they told me to just pretend they \"hadn't been at the studios that day.\"But if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!Judge:M-Ms. Oldbag! This is crucial information! Why did you keep this from the court until now!?Oldbag:Ain't you been listening? They told me to shut my trap, and I always do what I'm told.Judge:...Phoenix:(No, this isn't a bad dream, Your Honor. Witness the power of the Oldbag...)Judge:Mr. Wright... Your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- My Lips Were Sealed --Oldbag:Global Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So, you were told not to talk?Oldbag:That's right! By the studio and TV bigwigs, no less!Edgeworth:Why didn't I hear about this!?Oldbag:Don't be too hard on yourself, sonny. We were all in on it.Oldbag:There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:W-who were these people!?Oldbag:Well, the director and the producer, for starters...Phoenix:The... director?Edgeworth:We should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course!Oldbag:Yes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it.Phoenix:So, where were these people?Oldbag:The director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that.Edgeworth:Where!Oldbag:Oh, in the Studio Two trailer.Phoenix:S-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?)Oldbag:Well, if you look at the guidemap... Here it is.

This is a trial for murder!Oldbag:I know that, silly! Still, they were pretty convincing about having nothing to do with it. And... they gave me a little bonus on the side.Phoenix:(So, you got your \"bonus\" and you still talked... Hmm.

I guess pressing her was the right thing to do! For an old windbag, she sure likes keeping secrets... Let's get as much information as we can!Phoenix:Your Honor.

Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers!Judge:Hmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point.

Could it really have been old windbag?Phoenix:What do you think, Mr. Powers?Will:I don't think it was her, really.Maya:Neither do I, Nick.Phoenix:Y-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers.Maya:Poor old windbag... I feel kinda sorry for her.Phoenix:Well, she wasn't winning any points in there, with or without my accusation. Okay, let's get down to the studios.Maya:Right!

I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penaltiesJudge:That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear.

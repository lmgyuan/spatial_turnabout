In order to understand it myself... ...I had to know the story of these last seven long years. Nothing happens by chance... All is connected. And now... ..you stand ready to begin the final chapter of this story. Will the defendant be found guilty, or innocent? The decision is yours.\nOctober 7, 10:37 AMWright Anything Agency\nExamine evidence\nAttorney's Badge\nBack side\nApollo:\nThere's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it.\nTrucy:\nHey, Apollo! Look, on TV! Look! Look!\nApollo:\nYeah... uh, I'm kinda busy.\nTrucy:\nWhoa! Look at that! He's the last Gramarye, alright! Amazing!\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\nApollo, you should be watching this!\nApollo:\nOw ow ow! What? What!? ...I was writing about our last case in my journal.\nTrucy:\nLawyers are supposed to write things in \"records\", Apollo, not journals. And why now? That case was three months ago.\nApollo:\nHey, it's a long story. ...I did a lot, you know. I want to vacuum pack the feel of the moment for later. Right now I'm wowing the crowd by figuring out how Lamiroir disappeared.\nTrucy:\nThat's right! Uncle Valant did that illusion, too! But you're missing him on TV right now!\nApollo:\n*sigh*... I was just getting to the good part. (I suppose I should watch a little TV with her. After all, her father's expecting me to look after her while he's away...)\nAnnouncer:\nWhat you're now seeing is a rehearsal for the greatest magic show on Earth... ...happening right here at our very own Sunshine Coliseum!\nApollo:\nThe Sunshine Coliseum? Hey, that's where the Gavinners concert was!\nAnnouncer:\n...Only three more days until miracles happen here, right before your unbelieving eyes! The legendary Troupe Gramarye is performing for the first time in seven years!\nTrucy:\nThat's going to be great! I'm so there! You and Daddy are coming, too!\nApollo:\n(The legendary Gramaryes... ...If Trucy's real father were still alive... ...he'd be on that stage performing miracles.)\nTrucy:\nI've got the tickets and everything! Here's yours, Apollo.\nMagic Show ticket received.\nExamine evidence\nMagic Show Ticket\nBack side\nTrucy:\nAre you ready, Apollo!?\nApollo:\nReady? For what?\nTrucy:\nFor what!? For the Troupe Gramarye Grand Magic Show!\nApollo:\nI-It's not like I'm getting up on stage or anything...\nTrucy:\n...What are you talking about, Apollo!? You can't enjoy magic if you're not part of what's going on up on stage! I'll lend you my spare costume if you need one.\nApollo:\nHuh? You mean, I can't go in this?\nTrucy:\nNo.\nApollo:\n(...Doesn't get more straightforward than that.)\n...*squeak*...\n???:\nAh, you are here. Working hard or hardly working?\nPhoenix:\nHey! How have you been?\nTrucy:\nHi there, stranger!\nApollo:\n(Not exactly the kind of greeting I'd want to hear from my own kid. Though he has been gone a long time.)\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha, how goes it, Trucy? Here, I got a present for you.\nTrucy:\nYay! Pudding! I love pudding! Ooh, it's farm-fresh! And not just one pudding, but three whole cups! I'll have to pace myself.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'm beat.\nTrucy:\nThat's right, Daddy. You're on a top secret mission! You've got to take it easy with the secrets, you know.\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha. How right you are.\nApollo:\nSo, you still can't tell us what your \"mission\" is?\nPhoenix:\n...... Maybe it is time. It has something to do with you, anyway.\nApollo:\nHuh? With... me?\nTrucy:\nOoh! Maybe you're getting a top secret mission, too! Maybe you can be one of those guys! A spy!\nApollo:\n(Can't I just be a defense attorney...?)\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha! To be honest... ...telling you about the mission was my whole reason for coming here today.\nApollo:\nWhat...?\nPhoenix:\nTell me... ...you've heard of the Jurist System, yes?\nTrucy:\nThe Jurist System...?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. The new legal system everyone's talking about.\nTrucy:\nHave you heard of it, Apollo?\nApollo:\nHuh? Uh... Maybe?\nPhoenix:\n...... Maybe not as many people are talking about it as I thought.\nApollo:\n(The \"Jurist System\", huh?)\nExamine\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nAh, those legal books were left by my mentor. Too bad I gave up the practice before reading them.\nApollo:\nThere's quite a few magic books in there, too, you know.\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha. Those would be Trucy's. She'll remember they're there eventually, I'm sure.\nApollo:\n(For a moment, I thought Mr. Wright might do magic, too... A scary thought.)\nCharley the plant\nPhoenix:\n...The plant. It intrigues you, doesn't it?\nApollo:\nNot really. It's just the only thing in here that doesn't have some secret function.\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha. No, no secrets. But lots of memories. And a name, too. Want to hear it?\nApollo:\nNot really.\nPhoenix:\nHis name... is Charley. If you were curious.\nApollo:\n(Really, I wasn't.)\nHula hoop\nTrucy:\nWant to have a go at that ring, Apollo?\nApollo:\nNo, no, I was just touching it.\nTrucy:\nC'mon, there's no need to be shy! Just slip it on... There!\nApollo:\nYoooooowwwwwwwwch!\nTrucy:\nYou're way too tense! You gotta loosen up, there.\nApollo:\nThe human body wasn't meant to bend like that!\nMagic split box\nApollo:\nI can't believe you're using this cutting-a-person-apart box as... shelf space.\nTrucy:\nYou know, I used that trick on stage the other night. Imagine my surprise when I pulled one of my shirts out of the box!\nApollo:\n...You should really examine your props before the show.\nPhotograph\nApollo:\nThat magician in the photo, is that your...?\nTrucy:\nMy real Daddy, yup! Zak Gramarye! He disappeared when I was little. I hung that up there so I wouldn't forget what he looked like.\nApollo:\n...I see. (She's smiling, but I'll bet that smile doesn't go very deep...)\nPiano\nApollo:\n(No one's practicing the piano, as usual. Even calling him a pianist is an insult to pianists everywhere.)\nTrucy:\nOK, Apollo! I'm going to guess what you're thinking right now!\nApollo:\nHuh? What, was I making a funny face or something?\nTrucy:\n\"Argh! I'm so hungry!\"... I'm right, right? Of course I am.\nApollo:\nThere's no \"of course\" about it! You guessed wrong. ...Besides, that's not what I'm thinking... it's what you're thinking!\nTrucy:\nAck! How did you do that!? You read my mind, Apollo!\nApollo:\nAt least you've got that pudding.\nTrucy:\nThat's right!\nApollo:\n...Try not to eat my share, will you?\nSilk hat\nApollo:\nThat hat... Is that a spare? It looks exactly like the one you always wear.\nTrucy:\nThat's the first rule of a professional: be prepared! You know, I put it on the other day... ...and this strange white substance fell all over me! It was like magic!\nApollo:\nOr... like fingerprint powder.\nSpaghetti\nApollo:\nA plate of plastic spaghetti for displaying in a shop. ...Where the heck does she get this stuff?\nTable\nTrucy:\nOoh, careful there, Apollo. A lot of people run into that table, you know. Why, some client knocked the pot clean over the other day.\nApollo:\n...Um, why not get a more sturdy table?\nTrucy:\nHmm. Maybe the table is partially to blame...\nApollo:\n...There's no \"maybe\" to this. That thing is a deathtrap.\nMove\nPhoenix:\nAhem. I wasn't finished talking to you, you know. Or rather, you weren't finished asking me questions.\nApollo:\n(Why try to fight it? I can't win...)\nTalk\nThe Jurist System\nTrucy:\nSo, Daddy, what's this \"Jurist System\" thing?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Trucy, do you know what a \"jury\" is?\nTrucy:\nI've heard of it. Isn't that those people who sit in court in those old courtroom dramas? The ones who get to decide if a guy's innocent or guilty? Do you know, Apollo?\nApollo:\n...Only from TV. It's twelve people, chosen from the community, right?\nPhoenix:\nWell, they're thinking about reviving that system. They're calling the new system, the \"Jurist System\".\nTrucy:\n\"No more doing whatever you like, Your Honor!\"\nPhoenix:\nNot quite that harsh. The jurists cooperate with the judge. They help analyze the case from different angles.\nApollo:\nAh, and there will be only six of them under the current proposal, right?\nTrucy:\nWow, you know your stuff, Apollo!\nPhoenix:\nTheir findings directly affect the verdict. Hopefully, people will start taking the courts a little more seriously now.\nTrucy:\nI feel like I'm on some kind of educational TV show! Starring Dr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nAh ha. Dr. Wright, his assistant Trucy... ...and mascot Apollo. The perfect team!\nApollo:\n(Mascot...? Hey!)\nThe secret mission\nApollo:\nSo... What is this secret mission?\nPhoenix:\nThe Jurist System is my mission... more or less. Anyway, keep in mind that new ideas like this system are always risky, Apollo.\nTrucy:\nToo true... Everyone's got an opinion, and they just talk and talk and nothing gets decided. Kind of like you, Apollo.\nApollo:\nUh, I'm not that bad. Am I?\nPhoenix:\nIn any case... ...we're going to give it a shot. A test, if you will.\nTrucy:\nI don't like tests.\nPhoenix:\nWe'll take a case as a sample, and choose six jurists. I'll be the one helping with that process, incidentally.\nApollo:\nHelping... how?\nPhoenix:\nWell, for one, I'll be chair of the Jurist System Simulated Court Committee. The chair constructs the ideal situation... choosing the case, the jurist candidates... ...even the judge and the courtroom.\nTrucy:\nWow! It's like you have a real job!\nPhoenix:\n...I was never that good at the piano, to be honest.\nApollo:\n(Once a lawyer, always a lawyer, I guess.)\nPhoenix:\nThe trial's tomorrow, by the way. Don't miss it. The trial simulation that is.\nTrucy:\nA simulation, huh... Sounds interesting.\nValant Gramarye\nTrucy:\nHey, Apollo, I know you're all excited about that secret mission... ...but what about this!? The \"Troupe Gramarye Grand Magic Show\"!\nApollo:\nHuh? Oh, right. The card tricks.\nTrucy:\nThey're not \"card tricks\"! They're grand illusions! Miracles! The apocalypse! Heaven and Earth will shake!\nApollo:\n...So what, that's three whole days from now.\nTrucy:\nIt's at Sunshine Coliseum! Let's go! Let's go today! We can say hi to Uncle Valant!\nApollo:\nHave fun.\nTrucy:\nWhaaaat!? I can't go by myself! You know I'm not very outgoing!\nApollo:\nRiiight!\nPhoenix:\nWhy not go with her?\nApollo:\nBut... what about the \"secret mission\"...?\nPhoenix:\nOh, don't worry about that. You'll hear all about it tomorrow, regardless.\nApollo:\n(I don't trust that smile. He knows something that he's not telling me.)\nTrucy:\nYippee! Now you can take me to the coliseum!\nApollo:\n(*sigh* I suppose it wouldn't kill me to pop over there.)\nPhoenix:\nAh, \"Gramarye\", that reminds me...\nTrucy:\n...What's this, Daddy? Isn't that silk hat the Gramarye seal?\nPhoenix:\nConsider it a birthday present, Trucy.\nTrucy:\nThanks! It's great! But... ...today isn't my birthday.\nPhoenix:\n...Hmm. Good point. ...What day is it today, Apollo?\nApollo:\nHuh? Today? Um... I think it's \"Recycle Your Plastics\" day...\nPhoenix:\nThen, it's a Recycle-Your-Plastics present.\nTrucy:\nYippee! So it's plastic!\nApollo:\n(I've given up trying to understand them. It's much easier that way.) ...So what is it?\nTrucy:\nCan I open it, Daddy?\nPhoenix:\n...No.\nTrucy:\nHuh!?\nPhoenix:\nYou'll need that envelope someday. Someday soon. Don't open it until then.\nTrucy:\n...... Well, why didn't you just hold on to it until then?\nApollo:\n(...Because that would be the logical thing to do.)\nGramarye Envelope obtained.\nApollo:\nAn envelope about the Gramaryes, huh? Hmm...\nValant Gramarye (subsequent times)\nTrucy:\nHey, Apollo, I know you're all excited about that secret mission... ...but what about this!? The \"Troupe Gramarye Grand Magic Show\"!\nApollo:\nHuh? Oh, right. The card tricks.\nTrucy:\nThey're not \"card tricks\"! They're grand illusions! Miracles! The apocalypse! Heaven and Earth will shake!\nApollo:\n...So what, that's three whole days from now.\nTrucy:\nIt's at Sunshine Coliseum! Let's go! Let's go today! We can say hi to Uncle Valant!\nApollo:\nHave fun.\nTrucy:\nWhaaaat!? I can't go by myself! You know I'm not very outgoing!\nApollo:\nRiiight!\nPhoenix:\nWhy not go with her?\nApollo:\nBut... what about the \"secret mission\"...?\nPhoenix:\nOh, don't worry about that. You'll hear all about it tomorrow, regardless.\nApollo:\n(I don't trust that smile. He knows something that he's not telling me.)\nTrucy:\nYippee! Now you can take me to the coliseum!\nApollo:\n(*sigh* I suppose it wouldn't kill me to pop over there.)\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nAh, \"presenting\", are we? I did my fair share of that back in the day. Showed my attorney's badge a lot, too.\nTrucy:\nHe may look cool and calm now, but you should have seen him before!\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha. You know me too well, Trucy.\nApollo:\n(I'm glad I provided this opportunity for a little family bonding.)\nExamine evidence\nGramarye Envelope\nSignature\nApollo:\nAh, lookey here. A handwritten signature. It says... I can't read it.\nTrucy:\nThat seems odd to me. I mean, isn't a signature intended to show ownership? What's the use if no one can read it?\nApollo:\nIsn't enough if you can read your own? <!- potential typo? -->\nTrucy:\n...Oh! I never thought of it that way!\nAfter clearing \"The Jurist System\" and \"The secret mission\" Talk options:\nApollo:\nSo... what kind of case is the trial simulation about?\nPhoenix:\nWell, since it is the first run through of a new system, I wanted something simple.\nTrucy:\nGood thinking! No sense wearing yourself out on something too serious!\nPhoenix:\nTrue. The case is a murder.\nApollo:\nThat's not simple at all!!\nTrucy:\nBy \"simple\", did you mean that the defendant is...\nPhoenix:\n...Guilty. Yes. Most likely. ...So, good luck, Apollo.\nApollo:\nUm... with what?\nPhoenix:\nWith the trial tomorrow. You're defending, of course. Recall that I said it had something to do with you.\nTrucy:\nGo for it, Apollo! It's just a test case, anyway. No sweat!\nApollo:\nYeah, but there's still a verdict to be decided.\nPhoenix:\n...And a potentially serious sentence. The most serious, in a worst-case scenario.\nApollo:\nAck! You mean... the verdict's for real!? That's not a \"test\" trial! That's a... real trial!\nPhoenix:\nAll the forms have been filed. There's no turning back now. The trial begins tomorrow at 10 AM. Hope you can make room in your schedule.\nApollo:\nWh-Why am I only hearing about this now!?\nPhoenix:\n...Ah, yes. There was a change this morning. ...I picked a new case.\nApollo:\nEh...?\nPhoenix:\n...Something that happened last night.\nTalk\nThe trial simulation\nApollo:\nAlright, so what case are you going to use?\nPhoenix:\nYou really want to know don't you?\nApollo:\nOf course I do! I mean... I'm going to be defending, aren't I?\nPhoenix:\nIf all goes well, then yes. Of course, this is just a test. We wanted everyone to start without preconceptions. A blank slate, as it were.\nApollo:\nThere's a difference between having a blank slate and just being totally clueless. Whose dumb idea was that anyway? (Changed from [Who's [sic] dumb idea was that anyway?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWell mine. Committee chair, remember?\nApollo:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nWell, if you want to know that badly, I suppose... ...I could give you permission to examine the scene of the crime.\nApollo:\nGood! That's better.\nPhoenix:\n...But you can't talk to anyone involved with the case.\nApollo:\nWhat!? Then how am I supposed to defend...?\nPhoenix:\nYou let me worry about the details, there. Remember... I'm in charge of this trial. All of it.\nApollo:\nBut you don't want it to backfire, do you?\nPhoenix:\nApollo... ...if I am in charge of the whole trial... ...that means the entire affair is my responsibility. For good, or for bad.\nApollo:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nJust do what you can. And don't worry. I know what I'm doing.\nApollo:\nA... Alright.\nPhoenix:\nI'd recommend going down to the detention center. Your client's waiting for you. You can ask about the scene there.\nApollo:\nBut you just said I couldn't talk to anyone involved...\nPhoenix:\n...Oh, you can talk to your client. If... you can get her to talk.\nTrucy:\nWell, time's a wasting!\nThe trial simulation (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nAlright, so what case are you going to use?\nPhoenix:\nYou really want to know don't you?\nApollo:\nOf course I do! I mean... I'm going to be defending, aren't I?\nPhoenix:\nIf all goes well, then yes. Of course, this is just a test. We wanted everyone to start without preconceptions. A blank slate, as it were.\nApollo:\nThere's a difference between having a blank slate and just being totally clueless. Whose dumb idea was that anyway? (Changed from [Who's [sic] dumb idea was that anyway?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nWell mine. Committee chair, remember?\nApollo:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nWell, if you want to know that badly, I suppose... ...I could give you permission to examine the scene of the crime.\nApollo:\nGood! That's better.\nPhoenix:\n...But you can't talk to anyone involved with the case.\nApollo:\nWhat!? Then how am I supposed to defend...?\nPhoenix:\nYou let me worry about the details, there. Remember... I'm in charge of this trial. All of it.\nApollo:\nBut you don't want it to backfire, do you?\nPhoenix:\nApollo... ...if I am in charge of the whole trial... ...that means the entire affair is my responsibility. For good, or for bad.\nApollo:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nJust do what you can. And don't worry. I know what I'm doing.\nApollo:\nA... Alright.\nAfter clearing \"The trial simulation\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency:\nOctober 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\nThat's 20 minutes we've been waiting here! 20 minutes!\nTrucy:\nMaybe I should complain? I'm sure that guard has better things to do than stand there pretending he doesn't see us.\nApollo:\nYou know the minute we get angry, the client will show. It always works that way.\nTrucy:\nLike shouting, \"Oh, waiter!\" and they're standing right behind you? Oh, guaaaaard! Is our client going to be much longer?\nGuard:\nWhat are you talking about!? Haven't you already started the meeting, yet!?\nTrucy:\n...Huh? Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\nWh-Wh-Where'd you come from!?\n???:\n......\nApollo:\nW-W-W-Well... ...Anyway! Please have a seat!\n???:\n......\nTrucy:\n...... I'm nervous, Apollo.\nApollo:\nIt's the silence. It builds suspense. Why don't you do something, Trucy? You're a magician, aren't you?\nTrucy:\nTh-That's right. OK...\nMr. Hat:\nI'm the Amazing Mr. Hat!\n???:\n......\n...*thud*...\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeek! She passed out!\nApollo:\nHmm. Ms. Magic Underwear might have been a better bet.\nTrucy:\nThat's \"Magic Panties\", Apollo!\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nApollo:\nThe security camera stares down from the ceiling, all-seeing, unblinking. Not that I'm nervous or anything.\nSecurity guard\nApollo:\nThe same old security guard is glaring at us. ...He winked. Maybe he's not such a bad guy after all.\nTalk\nIntroductions\nApollo:\nUm. Uh. Hi! Well, I'm your defense... ...I really think it has to be fate, you know!\n???:\n......\nApollo:\nAnd by fate, I mean destiny! Did you know I'm good with astrology? Tell me, what's your sign?\n???:\n......\nTrucy:\n...I can tell you mine, if you'd like, Apollo?\nApollo:\n...No, never mind. I just got carried away there. (I seem destined to get difficult clients, it seems.)\nYour name?\nApollo:\nUm... So, what's your name?\n???:\n......\nApollo:\nOh, right, I'm supposed to introduce myself first! I'm Apollo! Apollo Justice!\n???:\n......\nTrucy:\nAnd I'm Trucy Wright.\nApollo:\n...I know. (This is getting nowhere fast.)\nThe case\nApollo:\nHey, I know! Maybe you can tell us what happened? I'm your defense attorney, after all!\n???:\n......\nApollo:\nUm, anything out of the ordinary happen lately?\n???:\n......\nTrucy:\nWell, the other day this tourist from out of town stopped to ask me directions.\nApollo:\n...Later, Trucy. (I feel like I need to ask directions myself here...)\nPresent\nAnything\nApollo:\nUm, see this here?\n???:\n......\nApollo:\nUm, does it ring any bells?\n???:\n......\nApollo:\n(Does anything I say ring anything?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nApollo:\n(Well, that was fruitless. Though I think I understand despair a little better now.)\nTrucy:\nYou did good, Apollo!\n???:\n......\nTrucy:\nL-Look! She's doing her nails!\nApollo:\nWhat? Are nails more important than defense? Is that it!? ...Let's go, Trucy.\n???:\n...Excuse me...\nApollo:\n...!\n???:\nC-Could you... Could you read this?\nApollo:\nUm, sure. (I feel like a teenager on a first date! And this is the love letter we passed from desk to desk at school...)\nTrucy:\nStop looking so wistful and read it, Apollo!\nApollo:\nIt... It's a business card. With a name and an address. The name is... Vera Misham? The address is for \"Drew Studio\".\nVera's Card added to the Court Record.\nExamine evidence\nVera's Card\nBack side\nTrucy:\nWhat a pretty business card. Looks like a postcard, almost.\nApollo:\nAnd on the back... Hmm. Just her name.\nTrucy:\nThat seems odd to me.\nApollo:\nHuh? What does?\nTrucy:\nWhy write your name on the front and back of the card? Why not use the space on the back for a self-portrait! Or a caricature! Then people would remember what you look like, too.\nApollo:\nThat's not a bad idea, actually.\nTrucy:\nHere, give me one of your cards, Apollo...\nApollo:\n(...She's drawing something. Hey! My hair's not THAT spiky!)\nApollo:\nAnd you're giving me this card because...?\nVera:\n......\nApollo:\n...... Well, looks like we're finished here.\nTrucy:\nI wonder if Drew Studio is the scene of the crime?\nApollo:\nLet's go find out.\nOctober 7Drew Studio\nApollo:\nWow, this looks like... it looks like a studio.\nTrucy:\nIt's like life imitating art... Or, maybe, it's the other way around... Hmm. But the tape on the ground there... It's a bit jarring...\nApollo:\nYeah... Looks like we found our crime scene...\nTrucy:\nApollo! Look at all those paintings!\nApollo:\nHey, don't touch those.\nTrucy:\nIt's OK, I'm just looking. Huh? Apollo... Look at this one.\nApollo:\n...Looks half finished. (You can still see the rough sketch underneath.)\nTrucy:\nBut, that's odd. The rough part doesn't look like the rest of the painting at all.\nApollo:\nYeah, good point. (That is odd...)\nDrew Misham's Paintings added to the Court Record.\nExamine evidence\nPortrait\nThinking person\nApollo:\nWell, what do we have here...? It looks like a person... thinking about something.\nTrucy:\nMaybe they're worried? Like, what should I have for supper: a hot dog, or a hamburger? ...... You know, I've always wondered about that. Why is there \"supper\" and \"dinner\"? Are they different meals or the same thing?\nApollo:\n...Maybe that's what this person's thinking about.\nAcrylic\nPorcupinefish\nApollo:\nIs that... a pufferfish?\nTrucy:\nApollo! That's clearly a porcupinefish!\nApollo:\n...They're not the same thing?\nTrucy:\nYou know what gets me? They're got all these needles, right? But what's protecting that soft spot on the lower belly there? Nothing!\nApollo:\n(...Must remember to keep Trucy away from small, round fish.)\nLandscape\nRough sketch\nTrucy:\nApollo, look at this painting. You can see the rough sketch!\nApollo:\nOh. Looks like it was only half-completed.\nTrucy:\nHuh? That's funny. Do the rough sketch and the finished painting look totally different to you, too?\nApollo:\n...They do, actually! (What's that all about...?)\nTrucy:\n...All the paintings have a really different style, too.\n???:\nAh! I thought I might find you two here.\nTrucy:\nEma! Long time no see!\nEma:\nOh? Seems like I run into you far too often. I'll bet I know why you're here, too.\nApollo:\nYou know about the trial simulation tomorrow?\nEma:\nI've heard about it, sure. So Mr. Wright chose you, huh?\nApollo:\nWe don't even know what the case is about.\nEma:\nWell, he was killed. The artist who owns this studio, that is. Mr. Drew Misham.\nTrucy:\nMisham...\nEma:\nAnd his daughter was put under arrest.\nApollo:\nYeah... We just saw her at the detention center.\nTrucy:\nIt was funny, though. She seemed more like a victim than the kind of person who could commit murder.\nEma:\nYou don't say. Not even by poisoning? That's how it was done, you know. Poisoning's a common way to get the job done, when the murderer is a woman.\nTrucy:\nP-Poisoning...?\nEma:\nAnyway, Mr. Wright told me you'd be coming. Feel free to take a look around. I'll just be over here. With my Snackoos.\nApollo:\n(We can't talk to anyone related to the case this time around... ...Which means we'd better find out as much as we can here at the scene. ...Or else.)\nExamine\nCoffee mug\nEma:\nAh, that's the victim's coffee mug.\nTrucy:\nAh ha! So the poison was in here! This is my first time seeing a real poisoned mug of coffee!\nApollo:\nI would hope so.\nEma:\n...... \"Poisoned Coffee\"...? Not exactly, actually.\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean?\nEma:\nNo traces of poison were found in the coffee.\nTrucy:\nWhat!?\nEma:\n...You'll have to figure out the rest yourself. I'm officially not on your side, after all.\nCoffee Mug added to the Court Record.\nCoffee mug (subsequent times)\nEma:\nThat coffee mug... it's not what you'd expect. No traces of poison were found in the coffee.\nApollo:\nHuh? Whaaaat?\nEma:\nYet the only thing the victim drank that night was this coffee... ...so the poison definitely reached him through this mug.\nTrucy:\n...... I like you better when you tell us stuff.\nEma:\nLook... Just figure it out yourselves, OK? I have my \"position\" here to consider.\nFloor outline\nTrucy:\nEek, Apollo! Th-That's where the body was!\nEma:\nThat's the spot where Mr. Drew Misham passed away. He put the coffee mug to his lips, and the next moment...\nApollo:\nThere's quite a bit of paint on the ground.\nEma:\nSee that half-painted painting there? He must have been working on that right up to the moment he died.\nTrucy:\nWow! A true artist to the end!\nEma:\nOr maybe he started it a year ago and was procrastinating.\nPainting behind dresser\nTrucy:\nHey... There's a painting hidden back here!\nApollo:\n...Hey, you're right!\nTrucy:\nWhat if it's embarrassing somehow, and he didn't want anyone to see it!?\nApollo:\nYou certainly seem pleased by the possibility.\nTrucy:\nHuh. It's so... normal!\nApollo:\nThat's hardly something to get mad about... ......\nTrucy:\nHuh? What is it, Apollo?\nApollo:\nWell, doesn't this painting look like... never mind.\nTrucy:\n...?\nApollo:\n(I'd better get a professional opinion on this...)\nHidden Painting added to the Court Record.\nPainting behind dresser (subsequent times)\nTrucy:\nHuh? What is it, Apollo?\nApollo:\nWell, doesn't this painting look like... never mind.\nTrucy:\n...?\nApollo:\n(I'd better get a professional opinion on this...)\nLetterbox\nTrucy:\nThat letter box looks funny sitting inside a room like this.\nApollo:\nLet's take a look... Empty.\nEma:\nThe other half of that letter box is actually connected to the outside of the studio. Mr. Misham would put his letters in there... ...and the postman took them away.\nTrucy:\nImpressive that someone still writes letters in this day and age. Or wrote, rather.\nPaintings\nTrucy:\nI wouldn't mind taking a closer look at those paintings. I just love oils! You know, how they're so thick? Is that the word?\nApollo:\n...These paints are all dry. I'm just surprised at how different these all are.\nTrucy:\nYeah... And what's going on with this half-finished one?\nApollo:\nIt must have been a work in progress. You can still see the rough sketch below...\nTrucy:\n...That's what's so weird. The sketched part doesn't really fit the finished parts.\nApollo:\nI noticed. (That is weird...)\nPaintings (subsequent times, before presenting Hidden Painting)\nTrucy:\nLet's take a closer look.\nApollo:\nThis painting here looks like a work in progress.\nTrucy:\nBut... the rough sketch part doesn't fit the other parts.\nApollo:\nI know. (Very peculiar...)\nPaintings (after presenting Hidden Painting)\nTrucy:\nLet's take a closer look! Why are two of the paintings identical?\nApollo:\nIt certainly is a bit curious. (...And a whole lot of suspicious.)\nPaintings (after presenting Hidden Painting; after Red Envelope is updated in the Court Record)\nTrucy:\nLet's take a closer look. Mr. Misham sure worked on a lot of different paintings. You think his works really go for a 100 grand a piece? Maybe I should take up painting.\nApollo:\n(I don't think his paintings are worth THAT much. Something's not right here.)\nWhite teacup\nEma:\nI imagine this coffee cup was for guests to use.\nTrucy:\n...Guests?\nApollo:\nDid the police already analyze this cup, too?\nEma:\nNot a trace of poison was found on that cup.\nApollo:\n(So the killer was after Drew Misham alone.)\nDrafting table\nTrucy:\nIs this desk for painting, Apollo?\nEma:\nThat would be a drafting table.\nTrucy:\n...Drafting?\nEma:\nBasically, it's a tool for making precise diagrams.\nTrucy:\n...Wow, painting is harder than I thought.\nApollo:\n(Why would a painter need a drafting table? Was he an architect, too?)\nEquipment\nTrucy:\nWhat is all this equipment here for? It doesn't look very artistic, really.\nEma:\nHe had everything from a lathe to a laser cutter. Looks like he was ready to work on metals and wood, too. ...Though his equipment's a bit old, to tell the truth.\nApollo:\nWhy would a painter need all this?\nEma:\nFrom the dust, I'd say he hasn't used this stuff for years.\nApollo:\n(This corner doesn't fit with the rest of the studio.)\nTrucy:\nOh, do you think I could borrow this? I want to cut a quarter in half to make a trick coin!\nApollo:\n...This is a crime scene, Trucy.\nTrucy:\nBut these cost like 50 bucks at the magic shop!\nDesk\nApollo:\nLet's take a closer look at this desk here.\nDesk drawer\nApollo:\nThis envelope has been opened and resealed.\nTrucy:\nOoh! I know how to do that! You take a pot of boiling water, and hold the envelope up to the steam. The glue melts and it opens! Cool, huh?\nApollo:\nWhoever did this wasn't so delicate.\nTrucy:\nYou're right. Looks like they just ripped it open and stuck it back together. ...Huh? The postmark on this letter is from seven years ago!\nApollo:\n(Why would someone open a letter, then seal it again? Hmm... I'd better hang on to this.)\nRed Envelope added to the Court Record.\nDesk drawer (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nThis envelope has been opened and resealed.\nTrucy:\nYou're right. Looks like they just ripped it open and stuck it back together.\nApollo:\nVery strange... (Why would someone open a letter, then seal it again? Hmm... I'd better hang on to this.)\nFeather\nTrucy:\nHey, Apollo, what's this feather-thingy?\nApollo:\nIsn't that a pen? Like an old-fashioned quill pen?\nTrucy:\nBut it doesn't have a pointy end.\nEma:\nThat was most likely for sweeping detritus off the desk.\nTrucy:\nWow, you sure know a lot, Ema.\nEma:\nBold and scientific, that's my motto.\nApollo:\n(...Exactly what about that was \"bold\" or \"scientific\"?)\nFigurine\nApollo:\nHmm. Something about the way that figure is posed...\nTrucy:\n...I've seen that pose before! It's you, Apollo! See, you're making one of your flamboyant gestures!\nApollo:\nPlease, I am a professional. (...I wonder why it's posed like that? Coincidence?)\nJournal\nApollo:\nIs this... a journal?\nTrucy:\nWow, talk about a clue! Let's read it!\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\nWh-What is it, Apollo!? He didn't write the name of the killer, did he!?\nApollo:\n...It's new. He didn't write a single line.\nTrucy:\nArgh! You had me going for a while there.\nPhotograph\nApollo:\nSo this is Drew Misham?\nTrucy:\nAnd this little girl must be Vera!\nEma:\nYes, they took that some years ago. They look close. A happy little family.\nApollo:\nUntil you arrested his daughter.\nEma:\n...Ack! Look, I was personally against that, OK? She just didn't seem very suspicious. Scientifically speaking.\nApollo:\nUh huh. Right.\nSmaller frame\nTrucy:\nOoh! Cute! Look at the tiny frame, Apollo!\nApollo:\nTiny is right. That thing's barely two inches high. What picture would fit in that?\nTrucy:\nNone, apparently. It's empty.\nApollo:\n(There's no glass in it, either. What's it doing sitting on the desk?)\nTrucy:\nThis is a lesson for us all: be sure to check the size when you buy frames!\nSmaller frame (after Tiny Frame is added to the Court Record)\nApollo:\nI wonder why there's poison on this tiny frame.\nTrucy:\nVery strange indeed. Wait, I know! I'll bet it was poisoned from the time he bought it! Haven't you heard about some kinds of green paint being toxic?\nApollo:\nI don't think they sell that kind anymore. And the poison was atroquinine, anyway. (A tiny, mysterious, poisoned frame...)\nPaint shelf\nTrucy:\nLook at all these paints, Apollo! There's so many! He's got like... twenty kinds of red! We could repaint your suit, Apollo! How about this shade of... green!?\nApollo:\nThat'll be enough of that, thanks.\nTalk\nThe victim\nTrucy:\nSo, this, um, Drew Misham was some kind of artist?\nEma:\nApparently. Did a lot of illustrations for books, I hear. Had a lot of female fans, too, for what it's worth.\nTrucy:\nOh? Well, I guess his stuff is kinda pretty. Like that oil painting over there, for instance.\nEma:\nUm... yeah. That... wasn't one of his illustrations, actually.\nApollo:\n(Huh? So it was a standalone painting or something? Is that what she means?)\nEma:\nHe was an odd bird, Misham. Hadn't shown his face to anyone until the end.\nTrucy:\nWhat do you mean, \"to anyone\"?\nEma:\nHe was always locked up here in this studio, apparently. His only connection to the outside world... ...was through letters he'd put in that letter box there.\nApollo:\nLetters? Do people still write letters?\nTrucy:\nWhat do you mean, Apollo?\nApollo:\nI mean, when was the last time you wrote a real letter? Don't most people use e-mail and stuff these days?\nEma:\nNot Mr. Misham. Couldn't stand technology, it seems. He did everything by mail.\nTrucy:\nMaybe he thought that way was more artistic, you know?\nLetter Box added to the Court Record.\nEma:\nIn any case, the only person besides him allowed in here... ...was his daughter, Vera.\nTrucy:\nOh, you mean the killer?\nApollo:\n...The \"suspect\", please.\nEma:\nWe took some fingerprints, of course. The only ones found in the room were Mr. Misham's and Vera's, basically.\nTrucy:\n\"Basically\"...?\nEma:\nActually, last night... ...Mr. Misham gave an interview to a reporter for the first time. It happened during the interview, apparently.\nEma:\nHis first interview ever...?\nApollo:\nCould you tell us a bit more about what happened the night of the murder?\nThe victim (subsequent times)\nTrucy:\nSo, this, um, Drew Misham was some kind of artist?\nEma:\nApparently. Did a lot of illustrations for books, I hear. Had a lot of female fans, too, for what it's worth.\nTrucy:\nOh? Well, I guess his stuff is kinda pretty.

It happened during the interview, apparently.\nEma:\nHis first interview ever...?\nApollo:\nCould you tell us a bit more about what happened the night of the murder?\nThe defendant\nApollo:\nSo, this woman, Vera... She's Mr. Misham's daughter, right?\nEma:\nYep. A real sickly girl, ever since she was little. Hardly ever went outside.\nTrucy:\nShe did kind of give off a withdrawn sort of aura...\nEma:\nShe was home-schooled by her father, apparently. It was quite a scene when they took her to the detention center. She was screaming about how she'd die \"if they took her outside\".\nApollo:\nThat... does sound like a scene.\nEma:\nIn the end, she agreed to leave if she was allowed her \"good luck charm\" for company.\nTrucy:\nHer \"good luck charm\"...?\nEma:\nApparently, she has this charm that magically gives her the courage to go outside.\nApollo:\n(...Why can't I ever get a normal client?)\nTrucy:\nBut why would a shut-in daughter kill her own dad?\nEma:\nDon't look at me.\nApollo:\nSo, about the poison... It was found to be in his coffee, right...?\nEma:\nNo... Not precisely.\nTrucy:\nNot precisely? What does that mean?\nApollo:\n(It means \"see for yourself\", I think.)\nThe night of the crime (appears after \"The victim\"; before adding Tiny Frame to the Court Record and updating Red Envelope in the Court Record)\nEma:\nLike I said. Last night was the first time someone from the \"outside\" came into this studio. I guess mysterious painters who never go outside make for good articles.\nApollo:\nAnd it just so happened that he died the night of his first interview...?\nEma:\n...At around 9:00 PM every night... ...Vera always made him a cup of coffee. Last night, he drank his usual coffee, and suddenly became violently ill...\nTrucy:\n...And died? She poisoned him on the night of his interview!? Wouldn't the reporter see?\nEma:\nHe wasn't near Mr. Misham when she brought her father his coffee. He was checking out some equipment in the back of the room. ...Supposedly, that's why she didn't notice he was there. It was the reporter who called the police, in fact.\nApollo:\nWait, but why is she the suspect? If anyone is suspicious, it's the reporter!\nEma:\nYet the reporter never got near Mr. Misham's coffee. Even Vera acknowledges that.\nApollo:\n(Regardless, I want to know more about this \"reporter\".)\nThe night of the crime (appears after \"The victim\"; after adding Tiny Frame to the Court Record and updating Red Envelope in the Court Record)\nEma:\nLike I said.

Even Vera acknowledges that.\nApollo:\n(Regardless, I want to know more about this \"reporter\".) So, about this reporter...\nEma:\nI can't tell you much. I hear he's going to be a witness tomorrow, though.\nLeads to:\n\"I thought so.\"\nForensic science (appears after presenting Red Envelope or examining lip mark on Coffee Mug or seal on Red Envelope)\nApollo:\n(I bet Ema could help us out here...)\nTrucy:\nDon't forget, flattery will get you everywhere with her, Apollo!\nEma:\nHuh? What are you two whispering about?\nApollo:\nWell... I was thinking. I mean, what is it we always do when we run into you at a crime scene? What is it we always do... scientifically?\nEma:\nAh, you know me too well! OK...\nApollo:\nOK... meaning we can get erm, scientific now?\nEma:\nOh, I suppose. Just this once! Bring me anything you find suspicious and we'll check it out.\nForensic science (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nI was hoping we could do a little forensics works...\nEmma:\n...I suppose. If we must. Just this once!\nPresent\nPortrait, Acrylic, or Landscape\nApollo:\nEma, about this painting...\nEma:\nOh, that? Quite good, isn't it.\nApollo:\nEr, that's not what I wanted to ask you about.\nEma:\nYou want to examine it, is that it? I'd be happy to let you, if you had a good reason. But without that... sorry.\nApollo:\n(...I guess she wants us to do a little footwork on our own first.)\nHidden Painting\nApollo:\nOh, Ema, I was wondering about this painting here...\nEma:\nAh. Aaah. That one? What about it?\nApollo:\n\"What about it\"!?\nTrucy:\nYeah, what about it, Apollo?\nApollo:\nTake a closer look at it, both of you. Now... look at this one. This is the third painting he was working on.\nTrucy:\nHey. They're the same!\nEma:\n...I was hoping you wouldn't find that. You're right, though. Drew Misham was copying this painting.\nTrucy:\nWow. It's pretty good!\nApollo:\n(Copying a painting...? What for?)\nCoffee Mug\nApollo:\nSo, Ema, about this coffee mug...\nEma:\nI hope you aren't trying to grill me for information. You know I'm not talking.\nApollo:\n...I suppose you are the detective here.\nEma:\nWhy don't you two take a look yourselves? If you find a clue, I might not be unwilling to lend a hand.\nTrucy:\n...I think she's going to help us, Apollo.\nApollo:\nLet's check out this mug, shall we?\nCoffee Mug (after examining lip mark)\nApollo:\nUm, Ema, about this mug... ...there's a pale blue, uh, \"residue\" on the rim.\nEma:\nEh? Ah! Th-That! Yes, well, it's just a rumor... ...but I've heard there's a kind of coffee called \"Blue Mountain\"!\nApollo:\nI'm pretty sure it isn't actually blue, Ema.\nEma:\nAh. Right. OK, you got me. That's left over from my testing spray.\nTrucy:\nForensic science! I knew your hobby was behind this somehow, Ema!\nEma:\nIt's not a \"hobby\"!\nTrucy:\nSo, what kind of scientific stuff were you up to?\nEma:\nThis spray, that's what. It turns blue when it touches poison.\nApollo:\nSo, the poison that killed the victim was on this mug?\nEma:\nThat's right. See? It wasn't in the coffee. The killer applied it to the rim of the mug itself!\nTrucy:\nWow! Science is amazing!\nApollo:\n(It certainly is helpful... Maybe Ema'd be willing to help us out a bit more...)\nTrucy:\nYou should try buttering her up, Apollo. They say flattery will get you everywhere.\nApollo:\n(It's certainly worth talking to her a bit more.)\nCoffee Mug (after examining lip mark and clearing \"Forensic science\" Talk option)\nApollo:\nUm, Ema, about this mug... ...there's a pale blue, uh, \"residue\" on the rim.\nEma:\nEh? Ah! Th-That! Yes, well, it's just a rumor... ...but I've heard there's a kind of coffee called \"Blue Mountain\"!\nApollo:\nI'm pretty sure it isn't actually blue, Ema.\nEma:\nAh. Right. OK, you got me. That's left over from my testing spray.\nTrucy:\nForensic science!

Maybe Ema'd be willing to help us out a bit more...)\nTrucy:\nYou should try buttering her up, Apollo. They say flattery will get you everywhere.\nApollo:\n(It's certainly worth talking to her a bit more.) Um, about poison analysis...\nEma:\n...I was afraid you were going to ask about that. See, this solution is used to test for atroquinine.\nTrucy:\nAtro... huh?\nEma:\nAtroquinine! The deadly poison found in the autopsy!\nApollo:\n(...Uh oh, I know that spark in her eyes. She's getting excited. Best tread lightly.)\nEma:\nIt's one of the most virulent poisons, but is absorbed into the body astonishingly slowly. It takes at least 15 minutes from the time of ingestion for adverse effects to show. Oh, and guess what!? Recent research has shown...\nApollo:\nTh-That's fine, really. We don't need to know all the gory details.\nTrucy:\nI think I get it. You just spray this stuff on something you want to test, right?\nEma:\nPrecisely! You can find even the slightest trace of poison with this!\nTrucy:\nI wanna try, too, Ema! Pretty please?\nEma:\nYou don't have to ask twice! ...I already used it on everything suspicious, of course.\nTrucy:\nYay! Let's give it a whirl, Apollo!\nApollo:\nAaaaugh! What are you doing!?\nTrucy:\nI was just seeing if I got a reaction off of you.\nApollo:\nHow's this for a reaction: Never do that again! I'm not poisonous!\nTrucy:\nTell that to those hapless witnesses on the stand!\nApollo:\n(Let's just get down to checking for real poisons, shall we?)\nGo back\nLeads to:\n\"Too bad. No reaction there.\"\nTrucy:\nToo bad. No reaction there.\nApollo:\nI'm sure Ema checked out all the likely spots. ...Wait a second.\nTrucy:\nWhat is it, Apollo?\nApollo:\nDid you spray that little desk over there?\nTrucy:\nI don't think so... The spray probably can't reach that far, you know?\nApollo:\nLet's check it out, just to be sure.\nSpray smaller frame\nLeads to:\n\"Eeeeeeeeeeeek! A reaction, Apollo!\"\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeeek! A reaction, Apollo!\nEma:\nAaaaaaugh! Where, where!?\nTrucy:\nThe inside of that cute little frame! Look!\nEma:\nWell, would you look at that. Nice going, Trucy.\nTrucy:\nI'm known to work magic!\nApollo:\n(Never mind that I was the one who found it.)\nTiny Frame added to the Court Record.\nApollo:\n(Why would the inside of that frame have poison on it? ...It looks like we found the only other place that was poisoned, in any case.)\nCoffee Mug (after Tiny Frame is added to the Court Record)\nTrucy:\nAre we going to test for poison again?\nApollo:\nWhy not? Just to be sure.\nEma:\nBut, you found your clue already. Isn't that enough? This stuff isn't cheap, you know?\nTrucy:\nI bet she doesn't have a lot of spending money.\nApollo:\n(I bet she spends it all on Snackoos.)\nRed Envelope\nApollo:\nEma, about this...\nEma:\nOh! Th-That! Y-Yes, why that's a bright red envelope.\nApollo:\n(She sure is jumpy...)\nTrucy:\nSomeone opened this, didn't they?\nEma:\n...... My lips are sealed.\nApollo:\nY-Your \"lips are sealed\"...? (That's a first!) You mean... you know what's inside the envelope?\nEma:\nSure. I read it, after all.\nTrucy:\nAh! You mean you were the one who ripped this open!?\nEma:\nHah! Please! I would have steamed it open.\nApollo:\n(But she did sneak a peek at it, apparently.)\nEma:\nKnow that I have a powerful weapon on my side.\nTrucy:\nWeapon...?\nEma:\nYes! The use of tools! Highly specialized tools for information gathering.\nApollo:\n(Tools I wouldn't mind getting my hands on...)\nTrucy:\nYou should try flattering her, Apollo... They say a little praise can open big doors.\nApollo:\n(Never heard that one, but it's good advice... Let's try talking to her some more.)\nRed Envelope (after clearing \"Forensic science\" Talk option)\nApollo:\nEma, about this...\nEma:\nOh! Th-That! Y-Yes, why that's a bright red envelope.\nApollo:\n(She sure is jumpy...)\nTrucy:\nSomeone opened this, didn't they?\nEma:\n...... My lips are sealed.\nApollo:\nY-Your \"lips are sealed\"...? (That's a first!) You mean... you know what's inside the envelope?\nEma:\nSure. I read it, after all.\nTrucy:\nAh! You mean you were the one who ripped this open!?\nEma:\nHah! Please!

They say a little praise can open big doors.\nApollo:\n(Never heard that one, but it's good advice... Let's try talking to her some more.) About that envelope we found... ...I was wondering if you could help us out with that \"tool\" you were mentioning?\nEma:\nEh heh heh, you want to know about my tool do you? It's called an X-Ray Analyzer.\nTrucy:\nX-Ray... like the x-rays you get at the dentist?\nEma:\nThat's right! At least, that's what I call it.\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nEma:\nIt has a real name, but it's much more complicated: the X-Ray Spectraliziation... ...something. How am I supposed to remember all that?\nTrucy:\nSo, basically, it lets you see inside things... like envelopes?\nEma:\nThat's right! You're sharp, Trucy. But it's a bit more complicated than that, in practice, of course. Actually, to tell the truth, I'm not really sure how it works, scientifically.\nTrucy:\nCan I try it out, Ema? Please!?\nEma:\nOh, I suppose. ...Of course, I've already checked out everything suspicious myself.\nTrucy:\nAlright! Let's give it a spin, Apollo!\nApollo:\nYeeeeargh! What are you doing!?\nTrucy:\nOh, just seeing if I could see through your hair... But it's like lead!\nApollo:\nPoint that thing at me any more, and it might all fall out.\nTrucy:\nThen I wouldn't need an x-ray machine to see through it!\nApollo:\n(Let's just get down to business, shall we?)\nEma:\nRight. Let's test it on a sample, first. It just so happens that I have a lottery ticket here. You set the sample in the device like so...\nApollo:\n...I don't see anything.\nEma:\nPatience. There's no need to get all antsy. Look at the right side of the screen. That's the \"layer view\" of the envelope.\nTrucy:\nLayer view...?\nEma:\nYou've got it set to display the outside of the envelope now, see? Actually, it's quicker to just have you give it a try. Turn that dial there with [right analog stick / arrow keys] for me, would you? (Changed from [Turn that dial there for me, would you?] in the original release) That's right. That's how you choose what \"depth\" you want to scan.\nTrucy:\nHey! I got something!\nEma:\nSee? That's how you can read the letters on the ticket inside. Cool, huh?\nApollo:\nExcept... I can't read them.\nEma:\nJust turn the dial a little more. What you have to understand is that a sheet of paper isn't really flat at all. When you zoom in that much, you see that paper is like a bunch of hills and valleys.\nTrucy:\nWow! Really?\nEma:\nThis x-ray device uses a beam with a wavelength of only 0.05 microns! It breaks cards down into thin layers, so it can only show what's written on that layer.\nApollo:\nI'm not entirely following you, but what good is it if you can't read anything?\nEma:\nThat's why we go on to step two! Try rubbing the image a bit, if you would.\nTrucy:\n\"Rubbing\"? Like going over the image with [left analog stick / WASD] while holding [A / Space]? (Changed from ['The image'? You mean rub the screen?] in the original release)\nRub entire area\nLeads to:\n\"There. That fixes the image on the screen.\"\nEma:\nThere. That fixes the image on the screen. Now, turn the dial again, just a little. Good. Now you can rub this image to \"fix\" it, too.\nTrucy:\nHey, I get it! We just keep doing this until we've got the whole thing!\nEma:\nExactly! Not bad!\nTrucy:\nNeat! Let's do some more!\nFully fix image\nLeads to:\n\"OK, let's print this one out.\"\nEma:\nOK, let's print this one out.\nIf \"BIG WINNER!\" ticket was printed\nTrucy:\nWoo hoo! I'm a big winner!!!\nEma:\nAh ha ha. See! This is the true hidden power of my weapon. Neat, huh?\nLeads to:\n\"Now let's try it out on the real thing, shall we?\"\nIf \"TRY AGAIN!\" ticket was printed\nTrucy:\n...Hmm. Does this mean I have to buy another one to win?\nApollo:\nWell, it's Ema's ticket. Let her buy another one.\nEma:\nIt's OK, there's no need. But see, this is the true hidden power of my weapon. Neat, huh?\nLeads to:\n\"Now let's try it out on the real thing, shall we?\"\nIf \"YOU LOSE!\" ticket was printed\nTrucy:\nOuch. \"You lose\".\nEma:\nAt least you know where you stand, eh? Anyway, now you see the true hidden power of my weapon. Neat, huh?\nLeads to:\n\"Now let's try it out on the real thing, shall we?\"\nEma:\nNow let's try it out on the real thing, shall we?\nFully fix image\nLeads to:\n\"OK, let's print this one out.\"\nEma:\nOK, let's print this one out.\nTrucy:\nSomeone deposited $100,000 into Mr. Misham's account? His paintings must be really valuable!\nEma:\nThere's another page in there. ...Care to take a look?\nTrucy:\nYou bet I do! If you're going to read someone's mail you might as well read it all!\nEma:\nHere goes with the second page, then.\nFully fix image\nLeads to:\n\"OK, let's print this one out.\"\nEma:\nOK, let's print this one out.\nTrucy:\n...So it was a letter about payment for one of his paintings.\nApollo:\nWhy all the secrecy, though? And...\nTrucy:\n...And what?\nApollo:\n...Why was this letter the only one in here? ...It's seven years old, right?\nTrucy:\nMaybe it had some special significance to him? Well, Ema?\nEma:\nWell indeed. ......\nApollo:\n(She knows something she's not telling us. ...Looks like she's keeping mum about it.)\nRed Envelope updated in the Court Record.\nRed Envelope (after Red Envelope is updated in the Court Record)\nTrucy:\nBut we just did the X-ray detection thing!\nApollo:\nOh, right. Sorry.\nAnything else\nApollo:\nEma, I was wondering if you could take a look at this...\nEma:\nLook, I'm a detective. A detective! You can't just ask me any old thing and expect an answer, OK? I think you need to be a little more focused in your inquiries. Scientific, even.\nApollo:\n(Somehow I knew she'd get around to science.)\nExamine evidence\nHidden Painting\nPeach\nTrucy:\nHey, Apollo. This painting, I know it!\nApollo:\nHuh? Really!?\nTrucy:\nIt's that story where the old woman is doing the wash in the river... ...and this giant peach comes a' floating on down.\nApollo:\n...That might possibly be the strangest thing I have ever heard.\nCoffee Mug\nLip mark\nTrucy:\nHey... look there! That stain doesn't look so healthy, Apollo! That must be the \"Blue Mountain\" stuff we've been hearing about!\nApollo:\nSomething tells me that even Blue Mountain Coffee isn't THIS blue. No, this stain is probably... (Hmm, better ask Ema.)\nLip mark (after Tiny Frame is added to the Court Record)\nTrucy:\nSee that, there? That's poison.\nApollo:\nYeah.\nTrucy:\nDon't lick it, Apollo!\nApollo:\nDon't worry, I'll be fine.\nTrucy:\nNo, you won't! You'll die!\nApollo:\nLook, I know! I meant I won't lick it!\nTrucy:\nWho knows what you do when I'm not watching...\nApollo:\n(...The concern is touching, really. Next thing you know she'll be telling me not to drink coffee before bedtime...)\nRed Envelope (before Red Envelope is updated in the Court Record)\nSeal\nTrucy:\nApollo, look! It's been opened once here.\nApollo:\n...You're right. I wonder if there's some way we can see what's inside?\nTrucy:\nShould I try to get it open and then stick it back shut?\nApollo:\nLet's not tamper with the evidence, shall we? I've got a better idea...\nTrucy:\n...Ema! Let's ask her!\nTiny Frame\nBack side\nApollo:\nHmm... Looks like you have to take this back part off first to put a photo inside.\nTrucy:\nIt'd have to be a really small photo to fit in there.\nApollo:\nTrue. And that pale bluish stain... Why would there be poison in a place like this?\nTrucy:\nWell, there's one obvious reason. Whoever put poison in the coffee rubbed a bit on here, too!\nApollo:\nThat's not very obvious, Trucy.\nAfter clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option, then adding Tiny Frame to the Court Record and updating Red Envelope in the Court Record\nApollo:\nSo, Ema, I was wondering... What's the story about this reporter that came here for a story the night of the crime?\nEma:\nAh! I'm afraid I can't tell you, because he's going to be a witness tomorrow, I hear.\nLeads to:\n\"I thought so.\"\nTrucy:\nI thought so.\nEma:\nI'll never forget that face, but what was his name...? Oh, right. Brushel.\nTrucy:\nBrushel...\nEma:\nHe's after a scoop to sell to the papers.\nApollo:\nSo a reporter comes for an interview with a painter. His first interview ever, and that night, he's killed. Seem strange to you?\nTrucy:\nReally strange.\nEma:\nIt does raise a few questions.\nApollo:\nI'd like to speak with this reporter if I could.\nEma:\nWell, I hear he's on the beat today, too. ...He said something about covering a magician.\nApollo:\nMagician...? (Well, if it's not Trucy, that leaves only one other person.)\nTrucy:\nIt wasn't Valant Gramarye, by any chance, was it?\nEma:\nYeah, something like that! He's got some big show lined up, I hear.\nApollo:\n(So, he's out interviewing Valant Gramarye... Looks like I'll be heading out to that coliseum again sooner than I thought.)\nEma:\nHere, I'll give you that reporter's card if you want.\nBrushel's Card added to the Court Record.\nExamine evidence\nBrushel's Card\nFront side\nTrucy:\nI guess you gotta have a good business card if you work freelance.\nApollo:\nReally. What's this... a camera lens finder?\nTrucy:\nDo reporters take photos too?\nApollo:\nI guess if he's freelance, he'd have to.\nTrucy:\nMaybe you should try being a prosecutor and a defense attorney! You'd always win!\nApollo:\nWhy don't I become a rock star too, while I'm at it?\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, then visiting any other location:\nOctober 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nGuard:\nAh, you're here to see Vera Misham?\nApollo:\nYes, that's right!\nGuard:\nShe's in the medical office at the moment.\nTrucy:\nMedical office...? Is she OK?\nGuard:\nShe's just lying down. Said she didn't feel so good. I'm sorry but I can't allow any meetings at the moment.\nApollo:\nMost. Annoying. Client. Ever.\nTrucy:\nGuess we should come back.\nAfter clearing \"Valant Gramarye\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency:\nOctober 7Sunshine Coliseum\nTrucy:\nWoo hoo! This is it, Apollo! The place where magic and dreams converge!\nApollo:\nJust a while ago it was the place where murder and nightmares converged.\nTrucy:\nLet's go say hi to Uncle Valant!\nApollo:\n(What about the case...?)\n???:\nWaaaah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!\nTrucy:\nOnly a performer laughs like that...\nValant:\nThe young Miss Trucy! How often I hoped we'd meet again only to tell myself it was an impossible dream!\nTrucy:\nTee hee, Uncle Valant! How's it going? I'm glad to see you, too!\nValant:\nOf course you are.\nApollo:\n(Humility is definitely NOT one of his stronger traits...)\nValant:\nWell, Miss Trucy, how does the day find you? If you've come to give me flowers, do it after the show, I beg you.\nTrucy:\nActually, we came to wish you good luck! And congratulations on your big magic show!\nValant:\nOh? But it is I who wish to congratulate you! Not everyone is so lucky as to witness miracles such as I shall perform!\nApollo:\n(Yeah, yeah, you're amazing, we get the picture.)\nValant:\nThe world will watch in wonderment as Magnifi's illusions are reborn! Here, on stage! By my hand!\nExamine\nBlue Badger\nApollo:\n...Hey, that creature there. He was handing out balloons during our last case, too.\nTrucy:\nHe's not a \"creature\", Apollo! Poor guy.\nApollo:\nOh, sorry. Was I mean somehow?\nTrucy:\nYou know how hot it is inside one of those suits? He's stuck in there, with only the smell of his own sweat to keep him company. On the verge of passing out, he hands out each balloon as though it were his last!\nApollo:\nKind of takes the fun out of seeing the Blue Badger.\nColiseum building\nApollo:\nYou know, I thought this at the time of the Gavinners's concert, too, but... ...this coliseum is just way too big. It's huge.\nTrucy:\nIt's got a big-sounding name, too... \"Sunshine Coliseum\", was it?\nValant:\nAh ha ha ha ha ha! Would you like to hear what the grand finale of the show in three days will be?\nTrucy:\nWhat!? Really!? Yeah, yeah!\nValant:\nEh heh heh... The grand finale will be nothing other than...\nApollo:\nDon't tell me. You're going to make the coliseum disappear, right?\nValant:\n...Ah!\nApollo:\n(Oh. Oops. Looks like I was right.)\nValant:\n......\nTrucy:\nApollo! I can't believe you'd use your power of perception on something like this!\nApollo:\nIt was just a wild guess, really.\nHot air balloon\nTrucy:\nLook, Apollo! A balloon! A hot air balloon!!!\nApollo:\nWith the Gramarye seal on it, no less.\nValant:\nWell, this is a long-awaited revival, after all! And it's been seven years, you know. I've spent plenty of time and a pretty penny on promotion.\nTrucy:\nI hope it's a huge success, Uncle Valant!\nValant:\nOh, I intend for it to be nothing less, I assure you!\nApollo:\n(They both sure seem excited about it. I guess it's a big deal for magicians.)\nSignboard\nApollo:\nThey've changed the sign since our last case.\nTrucy:\nIt was all Gavinners back then, wasn't it?\nApollo:\nI hope nothing bizarre and mysterious happens this time.\nValant:\nBut it shall! Why, the show itself will be bizarre and mysterious, I assure you!\nApollo:\nI don't have a problem with mystery as long as it's legal.\nTrucy:\nI don't think lawyers and magicians were really meant to have conversations like this.\nTalk\nThe big magic show\nTrucy:\nEveryone's talking about the big magic show! Is it true that the \"Gramarye Miracle\" is back after a seven year absence?\nValant:\n...Miss Trucy. I must apologize. This show, and this honor, should have been his.\nTrucy:\nDaddy...\nValant:\nMy co-magician-in-training Zak Gramarye... If that terrible thing hadn't...\nTrucy:\n...It's OK.\nValant:\nYour father was a great magician, Trucy. If he were alive, then I, Valant Gramarye... ...would have been proud to stand upon this stage as his assistant!\nTrucy:\nThanks... Uncle Valant. You know, I'm happy you're doing the show! To think, we get to see the Great Magnifi's illusions again!\nApollo:\n(She really is looking forward to this, isn't she.)\nMagnifi Gramarye\nValant:\nMy mentor, the magnificent Magnifi Gramarye was a true deity among magicians. A creator-god who gave birth to magic and illusions that defied our very imaginations!\nTrucy:\nI was so little when I last saw one, but I still remember his shows! He did wheelies in a sports car through the air above the audience...! And then sped off to outer space, faster than the speed of sound!\nApollo:\n(I'm guessing that memory was a bit embellished.)\nValant:\nFor seven long years, the world has been waiting for a miracle to match his. As heir to the Gramarye Troupe's secrets, it falls to me to provide one. It is my god-given destiny!\nApollo:\nUm...\nValant:\nYes! You, nameless face who speaks for the nameless masses. How can I help you?\nApollo:\nIf the world was waiting, why did you hold off for seven long years?\nValant:\nHmm... It appears the lad is uninformed! Perhaps you have heard of the magic known as \"law\" which governs our land?\nApollo:\n...I have, though I'm not sure it qualifies as \"magic\".\nValant:\nThe performance of Magnifi's miracle was impossible. ...A certain \"law\" prevented it for seven years. But no more!\nApollo:\n(\"Seven years\"... That phrase sure likes to pop up, doesn't it...)\nTrucy:\n...And why was that?\nValant:\nA little matter called \"performance rights\", Miss Trucy.\nPerformance rights (appears after \"Magnifi Gramarye\")\nTrucy:\nCan you tell us about these \"performance rights\"?\nValant:\nMagnifi's magic relied on an incredibly innovative idea... a \"trick\", if you will. That trick... was considered his property, and as such, was protected by property laws.\nApollo:\nIntellectual property, maybe?\nValant:\nMagnifi knew this and bequeathed it in his will... ...to one person.\nApollo:\nYou mean... him!?\nValant:\nYes. Miss Trucy, it was your father. Zak Gramarye was the inheritor of the Gramarye Miracle!\nTrucy:\nDaddy...\nValant:\nYet, as you well know, he is gone. He disappeared suddenly, seven years ago.\nApollo:\n(I think I see where this story is going...) Once a person is classified missing for a certain period of time... ...they're considered legally deceased, correct?\nValant:\n...In all absoluteness. Those rolled-up sleeves conceal your competence well, young man! That \"certain period of time\" of which you speak... is seven years.\nTrucy:\nAh...\nValant:\nYes, Miss Trucy... Though it pains me to say it. This past spring... April to be precise, was the time. Your father was legally declared deceased. In the absence of a formal will... ...the secrets of our mighty mentor Magnifi passed to me. This was, in fact, stipulated in the will by Magnifi himself.\nTrucy:\nIs... that how it works, Apollo?\nApollo:\nYeah. It's called \"death in absentia\". He's declared missing... permanently.\nTrucy:\nDaddy...\nMr. Brushel, Journalist (appears after presenting Brushel's Card)\nValant:\nA man by that name called on me just now.\nApollo:\nJust now...\nValant:\nValant's vision is always toward tomorrow! Valant's feet step always forward! ...That is all.\nTrucy:\nThat's all... very confusing.\nValant:\nI am to perform a big magic show, yes? I wanted someone to cover it. Yet, he had ears only for that incident...\nApollo:\nThat incident?\nValant:\nIn any case, I requested that the rapacious reporter remove himself. So a painter has died, what of it!? It is but a footnote in the footlights compared to the magic of Gramarye!\nTrucy:\nUncle Valant! Do you know where the reporter went?\nValant:\n...I recommended he visit that place popular with penalized perpetrators.\nApollo:\n(The detention center...?)\nValant:\nHe was a rude individual. Might I see that card?\nApollo:\nUh, sure...\nValant:\n...He would tear apart my respectability? I will tear apart him!\nTrucy:\nOoh! Here it comes, Apollo! Uncle Valant's big magic trick!\nApollo:\nIs he going to fix the card? (Not sure that qualifies as \"big\" magic...)\nTrucy:\n......\nValant:\n......\nTrucy:\nWhat happened to the big magic...?\nValant:\nAh ha ha ha ha ha! Is it not more miraculous for it to stay ripped?\nApollo:\n(He must have really not liked that journalist...)\nMr. Brushel, Journalist (subsequent times)\nValant:\nA man by that name called on me just now.\nApollo:\nJust now...?\nValant:\nValant's vision is always toward tomorrow! Valant's feet step always forward! ...That is all.\nTrucy:\nThat's all... very confusing.\nValant:\nI am to perform a big magic show, yes? I wanted someone to cover it. Yet, he had ears only for that incident...\nApollo:\nThat incident?\nValant:\nIn any case, I requested that the rapacious reporter remove himself. So a painter has died, what of it!? It is but a footnote in the footlights compared to the magic of Gramarye!\nTrucy:\nUncle Valant! Do you know where the reporter went?\nValant:\n...I recommended he visit that place popular with penalized perpetrators.\nApollo:\n(The detention center...?)\nPresent\nGramarye Envelope\nApollo:\nUm, I was wondering if you could tell me about this?\nValant:\nAh ha! Why, that bears the Gramarye seal! ...... Hmm.\nTrucy:\n...Uncle Valant? Is something wrong?\nValant:\n...Trucy. Where... did you get this?\nTrucy:\nHuh? Um, Daddy gave it to me.\nValant:\nYour... Y-Y-Y-Your D-D-D-Daddy!? My partner, Zak Gramar--\nTrucy:\nNo, no, no. My other daddy, Phoenix Wright!\nValant:\nWhy now... Why would your Lord Daddy...!?\nApollo:\n(\"Lord Daddy\"? That's kind of stretching the whole archaic thing a bit...)\nValant:\nThis signature upon the back. Do you recognize it? That belongs to none other than Zak Gramarye!\nTrucy:\nWhaaaaaaaaat!? Daddy signed this!?\nValant:\nMight I be so bold as to open it?\nApollo:\n...I-I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that!\nValant:\nMmmmnk. Ah... Ah.\nApollo:\n(What's in this envelope, I wonder...?)\nGramarye Envelope (subsequent times)\nValant:\nThis signature... Why, it's none other than Zak Gramarye! Perhaps I might take a look inside?\nApollo:\nNo means no! Trucy's father didn't want us to open it yet.\nValant:\nHrmmmm... Ah... Ah. Your Lord Daddy... Why?\nApollo:\n(...What could be in this envelope...?)\nBrushel's Card\nApollo:\nSo, a journalist was here on a story?\nValant:\nAll eyes in the universe are upon my stage. All pens seek to commit its mysteries to paper!\nTrucy:\nUm, his name was Brushel.\nValant:\nBrushel... Brushel... Brushel... Brushel...\nTrucy:\n...I think he remembers him!\nApollo:\nHe doesn't look too happy about it.\nValant:\nBrushel... That cloying smell of mint when he smiles, yes...\nTrucy:\nUm, could you tell us more about him? What did he want?\nBrushel's Card (subsequent times)\nValant:\n...Put that away. I care not to see it ever again.\nApollo:\n(He really didn't like that guy, did he?)\nTrucy:\nLet's ask why, Apollo!\nAnything else\nValant:\nAh ha ha ha ha ha! A challenge, is it? You want me to make that disappear? Very well! Give it to me!\nApollo:\nAck! N-N-No thanks! (Are all magicians like this?)\nTrucy:\nApollo? What was that look just now?\nApollo:\nI was just thinking how hard it is to get any information out of a magician.\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Gramarye Envelope:\nValant:\nNow, the time has come when I must return to make my prestidigitation preparations! By your leave, Miss Trucy.\nTrucy:\nThanks, Uncle Valant!\nValant:\nThree days from now... make ready for a miracle!\nApollo:\nWhat do you think that journalist was after? And why did Valant react like that to this envelope?\nTrucy:\nI think it's time to pay the detention center another visit.\nExamine\nColiseum building\nApollo:\nWorkers are busily preparing the coliseum for the magic show three days from now. Maybe we should go check it out... once this case is solved.\nHot air balloon\nApollo:\nA hot air balloon. You hardly see those anymore these days. It kind of reminds me of when I was a kid. Maybe Valant's playing the nostalgia card to drum up interest in the show.\nSignboard\nApollo:\nThat was a Gavinners sign last time, wasn't it? I hope nothing strange happens this time around...\nOctober 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room\n???:\n...I think I hear what you're saying. \"We're All Doing It For The Money\", end quote.\nGuard:\nNo no no no! Not at all!\nApollo:\n...Looks like someone's already meeting here.\nTrucy:\nMaybe that reporter?\n???:\nHey there! How ya doing? Who might you be?\nApollo:\nAh, sorry, we didn't know someone was already here. I'm Apollo Justice, attorney at law. (Talk about a nervous monkey.)\n???:\nYou? You're Justice!? You?\nApollo:\nYou... know me?\n???:\nDo I know you? Of course I know you! \"Stares Down Witnesses On Stand Till They Spill Beans\", end quote.\nApollo:\nTh-That's not true! (What's he writing...?)\nTrucy:\nAre you a reporter by any chance?\n???:\nWoo! You! You're Trucy!\nTrucy:\nEh? Am I famous?\n???:\nOh yeah. Oh yeah! \"Trucy Wright Hates Carrying A Bag: Puts Everything She Owns In Her Panties\", end quote.\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeek! That's so not true!\n???:\nJust hold on to your breeches, there. I'll wrap up this interview in a jiffy.\nTrucy:\nInterview...?\n???:\nSo, guard. I think I know what's going on here. \"Guarding Rooms Is My Life. What Else Could I Possibly Need?\" end quote.\nGuard:\nNo! How many times do I have to tell you this? Look, I've got work to do. You deal with him.\nTrucy:\nUm... did you come here to interview the guard?\n???:\nOoh wee, what a pickle! \"Accused Wouldn't Talk, Had To Interview Someone Or Go Plum Crazy\", end quote.\nTrucy:\nHuh...\nApollo:\n...I should've guessed.\n???:\nWhere're my manners!?\nBrushel:\nName's Brushel. Spark Brushel. \"I'm Not Picky -- Journalist Just Closes Eyes, Writes\", end quote.\nApollo:\n(What's that nauseatingly strong mint smell every time he grins?)\nBrushel:\nUntil you've been interviewed by me, you don't know what thrilling is! \"Wild Romp Through Crossroads Of Mayhem, Madness\", end quote.\nApollo:\n...I can see that. (He's writing something again! Well, if he's a reporter, maybe he knows something...)\nTalk\nSpark Brushel\nTrucy:\nSo, Mr. Brushel... You're a journalist?\nBrushel:\nAh me? Look, let me state one thing for the record here...\nTrucy:\n...Y-Yes?\nBrushel:\nI'm the interviewer. You understand, yeah? \"I'm The One Asking The Questions Here\", end quote.\nTrucy:\nOK...\nBrushel:\n...For instance! You think a movie director watches movies?\nTrucy:\n...Well, I think he probably does.\nBrushel:\nExactly! I knew you'd understand.\nApollo:\n(...Huh?)\nThe night of the crime\nTrucy:\nSo, the night of the murder... ...you were at Drew Studio?\nBrushel:\nWho? Me? Look, let me state one thing for the record...\nTrucy:\n...Y-Yes?\nBrushel:\nI may look calm and collected, but I'm busy. Real busy. Always on the road. \"Journalist Always Buys One-Way Tickets, Never Looks Back\", end quote.\nTrucy:\nI can understand that philosophy, but...\nBrushel:\nYou want to know the thing about one-way tickets? Once you use them, they're gone. ...All because you have to give them to the guy at the airport.\nTrucy:\nTrue enough. But don't they give normal tickets away, too?\nBrushel:\nExactly! See? It's the same thing!\nTrucy:\n...What is?\nApollo:\n(*sigh*)\nThe interview\nTrucy:\nSo, you went to do a story on Drew Misham... ...and he'd never had a story done about him before?\nBrushel:\nThat's right! Look, let me state one thing for the record here...\nTrucy:\nWh-What...?\nBrushel:\nI'm sure you're going to want to know about my source. What tipped me off to Drew? Why do the interview in the first place?\nTrucy:\nWell... yes.\nBrushel:\nLook, it's like... Oh! I've got it! Say there's this burger joint with fabulous ketchup. You think the burger guy's going to tell me where he got it?\nTrucy:\n...At the supermarket, maybe?\nBrushel:\nExactly! See? That's what I'm talking about.\nApollo:\n(I think I may have actually understood that one.)\nPresent\nAnything\nBrushel:\nAh, right. Let me go on the record here.\nTrucy:\nY-Yes?\nBrushel:\nI know what you're going to say. \"Brushel! Take This, Write Brilliant Column!\" end quote.\nApollo:\nI don't think so!\nBrushel:\nLook, buddy, I write brilliant columns about one thing: ...and that's food. Try to understand.\nApollo:\n(What could he possibly be writing? He didn't listen to a word I said!)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nBrushel:\nWell, there's nothing I can talk about really. \"Walls Have Ears, Eyes -- Especially Glass Walls With Speakers\", end quote.\nApollo:\nRight. Guess we'll leave then.\nBrushel:\nAh, but since you're here... ...might as well tell you a tidbit of news I saw. Just for the heck of it.\nTrucy:\nSure, tell us! ...Just for the heck of it.\nBrushel:\nI remember it like it was yesterday... ...I'd seen a movie on a trip, and wandered into this burger place with amazing ketchup... ...when an article in a tabloid caught my eye. \"Famous Oil Painting Stolen From Art Dealer's Gallery\", end quote, I believe it was.\nApollo:\nAn oil painting...?\nBrushel:\nHappens every day, right? But, I thought I'd seen that painting somewhere before. ...A painting of a giant peach floating down a river.\nApollo:\n(Someone stole an oil painting... of a giant peach.)\nBrushel:\n\"Journalist Can Smell Scoop Better Than Burgers\", end quote.\nOctober 7Drew Studio\nEma:\nWell, how'd it go? Find anything out?\nApollo:\nActually, there was one thing I wanted to check with you.\nEma:\nWh-What's with that scary face you're making?\nApollo:\n(And what's with the \"I know something but I'm not telling\" face you've got going, Ema?)\nTalk\nForger (appears after presenting Hidden Painting)\nTrucy:\nSo, what exactly is a \"forger\"?\nEma:\nWell, basically, it's someone who makes \"forgeries\". Fakes, in other words.\nTrucy:\nFakes...?\nEma:\nCopies of an original. Exact copies, so precise, you can't tell them apart.\nTrucy:\nWell, why not just photocopy them?\nEma:\nThe big problem with forgeries... ...is that people try to sell them as the real article. It's a crime, of course.\nTrucy:\nSo, Drew Misham was...?\nEma:\nA criminal? I'm afraid so. He received money to create elaborate forgeries. ...To supplement his work in illustration, I guess.\nApollo:\nI see.\nEma:\nActually... ...that's why I brought this here in the first place.\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean?\nEma:\nWhen you're trying to determine if a painting is a forgery... ...the rough sketch underneath can be a valuable clue.\nTrucy:\nSo the rough sketch is like practice for the real thing! Like doing a magic trick in front of a mirror before you go on stage!\nEma:\n...But not in the case of a forgery. Not necessarily, anyway. You know what the finished product is going to look like, after all.\nTrucy:\nOh, yeah. I guess you would.\nEma:\nThat's why I brought this. I'm going to use it to see what's under the paint of the finished pieces.\nApollo:\n(I get it now...)\nEma:\nNot that I really needed to go to such lengths. Seeing as how one of the paintings was only half-finished anyway.\nTrucy:\n...Still, it'd be neat to see Mr. Misham's rough sketches. Kind of like what he was drawing when he thought no one was looking.\nApollo:\n(True... That would be interesting. And maybe valuable for our case.)\nTrucy:\nYou should try buttering her up, Apollo! Flattery will get you everywhere, they say!\nApollo:\n(...Hmm, maybe I should ask Ema to help us out.)\nPresent\nHidden Painting\nApollo:\nThis painting... came from behind that dresser.\nEma:\nAh, yes. So?\nApollo:\n...It was stolen, no?\nEma:\n...... I was hoping you wouldn't figure that out.\nApollo:\nDo you think you could tell us a bit about this?\nEma:\n...I suppose. It's what you think. Drew Misham... was a forger.\nTrucy:\nA forger...?\nHidden Painting (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nEma... about this painting from behind the dresser there.\nEma:\n...Ah, yes. It's what you think. Drew Misham... was a forger.\nTrucy:\nA forger...?\nPortrait, Acrylic, or Landscape (after clearing \"Forger\" Talk option)\nLeads to:\n\"Um, I kind of wanted to see the rough sketch under this painting.\"\nApollo:\nUm, I kind of wanted to see the rough sketch under this painting. And I was wondering if your \"tool\" there might do the trick?\nEma:\nOh, fine. Fine! Just this time, though.\nTrucy:\nLet's check it out!\nFully fix any painting\nLeads to:\n\"OK, let's print this one out.\"\nEma:\nOK, let's print this one out.\nApollo:\nWhat... What the heck?\nTrucy:\nWow, he really blows! The finished painting isn't anything like the rough!\nEma:\nDevices like mine didn't exist until recently. He probably thought he could draw any sort of thing he wanted to for the rough.\nTrucy:\nWhat do you mean?\nEma:\nWell, in the past, you could only analyze the composition of a rough sketch.\nTrucy:\nComposition?\nEma:\nIn other words, the traces of charcoal between paint and canvas. So you could tell if there had been a rough sketch... ...but not what it looked like.\nApollo:\nAh, I think I follow you. So, in essence, it wouldn't matter what was underneath the finished painting.\nEma:\nSome pros would actually paint out a rough sketch entirely. Then do a completely new painting on top of that.\nTrucy:\nSo Mr. Misham was drawing whatever he wanted before painting over them...?\nEma:\nPossibly. Is there a problem with that?\nApollo:\n(Not particularly... But something about the sketch itself is kind of... odd.)\nTrucy:\nYou're awfully silent all of a sudden, Apollo.\nApollo:\nYou think we could check out one of the other paintings!?\nEma:\nWell, sure. You like this detection stuff, don't you?\nFully fix either remaining painting\nLeads to:\n\"OK, let's print this one out.\"\nEma:\nOK, let's print this one out.\nApollo:\nThis one, too!\nTrucy:\nWhat's wrong, Apollo? You look so serious all of a sudden!\nApollo:\nUm, you think I could just look at the last of these?\nEma:\nFine by me. Knock yourself out.\nFully fix final painting\nLeads to:\n\"OK, let's print this one out.\"\nEma:\nOK, let's print this one out.\nApollo:\nWh-Wh... What the heck is all this!?\nEma:\n...I hesitate to ask why you're getting so excited.\nTrucy:\nYou sure your device isn't leaking some kind of strange radiation?\nApollo:\nTrucy! Look at these three sketches! ...Do you notice anything?\nTrucy:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Th-Th-They're...!!\nEma:\nNow you're both white as sheets! What's going on!?\nApollo:\nThese sketches... are of the three cases I worked on!\nEma:\nWhat...?\nApollo:\nThe murder in the poker room at the Borscht Bowl Club! The dead man pulling the noodle stand! And then... ...the events that transpired during the Gavinners concert!\nEma:\n...What could it mean? How could he have painted those things... and why!?\nApollo:\nThat's what I want to know!\nEma:\nWait! Is Drew Misham... ...your father?\nApollo:\nGive me a break! Does that seem even REMOTELY possible to you!?\nApollo:\n(I'd never even heard of any Drew Misham before. I hadn't even seen a picture of him. But there were my cases, drawn on his canvas! ...Every single one of them. It couldn't have been a coincidence. Just who was this Drew Misham... and what did he have to do with me?)\nTo be continued.\nNothing to examine during investigation\nApollo:\nNo clues here.",

I wouldn't think you could hide such a dark sketch under a little paint.\nApollo:\nWell, it is called \"oil paint\" for a reason. I bet it's pretty oily. The paint I mean.\nTrucy:\nI'm still waiting for you to get to your point.Apollo:\nGood morning!Vera:\n......Trucy:\nSo! You're... Vera, right? I'm Trucy! Trucy Wright! That's \"Wright\" with a \"W\"! Uh, but not \"write\", right?Vera:\n......Trucy:\nUm! We're... on your side! You can tell us anything! ...Please?Vera:\n...... ...Good morning...Apollo:\n...! (She... She speaks!)Trucy:\nHmm, not bad, not bad. But I think you'd do better with a little smile, you know? You're so pretty! You need to sell yourself, you know?Apollo:\nTrucy! Let's... take it easy for starters.Vera:\n...... ...Thank you for taking my case...Trucy:\n...!Apollo:\n(Okaaaaay... Well, that's a start, I guess.)Vera:\n......Apollo:\n(There she goes with the nail polish again...)Trucy:\nThat's great, really! It's so cultured!Vera:\n............ ...Want to try...?Trucy:\nOooooh! Really!?Apollo:\n*sigh* Girls... (The victim, Drew Misham, was a forger. And a stolen painting was found in his studio. A life of crime, really... ...And maybe one that led to his death.)October 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nWell, we will now... er... *cough* Begin the, er, trial of... Vuh... Vuh... Vuh... Vera Misham!Trucy:\n...Is the judge OK? His voice is all raspy, and he's looking around all nervous-like.Judge:\nErm... ahem. The repercussions of today's trial will, most likely, be felt for a long time. ...And may, indeed, alter our legal system forever.Klavier:\nToday is a test of the Jurist System... ...and the first step toward a new order in our courts.Trucy:\nDaddy's secret mission!Klavier:\nThe jurists will function like a jury. It is hoped their inclusion will help the courts to better reflect the people's will.Apollo:\nWhy... aren't there any jurists in the courtroom?Klavier:\nThree closed-circuit cameras watch this courtroom at all times. The jurists have access to everything that transpires. Jurists! Judge well, and judge cool.Judge:\nN-Now see here, Prosecutor Gavin! I-I was going to say that!Klavier:\nAh, my apologies, Herr Judge.Judge:\nAhem. Jurists! Today, er... Judge today's trial \"coolly\", if you would be so kind!Apollo:\n(The jurists are unbound by the letter of the law. They don't affect the trial with evidence... but by their \"feelings\". And we're about to find out just what effect they're going to have.)Judge:\nVery well, Prosecutor Gavin. The details of the case, if you would.Klavier:\nThe victim is the painter Drew Misham. He was killed in his own studio. His coffee... was poisoned. By whom, you ask? By none other than the defendant, Vera Misham.Apollo:Apollo:\nThere wasn't any poison in the coffee!Klavier:\nAchtung... Someone has been doing their homework! Indeed. Poison was not present in the coffee... but on the mug itself.Judge:\nThe mug...? Ah, residue was found on the rim, I see.Klavier:\nThe autopsy report describes the manner of our victim's death.Judge:\nThe court accepts this as evidence.Misham's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAccording to this report... ...the victim's death was caused by \"atroquinine\" poisoning.Klavier:\nA chemical compound that does not occur naturally. Lethal dosage is a mere 0.002mg. A touch of atroquinine in the body... ...is the touch of the Reaper's scythe.Judge:\nVery well, Prosecutor Gavin. You may present your witness.Klavier:\nI have for you today a simple man, for a simple case. ...A man who witnessed the murder in its entirety.Apollo:\n(That journalist, no doubt...)Klavier:\nThe witness will state his name and occupation.Brushel:\nAh! Right! Well, for starters, my name's Spark Brushel! My job is... a lone observer of the world!Apollo:\nIn other words, a freelance journalist, right?Brushel:\nAhem! If you don't mind, I'd like to state something here for the record.Judge:\nYes, Mr. Brushel?Brushel:\nI dislike conclusions, specifically, the jumping to aspect of conclusions. \"Preconceptions Make Park Sandbox of Endless Desert Waste...\" end quote.Apollo:\nBut, you are a journalist. You said so yourself yesterday.Brushel:\n...Well, that's true, yes. But you must understand, I stand before you today a man with a dream! I'm offering you my testimony in exchange for exclusive rights to the story! \"Scoop Turns Mr. Brushel Into THAT Mr. Brushel!\" end quote.Judge:\n...Let's hear your testimony then, shall we?Apollo:\n(A \"simple case\", eh, Gavin? For me, the jury... is still out.)Witness Testimony-- The Journalist's Story --Brushel:\nI visited the studio around 9:00 that night to do the interview.\nThe first outsider to enter the atelier! \"Journalistic History Made\", end quote!\nHis daughter brought us coffee right after we started.\nAnd you know what happened next. \"Star Falls!\" end quote.\nNo one else entered the room besides her the whole time.Judge:\nHmm... That does sound like a simple case. Unless... you were the one who poisoned him!Brushel:\nWh-Wh-Wh-Whatareyousaying!? Judge!Judge:\nAhem. Need I remind you, the cameras are rolling today. I felt the need to be a bit dramatic.Klavier:\nYou didn't do it, did you?Brushel:\nM-M-M-M-Medoathinglikethat!? Come on! That's like... \"Newsmaker Making the News\", end quote. Or even \"Contemporary Witch-Hunt\", end quote! I know! \"Wild Accusations Rock Courtroom\", end quote.Klavier:\nAh ha ha ha. Rock, indeed.Trucy:\nProsecutor Gavin sure looks like he's having fun.Apollo:\nI'm so happy for him.Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Justice, your cross-examination, please.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Journalist's Story --Brushel:\nI visited the studio around 9:00 that night to do the interview.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n9:00 at night? Isn't that a little late for an interview?\nBrushel:\nIf the great painter Drew Misham says, \"come at 9:00\"... ...believe you me, I go at 9:00! The first, and as it turned out, last interview with such a prolific painter!\nApollo:\nRight. Can you tell us what it was like when you arrived?Brushel:\nThe first outsider to enter the atelier! \"Journalistic History Made\", end quote!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou were the first reporter ever in \"Drew Studio\"?\nBrushel:\nPosterity will look back on that night as a turning point in journalistic history! \"A Basically Insignificant Step For All Mankind... But A Giant Step For That Brushel Guy\", end quote.\nKlavier:\nIf no one on the outside ever had access to the studio... ...then it would serve to reason that the deed was done by an \"insider\".\nApollo:\n(...By which he means Vera did it.)\nKlavier:\nSo, how did this epoch-making interview go?Brushel:\nHis daughter brought us coffee right after we started.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n...Would you mind being a little more specific?\nBrushel:\nOooh wee, let me tell you, I enjoy a cuppa. In fact, it all began when I was in third grade, no wait, fourth grade--\nApollo:\nThat's not what I meant!\nKlavier:\nI believe I know what Herr Forehead is driving at. This coffee the victim was served... Did anyone other than the victim touch it?\nApollo:\nR-Right! That! (That's what I was going to say, really.)\nBrushel:\nWell, now, if you've got a question to ask, you'd best straight up ask it! That's what I tell all the new recruits. Several times, if necessary. \"Write for a grade schooler\", that's my motto. Which isn't to say I can only write grade school-level stuff, mind you--\nApollo:\n...Who touched the coffee!?\nBrushel:\nDunno. I was in the back, looking at the studio's equipment when she served it.\nApollo:\n......\nKlavier:\n...And what happened next?Brushel:\nAnd you know what happened next. \"Star Falls!\" end quote.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWhat's this about a star falling?\nTrucy:\n\"Star Falls!\" huh... It's like an old telegram! \"Send Money, Over\".\nBrushel:\nZowie! You don't know? That's like a journalism code word. An important personage passes away... a star falls. Get it?\nTrucy:\nBut there's no gravity in space, is there? I wouldn't think stars could fall, really.\nApollo:\n...Does this matter?\nBrushel:\nHoo boy! This is good stuff, good stuff! How about \"Star Breaks\"... Nah... lacks punch. I know, I know! \"Star Dies\". Nah... lacks imagination. Of course, you could go with \"Drew Dies\". Straight, to the point. I like it.\nApollo:\n(I think we need to hear about something a little more substantial...)\n\n\n\nThe moment of death\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nUm, about when Mr. Misham passed away...\nBrushel:\nHoo boy, what a scene that was! He puts his coffee mug down with a crash, right?\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, and then?\nBrushel:\nThen the cold finger of Death touches his spine! Life's flame sputters and fails! So cold was that touch, he could do naught but tremble uncontrollably! ...Actually \"life's flame\" is a little tired. \"Life's river froze over\"... Yes! That's a go.\nTrucy:\n...I think he's starting his article already.\nApollo:\nCould you describe that a little more simply?\nBrushel:\nWell, as you can imagine, I was pretty surprised. He hit the floor, as they say. \"Artist's Seizure Is Final Performance\", end quote.\nKlavier:\nAtroquinine paralyzes the central nervous system. The body arches back like a bow, the limbs tremble, the throat burns--\nJudge:\nTh-That's quite enough of that! Some of us want to be able to sleep tonight.\nBrushel:\nOh yeah? Well I want details, lots of juicy details!\nKlavier:\nFor that you can listen to our last year's hit single. \"Atroquinine, My Love\", by the Gavinners.

How did you find that testimony?\n\n\n\nVery important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nWell, as an account of the moment of the victim's death, I'd say it's very important. ...Please add it to the testimony.\nJudge:\nVery well.

That's what my old boss always used to say. Never did get what he meant by it, though.\nApollo:\nBut you're still alive, which is to say, you didn't die.\nBrushel:\nOf course not! \"No Point Falling Before You're A Star\", end quote.\nApollo:\n...That's not exactly what I was getting at.\nKlavier:\nWhat were you getting at, then? You know the poison was on the rim, not in the coffee.\nBrushel:\nOh yes, yes! There were two cups on the tray she brought. And one of the cups had Drew's signature painted on the side.\nApollo:\n(Hmm. No chance the guest would take that one by mistake, I guess.)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Justice? Was that testimony important?\n\n\n\nVery important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nWe're talking about the coffee the witness drank.

Isn't that a little late for an interview?\nBrushel:\nIf the great painter Drew Misham says, \"come at 9:00\"... ...believe you me, I go at 9:00! The first, and as it turned out, last interview with such a prolific painter!\nApollo:\nRight. Can you tell us what it was like when you arrived?Brushel:\nThe first outsider to enter the atelier! \"Journalistic History Made\", end quote!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou were the first reporter ever in \"Drew Studio\"?\nBrushel:\nPosterity will look back on that night as a turning point in journalistic history! \"A Basically Insignificant Step For All Mankind... But A Giant Step For That Brushel Guy\", end quote.\nKlavier:\nIf no one on the outside ever had access to the studio... ...then it would serve to reason that the deed was done by an \"insider\".\nApollo:\n(...By which he means Vera did it.)\nKlavier:\nSo, how did this epoch-making interview go?Brushel:\nHis daughter brought us coffee right after we started.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n...Would you mind being a little more specific?\nBrushel:\nOooh wee, let me tell you, I enjoy a cuppa. In fact, it all began when I was in third grade, no wait, fourth grade--\nApollo:\nThat's not what I meant!\nKlavier:\nI believe I know what Herr Forehead is driving at. This coffee the victim was served... Did anyone other than the victim touch it?\nApollo:\nR-Right! That! (That's what I was going to say, really.)\nBrushel:\nWell, now, if you've got a question to ask, you'd best straight up ask it! That's what I tell all the new recruits. Several times, if necessary. \"Write for a grade schooler\", that's my motto. Which isn't to say I can only write grade school-level stuff, mind you--\nApollo:\n...Who touched the coffee!?\nBrushel:\nDunno.

Sure! I'm sure. Drew Studio isn't a big place, kiddo. I'd know it if someone else had come in!\nApollo:\nWhat if they had been hiding in there from before!?\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\nEven if someone had been hiding in the studio... ...they hardly could have poisoned that mug without anyone noticing.\nBrushel:\nYou think I, Spark Brushel, would miss something as obvious as that? Nooooo way.Trucy:\nHe sure makes it sound exciting. I guess that's his job.Apollo:\nThere's only one moment we need to focus on, really.Trucy:\n...The moment when Drew Misham died?Apollo:\nExactly. There has to be something there!Apollo:\nYou know what I have a problem with? A particular property of the poison used, atroquinine.Judge:\nOh? Prosecutor Gavin was quite clear about the poison. A lethal dosage of 0.002mg paralyzes the central nervous system. If you drank that, even you, Mr. Justice, would be reduced to a quivering pile...Apollo:\n(Why are you using me as an example!?) Unfortunately, we weren't told everything. There was a vital omission in Prosecutor Gavin's information!Klavier:\n......Judge:\nAn omission?Apollo:\nAtroquinine is as virulent as he says. But death doesn't come upon ingestion, not immediately. That's because atroquinine is slow-acting!Judge:\nSlow-acting!Brushel:\nWhatwhatwhatwhat!?Apollo:\nAccording to one forensic scientist...Ema:\nIt's one of the most virulent poisons, but is absorbed into the body astonishingly slowly. It takes at least 15 minutes from the time of ingestion for adverse effects to show.Apollo:\nIf we suppose that the moment Mr. Misham sipped the coffee was when he sealed his fate... ...then he would still have had time left to enjoy his last cup of joe!Judge:\nOrder! Order!!! What's the meaning of this!? If what the defense says is correct... ...why, that contradicts the entire testimony we've just heard!Apollo:\nWell, Mr. Brushel? Anything to say... on the record!?Brushel:\nSlow-acting. S-L-O-W A-C-T... It was virulent, alright. Even then, it had already begun digging its claws into the journalist.Trucy:\n...He's working on his scoop.Apollo:\n(*sigh*)Klavier:Klavier:\n...It's \"Brushel\", ja? Herr Brushel... let's take a trip back down memory lane.Brushel:\nHuh?Klavier:\nDid the victim really die the instant he took a sip? Think it over. This is vital.Brushel:\nYou know what I think? I think that was... \"A Not-So-Subliminal Suggestion\"... end quote.Klavier:\nI admit, it does cause a problem if he died when you say he died. ...I would be forced to say auf Wiedersehen to my simple case. And you would be forced to say farewell to your article.Brushel:\nCome again?Klavier:\nYou can't write a story based on conjecture, can you? And as the case drags on, other reporters will pick up the scent. ...And you'll be forced to kiss your exclusive scoop goodbye.Brushel:\nScoop... Scoop... .....................! Look, wait. Just wait a second. Just one second.Judge:\nWe're waiting, we're waiting! Out with it!Brushel:\nI think I just recalled a so-called \"important detail\"! \"A Revival of Recollection\", end quote! \"A Story's Survival\", end quote!Apollo:\n\"Attorney Utterly Confused\", end quote.Brushel:\nActually, I did notice something when I visited the studio. I'd heard of poison that \"takes its sweet time\", see!Klavier:\n...But not what I've been saying for the last few minutes, apparently.Judge:\nMr. Brushel! Are you saying you noticed something that explains what happened!?Brushel:\nYou bet I am! The \"Antidote For A Poisonous Contradiction\", end quote, you might say!Apollo:\nOr \"I Still Have No Idea What You're Talking About\", end quote, I might say.Brushel:\nI figured it out, but only after an in-depth interview! See, thanks to my journalism skills, I know who poisoned that coffee!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!Klavier:\nAs far as I can tell, the witness is standing by his testimony. ...That Mr. Misham died the instant after he drank.Brushel:\nOf course I'm standing by my testimony! ...And my dream of exclusive rights to this story!Klavier:\n...Ach. I suppose it was too much to hope for.Apollo:\nWhat was?Klavier:\nOf course he wouldn't choose a simple case, not him.Judge:\n\"Him\"...?Klavier:\nPhoenix Wright, who else?Apollo:\n...!Klavier:\nAchtung, Herr Brushel! Report for us, if you would. What is it that you noticed?Brushel:\n......Judge:\nThis court is a critical trial of the Jurist System. I'm afraid no room for doubt is permissible. You will testify to the court about what you noticed!Witness Testimony-- What Brushel Noticed --Brushel:\nWhen I arrived at the studio, Mr. Misham was at his desk.\nHe seemed to be writing a letter... but he quickly sealed the envelope.\nI thought nothing of it at the time, of course.\nNow that I think about it, what if he was writing a suicide note!?Judge:\nHmm... A suicide note?Brushel:\nYes... he had this look on his face. \"Man's Face Inscrutable As A Quadratic Equation\", end quote.Trucy:\nSuicide? Poor Mr. Misham... But that means Vera's innocent!Apollo:\nWould someone commit suicide in the middle of an interview?Trucy:\nOh.Judge:\nVery well, you may begin your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What Brushel Noticed --Brushel:\nWhen I arrived at the studio, Mr. Misham was at his desk.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWas there anyone at the studio other than Mr. Misham?\nBrushel:\nWell, his daughter Vera, of course.\nApollo:\nWas anyone besides Mr. Misham and Vera present?\nBrushel:\nNot a single one. Not a cat, not a rat, not even a mouse.\nApollo:\nThe only person who didn't belong to that studio there... ...was you, wasn't it, Mr. Brushel?\nBrushel:\nAh. Ah! I know what you're doing! I know your game! \"Attorney Uses Classic Ramsden Phenomenon Ploy\", end quote.\nKlavier:\nIf you intend to suggest that this reporter is a suspect... ...I'm sure you also intend to present evidence supporting that assertion, correct?

I arrive 15 minutes ahead of schedule! The handle turns, the door opens, and I barge in!\nApollo:\nAre you sure that's OK to do? I mean, isn't that unlawful entry, really?\nBrushel:\nMr. Misham sure seemed to think so! You shoulda seen him! He crammed his letter into that yellow envelope as fast as he could. I know a secret when I spot one, and that was one!\nJudge:\nIt does seem significant. Well, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\n(I wonder... It does have the ring of something important...)\n\n\n\nAdd to testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nThe defense finds this testimony vital, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nVery well, please add it to the testimony then.\nBrushel:\nHey, why not?

Nothing.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nNot one thing...? You're sure?\nBrushel:\nYep, sure as sure can be. ...Well, with one exception.\nJudge:\nOne exception!?

Not funny, I know, but still!\nApollo:\n(Did something leave the studio that night? Why does that sound familiar?

Let's get back to the cross-examination, then!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nJust one thing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nI think one thing might very well have left the studio that night, actually. A certain something that has vanished from the crime scene.\nJudge:\nBy which you mean... ...something other than our witness?\nApollo:\n...Of course.\nKlavier:\nDon't tell me. \"Vera Misham\"?\nApollo:\nBelieve me, any comic relief I may provide is entirely unintentional.\nJudge:\nThen, let's see what you've got for us, Mr. Justice!\nApollo:\nWell, this thing wasn't at the scene of the crime, so I can't show it to you.

And yeah, it was true.\nApollo:\nFurthermore, you went on to tell us... ...that he put the letter in a yellow envelope and put it in the letter box.\nJudge:\nAh...!\nApollo:\nBut that very same letter box was empty! In other words... ...that night, the \"yellow envelope\" disappeared!\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\n...Ah, yes, intriguing. So an envelope has disappeared from the scene of the crime. Of course... this changes nothing.\nApollo:\nHuh...?\nJudge:\nHe has a point, Mr. Justice. What we're trying to figure out here is how the poison got into Mr. Misham. Is it really important that this envelope the witness says he saw disappeared?\nApollo:\nWell, if it did disappear, then something did leave the studio that night. That seems very important to me!\nJudge:\nVery well then. The witness will add this to his testimony.\nBrushel:\nYou got it.\nKlavier:\n...I still think this fails to change anything, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\n(I wouldn't be so sure. A letter disappeared from the crime scene that night... This is exactly the opening I've been looking for!)\nChanges statement from \"And nothing left that studio after he died.

And you were hiding that fact from us!\nBrushel:\nEr, yes, well, actually...\nKlavier:\nI don't argue the possibility that a letter disappeared from that studio. ...But Herr Forehead, isn't there a much more serious question before us?\nApollo:\n(...Right, how Mr. Misham was poisoned. I know. But Mr. Brushel's testimony has changed, which means the facts of the case have, too.

Ah..................Apollo:\nAs we all know, stamps come with dried glue on the back. In order to use the glue you have to wet it... ...by licking the stamp!Klavier:Klavier:\nFeh. No one worth talking to actually licks stamps in this day and age.Apollo:Apollo:\nEven if you wanted to talk to him, you couldn't. ...He's dead, after all.Klavier:Klavier:\nOK, so he licked the stamp. But wait! How does that explain the atroquinine on the rim of the coffee mug?Apollo:Apollo:\nIf he licked the back of a poisoned stamp, the poison would get on his tongue, yes? What would then happen if he put the coffee mug to his mouth, hmm?Klavier:\n...!Apollo:\nThose traces on the mug weren't the killer's doing! It was the other way around!Judge:\nWhat!?Apollo:\nThe coffee mug didn't poison Mr. Misham... ...Mr. Misham poisoned the coffee mug himself!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! B-But that doesn't... Does it?Apollo:\nRecall, if you would... ...atroquinine is a slow-acting poison, yes? The poison entered his body when he put the stamp on that envelope. But his time wasn't up until the very moment he touched his lips to that cup of joe.Judge:\nYou have something to add, Mr. Brushel?Apollo:\n(Uh oh. His nose is picking up another scent...)Brushel:\nAs I believe I mentioned earlier.Brushel:\nWell, that's the thing, see. After he put his letter in that envelope... ...Mr. Misham sat there searching his desk drawer for something! Yes! A stamp! A so-called \"Postage Stamp\", end quote!Brushel:\nBut you know, I don't seem to remember him ever finding one.Judge:\nMaybe he'd just run out?Klavier:\nIncidentally, we searched the desk drawer at the scene of the crime. There were no stamps. Not a single one.Apollo:\n...!Judge:\nHmm, that does pose a problem. How will you prove that the stamp was coated with poison?Apollo:\nActually, I'm glad no other stamps were found. It makes proving the stamp he used was poisoned possible!Klavier:\nAh ha ha ha ha ha. ...Good show, good show. You can't even prove there was a stamp at the scene in the first place!Judge:\n...Well, let's hear what the defense has to say anyway. Where's your evidence that proves the existence of this poisoned stamp?Present Tiny Frame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that certainly is a cute little frame. And by little, I mean really little.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\n...... Well, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nI think our beloved attorney has been licking too many stamps in his free time.\nApollo:\n(Grr... Do you smile like that when you torture all your victims, or just me?)\nJudge:\nTake care that we don't lick you and stick you in the letter box, Mr. Justice!\nApollo:\n(...I think I'm making this out to be way more complicated than it really is. That stamp would have left a small atroquinine residue on something... But what?)\nLeads back to:\n\"...Well, let's hear what the defense has to say anyway.\"Judge:\nWell, that certainly is a cute little frame. And by little, I mean really little.Apollo:\nIt was on the victim's desk, Your Honor. ...Quite empty, as you can see for yourself.Klavier:\nI noticed that too during my inspection. So what?Apollo:\nAh, apparently you weren't as observant as you should have been. You see, when you saw this frame, it was missing something quite important.Judge:\n\"Missing\" something...?Apollo:\nYes. A pale bluish stain on the inside of the frame... Atroquinine residue!Klavier:\nWhat!? Why wasn't I told about this!?Apollo:\nThe frame is only two inches square. The face of the frame is even smaller. Maybe an inch wide at most.Klavier:\nYou aren't saying...Apollo:\n...Oh, but I am. Tell me: what fits in such a small frame? A commemorative stamp, perhaps?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!! The poisoned stamp was in this frame...!?Klavier:\nImpossible!Judge:\nP-Prosecutor Gavin...!Klavier:\nWhy would he put something like that on his desk? Don't tell me he had it there so he could commit suicide if the mood struck!Brushel:\nYou know, can I say something? I had a thought, see!Judge:\nWhat, Mr. Brushel, and please stop jittering around like that!Brushel:\nThe victim was a forger, right? There's a lot of money in that line of work. \"Forger Forges Friends, Makes Enemies, Too\", end quote.Apollo:\nSo the poisoned stamp might have been a murder weapon, aimed at him!Klavier:Klavier:\n...Oh, rich. That's rich. Leave the ridiculous flights of fancy to the Gavinners's song lyrics, please.Apollo:\n(Finally, something we agree on.)Klavier:\nThe stamp was a \"murder weapon\"? Nonsense! Murder is a simple business. Who would go to such lengths? No one.Apollo:\nOh, I disagree.Klavier:\nC-Come again...?Apollo:\nRecall, if you would, the victim's reclusive lifestyle. Drew Misham hid from the world. He avoided meetings. His only contact with the outside world... was the mail.Judge:\nThe... mail!Apollo:\nNow, if you wanted to kill someone you couldn't meet, but you knew read letters... ...a stamp would be the perfect weapon!Klavier:\nRidiculous! Where's your proof? I want proof! Show us evidence that this poisoned stamp was sent to him... as a murder weapon!Apollo:\n(I might not have \"evidence\" per se... But things are finally starting to come together!)Trucy:\nWh-What is it, Apollo? Your fists are trembling!Apollo:\nI think I know what happened! I don't believe it... but I can see it! I think I know how Mr. Misham was killed!Judge:\nWell, fill us in, Mr. Justice!Apollo:\n...A certain piece of evidence points to the truth, Your Honor. I can show you how someone with the intent to kill sent Mr. Misham the stamp of death!Present Red Envelope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Isn't this the envelope... the one from seven years ago?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\n...... I'm not sure it's entirely clear to me what this proves, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\nHuh...? (Was I wrong?)\nKlavier:\nI believe we have shown probable \"intent to kill\". Except the killer would be Herr Judge, and the victim, you!\nApollo:\nYeeeeargh!\nJudge:\nConsider that a warning, Mr. Justice. Think before presenting next time.\nApollo:\nYes, Your Honor. (Let's think this one over again.)\nLeads back to:\n\"...A certain piece of evidence points to the truth, Your Honor.\"Judge:\nIsn't this the envelope... the one from seven years ago?Apollo:\nThink about the text of the letter again. There were two pages in the envelope. This is page one. ...And this is page two. I want to draw your attention to one phrase in particular. \"...Send in the enclosed envelope with the enclosed stamp within 3 days.\" The enclosed stamp, Your Honor.Judge:\nAh...!Brushel:\nIn other words, if I have this straight... \"The Stamp! Poison! On The Stamp! Lick, Lick, Gasp...\" end quote!Apollo:\nNow, what if he had done exactly as the letter asked?Trucy:\nHe would sign the document, put it in the envelope... and put the stamp on it, right? Then he would put it in his letter box...!Apollo:\nFifteen minutes wouldn't have elapsed between affixing the stamp, and mailing the letter. But the clock started ticking, and when the time came... he drew his last breath. And the murder weapon would be taken away from the scene.Judge:\n...Quite conveniently, thanks to the postal system!Klavier:\n...Such a splendid imagination you have, Herr Forehead!Apollo:\n......Klavier:\nLet me confirm one thing with you, if I might. So, this \"poisoned stamp\" was inside this envelope from seven years ago... ja? Is that what you'd have us believe? Really?Apollo:\n...W-Well...Trucy:\nIt is a little bit of a stretch, but there's a possibility.Klavier:\nYes. A very small possibility. How small, I wonder?Trucy:\nUm...Klavier:\nA poisoned stamp in this envelope? A stamp that then became the murder weapon? How do you intend to prove this seeming coincidence?Trucy:\nW-Well...Apollo:\n(Ack! It was seven years ago, and we don't even know who sent that letter!)Klavier:\nAnd your answer... is silence, I see. Very well! I move to...???:\n...It's not nice to pick on the Fräulein, Klavier.Klavier:\n...!Apollo:\nAh... Ema!Ema:\nWell? Like my Kristoph Gavin impression? Did I sound like him?Apollo:\n...Don't quit your day job.Klavier:\nDon't you have a crime scene to be looking after, Fräulein Detective?Ema:\nSomeone had to come dig you all out of the mess you're making of this case.Apollo:\nMess...?Ema:\nYou know, none of this would happen if you just trusted in science a little more. You can find out if that stamp was in that envelope, easy.Klavier:\nCare to explain yourself, Fräulein Detective?Ema:\nGlare at me all you want, but science is on my side.

I think the witness is a bad influence on our judge.Judge:\n...I see no need for further debate on this matter.

Tickets for Gavinners's shows are invalid after two weeks.Judge:\nB-But it doesn't make sense any other way!Klavier:\n...It boggles my mind that so many people haven't noticed this. There's a fatal contradiction in Herr Forehead's claim!Apollo:\nA c-contradiction?Klavier:\nA poisoned stamp was placed in this envelope seven years ago. Whereupon it was framed, until now. If that's the case, then why would Drew Misham have done what he did?Apollo:\nE-Ema explained that! He must have realized it was poisoned!Klavier:\n...Therein lies the rub.Apollo:\n...!Klavier:\nSeven years ago, the forger Drew Misham sensed a trap, and put the stamp in a frame. I do not debate this. ...But this begs the question. Why, seven years later, did he use that stamp on the night of the murder?Apollo:\nAh...!Klavier:\nSurely, you don't mean to suggest that Mr. Misham simply \"forgot\"? He put the murder weapon in a frame on his desk for seven years... and forgot? You expect us to believe he sprang the trap on himself?Apollo:\n...... Uh... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh!Judge:\nWhile I admit, this is all quite shocking, myself... ...it does seem highly unlikely that he would fall afoul of a trap... ...that had been sitting on his desk for seven years!Trucy:\nA-Apollo!Apollo:\nI don't think we're winning anymore.Klavier:\nAh, I'm glad to see we're all back in the real world now. Welcome back to reality! We've been waiting for you.Apollo:Apollo:\nOK... Then how do you explain the poisoned stamp that was in this envelope?Klavier:\nThe \"poisoned stamp\"...? Where exactly is this poisoned stamp, again? Have you brought it to court for us?Apollo:\nUh...Klavier:\nI see no proof that such a thing ever existed.Apollo:Apollo:\nWhat about the atroquinine residue, huh!?Klavier:\nOh, I agree, that does seem to be atroquinine residue. But, Herr Forehead, it's certainly no stamp.Apollo:\n...! Y-Yeah, but...Klavier:\nEven if your precious poisoned stamp did exist... ...Drew Misham never would have used it. ...That is all.Apollo:\n...... Urk.Judge:\nI believe we've come to a conclusion. Again.Trucy:\nA-Apollo! Were we wrong the whole time?Apollo:\nI-I can't believe it! The poison traces match up! It can't be coincidence!Judge:\nI'd like to bring some closure to this issue, sometime this year. ...Mr. Justice?Apollo:\n...Yes, Your Honor!Judge:\nLet's review the facts, and see where we stand. Seven years ago, Drew Misham received a red envelope. There were traces of the poison atroquinine on the document inside that envelope. A similar trace was also found at the crime scene... ...on this tiny picture frame. The defense has indicated the possibility of a yellow envelope. An envelope that left the scene of the crime with the poisoned stamp on it.Klavier:\nYes, but even if this envelope contained a poisoned stamp... ...and Drew Misham, knowing this, put it in a frame... ...he never would have used that stamp!Judge:\n...I'm afraid you're right. Which means there is a fatal flaw in the defense's case!Apollo:\n(I haven't been on the wrong track this whole time, I'm sure of it! The traces of atroquinine, the envelope, the frame... ...and Drew Misham's mysterious death... They're all connected somehow!)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Justice, do you have a conclusion for us?Apollo:\n...The defense stands by its case, Your Honor. We've seen that the logical outcome of the evidence makes no sense. Which means that one of our clues... must be a fake.Klavier:\nAh, a fake clue? Fascinating! And if we find this fake, your wild fantasies will prove quite reasonable, ja?Apollo:\nThe fake clue that's thrown us off the poison's trail is none other than...the red envelope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nThis red envelope... is a fake?\nApollo:\n...Without a doubt, Your Honor.\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\n...Wasn't it you who presented this evidence to the court?\nApollo:\n...Oh.\nTrucy:\nHold on a second, Apollo! The poison on that envelope, the frame, and the coffee mug... They're all connected somehow!\nApollo:\nOh... right! (*sigh* I can hear it already. \"It looks like the fake... was you, Herr Forehead!\")\nTrucy:\nNow's no time for wallowing in self-pity! Let's get thinking, Apollo!\nLeads back to:\n\"The fake clue that's thrown us off the poison's trail is none other than...\"the frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nThis frame... is the \"fake\" clue?\nApollo:\n...Without a doubt, Your Honor.\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\n...Wasn't it you who presented this evidence to the court?\nApollo:\n...Oh.\nTrucy:\nHold on a second, Apollo!

That all makes sense. What doesn't make sense is the victim himself!Klavier:Klavier:\n...Congratulations. You've completely lost me. So the fake evidence is none other than the master of fake himself, the forger? ...It makes a good story, I'll give you that.Apollo:\n(The fake clue... Fakes... forgeries...) Ah...!Trucy:\nI know that face! That's the \"I just had an idea\" face!Apollo:\nI don't know if I'm right... but I'm going with it anyway! What if our \"forger\" is the \"fake\"!?Klavier:\n...Come again?Apollo:\nSeven years ago, our forger sniffed a trap, and stepped aside. ...Seven years passed. Now the forger stumbles into that very same trap, and dies. ...Why?Judge:\nThat's what I want to know!Apollo:\nBecause the forger who was killed... was a fake.Klavier:\nHere we are again. The victim... was a \"fake\"?Apollo:\nOne forger smelled the trap. One forger fell into the trap. That's two forgers! And one of them was a fake!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!!Klavier:\nSo you are telling us that Drew Misham, the victim, was a fake? Well, if he was the fake, who was the real forger? You'd better not be claiming there was some kind of switcheroo?Judge:\n...I'm afraid you're going to have to back up your story. Mr. Justice. Show us just who the real Drew Misham was!Apollo:\n(If Drew Misham wasn't the real forger... ...there's only one other person it could have been!) ...Understood, Your Honor.

The real identity of the forger known as Drew Misham is none other than... ...his only daughter, Vera Misham!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! ...Mr. Justice! This is going out on a limb, even for you!Trucy:\nI kinda agree. I mean, Vera, a forger?Apollo:\nLet's consider it before you write it off entirely. If you look at the paintings in the studio, one fact becomes quite clear. Forgery had been taking place in that studio for quite some time! The forger wasn't caught in that trap seven years ago. This can only mean that the one who was caught in the trap wasn't the forger!Judge:\nWell... Actually, that does make a certain kind of sense.Apollo:\nOne more thing! Only two sets of fingerprints were found in the forger's studio. Drew Misham's... and Vera Misham's.Klavier:\n......Apollo:\nIf we know that Drew Misham wasn't the forger... ...that leaves only one possibility, by process of elimination. The forger was Vera Misham. ...Well?Klavier:\n...... ...Fascinating!Judge:\nVera Misham...?Vera:\n......Judge:\nYou've been paying attention to the trial so far?Vera:\n......Klavier:\nLet's just ask her and be done with it, shall we? Who are you? Who is the forger, Drew Misham?Vera:\n...... ...! ......Apollo:\n(Was that... an expression of emotion I saw on her face? She's staring holes into Prosecutor Gavin's face...)Klavier:\n...I'm used to being stared at by Fräuleins, believe me. Though they usually talk to me, too. Tell us. Were you the one who forged those works of art?Vera:\n...... ...Yes...Apollo:\n...!Judge:\nSo... so the forger, Drew Misham was... you!?Vera:\n...... ...Yes, it was me...Judge:\nWha...

It's time! To the courtroom, please!Apollo:\nR-Right! (Out of time...)Trucy:\nWait, Vera! Just one more thing, please! Those three paintings in the studio...Vera:\n...I painted those, as part of my work...Trucy:\nRight. See, we checked them out and we saw what was underneath. We saw the rough sketches underneath the three finished paintings...Vera:\n...I see... ...... ...Mr. Justice...Apollo:\n...Yes!?Vera:\n...Father... He knew of you... ...Of both of you...Apollo:\nYour late father...?Vera:\n...He was watching, gathering information... ...All about the \"Wright & Co.

(Things are already confusing enough with all these daddies running around. We know that the victim's daughter, Vera, was the forger. What does this mean for the case...?

She's drilling more holes into his head.)Trucy:\nI know it's hard for you, but hey, he's a handsome guy.Apollo:\nWhat's \"hard\"!?Judge:\nVery well, miss, if you would... ...did you really make those detestable forgeries...?Vera:\n...!Klavier:\nPerhaps you'd rather answer my question? Were you the one who painted that painting. The remarkably similar one?Vera:\n...Ah... Yes... ...I painted it, yes... ...Father praised me quite highly for it...Judge:\nSo... she was the one who made the forgeries.Klavier:\nYet, she did not wish to reveal the truth of their operation. So the victim was a stand-in, a decoy. To the world at large, he was the forger, not her.Vera:\n...... ...I've done... a bad thing. I have, haven't I...?Klavier:\nRegardless, we need a little more information. About, for instance... ...this!Apollo:\n...!Klavier:\n...You have seen this before, ja?Vera:\n...Y-Yes...

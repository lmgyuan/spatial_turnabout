It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.Back side of Prosecutor's BadgeEdgeworth:Each Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back.

I thought it would be nice if we could share the romance of the constellations together.Edgeworth:...I beg your pardon, but I would like to leave.Ray:Sorry, sorry. It was just a joke. Do you know about the final case your father worked on? The \"IS-7 Incident\"?Edgeworth:Yes... Manfred von Karma showed it to me immediately after I became a prosecutor. I reviewed the case file again last night, after you invited me here. And... while I don't remember it very well, I also had been in attendance at the trial back then. (When I was young... I loved watching my father do battle in the courtroom. During that trial, it was my father, the defense attorney Gregory Edgeworth against... ...my former mentor, Prosecutor Manfred von Karma. And while the trial ended with the defendant being declared guilty...)Ray:I see... So you were there too, at Gregory's final trial. In that case, I'll cut to the chase and tell you what you want to know. The truth about the \"IS-7 Incident\". It happened 18 years ago, during the winter... All the buildings were covered in snow, coating the entire town like a layer of frosting. And it was in this very place, that the incident occurred. This was all before Uncle Ray became a defense attorney...-- 18 Years Ago --December 24, 5:00 PMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomExamine evidenceFront side of Attorney's BadgeRay:The defense attorney's badge is shaped like a sunflower. Does the shape have any special meaning?Gregory:Well. A sunflower always points towards the sun, right? From there, it's said to represent \"freedom\" and \"justice\".Ray:Then, I'll also aim towards becoming a defense attorney, just like a sunflower!Gregory:He he... I look forward to it.Back side of Attorney's BadgeRay:The number engraved on the back, is it like the badge's ID number?Gregory:Yes. However, the number itself has no special meaning.Ray:I'd like to see a badge with matching numbers.Gregory:(That... would be a rare sight indeed.)Ray:Mr. Edgeworth. This request sure was sudden, don't you think?Gregory:Indeed. We were contacted immediately after the client was arrested.Gregory:My name is Gregory Edgeworth. I am a defense attorney. I brought my assistant, Raymond, with me to meet our client, but...Ray:A murder on Christmas Eve! This is just too much!???:\u266a Ahh... In the darkneeeess...

Welcome one and all... I greatly appreciate you coming.Gregory:So you're the client for this case...????:Indeed.Gregory:My name is Gregory Edgeworth. I'm a defense attorney. I will be representing you in court. This is my assistant, Raymond Shields.Ray:N-Nice to meet you! I... um...! I'll do my best to help you!Gregory:Relax, Raymond. ...Please excuse his jitters. He's working part time at my office as an apprentice. I thought I'd let him assist me in this investigation.???:So, Mr. Gregory and Raymond, correct? I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.Gregory:(My job involves saving my clients from crimes in which they were falsely accused. First, I should determine if he is truly innocent.) First, I would like to know more about you.???:Ah, I have forgotten to introduce myself. My name is Jeffrey Master.Ray:What!?

I'm so happy that I got to sing with Master Jeff! It's my dream come true!Master:Ho ho... Thank you. I am happy to hear that as well.Gregory:...Mr. Master. Raymond. Shall we return to the matter at hand?Master:Yes, of course. My sincerest apologies for making you wait. Now, where should we start?Jeff MasterGregory:You are the world's greatest pastry chef, but you are also skilled in song and dance?Master:Yes! When I'm having a good time, my body just moves to the rhythm by itself.Gregory:You seem to enjoy making desserts from the bottom of your heart.Master:Ho ho... If you don't have a good time making desserts, you won't make anything good. Creating desserts that bring happiness to one and all is my purpose in life.Ray:Master Jeff's desserts are practically works of art! They sparkle and look so delicious... He's so famous for his dreamlike desserts!Gregory:(Bringing happiness to all with his dreamlike desserts, huh?)About the caseGregory:The incident occurred in your estate, is that correct?Master:Yes... That's where the \"Great Dessert Contest\" was being held... It seems that the body was discovered in one of my creations.Ray:They found it in one of your desserts!?Master:For that reason, I was arrested by the detective in charge of the initial investigation. ...I would never do something as vile as robbing someone of their life. I am certain that the police will also realize that they have made a mistake.Ray:R-Really...?Gregory:Hmm... Do you know anything about the victim?Master:He was a man named... Isaac Dover. He was one of the competitors in the contest. He was a wonderful man who made desserts of the highest beauty. Why did he have to die...?Gregory:...I see. (He truly seems to be grieving over the victim's death...)PresentAttorney's BadgeMaster:Thank you very much for accepting my request to serve as my defense attorney.Gregory:...The scale engraved on this badge represents \"truth\" and \"fairness\". As long as you are innocent, I will see to it that you receive a fair verdict. So please, entrust your faith to me and wait patiently.Master:Yes...! Thank you for your assistance.(Clearing all \"Talk\" options leads to:)Gregory:(...I believe I have a sufficient understanding of Mr. Master's personality.) Mr. Master, before I accept your request, there is one final matter I must confirm. You did not kill Mr. Dover. ...Can I take your word for it?Master:Yes. That is correct. I did not kill him. No matter what happens, I would never take another person's life.Gregory:..... (Those aren't the eyes of a liar.) I understand. I believe you. Thank you very much for taking the time to talk with us.Master:The pleasure is all mine. I am grateful to speak with someone other than a detective.Gregory:Next, we shall begin our investigation of the crime scene. ...We will report back with our findings once we have finished.Master:Mr. Gregory, Raymond. I wish you good luck.December 24, 6:00 PMContest VenueFountain PatioRay:Whew, it sure is cold outside. I didn't expect it to be snowing this hard.Gregory:Indeed. A blizzard like this will probably not clear up for a while.Ray:But even so, this mansion is ginormous! So this is what Master Jeff's place is like, huh?Gregory:If you're going to hold a contest in your own home, you would need this much space, after all.???:\u266c La, la, laaa~ Welcome! Thank you for coming! Eek! Oh my! Are you okay? I-I'm so very sorry! Would you happen to be Monsieur Edgeworth?Gregory:Yes, I am Gregory Edgeworth.Ray:And I'm his assistant, Raymond Shields!Kate:Greetings and welcome, Monsieur Edgeworth and Monsieur Shields. Please call me Katherine Hall! I am in charge of the household affairs of this estate, and am also Monsieur Master's assistant.Ray:Ahhh! No way!

Pardon my inconsideration! I've forgotten to take care of our guests! Please relax and have some tea....*clatter, clatter*...Gregory:Oh... This is some fine Ceylon tea... I hear the aroma of citrus does wonders for your concentration.Ray:I see... So this is what Ceylon tea smells like.Gregory:Oh? These saucers are chilled.Kate:Yes. They help cool the tea more quickly for people who are bad with hot beverages.Gregory:I see... These tea cups also have a wonderful design.Kate:Oh, thank you very much! They are one of the few pride and joys of our estate, ordered directly from France! They were made by the famed sculptor Pierre Hoquet. They are my absolute favorite articles of tableware.Gregory:...You seem to greatly appreciate this man's works.Kate:Yes! They are like treasures to me.Gregory:(She appears to be very honest about what she likes.) Thank you, Ms. Hall, but it's time for us to move on to business. Are there any details that you can give us about the incident?Kate:Ah... You're right. I sometimes get so distracted welcoming guests that I forget myself. To tell the truth, I was the one who discovered Monsieur Dover's body.Gregory:So you were the first one to discover the body? It is true that the body was discovered in one of Mr. Master's desserts?Kate:Yes... It was during the judging of the Great Dessert Contest. I heard the sound of something breaking from Monsieur Master's room.Kate:...Monsieur Master? Are you in here? Eek...!Kate:When I looked inside the room, I saw Monsieur Dover's body inside the treasure chest...Gregory:...Thank you very much. I'm sorry to have made you recall such painful memories.Kate:No... I should be the one apologizing for not being much help.Gregory:Now then, I believe it's time for us to start investigating the crime scene.Kate:Monsieur Edgeworth, Monsieur Shields. Please find some way to save Monsieur Master. Monsieur Master is not someone who could commit murder!Gregory:...Yes. Of course.Ray:Just leave it to us!Kate:Then I shall entrust it to you. If you'll excuse me, I have to continue serving tea to the other inspectors.Gregory:Raymond, let's head to the crime scene.Ray:Yes, sir! Mr. Edgeworth!December 24, 6:30 PMContest VenueMaster's RoomRay:Wow! This whole thing is made of chocolate! I can't believe I'm actually seeing Master Jeff's desserts up close!Gregory:Were this not the scene of a murder, I admit, I too would have delighted in this occasion.Ray:Uuugh... Now that you've reminded me it's a murder scene, I'm getting shivers down my spine.Gregory:...Perhaps it's because this room is cold to begin with?Ray:Now that you mention it, this room really is cold. *A-ACHOO*???:...Never expected the defense attorney to show up so early.Gregory:Pleased to meet you. I'm Jeff Master's defense attorney, Gregory Edgeworth. This is my assistant, Raymond.Ray:How do you do!Badd:...Detective Tyrell Badd. Homicide.Ray:Mr. Badd, the detective in charge of this case... A man of few words... Mmm... Tastes kinda bitter...Badd:He ate... the paper...!Gregory:He likes to digest his memos in his stomach as well as in his mind... It's just a strange habit of his. Please don't be too concerned. (It would probably be too much to ask him not to be concerned at all...) More importantly... Detective Badd. Will you give us permission to participate in the investigation?Badd:...Permission denied.Ray:Wh-Why!? Mr. Edgeworth is Master Jeff's defense attorney!Badd:Defense attorneys... plant false evidence... to try and get their \"Not Guilty\" verdict. I don't want... their kind to disturb the crime scene...Ray:Mr. Edgeworth would never use false evidence to defend his client!Badd:Heh... I can't trust that, coming from a defense attorney...Gregory:Do the police still suspect Mr. Master, even after the investigation?Badd:.....If we didn't, we wouldn't have arrested him...Gregory:I believe that Mr. Master is innocent. That's why I have come to investigate.Badd:Believing in his innocence... without investigating the crime scene... How na\u00efve...Gregory:...That's why I would like your permission to investigate. By investigating the crime scene, I want to ascertain if my thinking was na\u00efve or not.Badd:...Hmph. ...So you don't intend to leave until you've investigated the crime scene...?Gregory:Yes.Badd:...Tch... Fine then... I will give you permission to investigate the crime scene.Gregory:! Thank you.Badd:But, I'll be accompanying you. ...I can't trust you defense attorneys, after all! ...If you understand that, you... can begin your investigation.Ray:That's... a lollipop?Gregory:(...I'm a little surprised myself.) Alright, let's begin the investigation. Raymond, be sure to take notes on the case.Ray:Leave it to me, Mr. Edgeworth!Badd:Just... begin already...Begin InvestigationContest VenueMaster's RoomLogic\"Breaking sound\" and \"Broken stand\"Gregory:Due to the broken stand, the ship lost its balance... It would seem Ms. Hall entered the room upon hearing the ship collapse.Badd:Yeah... When Ms. Hall entered the room, the ship had already fallen over...Gregory:At any rate, I wonder why the stand broke (Why the stand broke? - The ship fell over because the stand broke. Why did it break?)?Badd:...Maybe there was something wrong with the ship's balance in the first place...Gregory:(Is that really true...?)\"Why the stand broke?\" and \"Tampered desserts\"Gregory:Each of Mr. Master's works had a piece that was missing. Add to that the fact that the ship's chocolate stand was broken... I think we can surmise that someone ransacked this room.Ray:And, the one who did it could be the true culprit!Gregory:...That I don't know. But I think it's safe to say that the ship stand got broken when the room was ransacked. (And, when the ship fell over it broke the treasure chest lid... I expect that the lid of the treasure chest was originally closed.)PartnerBadd:...What?Notice anything?Badd:Your way of investigating is... to soft. An investigation is like a popsicle... Walk around the crime scene... and investigate. ...Talk with... the people involved. If you do that... little by little, you'll lick it down to its core... And the truth will be written... on the end of the popsicle stick.Gregory:...I pray that it doesn't say, \"The truth was lost for all eternity.\"The crime scene (after examining outline and broken stand)Gregory:Is it safe to assume that the state of the crime scene has been preserved?Badd:Crime scene preservation... Is the most important rule of an investigation. The body has been recovered, but... besides that... it's been left untouched...Gregory:If possible, could you tell me about the condition of the body in more detail?Badd:Ms. Hall... took a photo of it. ...Be content with that, defense attorney.Gregory:(Does this detective have a grudge against defense attorneys? I guess I have no choice but to investigate the contradictions of the crime scene myself...)PresentAttorney's BadgeBadd:...Working with defense attorneys... isn't worth it... They go through the crime scene as they please... and interpret their findings to their favor.Gregory:Do you also feel that way about me?Badd:...Hmm.Gregory:(...He didn't confirm or deny it.)Signet CrestBadd:...It's a strange seal. If this were a stamp, it would imprint \"PH\"...Gregory:Perhaps it's meant to be seen as it is. In that case, it would read \"H9\"...Badd:Hits... Nine hits... An explosive batter... No, that's not it...Gregory:(Does Detective Badd like baseball...?)Crime Scene NotesBadd:There are several... puzzling points... in this case...Gregory:I would like a little more information on the state of the crime scene.Badd:You have... your own two feet. Why don't you go investigate yourself... That's how... a detective does things...Gregory:We may be in different positions, but we both want to know the truth of this case. Wouldn't it be better if you cooperated a bit more?Badd:.....Gregory:(He's fallen silent as a stone. A rather large stone. ...Is that also how a detective does things?)Frame FingermarksBadd:It seems the culprit... prepared gloves in advance... That's why only fingermarks... and no fingerprints were left behind...Gregory:Could you get any information from the size of the fingers?Badd:...That would be difficult. In other words... this evidence is meaningless.Gregory:It's a bit early to decide that. This could also become a clue. It tells us, the culprit \"did not leave fingerprints.\"Badd:Hmph... You always have a comeback. It's because you're a defense attorney...Gregory:Heh... I'll take that as a compliment.Anything elseGregory:I would like to ask your opinion about this piece of evidence.Badd:...I refuse... I hate... pointless chatter...Gregory:(I guess he's not interested in things that he doesn't think are related to the case.)Sitting forensicsGregory:What are you investigating?Forensics:Sir! I'm checking the temperature of the stream!Badd:...What have you learned?Forensics:Sir! This stream... has warm water! The stream is connected to the fountain in the patio, and runs through every room.Gregory:It's an unusual construction for a room.Badd:The minds of the rich... I'll never understand.ForensicsBadd:...What about over here? Was there nothing suspicious in the cupboard?Forensics:No, sir!Badd:...So there was something?Forensics:Oh, uh... No. Only things like cooking burners and tableware were placed here!Badd:...I see. Defense attorney, was there nothing that you noticed?Gregory:No.Badd:...So you did notice something?Gregory:Oh, no... I didn't notice anything.Badd:...Everyone's always giving replies that are difficult to understand...Gregory:(I think it's your way of asking that's bad...)Sailing equipmentsGregory:It appears to be a display of sailing equipment.Badd:There's also the possibility... that one of these is the murder weapon...Gregory:No... It looks like these pieces were all made out of chocolate. You can't beat someone to death with these.Badd:Tch...! Misleading...Gregory:(At any rate, they all have such good workmanship that they look just like the real thing. It really speaks about the level of skill Mr. Master has in his craft.)ShipGregory:So this was where the body was discovered?Badd:Yeah... The body has been removed... but otherwise... the crime scene has remained untouched.Before deducingGregory:(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)After deducingGregory:(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)ShipGregory:To build such a large ship out of chocolate is magnificent.Ray:As expected of Master Jeff! I want to try eating it... Although I have no idea where to start eating it from...Badd:Anywhere should be fine, but if you start eating the crime scene... I'll make you leave...Ray:Uwaah! Don't glare at me! Can't you tell it was a joke?Gregory:(...I'd like Raymond to be just a little bit calmer.)OutlineGregory:It seems that the body was discovered inside this chocolate treasure chest.Badd:...The person who discovered it was Ms. Hall...Kate:...Monsieur Master? Are you in here? Eek...!Badd:She heard the sound of something breaking (Breaking sound - What was the sound that came from Mr. Master's room?)... inside this room... and came in.Gregory:(...I would like a little more information about this.) Hm. What's this? Something has been dropped inside the treasure chest. Hm. This is...? It seems to be some kind of seal, with a design and initials carved into it.Ray:It looks like a signet crest. Was it the victim's?Badd:...I don't know if it was the victim's, but we should take it for now...Signet Crest added to the Court Record.Broken standGregory:It seems that the stand supporting the ship has been broken (Broken stand - The stand that supported the ship was broken and caused the ship to tip over.).Ray:The ship tipped over and broke the treasure chest, didn't it? Ah! M-Maybe! Could the victim have been crushed by the ship and killed?Gregory:...If that were the case, this would have been an accidental death.Badd:...You two... aren't serious about that, right?Gregory:Well. We were only discussing one of the possibilities.Ray:...I was being pretty serious though.SignGregory:\"The Voyage of the Good Ship Red Rum\" is written here...Badd:\"It sailed... the Seven Seas and in the end finally found... a huge treasure. Modeled after... the glory of an ancient adventurer.\" ...It's written here...Gregory:So he failed six times... What an unlucky captain.Badd:...No matter how many times he went on a fool's errand... In the end he reached the truth... ...It's just like... a detective's spirit...!Gregory:(Did detectives even exist... during the ancient times?)(Examining outline and broken stand leads to:)Gregory:Detective Badd. I would like you to tell me about the state of the victim.Badd:If you mean a photo of the body... Here. Look at it... all you like. It seems the victim... was beaten to death (Beaten to death - The victim appears to have been beaten to death with a blunt object.) with a blunt object.Gregory:Has the murder weapon been found?Badd:...You... should try asking the prosecutor in charge later...Gregory:(...It seems he doesn't intend to tell me frankly.) So... May I borrow this photograph?Badd:Sure... It's not a photo that was taken by the police... Ms. Hall took a photo of the body with an instant camera when she discovered it.Ray:An instant camera... Is that like a disposable camera?Gregory:An instant camera is a camera that can develop its film right after taking a picture.Ray:Eh! Such a convenient camera exists!?Gregory:(Anyway, let's go over the state of the crime scene a bit. This photo... upon closer examination, contradicts the state of the crime scene. I'll have to deduce the contradiction to resolve this matter.)Crime Scene Notes added to the Court Record.DeduceGregory:(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)Deduce missing chocolate piece on the bottom of the chest and present Crime Scene NotesGregory:Leads to:\"Are you sure the only thing the police removed from the crime scene was the body?\"OtherwiseGregory:Gregory:This part is contradictory... It contradicts this piece of evidence!Badd:This ship is \"confectionery\"... How sweet. Otherwise... we could board the ship... and sail down the chocolate river.Gregory:(What an unpleasant dismissal... Let's calm down, and inspect the crime scene once more. It feels like something that was here before isn't anymore...)Gregory:Are you sure the only thing the police removed from the crime scene was the body?Badd:Ah... They also took away the piece of cloth the body was wrapped in.Gregory:In that case, a major \"contradiction\" has been created at the crime scene.Badd:Contradiction...?Gregory:Detective Badd. Please look at the crime scene carefully once more. The bloodstain that should have remained at the crime scene has disappeared!Badd:...! I definitely... didn't get any reports about the bloodstain being cleaned up... I'll check... with forensics.Ray:Mr. Edgeworth. What happened?Gregory:Comparing the photo and the crime scene, something struck me as being out of place. In the photo, the chocolate underneath the body remained intact inside the treasure chest. ...however, in the actual crime scene, it's missing.Ray:! The chocolate with the bloodstain has completely vanished.Gregory:Yes. Did the police remove it, or was this the work of the criminal...?Badd:According to forensics... no one has cleaned upo any bloodstains...Gregory:...I see. Well, that would mean someone erased the bloodstain.Badd:...Who knows...Crime Scene Notes updated in the Court Record.Raymond ShieldsRay:This is an actual crime scene! I'm so excited!Gregory:This isn't a game, Raymond. Please be more serious.Ray:Yes, sir! I'm taking a memo right now!Gregory:Oh... What exactly are you writing?Ray:I'm copying down this dessert recipe over here!Gregory:...Raymond. Please be more serious.Ray:Yes, sir...Red chefGregory:Excuse me, but you are...????:..... Nnph. My apologies. I was meditating. What did you ask, Sir Detective?Gregory:Actually, I'm a defense attorney. My name is Gregory Edgeworth.Ray:I'm his assistant, Raymond!Gustavia:Pardon my late introduction. My name is Dane Gustavia. I am one of the pastry chefs participating in this contest.Ray:What kind of desserts do you make, Mr. Gustavia?Gustavia:...My specialty is making desserts out of candy.Ray:Awww! What a cute seahorse!Gustavia:It was meant to be a \"dragon\" dancing in the sky...Ray:Eh! Th-This is a \"dragon\"...?Gregory:(I think it would fit better in the ocean than in the sky...)Gustavia:I know all too well that design is my weak point! ...I plan to study design and undergo training in Zheng Fa once things settle down here.Gregory:(I probably shouldn't touch the subject of design any further.) Mr. Gustavia, if you aren't related to the investigation, why are you in this room...?Gustavia:Sir Detective wanted to know more about the desserts in this room, so he asked me to come.Gregory:(Since he's one of the contestants, he might know something...)Dane GustaviaGregory:Mr. Gustavia, those instruments you use are quite unusual.Gustavia:These instruments are called \"candy pumps\", and they pump air into the candy.Ray:They kinda look like swords. They're so cool!Gustavia:Indeed. Ever since I began using them, no day has gone by where I didn't receive a burn or wound! That's why I wear red clothes! So that not a single stain will ever show on me! Making desserts is serious business... I am always training!Gregory:(...Does he injure himself because he hasn't trained enough?)The contestGregory:Can you tell me about the Great Dessert Contest that was held here? From the looks of this room, it seems the desserts weren't just for eating.Gustavia:The exhibition Sir Master held was a \"contest in the art of dessert.\"Ray:The art of... dessert?Gustavia:\"Desserts that are true works of art,\" made solely out of edible materials! The works of art in this room are all made from desserts.Ray:Now that you mention it, the whole room is filled with the smell of chocolate.Gustavia:Sir Master exhibits great talent in both flavor and design. If you are not able to surpass Sir Master in flavor and design, you will not be able to win.Ray:Beating the world's greatest pastry chef is pretty hard, isn't it...?Gustavia:...In other words, if I can surpass Sir Master, I shall become the world's greatest pastry chef. That was the prize of this contest!Gregory:The prize is the \"Title of the World's Greatest\"...?Gustavia:In addition to that, there is also Sir Master's treasured \"Angel's Recipe\". If you want to learn more about the contest, just look at this piece of paper. These were the rules that were given to the participants of the contest.Contest Rules added to the Court Record.About the caseGregory:Is it safe to assume that the state of the crime scene has been preserved?Gustavia:Sorry, but I do not know much about the incident. I only learned about the incident after the judging had finished.Gregory:How was the contest judging carried out?Gustavia:Let's see... Sir Master started judging at 3 PM. Starting from my room, the judging proceeded in a clockwise direction. I used the room to the right of Sir Master's room, which is the room we're in now. Next, the room of a female pastry chef named Delicia was judged.Gregory:A female pastry chef... What kind of person is she?Gustavia:...She is a frightening woman who would do anything to achieve her goal. I heard she used lots of cream to make a fantasy-themed dessert. ...And lastly, Sir Dover's room was judged. His works were frozen statues made from sherbet.Badd:Hall discovered the body... in the middle of... Gustavia's judging. She panicked... and because she immediately notified the police... Master... continued judging... without knowledge that the body has been discovered. As a result, Master... judged Dover's room... in Dover's absence. Hmph... It seems we have plenty of room to suspect Master...Gregory:(...I'm lacking in information. It's probably too early to object.)PresentAttorney's BadgeGustavia:...That badge has a rather artistic design. My craftman's spirit is shaking! Mind if I borrow it for a while?Gregory:S-Sorry... This is rather important to me. (It would be unbearable if it got hurt in the candy making process...)Contest RulesGustavia:The title of \"World's Greatest Pastry Chef\"... I intend to achieve it through this contest. Afterwards, if I am able to master my design training in Zheng Fa... I shall be recognized as a first-class pastry chef in both cooking and design!Gregory:(...I would think the order would be reversed.)Anything elseGustavia:.....Nnph. My apologies. I was meditating. What did you ask, Sir Detective?Gregory:I'm a defense attorney. And about this piece of evidence...Gustavia:.....Gregory:(M-Meditating again...? I guess if it doesn't catch his interest greatly, he won't even give it a glance.)(Clearing all \"Talk\" options leads to:)Gregory:By the way, Detective Badd. What were you talking to Mr. Gustavia earlier?Badd:I was asking him about... the chocolate frame hanging on that wall... I thought... something was missing... I thought... if I asked someone who knew a lot about desserts... I could get an answer. ...Although thanks to your arrival, I still haven't gotten my answer yet...Gregory:Well then, since you've been waiting for so long, we can ask him about it, right now.Badd:...I guess you don't understand sarcasm...Gregory:Mr. Gustavia, can you assist us with this matter?Gustavia:I train in the arts of desserts everyday. If you have a question about desserts, please do not hesitate to ask.Gregory:Thank you very much.Frame (after clearing all \"Talk\" options of Gustavia)Before examining frame and handprintGregory:(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)After examining frame and handprintGregory:(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)FrameRay:You can make such a beautiful picture out of chocolate!? As expected of Master Jeff!Gregory:...Is this really chocolate? It looks like an actual picture to me.Gustavia:Impressive, Sir Attorney! You noticed well. This picture of an angel is not a dessert, but rather the \"Angel's Recipe\".Gregory:The \"Angel's Recipe\"... The prize for the contest.Ray:Ehh!? This picture isn't made of chocolate!?Gustavia:Indeed. Within this chocolate frame lies a recipe book. Sir Master told everyone when he explained the rules of the contest to us in this room.Gregory:(So the contestants knew the recipe was here.)Badd:How about it...? This frame... Don't you think it's missing something...?Gregory:(This must be what Detective Badd was asking Mr. Gustavia about earlier.) This chocolate frame, there does seem to be a part that's missing.Badd:That's... what's been bothering me as well...Ray:Eh? ...What's missing?Gregory:(Let me show Raymond the part of the chocolate frame that's missing.)Present missing chocolate leafGregory:Leads to:\"Look closely at this part with the decorations. Can you see that one of them is missing?\"Present anything elseGregory:Gregory:Raymond. Don't you think there is something missing here?Ray:...Sorry. I don't know much about art. I thought this was one of those \"artistic expressions\" though.Gregory:(...My glasses slipped, and I pointed to the wrong spot.)Ray:Um... There's something missing from the chocolate frame, right?Gregory:That's right. Even if you don't know the first thing about art, you should understand this.Leads back to:\"(Let me show Raymond the part of the chocolate frame that's missing.)\"Gregory:Look closely at this part with the decorations. Can you see that one of them is missing?Ray:It's true! It's different from the other decorations.Gustavia:Hm... This imperfect balance in the decorations is not like Sir Master.Badd:...Upon closer examination, it seems this frame is not the only one with missing parts. ...We need to investigate further.Badd:All the desserts in this room each have one part missing...Ray:Whoa... The candle holder and the sailing tools are all damaged as well! So someone tampered with the crime scene (Tampered desserts - The desserts Mr. Master made were damaged in several places.)?Gregory:...Perhaps.Badd:Maybe... Master vandalized the room himself to fool us...Ray:Master Jeff wouldn't do that sort of thing to his desserts!Gregory:(Tampered desserts... I wonder if they are connected to the incident?)Frame (subsequent times)Gustavia:This picture of an angel is not a dessert, but rather the \"Angel's Recipe\".Gregory:The \"Angel's Recipe\"... The prize for the contest.Gustavia:Indeed. Within this chocolate frame lies a recipe book. Sir Master told everyone when he explained the rules of the contest to us in this room.Gregory:(So the contestants knew the recipe was here.)HandprintGregory:...These fingermarks are?Badd:These are... unidentified fingermarks. ...We don't know who they belong to. Since... no fingerprints were left behind...Gregory:(Fingermarks without fingerprints... These might be related to the case.)Frame Fingermarks added to the Court Record.Ray:Hmmm. It's a mystery!Badd:He was probably wearing gloves...Ray:Ugh... Detective Badd lacks dreams and romance.Gregory:(I don't think there are dreams or romance at a murder scene...)Sign on frameGregory:It seems the title of this work is written here.Ray:\"Angel Caught by Thorns\"... It's an enchanting dessert, isn't it! It feels like my heart has also been caught...!Gustavia:Quite...! It seems Sir Assistant has a sense of beauty. Speaking of which, I too have had my heart caught by this dessert.Ray:Mr. Edgeworth! Mr. Gustavia praised me!Gregory:Raymond... That's not the sort of thing you'd want to blow your own \"thorn\" about.Gustavia:Hmph...! Sir Defense Attorney, it seems your sense of words is lacking.Ray:Mr. Edgeworth made a joke! I'd better make a memo about this!Gregory:(...Exactly which part of what I said was a joke?)BookBadd:The Captain's log... of a chocolate ship... which is also made out of chocolate... It seems its title is... \"Journal of Regret\"...Gregory:\"Running out of rum while drifting at the Red Sea has really made me red with regret...\" it reads. I don't know what kind of voyage it was, but it doesn't seem very regretful.Candle holderBadd:A dessert... in the shape of a candle holder... huh... It's titled... \"Light of Life\"...Gregory:(It seems that... one of these important lights isn't lit. Is it symbolic, or...?)Fire alarmGregory:This is a fire alarm.Badd:Ah... Let me say in advance... That's not a dessert... It's the real deal. If you press that... an alarm will sound, and security will be contacted... I understand that you want to press it to see what happens... but please refrain yourself...Gregory:No, I didn't particularly feel like pressing it.Badd:...Tch! It's because you're a defense attorney...Gregory:(I don't think being a defense attorney has anything to do with it...)(Examining frame and handprint leads to:)Ray:A... A... Achoo!Gregory:Are you alright, Raymond?Ray:Ugh... This room is way too cold!Gregory:The Fountain Patio wasn't very warm, either... This room certainly is cold. Do you want to wear my coat?Ray:Nope! I'm fine! Because that's something that you promised to give me when I become a defense attorney!Gregory:Heh... That's right.Badd:...Why is the temperature turned down so low...?Gustavia:It's been turned down in order to maintain the chocolate's temperature. ...Why don't you try opening the panel cover on that wall?Badd:Panel cover...?Ray:Whoa! There's a secret panel hidden there!Gustavia:This control panel is installed in all the rooms Sir Master prepared. So as not to detract from the dessert's presentation, the cover was closed to conceal it.Gregory:What does the panel do?Gustavia:It allows you to change the temperature and the lighting in the room. In order to preserve any type of dessert, it can go down to about -22\u2109.Gregory:...The room would be like a freezer.Ray:It's set to 59\u2109! No wonder I thought it was cold. Detective Badd. I'm not allowed to change the temperature... Am I?Badd:Preserving the crime scene... is the foundation of being a detective...!Ray:But, I'm not a detective...Gregory:A defense attorney can't recklessly damage a crime scene either.Gustavia:Indeed, Sir Assistant. Enduring hardship is also a part of training. In order to preserve chocolate, 59\u2109 to 64\u2109 is the ideal temperature.Badd:Hm... The ideal temperature for chocolate. As expected of the dessert chef...Gustavia:No, it is but a trifle. This is basic knowledge that anyone should know if they're a dessert chef.Badd:...So, what's the ideal temperature for candy and fresh cream?Gustavia:As long as you watch out for humidity and hot temperatures, candy shouldn't melt. For fresh cream, around 50\u2109 is the ideal temperature.Badd:...You need to watch out for the humidity and hot temperatures for candy... I see...Ray:Detective Badd. He seemed a bit happy when they were talking about candy.Gregory:(Is candy one of his favorite things...?)Control panelGregory:It seems this control panel can change the temperature and the color of the lights in this room.Ray:The colors are red, yellow, green, blue, cyan, and white... That sure is a lot.Badd:This room's temperature is 59\u2109... And the lights are set to white.Gustavia:It's because the works in this room are made of chocolate. By using white light, the chocolate can stand out.Gregory:(For Mr. Master, everything in this room is probably a piece of art.)CounterGregory:Elegant tableware and cookware are placed on the counter. It looks like the same tea set Ms. Hall was using earlier.Ray:Was Master Jeff drinking this black tea?Badd:On this tea set... only Jeff Master's fingerprints were found.Gregory:Were his fingerprints found on any of the other cookware?Badd:The cookware was washed... Nobody's fingerprints... remained.Gregory:(Or he might have been cooking with gloves on... It seems the only thing here with his fingerprints is the tea set.)Jeff's Teapot added to the Court Record.GlovesBadd:Master... used these gloves while making his desserts... They hid his fingerprints...Gregory:Certainly, it's possible that they were used for that purpose... But wouldn't you agree that finding cooking gloves in the kitchen is perfectly natural?Badd:Doubt everything... That's my job...Examine evidenceVessel of Jeff's TeapotGregory:Hm... This is a rather splendid design.Ray:...You think so? It seems a little eccentric to me... I'm not even sure how you'd pour tea out of it.Gregory:Rather than the practicality of the design, focus on its artistic merits.Ray:Hmm. Mr. Edgeworth's art sense is too high for me to understand!Bottom side of Jeff's TeapotRay:There's an engraving on the bottom! It says \"PH\".Gregory:It's the initials of the creator, \"Pierre Hoquet\". Ms. Hall and Mr. Master seem to be big fans of this sculptor's works.Ray:Initials, huh... If it were mine, it'd be \"RS\"!Gregory:...Why don't you try carving your initials on your own belongings?(Connecting all possible Logic, examining handprint and counter, talking to sitting forensics, and deducing missing chocolate piece leads to:)Investigation CompleteGregory:It seems our investigation of this room is just about over.Crime Scene Notes updated in the Court Record.Badd:This should make it clear... Jeff Master is the culprit.Ray:! Wh-Why!?Badd:All the rooms in this mansion... were locked from the inside. And... the only way to open them from the outside, was to use this key to the mansion...Gregory:...Do you know who had the key?Badd:Master... was the only one with the key. ...There were no spare keys.Mansion Key added to the Court Record.Badd:By using the mansion key... Master... could enter all the contestants' rooms. Of course... the key could also lock his room from the outside...Gregory:However, Mr. Master's room is currently unlocked.Badd:Yeah... That's why I suspect Master is the culprit...Gregory:...I'd like to hear your reasoning in more detail.-- Why I Suspect Jeff Master --Badd:If the body had been found in a locked room... Master would've been the prime suspect.That's why Master made sure to leave the door to his own room unlocked...And to ensure that the body would be seen... Master broke the lid on the treasure chest.After the judging... everyone was scheduled to meet in Master's room...That would have created the impression... that the murder had occurred... while he was away.Badd:Contrary to his expectations... the body was discovered by Ms. Hall... ...That's my reason for suspecting Master. Got that, Ace Attorney?Gregory:...So you also think it was Mr. Master himself who vandalized this room?Badd:Yeah... You defense attorneys believe that justice lies in trusting your clients... But I'm a detective. If I believed every poor sap's story... I'd let the suspicious ones get away...Gregory:...I understand your reasoning thoroughly. However... I'd like you to hear my thoughts on the subjects now.Badd:...Hmph. Fine.Gregory:(Detective Badd believes that he is right, but I won't give up so easily. I can't accept his reasoning... I'll have to show him evidence that contradicts it!)Gregory: Gregory: Isn't it a little premature to suspect Mr. Master on those grounds alone? Badd: It's a little premature... for you to be objecting...! ...Just wait... until I'm done...Gregory: Gregory: He left it unlocked? Badd: If the door had been locked... Master would be the only one who could commit the crime... Ray: Well... maybe the door just happened to be unlocked? Badd: Then... maybe the body just happened to be lying in the open, waiting to be discovered... ...Runt... Do you think you can become a good detective with logic like that? Ray: Uugh... But, I don't wanna be a detective, I wanna be a defense attorney. Gregory: (...I hope he isn't trying to steal my apprentice.) Badd: Master had... a reason... to leave the door unlocked.Gregory: Gregory: You believe the broken lid was Mr. Master's doing? Badd: Yes... If he hadn't done that, the body... wouldn't have been found. Gregory: ...It doesn't seem likely that he would break his own work while he was judging the contest. Ray: That's right!

So perhaps there are other fingerprints on it, apart from Mr. Master's.Badd:...Hmph. No matter what we find, it won't clear Master of suspicion...Badd:.....Labbie! Hurry up and dust the chocolate for fingerprints!Forensics:Roger that, sir!Forensics:Detective Badd! We found another person's fingerprints... on all the chocolates in the room!Badd:.....!

Would you allow us to accompany you?Badd:...I'm not obligated to do that.Ray:What...!?Badd:But... you were the one who discovered the truth of the crime scene... Fine, have it your way.

Him and I... don't see eye to eye.Ray:\"Him\"...? Who's the prosecutor in charge of this case anyway?Badd:...Manfred von Karma...Ray:WHAAAAAA! Von Karma is in charge!? That guy hasn't lost a case in 25 years...Gregory:(Manfred von Karma... The \"living legend\" of the prosecutor's office...?

A candy castle! And there are even some fairies over there!Badd:This room... seems to be structured in the same way as Master's room...Ray:But it's nowhere near as cold!Badd:This room... also seems to have been fitted with a temperature control panel...Ray:Ah, it's over by that that orange lamp, right!?Gregory:Indeed. Let's not forget to investigate it later. (Even so... this room is like something out of a fairy tale. Is this cream-covered castle Delicia's work?)Badd:...Where is Delicia...?Delicia:Oi! Can I help you? Hullo boys! I'm Delicia Scones. In my native England, I'm known as \"Ms. Delicious\"!Gregory:(Being called a \"boy\" even though I'm already 34... It's certainly a rare experience.)Ray:B-Boys? I understand you calling me that, but... Mr. Edgeworth!?Delicia:As far as I'm concerned, you're all boys to me, even that detective over there.Badd:...My name is... Badd. Not \"boy\"...Gregory:(Just how old is this woman?)Badd:...Mr. Attorney. Let's just finish our business here.Gregory:Hmm... Right.???:???:You! What do you think you're doing!? Conversing with a mere attorney!?Ray:Mr. Edgeworth! A-A scary man came out of the candy castle...!Badd:...Von Karma...Ray:Eh! This man is, Prosecutor von Karma...?Delicia:Eep! Manny!Gregory:(So he's Von Karma...) Pleased to meet you, Prosecutor von Karma. My name is Gregory Edgeworth, defense attorney.von Karma:Bah! I have no interest in the names of defense attorneys. After all, they only exist to be crushed by me.Gregory:(...What a rude man.)Ray:That piercing gaze and furrowed brow...! Uugh... He's even scarier than the rumors say.Gregory:(Although that statement was also very rude.) Prosecutor von Karma. Would you allow us to investigate too?von Karma:Hmph. You think I would give information to a mere defense attorney?Gregory:(As I thought, it won't be that simple...)von Karma:..... ...However, I'll make a special exception for this room.Gregory:! (Why did he change his mind so quickly?)von Karma:You, old bloodhound.Badd:...Don't call me that. ...My name is... Badd.von Karma:Hah! A mere detective, speaking back to me. ...I admire your courage at least. Badd. Stand watch and see to it that they don't misbehave.Badd:Why... me...!von Karma:I will not accept your refusal. Well then, I'll be investigating Gustavia's room next.Badd:Tch... I'm babysitting again...Gregory:(I wonder why he and Von Karma aren't investigating together? Instead of being on bad terms, it seems like they hardly know each other...)Ray:Mr. Edgeworth, now that we've got Von Karma's permission, we can continue investigating!Gregory:Yes. His manner bothers me, but I am glad we can at least continue the investigation.Badd:...Hold it. I also need to investigate this room... I don't want you disturbing the room... So you'll investigate... after me.Ray:What!? Aren't you the detective in charge of this case? Why haven't you investigated this room yet?Badd:...The detective in charge of the initial investigation was a close colleague of Von Karma. I came to take over for him, so I only got to this mansion just recently.Gregory:(So that's why he and Von Karma aren't investigating together...) Detective Badd. Will you allow us to investigate with you like before? In doing so, you'll be able to supervise us and also ensure we don't tamper with anything.Badd:You want me to watch you? ...You're a strange lawyer. ...Hmph. I'll let you stick around... a little longer.Ray:Yay! You did it, Mr. Edgeworth!Gregory:Thank you, Detective Badd.Badd:...But if I decide you're holding up the investigation, you'll have to leave...Gregory:Yes... I understand. Well then, let's begin the investigation.Begin InvestigationContest VenueDelicia's RoomLogic\"Hexagonal recess\" and \"Pedestal of rock\"Gregory:The rock's pedestal has a similar shape to the recesses on the castle's pillars. Perhaps the rock is meant to be placed on top of the pillars?Ray:Oh, that's right! They're both hexagonal.Gregory:(I wonder why they were hidden inside the castle, though?)\"Fragile desserts\" and \"High room temperature\"Gregory:The reason the fresh cream is so fragile is due to the temperature in this room.Badd:So my shoes got creamed... because the room temperature is set at 68\u2109...Gregory:Speaking of which... When you opened the castle door, the doorknob didn't break.Badd:Yeah... it was stronger than I thought...Gregory:Strong? ...A dessert? Detective Badd. Could you have a closer look at that doorknob?Badd:.....? ...This is...!Gregory:It would seem this doorknob isn't a dessert.Badd:...And it's not just the doorknob. This castle and the fairies... Are just plastic molds coated in fresh cream.Ray:Eeh! Then, this isn't a dessert piece at all...!Gregory:It would seem they're just fake desserts (Fake desserts - Delicia made fake desserts. What are her true intentions...?) covered in fresh cream...PartnerBadd:...What?Notice anything?Badd:This room... has the same design as Master's room...Gregory:Is something bothering you?Badd:Von Karma ...was investigating ...inside the candy castle... ...I wonder... why...Gregory:Detective Badd, do you suspect Delicia?Badd:That woman... is hiding something. ...My detective's spirit... is telling me so...Gregory:(Is that his detective's intuition? Something about this room definitely troubles me as well. I should listen to what Delicia has to say...)CounterGregory:There's a burner and some chemicals over here. They were probably used to make desserts. What are these chemicals? The writing on the labels say... \"No. 1: Punchout!\"... and \"No. 9: Sufferin\"...!Badd:Are... they... poisons?Forensics:No, they are both used to make desserts. Seems to be artificial flavoring and coloring. \"Punchout!\" is a catchy name for a fruit punch essence.Badd:Tch... Very misleading...!Gregory:(What bothers me is what \"Sufferin\" stands for...)ForensicsForensics:Don't turn around, don't turn around... If you do, you're only gonna eat that castle!Gregory:(...This forensics officer seems to be on a diet.)Control panelGregory:There's a cover on the wall, just like in Mr. Master's room.Badd:...Let's open it up...Ray:Hmm. The room temperature is 68\u2109, and the lights are set to green...Badd:Gustavia said... that 50\u2109 is the ideal temperature for fresh cream... This room's temperature is too high (High room temperature - The temperature in Delicia's room is too high for fresh cream.).Gregory:(This is... intriguing.)FairyGregory:It's a cute candy fairy sitting on a tree stump. Hmm. The cream decorations are melting. The fairy seems to be well made, but... something feels slightly off.CastleFirst timeGregory:...I can't believe this amazing castle is made entirely out of confectionery.Ray:I know! What a work of fantasy. It's like a fairy tale world!Gregory:You like all this fairy tale stuff, don't you?Ray:Ah... sorry! I got a bit too excited, didn't I?Gregory:No... It's interesting to me since you're so enthusiastic about it, unlike my son.Ray:Your... son?Gregory:He's only in grade school, yet he prefers to read law books instead of fairy tales. ...I am worried that he won't be able to make any friends that he can talk to.Ray:Heh! What an interesting kid. I'd like to be his friend!Gregory:Ha ha... I think you'd be more of an \"older brother\" to him.Ray:He he he. An older brother, huh... Well, I've got some growing up to do then!Gregory:Yes, and that's why we have to continue with the investigation.Before examining blue cloth rolls, rocks, and hexagonal recessGregory:(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)After examining blue cloth rolls, rocks, and hexagonal recessGregory:(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)Hexagonal recessGregory:Hm. This pillar... has a hexagonal recess.Badd:It looks like a pedestal... but... it has nothing in it.Ray:A hexagonal recess (Hexagonal recess - The two pillars have a hexagonal recess on top. What were they for?), huh. I wonder what would have been put in there?Badd:...A giant strawberry... would fit with the fresh cream.Ray:Detective Badd. I don't think strawberries are hexagonal.Badd:I was just... hoping...Ray:Then, I hope it's a banana!Gregory:(...I think I'd prefer blueberries.)InsideLeads to:\"The castle doors are open...\"Gregory:The castle doors are open...Ray:When someone opens a door, they really should remember to close it afterwards.Gregory:(Would he say that directly to Prosecutor von Karma though?)Ray:Huh? Looks like there's some stuff inside. Hmm, let's see...Badd:Wait... I'll examine it. Stay out of the way. Tch... This fresh cream melts too easily (Fragile desserts - The cream is melting. A single touch can cause it to break.).Gregory:(Seems like Detective Badd's shoes got covered in cream... ...Why were these objects kept inside the candy castle?)Badd:...If there's anything you want to investigate... you better speak up now.Blue cloth rollsBadd:...There are rolls of blue cloth here. Looks like there's four of them in all...Gregory:They certainly don't look like desserts.Badd:Yeah... I don't know what the cloth is for... It almost seems like... it was hidden here inside the castle...Gregory:(...Also, the color of this cloth looks familiar somehow.)RocksBadd:Two big rocks... are placed here. It's like a... storage room.Ray:Yeah, the inside of the candy castle isn't so dreamy. ...Hey! Maybe they're raw gemstones? Who knew that there were such treasures hidden within the castle!Gregory:Seems like a rather careless way to handle treasure... Hm...? It looks like there's something underneath the rocks.Badd:Seems there's a... pedestal (Pedestal of rock - The rocks in the castle have a pedestal attached to them for some reason.) attached to both of the rocks...Ray:Of course! It's a pedestal for displaying the gems!Gregory:Well... in any case, this is no ordinary object.Raymond ShieldsRay:The sicky sweet smell of cream. Yes, this truly is a fairy tale world. And yet, here in this sugary sweet room, there was one with such a sour face... He doesn't belong in this room... That scary old man.Gregory:Raymond, mind what you say. You're being a bit rude.Ray:S-Sorry... It won't happen again. He reminded me of my old school teacher who used to get mad at me a lot...Gregory:(A school teacher. I definitely... ...don't want to think of my son being taught by such a man.)SignGregory:It says, \"The Four Fairies and the Curious Candy Castle.\" It seems that this was the theme for Delicia's works.Badd:But, it's not just the candy castle that I'm curious about...ToolsGregory:Here are all the tools used to make desserts.Badd:Everything from a bucket of fresh cream... to a brush and a trowel... Looks more like a construction worker's tools...Delicia:Hey now, boys. Don't undersweetmate the work of a pastry chef! It's completely different from construction work, where they cover the walls with cement. We use the trowel to smear the cream, and the brush to clean any uneven parts...Badd:...How is that different from construction work...?Delicia SconesDelicia:*sigh*...Ray:Huh? Ms. Delicious. You don't seem as energetic as you were earlier.Gregory:...Delicia. Can I just ask, did something happen with Von Karma?Delicia:Yessie! N-Nothing of the sort!Ray:But, you just said, \"Yessie\"...Delicia:Ha ha ha ha! That \"Yessie\" just now was only a greeting. You're a cute boy! I like you. What's your first name?Ray:Eh? It's Raymond, but...Delicia:Well, Ray Ray! I think you'll make a good man of yourself someday!Ray:R-Ray Ray...?Gregory:How about that. I think you have a way with British ladies.Ray:She's a little different from my image of a \"lady\"...Gregory:Why don't we listen to what she has to say.During the contestGregory:Could you tell me about your actions during the contest?Delicia:Yessie! We began making desserts for the contest around 10 o'clock. Basically, I was in here making my desserts the whole time. At half past one, I joined the afternoon tea for about an hour or so.Ray:Afternoon tea?Gregory:It's a social occasion, where conversation is had over black tea and cakes.Ray:...Umm. So, it's pretty much a tea party!Gregory:Well... I suppose.Delicia:Ha ha ha ha! Oh, Greggy, you're a smart boy, aren't you!Gregory:(When did I become \"Greggy\"...?) Where was the afternoon tea held?Delicia:It took place in the gardens, outside of the Fountain Patio. It's our customary break time during the contest. It's always held at the same time. Today there were just three of us who took part. Jeffy, Katie and me. Since Jeffy had already finished his creations, he was there from beginning to end. Icy and Gusty didn't join in because they hadn't finished their desserts yet.Gregory:...So, everyone other than Mr. Dover and Mr. Gustavia participated.Delicia:Yes. Actually, I hadn't finished my dessert yet either. I just wanted to try some of Jeffy's handmade pastries and Katie's fresh-brewed tea. So... after I had eaten my fill, I returned before everyone else.Gregory:During the contest, did you enter any of the other contestants' rooms?Delicia:Eh! Wh-What are you saying?Gregory:We found your fingerprints on the desserts at the crime scene...Delicia:Eep! You found them...!Badd:Are you... admitting that you went to the scene of the murder?Delicia:*sob* ...I admit it. But, I'm not the murderer! It's the honest truth, please hear me out!The honest truth (appears after During the contest)Gregory:What were you doing in Mr. Master's room?Delicia:The truth is... I was studying his desserts.Badd:Studying...?Delicia:Because Jeffy's so talented at making sweets! Well... Nobody was in his room at the time, so I just decided to study (Desserts study - Delicia went to Mr. Master's room to study his desserts.) his works for a bit.Badd:...But, if you were just looking, you wouldn't have left your fingerprints behind...?Delicia:Yessie! It's natural that I left fingerprints on the desserts! For the sake of research, I ate some of his desserts.Ray:Eeh! Isn't that like stealing food?Gregory:It couldn't be... The one who wrecked Mr. Master's room was...Delicia:*sob* ...I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to vandalize the room, but... I did eat a few parts of the desserts in his room. ...I secretly ate little bits and pieces so Jeffy wouldn't find out.Gregory:So... Did you you[sic] eat the ship stand as well?Delicia:Yessie! I did.Badd:The chocolate ship broke... because of you...Delicia:Eep! I'm sorry...!Ray:So, the reason she left the afternoon tea early... ...was to preserve her appetite...Delicia:B-But! You've got to believe me on this! I'm not the murderer!Gregory:(Her actions are sufficiently suspicious, but... I won't press on it yet.)PresentAttorney's BadgeDelicia:Oi! What's that?Gregory:This badge is proof that I'm a defense attorney.Delicia:Hoi! I'll show you mine too. This chef's hat is proof that I'm a pastry chef.Gregory:Is that so...? But aren't those sold in stores?Delicia:Hey! It's not the hat that's important, it's the spirit you wear the hat with that matters!Gregory:(So then, wouldn't that mean just about anyone can become a pastry chef...)Anything elseDelicia:Oi! That thing you've got there is rather cute, Greggy. But, the color is rather unappealing. Now, if I were to coat it with fresh cream...Gregory:S-Stop it!(Step)ladderBadd:...What is it, Mr. Attorney? Something about that ladder bothering you..?Gregory:Detective Badd. It's actually a stepladder.Badd:...They're both the same to me...Gregory:They're completely different. Look at their basic nature.Ray:Yeah, Mr. Edgeworth... You tell him!(Connecting hexagon Logic and examining blue cloth rolls leads to:)Gregory:(The \"blue cloth\" and the \"rocks\" inside the castle... I wonder if they belong to Delicia?) Delicia. Those things in the castle, what are they used for?Delicia:Ah... uhh, those? I'm afraid I can't tell you.Badd:...Looks like Von Karma is... keeping her silent...Delicia:Eep! I've been found out... He'll get made at me if I talk.Gregory:(Prosecutor von Karma... doesn't intend on being upfront with his information.)Ray:Aww... it's such a shame. We finally figured out where the rocks are supposed to go.Delicia:! Could it be that you're interested in my goods?Ray:Eh? Your \"goods\"...?Delicia:Those are my popular relaxation goods.Gregory:You mean... the rocks and the cloth?Delicia:Yessie! That's right! You see, they're not actually rocks, but special lamps made from rock salt.Ray:Wow! So those are lamps!Delicia:Ha ha ha ha! It gets even more exciting! Because, this cloth also has an amazing secret!Gregory:(As soon as we showed interest in her goods, she became quite talkative.)Delicia:Since we've got them out, come experience the therapy, boys. Baddie! Could you put everything up!Badd:It's... not Baddie, it's Badd...Delicia:...So you won't do it? Is Baddie being a bad boy?Gregory:.......Badd:...Labbie! Are you done photographing this room?Forensics:Yes, sir! I am!Badd:...Then go help Delicia...Forensics:Yes, sir! I'm on it!Delicia:Ha ha ha ha! Thanks! I knew you were a good boy underneath, Baddie!Ray:Ms. Delicious... That was amazing. You even persuaded Detective Badd!Delicia:Thanks a lot, Baddie! And you too, Forensies!Ray:...She even gave the forensics a nickname.Gregory:I think that's her way of showing she cares.Badd:What's so... therapeutic... about these things anyway?Delicia:We don't have time for that now, Baddie! The show's about to begin! Forensies! Finishing touches, please!Forensics:Yes, ma'am!Badd:It's...Ray:Wow, It's so beautiful!Gregory:It really is... (I wish my son could see this.)Delicia:Oi! I told you so, right? \"The Four Fairies and the Curious Candy Castle\" was the theme of my work. It's so sparkly and cute, right?Gregory:(It seems like... one of them is missing something.)Delicia:The truth is, I had planned to unveil it during the contest. Well, I'm glad I got to show it to you boys!Ray:Huh? But it doesn't look like the rock salt lamps are lighting up.Delicia:H-Huh? I wonder why...?Gregory:(I think I'll need to examine... the rocks and the fairies again.)Logic\"Beaten to death\" and \"Bloodstained rock salt lamp\"Gregory:There is evidence that the victim was beaten to death with a blunt object... What's more, there's a bloodstain on one of the broken rock salt lamps. Could this lamp have been the murder weapon?Ray:You're right! It could have been used as a weapon.Badd:...Labbie. Is the blood analysis on this rock salt lamp finished?Forensics:Yes, sir! It finished just a few moments ago! The bloodstain on that lamp belonged to the victim.Badd:...You heard what he said.Rock Salt Lamp added to the Court Record.Gregory:(The murder weapon was hidden in Delicia's room... We need to consider her as one of the suspects as well.)\"Delicia broke the rules\" and \"Fake desserts\"Gregory:Using decorations that were against the rules and making fake desserts... A lot of Delicia's actions seem suspicious.Badd:Yeah... It doesn't seem like she's aiming to be the world's greatest pastry chef...Ray:Also, the temperature of this room is way too high. Is there a reason for that?Fake Desserts added to the Court Record.Gregory:I wonder. ...I think we should ask Delicia directly.\"Desserts study\" and \"Knowledge was lacking\"Gregory:Delicia's knowledge in the art of dessert making is lacking in fundamental areas. And she claimed she went into Mr. Master's room in order to \"study his desserts\"... These actions and ideas are not fitting of someone aiming to be the world's greatest pastry chef.Badd:Yeah... They don't sounds like the words of a pro. It's like she doesn't even realize it, or...Gregory:(Or, maybe she isn't a real pastry chef...) Perhaps she had some other intention. ...It's possible that she didn't go into the room to study desserts.Ray:So, then... Are you saying Ms. Delicious is the criminal?Gregory:...We can't say that for sure yet. (But, I know she's hiding something from us...)PartnerBadd:...What?The investigationBadd:...Since the circumstances have changed, we should investigate the scene once more...Gregory:Yes. The fluorescent cloth behind the fairy dolls... and the rock salt lamp concerns me.Badd:Why were they in the castle... No... why were they hidden inside the castle. I knew it, that woman... smells. But not a sugary sweet smell...Gregory:We need to have another look, to see if there are any problems at the scene.Delicia Scones (after connecting fake desserts Logic)Badd:This desserts here... are all fake. ...What a... phony...Gregory:This is the contest to decide the world's greatest pastry chef. Why did she do something like that, which would immediately give her away?Badd:...I guess she was na\u00efve enough that she thought she could get away with it, or perhaps...Gregory:(Her true goal... I feel like I know what it is. I hold the fragmented pieces of information. Now, all I have to do is combine them...)PresentRock Salt LampGregory:There's no mistaking it, this is what took the victim's life.Badd:Chossing a weapon like this... perhaps the murder wasn't premeditated. If that's so... that woman... hit the victim with this lamp on a sudden impulse. It feels like the sweet smell of desserts has been tainted by the smell of something fishy.Gregory:(Delicia... Are you hiding something...?)Fairy on leftGregory:It's a cute candy fairy sitting on a tree stump. The cloth in the back along with the decorations really give it a magical atmosphere. When you look at it, it almost feels like you're spellbound.Badd:What we need to look for... is the hidden truths of the real world... Don't be fooled...by the fairies...!CastleBefore examining lamp on left and deducingGregory:(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)After examining lamp on left and deducingGregory:(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)Rock salt lamp on leftGregory:It looks like both the lamps in the pillars are broken.Badd:Both of their light bulbs... are broken...Ray:Maybe they were dropped on the floor. There's some sort of red stain on this lamp's surface.Gregory:This stain... could it be...!Badd:...That smell... There's no mistaking it. It's a bloodstain (Bloodstained rock salt lamp - Someone's bloodstain was left on the rock salt lamp.)...Ray:Ehhhh! Th-That's a bloodstain...Gregory:(Why is there a bloodstain on this lamp? I wonder if this has something to do with the lamp bulb being broken... I should also take a look at the other lamp here.)ClothsGregory:The castle door is adorned with a beautiful cloth. I think this was the cloth that was in the castle.Badd:Entrance ways are always beautiful... that's what a detective thinks.Gregory:(Yes, after Detective Badd's shoes have trampled all over it... But, this is no time for snide remarks.)DoorBadd:...This dessert made my shoes all dirty... If you come any closer... your shoes will be covered in cream too...Gregory:(We've already seen what's behind the door. There's no need to look again.)Rock salt lamp on rightGregory:So this is where Delicia originally intended to put the lamps.Badd:...I don't get why she put them in the castle...Ray:Since they're broken and don't light up, maybe she decided to put them out of the way?Badd:...If she wanted them out of the way... There are many other places to store them.Ray:It's like that old saying, \"Hide the salt in the sugar bag!\"Gregory:(...I think the saying goes, \"Hide a tree in the forest.\" If Delicia intended to use these lamps as decorations during the contest... It creates a contradiction with that piece of evidence. I need to deduce the contradiction at the scene...)DeduceGregory:(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)Deduce cloths or lamps and present Contest RulesGregory:Leads to:\"Detective Badd. Please read the contest leaflet.\"OtherwiseGregory:Gregory:Detective Badd, look at this. Don't you think it's strange?Badd:I think what's strange... is your deduction.Gregory:Urgh...!Badd:If your brain isn't working right... then it's due to the lack of sugar... ...I'll sell you one of my lollipops... for two bucks.Gregory:(That sounds a tad high... Is there no evidence of a contradiction with the castle decorations?)Gregory:Detective Badd. Please read the contest leaflet.Badd:.....\"Any decorations not made from desserts are prohibited.\" ...Huh.Gregory:These rock salt lamps and the fluorescent cloths go against the rules (Delicia broke the rules - Delicia used other objects besides desserts for her decorations.).Ray:So, maybe that's why they were hidden in the castle?Gregory:I wonder about that... I think we should investigate further into Delicia's actions.Fairy on rightGregory:Unlike the other fairies, this one doesn't have a fluorescent cloth.Ray:Ms. Delicious! It's not right to leave one out!Delicia:I don't like it either. But... one fluorescent cloth and a machine has gone missing!Gregory:You've lost a cloth... and a machine? What sort of machine is it?Delicia:Oi! Let me tell you! Each piece of fluorescent cloth is hooked up to one of these machines. The machine is called a rainbow light device... Light is sent through the cable and into the cloth, which is made of optic fibers. Just fiddle around with the settings a bit, and it will turn into all sorts of colors! When it glows red, it's like a raging inferno! And when it glows blue, you can almost feel the glittering cool ice! It's powered by a long-lasting battery that's resistant to changes in the temperature!Gregory:Um, I'm not very familiar with these kinds of devices...Ray:Mr. Edgeworth. She's saying it's a machine that transmits light to the special cloth.Gregory:(...I see. It's amazing what they come up with these days.)Badd:So, one rainbow light device... and one fluorescent cloth are missing...?Delicia:Yessie, that's right. Wherever could they be...Gregory:(This fluorescent cloth... could it be related to the case?)Fluorescent Cloth added to the Court Record.Fairy on right (subsequent times)Gregory:(One rainbow light device and one fluorescent cloth have gone missing. Could there be some connection to the case...?)Delicia SconesThe room temperature (after connecting fake desserts Logic)Gregory:Delicia, why is the room temperature set to 68\u2109?Delicia:The cold doesn't agree with me. Plus, it's bad for the body! This figure doesn't just maintain itself, you know! Naturally, as a lady, I want to look young forever.Ray:I wonder... how old Ms. Delicious really is.Gregory:Raymond. A true gentleman never asks a woman her age.Badd:This room... is mainly filled with cream... And 50\u2109 is the recommended temperature for preserving fresh cream.Delicia:What, really? Now it's all gone to waste!Ray:It looks like Ms. Delicious didn't know (Knowledge was lacking - Delicia seems lacking in the basic knowledge of dessert making.).Badd:...Hmph. I thought she was supposed to be a first-class pastry chef...Gregory:(The fake desserts and the rule violations. And now... her lack of basic knowledge. Looks like she keeps many secrets...)PresentFluorescent ClothDelicia:Oi! Looks like this caught your eye. The way this cloth works... Ah, I wonder if it's OK for me to tell you about it.Gregory:...?Delicia:...Sorry, I can't talk about this cloth!Gregory:(What...? That was strange. I wonder if Von Karma told her to say quiet about it?)Examine evidenceBlue cloth of Fluorescent ClothGregory:A blue cloth... I like this relaxing color.Ray:As expected of Mr. Edgeworth! That's so old school! C'mon, let's hurry and make it glow!Gregory:Y... Yes. (Does he mean I'm old-fashioned...?)Glowing cloth of Fluorescent ClothGregory:The rainbow light device has made the cloth glow with light blue aura.Ray:Speaking of which, one set of this cloth and device has gone missing. I wonder where it went to?Gregory:I don't have the answer to that... but it could be related to the case.Switches on machine of Fluorescent ClothRay:Ah! There are some switches over here!Gregory:They probably control the color of the cloth. Raymond, try pressing one. The cloth has started to glow.Ray:It's so mesmerizing... I could look at it all day...Rock salt of Rock Salt LampRay:This rock salt lamp doesn't light up.Gregory:Hm... It's a shame, but it appears to be broken.Ray:Aww, I really wanted to see it light up... I wanted to experience the calming glow too!Gregory:(Maybe I should try putting one in the office.)Bloodstain on Rock Salt LampRay:Ugh... A vivid bloodstain was left behind... I can't believe the murder weapon came from inside the candy castle...Gregory:Raymond. If it's too difficult, you don't have to look at it.Ray:I-I'm fine! I'm going to become a lawyer after all!Gregory:Heh... I see. (You have a promising future...)Bottom side of Rock Salt LampRay:This rock salt lamp has a hexagonal base.Gregory:The recess in the pillars must have been made to match this shape.Ray:After all, they fit the pillars in the candy castle perfectly!(Connecting all possible Logic and examining fairy on right leads to:)Investigation CompleteBadd:That's enough... investigating...Gregory:Hmph... We've found much more than I expected. (And yet, something from before still bothers me. Prosecutor von Karma must have found the murder weapon in this room... So then, why did he let Delicia be? First, I must ascertain Von Karma's true motives...!) Detective Badd. I would like to ask Prosecutor von Karma something.Badd:...I've also got business with him... And Delicia there too...Delicia:Eep! What's the idea, Baddie? Don't glare at me like that.Gregory:(It seems Detective Badd also has his doubts about Delicia and Von Karma.) Delicia, would you come with us for a moment?Delicia:Yessie! That's... fine. What for?Gregory:...We have to find Von Karma. There are some things we need to talk about.December 24, 8:05 PMContest VenueFountain PatioGregory:Prosecutor von Karma. We need to talk about the case.von Karma:Tsk tsk tsk... From the look on your face, I assume you've found the murder weapon?Gregory:Yes... We discovered the murder weapon in Delicia's room. ...It would seem Mr. Master isn't the only suspect in this case.von Karma:Bah... That's not true. Where the murder weapon was found does not change the fact that Master is the culprit. ...As long as I am here.Gregory:(Why is Von Karma so sure of himself...?) Well then, aren't you going to explain? Why the murder weapon was in Delicia's room!von Karma:Hmph... Naturally. If you wish to know, I'll tell you.-- About the Murder Weapon --von Karma:In order to pin the crime on Delicia, Master used the rock salt lamp to kill the victim.He then deposited the murder weapon in Delicia's room.If he had left the murder weapon at the crime scene, Master would have been the one suspected.He couldn't move the body, but it was easy to move the murder weapon.Ergo, there would be no evidence pointing to a specific culprit at the crime scene.Gregory:Mr. Master took the rock salt lamp...?von Karma:...Precisely. I carried out the investigation myself... There can be no room for doubt.Gregory:Do you have evidence that he moved it?von Karma:...Hmph. That will not be necessary.Gregory:Wha...!von Karma:Tsk tsk tsk... If you have an objection, say it. Do you think a mere defense attorney can break my logic!?Gregory: Gregory: He took the rock salt lamp from Delicia's room...? von Karma: ...Exactly. In order to kill Dover, he had prepared the murder weapon beforehand. Gregory: But, the murder weapon was found in Delicia's room. Doesn't that place suspicion on Delicia too? von Karma: Hmph... I'm not finished. Master killed Dover...Gregory: Gregory: So, the murder weapon was the rock salt lamp hidden inside the candy castle? von Karma: Hmph... I discovered the murder weapon when I entered the castle. Be thankful, defense attorney, that you too came by this information! Gregory: ...Why was it necessary for you to enter the castle? Ray: Ah! Maybe he's interested in candy castles? von Karma: von Karma: Why you... Do you think I went in there because I wanted to!? The detectives at the scene were useless, so I had to investigate myself! Badd: ...! I wasn't in charge of... the initial investigation...! Gregory: (Detective Badd joined the investigation halfway through...) von Karma: Bah! A certain work ethic is required if you are to gain my trust. This is a flagrant waste of time. ...I'll continue.Gregory: Gregory: Wouldn't the body left behind in his room also be cause for suspicion? Moreover... von Karma: von Karma: ...I have a favorite saying. I'd like to share it with you. \"Even dogs can wait.\" Wait until I've finished! Gregory: (...That's exactly... what I'd like to say to you.)Gregory: Gregory: Are you saying that Mr. Master removed the murder weapon, and hid the body in the chest? von Karma: He believed that if he hid it inside his own work, it would not be discovered. Delicia: Eep! So savory! Gregory: (Don't you mean... \"so sorry\"?) Badd: She shows no sign... of remorse. von Karma: ...He moved the murder weapon, and left the body at the scene.Gregory: Gregory: How can you conclude that Mr. Master is the killer without any evidence!? von Karma: von Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... You think that will shake me? You disappoint me! As long as the body was found in Master's room, he's the prime suspect! Gregory: Gregory: Is there really no evidence pointing to anyone else at the crime scene? Surely there's room for further investigation... von Karma: von Karma: Insolent attorney. Another investigation is not necessary. Master must be the killer! If you think differently, cease these pointless words and speak with evidence! Gregory: (Think back to the crime scene. If Mr. Master isn't the killer... There must have been something there incriminating someone else!)Gregory: (It seems Von Karma won't be shaken easily.

And why were you indulging yourself in another contestant's work!?Delicia:...Yessie... I understand.Delicia:The truth is... I'm not really a dessert chef, like I led you to believe. I'm actually a pharmacist.Ray:What! A pharmacist?Gregory:(That's a completely different occupation... It's no wonder he couldn't hide his surprise.) Why is a pharmacist like you participating in this contest?Delicia:...I just love eating desserts. I joined because I thought I'd be able to eat some of Jeffy's desserts.

I never wore gloves!Gregory:Delicia's fingerprints were found on Mr. Master's chocolates. So it is true that she wasn't wearing gloves.Delicia:Yessie! Exactly!

The room was empty after all.Gregory:(Perhaps the victim was already dead by then...)Delicia:But my first bite tasted way too salty and I couldn't eat it! So, I ate the delicious star-shaped dessert that was nearby.Ray:Ms. Delicious... You really are a glutton.Gregory:(Is it rare you see a woman with this kind of appetite.)Delicia:That's all I did. Greggy, Manny, everyone... I'm sorry I caused you trouble.Gregory:Now that you've told us the truth, everything's fine.

What is the meaning of this!Ray:The desserts adorning the victim's room had disappeared without a trace. Was this the true killer's doing? A body that was hidden inside a dessert, and a murder weapon that was moved... Further investigation would be required to arrive at the truth of this case.To be continued.April 2, 10:15 AMZodiac Art GalleryFountain PatioRay:...Oops, I guess I went on for a little too long there.Edgeworth:Something like that... happened? I had no idea. None of the case files I read went into such detail.Ray:Well, I doubt there would be anything in there that would be inconvenient to the prosecution. Especially with that Von Karma at the head.Edgeworth:How did the investigation go from there?Ray:The desserts had disappeared from the victim's room, so the investigation hit a rough patch. Thanks to that, it took about a whole year before a verdict was handed down.Edgeworth:One whole year...?Ray:This was before the whole 3-day pre-trial system was established. Trial didn't need to finish in the short amount of time that they do now.Edgeworth:...I see. Did they ever find out why the victim's dessert disappeared?Ray:Well, kinda... His dessert was like a candy ice sculpture, made from sherbet... Since it was made from ice, the general consensus was that it had melted. ...However, that might not quite be the case.Edgeworth:What do you mean?Ray:This museum used to be Mr. Master's mansion.Edgeworth:The stage of the IS-7 Incident...Ray:And in this very place, they're exhibiting the \"Sherbet Salon\" from 18 years ago.Edgeworth:! The victim's dessert...?Ray:Yep. Though it could be just a replica of the original. That's why Uncle Ray had to come today, to check it out. ...And for your old man, too.Edgeworth:.....Ray:Now then! Let's get a move on and check out the room! I'm pretty sure it's over in the \"Winter Palace.\" Hmm... The Winter Palace should be... Huh? It's... locked up. That's odd. They've already opened the museum.Edgeworth:...Mr. Shields. According to the pamphlet we received at the entrance, the Winter Palace is over here.Ray:Really? I could've sworn it was this one. Alright, let's scoot. We gotta confirm the truth of what happened 18 years ago.April 2, 10:20 AMZodiac Art GalleryWinter PalaceRay:Man... It's still as cold as ever. Uncle Ray's gonna freeze solid.Edgeworth:It seems the \"Winter Palace\" lives up to its name. It's like a freezer in here. (With the light dimmed like this, it's almost as if the room itself is made of ice...)Ray:I think the control panel for the room temperature is on the back wall. Miles, why don't you check what temperature it's set at for me? Uncle Ray's gonna give the curator a piece of his mind later. It's way too cold in here.Edgeworth:Hm... Very well.Ray:But if you want to look around the room a bit, feel free to stay, or freeze, to your heart's content. I'll get the camera ready. I want to take some pictures of this place and show it to your old man.Edgeworth:...Understood.Ice block on leftEdgeworth:(For some reason, a giant block of ice is on display. There's a description written on the surface... Castor and Pollux. Every December, large meteor showers appear in the direction of these two stars...)Woman:.....And so, Mask\u2606DeMasque...Man:...And then, I...Edgeworth:(Those two are being rather noisy and distracting. It can't be helped. I should go look at another exhibit.)Man and womanWoman:...Well, how about this? I'll yell out... \"Mask\u2606DeMasque is here!\"Man:Yes! It's meeeeeeee! I'm Mask\u2606DeMasque!Woman:Good, good... Wait, Ronnie! If you say that, you'll get arrested! C'mon, if we don't plan properly, we won't be able to sell it.Edgeworth:(What are these two talking about...?)Control panelFirst timeEdgeworth:...Hmm. Mr. Shields. I can't find the temperature control panel.Ray:Ah, right. They keep it where it's hard to find. Just one moment. Huh? It's locked. Makes sense. They wouldn't want the guests changing the temperature themselves.Edgeworth:According to the pamphlet, the Winter Palace has a temperature of 27\u2109.Ray:Brrrr! Now that is cold. Uncle Ray's going to freeze to death! Guess I'll need to find someone to share body heat with. Preferably a beautiful lady.Edgeworth:.....Ray:Oh! Are you trying to freeze me to death as well with those cold eyes?Edgeworth:Of course not.Raymond ShieldsRay:...Miles. Can I ask you something?Edgeworth:Of course, what is it?Ray:Is it okay... to take photos in this room?Edgeworth:What! Haven't you checked? ...But, if you haven't gotten any warnings about it, then it should be fine.Ray:Ah, sorry. Well, to be honest, I would've taken some anyway. Your old man had always wanted to investigate this \"Winter Palace\" after all.Edgeworth:(...If my father had seen this room, would he have found something? If he had, the results of the trial might have also... No, there's no point in thinking that now.)Ice statuesEdgeworth:There are two sculptures displayed here...Ray:These sculptures are replicas of the desserts that vanished 18 years ago. ...Impressive, huh. These sculptures made of ice.Edgeworth:Yes... (My father never got to see these ice sculptures. And now... 18 years later, I'm standing before them.)Ray:...Miles. Sorry to bother you while you're deep in thought. Could you turn this way a little?Edgeworth:...? Like this?Ray:Yes, yes. Like that.Edgeworth:! Mr Shields, you're not...Ray:Say \"cheese!\"Edgeworth:...Mr Shields, please don't take pictures of me.Ray:He he he. Sorry, my bad. I just wanted to make sure the camera works okay.Edgeworth:That camera... looks quite old.Ray:Yeah, well, that's because it's an old-fashioned camera. You know, an instant camera. It automatically develops the photos after shooting. Pretty cool, huh.Edgeworth:Yes, I know... Though I've never used one.Ray:He he he. You're quite the know-it-all. You really are the old man's son. Er, could you move a bit? I want to take some more photos of the room.Edgeworth:(His face has taken on an unusually serious expression. He's probably thinking about the IS-7 Incident...)Ray:Man. I snapped a bunch! And they're already developed, see?Edgeworth:(...He shoved them in my face before I could reply.)Ray:Well, I have one more question for you, Mr. Know-It-All! Do you know what these two sculptures represent?Edgeworth:They're sculptures of Taurus and Gemini from the \"winter constellations\".Ray:Ooh! Bingo! Not bad, Miles. That's probably why they call this room the \"Winter Palace\". Uncle Ray is feeling generous today, so I'll give you a copy of this photo too.Edgeworth:Uh... Th-Thanks.Winter Palace Photo data jotted down in my Organizer.Edgeworth:...Are these replicas of the constellation desserts that were made 18 years ago?Ray:Yeah. It looks like these two sculptures are also made out of sherbet. Uncle Ray's only seen the real sculptures in photos... ...but these sculptures look like the real deal.Edgeworth:This was what you wanted to show me?Ray:Yeah... I think your old man would have wanted you to see it as well. I'm sorry. Uncle Ray didn't have the courage to come here alone.Edgeworth:...Don't apologize. This was a good opportunity to learn about my father's case.Ray:That means a lot to me. So, you want me to take another commemorative photo?Edgeworth:No thanks.Ice statues (subsequent times)Edgeworth:To create something like this out of sherbet... Even reproducing it would require considerable technique. The glass case seems to be lit up from the inside. If those stanchions weren't there, I could get a closer look.LampEdgeworth:This rock salt lamp is lighting up the constellation chart. I see... Gemini and Taurus are constellations that can be seen in the winter. Since this is the Winter Palace, perhaps that explains the winter constellations made of sherbet. According to the pamphlet, the other palaces are made of crystal. But for the Summer Palace, I think it'd be more fitting if it were made out of shaved ice... Well, no, that would make it exactly the same as this room... Hmm...ExitRay:Miles, since we came all the way here, why don't you take a look around?Edgeworth:Well, since this room is so cold, I thought I'd go to a warmer room...Ray:If you're that cold, why don't you borrow my clothes? And in exchange, I'll borrow your jacket.Edgeworth:...No thanks. (Let's try enduring this for just a little longer.)BoyEdgeworth:(There's a boy with a school bag. Did he come to the art gallery... by himself?)???:Hmm... She even quit her job in order to run this museum. I don't really get it.Edgeworth:(Perhaps... one of his parents knows the curator?)Ice block on rightEdgeworth:(A giant block of ice is being displayed here. It appears to be quite heavy... No, the inside must be hollow. On the surface, there is an image of the stars and a written description. The Pleiades... also known as the Seven Sisters. A star cluster that comprises a part of Taurus.) But, for all these stars to be grouped together as a cluster... The ways of the ancient people must have been very imprecise.(Examining control panel, ice statues, and ice block on right leads to:)Ray:Alrighty, now that I've got some pictures of this room, let's check out the other places. Might as well see them all, since we're already here.Edgeworth:...I suppose you're right.???:AAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!Edgeworth:! That yell just now...!Ray:It came from the Fountain Patio! Let's go, Miles!April 2, 10:30 AMZodiac Art GalleryFountain PatioEdgeworth:(There's someone passed out on the floor! And that man there is...!) Larry! What are you doing here!? No, I'm getting ahead of myself. What exactly happened here?Larry:E-Edgeyyyyy! I... I saw something that no one should ever have to see! Agaaain!Edgeworth:Larry, calm down! Why is there someone passed out here?Larry:I-I didn't do anything! He just fell down all of a sudden!Ray:! This man... He can't be...!???:Excuse me, but what is the matter here????:You can't raise such a ruckus in the museum, boys.Edgeworth:Hm? This scent is...!Ray:Seems like he's still breathing, but this is a bad situation...! Miles, it's not safe here! Get everyone out of here!Edgeworth:Everyone, get away from that room right now! There's... poison gas coming out from it!April 2, 10:42 AMZodiac Art GalleryFountain PatioEdgeworth:Hmm. Mr. Shields. How is the victim?Ray:It looks like he breathed in a little too much of that poison gas... He's still unconscious. According to the doctor in the ambulance, there are no external injuries or any other wounds. Thanks to our fortunate timing, we were able to save him before he was too far gone... ...but he's not out of the woods yet. He's currently being treated by a specialist in the infirmary.Edgeworth:I see... Mr. Shields, is he an acquaintance of yours?Ray:Yeah, you could say that. He's Dane Gustavia. He was involved in the IS-7 Incident.Edgeworth:The pastry chef? (So he was involved in the case 18 years ago.)Ray:At least the other guy is doing alright. Is he a friend of yours, Miles?Edgeworth:...Yes, you could say that. It is unfortunate you were not hurt, Larry.Larry:What's \"you could say that\" supposed to mean, Edgey!? How could you treat a childhood friend like that? That's just cruel! And also, when I'm dressed like this, I'm called Laurice Deauxnim, y'know. So don't call me \"Larry,\" It's \"Laurice!\"Edgeworth:(This man is Larry Butz. He's nothing but trouble, but he's been one of my friends since grade school. Some time ago, he awakened to the calling of art and assumed the alias \"Laurice Deauxnim\"... ...but a Butz by any other name would smell just as much.)Ray:Really? You two are childhood friends? I better report that to your old man, too. I'm sure it will bring him joy. He was always worried about you not being able to make friends.Larry:Good for you, Edgey! Aren't you glad to have a bosom buddy like me?Edgeworth:(My father was worried about something like that...?) But anyway, what are you doing in a place like this, Larry?Larry:How many times do I have to tell you, Edgey!? I'm \"Laurice\"!Edgeworth:What. Are you doing. In a place. Like this!?Larry:Yikes! Don't glare at me when you talk!Edgeworth:So are you going to tell me?Larry:Isn't it obvious? I've come here to study art! I'm going to take Mandy on a date here, so I was just doing some scouting beforehand!Edgeworth:(Aren't you just using art as an excuse to go on a date...?)Ray:Not bad, Laurice! Maybe you can introduce some pretty girls to me next time.Larry:Oh, now you're talkin' my language, dude!Edgeworth:(...I think I'm getting a headache.)Ray:By the way, Laurice... Did you notice anything strange when you found the victim?Larry:Nah... not really.Edgeworth:Nothing that would make you say, \"I saw something that no one should ever have to see\"?Larry:Oh, yeah... That. I was just surprised when I saw that old dude fall down out of nowhere like that. I didn't do anything this time, for once!Edgeworth:...Is that anything to brag about!????:Visitors, we wish to deeply apologize for the disturbance. I am the curator of this museum. My name is Katherine Hall.Edgeworth:(She's also one of the people involved in the IS-7 Incident...!)Ray:Hello there, Ms. Kate.Kate:Monsieur Shields, thank you for your continued assistance.Edgeworth:(She was the woman we saw at the reception. So she's the curator here...)Kate:We apologize for the inconvenience, especially since it's the opening day...Ray:No, no. You don't have to apologize for a thing, Ms. Kate. Ah... I almost forgot. Let me introduce you to someone. This is Miles Edgeworth. ...He's Gregory Edgeworth's son.Kate:Oh! Monsieur Edgeworth's...! \u266c Oh! How wonderfuuuuuul! I meeeet the soooooon... Afteeer eighteeeeen years...! \u266a \u266a It is an honor to meet youuu! Deefeensee attooorneyyyy Miles Edgewooooooorth! \u266cRay:Wow, that was amazing! You still got that golden voice, Ms. Kate.Edgeworth:...Actually, I'm a prosecutor.Kate:Oh, so you are a prosecutor? My most sincere apologies, Monsieur Edgeworth.Edgeworth:(This woman is very polite, but... slightly odd.)Larry:U-Uh... Katey! Could I get your autograph right here, pretty please?Kate:Yes... if you so desire.Edgeworth:Why do you want her autograph?Larry:Hey! Don't tell me... You don't know who she is?Ray:My, my. You really don't keep up with the entertainment news, do you, Miles?Edgeworth:(What...? What is this unbearable atmosphere!?)Ray:She's a superstar actress who's been in tons of musicals and movies. She's a great singer too.Kate:*giggle*... Currently, I am the curator of this museum. I have already retired from the stage. I finished filming my role for my last movie a few days ago. My costars also said that they would come here once I opened the doors. ...And here you are, Monsieur Artiste. I return this to you.Larry:Thanks a bunch, Katey! I'll treasure it for the rest of my life!Ray:Well, well. Looks like me and Laurice share the same interests.Edgeworth:(...So I gathered.) Larry, you said you're here to study art. Why don't you practice drawing as well? ...Since you're here at Ms. Hall's art museum.Kate:Oh! It would be an honor to have Monsieur Artiste sketch our exhibits.Larry:Oh, I guess even you have some good ideas every now and then, Edgey! I'll do a bit of sketching for Katey here!Kate:Hee hee... what an amusing person.Edgeworth:...Forgive the disturbance. Incidentally, who was the woman that was with you earlier?Kate:That was Madame Delicia Scones. She is currently assisting in the treatment of Monsieur Gustavia in the infirmary. Even though I said \"infirmary\", since this is an art museum now, it is only provisional. As I am the only staff member working here, I cannot take a leave of my duties for too long.Edgeworth:Delicia Scones... I believe we have heard that name before, Mr. Shields.Ray:Yep. Looks like the whole gang from the IS-7 Incident is here. Well. ...I doubt that's a coincidence.Edgeworth:......Kate:...Monsieur Shields. Monsieur Edgeworth. Would you care for some hot tea?Ray:Oh! Ms. Kate's tea. That takes me back.Edgeworth:...Yes, if you please....*clatter, clatter*...Kate:Now, I must take my leave. I must explain the situation to the other visitors.Ray:Alright, thanks for everything.Edgeworth:(This smells like... Ceylon tea. I should drink it before it cools.) Oh... This Ceylon tea is of very high quality. And this aroma of citrus...Ray:\"Does wonders for your concentration,\" right?Edgeworth:!Ray:He he he, your old man said the exact same thing 18 years ago. But the saucers back then were chilled. Today they're warm.Edgeworth:...Hmm. A-Anyway... Don't you think this current situation is rather unusual?Ray:You mean how everyone involved in the case 18 years ago has gathered at this museum?Edgeworth:Yes. I would like to be in charge of this case, if at all possible...Gumshoe:Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Are you OK!?Kay:Mr. Edgeworth! Mr. Shields! I came here as fast as I could when I heard that you were done in by the poison gas!Ray:Ohh! My sweet honey Kay! How about a hug after being parted for so long?Kay:No. Geez! So you're perfectly fine? I can't believe you made us worry so much!Edgeworth:Detective Gumshoe... What is the meaning of bringing Kay here?Gumshoe:I-I'm sorry, sir! I knew the gas was dangerous, so I tried to stop her... But no matter how much I ran and ran and and ran and ran, I couldn't gain any ground...Kay:...He he heh, when it comes to running away, no one is faster than the Yatagarasu!Edgeworth:(But you weren't running away from here...)Gumshoe:Mr. Edgeworth, I'm all set, sir! I'll start investigating the crime scene! Since there might still be traces of gas in the room, I'll have to ask everyone to wait here.Edgeworth:Very well. I'm counting on you.Ray:Good luck in there, flatfoot!Kay:Wow. Gummy's so cool! He's just like a detective!Edgeworth:(...But that's what he is...)Edgeworth:...Yes, Edgeworth here.Gumshoe:Mr. Edgeworth! It looks like the poison gas has dissipated, sir!Edgeworth:Detective, calmly explain the state of the Autumn Palace.Gumshoe:Yessir! I'll start with the exhibits. On the left, there's a statue with two people. And on the right, there's a statue of an animal with two horns.Edgeworth:(A statue of two people and a statue of an animal with horns... Isn't that the exact same thing I saw in the Winter Palace just a while ago...?)Gumshoe:Also, the room is wet with water thanks to the sprinkler system! That also prevented the gas from harming everyone else.Edgeworth:The sprinkler system... Was there a fire in the room?Gumshoe:There are no signs of a fire, and the fire alarm hasn't gone off either, sir. The sprinklers in this museum are the kind that detects both smoke and fire. If it detects smoke, it will send an alert to the security room. I think the poison gas might have set off the alarm in the security room, sir.Edgeworth:Was there anyone in the security room at the time?Gumshoe:The only one working here is the curator, Ms. Katherine Hall, sir. She has been in the reception booth, opposite the security room ever since the museum opened.Edgeworth:Did Ms. Hall turn on the sprinklers?Gumshoe:The sprinkler system can only be operated manually from the security room, sir. If it had been automatic, it would have sprayed water all over the exhibits. Since the system is manual, the situation can be examined and the exhibits moved if need be.Edgeworth:(I guess there would be more priority over the exhibits than the building. Only at a museum.)Gumshoe:Brrrr... But it's way too cold in this room, sir! Isn't this supposed to be the Autumn Palace? It feels more like the dead of winter in here!Edgeworth:The Autumn Palace... is \"cold\"?Gumshoe:I checked the thermostat earlier, and it was set to 27\u2109! I couldn't believe it!Edgeworth:(Why would the Autumn Palace be set to the same temperature as the Winter Palace...?)Gumshoe:That's about all I know for now, sir. If I figure out anything else, I'll give you another call!Edgeworth:I see. I'm counting on you, Detective.April 2, 11:15 AMZodiac Art GalleryFountain PatioKay:What did Gummy say?Edgeworth:...He said it feels more like winter in the Autumn Palace.Kay:? I don't get it!Edgeworth:I haven't been able to enter the room personally... ...but it should be possible to look inside ater the police have finished investigating.Ray:Hmm. I'd like to know what it's like in there myself.Kay:Isn't there anyone else who knows about the incident?Ray:Aah! There is someone! Miles' friend, right!Kay:Friend...?Edgeworth:(Though he's such a nuisance, we have no choice but to listen to what he has to say for now...)Kay:Wait, you mean...!Larry:Oh! You're here too Kay! You're looking as cute as ever!Kay:Eheheh. Long time no see! It's Larry... isn't it!Larry:...Kay, right now my name is \"Laurice\"... I'm an artist, that's why.Kay:Ah, so that's your pen name! Laurice, the artist formerly known as Larry!Larry:Wow, you really are a good girl, Kay! ...Nothing like Edgey here.Edgeworth:..... Larry. I have many things I need to ask you.Larry:What's this! Don't tell me you suspect me again! You're gonna say because I was first on the scene, I must be the culprit, aren't you!?Edgeworth:...I never said anything like that. I only want you to tell me what you saw. You said you \"saw something that no one should ever have to see\", did you not?Larry:BUUUUT! Now I'm saying I didn't see nothing, and I didn't do nothing! ....Probably.Ray:Oh my, he didn't seem so confident at the end there.Edgeworth:...There are somewhat troublesome circumstances surrounding this man. The saying \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz\" still holds true, 26 years on. One could say his tendency to attract trouble is legendary. (It seems he's done something troublesome, without even realizing it himself... ...I'll just have to try and extract the truth from him.)Edgeworth:My goal is to expose whatever Larry is hiding. However...Larry:I didn't see nothing, I didn't do nothing!3 CHESS PIECESEdgeworth:(Larry is an extremely restless and troublesome man. Until he cools down, I'll just wait and see.)

Did you see anything in the Winter Palace?Larry:You're still hung up on that? Didn't I say that I didn't see anything? I started to think that it wasn't such a good idea to come to the art gallery. I needed to leave soon to meet with my girlfriend.Before obtaining clueEdgeworth:...Hmm. I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. Maybe I should try another line of attack...Leads back to firstAfter obtaining clueLeads to:\"Perhaps I should try using that clue...?\"I have no more use for you.Edgeworth:I have no more use for you... Leave, now!Larry:...Huh? Really? You're actually letting me go? Well, I need to go to meet Mandy anyway.Edgeworth:W-Wait! That was a mistake.Larry:Edgey! You need to take responsibility for what you say!Edgeworth:Nnghhooooooh! (I'm being lectured by HIM!) Please... I'd like to ask you a few more questions.Larry:...Fine. But you'll have to treat me to dinner.Edgeworth:Ngh... (I need to be careful not to make careless statements...)Leads back to firstEdgeworth:Perhaps I should try using that clue...?What about your sketch?Leads to:\"You came here to sketch the sculpture for your girlfriend, did you not?\"Wait and see.Edgeworth:...........Larry:Huh? What? If you're not gonna talk, I'm going back to my sketching!Edgeworth:W-Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and feelings, and strike with the right words!Leads back to firstEdgeworth:You came here to sketch the sculpture for your girlfriend, did you not? I don't think you would give up that easily! Even after the victim collapsed, you could still see inside the room from the outside, right?Larry:W-Well, I may have gotten a tiny glimpse, but... ...there's no evidence... that I saw something scary in there, right...?You saw \"something scary\"?Leads to:\"My, my... I'm disappointed it turned out to be this simple.\"You covered your eyes?Edgeworth:Larry! The statement you just made is full of problems!Larry:What's with you Edgey? Isn't that the case... with all my statements!?Edgeworth:H-He's suddenly serious...! (That was an unnecessary statement.) I must read my opponent's reactions and feelings, and strike with the right words!Leads back to firstWait and see.Edgeworth:...........Larry:Huh? What? If you're not gonna talk, I'm going back to my sketching!Edgeworth:W-Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and feelings, and strike with the right words!Leads back to firstEdgeworth:My, my... I'm disappointed it turned out to be this simple. Larry. You saw \"something scary\" at the crime scene, didn't you!?1 PIECE BROKENLarry:U-Uw-waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgey! You! Can you read my mind!? In that case... there's no point in keeping any more secrets from you!Edgeworth:...You just told me everything of your own accord. That was a complete waste of time, but, finally... It's checkmate.Logic Chess CompleteLarry:I had my eyes fixed on the Gemini Sculpture...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:You've mentioned the Gemini Sculpture many times now, but... I don't believe the sculpture you saw was the Gemini one.Larry:Wh-What!? Was it a mirage then?Edgeworth:(Larry mistakenly thought he saw the Winter Palace.) This piece of evidence shows what Larry really saw!Present Art Gallery PamphletEdgeworth:Leads to:\"Take a look at this pamphlet.\"Present anything elseEdgeworth:Edgeworth:This piece of evidence shows what you really saw!Larry:...Y'know, you really shouldn't put that much faith in your sense of aesthetics. If you'd like, I could teach you a thing or two about art.Edgeworth:Ngh...! I-It's fine! (So it's not this piece of evidence... Larry mistakenly thought he saw the Winter Palace. But what he saw was not the Gemini Sculpture from the Winter Palace! I must have evidence that proves that...!)Leads back to:\"This piece of evidence shows what Larry really saw!\"Edgeworth:Take a look at this pamphlet. In the Autumn Palace... The Pisces, Capricorn, Aries, and Aquarius sculptures are displayed. Incidentally, I can confirm that the Gemini Sculpture is located in the Winter Palace. Therefore, the sculpture you saw could not have been the Gemini one!Larry:......I knew it.Edgeworth:(...Hm. I expected him to be a bit more shocked at the news...)Larry:I thought it was kinda strange. I know I saw a single goddess. ...And that transformation was no mirage.Edgeworth:...\"Transformation\", you say?Larry:Oh! You're curious too, Edgey? Well, nothing for it, guess I'll have to show you!Edgeworth:...Show me? What, exactly?Larry:I drew a picture of the very scene I saw back then! But, I really can't believe what I drew.Kay:Picture, what picture?Larry:This one, right here!Edgeworth:Wh... What! What is this disturbing picture!? Is that sculpture weeping tears of blood?Kay:Laurice! ...This picture is scary!Larry:Kay! It scared me too! This Gemini Sculpture suddenly transformed into a goddess right before my eyes. I couldn't help but scream.Edgeworth:(...So the victim collapsing wasn't what surprised him.) What do you mean when you say \"transformed\"?Larry:I don't really understand it myself! The lower half of its body just turned into a fish!Ray:A fish goddess... That would be the Pisces Sculpture, wouldn't it. In mythology, Pisces represents the fish that a goddess and her son transform into.Kay:Really! So Pisces isn't just a couple of ordinary fish?Larry:Edgey... you don't think that sculpture is cursed, do you? Those tears of blood turned the Gemini Sculpture into a fish.Edgeworth:...Preposterous. You simply mistook the Pisces Sculpture for the Gemini one.Pisces Sketch data jotted down in my Organizer.Kay:Oh. You put the sketch in your Organizer?Edgeworth:Hmph... Even a sketch like this can be used as scrap paper, after all.Larry:How could you!Ray:But, it's strange. Why did only the lower half of the sculpture transform? Uncle Ray is a bit curious about what went on in the Autumn Palace.Edgeworth:(Indeed... I wonder if someone tampered with the Pisces Sculpture.) Yes. Edgeworth here.Gumshoe:Mr. Edgeworth! We've finished searching the room! The poison gas isn't a threat anymore, so you can enter the crime scene!Edgeworth:Right. Good work, Detective. ...It seems we can enter the Autumn Palace now.Ray:Nice timing, Mr. Detective.Kay:Let's go right now! I wanna see the Pisces Sculpture!Larry:If Kay's going, I'm going too.Edgeworth:(...I was planning on bringing him along anyway.) Right then, let's proceed to the Autumn Palace.Edgeworth:So this is the Autumn Palace... (It certainly does resemble the Winter Palace.)Gumshoe:I've been waiting, sir! ...Huh? Aren't you... that Harry Butz guy!Larry:Wrong! I'm Laurice Deauxnim!Edgeworth:.....Never mind that, Detective. Your report, if you please.Gumshoe:...Roger that, sir! Err... We discovered a used gas burner during our investigation. The nozzle was still warm when we found it, so it may be related to the incident.Edgeworth:...Hmm. (Was it used to heat something?)Used Gas Burner data jotted down in my Organizer.Edgeworth:Was that ladder always there on the ground?Gumshoe:It was probably used by the person who set off the poison gas. The poison gas was released when someone lifted the lid off that glass case, sir!Edgeworth:Hm...?\u00a0! The Pisces Sculpture...!Gumshoe:Huh? Seems like you know about it, sir. Well then, do you know what the sculpture next to it is?Edgeworth:Since we're in the Autumn Palace, it would probably be the Capricorn Sculpture.Gumshoe:As expected of Mr. Edgeworth! I thought it was Taurus myself. I was thrown off as it was covered by this weird cloth!Ray:The fluorescent cloth! I wonder what it's doing here.Edgeworth:(Evidence from the IS-7 Incident...!)Fluorescent Cloth data jotted down in my Organizer.Gumshoe:No matter what it is or how it got here... The sculptures in this room are all covered with this fluorescent cloth.Examine evidenceBlue cloth of Fluorescent ClothEdgeworth:A blue cloth... I guess this kind of relaxing color is nice once in awhile.Ray:Miles. You're starting to sound like your old man.Edgeworth:(I don't want to hear that from Mr. Shields...)Glowing cloth of Fluorescent ClothEdgeworth:The cloth is glowing with a light blue aura.Ray:According to the detective's report, it was wrapped around the statue like this.Edgeworth:...So it would seem. (How is this related to our case?)Switches on machine of Fluorescent ClothEdgeworth:According to Mr. Shields, this allows you to change the color of the cloth. Let me try it out. Hmm. The cloth has started to glow.Kay:And because they're hidden, it makes me want to see them even more.Gumshoe:Let's take a look! I'll just get this cloth off.Kay:Wow! They're beautiful!Edgeworth:You don't think... the \"transformation\" Larry saw... Was, in fact, the moment the cloth wrapped around the lower half of Pisces fell...?Larry:See, Edgey! It wasn't a mirage or a mistake after all!Edgeworth:Ngh...!Ray:Hey... Miles. There sure is something strange about this room. It looks exactly the same as the Winter Palace we were in just a moment ago.Edgeworth:...Yes. I agree. Perhaps the sculptures were hidden to make it look like the Winter Palace. If you wrap the cloth around the lower half of the Pisces Sculpture, it looks like Gemini.Ray:Capricorn is a half-fish too. Hide the lower half and it resembles Taurus. The remaining two, which couldn't be altered with trickery, were covered up.Edgeworth:The Autumn Palace was made to look like the Winter Palace. So it seems... Mr. Shields. It looks like we'll need to conduct an investigation of the Autumn Palace too.Edgeworth:Mr. Debeste and Judge Courtney...!Debeste:Hey, hey, hey! You guys again!? This is a problem. You see, this is MY crime scene.Courtney:Mr. Edgeworth... it seems my power is insufficient. If you're here, then it would appear that you still haven't understood my warnings.Edgeworth:Ngh...!Courtney:Furthermore... you know full well your reckless actions will cause trouble for that detective. In the name of the Goddess of Law, I must pass judgement.Gumshoe:You've got it all wrong, pal! I was the one who asked Mr. Edgeworth to investigate!Debeste:Really? Well then, flatfoot, I'll have to do \"that\".Gumshoe:\"That\"...?Debeste:Yeah, \"that\"... err. Right! Cut your salary! Looking forward to your next payday!? I've always wanted to say that!Gumshoe:Uugh... You're the last person I want cutting my salary, pal.Edgeworth:Hold it, Debeste. I am only cooperating with the police as a witness to this incident. ...Detective Gumshoe is not to blame.Debeste:Hmmm. So that's how it is. Well then, should I be raising his salary?Edgeworth:...No, that's not what I meant.Gumshoe:But, it would be really nice to get my salary raised.Courtney:Your mercy is deeply moving, Sebastian. But past transgressions must lead to future judgement. Prosecutor Edgeworth, and all in his company. Depart at once from this holy site.Kay:B-But that's! We only just got here!Courtney:The one given the Goddess of Law's blessing for this incident was Sebastian.Edgeworth:In other words, Mr. Debeste is the prosecutor in charge of this case...Debeste:That's right, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening performance is over! Besides, I've already got my eyes set on the culprit!Gumshoe:Whaaaaaaat!? Wh-Who, pal?Debeste:Well, naturally! ...That artist!Larry:M... Me? Hey! What's going on Edgey!Edgeworth:Don't ask me. I can't understand his reasoning.Debeste:Tsk tsk tsk... If you can't understand how the best prosecutor thinks, it simply shows how inculpable you are.Edgeworth:(It seems he doesn't know what \"inculpable\" even means...)Courtney:...That's right, Sebastian. Prosecutor Edgeworth is quite \"incapable\".Debeste:Umm. Yes! He's incapable!Kay:...She just nonchalantly corrected him.Debeste:Don't underestimate my intelligence gathering skills! I just came from the infirmary and asked the doctor there... ...about the cause of the poison gas!Edgeworth:...And what was the cause?Debeste:Err. Some \"normal\" substance... What was its name again? H-Hold on a second. I'll call the doctor to make sure.Courtney:Since Sebastian is on the phone, I'll answer for him.Kay:...In that case why didn't you tell us before he called?Courtney:The poison gas was caused by the mixing of two different types of chemicals. Their names are Normallium and Fatallium.Kay:So, what are those chemicals exactly?Courtney:Normallium is a red liquid that's commonly used in everyday products. It can be found in paint and detergent, among other things, but it is not toxic by itself.Edgeworth:...So you're saying that it's a substance readily available to anyone.Courtney:Yes. But Fatallium, on the other hand, is not so easy to obtain.Kay:Its name sure sounds dangerous. What's it used for?Courtney:It is the active ingredient of a white pesticide known as Megatoxin X. Fatallium itself also has a deep white color, but it's not readily sold in stores. It's nearly impossible to obtain domestically. Right now, we are looking into how this chemical was obtained.Poison Gas data jotted down in my Organizer.Debeste:OK! I've finally found out the names of those chemicals!Edgeworth:...Judge Courtney has already told us. We don't need to hear it again.Debeste:Eh. ...Fine, then. I'll cut to the chase! You know that Normallium from the poison gas is also used in paint, right? Today, out of everyone who visited the art gallery, the only one carrying paint... ...was that artist!Larry:Y-You're treating me as the culprit just because of that!Debeste:I object... to the red paint on the palette you're carrying!Larry:Hey, Edgey... Don't you think this prosecutor is kind of an idiot?Edgeworth:Indeed. Although I've known him for a short time, his logic is always absurd.Debeste:Hey! Don't ignore me!Courtney:It's alright, Sebastian. They're only doing it because they're afraid of you. Like the first star to appear at night, show us reasoning that shines the best.Debeste:The first star shines best... Not bad. Hey, you guys better listen up too!-- Mr. Debeste's Shining Logic --Debeste:That artist was the \"first\" to discover the victim, so naturally he's the \"best\" suspect!The poison gas was caused by Normallium, a chemical found in paint, right?As he was carrying paint near the victim, he would've had the \"best\" chance.The paint, along with being the first witness! ...That pretty much proves he's the culprit!Debeste:...So! What do you think, Justine?Courtney:...We cannot ignore the possibility. Well then, Mr. Artist. Please tell us the truth. Did you leave red paint at the crime scene? Or else... Did you cause the poison gas to go off?Larry:The only thing I leave behind is my \"bond of love\" with you...Courtney:...Please watch what you say. My gavel is already prepared to declare you guilty.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:Please pay no heed to this man's statements.Debeste:Debeste:Hey, hey, you guys! Ignoring my reasoning just because it's flawless won't do you any good. Mr. Edgeworth, if you've already admitted defeat, you should take your leave!Edgeworth:Hmph. Even though I don't really have time to deal with your ridiculous reasoning...Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Indeed, at first glance this man seems suspicious, however... Debeste: Debeste: At \"first\" glance...? Ugh... What's with that \"first\" all of a sudden! You! Are you trying to steal my spot as the star that shines \"best\"!? Larry: Huh? Would that make me the \"best\" artist? Edgeworth: ...Larry! Don't make this any more confusing than it already is! Mr. Debeste, continue your reasoning, now!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Yes. Apparently, Normallium is used in many everyday products. Debeste: Right! So the red paint is definitely suspicious! Kay: But, it's also used in things other than paint, right? Debeste: Hm. I guess you have a point. ...What do you think, Justine? Courtney: That's right. Normallium is also used in detergent, for example. Edgeworth: In other words... it might not have been paint that caused the gas. Debeste: Th-That's not true! Let me finish my reasoning!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Even if paint is the cause of the poison gas, that does not mean he is guilty. Debeste: Ha ha! Well then, if the paint is NOT the cause, that doesn't mean he's innocent either! Kay: Now he's just trying to sound clever. Mimicking what Mr. Edgeworth says won't make you look cool at all! Edgeworth: ...Kay, please don't make my statements look bad. Debeste: Now then! It's about time... to wrap up my shining logic!Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you truly claim that Larry is the culprit based on just that? Debeste: Huh? You got a problem with that? ...If you have a problem, then present evidence! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth. It looks like he really wants you to do that. Edgeworth: Indeed. Then I will do as he wishes and present evidence.Edgeworth: It seems he doesn't pay much attention to what other people are saying. There is a clear contradiction in Mr. Debeste's logic.Kay: Why'd he even bother making the phone call?Edgeworth: (I'll finish this quickly. ...This is a waste of time.)",

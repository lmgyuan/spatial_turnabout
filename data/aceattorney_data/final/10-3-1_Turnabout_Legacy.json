To find out the truth of 18 years ago...\nApril 2, 10:05 AMZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront side of Prosecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.\n\n\n\n\nBack side of Prosecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nEach Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Shields, isn't it about time you told me what this is all about? Why did you bring me to this museum with you?\nRay:\nYou're not busy now, are you Miles? I thought it would be nice if we could share the romance of the constellations together.\nEdgeworth:\n...I beg your pardon, but I would like to leave.\nRay:\nSorry, sorry. It was just a joke. Do you know about the final case your father worked on? The \"IS-7 Incident\"?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Manfred von Karma showed it to me immediately after I became a prosecutor. I reviewed the case file again last night, after you invited me here. And... while I don't remember it very well, I also had been in attendance at the trial back then. (When I was young... I loved watching my father do battle in the courtroom. During that trial, it was my father, the defense attorney Gregory Edgeworth against... ...my former mentor, Prosecutor Manfred von Karma. And while the trial ended with the defendant being declared guilty...)\nRay:\nI see... So you were there too, at Gregory's final trial. In that case, I'll cut to the chase and tell you what you want to know. The truth about the \"IS-7 Incident\". It happened 18 years ago, during the winter... All the buildings were covered in snow, coating the entire town like a layer of frosting. And it was in this very place, that the incident occurred. This was all before Uncle Ray became a defense attorney...\n-- 18 Years Ago --\nDecember 24, 5:00 PMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront side of Attorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nThe defense attorney's badge is shaped like a sunflower. Does the shape have any special meaning?\nGregory:\nWell. A sunflower always points towards the sun, right? From there, it's said to represent \"freedom\" and \"justice\".\nRay:\nThen, I'll also aim towards becoming a defense attorney, just like a sunflower!\nGregory:\nHe he... I look forward to it.\n\n\n\n\nBack side of Attorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nThe number engraved on the back, is it like the badge's ID number?\nGregory:\nYes. However, the number itself has no special meaning.\nRay:\nI'd like to see a badge with matching numbers.\nGregory:\n(That... would be a rare sight indeed.)\nRay:\nMr. Edgeworth. This request sure was sudden, don't you think?\nGregory:\nIndeed. We were contacted immediately after the client was arrested.\nGregory:\nMy name is Gregory Edgeworth. I am a defense attorney. I brought my assistant, Raymond, with me to meet our client, but...\nRay:\nA murder on Christmas Eve! This is just too much!\n???:\n♪ Ahh... In the darkneeeess... A miraculous meetiiiiiing... ♬ ♬ Welcome one and aaaall to the visitor's roooom! ♪\nRay:\nA-Amazning! So this is what meeting a client is like! It all happened so suddenly, I was completely surprised!\nGregory:\n(...I'm also surprised.)\n???:\nA thousand pardons for startling you. I am merely expressing my happiness through song. Welcome one and all... I greatly appreciate you coming.\nGregory:\nSo you're the client for this case...?\n???:\nIndeed.\nGregory:\nMy name is Gregory Edgeworth. I'm a defense attorney. I will be representing you in court. This is my assistant, Raymond Shields.\nRay:\nN-Nice to meet you! I... um...! I'll do my best to help you!\nGregory:\nRelax, Raymond. ...Please excuse his jitters. He's working part time at my office as an apprentice. I thought I'd let him assist me in this investigation.\n???:\nSo, Mr. Gregory and Raymond, correct? I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.\nGregory:\n(My job involves saving my clients from crimes in which they were falsely accused. First, I should determine if he is truly innocent.) First, I would like to know more about you.\n???:\nAh, I have forgotten to introduce myself. My name is Jeffrey Master.\nRay:\nWhat!? You mean you're... \"Master Jeff\"!? \"The World's Greatest Pastry Chef\" Jeff Master the Master Chef...?\nMaster:\nYes... I am honored that you have heard of me. All my fans call me \"Master Jeff\".\nRay:\nWowzers! I'm totally star-struck! I can't believe I get to meet Master Jeff!\nGregory:\n(Raymond seems to know quite a bit about Mr. Master.)\nRay:\nMaster Jeff makes fantastic desserts while putting on a song and dance show!\nWhat's for dessert today?\nRay:\nMacaroons and waffles ♬ Light and fluffy chiffon cake!\nMaster:\nHappiness for one and all ♪ The sweetest temptations... There!\nRay:\nWhere?\nMaster:\nOver there! ♬ Take a peek inside the oven!\n*ding*\nLook! It's freshly baked desserts! ♬\nGregory:\n...! (I got caught up in their song myself.)\nRay:\nWahooo! I'm so happy that I got to sing with Master Jeff! It's my dream come true!\nMaster:\nHo ho... Thank you. I am happy to hear that as well.\nGregory:\n...Mr. Master. Raymond. Shall we return to the matter at hand?\nMaster:\nYes, of course. My sincerest apologies for making you wait. Now, where should we start?\nJeff Master\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nYou are the world's greatest pastry chef, but you are also skilled in song and dance?\nMaster:\nYes! When I'm having a good time, my body just moves to the rhythm by itself.\nGregory:\nYou seem to enjoy making desserts from the bottom of your heart.\nMaster:\nHo ho... If you don't have a good time making desserts, you won't make anything good. Creating desserts that bring happiness to one and all is my purpose in life.\nRay:\nMaster Jeff's desserts are practically works of art! They sparkle and look so delicious... He's so famous for his dreamlike desserts!\nGregory:\n(Bringing happiness to all with his dreamlike desserts, huh?)\nAbout the case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThe incident occurred in your estate, is that correct?\nMaster:\nYes... That's where the \"Great Dessert Contest\" was being held... It seems that the body was discovered in one of my creations.\nRay:\nThey found it in one of your desserts!?\nMaster:\nFor that reason, I was arrested by the detective in charge of the initial investigation. ...I would never do something as vile as robbing someone of their life. I am certain that the police will also realize that they have made a mistake.\nRay:\nR-Really...?\nGregory:\nHmm... Do you know anything about the victim?\nMaster:\nHe was a man named... Isaac Frost. He was one of the competitors in the contest. He was a wonderful man who made desserts of the highest beauty. Why did he have to die...?\nGregory:\n...I see. (He truly seems to be grieving over the victim's death...)\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster:\nThank you very much for accepting my request to serve as my defense attorney.\nGregory:\n...The scale engraved on this badge represents \"truth\" and \"fairness\". As long as you are innocent, I will see to it that you receive a fair verdict. So please, entrust your faith to me and wait patiently.\nMaster:\nYes...! Thank you for your assistance.\n(Clearing all \"Talk\" options leads to:)\nGregory:\n(...I believe I have a sufficient understanding of Mr. Master's personality.) Mr. Master, before I accept your request, there is one final matter I must confirm. You did not kill Mr. Frost. ...Can I take your word for it?\nMaster:\nYes. That is correct. I did not kill him. No matter what happens, I would never take another person's life.\nGregory:\n..... (Those aren't the eyes of a liar.) I understand. I believe you. Thank you very much for taking the time to talk with us.\nMaster:\nThe pleasure is all mine. I am grateful to speak with someone other than a detective.\nGregory:\nNext, we shall begin our investigation of the crime scene. ...We will report back with our findings once we have finished.\nMaster:\nMr. Gregory, Raymond. I wish you good luck.\nDecember 24, 6:00 PMContest VenueFountain Patio\nRay:\nWhew, it sure is cold outside. I didn't expect it to be snowing this hard.\nGregory:\nIndeed. A blizzard like this will probably not clear up for a while.\nRay:\nBut even so, this mansion is ginormous! So this is what Master Jeff's place is like, huh?\nGregory:\nIf you're going to hold a contest in your own home, you would need this much space, after all.\n???:\n♬ La, la, laaa~ Welcome! Thank you for coming! Eek! Oh my! Are you okay? I-I'm so very sorry! Would you happen to be Monsieur Edgeworth?\nGregory:\nYes, I am Gregory Edgeworth.\nRay:\nAnd I'm his assistant, Raymond Shields!\nKate:\nGreetings and welcome, Monsieur Edgeworth and Monsieur Shields. Please call me Katherine Hall! I am in charge of the household affairs of this estate, and am also Monsieur Master's assistant.\nRay:\nAhhh! No way! You're the famous \"Kate\", aren't you?\nKate:\nYou know of me?\nRay:\nOf course I do! I see you on TV all the time! I'm a big fan of \"Piece of Cake\"!\nKate:\nOh, goodness! I'm glad to hear that you're a fan!\nGregory:\n...Tell me, what is this \"Piece of Cake\"?\nRay:\nIt's a TV show that's hugely popular with the kids! Master Jeff and Kate sing and dance while they make delicious treats. Just like this!\nWhat's for dessert today?\nRay:\n♪ Cookies and caramel ♬ Rich and feathery cream puffs!\nKate:\nLet's make it together! ♪ A delectable paradise... Here!\nRay:\nThere!\nKate:\nEverywhere! ♬ ♪ You just open up the oven!\n*ding*\n♪ Now! It's time for dessert! ♬\nKate:\nOh, Monsieur Shields! That was incredible!\nRay:\nHe he he! I always practice along with the show.\nGregory:\n..... (Maybe I should tell my son about this show.)\nRay:\nBut man, doing this dance repeatedly sure works up your appetite.\nKate:\nAh! Pardon my inconsideration! I've forgotten to take care of our guests! Please relax and have some tea.\n...*clatter, clatter*...\nGregory:\nOh... This is some fine Ceylon tea... I hear the aroma of citrus does wonders for your concentration.\nRay:\nI see... So this is what Ceylon tea smells like.\nGregory:\nOh? These saucers are chilled.\nKate:\nYes. They help cool the tea more quickly for people who are bad with hot beverages.\nGregory:\nI see... These tea cups also have a wonderful design.\nKate:\nOh, thank you very much! They are one of the few pride and joys of our estate, ordered directly from France! They were made by the famed sculptor Pierre Hoquet. They are my absolute favorite articles of tableware.\nGregory:\n...You seem to greatly appreciate this man's works.\nKate:\nYes! They are like treasures to me.\nGregory:\n(She appears to be very honest about what she likes.) Thank you, Ms. Hall, but it's time for us to move on to business. Are there any details that you can give us about the incident?\nKate:\nAh... You're right. I sometimes get so distracted welcoming guests that I forget myself. To tell the truth, I was the one who discovered Monsieur Frost's body.\nGregory:\nSo you were the first one to discover the body? It is true that the body was discovered in one of Mr. Master's desserts?\nKate:\nYes... It was during the judging of the Great Dessert Contest. I heard the sound of something breaking from Monsieur Master's room.\nKate:\n...Monsieur Master? Are you in here? Eek...!\nKate:\nWhen I looked inside the room, I saw Monsieur Frost's body inside the treasure chest...\nGregory:\n...Thank you very much. I'm sorry to have made you recall such painful memories.\nKate:\nNo... I should be the one apologizing for not being much help.\nGregory:\nNow then, I believe it's time for us to start investigating the crime scene.\nKate:\nMonsieur Edgeworth, Monsieur Shields. Please find some way to save Monsieur Master. Monsieur Master is not someone who could commit murder!\nGregory:\n...Yes. Of course.\nRay:\nJust leave it to us!\nKate:\nThen I shall entrust it to you. If you'll excuse me, I have to continue serving tea to the other inspectors.\nGregory:\nRaymond, let's head to the crime scene.\nRay:\nYes, sir! Mr. Edgeworth!\nDecember 24, 6:30 PMContest VenueMaster's Room\nRay:\nWow! This whole thing is made of chocolate! I can't believe I'm actually seeing Master Jeff's desserts up close!\nGregory:\nWere this not the scene of a murder, I admit, I too would have delighted in this occasion.\nRay:\nUuugh... Now that you've reminded me it's a murder scene, I'm getting shivers down my spine.\nGregory:\n...Perhaps it's because this room is cold to begin with?\nRay:\nNow that you mention it, this room really is cold. *A-ACHOO*\n???:\n...Never expected the defense attorney to show up so early.\nGregory:\nPleased to meet you. I'm Jeff Master's defense attorney, Gregory Edgeworth. This is my assistant, Raymond.\nRay:\nHow do you do!\nBadd:\n...Detective Tyrell Badd. Homicide.\nRay:\nMr. Badd, the detective in charge of this case... A man of few words... Mmm... Tastes kinda bitter...\nBadd:\nHe ate... the paper...!\nGregory:\nHe likes to digest his memos in his stomach as well as in his mind... It's just a strange habit of his. Please don't be too concerned. (It would probably be too much to ask him not to be concerned at all...) More importantly... Detective Badd. Will you give us permission to participate in the investigation?\nBadd:\n...Permission denied.\nRay:\nWh-Why!? Mr. Edgeworth is Master Jeff's defense attorney!\nBadd:\nDefense attorneys... plant false evidence... to try and get their \"Not Guilty\" verdict. I don't want... their kind to disturb the crime scene...\nRay:\nMr. Edgeworth would never use false evidence to defend his client!\nBadd:\nHeh... I can't trust that, coming from a defense attorney...\nGregory:\nDo the police still suspect Mr. Master, even after the investigation?\nBadd:\n.....If we didn't, we wouldn't have arrested him...\nGregory:\nI believe that Mr. Master is innocent. That's why I have come to investigate.\nBadd:\nBelieving in his innocence... without investigating the crime scene... How naïve...\nGregory:\n...That's why I would like your permission to investigate. By investigating the crime scene, I want to ascertain if my thinking was naïve or not.\nBadd:\n...Hmph. ...So you don't intend to leave until you've investigated the crime scene...?\nGregory:\nYes.\nBadd:\n...Tch... Fine then... I will give you permission to investigate the crime scene.\nGregory:\n! Thank you.\nBadd:\nBut, I'll be accompanying you. ...I can't trust you defense attorneys, after all! ...If you understand that, you... can begin your investigation.\nRay:\nThat's... a lollipop?\nGregory:\n(...I'm a little surprised myself.) Alright, let's begin the investigation. Raymond, be sure to take notes on the case.\nRay:\nLeave it to me, Mr. Edgeworth!\nBadd:\nJust... begin already...\nBegin Investigation\nContest VenueMaster's Room\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Breaking sound\" and \"Broken stand\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nDue to the broken stand, the ship lost its balance... It would seem Ms. Hall entered the room upon hearing the ship collapse.\nBadd:\nYeah... When Ms. Hall entered the room, the ship had already fallen over...\nGregory:\nAt any rate, I wonder why the stand broke (Why the stand broke? - The ship fell over because the stand broke. Why did it break?)?\nBadd:\n...Maybe there was something wrong with the ship's balance in the first place...\nGregory:\n(Is that really true...?)\n\n\n\n\n\"Why the stand broke?\" and \"Tampered desserts\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nEach of Mr. Master's works had a piece that was missing. Add to that the fact that the ship's chocolate stand was broken... I think we can surmise that someone ransacked this room.\nRay:\nAnd, the one who did it could be the true culprit!\nGregory:\n...That I don't know. But I think it's safe to say that the ship stand got broken when the room was ransacked. (And, when the ship fell over it broke the treasure chest lid... I expect that the lid of the treasure chest was originally closed.)\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\n...What?\n\n\n\nNotice anything?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\nYour way of investigating is... to soft. An investigation is like a popsicle... Walk around the crime scene... and investigate. ...Talk with... the people involved. If you do that... little by little, you'll lick it down to its core... And the truth will be written... on the end of the popsicle stick.\nGregory:\n...I pray that it doesn't say, \"The truth was lost for all eternity.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe crime scene (after examining outline and broken stand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIs it safe to assume that the state of the crime scene has been preserved?\nBadd:\nCrime scene preservation... Is the most important rule of an investigation. The body has been recovered, but... besides that... it's been left untouched...\nGregory:\nIf possible, could you tell me about the condition of the body in more detail?\nBadd:\nMs. Hall... took a photo of it. ...Be content with that, defense attorney.\nGregory:\n(Does this detective have a grudge against defense attorneys? I guess I have no choice but to investigate the contradictions of the crime scene myself...)\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\n...Working with defense attorneys... isn't worth it... They go through the crime scene as they please... and interpret their findings to their favor.\nGregory:\nDo you also feel that way about me?\nBadd:\n...Hmm.\nGregory:\n(...He didn't confirm or deny it.)\n\n\n\n\nSignet Crest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\n...It's a strange seal. If this were a stamp, it would imprint \"PH\"...\nGregory:\nPerhaps it's meant to be seen as it is. In that case, it would read \"H9\"...\nBadd:\nHits... Nine hits... An explosive batter... No, that's not it...\nGregory:\n(Does Detective Badd like baseball...?)\n\n\n\n\nCrime Scene Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\nThere are several... puzzling points... in this case...\nGregory:\nI would like a little more information on the state of the crime scene.\nBadd:\nYou have... your own two feet. Why don't you go investigate yourself... That's how... a detective does things...\nGregory:\nWe may be in different positions, but we both want to know the truth of this case. Wouldn't it be better if you cooperated a bit more?\nBadd:\n.....\nGregory:\n(He's fallen silent as a stone. A rather large stone. ...Is that also how a detective does things?)\n\n\n\n\nFrame Fingermarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\nIt seems the culprit... prepared gloves in advance... That's why only fingermarks... and no fingerprints were left behind...\nGregory:\nCould you get any information from the size of the fingers?\nBadd:\n...That would be difficult. In other words... this evidence is meaningless.\nGregory:\nIt's a bit early to decide that. This could also become a clue. It tells us, the culprit \"did not leave fingerprints.\"\nBadd:\nHmph... You always have a comeback. It's because you're a defense attorney...\nGregory:\nHeh... I'll take that as a compliment.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nI would like to ask your opinion about this piece of evidence.\nBadd:\n...I refuse... I hate... pointless chatter...\nGregory:\n(I guess he's not interested in things that he doesn't think are related to the case.)\nSitting forensics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nWhat are you investigating?\nForensics:\nSir! I'm checking the temperature of the stream!\nBadd:\n...What have you learned?\nForensics:\nSir! This stream... has warm water! The stream is connected to the fountain in the patio, and runs through every room.\nGregory:\nIt's an unusual construction for a room.\nBadd:\nThe minds of the rich... I'll never understand.\nForensics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\n...What about over here? Was there nothing suspicious in the cupboard?\nForensics:\nNo, sir!\nBadd:\n...So there was something?\nForensics:\nOh, uh... No. Only things like cooking burners and tableware were placed here!\nBadd:\n...I see. Defense attorney, was there nothing that you noticed?\nGregory:\nNo.\nBadd:\n...So you did notice something?\nGregory:\nOh, no... I didn't notice anything.\nBadd:\n...Everyone's always giving replies that are difficult to understand...\nGregory:\n(I think it's your way of asking that's bad...)\nSailing equipments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIt appears to be a display of sailing equipment.\nBadd:\nThere's also the possibility... that one of these is the murder weapon...\nGregory:\nNo... It looks like these pieces were all made out of chocolate. You can't beat someone to death with these.\nBadd:\nTch...! Misleading...\nGregory:\n(At any rate, they all have such good workmanship that they look just like the real thing. It really speaks about the level of skill Mr. Master has in his craft.)\nShip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nSo this was where the body was discovered?\nBadd:\nYeah... The body has been removed... but otherwise... the crime scene has remained untouched.\n\n\n\nBefore deducing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nAfter deducing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nShip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nTo build such a large ship out of chocolate is magnificent.\nRay:\nAs expected of Master Jeff! I want to try eating it... Although I have no idea where to start eating it from...\nBadd:\nAnywhere should be fine, but if you start eating the crime scene... I'll make you leave...\nRay:\nUwaah! Don't glare at me! Can't you tell it was a joke?\nGregory:\n(...I'd like Raymond to be just a little bit calmer.)\n\n\n\n\nOutline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIt seems that the body was discovered inside this chocolate treasure chest.\nBadd:\n...The person who discovered it was Ms. Hall...\n\n\nKate:\n...Monsieur Master? Are you in here? Eek...!\n\n\nBadd:\nShe heard the sound of something breaking (Breaking sound - What was the sound that came from Mr. Master's room?)... inside this room... and came in.\nGregory:\n(...I would like a little more information about this.) Hm. What's this? Something has been dropped inside the treasure chest. Hm. This is...? It seems to be some kind of seal, with a design and initials carved into it.\nRay:\nIt looks like a signet crest. Was it the victim's?\nBadd:\n...I don't know if it was the victim's, but we should take it for now...\nSignet Crest added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nBroken stand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIt seems that the stand supporting the ship has been broken (Broken stand - The stand that supported the ship was broken and caused the ship to tip over.).\nRay:\nThe ship tipped over and broke the treasure chest, didn't it? Ah! M-Maybe! Could the victim have been crushed by the ship and killed?\nGregory:\n...If that were the case, this would have been an accidental death.\nBadd:\n...You two... aren't serious about that, right?\nGregory:\nWell. We were only discussing one of the possibilities.\nRay:\n...I was being pretty serious though.\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\"The Voyage of the Good Ship Red Rum\" is written here...\nBadd:\n\"It sailed... the Seven Seas and in the end finally found... a huge treasure. Modeled after... the glory of an ancient adventurer.\" ...It's written here...\nGregory:\nSo he failed six times... What an unlucky captain.\nBadd:\n...No matter how many times he went on a fool's errand... In the end he reached the truth... ...It's just like... a detective's spirit...!\nGregory:\n(Did detectives even exist... during the ancient times?)\n\n\n(Examining outline and broken stand leads to:)\nGregory:\nDetective Badd. I would like you to tell me about the state of the victim.\nBadd:\nIf you mean a photo of the body... Here. Look at it... all you like. It seems the victim... was beaten to death (Beaten to death - The victim appears to have been beaten to death with a blunt object.) with a blunt object.\nGregory:\nHas the murder weapon been found?\nBadd:\n...You... should try asking the prosecutor in charge later...\nGregory:\n(...It seems he doesn't intend to tell me frankly.) So... May I borrow this photograph?\nBadd:\nSure... It's not a photo that was taken by the police... Ms. Hall took a photo of the body with an instant camera when she discovered it.\nRay:\nAn instant camera... Is that like a disposable camera?\nGregory:\nAn instant camera is a camera that can develop its film right after taking a picture.\nRay:\nEh! Such a convenient camera exists!?\nGregory:\n(Anyway, let's go over the state of the crime scene a bit. This photo... upon closer examination, contradicts the state of the crime scene. I'll have to deduce the contradiction to resolve this matter.)\nCrime Scene Notes added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\nDeduce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)\n\n\n\nDeduce missing chocolate piece on the bottom of the chest and present Crime Scene Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Are you sure the only thing the police removed from the crime scene was the body?\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nGregory:\nThis part is contradictory... It contradicts this piece of evidence!\nBadd:\nThis ship is \"confectionery\"... How sweet. Otherwise... we could board the ship... and sail down the chocolate river.\nGregory:\n(What an unpleasant dismissal... Let's calm down, and inspect the crime scene once more. It feels like something that was here before isn't anymore...)\n\n\nGregory:\nAre you sure the only thing the police removed from the crime scene was the body?\nBadd:\nAh... They also took away the piece of cloth the body was wrapped in.\nGregory:\nIn that case, a major \"contradiction\" has been created at the crime scene.\nBadd:\nContradiction...?\nGregory:\nDetective Badd. Please look at the crime scene carefully once more. The bloodstain that should have remained at the crime scene has disappeared!\nBadd:\n...! I definitely... didn't get any reports about the bloodstain being cleaned up... I'll check... with forensics.\nRay:\nMr. Edgeworth. What happened?\nGregory:\nComparing the photo and the crime scene, something struck me as being out of place. In the photo, the chocolate underneath the body remained intact inside the treasure chest. ...however, in the actual crime scene, it's missing.\nRay:\n! The chocolate with the bloodstain has completely vanished.\nGregory:\nYes. Did the police remove it, or was this the work of the criminal...?\nBadd:\nAccording to forensics... no one has cleaned upo any bloodstains...\nGregory:\n...I see. Well, that would mean someone erased the bloodstain.\nBadd:\n...Who knows...\nCrime Scene Notes updated in the Court Record.\nRaymond Shields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nThis is an actual crime scene! I'm so excited!\nGregory:\nThis isn't a game, Raymond. Please be more serious.\nRay:\nYes, sir! I'm taking a memo right now!\nGregory:\nOh... What exactly are you writing?\nRay:\nI'm copying down this dessert recipe over here!\nGregory:\n...Raymond. Please be more serious.\nRay:\nYes, sir...\nRed chef\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nExcuse me, but you are...?\n???:\n..... Nnph. My apologies. I was meditating. What did you ask, Sir Detective?\nGregory:\nActually, I'm a defense attorney. My name is Gregory Edgeworth.\nRay:\nI'm his assistant, Raymond!\nGusto:\nPardon my late introduction. My name is Carmelo Gusto. I am one of the pastry chefs participating in this contest.\nRay:\nWhat kind of desserts do you make, Mr. Gusto?\nGusto:\n...My specialty is making desserts out of candy.\nRay:\nAwww! What a cute seahorse!\nGusto:\nIt was meant to be a \"dragon\" dancing in the sky...\nRay:\nEh! Th-This is a \"dragon\"...?\nGregory:\n(I think it would fit better in the ocean than in the sky...)\nGusto:\nI know all too well that design is my weak point! ...I plan to study design and undergo training in Zheng Fa once things settle down here.\nGregory:\n(I probably shouldn't touch the subject of design any further.) Mr. Gusto, if you aren't related to the investigation, why are you in this room...?\nGusto:\nSir Detective wanted to know more about the desserts in this room, so he asked me to come.\nGregory:\n(Since he's one of the contestants, he might know something...)\n\n\n\nCarmelo Gusto\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nMr. Gusto, those instruments you use are quite unusual.\nGusto:\nThese instruments are called \"candy pumps\", and they pump air into the candy.\nRay:\nThey kinda look like swords. They're so cool!\nGusto:\nIndeed. Ever since I began using them, no day has gone by where I didn't receive a burn or wound! That's why I wear red clothes! So that not a single stain will ever show on me! Making desserts is serious business... I am always training!\nGregory:\n(...Does he injure himself because he hasn't trained enough?)\n\n\n\n\nThe contest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nCan you tell me about the Great Dessert Contest that was held here? From the looks of this room, it seems the desserts weren't just for eating.\nGusto:\nThe exhibition Sir Master held was a \"contest in the art of dessert.\"\nRay:\nThe art of... dessert?\nGusto:\n\"Desserts that are true works of art,\" made solely out of edible materials! The works of art in this room are all made from desserts.\nRay:\nNow that you mention it, the whole room is filled with the smell of chocolate.\nGusto:\nSir Master exhibits great talent in both flavor and design. If you are not able to surpass Sir Master in flavor and design, you will not be able to win.\nRay:\nBeating the world's greatest pastry chef is pretty hard, isn't it...?\nGusto:\n...In other words, if I can surpass Sir Master, I shall become the world's greatest pastry chef. That was the prize of this contest!\nGregory:\nThe prize is the \"Title of the World's Greatest\"...?\nGusto:\nIn addition to that, there is also Sir Master's treasured \"Angel's Recipe\". If you want to learn more about the contest, just look at this piece of paper. These were the rules that were given to the participants of the contest.\nContest Rules added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIs it safe to assume that the state of the crime scene has been preserved?\nGusto:\nSorry, but I do not know much about the incident. I only learned about the incident after the judging had finished.\nGregory:\nHow was the contest judging carried out?\nGusto:\nLet's see... Sir Master started judging at 3 PM. Starting from my room, the judging proceeded in a clockwise direction. I used the room to the right of Sir Master's room, which is the room we're in now. Next, the room of a female pastry chef named Delicia was judged.\nGregory:\nA female pastry chef... What kind of person is she?\nGusto:\n...She is a frightening woman who would do anything to achieve her goal. I heard she used lots of cream to make a fantasy-themed dessert. ...And lastly, Sir Frost's room was judged. His works were frozen statues made from sherbet.\nBadd:\nHall discovered the body... in the middle of... Gusto's judging. She panicked... and because she immediately notified the police... Master... continued judging... without knowledge that the body has been discovered. As a result, Master... judged Frost's room... in Frost's absence. Hmph... It seems we have plenty of room to suspect Master...\nGregory:\n(...I'm lacking in information. It's probably too early to object.)\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGusto:\n...That badge has a rather artistic design. My craftman's spirit is shaking! Mind if I borrow it for a while?\nGregory:\nS-Sorry... This is rather important to me. (It would be unbearable if it got hurt in the candy making process...)\n\n\n\n\nContest Rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGusto:\nThe title of \"World's Greatest Pastry Chef\"... I intend to achieve it through this contest. Afterwards, if I am able to master my design training in Zheng Fa... I shall be recognized as a first-class pastry chef in both cooking and design!\nGregory:\n(...I would think the order would be reversed.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGusto:\n.....Nnph. My apologies. I was meditating. What did you ask, Sir Detective?\nGregory:\nI'm a defense attorney. And about this piece of evidence...\nGusto:\n.....\nGregory:\n(M-Meditating again...? I guess if it doesn't catch his interest greatly, he won't even give it a glance.)\n\n\n\n(Clearing all \"Talk\" options leads to:)\nGregory:\nBy the way, Detective Badd. What were you talking to Mr. Gusto earlier?\nBadd:\nI was asking him about... the chocolate frame hanging on that wall... I thought... something was missing... I thought... if I asked someone who knew a lot about desserts... I could get an answer. ...Although thanks to your arrival, I still haven't gotten my answer yet...\nGregory:\nWell then, since you've been waiting for so long, we can ask him about it, right now.\nBadd:\n...I guess you don't understand sarcasm...\nGregory:\nMr. Gusto, can you assist us with this matter?\nGusto:\nI train in the arts of desserts everyday. If you have a question about desserts, please do not hesitate to ask.\nGregory:\nThank you very much.\nFrame (after clearing all \"Talk\" options of Gusto)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore examining frame and handprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nAfter examining frame and handprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nFrame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nYou can make such a beautiful picture out of chocolate!? As expected of Master Jeff!\nGregory:\n...Is this really chocolate? It looks like an actual picture to me.\nGusto:\nImpressive, Sir Attorney! You noticed well. This picture of an angel is not a dessert, but rather the \"Angel's Recipe\".\nGregory:\nThe \"Angel's Recipe\"... The prize for the contest.\nRay:\nEhh!? This picture isn't made of chocolate!?\nGusto:\nIndeed. Within this chocolate frame lies a recipe book. Sir Master told everyone when he explained the rules of the contest to us in this room.\nGregory:\n(So the contestants knew the recipe was here.)\nBadd:\nHow about it...? This frame... Don't you think it's missing something...?\nGregory:\n(This must be what Detective Badd was asking Mr. Gusto about earlier.) This chocolate frame, there does seem to be a part that's missing.\nBadd:\nThat's... what's been bothering me as well...\nRay:\nEh? ...What's missing?\nGregory:\n(Let me show Raymond the part of the chocolate frame that's missing.)\n\n\n\nPresent missing chocolate leaf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Look closely at this part with the decorations. Can you see that one of them is missing?\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nGregory:\nRaymond. Don't you think there is something missing here?\nRay:\n...Sorry. I don't know much about art. I thought this was one of those \"artistic expressions\" though.\nGregory:\n(...My glasses slipped, and I pointed to the wrong spot.)\nRay:\nUm... There's something missing from the chocolate frame, right?\nGregory:\nThat's right. Even if you don't know the first thing about art, you should understand this.\nLeads back to:\n\"(Let me show Raymond the part of the chocolate frame that's missing.)\"\n\n\nGregory:\nLook closely at this part with the decorations. Can you see that one of them is missing?\nRay:\nIt's true! It's different from the other decorations.\nGusto:\nHm... This imperfect balance in the decorations is not like Sir Master.\nBadd:\n...Upon closer examination, it seems this frame is not the only one with missing parts. ...We need to investigate further.\n\n\nBadd:\nAll the desserts in this room each have one part missing...\nRay:\nWhoa... The candle holder and the sailing tools are all damaged as well! So someone tampered with the crime scene (Tampered desserts - The desserts Mr. Master made were damaged in several places.)?\nGregory:\n...Perhaps.\nBadd:\nMaybe... Master vandalized the room himself to fool us...\nRay:\nMaster Jeff wouldn't do that sort of thing to his desserts!\nGregory:\n(Tampered desserts... I wonder if they are connected to the incident?)\n\n\n\n\nFrame (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGusto:\nThis picture of an angel is not a dessert, but rather the \"Angel's Recipe\".\nGregory:\nThe \"Angel's Recipe\"... The prize for the contest.\nGusto:\nIndeed. Within this chocolate frame lies a recipe book. Sir Master told everyone when he explained the rules of the contest to us in this room.\nGregory:\n(So the contestants knew the recipe was here.)\n\n\n\n\nHandprint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n...These fingermarks are?\nBadd:\nThese are... unidentified fingermarks. ...We don't know who they belong to. Since... no fingerprints were left behind...\nGregory:\n(Fingermarks without fingerprints... These might be related to the case.)\nFrame Fingermarks added to the Court Record.\nRay:\nHmmm. It's a mystery!\nBadd:\nHe was probably wearing gloves...\nRay:\nUgh... Detective Badd lacks dreams and romance.\nGregory:\n(I don't think there are dreams or romance at a murder scene...)\n\n\n\n\nSign on frame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIt seems the title of this work is written here.\nRay:\n\"Angel Caught by Thorns\"... It's an enchanting dessert, isn't it! It feels like my heart has also been caught...!\nGusto:\nQuite...! It seems Sir Assistant has a sense of beauty. Speaking of which, I too have had my heart caught by this dessert.\nRay:\nMr. Edgeworth! Mr. Gusto praised me!\nGregory:\nRaymond... That's not the sort of thing you'd want to blow your own \"thorn\" about.\nGusto:\nHmph...! Sir Defense Attorney, it seems your sense of words is lacking.\nRay:\nMr. Edgeworth made a joke! I'd better make a memo about this!\nGregory:\n(...Exactly which part of what I said was a joke?)\n\n\n\n\nBook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\nThe Captain's log... of a chocolate ship... which is also made out of chocolate... It seems its title is... \"Journal of Regret\"...\nGregory:\n\"Running out of rum while drifting at the Red Sea has really made me red with regret...\" it reads. I don't know what kind of voyage it was, but it doesn't seem very regretful.\n\n\n\n\nCandle holder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\nA dessert... in the shape of a candle holder... huh... It's titled... \"Light of Life\"...\nGregory:\n(It seems that... one of these important lights isn't lit. Is it symbolic, or...?)\n\n\n\n\nFire alarm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThis is a fire alarm.\nBadd:\nAh... Let me say in advance... That's not a dessert... It's the real deal. If you press that... an alarm will sound, and security will be contacted... I understand that you want to press it to see what happens... but please refrain yourself...\nGregory:\nNo, I didn't particularly feel like pressing it.\nBadd:\n...Tch! It's because you're a defense attorney...\nGregory:\n(I don't think being a defense attorney has anything to do with it...)\n\n\n(Examining frame and handprint leads to:)\nRay:\nA... A... Achoo!\nGregory:\nAre you alright, Raymond?\nRay:\nUgh... This room is way too cold!\nGregory:\nThe Fountain Patio wasn't very warm, either... This room certainly is cold. Do you want to wear my coat?\nRay:\nNope! I'm fine! Because that's something that you promised to give me when I become a defense attorney!\nGregory:\nHeh... That's right.\nBadd:\n...Why is the temperature turned down so low...?\nGusto:\nIt's been turned down in order to maintain the chocolate's temperature. ...Why don't you try opening the panel cover on that wall?\nBadd:\nPanel cover...?\nRay:\nWhoa! There's a secret panel hidden there!\nGusto:\nThis control panel is installed in all the rooms Sir Master prepared. So as not to detract from the dessert's presentation, the cover was closed to conceal it.\nGregory:\nWhat does the panel do?\nGusto:\nIt allows you to change the temperature and the lighting in the room. In order to preserve any type of dessert, it can go down to about -22℉.\nGregory:\n...The room would be like a freezer.\nRay:\nIt's set to 59℉! No wonder I thought it was cold. Detective Badd. I'm not allowed to change the temperature... Am I?\nBadd:\nPreserving the crime scene... is the foundation of being a detective...!\nRay:\nBut, I'm not a detective...\nGregory:\nA defense attorney can't recklessly damage a crime scene either.\nGusto:\nIndeed, Sir Assistant. Enduring hardship is also a part of training. In order to preserve chocolate, 59℉ to 64℉ is the ideal temperature.\nBadd:\nHm... The ideal temperature for chocolate. As expected of the dessert chef...\nGusto:\nNo, it is but a trifle. This is basic knowledge that anyone should know if they're a dessert chef.\nBadd:\n...So, what's the ideal temperature for candy and fresh cream?\nGusto:\nAs long as you watch out for humidity and hot temperatures, candy shouldn't melt. For fresh cream, around 50℉ is the ideal temperature.\nBadd:\n...You need to watch out for the humidity and hot temperatures for candy... I see...\nRay:\nDetective Badd. He seemed a bit happy when they were talking about candy.\nGregory:\n(Is candy one of his favorite things...?)\n\n\n\nControl panel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIt seems this control panel can change the temperature and the color of the lights in this room.\nRay:\nThe colors are red, yellow, green, blue, cyan, and white... That sure is a lot.\nBadd:\nThis room's temperature is 59℉... And the lights are set to white.\nGusto:\nIt's because the works in this room are made of chocolate. By using white light, the chocolate can stand out.\nGregory:\n(For Mr. Master, everything in this room is probably a piece of art.)\nCounter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nElegant tableware and cookware are placed on the counter. It looks like the same tea set Ms. Hall was using earlier.\nRay:\nWas Master Jeff drinking this black tea?\nBadd:\nOn this tea set... only Jeff Master's fingerprints were found.\nGregory:\nWere his fingerprints found on any of the other cookware?\nBadd:\nThe cookware was washed... Nobody's fingerprints... remained.\nGregory:\n(Or he might have been cooking with gloves on... It seems the only thing here with his fingerprints is the tea set.)\nJeff's Teapot added to the Court Record.\nGloves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\nMaster... used these gloves while making his desserts... They hid his fingerprints...\nGregory:\nCertainly, it's possible that they were used for that purpose... But wouldn't you agree that finding cooking gloves in the kitchen is perfectly natural?\nBadd:\nDoubt everything... That's my job...\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVessel of Jeff's Teapot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nHm... This is a rather splendid design.\nRay:\n...You think so? It seems a little eccentric to me... I'm not even sure how you'd pour tea out of it.\nGregory:\nRather than the practicality of the design, focus on its artistic merits.\nRay:\nHmm. Mr. Edgeworth's art sense is too high for me to understand!\n\n\n\n\nBottom side of Jeff's Teapot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nThere's an engraving on the bottom! It says \"PH\".\nGregory:\nIt's the initials of the creator, \"Pierre Hoquet\". Ms. Hall and Mr. Master seem to be big fans of this sculptor's works.\nRay:\nInitials, huh... If it were mine, it'd be \"RS\"!\nGregory:\n...Why don't you try carving your initials on your own belongings?\n(Connecting all possible Logic, examining handprint and counter, talking to sitting forensics, and deducing missing chocolate piece leads to:)\nInvestigation Complete\nGregory:\nIt seems our investigation of this room is just about over.\nCrime Scene Notes updated in the Court Record.\nBadd:\nThis should make it clear... Jeff Master is the culprit.\nRay:\n! Wh-Why!?\nBadd:\nAll the rooms in this mansion... were locked from the inside. And... the only way to open them from the outside, was to use this key to the mansion...\nGregory:\n...Do you know who had the key?\nBadd:\nMaster... was the only one with the key. ...There were no spare keys.\nMansion Key added to the Court Record.\nBadd:\nBy using the mansion key... Master... could enter all the contestants' rooms. Of course... the key could also lock his room from the outside...\nGregory:\nHowever, Mr. Master's room is currently unlocked.\nBadd:\nYeah... That's why I suspect Master is the culprit...\nGregory:\n...I'd like to hear your reasoning in more detail.\n-- Why I Suspect Jeff Master --\nBadd:\nIf the body had been found in a locked room... Master would've been the prime suspect.\nThat's why Master made sure to leave the door to his own room unlocked...\nAnd to ensure that the body would be seen... Master broke the lid on the treasure chest.\nAfter the judging... everyone was scheduled to meet in Master's room...\nThat would have created the impression... that the murder had occurred... while he was away.\nBadd:\nContrary to his expectations... the body was discovered by Ms. Hall... ...That's my reason for suspecting Master. Got that, Ace Attorney?\nGregory:\n...So you also think it was Mr. Master himself who vandalized this room?\nBadd:\nYeah... You defense attorneys believe that justice lies in trusting your clients... But I'm a detective. If I believed every poor sap's story... I'd let the suspicious ones get away...\nGregory:\n...I understand your reasoning thoroughly. However... I'd like you to hear my thoughts on the subjects now.\nBadd:\n...Hmph. Fine.\nGregory:\n(Detective Badd believes that he is right, but I won't give up so easily. I can't accept his reasoning... I'll have to show him evidence that contradicts it!)\n\nGregory: Gregory: Isn't it a little premature to suspect Mr. Master on those grounds alone? Badd: It's a little premature... for you to be objecting...! ...Just wait... until I'm done...\nGregory: Gregory: He left it unlocked? Badd: If the door had been locked... Master would be the only one who could commit the crime... Ray: Well... maybe the door just happened to be unlocked? Badd: Then... maybe the body just happened to be lying in the open, waiting to be discovered... ...Runt... Do you think you can become a good detective with logic like that? Ray: Uugh... But, I don't wanna be a detective, I wanna be a defense attorney. Gregory: (...I hope he isn't trying to steal my apprentice.) Badd: Master had... a reason... to leave the door unlocked.\nGregory: Gregory: You believe the broken lid was Mr. Master's doing? Badd: Yes... If he hadn't done that, the body... wouldn't have been found. Gregory: ...It doesn't seem likely that he would break his own work while he was judging the contest. Ray: That's right! Master Jeff would never waste a good dessert! On \"Piece of Cake\", he even eats them while dancing! Badd: That TV show is irrelevant here... Gregory: ! Detective Badd, you know about \"Piece of Cake\"? (When I didn't even know of it!) Ray: Whaaat! This is a surprise! So... do you sing the song too? Badd: ...That's... irrelevant. Anyway... The one who broke the lid on the treasure chest was Master...\nGregory: Gregory: The judging began in Mr. Gusto's room, right? Badd: Yeah... I, too, was looking forward to seeing his candy craft. Gusto: ...Mm? If you would like, I can put on a display of my candy craft for you right now! ...What do you think? It represents Sir Detective! Ray: Umm... Is that supposed to be a police dog? Gusto: No, no, no...! This is a wolf! Badd: Hmm... a lone wolf... .....Not bad. Gregory: (...What would my candy form be? I'm kind of curious myself.) Badd: ...Moving on...\nGregory: Gregory: Do you know the time of the murder? Badd: ...We're still... waiting on... the autopsy report... Gregory: Without the autopsy report, how could you have arrested Mr. Master? Badd: ...We don't know the time of death... but we do know... when the body was discovered. It was discovered... while Master was judging Carmelo Gusto's room. I believe... he let the body be discovered... to create an alibi. Gregory: But that alone is not enough to arrest Mr. Master, right? Badd: ...Who knows. That's all... I intend to say. Gregory: (Detective Badd, are you hiding something...?)\nGregory: Detective Badd seems adamant that Mr. Master is the culprit.\nRay: I don't think Master Jeff would have broken his own creations! But... why was the treasure chest broken then?\nGregory: Hmm... Just think back to the situation in which the body was found. In doing so, we should be able to see the contradiction in Badd's reasoning.",

But... why was the treasure chest broken then?\nGregory:\nHmm... Just think back to the situation in which the body was found. In doing so, we should be able to see the contradiction in Badd's reasoning.\nGregory:\nOriginally, the victim's body was hidden inside the chocolate treasure chest. Ms. Hall entered the room when she heard a sound. I think it is likely that this was the sound of the chocolate ship falling over.\nBadd:\nYeah... That's what you would think... just by looking at the crime scene...\nGregory:\nYou said that Mr. Master broke the treasure chest lid himself... ...but, this photo shows that the ship's fall caused the lid to break.\nBadd:\n.....\nGregory:\nIf the lid broke just before Ms. Hall found the body... ...then Mr. Master, who was in the middle of judging, could not have broken it!\nBadd:\nI... never said that Master broke the lid directly...

Have you found any other fingerprints, other than Mr. Master's, in this room?\nBadd:\n...Yeah. There were some left on the floor.\nGregory:\n!\nBadd:\nBut... the victim, Frost, and Master were also among the fingerprints left behind.\nGusto:\nBefore we made our desserts, we all gathered here to have the judging explained to us. Perhaps that was when we left those fingerprints?\nGregory:\n...But, you didn't find any fingerprints on the works in this room?\nBadd:\n...What...?\nGregory:\nSomeone tampered with the chocolate in this room. So perhaps there are other fingerprints on it, apart from Mr. Master's.\nBadd:\n...Hmph. No matter what we find, it won't clear Master of suspicion...\nBadd:\n.....Labbie! Hurry up and dust the chocolate for fingerprints!\nForensics:\nRoger that, sir!\nForensics:\nDetective Badd! We found another person's fingerprints... on all the chocolates in the room!\nBadd:\n.....! Whose... fingerprints...?\nForensics:\nThey belong to a pastry chef by the name of Delicia!\nBadd:\n...Good work... Return to the investigation.\nForensics:\nYes, sir!\nGregory:\nIt would seem that there are other suspicious people besides Mr. Master, after all.\nBadd:\n...Hmph. I don't need a defense attorney to tell me that... I'm not stopping my investigation... We will just... go and listen to what this Delicia has to say.\nGregory:\n(Delicia... Gusto told us about her not long ago. Is she really a \"frightening woman who would do anything to achieve her goal\"?)\nRay:\nMr. Edgeworth, this Delicia lady sounds mighty suspicious to me!\nGregory:\nMmm. It seems that it will be necessary for us to speak with her directly, as well. Detective Badd. Would you allow us to accompany you?\nBadd:\n...I'm not obligated to do that.\nRay:\nWhat...!?\nBadd:\nBut... you were the one who discovered the truth of the crime scene... Fine, have it your way. Follow me...\nGregory:\nDetective Badd...! Thank you.\nForensics:\nD-Detective Badd, sir! Are you sure about that? Right now, that prosecutor is in the room...!\nBadd:\n...Doesn't matter. Him and I... don't see eye to eye.\nRay:\n\"Him\"...? Who's the prosecutor in charge of this case anyway?\nBadd:\n...Manfred von Karma...\nRay:\nWHAAAAAA! Von Karma is in charge!? That guy hasn't lost a case in 25 years...\nGregory:\n(Manfred von Karma... The \"living legend\" of the prosecutor's office...? If the rumors of his courtroom performance are to be believed... ...he's a man who would do anything for a guilty verdict. ...No matter what kind of prosecutor he is, I can only hold true to the path I believe in.)\nTo be continued.\nDecember 24, 7:30 PMContest VenueDelicia's Room\nRay:\nWow! A candy castle! And there are even some fairies over there!\nBadd:\nThis room... seems to be structured in the same way as Master's room...\nRay:\nBut it's nowhere near as cold!\nBadd:\nThis room... also seems to have been fitted with a temperature control panel...\nRay:\nAh, it's over by that that orange lamp, right!?\nGregory:\nIndeed. Let's not forget to investigate it later. (Even so... this room is like something out of a fairy tale. Is this cream-covered castle Delicia's work?)\nBadd:\n...Where is Delicia...?\nDelicia:\nOi! Can I help you? Hullo boys! I'm Delicia Scones. In my native England, I'm known as \"Ms. Delicious\"!\nGregory:\n(Being called a \"boy\" even though I'm already 34... It's certainly a rare experience.)\nRay:\nB-Boys? I understand you calling me that, but... Mr. Edgeworth!?\nDelicia:\nAs far as I'm concerned, you're all boys to me, even that detective over there.\nBadd:\n...My name is... Badd. Not \"boy\"...\nGregory:\n(Just how old is this woman?)\nBadd:\n...Mr. Attorney. Let's just finish our business here.\nGregory:\nHmm... Right.\n???:\n???:\nYou! What do you think you're doing!? Conversing with a mere attorney!?\nRay:\nMr. Edgeworth! A-A scary man came out of the candy castle...!\nBadd:\n...Von Karma...\nRay:\nEh! This man is, Prosecutor von Karma...?\nDelicia:\nEep! Manny!\nGregory:\n(So he's Von Karma...) Pleased to meet you, Prosecutor von Karma. My name is Gregory Edgeworth, defense attorney.\nvon Karma:\nBah! I have no interest in the names of defense attorneys. After all, they only exist to be crushed by me.\nGregory:\n(...What a rude man.)\nRay:\nThat piercing gaze and furrowed brow...! Uugh... He's even scarier than the rumors say.\nGregory:\n(Although that statement was also very rude.) Prosecutor von Karma. Would you allow us to investigate too?\nvon Karma:\nHmph. You think I would give information to a mere defense attorney?\nGregory:\n(As I thought, it won't be that simple...)\nvon Karma:\n..... ...However, I'll make a special exception for this room.\nGregory:\n! (Why did he change his mind so quickly?)\nvon Karma:\nYou, old bloodhound.\nBadd:\n...Don't call me that. ...My name is... Badd.\nvon Karma:\nHah! A mere detective, speaking back to me. ...I admire your courage at least. Badd. Stand watch and see to it that they don't misbehave.\nBadd:\nWhy... me...!\nvon Karma:\nI will not accept your refusal. Well then, I'll be investigating Gusto's room next.\nBadd:\nTch... I'm babysitting again...\nGregory:\n(I wonder why he and Von Karma aren't investigating together? Instead of being on bad terms, it seems like they hardly know each other...)\nRay:\nMr. Edgeworth, now that we've got Von Karma's permission, we can continue investigating!\nGregory:\nYes. His manner bothers me, but I am glad we can at least continue the investigation.\nBadd:\n...Hold it. I also need to investigate this room... I don't want you disturbing the room... So you'll investigate... after me.\nRay:\nWhat!? Aren't you the detective in charge of this case? Why haven't you investigated this room yet?\nBadd:\n...The detective in charge of the initial investigation was a close colleague of Von Karma. I came to take over for him, so I only got to this mansion just recently.\nGregory:\n(So that's why he and Von Karma aren't investigating together...) Detective Badd. Will you allow us to investigate with you like before? In doing so, you'll be able to supervise us and also ensure we don't tamper with anything.\nBadd:\nYou want me to watch you? ...You're a strange lawyer. ...Hmph. I'll let you stick around... a little longer.\nRay:\nYay! You did it, Mr. Edgeworth!\nGregory:\nThank you, Detective Badd.\nBadd:\n...But if I decide you're holding up the investigation, you'll have to leave...\nGregory:\nYes... I understand. Well then, let's begin the investigation.\nBegin Investigation\nContest VenueDelicia's Room\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hexagonal recess\" and \"Pedestal of rock\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThe rock's pedestal has a similar shape to the recesses on the castle's pillars. Perhaps the rock is meant to be placed on top of the pillars?\nRay:\nOh, that's right! They're both hexagonal.\nGregory:\n(I wonder why they were hidden inside the castle, though?)\n\n\n\n\n\"Fragile desserts\" and \"High room temperature\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThe reason the fresh cream is so fragile is due to the temperature in this room.\nBadd:\nSo my shoes got creamed... because the room temperature is set at 68℉...\nGregory:\nSpeaking of which... When you opened the castle door, the doorknob didn't break.\nBadd:\nYeah... it was stronger than I thought...\nGregory:\nStrong? ...A dessert? Detective Badd. Could you have a closer look at that doorknob?\nBadd:\n.....? ...This is...!\nGregory:\nIt would seem this doorknob isn't a dessert.\nBadd:\n...And it's not just the doorknob. This castle and the fairies... Are just plastic molds coated in fresh cream.\nRay:\nEeh! Then, this isn't a dessert piece at all...!\nGregory:\nIt would seem they're just fake desserts (Fake desserts - Delicia made fake desserts. What are her true intentions...?) covered in fresh cream...\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\n...What?\n\n\n\nNotice anything?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\nThis room... has the same design as Master's room...\nGregory:\nIs something bothering you?\nBadd:\nVon Karma ...was investigating ...inside the candy castle... ...I wonder... why...\nGregory:\nDetective Badd, do you suspect Delicia?\nBadd:\nThat woman... is hiding something. ...My detective's spirit... is telling me so...\nGregory:\n(Is that his detective's intuition? Something about this room definitely troubles me as well. I should listen to what Delicia has to say...)\nCounter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThere's a burner and some chemicals over here. They were probably used to make desserts. What are these chemicals? The writing on the labels say... \"No. 1: Punchout!\"... and \"No. 9: Sufferin\"...!\nBadd:\nAre... they... poisons?\nForensics:\nNo, they are both used to make desserts. Seems to be artificial flavoring and coloring. \"Punchout!\" is a catchy name for a fruit punch essence.\nBadd:\nTch... Very misleading...!\nGregory:\n(What bothers me is what \"Sufferin\" stands for...)\nForensics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForensics:\nDon't turn around, don't turn around... If you do, you're only gonna eat that castle!\nGregory:\n(...This forensics officer seems to be on a diet.)\nControl panel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThere's a cover on the wall, just like in Mr. Master's room.\nBadd:\n...Let's open it up...\nRay:\nHmm. The room temperature is 68℉, and the lights are set to green...\nBadd:\nGusto said... that 50℉ is the ideal temperature for fresh cream... This room's temperature is too high (High room temperature - The temperature in Delicia's room is too high for fresh cream.).\nGregory:\n(This is... intriguing.)\nFairy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIt's a cute candy fairy sitting on a tree stump. Hmm. The cream decorations are melting. The fairy seems to be well made, but... something feels slightly off.\nCastle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n...I can't believe this amazing castle is made entirely out of confectionery.\nRay:\nI know! What a work of fantasy. It's like a fairy tale world!\nGregory:\nYou like all this fairy tale stuff, don't you?\nRay:\nAh... sorry! I got a bit too excited, didn't I?\nGregory:\nNo... It's interesting to me since you're so enthusiastic about it, unlike my son.\nRay:\nYour... son?\nGregory:\nHe's only in grade school, yet he prefers to read law books instead of fairy tales. ...I am worried that he won't be able to make any friends that he can talk to.\nRay:\nHeh! What an interesting kid. I'd like to be his friend!\nGregory:\nHa ha... I think you'd be more of an \"older brother\" to him.\nRay:\nHe he he. An older brother, huh... Well, I've got some growing up to do then!\nGregory:\nYes, and that's why we have to continue with the investigation.\n\n\n\n\nBefore examining blue cloth rolls, rocks, and hexagonal recess\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nAfter examining blue cloth rolls, rocks, and hexagonal recess\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nHexagonal recess\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nHm. This pillar... has a hexagonal recess.\nBadd:\nIt looks like a pedestal... but... it has nothing in it.\nRay:\nA hexagonal recess (Hexagonal recess - The two pillars have a hexagonal recess on top. What were they for?), huh. I wonder what would have been put in there?\nBadd:\n...A giant strawberry... would fit with the fresh cream.\nRay:\nDetective Badd. I don't think strawberries are hexagonal.\nBadd:\nI was just... hoping...\nRay:\nThen, I hope it's a banana!\nGregory:\n(...I think I'd prefer blueberries.)\n\n\n\n\nInside\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The castle doors are open...\"\n\n\nGregory:\nThe castle doors are open...\nRay:\nWhen someone opens a door, they really should remember to close it afterwards.\nGregory:\n(Would he say that directly to Prosecutor von Karma though?)\nRay:\nHuh? Looks like there's some stuff inside. Hmm, let's see...\nBadd:\nWait... I'll examine it. Stay out of the way. Tch... This fresh cream melts too easily (Fragile desserts - The cream is melting. A single touch can cause it to break.).\nGregory:\n(Seems like Detective Badd's shoes got covered in cream... ...Why were these objects kept inside the candy castle?)\nBadd:\n...If there's anything you want to investigate... you better speak up now.\n\n\n\nBlue cloth rolls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\n...There are rolls of blue cloth here. Looks like there's four of them in all...\nGregory:\nThey certainly don't look like desserts.\nBadd:\nYeah... I don't know what the cloth is for... It almost seems like... it was hidden here inside the castle...\nGregory:\n(...Also, the color of this cloth looks familiar somehow.)\n\n\n\n\nRocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\nTwo big rocks... are placed here. It's like a... storage room.\nRay:\nYeah, the inside of the candy castle isn't so dreamy. ...Hey! Maybe they're raw gemstones? Who knew that there were such treasures hidden within the castle!\nGregory:\nSeems like a rather careless way to handle treasure... Hm...? It looks like there's something underneath the rocks.\nBadd:\nSeems there's a... pedestal (Pedestal of rock - The rocks in the castle have a pedestal attached to them for some reason.) attached to both of the rocks...\nRay:\nOf course! It's a pedestal for displaying the gems!\nGregory:\nWell... in any case, this is no ordinary object.\nRaymond Shields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nThe sicky sweet smell of cream. Yes, this truly is a fairy tale world. And yet, here in this sugary sweet room, there was one with such a sour face... He doesn't belong in this room... That scary old man.\nGregory:\nRaymond, mind what you say. You're being a bit rude.\nRay:\nS-Sorry... It won't happen again. He reminded me of my old school teacher who used to get mad at me a lot...\nGregory:\n(A school teacher. I definitely... ...don't want to think of my son being taught by such a man.)\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIt says, \"The Four Fairies and the Curious Candy Castle.\" It seems that this was the theme for Delicia's works.\nBadd:\nBut, it's not just the candy castle that I'm curious about...\nTools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nHere are all the tools used to make desserts.\nBadd:\nEverything from a bucket of fresh cream... to a brush and a trowel... Looks more like a construction worker's tools...\nDelicia:\nHey now, boys. Don't undersweetmate the work of a pastry chef! It's completely different from construction work, where they cover the walls with cement. We use the trowel to smear the cream, and the brush to clean any uneven parts...\nBadd:\n...How is that different from construction work...?\nDelicia Scones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicia:\n*sigh*...\nRay:\nHuh? Ms. Delicious. You don't seem as energetic as you were earlier.\nGregory:\n...Delicia. Can I just ask, did something happen with Von Karma?\nDelicia:\nYessie! N-Nothing of the sort!\nRay:\nBut, you just said, \"Yessie\"...\nDelicia:\nHa ha ha ha! That \"Yessie\" just now was only a greeting. You're a cute boy! I like you. What's your first name?\nRay:\nEh? It's Raymond, but...\nDelicia:\nWell, Ray Ray! I think you'll make a good man of yourself someday!\nRay:\nR-Ray Ray...?\nGregory:\nHow about that. I think you have a way with British ladies.\nRay:\nShe's a little different from my image of a \"lady\"...\nGregory:\nWhy don't we listen to what she has to say.\n\n\n\nDuring the contest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nCould you tell me about your actions during the contest?\nDelicia:\nYessie! We began making desserts for the contest around 10 o'clock. Basically, I was in here making my desserts the whole time. At half past one, I joined the afternoon tea for about an hour or so.\nRay:\nAfternoon tea?\nGregory:\nIt's a social occasion, where conversation is had over black tea and cakes.\nRay:\n...Umm. So, it's pretty much a tea party!\nGregory:\nWell... I suppose.\nDelicia:\nHa ha ha ha! Oh, Greggy, you're a smart boy, aren't you!\nGregory:\n(When did I become \"Greggy\"...?) Where was the afternoon tea held?\nDelicia:\nIt took place in the gardens, outside of the Fountain Patio. It's our customary break time during the contest. It's always held at the same time. Today there were just three of us who took part. Jeffy, Katie and me. Since Jeffy had already finished his creations, he was there from beginning to end. Icy and Gusty didn't join in because they hadn't finished their desserts yet.\nGregory:\n...So, everyone other than Mr. Frost and Mr. Gusto participated.\nDelicia:\nYes. Actually, I hadn't finished my dessert yet either. I just wanted to try some of Jeffy's handmade pastries and Katie's fresh-brewed tea. So... after I had eaten my fill, I returned before everyone else.\nGregory:\nDuring the contest, did you enter any of the other contestants' rooms?\nDelicia:\nEh! Wh-What are you saying?\nGregory:\nWe found your fingerprints on the desserts at the crime scene...\nDelicia:\nEep! You found them...!\nBadd:\nAre you... admitting that you went to the scene of the murder?\nDelicia:\n*sob* ...I admit it. But, I'm not the murderer! It's the honest truth, please hear me out!\n\n\n\n\nThe honest truth (appears after During the contest)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nWhat were you doing in Mr. Master's room?\nDelicia:\nThe truth is... I was studying his desserts.\nBadd:\nStudying...?\nDelicia:\nBecause Jeffy's so talented at making sweets! Well... Nobody was in his room at the time, so I just decided to study (Desserts study - Delicia went to Mr. Master's room to study his desserts.) his works for a bit.\nBadd:\n...But, if you were just looking, you wouldn't have left your fingerprints behind...?\nDelicia:\nYessie! It's natural that I left fingerprints on the desserts! For the sake of research, I ate some of his desserts.\nRay:\nEeh! Isn't that like stealing food?\nGregory:\nIt couldn't be... The one who wrecked Mr. Master's room was...\nDelicia:\n*sob* ...I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention to vandalize the room, but... I did eat a few parts of the desserts in his room. ...I secretly ate little bits and pieces so Jeffy wouldn't find out.\nGregory:\nSo... Did you you[sic] eat the ship stand as well?\nDelicia:\nYessie! I did.\nBadd:\nThe chocolate ship broke... because of you...\nDelicia:\nEep! I'm sorry...!\nRay:\nSo, the reason she left the afternoon tea early... ...was to preserve her appetite...\nDelicia:\nB-But! You've got to believe me on this! I'm not the murderer!\nGregory:\n(Her actions are sufficiently suspicious, but... I won't press on it yet.)\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicia:\nOi! What's that?\nGregory:\nThis badge is proof that I'm a defense attorney.\nDelicia:\nHoi! I'll show you mine too. This chef's hat is proof that I'm a pastry chef.\nGregory:\nIs that so...? But aren't those sold in stores?\nDelicia:\nHey! It's not the hat that's important, it's the spirit you wear the hat with that matters!\nGregory:\n(So then, wouldn't that mean just about anyone can become a pastry chef...)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicia:\nOi! That thing you've got there is rather cute, Greggy. But, the color is rather unappealing. Now, if I were to coat it with fresh cream...\nGregory:\nS-Stop it!\n(Step)ladder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\n...What is it, Mr. Attorney? Something about that ladder bothering you..?\nGregory:\nDetective Badd. It's actually a stepladder.\nBadd:\n...They're both the same to me...\nGregory:\nThey're completely different. Look at their basic nature.\nRay:\nYeah, Mr. Edgeworth... You tell him!\n(Connecting hexagon Logic and examining blue cloth rolls leads to:)\nGregory:\n(The \"blue cloth\" and the \"rocks\" inside the castle... I wonder if they belong to Delicia?) Delicia. Those things in the castle, what are they used for?\nDelicia:\nAh... uhh, those? I'm afraid I can't tell you.\nBadd:\n...Looks like Von Karma is... keeping her silent...\nDelicia:\nEep! I've been found out... He'll get made at me if I talk.\nGregory:\n(Prosecutor von Karma... doesn't intend on being upfront with his information.)\nRay:\nAww... it's such a shame. We finally figured out where the rocks are supposed to go.\nDelicia:\n! Could it be that you're interested in my goods?\nRay:\nEh? Your \"goods\"...?\nDelicia:\nThose are my popular relaxation goods.\nGregory:\nYou mean... the rocks and the cloth?\nDelicia:\nYessie! That's right! You see, they're not actually rocks, but special lamps made from rock salt.\nRay:\nWow! So those are lamps!\nDelicia:\nHa ha ha ha! It gets even more exciting! Because, this cloth also has an amazing secret!\nGregory:\n(As soon as we showed interest in her goods, she became quite talkative.)\nDelicia:\nSince we've got them out, come experience the therapy, boys. Baddie! Could you put everything up!\nBadd:\nIt's... not Baddie, it's Badd...\nDelicia:\n...So you won't do it? Is Baddie being a bad boy?\nGregory:\n.......\nBadd:\n...Labbie! Are you done photographing this room?\nForensics:\nYes, sir! I am!\nBadd:\n...Then go help Delicia...\nForensics:\nYes, sir! I'm on it!\nDelicia:\nHa ha ha ha! Thanks! I knew you were a good boy underneath, Baddie!\nRay:\nMs. Delicious... That was amazing. You even persuaded Detective Badd!\nDelicia:\nThanks a lot, Baddie! And you too, Forensies!\nRay:\n...She even gave the forensics a nickname.\nGregory:\nI think that's her way of showing she cares.\nBadd:\nWhat's so... therapeutic... about these things anyway?\nDelicia:\nWe don't have time for that now, Baddie! The show's about to begin! Forensies! Finishing touches, please!\nForensics:\nYes, ma'am!\nBadd:\nIt's...\nRay:\nWow, It's so beautiful!\nGregory:\nIt really is... (I wish my son could see this.)\nDelicia:\nOi! I told you so, right? \"The Four Fairies and the Curious Candy Castle\" was the theme of my work. It's so sparkly and cute, right?\nGregory:\n(It seems like... one of them is missing something.)\nDelicia:\nThe truth is, I had planned to unveil it during the contest. Well, I'm glad I got to show it to you boys!\nRay:\nHuh? But it doesn't look like the rock salt lamps are lighting up.\nDelicia:\nH-Huh? I wonder why...?\nGregory:\n(I think I'll need to examine... the rocks and the fairies again.)\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Beaten to death\" and \"Bloodstained rock salt lamp\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThere is evidence that the victim was beaten to death with a blunt object... What's more, there's a bloodstain on one of the broken rock salt lamps. Could this lamp have been the murder weapon?\nRay:\nYou're right! It could have been used as a weapon.\nBadd:\n...Labbie. Is the blood analysis on this rock salt lamp finished?\nForensics:\nYes, sir! It finished just a few moments ago! The bloodstain on that lamp belonged to the victim.\nBadd:\n...You heard what he said.\nRock Salt Lamp added to the Court Record.\nGregory:\n(The murder weapon was hidden in Delicia's room... We need to consider her as one of the suspects as well.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Delicia broke the rules\" and \"Fake desserts\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nUsing decorations that were against the rules and making fake desserts... A lot of Delicia's actions seem suspicious.\nBadd:\nYeah... It doesn't seem like she's aiming to be the world's greatest pastry chef...\nRay:\nAlso, the temperature of this room is way too high. Is there a reason for that?\nFake Desserts added to the Court Record.\nGregory:\nI wonder. ...I think we should ask Delicia directly.\n\n\n\n\n\"Desserts study\" and \"Knowledge was lacking\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nDelicia's knowledge in the art of dessert making is lacking in fundamental areas. And she claimed she went into Mr. Master's room in order to \"study his desserts\"... These actions and ideas are not fitting of someone aiming to be the world's greatest pastry chef.\nBadd:\nYeah... They don't sounds like the words of a pro. It's like she doesn't even realize it, or...\nGregory:\n(Or, maybe she isn't a real pastry chef...) Perhaps she had some other intention. ...It's possible that she didn't go into the room to study desserts.\nRay:\nSo, then... Are you saying Ms. Delicious is the criminal?\nGregory:\n...We can't say that for sure yet. (But, I know she's hiding something from us...)\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\n...What?\n\n\n\nThe investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\n...Since the circumstances have changed, we should investigate the scene once more...\nGregory:\nYes. The fluorescent cloth behind the fairy dolls... and the rock salt lamp concerns me.\nBadd:\nWhy were they in the castle... No... why were they hidden inside the castle. I knew it, that woman... smells. But not a sugary sweet smell...\nGregory:\nWe need to have another look, to see if there are any problems at the scene.\n\n\n\n\nDelicia Scones (after connecting fake desserts Logic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\nThis desserts here... are all fake. ...What a... phony...\nGregory:\nThis is the contest to decide the world's greatest pastry chef. Why did she do something like that, which would immediately give her away?\nBadd:\n...I guess she was naïve enough that she thought she could get away with it, or perhaps...\nGregory:\n(Her true goal... I feel like I know what it is. I hold the fragmented pieces of information. Now, all I have to do is combine them...)\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRock Salt Lamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThere's no mistaking it, this is what took the victim's life.\nBadd:\nChossing a weapon like this... perhaps the murder wasn't premeditated. If that's so... that woman... hit the victim with this lamp on a sudden impulse. It feels like the sweet smell of desserts has been tainted by the smell of something fishy.\nGregory:\n(Delicia... Are you hiding something...?)\nFairy on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIt's a cute candy fairy sitting on a tree stump. The cloth in the back along with the decorations really give it a magical atmosphere. When you look at it, it almost feels like you're spellbound.\nBadd:\nWhat we need to look for... is the hidden truths of the real world... Don't be fooled...by the fairies...!\nCastle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore examining lamp on left and deducing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nAfter examining lamp on left and deducing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nRock salt lamp on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIt looks like both the lamps in the pillars are broken.\nBadd:\nBoth of their light bulbs... are broken...\nRay:\nMaybe they were dropped on the floor. There's some sort of red stain on this lamp's surface.\nGregory:\nThis stain... could it be...!\nBadd:\n...That smell... There's no mistaking it. It's a bloodstain (Bloodstained rock salt lamp - Someone's bloodstain was left on the rock salt lamp.)...\nRay:\nEhhhh! Th-That's a bloodstain...\nGregory:\n(Why is there a bloodstain on this lamp? I wonder if this has something to do with the lamp bulb being broken... I should also take a look at the other lamp here.)\n\n\n\n\nCloths\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThe castle door is adorned with a beautiful cloth. I think this was the cloth that was in the castle.\nBadd:\nEntrance ways are always beautiful... that's what a detective thinks.\nGregory:\n(Yes, after Detective Badd's shoes have trampled all over it... But, this is no time for snide remarks.)\n\n\n\n\nDoor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\n...This dessert made my shoes all dirty... If you come any closer... your shoes will be covered in cream too...\nGregory:\n(We've already seen what's behind the door. There's no need to look again.)\n\n\n\n\nRock salt lamp on right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nSo this is where Delicia originally intended to put the lamps.\nBadd:\n...I don't get why she put them in the castle...\nRay:\nSince they're broken and don't light up, maybe she decided to put them out of the way?\nBadd:\n...If she wanted them out of the way... There are many other places to store them.\nRay:\nIt's like that old saying, \"Hide the salt in the sugar bag!\"\nGregory:\n(...I think the saying goes, \"Hide a tree in the forest.\" If Delicia intended to use these lamps as decorations during the contest... It creates a contradiction with that piece of evidence. I need to deduce the contradiction at the scene...)\n\n\n\n\nDeduce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)\n\n\n\nDeduce cloths or lamps and present Contest Rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Badd. Please read the contest leaflet.\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nGregory:\nDetective Badd, look at this. Don't you think it's strange?\nBadd:\nI think what's strange... is your deduction.\nGregory:\nUrgh...!\nBadd:\nIf your brain isn't working right... then it's due to the lack of sugar... ...I'll sell you one of my lollipops... for two bucks.\nGregory:\n(That sounds a tad high... Is there no evidence of a contradiction with the castle decorations?)\n\n\nGregory:\nDetective Badd. Please read the contest leaflet.\nBadd:\n.....\"Any decorations not made from desserts are prohibited.\" ...Huh.\nGregory:\nThese rock salt lamps and the fluorescent cloths go against the rules (Delicia broke the rules - Delicia used other objects besides desserts for her decorations.).\nRay:\nSo, maybe that's why they were hidden in the castle?\nGregory:\nI wonder about that... I think we should investigate further into Delicia's actions.\nFairy on right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nUnlike the other fairies, this one doesn't have a fluorescent cloth.\nRay:\nMs. Delicious! It's not right to leave one out!\nDelicia:\nI don't like it either. But... one fluorescent cloth and a machine has gone missing!\nGregory:\nYou've lost a cloth... and a machine? What sort of machine is it?\nDelicia:\nOi! Let me tell you! Each piece of fluorescent cloth is hooked up to one of these machines. The machine is called a rainbow light device... Light is sent through the cable and into the cloth, which is made of optic fibers. Just fiddle around with the settings a bit, and it will turn into all sorts of colors! When it glows red, it's like a raging inferno! And when it glows blue, you can almost feel the glittering cool ice! It's powered by a long-lasting battery that's resistant to changes in the temperature!\nGregory:\nUm, I'm not very familiar with these kinds of devices...\nRay:\nMr. Edgeworth. She's saying it's a machine that transmits light to the special cloth.\nGregory:\n(...I see. It's amazing what they come up with these days.)\nBadd:\nSo, one rainbow light device... and one fluorescent cloth are missing...?\nDelicia:\nYessie, that's right. Wherever could they be...\nGregory:\n(This fluorescent cloth... could it be related to the case?)\nFluorescent Cloth added to the Court Record.\nFairy on right (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(One rainbow light device and one fluorescent cloth have gone missing. Could there be some connection to the case...?)\nDelicia Scones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe room temperature (after connecting fake desserts Logic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nDelicia, why is the room temperature set to 68℉?\nDelicia:\nThe cold doesn't agree with me. Plus, it's bad for the body! This figure doesn't just maintain itself, you know! Naturally, as a lady, I want to look young forever.\nRay:\nI wonder... how old Ms. Delicious really is.\nGregory:\nRaymond. A true gentleman never asks a woman her age.\nBadd:\nThis room... is mainly filled with cream... And 50℉ is the recommended temperature for preserving fresh cream.\nDelicia:\nWhat, really? Now it's all gone to waste!\nRay:\nIt looks like Ms. Delicious didn't know (Knowledge was lacking - Delicia seems lacking in the basic knowledge of dessert making.).\nBadd:\n...Hmph. I thought she was supposed to be a first-class pastry chef...\nGregory:\n(The fake desserts and the rule violations. And now... her lack of basic knowledge. Looks like she keeps many secrets...)\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicia:\nOi! Looks like this caught your eye. The way this cloth works... Ah, I wonder if it's OK for me to tell you about it.\nGregory:\n...?\nDelicia:\n...Sorry, I can't talk about this cloth!\nGregory:\n(What...? That was strange. I wonder if Von Karma told her to say quiet about it?)\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue cloth of Fluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nA blue cloth... I like this relaxing color.\nRay:\nAs expected of Mr. Edgeworth! That's so old school! C'mon, let's hurry and make it glow!\nGregory:\nY... Yes. (Does he mean I'm old-fashioned...?)\n\n\n\n\nGlowing cloth of Fluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThe rainbow light device has made the cloth glow with light blue aura.\nRay:\nSpeaking of which, one set of this cloth and device has gone missing. I wonder where it went to?\nGregory:\nI don't have the answer to that... but it could be related to the case.\n\n\n\n\nSwitches on machine of Fluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nAh! There are some switches over here!\nGregory:\nThey probably control the color of the cloth. Raymond, try pressing one. The cloth has started to glow.\nRay:\nIt's so mesmerizing... I could look at it all day...\n\n\n\n\nRock salt of Rock Salt Lamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nThis rock salt lamp doesn't light up.\nGregory:\nHm... It's a shame, but it appears to be broken.\nRay:\nAww, I really wanted to see it light up... I wanted to experience the calming glow too!\nGregory:\n(Maybe I should try putting one in the office.)\n\n\n\n\nBloodstain on Rock Salt Lamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nUgh... A vivid bloodstain was left behind... I can't believe the murder weapon came from inside the candy castle...\nGregory:\nRaymond. If it's too difficult, you don't have to look at it.\nRay:\nI-I'm fine! I'm going to become a lawyer after all!\nGregory:\nHeh... I see. (You have a promising future...)\n\n\n\n\nBottom side of Rock Salt Lamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nThis rock salt lamp has a hexagonal base.\nGregory:\nThe recess in the pillars must have been made to match this shape.\nRay:\nAfter all, they fit the pillars in the candy castle perfectly!\n(Connecting all possible Logic and examining fairy on right leads to:)\nInvestigation Complete\nBadd:\nThat's enough... investigating...\nGregory:\nHmph... We've found much more than I expected. (And yet, something from before still bothers me. Prosecutor von Karma must have found the murder weapon in this room... So then, why did he let Delicia be? First, I must ascertain Von Karma's true motives...!) Detective Badd. I would like to ask Prosecutor von Karma something.\nBadd:\n...I've also got business with him... And Delicia there too...\nDelicia:\nEep! What's the idea, Baddie? Don't glare at me like that.\nGregory:\n(It seems Detective Badd also has his doubts about Delicia and Von Karma.) Delicia, would you come with us for a moment?\nDelicia:\nYessie! That's... fine. What for?\nGregory:\n...We have to find Von Karma. There are some things we need to talk about.\nDecember 24, 8:05 PMContest VenueFountain Patio\nGregory:\nProsecutor von Karma. We need to talk about the case.\nvon Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... From the look on your face, I assume you've found the murder weapon?\nGregory:\nYes... We discovered the murder weapon in Delicia's room. ...It would seem Mr. Master isn't the only suspect in this case.\nvon Karma:\nBah... That's not true. Where the murder weapon was found does not change the fact that Master is the culprit. ...As long as I am here.\nGregory:\n(Why is Von Karma so sure of himself...?) Well then, aren't you going to explain? Why the murder weapon was in Delicia's room!\nvon Karma:\nHmph... Naturally. If you wish to know, I'll tell you.\n-- About the Murder Weapon --\nvon Karma:\nIn order to pin the crime on Delicia, Master used the rock salt lamp to kill the victim.\nHe then deposited the murder weapon in Delicia's room.\nIf he had left the murder weapon at the crime scene, Master would have been the one suspected.\nHe couldn't move the body, but it was easy to move the murder weapon.\nErgo, there would be no evidence pointing to a specific culprit at the crime scene.\nGregory:\nMr. Master took the rock salt lamp...?\nvon Karma:\n...Precisely. I carried out the investigation myself... There can be no room for doubt.\nGregory:\nDo you have evidence that he moved it?\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph. That will not be necessary.\nGregory:\nWha...!\nvon Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... If you have an objection, say it. Do you think a mere defense attorney can break my logic!?\n\nGregory: Gregory: He took the rock salt lamp from Delicia's room...? von Karma: ...Exactly. In order to kill Frost, he had prepared the murder weapon beforehand. Gregory: But, the murder weapon was found in Delicia's room. Doesn't that place suspicion on Delicia too? von Karma: Hmph... I'm not finished. Master killed Frost...\nGregory: Gregory: So, the murder weapon was the rock salt lamp hidden inside the candy castle? von Karma: Hmph... I discovered the murder weapon when I entered the castle. Be thankful, defense attorney, that you too came by this information! Gregory: ...Why was it necessary for you to enter the castle? Ray: Ah! Maybe he's interested in candy castles? von Karma: von Karma: Why you... Do you think I went in there because I wanted to!? The detectives at the scene were useless, so I had to investigate myself! Badd: ...! I wasn't in charge of... the initial investigation...! Gregory: (Detective Badd joined the investigation halfway through...) von Karma: Bah! A certain work ethic is required if you are to gain my trust. This is a flagrant waste of time. ...I'll continue.\nGregory: Gregory: Wouldn't the body left behind in his room also be cause for suspicion? Moreover... von Karma: von Karma: ...I have a favorite saying. I'd like to share it with you. \"Even dogs can wait.\" Wait until I've finished! Gregory: (...That's exactly... what I'd like to say to you.)\nGregory: Gregory: Are you saying that Mr. Master removed the murder weapon, and hid the body in the chest? von Karma: He believed that if he hid it inside his own work, it would not be discovered. Delicia: Eep! So savory! Gregory: (Don't you mean... \"so sorry\"?) Badd: She shows no sign... of remorse. von Karma: ...He moved the murder weapon, and left the body at the scene.\nGregory: Gregory: How can you conclude that Mr. Master is the killer without any evidence!? von Karma: von Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... You think that will shake me? You disappoint me! As long as the body was found in Master's room, he's the prime suspect! Gregory: Gregory: Is there really no evidence pointing to anyone else at the crime scene? Surely there's room for further investigation... von Karma: von Karma: Insolent attorney. Another investigation is not necessary. Master must be the killer! If you think differently, cease these pointless words and speak with evidence! Gregory: (Think back to the crime scene. If Mr. Master isn't the killer... There must have been something there incriminating someone else!)\nGregory: (It seems Von Karma won't be shaken easily. I'll just have to present evidence that contradicts his reasoning...!)",

If you think differently, cease these pointless words and speak with evidence!\nGregory:\n(Think back to the crime scene. If Mr. Master isn't the killer... There must have been something there incriminating someone else!)\nPresent Crime Scene Notes or Fluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's true that the murder weapon and bloodstains disappeared from the vicinity.\"\nGregory:\n(It seems Von Karma won't be shaken easily. I'll just have to present evidence that contradicts his reasoning...!)\nGregory:\nIt's true that the murder weapon and bloodstains disappeared from the vicinity. However, there was still one piece of incriminating evidence left behind! Have a look at this photograph, which was taken when the body was first discovered. This cloth was used to wrap the body... Doesn't it remind you of the fluorescent cloth from Delicia's room?\nDelicia:\nEep! My fluorescent cloth was at the crime scene?\nvon Karma:\nHah! Fluorescent cloth...? You! Just what part of this cloth is fluorescent!?\nRay:\nI guess Von Karma doesn't know about this cloth's secret.\nGregory:\nIt looks like a normal cloth at first glance, but if you use this rainbow light device... ...you can make it glow!\nvon Karma:\n.....!\nRay:\nProsecutor von Karma... seems a little surprised.\nGregory:\n(I don't think it was the cloth's ability to glow that surprised him...) ...One sheet of this fluorescent cloth is currently unaccounted for. Now, I'd like you to look at the color of the cloth in this photo. Don't you think it looks like the color of the fluorescent cloth before it's been lit up?\nvon Karma:\n.....Hmph.\nGregory:\nBoth the rock salt lamp and the fluorescent cloth originally belonged to Delicia. Wouldn't it be natural to assume that this cloth was used to wrap the body?\nvon Karma:\n.....\nGregory:\n...Prosecutor von Karma. I believe the present conditions give us much reason to suspect Delicia.\nDelicia:\nEep! Hold it, Greggy! Do you really suspect me?\nGregory:\nI don't yet know if you are the culprit. But, it is true that you're hiding something. Am I right?\nDelicia:\nUu... That's...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\n...So. You're saying that the murder weapon and the cloth were originally from Delicia's room?\nGregory:\nYes.\nvon Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk...!\nGregory:\n...What's so funny?\nvon Karma:\nJust as I expected from you! The murder weapon and the cloth are not from her room. How unfortunate, for you.\nGregory:\n...! (What does he mean...!?)\nvon Karma:\nBefore the contest began, Master noticed her violation of the rules. He confiscated the cloth and the rock salt lamp, and kept them in his room for safekeeping!\nGregory:\nWha...!\nvon Karma:\nThe victim was not seen, as he stayed locked up in his room after the contest had begun. The only one who could have unlocked the locked rooms was Jeff Master. And the murder weapon, the rock salt lamp, was being kept in Master's room. This should be the decisive evidence in proving Master's guilt! Defense attorney. You've lost to me before you even had a chance to stand in court!\nGregory:\n..... (Ngh... What's this!)\nRay:\nWh-What? Was all our investigating for nothing... Ms. Delicious! Why didn't you tell us about your confiscated items?\nDelicia:\nUuh... Well... Manny said I'd look suspicious if I did!\nRay:\nProsecutor von Karma...?\nDelicia:\nAnd it's true, you all suspect me, don't you!\nGregory:\n...!\nvon Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... How clumsy of you, defense attorney.\nGregory:\n(Von Karma...! So that's why he let us investigate Delicia's room!)\nvon Karma:\nAnd in your clumsiness, there's one more thing I need to inform you of. Two sets of fingerprints were found on the murder weapon.\nGregory:\nTwo...?\nvon Karma:\nYes... They belong to Jeff Master and Delicia Scones. No other fingerprints were found.\nGregory:\n.....\nvon Karma:\nAfter Master killed Frost with the confiscated rock salt lamp... ...he foolishly concealed the murder weapon bearing his own fingerprints in its owner's room. Tsk tsk... I don't even need to prove my case in court. I have more than enough perfect evidence to prove Master's guilt.\nGregory:\nGregory:\nHold it! I still have some doubts about the fluorescent cloth found in Mr. Master's room.\nvon Karma:\nBah! Irrelevant. After disposing of the body, he intended to return it to Delicia's room.\nGregory:\n...Ngh...! (I don't have enough information to refute Von Karma's reasoning...)\nvon Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Nothing left to say? If your job is done, leave this place!\nRay:\nTh-That's!\nGregory:\n(I can't give up yet...)\nvon Karma:\nHmph! We've wasted enough time as it is. Badd, take them away!\nBadd:\nThere are still... some doubts left in our investigation.\nGregory:\nDetective Badd...!\nvon Karma:\n...What's the meaning of this?\nBadd:\nIt's not my nature... to leave any doubts behind. There is still one piece of evidence... that has yet to be identified.\nGregory:\n.....! (That's right... there are still the traces someone left behind!)\nvon Karma:\nBah! Talk about your doubts as much as you want later. But... this, my dear attorney, is none of your business.\nGregory:\nGregory:\nNo. I also have some doubts about one piece of evidence. It's likely... That I have the same doubts Detective Badd has.\nvon Karma:\nWhat...?\nGregory:\n(This is the piece of evidence left in Mr. Master's room that has yet to be identified!)\nPresent Frame Fingermarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Somebody left gloved fingermarks on one of Mr. Master's desserts.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nGregory:\nWe still do not know the true nature of this piece of evidence!\nBadd:\n...This is not... the same doubt I had...\nGregory:\nOh.\nvon Karma:\nThe only thing I question here is you, defense attorney. There can be no unidentified evidence before a Von Karma!\nGregory:\n(It wasn't this...!) Please wait. I still have some doubts left.\nLeads back to:\n\"(This is the piece of evidence left in Mr. Master's room that has yet to be identified!)\"\nGregory:\nSomebody left gloved fingermarks on one of Mr. Master's desserts.\nvon Karma:\n.....\nGregory:\nIf these were the killer's fingermarks... ...then it's possible that the killer also didn't leave any fingerprints on the murder weapon!\nvon Karma:\n.....How did you know the state of the crime scene?\nBadd:\n...I gave them... permission to investigate...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nBadd! What possessed you to let a defense attorney into the crime scene!?\nBadd:\nI don't recall... you telling me not to let them in...\nvon Karma:\nBah... Such impudence! ...You'd best remember, Badd... Your salary review depends on me!\nBadd:\n*gulp*...!\nRay:\n...This isn't good for Badd. I'm so glad I have a kind boss like Mr. Edgeworth!\nGregory:\n(Your salary review depends on how you perform here...)\nvon Karma:\nHmph... I'm surprised at what a mere attorney like you managed to uncover in such a short time. ...However, it's possible those fingermarks were Master's own thing. Because he always wore gloves while cooking!\nGregory:\nGregory:\nDo you have evidence that those fingermarks were left by Master? And moreover... there are still a few points of suspicion surrounding Delicia.\nvon Karma:\nOh...? You still haven't give up on that?\nDelicia:\nUuh... Greggy. You still suspect me? I've already apologized for stealing a few bites...!\nGregory:\n...I don't want to suspect you. However, I can't easily trust those who tell lies. You must still be hiding something!\nDelicia:\nUuh... Greggy is a bully...\nGregory:\nDon't you know the temperature fresh cream must be kept at? You call yourself a dessert chef, but you lack even the most basic knowledge.\nDelicia:\nUuh... I'm sorry. For my lack of knowledge...\nGregory:\nIn your case, it's not even about the lack of knowledge. In truth... you don't even know how to make desserts, do you?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nDefense attorney! Stop trying to force your own reasoning. ...In a court of law, the evidence tells all. If you say the witness is lying, show it with evidence!\nGregory:\nWe're not in court yet, but... very well. This evidence shows that Delicia can't make desserts.\nPresent Fake Desserts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The only things Delicia made were those that broke the rules.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nGregory:\nThis is the evidence!\nDelicia:\nThat doesn't prove anything! What a rude boy!\nBadd:\nReally... You are a rude boy.\nvon Karma:\nExactly, boy!\nGregory:\nNnghhoooh!\nRay:\nIt's alright! Young people are allowed to make mistakes!\nGregory:\n(I'm nowhere near your age... Good grief.) Well... Will you allow me to try again?\nLeads back to:\n\"This evidence shows that Delicia can't make desserts.\"\nGregory:\nThe only things Delicia made were those that broke the rules.\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nThe lamp and cloth that broke the rules were being held in Master's room. There is no way the witness could have returned them to her room!\nGregory:\nGregory:\nThose were not the only fake desserts she made.\nvon Karma:\n.....What?\nGregory:\nHer desserts may look like something out of a fairy tale at first glance... ...but in reality, they are nothing but mannequins, decorated with cream. Apart from the cream, they're all fake!\nvon Karma:\n...!\nGregory:\nThis is not something one aiming to become the world's greatest pastry chef would do.\nvon Karma:\n...Is this true, Badd?\nBadd:\nYes... My shoes... can attest to that...\nvon Karma:\n.....\nRay:\nWill that be enough to convince Prosecutor von Karma?\nGregory:\n(Once he sees what Delicia has done, he'll have no choice but to be convinced.) Delicia... The fact that your actions could lead to you being a suspect is no laughing matter.\nDelicia:\nTh-That's! I didn't murder...!\nGregory:\n...Isn't it time you told us the whole truth? Who are you? And why were you indulging yourself in another contestant's work!?\nDelicia:\n...Yessie... I understand.\nDelicia:\nThe truth is... I'm not really a dessert chef, like I led you to believe. I'm actually a pharmacist.\nRay:\nWhat! A pharmacist?\nGregory:\n(That's a completely different occupation... It's no wonder he couldn't hide his surprise.) Why is a pharmacist like you participating in this contest?\nDelicia:\n...I just love eating desserts. I joined because I thought I'd be able to eat some of Jeffy's desserts. I never thought I'd end up making it to the finals.\nvon Karma:\n.......\nGregory:\n(...Even Prosecutor von Karma is at a loss for words.)\nRay:\nS-So that's the real reason why you entered the contest?\nDelicia:\nYessie... As expected, Jeffy's desserts were oh-so-good.\nBadd:\nSo... The gloved fingermarks on the picture frame... were your doing?\nDelicia:\nEep! No way! I never wore gloves!\nGregory:\nDelicia's fingerprints were found on Mr. Master's chocolates. So it is true that she wasn't wearing gloves.\nDelicia:\nYessie! Exactly! You do believe me, Greggy!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\n...Is your face stuffed with nothing but desserts!?\nDelicia:\nEep! Sorry, Manny.\nGregory:\n(...I think it's her belly that's stuffed.) Were Master's desserts all that you ate?\nDelicia:\n...Actually, no. After the afternoon tea, I also ate Icy's desserts...\nGregory:\n! You mean you entered the victim's room?\nDelicia:\nYessie! Exactly. The room was empty after all.\nGregory:\n(Perhaps the victim was already dead by then...)\nDelicia:\nBut my first bite tasted way too salty and I couldn't eat it! So, I ate the delicious star-shaped dessert that was nearby.\nRay:\nMs. Delicious... You really are a glutton.\nGregory:\n(Is it rare you see a woman with this kind of appetite.)\nDelicia:\nThat's all I did. Greggy, Manny, everyone... I'm sorry I caused you trouble.\nGregory:\nNow that you've told us the truth, everything's fine. There's no need to apologize.\nvon Karma:\n...This does not mean that your testimony is trustworthy. I'll be investigating the victim's room after this. Only then will I decide if your testimony is true.\nGregory:\nProsecutor von Karma. I'd like to go as well. I also need to ascertain whether my reasoning up until now has been correct.\nvon Karma:\nHmph...! I'll let you follow, but I have no intention of letting you investigate.\nGregory:\n...That's enough for me.\nDecember 24, 9:00 PMContest VenueFrost's room\nvon Karma:\nThis...! What is the meaning of this!\nRay:\nThe desserts adorning the victim's room had disappeared without a trace. Was this the true killer's doing? A body that was hidden inside a dessert, and a murder weapon that was moved... Further investigation would be required to arrive at the truth of this case.\nTo be continued.\nApril 2, 10:15 AMZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio\nRay:\n...Oops, I guess I went on for a little too long there.\nEdgeworth:\nSomething like that... happened? I had no idea. None of the case files I read went into such detail.\nRay:\nWell, I doubt there would be anything in there that would be inconvenient to the prosecution. Especially with that Von Karma at the head.\nEdgeworth:\nHow did the investigation go from there?\nRay:\nThe desserts had disappeared from the victim's room, so the investigation hit a rough patch. Thanks to that, it took about a whole year before a verdict was handed down.\nEdgeworth:\nOne whole year...?\nRay:\nThis was before the whole 3-day pre-trial system was established. Trial didn't need to finish in the short amount of time that they do now.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see. Did they ever find out why the victim's dessert disappeared?\nRay:\nWell, kinda... His dessert was like a candy ice sculpture, made from sherbet... Since it was made from ice, the general consensus was that it had melted. ...However, that might not quite be the case.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean?\nRay:\nThis museum used to be Mr. Master's mansion.\nEdgeworth:\nThe stage of the IS-7 Incident...\nRay:\nAnd in this very place, they're exhibiting the \"Sherbet Salon\" from 18 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\n! The victim's dessert...?\nRay:\nYep. Though it could be just a replica of the original. That's why Uncle Ray had to come today, to check it out. ...And for your old man, too.\nEdgeworth:\n.....\nRay:\nNow then! Let's get a move on and check out the room! I'm pretty sure it's over in the \"Winter Palace.\" Hmm... The Winter Palace should be... Huh? It's... locked up. That's odd. They've already opened the museum.\nEdgeworth:\n...Mr. Shields. According to the pamphlet we received at the entrance, the Winter Palace is over here.\nRay:\nReally? I could've sworn it was this one. Alright, let's scoot. We gotta confirm the truth of what happened 18 years ago.\nApril 2, 10:20 AMZodiac Art GalleryWinter Palace\nRay:\nMan... It's still as cold as ever. Uncle Ray's gonna freeze solid.\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems the \"Winter Palace\" lives up to its name. It's like a freezer in here. (With the light dimmed like this, it's almost as if the room itself is made of ice...)\nRay:\nI think the control panel for the room temperature is on the back wall. Miles, why don't you check what temperature it's set at for me? Uncle Ray's gonna give the curator a piece of his mind later. It's way too cold in here.\nEdgeworth:\nHm... Very well.\nRay:\nBut if you want to look around the room a bit, feel free to stay, or freeze, to your heart's content. I'll get the camera ready. I want to take some pictures of this place and show it to your old man.\nEdgeworth:\n...Understood.\nIce block on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(For some reason, a giant block of ice is on display. There's a description written on the surface... Castor and Pollux. Every December, large meteor showers appear in the direction of these two stars...)\nWoman:\n.....And so, Mask☆DeMasque...\nMan:\n...And then, I...\nEdgeworth:\n(Those two are being rather noisy and distracting. It can't be helped. I should go look at another exhibit.)\nMan and woman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWoman:\n...Well, how about this? I'll yell out... \"Mask☆DeMasque is here!\"\nMan:\nYes! It's meeeeeeee! I'm Mask☆DeMasque!\nWoman:\nGood, good... Wait, Ronnie! If you say that, you'll get arrested! C'mon, if we don't plan properly, we won't be able to sell it.\nEdgeworth:\n(What are these two talking about...?)\nControl panel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm. Mr. Shields. I can't find the temperature control panel.\nRay:\nAh, right. They keep it where it's hard to find. Just one moment. Huh? It's locked. Makes sense. They wouldn't want the guests changing the temperature themselves.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAccording to the pamphlet, the Winter Palace has a temperature of 27℉.\nRay:\nBrrrr! Now that is cold. Uncle Ray's going to freeze to death! Guess I'll need to find someone to share body heat with. Preferably a beautiful lady.\nEdgeworth:\n.....\nRay:\nOh! Are you trying to freeze me to death as well with those cold eyes?\nEdgeworth:\nOf course not.\nRaymond Shields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\n...Miles. Can I ask you something?\nEdgeworth:\nOf course, what is it?\nRay:\nIs it okay... to take photos in this room?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat! Haven't you checked? ...But, if you haven't gotten any warnings about it, then it should be fine.\nRay:\nAh, sorry. Well, to be honest, I would've taken some anyway. Your old man had always wanted to investigate this \"Winter Palace\" after all.\nEdgeworth:\n(...If my father had seen this room, would he have found something? If he had, the results of the trial might have also... No, there's no point in thinking that now.)\nIce statues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere are two sculptures displayed here...\nRay:\nThese sculptures are replicas of the desserts that vanished 18 years ago. ...Impressive, huh. These sculptures made of ice.\nEdgeworth:\nYes... (My father never got to see these ice sculptures. And now... 18 years later, I'm standing before them.)\nRay:\n...Miles. Sorry to bother you while you're deep in thought. Could you turn this way a little?\nEdgeworth:\n...? Like this?\nRay:\nYes, yes. Like that.\nEdgeworth:\n! Mr Shields, you're not...\nRay:\nSay \"cheese!\"\nEdgeworth:\n...Mr Shields, please don't take pictures of me.\nRay:\nHe he he. Sorry, my bad. I just wanted to make sure the camera works okay.\nEdgeworth:\nThat camera... looks quite old.\nRay:\nYeah, well, that's because it's an old-fashioned camera. You know, an instant camera. It automatically develops the photos after shooting. Pretty cool, huh.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I know... Though I've never used one.\nRay:\nHe he he. You're quite the know-it-all. You really are the old man's son. Er, could you move a bit? I want to take some more photos of the room.\nEdgeworth:\n(His face has taken on an unusually serious expression. He's probably thinking about the IS-7 Incident...)\nRay:\nMan. I snapped a bunch! And they're already developed, see?\nEdgeworth:\n(...He shoved them in my face before I could reply.)\nRay:\nWell, I have one more question for you, Mr. Know-It-All! Do you know what these two sculptures represent?\nEdgeworth:\nThey're sculptures of Taurus and Gemini from the \"winter constellations\".\nRay:\nOoh! Bingo! Not bad, Miles. That's probably why they call this room the \"Winter Palace\". Uncle Ray is feeling generous today, so I'll give you a copy of this photo too.\nEdgeworth:\nUh... Th-Thanks.\nWinter Palace Photo data jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\n...Are these replicas of the constellation desserts that were made 18 years ago?\nRay:\nYeah. It looks like these two sculptures are also made out of sherbet. Uncle Ray's only seen the real sculptures in photos... ...but these sculptures look like the real deal.\nEdgeworth:\nThis was what you wanted to show me?\nRay:\nYeah... I think your old man would have wanted you to see it as well. I'm sorry. Uncle Ray didn't have the courage to come here alone.\nEdgeworth:\n...Don't apologize. This was a good opportunity to learn about my father's case.\nRay:\nThat means a lot to me. So, you want me to take another commemorative photo?\nEdgeworth:\nNo thanks.\nIce statues (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nTo create something like this out of sherbet... Even reproducing it would require considerable technique. The glass case seems to be lit up from the inside. If those stanchions weren't there, I could get a closer look.\nLamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis rock salt lamp is lighting up the constellation chart. I see... Gemini and Taurus are constellations that can be seen in the winter. Since this is the Winter Palace, perhaps that explains the winter constellations made of sherbet. According to the pamphlet, the other palaces are made of crystal. But for the Summer Palace, I think it'd be more fitting if it were made out of shaved ice... Well, no, that would make it exactly the same as this room... Hmm...\nExit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nMiles, since we came all the way here, why don't you take a look around?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, since this room is so cold, I thought I'd go to a warmer room...\nRay:\nIf you're that cold, why don't you borrow my clothes? And in exchange, I'll borrow your jacket.\nEdgeworth:\n...No thanks. (Let's try enduring this for just a little longer.)\nBoy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There's a boy with a school bag. Did he come to the art gallery... by himself?)\n???:\nHmm... She even quit her job in order to run this museum. I don't really get it.\nEdgeworth:\n(Perhaps... one of his parents knows the curator?)\nIce block on right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(A giant block of ice is being displayed here. It appears to be quite heavy... No, the inside must be hollow. On the surface, there is an image of the stars and a written description. The Pleiades... also known as the Seven Sisters. A star cluster that comprises a part of Taurus.) But, for all these stars to be grouped together as a cluster... The ways of the ancient people must have been very imprecise.\n(Examining control panel, ice statues, and ice block on right leads to:)\nRay:\nAlrighty, now that I've got some pictures of this room, let's check out the other places. Might as well see them all, since we're already here.\nEdgeworth:\n...I suppose you're right.\n???:\nAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!\nEdgeworth:\n! That yell just now...!\nRay:\nIt came from the Fountain Patio! Let's go, Miles!\nApril 2, 10:30 AMZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio\nEdgeworth:\n(There's someone passed out on the floor! And that man there is...!) Larry! What are you doing here!? No, I'm getting ahead of myself. What exactly happened here?\nLarry:\nE-Edgeyyyyy! I... I saw something that no one should ever have to see! Agaaain!\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, calm down! Why is there someone passed out here?\nLarry:\nI-I didn't do anything! He just fell down all of a sudden!\nRay:\n! This man... He can't be...!\n???:\nExcuse me, but what is the matter here?\n???:\nYou can't raise such a ruckus in the museum, boys.\nEdgeworth:\nHm? This scent is...!\nRay:\nSeems like he's still breathing, but this is a bad situation...! Miles, it's not safe here! Get everyone out of here!\nEdgeworth:\nEveryone, get away from that room right now! There's... poison gas coming out from it!\nApril 2, 10:42 AMZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. Mr. Shields. How is the victim?\nRay:\nIt looks like he breathed in a little too much of that poison gas... He's still unconscious. According to the doctor in the ambulance, there are no external injuries or any other wounds. Thanks to our fortunate timing, we were able to save him before he was too far gone... ...but he's not out of the woods yet. He's currently being treated by a specialist in the infirmary.\nEdgeworth:\nI see... Mr. Shields, is he an acquaintance of yours?\nRay:\nYeah, you could say that. He's Carmelo Gusto. He was involved in the IS-7 Incident.\nEdgeworth:\nThe pastry chef? (So he was involved in the case 18 years ago.)\nRay:\nAt least the other guy is doing alright. Is he a friend of yours, Miles?\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, you could say that. It is unfortunate you were not hurt, Larry.\nLarry:\nWhat's \"you could say that\" supposed to mean, Edgey!? How could you treat a childhood friend like that? That's just cruel! And also, when I'm dressed like this, I'm called Laurice Deauxnim, y'know. So don't call me \"Larry,\" It's \"Laurice!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(This man is Larry Butz. He's nothing but trouble, but he's been one of my friends since grade school. Some time ago, he awakened to the calling of art and assumed the alias \"Laurice Deauxnim\"... ...but a Butz by any other name would smell just as much.)\nRay:\nReally? You two are childhood friends? I better report that to your old man, too. I'm sure it will bring him joy. He was always worried about you not being able to make friends.\nLarry:\nGood for you, Edgey! Aren't you glad to have a bosom buddy like me?\nEdgeworth:\n(My father was worried about something like that...?) But anyway, what are you doing in a place like this, Larry?\nLarry:\nHow many times do I have to tell you, Edgey!? I'm \"Laurice\"!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat. Are you doing. In a place. Like this!?\nLarry:\nYikes! Don't glare at me when you talk!\nEdgeworth:\nSo are you going to tell me?\nLarry:\nIsn't it obvious? I've come here to study art! I'm going to take Mandy on a date here, so I was just doing some scouting beforehand!\nEdgeworth:\n(Aren't you just using art as an excuse to go on a date...?)\nRay:\nNot bad, Laurice! Maybe you can introduce some pretty girls to me next time.\nLarry:\nOh, now you're talkin' my language, dude!\nEdgeworth:\n(...I think I'm getting a headache.)\nRay:\nBy the way, Laurice... Did you notice anything strange when you found the victim?\nLarry:\nNah... not really.\nEdgeworth:\nNothing that would make you say, \"I saw something that no one should ever have to see\"?\nLarry:\nOh, yeah... That. I was just surprised when I saw that old dude fall down out of nowhere like that. I didn't do anything this time, for once!\nEdgeworth:\n...Is that anything to brag about!?\n???:\nVisitors, we wish to deeply apologize for the disturbance. I am the curator of this museum. My name is Katherine Hall.\nEdgeworth:\n(She's also one of the people involved in the IS-7 Incident...!)\nRay:\nHello there, Ms. Kate.\nKate:\nMonsieur Shields, thank you for your continued assistance.\nEdgeworth:\n(She was the woman we saw at the reception. So she's the curator here...)\nKate:\nWe apologize for the inconvenience, especially since it's the opening day...\nRay:\nNo, no. You don't have to apologize for a thing, Ms. Kate. Ah... I almost forgot. Let me introduce you to someone. This is Miles Edgeworth. ...He's Gregory Edgeworth's son.\nKate:\nOh! Monsieur Edgeworth's...! ♬ Oh! How wonderfuuuuuul! I meeeet the soooooon... Afteeer eighteeeeen years...! ♪ ♪ It is an honor to meet youuu! Deefeensee attooorneyyyy Miles Edgewooooooorth! ♬\nRay:\nWow, that was amazing! You still got that golden voice, Ms. Kate.\nEdgeworth:\n...Actually, I'm a prosecutor.\nKate:\nOh, so you are a prosecutor? My most sincere apologies, Monsieur Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(This woman is very polite, but... slightly odd.)\nLarry:\nU-Uh... Katey! Could I get your autograph right here, pretty please?\nKate:\nYes... if you so desire.\nEdgeworth:\nWhy do you want her autograph?\nLarry:\nHey! Don't tell me... You don't know who she is?\nRay:\nMy, my. You really don't keep up with the entertainment news, do you, Miles?\nEdgeworth:\n(What...? What is this unbearable atmosphere!?)\nRay:\nShe's a superstar actress who's been in tons of musicals and movies. She's a great singer too.\nKate:\n*giggle*... Currently, I am the curator of this museum. I have already retired from the stage. I finished filming my role for my last movie a few days ago. My costars also said that they would come here once I opened the doors. ...And here you are, Monsieur Artiste. I return this to you.\nLarry:\nThanks a bunch, Katey! I'll treasure it for the rest of my life!\nRay:\nWell, well. Looks like me and Laurice share the same interests.\nEdgeworth:\n(...So I gathered.) Larry, you said you're here to study art. Why don't you practice drawing as well? ...Since you're here at Ms. Hall's art museum.\nKate:\nOh! It would be an honor to have Monsieur Artiste sketch our exhibits.\nLarry:\nOh, I guess even you have some good ideas every now and then, Edgey! I'll do a bit of sketching for Katey here!\nKate:\nHee hee... what an amusing person.\nEdgeworth:\n...Forgive the disturbance. Incidentally, who was the woman that was with you earlier?\nKate:\nThat was Madame Delicia Scones. She is currently assisting in the treatment of Monsieur Gusto in the infirmary. Even though I said \"infirmary\", since this is an art museum now, it is only provisional. As I am the only staff member working here, I cannot take a leave of my duties for too long.\nEdgeworth:\nDelicia Scones... I believe we have heard that name before, Mr. Shields.\nRay:\nYep. Looks like the whole gang from the IS-7 Incident is here. Well. ...I doubt that's a coincidence.\nEdgeworth:\n......\nKate:\n...Monsieur Shields. Monsieur Edgeworth. Would you care for some hot tea?\nRay:\nOh! Ms. Kate's tea. That takes me back.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, if you please.\n...*clatter, clatter*...\nKate:\nNow, I must take my leave. I must explain the situation to the other visitors.\nRay:\nAlright, thanks for everything.\nEdgeworth:\n(This smells like... Ceylon tea. I should drink it before it cools.) Oh... This Ceylon tea is of very high quality. And this aroma of citrus...\nRay:\n\"Does wonders for your concentration,\" right?\nEdgeworth:\n!\nRay:\nHe he he, your old man said the exact same thing 18 years ago. But the saucers back then were chilled. Today they're warm.\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm. A-Anyway... Don't you think this current situation is rather unusual?\nRay:\nYou mean how everyone involved in the case 18 years ago has gathered at this museum?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. I would like to be in charge of this case, if at all possible...\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth, sir! Are you OK!?\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! Mr. Shields! I came here as fast as I could when I heard that you were done in by the poison gas!\nRay:\nOhh! My sweet honey Kay! How about a hug after being parted for so long?\nKay:\nNo. Geez! So you're perfectly fine? I can't believe you made us worry so much!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe... What is the meaning of bringing Kay here?\nGumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! I knew the gas was dangerous, so I tried to stop her... But no matter how much I ran and ran and and ran and ran, I couldn't gain any ground...\nKay:\n...He he heh, when it comes to running away, no one is faster than the Yatagarasu!\nEdgeworth:\n(But you weren't running away from here...)\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth, I'm all set, sir! I'll start investigating the crime scene! Since there might still be traces of gas in the room, I'll have to ask everyone to wait here.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well. I'm counting on you.\nRay:\nGood luck in there, flatfoot!\nKay:\nWow. Gummy's so cool! He's just like a detective!\nEdgeworth:\n(...But that's what he is...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, Edgeworth here.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth! It looks like the poison gas has dissipated, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, calmly explain the state of the Autumn Palace.\nGumshoe:\nYessir! I'll start with the exhibits. On the left, there's a statue with two people. And on the right, there's a statue of an animal with two horns.\nEdgeworth:\n(A statue of two people and a statue of an animal with horns... Isn't that the exact same thing I saw in the Winter Palace just a while ago...?)\nGumshoe:\nAlso, the room is wet with water thanks to the sprinkler system! That also prevented the gas from harming everyone else.\nEdgeworth:\nThe sprinkler system... Was there a fire in the room?\nGumshoe:\nThere are no signs of a fire, and the fire alarm hasn't gone off either, sir. The sprinklers in this museum are the kind that detects both smoke and fire. If it detects smoke, it will send an alert to the security room. I think the poison gas might have set off the alarm in the security room, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nWas there anyone in the security room at the time?\nGumshoe:\nThe only one working here is the curator, Ms. Katherine Hall, sir. She has been in the reception booth, opposite the security room ever since the museum opened.\nEdgeworth:\nDid Ms. Hall turn on the sprinklers?\nGumshoe:\nThe sprinkler system can only be operated manually from the security room, sir. If it had been automatic, it would have sprayed water all over the exhibits. Since the system is manual, the situation can be examined and the exhibits moved if need be.\nEdgeworth:\n(I guess there would be more priority over the exhibits than the building. Only at a museum.)\nGumshoe:\nBrrrr... But it's way too cold in this room, sir! Isn't this supposed to be the Autumn Palace? It feels more like the dead of winter in here!\nEdgeworth:\nThe Autumn Palace... is \"cold\"?\nGumshoe:\nI checked the thermostat earlier, and it was set to 27℉! I couldn't believe it!\nEdgeworth:\n(Why would the Autumn Palace be set to the same temperature as the Winter Palace...?)\nGumshoe:\nThat's about all I know for now, sir. If I figure out anything else, I'll give you another call!\nEdgeworth:\nI see. I'm counting on you, Detective.\nApril 2, 11:15 AMZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio\nKay:\nWhat did Gummy say?\nEdgeworth:\n...He said it feels more like winter in the Autumn Palace.\nKay:\n? I don't get it!\nEdgeworth:\nI haven't been able to enter the room personally... ...but it should be possible to look inside ater the police have finished investigating.\nRay:\nHmm. I'd like to know what it's like in there myself.\nKay:\nIsn't there anyone else who knows about the incident?\nRay:\nAah! There is someone! Miles' friend, right!\nKay:\nFriend...?\nEdgeworth:\n(Though he's such a nuisance, we have no choice but to listen to what he has to say for now...)\nKay:\nWait, you mean...!\nLarry:\nOh! You're here too Kay! You're looking as cute as ever!\nKay:\nEheheh. Long time no see! It's Larry... isn't it!\nLarry:\n...Kay, right now my name is \"Laurice\"... I'm an artist, that's why.\nKay:\nAh, so that's your pen name! Laurice, the artist formerly known as Larry!\nLarry:\nWow, you really are a good girl, Kay! ...Nothing like Edgey here.\nEdgeworth:\n..... Larry. I have many things I need to ask you.\nLarry:\nWhat's this! Don't tell me you suspect me again! You're gonna say because I was first on the scene, I must be the culprit, aren't you!?\nEdgeworth:\n...I never said anything like that. I only want you to tell me what you saw. You said you \"saw something that no one should ever have to see\", did you not?\nLarry:\nBUUUUT! Now I'm saying I didn't see nothing, and I didn't do nothing! ....Probably.\nRay:\nOh my, he didn't seem so confident at the end there.\nEdgeworth:\n...There are somewhat troublesome circumstances surrounding this man. The saying \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz\" still holds true, 26 years on. One could say his tendency to attract trouble is legendary. (It seems he's done something troublesome, without even realizing it himself... ...I'll just have to try and extract the truth from him.)\nEdgeworth:\nMy goal is to expose whatever Larry is hiding. However...\nLarry:\nI didn't see nothing, I didn't do nothing!\n3 CHESS PIECES\nEdgeworth:\n(Larry is an extremely restless and troublesome man. Until he cools down, I'll just wait and see.) First, I'll ask him about his goal. This isn't something I can't handle. I'll finish this quickly.\nBegin Logic Chess\nWhy did you come here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"What was your purpose for coming to the art gallery?\"\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was your purpose for coming to the art gallery?\nLarry:\nWhat!? Are you saying that I don't belong in an art gallery!?\nYou don't belong here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry! The statement you just made is full of problems!\nLarry:\nWhat's with you Edgey? Isn't that the case... with all my statements!?\nEdgeworth:\nH-He's suddenly serious...! (That was an unnecessary statement.) I must read my opponent's reactions and feelings, and strike with the right words!\nLeads back to first\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"......\"\nEdgeworth:\n......\nLarry:\nHey! If you're not gonna talk, hold that pose so I can paint your portrait! And then, I'll scribble all over the portrait I drew of you.\nYour paintings are all scribbles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry!

I would never scribble over my paintings, of course. They're works of art, after all!\nEdgeworth:\nI don't think any of your works would qualify as \"art\".\nLarry:\nDon't look down on me! There are people who recognize my skills as an artist!\nThose people are blind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry! The statement you just made is full of problems!\nLarry:\nWhat's with you Edgey?

But I thought she would be happy... if I did a sketch of her astrological sign.\nYou came to see the Gemini Sculpture?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hmph... I see. That's just like you.\"\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...........\nLarry:\nHuh? What? If you're not gonna talk, I'm going back to my sketching!\nEdgeworth:\nW-Wait!

To impress Mandy, you came here to see the Gemini Sculpture, didn't you?\n1 PIECE BROKEN\nLarry:\nWH-WHAAAAAAAAAT! How'd you find out!?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause you just unknowingly told me everything!\nLarry:\nW-Well then, I'm not saying another word from now on!\nEdgeworth:\nHe's finally decided to remain silent. In that case, I'll be more relentless in my questioning. I'll try to find out what he was doing here at the art gallery. I'll expose his true motives. This shouldn't take long!\nWhat did you do at the art gallery?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You... just what did you do in this art gallery!?\"\nEdgeworth:\nYou... just what did you do in this art gallery!?\nLarry:\nWh-What's with that glare...!?

It didn't look like there was anyone on the other side of the desk.\nEdgeworth:\nCome to think of it... Gumshoe did say something about that. Ms. Hall was busy activating the sprinklers from the security room. Because of the incident, she had to leave the reception booth.\nLarry:\nPoor Katey... She went to all that trouble to open up the palace. And now, the art gallery's star attraction, the \"Winter Palace\" is completely ruined...\nYou know about the Winter Palace?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You're certainly well-informed about the Winter Palace, for someone without a pamphlet.\"\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...........\nLarry:\nHuh?

H-How'd you find me out again!? That's right! My goal was to see the Gemini Sculpture! From the very beginning, the Winter Palace was the very reason why I came here!\nEdgeworth:\nHe confessed quite easily... You can never tell anything with this man. Next, I'll ask for further information regarding the Winter Palace. ...He may still have some fight left in him. I'll watch his reactions, and extract the information I need!\nDid you enter the Winter Palace?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry... Did you also enter the Winter Palace?\nLarry:\nWh-What's with... that look of distrust...!? Sure, I tried going in, but...\n\n\n\nYou couldn't get in?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You tried to go in... but you weren't actually able to, right?\"\n\n\n\n\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...........\nLarry:\nHuh?

I wanted to go in, but... Then that old geezer collapsed...

I'm sure the victim emerged from the Autumn Palace...)\nLarry:\nIf it weren't for that poison gas incident... ...I'd be in there sketching the Gemini Sculpture right now!\nEdgeworth:\nLarry must have mistaken the Autumn Palace for the Winter Palace... That aside, it seems his goal was to sketch the sculpture. Heh... this should be a useful clue.\nLeads back to first\nDid you enter the Winter Palace? (after clearing this option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.\nLeads back to first\nWhat did you see in the Winter Palace?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry. Did you see anything in the Winter Palace?\nLarry:\nYou're still hung up on that? Didn't I say that I didn't see anything? I started to think that it wasn't such a good idea to come to the art gallery. I needed to leave soon to meet with my girlfriend.\n\n\n\nBefore obtaining clue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm. I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. Maybe I should try another line of attack...\nLeads back to first\n\n\n\n\nAfter obtaining clue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Perhaps I should try using that clue...?\"\nI have no more use for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI have no more use for you...

You need to take responsibility for what you say!\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhooooooh! (I'm being lectured by HIM!) Please... I'd like to ask you a few more questions.\nLarry:\n...Fine. But you'll have to treat me to dinner.\nEdgeworth:\nNgh... (I need to be careful not to make careless statements...)\nLeads back to first\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps I should try using that clue...?\nWhat about your sketch?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You came here to sketch the sculpture for your girlfriend, did you not?\"\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...........\nLarry:\nHuh? What? If you're not gonna talk, I'm going back to my sketching!\nEdgeworth:\nW-Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and feelings, and strike with the right words!\nLeads back to first\nEdgeworth:\nYou came here to sketch the sculpture for your girlfriend, did you not? I don't think you would give up that easily! Even after the victim collapsed, you could still see inside the room from the outside, right?\nLarry:\nW-Well, I may have gotten a tiny glimpse, but... ...there's no evidence... that I saw something scary in there, right...?\nYou saw \"something scary\"?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"My, my... I'm disappointed it turned out to be this simple.\"\nYou covered your eyes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry! The statement you just made is full of problems!\nLarry:\nWhat's with you Edgey? Isn't that the case... with all my statements!?\nEdgeworth:\nH-He's suddenly serious...! (That was an unnecessary statement.) I must read my opponent's reactions and feelings, and strike with the right words!\nLeads back to first\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...........\nLarry:\nHuh? What? If you're not gonna talk, I'm going back to my sketching!\nEdgeworth:\nW-Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and feelings, and strike with the right words!\nLeads back to first\nEdgeworth:\nMy, my... I'm disappointed it turned out to be this simple. Larry. You saw \"something scary\" at the crime scene, didn't you!?\n1 PIECE BROKEN\nLarry:\nU-Uw-waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgey! You! Can you read my mind!? In that case... there's no point in keeping any more secrets from you!\nEdgeworth:\n...You just told me everything of your own accord. That was a complete waste of time, but, finally... It's checkmate.\nLogic Chess Complete\nLarry:\nI had my eyes fixed on the Gemini Sculpture...!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYou've mentioned the Gemini Sculpture many times now, but... I don't believe the sculpture you saw was the Gemini one.\nLarry:\nWh-What!? Was it a mirage then?\nEdgeworth:\n(Larry mistakenly thought he saw the Winter Palace.) This piece of evidence shows what Larry really saw!\nPresent Art Gallery Pamphlet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Take a look at this pamphlet.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis piece of evidence shows what you really saw!\nLarry:\n...Y'know, you really shouldn't put that much faith in your sense of aesthetics. If you'd like, I could teach you a thing or two about art.\nEdgeworth:\nNgh...! I-It's fine! (So it's not this piece of evidence... Larry mistakenly thought he saw the Winter Palace. But what he saw was not the Gemini Sculpture from the Winter Palace! I must have evidence that proves that...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"This piece of evidence shows what Larry really saw!\"\nEdgeworth:\nTake a look at this pamphlet. In the Autumn Palace... The Pisces, Capricorn, Aries, and Aquarius sculptures are displayed. Incidentally, I can confirm that the Gemini Sculpture is located in the Winter Palace. Therefore, the sculpture you saw could not have been the Gemini one!\nLarry:\n......I knew it.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Hm. I expected him to be a bit more shocked at the news...)\nLarry:\nI thought it was kinda strange. I know I saw a single goddess. ...And that transformation was no mirage.\nEdgeworth:\n...\"Transformation\", you say?\nLarry:\nOh! You're curious too, Edgey? Well, nothing for it, guess I'll have to show you!\nEdgeworth:\n...Show me? What, exactly?\nLarry:\nI drew a picture of the very scene I saw back then! But, I really can't believe what I drew.\nKay:\nPicture, what picture?\nLarry:\nThis one, right here!\nEdgeworth:\nWh... What! What is this disturbing picture!? Is that sculpture weeping tears of blood?\nKay:\nLaurice! ...This picture is scary!\nLarry:\nKay! It scared me too! This Gemini Sculpture suddenly transformed into a goddess right before my eyes. I couldn't help but scream.\nEdgeworth:\n(...So the victim collapsing wasn't what surprised him.) What do you mean when you say \"transformed\"?\nLarry:\nI don't really understand it myself! The lower half of its body just turned into a fish!\nRay:\nA fish goddess... That would be the Pisces Sculpture, wouldn't it. In mythology, Pisces represents the fish that a goddess and her son transform into.\nKay:\nReally! So Pisces isn't just a couple of ordinary fish?\nLarry:\nEdgey... you don't think that sculpture is cursed, do you? Those tears of blood turned the Gemini Sculpture into a fish.\nEdgeworth:\n...Preposterous. You simply mistook the Pisces Sculpture for the Gemini one.\nPisces Sketch data jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay:\nOh. You put the sketch in your Organizer?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Even a sketch like this can be used as scrap paper, after all.\nLarry:\nHow could you!\nRay:\nBut, it's strange. Why did only the lower half of the sculpture transform? Uncle Ray is a bit curious about what went on in the Autumn Palace.\nEdgeworth:\n(Indeed... I wonder if someone tampered with the Pisces Sculpture.) Yes. Edgeworth here.\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth! We've finished searching the room! The poison gas isn't a threat anymore, so you can enter the crime scene!\nEdgeworth:\nRight. Good work, Detective. ...It seems we can enter the Autumn Palace now.\nRay:\nNice timing, Mr. Detective.\nKay:\nLet's go right now! I wanna see the Pisces Sculpture!\nLarry:\nIf Kay's going, I'm going too.\nEdgeworth:\n(...I was planning on bringing him along anyway.) Right then, let's proceed to the Autumn Palace.\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the Autumn Palace... (It certainly does resemble the Winter Palace.)\nGumshoe:\nI've been waiting, sir! ...Huh? Aren't you... that Harry Butz guy!\nLarry:\nWrong! I'm Laurice Deauxnim!\nEdgeworth:\n.....Never mind that, Detective. Your report, if you please.\nGumshoe:\n...Roger that, sir! Err... We discovered a used gas burner during our investigation. The nozzle was still warm when we found it, so it may be related to the incident.\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm. (Was it used to heat something?)\nUsed Gas Burner data jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nWas that ladder always there on the ground?\nGumshoe:\nIt was probably used by the person who set off the poison gas. The poison gas was released when someone lifted the lid off that glass case, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nHm...? ! The Pisces Sculpture...!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Seems like you know about it, sir. Well then, do you know what the sculpture next to it is?\nEdgeworth:\nSince we're in the Autumn Palace, it would probably be the Capricorn Sculpture.\nGumshoe:\nAs expected of Mr. Edgeworth! I thought it was Taurus myself. I was thrown off as it was covered by this weird cloth!\nRay:\nThe fluorescent cloth! I wonder what it's doing here.\nEdgeworth:\n(Evidence from the IS-7 Incident...!)\nFluorescent Cloth data jotted down in my Organizer.\nGumshoe:\nNo matter what it is or how it got here... The sculptures in this room are all covered with this fluorescent cloth.\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue cloth of Fluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA blue cloth... I guess this kind of relaxing color is nice once in awhile.\nRay:\nMiles. You're starting to sound like your old man.\nEdgeworth:\n(I don't want to hear that from Mr. Shields...)\n\n\n\n\nGlowing cloth of Fluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe cloth is glowing with a light blue aura.\nRay:\nAccording to the detective's report, it was wrapped around the statue like this.\nEdgeworth:\n...So it would seem. (How is this related to our case?)\n\n\n\n\nSwitches on machine of Fluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAccording to Mr. Shields, this allows you to change the color of the cloth. Let me try it out. Hmm. The cloth has started to glow.\nKay:\nAnd because they're hidden, it makes me want to see them even more.\nGumshoe:\nLet's take a look! I'll just get this cloth off.\nKay:\nWow! They're beautiful!\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't think... the \"transformation\" Larry saw... Was, in fact, the moment the cloth wrapped around the lower half of Pisces fell...?\nLarry:\nSee, Edgey! It wasn't a mirage or a mistake after all!\nEdgeworth:\nNgh...!\nRay:\nHey... Miles. There sure is something strange about this room. It looks exactly the same as the Winter Palace we were in just a moment ago.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. I agree. Perhaps the sculptures were hidden to make it look like the Winter Palace. If you wrap the cloth around the lower half of the Pisces Sculpture, it looks like Gemini.\nRay:\nCapricorn is a half-fish too. Hide the lower half and it resembles Taurus. The remaining two, which couldn't be altered with trickery, were covered up.\nEdgeworth:\nThe Autumn Palace was made to look like the Winter Palace. So it seems... Mr. Shields. It looks like we'll need to conduct an investigation of the Autumn Palace too.\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Debeste and Judge Gravelle...!\nDebeste:\nHey, hey, hey! You guys again!? This is a problem. You see, this is MY crime scene.\nGravelle:\nMr. Edgeworth... it seems my power is insufficient. If you're here, then it would appear that you still haven't understood my warnings.\nEdgeworth:\nNgh...!\nGravelle:\nFurthermore... you know full well your reckless actions will cause trouble for that detective. In the name of the Goddess of Law, I must pass judgement.\nGumshoe:\nYou've got it all wrong, pal! I was the one who asked Mr. Edgeworth to investigate!\nDebeste:\nReally? Well then, flatfoot, I'll have to do \"that\".\nGumshoe:\n\"That\"...?\nDebeste:\nYeah, \"that\"... err. Right! Cut your salary! Looking forward to your next payday!? I've always wanted to say that!\nGumshoe:\nUugh... You're the last person I want cutting my salary, pal.\nEdgeworth:\nHold it, Debeste. I am only cooperating with the police as a witness to this incident. ...Detective Gumshoe is not to blame.\nDebeste:\nHmmm. So that's how it is. Well then, should I be raising his salary?\nEdgeworth:\n...No, that's not what I meant.\nGumshoe:\nBut, it would be really nice to get my salary raised.\nGravelle:\nYour mercy is deeply moving, Sebastian. But past transgressions must lead to future judgement. Prosecutor Edgeworth, and all in his company. Depart at once from this holy site.\nKay:\nB-But that's! We only just got here!\nGravelle:\nThe one given the Goddess of Law's blessing for this incident was Sebastian.\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, Mr. Debeste is the prosecutor in charge of this case...\nDebeste:\nThat's right, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening performance is over! Besides, I've already got my eyes set on the culprit!\nGumshoe:\nWhaaaaaaat!? Wh-Who, pal?\nDebeste:\nWell, naturally! ...That artist!\nLarry:\nM... Me? Hey! What's going on Edgey!\nEdgeworth:\nDon't ask me. I can't understand his reasoning.\nDebeste:\nTsk tsk tsk... If you can't understand how the best prosecutor thinks, it simply shows how inculpable you are.\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems he doesn't know what \"inculpable\" even means...)\nGravelle:\n...That's right, Sebastian. Prosecutor Edgeworth is quite \"incapable\".\nDebeste:\nUmm. Yes! He's incapable!\nKay:\n...She just nonchalantly corrected him.\nDebeste:\nDon't underestimate my intelligence gathering skills! I just came from the infirmary and asked the doctor there... ...about the cause of the poison gas!\nEdgeworth:\n...And what was the cause?\nDebeste:\nErr. Some \"normal\" substance... What was its name again? H-Hold on a second. I'll call the doctor to make sure.\nGravelle:\nSince Sebastian is on the phone, I'll answer for him.\nKay:\n...In that case why didn't you tell us before he called?\nGravelle:\nThe poison gas was caused by the mixing of two different types of chemicals. Their names are Normallium and Fatallium.\nKay:\nSo, what are those chemicals exactly?\nGravelle:\nNormallium is a red liquid that's commonly used in everyday products. It can be found in paint and detergent, among other things, but it is not toxic by itself.\nEdgeworth:\n...So you're saying that it's a substance readily available to anyone.\nGravelle:\nYes. But Fatallium, on the other hand, is not so easy to obtain.\nKay:\nIts name sure sounds dangerous. What's it used for?\nGravelle:\nIt is the active ingredient of a white pesticide known as Megatoxin X. Fatallium itself also has a deep white color, but it's not readily sold in stores. It's nearly impossible to obtain domestically. Right now, we are looking into how this chemical was obtained.\nPoison Gas data jotted down in my Organizer.\nDebeste:\nOK! I've finally found out the names of those chemicals!\nEdgeworth:\n...Judge Gravelle has already told us. We don't need to hear it again.\nDebeste:\nEh. ...Fine, then. I'll cut to the chase! You know that Normallium from the poison gas is also used in paint, right? Today, out of everyone who visited the art gallery, the only one carrying paint... ...was that artist!\nLarry:\nY-You're treating me as the culprit just because of that!\nDebeste:\nI object... to the red paint on the palette you're carrying!\nLarry:\nHey, Edgey... Don't you think this prosecutor is kind of an idiot?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. Although I've known him for a short time, his logic is always absurd.\nDebeste:\nHey! Don't ignore me!\nGravelle:\nIt's alright, Sebastian. They're only doing it because they're afraid of you. Like the first star to appear at night, show us reasoning that shines the best.\nDebeste:\nThe first star shines best... Not bad. Hey, you guys better listen up too!\n-- Mr. Debeste's Shining Logic --\nDebeste:\nThat artist was the \"first\" to discover the victim, so naturally he's the \"best\" suspect!\nThe poison gas was caused by Normallium, a chemical found in paint, right?\nAs he was carrying paint near the victim, he would've had the \"best\" chance.\nThe paint, along with being the first witness! ...That pretty much proves he's the culprit!\nDebeste:\n...So! What do you think, Verity?\nGravelle:\n...We cannot ignore the possibility. Well then, Mr. Artist. Please tell us the truth. Did you leave red paint at the crime scene? Or else... Did you cause the poison gas to go off?\nLarry:\nThe only thing I leave behind is my \"bond of love\" with you...\nGravelle:\n...Please watch what you say. My gavel is already prepared to declare you guilty.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nPlease pay no heed to this man's statements.\nDebeste:\nDebeste:\nHey, hey, you guys! Ignoring my reasoning just because it's flawless won't do you any good. Mr. Edgeworth, if you've already admitted defeat, you should take your leave!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Even though I don't really have time to deal with your ridiculous reasoning...\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Indeed, at first glance this man seems suspicious, however... Debeste: Debeste: At \"first\" glance...? Ugh... What's with that \"first\" all of a sudden! You! Are you trying to steal my spot as the star that shines \"best\"!? Larry: Huh? Would that make me the \"best\" artist? Edgeworth: ...Larry! Don't make this any more confusing than it already is! Mr. Debeste, continue your reasoning, now!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Yes. Apparently, Normallium is used in many everyday products. Debeste: Right! So the red paint is definitely suspicious! Kay: But, it's also used in things other than paint, right? Debeste: Hm. I guess you have a point. ...What do you think, Verity? Gravelle: That's right. Normallium is also used in detergent, for example. Edgeworth: In other words... it might not have been paint that caused the gas. Debeste: Th-That's not true! Let me finish my reasoning!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Even if paint is the cause of the poison gas, that does not mean he is guilty. Debeste: Ha ha! Well then, if the paint is NOT the cause, that doesn't mean he's innocent either! Kay: Now he's just trying to sound clever. Mimicking what Mr. Edgeworth says won't make you look cool at all! Edgeworth: ...Kay, please don't make my statements look bad. Debeste: Now then! It's about time... to wrap up my shining logic!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you truly claim that Larry is the culprit based on just that? Debeste: Huh? You got a problem with that? ...If you have a problem, then present evidence! Kay: Mr. Edgeworth. It looks like he really wants you to do that. Edgeworth: Indeed. Then I will do as he wishes and present evidence.\nEdgeworth: It seems he doesn't pay much attention to what other people are saying. There is a clear contradiction in Mr. Debeste's logic.\nKay: Why'd he even bother making the phone call?\nEdgeworth: (I'll finish this quickly. ...This is a waste of time.)",

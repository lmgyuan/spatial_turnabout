  "previousContext": "Although this is technically a separate \"case\", for the purposes of this wiki this transcript will be treated as a continuation of Twisted Karma and His Last Bow.\nFinal ChapterThe Resolve of Ryunosuke Naruhodo\n3rd November, 9:14 a.m.\nThe Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber\nRyunosuke:\n(So...the time's finally come. Today...we unravel everything!) I'll be counting on your support more than ever today, Miss Susato!\nSusato:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nUm... Miss Susato?\nSusato:\nAh! Oh no! W-What's the matter, Mr Naruhodo?\nRyunosuke:\nUm...nothing? I was just saying that I'll be relying on your support today, but...\nSusato:\nI'm so sorry! Of course! I, I know I can be rather incompetent at times, but... ...I shan't let you down!\nRyunosuke:\n...Would you mind helping me to my feet, then?\nSusato:\nOh dear! I'm really very sorry!\nRyunosuke:\n(Susato-san isn't her usual self at all. But that's hardly surprising, I suppose. She's just found out that her father is the partner of a world-famous detective. Not to mention...)\nSusato:\nAh! G-Good morning, sir!\nRyunosuke:\n...! Lord van Zieks!\nVan Zieks:\nThank you for all your efforts yesterday.\nRyunosuke:\nWha... (Did I hear that correctly?)\nVan Zieks:\n...What?\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Um, no, nothing. Just...I hope we can clear things up today. (I really can't make this man out. His face says 'I hate you' but his words are...almost jovial today. In fact, he hasn't been very Reaper-like at all since this all began yesterday.)\nSusato:\nLord van Zieks isn't the Reaper, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\n...Good point.\nVan Zieks:\nThe Reaper? I suppose in hindsight... ...I shouldn't have allowed that misconception to go unchallenged.\nRyunosuke:\nHuh?\nVan Zieks:\nIt was my tacit acceptance of the pseudonym... My failure to stop the Reaper becoming something more than a mere legend...that led to all this.\nSusato:\nBut you're not to blame for that, Lord van Zieks!\nRyunosuke:\nIt's only because serious crime in the capital dropped off so sharply when the public started calling you that. That's why you didn't say anything, isn't it?\nVan Zieks:\n...To be frank, I'm not sure that was the sole reason.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat do you mean?\nVan Zieks:\nThere was a rumour at the time that the Reaper was really the ghost of my late brother.\nSusato:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nThat having been slain by that evil killer, Klint's restless spirit returned as some sort of demigod... ...to wield a deadly blade of justice where I, by dint of the law, could not.\nRyunosuke:\nYes...we've heard that story too.\nVan Zieks:\nWhen I lost him... ...I felt as though I'd lost my guiding light.  I didn't know where to go or what to do. And so... ...in some small way, I wonder if perhaps those rumours made me feel his absence a little less keenly. Even if I knew it was just an illusion. Just some nonsense conjured up by an over-imaginative public.\nSusato:\nHe was obviously extremely important to you. Lord Klint van Zieks...\nRyunosuke:\nWell...what's important now is uncovering the truth. That's all that matters. I...know that you didn't take anyone's life.\nVan Zieks:\n...!\nRyunosuke:\nAnd I intend to prove that beyond a shadow of a doubt in court today.\nVan Zieks:\n......... I never thought I'd say this... ...but I can see it in your eyes. That burning desire to cut through all the lies and deception. I can't deny it any longer. You...are a lawyer of absolute integrity.\nRyunosuke:\n...Thank you.\nVan Zieks:\nNow tell me... ...why do I detect the scent of expensive tea leaves in the air?\nRyunosuke:\nOh! Iris! When did you get here?\nSusato:\nOh!\nIris:\nAh! Um... I brought you one of my special blends. Hurley loves it. He says it helps him to clear his head!\nVan Zieks:\n...I thank you.\nIris:\nOh... Hee hee...\nRyunosuke:\n(That's surely the first and last time I'll ever see a sight like this...) You seem different today, Iris.\nIris:\nOh...?\nRyunosuke:\nSort of...subdued, I suppose.\nIris:\nI am not!\nRyunosuke:\n(What happened yesterday is obviously still playing on her mind a lot. She's clearly very troubled about having stolen that autopsy report from Dr Sithe's laboratory.)\nIris:\nAlright then...good luck to you both! I have to make a move now.\nSusato:\nOh! You're not staying?\nRyunosuke:\nI thought you'd want to watch today's proceedings.\nIris:\nWell...I'd like to cheer you on, obviously. But I've got lots to get ready.\nRyunosuke:\nGet ready? For what?\nIris:\nOh, yes. Would you take this?\nRyunosuke:\nIsn't that one of the little felt dolls that's usually dangling from your knapsack?\nIris:\nYes! It's a lucky charm! A little Hurley that I made once.\nRyunosuke:\nA 'Hurley'? (It looks more like a 'Hareley' to me...)\nIris:\nIf for some reason you completely run out of options in the trial today... ...then just pull this little Hurley's ears as hard as you possibly can!\nRyunosuke:\nWha...? Pull his ears?\nIris:\nThat's right! It's a way to bring good luck. ...I think you might need it!\nIris's lucky charm has been entered into the Court Record.\nSusato:\nY-You think...what we'll need is luck...?\nIris:\nI just sneaked a peek inside the courtroom. And...it seemed very different to normal.\nVan Zieks:\nYes, it would seem... ...that a certain someone has decided to pull out all the stops.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat does that mean?\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nSusato:\nWhat about Mr Sholmes, Iris?\nIris:\nI...don't know. He was out all night and he hadn't come home by the time I left this morning.\nSusato:\nOh... I see...\nRyunosuke:\nWas Professor Mikotoba out all night too, do you think, Miss Susato?\nSusato:\nYes, it would seem so. I telegrammed the hotel this morning... ...and apparently they didn't come back to their rooms last night at all.\nRyunosuke:\n'They'?\nSusato:\nFather and Judge Jigoku, I mean.\nRyunosuke:\nJudge Jigoku, too?\nSusato:\nThat's right. Nobody appears to have seen either of them since yesterday.\nBailiff:\nCounsel for the Defence and the defendant! Court is about to be in session. Please make your way inside the courtroom at once!\nIris:\nGood luck then, Runo! Good luck, Susie!\nRyunosuke:\nYes...thanks, Iris.\nIris:\nAnd you, Mr Reaper. I hope it goes well!\nVan Zieks:\nOnce again, I thank you for the delicious tea, It was very soothing.\nIris:\nOh, I'm so glad!\nSusato:\nWe must go inside now, Lord van Zieks!\nVan Zieks:\nHm...\nRyunosuke:\n(Lord van Zieks has always been the formidable prosecutor I've had to lock horns with in court. But not today. Today I battle with another in pursuit of the truth. My best friend, Kazuma Asogi, who I trust more than anyone else in the world. Now I understand what it was that drew me here to Britain all those months ago. Now I know exactly what destiny had in store for me. It's all been leading up to this one day... To this one trial... To this one final reckoning!)\n3rd November, 9:30 a.m.\nThe Old Bailey Courtroom\nRyunosuke:\nIt feels even more oppressive here than it did yesterday... (There are cold stares piercing me like knives from all sides today.)\nSusato:\nAh! M-Mr Naruhodo! Look!\nRyunosuke:\nL... Lord Stronghart!\nKazuma:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n(Kazuma must have known beforehand...)\nStronghart:\nThe ramifications of this trial now extend far beyond the murder of one Scotland Yard inspector. In fact, events have come to light that threaten to rock the very foundations of our country's legal system.\nKazuma:\nThe escape of a condemned criminal on the night of his execution...the subsequent unlawful shooting of the man... ...and the revelation that prison staff must have been complicit in the jailbreak.\nStronghart:\nBritain is currently hosting influential members of the judiciary from countries all around the world. It is imperative that we uncover the truth in these proceedings to avoid international embarrassment. By royal decree, this will continue to be a closed trial... ...and one over which I, Mael Stronghart, exercise total and unequivocal authority.\nRyunosuke:\nThe, the six jurors' flames just...\nStronghart:\nAs was the case in yesterday's proceedings, those here present in the public gallery... ...are distinguished members of our judiciary, assembled to bear witness to a fair judicial process.\nVan Zieks:\nIn other words...a collection of your acolytes, Lord Stronghart.\nStronghart:\n......... On a personal note, I find this most distressing, Lord van Zieks. You were a prosecutor of exceptional talent. Much like your brother Klint in fact...\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nStronghart:\nIn the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session... ...for the trial of Barok van Zieks, who officially stands accused of murder.\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nStronghart:\nCounsels for the prosecution and defense...are you in full readiness to proceed?\nRyunosuke:\nThe defence is ready...My Lord.\nKazuma:\nAs is the prosecution.\nStronghart:\nYesterday's proceedings brought to light a shocking and disturbing fact: There was a side to the victim, Inspector Tobias Gregson, that was unknown to his superiors at Scotland Yard.\nKazuma:\nYes, he was carrying out operations in secret, which Scotland Yard knew nothing about.\nStronghart:\nAnd in those clandestine operations, he had an accomplice.\nKazuma:\nMr Daley Vigil, who would be given the inspector's identification... ...and present himself around the capital in order to establish credible alibis for Gregson. In that way, Gregson appeared to be carrying out his regular Scotland Yard work when in fact he wasn't.\nStronghart:\nAt the end of yesterday's session, Mr Vigil, who had been suffering from amnesia, regained his memory. It would appear he buried his memories of the time deep inside himself as a means of self-preservation. Because whilst he was engaged as chief warder at Barclay Prison, he abetted the convict's escape.\nKazuma:\nMr Vigil is currently recuperating at St Synner's. He's recovered enough to give a signed statement about his movements on the day prior to the incident. He's formally admitted to posing as Gregson whilst investigating the Red-Headed League.\nStronghart:\nWhich brings us to the crucial issue of the victim's time of death. The defence yesterday proposed a suggestion that the victim may have been killed one day earlier. This was based largely on the discovery that the victim's pocket watch had not been wound.\nKazuma:\nThe prosecution has something to report on that subject, My Lord.\nStronghart:\nReally? Go ahead, Prosecutor Asogi.\nKazuma:\nI met once again with the coroner yesterday to discuss the issue. She confirmed that the defence's suggestion could not be ruled out.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nKazuma:\nIt's entirely possible that Inspector Gregson was killed on 31st October - the day before his body was discovered. I have here an updated autopsy report that includes the amended details.\nStronghart:\nBut the official opinion of the investigation team was made clear yesterday. That the time of death was 5 p.m. on 1st November.\nKazuma:\nThere are indications of an attempt to disguise the real time of death, however. It seems that the natural decaying process of the victim's body may have been slowed by keeping it chilled.\nStronghart:\nThat's out of the question. There are no refrigeration devices in that part of London large enough to accommodate a human corpse.\nRyunosuke:\nMy Lord! This is more than just conjecture. There's evidence to support the idea. We must investigate it thoroughly.\nStronghart:\n...Very well. The court will accept the new report as evidence. However, if this updated report is deemed to be accurate... ...it would give renewed significance to the movements of the victim on the day before the Fresno Street incident.\nKazuma:\nIt would, yes. Especially since on that day... ...Inspector Gregson was using Mr Vigil to cover up his real movements. It's conceivable that he was killed in the course of his secret activities.\nStronghart:\nDo I sense that the prosecution has some information regarding those activities?\nKazuma:\nScotland Yard put an enormous effort into investigating that precise matter yesterday.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nKazuma:\nI think we should begin by presenting the results of that investigation work. So the prosecution calls its first witness now!\nKazuma:\nState your name and occupation for the court.\nGina:\nInspector Gina Lestrade, reportin'! Reper...sentive o' Scotland Yard!\nKazuma:\n...A self-conferred rank, but never mind.\nRyunosuke:\n(Gina? Again?)\nGina:\nWot's yer problem, 'Oddo? Wot's wiv that 'Gina? Again?' look, eh?\nRyunosuke:\nAh!\nGina:\nThe boss meant the world to me. 'E done more for me than anyone else ever did!\nStronghart:\nOh? Inspector Gregson, you mean?\nGina:\n'E got me out the back slums o' the East End an' took me under 'is wing. Taught me that life can 'ave a purpose. So that's why I'm the best person to be standin' 'ere speakin' for 'im!\nSusato:\nOh Gina...\nRyunosuke:\n(Right, all out of the goodness of Gregson's heart. Not at all that he had his arm twisted by Mr Sholmes. No...)\nKazuma:\nWhat's relevant to these proceedings is that the outcome of Scotland Yard's investigations yesterday... ...has revealed that the victim was carrying out some assignment the police knew nothing about.\nStronghart:\nVery troubling...\nRyunosuke:\n(That face... Lord Stronghart knew!)\nKazuma:\nSo...Inspector Lestrade! Let's hear exactly what it says in that report!\nGina:\nComin' right up, sir!\nWitness Testimony\n- The Victim's Movements -\nGina:\nAll Yard detectives are s'posed to follow orders an' investigate wot they're told.\nBut a little search o' the boss's office turned up a notebook that 'ad a load of secret meetin's in it.\nAccordin' to that, the boss was lookin' into some smuggled goods dealin's that day.\nLooks like it was a big job an' all. But the coppers weren't on to it yet.\nWot matters most is, there's witnesses wot saw the Reaper at the place, too!\nRyunosuke:\nSmuggled goods?!\nGina:\nI dunno, do I? I'm just tellin' ya wot was written in the book!\nKazuma:\nTobacco, tea, spices, medicines... Goods of all sorts flow into London by illegal channels from across the globe. It's well known that they're disposed of at regular black markets that take place in the capital. But the police are rarely able to locate them in time.\nRyunosuke:\nSo Inspector Gregson was investigating one of those black markets?\nStronghart:\nIt's been suggested that high-ranking government officials may be involved in black-market activity. No doubt Gregson was trying to avoid details of his investigations being leaked to the involved parties. That would explain why he was operating on his own authority, without the Yard's knowledge.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd do we know where the dealings were taking place this time?\nKazuma:\nIn a particular room of a certain exclusive London gentleman's club. And on the day in question...the accused is known to have been there. That's the conclusion of Scotland Yard's investigation into the matter.\nRyunosuke:\nThat can't be...! (We haven't heard anything about any of this!)\nKazuma:\nMembers of the club have testified to it. There's no question: the accused, Barok van Zieks, was present.\nStronghart:\nThat would be very significant testimony, then.\nSusato:\nOh my! But, but... ...Lord van Zieks made no mention of this! At all!\nKazuma:\nIn short, Lord van Zieks had ample opportunity to murder the victim.\nStronghart:\nVery well, then. Counsel for the Defence, begin your cross-examination!\nCross-Examination\n- The Victim's Movements -\nGina:\nAll Yard detectives are s'posed to follow orders an' investigate wot they're told.\nGina:\nBut a little search o' the boss's office turned up a notebook that 'ad a load of secret meetin's in it.\nGina:\nAccordin' to that, the boss was lookin' into some smuggled goods dealin's that day.\nGina:\nApparently the smuggled goods deal was gonna 'appen at a gentleman's club called 'The Grouse'.\nGina:\nLooks like it was a big job an' all. But the coppers weren't on to it yet.\nGina:\nWot matters most is, there's witnesses wot saw the Reaper at the place, too!\nRyunosuke:\n(So that's all I've got to work with... Gina's not holding back with that ice-cold stare of hers, is she?)\nSusato:\nI really don't know what to make of all this.\nRyunosuke:\nLord van Zieks told us that he was investigating Inspector Gregson... ...but he never once mentioned that he met the inspector the day before the incident.\nSusato:\nYou don't think Lord van Zieks could have been lying to us, do you?\nRyunosuke:\n...That's not the only way to explain this.\nSusato:\nOh!\nRyunosuke:\nIf everything Lord van Zieks has told us is true... ...then there must be a mistake in this testimony somewhere.\nSusato:\n...! You mean, there are details we've yet to uncover?\nRyunosuke:\nExactly. (A clue perhaps, that even Gina hasn't noticed. That's what we should be looking for here!)\nRyunosuke:\nI've read about these clubs that exist here in Britain. As I understand it, they're places where well-to-do gentlemen socialise with friends and colleagues.\nKazuma:\nDon't imagine for a second that a foreign student like you would be admitted.\nRyunosuke:\n(Seriously, is your mirror cracked or something?) Do we know for sure that the contraband dealings were definitely happening at a club called 'The Grouse'?\nKazuma:\n...The police are currently looking for evidence... but haven't found anything definitive yet.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd I'm sorry to say that they probably won't.\nKazuma:\nWhat do you mean by that?\nRyunosuke:\nI mean that the place Inspector Gregson was secretly going to visit on 31st October... ...may not have been a gentleman's club at all.\nStronghart:\n...You're showing a very irreverent attitude towards our country's police force there, Counsel. If it wasn't a gentleman's club...then what was it?\nRyunosuke:\n...A steamship.\nKazuma:\nYou think...it's a ship...?\nRyunosuke:\nI have the evidence to prove it here!\nStronghart:\nLet me see that. 'This dark-suited young man is not in the least bit untrustworthy.'\nRyunosuke:\nAh! Um...the other side, My Lord.\nStronghart:\n...Be more specific next time. ...! Ah... This would appear to be a ticket for passage upon a steamship, yes... The SS Grouse...\nKazuma:\nKazuma:\nSo there's a steamship named the Grouse that happens to share a name with the club. But I'm afraid to say... ...there's a flaw in your logic there.\nRyunosuke:\nHow?\nKazuma:\nLook at the ticket. Notice the date of arrival in port.\nStronghart:\nThe ship arrived at the Port of Dover on 1st November. ...Ah!\nKazuma:\nThe day on which the sound like a gunshot was heard on Fresno Street. In other words... ...on the day in question here - 31st October - when the victim was on his clandestine mission... ...that ship hadn't yet docked on British shores!\nStronghart:\nThat would certainly make an undercover investigation somewhat challenging.\nRyunosuke:\nRyunosuke:\nThe fact that the steamship hadn't yet reached Britain... ...substantiates the defence's assertion that the victim was investigating the SS Grouse on the day in question!\nKazuma:\nThen show your evidence for that assertion!\nRyunosuke:\n...Very well.\nKazuma:\n...!\nStronghart:\nIn that case, Counsel for the Defence, present your evidence to the court now. Evidence that substantiates your claim that the victim was investigating the SS Grouse on 31st October.\nStronghart:\nWhat's this? A passport for travel issued to the victim?\nKazuma:\n.........\nStronghart:\nDated 31st October? ...What are you suggesting?\nRyunosuke:\nI'm suggesting that just one day before the inspector's body was discovered... ...there's a distinct possibility he wasn't even in the country!\nKazuma:\n...!\nStronghart:\nOrder! Order! This document is for passage to France. It does appear to have been officially authorised.\nRyunosuke:\nThe day before the SS Grouse arrived at Dover... ...it docked on the northern coast of France for a night.\nSusato:\nAccording to my father, who was on board...at the Port of Dunkirk.\nStronghart:\nDunkirk, France... What could possibly have taken the victim there?\nKazuma:\n......... Ha ha ha ha ha hah! I'm impressed, Ryunosuke Naruhodo! I certainly didn't expect you to get your hands on that passport.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat? You mean...you knew about this?!\nKazuma:\n......... The prosecution's strategy for this trial has been laid down by the Crown prosecution office: 'On the day before the incident, the victim was investigating contraband dealings at a London club.' That's the outcome of Scotland Yard's investigations and the line the prosecution has been asked to follow. ...But personally, I don't agree. I think the Prosecutor's Office is trying to hide something.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?!\nKazuma:\nAnd now that you've expertly disproven their assertion... I intend to reveal what I believe that something to be.\nStronghart:\n...What are you playing at, Prosecutor Asogi?\nKazuma:\nA courtroom is a forum for the truth, My Lord. Which is why it's my duty to present all the facts, without exception.\nStronghart:\nLet me guess... This was your intention from the outset, wasn't it?\nKazuma:\nThe reason Inspector Gregson secretly made his way to the steamship docked in France on the day in question... ...was to carry out a mission...for the Reaper!\nRyunosuke:\nThe, the Reaper?!\nStronghart:\nOrder! Order! What on earth are you saying, Counsel?\nKazuma:\nThe prosecution made an assertion in court yesterday:\nKazuma:\nInspector Gregson was investigating the identity of the Reaper. When he discovered the location of the man's secret hideout...he was killed. As I'm sure everyone can imagine...by the Reaper's hand!\nKazuma:\nBut in reality...the truth is the opposite of that.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nKazuma:\nInspector Gregson wasn't investigating the Reaper at all. He was in fact...acting FOR the Reaper!\nRyunosuke:\nSo...you're saying the mission he was undertaking was...\nKazuma:\nObviously...an assassination.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nKazuma:\nBarok van Zieks never carried out any of the actual killings. Whenever the Reaper's victims lost their lives, he always had a cast-iron alibi. Which tells us...that he must have had an accomplice.\nStronghart:\nAnd you claim...that was Inspector Gregson?\n???:\nGina:\nW...Wot the 'ell d'ya think yer sayin', eh? My boss would never o' done nuffin' like that!\nKazuma:\nAnd yet...when you consider all the facts, it all makes perfect sense.\nGina:\nNo! It, it can't be...\nSusato:\nWe also arrived at the same conclusion, didn't we? That Inspector Gregson was operating as the Reaper.\nRyunosuke:\nEven so...there's no way that the person giving him his orders... ...was Lord van Zieks! (No, the true Reaper is somebody else...) Barok van Zieks is not the Reaper!\nKazuma:\nA predictable response...from someone who's advocating for the man.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd even if it's true that Gregson was operating as an agent of the Reaper... ...the suggestion that he went aboard the SS Grouse on an assassination mission doesn't follow at all.\nStronghart:\nOh? You have some solid reason for doubting the assertion, do you, Counsel?\nRyunosuke:\nAbsolutely. It's very simple. On the day in question... ...nobody was killed aboard that steamship.\nStronghart:\nHm...\nRyunosuke:\n(Professor Mikotoba and Judge Jigoku were on that very ship. If someone had been assassinated, I'm certain we would have heard about it!)\nKazuma:\n...Pfft!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat's so funny?\nKazuma:\nYou're right, of course. No suspicious deaths were reported on board the ship. But I think perhaps you've missed the point. That's precisely why Inspector Gregson himself lost his life!\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?!\nKazuma:\nGregson did board the SS Grouse that night, with the intention of dispatching his mark. But his mission...ended in failure.\nRyunosuke:\nFailure...?\nKazuma:\nIt seems that the defence hasn't yet grasped a very important detail here.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat are you talking about? (What detail?)\nKazuma:\nInspector Gina Lestrade!\nGina:\nEh?! Wot?\nKazuma:\nThe victim's notebook that you read an excerpt from earlier... That doesn't contain details of secret investigations at all. It describes ten years of assassination plots to be carried out by the Reaper of the Bailey.\nGina:\nYer lyin'! Even if all them bludgers wot got taken out 'ad it comin'... ...the boss weren't the Reaper!\nSusato:\nPoor Gina...\nKazuma:\nThere's no question that Tobias Gregson was heavily involved in the Reaper's activities. You may just be an apprentice, but if you've spent any time at Scotland Yard, you must have heard rumours...\nGina:\nI ain't 'eard nuffin'! An' I don't believe a word of it!\nKazuma:\nThen testify again. As a representative of Scotland Yard. Consider it...your chance to defend your 'boss'.\nGina:\nI, I don't...\nStronghart:\nI concur. The witness will give a new formal testimony. Miss Lestrade, you will tell the court everything you know about Inspector Gregson's secret notebook!\nGina:\n.........\nWitness Testimony\n- The Reaper's Notebook -\nGina:\nYeah, this notebook does 'ave a load o' stuff about wot the Reaper got up to these past ten years.\nNames o' victims, dates an' places an' stuff... An' the last entry in there was 31st October.\nIt said 'Grouse' for the place on that date, and then the name o' the mark.\nThere was a note about 'im bein' a criminal wot got away from the Reaper in court ten years ago or summat.\nBut honest! The boss didn't do none of it! 'E was... 'E was just investigatin' the Reaper, that's all!\nStronghart:\nKeep personal opinion out of your testimony, witness. We require only established fact here.\nGina:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n(This must be so hard for her.)\nKazuma:\nYou can't deny it now, surely...Ryunosuke Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat can't I deny?\nKazuma:\nThe notebook contained the name of the final mark and the location where the assassination would take place. That's information that the victim could only have known if he was working with the Reaper!\nRyunosuke:\nAh!\nStronghart:\nSo...who was to be this 'final mark'?\nKazuma:\nGo ahead, Inspector Lestrade! Read the name for the court. The name that's written alongside the entry that mentions 'The Grouse' on 31st October.\nGina:\nEh? Oh, um... 'Ow d'you read this then...?\nRyunosuke:\n(Reading's still not her strong suit...)\nGina:\nThat ain't the problem, alright, 'Oddo! It's a funny name. It ain't English. It's 'ard to read.\nRyunosuke:\nSo it's someone from overseas?\nGina:\nLet me 'ave a bash at it. 'Seh...ish...iro...' is it? Yeah, 'Seishiro... ...Jig...ok...you...' maybe?\nRyunosuke:\nWha...? (It, it can't be...) Seishiro Jigoku?\nSusato:\nBut that's...Judge Jigoku!\nStronghart:\nSeishiro Jigoku... Certainly not an English name, you're right.\nRyunosuke:\nRyunosuke:\nBut that can't be right! I know Judge Jigoku! And I saw him the day before yesterday! Here in London! So I know for a fact that the man hasn't been assassinated!\nKazuma:\nAs I said...the Reaper failed.\nRyunosuke:\nOh...\nKazuma:\nGregson missed his chance to kill his mark and returned to British shores. But the Reaper wouldn't tolerate the mistake. So he killed the inspector...personally.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nKazuma:\nThe Reaper of course being the accused...Barok van Zieks!\nStronghart:\nIt's...an undeniably logical argument.\nRyunosuke:\n(Kazuma... You planned for the trial to go this way all along, didn't you?)\n???:\nVan Zieks:\n...Pray forgive the discourtesy of filling my hallowed chalice whilst I stand accused of murder.\nRyunosuke:\nL-Lord van Zieks!\nKazuma:\nThe accused has no right to speak uninvited in court. You will return to the dock.\nVan Zieks:\nI say nothing of whether or not I'm the Reaper. That's the task of this court to decide. But there is one thing I can say unequivocally: That girl is no detective.\nGina:\nEh? Wha...? Nah, that's right, I ain't. I'm an inspector!\nVan Zieks:\nRepeating rumours heard around the Yard... Reading entries from a notebook of unconfirmed origin... That's not testimony. It's practically a script. No doubt the rest of this trial will go exactly as you've clearly planned.\nKazuma:\n.........\nVan Zieks:\nYour hatred of me is understandable. In your mind, I'm sure I am the Reaper...who sent your father to the gallows all those years ago.\nKazuma:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nBut you're in danger of becoming a far more sinister Reaper yourself... ...by attempting to have me condemned with this feeble excuse for testimony.\nKazuma:\nWhat did you say?\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo, this is our chance!\nRyunosuke:\nMy Lord! The defence requests that the defendant be allowed to speak! He may be privy to important information relating to the testimony just given by the witness!\nStronghart:\n......... Very well. I'll make an exception and grant the request. The defendant may remain in the witness stand for the cross-examination.\nVan Zieks:\nThen allow me to toast the court's impartiality.\nStronghart:\n...Don't raise your glass in my direction, sir. Counsel for the Defence, begin the cross-examination immediately!\nRyunosuke:\nAt once, My Lord!\nCross-Examination\n- The Reaper's Notebook -\nGina:\nYeah, this notebook does 'ave a load o' stuff about wot the Reaper got up to these past ten years.\nGina:\nNames o' victims, dates an' places an' stuff... An' the last entry in there was 31st October.\nGina:\nIt said 'Grouse' for the place on that date, and then the name o' the mark.\nGina:\nThere was a note about 'im bein' a criminal wot got away from the Reaper in court ten years ago or summat.\nGina:\nBut honest! The boss didn't do none of it! 'E was... 'E was just investigatin' the Reaper, that's all!\nGina:\nCome on, 'Oddo! 'Elp! You've gotta find a flaw somewhere!\nRyunosuke:\n(So that's what we have to work with...)\nSusato:\nIt may help us that Lord van Zieks is in the stand, too.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, perhaps. I'm sure Gina knows nothing she hasn't already told us. There's no point trying to get more out of her.\nSusato:\n...Did you notice how Kazuma-sama reacted to Lord van Zieks's words?\nRyunosuke:\nWhen he called him an even more sinister Reaper, you mean? Well, I'm sure Kazuma intends to eliminate any shred of doubt that the man is guilty. He's looking for revenge against the person he considers to be his father's killer, after all.\nSusato:\nI do worry that if we fail to find a discrepancy in this testimony somewhere... ...the trial may end and adjudication won't go in our favour. Let's listen carefully again to what everybody is saying...\nRyunosuke:\nBy you...Kazuma Asogi.\nKazuma:\nMe?\nStronghart:\nIs this some attempt at filibustering, Counsel? Prosecutor Asogi has given no testimony.\nKazuma:\nWhat are you suggesting I said that was inconsistent?\nRyunosuke:\nYou let something slip that you shouldn't have. When I present the relevant piece of evidence, I imagine you'll realise what you've done.\nStronghart:\nVery well then, Counsel, go ahead. What evidence reveals this alleged inconsistency in something Prosecutor Asogi has said?\nRyunosuke:\nThis...is a trunk that belonged to Inspector Gregson.\nStronghart:\nA metal construction, is it? It's certainly very heavy. ...! What's this? A bloodstain? And a relatively fresh one, too.\nKazuma:\n...!\nGina:\nWot?! You, you mean that ain't grease from all the boss's fish an' chips?!\nVan Zieks:\nFresh blood on the inspector's trunk... That suggests that the victim was travelling with that luggage when he was killed.\nStronghart:\nThat can't be. There was no mention of any trunk in Scotland Yard's report.\nRyunosuke:\nYes, there's a reason for that. Immediately after the inspector's body was discovered, one of the street pedlars made off with the trunk... ...hoping to sell it.\nGina:\nBut I found it! Me, wiv me nose for trouble!\nStronghart:\nHmph...\nRyunosuke:\nWhich means that nobody should have known anything about the trunk. Unless of course...we're talking about somebody who was present when the victim was killed.\nKazuma:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nAnd yet...during the cross-examination of the witness just now, you said this, Kazuma:\nKazuma:\nBecause at the time he was making his way to the steamship docked on the northern coast of France. As shown by the passport found in the victim's metal trunk.\nRyunosuke:\nSo the question is...how did you know about the inspector's trunk?\nKazuma:\n......... We know the man went on a trip to France. Where else would he have put his passport?\nRyunosuke:\nRyunosuke:\nBut you knew it was a metal trunk! Answer me honestly, Kazuma! On 31st October...where exactly were you?!\nKazuma:\n......... At the Port of Dunkirk, on board the SS Grouse... Is that the answer you're looking for, Ryunosuke?\nRyunosuke:\nKazuma! What did you...?! (I hadn't considered the possibility before, but... ...if Kazuma was there on the ship, then...it can only have been for one purpose...)\nSusato:\nOh no, Mr Naruhodo! Surely...surely you don't think...?\nKazuma:\nHa ha ha ha hah! Come on, Ryunosuke, you know the rules. The only thing that really talks in the courtroom is hard evidence.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nKazuma:\nAs I understand it, Inspector Gregson always took that case with him when he travelled. So as it stands...you've proved nothing.\nRyunosuke:\nKazuma... ...are you challenging me to prove it, beyond all reasonable doubt? That you were there that day...in the same place as the inspector!\nVan Zieks:\nHe, he was there? With Gregson?\nRyunosuke:\nThere's a clue that you've overlooked! A secret that trunk can tell us. (I can't be sure at this point. I'll need to verify it. But I have a nasty feeling...that I'm going to be right.)\nStronghart:\nThe accusation being made is deeply disturbing. But nevertheless...we must test it. The defence will identify for the court where in the trunk this alleged clue is to be found. Where is the evidence that ties Prosecutor Asogi to Inspector Gregson?\nRyunosuke:\nThere's a small piece of metal lodged in the wall of the trunk here. Like the tip of a blade.\nGina:\nEh? A blade?\nRyunosuke:\nKazuma, slung around your waist as ever today... ...is the esteemed blade Karuma!\nKazuma:\nOf course it is.\nRyunosuke:\nWon't you draw it? Here in this courtroom...for all to see.\nKazuma:\n.........\nVan Zieks:\nExercise caution, my learned friend. That man is the son of London's most notorious killer.\nStronghart:\nBailiff! Watch Prosecutor Asogi like a hawk!\nKazuma:\n...That won't be necessary.\nSusato:\nOh no!\nRyunosuke:\nThe tip...is broken...\nVan Zieks:\n...!\nRyunosuke:\nIf the fragment of metal from the trunk fits together with the end of the sword... ...the question of who was there with Inspector Gregson will be answered. Agreed...Kazuma Asogi?!\nKazuma:\nExpertly done, Ryunosuke! That's a point to you, and well deserved.\nStronghart:\nDo you mean to tell the court, Prosecutor Asogi...?\nKazuma:\nYes, on 31st October, I accompanied Inspector Gregson to Dunkirk... ...in order to carry out a mission.\nRyunosuke:\nSo the 'additional person' authorised to travel...\nKazuma:\n...Was me.\nStronghart:\nAnd the mission was...?\nKazuma:\n...The assassination of the mark.\nRyunosuke:\nWha... WHAAAAAAT?! You mean...you're the killer whose name was omitted from this notebook?! You were following the Reaper's orders...to dispatch Judge Jigoku...?\nKazuma:\n......... Let me make one thing perfectly clear: I have killed no one.\nStronghart:\nExplain.\nKazuma:\nI accepted the assassination mission, yes. And I accompanied Gregson to Dunkirk. But I never had any intention of carrying out the plan.\nRyunosuke:\nYou were never going to do it...?\nSusato:\n...We can believe Kazuma-sama, I'm sure. After all, Judge Jigoku arrived safely in London the following day.\nStronghart:\nHmmm...\nKazuma:\nOn the 31st, I boarded a train from London with Inspector Gregson. We travelled to Dover, from where we crossed the Channel to Dunkirk. Then we boarded the SS Grouse and made for the cabin deck - as indicated in the plan.\nSusato:\nYou went to Judge Jigoku's cabin?\nKazuma:\nExactly. He wasn't there, though. We decided to wait, but...\nRyunosuke:\nBut you've already told us you had no intention of going through with it anyway.\nKazuma:\nI didn't come to Great Britain to take anyone's life. So I left Gregson and disembarked the ship. I spent that night at a boarding house in the town, and returned to England the following morning.\nRyunosuke:\nA boarding house...in Dunkirk?\nKazuma:\nMy signature will be in the register book. It would be simple enough to verify.\nStronghart:\nThen what became of Jigoku?\nKazuma:\nGregson was no assassin. So the mark was spared. I'm sure it's easy enough to imagine what happened after that. Gregson returned to England as well, having failed to complete the mission. He met with the Reaper in that room on Fresno Street to report the failure... ...causing the infuriated mastermind to pull the trigger... ...and end his wretched agent's life. That's the real truth behind Inspector Gregson's murder!\nVan Zieks:\nVan Zieks:\nBut if you did nothing as you claim... ...how did the tip of your sword come to be lodged in the inspector's trunk?\nKazuma:\n......... I don't need to answer that.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nKazuma:\nThe victim was killed by a gunshot. A small fragment of a Japanese blade isn't relevant to the case. And accordingly...I choose to exercise my right to silence on that matter.\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nStronghart:\nBe that as it may, the court will sequester the sword as evidence.\nKazuma:\n......... As you wish, My Lord.\nThe great sword 'Karuma' has been entered into the Court Record.\nStronghart:\nWe must take immediate action now... ...to verify whether Seishiro Jigoku remains unharmed.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! R-Remains unharmed?\nKazuma:\nI agree. That should be our first priority. It's recently come to my attention that he hasn't been seen since yesterday.\nRyunosuke:\n...! H-How did you...?\nKazuma:\nWhen a foreign dignitary invited to Great Britain goes missing for twenty-four hours... ...it's only natural that the question of his safety should arise.\nRyunosuke:\nYou don't mean to say... ...that you think Judge Jigoku may have been killed?!\nKazuma:\nThe Reaper has more than one assassin at his disposal. And he has the power and influence to give orders from the inside of a prison cell. Isn't that right...Lord van Zieks?\nVan Zieks:\n...If I were truly the Reaper, I'd be able to tell you.\nStronghart:\nOrder! Order in court! Order! We will take an emergency recess for thirty minutes.\nRyunosuke:\nNow?\nStronghart:\nGuests of the symposium have been told to maintain regular contact with the organiser's office. If the man can't be located within half an hour... ...we will have to assume the worst.\nSusato:\nOh no! Not Judge Jigoku!\nKazuma:\nNo one would want to kill a harmless Japanese man who'd only just arrived in the country. Except, that is... ...for the Reaper, wanting to finish off a mark that slipped through the net ten years ago.\nStronghart:\nI would have to agree. Mr Naruhodo, for the defence's sake...\nRyunosuke:\nM-My Lord?\nStronghart:\n...I sincerely hope we are successful. If we're unable to confirm Mr Jigoku's healthy existence in the next thirty minutes, you will face grave difficulties.\nRyunosuke:\nAh!\nStronghart:\nCourt is adjourned for thirty minutes!\nSusato:\nKazuma-sama, the Reaper's assassin... I feel as though I'm in a nightmare.\nRyunosuke:\nI can hardly believe it either. But on the other hand... ...Kazuma isn't in the habit of making up stories.\nSusato:\n......... I have such a terrible sense of foreboding. If something awful has happened to Judge Jigoku... ...then I feel as though things will only spiral further and further out of control.\nRyunosuke:\n(I felt it from the moment I stepped into the courthouse this morning. That strange sensation that we were careering towards a foregone conclusion...) Well, in the worst case, we might only have thirty minutes left. Unfortunately though, I don't think there's anything we can do but wait now. We're out of options.\nSusato:\n......... Actually, there may be one last hand we can play. Or rather...one last ear.\nRyunosuke:\nOf course! The little Mr Sholmes doll that Iris gave us!\nIris:\nIf for some reason you completely run out of options in the trial today... ...then just pull this little Hurley's ears as hard as you possibly can!\nRyunosuke:\n(Perhaps now is the time. What should I do? Pull Hareley's ears or not...)\nRyunosuke:\nHere goes then. I'm going to do it!\nSusato:\nGood luck, Mr Naruhodo!\nRyunosuke:\nNo looking back... HEEEAVE!!!\n???:\nOOOOOOOOOOOOW!\nSusato:\nThat scream...sounded like Mr Sholmes!\nRyunosuke:\nM-Mr Sholmes?! ...Where are you?\nSholmes:\nHere, my dear fellow! Here!\nRyunosuke:\nIt's...it's the felt doll talking!\nSusato:\nPull the ears again, Mr Naruhodo! As hard as you can!\nRyunosuke:\nAlright then. I'll put all my strength into it. HEEEEEEAVE!\nSholmes:\nOOOOOOOOOOOOW! Please, my dear fellows! You don't need to pull my ear off!\nSusato:\nMr Sholmes! Where, where are you?\nSholmes:\nMyself and my trusty partner... ...are presently in the first-class cabin area of the SS Grouse.\nRyunosuke:\nThe, the SS Grouse?\nSholmes:\nShe left Dover last night, after the final pieces of cargo were loaded. We are currently docked at Dunkirk, but due to be underway again in half an hour.\nRyunosuke:\nYou've...taken a ship to France?!\nSholmes:\nPlease, even with my athletic prowess, I would struggle to jump the Straits of Dover. After we left Baker Street last night, we hurried by cab to the station and by train to the port... ...in order to board this vessel in time.\nRyunosuke:\nSo...you mean...you'd already worked it out? That the steamship was where everything really took place!\nSholmes:\nMr Naruhodo...pray, what is my name?\nRyunosuke:\nHerlock Sholmes...world-famous great detective!\nSholmes:\nRecited to perfection. Well done.\nSusato:\nYou're a genius, Mr Sholmes! That's the only word for it!\nSholmes:\nOw ow ow ow ow! M-Miss Susato! Gently with this genius's ear, please!\nSusato:\nOh my! I'm ever so sorry!\n???:\nIf I may, Sholmes...?\nSholmes:\nAh, there you are, Mikotoba.\nMikotoba:\nYou may remember that it was in fact I who made the connection to the SS Grouse. At Scotland Yard yesterday, when we examined that notebook and I recalled my steamship ticket.\nSholmes:\nAh ha ha ha ha hah! But of course it was, my dear fellow! And not once did I controvert that fact. I merely had our court-bound companions utter my name.\nMikotoba:\n......... Yes, you did, didn't you?\nRyunosuke:\nWe've just entered a recess. The trial resumes in thirty minutes from now.\nSusato:\nAnd if we're unable to present any new leads then, I'm afraid to say...\nSholmes:\nDo not fret, please. It's for precisely that purpose that my partner and I have made this journey. I have no doubt we shall have welcome news for you within the half hour.\nRyunosuke:\nThank you, Mr Sholmes! That would be wonderful.\nSholmes:\nUntil later, then.\nRyunosuke:\nYes! You'll be hearing from us if you're not in touch first.\nSholmes:\nOw ow ow ow ow! I shan't be hearing anything if you keep tugging my ear in that mindless fashion!\nMikotoba:\nWhatever was the idea behind making a receiver operated [sic] in that way in the first place, Sholmes?\nSholmes:\nWhy the deuce would I know?! It's Iris's invention, not mine.\nMikotoba:\nWhilst I know how much you enjoy being the hero of the hour, Sholmes... ...we have but half that now before the Grouse puts to sea again. If we don't conclude our investigations rapidly, we shall find ourselves in Naples before long.\nSholmes:\nHm...there are times, Mikotoba, when you make a surprising amount of sense. So, let us begin!\nMikotoba:\n'First-Class Cabin No. 2'... Yes, this is the one. But I don't believe an investigation of the cabin is going to be plain sailing. (That crewman standing in front of the door is an angry-looking fellow.)\n???:\nWhy are you loitering here? Who are you?\nSholmes:\nMy dear fellow, do you not recognise a world-famous great detective when you see one? The question really ought to be, who are you?\n???:\nDo you not recognise world-travelling great sailor Tchikin Strogenov when you see?\nTchikin:\nGreat detective? Hah! I don't think so.\nSholmes:\n......... Do you see that, Mikotoba? It would appear that this man is a devoted follower of mine.\nMikotoba:\nGoodness me! Is, is that a tattoo? That says 'Sholmes'?!\nSholmes:\n...I must say, whilst such adoration is flattering, naturally, it does leave me a little cold.\nTchikin:\nWhat are you talking about? Leave! Now!\nSholmes:\nHow distressing. My loyal devotee knows me only by name and not by appearance. And yet I already know a great deal about you, sir. You have a brother, I believe. Like yourself, he's a shipman. Currently travelling the world aboard a Russian steamship, in fact.\nTchikin:\nH-How could you know this?!\nSholmes:\nElementary, my dear Mikotoba.\nMikotoba:\n...I'm sure it was. Three days ago, I was bound for London aboard this ship, you see. We're looking for one of my fellow passengers. A man by the name of Jigoku.\nTchikin:\nThere is no one with this name on board.\nMikotoba:\nBut we know that he purchased a ticket for passage.\nTchikin:\n......... Ah, you mean Eastern man. He left ship two hours ago. Here at Dunkirk. He said something about emergency, I think.\nMikotoba:\nWhat?! Are, are you sure? (So Seishiro's realised that we're after him, has he?)\nSholmes:\nHis cabin is the one behind you. We should like to investigate, please.\nTchikin:\nNo! I have orders not to let even mouse inside!\nSholmes:\n......... Mikotoba, be a good man and draw this sailor's attention away, would you? Make up some excuse so that he leaves the area.\nTchikin:\n......... Doesn't great detective see...? That even sailors have ears. Both left and right.\nSholmes:\n......... Curses! The plan is ruined!\nMikotoba:\n...And you have only yourself to blame, I'm afraid, Sholmes.\nTchikin:\nForget it. Cabin door is locked. Even if I am not here, you cannot get inside.\nSholmes:\n......... Mikotoba... ...I'm sure you haven't forgotten my 'special talent' have you?\nMikotoba:\n...! (Opening any lock?)\nSholmes:\n...Within a mere five seconds. So if you'd be so kind as to afford me the requisite time, old friend, in your typically accommodating manner.\nMikotoba:\nHow could I refuse such a typically unappealing request, old friend? (So I need to distract that burly sailor for five seconds, do I?)\nSholmes:\nGood man! So...the game is afoot!\nMikotoba:\n(Here goes, then. Pardon me in advance!)\nDing-aling-aling-aling-aling-aling-aling...\nTchikin:\nYou! What are you doing? If we were at sea, that would be very bad problem!\n???:\nWhat's going on down there?! Seaman Strogenov! Report at once!\nTchikin:\n...! Sorry, sir! Nothing to report! It was just stupid trick! ...No, not by me! By world-famous- No! As I told you...\nMikotoba:\nNow, Sholmes! Now!\nSholmes:\n...Done.\nMikotoba:\nNot even five seconds, eh?\nSholmes:\nWell don't stand there gawping at my brilliance, Mikotoba! In we go!\nMikotoba:\nOh! Yes...\n3rd November\nSS Grouse, First-Class Cabin No. 2\nMikotoba:\nGood gracious...\nSholmes:\nIt would appear that the occupant of this cabin did indeed disembark rather hurriedly.\nMikotoba:\nThose clothes on the floor there... They're Seishiro's, without question.\nSholmes:\nWell, it seems we are just a little too late.\nMikotoba:\nYes, by about two hours.\nSholmes:\nStill, whilst we're here, we should investigate thoroughly. There may well be two hours' worth of clues to find in here.\nMikotoba:\nBut that burly crewman may return at any moment, Sholmes.\nSholmes:\nIndeed he may. ...Which makes this all the more thrilling!\nAfter examining tray with glass, wastebasket, large briefcase, and square mark on wall:\nTchikin:\nYou! You are still here?!\nMikotoba:\nAh, Able Seaman Strogenov. Hello again.\nSholmes:\n...I was beginning to think you'd never materialise.\nTchikin:\nEh? You...you are waiting for me?\nSholmes:\nOf course! I was expecting you to burst in with a hearty Russian profanity far sooner.\nTchikin:\nI was in trouble with captain because of trick you play before!\nMikotoba:\n(Poor, innocent Tchikin...)\nTchikin:\nIt is all your fault! Ship is leaving port soon. Get off! Now!\nSholmes:\nOf course, we shall disembark presently, my dear fellow. But first... ...there is something that must be done.\nTchikin:\nWhat are you talking about?\nSholmes:\nWhy naturally... ...the debunking of your deceit and the baring of the truth!\nTchikin:\nKakoy?!\nSholmes:\nI'm afraid I see through your lies. For one thing... ...Mr Jigoku has not yet left this vessel at all.\nTchikin:\nAh!\nSholmes:\nAnd for another, my dear Seaman Strogenov... ...you know exactly where the man is even as we speak, don't you?\nTchikin:\n......... How, how can you...?\nMikotoba:\nGood gracious, Sholmes! You mean...you've worked it out? All of it?!\nSholmes:\n......... It's really been too long, hasn't it, old friend? Ten years, no less!\nMikotoba:\n...!\nSholmes:\nSo...would you care to join me for a dance...of my inimitable logic and reasoning?\nMikotoba:\n......... Nothing would please me more!\nTchikin:\nW-What is this?\nSholmes:\nWe have but minutes until the vessel puts to sea. No games now.\nTime is of the essence!\nMr Strogenov, allow me to remind you of your earlier claim: You told us that Jigoku left the ship some two hours ago.\nTchikin:\nDa! That is what I said!\nSholmes:\nSadly, that was a rather clumsy lie. You see, there is something in this room that quite clearly contradicts it.\nTchikin:\nWhat?!\nMikotoba:\nAh! (Yes, of course...)\nSholmes:\nI see you've noted it too,  Mikotoba. Then please, do take the lead... What in this cabin shows the impossibility of Jigoku having disembarked two hours ago? Let's see what the last three years have done to your observational skills then, Mikotoba!\nMikotoba:\nIt's been ten years since we last did this, Sholmes, not three.\nSholmes:\nWhy, of course it has! Quite! Now, all the clues are here in this cabin for your eyes to see. But as I always say, you must not merely look, but observe. Observe and the answers become clear. So...impress me!\nMikotoba:\nI think I can manage that!\nWhat in this cabin shows the impossibility of Jigoku having disembarked two hours ago?\nMikotoba:\nJigoku didn't disembark two hours ago at all. That was a lie, wasn't it?\nSholmes:\nOf course it was. And I had hoped you would be quicker to point out why. Otherwise...the evidence itself may melt away before our every eyes!\nMikotoba:\nPerhaps you should have cleared away that glass?\nSholmes:\nHow curious that the ice shouldn't have melted despite it being abandoned two hours ago?\nTchikin:\nAh!\nSholmes:\nIt would appear that the man was here in this very cabin until moments before our arrival... ...with this well-chilled glass in hand!\nMikotoba:\n(Get your mind off the refreshments, Sholmes.)\nSholmes:\nOne might even conclude that somebody informed him of our boarding. Wouldn't you agree, Mr Strogenov?\nTchikin:\nErrr...\nMikotoba:\nBut...why would Seishiro run from us?\nSholmes:\n......... Before we consider that question, allow me to confirm one small matter: Would I be correct in saying that these first-class cabins of the SS Grouse... ...are the same ones in which you and Mr Jigoku were accommodated on your voyage from Japan?\nMikotoba:\nAh! That's...that's right, they are. I was in the cabin next door, and Seishiro was...yes... ...fifty days in this very cabin during our voyage!\nSholmes:\nAs I suspected. For you see... ...there are traces in this cabin of a dark secret that Mr Jigoku had to hide.\nMikotoba:\nWhat traces?\nTchikin:\nI, I know nothing about this!\nSholmes:\nAh, this is news to you, is it, Mr Strogenov?\nMikotoba:\nSholmes, what exactly are you getting at?\nSholmes:\nAs I said, there are traces in this cabin of some nefarious activity. Something that appears out of place, which I'm quite sure won't have escaped your notice.\nMikotoba:\n(Something out of place in here...?)\nSholmes:\nThat's the key to this, Mikotoba. The remnants of the dark deed that took place in here are being masked by something quite incongruous! I must say, I didn't foresee ever doing this dance of deduction with you again, Mikotoba.\nMikotoba:\nNo, quite. But life is full of unexpected twists and turns, as we well know. Now then, let's see if I can't uncover the truth here...\nSholmes:\nYes, you have the floor, my dear fellow!\nThe remnants of the dark deed that took place in here are being masked by something quite incongruous!\nSholmes:\nYou must tilt your head to one side and listen carefully to the faint cries of the scene. Hear the evidence calling out for you to find it. 'Here I am,' it cries!\nMikotoba:\nWell, your methods were never conventional. But you know I've always been willing to give them a try! .........\nSholmes:\nDear God, Mikotoba, open your eyes! It was a metaphorical listening that I was suggesting!\nMikotoba:\n(Ah...)\nMikotoba:\nIt's the Rules of Passage in this frame here. They're obviously out of place. The way they're hanging crooked on the wall...as if they were put there in a hurry.\nSholmes:\nYes, as I'm sure you've already concluded... ...that frame was originally over here. The shape and size are a perfect match.\nTchikin:\nDa! You are right! When did frame move...?\nSholmes:\nHardly the most observant of crewmen, are you, Mr Strogenov? I would think your captain is quite justified in having his reservations about your reliability.\nTchikin:\nGrrrrrr!\nMikotoba:\n(Oh dear. That really seemed to touch a nerve.)\nSholmes:\nSo, Mikotoba...why don't you lift that frame off the wall?\nMikotoba:\nThat...that looks... ...like a bullet hole!\nTchikin:\nWhat?! Who has been shooting walls?\nSholmes:\nI see the projectile has been removed. Clearly the careful occupant of this room has already disposed of it. Now then, Mr Strogenov...\nTchikin:\nAgh!\nSholmes:\n...I have the distinct impression that you're attempting to shield said occupant.\nTchikin:\nI don't know what you are talking about! Why would I try to protect Eastern stranger?\nSholmes:\nAh, so we're talking about the same man, I see. Good.\nTchikin:\nUgh!\nSholmes:\nI'm sure we can get to the bottom of this in no time... aren't you? Because there's some very noteworthy evidence that explains the reason why you're lying for the man! Yes, you've been told to keep up this pretence, as clearly shown by...\nMikotoba:\nI really don't know how to approach this one, Sholmes.\nSholmes:\nAh, my dear Mikotoba, simply keep first principles in mind. Study your subject from every angle... ...and I'm quite sure that you'll see it. In fact, I'd put a wager on it!\nMikotoba:\nSo I'm to glare at the fellow from all sides? Well, I can certainly do that...\nYes, you've been told to keep up this pretence, as clearly shown by...\nMikotoba:\nSo a Russian crewman is aiding a Japanese man to evade capture by an English detective...\nSholmes:\nNationality needn't come into it. In this respect at least, all humans are the same. Ask yourself what can spur a man to do the bidding of another about whom he knows precious little. There is only one thing in the whole world with such repugnant, bottomless power!\nMikotoba:\nLet's not get carried away now, Sholmes.\nMikotoba:\nIt's almost too obvious for words.\nSholmes:\nQuite. The universal language of the world: money.\nTchikin:\nAh!\nMikotoba:\nAnd I'd wager that the Eastern fellow in question... ...is Seishiro Jigoku. Yes?\nTchikin:\nGaaagh!\nMikotoba:\nSo, I presume you realise what this means? There are clear signs that a crime has been committed in this cabin. And the way you're going, sir, you'll find yourself accused of being an accomplice.\nTchikin:\nB-But...\nSholmes:\nI believe you know, Mr Strogenov... You know where Mr Jigoku is hiding at this precise moment in time!\nTchikin:\n...!\nSholmes:\nAs always, Mikotoba, in matters of deduction, the furtive glance is your unfaltering ally.\nMikotoba:\nYes, I think you're onto something there, Sholmes. You've found the chink in this burly fellow's armour!\nSholmes:\nWe need only follow the man's gaze to know where our prey is hiding... The slightest flicker of the pupils... A minutely delayed blink... Nothing escapes my attention. Even that which is barely perceptible.\nMikotoba:\nYou could hardly call this barely perceptible, Sholmes. The man's turned his entire head. It's not exactly what you'd describe as a furtive glance, is it? It's almost too obvious...\nSholmes:\nWe shall let your tapping toes decide, my dear fellow!\nWe need only follow the man's gaze to know where our prey is hiding...\nMikotoba:\nSo...you really think he's hiding in here as we speak?\nSholmes:\nCurled up in a ball at this very moment! But as I said earlier, we've no time for games today.\nMikotoba:\nNo, I quite understand. I'll make this as quick as I can. Seaman Strogenov will be suffering neck fatigue before long, I should think.\nMikotoba:\nYou turned immediately to look at this large trunk, didn't you?\nTchikin:\nAaah!\nMikotoba:\nThe truth is, Seishiro Jigoku was unable to escape from the ship in time... ...and is, at this very moment, doing his best to stifle his breath inside this trunk!\nSholmes:\nIf he still has a breath to take. I fear he may be running dangerously low on air.\nMikotoba:\nHm?\nSholmes:\nI imagine he didn't count on us making a nuisance of ourselves for quite so long. I think it would be in everyone's best interests for us to open the trunk as quickly as possible.\nMikotoba:\nB-But how can we? Are you forgetting about the combination lock? We don't know the seven-digit code!\nSholmes:\nThe combination lock can't be opened from inside the trunk. Therefore there must have been an arrangement for somebody to open it after our departure.\nMikotoba:\nOf course...\nSholmes:\nIn short, before Jigoku hid himself inside that trunk... ...he must have told somebody the seven-digit number for the lock. As I'm sure you can confirm...Mr Strogenov!\nTchikin:\n*Gulp!* No! I know nothing about combination code!\nSholmes:\nDon't move a muscle, my good seaman!\nTchikin:\nHuh?\nSholmes:\nNow, Mikotoba...would you do the honours and open the trunk?\nMikotoba:\nH-How on earth do you expect me...?\nSholmes:\nIt's a seven-digit number, remember. Quickly now! We have little time!\n*Click!*\nMikotoba:\n(That did it! It's open!)\n???:\nYou had to meddle, didn't you...\nJigoku:\nWell, Yujin, you've found me now.\nMikotoba:\nSeishiro...\nMikotoba:\n...I was really hoping beyond hope not to find you here, you know.\nJigoku:\nBut you're not entirely unsurprised, I take it?\nMikotoba:\nNo, quite. I just wish it were some other way.\nSholmes:\n...Well? Are you ever going to introduce me?\nJigoku:\nAh, your reputation precedes you, Mr Sholmes. I've read stories of many of your exploits.\nMikotoba:\nExcuse my manners, Sholmes. This is Mr Jigoku, my old friend and travelling companion.\nSholmes:\nThe devil is in the details, Mikotoba. I believe you meant to say: your old friend and travelling companion... ...who made the cowardly decision to flee the country without a word to anyone when things turned sour.\nJigoku:\n...I see my reputation precedes me as well. What an honour.\nMikotoba:\nWell, Seishiro? Are you going to explain all this?\nJigoku:\nYou know it all by now, I imagine. What you didn't know, of course, is that three days ago... ...on the night before our arrival in Britain, an attempt was made on my life here on this very ship.\nMikotoba:\nBy the Reaper of the Bailey? Yes, I've since heard. Because you were once prosecuted by the Reaper, weren't you? Ten years ago now, mind you.\nJigoku:\nAnd I had no idea at the time what a dangerous individual he was. Anyway, when we arrived in London to find the symposium was postponed until goodness knows when... ...it became all too apparent to me that I might very well be targeted again.\nMikotoba:\nSo you decided to flee the capital, without saying a word to me about it?\nJigoku:\nI'm afraid so, yes. Of course, I realise now... ...that I really ought to have confided in you.\n???:\nIt's somewhat surprising, I must say...\nJigoku:\nWhat is?\nSholmes:\nWell, first-class cabins aboard luxury steamships are in very short supply. It's more than a little hard to believe that this one just happened to be available.\nJigoku:\nSo says the protagonist of some colourful short stories. Well, I don't care for your opinion. The cabin did just happen to be available. So I purchased a ticket and here I am.\nMikotoba:\nI've just seen for myself the obvious remnants of that incident in this cabin. So you'd already purchased your return ticket before we even docked in Dover, had you? To prevent anyone else taking this cabin and seeing the evidence. Is that it?\nJigoku:\nYujin...I have nothing to say to you.\nSholmes:\nWell, in a mere five minutes, this ship will set off on its onward voyage and not make port again until Italy. I'm afraid we must insist that you disembark with us at once.\nJigoku:\n...You have no jurisdiction over my movements.\nMikotoba:\nWe have this, Seishiro. Take it.\nJigoku:\nWhat is it?\nMikotoba:\nIt's a subpoena from the Old Bailey. You're a man of the law. You know what the ramifications of ignoring a document like this from the British courts would be.\nJigoku:\n...You came prepared then, Yujin.\nMikotoba:\nCome on, let's go.\nSholmes:\nOne moment...\nMikotoba:\nWhat is it, Sholmes?\nSholmes:\nInside Mr Jigoku's trunk... ...I found this rather fascinating trinket.\nMikotoba:\nWhat is that? Seishiro...?\nJigoku:\nI can't help you, I'm afraid. Some small component from something. But what, I have no idea.\nMikotoba:\n(By the look on his face...I think he genuinely doesn't know.)\nSholmes:\nWell, let us pocket it as a small souvenir of our brief sojourn in France.\nThe small component has been entered into the Court Record.\nMikotoba:\n(Well, young Naruhodo, I think we've done as much as we can, I'm afraid. The rest will be on the shoulders of you and your assistant!)\n3rd November, 12:10 p.m.\nThe Old Bailey Courtroom\nRyunosuke:\n(Kazuma Asogi... I know you, and I know you wouldn't lie. But still, there's no doubt... ...that you're holding something back. You know more than you're saying!)\nStronghart:\nDuring the past thirty minutes while this court was adjourned, all possible efforts were expended... ...but sadly Mr Jigoku's whereabouts could not be ascertained.\nKazuma:\nWe must accept the unfortunate conclusion that the Reaper has already done the deed.\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nKazuma:\nThere's no sense in wasting any more of the court's time. The prosecution calls for an immediate verdict.\nRyunosuke:\nRyunosuke:\nNo. The trial cannot end now.\nKazuma:\nYou're a Japanese man, Ryunosuke. You should know when to lay down your sword.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd you should know never to presume when the battle is won.\nKazuma:\nThe court has already been presented with all the evidence and heard all relevant testimony. And there can only be one conclusion: that the accused is guilty!\nRyunosuke:\nAll relevant testimony? Far from it. There's still a crucial witness from whom the court is yet to hear a single word of testimony!\nStronghart:\nIn that case, call your witness to the stand at once, Counsel.\nRyunosuke:\n...Yes, My Lord. ...Tomorrow. ...If possible.\nSusato:\nThe witness is already on his way and scheduled to arrive tomorrow.\nKazuma:\nWho on earth is this crucial witness?\nRyunosuke:\n...Seishiro Jigoku. The very man allegedly murdered by the Reaper!\nKazuma:\nJ-Judge Jigoku?! You've found him?!\nStronghart:\nBut the investigations of every policing resource in the capital suggest that Jigoku is already dead. How in the name of God did you find the man?\nRyunosuke:\nHe was located in France during the recess. At the Port of Dunkirk... ...thanks to one of Mr Herlock Sholmes's famous deductions.\nStronghart:\nHerlock Sholmes...\nRyunosuke:\nInspector Gregson almost certainly met with Mr Jigoku on the night of his death. Because along with Prosecutor Asogi, Gregson was on a mission to assassinate the man.\nKazuma:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nWhich means that Seishiro Jigoku is the sole witness... ...who can clarify exactly what happened aboard the SS Grouse on the 31st October!\nStronghart:\nWell...it would appear that it's too soon to move to adjudication at this point.\nKazuma:\n......... The prosecution concurs. The court must hear Mr Jigoku's testimony. No judgement should be passed until all testimony has been considered.\nStronghart:\n......... In that case, I hereby call the end of today's proceedings. Court will reconvene at the same hour tomorrow. ...No objections from either side?\nRyunosuke:\nNo, My Lord!\nKazuma:\nNo objections, My Lord.\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n(...We live to fight another day...by the skin of our teeth.)\nKazuma:\n.........\nTo be continued...The unexpected halt of proceedings sent a clamour around the courtroom. But outside the Bailey, where Londoners knew nothing of the secret trial within, it was a typical still night. Then, at a little past eight o'clock that evening... ...Mr Sholmes and his partner returned to Baker Street.\n3rd November, 8:07 p.m.\nSholmes's Suite\nSholmes:\nWe have returned, my dear fellows!\nRyunosuke:\nWelcome back to Britain. And thank you for your timely help.\nSholmes:\nThink nothing of it. I believe you've had an even more wearing day than Mikotoba and I, no?\nRyunosuke:\nYou could say that. We were on the brink of defeat in court earlier.\nSholmes:\nSo this prosecutor, Asogi, had you on the ropes, did he? And he's your best friend, you say?\nRyunosuke:\nWell... ...he's not really the man I knew in Japan any more. Kazuma's...changed.\nSusato:\nOh, Mr Naruhodo...\nRyunosuke:\n(I mean, it's incredible... To think that he'd even entertain the idea of acting as the Reaper's assassin...)\nSholmes:\nWell nevertheless, you must introduce me. After all... ...I've only ever met the young man as a corpse.\nRyunosuke:\n(When all this started...almost a year ago now. Mr Sholmes still hasn't told us the truth about what really happened back then. About the motivation for what he himself described as a 'great detective's lie'.)\nSholmes:\nNow then, I must say...it's really quite a journey all the way to France.\nSusato:\nWell it is another country, Mr Sholmes. So...what news of Judge Jigoku?!\nMikotoba:\nWe took him to Scotland Yard. The investigating detectives there have a lot of questions for the man.\nRyunosuke:\n(Poor Professor Mikotoba. This must be quite a shock for him.)\nSholmes:\nAh yes, I picked this up at the telegraph office on our way home.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat is it?\nSholmes:\nSurely you haven't forgotten already. I put upon you for the matter only yesterday.\nMikotoba:\nYou put upon me, Sholmes. I had to fill out your telegram to Japan and foot the bill as well.\nSusato:\nOh! You've had a reply already?\nRyunosuke:\nWhat was so urgent though, Mr Sholmes?\nSholmes:\nSuch matters can wait until later. I'm far too hungry for an involved conversation at present!\nIris:\nWell that's good news. Because supper is ready, everyone!\nSholmes:\nAh, and what a feast it is! If I were none the wiser, I'd think the trial were won already! Roast beef, kippers, stew, steak and kidney pie, Yorkshire pudding...\nIris:\nTomorrow could be a very long day, so eat up!\nSholmes:\nIn that case, I think I'll seat myself just here. This place appears to be the only one set with a helping of pheasant as well.\nIris:\nOh sorry, Hurley, not there.\nSholmes:\nHm? Why ever not? Are we in set places this evening?\nIris:\nYes! And that place is for Susie's daddy.\nMikotoba:\nFor me?!\nIris:\nThat's right! I made it especially for you, Professor Mickey!\nMikotoba:\nI see... Well that's terribly kind of you.\nIris:\n......... It's...a shame, really.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat do you mean?\nIris:\nWell...for a brief moment, I believed it. That Susie and I were half-sisters, I mean.\nSusato:\nOh!\nMikotoba:\n...!\nSholmes:\n...!\nSusato:\nIris, do...do you mean...?\nIris:\nYes, I know now. I overheard yesterday. I secretly listened in to the conversation you had after I tricked you all into thinking I'd left.\nSholmes:\nWha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!\nRyunosuke:\n(The misunderstanding arose because of that autopsy report from ten years ago. But actually... ...it turned out that neither Dr Wilson nor Professor Mikotoba are Iris's father.)\nSholmes:\nYes, about that, Iris. You know I...\nIris:\nI know. You can't tell me at the moment.\nSusato:\nOh Iris...\nIris:\n......... The pheasant is by way of an apology. I'm sorry for eavesdropping.\nMikotoba:\nOh...no no, that's quite alright.\nSholmes:\nThen why don't I get any apologetic pheasant?!\nRyunosuke:\n(So just who is Iris's father? I suppose that's not something we'll be finding out today...)\nSholmes:\nSo then, let us dine...while our largely pheasantless plates are still piping hot!\nMikotoba:\nA fine idea, Sholmes. It all looks absolutely delicious.\nIris:\nEat as much as you like! There are always seconds!\nRyunosuke:\n(This could be our last chance to ask questions before tomorrow's trial. About that telegram from Japan...and about Kazuma. I can't let this opportunity slip away!)\nRyunosuke:\nUm, Mr Sholmes...what are you doing?\nSholmes:\nSurely it's abundantly clear... ...that I wasn't brooding over Mikotoba's refusal to share his pheasant with me. Nevertheless... ...I felt the need to withdraw from the social circle for a while and look on with hungry eyes.\nRyunosuke:\nHaah...\nIris:\nSorry, Hurley, but I cooked that pheasant especially for Susie's daddy.\nSholmes:\n...Even though I've played the role of father to you for far longer...\nRyunosuke:\nUm, Mr Sholmes... ...could I discuss some things with you?\nSholmes:\nCertainly, my dear fellow! I find myself quite in the mood for a spell of conversation. No doubt you're hungry to learn more of my deep love of game!\nRyunosuke:\n...I can probably contain my curiosity on that one.\nSholmes:\n......... You needn't look at me in that fashion.\nRyunosuke:\nIn what fashion?\nSholmes:\nIt seems...that before we discuss the pheasant, we have some rather 'unpheasant' matters to discuss.\nAfter clearing all Converse options:\nIris:\nAlright, everyone! That's quite enough of all that serious talk for one day. Isn't it, Hurley? I mean, look at the time!\nSholmes:\nAh, quite right, Iris. We must conclude our preparations for tomorrow.\nRyunosuke:\n(What preparations?)\nMikotoba:\nWell, I think I shall make my way back to my hotel room now. This has certainly been a night to remember!\nIris:\nIt is a little bit sad, though.\nMikotoba:\n...?\nIris:\nI mean, I liked the idea of you being my daddy. Because then Susie would have been my big sister.\nRyunosuke:\nI'm sorry, Iris...\nSusato:\n......... I know, Iris. I was thinking quite the same thing.\nIris:\nWere you?\nSusato:\nBut if somebody like me would be worthy... ...I would be delighted to become your sister!\nIris:\nWhat? Really?!\nSusato:\nOh yes! Without question!\nIris:\nSo...you'll teach me all the ways you know to throw Runo to the floor?\nSusato:\nYes yes, of course. It would be my pleasure!\nRyunosuke:\nYou didn't have to agree quite so readily...\nIris:\nOh, but wait a minute! If Susie's going to be my big sister... ...you could be my big brother if you want, Runo!\nRyunosuke:\nHuh? I, I mean, yes, of course! If you'll have me, I'll gladly be your brother.\nSholmes:\nWell done, Iris. We must always be mindful of feelings. I've raised you so well! Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hah!\nRyunosuke:\n(Because being sensitive is your strong suit, naturally...)\nIris:\nRight, I'm going to work extra hard for tomorrow now... because it's for my big brother and sister!\nRyunosuke:\nUm... ...what is all this talk about preparing for tomorrow? Preparing what?\nIris:\nHee hee! You'll just have to wait and see!\nRyunosuke:\nOh...\nSholmes:\nGood luck in court tomorrow. I'm expecting a sterling performance!\nRyunosuke:\nI'll do my very best, of course!\nSo the overnight break in the trial's proceedings became a crucial turning point... ...exposing new truths whilst posing new conundrums. That list of four names on the telegram in Judge Jigoku's office... ...and the extraordinary assassination plot in which my best friend had somehow become involved... I felt as though I had been plunged into an even greater darkness all of a sudden. But at the same time... I felt sure I would see the light again soon. Because I was lucky enough to have... ...the most wonderful family in the world standing steadfastly behind me.\nTo be continued...",

As with the closed trial ten years ago, some astonishing facts have come to light in these proceedings. The revelation that the well known 'Reaper' is actually an organisation illegally executing its own brand of justice. And the discovery that a respected Yard inspector was at its heart until he himself perished in an assassination plot. Well...I say to all members of the judiciary here present on this occasion... ...that we will stop at nothing to uncover the whole truth behind these disturbing findings! Counsels...you will undertake this trial with the resolve to pursue the truth to the bitter end!Ryunosuke:\n(Resolve, yes... That's my intention.)Kazuma:\n.........Van Zieks:\nMy Lord, if I may enquire...Stronghart:\nThe defendant may speak.Van Zieks:\nOn what grounds is Kazuma Asogi permitted to continue in his role as prosecutor?Kazuma:\n.........Van Zieks:\nHe has admitted to colluding with the victim in a plot to assassinate an innocent man. He shouldn't be enjoying the privilege of freedom, let alone be leading the prosecution.Kazuma:\nI submitted a written petition to Lord Stronghart... ...requesting that judgement of my transgressions be delayed by one day.Van Zieks:\nYou did what?Kazuma:\nIn today's proceedings...I intend to expose everything. My whole life for the last ten years...has all been leading up to this one day!Ryunosuke:\nKazuma...Kazuma:\nWhatever the outcome of this trial... ...I give my word that I will accept whatever punishment is deemed appropriate. However severe. And I suggest you prepare yourself for the same...Reaper!Van Zieks:\n.........Ryunosuke:\n(Kazuma is bristling with hostility today. I get the distinct impression we're heading into very dangerous territory...)Susato:\nIs that really even Kazuma-sama standing before us?Stronghart:\nAs an extreme exception to normal practices, I have granted this prosecutor's request. The defence finds this acceptable...I presume?Ryunosuke:\n...Yes, My Lord!Stronghart:\nIn that case, in the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again. We resume the closed hearing...of Barok van Zieks!Ryunosuke:\nThe defence is ready, My Lord.Kazuma:\nThe prosecution is more than ready.Stronghart:\nVery well, then. This preamble has taken long enough. Prosecutor Asogi...begin!Kazuma:\n...As you wish, My Lord. The prosecution calls the first witness to the stand. Bring Seishiro Jigoku into the courtroom!Ryunosuke:\n(At last, then...we've reached the final battle. He's putting literally everything on the line now in order to get to the truth. Come on, Ryunosuke. It's time for that steely resolve. Because this is going to test it to the limit!)Kazuma:\nWitness, state your name and occupation for the court.Jigoku:\nHaah... So it was you who issued this, was it?Kazuma:\nYour subpoena? ...I did what was necessary.Jigoku:\nHah hah hah hah hah hah! Well, look what the young man has become! I didn't think I'd see the day when you'd take that tone with me, I must say.Stronghart:\nThe witness will ensure his responses are pertinent to the questions asked.Jigoku:\n......... My name is Seishiro Jigoku, a Supreme Court judge from the Empire of Japan..Kazuma:\nSixteen years ago, this man came to London as a visiting student. Six years later, he returned to Japan. As well as presiding over the Supreme Court, he is also currently Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs.Stronghart:\nI am of course fully aware of Mr Jigoku and his pre-eminent roles. I invited him personally to the International Forensic Science Symposium as a representative of his country. I hear he also played a key role in the conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Friendship and Navigation.Jigoku:\nAh, it was a great honour to be involved in the negotiations. I put my all into that treaty.Ryunosuke:\nJudge Jigoku! I must ask...Jigoku:\nWell I never... Fancy the young murdering student turning up here of all places.Ryunosuke:\nYou acquitted me yourself... And now I'm a practising defence lawyer.Jigoku:\nYes...and full of self-importance like your friend across the courtroom, I see.Ryunosuke:\nYou came here to London by invitation to the International Forensic Science Symposium. But then, without informing anyone of your plans, you took flight to France.Jigoku:\nTook flight? I'd have to object to that turn of phrase.Ryunosuke:\nThen explain yourself! What exactly were the circumstances?Jigoku:\nWell...I was somewhat expecting this. And I'm sorry to say... ...I decline to comment.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?!Jigoku:\nLeaving the country prematurely when I was an invited guest may be questionable etiquette... ...but my decision is unrelated to this case. I can't be bound to testify.Stronghart:\nUnrelated, you say?Kazuma:\n.........Jigoku:\nI appreciate that a respected police inspector has been killed, for which I offer my condolences. However, being an alien, I'd obviously never met the man. Nor do I know the first thing about him. As such, I'm in no position to testify. It's as simple as that.Susato:\nSo you would run from all this?Jigoku:\nI beg your pardon?Susato:\nThis case is more far-reaching than the murder of Inspector Gregson. It has ties to another murder. A case that was tried in Japan almost a year ago now.Kazuma:\nA year ago in Japan... The murder of Dr John H. Wilson, you mean?Ryunosuke:\nThat's right! And you, Judge Jigoku, are at the heart of both cases! The defence has evidence to prove it.Jigoku:\n.........Kazuma:\nWell, Ryunosuke... I see from the look in your eyes... ...that you're resolved to carry this through to the very end, too.Ryunosuke:\n.........Kazuma:\nLet's see your evidence, then. What proof do you have that Seishiro Jigoku is involved in this case?Present Telegram from Japan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is a telegram detailing a communication sent between Britain and Japan approximately one year ago.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nKazuma:\n......... What on earth is that?\nRyunosuke:\nThis piece of evidence...is a welcome present to the courthouse, with the compliments of the defence!\nStronghart:\nYou have a poor grasp of British court etiquette, Counsel.\nKazuma:\nThat's the extent of your resolve? You disappoint me...Ryunosuke Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\nAAAAAAGH!\nSusato:\nStand tall, Mr Naruhodo! That was a minor blow.\nRyunosuke:\nHaving your best friend tell you he's disappointed in you really stings, though... (But of course we have evidence that ties Judge Jigoku to this case. Evidence showing a few key names, even!)\nKazuma:\nGood. There's still plenty of fight in your eyes.\nLeads back to:\n\"Let's see your evidence, then.\"Ryunosuke:\nThis is a telegram detailing a communication sent between Britain and Japan approximately one year ago. The communication contained four names: K. Asogi, A. Shinn... ...T. Gregson and J. Wilson.???:Jigoku:\nYou, you little... Where did you get that?!Ryunosuke:\nIn Tokyo...from your office, Judge Jigoku.Jigoku:\nWhat?! How on earth did you...?Kazuma:\nWhat's this all about? Why is my name on that list?Ryunosuke:\nThis list of four names follows a certain pattern. T. Gregson and J. Wilson are the names of victims. K. Asogi and A. Shinn...are the names of assassins.Kazuma:\nNo...A year ago in Tokyo... ...Dr John H. Wilson's life was taken in a Western-style restaurant in the capital. The culprit was found to be a visiting student who went by the name of Jezaille Brett. But her real name...was Asa Shinn, a professional killer sent on a mission to kill from Great Britain.Susato:\nA. Shinn and her victim J. Wilson...Ryunosuke:\nAnd the murder that just took place here in London was the counterpart to that crime. An assassin sent from Japan, also a visiting student: Kazuma Asogi... ...whose victim was the British police inspector Tobias Gregson.Susato:\nK. Asogi and T. Gregson... One assassin from each country to kill a target residing in the other.Stronghart:\n......... What exactly is the defence suggesting?Ryunosuke:\nThese two cases of murder, one that took place in Britain and one in Japan... ...were masterminded by a pair of individuals from each country as a form of assassin exchange! And the telegram the defence has acquired is proof of this international 'contract' to kill!Kazuma:\nWha...WHAT?!Ryunosuke:\nThe telegram was found in your office, Judge Jigoku! In other words, the mastermind in Japan...was you!Jigoku:\n.........Kazuma:\nJudge Jigoku...? What's this all about?!Jigoku:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nAnd you, Kazuma... You lied.Kazuma:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nDuring yesterday's proceedings, you acknowledged that you'd accepted the assassination mission. But the mark wasn't Judge Jigoku at all. It was 'T. Gregson', Detective Inspector of Scotland Yard... ...as shown by the name on the killing contract!Kazuma:\n......... Very impressive, Ryunosuke. But actually, I didn't lie.Ryunosuke:\n...!Kazuma:\nThe name of the target I was ordered to kill never passed my lips yesterday. The idea that Seishiro Jigoku was the mark...came entirely from you!Ryunosuke:\nAh! (You...deliberately avoided saying his name...?)Stronghart:\nThe defence claims these four names indicate some sort of international assassin exchange? I'm sure I speak for all present when I say that the very idea seems utterly absurd. Well, Mr Jigoku? What do you have to say for yourself?Jigoku:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nHis silence only goes to prove his guilt!Susato:\nThere's another very important point that this new development brings to light. There's now a distinct possibility that the scene of Inspector Gregson's actual murder... ...was in the witness's cabin aboard the SS Grouse!Stronghart:\nHmmm...Ryunosuke:\nJudge Jigoku, you have to testify now! To refuse would put you in contempt of court!Jigoku:\n......... Hah hah hah hah hah hah! There's no need for quite such a vicious stare, young man! Very well, then. As a parting gift to you all, I'll tell you everything I know.Stronghart:\n......... It seems this Japanese gentleman has information that the court must hear. About the alleged 'assassin exchange' and the events of the night of the 31st October. Present your formal testimony now.Jigoku:\n...As you wish, My Lord.Ryunosuke:\n.........Witness Testimony\n- The Assassin Exchange -Jigoku:\nIt's true that Kazuma Asogi was assigned the assassination mission one year ago now.\nThe target was Inspector T. Gregson. That was a condition of the British study tour.\nHowever...in the end something happened that meant the young man was unable to carry out his mission.\nOn the evening in question, a member of the crew was on duty outside my cabin at all times.\nIf there'd been a shot fired, the crewman would have heard it. So clearly I can't be involved.Ryunosuke:\nSo you admit it, then? As this communication suggests... ...there really was an assassin exchange arrangement between Britain and Japan!Jigoku:\nA political endeavour at the highest levels. Not something I can discuss here.Susato:\nTo use such a worthy practice as foreign study to coerce somebody to commit murder... It's the most appalling thing I've ever heard!Jigoku:\nAppalling? Well, it's easy to judge...Susato:\nPardon?Jigoku:\nAsogi had a reason for taking his sword to that British inspector, you know.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?!Jigoku:\nWhich is why he accepted the mission in the first place. Isn't that right...Counsel?Kazuma:\n.........Susato:\nKazuma-sama...?Ryunosuke:\nJudge Jigoku, if you are the mastermind behind this operation in Japan... ...then tell the court the identity of your counterpart in Britain!Jigoku:\n......... I'm not obliged to divulge that information.Ryunosuke:\n...!Kazuma:\nAs I said yesterday, I've killed nobody. I freely admit that I accepted the mission, but on the night the plan was to be executed, I backed out. In short, this assassin exchange that the defence has identified is unrelated to the events of this case.Jigoku:\nThe crucial point is this: Your police inspector can't have perished aboard that steamship in Dunkirk. Because if he'd been shot in the cabin, it's inconceivable that a member of the crew wouldn't have heard it.Kazuma:\nThat's right. Gregson was killed after returning to London. In the room on Fresno Street. And the perpetrator of the crime was the Reaper, Barok van Zieks! The prosecution's accusation remains unchanged.Ryunosuke:\n...!Stronghart:\n...To think that a seemingly innocent foreign exchange programme was a façade for such Machiavellian dealings. Clearly it's a plot only a government minister and high-ranking judge such as the witness could hope to execute.Jigoku:\nWell, I seem to recall that it was someone on the British side who...controlled everything.Stronghart:\nBe that as it may, it is not the place of this court to pursue this villainous assassin exchange plot. We are concerned only with the tangible events pertaining to the murder of Inspector Gregson. ...Is the defence clear on that point, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\n......... Yes, My Lord. I'll keep that in mind as I cross-examine the witness.Cross-Examination\n- The Assassin Exchange -",

It was at the examination centre for applicants for the study tour that I approached him.\nKazuma:\nI'll never forget it. I remember exactly what you said. You just came out and asked me forthright if I'd consider travelling to Britain on an assassination mission.\nSusato:\nSurely not...\nKazuma:\nI thought it was a joke at first, of course. But then... ...it was made clear to me that if I didn't accept, I wouldn't be considered for the study tour.\nRyunosuke:\nSo, so you agreed to it...just for that?! I mean, I know how much you wanted to study in England, but...assassination?!\nKazuma:\n.........\nJigoku:\nThe Empire of Japan had accepted a proposal from the British Empire at the time. An agreement to send a student from each country to the other's to deepen cultural understanding and friendship. But behind the scenes, the chosen students were to be given assassination missions. I...had no choice but to accept the proposal that originated from my British counterpart.\nSusato:\nWhy? Why didn't you expose the plot there and then?!\nJigoku:\n.........\nStronghart:\nBritain acknowledges no part in these alleged misbegotten dealings. I advise you not to make spurious allegations... Foreign Minister Jigoku.\nJigoku:\nAs a witness, I am bound to tell the truth...My Lord. Anyway, I picked Asogi, and explained the details of the plan to him.Jigoku:\nThe target was Inspector T. Gregson. That was a condition of the British study tour.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWhy Kazuma? Why did you pick him as the assassin?\nJigoku:\nHe was the most capable of all the applicants. And in addition... ...I knew his desire to travel to Britain was very strong. In fact, it was almost more than a desire. It was his whole purpose in life.\nRyunosuke:\n(Yes, as his best friend, I can certainly attest to that. The way he threw himself into his studies... The way he pursued becoming qualified as a lawyer... It was all ultimately for that one single goal of being accepted on a study tour to Britain.)\nSusato:\nAnd of course, we know the reason behind that. He was determined to find out for himself the truth about his father, Genshin Asogi.\nKazuma:\nThere's nothing I wouldn't have done to get here. Be that agreeing to assume the role of an assassin... or betraying people's trust.\nJigoku:\nWell, you certainly did a fine job of betraying mine, Asogi.\nKazuma:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nBut why was Inspector Gregson the target?\nJigoku:\nI have no idea. Those were the orders from Britain. I was in no position to question them.\nKazuma:\nYou have no idea? Really? I find that hard to believe.\nJigoku:\nOh do you?\nSusato:\nJudge Jigoku was once a visiting student here in Britain himself, of course. Perhaps he has some connection with Inspector Gregson from that time...\nJigoku:\nThe defence really ought to catch up.\nRyunosuke:\nWith what?\nJigoku:\nWith the fact that the assassin exchange has absolutely nothing to do with the case under scrutiny here. Yes, I've already admitted to recruiting Asogi...Jigoku:\nHowever...in the end something happened that meant the young man was unable to carry out his mission.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nI presume you're referring to the incident that occurred during Kazuma's passage to Britain in January? The awful 'tragedy' that took place on the steamship...\nJigoku:\nWord arrived at the ministry some two weeks after the ship's departure from our shores. The visiting student had been killed, but his body had somehow gone missing in Hong Kong. The news was wired to me from a detective I'd placed on the ship to accompany the assassin.\nRyunosuke:\nObviously, Kazuma didn't actually die at all. But he did lose his memory. Including all details about his special mission.\nKazuma:\n.........\nStronghart:\nDid you not consider dispatching another assassin at that point?\nJigoku:\nThat wasn't possible. Simply because... ...that black-clad young student over there had already put himself forward as Asogi's replacement. And there was no way to stop him from reaching Britain.\nRyunosuke:\nAh!\nJigoku:\nMy hands were completely tied.\nSusato:\nSo Mr Sholmes's strategy worked perfectly.\nRyunosuke:\nHe, he predicted everything that would happen...\nKazuma:\nMonths later, my memory returned. But I'd never intended to go through with the assassination mission anyway.\nJigoku:\nSo you were playing me right from the outset, were you? Is that it?\nKazuma:\nI'd sooner be guilty of that crime than of taking someone else's life. I was prepared to do whatever I had to in order to get myself here to Britain.\nStronghart:\nThis line of questioning has gone on long enough.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nStronghart:\nAll the court should be concerned about in the testimony given by this witness... ...are details relating to his relationship with Inspector Gregson, and the victim's murder.\nJigoku:\nIn that case... ...as I've already made perfectly clear, I had no connection to the man or his death!\nStronghart:\nAnd you have some means of substantiating this plea?Jigoku:\nOn the evening in question, a member of the crew was on duty outside my cabin at all times.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nOutside your cabin in the first-class area of the SS Grouse, you mean?\nJigoku:\nYes, that's right. Not least because there was a 'murder' of a student passenger earlier in the year, I imagine... ...the liner operators have taken to posting a crewman outside every first-class cabin door.\nKazuma:\nI can confirm the presence of the crewman guard myself.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat do you mean?\nKazuma:\nBecause I accompanied Inspector Gregson to Dunkirk that night, I witnessed it with my own eyes. There was a well-built crewman standing guard directly in front of the door to the witness's cabin.\nJigoku:\nAt that particular time, of course, I'd gone to the ship's dining room for dinner.\nKazuma:\nThe inspector and I asked the crewman to allow us into the cabin while we waited for Judge Jigoku's return.\nRyunosuke:\nI suppose Inspector Gregson was there in his capacity as the Reaper... He was intending to take the witness's life.\nKazuma:\nExactly. As I've said numerous times now, I had no intention of killing anyone.\nRyunosuke:\nSo the crewman let two potential assassins into the cabin he was supposed to be guarding? Not the most convincing of sentries, really.\nKazuma:\nIn truth, those were my thoughts, too. But anyway, I stayed to talk with Inspector Gregson for a short while... ...and then I left him there and made my way off the ship alone.\nRyunosuke:\nWas the guard still at the door when you went?\nKazuma:\nYes. He glared at me as I walked past.\nJigoku:\nYou see? That proves it.Present Evacuation Drill Itinerary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Yes, as the court has heard, there was a crewman posted outside Judge Jigoku's cabin.\"Jigoku:\nIf there'd been a shot fired, the crewman would have heard it. So clearly I can't be involved.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe crewman who was standing directly outside your cabin door, you mean?\nJigoku:\nThat's right. A muscular man with a permanent grim expression on his face. He didn't once move from that spot. To be honest, I thought he was a miserable fellow. But as it happens, he's a vital witness now!\nKazuma:\nThere's no doubt that Gregson was killed by a gunshot. And it's inconceivable that a crewman standing just outside the cabin door wouldn't have heard that.\nSusato:\nBut wait! What about the ship's enormous steam engines? The noise of them could have drowned out the sound of the gun being fired!\nJigoku:\nSadly, young judicial assistant, that won't wash.\nSusato:\nOh!\nJigoku:\nYou will recall that my cabin was in the first-class area of the ship, which is also of course, the quietest. Don't imagine for a moment that it's anything like steerage where the judicial assistants go!\nSusato:\nI, I didn't mean...\nRyunosuke:\nBut a hole like that made by a bullet was found in your cabin, Judge Jigoku! That's compelling evidence that a gun was fired in there!\nKazuma:\nWhat's that? A bullet hole...?\nJigoku:\nOh yes. You're talking about what the detective uncovered in the wall yesterday, I presume. That was obviously a rotten panel eaten out by woodworm. [sic] No doubt he didn't find an actual bullet.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh... (That's the hole in this argument...)\nJigoku:\nSadly, I was unable to arrange for the crewman to be brought back to Britain with me. But obviously, if a gun had been fired in my cabin on the night in question as the defence implies... ...I would have been arrested on the spot, and would never have made it to Britain in the first place!\nStronghart:\nVery true. The witness's logic is sound. Since no gunshot was heard from the witness's cabin on the night in question... ...we must assume that the witness is telling the truth.\nJigoku:\nHeh heh heh... I'm glad you've seen sense, My Lord.Present Evacuation Drill Itinerary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Yes, as the court has heard, there was a crewman posted outside Judge Jigoku's cabin.\"Ryunosuke:\n(I know Kazuma's already admitted to taking on this incredible assassination plot, but even so... ...hearing it confirmed by somebody else is still a real shock.)Susato:\nIt's unforgivable! Using Kazuma-sama's feelings to manipulate him into agreeing to such a despicable plan...Ryunosuke:\nBut I think Kazuma manipulated Judge Jigoku, too. He completely double-crossed him.Susato:\nOh dear... It's hard not to see that as a stroke of brilliance on Kazuma-sama's part...Ryunosuke:\n(One way or another, though, Gregson ended up dead.) I really think that the murder must have happened aboard that steamship.Susato:\nSo you mean...Ryunosuke:\nJudge Jigoku must be lying.Susato:\n......... I know I shouldn't let my emotions cloud my judgement... ...but you must destroy him, Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke:\nYes, as the court has heard, there was a crewman posted outside Judge Jigoku's cabin. However, we can be sure that, contrary to the witness's claim... ...the guard wasn't there at all times.Kazuma:\nWhat?Ryunosuke:\nI have here a notice of a particular event that was scheduled to take place aboard the steamship on the 31st.Jigoku:\nWha...?! Where did you get that?!Ryunosuke:\nIt's evidence gathered by Mr Herlock Sholmes. You were acquainted yesterday, if you remember.Jigoku:\nHerlock Sholmes again...Ryunosuke:\nAccording to this itinerary... ...after leaving the Port of Dunkirk, at exactly 10 p.m., and for a period of twenty minutes... ...all crewmen of the SS Grouse were to gather on deck for an evacuation drill.Kazuma:\nAll crewmen were...away from their posts?!Ryunosuke:\nAnd during that twenty-minute interval of course... ...any gunshots emanating from your cabin would have been heard by no one!Jigoku:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nIn summary, Judge Jigoku... ...you had ample opportunity to commit the crime!Jigoku:\nArgh!Kazuma:Kazuma:\nA twenty-minute window of opportunity... That's an excellent find, Ryunosuke. But it amounts to nothing!Ryunosuke:\nWhy?Kazuma:\nBecause the witness clearly stated in his testimony that no incident occurred in his cabin. Unless you have some decisive evidence that can show his testimony to be false... ...your accusation is nothing more than conjecture!Stronghart:\nVery true. Well, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\n......... Inspector Gregson was killed in Judge Jigoku's cabin that night. I'm certain of it. Because the defence has the evidence to prove it.Stronghart:\nYou will present the evidence for the defence at once, Counsel. What proof do you have that the victim's life was taken in Jigoku's cabin on the 31st October?Present Small Component\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Judge Jigoku!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nStronghart:\nBailiff! Take this evidence and incinerate it!\nRyunosuke:\nNo no no! That evidence was presented after careful consideration, My Lord.\nKazuma:\nThen I'd suggest you take a little longer over your deliberation in future. Otherwise you may find... ...that you're the one being sent for incineration!\nRyunosuke:\nAAAAAAAAAGH! (Is it just me, or is Kazuma's tongue getting sharper by the minute?)\nSusato:\nDon't worry, Mr Naruhodo. Your mind can only get sharper, too!\nRyunosuke:\n(Mr Sholmes and Professor Mikotoba's visit to Judge Jigoku's cabin... ...yielded a minute piece of evidence that was very nearly overlooked, if my memory isn't failing me.)\nSusato:\nYou must bring it to mind, Mr Naruhodo! And in a timely fashion...before the bailiff burns everything!\nLeads back to:\n\"You will present the evidence for the defence at once, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke:\nJudge Jigoku! This was found in your cabin yesterday.Stronghart:\nWhat is that? The crown of a pocket watch?Jigoku:\nA, a pocket watch...?Ryunosuke:\nAnd if you will observe, the victim's pocket watch, which we know he treasured... ...is missing precisely that part.Stronghart:\nIt, it can't be...Ryunosuke:\nMoreover, this crown is a perfect fit on the spindle protruding from the victim's watch.Kazuma:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nNow, the fact that this was retrieved from Judge Jigoku's cabin... ...tells us that the victim's watch almost certainly broke there.Jigoku:\nGrrr.........Ryunosuke:\nIn other words, the victim was killed on the 31st during the twenty-minute evacuation drill... ...in the cabin occupied by you, Judge Jigoku!Jigoku:\n......... Well...you're razor sharp, aren't you, you young murderer...Kazuma:Kazuma:\nExpertly manoeuvred, Ryunosuke.Ryunosuke:\n...!Kazuma:\nAnd your argument sounds entirely plausible... ...at first. But rather like this pocket watch, it's full of cracks.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?!Kazuma:\nAnd I believe Judge Jigoku feels the same way.Jigoku:\nI was wrong to acquit you earlier in the year.Ryunosuke:\nSorry?Jigoku:\nIf I'd known that it would result in anyone having to listen to this drivel... ...I would have declared you guilty just to spare the world your ridiculous bombast.Ryunosuke:\n...!Stronghart:\nI think it's clear... ...that the witness will have to give further testimony.Jigoku:\nWhen you hear what actually happened in my cabin that night... ...you'll notice the pitfall into which you've stumbled.Stronghart:\nPrior to your renewed testimony, I would like to clarify one point: The fact that this part of the victim's watch was discovered in your cabin... ...means that you acknowledge he was there, I presume?Jigoku:\nYes, I do.Stronghart:\nVery well, then. You may proceed to give your formal testimony... ...about what exactly happened in your cabin aboard the ship on the evening of the 31st October.Jigoku:\n...Of course. As a man of the law, I have no intention of obstructing justice.Witness Testimony\n- The Events in the Cabin -Jigoku:\nI had a guest waiting for me when I returned to my cabin after finishing my evening meal in the dining room.\nWhen I walked through the door, a mustachioed Englishman was there, foolishly waving a gun at me.\nI soon took care of him with an ippon seoi throw, though. He couldn't wait to run away after that.\nI imagine his watch was broken when I threw him over my shoulder. It has nothing to do with his murder.\nThe inspector was clearly killed having returned to Britain. Because his body was found in London.Stronghart:\n'Ippon seoi'...?Jigoku:\nA common jujutsu martial arts technique in my country. I was careful not to use too much force, but the man obviously landed too heavily for his watch to take.Kazuma:\nSo Ryunosuke Naruhodo... ...I imagine you can see the flaw in your logic now, can't you?Ryunosuke:\nWhat?Kazuma:\nThe fact that the pocket watch was broken in the witness's cabin... ...in no way proves that the victim's murder took place there!Ryunosuke:\nAAAAAARGH!Jigoku:\nI've no doubt the inspector intended to kill me. But he didn't manage to pull the trigger.Kazuma:\nYes, because he was merely the tactician. Not the Reaper's hand of death.Stronghart:\nWell, the testimony appears to make perfect sense as far as I can tell.Jigoku:\nLet me express my deep gratitude for your understanding, My Lord.Ryunosuke:\n(But if this testimony holds... ...Judge Jigoku will be deemed to have had no involvement in the case!)Stronghart:\nWell, Counsel? I really see no reason for wasting precious court time here on a cross-examination.Ryunosuke:\nSorry, My Lord. The defence has a right to cross-examine. And I don't intend to squander that.Jigoku:\nYou're an embarrassment to your countrymen... not knowing when you're beaten.Stronghart:\nIn that case...proceed, Mr Naruhodo!Cross-Examination\n- The Events in the Cabin -",

I imagine the crewman was convinced.\nRyunosuke:\nBut the man accompanying him would have had two sword [sic] slung around his waist.\nKazuma:\nYou mean me?\nRyunosuke:\n...Who else?\nJigoku:\nYes, that's true. You would have hoped the sight of a few swords might have set off alarm bells in the guard's head.\nKazuma:\n...The point is, I left the cabin before its occupant returned and I immediately disembarked the ship.\nJigoku:\nCertainly, all I can tell you is that only the inspector was waiting for me when I arrived back at my cabin.\nStronghart:\nAnd you entered without any inkling of suspicion?\nJigoku:\nThat's right. None whatsoever.Jigoku:\nWhen I walked through the door, a mustachioed Englishman was there, foolishly waving a gun at me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nObviously you're talking about Inspector Gregson?\nJigoku:\nYes, though at the time, I didn't know the man's name. And there was no time for introductions. I value my life over manners.\nRyunosuke:\nBy which you mean...that the inspector was there to assassinate you, I suppose?\nJigoku:\nThat was certainly the impression given by the gun pointing in my direction. But I've never seen the muzzle of a revolver shake about so much in all my life! Anyone would think the man had never shot somebody before.\nRyunosuke:\nBelieve it or not, most of us haven't...\nJigoku:\nAnyway, there was no time to call for the help of the crewman at the door. So I dealt with the man myself.Jigoku:\nI soon took care of him with an ippon seoi throw, though. He couldn't wait to run away after that.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nEven though the man had a gun?! That was a very brave move, wasn't it?\nJigoku:\nHah hah hah hah hah hah! My ippon seoi is far faster than a bullet, I can assure you!\nRyunosuke:\nBut surely all that commotion caused the crewman to come in, didn't it?\nJigoku:\nHm? Yes, of course. He burst in immediately without knocking. The inspector hurled himself at the stocky fellow, and just managed to slip past him to make his escape.\nRyunosuke:\n...The outstanding guard does it again.\nJigoku:\nLuckily there aren't many situations I can't get out of using a quick ippon seoi throw!Jigoku:\nI imagine his watch was broken when I threw him over my shoulder. It has nothing to do with his murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThe crown snapped off and the glass covering the face of the watch was cracked...\nJigoku:\nPreferable to the man's head being pulled off or his spine cracking, wouldn't you say?\nKazuma:\nNot that the man was spared for long. A bullet to the chest soon saw to that. But the point is, the broken pocket watch doesn't prove that a murder took place.\nJigoku:\nAbsolutely not! All the watch proves is the power of my jujutsu throw!\nRyunosuke:\nWhatever you say, it doesn't quite ring true that no shot was fired in that cabin. Because there was an obvious bullet hole in the wall.\nJigoku:\nHah hah hah hah hah hah! What are you talking about?\nRyunosuke:\nHm?\nJigoku:\nThat's what the star of your lowbrow detective stories told you, is it? Well, I don't care for such fiction.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nJigoku:\nHaven't you worked it out yet, you little stripling? No murder took place in my cabin.Jigoku:\nThe inspector was clearly killed having returned to Britain. Because his body was found in London.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBut there's no evidence that proves the victim ever returned to London alive!\nJigoku:\n...Just take a moment to think that idea of yours through now, stripling.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nJigoku:\nIf the inspector was killed on the steamship in France... ...how on earth could he have got back to Britain?\nRyunosuke:\nUm...\nJigoku:\nWhen people die, their bodies remain at that same spot. ...It's a devil of a thing.\nRyunosuke:\nWell...then...obviously the culprit must have moved the body!\nJigoku:\nHow exactly? Carrying a corpse off a ship in your arms would raise a few eyebrows at least, don't you think?\nRyunosuke:\nWell...yes...that's true, but...\nStronghart:\nAll passenger luggage is inspected when it is unloaded from arriving vessels. And I would like to think the border police would query the corpse of an English gentleman as hand luggage.\nKazuma:\nIf the murder had taken place aboard the ship, you would imagine the body would have been disposed of at sea. There would be no sense in risking being caught by attempting to transport the body back to Britain.\nRyunosuke:\nUgh... (That's killed that idea then...)\nSusato:\nBut...perhaps not!\nRyunosuke:\nMiss Susato?\nSusato:\nWe've heard that the first-class passengers were under constant scrutiny by the crewmen posted to guard them. Which would mean that the culprit had no opportunity to dispose of the body in the sea.\nRyunosuke:\nYes...that's true! So transporting the body to Britain may have been the only viable alternative.\nJigoku:\nDear me, you really are new to this, aren't you?\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nJigoku:\nI thought I'd been perfectly clear, but it seems I'm going to have to explain it in words you can understand. I think I ought to alter my testimony...with your consent of course, My Lord.\nStronghart:\nI have no objection. State your amended testimony now.\nChanges statement from \"The inspector was clearly killed having returned to Britain. Because his body was found in London.\" to \"There's no possible way I could have transported the victim's corpse back to Britain.\"Jigoku:\nThere's no possible way I could have transported the victim's corpse back to Britain.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nHmmm...there's an idea...\nJigoku:\nThink about it, stripling. All passengers and crew disembarked at the same time and passed through the same checks at the border. The symposium guests were then driven straight to the hotel in carriages organised by the ministry.\nSusato:\nAnd we met you as soon as you arrived at the hotel.\nJigoku:\nSo you did! Well then, remind me: did I have a corpse over my shoulder at the time?\nRyunosuke:\nWha...?! No!\nJigoku:\nSo we're in agreement then. I couldn't possibly have brought the inspector's body back to Britain. Unless of course they've developed some clever device these days to instantly move things from A to B!\nRyunosuke:\n(Funny you should say that...)\nSusato:\nProfessor Harebrayne's invention didn't actually work, if you remember, Mr Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\nYes...of course.\nStronghart:\nThe defence has become unusually quiet, I notice.\nJigoku:\nYes. Because there's really nothing more to say.Present Commemorative Photograph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There's no possible way you could have moved Inspector Gregson's body, you say?\"Ryunosuke:\n(So that's his story...)Susato:\nWell, I suppose if you think about it... ...whenever you drop a teacup in the office and it breaks... ...we don't say, 'Mr Naruhodo must have been murdered there!' ...Do we?Ryunosuke:\n...Is that a veiled threat about what might happen to me if I break another one?Susato:\nAnd the fact is that Inspector Gregson's body was found in the little room on Fresno Street. If he really was killed in Judge Jigoku's cabin...Ryunosuke:\n...The body would have to have been moved somehow, obviously. (Transporting a dead body over a country border... That would be impossible for the majority of people. So there must have been some special circumstances that made it possible for the culprit, then...)Susato:\nThat could be a vital realisation, I think, Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke:\nThere's no possible way you could have moved Inspector Gregson's body, you say? I would say the opposite is true.Jigoku:\nAnd what's that supposed to mean?Ryunosuke:\nFar from being impossible for you to do... ...the transporting of Inspector Gregson's body back to Britain is something ONLY you could do!Kazuma:\nWhat are you talking about, Ryunosuke?Ryunosuke:\nAs well as being a judge, Mr Jigoku is also Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs. Which means he's exempt from having his luggage searched when he enters the country.Stronghart:\nHmmm...Ryunosuke:\nWe learnt that when we first met you upon your arrival in London.Jigoku:\n...!Mikotoba:\nWell, all those passport checks and luggage searches at the border took rather a lot of time. I must say, I'm very envious of your ministerial status. You didn't have to go through any of that, did you?Jigoku:\nAh, I knew you were jealous! Hah hah hah hah hah!Ryunosuke:\nI presume you recall this, Judge Jigoku? It's a photograph we took in the foyer of the hotel to mark the occasion. As the court will note, you have with you your large travel trunk. Large enough, in fact, to have a corpse inside!Susato:\nM-Mr Naruhodo! Surely you're not suggesting...?Ryunosuke:\nI'm afraid I am, yes. Three days ago, when we were chatting innocently with the new arrivals from Japan in the hotel... ...the body of Inspector Gregson was just metres away from us, inside Judge Jigoku's trunk!Jigoku:\n...!Stronghart:\nOrder! Order! Order in court! I'm sceptical, Counsel, that a grown man's body could fit inside even the largest travel trunk.Ryunosuke:\nIt could. Because I happen to know that the witness himself, a man of considerable size, fits inside his trunk. And verifying that would be extremely simple... wouldn't it, Judge Jigoku?!Jigoku:\n.........Susato:\nBut, but inside his trunk... How horrifying!Ryunosuke:\nAnd after we'd spoken with you at the Great Waterloo Hotel... ...you had the opportunity to visit the apparent 'scene' on Fresno Street... ...taking your trunk with you in a cab, to deposit the inspector's body!Jigoku:\nI don't have to listen to this nonsense!Ryunosuke:\nDr Gorey, the coroner who examined the body, has confirmed the possibility. She's acknowledged there are signs that steps may have been taken to disguise the true time of death. The onset of the body's decomposition could have been delayed by storing it in a refrigerator.Stronghart:\nCounsel, as I remember explaining yesterday... ...refrigerators of the requisite size are few and far between.Ryunosuke:\nYes, I'm sure they are. But one place they're certainly found is on large ocean liners.Stronghart:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nSuch ships are equipped with electrically refrigerated cold rooms to keep food fresh on their long sea voyages. And the SS Grouse is no exception. Professor Mikotoba told me about it only yesterday. ...Well, Judge Jigoku?Jigoku:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nHowever much you prolong this debate, you can't eliminate the truth. All the evidence...points to you being the killer!Jigoku:\n......... Ha ha ha ha ha ha hah... Well, this is all very heartening.Ryunosuke:\n...!Jigoku:\nI can see that it was a wise move letting Asogi and you embark on this study tour.Kazuma:\nWhat are you talking about now?Jigoku:\nLogical reasoning, of course. All court proceedings will be built on logical reasoning in the new century. And I can see that you've both laid firm foundations for that already!Susato:\nJudge Jigoku, please! Stop diverting attention from the issue at hand! The defence has made an accusation against you. How do you respond?!Jigoku:\nRespond? There's really no need for me to respond, is there?Susato:\nWhy ever not?Jigoku:\nBecause before you can even begin to answer the question of when the victim was killed... ...you must first establish one key fact: Where was the victim killed? ...It's quite logical.Ryunosuke:\nThe actual scene of the crime...Kazuma:\nThe prosecution's stance is unaltered. The killing took place on Fresno Street when the gunshot was heard... ...as the accused, Barok van Zieks, shot the victim at point-blank range!Stronghart:\nSince no tangible evidence exists to disprove the prosecution's claim at this time... ...the defence's deductions amount to little more than an elaborate fairy tale.Jigoku:\nI'm afraid that's how the logical reasoning the British are known for really works, young stripling.Ryunosuke:\n......... The victim was shot in that little room on Fresno Street and died instantly? I'm afraid it's the prosecution's claim...that's the only fairy tale here.Kazuma:\nHow can you say that?Ryunosuke:\nQuite simply... Because that claim directly contradicts a certain piece of evidence in our possession.Jigoku:\n...!Stronghart:\nVery tantalising, Counsel. I think you had better explain yourself to the court, don't you?Ryunosuke:\nThe prosecution claims that Inspector Gregson died instantly when he was shot at the scene on Fresno Street. But this evidence clearly contradicts that claim!Present Photograph of the Victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"A photograph of the victim in the very location you claim he wasn't killed?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nStronghart:\n...The Japanese really are a curious breed. To proffer an argument with such conviction, only to present such nonsensical evidence...\nKazuma:\nPerhaps my Japanese friend's inexplicable thinking is why people talk of the mystique of the East?\nRyunosuke:\nIn case you hadn't noticed, I'm not the only Japanese around here. ...Do you even have a mirror?\nStronghart:\nThe court is not interested in the mystique of anything. You will be penalised accordingly.\nRyunosuke:\n(Was the victim killed in the room on Fresno Street, or was he moved there after his death...? There's one piece of evidence we have that shows the answer to that question surprisingly clearly!)\nSusato:\nPerhaps you should try to present the correct one this time then, Mr Naruhodo!\nKazuma:\nAre you going to try again? Or can't you hold your hand steady enough to point it out?\nLeads back to:\n\"The prosecution claims that Inspector Gregson died instantly when he was shot at the scene on Fresno Street.\"Stronghart:\nA photograph of the victim in the very location you claim he wasn't killed?Ryunosuke:\nYes! But the point is the posture of the body itself.Kazuma:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nIf Inspector Gregson had been shot there in that room... ...it's out of the question that his body would have been curled up in a ball like that!???:Jigoku:\nI'm sorry to disappoint you, but your logic is flawed. He could easily have adopted that foetal position due to the pain of the shot which subsequently proved fatal.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nI'm sorry to disappoint you, Judge Jigoku, but it's your logic that is flawed.Jigoku:\nWhat?Ryunosuke:\nAccording to this autopsy report, the victim died instantly. He would have felt no pain, much less have been able to draw himself into that position.Jigoku:\nAh!Ryunosuke:\nWhich begs the question of why the victim's body is curled up in that way. Though the answer should be abundantly clear by now.Stronghart:\nYou're, you're suggesting...Ryunosuke:\nThe inspector's body took on that posture ahead of its arrival on Fresno Street... ...before it was coldly turned out on the floor...from the inside of a large travel trunk!Kazuma:\nNo!Susato:\nY-You're quite right... The shape of the body... It looks exactly as if it had been kept in a confined space!Ryunosuke:\nJudge Jigoku, present your trunk for examination! I believe it's very possible that it will contain traces of the victim's blood!Jigoku:\nAAARGH! ......... Present my trunk? I refuse!Kazuma:\nWhat?!Ryunosuke:\nOn what grounds?Jigoku:\n......... I'm the Minister of Foreign Affairs from the Empire of Japan! I shouldn't have to put up with this treatment just because of some stripling's baseless accusations!Susato:\nIn other words, Judge Jigoku... ...there is blood in your trunk!Jigoku:\nI decline to answer that. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs, I have privileges that allow me to-Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nAt this moment, you're not a government minister. You are a witness in a trial in Britain's highest court!Jigoku:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nI don't care who you are or what your status outside this courtroom might be, you will NOT withhold information! Nothing is more important than the truth!Jigoku:\nUgh... UAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!Stronghart:\nOrder! Order in court! Well, Mr Jigoku...what's it to be?Jigoku:\n.........Kazuma:\nYou can't be serious! You did it?!Jigoku:\n......... Have you no shame at all...Kazuma Asogi?Kazuma:\nWhat?Jigoku:\n......... Very well, I admit it. I did bring the inspector's body into the country. Inside my trunk...exactly as postulated by the defence.Ryunosuke:\nWha...?!Kazuma:\nYou...Stronghart:\nDear God! Outrageous!Ryunosuke:\nSo it WAS you! You admit to Inspector Gregson's mur-Jigoku:\nNo! I admit to nothing more than what I've said.Ryunosuke:\n...!Jigoku:\nOf killing the man, I certainly have no recollection.Stronghart:\nWhat on earth is that cryptic statement supposed to mean?Jigoku:\nI merely disposed of the inspector's body, which was left in my cabin. In order to avoid unwanted attention. As the judicial assistant over there pointed out, I had no chance to throw it into the ocean. So...I decided my only option was to bring it into Britain with me and dispose of it somewhere else.Ryunosuke:\nYou, you can't still deny it! If you didn't do it, then who on earth did kill the man?!Jigoku:\nAs you know, there was one other person in my cabin that night. He had the opportunity. And moreover, he'd already accepted a mission to take the inspector's life.Susato:\nOh!Jigoku:\nThat's right! Who else could it have been?! It was you...Kazuma Asogi!Kazuma:\n.........You... I never thought you'd stoop to this, Seishiro Jigoku.Jigoku:\nYou've taken the words straight out of my mouth... 'Prosecutor' Kazuma Asogi. You thought by leaving the body in my cabin you could pin the crime on me, did you?Kazuma:\n...!Stronghart:\nWell...the prosecution counsel has already admitted to visiting the witness's cabin on the night in question.Jigoku:\nYes, on an assassination mission, no less.Kazuma:\nYou, you wouldn't...Jigoku:\nSo...what do you make of that, young stripling? You've heard my testimony now. And that's all I have to say on the matter. I'll admit to nothing more!Susato:\nI, I don't believe this...Stronghart:\nCounsel for the Defence... ...what is your position now? The court awaits your response to the witness's assertion. The assertion that on the night in question, the victim's assailant was in fact Mr Kazuma Asogi.Ryunosuke:\n(This isn't the dead end it seems to be. The answer's right in front of me. It comes down to Jigoku...Or Kazuma. Both of them had the opportunity to kill Gregson, but only one of them did it. And I'm just a step away from proving who!) Very well. The defence is ready to respond to the assertion put forward by Judge Jigoku. The idea that the victim's murder could have been committed by Prosecutor Asogi is...Impossible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Judge Jigoku!\"Possible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n......... Well, it is possible, My Lord.\nKazuma:\nWha...?! How could you?!\nRyunosuke:\nDo you think I want to believe it?! But the fact is... ...I can't say with complete certainty what actually happened because I wasn't there!\nKazuma:\nYou... You disappoint me, Ryunosuke!\nSusato:\nIf I may, Mr Naruhodo... ...I think perhaps that's why we form opinions based on evidence.\nRyunosuke:\nAh! (So true... And actually, we have evidence that can settle this argument conclusively!) My Lord! The defence would like to present evidence in support of-\nStronghart:\nBefore you plough on, feigning ignorance of what just occurred, Counsel... ...you must be penalised for that short but embarrassing 'Ah!' you uttered a moment ago.\nRyunosuke:\n(Uuugh... I really thought I could just brush past it if I was quick enough...)\nSusato:\nNever mind the penalty, Mr Naruhodo! The truth is all that matters!\nLeads to:\n\"Judge Jigoku!\"Ryunosuke:\nJudge Jigoku! Let me remind you of something you said only a few minutes ago. You claimed that logical reasoning is the future of the judicial process.Jigoku:\nIt is. No question.Ryunosuke:\nWell, logical reasoning can prove something here. Namely, that it would have been impossible for Prosecutor Asogi to commit the crime.Jigoku:\nWhat?!Kazuma:\n...!Stronghart:\nThe court will only accept an argument that is supported by compelling evidence. So present what you have, Counsel. What proof is there that allegedly demonstrates the impossibility of Prosecutor Asogi's involvement?Present Evacuation Drill Itinerary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This itinerary for crew members of the SS Grouse, My Lord. This is conclusive proof!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nKazuma:\nYou're making the evidence weep here, Ryunosuke Naruhodo.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?!\nKazuma:\nEvery piece of evidence has a role to play in arriving at the truth. They're not playthings you can toss around the courtroom for entertainment!\nRyunosuke:\nAAAAAAGH!\nSusato:\nNever mind the evidence, you're about to make me weep, Mr Naruhodo!\nRyunosuke:\n(Oh no! I can't upset Susato-san...or I'll end up being upset, too! We know a member of the crew was on sentry duty outside the first-class cabins nearly all the time. So as long as the guard was there, it would have been impossible to fire a shot without it being heard. And that very much narrows down when the crime could have been committed...)\nLeads back to:\n\"The court will only accept an argument that is supported by compelling evidence.\"Ryunosuke:\nThis itinerary for crew members of the SS Grouse, My Lord. This is conclusive proof!Stronghart:\nAn itinerary? How does that prove anything?Ryunosuke:\nJudge Jigoku! The moment you acknowledged that you found the victim's body in your cabin... ...this itinerary suddenly became much more significant!Jigoku:\nWhat? ...Why?Ryunosuke:\nOn the night in question, as always, a crewman sentry was on guard outside your cabin door. As long as he was there, nobody could have fired a shot inside the cabin.Kazuma:\nAbsolutely. Because it's inconceivable that the guard wouldn't have heard it and come to investigate.Ryunosuke:\nSo that tells us that the crime must have taken place when the guard was elsewhere. And that narrows it down to the twenty minutes just after ten o'clock, as indicated on the itinerary.Stronghart:\nYes, I see no flaw in your reasoning so far.Ryunosuke:\nBut the crucial point is this: when the evacuation drill took place... ...the steamship had already put to sea from the port of Dunkirk.Jigoku:\nAh...Ryunosuke:\nNow, clearly the murder could only have been committed by somebody who was aboard the vessel at the time. But Prosecutor Asogi stated in yesterday's proceedings...Kazuma:\nI didn't come to Great Britain to take anyone's life. So I left Gregson and disembarked the ship. I spent that night at a boarding house in the town, and returned to England the following morning.Ryunosuke:\nWhich I'm sure the court will agree is conclusive proof... ...that Kazuma Asogi couldn't possibly have carried out the killing!Jigoku:\nGYAAAAAAAAAGH!!!???:Jigoku:\nNo! Absolutely not! I don't accept that at all!Ryunosuke:\nWhat do you mean?Jigoku:\nThe boy's just saying that to exonerate himself! We can't trust that he really disembarked the vessel! Obviously after he left my cabin, he hid himself somewhere nearby on the ship. Just waiting! Waiting for his chance to come back and finish the-Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nNo, that's out of the question. Isn't it, Kazuma?Kazuma:\n...As the defence rightly recalls... ...I disembarked the vessel and spent the night in a boarding house in Dunkirk. And as I said yesterday, I signed my name in the accommodation's register book. All extremely easy to verify...and undeniable proof!Jigoku:\nAgh! No! I...Ryunosuke:\nThere's no escape this time! You can forget that you're a judge or a government minister. It's time you gave the court an honest answer, as a common man.Jigoku:\nGrrrrrrrrr...Ryunosuke:\nYou killed Inspector Tobias Gregson and transported his corpse back to Britain. Then you dumped the body in the room on Fresno Street and made it look as if the murder had happened there. That's what really happened, isn't it...Seishiro Jigoku?!Jigoku:It was that damned trial ten years ago... That's when all this began. Looking back now, my fate was decided that day. I was doomed already. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!\nIt's over! My life...is over.'A British assassin to eliminate a professor in Japan. A Japanese assassin to eliminate a detective in Britain. Both assassins will use diplomatic immunity to evade conviction and return safely to their homelands.'Jigoku:\nThe assassin exchange request arrived from Britain about one year ago. ...Though it was hardly a request. It was a demand.Ryunosuke:\nAnd for that, you decided to recruit Mr Asogi. But things didn't go according to plan. Your chosen assassin never made it to Britain. And you found yourself unable to dispatch a replacement... ...because I was already on my way to Britain at that time in Kazuma's place.Jigoku:\nAnd that left me with only one option for carrying out my obligation: To eliminate the mark myself. Personally. Of course, there was but a single opportunity for me to do that.Ryunosuke:\nThe International Forensic Science Symposium, I presume?Jigoku:\nThat's right. I decided it would be safest to carry out the plan before my arrival in Britain. So I enlisted the help of my British counterpart... ...and made arrangements for a pretext that would take the inspector to Dunkirk. To lure the man in, he was given a sham mission by the Reaper.Ryunosuke:\nW-What?! (The Reaper...?)Kazuma:\nBut there's only one person who could have done that! The mastermind of the entire operation: the Reaper himself!Ryunosuke:\nAh!Susato:\nSo...that means that the assassin exchange was... It was all planned by the Reaper!Jigoku:\n......... I'm not at liberty to say anything about my British counterpart. Anyway, the inspector accepted the Reaper's mission and dutifully infiltrated my cabin on the steamship. But it was all a trap designed to lead him to France... and his own death.Susato:\nOh, how awful...Jigoku:\nIt was past nine o'clock when I returned to my cabin from the dining hall that evening. I didn't give him time to attack me. I choked him until he lost consciousness. But there was a guard just outside the door, so I left it at that for the time being. Even the slightest noise might have aroused suspicion, so I bided my time, waiting...Ryunosuke:\nFor the twenty minutes after ten o'clock...Jigoku:\nI had intended to finish him by strangulation. But moments before I had the chance... ...he suddenly came round and went for me in a reckless move.*BANG!*Jigoku:\nI'd received the British-issue gun sixteen years earlier, being a member of the judiciary as a visiting student. ...I never imagined I'd have to use it for something like that.Stronghart:\nSo the revolver belongs to you, does it?Jigoku:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nThen the victim was killed inside your cabin on the SS Grouse. Which begs the question... ...of why you arranged for his body to be discovered in the room on Fresno Street.Jigoku:\n...The young judicial assistant over there has already answered that question. There was no way I could take the body up on deck to throw it over the side. That's precisely where all the crewmen were gathered for the evacuation drill. So before the first-class cabin sentries returned, I took the corpse to the refrigeration room.Ryunosuke:\nAnd then on arriving in Dover, you concealed the body in your trunk in order to smuggle it past the border police.Jigoku:\nI knew I needed to take steps if the police were to be convinced when the body was found in London.Kazuma:\nIn that case...you must have known. You must have had intimate details of Inspector Gregson's intended schedule.Jigoku:\nYes. My British counterpart sent me everything I needed to know. The inspector was due at Fresno Street at five o'clock that afternoon. In order to meet a man by the name of Hugh Boone, from whom he would take back his police identification.Ryunosuke:\nAh!Jigoku:\nI decided that man would be the perfect person to set up as the culprit. So I took a hackney carriage over there with the body still in my trunk.Ryunosuke:\nThat must have been just after we took this photograph with you at the hotel, then...Jigoku:\nYes, I wasn't expecting a welcome committee. I was more than a little nervous. On Fresno Street, I spotted a young girl selling little firecrackers.Ryunosuke:\n(Miss Venus of course...)Jigoku:\nI conceived of the candle trick there and then. So I donned a simple disguise and approached the girl to buy enough firecrackers to replicate a gunshot.Kazuma:\nWhat sort of disguise?Jigoku:\nFor some reason, the inspector had a bright red hairpiece in his own travelling case. So I put that on. Although I suspect I drew more attention to myself in that than I would have otherwise.Susato:\nThe hairpiece we found at the scene. The inspector had it ready for the Red-Headed League investigation.Jigoku:\nI only arrived at the room at around quarter to five. So I quickly placed the body on the floor, moved the noticeboard and set up my little candle trick. I arranged it so the firecrackers would go off with a bang around fifteen minutes later.Stronghart:\nSo that Mr Boone, who was due to arrive at five, would walk straight into a trap?Jigoku:\nExcept...at the last moment, I made a careless blunder.Ryunosuke:\nWhat was that?Susato:\nI imagine...it was the bag of fish and chips.Ryunosuke:\nAh!Jigoku:\nI didn't notice that it had fallen out of his overcoat pocket when I moved the body to the refrigeration room. I put it back into his pocket the following morning, but... Well, it seems the warmth of the heated cabin had accelerated the decay of the fish. ......... Anyway, that's... That's everything. All the sordid details of what I did.Stronghart:\nI've heard enough. We've arrived at the truth about the murder of one of the country's most capable and respected police inspectors. The witness will be tried in the coming days. For a crime of such a vile nature...you can expect the most severe penalty.Jigoku:\n.........Kazuma:\n.........Susato:\nAn exchange of assassins... What a foolhardy idea...Ryunosuke:\nMr Jigoku! One last detail! Who was your counterpart in Britain? Who was the mastermind behind the assassin exchange?Jigoku:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nNothing you say now can make matters any worse for you! Just tell us!Jigoku:\nEeeeeenough! I've already told you...that I cannot say!Kazuma:\nEven though as things stand, you may very well never set foot in your homeland again?Jigoku:\n......... What are you waiting for? Can't we get this over with now?! It's finished...all of it! ...I'm finished...Stronghart:\nThen, in the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I now pronounce the findings of this court. This man before us has admitted to the wilful murder of Tobias Gregson. Seishiro Jigoku, it is the opinion of this court that you should be found...GuiltyStronghart:\nAnd may I remind all those present of the strict confidentiality demanded by this closed court!Stronghart:\nMoments ago, Mr Jigoku signed a written confession... ...admitting to the murder of Inspector Gregson, and the subsequent conveyance of the body. In short, the defendant's innocence has therefore been established beyond doubt.Kazuma:\n.........Susato:\nOh, wonderful! Well done, Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke:\nYes, um...thank you.Susato:\n...Is something wrong?Ryunosuke:\n......... I'm...just a little troubled... ...by his silence.Stronghart:\nThe true identity of the Reaper of the Bailey... And this extraordinary 'assassin exchange'... We do remain in the dark about these mysteries. However... ...insofar as the indictment brought against the defendant in this trial, we have reached a conclusion.Van Zieks:\nI have every intention of pursuing both mysteries... ...as a prosecutor.Stronghart:\n...As you wish. Now, for the formal adjudication... I hereby declare the defendant, Barok van Zieks.........Kazuma:Kazuma:\nThe prosecution calls for adjudication to be deferred.Stronghart:\nCounsel...?Kazuma:\nThe accused's innocence hasn't been fully established at all. And therefore, it would be wrong to deliver a verdict at this time. That is the prosecution's unwavering position!Ryunosuke:\nW-What?!Susato:\nBut...Judge Jigoku has already confessed!Kazuma:\nNevertheless... ...Barok van Zieks has committed crimes for which he must be punished.Stronghart:\nWell... ...it would appear you have information that the court needs to hear, Prosecutor Asogi.Kazuma:\nCertainly, the murder of Inspector Gregson was actually carried out by Seishiro Jigoku. But it's clear from the witness's testimony that he was coerced into complying with the plot. Into this sick, merciless assassin exchange!Ryunosuke:\nThat, that may be true, but...Kazuma:\nSo what I want to know is, who coerced Jigoku? Who was pulling the strings?Van Zieks:\n...!Kazuma:\nThe victim went to France having been ordered on a mission for the Reaper...only to be murdered. In other words, the mastermind behind the assassin exchange is someone in a position to give such an order. As we've already established...the Reaper himself.Stronghart:\nWell, certainly, that would appear to follow...Kazuma:\nThe prosecution hereby formally accuses the man in the dock, Barok van Zieks... ...of being the Reaper of the Bailey! And furthermore... ...I'm going to prove his guilt beyond all reasonable doubt!Ryunosuke:\nWha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!Stronghart:\nOrder! Order! Order! The Reaper of the Bailey...is a long-standing mystery, Counsel. Are you suggesting you have some new information with which to build a case?Susato:\nScotland Yard has already investigated Lord van Zieks very thoroughly in that regard. And they found no evidence whatsoever to substantiate the claim that he is the Reaper.Kazuma:\nPerhaps. But circumstances have now changed.Ryunosuke:\nWhat do you mean?Kazuma:\nIt's already been established that the assassin exchange was negotiated with Jigoku by the Reaper himself. Which means we now have a new line of questioning by which to identify definitively the man's identity. That is the prosecution's intention here.Van Zieks:\nI must say I'm surprised... ...by quite how tenaciously you appear to want to besmirch my name.Kazuma:\n......... You are guilty of an unforgivable crime, Lord van Zieks. And I will bring you to justice for it...whatever it takes!Van Zieks:\n...!Ryunosuke:\n(That explains Kazuma's silence before. He'll stop at nothing to finish what Lord van Zieks unwittingly started ten years ago...)Stronghart:\n......... Very well. Whilst it's extremely irregular... ...I will on this occasion grant the prosecution further opportunity for witness testimony. The defendant will disclose any and all involvement he has had with the Reaper and the assassin exchange!Kazuma:\nI thank you, My Lord, for guiding the court so wisely.Stronghart:\nI hereby declare this court to be in session for a supplementary hearing!Van Zieks:\n...Pray turn a blind eye to the discourtesy as I verify that this vile and unremitting accusation... ...hasn't soured the contents of my hallowed chalice.Ryunosuke:\nLord van Zieks!Van Zieks:\nI first had to suffer the pseudonym of the Reaper ten years ago now. And ever since that time, I've endured the weight of implied guilt that's gone with it. So I welcome the chance to testify now...and crush those allegations once and for all.Kazuma:\nGood. Then let justice decide...Lord van Zieks. The prosecution seeks to begin building its case by calling the accused to the stand as the primary witness... ...in order that he may answer the accusation brought by the prosecution that he IS the Reaper of the Bailey!Stronghart:\nAnd what says the defence?Susato:\nPutting the defendant in the witness stand can be extremely dangerous. And Kazuma-sama is so emotional at the moment. He's not thinking logically!Ryunosuke:\nYou're right that he's not himself. But I knew it would be like this. And I came here today determined to face him through whatever might arise. As a lawyer...and as his friend.Susato:\nThen that's what we must do!Ryunosuke:\nThe defence has no objection, My Lord!Stronghart:\nVery well. Defendant, you will take the witness stand... ...and give formal testimony on the subject of your involvement with the Reaper...and the assassin exchange!Van Zieks:\nAs you wish...My Lord.Witness Testimony\n- The Reaper and the Assassin Exchange -Van Zieks:\nI've never taken the life of another. Nor have I instructed another to kill.\nI've been investigating the truth behind the Reaper for years. And I was aware of Gregson's involvement.\nThat's the reason why I went to Fresno Street that day, and how I came to discover the body.\nThe point is, no common thread exists between myself, Gregson and Dr Wilson.\nClearly, therefore, there's no reason to suspect me of being behind the assassin exchange.Stronghart:\nSo you deny all accusations by the prosecution? Both that you are the Reaper of the Bailey, and that you masterminded the assassin exchange.Van Zieks:\nI acknowledge that the public at large believe me to be the Reaper. However, that's a fallacy, which I alone am in a position to foreswear.Kazuma:\nNaturally, the prosecution believes the testimony just given by the accused to be untrue. Ryunosuke Naruhodo...Ryunosuke:\n...Yes?Kazuma:\nLet me ask you: why are you here? What really brings you to this courtroom?Ryunosuke:\n......... A desire to uncover the truth.Kazuma:\nEven if the truth proves your client to be guilty?Ryunosuke:\n......... From all my experiences in this courtroom, I've come to realise something: The truth can't be hidden. Sooner or later, it will come out.Van Zieks:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nSo it's always my intention to work with my client in pursuit of the truth.Kazuma:\n......... I want you to remember what you just said.Stronghart:\nEnough dilatory chatter. Counsel for the Defence, proceed to cross-examine the witness.Ryunosuke:\nAh...Yes, My Lord! (I know exactly what you're thinking, Kazuma. I know you're just waiting to point it out. The contradiction you're convinced lies somewhere within this man's testimony...)Cross-Examination\n- The Reaper and the Assassin Exchange -",

Nor have I instructed another to kill.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo you're not what the general public refer to as the infamous Reaper of the Bailey?\nVan Zieks:\nExactly.\nKazuma:\nDon't imagine for a moment that the court will be satisfied with a one-word answer on this.\nVan Zieks:\nI realise that.\nRyunosuke:\n(If you're intending to comment on every sentence, this could take a while, Kazuma...) Didn't you find it...disturbing, though? That one by one, defendants who'd been acquitted after your unsuccessful prosecution were killed?\nVan Zieks:\n......... Let me answer that question by posing another: If, one by one, defendants who'd been acquitted after your successful defence were killed... ...would you find that 'disturbing'?\nRyunosuke:\nDisturbing?! I couldn't possibly say how that would make me feel with a one-word answer like that!\nVan Zieks:\nExactly.\nRyunosuke:\n(Well...that told me...)\nVan Zieks:\nBut even though I'm not the Reaper, that doesn't mean I ignored all the hearsay.Van Zieks:\nI've been investigating the truth behind the Reaper for years. And I was aware of Gregson's involvement.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nYou say 'for years'... How long exactly?\nVan Zieks:\nSince the very first time the Reaper's influence was felt in this courtroom...ten years ago now.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd your investigations led you somehow to Inspector Gregson, you're saying?\nVan Zieks:\n...I didn't want to believe it. He was a personal acquaintance. We'd worked on cases together in the past.\nRyunosuke:\n(A friend...even?)\nVan Zieks:\nIt felt like a betrayal, but...I demanded permission to search his office at the Yard without his knowledge.\nKazuma:\nWhich is when you found his secret notebook, is it?\nVan Zieks:\nIt's when I first learnt of the location he'd noted only as 'Grouse' and the appointment at 5 p.m. on the 31st. Though I didn't know the significance of those details at the time.\nRyunosuke:\n(So now we're at the nub of the matter...)\nVan Zieks:\nAs it turns out, the significance for me personally was very unfortunate.Van Zieks:\nThat's the reason why I went to Fresno Street that day, and how I came to discover the body.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBut why did you go to that specific location?\nVan Zieks:\nI thought that if it was the Reaper's headquarters... ...then by turning up there at five o'clock, I would catch whoever was involved red-handed. Sadly, all that was awaiting me... ...was the inspector's corpse.\nRyunosuke:\nYes... Even though it wasn't designed for you, you walked straight into the trap set by Jigoku.\nVan Zieks:\nExactly. Jigoku had intended to implicate Hugh Boone. But unhappily for me, I arrived at the scene first.\nKazuma:\nHah! A ridiculously careless blunder!\nRyunosuke:\n(Moved on to just throwing insults around, I see then, Kazuma...)\nVan Zieks:\nThink what you will. It doesn't change the truth.Van Zieks:\nThe point is, no common thread exists between myself, Gregson and Dr Wilson.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThere is a link between you and Gregson, though.\nVan Zieks:\nOf course. We were close acquaintances. We'd worked on numerous cases together. I considered the man to be a mentor of sorts. He taught me a number of important lessons.\nRyunosuke:\nH-He did? Such as what?\nVan Zieks:\n......... Where to buy good fish and chips...and suchlike.\nRyunosuke:\n(Well...that was convincing.)\nVan Zieks:\nDr Wilson was a coroner, of course, but that was some time in the past. And in any case, I understand it was several years ago now that he was invited to work at a Japanese university.\nRyunosuke:\nThat's right. He was a visiting professor at the Imperial Yumei University in Tokyo.\nVan Zieks:\nIt should be unambiguously clear then, that no link exists between myself and him. In other words, I had no motive for sending some assassin across the oceans to kill the man.\nRyunosuke:\n(It sounds plausible enough, and I want to believe it. But something about this just doesn't quite sit right with me...)Present Klint's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What is this? An autopsy report?\"Van Zieks:\nClearly, therefore, there's no reason to suspect me of being behind the assassin exchange.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nCertainly as it stands, there's no evidence to suggest that you concocted the scheme.\nKazuma:\n\nKazuma:\nBut as it stands, we have only the accused's insistence of his innocence.\nRyunosuke:\nSorry?!\nKazuma:\nPerhaps there is some reason that would explain why he masterminded the assassin exchange. And if a reason could be established later in these proceedings... ...then the accused's claim in this testimony that he wasn't involved would amount to perjury.\nRyunosuke:\nWell...yes...that's true, but...\nSusato:\nClearly Kazuma-sama... ...intends to identify a reason and use it to make his case.\nRyunosuke:\nSo if we don't identify something first...\nSusato:\n...He'll gain the advantage!\nRyunosuke:\n(This could be dangerous...)\nKazuma:\n.........Present Klint's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"What is this? An autopsy report?\"Ryunosuke:\n(A convincing testimony by Lord van Zieks...)Susato:\nCertainly, with no apparent connection between the three men, there's no way to establish a motive. The testimony seems unassailable as far as I can see.Ryunosuke:\n.........Susato:\nOh dear me! What a bleak expression!Ryunosuke:\nI agree, there doesn't appear to be any particular link between them...at first glance. But with the inclusion of one other person... ......... (I must be over-thinking it, surely...)Susato:\nAnother person, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke:\nI need to think back over all the information we've gleaned so far.Susato:\nAlright. And I'll review my notes about the case and all the evidence in the Court Record!Ryunosuke:\n(Could it be...that Lord van Zieks has something to hide after all...?)Stronghart:\nWhat is this? An autopsy report? Wait...this is ten years old...from the autopsy of Lord Klint van Zieks!Van Zieks:\nWhat?! My brother's autopsy report?!Kazuma:\nI'm pleased to see the defence doesn't intend to run from the undeniable truth.Ryunosuke:\n.........Stronghart:\nOrder in court! What reason do you have for presenting a ten-year-old autopsy report here, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\nThis...the autopsy report of the Professor's final victim... ...is an indelible link between Inspector Gregson, Dr Wilson...and the defendant!Van Zieks:\nNot that accursed name again! The Professor...Kazuma:\nI've personally researched all of the court records relating to that case. I know that at the time, autopsy was considered sacrilege to the victim's souls. And for a member of the aristocracy like Lord Klint van Zieks, it was unthinkable. But someone implored the powers that be to allow the autopsy to go ahead: Inspector Gregson. He declared that he was certain he would obtain conclusive proof from the procedure.Susato:\nAnd it was Dr Wilson who conducted the autopsy. His signature is clearly visible on the document!Van Zieks:\nAs promised by Gregson, the autopsy did indeed produce evidence. Evidence that conclusively proved Genshin Asogi was guilty of the murders. In my brother's dying moments, he mustered all his remaining strength to leave that vital clue behind.Kazuma:\n.........Stronghart:\nIndeed. That was the key to indicting the Professor for his crimes and the conclusive evidence that convicted him. It enabled Lord van Zieks here to avenge his brother's senseless death...with a marvellous victory in court.Van Zieks:\n.........Kazuma:\nA marvellous victory, was it? I wonder if that's really true.Van Zieks:\nWhat?Kazuma:\nCould the same be said if it turned out that the key piece of evidence in question was in fact fabricated? If the inspector, the coroner and the prosecutor all colluded together... ...to cast an innocent Japanese man as a mass murderer and send him to his death!Van Zieks:\nThat's outrageous!Kazuma:\nAnd now, ten years later, for some reason the secret has been threatened and needs protecting. Which is why the inspector and the coroner had to be silenced...isn't it? By someone in power in Japan and in Britain...using the two killers recruited for the assassin exchange!Stronghart:\nOrder! Order at once!Kazuma:\nTen years ago, my father was convicted in this very courtroom as a mass murderer...to be sentenced to death. But it was all a sham! And I swore to myself that I'd prove it. Which is why I HAD to come to Britain... whatever the cost!Van Zieks:\nYou'll have to forgive me if I feel compelled to toast this vengeful Nipponese's tenacity of purpose here. However... ...he who fails to quash his emotions in the courtroom... has failed as a lawyer.Ryunosuke:\nCome on, Kazuma! You know this won't wash! You're claiming your father was misrepresented in a trial that took place a whole decade ago! You must see that without evidence, that's nothing more than a wild accusation!Kazuma:\nAs it happens...I have evidence.Ryunosuke:\nWHAT?!Kazuma:\nAs the court has heard, I crossed the Channel to France with Gregson on the 31st. I went with him on the pretext of being the assassin recruited to kill Seishiro Jigoku. But my true intentions...were to make the inspector tell me the truth.Van Zieks:\nWhat truth?Kazuma:\nThe truth about the evidence. And he acknowledged what I'd already deduced: There's a closely guarded secret about what went on in that autopsy ten years ago.Van Zieks:\nWhat? A secret? ...I know nothing of any secret!Kazuma:\nWhile we waited for my supposed 'mark' in Jigoku's cabin... ...I drew my clan's illustrious sword, Karuma, before the inspector's eyes. He very quickly understood what my true motive was.Gregson:\nRight, I see... You're that Asogi's young lad, are you? And what? You're gonna cut me down with that thing, is that it?Kazuma:\nThat will very much depend on the answers you give to my questions. I want to know what really happened ten years ago. The truth. That's all.Gregson:\n......... Before we get into it, let me make one thing clear: I still believe your father was the Professor. There's no doubt in my mind. But unfortunately back then...we didn't have the evidence we needed to make the crime stick.Kazuma:\nSo...you admit it then? The evidence used in my father's trial was fabricated?!Gregson:\n......... It was for the good o' the country. Anyway...I was just followin' orders.Kazuma:\nOrders? What exactly did you do? ...Speak!Gregson:\nI'm not sayin' another word.Kazuma:\nEven if your life depends on it?Gregson:\nThat's right. Even then.*Shing!*Ryunosuke:\nSo that's when the tip of the sword broke...Susato:\nOh, Kazuma-sama...Kazuma:\nIf the results of Klint van Zieks's autopsy were fabricated... ...then the investigating officer, Gregson, and the lead coroner, Wilson, must have known about it. And they can only have been ordered to pervert the course of justice in that way by one man: The man leading the case for the prosecution, Barok van Zieks!Van Zieks:\n...!Stronghart:\nIn other words, the defendant DID have cause to organise this exchange of assassins!Kazuma:\nExactly. And as was established earlier... ...it has to have been the Reaper himself who liaised with Jigoku in Japan to arrange the exchange.Ryunosuke:\nAh!Kazuma:\nSo it follows that the Reaper's true identity... ...can only be that of the man who stands accused in this courtroom today, Barok van Zieks!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nKazuma Asogi...Kazuma:\n...What?Van Zieks:\nWhat you've just told the court... Are you absolutely certain of your facts? Did Gregson really fabricate evidence for that trial ten years ago?Kazuma:\nI heard it with my own ears. His shameful admission.Van Zieks:\n......... In that case...I know... ...the name of the Reaper.Kazuma:\nWha...What?Ryunosuke:\nLord van Zieks?Van Zieks:\nI gave no such orders. I know that for certain. Which narrows down the remaining possibilities...to one!Ryunosuke:\n(If Lord van Zieks isn't the one behind all this... ...then yes, there is only one other person who could have done something like that.) I believe I know who it is, too.Kazuma:\nYou...?!Ryunosuke:\n(I just had a feeling this name was going to come up...) The true identity of the infamous Reaper of the Bailey is...Present Mael Stronghart profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The only person who could have arranged the assassin exchange and manipulated the autopsy results...\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\n......... (It's really palpable now... That overwhelming pressure that's making it almost impossible to speak before this gargantuan foe... But I can't back away now. There's no time!)\nStronghart:\nWhat's the matter, Counsel? I take exception at the look you're giving me.\nRyunosuke:\nI was...just gathering my thoughts. I'm ready to voice the defence's opinion now.\nStronghart:\n......... Very well. But before you do...a penalty for time-wasting.\nRyunosuke:\nUuugh...\nKazuma:\nRyunosuke...\nStronghart:\nCounsel for the Defence, reveal your belief about the identity of the Reaper... ...if you have the courage and resolve to utter the name, that is.\nLeads back to:\n\"I just had a feeling this name was going to come up...\"Ryunosuke:\nThe only person who could have arranged the assassin exchange and manipulated the autopsy results... ...is the Lord Chief Justice himself... ...Lord Mael Stronghart!Kazuma:\nWha...?! Lord...Stronghart...?Ryunosuke:\nYes, it's true that ten years ago, the defendant handled the prosecution of the Professor in court. But he only took over the case after his brother, Lord Klint van Zieks, had been killed.Kazuma:\n...!Stronghart:\n......... I can only assume that this is the most inappropriate joke in British judicial history.Ryunosuke:\n......... Well, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks:\n...Ten years ago...I was very new to my profession. But I had a burning desire to avenge my brother's death, so I pleaded for control of the case.Kazuma:\n.........Van Zieks:\nThe investigation to that point... The supplication of the Lords to allow my brother's corpse to be examined... All the evidence I was given... The autopsy reports... It all came...from you.Stronghart:\n.........Van Zieks:\nI've spent my life since then believing I was in your debt for the way you stood aside and let me handle the trial. But I see now... ...I was very much mistaken.Ryunosuke:\nIt was a hugely influential force that caused the inspector and the coroner to break the law ten years ago. And that same force was still felt a decade later on the other side of the world...by Seishiro Jigoku. Lord Stronghart! Everything falls into place when we recognise that you... are the Reaper of the Bailey!Stronghart:\n.........Van Zieks:\nThe court awaits your response...My Lord. This may very well go down in British judicial history, but I assure you...it is no joke. Consider this a formal accusal by the defence!Stronghart:\n......... It doesn't warrant a response.Ryunosuke:\n...!Stronghart:\nA formal accusal? Don't be absurd. The defence's claims are utter nonsense. A wild fantasy at best.Ryunosuke:\n...You're not going to defend yourself?Stronghart:\nYou claim there was some wrongdoing with Lord Klint van Zieks's autopsy? That's utterly untrue.Kazuma:Kazuma:\nBut I heard it from Gregson's own lips! He admitted to it!Stronghart:\n...And where is your evidence?Kazuma:\nWhat?!Stronghart:\nGregson's dead now. Unless you were thinking of summoning a ghost to the stand?Kazuma:\nYou, you mean to say...?Stronghart:\nI forget how the system works in your little backwater country... ...but in the courts of the British Empire, without evidence, there is no case. I have no intention of entertaining some wild fantasy that can't possibly be substantiated by anyone or anything!Kazuma:\nAAAAAAAAARGH!Stronghart:\nOrder! Order in court! Following Inspector Gregson's murder and in the light of Dr Wilson's death as well... ...there's really no one left who could testify about the events of ten years ago...is there?Van Zieks:\nSo that was the real purpose of the assassin exchange...Stronghart:\nThis court has no business raking over the coals of a case that was concluded a decade ago. The accusal brought by the prosecution and the defence is categorically denied. I take it there are no objections?Kazuma:\n...!Ryunosuke:\n(Kazuma... He's more or less waited his whole life for this moment. Is there really nothing else we can do now? Is there no other avenue we can go down in pursuit of the truth about what happened all those years ago...? If only there was someone who could testify about Klint van Zieks's autopsy.)There's no one left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(He's gone to extraordinary lengths to cover his tracks. Even so far as dispatching an assassin all the way to Japan to ensure Dr Wilson's silence. And Dr Sithe won't say anything against Stronghart...) .........\nKazuma:\nRyunosuke, please!\nRyunosuke:\n(I'm sorry, Kazuma...)\nSusato:\nMr Naruhodo... ...isn't there someone rather important whom you've overlooked?\nRyunosuke:\nHm?\nStronghart:\nYour silence is beautifully eloquent. I take it we've reached the end of this debate, then. Let the matter be closed...for good!\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Actually, there is one person...\"There is someone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n(He's gone to extraordinary lengths to cover his tracks. Even so far as dispatching an assassin all the way to Japan to ensure Dr Wilson's silence. And Dr Sithe won't say anything against Stronghart... But...there's still one ray of hope!)\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Actually, there is one person...\"Ryunosuke:\nActually, there is one person... One person...who could still testify about that autopsy!Stronghart:\nDon't be ridiculous. There's no one left!Kazuma:\nWho, Ryunosuke, who? Tell me!Ryunosuke:\nKazuma, I...Kazuma:\nPlease! This trial can't end! Not yet!Ryunosuke:\n......... I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for the truth.Stronghart:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nThe person the defence would like to call to the stand to testify about the autopsy of Lord Klint van Zieks is...Present Yujin Mikotoba profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Heaven help us.\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nStronghart:\nDenied.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?! I want to know why!\nStronghart:\n......... And I want to know why you're proposing to call such a witness with that look of utter desperation on your face.\nKazuma:\nIn other words, you're wide of the mark, Ryunosuke. Very wide.\nRyunosuke:\n(Thanks. Don't spare my feelings or anything...)\nStronghart:\nGiven the contemptible allegations you're making, Counsel, I won't be letting that blunder pass unpunished.\nRyunosuke:\nUuugh...\nSusato:\nThere was somebody else present at the autopsy, Mr Naruhodo. Surely you haven't forgotten?\nRyunosuke:\nNo, I...I know. I'll get it right this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"The person the defence would like to call to the stand to testify about the autopsy of Lord Klint van Zieks is...\"Stronghart:\nHeaven help us. Another Japanese?Ryunosuke:\nAn expert in forensic medicine, My Lord. Professor Yujin Mikotoba. Sixteen years ago... ...he came to London with Seishiro Jigoku and Genshin Asogi as a visiting student.Stronghart:\nAnd what could his testimony possibly tell us?Susato:\nProfessor Mikotoba was the primary assistant during the autopsy in question. He was also the person who actually penned the report!Stronghart:\nIncorrect. The autopsy was carried out by the coroner, Dr Wilson. The report carries his signature.Susato:\nIt was the primary assistant's duty to keep a written record of the coroner's work during the procedure. In actual fact, the coroner merely read over the report at the end and signed it.Ryunosuke:\nIn other words, Professor Mikotoba witnessed the entire autopsy from start to finish. The defence demands that Professor Mikotoba be summoned as a witness as a matter of urgency! Whatever really happened in that autopsy laboratory ten years ago...is something only he can tell us!Stronghart:\nThe defence's demand is denied.Ryunosuke:\nWhat?Susato:\nBut Professor Mikotoba is in London at this very moment! We could summon him to the stand in minutes!Ryunosuke:\n(No, of course he's not going to agree to it. Stronghart has no intention of summoning anyone who knows. He's too concerned about protecting himself!)Stronghart:\nProsecutor Asogi, let me refresh your memory, as you seem to have forgotten the prosecution's stance: Only minutes ago, you accused the defendant of being the Reaper and of masterminding the assassin exchange.Kazuma:\nI, I did, yes...Stronghart:\nSo present your evidence for those claims and make your case complete!Kazuma:\nI...I... At this time, I don't have the requisite evidence. But that's exactly why we need witness testimony!Stronghart:\nThe Professor case is closed. There are no clues in the distant past that will bolster your argument today. I'm afraid to say, Prosecutor Asogi... ...that you would appear to be possessed by the spirit of your late homicidal father.Kazuma:\n...!Stronghart:\nNow, as I stated earlier, this court has already reached a conclusion with respect to the matter at hand. Inspector Gregson was murdered by Japanese Supreme Court Judge Seishiro Jigoku. As for any hidden circumstances that may exist, they will be investigated in due course by the proper authorities.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nBut we all know what will happen! That'll just give the mastermind of the whole venture time to cover his tracks again!Stronghart:\nBy which you mean me?Ryunosuke:\n...!Stronghart:\nYour punishment for this contemptible behaviour will be decided at a later date. As for you, Prosecutor Asogi... ...you will be remanded following these proceedings. Willingly, I trust...since you gave your word.Kazuma:\nArgh!Stronghart:\nThis futile game of revenge is over...young Master Asogi.Kazuma:\nGrrr... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!Stronghart:\nThat will be all! I hereby declare this trial to be over. Court is-???:Ryunosuke:\nM...Mr Sholmes!Stronghart:\nThis is no place for amateur detection, Mr Sholmes. May I remind you that these proceedings are closed to the general public. You will leave the courtroom at once!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nMr Sholmes was instrumental in the apprehension of Seishiro Jigoku before he fled from Europe. The court should hear what he has to say!Stronghart:\n.........Sholmes:\nLord Mael Stronghart... ...it's imperative that you refrain from bringing this trial to an end at this stage.Stronghart:\nIs it really? And why would that be?Sholmes:\nYou need only recall your own words from the opening of the trial to answer that question. If I may... 'We will stop at nothing to uncover the whole truth behind these disturbing findings!' Surely it can't be... ...that the shock of being accused of being the Reaper yourself has erased that from your memory...can it?Stronghart:\nThe whole truth, sir, has already been uncovered!Sholmes:\n......... It would seem that we have a great many important members of the judiciary present here today. I put it to you, my dear fellows...should the trial end at this juncture? After all, why have you been invited to attend? To nod along to the prevarications of your superiors?Stronghart:\nOrder! Order in court!Sholmes:\nIt seems to me that we stand before a door that leads to a new era of legal practices. A door that is ajar. Let us emerge from the shadows of the Reaper's decade-long ascendancy. For you and you alone, my dear fellows, have the power to push this door open now!Stronghart:\nThe auditors in the gallery have no rights to express an opinion on court proceedings! Silence!He's right. The judge has absolute authority here.Yes, if he calls the trial to an end, it must end!But will that really do?I sense dark things occurring behind the scenes... Dark things indeed...Is there a single person here present who can honestly say he doesn't sense the same?Ryunosuke:\nWhat... What's...?The trial should go on! Summon the witness!\nThat's right! We need to clear this up before that young Japanese fellow is remanded in custody!Kazuma:\n...!My Lord! You assured those present that you would uncover the whole truth here!\nVindicate yourself of this outlandish accusation!The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth! That's the very foundation of British law!Van Zieks:\nA toast...to my dependable colleagues in the gallery!On with the trial! On with the trial!\nTestify! Testify! Testify!Sholmes:\nWell, My Lord? You hear the voice of British justice, I take it? I think you'll find it will be rather awkward to silence.Stronghart:.........The court will recess briefly.Ryunosuke:\n...!Stronghart:\nI have no intention of shrinking from these allegations.Kazuma:\n...!Stronghart:\nBailiff! Arrange for the subpoena of the witness at once! As soon as the gentleman arrives at the courthouse, we shall reconvene.Sholmes:\nA recess won't be necessary, My Lord.Stronghart:\nPardon?Sholmes:\nMikotoba is a close friend of mine. He accompanied me today and is waiting in the antechamber as we speak. I do believe he's been enjoying a little trip down memory lane, in fact.Kazuma:\nWhat?! Professor Mikotoba is here in the courthouse?!Ryunosuke:\nMr Sholmes, you... You didn't know this would happen, did you?!Sholmes:\nMy dear fellow, no one is in a better position to answer that question than you, surely.Ryunosuke:\n(I wasn't just asking for the fun of it, you know.)Stronghart:\nWell, I must thank you for your assistance in this matter... Mr Sholmes. However... ...you are of no further use here. Kindly leave the courtroom at once.Sholmes:\nBut of course. In truth, I find myself rather busy now as a result of these developments. Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke:\nAh! ...Yes?Sholmes:\nI trust you have Iris's little lucky charm with you?Ryunosuke:\nAbsolutely! It's still in my pocket.Sholmes:\nShe sends her regards, and a reminder: If you find yourself at a dead end, the ears are at your disposal. ...Just one tug, if you please.Ryunosuke:\nOh, um...of course!Stronghart:\nIn that case, the trial will continue without delay. Bailiff! Show the witness to the stand!Ryunosuke:\n(So it's Lord Stronghart... He's the Reaper of the Bailey. Where exactly is this trial going to take me, I wonder? Just how deep am I about to be plunged into the blackness of the abyss? Well...I'm ready. I'm ready to head into the heart of this maelstrom and confront whatever horrors it tries to drown me under!)To be continued...Kazuma:\nSo, witness...please state your name and occupation for the court.Mikotoba:\nYujin Mikotoba, lecturer in forensic medicine at the Imperial Yumei University in Tokyo, Japan.Gorey:\n.........Kazuma:\nAnd...Professor Mikotoba, the young lady beside you is...?Mikotoba:\nAh, this is Dr Maria Gorey. Scotland Yard's practising coroner. The daughter of Dr Sithe, I understand.Ryunosuke:\n(Yes, Dr Sithe...)Mikotoba:\nI'm afraid I can't tell you why she's here. She just...appeared.Gorey:\n......... You summon this strange Japanese man as a witness to that autopsy... ...but you don't summon Mama. That makes no sense. She was there too.Mikotoba:\n...That's about the size of it. I've had her eyes boring into the side of my cheek constantly. Whilst I was in the antechamber, too.Ryunosuke:\n(Poor man. The idea of it's making ME shudder...)Stronghart:\nThe revelations about Dr Sithe that came to light some days ago defiled the reputation of the entire judiciary. She was therefore deemed unfit to appear as a witness in today's proceedings. The Ministry of Justice's decision on that is final.Van Zieks:\nWell, we wouldn't want any more perjury to be committed, would we?Gorey:\n.........Ryunosuke:\n(The Ministry of Justice? Some questionable strings are being pulled, I think...)Stronghart:\nI remember you...Dr Mikotoba. But I certainly never expected to be meeting you under these circumstances.Mikotoba:\nYes, it's been a long while, Lord Stronghart.Kazuma:\nThe prosecution understands that you were a visiting student of forensic science in London until ten years ago.Mikotoba:\nThat's right. I studied under Dr Wilson at St Synner's.Van Zieks:\nSo you were present at the autopsy of my brother, Lord Klint van Zieks?Mikotoba:\nI was, yes. I assisted Dr Wilson with the entire procedure.Gorey:\n...Tsk. Mama is far more skilled than any Japanese man.Mikotoba:\nWell, Dr Wilson asked me to be his primary assistant on that occasion.Ryunosuke:\nAnd this autopsy report was actually penned by you, I believe?Mikotoba:\nYes. I noted all of the doctor's findings and when we were done, he read through the document and signed it.Gorey:\nPoor Mama... As secondary assistant, she wouldn't have had such a good view of all the innards.Kazuma:\nSo, Professor...do you remember Inspector Gregson?Mikotoba:\nYes, of course. If it wasn't for his insistence, Lord van Zieks's autopsy would never have happened. But he was absolutely convinced that it would reveal decisive evidence against Genshin, you see. So Lord Stronghart had to entreat the nobility to allow it to take place. Do correct me if I'm wrong, My Lord.Stronghart:\n...It was a result of that autopsy that a mass murderer was apprehended and justice was done.Kazuma:\nBut Gregson admitted it before he was killed! He admitted that the results of the autopsy were fabricated!Mikotoba:\n.........Kazuma:\nYou were there at the time. So you must testify! You have an obligation to tell the truth about what really went on!Mikotoba:\nAbsolutely. That's precisely why I'm here.Gorey:\nAnd that's why I'm here, too!Stronghart:\nVery well, then. You will give your formal testimony now, witness. But before you begin, a word of warning:Mikotoba:\n...Oh?Stronghart:\nYou will state truthfully and accurately what you saw and what you heard at the time.Mikotoba:\n...I wouldn't dream of doing otherwise, My Lord.Stronghart:\nThe moment your testimony verges on supposition, I will expel you from my courtroom. Remember that.Mikotoba:\n.........Witness Testimony\n- The Autopsy of Klint van Zieks -Mikotoba:\nFrom my own observations, I couldn't say there was any indication of the autopsy results having been fabricated.\nDeath resulted from a wound made by a Western-style sword transfixing the heart. That I found a little strange.Gorey:\nThere were no other signs of internal injury. Nothing questionable at all.\nIt was just that beautiful but dangerous piece of evidence removed from the man's stomach.Van Zieks:\nPresumed to have been swallowed by the victim as a way of posthumously identifying his assailant.Kazuma:\nNo indication...? NOTHING to suggest fabrication?!Ryunosuke:\nProfessor Mikotoba! Are you certain about that?Mikotoba:\nWell, nothing that I could positively identify as such, much less swear to in testimony.Kazuma:\nAgh!Stronghart:\nHeh heh heh... Hah hah hah hah hah hah haaah! Well, that clears things up nicely! The only fabrication here, Asogi...has come from you.Kazuma:\nWhat?!Stronghart:\nYou claim the inspector confessed just before his death. But that...THAT is the fabrication!Kazuma:\nNo! He freely acknowledged it! I swear he did!Stronghart:\nFreely? With the tip of a sword at his throat? The man was clearly at his wits' end.Kazuma:\n...!Stronghart:\nThe court will give no credence to this 'confession' that was uttered in obvious desperation. Quite simply, there was nothing questionable about the investigation of Lord Klint van Zieks's death. And with this testimony we have, without question, uncovered the whole truth of the matter!Mikotoba:\nIf I may, My Lord... ...there was most certainly something questionable about it. And the whole truth does rather elude us, I feel.Stronghart:\nI beg your pardon.Mikotoba:\nWell, you're obviously aware of the facts of the case. All four of the Professor's previous victims... ...died when an enormous beast was set upon them that ripped out their throats.Susato:\nOh, such horrifying crimes...Mikotoba:\nBut curiously, the killer's last victim, Lord Klint van Zieks, suffered a different fate.Ryunosuke:\nYes, you're right...Susato:\nHe was stabbed through the heart with a sword...Stronghart:\nThat's enough.Mikotoba:\n...!Stronghart:\nI believe I warned you about this, witness. I promised to curtail your testimony as soon as it entered the realms of supposition or speculation.Mikotoba:\nHmph.Ryunosuke:\nVery well, My Lord. In that case the defence will pursue a conclusion to this during the cross-examination.Stronghart:\nWhat?Ryunosuke:\nI have the right to cross-examine every witness after testimony. And I fully intend to exercise that right!Kazuma:\nRyunosuke...Susato:\nI'm afraid that even the presiding judge... ...has no authority to contravene the letter of the law. As I'm sure every member of the judiciary present in the gallery would agree!Stronghart:\n...Hmph! Very well. You may begin, Counsel. However, the moment your argument strays from the established facts... ...I will not hesitate to bring the cross-examination to an end. Proceed with caution.Ryunosuke:\nYes, My Lord!Cross-Examination\n- The Autopsy of Klint van Zieks -",

No, true, I couldn't. I was at Dr Wilson's side as he performed the procedure, recording what he did. But at times of course, he instructed me to fetch implements and suchlike. Whilst I was away from the operating table, obviously I could have missed something.\nRyunosuke:\nAnd at those times, what was the secondary assistant doing?\nGorey:\n...Following this Japanese man's orders to adjust the lighting or pass him implements. But that doesn't mean Mama wasn't a vital part of the team!\nMikotoba:\nQ-Quite, yes. So would you kindly refrain from starting at my cheek like that?\nKazuma:\nProfessor Mikotoba, think! Was there nothing at all that seemed out of place to you?\nMikotoba:\nWell...yes, there was, as a matter of fact.Mikotoba:\nDeath resulted from a wound made by a Western-style sword transfixing the heart. That I found a little strange.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nIn all of the previous four killings attributed to the Professor... ...the victims were killed by an enormous dog, I believe? Their throats were, well...mauled?\nMikotoba:\nCorrect. And yet Lord van Zieks was stabbed.\nRyunosuke:\nAh! Do, do you mean to say... ...you think Lord Klint van Zieks may not in fact have been one of the Professor's victims?!\nStronghart:\nThere is no basis on which to doubt the findings of the investigations carried out at the time.\nRyunosuke:\nBut...\nStronghart:\nGenshin Asogi confessed to all of his crimes upon his arrest. He admitted to having taken the lives of all five members of the aristocracy.\nKazuma:\nArgh!\nMikotoba:\nYet the beast that was used to carry out the killings was never identified. No evidence was found to suggest that Genshin had ever kept a dog.\nVan Zieks:\n...A true hound of hell.\nKazuma:\n.........Gorey:\nThere were no other signs of internal injury. Nothing questionable at all.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBut, um...you weren't actually present at the autopsy yourself, were you, Dr Gorey?\nGorey:\nDoes that matter?\nRyunosuke:\nWell, I...just wonder how useful your testimony can be in that case, really. I mean, it would be different if your mother, Dr Sithe, were in the stand, but...\nGorey:\nI've read all the paperwork about the case! And Mama's told me the story countless times! The statement I just made is exactly what's written in the autopsy report!\nMikotoba:\nI did confirm that myself at the time, it's true. Besides the stab wound, there were no other signs of internal trauma.\nRyunosuke:\nI see...\nGorey:\n......... Mama told me all about it.\nRyunosuke:\nOh?\nGorey:\nShe said there was nothing of note internally... ...but they did find an amazing piece of evidence. Something unbelievable!\nRyunosuke:\nUnbelievable? What do you mean?\nKazuma:\nCome on, Dr Gorey! What was it?\nGorey:\n.........Present Mr Asogi's Ring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The court has heard that the ring was extracted from the victim's stomach.\"Gorey:\nIt was just that beautiful but dangerous piece of evidence removed from the man's stomach.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nWhat exactly was it, though? What does 'beautiful but dangerous' mean?\nGorey:\nWell... ...it was sparkly and round, with a hole...as if it might slip over a finger perhaps.\nMikotoba:\nIt was a ring. Belonging to Genshin Asogi.\nKazuma:\nM-My father's ring...was inside the victim's stomach?!\nMikotoba:\nAt the time, Genshin wore a large ring on the digitus quartus of his left hand - the fourth or 'ring' finger. I'd understood it was some sort of keepsake.\nKazuma:\nWhen my father left Japan for London sixteen years ago, I was eight years old. But I remember that ring.\nRyunosuke:\nYou do?\nKazuma:\nMy father's possessions were sent to our family home in Japan after his death, but the ring wasn't among them.\nStronghart:\nObviously not. It was a key piece of evidence. It remains under lock and key in the stores at Scotland Yard to this day.\nMikotoba:\nAfter the autopsy, Genshin was summoned by the police to check for the presence of his ring. It wasn't on his hand of course. Moreover...there were deep abrasions on his finger where it had been pulled off.\nVan Zieks:\n.........\nMikotoba:\n...They arrested the man there and then, right before my eyes.\nKazuma:\nHow could they?!\nGorey:\nI brought the ring along with me today.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?!\nGorey:\nHere it is. A bit dusty from years in the stores.\nMikotoba:\nGood gracious! Yes, that's it. I haven't seen that in ten long years...\nKazuma:\nAnd...that was found inside the victim's stomach?\nMikotoba:\n......... I... Yes, I'm afraid so.\nRyunosuke:\nYou hesitated there, Professor Mikotoba. ...Should we read something into that?\nMikotoba:\nAh, well... It's just that thinking back now... ...I didn't actually witness the moment it was extracted from the victim's body.\nSusato:\nOh my! Really?\nMikotoba:\nAt that precise moment, Dr Wilson had asked me to fetch him a new scalpel, you see.\nStronghart:\nDr Gorey... ...the removal of historic evidence from the stores requires my consent, does it not?\nGorey:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\nHowever it came to be here, the court cannot deny that this is crucial evidence for today's proceedings.\nStronghart:\n......... Very well, you may submit it.\nMr Asogi's ring has been entered into the Court Record.\nRyunosuke:\nIt's not the sort of ring normally seen in Japan. (They almost look like claws protecting that jewel...)\nSusato:\nWe must examine it very carefully, Mr Naruhodo. Very carefully indeed!Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBy beautiful and dangerous evidence, you mean this large ring, obviously.\nGorey:\nThat's right. Pulled from the victim's stomach once it had been sliced open nicely.\nVan Zieks:\nIt was my brother's final move before he perished. An ingenious one, to leave us a clue by which to identify his killer.\nMikotoba:\nHe must have ripped the ring from Genshin's finger with his teeth... ...before swallowing it to keep it from being retrieved. ...That was the prevailing hypothesis at the time.\nRyunosuke:\nW-With his teeth?!\nVan Zieks:\nOn his arrest, Genshin Asogi's ring finger on his left hand was found to be badly wounded. ...Evidence of my brother's final struggle against the man.\nRyunosuke:\nAll for this ring...?Examine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Asogi's Ring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaws or jewel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\nThese fat claws are doing a good job of protecting the equally fat gemstone in the middle of this ring. \nSusato:\nYes, if you were clumsy, you could give yourself a rather nasty cut on them, I should think.\nRyunosuke:\nOw! Now my finger's bleeding! The claws really are sharp.\nSusato:\nOh my! That was very quick clumsiness, Mr Naruhodo, even for you.\nRyunosuke:\nUuugh... Who would make such a dangerous ring?! (You couldn't swallow it without doing yourself some fairly serious damage, surely...)\nSusato:\nA sticky mochi bun of about that size would go down much better. With some red bean paste in the middle!\nRyunosuke:\n...Someone as clumsy as me would probably manage to choke on it somehow.Van Zieks:\nPresumed to have been swallowed by the victim as a way of posthumously identifying his assailant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nAnd that was the decisive piece of evidence that led to Genshin Asogi's arrest?\nVan Zieks:\nCorrect.\nStronghart:\nAfter further investigations by Scotland Yard, the man admitted to his crimes.\nKazuma:\nThat's a lie! My father was no killer! Barok van Zieks! It was you! You twisted the truth to suit your purposes!\nVan Zieks:\nYour hatred of me doesn't change the facts that were established ten years ago.\nKazuma:\n...!\nVan Zieks:\nMy brother Klint had closed in on the Professor. In the end, he exposed the man and put a stop to his lethal rampage. ...In the way only a man of my brother's calibre could.\nKazuma:\n.........Ryunosuke:\n(That's everything...is it?)Susato:\nPoor Father. He looks so troubled.Ryunosuke:\nPerhaps because ten years ago...something happened that's been weighing on his mind.Susato:\nOh...Ryunosuke:\n'I couldn't say' were his words. That phrasing was very deliberate, I'm sure!Susato:\nI wonder if he's had his suspicions all these years.Ryunosuke:\nIf that's the case, we need to use this cross-examination to prove what really happened... ...and remove any trace of doubt.Susato:\nIf we could establish that Kazuma-sama's claim of fabricated evidence was true...Ryunosuke:\nWe can't shy away from this now. Even if what we might uncover could lead to total calamity.Susato:\nDon't worry, Mr Naruhodo. I'll be right beside you, whatever may happen!Ryunosuke:\nThe court has heard that the ring was extracted from the victim's stomach. But you didn't actually see it being removed, did you, Professor Mikotoba?Mikotoba:\nThat's right. As I said in my testimony before... ...at that moment, I was fetching a replacement scalpel that Dr Wilson had requested.Ryunosuke:\nIn other words, you can neither confirm nor deny... ...whether this ring in fact really came from the victim's stomach or not.Stronghart:\nWhat are you suggesting, Counsel?Ryunosuke:\nThat the ring was never in the victim's stomach to begin with! It's entirely feasible that Dr Wilson fabricated that detail about the autopsy!Kazuma:\nWhat are you saying?! That Dr Wilson...Ryunosuke:\nThat Dr Wilson was in possession of the ring in advance, after it was somehow stolen from Mr Asogi... ...and he produced it during the procedure, pretending to have found it there and then in the victim's stomach.Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nSupposition at best! What possible evidence do you have to support such a rash claim?!Ryunosuke:\nThis evidence...right here.Kazuma:\nThat's the autopsy report!Stronghart:\nIt's explicit in that report, Counsel. Other than the ring, nothing unusual was noted internally. So I'm not sure how you intend to prove your point.Ryunosuke:\nYou've already done it for me, My Lord. The lack of internal injury says it all.Van Zieks:\nWhat?Ryunosuke:\nTo swallow a ring of this size would require considerable effort and determination. And in addition to its size, there are the sharp claws around the gemstone to contend with.Van Zieks:\nMy brother was a determined man. And on the brink of death, even more so, I'm sure. He would have stopped at nothing to ensure that evil killer was brought to justice.Ryunosuke:\nBut if he really had swallowed that enormous ring... ...it's inconceivable that no traces of its passage down his throat would have remained as internal trauma!Van Zieks:\nNo!Mikotoba:\n......... And there you've arrived at the sticking point. That's precisely why I had my doubts about the findings myself ten years ago.Kazuma:\nThen why didn't you say something at the time?!Mikotoba:\nI did. I still remember the conversation I had with Dr Wilson in the laboratory that day.Wilson:\nLook at this! Now this is a very curious thing to find in a man's stomach, wouldn't you say?Mikotoba:\nBut...isn't that rather peculiar, Dr Wilson?Wilson:\nWhat's that now, Mikotoba?Mikotoba:\nWell, if he swallowed a ring of that size, with those sharp metal claws that it has... ...surely you'd expect to see damage to the throat and oesophagus? Torn mucous membranes at the very least.Wilson:\n.......... Doctor Mikotoba, may I remind you... ...that I have vastly more experience than you.Mikotoba:\nI'm, I'm terribly sorry.Wilson:\nI can think of plenty of ways to explain why no injuries would be seen. No, let's say this: 'The victim would appear to have ingested the item as evidence to identify his assailant.' Go ahead! Write it down!Kazuma:\nSo I was right! Dr Wilson deliberately fabricated the results of the autopsy to implicate my father!Stronghart:\nI'm disappointed, Counsel. That argument is nothing more than speculation.Kazuma:\nWhat?!Stronghart:\nDr Wilson was Britain's leading authority on forensic science and autopsy work. There is no scientific basis on which to doubt the man's expert opinion.Mikotoba:\nPardon the interruption, My Lord, but... ...damage to the mucous membranes of the throat is easily identified even in living subjects.Gorey:\nUsing a device called an 'endoscope', recently demonstrated in practical use in France. I want one! ...The government can pay.Stronghart:\nI don't think so! And Dr Gorey... ...rest assured that your removal of evidence from the stores without permission will not go unpunished.Gorey:\n......... We open up the dead to find the truth.Ryunosuke:\n...!Stronghart:\nI beg your pardon?Gorey:\nBut Mama... She chose to stitch her corpses up...with all her secrets inside... ......... That's wrong.Stronghart:\n.........Ryunosuke:\nDr Gorey... (It's looking as though... ...she's chosen to walk a different path to her 'mama'.)Van Zieks:\nYes...the ring.Kazuma:\nWhat about the ring?Van Zieks:\nI've just remembered something. An earlier incident.Ryunosuke:\nWhat incident?Van Zieks:\nThe one I recounted to you before. About a memory I have... ...of Genshin Asogi saving my life.Kazuma:\nWhat?! My, my father...saved YOUR life?Van Zieks:\nIt was ten years ago, on a foggy night. Genshin and I were walking down some back streets at a late hour. All of a sudden...Don't make a peep! You're comin' with us!Van Zieks:\nAll of our assailants were armed with pistols, their faces obscured by scarves.*Bang!*Van Zieks:\nThe next thing I knew, there was silence all around. Genshin lay on the cobbled street. Blood was seeping from his left hand. He'd shielded me.Van Zieks:\nIt was on the ring finger of his left hand that he used to wear that ring.Ryunosuke:\nAh! Are, are you saying...?Van Zieks:\nI've always believed those thugs were after me. But now I'm starting to question if perhaps I wasn't the intended target after all...Kazuma:\nW-Wait, but...Van Zieks:\nGenshin was arrested two days after that attack. And in that short interval, the decisive evidence needed to indict him was miraculously found.Ryunosuke:\nYou mean...the ring was stolen from him?! You think that's what those thugs were after that night?Kazuma:Kazuma:\n......... You... You pathetic coward... You expect me to believe that you weren't involved?Van Zieks:\nWhat do you mean by that?Kazuma:\nIt was you, wasn't it? You're the one who took it. You stole my father's ring! You set the whole thing up so you could paint him as a mass murderer and have him arrest-Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nKazuma... ...open your eyes.Kazuma:\nR-Ryunosuke?Ryunosuke:\nYou must know deep down... The truth can be completely obscured even when your judgement is only slightly clouded. But at the moment...you seem to be floundering through a dense fog.Kazuma:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nIs that why you were so insistent I should be present in this trial? To see you like this?Kazuma:\n.........Stronghart:\nHeh heh heh... Well, this is an amusing spectacle. What a grandiose expression on your face! As if you were Lady Justice herself.Kazuma:\n...!Stronghart:\nIt seems that you've thoroughly convinced yourself of this alleged fabrication of the autopsy results. So much so that you're apparently blind to the blatant contradiction that would be born out of it.Ryunosuke:\nWha...?Stronghart:\nThough it's extremely hard to believe, let us imagine that there was some misconduct during the autopsy. If that were the case...why would Asogi not have disputed the findings in his trial?Ryunosuke:\nOh...Kazuma:\n...!Stronghart:\nIn the closed court hearing ten years ago, the defendant never once denied the claims against him. ...Isn't that right, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks:\n......... Yes, that is indeed correct. Upon hearing the verdict of 'guilty', he merely closed his eyes, quietly accepting the judgement. The actions of a man who has accepted responsibility for his deeds and is resigned to his fate.Ryunosuke:\nBut, but then...Susato:\nOh my... That is very strange. If Mr Asogi did nothing to oppose the charges against him, then... ...that would surely mean there was no fabricated evidence!Stronghart:\nAn obvious conclusion at which you should have arrived many minutes ago...Prosecutor Asogi. Your twisted loyalty and clouded judgement are hampering your ability for logical thought.Kazuma:\nArgh!Stronghart:\nGenshin Asogi's silence at his hearing can mean only one thing: There was no fabrication of evidence during the autopsy of his final victim ten years ago!Ryunosuke:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! (But if that autopsy was all above board... ...there'll be nothing to stop Lord Stronghart bringing this trial to an immediate conclusion!)Kazuma:Kazuma:\nThank you, Ryunosuke. If it wasn't for your frank words just now... ...this trial may very well have ended prematurely.Ryunosuke:\nK-Kazuma...?Stronghart:\nWhat's this latest absurdity, Counsel?Kazuma:\nMy Lord... ...your reasoning is perfectly sound...but for one, giant hole!Stronghart:\nI beg your pardon?Kazuma:\nYou claim my father's silence was due to the fact that there was no fabricated evidence. But there's another possible explanation. You've overlooked the possibility that he had a reason for maintaining that silence!Van Zieks:Van Zieks:\nSilence that would lead to him being convicted and sent to his death? If the autopsy results were an invention, there's no conceivable reason why the man wouldn't have protested!Kazuma:Kazuma:\nOh, those results were an invention alright. There's no question of that. Or are you forgetting that two people with a connection to that autopsy have been assassinated?Van Zieks:\n...!Kazuma:\nIf I force the grievances I feel from my mind...I start to see you in a very different light. I think perhaps it's you who's been living in delusion these ten years.Van Zieks:\nM...Me...?Susato:\nKazuma-sama has created one last chance for us here, Mr Naruhodo. If we can only show there was a reason for his father's silence in his trial...Ryunosuke:\n(A reason why the man would have said nothing even though he was innocent... Could it have been part of some negotiation, perhaps?)Stronghart:\nEnough rhetoric! The court must be shown evidence. What proof do you have that could possibly explain Asogi's silence in court?Present Dismissal Notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's true that Genshin Asogi's silence during his trial resulted in his conviction...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nThis is the defence's answer to that question!\nStronghart:\nAs I indicated before, my patience for rhetoric is growing thin.\nRyunosuke:\n(You could've at least accompanied that penalty with an explanation of why that answer was wrong...)\nSusato:\nIf Kazuma-sama's father knew that the evidence being used to convict him was fabricated... ...why would he have said nothing in his trial?\nRyunosuke:\nIf it were me, I'd have protested my innocence until I was blue in the face.\nSusato:\nSo if we're right about the autopsy results, there must have been a strong reason for his silence.\nRyunosuke:\nWell then...perhaps... ...he was saying nothing in exchange for some sort of clemency? Ah! (That could be it!) My Lord! The defence would like to-\nLeads back to:\n\"Enough rhetoric! The court must be shown evidence.\"Ryunosuke:\nIt's true that Genshin Asogi's silence during his trial resulted in his conviction... ...but that didn't actually lead to his execution. On the contrary... ...it led to his escape. An escape that was only possible because he'd been sentenced to death.Kazuma:\nAlthough I find it hard to believe my father would have negotiated in that way...the defence is correct. A fake execution, falsification of a death certificate and a jailbreak inside a coffin... Clearly such an elaborate plan couldn't have been carried out by my father alone.Van Zieks:\nHe must have had the help of a collaborator from the judiciary.Ryunosuke:\nI have here the dismissal notice of the chief warder who was working in the prison at the time. The notes read: 'There are indications that the jailbreak was in planning prior to the inmate's incarceration.' In other words... ...there were suggestions of some sort of negotiation between Mr Asogi and the British government!Stronghart:\n.........Kazuma:\nIn exchange for his silence in court, he was given an assurance that he would be broken out of prison... Yes, with that sort of clandestine agreement in place, I can imagine he would have kept very quiet.Ryunosuke:\nI would go further than that, in fact. I would say... ...that the elaborate jailbreak of Mr Asogi can be explained in no other way!Stronghart:\nOrder! Order! First fabricated evidence and now a jailbreak conspiracy?Ryunosuke:\nOf course. Because it's all intimately linked.Kazuma:\nThe prosecution wishes to summon new witnesses to the stand!Stronghart:\nWitnesses?Kazuma:\nPeople who can testify about the jailbreak that took place ten years ago.Ryunosuke:\nAh!Susato:\nGovernor Caidin...? And the poor chief warder of the prison!Stronghart:\nI won't allow this trial to turn into a farce! To summon the governor of the prison after all these years...Mikotoba:\nOh, it wouldn't be any trouble, My Lord.Stronghart:\nWhat?Susato:\nFather...?Mikotoba:\nMy dear friend may appear a little rattlepated at times, but I can assure you he is extremely thorough. He wired both Barclay and the local prison earlier... ...asking Governor Caidin and Mr Vigil to attend the Old Bailey as a matter of extreme urgency.Ryunosuke:\nMr Sholmes did that?Stronghart:\nAre, are you telling me that...?Mikotoba:\nBoth men are, unless I'm much mistaken... ...waiting just outside the courtroom at this very moment.Kazuma:\nMy Lord, you must permit this trial to proceed as you declared at its outset. You promised that we would stop at nothing to uncover the whole truth behind these disturbing findings!Stronghart:\n......... Very well. Bring in the witnesses! Make no mistake: I, too, would like nothing more than to lay this business to rest once and for all!Kazuma:\nWould the new witnesses state their names and occupations for the court, please.Caidin:\nAye. Barry Caidin, governor of Barclay Prison.Vigil:\nEveryone calls me Gossip. I sell jaunty little titbits to passers-by, you-Ryunosuke:\nUm, your other persona, if you don't mind...Vigil:\nOh, I do beg your pardon. Of course...Vigil:\nMy name is Daley Vigil. I used to be the chief warder at Barclay Prison.Kazuma:\nThe reason you've been summoned here to court today... ...is to testify about the jailbreak of the so-called 'Professor' ten years ago.Caidin:\nLosh! The Professor?! We've already been through all this afore. A decade ago! And the conclusion was that there was'nae anythin' untoward happened.Ryunosuke:\nA convict escaped from your prison, Governor. Hardly what you'd call 'nothing untoward'!Caidin:\nAh...well...Ryunosuke:\nThe convict's death certificate was somehow falsified after he was allegedly executed... ...and he escaped the prison inside his own coffin. A plan of that complexity... ...could never have been carried out without the help of somebody of influence inside the prison.Kazuma:\nGovernor Caidin, don't imagine that the passage of time will afford you any protection.Caidin:\n...!Kazuma:\nIf it turns out that you were involved in the plot to break Mr Asogi out of your prison, then of course... ...the consequences will be very serious. In all likelihood, a capital punishment.Caidin:\nGads! Hold on there, laddie! All I did was-Stronghart:\nWitness! ...Governor Caidin...Caidin:\nHm? Ah, aye, SIR!Stronghart:\nYou have a critical role to play in the public safety of our country. A great responsibility to shoulder. The significance of your testimony in court cannot be understated. Therefore...think carefully before you speak. And Prosecutor Asogi...if you threaten the witness again, you will be held in contempt of court.Kazuma:\n...! My apologies, My Lord.Ryunosuke:\nThere's no disputing the fact that an intricate jailbreak plot was enacted ten years ago. Clearly, you were both involved in some way. So you will testify before the court now and explain exactly what took place!Stronghart:\nVery well. Let the witnesses give their formal testimony. Tell the court everything you know of the plot to break Asogi out of Barclay ten years ago!Witness Testimony\n- The Jailbreak Plot -Caidin:\nIt was the day that Japanese jock was found guilty. The directive came from the Prosecutor's Office.\nI assigned the convict to the chief warder Vigil here, and put the plan into action behind the scenes.Vigil:\nI was responsible for Asogi right up until the night of his execution. But I knew nothing of any plot...Caidin:\nI dinnae ken if there were some negotiations between the convict and the Prosecutor's Office.\nAll I did was carry oot my duty! For Her Majesty's great British Empire!Ryunosuke:\nA directive from the Prosecutor's Office? Are you saying that was the jailbreak plot?!Caidin:\n...Aye, that's right.Kazuma:\nWho sent it?! Who authorised that plan?!Caidin:\n......... I dinnae ken that.Kazuma:\nYou're saying you don't know?!Caidin:\nListen, there was'nae a thing aboot that Professor case that was'nae unusual in some way. I did'nae ask any questions. I just did what I was told to do. More than that, I could'nae tell ya.Ryunosuke:\nI see...Kazuma:\nBut if the jailbreak plan originated from the Prosecutor's Office... ...then one thing is very clear: As suspected, there were clandestine dealings going on between Mr Asogi and that office. The jailbreak was promised in exchange for Mr Asogi admitting to crimes he didn't commit!Stronghart:\nThat, Counsel, is nothing more than speculation on your part. So...let me ask the defence...Ryunosuke:\nOh! Yes, My Lord?Stronghart:\nI fail to see how these witnesses have any more pertinent information here. Do you intend to assert your right to a cross-examination?Ryunosuke:\nAbsolutely! I have no intention of squandering a single opportunity, My Lord!Stronghart:\n...It seems all you Japanese are fiercely tenacious. Very well. Proceed, Counsel!Cross-Examination\n- The Jailbreak Plot -",

The directive came from the Prosecutor's Office.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nAnd you say you don't know who actually issued the directive?\nCaidin:\nAye, that's right. All I can be sure of, is that it was official.\nKazuma:\nBut if it was from the Prosecutor's Office, that narrows down who could have issued it straight away.\nVan Zieks:\nAnd it wasn't me.\nCaidin:\nI cannae even say wi' certainty that it did originate from the Prosecutor's Office.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat?\nCaidin:\nThere's no tellin' where it started. There's a fair chance it came from higher up the ladder. Basically... ...I cannae give you any indication of who was behind it.\nRyunosuke:\nYou can't be serious...\nSusato:\nAll we can say for sure is that the order must have come from somebody in authority, I suppose.\nCaidin:\nThe likes of us on the ground, as it were, dinnae bother wi' idle speculation. We just get the job done.Caidin:\nI assigned the convict to the chief warder Vigil here, and put the plan into action behind the scenes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nSo Mr Vigil, you didn't know anything about it at all?\nVigil:\nThat's right. My only role in the scheme...was as a scapegoat. That's right, isn't it...Governor?\nCaidin:\n......... Some poor beggar had to take the rap for it.\nVigil:\n.........\nKazuma:\nAlright then, who else did know about the plan?\nCaidin:\nI've no the first idea, laddie. My part in the whole business was basically just dealin' wi' the aftermath. But I would'nae be surprised if there were other folk in the prison service who'd been given similar orders.\nRyunosuke:\nSo you don't know who else was involved...\nCaidin:\nAye, that's right. All I can tell ya... ...is that the night it actually happened, the person at the reins...was Dr Stevens.\nRyunosuke:\nDr Courtney Stevens? (Or Dr Sithe, as she's known now...)\nVigil:\nHaaah... Why did I have to get caught up in such a terrible business...?Vigil:\nI was responsible for Asogi right up until the night of his execution. But I knew nothing of any plot...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nDid you not notice anything unusual happening in the lead up to that night?\nVigil:\nOh, everything was unusual. Exception after exception. After all, it was the Professor. The man had terrorised the country as never before with his crimes. In order to hide his identity, he was forced to wear an iron mask over his head.\nKazuma:\n...Hideous treatment.\nCaidin:\nThe fella was surprisingly docile for someone who'd taken the lives o' five o' the country's nobles.\nVigil:\nBeing the chief warder, I was the only person permitted to approach his cell. I can still hardly believe that I was duped by my own country.\nRyunosuke:\nI believe you jumped from the window of the governor's office when the jailbreak was blamed on you, didn't you?\nCaidin:\n......... Losh, Vigil... I cannae apologise enough.\nVigil:\nNo, Governor, I don't believe you can. It won't change what's happened.\nCaidin:\n.........\nKazuma:\nAnd what else can you tell us about the situation, Governor Caidin?\nCaidin:\nHaaah...Caidin:\nI dinnae ken if there were some negotiations between the convict and the Prosecutor's Office.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nBut you've already acknowledged that orders came from the Prosecutor's Office to arrange for the man's escape! There must have been some sort of negotiation! It's the only explanation!\nCaidin:\nAye, well, be that as it may. I dinnae ken nothin' aboot that. The witness stand is no place for tellin' what ya don't know for sure. I ken that much, I do.\nKazuma:\nThen I presume you also know this: Not telling what you do know is a criminal offence.\nCaidin:\n...!\nKazuma:\nSo you were just following orders, is that it? I'm afraid that won't absolve you of guilt here.\nRyunosuke:\nA man was still killed illegally, even if he was a condemned criminal. You may very well be found complicit in murder, Governor!\nCaidin:\n.........\nKazuma:\nSo that's what it's to be, is it? Even with the threat of conviction, you won't break your silence.\nCaidin:\n.........Caidin:\nAll I did was carry oot my duty! For Her Majesty's great British Empire!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nDid you carry out the plan in its entirety?\nCaidin:\nAye, I did everythin' I could at the time.\nKazuma:\nAs you know, Genshin Asogi was shot dead in Lowgate Cemetery after the escape. Tell me...was that part of the plan, too?!\nCaidin:\nMy instructions were to do wi' gettin' the jock oot of the jail an' nothin' more. I cannae tell you anythin' aboot what happened after that. Only... Personally, I believe his death was the last part of the plan.\n\n\n\nPursue Daley Vigil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nMr Vigil! Is something wrong?\nVigil:\nUuugh...uuuwaaaaaagh! Yes, sir? What can I do for you, sir?\nRyunosuke:\n......... (He's saluting now? What is it? Some sort of Barclay convention?) What Governor Caidin was just saying seemed to upset you. Did it bring something to mind, perhaps?\nVigil:\n......... For the last ten years, I've completely blotted out the memories of that time from my mind. I was betrayed by my superiors...in the name of my country.\nCaidin:\n.........\nKazuma:\nJust as my father was betrayed, it seems.\nVigil:\n......... But you see...thinking back now... ...I really can't imagine that the shooting of Mr Asogi in the cemetery was ever part of the plan.\nRyunosuke:\nWhat makes you think that?\nVigil:\nWell, it just doesn't make sense, does it? To make the man admit to crimes he didn't commit with the promise of a jailbreak, only to kill him in the end... That's treachery of the worst kind. But the point is, if the intention was always to betray him... ...why would there be any need for all the chicaneries of an escape?\nRyunosuke:\nAh!\nSusato:\nYes! That's quite true!\nVan Zieks:\nIf whoever negotiated with Asogi never intended to keep his or her end of the bargain... ...it would have been far simpler just to let the man be executed in prison as dictated by his sentence.\nKazuma:\n...It all happened in that vast chamber of secrets that is Barclay, behind the high prison walls. I suppose nobody knows what really went on in the execution room now... Yes, it's an unsettling mystery, certainly.\nCaidin:\n......... Truth be told...there is a wee matter that's never quite made sense to me.\nRyunosuke:\n...!\nCaidin:\nIf you believe there was some kind of negotiation behind the jailbreak, atween Asogi and a body at the top... ...it does'nae quite add up, does it?\nRyunosuke:\nGovernor Caidin, I must insist that you explain these doubts that you have... ...by amending your formal testimony!\nCaidin:\nGads! ...Aye, go on then.\nStronghart:\n.........\nChanges statement from \"All I did was carry oot my duty! For Her Majesty's great British Empire!\" to \"It seems to me that the Japanese fella did'nae have nothin' to bargain with.\"\n\n\nKazuma:\nWHAT?!\nCaidin:\nAye, it were a rum do. No doubt aboot it. But ya have to mind, they were special circumstances. It was to protect the British justice system. That's just how the execution had to happen, I think.\nRyunosuke:\nYou're saying that Mr Asogi's murder in Lowgate Cemetery WAS his capital punishment? You realise Mr Vigil tried to take his own life as a result!\nVigil:\n.........\nCaidin:\nAye...well...that's another story.\nKazuma:\nWho was it?! Who shot my father in the cemetery that night?!\nCaidin:\n...I've no answer to that question.\nStronghart:\nHowever it happened, the convict's life was destined to end that night. The moment the execution order was signed, his fate was sealed. This court will not pursue the identity of the individual who carried out the order.\nKazuma:\nGrrr...Caidin:\nIt seems to me that the Japanese fella did'nae have nothin' to bargain with.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nRyunosuke:\nAdmitting to the crimes. That was what he had to bargain with, surely?\nCaidin:\nI cannae see that myself. After all, did the prosecution no have conclusive evidence against the carlie, eh?\nKazuma:\nThis, you mean? 'Discovered' during the final victim's autopsy. There's every possibility this 'conclusive' evidence was fabricated by Scotland Yard and the Prosecutor's Office!\nVan Zieks:\n\nVan Zieks:\nPossibilities are all very well. But nothing has been proven. You can holler about misconduct in the trial ten years ago all you like... ...but if you can't establish that it happened with hard evidence, no one's going to listen.\nCaidin:\nEm...aye, that's right! So what I'm sayin' is... ...the convict had nothin'. Nothin' he could use for any kind of bargainin' at all.\nStronghart:\nThe witness makes an astute point. Logically, it would seem no negotiation could have taken place.\nKazuma:\n.........\nRyunosuke:\n(And yet the plan to break the man out of prison was definitely put into practice. So he must have been armed with something that gave him an angle to negotiate.)Present The Asogi Papers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyunosuke:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Confessing under oath to murders he didn't commit on a verbal assurance of later being broken out of prison...\"Ryunosuke:\n(So Asogi-san agreed to confess to the crimes because he was assured he'd be broken out of prison later...)Susato:\nI really don't think that Kazuma-sama's father would have engaged in such negotiations.Ryunosuke:\nThen perhaps something compelled him to agree?Susato:\nWhat a terrible thing... Using the law to legitimise such underhand dealings with a desperate man... ...only to double-cross him in the end. It's quite the opposite of justice!Ryunosuke:\n(I can't help feeling... ...there's something about this apparent negotiation that doesn't quite add up.)Susato:\nSomething doesn't quite add up, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke:\nNo, it doesn't. But I can't quite put my finger on what yet.Susato:\nWell in that case, we must keep digging until we identify the problem!Ryunosuke:\nConfessing under oath to murders he didn't commit on a verbal assurance of later being broken out of prison... Genshin Asogi was taking an incredibly risky gamble.Kazuma:\nVery true. There was nothing to stop the British breaking their word and executing him behind closed doors anyway. Under normal circumstances, no man would stake his life on a gentleman's agreement like that.Ryunosuke:\nWhich means that Mr Asogi must have had a trump card. Something that guaranteed he wouldn't be betrayed. Some kind of weapon!Caidin:\nHavers! The fella could'nae possibly have had anythin' like that!Ryunosuke:\nBut you know that he did, Governor. The Asogi Papers - the name given to the last will and testament of Genshin Asogi.Caidin:\nAh!Ryunosuke:\nIt turns out that Mr Asogi was hiding his will in his cell at Barclay. Chief Warder Vigil caught him with it one day.Caidin:\nYou...you squealed, did ya, ya wee rat! Did I no tell ya to keep that a secret?!Vigil:\nYou, you can't touch me now!Caidin:\nGAAARGH!Ryunosuke:\nWhen Mr Vigil caught sight of that will through the bars of the convict's cell... ...Mr Asogi pleaded with the warder:Vigil:\nAlright then. But what's on that paper?...A last will and testament. This will is...the only weapon I have left now.Caidin:\nA weapon...?Ryunosuke:\nAnd after the convict had been killed following the elaborate pretence of the jailbreak... ...that document mysteriously disappeared, didn't it?Vigil:\nW-Well yes...all the prison warders searched through the belongings in his cell, but... ...that will was just nowhere to be found.Ryunosuke:\nAs I understand it, an exhaustive search was made for the document - which became known as the Asogi Papers. Governor Caidin... ...I believe you ordered your prison staff to find it at all costs, didn't you?Caidin:\nEh?!Ryunosuke:\nWould I be right in saying that you knew? You knew that the so-called Asogi Papers had the potential to make great waves somehow!Caidin:\nJings! What the blazes are ya bletherin' aboot?! The, the will was found, right an' proper... ...in the fella's cell where I said it would be!Vigil:\nBut how can that be? Where in his cell? We all searched the place from top to bottom!Caidin:\nWell ya did'nae do a proper job, eh, ya peelie-wally galoot!Vigil:\nYou, you can't criticise me now!Caidin:\nI showed it to ya afore, did I no, yon lawyer?Ryunosuke:\nYes, you did. I have the document here. It's written in Japanese, and reads: 'The Last Will and Testament of Genshin Asogi'.Stronghart:\nWhich means everything is as it should be.Ryunosuke:\nNot quite, My Lord. You see, there's an undeniable inconsistency here.Kazuma:\nWhat?! What inconsistency?Ryunosuke:\nMr Asogi described this document as the only weapon he had left. And yet this will contains nothing of significance at all. Nothing that would have given the convict any leverage.Van Zieks:\nAre you suggesting, my learned friend... ...that the last will and testament stored at Barclay Prison all these years... ...is actually a fake?Ryunosuke:\n......... As has clearly been demonstrated already... ...what went on at Barclay Prison...was far from above board!Stronghart:\nThat last vilification by the defence was an affront to the entire British legal system. This absurd notion of a 'weapon' is something for which we have only the former chief warder's word. The man could quite easily be lying. Or at the very least, sorely mistaken.Vigil:\nWhat? No! I, I definitely heard him say that! I swear!Kazuma:\nClearly we need to get to the bottom of this. We need to know exactly what happened with these so-called Asogi Papers!Stronghart:\nA waste of time! ...If the will was fake, where is the real document?Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke:\nMr Vigil was stabbed in the back by the judiciary ten years ago. He lost everything. Very nearly his own life.Vigil:\n...!Caidin:\n...!Ryunosuke:\nAnd now you're going to do it again. You're ready to brand him a liar and turn your back on him without even letting him defend himself!It's clear that Barclay Prison is hiding something.It's clear that the jailbreak was masterminded by somebody in the Prosecutor's Office.It's clear that some illicit negotiations took place....Is Your Lordship just going to gloss over these obvious and reprehensible facts?!Stronghart:\nWhat did you say?!We should hear more from the chief warder.\nHave him testify again!The trial must go on! The man's voice must be heard!Stronghart:\nIt would seem that a vocal few here are utterly blind to the truth. ...Very well then! Let the witness testify again. Tell the court precisely what you think you saw of the convict's last will and testament!Vigil:\nY...Ye...Yes, sir, My Lord!Witness Testimony\n- The Asogi Papers -Vigil:\nAs the warder responsible for condemned convicts, I attended to Mr Asogi and kept watch over his cell.\nThe night after he was found guilty in court, he was doing something with that will in his cell!\nWe turned the cell inside out looking for it after the execution, but to no avail.Caidin:\nI only found oot about the Asogi Papers when a directive came tellin' me to impound them.\nThe document was in the folds of the fella's robe that was left in his cell. A 'kimono', I think it's called.Vigil:\nIn his kimono?! That's...that's a lie! We searched every inch of the man's cell. We looked through all his clothes! It can't be true!Caidin:\nWere you no satisfied wi' callin' me a liar the once, eh, ya wee waffinger?Vigil:\nHah! There's nothing you can do about it now. You don't have any hold over me any more. Other than the hold you like to take on my cravat, of course. Is that what you're going to do, is it? Are you going to give me a good shake again? ...Or are you too scared?Caidin:\nGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!Ryunosuke:\n(Little and large... What a double act.)Stronghart:\nWe complied with Asogi's will as far as was possible. All of his personal effects were delivered to his family home in Japan. ...As a courtesy to the homeland of the most notorious killer our country has ever seen.Kazuma:\n......... And we were much obliged. I can confirm that all of my father's belongings arrived safely.Caidin:\nAye, and you cannae deny the handwritin' is that of your old man, eh?Kazuma:\n...Yes, there's no mistaking that it's my father's brushwork.Ryunosuke:\nReally...?Stronghart:\nAnd this last will and testament was the man's last 'weapon', was it? I think we can safely assume that the convict was merely prattling...knowing that his end was nigh.Kazuma:\n.........Stronghart:\nSo, Counsel for the Defence... your cross-examination, please!Ryunosuke:\nYes, My Lord!Cross-Examination\n- The Asogi Papers -",

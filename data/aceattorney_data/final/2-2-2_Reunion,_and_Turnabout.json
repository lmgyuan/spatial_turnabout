  "previousContext": "Reunion, and Turnabout\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nThat was... no accident... I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini?\nMaya:\nI finally get to see you again, and...\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault. You didn't do it.\nMaya:\nNo, I... I did it... I killed that person.\nPhoenix:\nBut that wasn't you.\nMaya:\nIt doesn't matter. It might as well have been me.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe something like this happened...The events of that gloomy, rainy afternoon that started this whole mess...keep playing through my mind...)\nEpisode 2Reunion, and Turnabout\nJune 16, 3:34 PMWright & Co. Law Offices\n???:\nWhat depressing rain... Do you understand how depressed that makes me!? Do you!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, I guess...\n???:\nBut actually, more than being depressed, I'm angry. Angry at that weather girl on TV. \"I think our little rainy spell will take a break with a day of sun!\"...is what that girl said! I'd stake my life on it!\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's the weather...\n???:\nBut that's why I didn't bother to bring an umbrella today. What nerve, calling herself a weather girl! She's going to hear about my $1500 suit!\nPhoenix:\nUm... About your case... Unless you're planning on suing the weather girl...?\n???:\n... I'm sorry. I thought that before we got down to business, we could have some friendly chatter. My name is Dr. Turner Grey. I'm a surgeon.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me never to end up under his knife...)\nGrey:\nI'm here today because of this incident.\nPhoenix:\n\"Malpractice at Grey Surgical Clinic. Fourteen In-Patients Lose Their Lives!\" ...Oh. You're... the doctor at...?\nGrey:\nIt's really quite upsetting. Did you hear me!? UPSETTING!\nPhoenix:\nYes, yes, I heard you. I agree, it's quite upsetting, Dr. Grey.\nGrey:\nThe one that screwed up was that nurse! It was her that got the medications mixed up and killed those 14 patients! And yet! Now listen good! And yet! That nurse had the nerve to go and die before admitting to her wrongdoing! She didn't even offer any sort of explanation to me! And this is the kicker! She up and has herself a grand ol' accident and crashed her car! Smash! Crunch! Instantly transforming her car into the accordion model!\nPhoenix:\n(That's right... About a year ago, all the tabloid shows were talking about it. Fourteen victims of medical malpractice and the nurse's mysterious fatal accident. There were rumors that Dr. Grey had actually caused that crash. People said it was to forever hide the person responsible for the malpractice incident.)\nGrey:\nWhy would I...? Now, I'm just going to say this once -- Why on Earth would I want to kill that nurse? She's the one who killed those 14 patients! Not me!\nPhoenix:\nI think you need to take a deep breath, doctor, and focus... More to the point, this case is over a year old. Why bring it up now...?\nGrey:\nThat's simple! Because the situation is slipping out of my grasp. This just won't do. My clinic isn't seeing nearly as many patients nowadays. Do you understand what that means!? It means they're not coming to my clinic!\nPhoenix:\n(You don't say...? If it were me, I don't think I'd want to go either.) So... what would you like me to do about it...?\nGrey:\nI want you to help me prove I'm innocent.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you do realize I'm a lawyer, not a private investigator, right?\nGrey:\nNo, this is something only you can do.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nGrey:\nMaya Fey. You know this girl, correct?\nPhoenix:\n...! (Maya! Why would he know her name...!?)\nGrey:\nI heard you were working under her for a little while.\nPhoenix:\nWell, yes... I mean... Hey, wait a second here! I worked UNDER her!?\nGrey:\nYes. Am I wrong? She told me, so I'm not quite sure if...\nPhoenix:\nWell, we worked a few trials together. But she went back to her hometown to undergo more training.\nGrey:\nAh, yes, I heard. It must be lonely for you.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!? Wait... I'm not...!\nGrey:\nShe must be an extraordinary girl to handle such rigid training.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGrey:\nI have an acquaintance who knows a lot about these mystical sorts of things. She's the one who introduced me to Ms. Fey.\nPhoenix:\n(Is Maya... really that famous...?)\nGrey:\nAnd I've already set up an appointment.\nPhoenix:\nFor what?\nGrey:\nWhat else!? A channeling! I'm going to have her call the spirit of that nurse that went and got herself killed!\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh. (Maya... I wonder what she's up to right now...)\nMaya:\nWe, the women of the Fey clan have always been spirit mediums. (Changed from [We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums.] in the original release) It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us.\nPhoenix:\n(That's what she told me... I guess she's learned to accept her responsibilities and become an adult...)\nGrey:\nNot counting training, this will be her first time channeling a spirit, so she gave me one condition before accepting my request.\nPhoenix:\nA condition...?\nGrey:\nThe condition is you, Mr. Wright. She said that she wouldn't do the channeling without first seeing you again.\nPhoenix:\nMe...?\nGrey:\nAnd that is why I've searched you out! You want to see her too, don't you!?\nPhoenix:\n(And so... that is how I ended up visiting Maya's hometown with the doctor...)\nJune 19, 1:25 PMKurain Village\nPhoenix:\n(So this is Kurain Village; Maya's hometown.)\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\nW-Why, hello there.\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\nHmm... What an odd little girl.\n???:\nHey! Wait up, Pearly!!\nPhoenix:\n(Hm? Someone else is coming this way...)\n???:\nNiiiiiiiick!\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya. How are you...? It's good to see you again.\nMaya:\nWow, I didn't think you'd really show up!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not that big a deal. You made it sound like you were soooo far away.\nMaya:\nWell, maybe I exaggerated... just a little.\nPhoenix:\nIt was only 2 hours by train. If I had known you were this close, I'd have visited more.\nMaya:\nNo! You're not allowed. I already decided, you know. Until I become an adult, I have to work hard and be strong by myself...\nPhoenix:\nOh... well... Anyway, congratulations. I'm glad to hear training is going well for you.\nMaya:\nHeh, heh...\nExamine\nPhone booth\nPhoenix:\nIt's an old-style phone booth. I can't say it fits in with this area too well. My cell phone doesn't get reception up here, so who knows. I may need it later.\nBus shelter\nPhoenix:\nAn old bus stop. It says \"Kurain Village\" on the sign post. The buses seem incredibly inconvenient since they only come 3 times a day.\nGiant rock\nPhoenix:\nA giant rock that seems to be reaching for the sky. Its origins are written on a beat-up, old sign. It looks like this giant rock is called the \"Kurain Boulder\". There's a really complex explanation written here, but long story short, it's a big stone for spirits to live in... Or something like that...\nRoad and houses further\nPhoenix:\nRustic, thatch-roofed houses where the other villagers live line the street. They're nowhere near as large or as nice as the manor in front of me. It's kind of odd that I don't see any of the other villagers walking around, though...\nFey Manor\nPhoenix:\nThe biggest, most elegant of the buildings I can see from here. This is Fey Manor; the place Maya calls home. It's easy to be overwhelmed by its presence...\nTalk\nToday's channeling\nPhoenix:\nLooks like you've finally become a full-fledged medium, taking on your first job.\nMaya:\nYeah. I didn't think it would be this soon.\nPhoenix:\nBut this case... Do you know the messy story behind it...?\nMaya:\nHa ha ha, behold the power of the Maya Intelligence Network! Let's see. Fourteen people died because of malpractice on Dr. Grey's part, right? And to pin the blame on the nurse, he killed her in what appeared to be a car accident!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Um, so what is this \"Maya Intelligence Network\" anyway...?\nMaya:\nThe tabloids.\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I thought.\nMaya:\n... Ha ha ha. I'm just pulling your leg, Nick! What really happened is the exact opposite. I heard all about it from Dr. Grey.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nOh, come on, Nick! I wouldn't take a crazed killer as a client! That's too scary, even for me.\nPhoenix:\n(Y-Yeah, I guess so.)\nKurain Village\nPhoenix:\nSo this is your hometown, huh, Maya?\nMaya:\nYup! Kurain Village... But I've heard people call this place \"Medium Valley\", too.\nPhoenix:\nInteresting... So everyone that lives here is a spirit medium?\nMaya:\nPretty much. Most of my ancestors were too, I think...\nPhoenix:\n(That's probably true since the Fey ability to communicate with the dead is so strong...)\nMaya:\nActually, only the women of this village are mediums.\nPhoenix:\nSo what do the men do?\nMaya:\nThey usually work someplace outside the village.\nThe girl earlier\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah, I wanted to ask you about that girl I saw earlier. Do you know her?\nMaya:\nOh, you mean Pearly?\nPhoenix:\nPearly?\nMaya:\nPearl Fey. She's my cousin. Isn't she adorable? Just like yours truly!\nPhoenix:\nCousin... Wait, then that means... Is she also a...?\nMaya:\nYup. She's a medium, too. Pearly's a real genius when it comes to channeling!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, I see. I hope I didn't scare her when I tried to talk to her earlier.\nMaya:\nNah, it's not you. My aunt drilled it into her head that \"if a suspicious-looking person tries to talk to you, run away\".\nPhoenix:\nS-Suspicious-looking...!?\nMaya:\nWell, you're not wearing training clothes, for starters...\nPhoenix:\nOf course not.\nMaya:\nPearly is my aunt's most valued treasure, so she's not allowed to go outside of town. She doesn't know much about the world outside of Kurain Village.\nPhoenix:\nAunt?\nMaya:\nPearly's mother is my aunt, duh. Come on, Nick.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nAh, it's good to see this tarnished badge again.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by \"tarnished\"...?\nMaya:\nWell, look. This badge is like every other. It's bound to lose its color and shine after years and years. But you know, polishing it up once in a while wouldn't be a bad idea.\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nHa ha ha. I'm warning you! I'm not the same weak Maya you knew a year ago, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nYou seem to have a lot of faith in yourself.\nMaya:\nYou'll see soon enough. I think you'll be totally shocked by how good my hamburgers are now!\nPhoenix:\n(Were you training to be a medium or a cook?)\nTurner Grey profile\nMaya:\nHey, it's my client!\nPhoenix:\n\"Client,\" huh? You're really serious about your work, aren't you?\nMaya:\nI thought I'd say it once, just to try it out, like how you always say, \"My client.\"\nAny other evidence\nMaya:\nHmm, nothing really comes to mind, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nDon't say that with such a big smile on your face.\nMaya:\nHa ha. What can I say? I'm in a good mood today.\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this person?\nMaya:\nHey, have I told you this one yet, Nick? We have a legend in this village. It goes like this. \"All the woman of the Fey clan are beauties.\" Well?\nPhoenix:\n...And that's a legend now?\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\nWell, Nick, I've got to get going. It's about time for the channeling to start.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Oh, yeah...\nMaya:\nI'm doing the channeling in my house, so come on in, OK? After I'm done, we can grill up some juicy burgers!\nPhoenix:\nAlright. Good luck, Maya.\nMaya:\nThanks!\nPhoenix:\n(Well... At least she's still the same perky Maya.)\nJune 19Fey ManorMeditation Room\nGrey:\nAh, Mr. Wright. I'm so glad you showed.\nPhoenix:\nSome nice weather we're having today. Aren't you happy?\nGrey:\nNo, not at all. That stupid weather girl made the wrong call again. \"It will rain cats and dogs today!\" she said with a straight face. I can't believe they allow such misguided reports on the public airwaves!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like talking about the weather with this guy is just asking for punishment...)\nGrey:\n...But anyway, this is a splendid manor.\nPhoenix:\n(No argument there... It's hard to believe that this is Maya's house, though...)\nGrey:\nI was given a guidemap to this building. Here, Mr. Wright. I have a copy for you too.\nGuidemap added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nDoor\nPhoenix:\nA door that leads to the Channeling Chamber, the place where spirits and people meet. The iron in this door was tempered, making it very solid. It looks like there is a strong lock on this door to top it off.\nWriting on top of the door\nPhoenix:\nSomeone with a lot of skill wrote these four Chinese characters with a brush. Oh look, here's a translation: \"Once in a Lifetime.\" Its message is people should value their ghostly meetings as once in a lifetime chances.\nBlue board\nPhoenix:\nA piece of cloth with a ton of finely-written characters jammed onto it. Probably esoteric knowledge only mediums should know. ...Hmm, let's see... Here's one in English... It says... \"100 Ways to Save Money\". ... Being a medium sounds like a rough way of life...\nDoor to the Winding Way\nPhoenix:\nThis door leads out to the Winding Way. The weather outside looks really nice.\nTalk\nToday's channeling\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you going to do once the nurse's spirit has been called?\nGrey:\nIsn't it obvious? I'm going to have her write a signed confession.\nPhoenix:\nA signed confession?\nGrey:\nYes, a confession. Pay attention! I'll have her write this: \"One year ago, on May 2nd, 14 patients died due to my negligence. And then, on May 24th, I fell asleep at the wheel and died in a car accident due to my further negligence. I'm sorry and I apologize for being negligent.\" That's what I'll have her write! With a confession, the rain falling on my soul can finally stop.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, I see...\nMaya\nPhoenix:\nSo, how did you hear about Maya Fey...?\nGrey:\nI heard about her from an acquaintance; a girl studying the occult at the college. That girl introduced me to this village. This is the home of the Kurain School of Channeling.\nPhoenix:\nThe home, huh...?\nGrey:\nAnd Ms. Maya is a daughter of the \"Master\", I hear.\nPhoenix:\nMaster...?\nGrey:\nAnyway, do you see that door? That's the room where people and spirits meet. Ms. Maya's aunt is in there right now. Would you care to meet her...?\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nLook, here's my attorney's badge.\nGrey:\nAre you trying to compete with me and my profession with that piece of scrap?\nPhoenix:\n...Uh...\nGrey:\nI am a surgeon. Compared to you lawyers, I'm practically a saint! Yes, well, I don't exactly have any patients right now, but, and listen good! I'm not the one that made the mistake!\nPhoenix:\n(This doctor needs his head examined...)\nGuidemap (Fey Manor)\nPhoenix:\nWow, this manor is really nice, don't you think?\nGrey:\nDo you honestly think this place is all that impressive? Don't make me laugh.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGrey:\nThis is the countryside. Land here is dirt cheap. I will have something much greater one day! I will build my own grand mansion! Did you hear me!? A grand MANSION! This manor will seem like nothing!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh, could you keep that shaking fist away from my face? Thanks...)\nMaya Fey profile\nGrey:\nShe's still young, but one day, she'll bear a big responsibility. She'll be the Master, you know. The MASTER!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess there are \"Master\" mediums, too...)\nMorgan Fey profile\nGrey:\nThat's Ms. Maya's aunt. Earlier, she made me eat some sort of traditional dessert the size of a tea saucer! Hmm, I wonder if Ms. Morgan ever performs channelings herself...?\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you have to say about this person, Dr. Grey?\nGrey:\n...This person... Hmm... Judging by their face...\nPhoenix:\nW-What is it?\nGrey:\nThey have a weak stomach.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really...\nJune 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... It's such a strange atmosphere in here... These flickering lights... I guess they're candles...)\n???:\nGood sir! Who might you be...?\nPhoenix:\nAaah! I-I'm, uh, my name is Phoenix Wright...\n???:\nOh... You must be that good sir...\nPhoenix:\n(\"Good sir\"...? Is she talking about me?)\n???:\nYou are a lawyer, are you not, good sir? I have heard much about you from Mystic Maya.\nPhoenix:\nIs that so? (\"Mystic\" Maya...?)\n???:\nI am Mystic Maya's aunt, Morgan Fey.\nPhoenix:\nN-Nice to meet you.\nMorgan:\nAh, I had wanted to speak with you about a certain incident, good sir. It would seem that perhaps you ask too much of Mystic Maya in performing your duties. Most unbecoming, I'm afraid.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMorgan:\nDon't tell me you have already forgotten? That was it not for Mystic Maya and her assistance, you would surely not have won...\nPhoenix:\n(First a girl that runs away, and now an old lady who says I stink at doing my job... When did I become the poster boy for \"How Not to Make a First Impression\"...?)\nMorgan:\nThe past is the past though. Let us speak of the present now.\nPhoenix:\n...Ah, thank you...\nExamine\nDoor\nPhoenix:\nThe Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. There is a giant iron lock where the handle is. It feels like a curtain that separates the normal world from the spirit one.\nFloor panels on left\nPhoenix:\nThis is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air.\nAltar\nPhoenix:\nI guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement.\nMorgan:\nGood sir! I wonder if you would please not touch the sacred objects. Those objects are being offered to the spirits. If you were to touch them, good sir, they would become cursed. Yes, cursed.\nPhoenix:\n(She really didn't have to talk down to me. I'm not that much of an idiot...)\nFolding screen\nPhoenix:\nThis folding screen is really showing its age. All of its edges are a bit tattered. The lettering is fading too. I think I recognize a few of the characters on here... ...Ku ...ra ...in... I'm pretty sure that's what it says... Maybe I'll ask Maya about it later...\nSpace behind folding screen\nPhoenix:\nThere is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark.\nTalk\nMaya\nPhoenix:\nSo why do you add \"Mystic\" to Maya's name. Isn't that a little... strange?\nMorgan:\nGood sir!\nPhoenix:\nYes!\nMorgan:\nHow dare you be so rude and disrespectful towards Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry.\nMorgan:\nShe must be addressed by her proper title, good sir. You must call her \"Mystic Maya\"!\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... So, about Mystic Maya... Uh...\nMorgan:\nIt is the blood.\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me? \"Blood\"?\nMorgan:\nMystic Maya carries the blood of the Master. In actuality, she is the only one remaining.\nPhoenix:\n(Only one remaining...? What's that supposed to mean?)\nMorgan:\nMystic Maya is the last of the rightful heirs of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nPhoenix:\nOK... Then... where do you stand...?\nMorgan:\nThat is a little more complicated... Although a woman of the Fey family, I am merely a member of the branch family.\nPhoenix:\n...Branch family? What's that?\nMorgan:\nIt is as it sounds. For a member of the branch family, no matter her spiritual power, she can never become the Master of the Kurain School.\nPhoenix:\nSo... how strong are you...?\nMorgan:\n... It is a shame, however I will admit. I can not even begin to compare the lowliness of my power to the Master's.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's how it is...)\nToday's channeling\nPhoenix:\nSo today's channeling will be her first?\nMorgan:\nYes, good sir. Because the spirit of a person who dies in a traffic accident is usually very strong, it is usually easier to call that person to our world.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Traffic accident\" indeed.)\nMorgan:\nThe channeling will take place here, in this Channeling Chamber, good sir. As you can see, I am in the process of preparing.\nChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\nSo... this room is the... Channeling Chamber...?\nMorgan:\nThe place where a spirit medium speaks with those who have departed.\nPhoenix:\nI don't suppose you'd mind if we observed the session...\nMorgan:\nDo not even think of such nonsense! Only the medium and the client may enter here.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh.\nMorgan:\nThe secrets of the Kurain Techniques can not be seen by just anybody.\nPhoenix:\n(That never stopped Maya from doing it in front of me before...)\nMorgan:\nIt is also for your safety, good sir, if something were to go wrong. That is why, while channeling is being performed, that heavy door is securely locked...\nPhoenix:\nOh, that's what the lock is for...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nMorgan:\nGood sir!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes!\nMorgan:\nWhen did you... take a hidden picture of Mystic Maya!?\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh-What!? Wait... It's not like that at all!\nMorgan:\nIt is unforgivable!\nPhoenix:\nOw-ow-ow! (Why did she slap me?)\nTurner Grey profile\nPhoenix:\nAbout this person...\nMorgan:\nOh! It is that man, is it not? A man who wishes to borrow a departed spirit's power to hide the lack of his own. What an insignificant man.\nPhoenix:\nInsignificant...?\nMorgan:\nThat would mean you are that man's insignificant little friend, dear sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Then I guess that makes Maya my insignificant little assistant, huh?)\nAnything else\nMorgan:\nGood sir!\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nMorgan:\nWe would like to begin the channeling at 3 o'clock. If you don't mind, good sir, would you mind allowing me to make preparations?\nPhoenix:\nUh, um, sure... go ahead... (She's a Fey alright! Just as odd as the rest.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMorgan:\n... Oh, yes. I wonder if you have yet to meet Pearl, good sir.\nPhoenix:\nPearl?\nMorgan:\nShe is an adorable, angelic young girl.\nPhoenix:\nOh, that odd...\nMorgan:\nShe is my daughter. Now then, what was it you were about to say...?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What a cute daughter you have... Ahaha...\nMorgan:\nA pure heart that knows not of the evils in this world is a powerful thing, good sir. Please refrain from affiliating with her, I request.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it's not like I had the chance to anyway...)\nMorgan:\nI must insist and stress that you not let it occur.\nPhoenix:\nOkay, okay, I get it!\nJune 19Fey ManorWinding Way\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. This garden is really breath-taking. Someone put a lot of love into it. What is that over there...? ...Is that an incinerator? It looks a little out of place in a garden like this...)\nExamine\nGarden\nPhoenix:\nA splendid garden with a small lamp and traditional decorations. It's a bit small to walk around in... Although, that incinerator piques my curiosity...\nIncinerator\nPhoenix:\nIt's a small incinerator. I don't think garbage trucks come all the way out here to a little village like this. So every family has to burn their own trash.\nSide room\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like there's a room over there, too. A peaceful feeling is emanating from it.\nUrn\nPhoenix:\nIt's a really old urn. The ashes of a person long dead are inside. It looks like something with a long history... Other than that, it's not very interesting, so time to move on.\nJune 19Fey ManorSide Room\nPhoenix:\n(So this is... the Side Room. Looks like it's more of a break room. There is bedding spread out on the floor. It looks like someone's sleeping in one. I shouldn't disturb them...)\nExamine\nWooden bear sculpture\nPhoenix:\nIt's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir. So does this mean it's easy to spot bears here... And for them to spot you...? *gulp*\nAlcove\nPhoenix:\nIt's a small alcove. I have no idea what it's supposed to mean or symbolize. If I had one of these in the office, it would end up as storage space. But here, it's decorated with some pretty flowers and a beautiful hanging scroll.\nSliding door\nPhoenix:\nThis is the first time I've seen a sliding door like this in person. From here, I can see the Winding Way and the little garden in the courtyard.\nBed on right\nPhoenix:\nThere's bedding spread out on the floor. Is that someone sleeping in one over there? She's probably an exhausted medium taking a break and catching some z's. If I wake her up, she might be grumpy and throw a spell on me. It's probably a good idea to not disturb her sleep...\nWinding Way (after visiting Side Room and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber)\n???:\nHey! You! Hold on, now! This gal's got a few questions to ask!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I'm sure I've heard that southern accent somewhere before...)\n???:\nOh, well I'll be! It's Mr. Phoenix Wright! How ya been!? Haven't seen you in, what, a year!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... You... are... uh...\nLotta Hair\nPhoenix:\nUm, Lotta Hair, was it?\n???:\nL-L-Lotta Who!? Wait, you best not be making fun of my hair, now!\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, um, I wasn't \"making fun\"... I was \"complimenting\" you on your fine hair...\n???:\nHmph, I dare say yer one heartless man, Mr. Wright. It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty. But looks like you already forgot that.\nPhoenix:\nHold up... you were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak...\n???:\nMinor detail. Stop being so uptight; lettin' little things get in the way. The name's Hart. Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it!\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah! That's it!\nLotta:\nNow listen here. I'm here to take some pictures today. Gonna get myself a real scoop.\nPhoenix:\nAh, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.\nLotta:\nYou betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!?\nLeads to:\n\"Oh, that's right!\"\nLotta Hart\nPhoenix:\nYou're Lotta Hart, right...?\nLotta:\nBingo! I'm the one and only \"paranormal photographer\", Lotta Hart!\nPhoenix:\nAh, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.\nLotta:\nOf course! And today, I'm gonna get myself a real scoop! You wait and see!\nLeads to:\n\"Oh, that's right!\"\nWho are you again?\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but who are you again?\n???:\nOh Lawdy! I've met some cold men in my days, but you... You're in an icebox of yer own!\nPhoenix:\nCome on, am I really that bad...?\n???:\nPut yer noggin to some use! You've gotta remember who I am! It was cause of my testimony that yer friend got outta being guilty.\nPhoenix:\nAh! You're the one from that trial!\n???:\nSee, I knew you could remember if you tried!\nPhoenix:\nYou were working with the prosecution at first as one of their witnesses, and came after us as if we were a piece of sirloin steak...\n???:\nWhy don't we let bygones be bygones, now. It's yesterday's news, right? Name's Lotta Hart. Don't you go forgetting it, ya hear!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... So what brings you here today?\nLotta:\nHah! You should already know! I'm here for the big scoop! I can feel it!\nPhoenix:\nAh, so I guess you're still at it? Being a photographer, I mean.\nLotta:\nYou betcha! The hardest working one out there, I reckon! Didn't I say I was gonna make a name for myself as a famous \"paranormal photographer\"!?\nLeads to:\n\"Oh, that's right!\"\nLotta:\nOh, that's right! This ain't no time to be wastin' time! The channeling's about to get started!\nPhoenix:\nIs it that time already!?\nLotta:\nWe all should hurry up and get to the Meditation Room. ...What are you waiting around for!? Come on!\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta Hart, huh? I've been judging her harshly because of that case, but, I guess looking back, we had some good times, too...)\nJune 19Fey ManorMeditation Room\nMorgan:\nWe will now begin the channeling. Mystic Maya and honored guest, please proceed into the Channeling Chamber.\nGrey:\nWith this, I can finally swat all those pesky flies, once and for all! You hear me!? They won't be able to say a single bad thing about me after this! You would love to hear them apologize, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nMe!? Oh, uh, yeah, I sure would.\nMorgan:\nMystic Maya, do you have the Channeling Chamber key?\nMaya:\nYup, right here.\nMorgan:\nThat is most satisfactory. That key is one-of-a-kind, so please take care of it well.\nMaya:\nIt'll be fine, Aunt Morgan. I won't lose it, trust me! OK, Dr. Grey. Let's get started.\nGrey:\nFinally! Let's go!\n*click*\nMorgan:\nNow let us wait patiently out here for them. Please have some lovely bitter green tea and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts...\nLotta:\nHold on, now, granny!\nMorgan:\n...Granny?\nLotta:\nHow come we ain't allowed in that room!?\nMorgan:\nDear madam, you have an \"impressive\" grasp of English. From where did you learn it?\nLotta:\nWhat!? I'm from the heart of the heartland!\nMorgan:\nIs that so? Then I humbly request that you return to this \"Heart of the Heartland\".\nLotta:\nWh-What are ya...?\nMorgan:\nThis is Kurain Village. If you can not follow our traditions and rules, we request that you leave!\nLotta:\n...! ... Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. She shut Lotta up! Now THAT's impressive!)\nMorgan:\nNow then, let us wait.\n*BANG*\nLotta:\nHey now! Wh-What was that just now!?\nPhoenix:\n(It came from inside the Channeling Chamber...)\n*BANG*\nLotta:\nHey! Th-That's a gunshot!\nMorgan:\nE-Excuse me!?\nLotta:\nI've heard that sound before. It's a gunshot! I'd bet my afro on it!\nPhoenix:\n(M-Maya! Maya's in there!)\nBreak into the Chamber\nLotta:\nWell, Mister Lawyer! What's the plan!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat else!? We're going to break in!\nLotta:\nWhat!? But... But there's only one key and that kid's got it.\nPhoenix:\nWe're going to have to break the door. Is that alright, Ms. Fey?\nMorgan:\nWell, yes... But there is one matter... That is...\nPhoenix:\nDon't try to stop me! You can send the repair bill to the Wright & Co. Law Offices later!\nLeads to:\n\"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\"\nAsk Morgan what to do\nPhoenix:\nMs. Fey! What should we do!?\nLotta:\nYellow-bellied chicken liver! What are ya waiting for!? Kick it down already!\nPhoenix:\nBut... The key...\nMorgan:\nThat key is one-of-a-kind. In this world, there is only that one. Even I am powerless to open that door.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, there is really no other way...) Alright. Stand aside! I'm going to break the door down!\nMorgan:\nW-Wait! Please! That sort of recklessness...\nLeads to:\n\"Yeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\"\nLotta:\nYeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\n*SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!*\nPhoenix:\nD-Dr. Grey!!\n*klik*\n???:\n...I... ...I was... murdered...\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya?\n???:\nThat man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\n*klik*\nPhoenix:\nLotta! At a time like this!?\nLotta:\nTimes like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!?\nStep away from there!\nMorgan:\nPlease leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police!\nPhoenix:\nBut, but...\nMorgan:\nHurry! Before there are more victims here!\nLotta:\nHey, let's go, City Boy! Leave this to the granny!\nJune 19Kurain Village\nPhoenix:\n(My cell phone doesn't get reception way out here... So I ended up using the phone booth to call the police...)\nLotta:\nAnd...?\nPhoenix:\nThey're on their way.\nLotta:\nThat's good. Lawdy, I saw a genuine \"mysterious phenomenon\"...\nPhoenix:\n(She seems really on edge because of all this... Not that I blame her... I'm scared to death by what's going on...)\nTalk\nWhat you witnessed\nLotta:\nHey, Mister. That gal... Maya. She wasn't the one that pulled the trigger, was she...?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, yeah... Lotta doesn't know that when Maya is channeling, her whole physical appearance changes.)\nLotta:\nThen again... Weren't there only the two of 'em in there? I reckon she musta done it then...\nDr. Grey\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what do you know about Dr. Grey?\nLotta:\nNot much, but I did some digging... That's one gent with a bad reputation.\nPhoenix:\nReally?\nLotta:\nI hear he's good at surgery and stuff, but his personality stinks like wet sheep.\nPhoenix:\n(I sort of got the same impression myself...)\nLotta:\nHe's real controllin'. Soon as his nurse or patients don't do what he says, he starts a-hollerin'. Musta been real rough to work for him.\nPresent\nAnything\nLotta:\nHey, they'll be here soon, right? The police, I mean. I reckon you should be gettin' back to the crime scene, now.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I guess so...)\nJune 19Fey ManorMeditation Room\nMorgan:\nAh, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nMs. Fey! How's, um... Mystic... Maya?\nMorgan:\nShe has returned to \"this world\". The Spirit Severing Technique was successful.\nPhoenix:\nLet me see her, please!\nMorgan:\nShe is still unconscious. I humbly request that you wait outside for her recovery.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I just have to wait... *sigh*)\nGumshoe:\nThe police are here! Sorry to keep you waiting! Huh? ...You again!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you doing all the way out here, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nIt's actually kinda funny. I was in the area for a business trip, pal. Well, time to check out the crime scene. I'll have to question everyone here later on, so just sit tight, alright?\nPhoenix:\n(Why is he grinning at me...?)\nMorgan:\nShall I show you to the scene of the crime, Detective Gymshoe?\nGumshoe:\nUm... My name isn't Gymshoe...\nPhoenix:\n(The two of them went into the Channeling Chamber... I guess all I can do for now is see what everyone else has to say...)\nJune 19Kurain Village\nLotta:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(She's probably scared out of her wits after having a murder take place right near her.) Lotta?\nLotta:\nGAWDDON'TLETITBEMENEXT!\nPhoenix:\nEek! Don't scare me like that!\nLotta:\nWhat do you mean!? Yer the one scaring me! If I weren't so tough, you'd have another dead body on yer hands -- mine!\nTalk\nAny ideas\nLeads to:\n\"Did you see or notice anything that stuck out at you?\"\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nLotta:\nMust be an awful thing to see each other again and have this happen. Never woulda guessed that gal would end up being a murderer.\nPhoenix:\nThat wasn't Maya! She was being controlled by a spirit...\nLotta:\nCome on, now, City Boy. Ya really think the cops'll believe that?\nTurner Grey profile\nLotta:\nHey, it's that Dr. Grey guy. Pity what happened to him. Pretty scary what ghouls and ghosts can do to a man, huh? Gawd rest his poor soul.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Since when was Lotta so religious...?)\nMorgan Fey profile\nLotta:\nThat old lady sure can be forceful. She scared me back there. ...Well, only a little, now, ya hear?\nDick Gumshoe profile\nLotta:\nI swear I've seen his face before. Maybe during that last case... Whenever something happens, this detective guy is always there. I wonder if he's the real baddie behind everything?\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I highly doubt it...)\nAnything else\nLotta:\nNope. Don't know nothin' about that. Things that don't catch my eye, don't catch my interest.\nPhoenix:\n(And she calls herself a journalist??)\nPhoenix:\nDid you see or notice anything that stuck out at you?\nLotta:\nNah... Well, maybe one thing...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it!?\nLotta:\nTurns out my poor stomach's not good at handlin' this kind of thing.\nPhoenix:\nHuh-what?\nLotta:\nCurses and ghosts and stuff comin' back to get ya... This is just too much, I say.\nPhoenix:\nWhat is too much?\nLotta:\nBeing an occult photographer. That's some scary stuff, so I think I'm gonna try being a celebrity photographer, now.\nPhoenix:\nGoing after photos more within your reach from now on? More glamour, less gore?\nLotta:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's up?\nLotta:\nOh, yeah!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nLotta:\nI took some hot pictures earlier!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nLotta:\nRemember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside!\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! She did! Two even!)\nLotta:\n\"The S\u00e9ance Murder\"... I sure like the ring of that. It'll be a sensational story!\nPhoenix:\nL-Lotta!\nLotta:\nSorry, but my journalistic sense is burnin' inside me! Hate to cut and run, but I'm headin' back in! Gotta beat those cops to the scoop of the century! UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhahahahahahahahahahaha... ...\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know who's scarier... Lotta or the spirits... And why does it feel like we've been through this before...?)\nJune 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\n(The police are busily running here and there, and I don't see Maya anywhere...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, you! Don't touch anything!\nPhoenix:\nLook, I really need to ask you some questions!\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Don't look at me like I'm some sort of uncaring jerk... Tell you what, pal. I'll let you ask me a few questions, alright?\nExamine\nAnywhere\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal! No touching without my permission!\nPhoenix:\nI'm just looking at it.\nGumshoe:\nHey, I can't be too careful if a kid like her can be a murder suspect, now can I?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess if I want to search this room, I'm going to have to come back later...)\nTalk\nMaya\nPhoenix:\nUm, about Maya...\nGumshoe:\nI hate to break this to you, pal, but... with the way things look now, that girl's the only one who could've done it.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah. Only Maya and the victim were inside this room, after all...) But Maya is...\nGumshoe:\nYou can ask more about her later, pal. Right now, I've got a job to do and that's collecting evidence.\nPhoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe looks like a real professional. And yet, something about his expression still looks the same...)\nCause of death\nPhoenix:\nSo... Dr. Grey was shot with a gun, huh?\nGumshoe:\nHe was shot in the forehead. But...\nPhoenix:\nBut...?\nGumshoe:\nBut he was also stabbed in the chest with a knife.\nPhoenix:\n(...A knife?)\nGumshoe:\nBasically, the vic was first stabbed, then he was shot. (Changed from [After being stabbed, the final blow was a shot from a gun.] in the original release)\nPresent\nAnything\nGumshoe:\nAh, I'm really busy right now. I can take a look at it later, alright, pal?\nPhoenix:\n(He didn't even take a glance at it...)\nJune 19Fey ManorSide Room\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I'm pretty sure there was someone sleeping here earlier...)\n???:\nLike, how can I help you?\nPhoenix:\nAck! Ah, I'm, uh... That is... I...\n???:\nUm, like, so isn't it about time to start?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Time to start what?\n???:\nYou know, like, the channeling!\nPhoenix:\nChanneling...? Oh, oh, oh, oh!! No, actually, the situation has kind of changed...\n???:\nHuh? Like, what do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nPlease stay calm, but... there has been a murder! (Changed from [Please stay calm, but... a murder has taken place!] in the original release)\n???:\n... Um, so, like... A murder is that thing where, like, one person kills another, right?\nPhoenix:\nYes! A person has killed another person!\n???:\nOh, that's... Uh... What are the words I'm looking for...? It's like... ...like totally a bummer.\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah... (After all that effort, that's all she had to say?)\n???:\nOh, I'm sorry. I forgot to, like, introduce myself.\nIni:\nMy name is Ini Miney. Um... At the college, I'm researching and studying \"parapsychology\".\nPhoenix:\n\"Parapsychology\"?\nIni:\nThat's right. Um... I think people, like, usually call it, \"occult studies\" or something. Like supernatural phenomenon, ESP and psychic powers. That sort of stuff.\nPhoenix:\n(That's pretty out there...) I'm Phoenix Wright, attorney at law.\nExamine\nBed on right\nPhoenix:\nYou left the blanket a mess. Are you going to fold it?\nIni:\nLike I had a really good nap, and, like... I was thinking of leaving it like this, so, like, it's all set for tonight.\nTalk\nIni Miney\nPhoenix:\nSo what brings you here today?\nIni:\nUm, like, so... I was the one who told Dr. Grey about this place. He asked me, like, \"Do you know of a good spirit medium?\"\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, Dr. Grey did say something about being introduced to this place.)\nIni:\nCause, like, talking to dead people and, like, multiple personalities are my thing...\nPhoenix:\nI see... Then why were you taking a nap here?\nIni:\nLike... I wasn't feeling good.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nIni:\nI'm, like, allergic to sesame seeds. They, like, must've put some in the food they served for lunch.\nPhoenix:\nOh, that doesn't sound fun.\nIni:\nSo I, like, felt sick, and came in here to, like, sleep. I totally feel, like, I've wasted my time 'cause I, like, slept a long time.\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nSo you were sleeping here the entire time?\nIni:\nYeah. Ever since lunch...\nPhoenix:\nSo you don't know anything about the murder that took place?\nIni:\nLike, what? Oh, that! I, like, totally know nothing. So who was, like, you know, killed...?\nPhoenix:\nThe surgeon that requested the channeling, Dr. Grey.\nIni:\n...\nThe victim (appears after \"Ini Miney\" and \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nYou and Dr. Grey knew each other, right?\nIni:\n...! I don't know any Dr. Grey!\nPhoenix:\nOh really...? Then what was all that talk about him earlier? (Changed from [That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...] in the original release)\nIni:\nHuh!? ...Well, uh... Like, a long, long time ago... I was, like, a patient, yeah.\nPhoenix:\n(She sounds like she's trying to hide something...)\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nIni:\nOh, hey! That's, like, Maya Fey, right? She's, like, totally waaaay famous! Like, well, for people like us, like, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Waaaay famous\"? Maya?)\nIni:\nI mean, like, she's, like, the daughter of the Master, right?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Well, at least she remembers some things.)\nIni Miney profile\nIni:\nUm... This face... Like, I think I've seen it somewhere before...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? ...Y-You're joking, right?\nIni:\nHa ha, like, of course I am, silly!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, thank goodness...)\nAny other evidence\nIni:\nLike, I'm really sorry, but I'm not all that smart... so I don't, like, get it.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. Why does it feel like she's just putting on an act?)\nAny other profile\nIni:\nI'm, like, totally bad at remembering people's names.\nPhoenix:\nOh?\nIni:\nBut I, like, remember seeing that face somewhere before, like, I think...\nPhoenix:\nWell, thanks for trying. (I didn't think it was possible for someone to be this much of an airhead...)\nJune 19Fey ManorWinding Way\nPhoenix:\n(There's no one here... as usual.) Ack! ...H-Hey... How are you?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYou're Pearl, right?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. Silent as ever... ...? What's that she's got in her hand? I've seen it somewhere before...)\nTalk\nAny option\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?)\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nPearl:\n...!\nPhoenix:\n(...What is it!? Is it my hair? Is it too spiky? Not spiky enough!?)\nAfter clearing \"Any ideas\" Talk option in Kurain Village and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber and Fey Manor - Side Room:\nJune 19Fey ManorMeditation Room\nMorgan:\nOh, dear madam... You have such impeccable timing.\nIni:\nLike, what's all the buzz?\nGumshoe:\nAhem. Alright everyone, listen up! You too, pal! I'm going to give you all a brief update! Right now, it looks like the investigation's not going to be done until real late...\nMorgan:\nThat is a terrible shame. I propose that everyone sleep here under the roof of the Fey Manor tonight.\nPhoenix:\n(What a mess. I can't believe how crazy this day turned out... Maya was arrested and taken away by the police. And I don't see myself getting any sleep tonight...)\nJune 20, 8:02 AMFey ManorMeditation Room\nPhoenix:\n(*yawn* Uuugh... Morning... I guess I must have nodded off at some point... I hope Maya's OK. I should hurry and get to the Detention Center, ASAP!)\nJune 20, 10:34 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nN... Nick! Nick! I...!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nWhat am I going to do!? I never imagined it would turn out like this!\nPhoenix:\nCalm down, Maya! Take deep breaths. (Come to think of it, the first time I met her... It all started right here, in this detention center...)\nMaya:\nI finally... I finally get to see you again, and...\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault. You didn't do it.\nMaya:\nNo, I... I did it... I killed that person.\nPhoenix:\nBut that wasn't you.\nMaya:\nIt doesn't matter. It might as well have been me. I was too weak... and I... I couldn't control the spirit's power, so...\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to bring up the case quite yet, but...)\nMaya:\n...You don't have to be nice to me. I understand.\nExamine\nSurveillance camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera.\nGuard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. I wonder if he's bored. Not that I can tell since he never looks over this way.\nTalk\nChanneling\nPhoenix:\nSo you're the Master or something of the Kurain School of Channeling...?\nMaya:\nActually, my mother is for now. But since that title is passed from mother to daughter, I guess I will be someday...\nPhoenix:\nBut many people think that channeling isn't real, that it's all just an act.\nMaya:\nYou believe in us, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... because I've seen it with my own eyes. (When Maya's channeling a spirit... not only her voice, but her whole physical appearance changes. It's a supernatural phenomenon that occurs every time. It happened this time, too... Dr. Grey said that he wanted to call the nurse, so... Maya's body must have taken on that nurse's appearance...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nWhat exactly happened in the Channeling Chamber?\nMaya:\n... I went into that room with Dr. Grey, locked the door... and sat down across from him.\nPhoenix:\nOK...\nMaya:\nWe closed our eyes...and I began the channeling.\nPhoenix:\n(This is sounding kind of creepy... like the beginning of a scary story...)\nMaya:\nAnd that's the last thing I remember...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nAfter a spirit comes into my body, I lose my self, my consciousness.\nPhoenix:\nThen, you don't remember a single thing?\nMaya:\nWhen I came to, I was being held in my aunt's arms. And there was blood... all over my clothes.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nMaya:\nOh! But... I do remember having a dream.\nPhoenix:\nA dream...?\n\"Dream\" (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of dream did you have while you were channeling...?\nMaya:\nUm... I can't remember it all that well, but... I was dead and buried in the ground. I couldn't move... and it was unbearable... Really suffocating... ...It went something like that.\nPhoenix:\nI... I see... (I have no idea what to say to that...)\nMaya:\nThere was a really familiar smell too...\nPhoenix:\nUnder the ground?\nMaya:\nYeah, I can't quite place it, but I know I've smelled that same scent before...\nPresent\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nI... I can't face myself...\nPhoenix:\n(I should've known better...)\nTurner Grey profile\nMaya:\n!! T-The... That's the guy I k-killed...\nPhoenix:\nAck! I'm sorry! (Why did I pull this picture out!?)\nPearl Fey profile\nMaya:\nPearly... She definitely has more than me...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What are you talking about?\nMaya:\nWho I think the next Master should be... I mean, she's got more spiritual power than me, and she really works hard at her training...\nPhoenix:\n(Talk about bringing the mood down even further... *sigh*)\nMorgan Fey profile\nMaya:\nI... I can't face my aunt right now... Not now... that this has happened...\nPhoenix:\nIt's alright, Maya. I'm sure she understands. She's on our side, after all.\nMaya:\nYeah, I know... But still...\nLotta Hart profile\nMaya:\nThat's Lotta Hart... right?\nPhoenix:\nThat girl is still after the next sensational photo.\nMaya:\nHa ha. I guess some things never change.\nDick Gumshoe profile\nMaya:\nI felt terrible during the questioning session... I mean, Gumshoe kept looking at me... with these really sad eyes... ...\nAny other evidence\nMaya:\nSorry, Nick, but there's nothing really special about it.\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nSo... what do you think about this person...?\nMaya:\n...?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I can't expect her to know anything about this person.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all the information I'm going to gather for today...) I'll be back later, Maya. In the meantime, please make sure you prepare it, OK?\nMaya:\nHuh? \"It\"? What is \"it\"?\nPhoenix:\nThe document requesting me to be your attorney, of course.\nMaya:\n...! But...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's wrong?\nMaya:\nAre you sure? I mean, I'm guilty! I'm a murderer!\nPhoenix:\nNo one's decided that yet.\nMaya:\nBut I did! I killed that person... with these... two hands...!\nPhoenix:\nThat's enough, Maya.\nMaya:\nIt's hopeless! If you defend me, you'll lose, I'm sure...\nPhoenix:\nStop it!\nMaya:\n... ...Help me... Nick, help me... I'm scared...\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry, I will. When is the trial?\nMaya:\nIt sounds like tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\n(As usual, zero prep time...) Alright. I'm going now.\nMaya:\nWait.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nMaya:\nThis jewel... This is called a Magatama. It's a magical charm and it's always protected me. Give this to Pearly... And I'm sure she'll lend you her spiritual powers.\nMagatama received from Maya.\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nMaya:\nMake sure you show that to Pearly, OK, Nick? I'm sure she'll be a big help to you.\nJune 20Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nPhew. It feels like I've been gone forever. But it's only been one day... (Oh, that's right!) Where's that newspaper Dr. Grey brought the other day...? ...Ah, here it is. Right on top of my desk. (This is the only thing he left behind that's going to be of any help...)\nNewspaper Clipping 1 added to the Court Record.\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. Until recently, it had been a normal, business-class hotel.\nHouseplant\nPhoenix:\nCharley. A quite decorative plant. It's a memento of my boss, Mia... who passed away. The rest of the room may be in shambles, but I always manage to care for this little fella.\nPoster\nPhoenix:\nA poster of the TV action hero, the Steel Samurai. Maya stuck it up here right before she left. I wouldn't say that the Steel Samurai and an attorney's office are a good match, but Maya threatened to curse me with some magic spell... so I guess it can stay.\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long, a layer of dust has started to form. One of these days, I should try to build up the courage to read one... Maybe.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nIt's my desk. I keep it neat for those rare occasions when I actually have a client in the office.\nAfter visiting Wright & Co. Law Offices or Kurain Village:\nJune 20Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(Maya must still be in questioning... I hope the detectives are taking it easy on her, but... these kinds of cases aren't taken lightly. I guess I'll come back later.)\nJune 20Kurain Village\nPhoenix:\n(I have to save Maya, no matter what! It's her life on the line! What in the world happened in that room yesterday?)\nJune 20Fey ManorMeditation Room\nPhoenix:\n(The Meditation Room nurtures all mediums young and old. Even mediums in training, I'd wager. But it's pretty deserted today... ...probably because of the murder yesterday...)\nJune 20Fey ManorChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today... I should take this chance and thoroughly check this room. If I'm lucky, I might uncover a clue or two...\nMorgan:\nOh, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nGood morning.\nMorgan:\nI am on my way to go meet Mystic Maya, and I thought to bring her some items to make her feel more at home. Namely, tea so bitter you lose your tongue and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure Maya will be very grateful...\nMorgan:\nThat's \"Mystic Maya\", good sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. She is one scary lady.)\nMorgan:\nOh, dear, sweet Mystic Maya... Pearl wept constantly for you last night, as did I.\nPhoenix:\n(I know it's important for me to search the site, but I should ask her some questions too, while I have the chance...)\nExamine (left side)\nDoor\nPhoenix:\nThe Meditation Room is on the other side of this very heavy-looking door. The lock on it is broken, because, well... I broke it. It doesn't seem possible, but I managed to break it pretty badly. When we want to do something bad enough, people can do the most amazing things.\nFloor panels on left\nPhoenix:\nThis is where the medium sits, I assume. There are 4 panels of this flooring. The straw in the flooring feels a little damp, probably from the humidity in the air. No matter what I do, my eyes keep getting drawn to the pool of blood in the center here.\nAltar\nPhoenix:\nI guess this is an altar. Whatever it is, it feels very important. (Changed from [I guess this is an alter [sic]. Whatever it is, it feels very important.] in the original release) A mirror-like object with a cloudy reflective surface, and some branches of a sacred tree have been set in a pre-determined arrangement. I'd guess they're used during the channeling...\nFolding screen\nPhoenix:\nIt's a beautiful and expensive folding screen. It also looks quite old. There seems to be some sort of sacred text written on it, but I can't read it. ...\u00a0! Th-This is... It's a hole! Could this have been made by a bullet?\nFolding Screen added to the Court Record.\nSpace behind folding screen\nPhoenix:\nThere is some empty space behind the folding screen. The light of the candles can't reach back there, so it's completely dark. I hope no one is hiding back there.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nI would like to ask you a few questions about what happened yesterday.\nMorgan:\nDo you mean that awful tragedy?\n???:\nThat man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him...\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya?\nStep away from there!\nMorgan:\nPlease leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police!\nPhoenix:\nWhat happened here in this room after I left?\nMorgan:\nWell... First, I struck Mystic Maya on the head.\nPhoenix:\nTo make her go unconscious, correct?\nMorgan:\nThat is correct. Next, I performed the Spirit Severing Technique.\nPhoenix:\n\"Spirit Severing Technique\"?\nMorgan:\nThe spirit of that nurse was inside of Mystic Maya's body. I used the technique to send the nurse's spirit back to the other world.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if this kind of testimony is even admissible in a court of law...)\nChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\nBy the way, what is this room exactly...?\nMorgan:\nThe Channeling Chamber? This room was created for the sole purpose of preventing such a tragedy as yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nMorgan:\nSometimes, when an inexperienced medium calls an especially strong spirit, that spirit may become violent and revolt, as you witnessed yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nRevolt? But how?\nMorgan:\nWhen a spirit enters a medium's body, she loses her will and her self steps aside. To put it another way, the spirit is borrowing the medium's body, good sir.\nPhoenix:\nBut isn't that extremely dangerous?\nMorgan:\nAn experienced medium has little problem controlling a spirit.\nPhoenix:\nBut Maya... I mean, Mystic Maya... That was her first channeling...\nMorgan:\nAnd that was why I insisted on locking the door. However, I never thought that would be calling danger upon the client himself... I am grateful that one of our heirlooms was not damaged in this horrible incident.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that would be...? (Changed from [And that is...?] in the original release)\nMorgan:\nThat folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings. (Changed from [It is that folding screen there. It is the Kurain Sacred Writings.] in the original release) Along with the Kurain Sacred Urn, they are this village's most treasured possessions. If I ever found out that something had happened to either one... Oh, the inhumanity...\nPhoenix:\n(Odd for her to be worrying about the folding screen at a time like this... I guess this isn't just some dilapidated old screen after all...)\nPearl\nPhoenix:\nSo... How is Pearl today...?\nMorgan:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMorgan:\nIn this world, Pearl is my most treasured possession. When compared to even Mystic Maya, Pearl has the spiritual power to become a Master.\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's very impressive.\nMorgan:\nUntil now, the women of the branch family have thought themselves to be inferior. .. But. Pearl is different! Her spiritual strength is so great; even greater than some of the main family! Yes, Pearl is a channeling prodigy and is the pride of the branch family!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... She's really fired up now...)\nMorgan:\nIn any case... Our world is so different from yours, perhaps it is best for you to quit, good sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Quit\"? Quit what?\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nMorgan:\n...Oh my!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nMorgan:\nThat... That is Mystic Maya's Magatama. Why would you have this in your possession!?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry!\nMorgan:\nReturn it to Mystic Maya at once!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, madam! (Why did I feel like I was being scolded by my own mother just now...?)\nFolding Screen\nMorgan:\nAh, so even someone such as yourself can take interest in something like this. This is the Kurain Channeling Technique Sacred Writings. There are 6 panels in all.\nPhoenix:\nI see... But that's not what caught my eye. You see this hole here...?\nMorgan:\nIt is an old screen, you see. It is only logical that perhaps a bug or worm of some sort is the culprit.\nPhoenix:\n(Even though this looks nothing like the eating patterns of any bug I know...)\nMaya Fey profile\nMorgan:\nI can hardly believe Mystic Maya has become like this. Directly influenced by the likes of you, and becoming caught up in a situation such as this...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry... (...Hey, hold on! How is all this MY fault!?)\nMorgan:\nI told her so many times, as I have also told Pearl, \"Do not associate with strange old men you don't know\".\nPhoenix:\n(Well, that shouldn't apply to me then, especially since I'm hardly an \"old man\" yet!!)\nTurner Grey profile\nMorgan:\nThat doctor was one of those people. Those who intend harm upon the spirits receive harm in return; it's karma at work. It seems that he was the one to take the nurse's life, wouldn't you agree?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that's possible...)\nPearl Fey profile\nMorgan:\nGood sir!\nPhoenix:\nY...Yes?\nMorgan:\nWhen did you take this picture!? This is one of those... what are they called...? Those... \"hidden camera\" pictures!\nPhoenix:\nN-No!! It's not one of those at all!!\nMorgan:\nSuch an unforgivable offense! You will hand it over to me!\nPhoenix:\nN-No! I won't! (If I ever want to talk about Pearl again, I should be much more careful...)\nMorgan Fey profile\nMorgan:\nIt shows the same face as the one I see in the mirror every day.\nPhoenix:\nAnd? Anything else?\nMorgan:\nNo. That is all.\nPhoenix:\n(Why in the world did I bother to show this to her!?)\nAny other evidence\nMorgan:\nI will be leaving shortly to meet with Mystic Maya. I simply do not have the time to look at such trivial matters.\nAny other profile\nMorgan:\nWe usually do not welcome strangers into our village as they disturb the aura here. Especially people like you, good sir.\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey, what do you mean, \"especially people like me?\"\nMorgan:\nYou selfishly make Mystic Maya help you with your work... You should be thankful I have not taken your life for such a disrespectful act.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, madam...\nMorgan:\nAnd even more importantly, remember that if anything were to happen to Pearl...\nPhoenix:\n(What is that supposed to mean!?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen:\nMorgan:\nWell, then, I do believe it is time for me to take my leave.\nPhoenix:\nAlright. Please tell Maya I said hi.\nMorgan:\nWhat was that!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, I mean, Mystic Maya.\nMorgan:\nI will tell her.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh*)\nJune 20Fey ManorWinding Way\nPhoenix:\n(Little Pearl isn't here today... Maybe she's at school?)\nJune 20Fey ManorSide Room\nIni:\nOh, hey! Like, you're that guy from yesterday... The, uh, dentist guy...\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, I'm a lawyer.\nIni:\nThat's right! Um... Mr. Smith, Esquire.\nPhoenix:\n...That's \"Wright\". Wait, I mean, you're wrong. My name is \"Wright\".\nIni:\n\"Smith\", \"Wright\"... Well, I got, like, three letters, at least.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think she gets the point...) Anyway, why are you here?\nIni:\nSo, like, I study this thing called \"parapsychology\" at this college and...\nPhoenix:\nUm, you told me about that yesterday. The sesame allergy, too. What I'd really like to know is why you're still here today?\nIni:\nOh! So, like, that's what you meant! Like, you shoulda been more, like, clear about it!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry. My bad.\nIni:\nNo, it's OK. Like, it's really...\nPhoenix:\n...\nIni:\n...?\nPhoenix:\n...That's it? Why'd you stop mid-sentence!?\nIni:\nDid I? ...So, like... what was I talking about again...?\nPhoenix:\n... (If Lotta ever wanted another \"genuine mysterious phenomenon\", it's right here.)\nExamine\nWooden bear sculpture\nPhoenix:\nIt's a decorative wooden bear sculpture. There's a plate attached to the base. \"Kurain Village - The Heart of Channeling\" What the!? It's a souvenir.\nIni:\nIsn't it cuuuuute? I, like, totally bought that!\nPhoenix:\nAh... so it's yours, huh?\nIni:\nYeah. So, like, this village is really famous for, like, channeling and bears.\nPhoenix:\nHeh. (...Wait. Famous for bears!?)\nIni:\nBut it's, like, OK. If you ever, like, see a bear, you just play dead, and they, like, leave you alone.\nPhoenix:\nI-Is that right?\nIni:\nYeah. Cause, like, fighting back is totally of no use.\nPhoenix:\n(Has she actually tried to fight one!?)\nYellow box\nPhoenix:\nHmm, now where did this box come from? I'm sure this wasn't here last night. It looks like a box for storing clothes... But it's pretty big for just clothes... It's mostly empty, but a few folded pieces of channeling costumes sit at the bottom.\nTalk\nIni Miney\nPhoenix:\nSo? Why are you still here today?\nIni:\nLike, there's so much for me to, like, study here!\nPhoenix:\nLike what?\nIni:\nLike, the medium's training, or like, how they inherit their spiritual power.\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose... This village is the real thing, after all.)\nIni:\nSo, like, I asked if I could stay here for, like, a little longer.\nPhoenix:\n(She sure seems like the care-free type, at least, on the surface...)\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nHave you heard about the murder?\nIni:\nIt's, like, totally scary.\nPhoenix:\n(...she says, with a silly smile plastered on her face...) ...So do you know anything about it that might help?\nIni:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think she has a grip on reality, let alone what's going on here.)\nThe victim\nPhoenix:\nAbout the victim, Dr. Grey...\nIni:\nI don't know who you're talking about. ...Like... Wait, I think you asked about him, like, yesterday, too...\nPhoenix:\n(That's right... Her reaction yesterday when I asked was...)\nPhoenix:\nYou and Dr. Grey knew each other, right?\nIni:\n...! I don't know any Dr. Grey!\nPhoenix:\nOh really...? Then what was all that talk about him earlier? (Changed from [That's not exactly what Dr. Grey said...] in the original release)\nIni:\nHuh!? ...Well, uh... Like, a long, long time ago... I was, like, a patient, yeah.\nPhoenix:\n(OK, she is definitely hiding something from me...)\nIni:\n...Like, is something wrong?\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nWould you take a look at this?\nIni:\nHey! It's, like, one of those little badges people in Congress all wear...\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no. I'm a lawyer. L-A-W-Y-E-R!!\nIni:\n...? Like, so is that what you are?\nMaya's Magatama\nIni:\nWow! It's a Magatama! Aww, you shouldn't have!\nPhoenix:\nIt's so totally not for you!\nIni:\nHey! Like, it's not nice to freak me out like that!\nPhoenix:\n(That should be my line...)\nMaya Fey profile\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about this girl...\nIni:\nOh, that's, like, Maya Fey. She's, like, the Master's daughter.\nPhoenix:\nYou surprise me. You knew that?\nIni:\nWell, like, I totally know everyone related to the occult. Maya is, like, an idol among spirit mediums.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya an idol? I guess stranger things have happened.)\nMorgan Fey profile\nIni:\nThat's Morgan Fey. Like, she's been totally helpful.\nPhoenix:\n(Did she just bow to the picture...?)\nIni:\nSo what about her?\nPhoenix:\nOh, nothing in particular. I just wanted to know what you knew about her.\nIni:\nUm... Well, she's, like, a really good person.\nPhoenix:\nI see.\nIni:\nLike totally.\nPhoenix:\nOK. (This is going nowhere...)\nIni Miney profile\nIni:\nUm... This face... Like, I think I've seen it somewhere before...\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? ...Y-You're joking, right?\nIni:\nHa ha, like, of course I am, silly!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, thank goodness...)\nAny other evidence\nIni:\nLike, I'm really sorry, but... And I know, like, you totally had your heart set on it, but I can't, like, take it.\nPhoenix:\n(Who said anything about giving this to you!?)\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you know about this person...?\nIni:\nI'm, like, sorry, but it's totally, like, time for my nap...\nPhoenix:\n*yawn* (Ack! She's even got ME yawning!)\nIni:\nAnd I, like, totally don't care about that person anyway...\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber, and clearing \"The victim\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Side Room:\nJune 20Fey ManorWinding Way\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAck! Y-You surprised me!\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd how are you today?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I guess she isn't open to friendly chatting... Huh? She's still holding something in her hand... ...It looks like the same thing she had yesterday...)\nTalk\nAny option\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nPearl:\nAaaah!\nPhoenix:\nH-Huh?? (If only I had something that would catch her interest. Maybe then she'd talk to me.)\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nLeads to:\n\"Oh yeah. Maya said to give this to you...\"\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nCan you take a look at this? Please?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Urk... She's really scrutinizing my face...)\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Th-That's enough already! I'm not that shifty-looking, am I!?)\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah. Maya said to give this to you...\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! I'm in trouble now!! If Morgan sees us like this, I'll be the next one they're channeling...)\nPearl:\nTh-That's... That's Mystic Maya's...\nPhoenix:\n...Huh!? (Sh-She actually spoke!)\nPearl:\nWho are you...?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm Phoenix Wright. I, uh, worked with Maya...\nPearl:\n...Y-You worked with Mystic Maya...? You... You're Mr. Nick, right?\nPhoenix:\n...Uh, excuse me? (I bet I know who she picked \"Nick\" up from...)\nPearl:\nI know who you are. You're... You're Mystic Maya's... \"special someone\"...\nPhoenix:\nWH-WH-WH-WHAT!?\nPearl:\nSo then... Of course! You're going to help Mystic Maya, aren't you? That's what you're going to do, right?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, yeah... I will...\nPearl:\nOh wow... It's like a beautiful fairy tale! That earnest look shining brightly in your eyes... It must be true love...\nPhoenix:\n...Wh-What!? (Why am I being boiled into a bright red lobster by this little kid!?)\nPearl:\nI'm so jealous of Mystic Maya! Ah, what a wonderful relationship...\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait... I... uhh... I mean... We aren't... Things aren't like...\nPearl:\nHee hee, I can tell you're a good person. Alright, Mr. Nick! I may be small, but I'm going to help you in any way I can!\nTalk\nPearl\nPhoenix:\nPearl, are you friends with Maya?\nPearl:\nI feel very grateful to be friends with her... She's so great. I want to be like Mystic Maya when I grow up. I really look up to her.\nPhoenix:\nWow, I had no idea Maya was so... revered.\nPearl:\nUsually when people don't use Mystic Maya's title, I get mad.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, sorry.\nPearl:\nBut if it's you, Mr. Nick, then it's OK. Because... Because... you're \"special\" to her.\nPhoenix:\n(Where in the world did she get an idea like that??)\nPearl:\nBy the way... this may be rude, but which channeling school are you from?\nPhoenix:\nWhich channeling school?\nPearl:\nYes. For example, I study the Kurain technique.\nPhoenix:\n... Ah, I get it! No, no, no. I'm a lawyer. A lawyer.\nPearl:\n...Law...yer?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nPearl:\n...Is that related to spirit mediums in any way...?\nPhoenix:\n(Um... None that I know of...) Wait, are you telling me you don't know what a lawyer is?\nPearl:\nI'm sorry, but I have no idea.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya did say Pearl doesn't know much about the outside world...)\nThe item in your hand\nPhoenix:\nSo what's that you've got there, Pearl?\nPearl:\nOh, this? I found it yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nPearl:\nIf you want it, I can give it to you.\nAccept it\nLeads to:\n\"Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\"\nDon't accept it\nPhoenix:\nI can't take something this important from you, Pearl.\nPearl:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\n(But I'm sure I've seen that key somewhere before... ...and it might be an important clue later on...)\nLeads to:\n\"Alright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\"\nPhoenix:\nAlright, well, if you really want to give it to me...\nPearl:\nHee hee. You look like a child at a toy store, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(...She not only speaks in a refined manner, but laughs in one, too!)\nBlack Key added to the Court Record.\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nPhoenix:\nSo this is...\nPearl:\nThat is Mystic Maya's Magatama. It's one of the most important heirlooms of Kurain Village. Please make sure to take good care of it.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I will. (Is it really OK for me to have such a priceless object?)\nFolding Screen\nPearl:\nAre you interested in Kurain's traditional things too, Mr. Nick? The Kurain Sacred Writings are on this folding screen.\nPhoenix:\nOh? Is that what's written on it? Actually, what caught my eye was this \"hole\" in it...\nPearl:\nIt's a very old screen, so I think that maybe bugs made it by eating through it.\nPhoenix:\n(...It sure doesn't look like something bugs can make...)\nBlack Key\nPhoenix:\nAbout this key...\nPearl:\nI found it while I was playing in the garden yesterday.\nPhoenix:\nI've seen it before too, you know?\nPearl:\n...? Really?\nMaya Fey profile\nPearl:\nI look up to Mystic Maya a lot. She's my role model. She's so smart, and pretty, and kind, and loving. She's always cheerful, never gets sick, isn't picky, and has good sleeping habits. She always wakes up before me, and always eats breakfast before me too. And she has you; such a wonderful person with whom she can share a lo-\nPhoenix:\nAck! OK, OK! I get the idea! (She really thinks the world of Maya, doesn't she?)\nPearl Fey profile\nPearl:\nTo tell you the truth, I really want to grow my hair out, just like Mystic Maya. But my mother won't let me.\nPhoenix:\nYour hair now suits you quite well, though, I think.\nPearl:\nR-Really? Th-Thank you! *fidget, fidget*\nPhoenix:\n*fidget, fidget*\nMorgan Fey profile\nPearl:\nOh, it's my mother! She takes really good care of me and loves me very much. She says I'm the \"pride of the branch family\"... But I don't know what that means.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Branch family\"... That concept is probably still too hard for little Pearl...)\nAny other evidence\nPearl:\nI'm sure it is helpful to you in some way, but I'm still in training, so I don't know anything about it. I'm really, deeply sorry.\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no, it's OK. I shouldn't have shown you something so trivial anyway. I'm very sorry. (This feels so weird, talking to a kid like this...)\nAny other profile\nPearl:\nHmm, I'm sorry I don't know who this person is.\nPhoenix:\nI guess that makes sense... You've never left Kurain village, after all.\nPearl:\nI'm really sorry, Mr. Nick. I just don't really know anyone outside the village.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Pearls? I can call you that, right? You're too cute to just call you Pearl.\nPearl:\nSure, Mr. Nick... Umm... Are you sure it's OK for me to have this Magatama?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it's OK. I was told to give it to you.\nPearl:\nBut, I can't accept something like this! ...All I really should do is charge this Magatama with spiritual energy...\nPhoenix:\nSpiritual energy?\nPearl:\nPlease take this. I'm sure it will be helpful.\nPhoenix:\n...What do you mean?\nPearl:\nIt will let you see people's secrets.\nPhoenix:\nSee people's... secrets...?\nPearl:\nYes. ...If it's alright with you, I would like to accompany you for a little while. I can explain the Magatama's power to you when we meet someone hiding a secret.\nJune 20Fey ManorMeditation Room\nGumshoe:\nHey, it's you, pal! So you're going to be her lawyer, I bet.\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nGumshoe:\nOh... I really feel bad for you, pal. Just this once, I wish I could be on your side.\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but I shouldn't be saying that kind of stuff to you. Hey! You're a cute kid.\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nHa ha ha. I'm not scary. Honest!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, I never knew Gumshoe liked kids...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol...\nPhoenix:\nD-Detective Gumshoe!! What are you doing showing her something that dangerous!\nGumshoe:\nOh, sorry...\nTalk\nMaya's guilt\nPhoenix:\nWhat about Maya and the charges against her?\nGumshoe:\nI don't think you can win, pal. If you're talking about proof, we've got a few pieces.\nPhoenix:\nYou've got proof...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal. That puffy-haired photographer's going to testify tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\n(He must be talking about Lotta. Actually... speaking of Lotta...)\nLotta:\nI took some hot pictures earlier!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nLotta:\nRemember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside!\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta's \"hot pictures\"... I wonder what her camera captured...?)\nGumshoe:\n...Besides, you must've realized by now, pal. There's no way anyone other than Maya Fey could've done it.\nPhoenix:\n(...!)\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(What am I supposed to say to Pearls now...?)\nThe victim\nPhoenix:\nAbout Dr. Grey...\nGumshoe:\nThe victim wasn't super famous, but people still knew who he was. His face was all over those tabloid shows last year.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know.\nGumshoe:\nI was looking through some newspapers from last year, and... ... Huh? I could've sworn I had... I cut an article out, but I guess I must've lost it...\nPhoenix:\n(He's searching through his pockets... And boy, are those big...)\nGumshoe:\nHmm... It looked really interesting, too. Hey, do you have a copy, pal?\nPhoenix:\n(A copy of that article...? I think Dr. Grey might have brought a copy to the office when he came by...)\nTomorrow's trial\nPhoenix:\nAbout Maya's trial tomorrow...\nGumshoe:\nI've got two pieces of news for you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nTwo?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. \"Bad news\" and \"even worse news.\" So which do you want to hear first?\nPhoenix:\n...I don't really care... It doesn't change the fact that I'm not going to like it.\nGumshoe:\nAlright, pal. Well, the prosecutor for the trial is Prosecutor von Karma.\nPhoenix:\nWHAT!? Von Karma!?\nPhoenix:\n(Manfred von Karma... He was an awe-inspiring veteran prosecutor. He never lost a case in the 40 years of his career, and he raised a fearsome disciple. The horrible aftertaste of the evil he force-fed me is something I'll never forget.)\nPhoenix:\n... Wait a sec. But didn't Von Karma stand trial and...\nGumshoe:\nThat's where the other piece of bad news comes in... The Von Karma you're facing tomorrow is actually his successor...\nPhoenix:\nSuccessor...?\nSuccessor (appears after \"Tomorrow's trial\")\nPhoenix:\nSo, um... Who is this \"successor\" to Von Karma?\nGumshoe:\nLiterally, pal, it's Prosecutor von Karma's kid. His kid became a prosecutor real young... like 13, and hasn't lost a trial since. That's what they call a \"prodigy,\" pal.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Kid, huh... ... W-W-Wait a sec! Th-Th-Thirteen!? The kid became a prosecutor at the age of THIRTEEN!? I mean, a prodigy like that... I would have heard something about...\nGumshoe:\nOh, no, no. The kid was born and raised in Germany, pal. That country's got a lot of stuff and is a great place to develop a person's talents.\nPhoenix:\n(Germany, huh? That's probably why I've never heard of this person. Ugh... Still, all it takes is someone mentioning the name \"Von Karma\", and I get terrible flashbacks to that case. Stop it! Get a grip on yourself, Phoenix! (Changed from [Stop it! Get over it, Phoenix!] in the original release) None of that matters anymore... now that he's gone... (Changed from [That person is already gone...] in the original release))\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nHey, look. It's my attorney's badge.\nGumshoe:\nHa ha. Good one, pal. You're always good for a laugh with your little badge. But a real man... A real man has a police badge.\nPearl:\nUh, um... Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nI was wondering if I could see it, too?\nPhoenix:\nAh, no, it's OK. It's not that important anyway.\nMaya's Magatama\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this...?\nGumshoe:\nHey, that's a pretty nice-looking brooch! You should stop wearing that ugly old attorney's badge, and start wearing that, pal.\nPearl:\nHee, hee. That detective is so nice! Aren't you happy, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Happy?... About what?)\nNewspaper Clipping 1\nPhoenix:\nUm, Dr. Grey brought this over to my office the other day, and...\nGumshoe:\nHey! It's that news story! The one about the malpractice suit!\nPhoenix:\nFourteen patients died and it caused a huge stink.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but that's not all, pal. Things only got worse after that.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the car accident the nurse died in?\nGumshoe:\n...Hmm... Oh, here we go. I brought my own clipping with me today. Here, pal, this is for you.\nPhoenix:\nAlright. Thanks.\nNewspaper Clipping 2 added to the Court Record.\nNewspaper Clipping 1 (subsequent times)\nGumshoe:\nThe nurse that killed the patients ended up getting killed in an accident. Dr. Grey wound up on a lot of tabloid shows because of that. Now, there was a smart man. I'm sure that was a great way to advertise for his clinic.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh, huh. Scaring people off is always the best way to get more patients.)\nBlack Key\nPhoenix:\nSo about this key...\nGumshoe:\nHey, is that your house key or something, pal?\nPhoenix:\nCome on, does this look like a house key to you?\nGumshoe:\nThen what's it for?\nPhoenix:\nIt's... ... (Hmm, actually, I should probably keep that a secret...) It's my bicycle key.\nGumshoe:\nOh. Nothing special, huh?\nMaya Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nI'm sorry things had to turn out this way, pal.\nPhoenix:\nIt's too early to give up! No one's proven her guilty of anything, yet!\nGumshoe:\nLook, even if there were a zillion of you, pal, this is a case you... *sigh*\nPhoenix:\n(Now why is he sighing?)\nPearl Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nOh, so that's little Pearl.\nPhoenix:\nDo you know her?\nGumshoe:\nOnly that Ms. Fey was looking for her earlier. Something about being worried that she'll end up talking to the weird guy. So, you have any idea who this \"weird guy\" is, pal?\nPhoenix:\n...Nope. Not a clue.\nMorgan Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nThat's Maya's aunt, right? I got to eat one of her giant strawberry desserts earlier. It was really good!\nPhoenix:\n(Aw, I didn't get to eat one yet...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nGumshoe:\nBoy do I look scary in this picture. I guess if I want people to stop thinking cops are scary, I have to change myself. Gotta smile, gotta smile!\nPhoenix:\n(There's that classic Gumshoe goofy smile again...)\nAny other evidence\nGumshoe:\nOoh, I'd better shut my mouth.\nPhoenix:\nUh, what?\nGumshoe:\nI'm not gonna give you any information about evidence, pal.\nPhoenix:\nOh.\nAny other profile\nGumshoe:\nI don't have anything to tell you about this one, pal.\nPhoenix:\nYou don't have to be so mean about it.\nGumshoe:\nNot. A. Word.\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nH-H-Hey! Don't look at me like that!\nPhoenix:\n(That girl has one intense stare... *gulp*)\nJune 20Fey ManorSide Room\nPhoenix:\nHello again. We seem to be seeing a lot of each other today.\nIni:\nAww, she's, like, tooootally cute! Is she, like, your daughter?\nPhoenix:\nW-What!? NO! (How old do you think I am!?)\nTalk\nThe victim\nPhoenix:\nI want to ask you about the victim, Dr. Grey.\nIni:\nI, like, totally don't know him.\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nPhoenix:\nAaack! What is that!?\nIni:\n...?\nPearl:\nYou can see it, can't you, Mr. Nick? You can see the \"lock\" on that person's heart.\nPhoenix:\nHuh, what...?\nPearl:\nThis is the power of the Magatama. Only you can see these \"Psyche-Locks\", Mr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(Psyche-Locks, huh...)\nPearl:\nThe more someone wants to hide their secret, the more locks you will see. If it's only one, I think you can easily unlock it.\nPhoenix:\n\"Unlock\"...? But how?\nPearl:\nPlease use Mystic Maya's Magatama on this person, and let's remove the lock.\nPhoenix:\n(I have no idea what she's talking about, but... Guess I'll give it a try.)\nPearl:\nYou must be careful, though, Mr. Nick. If you make a mistake, it will hurt you. If you don't think you have the proof you need, you must have the courage to stop.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I've got to start somewhere. Let's give this Psyche-Lock thing a try.)\nThe victim (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIim going to ask you again. Did you know Dr. Grey?\nIni:\nI totally don't know that guy. Like, you're totally more presistent than a roach!\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nPhoenix:\n(This girl is hiding something! I'm sure of it! I guess I have no choice but to remove this lock. Alright, so first, I have to use Maya's Magatama...)\nThe victim (after breaking Psyche-Lock)\nLeads to:\n\"Please, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey.\"\nPresent\nMaya's Magatama\nPhoenix:\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\n-- The Victim --\nPhoenix:\nIni Miney. I believe you do know who Dr. Grey is!\nIni:\nI told you! Like, how many times do I, like, have to repeat myself? If you're, like, so totally sure, then where's, like, your proof?\nPhoenix:\nWhile it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person, I do believe you might have at least, indirectly known of him.\nIni:\nLike, what do you mean, like, \"indirectly\"...?\nPhoenix:\n(I should try to show that the possibility existed for now...) (Hmm, so, something that shows a possible connection between Ini and Dr. Grey...)\nPresent Newspaper Clipping 2\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Take a look at this newspaper clipping.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere is your proof!\nIni:\nLike, what is that...?\nPhoenix:\nOuch... I guess it doesn't have anything to do with it, huh? (Pearls did warn me... \"If you make a mistake, it will hurt you,\" she said. If I don't have enough evidence, I should probably \"stop\". I should take another look at the Court Record and think it through one more time.)\nLeads back to:\n\"While it may be possible that you never actually met Dr. Grey in person,\"\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this newspaper clipping.\nIni:\nLike, what is it? ... A story about an accident?\nPhoenix:\nPlease read the victim's name.\nIni:\nUm...\"Mimi Miney\"...\nPhoenix:\n\"Miney\" is a pretty rare last name, wouldn't you say? Ms. Mimi Miney wouldn't happen to be a relative of yours, would she?\nIni:\n...! So you noticed. Sh-She was my older sister.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry about your loss... Your sister... Was she a nurse... Perhaps at Dr. Grey's surgical clinic?\nIni:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nGrey Surgical Clinic... I don't think I need to tell you that the clinic was run by the victim, Dr. Turner Grey. Which is how you knew of Dr. Grey; you knew him through your sister!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nPhoenix:\nPlease, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey.\nIni:\nMy... My sister's name was Mimi Miney. She was, like, a nurse at Dr. Grey's clinic.\nPhoenix:\n(That's what I thought...)\nIni:\nI heard that, like, Dr. Grey was really tough on people. Like, a total slave driver. My sis was, like, always coming home totally wiped out 'cause she was overworked.\nPhoenix:\nWiped out? So is that why she fell asleep at the wheel?\nIni:\nThat guy, like, drove my sis so hard, so, like, that's why the accident happened.\nPhoenix:\nThe one where 14 patients died from malpractice?\nIni:\nYeah, like, I think that was the doctor's fault, too. My sis was pushed by, like, everyone's expectations and, like, her duties and stuff. And that pushed her to her death.\nPhoenix:\nOh... I'm sorry...\nIni:\nSo, like, are we done? I've, like, already told my story to, like, everyone...\nPearl:\nDo you understand now, Mr. Nick? This is how a Psyche-Lock works.\nPhoenix:\n...Well, I don't plan to pry into people's hearts unless I absolutely need to...\nPearl:\nThe lock this time was pretty easy, but... you might meet people who aren't as willing to give in later on. If you don't have enough proof, be careful and know when to stop trying.\nAfter clearing \"Successor\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Meditation Room and clearing \"The victim\" Talk option upon breaking Psyche-Lock in Fey Manor - Side Room:\nJune 20Kurain Village\nPearl:\nMr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHmm? What's wrong?\nPearl:\nI have never left Kurain Village.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really? Wow, that's, um, pretty amazing...\nPearl:\nYou are going to meet with Mystic Maya... aren't you? Please tell her I said hi.\nPhoenix:\nHey, wait! (She ran off... Again. Well, I know Ini's secret now, but... I still don't have any idea how I'm going to save Maya. I don't even know if I should go in there with a smile or a straight face... *sigh*)\nJune 20Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(What am I supposed to do!? I'm almost out of time! Can I really do anything? Can I really save her...?)\n???:\nSorry to keep you waiting.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? Must be Maya...)\n???:\nIt's been a long time, hasn't it, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\n...! (That voice...) M-Mia!\nMia:\nEven without me being here, it looks like you've learned to stand on your own.\nPhoenix:\n(Mia... She's Maya's older sister, and my mentor. She was a top-notch defense lawyer, but a certain case forced her into \"retirement\". But... whenever I'm in trouble, she comes to help, just like this. Her spirit comes back from the other world and borrows Maya's body for a bit...)\nMia:\nPhoenix, you can't make that kind of face in front of your client.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nMia:\nA lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets, and especially when it's bad.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nYou can't smile at the end if you haven't been smiling the whole way there. In any case, the face you're making now is no face to show a client, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nB-But!\nMia:\nSo, tell me all about it. I'm going to guess that my sister is in a lot of trouble again...\nPhoenix:\n(I told her everything about what had happened in the last two days. Mia closed her eyes, deep in thought, while she listened...)\nMia:\n...I see...\nPhoenix:\nMia... What am I supposed to do?\nMia:\n... It's pretty clear what a good lawyer does in this situation.\nPhoenix:\nA-And that is!? Tell me, please!\nMia:\nBelieve in your convictions. And fight for the complete acquittal of your client.\nTalk\nNot guilty\nPhoenix:\nYou think Maya's not guilty!? How can you be so sure!?\nMia:\nI know she is. And I'll give you a hint as to why.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nMia:\nMediums can't have dreams.\nPhoenix:\nCan't have \"dreams\"...?\nMia:\nFrom what you told me, it sounds like Maya was having a dream while channeling.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... She said she dream that she had died and had been buried in the ground.\nMia:\nBut that is impossible. You've heard it from her, I'm sure. When a medium channels, her own spirit disappears. Which means that it's impossible for her to dream during that time.\nPhoenix:\n...! Then... What does this mean!?\nMia:\nI think it's safe to bet that Maya was set-up.\nPhoenix:\nA set-up!?\nMia:\nIt's up to you to blow the lid on this case tomorrow and show how she was set-up.\nEvidence?\nPhoenix:\nHow am I supposed to prove her innocence when I have nothing to go on!?\nMia:\nIf you're looking for a clue, it's already in your hands.\nPhoenix:\nI-It is!?\nMia:\nJust as it sounds, Phoenix, you already hold the \"key\".\nPhoenix:\n(R-Really...?)\nMia:\nCome on, show me the \"key\" to this case.\nPhoenix:\n(The \"key\", huh? Alright, I'll show it to her; the \"key\" I hold.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\n*chuckle* Wow, this badge brings back a lot of memories, doesn't it...? I would love to stand with you at the defense table one more time.\nPhoenix:\n(Mia...)\nMaya's Magatama\nMia:\nThis is... Maya's Magatama, isn't it? Why do you have it...?\nPhoenix:\nMaya gave it to me, but...\nMia:\nI see... ... This is something very important to me. Take good care of it, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(She looks at it with such a soft look in her eyes...)\nBlack Key\nPhoenix:\nMia, have you seen this key before?\nMia:\nAhh, the key... It's literally, the key to understanding everything that's happened in this case.\nPhoenix:\nThis key?\nMia:\nPhoenix, listen. Right now, that key is sitting in your hand. However, it shouldn't be. ... It contradicts the \"facts\".\nPhoenix:\n(What does she mean...?)\nMia:\nI'm certain this key will be the piece of evidence that makes your case tomorrow.\nMaya Fey profile\nMia:\nI can't see Maya... when I'm in her body like this... But I can tell. She's very lonely and sad. Take good care of her, will you, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\nI-I will...\nPearl Fey profile\nMia:\nPearly! She's really grown up... I left Kurain Village a long time ago. She probably doesn't remember a thing about me by now...\nMorgan Fey profile\nMia:\nI'm afraid I might have caused Aunt Morgan a lot of stress. When I left Kurain, I left Maya in my aunt's care. And now something like this happens...\nDick Gumshoe profile\nMia:\nI've seen this man somewhere before... He had a strange name... and I'm almost sure I've questioned him before. I remember him making a show of confidence at first, but after five minutes, he breaks down and... ...you end up feeling bad for the poor guy...\nMia Fey profile\nMia:\nThat's right. I'm already dead. But I feel very grateful to have been born a Fey... so I can talk with you like this...\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nCould you take a look at this?\nMia:\n...Do you have anything more useful? There's no time left. Try to show me something that will help you in tomorrow's trial.\nAny other profile\nMia:\nI'm sorry, but I don't remember who that is...\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Black Key:\nMia:\n... ... You already know everything you need to know. You know what the \"key\" to this case is... That is enough...\nPhoenix:\nBut... But! How can I win tomorrow without knowing who the real murderer is!? Who... Who could have...?\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't know it at the time, (Changed from [At the time, I didn't know,] in the original release) but this day was going to end with a turn for the surprising...)\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nM-Mia!? Wh-What...!?\nMia:\nWhat's wrong?\nPhoenix:\n(That's right. Only I can see the Psyche-Locks... Which means... Mia must know something about the real murderer! But for this to be something that she would hide under lock and key from even me... What in the world is going on!?)\nTo be continued.\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...)\nToo many errors during Magatama session\n...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again...\nPhoenix:\n(Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)",

The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch.Judge:\nV-Very well... What is the defense's position?Phoenix:\nYour Honor.Judge:\nDoes the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"?Phoenix:\n...Yes.von Karma:\nFoolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time.Phoenix:\n(\"Justified self-defense\"...

If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness.Phoenix:\n(She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.)von Karma:\nWitness, your name and occupation?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!!von Karma:\nGet to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room.Judge:\nWhat were they doing in there?Gumshoe:\nUm... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir.Judge:\nCh-Channeling a spirit??Phoenix:\n(That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release)Gumshoe:\n*ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room.Judge:\nAh, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over.Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Judge:\nSo, how was the victim killed?Gumshoe:\nI was about to get to that...von Karma:\nStop wasting my time, then.Witness Testimony-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Judge:\nHmm...

Continue with your testimony. That, just now, was a fluke. Nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nH-How can you say something like that!? This is a huge oversight!\nJudge:\nWhile I agree it is a mistake on the part of the police, what Prosecutor von Karma has said is true. The evidence still stands. If you do not find a more definitive problem with the evidence, then...\nPhoenix:\nNo way!!\nJudge:\nDetective Gumshoe, please continue with your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nLet it go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...)

We must've thought it was just a tear in the seam...\nPhoenix:\nMissing the hole is not what I'm asking you about. I'm talking about the hole itself! The smell of gunpowder  clearly gives away that... it is a bullet hole!\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nAs if little things like that matter.\nPhoenix:\nBut they do.\nvon Karma:\nA \"bullet hole\" in the sleeve, blood splatter all over the costume... Neither of these things can change the fact the defendant killed the victim.\nPhoenix:\n(...Grr... I know there's something more to that costume.)\nvon Karma:\nCome now Detective.

No one ever told me!\nJudge:\nA hole that smells of gunpowder...\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I've found the \"hole\" I was looking for!) Your Honor, the only logical conclusion you can make is that it must be a bullet hole!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! This is a very grave matter. It's best we correct the Court Record first before anything else.\nMaya's Costume updated in the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nSorry about that. I guess we messed up, sir.\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...! (I-Is she actually... smiling!? What else is she hiding!?)\nvon Karma:\nPull yourself together, Detective. That tiny \"hole\" doesn't change a thing. The strength of the evidence still holds. Continue with your testimony. That, just now, was a fluke. Nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nH-How can you say something like that!? This is a huge oversight!\nJudge:\nWhile I agree it is a mistake on the part of the police, what Prosecutor von Karma has said is true. The evidence still stands. If you do not find a more definitive problem with the evidence, then...\nPhoenix:\nNo way!!\nJudge:\nDetective Gumshoe, please continue with your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nLet it go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...)

I'll give you that the blood spatter is from the victim, but... what is this hole in the sleeve?\nGumshoe:\nUm... Sorry, pal. We must've thought it was just a tear in the seam...\nPhoenix:\nMissing the hole is not what I'm asking you about. I'm talking about the hole itself! The smell of gunpowder  clearly gives away that... it is a bullet hole!\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nAs if little things like that matter.\nPhoenix:\nBut they do.\nvon Karma:\nA \"bullet hole\" in the sleeve, blood splatter all over the costume... Neither of these things can change the fact the defendant killed the victim.\nPhoenix:\n(...Grr... I know there's something more to that costume.)\nvon Karma:\nCome now Detective. You're wasting precious time.\nGumshoe:\n... Yes, sir.Gumshoe:\nThe defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe wasn't \"fighting back\"? How do you know if he was or wasn't!?\nGumshoe:\nWe could find no evidence that the victim put up any sort of struggle, pal.\nJudge:\nHmm... So did the murderer have a fight with the victim, or not?

Heh, having you call me by my full name is kind of a weird feeling...Phoenix:\nYou said that my client killed \"a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.\"Gumshoe:\nYeah, I did.Phoenix:\nThen what, may I ask, is the bullet hole you police overlooked supposed to mean!?Gumshoe:\nEh, um... What does it mean?Phoenix:\nI'll tell you what it means. It means that the victim had fired off a shot. Is this what it means to \"not fight back\"?Gumshoe:\nA-Ah!

However, that is only grounds enough to support a \"justified self-defense\" plea.Judge:\nThat is correct.von Karma:\nBut I'm sure you remember, Your Honor, what the defense clearly said.

The defense has yet to prove anything at all!Phoenix:\nNooooo!!Judge:\nW-Well...

With wishy-washy thinking like that, anyone can explain anything away!Phoenix:\nThen I implore you to disprove my line of thinking.von Karma:\nLet's see... In the middle of their fight, the victim pushed the defendant away. And it was then, when they were separated, that he fired! How was that?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nAs if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that!von Karma:\n...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself.

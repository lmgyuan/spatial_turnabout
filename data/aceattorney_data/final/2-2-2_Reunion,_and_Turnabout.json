  "previousContext": "That was... no accident... I was drugged... with sleeping pills... I was murdered... by that person... That's why... I took... my revenge... It's only fair... Isn't it... ...Ini?\nMaya:\nI finally get to see you again, and...\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault. You didn't do it.\nMaya:\nNo, I... I did it... I killed that person.\nPhoenix:\nBut that wasn't you.\nMaya:\nIt doesn't matter. It might as well have been me.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe something like this happened...The events of that gloomy, rainy afternoon that started this whole mess...keep playing through my mind...)\nEpisode 2Reunion, and Turnabout\nJune 16, 3:34 PMWright & Co. Law Offices\n???:\nWhat depressing rain... Do you understand how depressed that makes me!? Do you!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, I guess...\n???:\nBut actually, more than being depressed, I'm angry. Angry at that weather girl on TV. \"I think our little rainy spell will take a break with a day of sun!\"...is what that girl said! I'd stake my life on it!\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's the weather...\n???:\nBut that's why I didn't bother to bring an umbrella today. What nerve, calling herself a weather girl! She's going to hear about my $1500 suit!\nPhoenix:\nUm... About your case... Unless you're planning on suing the weather girl...?\n???:\n... I'm sorry. I thought that before we got down to business, we could have some friendly chatter. My name is Dr. Turner Grey. I'm a surgeon.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me never to end up under his knife...)\nGrey:\nI'm here today because of this incident.\nPhoenix:\n\"Malpractice at Grey Surgical Clinic. Fourteen In-Patients Lose Their Lives!\" ...Oh. You're... the doctor at...?\nGrey:\nIt's really quite upsetting. Did you hear me!? UPSETTING!\nPhoenix:\nYes, yes, I heard you. I agree, it's quite upsetting, Dr. Grey.\nGrey:\nThe one that screwed up was that nurse! It was her that got the medications mixed up and killed those 14 patients! And yet! Now listen good! And yet! That nurse had the nerve to go and die before admitting to her wrongdoing! She didn't even offer any sort of explanation to me! And this is the kicker! She up and has herself a grand ol' accident and crashed her car! Smash! Crunch! Instantly transforming her car into the accordion model!\nPhoenix:\n(That's right... About a year ago, all the tabloid shows were talking about it. Fourteen victims of medical malpractice and the nurse's mysterious fatal accident. There were rumors that Dr. Grey had actually caused that crash. People said it was to forever hide the person responsible for the malpractice incident.)\nGrey:\nWhy would I...? Now, I'm just going to say this once -- Why on Earth would I want to kill that nurse? She's the one who killed those 14 patients! Not me!\nPhoenix:\nI think you need to take a deep breath, doctor, and focus... More to the point, this case is over a year old. Why bring it up now...?\nGrey:\nThat's simple! Because the situation is slipping out of my grasp. This just won't do. My clinic isn't seeing nearly as many patients nowadays. Do you understand what that means!? It means they're not coming to my clinic!\nPhoenix:\n(You don't say...? If it were me, I don't think I'd want to go either.) So... what would you like me to do about it...?\nGrey:\nI want you to help me prove I'm innocent.\nPhoenix:\nUm, you do realize I'm a lawyer, not a private investigator, right?\nGrey:\nNo, this is something only you can do.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nGrey:\nMaya Fey. You know this girl, correct?\nPhoenix:\n...! (Maya! Why would he know her name...!?)\nGrey:\nI heard you were working under her for a little while.\nPhoenix:\nWell, yes... I mean... Hey, wait a second here! I worked UNDER her!?\nGrey:\nYes. Am I wrong? She told me, so I'm not quite sure if...\nPhoenix:\nWell, we worked a few trials together. But she went back to her hometown to undergo more training.\nGrey:\nAh, yes, I heard. It must be lonely for you.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!? Wait... I'm not...!\nGrey:\nShe must be an extraordinary girl to handle such rigid training.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGrey:\nI have an acquaintance who knows a lot about these mystical sorts of things. She's the one who introduced me to Ms. Fey.\nPhoenix:\n(Is Maya... really that famous...?)\nGrey:\nAnd I've already set up an appointment.\nPhoenix:\nFor what?\nGrey:\nWhat else!? A channeling! I'm going to have her call the spirit of that nurse that went and got herself killed!\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh. (Maya... I wonder what she's up to right now...)\nMaya:\nWe, the women of the Fey clan have always been spirit mediums. (Changed from [We, the women of the Fey family, have always been spirit mediums.] in the original release) It's because the power to communicate with spirits flows strongly through us.\nPhoenix:\n(That's what she told me... I guess she's learned to accept her responsibilities and become an adult...)\nGrey:\nNot counting training, this will be her first time channeling a spirit, so she gave me one condition before accepting my request.\nPhoenix:\nA condition...?\nGrey:\nThe condition is you, Mr. Wright. She said that she wouldn't do the channeling without first seeing you again.\nPhoenix:\nMe...?\nGrey:\nAnd that is why I've searched you out! You want to see her too, don't you!?\nPhoenix:\n(And so... that is how I ended up visiting Maya's hometown with the doctor...)\nJune 19, 1:25 PMKurain Village\nPhoenix:\n(So this is Kurain Village; Maya's hometown.)\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\nW-Why, hello there.\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\nHmm... What an odd little girl.\n???:\nHey! Wait up, Pearly!!\nPhoenix:\n(Hm? Someone else is coming this way...)\n???:\nNiiiiiiiick!\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya. How are you...? It's good to see you again.\nMaya:\nWow, I didn't think you'd really show up!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not that big a deal. You made it sound like you were soooo far away.\nMaya:\nWell, maybe I exaggerated... just a little.\nPhoenix:\nIt was only 2 hours by train. If I had known you were this close, I'd have visited more.\nMaya:\nNo! You're not allowed. I already decided, you know. Until I become an adult, I have to work hard and be strong by myself...\nPhoenix:\nOh... well... Anyway, congratulations. I'm glad to hear training is going well for you.\nMaya:\nHeh, heh...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\nWell, Nick, I've got to get going. It's about time for the channeling to start.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Oh, yeah...\nMaya:\nI'm doing the channeling in my house, so come on in, OK? After I'm done, we can grill up some juicy burgers!\nPhoenix:\nAlright. Good luck, Maya.\nMaya:\nThanks!\nPhoenix:\n(Well... At least she's still the same perky Maya.)\nJune 19Fey ManorMeditation Room\nGrey:\nAh, Mr. Wright. I'm so glad you showed.\nPhoenix:\nSome nice weather we're having today. Aren't you happy?\nGrey:\nNo, not at all. That stupid weather girl made the wrong call again. \"It will rain cats and dogs today!\" she said with a straight face. I can't believe they allow such misguided reports on the public airwaves!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like talking about the weather with this guy is just asking for punishment...)\nGrey:\n...But anyway, this is a splendid manor.\nPhoenix:\n(No argument there... It's hard to believe that this is Maya's house, though...)\nGrey:\nI was given a guidemap to this building. Here, Mr. Wright. I have a copy for you too.\nGuidemap added to the Court Record.\nJune 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... It's such a strange atmosphere in here... These flickering lights... I guess they're candles...)\n???:\nGood sir! Who might you be...?\nPhoenix:\nAaah! I-I'm, uh, my name is Phoenix Wright...\n???:\nOh... You must be that good sir...\nPhoenix:\n(\"Good sir\"...? Is she talking about me?)\n???:\nYou are a lawyer, are you not, good sir? I have heard much about you from Mystic Maya.\nPhoenix:\nIs that so? (\"Mystic\" Maya...?)\n???:\nI am Mystic Maya's aunt, Morgan Fey.\nPhoenix:\nN-Nice to meet you.\nMorgan:\nAh, I had wanted to speak with you about a certain incident, good sir. It would seem that perhaps you ask too much of Mystic Maya in performing your duties. Most unbecoming, I'm afraid.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMorgan:\nDon't tell me you have already forgotten? That was it not for Mystic Maya and her assistance, you would surely not have won...\nPhoenix:\n(First a girl that runs away, and now an old lady who says I stink at doing my job... When did I become the poster boy for \"How Not to Make a First Impression\"...?)\nMorgan:\nThe past is the past though. Let us speak of the present now.\nPhoenix:\n...Ah, thank you...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMorgan:\n... Oh, yes. I wonder if you have yet to meet Pearl, good sir.\nPhoenix:\nPearl?\nMorgan:\nShe is an adorable, angelic young girl.\nPhoenix:\nOh, that odd...\nMorgan:\nShe is my daughter. Now then, what was it you were about to say...?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What a cute daughter you have... Ahaha...\nMorgan:\nA pure heart that knows not of the evils in this world is a powerful thing, good sir. Please refrain from affiliating with her, I request.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it's not like I had the chance to anyway...)\nMorgan:\nI must insist and stress that you not let it occur.\nPhoenix:\nOkay, okay, I get it!\nJune 19Fey ManorWinding Way\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. This garden is really breath-taking. Someone put a lot of love into it. What is that over there...? ...Is that an incinerator? It looks a little out of place in a garden like this...)\nJune 19Fey ManorSide Room\nPhoenix:\n(So this is... the Side Room. Looks like it's more of a break room. There is bedding spread out on the floor. It looks like someone's sleeping in one. I shouldn't disturb them...)\nWinding Way (after visiting Side Room and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber)\n???:\nHey! You! Hold on, now! This gal's got a few questions to ask!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I'm sure I've heard that southern accent somewhere before...)\n???:\nOh, well I'll be! It's Mr. Phoenix Wright! How ya been!? Haven't seen you in, what, a year!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... You... are... uh...\nLotta:\nOh, that's right! This ain't no time to be wastin' time! The channeling's about to get started!\nPhoenix:\nIs it that time already!?\nLotta:\nWe all should hurry up and get to the Meditation Room. ...What are you waiting around for!? Come on!\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta Hart, huh? I've been judging her harshly because of that case, but, I guess looking back, we had some good times, too...)\nJune 19Fey ManorMeditation Room\nMorgan:\nWe will now begin the channeling. Mystic Maya and honored guest, please proceed into the Channeling Chamber.\nGrey:\nWith this, I can finally swat all those pesky flies, once and for all! You hear me!? They won't be able to say a single bad thing about me after this! You would love to hear them apologize, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nMe!? Oh, uh, yeah, I sure would.\nMorgan:\nMystic Maya, do you have the Channeling Chamber key?\nMaya:\nYup, right here.\nMorgan:\nThat is most satisfactory. That key is one-of-a-kind, so please take care of it well.\nMaya:\nIt'll be fine, Aunt Morgan. I won't lose it, trust me! OK, Dr. Grey. Let's get started.\nGrey:\nFinally! Let's go!\n*click*\nMorgan:\nNow let us wait patiently out here for them. Please have some lovely bitter green tea and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts...\nLotta:\nHold on, now, granny!\nMorgan:\n...Granny?\nLotta:\nHow come we ain't allowed in that room!?\nMorgan:\nDear madam, you have an \"impressive\" grasp of English. From where did you learn it?\nLotta:\nWhat!? I'm from the heart of the heartland!\nMorgan:\nIs that so? Then I humbly request that you return to this \"Heart of the Heartland\".\nLotta:\nWh-What are ya...?\nMorgan:\nThis is Kurain Village. If you can not follow our traditions and rules, we request that you leave!\nLotta:\n...! ... Sorry.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. She shut Lotta up! Now THAT's impressive!)\nMorgan:\nNow then, let us wait.\n*BANG*\nLotta:\nHey now! Wh-What was that just now!?\nPhoenix:\n(It came from inside the Channeling Chamber...)\n*BANG*\nLotta:\nHey! Th-That's a gunshot!\nMorgan:\nE-Excuse me!?\nLotta:\nI've heard that sound before. It's a gunshot! I'd bet my afro on it!\nPhoenix:\n(M-Maya! Maya's in there!)\nLotta:\nYeah! Now that's what I call being a man!\n*SLAM* *SLAM* *CRASH!*\nPhoenix:\nD-Dr. Grey!!\n*klik*\n???:\n...I... ...I was... murdered...\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya?\n???:\nThat man... ...murdered me... ...so I killed... him...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\n*klik*\nPhoenix:\nLotta! At a time like this!?\nLotta:\nTimes like this are perfect for snapping up shots! But anyway... what's going on here!? This gal... Is she... ...Maya!?\nStep away from there!\nMorgan:\nPlease leave this area to me. Go quickly and inform the police!\nPhoenix:\nBut, but...\nMorgan:\nHurry! Before there are more victims here!\nLotta:\nHey, let's go, City Boy! Leave this to the granny!\nJune 19Kurain Village\nPhoenix:\n(My cell phone doesn't get reception way out here... So I ended up using the phone booth to call the police...)\nLotta:\nAnd...?\nPhoenix:\nThey're on their way.\nLotta:\nThat's good. Lawdy, I saw a genuine \"mysterious phenomenon\"...\nPhoenix:\n(She seems really on edge because of all this... Not that I blame her... I'm scared to death by what's going on...)\nJune 19Fey ManorMeditation Room\nMorgan:\nAh, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nMs. Fey! How's, um... Mystic... Maya?\nMorgan:\nShe has returned to \"this world\". The Spirit Severing Technique was successful.\nPhoenix:\nLet me see her, please!\nMorgan:\nShe is still unconscious. I humbly request that you wait outside for her recovery.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I just have to wait... *sigh*)\nGumshoe:\nThe police are here! Sorry to keep you waiting! Huh? ...You again!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you doing all the way out here, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nIt's actually kinda funny. I was in the area for a business trip, pal. Well, time to check out the crime scene. I'll have to question everyone here later on, so just sit tight, alright?\nPhoenix:\n(Why is he grinning at me...?)\nMorgan:\nShall I show you to the scene of the crime, Detective Gymshoe?\nGumshoe:\nUm... My name isn't Gymshoe...\nPhoenix:\n(The two of them went into the Channeling Chamber... I guess all I can do for now is see what everyone else has to say...)\nJune 19Kurain Village\nLotta:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(She's probably scared out of her wits after having a murder take place right near her.) Lotta?\nLotta:\nGAWDDON'TLETITBEMENEXT!\nPhoenix:\nEek! Don't scare me like that!\nLotta:\nWhat do you mean!? Yer the one scaring me! If I weren't so tough, you'd have another dead body on yer hands -- mine!\nPhoenix:\nDid you see or notice anything that stuck out at you?\nLotta:\nNah... Well, maybe one thing...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it!?\nLotta:\nTurns out my poor stomach's not good at handlin' this kind of thing.\nPhoenix:\nHuh-what?\nLotta:\nCurses and ghosts and stuff comin' back to get ya... This is just too much, I say.\nPhoenix:\nWhat is too much?\nLotta:\nBeing an occult photographer. That's some scary stuff, so I think I'm gonna try being a celebrity photographer, now.\nPhoenix:\nGoing after photos more within your reach from now on? More glamour, less gore?\nLotta:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's up?\nLotta:\nOh, yeah!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nLotta:\nI took some hot pictures earlier!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nLotta:\nRemember!? I took some pictures at the murder scene inside!\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! She did! Two even!)\nLotta:\n\"The Séance Murder\"... I sure like the ring of that. It'll be a sensational story!\nPhoenix:\nL-Lotta!\nLotta:\nSorry, but my journalistic sense is burnin' inside me! Hate to cut and run, but I'm headin' back in! Gotta beat those cops to the scoop of the century! UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAhahahahahahahahahahaha... ...\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know who's scarier... Lotta or the spirits... And why does it feel like we've been through this before...?)\nJune 19Fey ManorChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\n(The police are busily running here and there, and I don't see Maya anywhere...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, you! Don't touch anything!\nPhoenix:\nLook, I really need to ask you some questions!\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Don't look at me like I'm some sort of uncaring jerk... Tell you what, pal. I'll let you ask me a few questions, alright?\nJune 19Fey ManorSide Room\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I'm pretty sure there was someone sleeping here earlier...)\n???:\nLike, how can I help you?\nPhoenix:\nAck! Ah, I'm, uh... That is... I...\n???:\nUm, like, so isn't it about time to start?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Time to start what?\n???:\nYou know, like, the channeling!\nPhoenix:\nChanneling...? Oh, oh, oh, oh!! No, actually, the situation has kind of changed...\n???:\nHuh? Like, what do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nPlease stay calm, but... there has been a murder! (Changed from [Please stay calm, but... a murder has taken place!] in the original release)\n???:\n... Um, so, like... A murder is that thing where, like, one person kills another, right?\nPhoenix:\nYes! A person has killed another person!\n???:\nOh, that's... Uh... What are the words I'm looking for...? It's like... ...like totally a bummer.\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah... (After all that effort, that's all she had to say?)\n???:\nOh, I'm sorry. I forgot to, like, introduce myself.\nIni:\nMy name is Ini Miney. Um... At the college, I'm researching and studying \"parapsychology\".\nPhoenix:\n\"Parapsychology\"?\nIni:\nThat's right. Um... I think people, like, usually call it, \"occult studies\" or something. Like supernatural phenomenon, ESP and psychic powers. That sort of stuff.\nPhoenix:\n(That's pretty out there...) I'm Phoenix Wright, attorney at law.\nJune 19Fey ManorWinding Way\nPhoenix:\n(There's no one here... as usual.) Ack! ...H-Hey... How are you?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYou're Pearl, right?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. Silent as ever... ...? What's that she's got in her hand? I've seen it somewhere before...)\nAfter clearing \"Any ideas\" Talk option in Kurain Village and clearing all Talk options in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber and Fey Manor - Side Room:\nJune 19Fey ManorMeditation Room\nMorgan:\nOh, dear madam... You have such impeccable timing.\nIni:\nLike, what's all the buzz?\nGumshoe:\nAhem. Alright everyone, listen up! You too, pal! I'm going to give you all a brief update! Right now, it looks like the investigation's not going to be done until real late...\nMorgan:\nThat is a terrible shame. I propose that everyone sleep here under the roof of the Fey Manor tonight.\nPhoenix:\n(What a mess. I can't believe how crazy this day turned out... Maya was arrested and taken away by the police. And I don't see myself getting any sleep tonight...)\nJune 20, 8:02 AMFey ManorMeditation Room\nPhoenix:\n(*yawn* Uuugh... Morning... I guess I must have nodded off at some point... I hope Maya's OK. I should hurry and get to the Detention Center, ASAP!)\nJune 20, 10:34 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nMaya:\nN... Nick! Nick! I...!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nWhat am I going to do!? I never imagined it would turn out like this!\nPhoenix:\nCalm down, Maya! Take deep breaths. (Come to think of it, the first time I met her... It all started right here, in this detention center...)\nMaya:\nI finally... I finally get to see you again, and...\nPhoenix:\nIt's not your fault. You didn't do it.\nMaya:\nNo, I... I did it... I killed that person.\nPhoenix:\nBut that wasn't you.\nMaya:\nIt doesn't matter. It might as well have been me. I was too weak... and I... I couldn't control the spirit's power, so...\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to bring up the case quite yet, but...)\nMaya:\n...You don't have to be nice to me. I understand.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n... (...I guess this is about all the information I'm going to gather for today...) I'll be back later, Maya. In the meantime, please make sure you prepare it, OK?\nMaya:\nHuh? \"It\"? What is \"it\"?\nPhoenix:\nThe document requesting me to be your attorney, of course.\nMaya:\n...! But...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's wrong?\nMaya:\nAre you sure? I mean, I'm guilty! I'm a murderer!\nPhoenix:\nNo one's decided that yet.\nMaya:\nBut I did! I killed that person... with these... two hands...!\nPhoenix:\nThat's enough, Maya.\nMaya:\nIt's hopeless! If you defend me, you'll lose, I'm sure...\nPhoenix:\nStop it!\nMaya:\n... ...Help me... Nick, help me... I'm scared...\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry, I will. When is the trial?\nMaya:\nIt sounds like tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\n(As usual, zero prep time...) Alright. I'm going now.\nMaya:\nWait.\nPhoenix:\n...?\nMaya:\nThis jewel... This is called a Magatama. It's a magical charm and it's always protected me. Give this to Pearly... And I'm sure she'll lend you her spiritual powers.\nMagatama received from Maya.\nJune 20Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPhoenix:\nPhew. It feels like I've been gone forever. But it's only been one day... (Oh, that's right!) Where's that newspaper Dr. Grey brought the other day...? ...Ah, here it is. Right on top of my desk. (This is the only thing he left behind that's going to be of any help...)\nNewspaper Clipping 1 added to the Court Record.\nAfter visiting Wright & Co. Law Offices or Kurain Village:\nJune 20Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(Maya must still be in questioning... I hope the detectives are taking it easy on her, but... these kinds of cases aren't taken lightly. I guess I'll come back later.)\nJune 20Kurain Village\nPhoenix:\n(I have to save Maya, no matter what! It's her life on the line! What in the world happened in that room yesterday?)\nJune 20Fey ManorMeditation Room\nPhoenix:\n(The Meditation Room nurtures all mediums young and old. Even mediums in training, I'd wager. But it's pretty deserted today... ...probably because of the murder yesterday...)\nJune 20Fey ManorChanneling Chamber\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today... I should take this chance and thoroughly check this room. If I'm lucky, I might uncover a clue or two...\nMorgan:\nOh, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nGood morning.\nMorgan:\nI am on my way to go meet Mystic Maya, and I thought to bring her some items to make her feel more at home. Namely, tea so bitter you lose your tongue and jaw-droppingly large strawberry desserts.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure Maya will be very grateful...\nMorgan:\nThat's \"Mystic Maya\", good sir!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. She is one scary lady.)\nMorgan:\nOh, dear, sweet Mystic Maya... Pearl wept constantly for you last night, as did I.\nPhoenix:\n(I know it's important for me to search the site, but I should ask her some questions too, while I have the chance...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen:\nMorgan:\nWell, then, I do believe it is time for me to take my leave.\nPhoenix:\nAlright. Please tell Maya I said hi.\nMorgan:\nWhat was that!?\nPhoenix:\nUh, I mean, Mystic Maya.\nMorgan:\nI will tell her.\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh*)\nJune 20Fey ManorWinding Way\nPhoenix:\n(Little Pearl isn't here today... Maybe she's at school?)\nJune 20Fey ManorSide Room\nIni:\nOh, hey! Like, you're that guy from yesterday... The, uh, dentist guy...\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, I'm a lawyer.\nIni:\nThat's right! Um... Mr. Smith, Esquire.\nPhoenix:\n...That's \"Wright\". Wait, I mean, you're wrong. My name is \"Wright\".\nIni:\n\"Smith\", \"Wright\"... Well, I got, like, three letters, at least.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think she gets the point...) Anyway, why are you here?\nIni:\nSo, like, I study this thing called \"parapsychology\" at this college and...\nPhoenix:\nUm, you told me about that yesterday. The sesame allergy, too. What I'd really like to know is why you're still here today?\nIni:\nOh! So, like, that's what you meant! Like, you shoulda been more, like, clear about it!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry. My bad.\nIni:\nNo, it's OK. Like, it's really...\nPhoenix:\n...\nIni:\n...?\nPhoenix:\n...That's it? Why'd you stop mid-sentence!?\nIni:\nDid I? ...So, like... what was I talking about again...?\nPhoenix:\n... (If Lotta ever wanted another \"genuine mysterious phenomenon\", it's right here.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining folding screen in Fey Manor - Channeling Chamber, and clearing \"The victim\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Side Room:\nJune 20Fey ManorWinding Way\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAck! Y-You surprised me!\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd how are you today?\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I guess she isn't open to friendly chatting... Huh? She's still holding something in her hand... ...It looks like the same thing she had yesterday...)\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah. Maya said to give this to you...\nPearl:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! I'm in trouble now!! If Morgan sees us like this, I'll be the next one they're channeling...)\nPearl:\nTh-That's... That's Mystic Maya's...\nPhoenix:\n...Huh!? (Sh-She actually spoke!)\nPearl:\nWho are you...?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm Phoenix Wright. I, uh, worked with Maya...\nPearl:\n...Y-You worked with Mystic Maya...? You... You're Mr. Nick, right?\nPhoenix:\n...Uh, excuse me? (I bet I know who she picked \"Nick\" up from...)\nPearl:\nI know who you are. You're... You're Mystic Maya's... \"special someone\"...\nPhoenix:\nWH-WH-WH-WHAT!?\nPearl:\nSo then... Of course! You're going to help Mystic Maya, aren't you? That's what you're going to do, right?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, yeah... I will...\nPearl:\nOh wow... It's like a beautiful fairy tale! That earnest look shining brightly in your eyes... It must be true love...\nPhoenix:\n...Wh-What!? (Why am I being boiled into a bright red lobster by this little kid!?)\nPearl:\nI'm so jealous of Mystic Maya! Ah, what a wonderful relationship...\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait... I... uhh... I mean... We aren't... Things aren't like...\nPearl:\nHee hee, I can tell you're a good person. Alright, Mr. Nick! I may be small, but I'm going to help you in any way I can!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Pearls? I can call you that, right? You're too cute to just call you Pearl.\nPearl:\nSure, Mr. Nick... Umm... Are you sure it's OK for me to have this Magatama?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it's OK. I was told to give it to you.\nPearl:\nBut, I can't accept something like this! ...All I really should do is charge this Magatama with spiritual energy...\nPhoenix:\nSpiritual energy?\nPearl:\nPlease take this. I'm sure it will be helpful.\nPhoenix:\n...What do you mean?\nPearl:\nIt will let you see people's secrets.\nPhoenix:\nSee people's... secrets...?\nPearl:\nYes. ...If it's alright with you, I would like to accompany you for a little while. I can explain the Magatama's power to you when we meet someone hiding a secret.\nJune 20Fey ManorMeditation Room\nGumshoe:\nHey, it's you, pal! So you're going to be her lawyer, I bet.\nPhoenix:\nYes.\nGumshoe:\nOh... I really feel bad for you, pal. Just this once, I wish I could be on your side.\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but I shouldn't be saying that kind of stuff to you. Hey! You're a cute kid.\nPearl:\n...\nGumshoe:\nHa ha ha. I'm not scary. Honest!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, I never knew Gumshoe liked kids...)\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey! I know! I'll show you something cool! How's this? It's a real, genuine pistol...\nPhoenix:\nD-Detective Gumshoe!! What are you doing showing her something that dangerous!\nGumshoe:\nOh, sorry...\nJune 20Fey ManorSide Room\nPhoenix:\nHello again. We seem to be seeing a lot of each other today.\nIni:\nAww, she's, like, tooootally cute! Is she, like, your daughter?\nPhoenix:\nW-What!? NO! (How old do you think I am!?)\nPhoenix:\nPlease, tell me all you know about Dr. Grey.\nIni:\nMy... My sister's name was Mimi Miney. She was, like, a nurse at Dr. Grey's clinic.\nPhoenix:\n(That's what I thought...)\nIni:\nI heard that, like, Dr. Grey was really tough on people. Like, a total slave driver. My sis was, like, always coming home totally wiped out 'cause she was overworked.\nPhoenix:\nWiped out? So is that why she fell asleep at the wheel?\nIni:\nThat guy, like, drove my sis so hard, so, like, that's why the accident happened.\nPhoenix:\nThe one where 14 patients died from malpractice?\nIni:\nYeah, like, I think that was the doctor's fault, too. My sis was pushed by, like, everyone's expectations and, like, her duties and stuff. And that pushed her to her death.\nPhoenix:\nOh... I'm sorry...\nIni:\nSo, like, are we done? I've, like, already told my story to, like, everyone...\nPearl:\nDo you understand now, Mr. Nick? This is how a Psyche-Lock works.\nPhoenix:\n...Well, I don't plan to pry into people's hearts unless I absolutely need to...\nPearl:\nThe lock this time was pretty easy, but... you might meet people who aren't as willing to give in later on. If you don't have enough proof, be careful and know when to stop trying.\nAfter clearing \"Successor\" Talk option in Fey Manor - Meditation Room and clearing \"The victim\" Talk option upon breaking Psyche-Lock in Fey Manor - Side Room:\nJune 20Kurain Village\nPearl:\nMr. Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHmm? What's wrong?\nPearl:\nI have never left Kurain Village.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really? Wow, that's, um, pretty amazing...\nPearl:\nYou are going to meet with Mystic Maya... aren't you? Please tell her I said hi.\nPhoenix:\nHey, wait! (She ran off... Again. Well, I know Ini's secret now, but... I still don't have any idea how I'm going to save Maya. I don't even know if I should go in there with a smile or a straight face... *sigh*)\nJune 20Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nPhoenix:\n(What am I supposed to do!? I'm almost out of time! Can I really do anything? Can I really save her...?)\n???:\nSorry to keep you waiting.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? Must be Maya...)\n???:\nIt's been a long time, hasn't it, Phoenix?\nPhoenix:\n...! (That voice...) M-Mia!\nMia:\nEven without me being here, it looks like you've learned to stand on your own.\nPhoenix:\n(Mia... She's Maya's older sister, and my mentor. She was a top-notch defense lawyer, but a certain case forced her into \"retirement\". But... whenever I'm in trouble, she comes to help, just like this. Her spirit comes back from the other world and borrows Maya's body for a bit...)\nMia:\nPhoenix, you can't make that kind of face in front of your client.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nMia:\nA lawyer is someone who smiles no matter how bad it gets, and especially when it's bad.\nPhoenix:\nMia...\nMia:\nYou can't smile at the end if you haven't been smiling the whole way there. In any case, the face you're making now is no face to show a client, Phoenix.\nPhoenix:\nB-But!\nMia:\nSo, tell me all about it. I'm going to guess that my sister is in a lot of trouble again...\nPhoenix:\n(I told her everything about what had happened in the last two days. Mia closed her eyes, deep in thought, while she listened...)\nMia:\n...I see...\nPhoenix:\nMia... What am I supposed to do?\nMia:\n... It's pretty clear what a good lawyer does in this situation.\nPhoenix:\nA-And that is!? Tell me, please!\nMia:\nBelieve in your convictions. And fight for the complete acquittal of your client.\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Black Key:\nMia:\n... ... You already know everything you need to know. You know what the \"key\" to this case is... That is enough...\nPhoenix:\nBut... But! How can I win tomorrow without knowing who the real murderer is!? Who... Who could have...?\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't know it at the time, (Changed from [At the time, I didn't know,] in the original release) but this day was going to end with a turn for the surprising...)\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\nM-Mia!? Wh-What...!?\nMia:\nWhat's wrong?\nPhoenix:\n(That's right. Only I can see the Psyche-Locks... Which means... Mia must know something about the real murderer!

I don't, like, remember anything else. -Doctor Lurking in the Shadows? If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney.

What is the defense's position?Phoenix:\nYour Honor.Judge:\nDoes the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"?Phoenix:\n...Yes.von Karma:\nFoolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time.Phoenix:\n(\"Justified self-defense\"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of themself. (Changed from [A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself.] in the original release) We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of \"not guilty\", Your Honor! (Because to plead \"justified self-defense\" is to say you did kill someone.)von Karma:\nHow foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness.Phoenix:\n(She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.)von Karma:\nWitness, your name and occupation?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!!von Karma:\nGet to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room.Judge:\nWhat were they doing in there?Gumshoe:\nUm... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir.Judge:\nCh-Channeling a spirit??Phoenix:\n(That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release)Gumshoe:\n*ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room.Judge:\nAh, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over.Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Judge:\nSo, how was the victim killed?Gumshoe:\nI was about to get to that...von Karma:\nStop wasting my time, then.Witness Testimony-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Judge:\nHmm...

Whose pistol was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim? Now, why would he have...\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\n\"Why would he have a pistol?\" Who cares? The point that you are missing is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start.\nJudge:\nFingerprints? There were fingerprints?\nGumshoe:\nAlong with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir.\nJudge:\nHmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...! I walked right into her hands there.) (Changed from [Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPoint blank, huh? So about how far away was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away.\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know he was shot at point blank?\nvon Karma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me!?\nvon Karma:\nGunpowder burn.\nPhoenix:\n...Gunpowder burn?\nvon Karma:\nWhen something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\nGumshoe:\nGunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...)Gumshoe:\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStabbed... And what was he stabbed with?\nGumshoe:\nA fruit knife.\nJudge:\nI see. And whose knife was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it.\nJudge:\nHmm... All over it, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. This does not look good...)\nvon Karma:\nHa ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Gumshoe:\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow severe was the wound?\nGumshoe:\nIf it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand.\nPhoenix:\n(This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...)Gumshoe:\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure he was stabbed first, then shot?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal.\nvon Karma:\nA fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... What a pain...)Phoenix:\n(Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...)After pressing first, second, third and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered.Gumshoe:\nI brought the two murder weapons with me today.Judge:\nVery well. The court accepts them into evidence.Pistol added to the Court Record.Knife added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThe date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time.Judge:\nAnd two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them, huh... (Changed from [And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...?] in the original release) Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case.von Karma:\nNaturally!Phoenix:\n(This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...)von Karma:\nYour Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there?Judge:\nThat is quite true... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Judge:\nEven in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead \"not guilty\"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose.von Karma:\nSee, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes...Judge:\nWhat will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to \"justified self-defense\"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance.Phoenix:\n(This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!)Plead justified self-defense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to \"justified self-defense\"...\nvon Karma:\nHah.\nJudge:\nUnderstood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea.\nPhoenix:\n(...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?)\nMia:\n...You already hold the key... ...If you don't believe, you cannot win...\nPhoenix:\n(...! If we plead \"justified self-defense\", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor!\nJudge:\nY-Yes?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty!\nLeads to:\n\"...You.\"Plead not guilty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If we plead \"justified self-defense\"... we would basically be confessing to a murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'd be labeled a murderer... I can't let that happen!) Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHave you reached a conclusion, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense will not change its plea. We will accept nothing short of complete acquittal!\nLeads to:\n\"...You.\"von Karma:\n...You. You have sealed your fate, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!von Karma:\nPresent the final portion of your testimony -- the final strike.Gumshoe:\nUm... Y-Yes... sir...Judge:\nN-Now, see here! Proceedings are run by... Eek!von Karma:\n...Judge:\nOh, yes, of course. Go ahead Detective and give your testimony...von Karma:\nI think the court would like to hear about the other piece of incriminating evidence!Witness Testimony-- Incriminating Evidence --Gumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.\nThis is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.\nAs you can see, it's covered in blood.\nThe defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.Judge:\nSo this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this.Gumshoe:\nThis piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts this into evidence.Maya's Costume added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??)von Karma:\nHah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer.

There is a tiny hole here...\nGumshoe:\n..A... A hole...? But that wasn't in the report.\nJudge:\nHold on! What's this around the hole? I-It smells faintly of gunpowder!\nGumshoe:\nG-Gunpowder!? No one ever told me!\nJudge:\nA hole that smells of gunpowder...\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I've found the \"hole\" I was looking for!) Your Honor, the only logical conclusion you can make is that it must be a bullet hole!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! This is a very grave matter. It's best we correct the Court Record first before anything else.\nMaya's Costume updated in the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nSorry about that. I guess we messed up, sir.\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...! (I-Is she actually... smiling!? What else is she hiding!?)\nvon Karma:\nPull yourself together, Detective. That tiny \"hole\" doesn't change a thing. The strength of the evidence still holds. Continue with your testimony. That, just now, was a fluke. Nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nH-How can you say something like that!? This is a huge oversight!\nJudge:\nWhile I agree it is a mistake on the part of the police, what Prosecutor von Karma has said is true. The evidence still stands.

I'll give you that the blood spatter is from the victim, but... what is this hole in the sleeve?\nGumshoe:\nUm... Sorry, pal. We must've thought it was just a tear in the seam...\nPhoenix:\nMissing the hole is not what I'm asking you about. I'm talking about the hole itself! The smell of gunpowder  clearly gives away that... it is a bullet hole!\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nAs if little things like that matter.\nPhoenix:\nBut they do.\nvon Karma:\nA \"bullet hole\" in the sleeve, blood splatter all over the costume... Neither of these things can change the fact the defendant killed the victim.\nPhoenix:\n(...Grr... I know there's something more to that costume.)\nvon Karma:\nCome now Detective. You're wasting precious time.\nGumshoe:\n... Yes, sir.Gumshoe:\nThe defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe wasn't \"fighting back\"? How do you know if he was or wasn't!?\nGumshoe:\nWe could find no evidence that the victim put up any sort of struggle, pal.\nJudge:\nHmm... So did the murderer have a fight with the victim, or not?

Heh, having you call me by my full name is kind of a weird feeling...Phoenix:\nYou said that my client killed \"a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.\"Gumshoe:\nYeah, I did.Phoenix:\nThen what, may I ask, is the bullet hole you police overlooked supposed to mean!?Gumshoe:\nEh, um... What does it mean?Phoenix:\nI'll tell you what it means. It means that the victim had fired off a shot. Is this what it means to \"not fight back\"?Gumshoe:\nA-Ah! You're right!Judge:\nIt seems you are correct! (Changed from [It would seem that way!] in the original release) If the victim had tried to shoot the defendant, then... it would change everything...

The wind seems to be shifting...)von Karma:\nHah.Phoenix:\n(What is with that \"are you finished yet\" laugh?)von Karma:\nAre you finished yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Judge:\nMs. von Karma?von Karma:\nIt seems... that Maya Fey was shot at by the victim. However, that is only grounds enough to support a \"justified self-defense\" plea.Judge:\nThat is correct.von Karma:\nBut I'm sure you remember, Your Honor, what the defense clearly said. They rejected \"justified self-defense\" and pleaded \"not guilty.\"Phoenix:\nAck!Gumshoe:\nNow that you...Judge:\nWhy, that's right!von Karma:\nWhich means! The defense has yet to prove anything at all!Phoenix:\nNooooo!!Judge:\nW-Well... Yes, that's true...von Karma:\nFurthermore... just the fact that there is a bullet hole in the costume... is not enough to substantiate even a plea of \"justified self-defense\".Judge:\nHuh? How so?Gumshoe:\nAaah!von Karma:\nDon't just stand there. Hurry up and tell the court what transpired that day. ...With the new information we acquired added in, of course.Gumshoe:\nHuh? You mean... By myself...? You want me to put together the scenario all by myself? Aah!von Karma:\n...Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Right away, sir!Witness Testimony-- What Transpired --Gumshoe:\nDuring the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.\nOf course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.\nWhile the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.\nThe victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.\nThe defendant then picked up on the opening, took the victim's gun, and ended it...Judge:\nHmm...

And afterward, I felt a little lightheaded and dizzy. ...I guess the damage was maybe... about 10 times the dizziness...?

With wishy-washy thinking like that, anyone can explain anything away!Phoenix:\nThen I implore you to disprove my line of thinking.von Karma:\nLet's see... In the middle of their fight, the victim pushed the defendant away. And it was then, when they were separated, that he fired! How was that?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nAs if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that!von Karma:\n...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself. And then while she was preparing to strike again, the doctor took his shot. There. That sound satisfy even you.Judge:\nHmm... That does make an awful lot of sense. What do you think, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(I must be careful. I can't afford to make a mistake here! Concentrate and think!)It makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Ack, it's no good. I can't find a \"hole\" in her logic at all this time...) I admit it. Somehow, your reasoning makes logical sense.\nvon Karma:\nThat's it. That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Drat. It's 11:00 AM. I've already missed my morning tea. ...However. At least we were able to arrive at a conclusion.\nJudge:\nHmm... It does look that way.\nPhoenix:\n(...Oh boy... If I don't do something soon, it'll be curtains for Maya...)\nJudge:\nWell then, I think we can...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Please... Wait!\nJudge:\nWho was that? Mr. Wright? Please refrain from making unnecessary outbursts!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't care how, but I must find something to go on in Von Karma's explanation!)\nLeads to:\n\"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\"Something doesn't make sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\"Phoenix:\nThere is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!Gumshoe:\nFatal...?Judge:\nFlaw...!? Yeow!von Karma:\nVery interesting. I would love to see where this \"flaw\" is! Show me something that contradicts my explanation!Phoenix:\n(There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere! \"She put some distance between them before rushing to make the final blow. And when she was about to strike, the doctor took his shot.\" There must be a piece of evidence that contradicts this line of thinking!)Present Folding Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this!\nGumshoe:\nWhy are you showing this to me, pal?\nPhoenix:\nProsecutor von Karma's explanation and this piece of evidence...\nGumshoe:\n...Do not contradict!\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nGumshoe:\nHaha, looks like you need to use your brain a little more, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Being lectured by Gumshoe, of all people, is so embarrassing...)\nGumshoe:\nCome on! Hurry up and get that thinking cap on!\nLeads back to:\n\"There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere!\"Phoenix:\nThis is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.Judge:\nWhat is that? A folding screen?Phoenix:\nI would like to point the court's attention to the \"hole\" in this folding screen.von Karma:\nAaah!Phoenix:\nIt looks like you already know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\nWho? Where? What?Judge:\nMr. Wright! Your explanation, please!Phoenix:\n(Are these two really that clueless...?) The bullet went through the defendant's sleeve first, then the folding screen. It passed through at a height of approximately 8 inches off the ground... Which means! When the shot was fired, Maya... I mean, the defendant, was not getting ready to strike, but was actually squatting low to the ground!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Th-This changes everything!Phoenix:\nPlease look at this diagram of the crime scene. The victim, Dr. Grey was here when he fired the shot. And the bullet hit this folding screen. It hit at this location, about 8 inches off the ground. At this time, the defendant was in this area.Present area directly in front of bullet hole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"She was standing here, near the folding screen!\"Present area behind folding screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere!\nJudge:\nBehind the folding screen...?\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nvon Karma:\nThe victim and his attacker were fighting, were they not? Then what would the attacker be doing all the way back there!?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nvon Karma:\nBesides which, if the attacker was behind the folding screen, then how could the victim even know where to shoot? It's obviously impossible!\nPhoenix:\n... Yeah, I guess so...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Boy, did I just screw up royally... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)\nLeads back to:\n\"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSomewhere around here!\nJudge:\n...?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh. The judge's face is scrunched like he just smelled some serious bad breath...) Uhh... Um... That is, I mean...\nJudge:\nWait! I just realized I forgot to brush this morning... Excuse me while I freshen up.\nPhoenix:\nUh, sure...\nJudge:\nIn the meantime, I want you to think things through again, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, of course... Whoops... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)\nLeads back to:\n\"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\"Phoenix:\nShe was standing here, near the folding screen!von Karma:\nW-Wait a second! We know the defendant was close to the ground based on the height of the bullet hole. But... How can you gauge the distance from that!? Isn't it possible that the defendant was standing much closer to the victim?Phoenix:\nThat's impossible.von Karma:\nB-But why!?Phoenix:\nYou, of all people, should know the answer to that question, Ms. von Karma. If she were shot from somewhere closer, there would be gunpowder burns present. However! There is nothing of the sort around the bullet hole of this costume!von Karma:\nAaaaaah! C-Curse you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You...!Judge:\nHmm... I believe it has now been proven that the defendant was standing a ways from the victim when she was shot at. But do you think this has changed the defendant's situation...?It doesn't change anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, even with that explanation, it feels like nothing has changed... But I can't give up just yet!)\nLeads to:\n\"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\"It changes everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\"Phoenix:\nHonestly, Your Honor! This changes everything! The prosecution has claimed that the defendant was aiming to kill by stabbing. If that were true, delivering the final strike with the knife would be ideal. However! Where and what was the defendant doing at the time...?Gumshoe:\n...Squatting all the way by the folding screen...?Phoenix:\nExactly. If Maya Fey was the real murderer, why would she be by the folding screen instead of preparing to strike?von Karma:\nNnngh...Judge:\nUpon further consideration, it does make very little sense.Gumshoe:\nYeah, I figured there had to be a reason.Phoenix:\nFiguring things out and proving the logic behind everything is YOUR job!Gumshoe:\nOof...Phoenix:\n(Alright! With this, the rest of the trial should be in the b--)von Karma:\n...Phoenix:\n(...blast radius of disaster.)von Karma:\nYou are such a smart man, Mr. Phoenix Wright. To think that you've been able to take a completely hopeless case to this point... Now I know why Papa had a tough time with you. Mmm, you amuse me...Phoenix:\n(Uuugh. Of all the things to inherit, why did it have to be that smarmy smile!?)von Karma:\nDetective. How dare you damage my perfect logic!?Gumshoe:\nH-Huh!?... How is it all my fault??von Karma:\nYou can start repairing your standing by first removing that three-strand \"goatee\". Oh, and rest assured your punishment will come later.Gumshoe:\n...P-Punishment...von Karma:\nWell then, Your Honor, I think I've had all I can take of this detective's face. I think it's time to call in the next witness.Phoenix:\n(Next witness...? That's gotta be Lotta!)Judge:\nVery well. The court will take a 5 minute recess. After we reconvene, we will hear from the next witness.To be continued.June 21, 11:37 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Phoenix:\nPhew, that was a close one.Maya:\nI know you were giving it your all to defend me. But I could feel the death penalty hanging in the air...Phoenix:\nI felt like I was pretty close to dying myself...Pearl:\nBut you were wonderful out there. You listened carefully, made theories, and tricked everyone into believing you.Phoenix:\nTh-Thanks. Wait... Tricked??Pearl:\nThat must be the \"lawyer's\" secret technique, right?Maya:\nBy the way... Is the next witness who I think it is...?Phoenix:\nYeah, I'm pretty sure it's Lotta Hart.Maya:\nOh... Guess there's no escaping her, huh? (Changed from [Oh...

Just hurry up and testify about what happened on the day of the murder.Lotta:\nI haven't even gotten to say my name and job yet...von Karma:\n...Lotta:\nThe name's Lotta Hart, paranormal photographer, and I'm here to testify!Judge:\nNow, now, let's all be one big happy family...

Spinning big crimes and little crimes together. And when the Wheel stops... You die.\nJune 15, 9:12 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nExamine evidence\nAttorney's Badge\nBack side\nApollo:\nThere's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it.\nApollo:\n(Two months have passed since Mr. Gavin's arrest. My first trial, and I lost both my mentor and my job. Yeah, I'll admit it. I was screwed. But even when I hit bottom, I told myself I'd never come here. Honest. Here being the legendary Wright & Co. Law Offices. OK, Justice, time to stop trembling.)\n???:\nAh! You must be here for the interview. Right this way.\nApollo:\nHuh?\n???:\nHello there! You've found the Wright place! Welcome!\nApollo:\nUh... Ah... (What's with this girl!?)\n???:\nWell now, shall we begin?\nApollo:\nBegin... what?\n???:\nRight, first things first... Any special talents?\nApollo:\nErm, talents?\n???:\nYes, well, you must have at least one!\nApollo:\nWell... Uh... I guess... Defending?\n???:\n\"Defending\"... An unusual talent, but it'll do. With a little jazzing up, of course.\nApollo:\nY-You think so...?\n???:\nLet's give it a go, shall we?\nApollo:\nHuh?\n???:\nGo ahead! Show me! Defend! Just give it all you've got. Don't hold back now!\nApollo:\nWh-What are you talking about? I can't just \"defend\" here!\n???:\nFirst lesson: A professional can perform anywhere!\nApollo:\n...Thanks.\n???:\nWe want people to be laughing with us... ...not at us!\nApollo:\n...Thanks. But I'm not sure why they should be laughing at all.\n???:\nWhat...? What exactly do you think you came here to do?\nApollo:\nWhat? Um, defend... No?\n???:\n... Excuse me, but do you know where you are?\nApollo:\nHuh!? The Wright & Co. Law Offices, right?\n???:\n...Oh. I was afraid of that. Don't worry, you're not the first.\nApollo:\nLook, what's going on here? Who are you? I came here to meet with the person in charge...\n???:\nWell, you've apparently made no fewer than two mistakes.\nApollo:\nMistakes? But I got a call from Mr. Wright this morning!\n???:\nPerhaps you should go read the sign out front again?\nApollo:\nWhat's there to read!? Look, it says right there... ...Oh. Why does it say \"Wright Talent Agency\"...?\n???:\nWelcome to the Wright Talent Agency, where you've \"always come to the Wright place!\"\nTrucy:\nI'm Trucy Wright, CEO. I'm a magician.\nApollo:\n(It all came flooding back... The trial... That girl...)\n???:\nHello, sir. Please, pick a card.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. She's my daughter.\nApollo:\nTrucy... Wright.\nTrucy:\nHere, check out our flyer! So... what's your name?\nApollo:\nApollo... Apollo Justice, attorney at law.\nExamine\nBookshelf\nApollo:\nAll these legal books must be Mr. Wright's leftovers... ...There's a lot of unrelated books in here, too. \"One Trick a Day\"... \"Magic for Idiots\"... You'd think a pro magician would aim a bit higher.\nCharley the plant\nTrucy:\nAck! Don't touch Mr. Charley!\nApollo:\n\"Mister\" Charley...?\nTrucy:\nHe's been in this office much longer than I have! Daddy's mentor had a great fondness for Mr. Charley. He's lived here since Daddy was a rookie attorney!\nApollo:\nHuh.  (Mr. Charley... riiight.)\nTrucy:\nNow I take care of him!\nHula hoop\nApollo:\nThat's one of those hula hoop things everyone was crazy about way back when.\nTrucy:\nReally? I had no idea these were that popular!\nApollo:\nI'm not so bad with one myself, actually.\nTrucy:\nEh!? I-I'm still learning... So you can really make someone levitate with it? Show me!\nApollo:\nHuh!? I-I have no idea how! (It's just a normal hula hoop, isn't it?)\nMagic split box\nApollo:\nA strange, split box leers at me from the wall. Um, is this one of those boxes for cutting people in half?\nTrucy:\nThat's right! This cabinet is used for an illusion called the \"Zig-Zag\"!\nApollo:\nI've seen one on TV... But why is one just sitting here in your office?\nTrucy:\nOh, it's a little big for me, you see. So I'm using it as furniture. Hats in the top, shirts in the middle, and pants down below! I think it's a nice touch... don't you?\nApollo:\n(It's not exactly what I'd call a \"welcoming\" decor.)\nPhotograph\nApollo:\nAn old, sepia-tinted photo of a man in a silk top hat.\nTrucy:\nThat's my favorite magician! I want to be just like him someday!\nApollo:\n(Sure, nice... Guess it's good to have a role model. Even if he's gotta be well over 100.)\nTrucy:\nHow rude!\nPiano\nApollo:\nThere are all sorts of strange paraphernalia sitting on top of the piano.\nTrucy:\nThose are my magic props! Practice, practice, practice! A professional never leaves their weapons far from reach!\nApollo:\nBut you can't play the piano with all this junk on it.\nTrucy:\nOh, no one plays here anyway. And the neighbors complain.\nApollo:\n(I guess Mr. Wright really can't play...)\nSilk hat\nApollo:\nA blue silk hat, just like the one Trucy is wearing.\nTrucy:\nOh, that's just for show. Don't wear it, please!\nApollo:\n(Last thought from my mind, honest.)\nTrucy:\nI put it there so clients can see it and know who I am. Nothing says \"magician\" like a silk top hat!\nSpaghetti\nApollo:\nWhoa! That fork is floating! ...Not. Why do you have a plate of plastic spaghetti here?\nTrucy:\nThat right there is the whole reason I became a magician!\nApollo:\nDo tell.\nTrucy:\nI saw a plate just like that in a restaurant once. The floating fork looked so real! That's when I knew... Someday, I'd make magic more amazing than that spaghetti!\nTable\nApollo:\nThat table... doesn't look very sturdy.\nTrucy:\nYou've never seen one of these? It's a magic table!\nApollo:\nSo, like, you make this teapot disappear?\nTrucy:\nSo you might think! But that's not it... Before your very eyes, the contents of the pot change! ...From Earl Grey to Darjeeling!\nApollo:\nKinda hard to see the difference, I'd think...\nMove\nApollo:\n(What's up with this \"Wright Talent Agency\"? Guess I'll talk to her and find out what I can.)\nTalk\nWright Talent Agency\nApollo:\nSo... Is this really a talent agency?\nTrucy:\nYou bet! Daddy started it seven years ago, when he quit law. Of course, we only have two people signed up right now.\nApollo:\nTwo people... Does that include you?\nTrucy:\nTrucy Wright, Magician Extraordinaire! I've done a lot of stage shows! Paid, too! I am a professional, you know.\nApollo:\nEr... right.\nTrucy:\nPromise you'll come to one of my shows, OK? Let's see... Oh, and the other person our agency represents is... Phoenix Wright, Pianist Extra Ordinaire!\nApollo:\nYour dad, in other words. Didn't he say he couldn't play the piano?\nTrucy:\nOur agency doesn't see that as a problem. Why, there are many magicians who can't do magic!\nApollo:\nAt least you're optimistic, I'll give you that.\nTrucy Wright\nApollo:\nSo you're his, er... you're Phoenix Wright's daughter?\nTrucy:\nThat's right! After Daddy quit law seven years ago... ...I promised I would keep him fed! So I'm kind of his sugar daddy! Get it?\nApollo:\nNo.\nTrucy:\nI'm in charge of this whole office, too. Pretty amazing for a young lass of fifteen, wouldn't you agree!?\nApollo:\nF-Fifteen? Uh, how old is Mr. Wright?\nTrucy:\nDaddy? Oh... he's 33 this year.\nApollo:\n...I'm sure there's a good explanation. (I hope...)\nTrucy:\n?\nPhoenix Wright\nApollo:\nUm, about Mr. Wright giving up law... It was because of that incident seven years ago, wasn't it...?\nTrucy:\nEh? You know about that!?\nApollo:\nNot the details. I remember the news, though. It was a big deal.\nTrucy:\nSo I hear. I was too young to understand what was going on. I'll ask Daddy about it next time I get a chance.\nApollo:\nDaddy, right... That reminds me. About Mr. Wright... He gave me a call this morning to come in.\nTrucy:\nDaddy's not here right now. He's in the hospital.\nApollo:\nThe hospital!?\nTrucy:\nYeah. He's on strict bed rest until he gets better.\nApollo:\nWh... What!?\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nTrucy:\nOh, I've seen one of those before! That's an attorney's badge. It looks just like the one Daddy used to have. Now if I take this badge... And do this, and this... See! It's gone!\nApollo:\nH-Hey! My badge! What'd you do with my badge!?\nTrucy:\nNo need to worry! Just look in your pocket!\nApollo:\nHuh! No way... My pocket? (Wait a second... There's something in there!) ... It's a flyer for your agency!\nTrucy:\nAnd here's your badge. You can have it back now.\nApollo:\n(That's the last time I let her touch anything of mine. Period.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nApollo:\nOK... Which hospital is Mr. Wright in? I'll pay him a visit.\nTrucy:\nOh, the Hickfield Clinic. It's quite close.\nApollo:\nRight. Well, I'll be going now. And I'll, uh... give this showbiz gig some thought, OK?\nTrucy:\nWait! I'll go with you!\nJune 15, 9:45 AMHickfield Clinic\nApollo:\n(So... this is Mr. Wright's hospital...)\n???:\nEh? Visitors are ya? Hrmm?\nApollo:\nUh, yeah. Are you the... doctor?\nHickfield:\nAyup. Dr. Hickfield's the name. Eh he he.\nTrucy:\nGood morning, Doctor!\nHickfield:\nOh, hiya there, Trucy. Cute as ever! Eh he he.\nTrucy:\nIs... this Daddy's room?\nHickfield:\nOh yah. 'Cept he's gone for a mornin' checkup. Be back soon. How're you, Miss Trucy? Got any places you'd like... examined? Eh heh...\nPhoenix:\nDoctor... the nurse was looking for you.\nHickfield:\nWhy, if it isn't the Daddy o' the cutest lil' thing in town! Hrm. Hrmm. Guess I'll be off then. Eh he? Later, Trucy.\nApollo:\nWow, what an odd bird that guy was.\nPhoenix:\nGood morning. Didn't expect you so soon, Apollo.\nApollo:\nMr. Wright...\nExamine\nBottle\nTrucy:\nAaaah! Daddy! You snuck some grape juice in again!? The doctor said you weren't supposed to drink that here!\nPhoenix:\nTrucy. Look at the label.\nTrucy:\n... Oh. \"Deep Sea Mineral Water\". That's fine, I guess.\nPhoenix:\nI switched the labels. Don't tell Trucy, 'kay?\nApollo:\n(What can I say, the man loves his grape juice.)\nDVD stack\nApollo:\nA swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. \"The Steel Samurai\", \"The Nickel Samurai\"... \"The Pink Princess\", \"The Zappy Samurai: Electric Bugaboo\"... They're all children's action hero shows...\nPhoenix:\nThis \"kid\" I know keeps sending them to me.\nApollo:\nHuh. Like a niece or nephew?\nPhoenix:\n...Something like that.\nApollo:\nQuite the collection. This kid's parents must be really generous with their allowance. (Funny, Mr. Wright doesn't seem the type that kids would like.)\nHospital bed\nApollo:\nMr. Wright's bed... It's really messy.\nTrucy:\nLook how messy this is! You're just hopeless without me, aren't you, Daddy?\nApollo:\n(Yikes! She's attempting to clean up! Look out!)\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha. You got me. What can I say? I was raised in a barn. Try not to let word get out, Apollo. If you don't mind.\nApollo:\n(Yeah, it might ruin your illustrious career pretending to play the piano.)\nPiano\nApollo:\nThis looks like a child's toy piano.\nPhoenix:\nGotta practice. Wouldn't want my fingers to get stiff. A pro always keeps his weapon close at hand. Shall I play you a tune?\nApollo:\nUh... no thanks.\nPhoenix:\nAh, how unfortunate. I so rarely get a chance to play.\nTelevision\nApollo:\nWhat's that on TV? Looks like some sort of action hero show...\nTrucy:\nOh, I know that one! That's the Sniffling Samurai! His \"Booger Flick\" attack is a big hit with the grade school crowd.\nApollo:\nI had no idea you liked this kind of stuff, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nWell, what else is there to do when you're stuck in bed? Besides, the episodes will just keep piling up if I don't keep up, you know?\nApollo:\nUm... yeah. (Try not buying them.)\nPhoenix:\nNow's the only time I get to watch and write up my reports.\nApollo:\nYour... reports?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a long story. Like a lot of things, actually.\nTalk\nWhat happened?\nApollo:\nSo... what happened?\nPhoenix:\n...Who could have imagined it? Me, victim of a hit and run...\nApollo:\nA hit and... You were hit by a car!?\nPhoenix:\nOh, he tried to swerve, I'll give him that. Picture me tossed thirty feet through the air... ...only stopping when my head hit that telephone pole.\nApollo:\nYou hit a telephone pole with your head!? Are you OK!?\nPhoenix:\nThankfully, my only injury was a sprained ankle.\nApollo:\n(He really is as lucky as they say...)\nAbout Trucy...\nApollo:\nThere's something that, well, it just doesn't sit right. I just can't believe you have a daughter, Mr. Wright! And... she's so big! Not fat, but, er, you know what I mean.\nPhoenix:\nOh, Trucy's still a child.\nTrucy:\nDaddy! How many times do I have to remind you! I'm not a child anymore!\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha! But you'll always be Daddy's little baby girl to me, Trucy.\nApollo:\n(Ah ha ha, my foot. I'm not buying it.)\nPhoenix:\nOh, something you should know about Trucy...\nApollo:\nShe's a magician, right? She told me.\nPhoenix:\nNot a mere stage magician... She's a genius.\nTrucy:\nTee hee! Aw, Daddy!\nPhoenix:\nYou'll soon come to appreciate her \"talent\".\nApollo:\nYou could just tell me things instead of insinuating them.\nWright Talent Agency\nApollo:\nSo, why did you contact me? What could the Wright Talent Agency possibly want with me?\nPhoenix:\nNo need to get prickly, now.\nApollo:\nHey, I didn't ask to be dragged in like this!\nTrucy:\nHuh? But didn't you come into the office of your own free will anyway?\nApollo:\nWell, yeah, of course. \"Help! We're in big trouble here at the office! Big!\" ...I thought someone was dying.\nPhoenix:\nSo you don't think this is big trouble? My talent agency represents only two people... and one of them is in the hospital.\nTrucy:\nThat's right, Daddy! How are we going to pay this month's rent!? And the groceries!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... That's the problem with such a tight operation. It's a symbiotic relationship. When one of us falls, the other, too, must fall...\nApollo:\nHey! This isn't exactly a suitable conversation to be having with a 15-year-old kid!\nPhoenix:\nIn any case, if Apollo here can't help you... ...you'll have to transfer to a new school. Again.\nTrucy:\nNo! I can't! I only just made friends... How could you do this to me... to us!? Polly!\nApollo:\nHuh? What? Now it's my fault?\nPhoenix:\nOn that note, how about you come work for us? I've got the perfect client for you already lined up.\nApollo:\nA... A client? (You mean I get to do my job? I get to defend in court!?) ...Alright. I'll hear what you have to say.\nTrucy:\nYou got him, Daddy! Hook, line, and sinker!\nPhoenix:\nAh ha. Now it's time to reel him in!\nApollo:\n(It's official: I'm scared.)\nOur client (appears after \"Wright Talent Agency\")\nApollo:\nAlright, so who's the client?\nPhoenix:\nAh, yes. Here, take a look at the map and I'll explain. Last night, I left the office just before nine o'clock... I was going to that Indochine pasta joint, Alden Tae's. I play piano there, of course. ...That's when it happened! The car sent me flying, nicked a telephone pole... ...and zoomed away. Creepy, huh?\nApollo:\nJust a tad. It's almost as creepy as hearing you tell the story like it was no big deal.\nPhoenix:\nThe car sped off in this direction... ...So, good luck!\nApollo:\n...Huh?\nPhoenix:\nYou wanted a client, didn't you? Well, I'm your client! Find the guy who knocked me into that telephone pole!\nApollo:\nWhoa, hold on! I'm a defense attorney, not a detective!\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry. Once you've found the guy, I intend to sue him. Then you can stick it to him in court!\nApollo:\n...I'm not a prosecutor either! I'm sorry, but... this is crazy. I'm going home.\nPhoenix:\nDon't get so worked up. It was just a joke.\nApollo:\nHuh?\nTrucy:\nOh, Daddy. Sorry, Apollo. He just loves jokes, you know. Even the ones that aren't very funny.\nPhoenix:\nYour real client should be stopping by the office any time now.\nApollo:\nThe office... You mean the talent agency? (No harm in going. It's not like I have anything else to do.)\nPhoenix:\n...One more thing. Do look into my accident too, would you? I marked the scene of the tragedy on this map. It's right in front of this park. Should be easy to find.\nApollo:\n(So, he's going to make me investigate this after all...)\nMap added to the Court Record.\nOur client (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nAlright, so who's the client?\nPhoenix:\nAh, yes. Here, take a look at the map and I'll explain. Last night, I left the office just before nine o'clock... I was going to that Indochine pasta joint, Alden Tae's. I play piano there, of course. ...That's when it happened! The car sent me flying, nicked a telephone pole... ...and zoomed away. Creepy, huh?\nApollo:\nJust a tad. It's almost as creepy as hearing you tell the story like it was no big deal.\nPhoenix:\nThe car sped off in this direction... ...So, good luck!\nApollo:\n...Huh?\nPhoenix:\nYou wanted a client, didn't you? Well, I'm your client! Find the guy who knocked me into that telephone pole!\nApollo:\nWhoa, hold on! I'm a defense attorney, not a detective!\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry. Once you've found the guy, I intend to sue him. Then you can stick it to him in court!\nApollo:\n...I'm not a prosecutor either! I'm sorry, but... this is crazy. I'm going home.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nWhat's that? Looks strangely familiar...\nApollo:\nHow could you not recognize an attorney's badge!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's been seven years. I've forgotten... a lot of things.\nApollo:\n(I guess some seven years are longer than others.)\nMap\nPhoenix:\nI've marked the location of the accident on your map. Find the criminal who knocked me into that telephone pole!\nAfter clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic:\nJune 15, 10:05 AMWright Talent Agency\n???:\nHey hey hey! How long you planning on making me wait, eh!?\nTrucy:\nAh! Good morning!\n???:\nHey there, Trucy-doll. Sounds like your pops had a bit of a rough spot, eh?\nTrucy:\nAll's well that ends well, I guess...\nApollo:\n(This... is our client?)\n???:\nHey! So this is that Pollo fellow, eh?\nApollo:\nOh, uh, y-yes? (The name's \"Apollo\".)\n???:\nLook at 'im there, arms all crossed-like. Ready to fight!\nApollo:\nYes, sir! ...You don't mean that literally, do you?\n???:\nThe boss told you what I need, right? Don't let me down now, Pollo!\nApollo:\nDon't worry about your defense sir, I'm on it!\n???:\nDefense...? Your noodle half-cooked? It's too late for defense! My castle's been stormed! My keep's been kept! My noodle stand's been stolen!\nApollo:\nN-Noodle...?\nTrucy:\nYou know Mr. Eldoon from the noodle stand, don'cha, Polly?\nApollo:\nNo nicknames, please. And no, of course I don't know him!\n???:\nYou new in these parts?\nApollo:\nNot really...\n???:\nThen you know the best noodles in town: Eldoon's Noodles!\nApollo:\nUh, whose noodles?\n???:\nMy noodles! Er, help me out here, Trucy-doll.\nTrucy:\nThis is Mr. Guy Eldoon... our client! Maybe you can tell us what the problem is, Mr. Eldoon?\nGuy:\nAnything for you, Trucy-doll!\nTalk\nWho's this guy?\nApollo:\nSo... You run a noodle stand, Mr....\nGuy:\nEldoon. Guy Eldoon's the name! And noodles are my game. The secret's in the soup! I've been searching for the perfect soup for a year 'n' a half.\nApollo:\nOh. That's... not that long, really.\nGuy:\nMy family's been noodle men for generations. Got a lot of expectation on my shoulders. Fifteen fathers passing the noodle to fifteen sons.\nTrucy:\nThat's a pretty old noodle!\nGuy:\nAye, and fool that I was, I pushed it away. I rebelled against my pops, and picked another livelihood. But... that didn't turn out so well.\nApollo:\nOh.\nGuy:\nThere was no denying it... Salty broth runs through these veins, boy!\nTrucy:\nSo, it was like destiny that you became what you are.\nGuy:\nRight, destiny's the word! Oh, I fought it... ...but in the end I was bound by the twisted noodle of fate!\nApollo:\n(Not a mental image I care to linger on.)\nGuy:\nSo, last year, I started my noodle stand. The 15th generation of Eldoon's Noodles!\nEldoon's Noodles\nApollo:\nUm... So tell me more about Eldoon's Noodles.\nGuy:\nYou don't know the genius that are my noodles!? I make 'em so salty, why, they're saltier than... salt!\nApollo:\n(Now I really don't want to find out.)\nTrucy:\nDaddy's a regular at his noodle stand.\nGuy:\nHe frequented my pops's stand back during his attorney days, too. Yep, him and his assistant.\nApollo:\nI'm sorry... I'll be sure to drop by your stand soon.\nGuy:\nWish you could, sonny!\nApollo:\nEh?\nGuy:\nHeck, I wish I could! I'd give anything for a bowl 'bout now.\nTrucy:\nWhat do you mean?\nGuy:\nIt was stolen! My stand! Gone!\nApollo:\nStolen...?\nStolen stand (appears after \"Eldoon's Noodles\")\nGuy:\nIt was last night... I was doing my rounds, blowin' my whistle.\nTrucy:\nIt's like an ice-cream truck's bell but louder! He even gets complaints!\nGuy:\nEh heh, now you're just trying to butter me up.\nApollo:\n(That sounded more like the blues than a whistle...)\nGuy:\nI closed up my stand for the night and parked by the house. Then, this morning, dark 'n' early... It was gone! My keep! My castle! Oooooh!\nApollo:\nMaybe some bum carted it off? ...Just guessing here.\nGuy:\nWell, I don't care who did it! Without that stand, I'm finished! All my noodle bowls were in there, too.\nTrucy:\nThat's the saddest thing I've heard all day.\nGuy:\nYou know it. Anyhows, that's the deal. Good luck!\nApollo:\nGood... huh? Wait... What exactly is your request?\nGuy:\nMy noodle stand! Find it! And the day you bring my baby back is the day you feast on as many noodles as you want! Course I make it so hot 'n' salty, two bowls'd kill a man. Then I'd really need defense!\nApollo:\nSpeaking of defense, that's what I do. I'm a lawyer. Not a detective...\nGuy:\nThis is where I live, you drop by if you need any info, 'kay? Get it back today if you can, Pollo! I got noodles to make!\nApollo:\nThings have certainly taken a turn for the bizarre. Traffic accidents... and noodle stand thieves.\nTrucy:\nUm, actually... There was something I wanted to ask you about, too, Apollo.\nApollo:\nHuh? (I have a bad feeling about this.)\nGuy:\nAh, listen to the lady's problem now. Don't be cruel!\nTrucy:\nI lost something last night. That is, something was stolen.\nGuy:\nHey, what's this? More thieving and skullduggery!?\nTrucy:\nWell, um... Someone stole a pair of my panties.\nApollo:\n...Panties?\nStolen stand (subsequent times)\nGuy:\nIt was last night... I was doing my rounds, blowin' my whistle.\nTrucy:\nIt's like an ice-cream truck's bell but louder! He even gets complaints!\nGuy:\nEh heh, now you're just trying to butter me up.\nApollo:\n(That sounded more like the blues than a whistle...)\nGuy:\nI closed up my stand for the night and parked by the house. Then, this morning, dark 'n' early... It was gone! My keep! My castle! Oooooh!\nApollo:\nMaybe some bum carted it off? ...Just guessing here.\nGuy:\nWell, I don't care who did it! Without that stand, I'm finished! All my noodle bowls were in there, too.\nTrucy's request (appears after \"Stolen stand\")\nLeads to:\n\"Erm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er...\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nGuy:\nYee haw! Attaboy! Way to flash 'em! Ol' Phoenix used to do that to my pops all the time.\nTrucy:\nYour father...?\nGuy:\nYup, he'd whip that bad boy out 'n' say \"Put it on my tab, you know I'm good for it.\"\nApollo:\n(A tab at a noodle joint?)\nAnything else\nGuy:\nSorry, fellah, but the only business I'm concerned with is my business. You gotta help me out! Get my business back!\nApollo:\nErm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er...\nTrucy:\nMy panties, yes.\nApollo:\nAh, er, right. Panties.\nGuy:\nThat's a cryin' shame, that is, Trucy-doll.\nTrucy:\nI was alone in the office last night. I had hung my panties out the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. \"Give those back!\" I shouted. \"Wait!\"\nApollo:\nWell, that was certainly brave of you.\nTrucy:\n...But I lost him. Without those panties, I don't know what I'll do...\nGuy:\nA darn cryin' shame, yup.\nTrucy:\nWell, at least the scene of the crime is convenient. I'll mark it on your map!\nGuy:\nI'll be headin' home now. Remember, find my stand or there's an empty bowl in yer future, Pollo!\nApollo:\nEr, right.\nGuy:\nAnd you help out Trucy-doll here, too, y'hear?\nTrucy:\nThings have certainly picked up, haven't they! We had no work yesterday, and now we have three cases!\nApollo:\nI... I guess.\nTrucy:\nLet's see where we stand!\nApollo:\n(Not in a courtroom, that's where.) Well, the first item on our list...\nTrucy:\nPhoenix Wright... Daddy's hit and run accident. We have to find the one who hit him!\nApollo:\n...Who's going to pay us for this again?\nTrucy:\nAnd the second item... Mr. Eldoon's request.. to find his stolen stand.\nApollo:\nFor which we stand to gain... a bowl of salty noodles...\nTrucy:\nAnd the last request is mine! To find my stolen panties!\nApollo:\n...That bowl of noodles is looking better and better.\nTrucy:\nLet's go, Polly! To the streets!\nApollo:\nAren't you enthusiastic.\nTrucy:\nHow could I not be!? Let's crack these cases, you and me!\nApollo:\n(*sigh* Guess we might as well get started... Let's see. A hit and run... a stolen stand... And last but not least... stolen panties.)\nAfter clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then visiting Wright Talent Agency:\nJune 15Hickfield Clinic\nApollo:\nHuh? Mr. Wright's gone.\nTrucy:\nMaybe he's gone for an examination?\nApollo:\nHe'll probably be back soon. Let's wait.\nTrucy:\nI think it might take some time. Daddy always loves his examinations!\nApollo:\n(Don't ask, Justice. You don't want to know.)\nTrucy:\nWhy don't we come back later?\nApollo:\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nExamine\nBottle\nApollo:\nA bottle of Mr. Wright's favorite brand of grape juice. After that trial, I'll never drink grape juice again. Clearly not a problem for Mr. Wright, however.\nDVD stack\nApollo:\nA swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. It looks ready to collapse. Better keep my distance.\nHospital bed\nApollo:\nMr. Wright's bed. Wow, what a mess. Trucy must be in charge of cleaning at home.\nPiano\nApollo:\nA small, children's piano. I guess the man likes pink.\nTelevision\nApollo:\nThe television's been left on... to an episode of the Steel Samurai. That's the same episode as before. Must be his favorite.\nWright Talent Agency\nTalk\nPanty-snatcher\nApollo:\n(Maybe I should ask her more about her... uh... This is going to be difficult--)\nTrucy:\nApollo!\nApollo:\nYeah?\nTrucy:\nYour [sic] going to have to press me for information! Go ahead, do your worst!\nApollo:\nUh, no thanks, I pass.\nTrucy:\nYou can't \"pass\"! This is your job! Look, I had hung them outside the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. \"Give those back!\" I shouted. \"Wait!\" ...But I lost him. I can't live without those panties! Please find them!\nAny leads?\nApollo:\nWell? Do we have any leads?\nTrucy:\nHmm... One moment... ... Allakazam! Allakazing!\nApollo:\n(Whoa! Where'd all this evidence come from?)\nTrucy:\n...\nApollo:\nUm... So what happens next?\nTrucy:\nThat's it! Pretty neat, huh?\nApollo:\n...Yeah. Neat. (*sigh*)\nPresent\nAnything\nTrucy:\nWhat's that, Polly? Oh, I know! You want to see a magic trick! Well, you've come to the right girl! Watch as I make that evidence disappear, forever!\nApollo:\nWhoa! No, don't! Sorry, my bad!\nJune 15Accident Scene\nApollo:\nSo this is where Mr. Wright got hit by that car?\nTrucy:\nAccording to the map, this is the place!\nApollo:\nWhat a huge mansion... (Changed from [What a huge mansion... Feels like Chinatown.] in the original release)\nTrucy:\nApollo! There's a nice-looking lady over there. Let's question her!\nApollo:\nUm, OK. (I'm a little curious about the park over there, too...)\nTrucy:\nExcuse me! Um, can we have a few words with you?\n???:\nYou want something?\nApollo:\n(Whoa! That husky voice... Why am I suddenly sweating?)\nTrucy:\nThat's quite a house you've got there! You must have a lot of money...\n???:\nWhoooh. \"Money\" sounds like something my son would call his friends. This is the Kitaki Family mansion, little girl.\nApollo:\nEh.\n???:\nYou, kid with the hair. You want something?\nApollo:\nUrk! M-M-Me? No, not a thing! Bye!\nTrucy:\nApollo! We can't leave without questioning her! What if she knows something!\nApollo:\nB-But th-the Kitaki Family...! (They're the biggest organized crime syndicate in town!)\n???:\nIf you're going to ask something, ask it. If you're man enough.\nApollo:\nWaaaaugh! R-Right!\nTrucy:\nYay! Way to whip him into shape, ma'am!\nApollo:\n(Does she know no fear!?)\nPlum:\nI'm Plum. Plum Kitaki. Wife of the fourth head of the Kitaki Family business. Friends call me Little Plum.\nApollo:\nI-I'm l-little Apollo Justice, attorney at law. *gulp* (If looks could kill, this woman would be a mass-murderer by now...)\nExamine\nMansion front gate\nTrucy:\nWow, what a big house! And the gate is so big...\nApollo:\nThe Kitaki Family is pretty big around these parts.\nTrucy:\nI like the fox! It's so cute!\nPlum:\nAh, that. That's our family crest... from the old country.\nTrucy:\nYour family \"crest\"?\nPlum:\nWe're clever as the fox... and our teeth are sharp.\nTrucy:\nSo it's like a motto! You need a crest, too, Apollo! Ooh! How about the scales of justice? Or a lunar lander!\nApollo:\n(...I'll pass, thanks.)\nMansion gate wall\nApollo:\nA brightly painted dragon. Why do I get the feeling he's glaring at me? Those paints must have been to repaint this wall.\nPlum:\nThat's right. I called in an artist to do the job right. ...He's the third so far.\nApollo:\nThe... third?\nPlum:\nThe first spilled paint all over the entrance here, the second on my kimono... So I...\nApollo:\nN-No, don't tell me. It's better that I don't know.\nSpilled paint\nApollo:\nThere's paint splashed all over this gate. (What a mess...)\nTrucy:\nWas this paint knocked over by the car that hit my Daddy?\nPlum:\nThat's right. Feh. And I'm left to clean up the mess. If you find whoever did this, bring the scoundrel by, would you?\nTrucy:\nOf course! Then you can make them clean up their own mess!\nPlum:\nAh ha ha ha! You're cute. Naïve, but cute. When I find whoever did this, you can bet I'll be doing some \"cleaning\". There's nothing I dislike so much... as a mess.\nTrucy:\nOoh! I wish I could say cool things like that!\nPlum:\nI'll bet you do! Wa ha ha ha ha!!!\nApollo:\n(I'd laugh if my teeth weren't chattering so hard.)\nTalk\nThe Kitakis\nTrucy:\nLittle Plum? That's a really cute name for someone so...\nPlum:\nYes...?\nApollo:\nWh-Whoa!\nTrucy:\nWhat is it, Apollo?\nApollo:\nHow about you go through me when talking to her, OK, Trucy?\nTrucy:\nHuh? That seems like a bit of a needless procedure.\nApollo:\nI'm a lawyer. I live for needless procedures.\nPlum:\nOh little girl, you should know... We're gangsters.\nTrucy:\nGangst... Oh! That means you're the bad guys!\nApollo:\nTrucy! Through me! Please! I'm begging you here!\nPlum:\nWa ha ha ha ha!!! The bad guys... I like the sound of that!\nApollo:\n(...I'm going to need some warm tea after this.)\nPlum:\nIt takes a lot of hard work to protect a family fortune. Things aren't as easy as they used to be for us \"bad guys\".\nTrucy:\nSo, you're saying that business is in a slump?\nApollo:\n(Let's not ask about \"business if we can help it, please?)\nLast night's accident\nApollo:\nSo, there was supposedly a car accident here last night. (Changed from [There was a car accident here last night?] in the original release)\nPlum:\nLast night...\nApollo:\nOf c-course you wouldn't know about it! S-Sorry to bother you!\nPlum:\nWait.\nApollo:\nY-Yes?\nPlum:\nYou're talking about that man, aren't you? The one who flew thirty feet and just walked away?\nTrucy:\nThat's my daddy!\nPlum:\nAh ha ha! I should've known! One of our Capos thought he'd make a great point man...\nTrucy:\nCapo? Point man...?\nApollo:\nUm, could you avoid using too much, er, industry lingo?\nPlum:\nIn any case, it's been nothing but trouble. I've been cleaning up this mess since morning! Bah!\nApollo:\nCleaning up this... paint?\nSplattered paint (appears after \"Last night's accident\")\nApollo:\nWas this paint spilled at the time of the accident?\nPlum:\nIt was around 9 last night. I heard a crashing noise... ...and found your father drowning in a sea of paint.\nTrucy:\nSo you came to his rescue?\nPlum:\nYou've my husband... the Boss to thank for that. The car that hit your father knocked over this paint... ...then turned the corner, and sped away. We're in the middle of repainting our wall, you see.\nApollo:\n(I'm sure that dragon is glaring at me.)\nTrucy:\nBut, why are you out here cleaning it up?\nPlum:\nWhat do you mean?\nTrucy:\nI mean, aren't you a gangster? Don't you have any \"goons\" to do your dirty work for you?\nApollo:\nPlease! Go through me when you want to...\nPlum:\nWa ha ha ha ha!!! Don't be such a stiff, lawyer-boy. I suppose we gangsters do have a certain image...\nApollo:\nUrm, yes.\nPlum:\nBut we're community-oriented gangsters, you see. ...The Boss likes to give back to the people, see?\nApollo:\n(How noble of him...)\nPlum:\nI availed myself of the public facilities to get rid of all the garbage... Now there's just the paint on the street to deal with.\nApollo:\n(Public facilities...? I wonder if she means that trash can...)\nPresent\nAnything\nPlum:\nSorry, kid. I got no idea what you're talking about.\nAfter switching to right side view:\nApollo:\nWho's that!? She's looking at the park.\nTrucy:\nShe's pretty. I bet she has a story, you know?\nApollo:\n(There is something about her... Too bad she seems to be in a bit of a rush.)\nExamine\nOld lady\nApollo:\n...Looks like there's some trouble by the park gate.\nTrucy:\nI smell an incident!\nOfficer:\nMa'am! There's no entry to the park!\nOld Lady:\nNow don't you tell me where I can't go, young fella! I always walk through this park on my way home!\nOfficer:\nPlease, get down from there! You'll hurt yourself, ma'am!\nApollo:\n(That's quite the determined old lady.)\nPeople Park sign\nApollo:\nPeople Park... Huh, kind of an odd name for such an empty place.\nTrucy:\nI wonder why it's named that? Hey! There's something written on the gate post...\nApollo:\nHuh? Oh yeah... It says, \"Donated by Big Wins Kitaki\".\nTrucy:\nYou mean the Kitaki Family built this park? It's so nice of them to give to the community like that!\nApollo:\n...Let's not get too friendly with them, shall we? (A gangster building a park...? Odd move for a crime boss.)\nPolice officer below People Park sign\nApollo:\nPersonally, I'm a little more interested in this park.\nTrucy:\nYou know what I think? I bet they're filming a movie. Let's go take a look! Maybe we'll see someone famous!\nOfficer:\nHey, Miss! Stay out of the park!\nTrucy:\n...He got mad at me.\nApollo:\nUm, did something happen here, officer?\nOfficer:\nHuh? Uh, no, move along, nothing to see. Why don't you kids go play someplace else?\nApollo:\nWe're not kids and we're not playing! I'm an attorney!\n???:\n...Something wrong?\nOfficer:\nAh, Detective Skye! We're fine ma'am, nothing to report!\nApollo:\n(Detective...?)\nTrucy:\nWhy's she wearing a lab coat?\nApollo:\nYou're hardly one to comment on how people are dressed.\n???:\nAnd... these kids are?\nOfficer:\nCuriosity seekers, ma'am. They claim to be \"lawyers\".\n???:\nAh. Why don't you kids run along and play someplace else?\nApollo:\nLook, we're not...\n???:\nOr I might spill something on that pretty face of yours. Want a dose of experimental Hydroxyacelunodosetrase?\nTrucy:\n...Come again? What's Hydroxy... stuff?\nApollo:\nWhatever it is, it doesn't sound good. Let's go, Trucy!\n???:\nTry to keep out the riff-raff, if you would.\nOfficer:\nYes ma'am!\nApollo:\nGrr... How are we going to get more information like this?\nTrucy:\nWhy don't we ask that nice woman across the street?\nApollo:\n(Oh yes, that nice woman... *gulp*)\nPolice officer below People Park sign (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nI gotta say, I'd really like to know what happened here...\nOfficer:\nHey, I said no one goes in! Unless you want a face-full of hydroxyadayadawhatzit!\nApollo:\n(Hmm... No dice.)\nTrash can\nApollo:\nThere's a big trash can on the way into the park. I guess we could check it out...\nTrucy:\nA detective's life sure is a hard one!\nApollo:\nI'm an attorney, actua... Huh?\nTrucy:\nHmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them.\nApollo:\nThese... are slippers. They look like those slippers you get at the hospital...\nTrucy:\nLook at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...?\nApollo:\nIt's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone.\nTrucy:\nWait, you don't think...\nApollo:\nI do. This could be from the car that hit Mr. Wright!\nTrucy:\nWow, and he took off its mirror? I never knew Daddy was so strong. I only have room in my pocket for one of these, though. Which do you want to take?\nSlippers\nSlippers crammed into pocket.\nLeads back to examination\nMirror\nMirror slipped into pocket.\nLeads back to examination\nTrash can (subsequent times, if Slippers is added to the Court Record)\nApollo:\nThere's a side-view mirror with some paint on it in this trash can.\nTrucy:\nI can only carry one thing at a time in my pocket, you know.\nApollo:\n(Should I swap the slippers for the mirror?)\nSwap\nApollo:\nSure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would.\nTrucy:\nI'm on it!\nMirror slipped into pocket.\nLeads back to examination\nNo need\nApollo:\n...On second thought, let's not and say we did.\nLeads back to examination\nTrash can (subsequent times, if Mirror is added to the Court Record)\nApollo:\nThere's some paint on the slippers in this trash can.\nTrucy:\nI can only carry one thing at a time in my pocket, you know.\nApollo:\n(Should I swap the mirror for the slippers?)\nSwap\nApollo:\nSure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would.\nTrucy:\nRight-o!\nSlippers crammed into pocket.\nLeads back to examination\nNo need\nApollo:\nActually... let's not and say we did.\nLeads back to examination\nTalk\nPeople Park (appears after examining police officer below People Park sign)\nApollo:\n...Can I ask you a question?\nPlum:\nWhat?\nApollo:\n...What happened in the park across the street?\nPlum:\nOh, yes, quite the commotion. \"Chicago Lightning\", as the Boss would say.\nTrucy:\nChicago... huh?\nPlum:\nGunfire. Someone was killed. Strange circumstances, too.\nApollo:\nYou're kidding!\nPlum:\nWhat a morning! Trouble everywhere. The park, the gate, even our house...\nTrucy:\nDid something happen at your house, too?\nPlum:\nA crime without honor! Without remorse! It's a private matter... Wanna hear about it?\nTrucy:\nSomehow I don't think \"no\" is an acceptable answer, Polly.\nA private matter (appears after \"People Park\")\nApollo:\nSo... what happened at your house?\nPlum:\nBloomers. Last night.\nApollo:\nEh. (I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPlum:\nMe, Little Plum Kitaki, the victim of a panty-snatcher!\nTrucy:\nWhaaaaaaat? So it wasn't just my panties that were stolen!?\nPlum:\nGot you too, did they? Poor thing. Like I said, whoever did this is a hardened criminal. It wasn't you, was it!?\nApollo:\nN-No! Of course not! Mercy!\nPlum:\nI've heard word that panties have been disappearing lately. ...And the missing panties all have something in common.\nApollo:\n(It's hard to imagine Trucy's and Mrs. Kitaki's panties having much in common... I just imagined Mrs. Kitaki's panties... *gulp*)\nTrucy:\nI know! We'll find your bloomers, too!\nPlum:\nGreat! Show me what you're made of.\nApollo:\n(What have you gotten me into this time, Trucy?)\nPresent\nMirror\nApollo:\nCan you tell me anything about this mirror?\nPlum:\nThat's probably from the car that knocked that fellow across the street.\nApollo:\n(Right! That makes this a valuable clue!)\nPlum:\nLet me know if you find that car, would you? You splash Kitaki paint, you pay the price.\nExamine evidence\nSlippers\nToeprint\nApollo:\nHuh? This spot here is black.\nTrucy:\nI wonder what that is...? It doesn't look like paint...\nLeaf indentation on paint on left sole\nTrucy:\nThe bottom is covered with paint!\nApollo:\nHuh? What's this weird shape here?\nTrucy:\nIt looks like a leaf was stuck to the bottom when the wearer stepped in some yellow paint.\nApollo:\nSo the outline was left when the leaf was removed! Ack! I got paint on my hand!\nTrucy:\n...... Apollo! I saw you try to wipe your hand on my cape!\nMirror\nSevered wires\nTrucy:\nIt's cut clean off! I wonder what's in there...?\nApollo:\nDon't. There are bare wires hanging out.\nTrucy:\nLet's see... Zzzzzzaaaaap! Eeek!\nApollo:\nWha--!? A-Are you OK!?\nTrucy:\nHee hee! Just a little joke!\nApollo:\n...... Don't scare me like that!\nTrucy:\nYou mean, don't \"shock\" you? Zzzzzzaaaaap! Hee hee!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\n???:\n...\nApollo:\n(...That girl from before!)\nPlum:\nOh! Welcome home, sweetie.\n???:\nAh, uh... hello, m-mother.\nApollo:\n(She's a Kitaki, too!?)\nTrucy:\nUh, um, Miss! Miss!\n???:\n...?\nTrucy:\nHere, our flyer.\n???:\nThe... Wright Anything Agency?\nApollo:\nA-Anything Agency?\nTrucy:\nYeah! Do you like the new flyer? So, um, this is our defense attorney, Mr. Apollo Justice!\n???:\nAttorney...?\nTrucy:\nDrop by our office! We'll be waiting!\n???:\nAh... Good-bye.\nApollo:\nWhy did you give her our flyer?\nTrucy:\nI dunno. She seemed like she could use some help.\nApollo:\nShe's the heiress to a gangster dynasty! She doesn't need our help!\nTrucy:\n...I wouldn't be so sure!\nApollo:\n...?\nJune 15Scene of the Stand Theft\nApollo:\nSo... what's this place?\nTrucy:\nThis would be Mr. Eldoon's house, silly.\nApollo:\nOh, so this is where his stand was stolen from. I can see a piece of evidence lying on the ground already.\nTrucy:\n...Hey! Look, there's a police car parked over there.\nApollo:\nYou're right... What's with the sparkly... entrance? What is this place? A hospital? There's a sign... \"Meraktis Clinic\".\nTrucy:\nHmm... Oh! That's where the thief went!\nApollo:\nThe thief...?\nTrucy:\nThe one who snatched my panties! He ran into this clinic last night! Wait, maybe that police car is here to find my panties!\nApollo:\nI doubt it.\nTrucy:\nWell, there's only one way to be sure! Let's investigate!\nGuy:\nAh, there you are, sonny! Well, you find anything yet!?\nApollo:\nEr, um, no. Not yet.\nGuy:\nThe longer you loaf around here the saltier your victory bowl gets, just remember that!\nApollo:\n(This bowl of noodles is sounding less like payment and more like punishment...)\nExamine\nClinic front door\nTrucy:\nThat doorway sure is sparkly!\nApollo:\nThe \"Meraktis Clinic\", huh. Looks more like a casino parlor than a hospital. They must be quite profitable.\nTrucy:\nFunny, it looks closed. Maybe they're on vacation today?\nGreen banner\nApollo:\nLooks like they have a special offer going on...\nTrucy:\n\"Three shots for the price of one!\" Ooh, now's our chance, Apollo!\nApollo:\nChance for what!? I don't need any shots, thank you. Whoever runs this clinic, they seem pretty business-minded.\nPolice car\nApollo:\nI'd understand if there was an ambulance outside... But a police car?\nTrucy:\nMaybe they're tax evaders!\nOfficer:\nAh, sorry miss. No going into the clinic today.\nTrucy:\nDid something happen?\nOfficer:\nHuh? Oh, no. Nothing to see here. Move along. You'll have to find someplace else to play doctor.\nApollo:\n(Do we look like the right age to be playing doctor!?) We need a little more info on this Meraktis Clinic.\nTrucy:\nWe could ask Mr. Eldoon. He is their neighbor and all. And we should check out that garage! What if the thief who stole my panties is still in there!?\nApollo:\n...*sigh*\nBlue tarp\nGuy:\nThat's the place! Right there! That's where I kept my stand. Covered all nice 'n' purty with that blue tarp there!\nApollo:\nSo you used this plastic sheet to cover your stand at night? ...I see.\nTrucy:\nYou see? What? Did you figure out why it was stolen!?\nApollo:\nWell no, but it does suggest that the thief knew what he or she was looking for. They clearly knew what was under that sheet.\nGuy:\nSo it wasn't one of those casual drive-by stand snatchers, you mean? Not bad, sonny-boy. Not bad at all!\nBowl\nApollo:\nIs this yours, Mr. Eldoon?\nGuy:\nHey! That there's the heart and soul of Eldoon's Noodles! The bowl absorbs my salty soup... Pretty soon it's gonna taste just like noodles!\nTrucy:\nWow! It does smell like noodles!\nGuy:\nAll my other bowls got taken away with my stand! Get it back for me, sonny-boy, I'm beggin' ya!\nBowl added to the Court Record.\nBowl (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nIs this yours, Mr. Eldoon?\nGuy:\nHey! That there's the heart and soul of Eldoon's Noodles! The bowl absorbs my salty soup... Pretty soon it's gonna taste just like noodles!\nTrucy:\nWow! It does smell like noodles!\nGuy:\nAll my other bowls got taken away with my stand! Get it back for me, sonny-boy, I'm beggin' ya!\nHouse\nTrucy:\nThis house is... well, it's old!\nGuy:\nIt's been well-loved, that's for sure. I've lived here with my wife for many years now. It's got character, though, just like my soup!\nApollo:\n(I always thought character was a positive thing.)\n\"NOO\" sign\nApollo:\n...That's quite a sign. I take it that's \"NOO\" as opposed to \"OLD\"?\nGuy:\nAh, you like it? Made it myself, I did. I meant to write \"Noodles\" but ran outta space.\nTrucy:\nPrior planning prevents poor performance!\nGuy:\nLucky for me it spells a word all by itself! And spruces up my image, it does!\nApollo:\n(It does have a certain power of willful denial thing going for it.)\nOil drum\nApollo:\nIt looks like the oil drum is connected to that sink over there...\nTrucy:\nCollecting rainwater to do the dishes! How environmentally conscious!\nApollo:\nYou... don't think he uses rainwater to cook his noodles and to make the broth, do you?\nTrucy:\nOh I'm sure he finds the best water money can buy! Taste is his business, you know. Look, that sign over there! \"Eldoon's only uses water from all-natural sources!\"\nApollo:\n... (I think I'll take a rain check on eating here.)\nSign under oil drum\nApollo:\nThere's a hand-written sign here... \"Save the light!\"\nTrucy:\n\"Save the light!\" indeed! Mr. Eldoon's house is practically in the dark here!\nApollo:\nI guess the hospital clinic next door blocks the sunlight.\nGuy:\nEverything's gone wrong since they built this monstrosity! Broth needs sun or it rots! What's a man to do? They just want my customers to get food poisoning so they can turn a pretty profit...\nApollo:\n(That seems like a lot of trouble to go through for a few extra patients...)\nDog\nTrucy:\nLook! A doggy! Good boy, good boy, Salty!\nApollo:\nI'm sure the dog has a real name, Trucy.\nGuy:\nYup, sure does! Name's Spoon. And it's a she, by the way.\nTrucy:\nSpoon doesn't seem so lively.\nGuy:\nShe didn't get her bowl of salty broth this mornin', that's why. Poor lil' thing. *sniff*\nTrucy:\nApollo! Let's find that stand soon! For Spoon's sake!\nApollo:\n(I'm pretty sure dogs aren't supposed to eat noodles...)\nTalk\nEldoon's Noodles\nApollo:\nSo, your stand... \"Eldoon's Noodles\", was it?\nGuy:\nAye! Passed down from father to son. That stand's seen its share o' salt, mmm-hmm. Salt runs in the family, you might say.\nApollo:\n(I bet high blood pressure does too.) So... your stand, Eldoon's Noodles, was stolen...\nGuy:\nOh, it wasn't just the stand that was stolen, sonny-boy! I lost those wobbly wheels, my salt-crusted stewpot, my stained sign... I didn't just lose a stand, I lost a legend!\nTrucy:\nNo one steals a legend and gets away with it on my watch! Let's find that legend, Apollo!\nApollo:\n(Isn't it about time he bought a new one anyway?)\nStolen stand\nApollo:\nAre there any more details you could give me about the stand?\nGuy:\nYou bet, sonny-boy! It happened last night... I was blowing my whistle like always, crying the town, I was. The smell of broth filled the streets... thick 'n' salty. I got home, well, right before 10 PM, I reckon.\nApollo:\n(Guess he's not aiming for that late-night market.)\nGuy:\nI washed my bowls and gave the wheels a squirt of grease. Then I went inside.\nApollo:\nWhen did you notice it had been stolen?\nGuy:\nEarly this morning. Before the sun rose. Work starts early!\nApollo:\n(Do that many people eat noodles for breakfast!?)\nGuy:\nI'm washed up on the salty shores of ruination! That stand had my whole life in it... nay, my whole being!\nTrucy:\nThey took everything?\nGuy:\nAll my soup stock, my noodles, my bowls... and my dreams!\nTrucy:\nAt least they left one bowl. Look, there, on the ground.\nGuy:\nIf you don't find that stand today... Then I'll be forced to walk the streets, peddling that bowl... my last bowl.\nApollo:\nPlease, I'm under enough pressure here as it is.\nThe garage\nTrucy:\nThat's it! That's where the thief who snatched my panties ran to!\nGuy:\nIt's a crying shame, that is. If they have to steal, make it my loincloth! Not some pretty girl's panties!\nApollo:\nThe garage, right. You don't think the thief lives here, do you?\nGuy:\nFeh! I wouldn't put it past that good-for-nothing doctor!\nApollo:\n(Hmm... Do I detect a little animosity here?)\nTrucy:\nLet's make sure to check out that garage thoroughly!\nMeraktis Clinic (appears after examining police car)\nTrucy:\nHey, do you think something happened next door? There's a police car out front...\nGuy:\nFeh! Probably gave someone food poisoning, I'll bet!\nApollo:\n(If anyone's at risk of giving someone food poisoning...)\nGuy:\nThat police car got here this mornin', actually. I asked what they were up to, but they wouldn't even tell me, the neighbor! Feh!\nTrucy:\nHmm...\nGuy:\nNot that I was surprised much. That doctor works for the wrong crowd. It was just a matter of time 'fore he got what was coming to him. Feh!\nApollo:\nThe \"wrong crowd\"...?\nGuy:\n...Never you mind about that.\nPresent\nBowl\nGuy:\nYou can tell my bowls by the Mr. Salty logo!\nTrucy:\nThe mascot of Eldoon's Noodles!\nGuy:\nThey come to the stand, they sit, they drink deep from that bowl... ...and when they see the  bottom, their face looks jus' like Mr. Salty's! Genius, no!?\nTrucy:\nVery high-concept.\nGuy:\nYou can't ply a trade if you don't love the tools. Remember that!\nTrucy:\nYes sir!\nApollo:\n(Trucy has a thing for professionals, clearly.)\nAnything else\nGuy:\nSorry, sonny-boy. My interest is for my stand and precious little else. Get cracking on that case! Find my stand, I'm beggin' ya!\nExamine evidence\nBowl\nInside of bowl\nTrucy:\nIt's the Eldoon's Noodle's mascot! Mr. Salty! He's so cute!\nApollo:\nIt's not a very endearing mascot, is it?\nTrucy:\nYou know... Come to think of it... ...It looks a lot like you, Apollo. Especially the red parts.\nApollo:\nCan I help if I like red?\nBottom of bowl\nTrucy:\nOoh, look! I love these little personal touches!\nApollo:\nSeems a shame to hide it on the bottom of the bowl. ...Huh? When I touched it the paint flaked off.\nTrucy:\nHe must have painted it on by hand with warm, professional care!\nApollo:\nAfter buying the cheapest paint he could find with cold professional thrift.\nJune 15Meraktis ClinicGarage\nTrucy:\nThis is the place! This is where that panty-snatcher ran!\nApollo:\nAre you sure?\nTrucy:\nMaybe! Let's look for clues! Clues... to a panty-snatching! Clues... like a pair of panties!\nApollo:\n...Um, Trucy? Could you try not saying \"panties\" so many times?\nExamine\nCar\nApollo:\nThere's something about this car...\nTrucy:\nLet's take a closer look!\nCell phone\nApollo:\nLook... a cell phone.\nTrucy:\nSomeone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure!\nApollo:\nHmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here?\nTrucy:\nWe should bring it to him later!\nCell Phone added to the Court Record.\nStub on driver's door\nTrucy:\nHey! Look at that!\nApollo:\nThe mirror's been broken off! (Now THIS is a clue!)\nTrucy:\nWhat!? You're smiling like you know something I don't... You aren't keeping a clue from me, are you, Polly?\nApollo:\n(A clue? Let's see...)\nShow evidence\nApollo:\nI think I do have just the clue you've got in mind...\nPresent Mirror\nApollo:\nApollo:\nMy clue is... this!\nTrucy:\nWhoa! It's the same color and size and everything! A perfect match!\nApollo:\nI guess we could check it out...\nTrucy:\nHmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them. Look at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...?\nApollo:\nIt's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone.\nApollo:\nWell... looks like we've just solved a case.\nTrucy:\nSo the car that hit Daddy last night...\nApollo:\n...Is sitting right in front of us, yep.\nTrucy:\nWow. You put the \"pro\" in \"professional\", Apollo!\nApollo:\nGee, thanks, Trucy.\nLeads back to examination\nPresent anything else\nApollo:\nTrucy:\n... That's your clue? Sorry, but that leaves me feeling kind of... clueless.\nApollo:\n(Like father like daughter with the humor, apparently.)\nTrucy:\nThere's no need to bluff here, Apollo! Save that for the court!\nApollo:\n(Thanks for the advice...)\nLeads back to examination\nNo evidence\nApollo:\nHmm. Not that I can think of.\nTrucy:\nNo? Then what were you smiling about?\nApollo:\nOh, I wasn't smiling. It was the dust in here. I thought I was going to sneeze... Ah... ah... ah... WAACHOOO!\nTrucy:\nWell, don't make faces that ah... AH-CHOO! ...are so misleading then.\nApollo:\n(I know yawns are contagious, but sneezes...?)\nTrucy:\nMmm. Well, I'm sure there's gotta be a clue somewhere! Let's keep checking things out!\nLeads back to examination\nStub on driver's door (after correctly presenting Mirror)\nApollo:\nThis mirror fits this car door perfectly...\nTrucy:\nSo the car that hit Daddy last night...\nApollo:\n...Is sitting right in front of us, yep.\nTrucy:\nWow. You put the \"pro\" in \"professional\", Apollo!\nTailpipe (before examining cell phone and stub on driver's door)\nApollo:\nThat reminds me... I once read a record of a case that Mr. Wright worked on many years ago.\nTrucy:\n...?\nApollo:\nApparently, there was this car with a piece of cloth shoved into the tailpipe! That piece of cloth turned out to be a vital clue to solving the case!\nTrucy:\nWow!\nApollo:\nI remember that case record whenever I'm checking out a car... And I always check the tailpipe!\nTrucy:\nEveryone's gotta have a hobby, I guess.\nApollo:\nWouldn't it be funny if... ...Hey! There's something in there!\nTrucy:\nWhat!?\nApollo:\nW-Wait a second... Are these your...\nTrucy:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! My panties!!!\nApollo:\nWhaaaat!? Already!?\nTrucy:\nWow, thank you, Apollo! You're a genius! Amazing!\nApollo:\nNo, no, really, don't mention it.\nTrucy:\nNo, I'm serious, I'm really impressed! You must have a nose for finding girls' panties!\nApollo:\n... Um, what are those?\nTrucy:\nMy little panties, of course! They've come home to mama! I can't wait to use them!\nApollo:\nY-You're going to put them on? N-Now!?\nTrucy:\nWatch closely now... See? Nothing in the panties... ...Ta-da!!!\nApollo:\nWhoa! Wh-Where'd that come from!? How did that bowl get in your panties!?\nTrucy:\nMy panties are an extra-dimensional space... Anything can fit in there! ...They're my Magic Panties! It's one of my best tricks.\nApollo:\nMagic... panties?\nTrucy:\nThey love them over at the Wonder Bar. I do shows there nightly.\nApollo:\n...You mean those panties are a prop!? You could have told me a little sooner!\nTrucy's Panties put discreetly away in Trucy's pocket.\nApollo:\nWell, that's once case closed, at least.\nTrucy:\nWhat are you saying!? We still have to catch the sly devil that ran off with the tool of my trade!\nApollo:\nOh, right. (Something tells me we're not finished searching this garage, anyway...)\nTailpipe (after examining cell phone and stub on driver's door)\nApollo:\nThat reminds me...

We still have to catch the sly devil that ran off with the tool of my trade!\nApollo:\nOh, right.\nTailpipe (subsequent times, before examining cell phone and stub on driver's door)\nApollo:\nStill, I'm glad. If I hadn't picked up that habit of looking up tailpipes... ...I might never have seen your panties. I mean, found your panties. Magic panties.\nTrucy:\nI know, it was amazing how you slyly peeked up there! I think you have a successful career in peeking up tailpipes ahead of you!\nApollo:\n(I'm so glad all of this makes sense in context.)\nTrucy:\nYou gotta wonder why my panties were here, though.\nApollo:\nThat is a mystery...

A kitty-cat! Here, kitty kitty kitty.\nMeow.\nTrucy:\n...It's not coming down.\nApollo:\nWe do look kind of suspicious, you have to admit.\nTrucy:\nIt's OK kitty-cat! His hair won't hurt you!\nApollo:\nIt's OK kitty-cat! She won't make you disappear in her hat!\n(Step)ladder\nApollo:\nLook, it's a folding ladder.\nTrucy:\nPolly! That's called a \"stepladder\"! C'mon!\nApollo:\n...A stepladder? How is that different from a regular ladder then?\nTrucy:\nIt's a much more complex piece of machinery. It's like two ladders stuck together!\nApollo:\n...So you admit that basically it's a ladder, right?\nTrucy:\nWait... Huh?\nApollo:\nYou have to look past the form... at the essence of the thing.\nTrucy:\nEr... Can we talk about something else?\nSkeleton\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeek! Someone's there! ... Oh, it's just a gold-painted human skeleton.\nApollo:\n(Just a human skeleton!? ...And painted gold?)\nTrucy:\nThere's a mannequin hand waving to us from the box behind the skeleton. This place just screams \"hospital storage\", don't you think?\nApollo:\nIt screams something, that's for sure.\nExamine evidence\nCell Phone\nStrap\nTrucy:\nLook at this cute little watch-strap! I want one!\nApollo:\n...It's kind of odd, though.\nTrucy:\nWhat is?\nApollo:\nI mean, if you wanted to know the time, you could just look at the phone itself.\nTrucy:\nHey, you're right! Sharp, Apollo!\nApollo:\nTh-Thanks. (Finally, some respect!)\nTrucy:\nSo, what does that tell you?\nApollo:\nWell, the owner of this phone doesn't think through the details, for one.\nTrucy:\nThey did drop their phone, after all. I kinda figured they were a little spacey already.\nApollo:\nOh... good point.\nTrucy's Panties\nRibbon\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\nSomething the matter?\nApollo:\nUh... I was just wondering if there was, like, a switch on these...\nTrucy:\nOf course not!\nApollo:\n...Huh. Mysterious.\nTrucy:\nOh? Do you want to know the secret of my panties?\nApollo:\nAck! N-No! No thanks! (Who uses magic panties in a stage show anyway...?)\nAfter examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door:\nTrucy:\nApollo!\nApollo:\nHuh? What is it?\nTrucy:\nNow that we've solved this case, we should go report to Daddy! He'll mope if we leave him alone too long, knowing him.\nApollo:\nUm, OK. ...He doesn't seem the type to mope, though. (And this is hardly a case worth reporting...)\nExamine\nCar\nApollo:\nThis car belongs to someone at the Meraktis Clinic... and it hit Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright sprained his ankle, and the car lost a side-view mirror. This car vs. Mr. Wright... Not quite the match of the century.\nWright Anything Agency\nTalk\nPanty-snatcher (after Trucy's Panties is added to the Court Record)\nTrucy:\nWhat, you want to see them again? Well, if you must...\nApollo:\nNo no no, I'm fine, really. Let's just put them away, shall we? Case closed.\nTrucy:\nWhat are you talking about!? The case isn't closed until we have our thief! Just find him on the side while you work on the other cases!\nApollo:\nIf it were that easy we wouldn't need the police.\nTrucy:\nIf we don't need the police... then we don't need defense attorneys, either, right?\nApollo:\n(Fine, fine. I'll look for your panty-snatcher...)\nPresent\nTrucy's Panties\nTrucy:\nI'm so glad we found my panties!\nApollo:\nI had no idea they were so important to you.\nTrucy:\nAnd in time for tonight's show, too! A lot of people come just to see my panties, you know!\nApollo:\nYou... might not want to advertise it like that.\nTrucy:\n?\nKitaki Mansion\nExamine\nTrash can (after Mirror is updated in the Court Record)\nApollo:\nThere's a big waste basket by the park entrance.\nTrucy:\n...? You aren't going to search through the trash?\nApollo:\nI don't think we need to.\nTrucy:\nOh, no, please, knock yourself out. Don't mind me, I'll be waiting over here.\nApollo:\nJust so we're clear, searching through trash isn't a hobby of mine, OK?\nPresent\nMirror (after Mirror is updated in the Court Record)\nApollo:\nI found out who this mirror belongs to.\nPlum:\nOoh. You're tougher than you look. Spit it out. Who was it? Where do they live?\nApollo:\nUrk! I j-just forgot! Heh!\nTrucy:\nI remember, Apollo! It was the Meraktis Clinic!\nApollo:\nShhhh!\nTrucy:\nWhy? I'm right, aren't I?\nPlum:\n...Meraktis, eh?\nApollo:\nUm, yes. (Why's she so quiet all of a sudden?) ... Is something wrong?\nPlum:\nErm, no. Pay me no mind. And thanks for the info.\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage:\nJune 15Hickfield Clinic\nPhoenix:\nYo! How goes it?\nTrucy:\nDaddy! How do you feel?\nPhoenix:\nNot bad, Trucy, not bad. It's good to have you young'uns on the case. Lets ol' Daddy-o get some well-deserved R&R.\nTrucy:\nThe elderly need their rest!\nApollo:\n(Uh... isn't he only 33?) ...Um, we've cleared up most of the cases...\nPhoenix:\nI was right about you. Competent. Capable. Tell me what you found out. If you want to.\nApollo:\n(Your enthusiasm is over-whelming...)\nTalk\nProgress report\nPhoenix:\nWell, I certainly didn't expect you back this early.\nTrucy:\nPolly's amazing! He found my panties so quick! Almost like he was the one who stole them!\nApollo:\n...You have an interesting concept of praise.\nPhoenix:\n...And? Did you find the mad driver who gave me that 30-foot toss?\nApollo:\nApparently... it was a doctor. From the Meraktis Clinic.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Meraktis, eh? I've heard of him. Nothing good, mind you.\nApollo:\nThat reminds me, a police car was parked outside the clinic.\nTrucy:\nMaybe something happened?\nApollo:\nWhat is this Meraktis Clinic anyway?\nMeraktis Clinic\nPhoenix:\nAll I've heard are the rumors. That clinic's been making good money... in a bad way.\nApollo:\nBad...?\nPhoenix:\nTies to organized crime... The Kentucky Family.\nApollo:\nUm... the Kitaki Family? (He did that on purpose!)\nPhoenix:\nSome injuries you can't take to a public hospital, see. They use the Meraktis Clinic for their patch-up jobs.\nApollo:\nInteresting...\nPeople Park\nTrucy:\nIt looked like something had happened in that park.\nPhoenix:\nAh. A body was found there in unusual circumstances...\nApollo:\nSomething more unusual than being dead?\nPhoenix:\n...It's not our concern, in any case.\nTrucy:\nRight! Let's ignore that and find that noodle stand!\nApollo:\n(What ever happened to professional curiosity?)\nPresent\nMirror\nPhoenix:\nSo this was the thing that led you to the car.\nApollo:\nYes, sir! The mirror you knocked off was just the clue we needed!\nPhoenix:\nGood work, Apollo. Of course you might say... ...I was the one who made solving that case possible.\nApollo:\n(...You don't get points for knocking off a car mirror.)\nTrucy's Panties\nTrucy:\nLook! My panties! They came home to mama!\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Apollo. I was worried about them, too. Trucy special ordered those...\nApollo:\n(A startling display of parental concern!)\nPhoenix:\nI'd hate to have to buy a  new pair... *shudder*\nApollo:\n(Make that a not-so-startling display of cheapskatedness.)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\n...\nApollo:\n(It's actually a relief to be so thoroughly ignored.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n...Thanks, really. If I get tired of sleeping, maybe I'll head down to this Meraktis place. Maybe hit 'em up for some reparations... A little legal action would do me some good.\nApollo:\nUm... I was wondering when I get paid? We solved the case of your accident, and um, found a missing article of clothing.\nTrucy:\nMy panties!\nPhoenix:\nThat leaves the noodle stand.\nApollo:\nEh.\nPhoenix:\nFeel free to drop in if you get stuck. I'd be happy to help with anything not involving money.\nApollo:\n(Good-bye, quid pro quo. Hello pro bono. *sigh*)\nTrucy:\nRight! Back to the office to plan our next move!\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage:\nJune 15Kitaki Mansion\nTrucy:\nLittle Plum's not here. She's not finished cleaning, huh.\nApollo:\nMaybe she went to get a paint scraper?\nPlum:\nOK! Who's the wise guy who spit gum out on the street!?\nApollo:\n(Her voice carries all the way out to the street from inside the mansion...)\nTrucy:\nShe's a neat freak! How cute!\nPlum:\nYou there! It was you, wasn't it!? Fess up! I hope you've said your prayers. You're gonna need them...\nApollo:\nTr-Trucy? Let's leave. Now.\nTrucy:\n...?\nExamine\nMansion front gate\nApollo:\nAn impressive gate befitting the Kitaki Mansion.\nTrucy:\nLook at the name plate! \"Kitaki\"...! That's so cool! Short and blunt, like any good gangster! Ooh! Let's change our name! How about... \"W. A. A.\"! ... Maybe that's too short and blunt. What do you think?\nApollo:\nNo comment.\nMansion gate wall\nApollo:\nA colorful dragon turns its baleful gaze in my direction. As if to say, \"Abandon all hope ye who enter here.\" Don't worry, Mr. Dragon. Me and hope haven't been on speaking terms for a while.\nSpilled paint\nApollo:\nSeveral colors of paint have been splashed across the gate. It's almost all dry. This is going to be tough to clean.\nOld lady\nApollo:\nIt looks like that woman's still causing trouble...\nOfficer:\nLook, no one goes in! That means you!\nOld Lady:\nOh, what's the difference? Let... me... go! Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow ow!!!\nOfficer:\nAh! S-Sorry!\nOld Lady:\nThat's it, I'm suing! ...But I might change my mind for five bucks...\nApollo:\n(What is she, some kind of con artist?)\nPeople Park sign\nApollo:\nApparently, this park was the gift of the Kitaki Family. The friendly \"People Park\", brought to you by organized crime... A very naughty part of me is tempted to write \"We Kill\" on the left side of the sign.\nPolice officer below People Park sign\nApollo:\nThey're not letting anyone into the crime scene. The guard at the entrance is humming a song. He's got rhythm, actually. Maybe he plays in a band.\nJune 15Wright Anything Agency\nApollo:\nYou... You're the woman from the Kitaki place!\n???:\nY-Yes...\nTrucy:\nI knew it! Something's the matter and you want our help, right? Well, you've come to the Wright place! This way, please...\n???:\nUm... Thank you.\nAlita:\nMy name is Alita Tiala. I... have a request.\nTalk\nYour request\nApollo:\nYour request... let me guess, something's been stolen?\nAlita:\nUm, your flyer... It says \"now defending\" so I thought...\nApollo:\nWhaaaat!? You mean, you mean you want me to defend you? Me?\nTrucy:\nMaybe you can tell us what happened? Were you hit by a car? Did someone steal your stand? Or your panties?\nAlita:\nNo! No... I'm not the client, actually. The client would be my... well, my fiancé, I suppose you'd call him.\nApollo:\nFiancé...? What happened to him, then?\nAlita:\nHe was arrested this morning. The charge... was murder.\nTrucy:\nMurder...\nAlita:\nHave you heard about what happened at the park?\nTiala's story\nApollo:\nSo, what's your story? You frequent the Kitaki Mansion, yes? Are you a member of their, um, organization?\nAlita:\nNo... Not yet.\nTrucy:\nNot yet?\nAlita:\nYou see, I'm to be married next month. To the boss's son.\nApollo:\nThe boss's son...? So he's a, uh... *gulp* (A gangster...)\nAlita:\nYes, but the Kitakis are locally responsible gangsters. I thought it'd be nice for a change... Quit my boring job, live the good, gangster life.\nTrucy:\nI think you're on to something! \"Mrs. Kitaki\"... I like the sound of that!\nApollo:\n(I'm not sure your daddy would care much for that...)\nMurder in the park (appears after \"Your request\")\nApollo:\nWh-What happened!?\nAlita:\nI haven't been told all the details. But I do know a body was found in the park. Near the Kitaki Mansion.\nTrucy:\nThere were a lot of police cars there.\nAlita:\nApparently, the victim was shot with a pistol... But I hear the circumstances of the shooting were... rather unusual.\nApollo:\nAnd your fiancé was arrested for this?\nTrucy:\nUm... what sort of person is your fiancé?\nYour fiancé (appears after \"Tiala's story\" and \"Murder in the park\")\nApollo:\nYour fiancé is the Kitaki Family's only son, correct?\nAlita:\nHis name's Wocky. Wocky Kitaki... I brought a photo.\nApollo:\nWell. That's... quite the photo.\nAlita:\nI know! Oh, he can be powerful and menacing, but so cute!\nApollo:\nBut, if he's the boss's only son...\nAlita:\nYes, I'm sure he'll take his father's place some day.\nTrucy:\nSay, I'm a boss already! Of this agency!\nAlita:\nPlease help my Wocky! Please!\nApollo:\n(...Right! My first solo defense case! Crime boss's son or not, I'll prove he's innocent!)\nAlita:\nI... prepared a letter of request.

Of this agency!\nAlita:\nPlease help my Wocky! Please!\nApollo:\n(...Right! My first solo defense case!

I need your help.\nLetter of Request\nAlita:\nI hope that's OK? I've never written a letter of request before.\nApollo:\nOh, it's fine. (I should hope it's your first...)\nTrucy:\nIf we take this we'll be able to investigate the scene!\nAnything else\nAlita:\nI'm not sure I understand... I'm sorry.\nApollo:\nNo, no, it's me who's sorry, really! Sorry!\nExamine evidence\nLetter of Request\nWriting\nTrucy:\nWhy does this envelope say \"Hit Request\"?\nApollo:\nUm... it's a bit of lingo. Like \"call in a hit\", or a \"hit man\"...\nTrucy:\nOoh, you mean gangster-talk!? So does \"hit\" mean \"to defend\" in gangster-ese? Well, \"hit man\"?\nApollo:\nI certainly hope not... (Something tells me she used the wrong envelope...)\nJune 15Hickfield Clinic\nApollo:\nHuh...? Where's Mr. Wright?\nTrucy:\nMaybe he's getting an examination again?\nApollo:\nHow many does he need!? (Wasn't it just a sprain?)\nTrucy:\nToo bad, Polly! You wanted to show off your request to Daddy, didn't you!\nApollo:\nWhat? Me? No!\nTrucy:\nOh? That's a surprise.\nApollo:\nL-Let's just come back later, shall we?\nAfter clearing \"Your fiancé\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency:\nJune 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nTrucy:\nPolly! You look as happy as a clam in its shell.\nApollo:\nFor a lawyer this is it, the place where the battle begins!\nGuard:\n...Ahem. You need something?\nApollo:\nAaah! Yes, we're attorneys. I was hoping we could see Mr. Wocky Kitaki?\nGuard:\nSorry, he's in questioning right now. Could take a while.\nTrucy:\nDrat. Oh well, guess we'll have to come back later then.\nApollo:\nSo much for that battle...\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nApollo:\nThat security camera is looking at me. I wonder if they tape all of this.\nSecurity guard\nApollo:\nA security guard. He stands here, watching this room. I have no idea if he's listening to us talk. I'm not even sure he's breathing.\nAfter clearing \"Your fiancé\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency:\nJune 15Kitaki Mansion\nApollo:\n(So this is it... My first murder crime scene!)\nOfficer:\nAh, it's you kids again. Look, can't you find some other place to play...\nTrucy:\nWe're not playing! We're um, \"investigating\"! Aren't we, Apollo?\nApollo:\nSir, I have a letter of request here.\nOfficer:\nLetter of... huh? Why does it say \"Hit Request\" on it?\nApollo:\n(Ms. Tiala must have used the Kitaki's stationery...)\n???:\nExcuse me, coming through.\nOfficer:\nAh! It's you! Mr. Gavin!\nApollo:\n...! (Who's this guy...?)\n???:\nI must say I'm used to being inspected by the ladies... But this is the first time I've felt this way with a man.\nApollo:\nMr.... Gavin?\n???:\nAh, Fräulein. What is a sweet morsel like you doing in such a dismal place? Can I help?\nTrucy:\n... Y-Yes! The police man officer fellow here won't let us in! We even have a letter of request!\n???:\nYou must be exhausted, standing out here! I will take you to the scene of the crime.\nTrucy:\nOooh! R-Really!?\n???:\n...By your leave, Officer.\nOfficer:\nYa... Yes sir! Of course, sir!\n???:\nAh ha. Very well. This way, Fräulein...\nTrucy:\nWhee!\nApollo:\n... Hey! What about me!?\nJune 15People Park\n???:\n...On that note, enjoy your investigation!\nTrucy:\nThank you! Will we see you again...?\n???:\nAsk the wind, Fräulein. I'll be riding on it!\nApollo:\n...Who was that?\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeek! Apollo! Look! A c-corpse!\nApollo:\nWhaaaat!? ...Hey, it's just a mannequin.\nTrucy:\nWow. It sure got me.\n???:\nAhem. Might I ask exactly what it is you're doing here? Oh, it's you. How did you kids get in here?\nTrucy:\nOh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in...\n???:\nHim again. That glimmerous fop, always getting in my way... Anyway! This scene is off-limits.\nApollo:\nExcuse me? We have a letter of request!\n???:\n...Hmm. One moment.\nApollo:\n(Why is she holding that big magnifying glass...?)\n???:\n.............................. I'd recognize that handwriting anywhere. Scientific analysis says this was written by Alita Tiala.\nApollo:\n...Thanks. (It took you thirty minutes to figure that out!?) So... what's up with the mannequin there?\n???:\nIt's taking the place of the body, preserving the scene of the crime as it was found.\nApollo:\n(The body... was pulling the stand!?)\n???:\nSo, you're a defense attorney, are you?\nEma:\nDetective Ema Skye. I'm in charge of this crime scene.\nTrucy:\nShe doesn't seem that happy about it.\nApollo:\n...She doesn't seem that happy about many things.\nEma:\nI trust you know how to stay out of the way. I always carry two pairs of handcuffs... just in case.\nExamine\nNoodle stand\nEma:\nHey there! No messing with the crime scene!\nApollo:\nB-But we need to investigate!\nTrucy:\nApollo! Look! That stand! ... It says \"Eldoon\"!\nApollo:\n...I've noticed. Well, we've solved the case of the missing stand at least. ...Though the circumstances could stand to be better.\nAnywhere else\nEma:\nHey there! No messing with the crime scene!\nApollo:\nB-But we need to investigate!\nEma:\nInvestigations are to be carried out by professionals, scientifically!\nApollo:\n(She's not going to let us check out the crime scene, is she...)\nTrucy:\nHey, Apollo. My very un-scientific analysis tells me something here is very suspicious...\nApollo:\n...I think I know what you mean. It's kind of hard not to notice. (I'd better check out what we came here to find at least.)\nTalk\nAny option\nApollo:\nUm, Detective Skye...?\nEma:\nQuiet, please. It's snack time. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.\nTrucy:\nWe're not making much progress here.\nApollo:\n(She must not be very busy...)\nEma:\n*sigh* I never seem to get a lucky break. Back after nine years, and they won't give me the position I requested... ...And then I hear he gave up the defense attorney life...\nApollo:\n(He? Who's he? An ex-defense attorney...?)\nPresent\nAnything\nApollo:\nUm, if you could spare a moment to take a look at this?\nEma:\n...Can't you see that I am extremely, extremely busy?\nApollo:\n(...Eating snacks, yes.)\nTrucy:\nBusy eating snacks, I'd say.\nApollo:\n(This is going nowhere fast.)\nAfter clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park:\nJune 15Eldoon's House\nTrucy:\nOh, Mr. Eldoon...! Hello?\nApollo:\nLooks like he left.\nTrucy:\nAnd we found his stand and everything! What about our free bowl!?\nApollo:\nOh, too bad, looks like we'll have to wait a little longer for that bowl. So sorry.\nTrucy:\nAw, what a bummer.\nExamine\nClinic front door\nApollo:\nThe front entrance to the Meraktis Clinic. The walls and posts are so highly polished I can see my face in them. ... Hot dang, my hair looks good.\nGreen banner\nApollo:\nLooks like this is a banner for some campaign. \"Three shots for the price of one\"... Somehow I don't see people lining up for that.\nPolice car\nApollo:\nA police car is parked in front of the Meraktis Clinic. It's empty. The police must be inside investigating.\nBlue tarp\nApollo:\nThe blue tarp Mr. Eldoon used to cover his noodle stand. Robbed of its purpose, it blows in the wind... alone.\nBowl\nApollo:\nA lone Eldoon's Noodles bowl lies on the ground. The lone bowl, tipped on its side... It's kind of surreal.\nHouse\nApollo:\nMr. Eldoon's house has seen better days. And I'm betting I've eaten better noodles.\n\"NOO\" sign\nApollo:\nThis must be his business sign. It reads \"NOO\". Maybe that's how the kids are spelling \"new\" these days. Another failed attempt at hipster marketing.\nOil drum\nApollo:\nAn oil drum for catching rainwater. ...Ack! A sparrow just flew over and... Aw man, that was just disgusting! Something tells me this wasn't the first time.\nSign under oil drum\nApollo:\nThere's a hand-written sign here... \"Save the light!\" It's hard to make out the sign in the shade from the clinic next door.\nSpoon the dog\nApollo:\nGuy Eldoon's dog doesn't look too lively. They say dogs and their owners resemble each other... I guess there are exceptions.\nAfter clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park:\nJune 15Hickfield Clinic\nPhoenix:\nAh, you're back! Run into some problems?\nTrucy:\nOh, Polly, didn't you want to tell Daddy something?\nApollo:\nWho? Me? No! I'm fine. Really.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this? So there is a problem?\nApollo:\nNo, no problem. Actually, I got a defense request.\nPhoenix:\nA defense request! That is a problem.\nApollo:\nHuh...?\nPhoenix:\nI've given up the court. I'm not a lawyer anymore.\nApollo:\n... The request was for me!\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. You're a lawyer, aren't you?\nApollo:\n(He's doing that on purpose! I know it!)\nTalk\nMurder\nPhoenix:\nSo, what about this defense request?\nApollo:\nIt's related to the murder in People Park, actually.\nTrucy:\nGuess what! We found Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand at the scene of the crime!\nPhoenix:\nDid you now. That's unusual indeed. Never heard of a noodle stand being used as a murder weapon.\nApollo:\n...Uh, I think the murder weapon was something else.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you don't know what the murder weapon was?\nTrucy:\nThat funny detective lady won't let us on the scene! What kind of detective wears a lab coat, anyway!?\nPhoenix:\nA lab coat? Hmm. Didn't think she'd be involved with this...\nApollo:\n...You know her?\nPhoenix:\nYou could say that.\nSkye connection (appears after \"Murder\")\nApollo:\nSo... you know her, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nI met her on a case... this was about ten years ago. She was still a high school student at the time.\nApollo:\n(That would make her about the same age as me!)\nTrucy:\nThat's my daddy! He knows all the police types. Oh, wait! Maybe you know that other guy, too!\nApollo:\nThat other guy...?\nTrucy:\nThat shining prince on the motorcycle!\nPhoenix:\n...Prince?\nMysterious Prince (appears after \"Skye connection\")\nPhoenix:\nApollo. Tell me about this \"prince\" of Trucy's. Indulge a concerned father...\nApollo:\nHe was at the crime scene... He looked just like Mr. Gavin!\nPhoenix:\n... Did he now.\nApollo:\n...You know him?\nPhoenix:\nMy guess is he's Kristoph Gavin's younger brother...\nApollo:\nHis brother!?\nPhoenix:\nWe're acquaintances, after a fashion. Klavier Gavin... rock 'n' roll god incarnate.\nTrucy:\nKlavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy!\nApollo:\n(I didn't know Mr. Gavin had a brother! And what was he doing out there?)\nPhoenix:\nI have a feeling you'll be crossing paths again soon. ...Now, what was the problem again? Having trouble investigating the crime scene in the park?\nTrucy:\nYeah. That detective woman won't let us!\nPhoenix:\n...Go to the office. Under the silk top hat you'll find a bottle of white powder. Try taking that to this detective.\nApollo:\n\"White powder\"...? (I hope it's not what I think it is.)\nPhoenix:\nJust take it to her. It'll be fine, you'll see. Oh, and tell her I said hi.\nMysterious Prince (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nApollo. Tell me about this \"prince\" of Trucy's. Indulge a concerned father...\nApollo:\nHe was at the crime scene... He looked just like Mr. Gavin!\nPhoenix:\n... Did he now.\nApollo:\n...You know him?\nPhoenix:\nMy guess is he's Kristoph Gavin's younger brother...\nApollo:\nHis brother!?\nPhoenix:\nWe're acquaintances, after a fashion. Klavier Gavin... rock 'n' roll god incarnate.\nTrucy:\nKlavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy!\nApollo:\n(I didn't know Mr. Gavin had a brother! And what was he doing out there?)\nPhoenix:\nI have a feeling you'll be crossing paths again soon.\nWright Anything Agency (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic)\nExamine\nSilk hat\nLeads to:\n\"So this must be the \"silk top hat\" Mr. Wright mentioned.\"\nTalk\nThe case\nTrucy:\nHmm... I think we should focus on finding more information about the case.\nApollo:\nYou seem to be having fun.\nTrucy:\nOf course! This is my first criminal investigation! And it's so mysterious! A noodle stand pushing a dead man along...\nApollo:\n...Uh, I think it was the other way around. The dead man was pulling the stand. But you're right about it being mysterious.\nTrucy:\nI knew it! More information, that's what we need!\nApollo:\nSo this must be the \"silk top hat\" Mr. Wright mentioned. Let's take a closer look... Huh?\nTrucy:\nWhoa!\nApollo:\nYou know what this is, Trucy?\nTrucy:\nI... remember finding some in Daddy's dresser when I was little. I thought it was sugar, so I licked it... He got mad at me.\nApollo:\n(This is getting more and more suspicious...)\nWhite powder placed gingerly into pocket.\nTrucy:\nLet's go talk to that detective! She's sure to know what that white powder is!\nExamine evidence\nWhite Powder\nLabel\nApollo:\nHmm. The bottle has a label on it.\nTrucy:\nCan you read it?\nApollo:\nUh, not a word. I'm not sure I speak whatever language this is written in.\nTrucy:\nThat's too bad. I guess we're stuck with this mysterious bottle of white powder...\nPeople Park (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then examining silk hat in Wright Anything Agency)\nPresent\nWhite Powder\nLeads to:\n\"Um... Does this ring any bells?\"\nApollo:\nUm... Does this ring any bells?\nEma:\nAh! Is that--!? It couldn't!? Where'd you get that?\nApollo:\nI brought it from the office.\nEma:\nYou... work at the Wright & Co. Law Offices, yes?\nApollo:\nEr, yeah, sort of...\nTrucy:\nDetective Skye! How do you know my daddy?\nEma:\nD-D-Daddy!? I'm sorry, who did you say you were?\nTrucy:\nTrucy Wright. Phoenix Wright's daughter.\nEma:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Wright has a daughter!?\nTrucy:\nYou seem shocked.\nEma:\nW-Well, if you're Mr. Wright's daughter and you're his apprentice... ...then I'm available to help you in any way I can!\nApollo:\nOh, uh, thanks. (You can start by not calling me Mr. Wright's apprentice!)\nEma:\nThis powder is used for detecting fingerprints.\nApollo:\nFingerprints...?\nEma:\nI guess you might call it a memento... from the time I spent with Mr. Wright.\nApollo:\n(White powder memories...)\nEma:\nIf you find any evidence with fingerprints on it, please let me know! We'll dust for prints!\nApollo:\n(Well, she's quite the eager beaver all of a sudden...)\nExamine\nBenches\nApollo:\nBenches line the river running through the park.\nTrucy:\nAhh, a little urban oasis. I bet children come here to splash around in the water.\nApollo:\nThat river's a little deep for splashing... and a little dirty.\nTrucy:\nWell, they could listen to the water and pretend they were playing.\nBlue tarps\nApollo:\nBlue tarps have been placed on the ground around the stand.\nTrucy:\nApollo! I bet the victim was going to have a picnic here!\nApollo:\n...I guess he could have eaten all the noodles he wanted.\nEma:\nDon't touch those! Those are preserving the crime scene!\nApollo:\n(Oh, I guess the police put these tarps here after all.)\nKnife\nApollo:\nIt's... a knife!\nEma:\nA \"shiv\" to be precise.\nTrucy:\nOoh... lingo!\nEma:\nThe defendant, Wocky Kitaki, is the son of known gangsters. The police are assuming this belongs to him.\nApollo:\n(Wait, but wasn't the murder weapon a pistol...?) Huh? Look at this, there's a handprint on this shiv...\nEma:\nA handprint? Then there might be a fingerprint. Let's investigate! Right! First, choose the fingerprint you want to examine.\nApollo:\n...Choose a fingerprint?\nEma:\nLook closely at the handle. See? There's more than one fingerprint there.\nTrucy:\nThose black spots?\nEma:\nThat's right. Pick the one you want to analyze.\nExamine darkest fingerprint\nLeads to:\n\"Right! Let's get detecting!\"\nEma:\nRight! Let's get detecting!\nApollo:\n(Wow, she's practically glowing with excitement...)\nEma:\nFirst, sprinkle some aluminum powder over the print. With a press of [A / Space], like this. See? (Changed from [Just touch the screen, like this. See?] in the original release) The oil left by the print absorbs the aluminum powder, so you just dust it on... ...and blow it off!\nTrucy:\nB-Blow?\nEma:\nIt's like whistling. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just use [X / Y / R] and... (Changed from [It's like whistling. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just put your lips together...] in the original release)\nTrucy:\nWow! Amazing! It's like magic!\nEma:\nHeh heh. Isn't it though?\nApollo:\n(Right, let's give it a shot!)\nEma:\nIncidentally, it's important that you cover the entire fingerprint with the powder.\nObtain fingerprint\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm, good... clear... Quite impressive!\"\nEma:\nHmm, good... clear... Quite impressive! Next, to match the print. The police office has samples so you can tell whose finger this print belongs to.\nApollo:\nHmm... That doesn't sound like as much fun as actually finding the print.\nEma:\nOK, pick the person whose print you think this is. You probably have a good idea whose knife this is already.\nCompare Wocky Kitaki profile\nComparing...Comparison complete.\nMatch found\nLeads to:\n\"So... the fingerprints do belong to the defendant.\"\nCompare anyone else\nComparing...Comparison complete.\nNo Match found\nLeads back to profile selection\nApollo:\nSo... the fingerprints do belong to the defendant.\nEma:\nYes! Isn't it amazing? Ah, the power of science. It's my life.\nTrucy:\nApollo, she's... sparkling.\nApollo:\nAnd I'm dimming.\nEma:\nLook sharp, spirits up. The real fight is yet to come!\nTrucy:\nChin up, Polly!\nApollo:\n(The trial hasn't even started and I'm already losing...)\nKnife added to the Court Record.\nKnife (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nA knife is sticking straight into the ground.\nTrucy:\nWith the defendant's fingerprints on it... Which means... You think he stuck it into the victim?\nApollo:\n(I don't know what he did with it but I don't like it.)\nMannequin\nApollo:\nThis mannequin is dressed up to look like a police officer. I've seen one at the station. (A mannequin in place of a body...)\nEma:\nThe body of the victim has already been removed.\nTrucy:\nDo you think the victim was the noodle stand thief?\nApollo:\nWhat, you think someone killed him because he stole it?\nTrucy:\nYeah! Taking care of business, Little Plum Kitaki style!\nApollo:\n(Try not to sound too eager about that, please...)\nNoodle stand\nApollo:\n...And this is Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand, obviously.\nTrucy:\nIt does say \"Eldoon\" in big letters, doesn't it!\nApollo:\nAnd that mark on his paper lantern there looks familiar.\nTrucy:\nIt's going to be a little weird telling him... what with the corpse and all...\nApollo:\nAnyway, that wraps up three of our cases.\nTrucy:\nThat's right! Congratulations, Apollo!\nApollo:\n(And leaves us with one case that's worse than all three put together... Murder.)\nTrash can\nApollo:\n(There's got to be a good clue or two around here...)\nTrucy:\nYou and your trash cans! Go ahead, knock yourself out.\nApollo:\nPlease, can't you see I'm doing my... Huh? L... Look! Another pair of underwear!?\nTrucy:\nWow, Apollo! You're a genius at finding panties!\nApollo:\nStop saying that. Wait, these aren't...?\nTrucy:\nTh-They're not mine!\nApollo:\n(Could these have been stolen, too?)\nBloomers added to the Court Record.\nTrash can (subsequent times)\nTrucy:\nI'll always remember this trash can as \"the place where Apollo found those bloomers\"!\nApollo:\nDon't you have more important things to remember? Wait, these aren't...?\nTrucy:\nTh-They're not mine!\nApollo:\n(Could these have been stolen, too?)\nTalk\nThe case\nEma:\nThe report came in late last night. The body was found much as you see it now. ...Except it was a real body.\nApollo:\nBut... why?\nEma:\nWhy was a body pulling a noodle stand? If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't still be here.\nApollo:\nWell, what was the cause of death...?\nEma:\nA bullet wound, to the temple. ...He was shot by a pistol.\nTrucy:\nA pistol?\nEma:\nNot the easiest thing to come by in this day and age.\nApollo:\n(Unless you're a cop... or a gangster.)\nEma:\nIncidentally, the victim's name was Pal Meraktis. I just received the autopsy report, in fact.\nMeraktis's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nEma:\nI mean, really! What's up with this case!? It's enough to make me want to run off, pulling a mysterious noodle stand behind me...\nTrucy:\nNot so mysterious, actually... We should tell her, Apollo! After all, we know where the stand came from!\nEma:\nA likely story! I didn't come here to play games, you know.\nApollo:\nActually, we do know where the noodle stand came from. The noodle stand's owner is...\nPresent Guy Eldoon profile\nApollo:\nEma:\n... Who's the old guy?\nApollo:\nThis is the proprietor of Eldoon's Noodles, Mr. Eldoon himself!\nTrucy:\nHe's famous in this part of town.\nEma:\nNot bad. I guess Mr. Wright picked the right kids for the job. That saved me a lot of work. Thanks.\nNoodle Stand added to the Court Record.\nTrucy:\nWhat sort of person was the victim, anyway?\nEma:\nYou mean what did he do? He was a doctor.\nApollo:\nA doctor...? (I'm starting to see a connection here...)\nPresent anyone else\nApollo:\nEma:\n... Look, I have better things to be doing. I'd make more progress eating snacks than listening to this drivel.\nApollo:\n(You could try actually investigating, rather than just standing around.)\nLeads back to Talk options\nThe case (subsequent times, before correctly presenting Guy Eldoon profile)\nEma:\nThe report came in late last night. The body was found much as you see it now. ...Except it was a real body.\nApollo:\nBut... why?\nEma:\nWhy was a body pulling a noodle stand? If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't still be here.\nApollo:\nWell, what was the cause of death...?\nEma:\nA bullet wound, to the temple. ...He was shot by a pistol.\nTrucy:\nA pistol?\nEma:\nNot the easiest thing to come by in this day and age.\nApollo:\n(Unless you're a cop... or a gangster.)\nEma:\nI mean, really!

He was a doctor.\nApollo:\nA doctor...? (I'm starting to see a connection here...)\nYour story\nEma:\nWho? Me? I'm just a supervisor for this crime scene.\nApollo:\n(Detective Skye... Hmm.)\nEma:\nI was out of the country for a while. I came back to be a forensic scientist.\nTrucy:\nOoh! Were you studying abroad?\nEma:\nSomething like that. I was studying in Europe. Forensic sciences, mind you. But when I got back here, they threw me in criminal affairs! Just like that!\nTrucy:\nWhy didn't you just become a forensics expert in Europe?\nEma:\nWell, I suppose that was an option, but... I had a lot of favors to repay to people back here.\nApollo:\n(Favors? Wasn't she in high school when she left?)\nEma:\nWhat? What's that look for? I was involved in an... incident before I left. But Mr. Wright and his people helped me out. I owed them.\nTrucy:\nReally? I had no idea...\nApollo:\n(If she's been out of the country for a while... ...she probably doesn't know about Mr. Wright's current, erm, \"state of affairs\".)\nThe defendant\nApollo:\nUm... Could you tell us a bit about the defendant? He's the only son of the Kitaki Family, yes...?\nEma:\nWocky Kitaki. I don't know if he is the boss's son, but he's certainly throwing his weight around... ...Violently. In the detention center.\nTrucy:\nI see.\nApollo:\nWhy was he arrested in the first place?\nEma:\n... You are a defense attorney, aren't you? You're not his, by any chance?\nApollo:\nEr, a-actually, yes, I am.\nEma:\nWell... We have a witness to the moment of the crime.\nApollo:\nEh...?\nEma:\nThe witness called the police. They'll be testifying during the trial tomorrow.\nTrucy:\nWhaaaaaaaa--!?\nThe victim (appears after correctly presenting Guy Eldoon profile upon selecting \"The case\" Talk option)\nApollo:\nCould you tell us a bit more about the victim?\nEma:\nWell, let's see... Apparently he's the physician at a clinic in the area. Quite well off, too, from the sound of it. The clinic's name is... The Meraktis Clinic.\nTrucy:\nHmm... Maybe that's why the cop car was parked there?\nEma:\nWhat? You've been to the clinic?\nApollo:\nYeah... Though on a related issue.\nApollo:\n(I told the detective about the case of the stolen noodle stand.)\nEma:\n...I see... So that means... ...Dr. Meraktis stole the stand and pulled it all the way here?\nApollo:\nThat would seem to be the case.\nEma:\n... But why?\nApollo:\nDon't ask me!\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nEma:\nAh, an attorney's badge. It reminds me of when Mr. Wright was still defending. Everything I have now is thanks to him. Remember, help as many people as you can. That's your job!\nTrucy:\nShe's right, Polly! Let's make a difference! ...Is something wrong?\nApollo:\nAh! Ah, no! N-Nothing. (I... I actually felt inspired for a moment there.)\nFingerprint Powder\nEma:\nFingerprint analysis is the very basis of modern forensic science! Doesn't just talking about it leave you breathless with excitement?\nApollo:\nOh yes. Breathless. (Actually, it does sound kinda interesting...)\nEma:\nLet me know if you find any evidence that might have a  print or two, alright?\nKnife\nEma:\nThe defendant's fingerprints were found on that knife.\nTrucy:\nWhich means that, at the very least, he was here at the scene of the crime...?\nEma:\nIt's highly possible, yes.\nApollo:\nUgh. This doesn't look good.\nEma:\nNo use worrying about what's out already! You just worry about what's yet to come!\nMeraktis's Autopsy Report\nEma:\nWhy did Dr. Meraktis die like this...?\nTrucy:\nPulling a noodle stand... Very strange.\nEma:\nInconceivable! I just don't get it! Some people just can't die normally!\nApollo:\n(He's dead, give him a break.)\nAnything else\nEma:\nSorry... I don't think I can help you with that. I think you need more than just scientific help. But ask me anything you like! ...Just ask scientifically.\nExamine evidence\nFingerprint Powder\nLabel\nApollo:\nThe label reads \"Fingerprint Powder\" in some strange language.\nTrucy:\nHow do we know for sure? What if this is really a jar for something else, like jam, or honey?\nApollo:\nWhy would anyone go through the trouble?\nTrucy:\nWell, so the police don't find out, that's why!\nApollo:\nI hardly think possessing fingerprint powder is a crime.\nTrucy:\nOh, huh, I guess. That's boring.\nBloomers\nPattern on back side\nTrucy:\nThese bloomers sure have a... distinct design!\nApollo:\nYou certainly know who they belong to at a glance.\nTrucy:\nThat way, she doesn't have to write her name on them! Genius!\nApollo:\n...I would think writing your name would be easier than drawing a plum blossom.\nKnife\nFingerprints\nTrucy:\nSo, the defendant's prints are on this knife...\nApollo:\nThat would mean he was here the night of the crime.\nTrucy:\nThat's what I call irrefutable scientific evidence! Neat!\nApollo:\nNot so neat when it happens to be evidence against our client...\nNoodle Stand\n\"NOODLE\" sign\nTrucy:\nHuh? Look at this, Apollo! Mr. Eldoon spelled his name backwards on this side!\nApollo:\nUm, I think that says \"Noodle\". As in \"Eldoon's Noodles\".\nTrucy:\nHuh... Oh, I get it! So the name of his store is the same whether you read it forward or backwards!\nApollo:\nYeah... I guess it would be. Well, except for the last \"s\".\nTrucy:\n...... Then, how about a store called \"Team Meat\"?\nApollo:\nUh, close, but that would be \"Taem Maet\" backwards. And what kind of store is that?\nTrucy:\nWhy, a store that sells meat! \"It's not meat, useless it's Team Meat!\"\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining trash can and knife:\nEma:\nSo... have you met the defendant?\nApollo:\nAh. Uh... No.\nEma:\nVisiting hours are almost over at the detention center. You might think about wrapping up here and heading over.\nApollo:\nGood idea. (I don't know what good it will do. We have a witness, and a knife with prints... Have I mentioned I've got a bad feeling about this?)\nEma:\nDon't worry, it's like a Wright tradition.\nApollo:\n(Some traditions I can live without.)\nJune 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nGuard:\nI'm sorry. Meeting hours for the day are all done.\nApollo:\nB-But we still have three minutes!\nGuard:\nI'll put in your request, but don't expect anything. The father's talking in the private room with him.\nTrucy:\nThe father? You mean like a priest?\nGuard:\nI mean the suspect's father, Mr. Winfred \"Big Wins\" Kitaki himself.\nApollo:\n(Not someone I care to meet...)\n???:\n...Die you--!!!\n???:\n...You're the one on your way out, old--!!!\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\n.........\nGuard:\nAh. They're here.\nApollo:\n(Whoa! This guy radiates power! Power.. with a cute apron?)\n???:\nYou Wocky's lawyer?\nApollo:\nY-Yes, sir!\nBig Wins:\nWell, I'm Big Wins Kitaki, fourth head of the Kitaki family... capice?\nApollo:\nEr... Actually, I came to speak to your son.\nBig Wins:\n... Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\nYes?\nBig Wins:\nMy son's innocent. He killed no one. If he were found guilty... it wouldn't be good. ...Capice?\nApollo:\nY-Yes! I'm all about capicing! Capice'd loud and clear!\nBig Wins:\nYou gotta do more than just understand to make it. You'll learn, though. Even if the lesson comes at the end of your short life.\nApollo:\n(I don't feel so good...)\n???:\nWhat's the big idea, old man!\nWocky:\nYou can't treat me like a kid no more, not now! You know I... I... I wanted to go to the clink! I like it here!\nApollo:\nYou... must be Wocky?\nWocky:\nA G's not a G till he does hard time! Bizzoooy! You'll see. When I get out of here, things'll change!\nBig Wins:\nSilence! My apologies, Mr. Justice... He's usually such a nice boy.\nApollo:\n(Forgive me if I have a hard time believing that.)\nWocky:\nHa! You can't take me under your wing this time, old man! You heard me! I don't need no trial! I did it!\nBig Wins:\n...I think that's enough for today, Mr. Justice. Don't let me down tomorrow.\nApollo:\nSo much for talking to our client.\nTrucy:\nBut we made so much progress today! We even found my panties! I had fun, at least.\nApollo:\nOf course, the biggest mystery of all remains... (How am I supposed to build a case for the trial!?)\nTrucy:\nOh, almost forgot, it's time for my show! Tonight I'm performing at the Wonder Bar! You should come check it out.\nTo be continued.\nNothing to examine during investigation\nApollo:\nNo clues here.",

Mr. Wright's not here today?Trucy:\nHe said his old foot injury was acting up.Apollo:\nOld injury...!? He was all smiles yesterday!Trucy:\nYes, he smiled when he said we'd be fine \"as long as you're there, Trucy\".Apollo:\nYes... Fine... We'll be fine. Here comes Justice!!! I started my voice training at 5 this morning.Trucy:\nOooh! Do some now! I want to see! ...Er, hear!Apollo:\nHuh? Oh, OK. ...Ahem. My name is Apollo Justice, and I'm fine!!!Trucy:\n...... That sounds more like a self-mantra than voice training.???:\n...I'm fine! I'm fine! You know what I'm saying!?Apollo:\nAck! G-Good morning!Wocky:\nYo, 'sup. Hit me with the guilty verdict, G! See if I care. You just hang loose and let things go with the flow. You know what I'm saying!?Apollo:\nUh, not really.Big Wins:\nWocky! Don't be running your mouth like that in here!Wocky:\nSee, that's the difference between me and you, old man. I ain't afraid of no cops. Real G's can't keep it real till they spend some hard time in the pen.Big Wins:\nYou have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.Trucy:\nSounds like they've both been voice training too, Apollo.Apollo:\n(My worst fears realized... The trial's starting and I still haven't had a real talk with my client!)June 16, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Wocky Kitaki.Apollo:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Klavier:\nReady to rock 'n' roll, Herr Judge.Trucy:\nAh! It's him! The pri--guy from yesterday! He's a prosecutor?Apollo:\n(...It's Mr. Gavin's brother!)Klavier:\n...Judge:\nLong time no see... Prosecutor Gavin. Were you taking a leave of absence?Klavier:\nYou know that little band I started in my free time? Thing is, we got real popular. Hard to say \"nein\" to your fans when three of your singles go platinum, ja?Judge:\n...I see. To be honest, I was a little concerned. I feared that you might still be distraught over that one trial...Klavier:\nNot to worry, Herr Judge. I wouldn't miss this day in court for the world. It's worth even more than VIP passes to one of my concerts, ja? How could I pass up a chance to see the true strength... ...of the little boy who bested my brother?Apollo:\n...!Klavier:\nIt was worth canceling a show or two.Judge:\nUnderstood. You may give your opening statements to the court.Klavier:\nBefore that, I was thinking... Is the air in this courtroom not a bit... serious?Judge:\nIt IS a court of law.Klavier:\nThat's no way to get the crowd jumping, Herr Judge.Judge:\nThey're not supposed to jump! This is a courtroom!Klavier:\nAchtung, baby! Today, we play it my way!Apollo:\n(What's that... noise?)Klavier:\nSometimes you have to get on up in order to get down... to prosecuting!Apollo:\n(This is crazy...)Klavier:\nThe victim... Pal Meraktis, director of the Meraktis Clinic. The scene... People Park. He was found pulling a noodle stand.Judge:\nWhat in the world was a doctor doing pulling a noodle stand?Klavier:\nYes, I believe... ...you will only find that out by asking the defendant, right here, right now. Because it's an undeniable truth that he shot the victim!Apollo:\nWhat do you mean, undeniable?Klavier:\nIf you are to glare at anyone, Herr Justice, glare at the punk in the defendant's chair. His crime was witnessed quite clearly, you see.Judge:\n...Very well. Please admit this witness to the court.Klavier:\n...Nein! Not yet! First, there is a little matter to be cleaned up...Apollo:\n(Could you talk without the accompaniment?)Trucy:\nI swear I could see the guitar for a second!Judge:\nWhat is it, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\nThe \"motive\", Herr Judge. Why did the little punk do it? Why did he kill the director of the Meraktis Clinic?Apollo:Apollo:\nNot so fast! The defendant doesn't have to explain that!Klavier:\nOh? But what if the defendant specifically requests to do so? As he did this morning? I want to \"give a shout out to all my homeys!\" I believe he said.Judge:\nWhaaaaat!?Apollo:\n(What is right!)Trucy:\nThey always say that, on stage, you should hit the crowd with speed and ferocity! Sounds like he got you good, huh, Polly?Judge:\nWell, this is highly unusual. But... The court will now hear from the defendant concerning his motive in the crime!Judge:\nSo... You, son, are the defendant... Wocky, are you?Wocky:\nI ain't your son, old man! You step to a Kitaki, you best be prepared to step strong!Klavier:\nYou \"step\" to a public official, you'd best be prepared to step into jail.Trucy:\nYou got to hand it to him, Wocky sure has guts!Apollo:\n(It's not his guts I'm worried about...)Judge:\nWell then, the court will now hear testimony on the defendant's motive... ...from the defendant himself!Witness Testimony-- Wocky Kitaki's \"Truth\" --Wocky:\nI'll tell you one thing, that doctor was a quacker!\nSomeone had to show him what's what!\nI was in his clinic 'bout half a year ago. He messed up my op something bad.\nAnd then he just lets me go, without a word. See ya later, bye!\nSo I gotta go in, get another doc to patch me up again!\nThat was the day I done figured it out. No O.G.'s gonna let that pass!\nThat's why I went to his pad that night, know what I'm saying!?Judge:\nYou're saying you were one of the victim's patients...!?Wocky:\nLotta stuff goes down when you're keeping it real on the street. Tru dat. I tell you one thing, that doc was wack!Judge:\nHmm... Very well, the defense may begin the cross-examination.Apollo:\n(I can't believe this is the first time I'm hearing about all of this...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Wocky Kitaki's \"Truth\" --Wocky:\nI'll tell you one thing, that doctor was a quacker!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nFirst of all, the word you're looking for is \"quack\".

But I never learned how to catch them with my heart!\nWocky:\nThe bullet stopped just short of my thumper, you know what I'm saying? I woulda been golden if it weren't for that wack doc! Can't even take out a stupid bullet!\nKlavier:\n...So, as you say, the surgery was a failure.\nWocky:\nThat ain't all of it, homes!Wocky:\nAnd then he just lets me go, without a word.

He's a badder G than me!Wocky:\nSo I gotta go in, get another doc to patch me up again!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nSo, this bullet is still...?\nWocky:\nYou know it! I can still feel it... Right there in my chest, pressin' up against my heart!\nKlavier:\n\"Your words are like a bullet shot straight into my heart.\" ...or something to that effect? Incidentally, that's from one of our hit singles.\nJudge:\nWell, that sounds like a straightforward case of malpractice!\nWocky:\nWord, J-man. Weren't no accident, that's fo' shizzle.Wocky:\nThat was the day I done figured it out. No O.G.'s gonna let that pass!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou figured it out that day? So you had no idea until then?\nWocky:\nFor half a year, I didn't notice a thing.\nApollo:\nWhaaaat!? You had a bullet in your chest and you didn't know!?\nWocky:\nHeh! Takes more than a bullet to bring me down, homes!\nApollo:\n(How many bullets does it take!?)Wocky:\nThat's why I went to his pad that night, know what I'm saying!?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou \"went to his pad\"...? Did you have an appointment to meet with the victim? In the park, perhaps?\nWocky:\nYou out of your mind!? Who makes an appointment to get the drop on someone!? I came ready to fight my way into that clinic of his. Shortest way to the clinic from my place is through that park, know what I'm saying?\nApollo:\n(...He's right. That does seem to be the shortest path.)\nWocky:\nThere I was, cold walking through the park... ...when he comes popping up out of nowhere, right before my eyes! I figured someone up on high was looking out for me, know what I'm saying?Apollo:\n(Unngh... This sounds bad right from the get-go.)Trucy:\nWell, there won't be any get-go if we don't get some more information!Apollo:\n(Right. First, gather the facts. Time enough for despair later!)",

Weren't no accident, that's fo' shizzle.Wocky:\nThat was the day I done figured it out. No O.G.'s gonna let that pass!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou figured it out that day? So you had no idea until then?\nWocky:\nFor half a year, I didn't notice a thing.\nApollo:\nWhaaaat!? You had a bullet in your chest and you didn't know!?\nWocky:\nHeh! Takes more than a bullet to bring me down, homes!\nApollo:\n(How many bullets does it take!?)Wocky:\nThat's why I went to his pad that night, know what I'm saying!?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou \"went to his pad\"...? Did you have an appointment to meet with the victim? In the park, perhaps?\nWocky:\nYou out of your mind!? Who makes an appointment to get the drop on someone!? I came ready to fight my way into that clinic of his. Shortest way to the clinic from my place is through that park, know what I'm saying?\nApollo:\n(...He's right. That does seem to be the shortest path.)\nWocky:\nThere I was, cold walking through the park... ...when he comes popping up out of nowhere, right before my eyes! I figured someone up on high was looking out for me, know what I'm saying?Apollo:\n(Unngh... This sounds bad right from the get-go.)Trucy:\nWell, there won't be any get-go if we don't get some more information!Apollo:\n(Right. First, gather the facts. Time enough for despair later!)After pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:Judge:\nHmm... It seems that there were issues with this doctor.Wocky:\nMan, putting him down was like doing the world a favor!Apollo:\nWocky! ...Please consult your lawyer before saying things like that...Trucy:\nChin up, Apollo! Back straight!Judge:\nBut, why did this mistake only come to light that day?Klavier:\nIt was found during the Family health check-up.Apollo:\nThe F-Family check-up?Wocky:\nThat was the wackest thing of all! All us G's lining up, taking eye exams 'n' all that. Better to die young than fade away, bizzzoy!Klavier:\n...A relief to hear.Wocky:\nEh? Wh-What's a relief!?Klavier:\nOh? Did your father not tell you? That bullet you carry so close to your heart... if not attended to immediately... ...It could kill you.Apollo:\nWh-Whaaat!?Klavier:\nYes, Herr Doktor Meraktis had knowledge concerning this ticking \"time bomb\" in you. Knowledge... that could have saved your life.Wocky:\nNo way! Th-That's wacked!Klavier:\nThere is proof. Your check-up report.Wocky's Check-Up Report added to the Court Record.Klavier:\n...How ironic that you would kill the one man capable of helping you. You're almost as careless as he was! ...Ah ha ha ha.Wocky:\n......Apollo:\n......Klavier:\nWell, now that the place is hopping... Let's get this gig started!Judge:\nS-Started...?Klavier:\nWe've had enough of a warm-up act, ja?

You will tell us your name and occupation.Stickler:\nMy name... is Wesley Stickler. By \"occupation\" I take it you refer to some labor that \"profits\" society at large, and supports a livelihood under which definition I must confess to being \"unemployed\" however, we must acknowledge the meaning of \"identity\" which is commonly attached to this notion of \"occupation\", and once we have accepted this reality, we see that our confusion is not Gestalt, per se, but derives instead from the \"vagueness\" inherent in all representations of thoug--Klavier:\nBy which he means to say that he is a student.

First, we must consider the fact that it was night in the park, which indeed restricted my field of vision due to insufficient levels of illumination.

For example, the defection of a \"meter\" is 1,650,763.73 times the wavelength of the light emitted by a krypton particle, as we all know.

You disappoint me.Apollo:\nN-N-No! I'm obsessed with something big! I mean, there's a bigger, less nitpicky problem here!Judge:\nDo tell...Apollo:\nJust look at the autopsy report! The location of the entry wound was... ...the right temple!Stickler:\nT-Temple...?Apollo:\nMr. Stickler, you said quite clearly that the victim was shot \"square in the forehead\"!

Look, I know the wound was in the wrong place according to this testimony!Stickler:\nNyurk...!Klavier:\nHey, Herr Forehead...Apollo:\n...! (F... \"Forehead\"!?)Klavier:\nLet us imagine you are walking through the park. You see two men facing each other. One with a pistol trained on the other. ...What would you do, Herr Forehead?Apollo:\nWell, I... I guess... I would try to stop them. I'd probably shout, \"Stop!\"Klavier:\nAnd you, Fräulein?Trucy:\nM-Me? Well... I'd probably scream, \"Eeeeeek!\"Klavier:\nAnd you, Herr Stickler? What did you shout, I wonder?Apollo:\nAck...! (If the victim turned his head at the last moment...*gulp*)Stickler:\n...Ah yes. Thank you for jogging my memory.Judge:\nIt sounds like an addendum to the testimony is required.Witness Testimony-- A Night in the Park 2 --Stickler:\nAs soon as the killer raised his pistol, I took action.\n\"Cease this at once, you two!\" I cried... with composure.\nThe victim turned in the direction of my voice... and a shot rang out.\nWhereupon our cowardly killer, the defendant, appeared to have become frightened.\nTossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.Judge:\nI see... So you attempted to stop the crime.Stickler:\nIndeed. ...With composure.Trucy:\nWell, maybe the criminal wouldn't have fired if he hadn't shouted like that.Apollo:\nTh-That doesn't really matter now, unfortunately.Klavier:\nLet us consider this new testimony, shall we? ...Observe the diagram, if you would. The witness... Mr. Stickler, was it? Stood here. He shouted, \"Oh stop! Please!\" or something of this nature. And the victim responded by looking in the witness's direction! If the killer were to have fired at just that moment... As we can see, the bullet would have struck the right temple, as in the report.Judge:\nThat does seem to be the case.Stickler:\nWitness the power of a Junior in Ivy University's Department of Science!Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Justice, you may cross-examine the witness.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- A Night in the Park 2 --Stickler:\nAs soon as the killer raised his pistol, I took action.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nSo you saw a raised pistol... Weren't you frightened?\nStickler:\nIt can be said we students of Ivy University know no fear. The moment I saw that pistol, my inner sense of justice compelled me to take action!\nJudge:\nThat was certainly brave of you. You might have gotten shot!\nStickler:\nEh!?\nKlavier:\nYou certainly were lucky. If I were in the killer's shoes, I certainly wouldn't have left a witness behind.\nStickler:\n......!\nTrucy:\nHe actually looks like he had no idea he was in danger.\nStickler:\nR-Regardless, I attempted to halt the bloodshed!Stickler:\n\"Cease this at once, you two!\" I cried... with composure.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAre you sure both men were able to hear your voice?\nStickler:\nThey were, of course. My high, exquisite voice echoed through the park.\nKlavier:\nAnd the victim responded to that clarion call...\nStickler:\nQuite.Stickler:\nThe victim turned in the direction of my voice... and a shot rang out.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nDid you hear the gunshot at the same time as the victim turned?\nStickler:\nIndeed. I would say \"about\" the same time, to be precise.\nApollo:\nAnd the victim didn't ask you for help?\nStickler:\nIt can be said that he didn't have time to ask. He didn't even have time to take a single step.\nTrucy:\nI'm totally sure that the killer fired because Mr. Stickler startled him.\nApollo:\nDon't say that too loud, Trucy, please...Stickler:\nWhereupon our cowardly killer, the defendant, appeared to have become frightened.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nCan you describe the killer's actions more clearly?\nStickler:\nHe seemed quite surprised, especially considering that it was he who did the deed! As we can see, human psychology is a tangled web, indeed.\nKlavier:\nHe simply couldn't believe what he had done. He shot, he panicked. A common tale, but true.\nStickler:\nUnfortunately, before I could take further action...Stickler:\nTossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou didn't try to apprehend the criminal?\nStickler:\nIt all happened so fast, I'm afraid I hadn't the time.\nTrucy:\nDoesn't something about that strike you as odd, Apollo?\nApollo:\n...! What?\nTrucy:\nThe killer was in a hurry, right? He fired the pistol, and tossed it right away...\nApollo:\nAccording to the testimony, that's what happened, yes.\nTrucy:\nIn that case, I'd expect to find something that we didn't find!\nApollo:\n(Find \"something\"? Find what?)Present Pistol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWait a second!\nSticker:\nTsk, tsk, another misleading request. Yet you're so beholden to your own mode of \"discourse\" you can't see how it affects you!\nApollo:\nUm... come again?\nStickler:\nWait a \"second\", you say? A \"second\"? Are we intended to wait just that, a single second, one sixtieth of a minute? That's hardly enough time to draw a breath, let alone make a statement in court! Now, had you asked for a longer period of time, say, 3 minutes, 35 seconds, th--\nJudge:\nMr. Justice.\nApollo:\nYes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nAm I to understand you are objecting to the length of a second?\nApollo:\nYes! I mean, no! Here, just look at the pistol! It doesn't have a single fingerprint on it!\nStickler:\nAh, a common ploy, made all the more common, I fear, by the prevalence of television. Criminals these days are loathe to leave fingerprints.\nApollo:\nWait! But you said the killer tossed the gun and ran!\nTrucy:\nThat's right! He didn't have time to wipe the gun for prints!\nStickler:\n...!\nKlavier:\nAh, the little girl sticking it to the university student. There's a song in there...\nTrucy:\nI'm not little!\nKlavier:\nA ha ha ha... Then let's think like adults, shall we, Fräulein?\nTrucy:\nEh...?\nKlavier:\nWhat if the killer... the defendant, was wearing gloves?\nTrucy:\n... Gotta admit, I didn't think of that, Apollo.\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\n(Could the killer have been wearing gloves...?)\n\n\n\nI guess...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(If he was wearing gloves, there wouldn't be prints...) ... (C'mon Justice, you've gotta come up with something...!)\nJudge:\nIs there something you want to tell the court, Mr. Justice?\nKlavier:\nHis silence speaks louder than words, Herr Judge. He can think of nothing... nein?\nApollo:\nI g-guess he could have been wearing gloves. (...I guess.)\nJudge:\nThen let's continue with the testimony. If you would.\nStickler:\n...My pleasure, Your Honor. A small pleasure, but still.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nNo way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The record of the murder weapon is very clear about one thing:\"Trucy:\nI liked that contradiction. Kinda sad to see it go.Apollo:\nNot as sad as I feel. What do we do now?Trucy:\nAt least the testimony's getting a little clearer.Apollo:\n(She's right! Maybe I can find something to use in this new testimony.)",

Weren't you frightened?\nStickler:\nIt can be said we students of Ivy University know no fear. The moment I saw that pistol, my inner sense of justice compelled me to take action!\nJudge:\nThat was certainly brave of you. You might have gotten shot!\nStickler:\nEh!?\nKlavier:\nYou certainly were lucky. If I were in the killer's shoes, I certainly wouldn't have left a witness behind.\nStickler:\n......!\nTrucy:\nHe actually looks like he had no idea he was in danger.\nStickler:\nR-Regardless, I attempted to halt the bloodshed!Stickler:\n\"Cease this at once, you two!\" I cried... with composure.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAre you sure both men were able to hear your voice?\nStickler:\nThey were, of course. My high, exquisite voice echoed through the park.\nKlavier:\nAnd the victim responded to that clarion call...\nStickler:\nQuite.Stickler:\nThe victim turned in the direction of my voice... and a shot rang out.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nDid you hear the gunshot at the same time as the victim turned?\nStickler:\nIndeed. I would say \"about\" the same time, to be precise.\nApollo:\nAnd the victim didn't ask you for help?\nStickler:\nIt can be said that he didn't have time to ask. He didn't even have time to take a single step.\nTrucy:\nI'm totally sure that the killer fired because Mr. Stickler startled him.\nApollo:\nDon't say that too loud, Trucy, please...Stickler:\nWhereupon our cowardly killer, the defendant, appeared to have become frightened.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nCan you describe the killer's actions more clearly?\nStickler:\nHe seemed quite surprised, especially considering that it was he who did the deed! As we can see, human psychology is a tangled web, indeed.\nKlavier:\nHe simply couldn't believe what he had done. He shot, he panicked. A common tale, but true.\nStickler:\nUnfortunately, before I could take further action...Stickler:\nTossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou didn't try to apprehend the criminal?\nStickler:\nIt all happened so fast, I'm afraid I hadn't the time.\nTrucy:\nDoesn't something about that strike you as odd, Apollo?\nApollo:\n...! What?\nTrucy:\nThe killer was in a hurry, right? He fired the pistol, and tossed it right away...\nApollo:\nAccording to the testimony, that's what happened, yes.\nTrucy:\nIn that case, I'd expect to find something that we didn't find!\nApollo:\n(Find \"something\"? Find what?)Present Pistol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWait a second!\nSticker:\nTsk, tsk, another misleading request. Yet you're so beholden to your own mode of \"discourse\" you can't see how it affects you!\nApollo:\nUm... come again?\nStickler:\nWait a \"second\", you say? A \"second\"? Are we intended to wait just that, a single second, one sixtieth of a minute? That's hardly enough time to draw a breath, let alone make a statement in court! Now, had you asked for a longer period of time, say, 3 minutes, 35 seconds, th--\nJudge:\nMr. Justice.\nApollo:\nYes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nAm I to understand you are objecting to the length of a second?\nApollo:\nYes! I mean, no! Here, just look at the pistol! It doesn't have a single fingerprint on it!\nStickler:\nAh, a common ploy, made all the more common, I fear, by the prevalence of television. Criminals these days are loathe to leave fingerprints.\nApollo:\nWait! But you said the killer tossed the gun and ran!\nTrucy:\nThat's right! He didn't have time to wipe the gun for prints!\nStickler:\n...!\nKlavier:\nAh, the little girl sticking it to the university student. There's a song in there...\nTrucy:\nI'm not little!\nKlavier:\nA ha ha ha... Then let's think like adults, shall we, Fräulein?\nTrucy:\nEh...?\nKlavier:\nWhat if the killer... the defendant, was wearing gloves?\nTrucy:\n... Gotta admit, I didn't think of that, Apollo.\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\n(Could the killer have been wearing gloves...?)\n\n\n\nI guess...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(If he was wearing gloves, there wouldn't be prints...) ... (C'mon Justice, you've gotta come up with something...!)\nJudge:\nIs there something you want to tell the court, Mr. Justice?\nKlavier:\nHis silence speaks louder than words, Herr Judge. He can think of nothing... nein?\nApollo:\nI g-guess he could have been wearing gloves. (...I guess.)\nJudge:\nThen let's continue with the testimony. If you would.\nStickler:\n...My pleasure, Your Honor. A small pleasure, but still.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nNo way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The record of the murder weapon is very clear about one thing:\"Trucy:\nI liked that contradiction. Kinda sad to see it go.Apollo:\nNot as sad as I feel. What do we do now?Trucy:\nAt least the testimony's getting a little clearer.Apollo:\n(She's right! Maybe I can find something to use in this new testimony.)Apollo:\nThe record of the murder weapon is very clear about one thing: The fingerprints were \"wiped\" which means some trace of prints remained! Which contradicts your testimony! If everything happened as you say it did, he wouldn't have had time to wipe the pistol!Stickler:\n...That may be. But it does not change what I saw. The killer... the defendant... He threw down the murderous weapon from his hand and fled.Judge:\nHmm...Stickler:\nAnd this pistol was found at the scene of the crime. Strongly suggesting that this was the weapon he disposed of!Klavier:\nThat sounds solid to me. Well, Herr Forehead? Any of your precious \"objections\"?Apollo:\n...Trucy:\nWhat gives, Apollo!? Let's see that voice training go to work!Apollo:\nYou know, I've only recently realized something. No matter how much you train your voice, it doesn't matter if you have nothing to say.Trucy:\nWhat do you mean, \"nothing to say\"!? Isn't it obvious from what the witness just said?Apollo:\nHuh? Isn't what obvious?Trucy:\nWhen he re-stated what he saw just now, he said he saw Wocky drop a \"murderous weapon\". But that's not the same as being 100% sure of what Wocky threw away!Apollo:\nYou're right!Trucy:\nHe's just confused because a pistol was found at the scene! Poor Mr. Stickler... It must be hard to be so perfect, and yet so wrong.Stickler:\nW-Well! It can be said that I'm quite offended! While it is, indeed, true that once, in my youth, I wrote a love letter in my own blood that was seized by the teacher and posted on the blackboard for all to see, and for this the appellation \"poor\" might as well be prefixed to my name, yet as for the issue at ha--Judge:\nWhat we can say for certain is that the witness saw the killer throw \"something\"... Does the defense have anything to say about this?Trucy:\nWell, if what he threw wasn't a pistol...Apollo:\nThen it had to be something else!Klavier:\nAt least one person on the defense team seems to be thinking.Apollo:\n(Grr... I'll wipe that smile off your pretty face, Gavin!)Judge:\nPerhaps you can inform the court as to the nature of this \"something else\"? What did the killer throw away before fleeing the scene?Present Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Is that... a sword?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWhat the witness really saw... was this! Or... something like it.\nJudge:\n... Penalty.\nApollo:\n(That didn't even warrant a wise-crack, did it.)\nJudge:\nPerhaps you'd like to try that again, Mr. Justice?\nLeads back to:\n\"What did the killer throw away before fleeing the scene?\"Judge:\nIs that... a sword? I saw one of those on the late night movie last night!Apollo:\n(Great, a sleep-deprived judge...) This knife was found at the scene of the crime... with the defendant's prints on it.Judge:\nHis prints!Apollo:\nThis single piece of evidence proves two important things: One, that what the defendant threw down wasn't a pistol. Two, that the defendant wasn't wearing gloves!Judge:\nHmm... Indeed!Klavier:\nOh, Herr Forehead? You're forgetting two other things you've just proven.Apollo:\nHuh?Klavier:\nOne, that the man the witness saw was the defendant, Mr. Wocky Kitaki. Two, that the defendant was holding a knife, with the intent of harming the victim!Apollo:\nOh.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed!Apollo:\n(Grr... Never underestimate a Gavin is the lesson here.)Judge:\nThis court is of the opinion that our witness is fond of making assumptions. In that light, I believe it would behoove us to hear about what really occurred... ...with less assuming, please!Stickler:\nIt is always the same with you people. \"Mark left the house on foot, and five minutes later, his brother left after him. How long would it take for Mark's brother to catch up to him... ...assuming that Mark never had to stop for a traffic light!\" \"Assuming\"... Yes, that's what I said. \"Assuming\"! As if that were a probable situation at all! Yet here you are \"assuming\" that my \"assumption\" is no better!Judge:\nAhem. What this court \"assumes\"... ...is that the witness will testify as to what happened after the shot was fired!Witness Testimony-- From Shot to Call --Stickler:\nI could not prevent the killer from leaving the scene.\nNor could I simply leave the scene in good conscience.\nErgo! I used my cell phone to call the police.\nUntil the police arrived at the scene 10 minutes later, I saw no one else.Apollo:\nWhy didn't you chase the killer?Stickler:\nHe was, as you say, a killer. Of course, I could have run him down, yet what would he have done when cornered? Sadly, it takes more than an aptitude for solving quadratic equations to know that.Judge:\nHmm...Klavier:\nDid the testimony earlier not prove the defendant's presence at the scene? And do we not also now know that there was no one else there? ...It seems clear that we have our killer. Does it not?Judge:\nDoes it not, Mr. Justice?Apollo:\n(I'd better find a way to take this testimony down quick!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- From Shot to Call --Stickler:\nI could not prevent the killer from leaving the scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWhich way did the killer run?\nStickler:\nBy that time, it was clear the killer had noticed me.

Perhaps the killer really was wearing gloves which wiped the previous user's prints off. Then, after the deed was done, this fell out of his pocket as he was throwing the gun away. A mistake befitting of a small-time punk, in my opinion.Apollo:\nNo... Nooooooooooo!Judge:\nIt seems we've come to the end of the line here.Apollo:\n(No... that can't be all!)Klavier:\nHow unfortunate. It seems that you weren't cut out to stand on the same stage as me.

What are you suggesting I do?Trucy:\nLook, once the judge declares a verdict, it's all over. If I can use my talent to stop that from happening, I will!Apollo:\nTrucy, no more staged abductions, please...Trucy:\nI'm not talking about magic, Apollo! I know when the witness isn't confident... I can perceive what he's feeling! It might not mean anything, but it's all we've got...Apollo:\nYou can see... what he's \"feeling\"?Trucy:\nThink back, Apollo!

All the times!Apollo:\nAll the times there was a contradiction...?I remember\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nWell, I think I remember them, sure...\nLeads to:\n\"There were two times when he made statements he wasn't confident in.\"I don't remember\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nUm...

And each time, there was a contradiction.Stickler:\nIn his hand he held.. yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.Stickler:\nTossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.Trucy:\nHe said the man tossed aside a pistol... But it turned out he wasn't sure, and sure enough, there was a contradiction.Apollo:\nWell, that's true, but how does that help us?Trucy:\nDidn't you notice anything? Whenever he made a statement he wasn't confident in... ...he displayed a certain habit!Stickler:\nIn his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.Trucy:\nDid you see it? The very moment he said the word \"pistol\"... ...his fingers got all tense, and he fiddled with the corner of a page in his book!Apollo:\nHow'm I supposed to see that!?Trucy:\nWell, I could see it. How else do you think Daddy went seven years without losing a game of poker?Apollo:\nWha--!?Trucy:\nI always sat next to Daddy during big matches. I could see what his opponents were feeling!Apollo:\nYou mean that's how Mr. Wright won all those games?Trucy:\nIt's not cheating, officially. I wasn't looking at their hands or anything. And I wasn't there all the time, either. Daddy's quite good at poker, after all. But not good enough to go undefeated that long!Apollo:\nGreat, so he cheated. But what does that do for us? (I don't believe this...)Trucy:\nYou have to listen to his testimony one more time! No... scratch that! You have to watch his testimony! Perceive the truth!Apollo:\n\"Watch\" a testimony? \"Perceive\" the truth? The only thing I'm perceiving is that I'm going to lose.Trucy:\nNot true!Apollo:\n...!Trucy:\nDaddy said so. He said you have the power, Apollo.Apollo:\nMr. Wright said that? (Watch the testimony... Perceive his true feelings... Is she serious!?)Trucy:\nTime's up! Sorry I can't think of any other way out of this one, Apollo.Apollo:\n(What was that she said before the trial started?)Apollo:\nHuh... Mr. Wright's not here today?Trucy:\nHe said his old foot injury was acting up. Yes, he smiled when he said we'd be fine \"as long as you're there, Trucy\".Apollo:\n(Is this what he meant by us being \"fine\"...? Well... methods aside, she did avoid one guilty verdict already today. Time to show this court what I'm made of! Get ready for Justice!) ...Let's do it.Trucy:\nApollo...Apollo:\nYou know, I'm starting to think I can do this.Trucy:\n...I knew you could do it all along!

I settled that.Judge:\nYou \"settled\" that...?Apollo:\nErm, yes, it was an... out of court settlement! Right.Klavier:\nPerhaps Fräulein would have us believe it was nothing more than a passing dream... ...a fantastic illusion, now you see it, now you don't. Am I right?Trucy:\n...I think he's on to me.Apollo:\nI wish he would stop being so... so cool.Klavier:\nLet us dispense with these niceties and get straight to the matter. What are your plans for our gifted witness?Apollo:\nR-Right... The defense would like to request another cross-examination! B-Because... Because I forgot to ask something.Judge:\nThere was no issue with the witness's previous testimony. I will grant your request, however.

When he says something he's not sure of, he fiddles with a page of his book.Trucy:\nYou got it! Right now, you're looking at the witness's face. ...And your eyes are sort of bugging out.Apollo:\n(I'll bet they are.)Trucy:\nFirst, move your focus of attention down to Mr. Stickler's hand.Apollo:\nHis hand...?Trucy:\nYou know what to look for now, but you have to be looking at the right place.Apollo:\n(She's right. I can only see his face like this... Time to try changing my viewpoint!)Focus on page corner of book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Perfect! Now you're really ready!\"Trucy:\nPerfect! Now you're really ready!Apollo:\nReady... for what?Trucy:\nReady to perceive the truth behind the twitch!Apollo:\nPerceive... ([Percieve] highlighted in the original release)Trucy:\nTry listening to the witness talk as you focus. Then watch for his habit.Apollo:\nRight... You mean when he fiddles with the page!Trucy:\nThat's right! That's your signal to look closer, to perceive with [X / Y / R]! (Changed from [That's right! That's your signal to look closer, to perceive!] in the original release) Find his weak spot and I guarantee we'll be able to give him the Royal Flush!Apollo:\nSpoken like a true poker head's daughter.Trucy:\nI'm a magician, thank you very much.Apollo:\n(So I have to pay attention to his words... and his fingers!)Trucy:\nDon't worry if you miss it, you can always try again!Apollo:\n(Right! Look out nervous twitch, here comes Justice!)Perceive hand twitch on page corner on \"I used my cell phone\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"............\"Perceive wrong area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nTrucy:\nA-Apollo! That's not it!\nApollo:\nHuh? Oh... I guess I'm kind of lost here.\nTrucy:\nRemember his habit: He fiddles with the pages of his book! The word he's saying right when you see his fingers twitch is the key!\nApollo:\n(OK, so I have to watch for his fingers to move. Got it.)\nTrucy:\nAnd don't worry about getting it perfect your first time. You can always try again!\nLeads back to perceive sectionApollo:\n............ (I... I saw it! Just now... I could see it!)Judge:\nM-Mr. Justice? Do you have something to say?Stickler:\nA-all this b-banging of desks! I-It's quite bad for my circulation, you know.Apollo:\nMr. Stickler... Allow me to ask you a simple question. Why did you fiddle with the page of your book just now? ...The very moment you mentioned your cell phone!?Stickler:\nWh-Wh-What are you talking about!?Apollo:\nI'm curious now about this cell phone of yours... Mind if I ask a few questions? (Hmm... What to ask, What to ask...)Ask for his number\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nMr. Stickler... Tell me your phone number!\nStickler:\nUrk!? Wh-Why? Whatever for?\nKlavier:\n...Why not? You have something against making friends?\nJudge:\n...What does this witness's cell phone number have to do with the case?\nStickler:\nAbsolutely nothing! This is a... an invasion of my privacy!\nJudge:\nHmm... Seeing you grimace like that makes me wonder about your cell phone, too. The witness will present his cell phone number to the court.\nStickler:\nWaaaugh!\nApollo:\nTrucy... Do you have your cell phone?\nTrucy:\nSure do!\nApollo:\nTry dialing the number that he gives us.\nTrucy:\nYou want me to call Mr. Stickler's phone?\nJudge:\nThis... is all highly irregular.\nTrucy:\nH-Hey! My pocket's ringing! Wait! This is the phone from yesterday!\n\n\nApollo:\nLook... a cell phone.\nTrucy:\nSomeone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure!\nApollo:\nHmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here?\n\n\nApollo:\nHow strange, Mr. Stickler.\nStickler:\n...!\nApollo:\nCan you explain why your cell phone is sitting here in my assistant's hand!?\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a minute! What is the meaning of this!?\"Ask to see his phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nMr. Stickler, please show me your cell phone!\nStickler:\nUrk!? Wh-Why?

Is this your cell phone?\nStickler:\nYeeeeow! Wh-Where did you get that!?\nTrucy:\nThat's the phone from yesterday!\n\n\nApollo:\nLook... a cell phone.\nTrucy:\nSomeone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure!\nApollo:\nHmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here?\n\n\nApollo:\nHow strange, Mr. Stickler.\nStickler:\n...!\nApollo:\nCan you explain why your cell phone is sitting here in my hand at this very moment?\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a minute! What is the meaning of this!?\"Ask what model of phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nI was wondering... Can you tell me what model of cell phone you own?\nStickler:\nUrk!? Wh-Why? Whatever for?\nKlavier:\nWhy not tell him? It's not some matter of national security, I'm sure. Nor does it have anything to do with this case! Take it to the lobby, gentlemen.\nJudge:\nMr. Justice, our current market is flooded with generic-brand cell phones. Please ask questions with a little regard for market trends, please.\nTrucy:\n...Who would have guessed the judge was up on his cell phone industry trends?\nApollo:\nWho would have guessed I'd get chewed out for asking a simple question...?\nLeads back to:\n\"Hmm... What to ask, What to ask...\"Judge:\nWait a minute! What is the meaning of this!?Apollo:\nThis cell phone was found yesterday... ...in the Meraktis Clinic garage!Judge:\nThe Meraktis... Why, that's where the victim lived!Stickler:\nYeeeeeerrgh! Th-That's impossible!Apollo:\nMr. Stickler, you lied to the court, didn't you? If your cell phone is here, how could you have called the police!?Stickler:\nWeeeeeeeeeeeeeouk!Stickler:\nIt... It's true. I didn't have my cell phone that night. That is why it can be said that I called the police from a public pay phone.Judge:\nA pay phone! So you didn't call on your cell phone after all...Apollo:\nJust where was this pay phone located, Mr. Stickler!?Stickler:\nWell, to indicate it with a startlingly high degree of accuracy... ...it was right around here.Judge:\nThat's... quite a ways from the park. But... But why did you lie?Apollo:\nThere can be only one reason. He didn't want the court to know he had lost his cell phone. Because it was found... ...in the victim's garage!Stickler:\nWh-Wh-What are you saying!?Apollo:\nMr. Stickler... You broke into the Meraktis Clinic garage on the night of the murder! This cell phone tells all!Stickler:\nB-But that's ridiculous! That makes it sound like... Like I snuck into this fellow's garage to commit some crime! As though I were trying to kill him!Judge:\nWell, Dr. Meraktis was killed that night.Stickler:\nW-Well y-yes, but no! This line of reasoning has to be against the rules! Yes, it's true! I lost my cell phone! But you can't prove that I lost it that night!Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Justice? If that cell phone was dropped the night of the murder... ...it does raise considerable suspicions as to a connection with the crime.Trucy:\nNow's your chance, Apollo! Connect Mr. Stickler to the crime!Apollo:\nOh, he's already connected enough. I just have to prove it. (Well... Do I have a piece of evidence that can do the job? Can I prove the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder?)Show evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nOf course I have evidence!\nKlavier:\nOoh, I like your swagger, Herr Forehead. Hit it.\nJudge:\nThe court will see this evidence. Mr. Justice, \"hit it\", as they say!\nLeads to:\n\"The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:\"No evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(Evidence... If only I had some evidence, it'd make this whole thing a lot easier.)\nJudge:\nCare to explain the lack of confidence smeared across your face, Mr. Justice?\nKlavier:\nOh, Herr Forehead... I think it should be clear by now. \"No evidence\" means \"no case\".\nApollo:\n(Ack! I guess this is it, then. Time to go for broke!)\nLeads to:\n\"The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:\"Apollo:\nThe evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:Present Mirror\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"That's... a side-view mirror?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nNo comment, Herr Judge.\nJudge:\nNo dice, Mr. Justice. Penalty.\nTrucy:\nApollo! Remember where we found that cell phone! If it had fallen on the ground before that night...\nApollo:\n(That's right! The cell phone would have been crushed!) Your Honor! One more chance, please!\nJudge:\nMr. Justice, keep this up and you'll run yourself out of a life's worth of chances!\nLeads back to:\n\"The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:\"Judge:\nThat's... a side-view mirror?Apollo:\nAs it so happens... Dr. Meraktis's car was in an accident... ...that took place the night of the murder!Stickler:\nAn accident!?Apollo:\nAn accident. It happened a little after 9 PM, just outside People Park... our murder scene. Dr. Meraktis's car hit a pedestrian!Stickler:\nWh-What are you trying to say?Apollo:\nFrom the absence of a mirror, it's clear that the car was parked after the accident. Which means it was parked there after 9 PM on the night of the murder. If your cell phone had been dropped before the car was parked in that garage... ...then it would have been crushed. After all, it was lying on the ground, right under the wheel!Stickler:\nUrk...Apollo:\nErgo, Mr. Stickler! The only time you could have dropped this in that garage... ...was after 9 PM the night of the murder in the park!Stickler:\nWeeeeeeeeoooorrgh!Apollo:\nMr. Stickler! You know what this means? You did break into the victim's garage that night.Judge:\nThis is most unexpected! Mr. Justice... Are you naming the witness as a suspect in the murder of Pal Meraktis!?Stickler:\nN-No, stop! This is too much! This can't be happening! P-P-P-P-Prosecutor! Say something!Klavier:\nI suppose it is worth saying this: No connection has been found between Wesley Stickler and Pal Meraktis. That is, other than this.Judge:\nI believe our next testimony will be most... revelatory. Is the witness prepared?Stickler:\nY-Y-Yes, Your Honor!!!Apollo:\n(I know that face... That's the face of guilt!)Trucy:\n...Witness Testimony-- Stickler's \"Truth\" --Stickler:\nThat night... Yes! I went to the supermarket.\nI must have dropped my cell phone on my way back.\nAnd when I was walking through the park, I happened to witness the crime!\n...I saw the killer, the victim, the stand... all as clear as day!\nIt was him! I saw the defendant at the scene!Judge:\nYes... but your cell phone was lying in a garage.Stickler:\nAh, yes, well, as you can see my model of cell phone has a defect... It is given to rolling! It's quite a pain when I drop it alongside the road, you know.Judge:\n...Looks like a normal cell phone to me. In any case, Mr. Justice, the cross-examination, please.Apollo:\n(That's funny... My bracelet didn't react at all during that testimony.)Trucy:\nHis nervous habit must not be acting up... I didn't sense anything either, actually. Looks like you're on your own this time around!Apollo:\n(Right, no problem... I hope. Here comes Justice!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Stickler's \"Truth\" --Stickler:\nThat night... Yes! I went to the supermarket.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nSo you went shopping. Which means... ...you were holding a grocery bag when you witnessed the murder taking place?\nStickler:\nEh!? W-Well, yes, of course...\nKlavier:\nIncidentally, the prosecution has received no report of this domestic detail.\nJudge:\n...Mr. Stickler? Can you explain yourself?\nStickler:\nNo! I mean, yes! I did go shopping, really. I walked around the supermarket, trying out the free samples... It's... a deeply spiritual time for me.\nJudge:\nI'm sure the store clerks would disagree.\nTrucy:\nDo you think sampling free food counts as a religion?\nStickler:\nIn any case! That night... ...I sampled to my heart's content, and was on my way back home, yes.Stickler:\nI must have dropped my cell phone on my way back.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThat's when you passed in front of the Meraktis Clinic?\nStickler:\nWhy... yes. That's correct.\nTrucy:\nThat was a pretty suspicious pause there.\nApollo:\nMr. Stickler, do you think you could be a bit more specific? Please show us the exact route you took on the night of the murder.\nStickler:\nO-Of course. The supermarket is here, along the main road. My way home from there takes me past the Meraktis Clinic. This is probably when I dropped my cell phone. Yet, woe is I, I walked on, unaware of my loss! ...And walked right into that fateful park.Stickler:\nAnd when I was walking through the park, I happened to witness the crime!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWhich entrance did you enter the park from?\nStickler:\nWell, to be exact... One might say that I went in from the entrance closest to the Meraktis Clinic.\nKlavier:\nThe same entrance our victim used.\nApollo:\nDid you notice anything when you entered? Wheel marks from a noodle stand, for instance?\nStickler:\n...I have no recollection of such a thing, no. Yet, though I might have missed the tracks, I could not miss what happened next! I can a keen observer... of the obvious, you might say.Stickler:\n...I saw the killer, the victim, the stand... all as clear as day!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n(This part of the testimony is the key. I know it! Should I press him about the killer, the victim, or the noodle stand?)\n\n\n\nThe killer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nAre you sure you remember the killer clearly?\nStickler:\nHow many times must I repeat myself!? It was him, that unscrupulous, fox-like fellow in the defendant's chair! He was looking even more unscrupulous at the time, no less.\nJudge:\nHmm... He does look a bit like one of those trickster foxes in legends of yore.\nApollo:\n(I guess the victim's identity is already old territory... Time to ask something new.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nThe victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nYou could see the victim quite clearly, too?\nStickler:\nOh, clear as clear can be, I assure you.\nApollo:\nI see. So... Um... How'd he look?\nStickler:\nHow? How do you mean, \"how\"? Be specific.\nApollo:\nUm, I mean, in general.\nJudge:\nThe defense will refrain from straining to come up with questions. Find the question that lies in your heart and ask that!\nApollo:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (Great, a judge who moonlights as a self-help guru...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nThe noodle stand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nDo you happen to remember the noodle stand?\nStickler:\nQuite well, yes! For a student of the sciences, keen observation and healthy curiosity are vital! I remember everything! I could even read the sign! I believe it said... Er... \"NOODLE\". ......... Yes, that was it.\nJudge:\nFor remembering something \"quite well\" it sure took you a while to tell us. And thank you for telling us that a noodle stand sells noodles. Very enlightening. Well, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\n(Hmm... What about that sign? Could that be important?)\n\n\n\nNot at all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(How could the sign matter at all? We know it's a noodle stand!)\nJudge:\nVery well, please continue with the testimony!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nVery important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nSo the sign on the noodle stand said \"NOODLE\"...? It appears the defense has just obtained a vital piece of testimony!\nJudge:\nIs this noodle stand's broth really that delicious? I'll have to go sample the wares one of these days. I think that's worth adding to the testimony as well.\nStickler:\n...Hmph! Whatever sort of noodles that stand sells, it can't match up to Ivy U.'s cafeteria! Some apply to the school merely for a taste of our Smart Noodles!\nApollo:\n(I wouldn't mind a taste of that myself...)\nAdds statement \"Why, I even remember the sign on the stand the victim was pulling! It said \"NOODLE\"!\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nMr. Stickler, you've proven to be a most skilled witness.\nStickler:\nSkilled? What do you mean?\nApollo:\nI thank you for your powers of recollection. Your testimony just now was quite vital.\nKlavier:\nSomething going on up in your noodle, Herr Forehead?\nApollo:\n(If my gut feeling here is right... I've just stumbled across a major contradiction!)Stickler:\nWhy, I even remember the sign on the stand the victim was pulling! It said \"NOODLE\"!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nSo the sign said \"NOODLE\"? You're absolutely sure?\nStickler:\nLet me be frank: Yes. In fact, the word \"unsure\" isn't even in my dictionary! Nor the word \"uncertain\" or...\nApollo:\n(He was wasting time looking that stuff up!?)\nJudge:\n\"NOODLE\", eh? I like that. It tells you what you're getting, no nonsense.\nApollo:\n(It tells me a lot more than that, actually!)\nTrucy:\nWhy are you smiling like that, Apollo?Present Noodle Stand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"And you're absolutely sure the sign read \"NOODLE\"?\"Stickler:\nIt was him! I saw the defendant at the scene!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAre you absolutely sure it was the defendant?\nStickler:\nStop asking me the same questions over and over! This isn't some kind of make-up test!\nTrucy:\nWhat's a \"make-up test\", Apollo?\nApollo:\nNothing a good student like you has to worry about. (Time to find his weak spot and press it till he breaks!)Trucy:\nHis habit isn't acting up... which means he isn't lying.Apollo:\n(Hmm... I was kind of relying on my bracelet to get me through this one...)Trucy:\nBut he's pretty unsettled! The odds are really high that you can get something out of him!Apollo:\nThat gleam in your eyes... You're a gambler's daughter through and through.Trucy:\nI'm a magician, thank you very much!",

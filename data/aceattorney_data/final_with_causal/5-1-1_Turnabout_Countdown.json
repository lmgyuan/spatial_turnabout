Time to bring it to an end.\"Episode 1Turnabout Countdown???:\nHeh heh heh! The best thing about bombs is how they erase and destroy... without discretion. Now all I have to do is pin everything on that little girl!December 17, 9:22 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 5Athena:\n(Hmm... Nope! Not feeling nervous at all! It's amazing what a girl can get used to! Even a tense atmosphere like this is no biggie!)???:\nYou doing okay, Athena?Athena:\nOh, Apollo! Y-Yeah, doing great! Like, hum-a-little-tune great!Apollo:\nOh, yeah? Well, that's good to hear. Although... I could've sworn I heard your voice crack for a second there.Athena:\n(Oof! I'm THAT transparent, huh?) Cracking? N-No, my voice isn't cracking! Nerves of steel, here, I tell you! (This is Apollo Justice. He's a fellow lawyer at the office I work for. Apollo is the lead for the defense on this case. But I'm going to be there at the bench with him, doing what I can to help out. I'll do whatever it takes to defend Junie!) Speaking of steel, how are you holding up? That explosion really did a number on you...Apollo:\nI'm just happy that you're okay, Athena. Although... I can't pretend I have no connection to this case. That's why I'm gonna see to it that Juniper's name is cleared! And I'm sure you feel much the same way.Athena:\nYou got that right! I won't rest until Junie is completely cleared of all suspicion!???:\nApollo, Thena... Thank you... for doing this for me.Athena:\nJunie!Woods:\n...... *cough* *cough, cough*Athena:\nHey, are you okay?Woods:\n...Sorry about that. I always seem to go into coughing fits whenever I get nervous. This kind of thing never happens *cough* at home in the forest, though. *cough*Athena:\n(This is Juniper Woods. She's my dear, dear childhood friend, and she's also our client for this case. The news keeps repeating that Junie is the \"alleged bomber\"... But that's ridiculous! There's no way Junie would do anything like that!)Woods:\nI brought you a little snack, Thena... Just a little something from my garden.Athena:\nHey, thanks! So, um... Is this an orange or a tangerine?Woods:\nIt's an orange! My grandma says... ...that orange is the color of strength and endurance.Athena:\nOh, I get it! Strength for the trial, right? (Junie... You're always so good to me. Geez, look at me! Standing here clutching an orange to my chest with tears in my eyes...) Well, don't you worry! We'll be so powerful in there, they won't know what hit them! Right, Apollo?!Apollo:\nYeah... that's right. Come what may... this is one trial... we just can't lose...!Woods:\nApollooooooooo!Athena:\nApollo!Apollo:\nUngh...Athena:\n(Blood is seeping through his bandages! One of his wounds must've reopened. All this time, he was trying to put on a brave face, but he was really overdoing it.)Mr. Justice!Athena:\n(Huh?)Bailiff:\nThe trial is about to start, sir. Please proceed to the courtroom.Athena:\n(What?! Now?! But Apollo's in no state to defend!)Apollo:\n*huff, huff*... Aaaaargh! I... I have to... defend Juniper!Athena:\n(What are we gonna do?! The trial is about to start, with or without us! There's only one other option I can think of at a time like this... But even if I called him now, he'd never get here in time! .........No, wait! There's something else I can do!) Apollo, give me all the evidence for the case.Apollo:\nHuh...? What are you gonna do?Athena:\nBailiff.Bailiff:\nY-Yes, Miss?Athena:\nThe defense would like to submit a substitution of attorney petition.Woods:\nThena!Apollo:\nYou're not seriously--Athena:\nYou just concentrate on getting better. I'll defend Junie!Apollo:\nAll by yourself?! Athena, stop for a sec and think about what you're saying! You've never once taken a case on alone before, right?!Athena:\n¡No hay problema! I can handle it! (I think.) But I guess it's really up to you, Junie. Would you be okay with me taking over?Woods:\nUm......... Sure. I believe in you, Thena, and that's enough for me.Apollo:\n............Athena:\nYou're worried for me, aren't you? To be honest, I'm pretty nervous, too. I think my heart might just burst out of my chest! But you're in no shape to stand at the bench now. So you'll just have to leave it to me!Apollo:\n............ ...All right. I can see your mind's made up anyway. I hate it that I can't be there... but I know you'll give your utmost to defend Juniper!Athena:\nYou bet I will! Rest assured of that!Athena:\n(My name is Athena Cykes. I'm still just a newbie, but I'm a lawyer. This is... only the second time I've taken the lead in a defense case. It'll be the first time I stand up there alone, though. But I have to do this! And I'm definitely not about to let anything bad happen to Junie!)December 17, 9:46 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 5Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Juniper Woods.Athena:\nTh-The defense is ready, Your Honor.Payne:\nThe prosecution is also ready, Your Honor. Uh-huh... And what is the meaning of this? I was under the impression that Mr. Red Monkey would be my opponent today.Judge:\nYes, well, a substitution of attorney petition was submitted just a few moments ago. Due to the explosion in the courthouse yesterday, Mr. Justice is unable to continue.Payne:\nI see, I see. Not at all surprised he used that as an excuse to run away. With me as an adversary, who wouldn't want to feign illness in order to escape?Athena:\n(What?! The nerve of that guy! I'm going to give him a piece of my mind! W-Well, I would if I wasn't so nervous... Argh! This arrogant jerk!)Widget:\nYou arrogant jerk!Athena:\nN-No! Widget!Payne:\nIs my hearing getting worse? I could've sworn I heard the defense say something just now.Athena:\nN-N-No! You didn't hear anything at all! Especially not from me!Judge:\nHmm... How odd. I could have sworn I also heard something...Athena:\n...Oh, that would be my indispensable partner, Widget. He... sometimes blurts out what I'm thinking.Payne:\nHeh heh. Well then. If that's the case, then it's a clear contradiction to what you just stated!Athena:\n(A contradiction?)Payne:\nYou just stated that you said nothing. However, if that device of yours says what you're thinking... ...then you indeed said I was...what was it? \"Elegance at work\"?Athena:\nEeep! (Actually, it was \"arrogant jerk\"...)Payne:\nAt any rate, what does it matter if it's a red monkey or a yellow monkey facing me? No fresh-out-of-law-school ROOKIE can defend this witness.Judge:\nMr. Payne, I believe that's enough. Let us get back to the case.Payne:\nOf course, Your Honor. I'm more than ready to show this little girl why they call me the \"Rookie Humiliator.\"Athena:\n(I knew it. He really is an arrogant jerk.)Widget:\nArrogant jerk!Judge:\nMs. Cykes. If you continue to insult the prosecution, I will remove you from this court.Athena:\nAck. I'm very sorry... (It was just a knee-jerk reaction...)Judge:\nNow then... Mr. Payne. Your opening statement, if you please.Payne:\nThank you, Your Honor.Payne:\nNow then. The incident occurred yesterday here at this very courthouse, in Courtroom No. 4. At that time, the trial for a certain bombing was being held in Courtroom No. 4.Judge:\nAh, yes. I was presiding over that trial as well. And Mr. Justice was there as the lawyer for the defense.Payne:\nA bomb that was being presented as evidence suddenly went off during the trial. It was a terrible incident... and Courtroom No. 4 was completely destroyed. Fortunately, we were able to start evacuation procedures before the explosion occurred. Just a few seconds more and it would've turned into a horrific loss of human life.Judge:\nBut there was, in fact, one death, was there not?Payne:\nThat is correct, Your Honor. When Courtroom No. 4 was examined after the blast... ...the body of Detective Candice Arme was discovered. She was to take the stand as a witness later in the trial.Judge:\nI suppose she wasn't able to evacuate in time. What a terrible tragedy. I must admit, I stumbled at least ten times myself before I was able to escape.Athena:\n(Maybe the court should see to getting you even shorter robes...)Payne:\nThe victim's body was found near the entrance to the courtroom. I suspect she stayed until the very end to help guide the others out safely. Your Honor, allow me to submit as evidence the victim's autopsy report... ...and details about the bomb.Arme's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Stuffed Animal Bomb added to the Court Record.Athena:\n(Okay, I know how this works. All evidence for the trial is filed in the Court Record. When I want to check something out, I just use [R / RB / E]. (Changed from [When I want to check something out, I just touch the Court Record Button (R).] in the original release) I'd better take a peek later.)Judge:\nNow, then. Please call the accused to the witness stand.Woods:\n............ *cough*Judge:\nDefendant, are you feeling all right? You're looking a bit pale...Woods:\nI'm so sorry! I was feeling a bit weak when I first arrived here at the courthouse... *cough* But I... I'm all right.Athena:\n(Junie's really giving it her all! I'd better make sure I do the same!)Payne:\nHeh heh. If we could please proceed. Your name and occupation, defendant.Woods:\n...Juniper Woods... I'm... a h-high school student.Payne:\nMs. Woods, can you confirm you were in the courthouse on the day in question?Woods:\nYes. I came to know Apollo Justice through my friend Thena... *cough* And so... I was there yesterday... to watch his trial and lend my support.Athena:\n(Something's wrong. Junie's really scared.)Payne:\nHeh heh heh. Did you know I'm also known as the \"Defendant Humiliator\"? It looks like I have yet another chance to show everyone how I earned that moniker!Athena:\n(Grr... Does his arrogance know no bounds?! I have to protect Junie no matter what!) Hey you arrogant je-- Er, Prosecutor Payne!Payne:\nHmm? What is it? Do you want me to demonstrate why I'm known as the \"Rookie Humiliator\" instead?Athena:\n(Deep breaths, Athena. Don't let him get to you.) P-Prosecutor Payne! Junie is telling the truth! Mr. Justice also backed up her claim when we saw him in the Defendant Lobby. And, Junie, he said that he was glad to get the lotus root you gave him, too.Woods:\nHe was? My grandma says lotus root is good for your eyes. She says they can even help you see into the future!Athena:\nThey can? Then that's the perfect present for a lawyer! (And if that's true, I guess he must not have eaten them...)Judge:\nHmm... A sweet, meek girl like this, blowing a courtroom to bits? I must say it's very hard to believe.Payne:Payne:\nNow, now, Your Honor. Don't let her seemingly innocent appearance fool you. The defendant had a motive for committing this crime.Woods:\nTh-That's not true...! I don't have any kind of motive...! A-And I-I didn't even know the lady who was killed...!Payne:\nI admit the investigation didn't turn up any connection between the victim and defendant. However, that doesn't matter. The only thing that does is that her objective was the destruction of Courtroom No. 4 itself.Athena:\nHey, what's that supposed to mean?! Why in the world would Ms. Woods want to do that?!Payne:\nMm-hmm. That's a very good question, coming from a novice such as yourself. But first, a question for the defendant. Have you ever been brought up on false charges?Woods:\nWhat?! Wh-Why, yes... Yes, I have...Payne:\nAnd did that experience cause you to harbor a grudge against the court system?Athena:Athena:\nNow, wait just one minute! If that kind of thing was a motive for blowing things up... ...then every one of our clients would turn into bombers!Judge:\nThat's a valid point. We wouldn't have a single courthouse left standing in the land.Payne:\nI concede the accused isn't the only one who might bear resentment against the courts. But Ms. Woods is the only person who could have committed this crime. Why? Because we have some decisive evidence that proves the defendant's guilt.Athena:\n(Decisive, huh? I'll believe it when I see it!)Payne:\nIt involves a very unique aspect of the bomb itself, Your Honor.Judge:\nAnd what exactly was so unique about it?Payne:\nHmm... Why don't we have Ms. Cykes answer that question?Athena:\nHuh? M-Me?Payne:\nMm-hmm. I notice that you appear to be very nervous. And, well, gentleman that I am... ...I'd like to offer you the chance to gain some confidence with such an easy question.Athena:\n(Could he BE any more condescending?! Really! What a thoroughly unpleasant man!)Widget:\n\"L\" is for \"Loser\"!Payne:\nHarrumph! What did it just say?!Athena:\nN-Nothing. Not a single thing... (Now, let's see... What was I supposed to do at a time like this...? Oh, I know! The Court Record! The information I need is somewhere in the Court Record!)Judge:\nAll right, Ms. Cykes. Let's hear your answer. What was unique about the bomb that blew up the courtroom? Was it because it was...In Apollo's briefcase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\nLet's see... I believe it was because it was... ...in Mr. Justice's briefcase?\nJudge:\nDon't tell me you intend to claim that it was Mr. Justice who committed the bombing?!\nAthena:\nWhat? No! Of course not! I just thought maybe... he brought it to the courtroom by mistake...?\nJudge:\nWhat kind of person makes a mistake like that?!\nAthena:\n(Ugh... What in the world am I blathering on about?)\nJudge:\nAll right. Let's try that again, shall we?\nLeads back to:\n\"What was unique about the bomb that blew up the courtroom? Was it because it was...\"In the Judge's pocket\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\nThe bomb was... In Your Honor's pocket!\nJudge:\nM-Ms Cykes! What in Sam Hill are you talking about?!\nAthena:\nWell, I tried to picture myself as the bomb... If I was in your pocket, you'd surely bring me into the courtroom, naturally.\nJudge:\nThe only things in my pocket are pictures of my grandchild! I would hardly have a bomb in there!\nAthena:\nAh ha ha... No of course not... That would be silly, now, wouldn't it? (I think I'd better take another good look through the Court Record.)\nJudge:\nAll right. Let's try that again, shall we?\nLeads back to:\n\"What was unique about the bomb that blew up the courtroom? Was it because it was...\"Inside a stuffed animal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Payne! What kind of simpleton do you take me for?!\"Athena:\nMr. Payne! What kind of simpleton do you take me for?! It was stuffed inside a stuffed animal! Its evil intentions covered up by a cute exterior!Payne:\nHeh heh. Very good. Have a cookie. The bomb that went off in the courtroom was indeed hidden inside a stuffed animal.Athena:\n(There, how do you like that? Not bad, huh? I AM fine, just like I said from the start! I can do this!)Judge:\nYes, as I recall, the bomb was stuffed inside a stuffed animal the whole time. I never even got to take a look at it. But what connection does this impish elephant have with the defendant?Payne:\nThe answer to that question lies in another piece of evidence, which I have here.Judge:\nAnd what, pray tell, is this? It appears to be a little singed.Payne:\nIt's a tail, Your Honor. The tail of a poor victim of the explosion.Judge:\nThis is incredible! Are you saying it's Detective Arme's tail?!Payne:\nYour Honor is so very close, but no. It belongs to this stuffed animal. It's called the Phony Phanty. A rather unpleasant name, if you ask me.Judge:\nHe's the mascot for a campaign to eliminate false evidence and false charges, is he not?Payne:\nExactly. His motto is \"Phony Evidence is just Trunked Up!\"Athena:\n(That's so wrong on so many levels.)Payne:\nThe Phony Phanty's tail is made of vinyl cloth. And we found something very interesting on its surface... the defendant's fingerprints.Athena:\n(WH-WHAAAAAT?!)Payne:\nThe Phony Phanty provided the prosecution with all the evidence we needed. It clearly proves that the accused handled the bomb!Woods:\nI... Uhhh... Eep!Athena:\n(But that doesn't make any sense! Why would Junie's fingerprints be on it?!)Judge:\nHmm... That does appear to be pretty irrefutable evidence... The court accepts it into evidence.Phony Phanty Tail added to the Court Record.Judge:\nMs. Woods, do you have an explanation for this?Woods:\n...I... I don't understand... I... *cough, cough*Payne:\nHow about you, Ms. Cykes? Do you have any plausible explanation to refute this decisive piece of evidence?Athena:\nW-Well, I... uh... (I-I can't do it! I can't think of a single thing! But I'd better come up with something... for Junie's sake!)Payne:\nIf you can't produce an answer, we could always go straight to the ruling, if you prefer.Athena:\n(Ack, no! I have to say something -- fast! Oh, no! I can't get my voice to work! Why now, of all times...?!)(I thought I overcame this already... Maybe I'm still not ready to stand in court?)Anime cutscene\nPayne:\nAs you can see, there is no room for debate.Phoenix:\nObjection!Judge:\nWhy, it's you...!Phoenix:\nSorry it took me so long to get here, Athena. Apollo explained the whole thing to me over the phone. He asked me to come help you out in his place.Athena:\n...Thanks for coming. I hate to admit it, but I was having a real rough time on my own.Phoenix:\nOh, I don't know. I think you were doing just fine, all things considered. And you hung in there, giving me enough time to get here. Now, let's turn things around!Athena:\nYou got it, Boss!Judge:\nHo ho ho. Look who showed up out of the blue. If it isn't Mr. Phoenix Wright. You always manage to surprise me.Phoenix:\nYour Honor! Mr. Payne has called for an early ruling... ...but I believe there are still many things that need to be deliberated. How did Ms. Woods's fingerprints wind up on the stuffed animal tail? How was the bomb even detonated? Until these questions are answered, I assert it's impossible for a fair ruling to be made!Judge:\nHmm... You are absolutely right. Let us continue from where we left off. I assume you have no objections, Mr. Payne?Payne:\nHeh heh. None at all, Your Honor.Woods:\n*cough, cough*............ ......*cough, cough* *cough*Phoenix:\n(Ms. Woods really looks like she's having a hard time.)Athena:\nJunie's really struggling, Mr. Wright. I get the sense she's afraid of the courtroom itself.Phoenix:\nBecause of yesterday?Athena:\nYeah. It was understandably very traumatic for her.Phoenix:\nPoor thing. And here she is, back at the courthouse again, being so brave. I'd like to make a request, Your Honor. If at all possible, I'd like to have Ms. Woods rest in the lobby.Judge:\nHmm... Given the defendant's condition... Very well, I grant special permission.Athena:\nYou go get some rest, Junie, and leave the rest to us!Woods:\nOkay... Thank you. Sorry about this... *cough, cough*Payne:\nPhoenix Wright... I've been looking forward to meeting you.Phoenix:\n...It's been a while, Mr. Payne.Payne:\nHeh heh. You're more clueless than I'd heard. I do believe you mean, \"How do you do?\" For I... am Gaspen Payne! I am the younger brother of your longstanding rival, Winston Payne!Phoenix:\nWHAAAT?! (\"Longstanding rival\"...? When were we ever rivals, let alone \"longstanding\"...?)Payne:\nYou'll see, Mr. Wright. I will cleanse Winston of the disgrace he met with at your hands!Phoenix:\n(*sigh* Looks like this royal Payne is going to be as thoroughly unpleasant as the other.)Payne:\nHeh heh heh. Your Honor! The prosecution would now like to call a decisive witness to the stand. This witness will testify as to how the accused detonated the bomb in the courtroom.Judge:\nVery well. Please call your witness, Mr. Payne!???:\n............Payne:\nWitness, your name and occupation, please.Judge:\nW-Witness?Tonate:\nNAME: TED TONATEOCCUPATION: BOMB DISPOSAL SPECIALISTJudge:\nOh, my! What a strange, robotic voice you have!Tonate:\nSPEECH SYNTHESIS VIA TYPING. IT IS THE SAME AS ME TALKING.Athena:\nHe sounds exactly like a robot...Judge:\nCan't you speak in a normal manner?!Tonate:\nI can.Phoenix:\n(He can!)Tonate:\nBUT I DO NOT LIKE TO SPEAK. SPEAKING IS INEFFICIENT. ENERGY EXPENDITURE: SPEAKING > TYPING UNDERSTAND?Judge:\nHmm.. What an odd witness.Payne:\nMr. Tonate was in charge of the bomb for that trial and was there when it went off.Judge:\nBeing a bomb squad specialist, do you have any relation to the victim? (Changed from [Being a bomb squad specialist, do you have any relation to the defendant?] in the original release)Tonate:\nNEGATIVE. I FIRST MET THE GIRL WHILE ON THIS JOB. MANY PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED BY THE POLICE. I KNOW ONLY A FRACTION OF THEM. HOWEVER, I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I FIRST DISCOVERED THE BODY OF THE VICTIM.Judge:\nShocked?Tonate:\nI WAS THE FIRST ONE ON THE SCENE AFTER THE EXPLOSION. I WENT THERE TO ENSURE SAFETY, BUT I ENDED UP DISCOVERING A DEAD BODY.Phoenix:\n(Hmm... So he was the first to discover the body, was he?)Payne:\nHe is here to testify about the circumstances surrounding the moment of the explosion.Judge:\nVery well. The court will hear Mr. Tonate's testimony. But at the very least, show this court some respect and remove that faceguard, witness!Witness Testimony-- When the Bomb Went Off --Tonate:\nTHE BOMB WAS ORIGINALLY DISARMED BY ME, THEN TRANSPORTED HERE AS EVIDENCE.\nBOMB NAME: HH-3000 OPERATED BY TIMER OR WITH A REMOTE\nI WAS WATCHING FROM THE GALLERY WHEN I SUDDENLY BECAME ALARMED.\nI SAW THAT THE BOMB'S TIMER WAS COUNTING DOWN.Phoenix:\nSo even though the bomb was supposed to be disarmed, it somehow got switched on?Tonate:\nPRECISELY. ACTIVATING THE TIMER IS VERY SIMPLE. 1. CONNECT WIRES 2. SWITCH ON TIMER A MONKEY COULD DO IT. I AM SURE EVEN YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO, MR. WRIGHT.Athena:\nUh, I guess this makes you the Blue Monkey in this barrel of fun, Boss...Phoenix:\n*ahem* I'd now like to begin my cross-examination-- Huh?Judge:\nMr. Tonate...! What is that?Tonate:\nHH-3000... AKA: A BOMB.Phoenix:\n(A B-BOMB?!)Judge:\nGreat googly moogly!Payne:\nYeeeaaaargh!Judge:\nMr. Tonate! I-I demand that you disarm it this instant!Tonate:\nDisassembly complete. HMPH. 5.3 SECONDS. 0.2 SECONDS SHORT OF MY PERSONAL BEST.Judge:\nAre you trying to give me a heart attack?! I'm not exactly a spring chicken, you know!Tonate:\nTHIS IS AN EXACT REPLICA OF THE HH-3000. IT IS USED TO PRACTICE DISARMING BOMBS. DISARM = SUCCESS. EXPLOSION = FAILURE.Judge:\nAn exact replica of the bomb that exploded, is it? So that's what it looked like.Tonate:\nI SUBMITTED A PHOTOGRAPH OF THE REAL BOMB TAKEN JUST BEFORE THE TRIAL. DIMENSIONS: 10\" H x 10\" W x 10\" D WEIGHT: 12 LBS... A PERFECT REPLICATION.Judge:\nYour bomb does appear to be a very good copy, indeed.Tonate:\nYES, HOWEVER I COULD NOT REPLICATE THE DETONATION MECHANISM. IT HAS A VERY PUZZLING WIRING SETUP. IT IS REGRETTABLE I COULD NOT REPLICATE IT.Judge:\nWitness, that's enough! There's no need to replicate anything here!HH-3000 Bomb updated in the Court Record.Judge:\nAnd now if the defense would begin their cross-examination-- Hm? Where has Ms. Cykes gone to?Athena:\n............Phoenix:\nAthena, you can come out now.Athena:\nOkay, Mr. Wright! Let's get to work!Phoenix:\nI guess you were pretty scared, huh?Athena:\nWh-What?! I don't know what you're talking about!Widget:\nShe was about to bolt!Athena:\nHey, put a sock in it, Widget!Phoenix:\n(*sigh* As transparent as ever...)Athena:\nNow, let's see... Where were we...?Phoenix:\nWe were at the \"cross-examination\"!Athena:\nOh! Cross-examination! Of course!Phoenix:\n(She seems disoriented. I wonder if she's all right... Maybe I should ask Athena if she remembers how to cross-examine... to help her focus.)I'd better ask\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, Athena, you remember how to conduct a cross-examination, right?\nAthena:\nWhat?! Of course I do! What kind of lawyer would I be if I didn't?!\nPhoenix:\nNow, now! Don't get upset! But what do you say to humoring me with a little review...?\nAthena:\nYou got it! Basically, we examine a witness's testimony... ...and compare it against the Court Record, searching carefully for any inconsistencies. This green text represents a witness's testimony. We can use [left analog stick right / D] to advance to the next statement of their testimony.

(Changed from [Touch the left arrow to go back to the previous statement.] in the original release) Paying close attention to the testimony, we should keep an ear out for anything strange... (Changed from [Pay close attention to the testimony, and when you've found an inconsistency...] in the original release) ...and be prepared to \"Present\" ([R / RB / E]) our case via the Court Record! (Changed from [...touch 'Present' (R) to open the Court Record!] in the original release) The Court Record contains information on all the evidence we have at our disposal. We can use it to look for facts that conflict with what the witness has said...

(Changed from [When you find something, 'Present' (X) that evidence to refute the witness's statement!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nAnd what if nothing conflicts with the witness's testimony?\nAthena:\nWell, that's when we \"Press\" ([L / LB / Q]) the witness for more information. (Changed from [Well, that's when you 'Press' (L) the witness for more information.] in the original release) Find any inconsistencies or lies in the testimony and reveal them to the court. That's what cross-examination is all about!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like you remember it just as I taught it. (And it was a nice refresher course for me!)\nLeads to:\n\"If you can't find any contradictions...\"Nah, she'll be fine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Nah, no need for that right now. She'll be fine.)\nAthena:\nI'll do everything I can to help!\nLeads to:\n\"If you can't find any contradictions...\"Athena:\nIf you can't find any contradictions... ...and you flub up too often, don't be afraid to ask me for help! Press [X / Y / R] when the option to Consult appears. (Changed from [Press X to consult with me when the Consult panel appears.] in the original release) I'll let you know where I think the suspicious statement is!Phoenix:\nSounds good.

I CAN DISARM ANYTHING. IN A FLASH!\nPhoenix:\nUh, that looks more like \"dismantle\" than \"disarm\" to me...\nTonate:\nOh. Pardon me.\nPhoenix:\nLet's see. Is there any chance you could have forgotten to disarm the bomb?\nTonate:\nIMPOSSIBLE! I DO NOT MAKE RUDIMENTARY MISTAKES LIKE THAT.\nPhoenix:\nThey say \"to err is human.\" (Although the jury is still out on this guy...)\nPayne:\nHeh heh heh. If you must know, Mr. Wright, according to the court's own records... ...the fact that the bomb had indeed been disarmed was officially confirmed.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...

That certainly sounds like one thick and very heavy bit of metal.\nAthena:\nI bet if I dropped that thing on your foot, you'd be hoppin'!\nPhoenix:\nIf you dropped that thing anywhere, I'd be \"hopping\" for the nearest exit!\nJudge:\nVery well. I believe the court has heard enough about the bomb itself. So, Mr. Tonate, you were keeping an eye on the bomb? Where were you watching from?Tonate:\nI WAS WATCHING FROM THE GALLERY WHEN I SUDDENLY BECAME ALARMED.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you in the gallery?\nTonate:\nMY DUTIES MAY HAVE BEEN OVER FOR THE MOMENT, BUT I WANTED TO KEEP WATCH. EVEN THOUGH THE BOMB WAS DISARMED, YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO CAREFUL. EXPLOSIVE DEVICES ARE VERY DANGEROUS THINGS.\nJudge:\nAh, how admirably responsible of you. A model to be emulated.\nTonate:\nI PRACTICE DISARMING BOMBS EVERY DAY. I practice assembling them, too...\nPhoenix:\n(The disarming part, I get, but assembling them...?)\nAthena:\nWell, I'll have you know that I practice presenting evidence every day myself!\nTonate:\nI SEE. BUT DO YOU EVER PRACTICE HAVING EVIDENCE PRESENTED TO YOU?\nAthena:\nP-Presented to me? What...? No, I...\nTonate:\nTHEN YOU CANNOT VERY WELL CALL YOURSELF A PROFESSIONAL YET, CAN YOU?\nAthena:\nGrr! That does it! I'm gonna start practicing having evidence presented to me every day! And you'd better drink some coffee, Boss!

I'd hardly think a timer as small as the one on this bomb could be seen from the gallery.\nTonate:\nTHESE GOGGLES HELP ME SEE VERY SMALL THINGS CLEARLY FROM VERY FAR AWAY. I CAN EVEN SEE WHAT YOU HAD FOR BREAKFAST BY LOOKING AT YOUR TIE.\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I suddenly feel like a bug under a magnifying glass?)\nAthena:\nHmm...

I CONSTANTLY UNDERGO TRAINING SO THAT I WILL NEVER MISS IT.Phoenix:\nI hardly think \"training\" would help you hear something so soft from so far away...

Being suspicious is not an attractive quality you know.Phoenix:\n(And you're just overflowing with attractive qualities, are you...?)Payne:\nOr perhaps you have some proof that Mr. Tonate did not hear the sound?Phoenix:\nWell... no, but... (...it still seems totally suspect... But it's going to be really hard to prove that he DIDN'T hear something...)Judge:\nIf I have this correct, the prosecution's argument is that... ...someone reactivated the bomb before it was brought into the courtroom. What I don't understand, Mr. Payne, is why you believe that person to be Ms. Woods.Payne:\nThat's simple, Your Honor: Mr. Tonate happened to be there when it happened. He was there when the defendant rearmed the bomb.Judge:\nWhat's this, now?!Tonate:\nIT HAPPENED BEFORE THE TRIAL STARTED. IT WAS WHEN DETECTIVE ARME AND I WERE TRANSPORTING THE BOMB. WE BROUGHT THE BOMB TO THE LOBBY FOR THE DEFENSE. BOMB = EVIDENCE. THE LAWYER WANTED TO SEE IT BEFORE THE START OF THE TRIAL.Payne:\nLooking for a chance to get at the bomb, Ms. Woods was already there in that lobby. Her goal was surely to rearm the bomb and steal the remote switch.Phoenix:\nThe remote switch?Tonate:\nYES. THE SWITCH THAT CONTROLS THE BOMB REMOTELY. DUH. IT HAS BEEN MISSING EVER SINCE THE INCIDENT.Missing Remote Switch added to the Court Record.Tonate:\nI AM PARTIALLY TO BLAME. I LEFT THE BOMB AND REMOTE ON TOP OF THE TRANSPORT CASE... ...AND THEY WERE REARMED AND STOLEN WHILE I WAS TALKING WITH THE LAWYER.Payne:\nThe defendant then used the remote from inside the courtroom to start the timer.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nHow can you assert so unequivocally that the bomb was rearmed in the lobby?!Payne:Payne:\nThe bomb was safely secured in the transport case. The only time it was outside of the case was in that lobby. Therefore, that was the one and only opportunity anyone had to meddle with it.Phoenix:\nSomeone other than Mr. Tonate could have opened the case and taken the bomb out.Tonate:\nIMPOSSIBLE. THE TRANSPORT CASE IS ASSIGNED EXCLUSIVELY TO ME. DO YOU SEE THIS NUMBER HERE? THAT IS MY IDENTIFICATION NUMBER. AND I HAVE THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN OPEN THE CASE.Bomb Transport Case added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nNevertheless! Mr. Payne's assertion is nothing more than conjecture! You have no proof that it was Ms. Woods who stole the remote switch!Payne:\nAnd by the same token, you have no proof that it wasn't her. But what I DO have is a piece of evidence that proves the defendant handled the bomb.Phoenix:\nAH! That TAIL!Tonate:\nFIVE MINUTES, TWENTY-FOUR SECONDS, TWO POINT THREE DECISECONDS. THE DEFENSE'S ADVANTAGE LASTED A MERE FIVE MINUTES.Phoenix:\n(Urk. Talk about a rotten hand... As long as they have her fingerprints as their trump card, I'm at a big disadvantage.)Judge:\nHmm... It appears we will have to hear from the defendant herself once more.Payne:\nI wholeheartedly agree, Your Honor. I would like to recall Ms. Woods to the stand.Judge:\nI trust you have no objections, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(I'm worried about her condition, but we DO need her testimony. On the other hand... ...I'm not sure I want to make Athena mad...)Athena:\n...I can read your feelings you know, Boss.Phoenix:\n! (Guess there's no hiding from her, huh...)Athena:\nDon't worry. I know we need her testimony. But if anybody picks on her again, they'll pay.Phoenix:\n(Guess she's already at Anger Level 1...)Athena:\nDon't worry. I'll stop the proceedings before I let anything bad happen to her.Phoenix:\nThe defense has no objections, Your Honor.Tonate:\nIN THAT CASE, I WILL TAKE MY LEAVE. BUT BEFORE I DO, THERE IS JUST ONE MORE THING. MR. WRIGHT... IS IT?Phoenix:\nMe? Yes?Tonate:\nDISMANTLING BOMBS IS MY JOB. DISMANTLING THE CASE IS YOURS. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT? I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU TRY.Phoenix:\n(Grrr! This guy is hiding something! I just know it!)Tonate:\nNOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME...Judge:\nBailiff! Please go out to the lobby and bring back the defendant!Woods:\n............Athena:\nJunie!Woods:\n...Hi, Thena.Phoenix:\n(She looks even worse off than before...)Athena:\nDon't worry, Junie! We're here for you!Woods:\nThanks, Thena. And I'll do my best, too...Payne:\nYou blew up the courtroom because you bear resentment against the courts, correct?Woods:\nN-No! Of course not!... *cough* I...Payne:\nWhat's that you say? I can barely hear you.Woods:\nI... I... haven't done anything wrong... This prosecutor's scary...Payne:Payne:\nWhat an impudent little girl. Stop acting innocent and tell the truth!Phoenix:\n(This is getting ugly...)Payne:\nYou rearmed the bomb because you wanted to blow up the courthouse! Admit it! That's why you went to the lobby where Mr. Justice was, isn't that right?!Woods:\nUuugghhh... Ahh!Athena:\nMr. Wright... Can I go give that prosecutor a smack?!Phoenix:\nWh-What?! Of course not! Do we have to review Courtroom Manners 101 again?!Athena:\nWe can't let a creep that bullies innocent girls like this off so easily!Phoenix:\nI haven't forgotten about how he treated you.Athena:\nDon't worry about me, just help Junie! Her heart's crying out! She's so scared... so very scared!Phoenix:\n(Looks like Athena's picking something up with her heightened sense of hearing... And it sounds like this time it's the voice of Ms. Woods's heart.)Payne:\nDon't deny it! You stole the remote switch and used it in the courtroom, didn't you?!Athena:Athena:\nYour Honor, please put a stop to this! Mr. Payne is badgering the defendant!Judge:\nYes, Ms. Woods does seem quite frightened. Mr. Payne, I ask that you behave more like a gentleman.Payne:\nAh, but don't you know, Your Honor? There is no more a gentle man in this world than I.Athena:\nUgh, as if a gentleman, or even a \"gentle man\", would behave like he does! Don't let that rude ruffian win!Woods:\nTheeena...! *sniffle*Payne:\nHow dare you call a gentleman such as I a \"rude ruffian\"?! I'll have you know I attend a manners class every Saturday. I'm more than just a mere gentleman -- I'm a GENTEEL-man!Athena:\nNot when you're terrorizing a young lady you're not! I'd demand my money back from that manners class if I were you!Payne:\nUrk...Phoenix:\n(I should probably be the adult here and stop the two of them, but...)Judge:\nMr. Payne, that will be enough.Payne:\nCertainly, Your Honor. No further questions. Let's move on to the defendant's testimony. Ms. Woods, please share with the court what you were doing when the bomb went off.Woods:\n............Witness Testimony-- When the Bomb Went Off --Woods:\nWell, that day... *cough* I was watching from the gallery... *cough, cough*\nThe bomb went off... *cough*\n*cough* And rubble started falling... It fell on top of me... *cough, cough*Athena:\nJunie's clearly in pain, being forced to recall the bombing like this... She can't even get her words out!Phoenix:\n(This isn't going to work, so what now...? Hey, wait a minute! Even if she can't vocalize what she wants to say, we can listen to what's inside her heart! Yes, now's the perfect time to use Athena's power!) You can hear it, can't you, Athena? The cries of Ms. Woods's heart?Athena:\nYes, and they sound incredibly strained. She's so scared... I think she could collapse at any second!Phoenix:\n(Athena has a unique ability, you see. With her finely-tuned sense of hearing, she can hear the words of a witness's heart. In essence, she can sense how a person is really feeling from the tone of their voice. Guess it's all up to Athena and her special ability now!) Athena, I want you to use the analytical psychology you studied... ...and listen to the testimony of Ms. Woods's heart.Athena:\n...Okay, Boss! I'll give it a go! After all, this is the whole reason I put all that effort into studying analytical psychology! Auf geht's! Let's do this!Phoenix:\nSo your holographic thingamabob can show us how Ms. Woods is feeling, right?Athena:\nIn a nutshell, yes. The emotions and images that I picked up on just now while listening to her testimony... ...I can enter all of that into Widget and use the Mood Matrix to analyze them. There mood markers here reflect fluctuations in Junie's emotions. When she feels happy or is enjoying the memory, the \"Happy\" marker will light up. When she feels angry or frustrated, the \"Angry\" marker will react. When she feels sadness or is frightened by a memory, the \"Sad\" marker will blink. And when she feels surprised or confused, the \"Surprised\" marker will let us know.Phoenix:\nSo, with your special ability and Widget's Mood Matrix program... ...we can track how Ms. Woods is feeling as she testifies. Talk about the wonders of technology...Athena:\nYup! Now, let's give it a shot! I'm picking up on some kind of discord -- or noise -- in Junie's heart.NOISE LEVEL100%Athena:\nSee here? This is what the noise looks like in the Mood Matrix. It's a result of inconsistencies between her testimony and her feelings. If we can pinpoint their inconsistencies, the noise level should drop!Phoenix:\n(Okay! It's time to listen to Ms. Woods's true testimony!)Woods:\nWell, that day... *cough*Woods:\nI was watching from the gallery... *cough, cough*Woods:\nThe bomb went off... *cough*Woods:\n*cough* and rubble started falling...Woods:\nIt fell on top of me... *cough, cough*Athena:\nI think I have a good grasp on Junie's emotional state now.Phoenix:\n(This power of Athena's is incredible...)Athena:\nAnd I'm seeing an unexpected emotion that's inconsistent with the content of her testimony!Phoenix:\nWhat?! Already?!Athena:\nLook at this! When she says, \"It fell on top of me,\" the \"Happy\" marker is reacting!Phoenix:\nWell, look at that. That IS odd!Athena:\nThere must be a reason for this contradictory emotion! We just need to do some digging! When you find an unexpected emotion... ...you'll first need to \"Pinpoint\" ([L / LB / Q]) it... (Changed from [...touch \"Pinpoint\" (L)...] in the original release) ...and then select the unexpected emotion or reaction from the four mood markers with [A / Space]. (Chagned from [...and then select the unexpected emotion or reaction from the four mood markers.] in the original release)Woods:\nIt fell on top of me... *cough, cough*Pinpoint Happy marker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Widget is registering joy when Ms. Woods recalls the rubble falling on her.\"Phoenix:\n(Widget is registering joy when Ms. Woods recalls the rubble falling on her. There must be a reason for this unexpected emotion!) Ms. Woods! As the rubble was falling, was there also something that made you feel happy?Woods:\nWhat?! *cough*Athena:\nMr. Wright! The feeling of happiness is spreading throughout Junie's heart! Keep going on this point, and I bet Junie will start to calm down.Phoenix:\n(Great! Let's hear what she has to say!)Woods:\nUm... *cough* Just as I was about to escape the courtroom... the bomb went off. I was so startled... I tripped. And then rubble started falling on top of me...! I really thought I was done for... But just then... Apollo came and rescued me!Athena:\nApollo?Woods:\nHe used his own body to shield me from the rubble...Phoenix:\n(So that's when he sustained those injuries...)Athena:\nHow do you feel, Junie? Did talking about Apollo give you some courage?Woods:\nYes. Apollo is... just like the sun -- strong and bright and warm. Just talking about him makes me feel like a leaf undergoing photosynthesis.Athena:\nAnd see? Your coughing stopped all of a sudden.Woods:\nOh! You're right! Thank you, Thena.NOISE LEVEL50%Phoenix:\nLooks like we were able to draw out some new testimony.Athena:\nHee hee. Pretty neat, huh? But there's still some noise left, meaning there must still be some discord in Junie's heart.Phoenix:\nHmm... I guess we'll have to keep going, then.Athena:\nLet me input this new information and update the Mood Matrix, and we'll be good to go! You remember what to do, right?Phoenix:\nWhen I find an unexpected emotion, I should first \"Pinpoint\" ([L / LB / Q]) it...? (Changed from [When I find an unexpected emotion, I should touch \"Pinpoint\" (L)...?] in the original release)Athena:\nThat's right! And then you select it from the mood markers with [A / Space]. (Changed from [That's right! And then you select the unexpected emotion from the mood markers.] in the original release) If we can find the reason for the discord in her heart... ...then we should be able to draw even more new testimony out!Woods:\nI tried to run, but I was too slow.Woods:\nBefore I could get away, the bomb went off.Woods:\nI was so startled I tripped! Then rubble started falling on me.Woods:\nI thought I was done for...Woods:\nBut then Apollo came and rescued me!Pinpoint Sad marker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You were happy when Mr. Justice rescued you, weren't you?\"Athena:\nI can see some discord in Junie's heart when I listen to her voice. There must be an unexpected emotion here somewhere! When you find an unexpected emotion... ...you'll first need to \"Pinpoint\" ([L / LB / Q]) it... (Changed from [...touch \"Pinpoint\" (L)...] in the original release) ...and then select the unexpected emotion from the four mood markers with [A / Space]. (Changed from [...and then select the unexpected emotion or reaction from the four mood markers.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nYou were happy when Mr. Justice rescued you, weren't you?Woods:\nYes... I was really happy.Phoenix:\nBut was there also something you felt sad about at the same time?Woods:\nSad?Phoenix:\nThe reason I ask is... ...when you were describing how you were rescued, we sensed a little sadness, too.Woods:\n......Oh! I think it's probably because of Bum Rap Rhiny.Phoenix:\nBum Rap Rhiny? (Well, what do you know? Something new!)Woods:\nThat's right. I... I brought my stuffed animal, Bum Rap Rhiny, to watch the trial with me. Bum Rap Rhiny and Phony Phanty are brothers.Phoenix:\n(Who knew that the legal world could inspire a whole line of merchandise...?)Woods:\nI had Bum Rap Rhiny with me while I was watching the trial... But it wasn't until Apollo saved me that I realized I'd lost him as I was running away... My poor Rhiny! A victim of that terrible bomb! Oh, I know! You can see what he looks like in this poster! It's for the campaign to eradicate fake evidence and false charges.Phoenix:\n(Phony Phanty and Bum Rap Rhiny, huh... Nothing against the campaign, but why an elephant and a rhinoceros...?)Athena:\nMr. Wright! I don't sense any discord in Junie's heart anymore!NOISE LEVEL0%Phoenix:\nSo I guess that means we managed to draw out all of her testimony.Athena:\nThat's right! I'll just make an update with the new info and we'll have the whole picture! So do you think her new testimony will help?Phoenix:\nAbsolutely. I don't know what I would've done without you, Athena! (So Bum Rap Rhiny was in that courtroom when the bomb went off. Now that we know that, it changes the meaning of that other piece of evidence! All I have to do is \"Present\" it... at the right statement!)Woods:\nI was watching from the gallery with Bum Rap Rhiny. I tried to run, but I was too slow.Present Phony Phanty Tail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Woods, I know this trial has been very hard for you.\"Woods:\nBefore I could get out of the courtroom, the bomb went off.Woods:\nI was so startled I tripped! Then rubble started falling. I thought I was done for...Woods:\nBut then Apollo came and rescued me!Athena:\nThat's Junie's complete testimony. Not bad, huh, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(I should focus on the new statements Ms. Woods made... The existence of Bum Rap Rhiny should turn things around in our favor! It changes the meaning of a certain piece of evidence we already have. All I have to do is present it... at the right statement!)Phoenix:\nMs. Woods, I know this trial has been very hard for you. But you can relax now. You are, without a doubt, innocent.Judge:\nMr. Wright! What wild assertion are you making now?!Phoenix:\nMy \"wild assertion\" is simply this: the two stuffed animals were mixed up. The tail the defendant's fingerprints were found on wasn't that of Phony Phanty. It was the tail of her gallery companion, Bum Rap Rhiny!Payne:Payne:\nWhat?! What nonsense is that?! I concede they're both stuffed animals, yes, but they're completely different characters! An elephant and a rhino. They're as distinct as a defense lawyer and a prosecutor!Phoenix:\nBut are they really so different? Both defense lawyers and prosecutors strive to protect the peace through law.Athena:\nEven elephants and rhinos have some similar characteristics. They're both gray, for example!Phoenix:\nAnyway, this poster is all I need to prove my assertion to be true. If I may direct the court's attention here, you'll clearly see how the two got mixed up!Present Bum Rap Rhiny's tail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well! Would you look at that! The two tails are exactly the same!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWhat are should I be looking at, exactly? Furthermore, you said \"clearly\", but it's all looking pretty \"murky\" to me.\nPhoenix:\nI-It's this area, Your Honor! Right here! If you look closely, you should see how the two animals got confused with one another...\nJudge:\nOh... Now that you mention it... I think I might see a possible similarity...\nPayne:\nHeh heh heh. Your Honor. Please don't get taken in by this fellow's bluffing.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Are you trying to trick me?! I wasn't born yesterday, you know!\nAthena:\nUm, I'm pretty sure everybody can clearly see that...\nJudge:\nThen you should be able to clearly see that I'm about to give your boss a penalty.\nPhoenix:\nUrngh! (Think, Phoenix! Which part of the stuffed animal was found at the scene? Once I know that, it should be easy to show how the two stuffed animals got mixed up.)\nLeads back to:\n\"If I may direct the court's attention here, you'll clearly see how the two got mixed up!\"Judge:\nWell! Would you look at that! The two tails are exactly the same!Phoenix:\nYes, exactly. The two stuffed animals are based on entirely different animals... ...but the design of their tails is exactly the same!Payne:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! As long as the possibility exists that the tail belongs to Bum Rap Rhiny... ...we can no longer consider it to be decisive proof that the defendant handled the bomb. As things stand, I consider the charges against the accused unsubstantiated. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Payne?Payne:\nOh, um... Y-Yes, of course, Your Honor...Athena:\nOoh, that was great, Mr. Wright! You turned things right around!Phoenix:\nYeah. It's not over yet, but at least we managed to hold out this long.Judge:\nI believe this brings our proceedings for today to a close. Mr. Payne, I'm afraid you have some serious investigating ahead of you.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well, let us reconvene tomorrow. Court is adjourned!December 17, 11:56 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 5Athena:\nThat was so exciting, Boss! We did it! True to form, you managed to just barely pull it off at the very last moment!Phoenix:\n(\"True to form\"? Gee, I never knew you had such a glowing opinion of me...)Woods:\n...Thank you for everything you're doing.Phoenix:\nYou did great, Ms. Woods. You really stuck it out.Athena:\nAnd you got really brave at the end, just when we needed you most, Junie! Thanks to you, we were able to turn things around!Woods:\nWell, you were the one who gave me that courage, Thena.Athena:\nReally? Heh heh. Thanks. So, be honest -- was I any help at all?Phoenix:\nOf course! Without you, we would've never gotten out of that tight spot.Athena:\nThat's good to hear! I may still have a lot to learn, but you can bet I'm going to give it my all! I'll be so good that, one day, you'll call me your partner!Phoenix:\nThat's what I like to hear! (Analytical psychology... The ability to solve the riddles of a person's heart. Athena's true potential is beginning to really shine through now.)Athena:\nHey, where's Apollo, anyway?Phoenix:\nHmm... Good question... (I almost forgot about him.) I assumed he'd still be here in the lobby.Woods:\nOh, I know! Maybe he's still in Courtroom No. 4...Phoenix:\n(Courtroom No. 4? What would he be doing at the scene of the explosion?)Woods:\nWhen I came out to the lobby to rest, I told Apollo about Bum Rap Rhiny... I told him I dropped Rhiny in the courtroom as I was trying to escape before the blast. And then... ...Apollo said he had an idea where Rhiny might be, so we went to take a look together.Athena:\nHuh. I guess Apollo can be pretty nice when he wants to be.Phoenix:\nSo you went looking for Rhiny together before you were called back into Courtroom No. 5?Woods:\nYes... I'd had some time to rest so I was able to go and look for him. But then they called me into Courtroom No. 5 to testify. Apollo insisted on staying there, though...Athena:\nWith all those injuries? I wonder how he's managing?Woods:\nI think Apollo might have figured something out...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Wonder what it was...)Woods:\nHe told me, \"I'm going to look for evidence to clear your name, Juniper.\"Phoenix:\n(Just maybe, he found some new piece of evidence...?)Athena:\nAnyway, we'd better go and get him.Phoenix:\nGood idea.December 17, 12:11 PMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4Anime cutscene\nAthena:\nWhere are you, Apollo?! Trial's over for todaaay! C'mon, I know you're...?Woods:\nN-No...To be continuedDecember 18, 9:34 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 5Phoenix:\n............ (This isn't exactly how I envisioned the second day of this trial to start... ...but given how things ended yesterday...) ............ Good morning...Athena:\n............Woods:\n............Phoenix:\n(The mood sure is tense... Not that that's any surprise.)Woods:\n............Athena:\n............ Oh, hey, did you read the paper this morning, Boss?Phoenix:\nHuh? The paper? That came out of left field.Athena:\nYou didn't read it? Then you don't know the big news! Somebody spotted an abominable snowman waaaay up in the mountains!Phoenix:\n(Tell me you know the difference between a paper and a tabloid, Athena!)Athena:\nIt might show up in the forest where you live, Junie. So you'd better watch out! Okay?!Woods:\n............Athena:\n............ You really should read the story for yourself. I couldn't even begin to do it justice.Woods:\n! \"Justice\"...?Athena:\nHuh?Woods:\nOh, poor Apollo! And it's all my fault! *sniffle* Theeeeenaaa! *sob*Athena:\nOh, Junie! What was I thinking?! I'm so sorry!Phoenix:\nWhat we found yesterday... ...was not Apollo's dead body... thank goodness. He'd been assaulted by someone with a blow to his head, and was lying unconscious. We rushed him to the hospital right away, and it looks like he's going to pull through. (But it was still quite a shock to stumble onto a scene like that...)Phoenix:\nIs Ms. Woods all right, Athena?Athena:\nWell, I managed to get her to stop crying. Now she's resting on that sofa over there.Phoenix:\nI guess she really feels responsible for what happened to Apollo.Athena:\nPoor Junie. She believes that the reason Apollo was attacked... ...is because he was helping her look for something in that courtroom.Phoenix:\nOh? (Guess I can see why she'd think that...) By the way, how are you doing?Athena:\nWho, me?Phoenix:\nYeah, you. I know you're concerned about Ms. Woods, but are YOU all right?Athena:\nMe?! I-I'm doing just fine, boss! I mean, yeah, it was a huge shock, but I'm all right! People who've studied analytical psychology are great at times like these. After all, they've learned how to control their own emotions, too!Phoenix:\n(Somehow, I don't think it's as easy as she makes it sound. But there's no denying she's a real trooper.) Apollo doesn't remember a thing, does he?Athena:\nYeah... He can't recall anything from the time right before he was assaulted. Nothing about what he was doing in Courtroom No. 4, or who assaulted him. The doctor said it's probably due to that hit he took to the head.Phoenix:\n(Assaulted in a court of law and losing your memory at that... I know how that feels...)Athena:\nBut who in the world would do such a thing, huh, Mr. Wright?! Grr! Just WAIT till I get my hands on the coward who hurt our Apollo!Phoenix:\nNow, now, Athena... I thought you said you were in control of your emotions. Let's just focus on helping Ms. Woods, okay? (But I admit I'm just as upset as you.)Athena:\nO-Okay, Boss! You're right. Apollo's assailant can wait until after we clear Junie's name!Phoenix:\nThat's the spirit! (Now, let's see... I'd better check the Court Record one more time before the trial starts.* (Lines [If memory serves, when I have more than six pieces of evidence...] and [I should be able to switch pages with [D-Pad] or [Control Stick].] removed in the Trilogy release))Athena:\nEarth to Mr. Wright! I'm ready whenever you are!Phoenix:\nAll right. Let's get ready to rumble!Athena:\nYou bet!Phoenix:\n(With everything that happened with Apollo, I didn't have time for a proper investigation. I can't let that stop me, though. I have to get this right, for Ms. Woods's sake, and Apollo's, too!)December 18, 9:50 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 5Day 2Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Juniper Woods.Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe defense is also ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nNow, then. I believe I instructed the prosecution to further their investigation. Were you able to locate the remote switch in question?Payne:\nI'm afraid the remote switch is still missing, Your Honor.Judge:\nI must say I'm disappointed, Mr. Payne. Not angry, just disappointed.Payne:\nI-I apologize, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(Aha! Looks like the prosecution is just as unprepared as I am!)Payne:\nThere is a separate matter, however, that I would like to bring up during this trial.Judge:\nA separate matter, you say? And what might that be?Payne:\nI assume you are aware that another incident occurred during yesterday's trial? I'm speaking of course, of the assault on Mr. Justice in the ruins of Courtroom No. 4.Phoenix:\n(Uh-oh. Why is he bringing THAT up?)Judge:\nYes, what a truly harrowing experience it must have been. Poor Mr. Justice.Payne:\nAt the time of the attack, Mr. Justice was not alone. He was with the defendant, Ms. Juniper Woods.Phoenix:\n(He isn't going where I think he's going with this... is he?!)Payne:\nThe prosecution wishes to indict Ms. Woods on the charge of Mr. Justice's assault!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne! The incident under deliberation here is the courtroom bombing! The assault on Mr. Justice has nothing to do with this trial.Payne:\nAh, but I believe there IS a connection between this case and Mr. Justice's assault. Please take a moment to consider these facts. Both events occurred in Courtroom No. 4. This is the location in Courtroom No.4 where the unconscious Mr. Justice was discovered. As you can see, it's quite close to where Detective Arme's body was found.Courtroom No. 4 Diagram added to the Court Record.Payne:\nThe question is, why did the culprit feel the need to maliciously attack Mr. Justice?Judge:\nWhy indeed... What do you believe their motive to be, Mr. Payne?Payne:\nI believe Mr. Justice found something in that courtroom while Ms. Woods was with him -- evidence that fingered her as the perpetrator of the bombing!Judge:\nYou mean he found some incriminating evidence?!Payne:\nPrecisely! And so, I surmise that the defendant picked up a piece of rubble and... ...hit Mr. Justice on the back of the head in order to silence him!Athena:Athena:\nJunie would never do such a thing! She was devastated when we found Apollo hurt like that!Judge:\nM-Ms. Cykes, please control your outbursts.Payne:\n*ahem* It is the prosecution's belief that by deliberating on Mr. Justice's assault... ...we will draw ever closer to the truth of the courtroom bombing itself.Judge:\n...Very well. Ms. Woods is hereby officially indicted on the charge of assaulting Mr. Justice.Phoenix:\n(What?! Why are you listening to Mr. Toupée over there?! Although... considering our conversation yesterday...)Woods:\nI think Apollo might have figured something out...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Wonder what it was...)Woods:\nHe told me, \"I'm going to look for evidence to clear your name, Juniper.\"Phoenix:\n(Maybe the two incidents really are related after all...)Payne:\nI would like to start by hearing from the defendant herself.Judge:\nVery well. Bailiff, please bring Ms. Woods to the witness stand.Woods:\n............ *cough, cough* I-I'm sorry. *cough* I can't seem to stop... *cough*Phoenix:\n(Ms. Woods... Guess she's still really upset about Apollo...)Payne:\nMs. Woods, you went to the ruins of Courtroom No. 4 with Mr. Justice, did you not?Woods:\nY-Yes... I did...Payne:\nGood, good. If you would, then, please testify about what happened to the court.Witness Testimony-- Alone with Apollo --Woods:\nDuring the trial yesterday... I was overcome by a fit of coughing...\nApollo stayed with me and we went to the courtroom ruins together.\nBut then I was called back to this courtroom to give testimony...\nApollo insisted on staying behind in Courtroom No. 4.\nI swear I didn't attack Apollo! Why would I ever hurt such a kind person?Judge:\nSo Mr. Justice stayed by your side while you were feeling unwell...? What an admirable young man! I thought his loud voice was his only outstanding feature...Athena:\nHe may look like a little imp at times, but Apollo can be really nice, too!Phoenix:\n(I hope she didn't hurt her wrist backhanding that one out...)Judge:\nBut one has to wonder... Why did Mr. Justice stay behind in the ruins?Woods:\nI think Apollo might have figured something out...Judge:\nSomething? What kind of something?Woods:\nSomething to do with the courtroom bombing kind of something, I think...Judge:\nOh ho! New evidence for the case, was it?! That's a very big kind of something, indeed!Woods:\nI believe so. He mentioned looking for some evidence when I was called away.Payne:Payne:\nJust as I thought. There IS a connection between the two incidents. But the defendant has told a very big lie, Your Honor.Judge:\nWhat lie is that?Payne:\nWhen she learned Mr. Justice would be looking for evidence, she attacked him. She attacked him to give herself the chance to destroy that evidence!Woods:\nN-No...! I never...!Payne:Payne:\nMs. Woods repaid Mr. Justice's kindness with violence. We found the proof of her foul deed there in the courtroom ruins.Phoenix:\n(Wh-What on earth...?!)Payne:\nDo you see it? There in front of Mr. Justice's right hand? Witness the message he left us!Judge:\nIt-It's written in blood! \"W, O, O, D, S\"...? Why, isn't that...?Payne:\nThat's right, Your Honor, it says \"WOODS\" in capital letters.Woods:\nWhat...?Payne:\nI submit that Mr. Justice left us with the name of his attacker before he fainted!Apollo's Assault Photo added to the Court Record.Woods:\nN-No! That can't be true... Why would Apollo write my name...?Athena:\nMr. Wright! The NERVE of him leaving that message! Why would he do this?!Phoenix:\nH-Hey, don't take it out on me! I don't understand it any more than you do. (When we discovered Apollo yesterday...)Phoenix:\n(A-Apollo!)Woods:\n......N-No...!Athena:\nA-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!Phoenix:\n(We didn't even have a chance to rush over to him. As soon as security heard Athena's scream, they ran in and cordoned off the area. After that, they were in Courtroom No. 4 with Apollo the whole time. We couldn't investigate anything ourselves, and had to leave everything to the police. Still, I never thought they would find some bloody writing there...)Judge:\nNow then, please begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Alone with Apollo --Woods:\nDuring the trial yesterday... I was overcome by a fit of coughing...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you always cough when you get nervous, Ms. Woods?\nWoods:\nY-Yes... *cough* *cough*\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please do not make Ms. Woods nervous by pressing her so ruthlessly!\nPhoenix:\n(But that barely even qualified as a quasi-question...)\nAthena:\nLet's help her relax with a little small talk before we dive into the cross-examination! You know, ask her about her hobbies and her crushes and stuff!\nPhoenix:\n(Her crushes?! Really?! I don't know about this...)Woods:\nApollo stayed with me and we went to the courtroom ruins together.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy exactly did you go to the courtroom ruins?\nWoods:\nWe went to look for my medicine... to stop my coughing...\nPhoenix:\nYour medicine? Why would your medicine be in Courtroom No. 4?\nWoods:\nI dropped it in the heat of the moment. Bum Rap Rhiny... He was keeping my medicine safe for me... He has a little compartment that I can put things in, you see.\nPhoenix:\n(And Phony Phanty has the same type of pocket. That's where the bomb was inserted.)\nWoods:\nI had put my medicine for my coughing fits inside Bum Rap Rhiny. When I told Apollo about it, he said he'd help me go look for him. There was so much rubble in there! I was worried, but... ...there was no rubble or anything in front of the witness stand. So when we got inside, Apollo went straight there... ...and started looking for my Rhiny in that area. It was so nice of him to do that for me, in spite of all his injuries... Apollo is so strong and kind, just like the trees of the forest...\nPhoenix:\n(The way she makes him sound, you'd think Apollo was some kind of ancient god... Oh, wait...)\nJudge:\nHmm.. So that's why you went to the ruins. I see. That seems to be quite an important fact. Please add it to your testimony, Ms. Woods.\nAdds statement \"Apollo started looking for Bum Rap Rhiny near the witness stand, where there was no rubble.\" if not already addedWoods:\nApollo started looking for Bum Rap Rhiny near the witness stand, where there was no rubble.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe area around the witness stand?

I like sewing, too. I made this outfit myself.\nAthena:\nKeep it up, Mr. Wright! It's working! Now ask her if she has a crush on anyone.\nPhoenix:\n*ahem* So, um... is there anyone in particular you like right now?\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMr. Wright, is that question even remotely related to this case?\nPhoenix:\nTo this case...?

Why would I ever hurt such a kind person?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you think Mr. Justice is kind?\nWoods:\nYes, very kind! He rescued me. He's like the sun, strong and warm. He makes me feel strong, too.\nPhoenix:\n(The only adjectives I associate with the sun are \"sweltering\" and \"oppressive.\")\nWoods:\nBut then Apollo got hurt, and... and... It's all my fault! *sob*\nAthena:\nJ-Junie, Apollo's going to be fine! He's just like the sun, right? Well, the sun doesn't just drop out of the sky!\nWoods:\nYou really think he'll be fine?\nPayne:\nHeh heh. But the sun does go down at night...\nWoods:\nTh-Then that means...

I mean, that's just ridiculous!\nPhoenix:\nRight. I agree. (They must've gone to look for Bum Rap Rhiny together. But why did they need to find it so badly that they'd go to all that trouble? I'd better try to find out more.)After pressing second statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthena:\nSo Apollo was trying to help Juniper... Who knew that Apollo could be such a sweetheart?!\nPhoenix:\nIt must've been pretty hard on him, too, with all that rubble everywhere.\nAthena:\nNow that I think about it, there's something odd about what Apollo was able to do.\nPhoenix:\nYou know, considering what Ms. Woods said just now, I think you're right. That courtroom was in a very unusual state, after all. (Which leaves the million-dollar question: what would explain this contradiction?

You know, ask her about her hobbies and her crushes and stuff!\nPhoenix:\n(Her crushes?! Really?! I don't know about this...)Woods:\nApollo stayed with me and we went to the courtroom ruins together.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy exactly did you go to the courtroom ruins?\nWoods:\nWe went to look for my medicine... to stop my coughing...\nPhoenix:\nYour medicine? Why would your medicine be in Courtroom No. 4?\nWoods:\nI dropped it in the heat of the moment. Bum Rap Rhiny... He was keeping my medicine safe for me... He has a little compartment that I can put things in, you see.\nPhoenix:\n(And Phony Phanty has the same type of pocket. That's where the bomb was inserted.)\nWoods:\nI had put my medicine for my coughing fits inside Bum Rap Rhiny. When I told Apollo about it, he said he'd help me go look for him. There was so much rubble in there! I was worried, but... ...there was no rubble or anything in front of the witness stand. So when we got inside, Apollo went straight there... ...and started looking for my Rhiny in that area. It was so nice of him to do that for me, in spite of all his injuries... Apollo is so strong and kind, just like the trees of the forest...\nPhoenix:\n(The way she makes him sound, you'd think Apollo was some kind of ancient god... Oh, wait...)\nJudge:\nHmm.. So that's why you went to the ruins. I see. That seems to be quite an important fact.

Anyway, let's see what happens when I present what I suspect is our answer...)Phoenix:\nSo he started his search with the witness stand, you say?Woods:\nThat's right. I guess maybe he wanted to start from the furthest point in the room. He was being so brave... *cough* and strong... *cough*Phoenix:\nBut that's odd... Under the circumstances, he shouldn't have been capable of that...Woods:\nBut he WAS! And he still IS! He might not look it, but he really IS brave! And kind, too!Phoenix:\nNo, that's not the part I was finding fault with. (SOMEONE has a crush on Apollo...) What you are claiming is something that no one should have been able to do.Judge:\nBut I should think that anyone can be brave and kind if the wanted to be, Mr. Wright...!Phoenix:\nTrue, anyone can be brave and kind, but if you would please take a look at this diagram. With the courtroom in this state, how was it possible to walk up to the witness stand?Woods:\nOh!Judge:\nHmm. I see your point. The rubble blocks off access to the area around the witness stand.Payne:\nHmph. Does such a tiny inconsistency even matter? Perhaps the witness is simply misremembering it.Phoenix:\nUrk. (Great, now I'M not so sure it matters...)Payne:\nA real man doesn't make mountains out of mole hills, you know.Judge:\nBut that's precisely what Mr. Wright does best.Phoenix:\n(I call slander, Your Honor!)Judge:\nSo, was it really impossible to approach the witness stand? I have to say, it's a bit hard to tell with any accuracy from just this diagram. Mr. Payne, do you have any other photos of the crime scene?Payne:\nEr, let me see, Your Honor... Ah, yes. I have one more. Here it is. It's a more pulled-back version of the photo I presented before.Apollo's Assault Photo updated in the Court Record.Phoenix:\n(Huh? What's that hunk of metal on wheels?) Mr. Payne, is the metallic object in that photo Mr. Tonate's bomb transport case?Payne:\nThat's right. Is there some problem?Judge:\nAh, yes. That transport case was there in Courtroom No. 4 when the bomb went off. It must have been there ever since.Woods:\nOh! That's it!Phoenix:\nMs. Woods? Have you remembered something?Woods:\nY-Yes! I just realized... Its position... It's different from before...Phoenix:\nIts position? The position of what?Woods:\nUm, the position of that big metal thing.Phoenix:\nThe bomb transport case?Woods:\nYes. When Apollo and I went there, it was in a different place. Where the case is in the photo was open space, so it was easy to search the stand.Phoenix:\nI see. So where was the transport case when you and Mr. Justice saw it?Woods:\nAs I recall, I think it was more to the right...Phoenix:\nTo the right...? (Then that means...! In that case, the case was over there at the time of Apollo's attack...? Hmm...)Payne:\nWho cares where the transport case was when? What difference does it make? It has nothing at all to do with what we were talking ab--Phoenix:Phoenix:\nWhere the transport case was has EVERYTHING to do with this discussion!! In fact, it's so important that it's enough to turn the prosecution's argument on its ear!Payne:\nWh-What...?!Judge:\nWell! That certainly sounds very relevant indeed! And you sound as though you know where the case was at the time of the attack.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. This diagram represents the crime scene as shown in the photo. And this is where the transport case was at the time of the assault on Mr. Justice. (All right, I have this! The bomb transport case was here at the time of Apollo's attack!)Present bloody writing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, I assert that this is where the transport case was at the time of the assault!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, I assert that this is where the transport case was at the time of the assault!\nJudge:\nThere...? Hmm... I'm afraid I fail to follow your logic.\nAthena:\nUh, Boss... I don't think anyone could follow that logic, even with a tracking device.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I'm pretty sure my logic just made a clean getaway, even from me...\nJudge:\nPerhaps a penalty will help you rethink your \"position.\"\nPhoenix:\n...Ow. (I'd better take another good look at the evidence... I think there was a clue in there about where the transport case was...)\nJudge:\nNow, then. Let's try that again, shall we?\nLeads back to:\n(All right, I have this! The bomb transport case was here at the time of Apollo's attack!)Phoenix:\nYour Honor, I assert that this is where the transport case was at the time of the assault!Judge:\nBut that's...!Payne:\n...I-Inconceivable!Phoenix:\nMs. Woods, was this where the transport case was when you saw it?Woods:\nYes... Yes, that's where it was!Phoenix:\nThank you, Ms. Woods. I'm sure the court has noted an interesting fact about this position.Judge:\nThe transport case covers up the writing in blood!Phoenix:\nExactly! If the transport case was in that position at the time of the assault... ...then no message could have been written there, because the case was in the way! Which leads us to conclude that Mr. Justice couldn't have left that bloody writing!Payne:Payne:\nWhy should we believe the defendant's claim that the case was in a different position?! She's obviously lying!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThe fact that the case was moved after the assault on Mr. Justice... ...is proved by more than Ms. Woods's testimony alone!Payne:\nWh-What?! And where is this \"proof\" you're talking about?!Phoenix:\nIt's right here in the crime photo.Judge:\nHmm... I'm keen to see this proof, myself, Mr. Wright. What in this photo indicates that the transport case was moved after the assault?Present wheel tracks on bandages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Please take a look at the mark that runs over Mr. Justice's bandages here!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAll the proof you'll need, Your Honor, is right... here?\nJudge:\nHmm. I'm afraid I don't follow.\nAthena:\nMr. Wright! I'm sensing feelings of doubt from you... Which means... you're just taking a wild stab in the dark, aren't you?\nPhoenix:\nOuch. You're good. I bet you can also tell how I'm about to feel in a few seconds, too.\nJudge:\nYou just earned yourself a penalty.\nPhoenix:\n(If the transport case was moved after the assault, there should be some evidence of it. I'd better take another good look at the photo.)\nJudge:\nI suggest you give it another try, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"What in this photo indicates that the transport case was moved after the assault?\"Phoenix:\nPlease take a look at the mark that runs over Mr. Justice's bandages here!Judge:\nI see it, but what is it?Phoenix:\nThis mark was made by one of the casters from the transport case carrying the bomb. As the case was moved, it ran over his bandages! In other words, the transport case was originally to the right of Mr. Justice! Then, after Mr. Justice was assaulted... ...the transport case was moved!Payne:\nWHAAAAAT?!Phoenix:\nJust as Ms. Woods said, the case was covering the writing at the time of the assault! Therefore, it was impossible for Mr. Justice to have left that message in blood!Payne:\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Athena:\nYou did it, Boss! It was a real nail-biter, but you pulled it off!Phoenix:\nYup. That should bring down the prosecution's claim like a house of cards.Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Wright, that was a very clever deduction.Phoenix:\nAww, it was nothing, Your Honor. (Nothing but pure genius! Take THAT!)Athena:\nBoss! I'm sensing a definite \"smug and braggy\" vibe coming off of you...Payne:\nUuuuungh...Judge:\nI have just one question, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nIf Mr. Justice didn't leave this message in blood... ..then who did?Phoenix:\nHuh?Athena:\nWhat?Woods:\n*cough*Payne:\n............ Oh!Phoenix:\nW-Well... ............ (Looks like I should've taken that train of thought through to the last station...)Payne:\nWell, well. I've heard a lot about this. So this is Mr. Wright's famous bluffing technique, is it?Judge:\nAh, this feeling! It brings back memories of the old days! Back when you carved out a name for yourself by bluffing your way through thick and thin!Athena:\nGee, Mr. Wright. The judge kind of makes you sound no better than a two-bit con man...Payne:\nYou made your argument with such confidence, Mr. Wright. Now I'd like to hear your answer with just as much confidence!Phoenix:\n(Hey, until the judge asked the question, you didn't catch on, either, buster!)Athena:\nWh-What now, Boss?!Payne:\nHeh heh heh. I hope you didn't bluff your way into a corner.Phoenix:\n(Think, Phoenix, think! There must be a way through this! I have to dig my way to the truth somehow! Who could have written that message in blood?)The culprit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Apollo didn't leave that bloody writing...)\nAthena:\nMaybe it was Apollo's attacker who wrote it, and made it look like Apollo did it?\nPhoenix:\n(That seems like the most reasonable explanation...)\nAthena:\nBut wait a minute! I just realized something, Boss.\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nAthena:\nLook at the amount of blood in the photo. It doesn't look like Apollo bled very much... I wonder if it's possible to write out \"WOODS\" with just this much?\nPhoenix:\nHey, you're right! Good thing Apollo didn't lose that much blood. That might be a factor in why he survived the assault.\nAthena:\nAnd since there was so little blood, that pretty much rules out his attacker, huh?\nPhoenix:\nI guess so. But if it wasn't his attacker, then who else could it have been?\nLeads back to:\n\"Who could have written that message in blood?\"Apollo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe person who wrote the bloody message... was none other than Mr. Justice!\nJudge:\nPardon me?\nPayne:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nAthena:\nM-Mr. Wright! Didn't you just finish saying that it COULDN'T have been Apollo?! And don't try to blame it on \"old age\"!\nPhoenix:\nOh, yeah... (I did just say that, didn't I?)\nPayne:\nNot only does your head resemble a bird, but it seems that you have a bird brain as well.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please try to think before you speak.\nPhoenix:\nUgh... (I'd better give that another try.)\nLeads back to:\n\"Who could have written that message in blood?\"Someone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"If it wasn't Apollo, who could have left the bloody message?\"Phoenix:\n(If it wasn't Apollo, who could have left the bloody message?)Present Candice Arme profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"To be honest, I don't have any real proof of this...\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nThis person left the bloody writing?! And what do you case this claim on?\nPhoenix:\nUh, do I reeeally need to base my claim on something?\nAthena:\nBoss!\nJudge:\nOf course you do. Don't tell me you don't have anything at all to back up your assertion?\nPhoenix:\nUh... Nothing in particular, really...\nJudge:\nThat won't do, Mr. Wright. But a penalty will make up for your deficiency very nicely.\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nAthena:\nSo it wasn't Apollo or his attacker... When you think about who was at the crime scene... ...there's only one other person who it could really be.\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah! Wasn't there another person who shed blood at the crime scene?\nLeads back to:\n\"If it wasn't Apollo, who could have left the bloody message?\"Phoenix:\n(To be honest, I don't actually have any real proof of this... But I've come this far. There's no turning back now!) Besides Apollo, there was one more person who shed blood at this crime scene.Judge:\nA person who shed blood...? You don't mean...?!Phoenix:\nOh, but I do. I believe it was Candice Arme who left behind this message in blood.Judge:\nWHAAAT?!Athena:\nWhat?! Detective Arme?! Are you sure you know what you're doing here?!Phoenix:\nUm, not really?Payne:Payne:\nWhat kind of ridiculous assertion is that?! If you had said the attacker left the message to throw people off, it might've made sense.Phoenix:\nAt first glance, that would seem to be the most reasonable explanation. However... ...Apollo didn't shed enough blood to write such an extensive message.Payne:\nUh-oh...!Judge:\nAh, I see. Even the photo makes it clear there wasn't enough blood to write all those letters. And Mr. Justice did survive. I suppose he didn't bleed very extensively, in that case.Payne:\nBut why would Detective Arme write the defendant's name? There is no connection between the two whatsoever!Woods:\nA-And I-I didn't even know the lady who was killed...!Payne:\nI admit the investigation didn't turn up any connection between the victim and defendant.Payne:\nThey had never even met each other!Phoenix:\n(That's... very true...) Well, then, let's see... Then maybe the intended meaning of the message is not what it appears to be.Judge:\nThe \"intended meaning\"...?Woods:\n\"Not what it appears to be\"...?Phoenix:\nMaybe the message was not intended to be \"WOODS.\"Judge:\n............ Coming from you, that's quite the bold statement, Mr. Wright. You wish to assert that this bloody writing could have some other meaning?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor! (Hmm... For something I pulled out of a wormhole, it could turn out to be true, right?)Payne:Payne:\nHmph! It clearly says \"WOODS,\" as anyone can plainly see! What other meaning could it possibly have?!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut Candice Arme was a detective! Maybe \"WOODS\" only means something to the police. Like a police scanner code, for example.Judge:\nHmm... I didn't think of that...Payne:\nHeh heh. You may have tricked His Honor, but you'll never get the best of me. I have a thing for studying on the weekends, as you may have already guessed. And there is no such radio code as \"WOODS\" in the state, dear Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nI-Is that a fact, heh heh...Athena:\nDon't look at me. I know as much as you do about police codes.Judge:\nEnough of this! I was quite taken with the defense's new theory... ...but if they can't substantiate it with anything, then I must end things here.Phoenix:\nNo! Please wait, Your Honor!Judge:\nVery well. But before we discuss this theory any further, I demand a plausible explanation. So, Mr. Wright, what is the true meaning of the bloody writing?Phoenix:\nWell... I believe it's...Judge:\nAnd no stalling! If you can't come up with an answer quickly, I will declare this discussion officially over.Phoenix:\n(I'm in trouble now... What other meaning could it have, besides the obvious one...? Maybe it means something in another language? Or maybe it's a code? Think, Phoenix! You can do this!)Judge:\nWhich piece of evidence will tell us what the word \"WOODS\" really means?Present Bomb Transport Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The bomb transport case...?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\n............ Hmm. What exactly is your point, Mr. Wright? I thought this evidence was supposed to tell me what \"WOODS\" really means...?\nPhoenix:\n...But doesn't it, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nAre you asking me or telling me?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll let you be the judge of that.\nJudge:\nYes, I'll do the judging around here! And I judge that you deserve a penalty!\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh. That didn't go over well. But I just KNOW there's something here that looks like the word \"WOODS\"...)\nJudge:\nNow, then. Let's try that again, shall we?\nLeads back to:\n\"Which piece of evidence will tell us what the word \"WOODS\" really means?\"Judge:\nThe bomb transport case...? I've about had it up to here with your shenanigans, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nTake a look at the numbers on this case, Your Honor. \"L10015R\". Doesn't this string look vaguely familiar?Judge:\n\"L100\"... What does that have to do with anything?Payne:\nHmph. What could those numbers possibly have to do with the case at hand?Phoenix:\nNow please take a look at the bloody writing shown in the crime photo.Athena:\nOh! I think I see it!Phoenix:\n(Thatta girl! That one's on my side.)Judge:\nIt says \"WOODS.\"Phoenix:\nOr, you could say it's a horse of a different color, Your Honor. The first character isn't a \"W\". It's actually an \"L\" and a \"1\". The next two are zeros.Judge:\nOh! My goodness!Phoenix:\nThe true meaning behind the bloody writing isn't Ms. Woods's name. It's the number engraved on this bomb transport case!Payne:Payne:\nWhat are you talking about?! The next part doesn't make any sense! The next number is a \"1\", but the bloody writing says \"D\"!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut the number on the case and the bloody writing can be made to match up quite easily. This is how the number on the transport case can be made to match the bloody writing!Erase one line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAll you have to do is erase one line from the writing!\nJudge:\nErase one line from where?\nPhoenix:\nAnywhere you like.\nJudge:\nA-Anywhere I'd like?! ...All right. I'll erase one of the \"Os.\" \"WODS\"? And what is that supposed to mean?\nPhoenix:\nYour state of mind. I believe it stands for \"wise, optimistic, dauntless, and serene.\"\nAthena:\nBoss, what in the world?! This is no time for a psychology test!\nJudge:\nI can't say my state of mind is exactly \"serene\" right now, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUrngh. (I guess erasing just one line won't do the trick.)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please refrain from making things up as you go along! Now, try again!\nLeads back to:\n\"This is how the number on the transport case can be made to match the bloody writing!\"Erase two lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Please erase the third, downward stroke of the \"W\", and the curved part of the \"D.\"\"Read it backwards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI propose we read it backwards. Let's see... Reading it from the back end, we get... \"SDOOW\".\nJudge:\nI see. And what does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nI believe there was someone connected to this case by the name of \"S. Doow\"... ...wasn't there, Your Honor?\nAthena:\nAnd who in the world is \"S. Doow\" supposed to be, Boss...?\nJudge:\nI'm afraid there is no such person connected to this case.\nPhoenix:\nYes, well, I guess I expected as much.\nJudge:\nIf you knew, then why did you ask?!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess reading it backwards was a big bust.)\nJudge:\nPlease try again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"This is how the number on the transport case can be made to match the bloody writing!\"Phoenix:\nPlease erase the third, downward stroke of the \"W\", and the curved part of the \"D.\"Judge:\nWell! Would you look at that! ............ \"LIOOIS\"?Phoenix:\nNo, no, Your Honor! It isn't meant to be read as a word! It's the number \"L-1-0-0-1-5\"... ...which, if you take away the final \"R\"... ...is the exact same number that's one the bomb transport case!Payne:Payne:\nHmph! Erase two lines, and they match up, you say?! Well, I can change anything into anything else simply by erasing two lines! What if we erased two lines from your name?! Would you be happy as \"Mr. Wrigh\"?!Judge:\nWell? Would you, Mr. Wrigh?Phoenix:\nThe only RIGHT spelling is \"Wright!\" (Okay, I'm doing pretty well here, and I think I've drawn the right conclusion. Detective Arme's real message to us is the bomb transport case number.) Your Honor, the two lines were added by the real culprit to intentionally mislead people!Payne:\nWHAAAT?!Phoenix:\nThe original message Detective Arme left behind was the transport case number! But whoever assaulted Apollo changed the message!Athena:\nIf you're right, Boss... ...then what do you suppose Detective Arme was trying to tell us?Phoenix:\n(Good question... What DOES this number represent...?)Tonate:\nDO YOU SEE THIS NUMBER HERE? THAT IS MY IDENTIFICATION NUMBER.Phoenix:\nCandice Arme lost her life in the courtroom bombing. Her dying message could only have had one purpose!Payne:\nN-No!Phoenix:\nTo tell us the name of the one responsible for the bombing!Judge:\nWell? Don't keep us in suspense, Mr. Wright! Tell us who she was trying to name!Phoenix:\nThe culprit that the victim was trying to identify is none other than...Present Ted Tonate profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The defense wishes to indict Mr. Ted Tonate on the charge of the courtroom bombing!\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n...This person...?\nJudge:\n............And how did you come up with that?\nPhoenix:\nDo I really need to explain? I think the answer should be obvious...\nPayne:\nThere he goes again with his famous \"wild guess\" tactic. Your Honor, Mr. Wright deserves nothing less than a penalty for wasting the court's time.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, I would ask that you not use guesswork to pin the crime on a person. Or else, my \"guess\" is that you will get a penalty.\nPhoenix:\n...Drat! (Looks like I guessed wrong...)\nPayne:\nHeh heh heh. My brother Winston warned me about you many times. \"Watch out for the shady defense lawyer in blue and his wild guesses,\" he said.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, that's not very nice.) L-Let me try again, please, Your Honor!\nLeads back to:\n\"The culprit that the victim was trying to identify is none other than...\"Phoenix:\nThe defense wishes to indict Mr. Ted Tonate on the charge of the courtroom bombing!Judge:\nT-Ted Tonate?!Phoenix:\nApparently, disabling bombs isn't Mr. Tonate's only specialty. Somehow, the victim must have realized that he was the bomber. So when she was caught in the blast... ...she left his bomb transport case number as her dying message. She used Mr. Tonate's own ID number to finger him for the crime!Payne:Payne:\nWhy would anyone go out of their way to write an ID number?! Wouldn't they simply write the person's name?!Phoenix:\n(He's got a good point there.)Judge:\nWhat do you have to say to that, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nThat only Detective Arme would know the answer to that, but allow me to offer a theory. Perhaps Detective Arme couldn't recall Mr. Tonate's name in the heat of the moment. As I recall, this was the first meeting between the two. It's entirely possible they wouldn't have been familiar with each other.Athena:\nOr maybe using the ID number was a way to hide its true meaning from the real culprit! Thus lowering the odds that they would erase the bloody writing.Phoenix:\nBut no matter what the reason, the important thing is the meaning behind her message. The fact remains, she wrote Mr. Tonate's ID number!Payne:Payne:\nNow, just one moment here! There hasn't been any proof yet that it was indeed Detective Arme who wrote it! The bloody writing wasn't found during the investigation after the blast! If Detective Arme had left the message, it should have been found at that time!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNaturally Mr. Tonate hid it before anyone could discover it. And there's a simple explanation for how he was able to do so.Payne:\nWh-What?Phoenix:\nMr. Tonate was able to cover the message up because he's...A stickler for details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Tonate is quite a nervous person, a stickler for details. That's why the bloody writing bothered him.\nJudge:\nBut wouldn't the bloody writing bother him whether he was a stickler for details or not?\nPhoenix:\nOh, I don't know about that, Your Honor. For example, I doubt it would bother Athena here. (She doesn't seem like one for details... I don't think...)\nAthena:\nWhat?! I object to his accusation, Your Honor! I object whole-heartedly!\nJudge:\nAnd I object to your lame explanation, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nOuch. (I object to this pain...)\nAthena:\nBut seriously, I wonder why nobody discovered the bloody writing?\nPhoenix:\nBecause Mr. Tonate was able to do something to hide it. And that was because...\nAthena:\nYes...?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I know how Mr. Tonate was able to cover the bloody writing up! Please let me try to explain one more time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Tonate was able to cover the message up because he's...\"The first to find the body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The first person to discover the bloody writing was Mr. Tonate himself.\"Wearing those weird goggles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Tonate was wearing those weird goggles of his! Thanks to them, he was able to notice the bloody writing before anyone else could. That super-extendo binocular vision of his... I mean, how weird is that, right?!\nAthena:\nI-I agree it's pretty strange, but I don't see what it has to do with the bloody writing...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, I don't appreciate careless accusations based on flimsy assertions. Penalty!\nPhoenix:\n(I still think those goggles are pretty weird. I mean, c'mon. Right?) I know how Mr. Tonate was able to cover up the bloody writing, I swear! Your Honor, please let me try to explain one more time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Mr. Tonate was able to cover the message up because he's...\"Phoenix:\nThe first person to discover the bloody writing was Mr. Tonate himself.Tonate:\nI WAS THE FIRST ONE ON THE SCENE AFTER THE EXPLOSION. I WENT THERE TO ENSURE SAFETY, BUT I ENDED UP DISCOVERING A DEAD BODY.Phoenix:\nWhen Mr. Tonate saw that the victim had written his ID number... ...he used his bomb transport case to cover up the bloody writing as a stopgap measure.Athena:\nOh, so that's why the message in blood was under the transport case!Phoenix:\nHe didn't have enough time to try and scrub away the writing. If he didn't report the body right away, he would look suspicious. So those letters lived on to serve another function... ...when Mr. Tonate used them in another incident!Judge:\nOh! The assault on Mr. Justice!Phoenix:\nExactly. Mr. Tonate hit upon a plan to use the bloody writing for his own purposes. So he didn't clean it away. Instead, he made it look like Mr. Justice wrote it. By adding two lines to the writing that Detective Arme left behind... ...he changed the meaning of the message! He made it look like Mr. Justice was accusing Ms. Woods of the attack!Athena:\nSo that means...!Phoenix:\nThe only person who could have altered the bloody writing was the courtroom bomber... ...who was the same person that assaulted Mr. Justice. And that person is Ted Tonate!Payne:\nGaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!Judge:\nOrder in the court! Order, I say! It looks like we will have to hear from the bomb specialist himself. Mr. Payne, please have Mr. Tonate take the witness stand!Payne:\nUngh... Yes, Your Honor...Athena:\nThat was great, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nJust doing what I do best! (Which is flying by the seat of my pants...)Tonate:\nDISMANTLING THE CASE IS YOURS. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE IT? I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU TRY.Phoenix:\n(I've finally drawn Mr. Tonate back onto the witness stand. Looks like you'll get your wish, goggle-man. Now watch me take your lies apart!)Tonate:\n............Judge:\nMr. Tonate, I'm afraid we have a few more questions for you.Tonate:\nI UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION, YOUR HONOR. I WAS KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE PROCEEDINGS FROM THE GALLERY. THE ALLEGATIONS ARE ALL LAUGHABLE.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nI wouldn't be laughing if I were you, Mr. Tonate. The message in blood matches your ID number! The same ID number that is there on that bomb transport case!Tonate:\nSUCH A FARFETCHED THEORY! NO BETTER THAN A TANGLED BALL OF WIRES. I'll have them untangled for you in no time at all! (Changed from [I've [sic] have them untangled for you in no time at all!] in the original release)Phoenix:\nYou were the first person on the scene after Detective Arme left her message in blood. You were the only one who could've hidden the writing, and then used it again later!Tonate:\nI SEE x2. BUT THEN, LET ME ASK YOU: DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF THAT DETECTIVE ARME WROTE THAT MESSAGE?Judge:\nThat's a very good question. Well, do you, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(The best way to prove that Detective Arme wrote that message is to...)Analyze the handwriting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, I request a handwriting analysis be performed on the bloody writing.\nJudge:\nA handwriting analysis...?\nPayne:\nI'm sorry, but that's just not possible.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nPayne:\nUnlike writing done with a pen, for example, a message written with a finger... ...is difficult to properly analyze for unique characteristics. And with such a small sample, it would be even more difficult to analyze.\nPhoenix:\nArgh... (There's gotta be another way.)\nLeads back to:\n\"The best way to prove that Detective Arme wrote that message is to...\"Analyze the DNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, I request that a DNA test be performed on the blood itself.\"Phoenix:\nYour Honor, I request that a DNA test be performed on the blood itself.

Please put in a request for a DNA test with the forensics team!Bailiff:\nYes, Your Honor!Judge:\nIt will be some time before we have the results of the analysis.

IT IS AS PLAIN AS DAY THAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN IT.Payne:\nIt's true that the body was discovered near the entrance to the courtroom. Please have a look at this crime scene photo. As you can see, there is blood on the rubble near the victim's body. She must've died after hitting her head there.Courtroom Bombing Photo added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... I see.

Rest assured, Mr. Tonate, I understand how you must've felt.\nJudge:\nAnd so you discovered your ID number written in blood at the scene, and...?\nTonate:\nTHAT IS RIGHT. I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES. IT VERY CLEARLY SAID \"L10015R.\"Present Apollo's Assault Photo or Bloody Writing Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I just want to make doubly sure that \"L10015R\" is really what you saw written in blood.\"Tonate:\nBUT I DID NOT DETONATE THE BOMB.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDidn't you? The victim may have had special knowledge of who the bomber was.\nTonate:\nI HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THOUGHTS DETECTIVE ARME MAY HAVE HAD INSIDE HER HEAD. IT IS NOT LIKE I EVER DISMANTLED HER MIND TO CHECK.\nPayne:\nMr. Wright, if you have suspicions about the witness, let's see your proof. Evidence is everything in a court of law. Even school children know that. How many years have you been a defense attorney now?!\nPhoenix:\nCut me some slack, will you...?\nAthena:\nD-Don't feel bad, Boss! You just got your attorney's badge back, after all. In that sense, you're still more of a beginner than I am!\nPhoenix:\n(.........I suppose I should be thankful you're not a licensed psychologist.)\nJudge:\nMr. Tonate, please continue with your testimony.\nTonate:\nWITH PLEASURE. MY ID NUMBER WAS LEFT AT THE SCENE, BUT...Tonate:\nDETECTIVE ARME MUST HAVE MISTAKEN ME FOR THE REAL BOMBER.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy \"mistaken,\" do you mean you had nothing to do with the explosion?\nTonate:\nTHAT IS CORRECT. THAT IS WHY I WAS SO SHOCKED WHEN I SAW MY ID NUMBER.\nPayne:\nThe victim may have suspected Mr. Tonate for no reason other than the fact that... ...as the bomb specialist, he was in charge of the bomb. In other words, a false accusation! It's vocational discrimination, I say!\nJudge:\nHmm... I do not support discrimination of any kind.\nPayne:\nWell spoken, Your Honor! If the victim had been found to be killed with a gavel... ...Mr. Blue Suit over there would probably have pinned the crime on you!\nJudge:\nH-He would?! Well! That just wouldn't do! Mr. Wright, if you DARE try to pin anything on me, I will find you in contempt of court!\nPhoenix:\n(But I've never even TRIED to harm a hair on-- er, a strand of your beard, Your Honor!)\nTonate:\nWELL SAID, MR. PAYNE. BECAUSE I AM SO CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH BOMBS... ...I WAS AFRAID I WOULD BE PROSECUTED IF ANYONE SAW THE BLOODY WRITING.Tonate:\nNOT WANTING TO BE ACCUSED, I MOVED THE BODY AND COVERED THE WRITING. MY BAD.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't think to clean away the bloody writing?\nTonate:\nI DIDN'T HAVE TIME. BY THE TIME I FOUND THE MESSAGE, THE BLOOD WAS ALREADY DRY. THE POLICE WERE WAITING JUST OUTSIDE FOR ME TO SECURE THE ROOM. AND I STILL HAD TO MOVE THE BODY. I WAS IN A PANIC. WITH NO TIME TO SPARE, I TEMPORARILY COVERED THE WRITING WITH MY CASE.\nPhoenix:\nDidn't you think the police would find it during their investigation?\nTonate:\nREGULATION STIPULATES ONLY SPECIALISTS MAY TOUCH TRANSPORT CASES. BECAUSE OF THE DANGER, YOU SEE. I THOUGHT I WOULD CLEAN UP THE WRITING ONCE THEY WERE FINISHED. MY BAD.Athena:\n\"My bad\"?! Does he really think that will just magically smooth everything over?!Phoenix:\nThis guy is something else. And I don't believe Detective Arme's dying message was just some mistake. He won't wriggle out of this that easily! (What did Mr. Tonate see when he first discovered the bloody writing...? There has to be a contradiction hidden in his testimony somewhere!)"

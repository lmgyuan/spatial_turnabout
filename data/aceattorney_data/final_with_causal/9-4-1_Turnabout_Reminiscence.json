The piece of cloth that she conjured up has taken me back to many years ago...\n-- 7 Years Earlier --\nDefendant:\nYeah, that's right. I did it. I killed the guy. But it was the Great Thief Yatagarasu that told me to do it!\n???:\nLawyer:\nI ask the defendant... Just what exactly are you trying to say?\nDefendant:\nDon't you get it? I know the true identity of the Yatagarasu! ...The Yatagarasu is the man standing over there at the prosecutor's bench!\nProsecutor:\nAre you saying... that I'm the Yatagarasu?\nDefendant:\nDon't you dare deny it! You told me to kill him when you snuck into the embassy!\nLawyer:\nAre you claiming that Mr. Faraday is the Yatagarasu?\nDefendant:\nThat's exactly what I'm saying!\nProsecutor:\nProsecutor:\nMr. Rell! I think we've heard just about enough out of you...!\nDefendant:\nYour Honor! Please listen to me! I'm telling the truth... You've gotta believe meeeeeee!\nJudge:\nHmph... In accordance with the defendant's accusation... ...a new prosecutor shall be called to replace Mr. Faraday. This court will be in recess until the new prosecutor is ready.\nSeptember 10, 3:20 PM\nDistrict Court - 3rd Floor Lobby\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront of badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor... ...but my mentor has taught me that it's more fashionable to keep it in my pocket.\n\n\n\n\nBack of badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nEach Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!\nEdgeworth:\n(...It's almost time for me to enter the courtroom. And, so it is that my first assignment as a prosecutor will be... ...as a replacement for a prosecutor who has been accused by the defendant.)\n???:\nEdgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n! ...Sir.\n???:\nHave you read over all of the documents regarding this trial?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, sir. I've memorized everything there is to know.\n???:\nVery good. The paperwork for the prosecutor substitution is just about complete. Edgeworth... always bear in mind that as your mentor, I, Manfred von Karma... ...will accept nothing short of perfection.\nEdgeworth:\nI understand, sir. To have the chance to stand in court at such an early stage in my career... ...I am honored and proud.\nManfred:\nAs I have watched over your studies, I am giving you this very rare chance. Prove yourself. Crush the defendant's pathetic lies into oblivion.\nEdgeworth:\n.........Yes, sir! (That such a legendary prosecutor will be watching (changed from [is watching over] in the original release) and judging my performance... ...I have to be perfect in every way!)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManfred von Karma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManfred:\nToday's trial should have ended in just one minute.\nEdgeworth:\nBecause the defendant was picked up by the security camera, correct?\nManfred:\n...Exactly. The killer had the gall to say that he only killed because he was instructed to do so. Even more outrageous is his claim that the case prosecutor. Byrne Faraday, gave the order. Hah! Faraday is such a fool! He's been cornered by his very own prey.\nEdgeworth:\nSir... Are you an acquaintance of Mr. Byrne Faraday?\nManfred:\nHmph. He is a pathetic man who speaks nothing but nonsense.\nEdgeworth:\nNonsense...?\nManfred:\nHe once tried to explain to me a way of punishing \"those who cannot be brought to court\".\nEdgeworth:\n\"Those who cannot be brought to court\"...? That IS nonsense, for no man is above the law.\nManfred:\nWell... there are always a few exceptions. However, there is no reason to even deal with such individuals. A prosecutor is a guardian of the court, one with no obligation to outside matters.\nEdgeworth:\n(Thus, there is no reason to deal with such individuals, I see.)\nManfred:\nEdgeworth... Disgracing yourself as Faraday has will not be forgiven.\nEdgeworth:\nHave no fear. I will not let you down, sir. In place of the accused Prosecutor Byrne Faraday, I'll prove the defendant's guilt!\nManfred:\nVery good. I've secured an hour of recess for you to prepare to do just that. Show them all... the power of Von Karma!\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManfred:\nSo, have you achieved a firm understanding of the case?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, sir. I have memorized everything that is written down in the case files.\nManfred:\nWell then, explain the case to me. ...I want to see if you really know what you are talking about.\nEdgeworth:\nUnderstood. A murder was committed on September 8th in front of the Cohdopian Embassy. The victim, Mr. Deid Mann, was a staff member at the embassy. The defendant in this case, Mr. Mack Rell... ...was held for questioning the night of the incident as he was deemed suspicious. He was quickly placed under arrest (changed from [arrested] in the original release, correcting the typo) for possession of the murder weapon, a gun. Furthermore, at the time of the murder... ...the Great Thief \"Yatagarasu\" had successfully infiltrated the Cohdopian Embassy as well. At first, Rell claimed that he himself was the Yatagarasu... ...but that he did not kill Deid Mann. I wonder what he expected to gain from such a desperate lie?\nManfred:\nIt's possible that he wants to go down while in the spotlight, if he is found guilty. There truly is no limit to people's inanity... But I digress. Continue, Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, sir. During the trial, the prosecution presented the security footage that captured the murder... The footage clearly showed Mr. Rell as the murderer.\nManfred:\nThe act of Mr. Rell firing the gun could be clearly seen from the visitor's gallery.\nEdgeworth:\nUpon seeing that, the defendant retracted his statement and admitted to the murder. \"I did it because I was told to... ...by the real Yatagarasu, Byrne Faraday.\"\nManfred:\n...Hmm. That sounds about right. However, you've forgotten one thing.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nManfred:\nWhile this may appear to simply be the murder of a Cohdopian Embassy staff member... ...people are actually referring to it as the second KG-8 Incident.\nEdgeworth:\nThe second KG-8 Incident...? I'm very sorry, sir. I fear I've failed to study hard enough.\nManfred:\n...Hmph. Well, even among the police, it's information that only a select few are privy to.\nEdgeworth:\nCould you please enlighten me, sir?\n\n\n\n\n\"2nd KG-8 Incident\" (appears after \"Today's trial\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSir... What do you mean by \"the second KG-8 Incident\"?\nManfred:\nIn order for me to tell you that, you must first learn about the original case. Take a look at these documents.\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a... three-year-old newspaper.\nKG-8 Incident Overview data jotted down in my Organizer.\nManfred:\nYou have heard of the Amano Group scandal before, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I have. The secretary of Ernest Amano, the Amano Group's director, was arrested... ...under suspicion of smuggling.\nManfred:\nCorrect. Cece Yew was an employee of the Amano Group... ...and the sole witness to the smuggling operation. It was she who brought the crime to light. However, Ms. Yew was silenced before she could testify in court.\nEdgeworth:\nWasn't a Cohdopian Embassy staff member arrested for the murder?\nManfred:\nYes... A Cohdopian by the name of Manny Coachen was the suspect. However, due to lack of evidence, the case went unresolved.\nEdgeworth:\n...Lack of evidence!?\nManfred:\nHah! If only I was [sic] in charge of the case. I would have done everything in my power to prove his guilt!\nEdgeworth:\n(To make sure that all criminals are found guilty... My mentor really is dedicated.)\nManfred:\nFaraday was the prosecutor on the case then, and he was as pathetic as ever.\nEdgeworth:\n...! Mr. Faraday was in charge of the KG-8 Incident as well?\nManfred:\nThat's right. And now, once again, the victim of the case you are currently assigned to... ...was someone who was scheduled to testify against that smuggling organization.\nEdgeworth:\n...And just like last time, the victim was murdered right before he was to testify.\nManfred:\nYou're catching on. The victim was murdered just before his day in court against the smuggling organization. Events are occurring almost exactly the same way as they did in the KG-8 incident.\nEdgeworth:\nSo that's why it is being called the second KG-8 Incident?\nManfred:\nYes... Yet, there is one difference between the two incidents.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat would that be...?\nManfred:\nThe so-called noble thief that is sending everyone into an uproar... The Great Thief \"Yatagarasu\".\nEdgeworth:\n(Yatagarasu...? I'd better find out more.)\n\n\n\n\n\"2nd KG-8 Incident\" (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSir...

I'd better find out more.)\n\n\n\n\nYatagarasu (appears after \"'2nd KG-8 Incident'\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"If it is true that the Yatagarasu showed up at the Cohdopian Embassy...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt is thanks to you that I have finally become a prosecutor, sir.\nManfred:\nIt's amusing that you wanted to become a defense attorney, yet became my student. Hmph... It is a strange path you have traveled.\nEdgeworth:\nIt's true that I had once wanted to become a defense attorney... But now, I am honored and proud to be a prosecutor.\nManfred:\nI see. Then as a student of mine, I suggest you remember this well: The Prosecutor's Badge... is not to be flaunted! The dignity of a prosecutor lies in the man himself, not in the badge.\nEdgeworth:\nI understand... I will keep that in mind.\nManfred:\nBesides, why put holes in your fine garments? It's simply preposterous!\nEdgeworth:\nProsecutors must also take pride in their appearance... I will keep this in mind as well.\nManfred:\nI'm constantly having to remind the others at the Prosecutor's Office of this... \"It's more fashionable to keep your Prosecutor's Badge in your pocket!\"\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words, always treat a Prosecutor's Badge with care and honor? I understand, sir.\n\n\n\n\nKG-8 Incident Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAbout the KG-8 Incident... The trial came to a proper conclusion, did it not?\nManfred:\nHah! I'd hardly call the defendant being found innocent a \"proper\" conclusion! If I had been on the case, no one would have a single doubt about his guilt!\nEdgeworth:\nBut, wasn't there a lack of evidence to prove that Mr. Coachen was guilty...?\nManfred:\n...A lack of evidence? Hah! There is no such thing.\nEdgeworth:\n(That's just like him to be able to prove a man guilty, even when the evidence is lacking!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMan by water fountain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMan:\nTh-This is so good! *gulp, gulp, gulp* I could drink a whole gallon!\nEdgeworth:\n(I've never heard of water that tastes THAT good...) ..................

It would be quite atypical to provide hors d'oeuvres here!\nOld Lady:\nAre you sure? Someone poured me a fresh cup of coffee last time I was here.\nEdgeworth:\n(What the heck does she think a courthouse is for!?)\n\n\n\n\nBailiff in middle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBailiff:\nMr. Prosecutor, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nYou've got a good eye if you can tell that I'm a prosecutor with just one glance.\nBailiff:\nAs there are always only prosecutors and defense attorneys in this lobby... I usually hit the mark if I guess one or the other while there is a recess.\nEdgeworth:\n(You were only guessing!?)\n\n\n\n\nMan with child\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFather:\nAren't these great? Daddy made all of these.\nBoy:\nAwesome! But didn't you get fired right after you made them?\nFather:\nAh, yeah I did... I spent the same amount of money on this model as it cost to build the real thing. And my boss wasn't very happy with me. Haha.\nBoy:\nHey, Daddy. Didn't you say you built a secret mechanism inside of it?\nFather:\nHahaha. I'll tell you about it someday when you're older.\nEdgeworth:\n(A secret mechanism...? Maybe he installed it as payback for getting fired? It could be trouble... ......Now I'm curious.)\n\n\n\n\nBailiff above right door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Egad...!

You are a man of wisdom and experience, sir.\n\n\n\n\nBulletin board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(A bulletin board... There are trial schedules posted on it. Trials scheduled for this week... Huh? There's only today's trial listed... This must be a mistake, or this country's judicial system is not working as it should!)\n\n\n\n\nCenter door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(The trial is about to resume. I should stay on the premises.)\n\n\n\n\nCourthouse model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(A model of the courthouse. It's pretty well constructed. Hm...? Hands and a face...? Don't tell me this thing transforms... Yet, I wonder for what other purpose could they have been made...?)\n\n\n\n\nSofa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm. A luxurious and beautiful leather sofa. I must say, every part of this courthouse is meticulously well kept. Although, the positioning of this sofa puts one under the direct gaze of the judges. Every judge in this courthouse's history has had quite the beard... ...and has gallantly parted with their beloved head of hair, I see. Being a judge must be a very stressful career.)\n\n\n\n\nDoor on right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBailiff:\nThe trial will resume shortly. Please wait a moment, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... I was already well aware of that. (Shortly, or in a moment... Which one is it? Be specific!)\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA bookshelf, huh...? (\"Compendium of Laws for Beginners\"... I don't have the time to read this and second-guess myself now!)\nEdgeworth:\nIf it is true that the Yatagarasu showed up at the Cohdopian Embassy... ...what could he or she have been after?\nManfred:\nHmph... No doubt to steal any suspicious accounting records and release them publicly. Or, more likely, to steal secrets from the Cohdopian Embassy itself... ...since the item that the Yatagarasu stole from there was sent to the police.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was it that the Yatagarasu sent to the police?\nManfred:\n...I don't know the details. Anything related to the Yatagarasu is getting the top-secret treatment. Still, I find it very ironic. By returning the stolen item to the police, it was proof positive that the Yatagarasu... ...had infiltrated the embassy on the same day the staff member was killed. Criminals have a way of incriminating themselves, wouldn't you say?\nEdgeworth:\nThat would have to be the first time the Yatagarasu has left evidence behind, correct?\nManfred:\nYes, indeed. If you wish to learn more about the Yatagarasu, then I suggest you ask Faraday.\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Faraday...?\nManfred:\nHe happens to be the prosecutor in charge of the Yatagarasu case, as well.\nEdgeworth:\n(He's the prosecutor in charge of both the KG-8 Incident and the Yatagarasu case? Mr. Faraday really has a lot on his plate...)\nManfred:\n...What is it, little girl?\n???:\n......... ...You're scary, mister.\nManfred:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nDid you need something?\n???:\nUmm... I want to trade these coins with you!\nEdgeworth:\nA fistful of dimes, quarters, and pennies... but it looks like you've exactly a dollar. Is this what you want?\n???:\nThanks! That's exactly what I needed!\nEdgeworth:\nCould that child be here to watch the trial?\nManfred:\nHow disrespectful for a child like that to be running around inside the courthouse! Does no one have respect for this country's judicial system anymore!?\nBailiff:\nThe paperwork for the prosecutor substitution is complete!\nManfred:\nWhy you! Do you even know how much time there is left before the trial resumes!?\nBailiff:\nI... I-I'm so sorry!\nManfred:\nI can have you mopping up this courthouse instead of protecting it in an instant!\nBailiff:\n! *gulp*\nEdgeworth:\nIt's no bother, sir. Not being completely prepared could prove to be a perfect handicap for me.\nManfred:\nHmph. A proud one you are. You had better collect the evidence from Faraday and prepare yourself. It's time for your debut, Edgeworth!\nSeptember 10, 4:00 PM\nDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 3\nManfred:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nManfred:\nJust what is going on!? Why isn't Faraday here yet!? How is it possible that the defense is not prepared yet, either!?\nEdgeworth:\nBailiff... Where is Mr. Faraday?\nBailiff:\nI-I'm not sure... I wasn't really paying attention...\nJudge:\nAh, you must be the one Mr. von Karma recommended... I hear this will be your first trial. I look forward to seeing how you perform. Oh, by the way, was there someone celebrating a birthday during the recess? I could have sworn that I heard a popper going off... Come to think of it... The other day with my grandson...\nEdgeworth:\nSir, it looks like the trial is about to resume, however...\nManfred:\n...Yes, it will be all but impossible to prove the witness a liar... ...without the evidence from Faraday! What is that blasted buffoon up to!?\n???:\nI-I-It's an emergency, siiiiiirs!\nJudge:\nS-Silence!\nManfred:\nThere shall be no yelling in this sacred hall of law! Bailiff! Remove that man from this courtroom at once!\n???:\nP-Please... wait! You have to listen to me! There's an emergency! Defendant Lobby No. 2...! M-Mr. Faraday and the defendant... Th-The two of them... They're... They're both dead, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWh--!?\nManfred:\nWh--!?\nEdgeworth:\nWh--!? Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nSeptember 10\nDistrict Court - Hallway\n???:\nStay back!\nEdgeworth:\nUngh...!\n???:\n...No one's allowed on the crime scene... Period.\nEdgeworth:\n(Just who does this... oddball think he is...?)\n???:\nThis is becoming quite the hotspot...\nEdgeworth:\n(Isn't she Mr. Rell's defense attorney...?)\n???:\nH-Hey, you! No running in the hallway, pal!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd who are you to tell me what to do? (I'll never find out what's going on like this. It's time for some civil discourse.)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me, but... who are you?\nBadd:\n...Detective Tyrell Badd. ...Homicide.\nEdgeworth:\nI was informed of the situation and came as quickly as possible... ...so how did you arrive and inspect the body before me?\nBadd:\n...Faraday requested for me to testify in the trial... Plain and simple.\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Faraday requested that you be here...?\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\nI've already contacted HQ about the situation. I've... got nothing to say to you... kid.\nEdgeworth:\n(K-Kid!?) I'm Mr. Faraday's substitute in today's trial. Therefore, I insist that you update me on the situation!\nBadd:\n............\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't back down here. I have a right to know.)\nBadd:\n...Do I need to teach you a thing or two about how to talk to adults, kid!?\nEdgeworth:\n! (Is he threatening me? I-Is he going for his gun!? I-It's just a mirror... How dare he trick me like that!?)\nBadd:\n...Faraday was stabbed to death with some kind of blade. And he had a gun in his hand. The other man, a Mr. Mack Rell, was shot and killed. He was found holding a bloody knife in his hand.\nEdgeworth:\nWas there anyone else who went into Defendant Lobby No. 2?\nBadd:\nYeah, that big lug over there. His name's Gumshoe. He was in charge of guarding the place... He's claiming that no one else entered the room.\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case, then... they must have killed each other, correct!?\nBadd:\nMaybe...\nEdgeworth:\n(Such impudence! This guy is really testing my patience!)\n\n\n\n\nTrial witness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhy was I not informed that you were going to testify in court?\nBadd:\n...Homicides aren't my only gig; the Yatagarasu case is also one of my assignments.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... So you were called upon to comment on the Yatagarasu's characteristics... ...in order to assess if Mr. Faraday really was the Yatagarasu or not?\nBadd:\nWell, well... Looks like you just might have a brain after all in that head of yours, son.\nEdgeworth:\n(S-Son...!? I'm not your son, \"pops\"!)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\n...Does showing that off make you feel like a big, strong prosecutor?\nEdgeworth:\nO-Of course not! I was simply proving my title of prosecutor to you.\nBadd:\nI see. But most prosecutors don't go around flaunting those things... It's like a detective walking around outside with his badge flashing in the sunlight. ...Show that off too much, and before you know it, you'll be elbow-deep in angry criminals.\nEdgeworth:\nThat would... definitely be a problem.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Badd... I'd like to ask you about this piece of evidence.\nBadd:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\nCould you please pay attention?\nBadd:\nHeh... I'm listening. But I've got nothing to say... End of story.\nEdgeworth:\n...Very well. (Why didn't you say that in the first place?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefense attorney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have a minute?\n???:\n...You know, I'm not really into talking to people I don't know. Especially at a time like this.\nEdgeworth:\nAh. I apologize for not introducing myself before bothering you. My name is Miles Edgeworth. I was to take Mr. Faraday's place in court.\n???:\nEdgeworth, huh...? Never heard of you. So Faraday's substitute is a newbie, huh?\nEdgeworth:\nI'll have you know, madam, that I studied under Manfred von Karma. Do not take me for some naïve novice.\n???:\n..................Phwwh!\nEdgeworth:\n...?\n???:\n...Mu...Phwwh. \"Do not take me for some naïve novice\"...!? Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha! So, you're a student of Von Karma! I should have... Phwwh...! Those clothes are a dead giveaway!\nEdgeworth:\nS-Stop right there! These are the garments of one who gallantly presents the facts...\n???:\nPhwwh... Ah, thanks for the great laugh, but try not to make me laugh so much, OK?\nEdgeworth:\nI wasn't trying to do anything of the sort!\n???:\nAhaha! Just kidding! I was just goofing around! By the way, do you know who I am? My name is Calisto Yew. And if you're telling the truth... then we were about to go head-to-head in court.\nEdgeworth:\nAh, but of course! I have heard much about you, Ms. Yew.\nYew:\nPhwwh...! \"Ah, but of course! I have heard much about you\"... You're a regular Shakespeare!\nEdgeworth:\n(Did I say something funny...?)\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI'd like you to update me on the situation.\nYew:\nI don't really know anything. ...Why don't you try talking to those detectives over there?\nEdgeworth:\nIf that's the case, then why are you here?\nYew:\nPhwwh............ Ahahahahahaha!\nEdgeworth:\nUrgh! What's so funny!\nYew:\nIt's just that the way you speak is so tactless! The person I was going against in court, until only a little while ago, was just murdered. It's not like I could go back into the courtroom pretending as though nothing happened.\nEdgeworth:\n! ......That's a good point. I apologize for asking such an insensitive question.\nYew:\n...It's fine. Don't worry about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt is a shame that we will not be able to face each other. It was to be my first trial, too.\nYew:\nOh, was that a declaration of war? How nice it is to be young and carefree. And what a nice squeaky clean badge you've got yourself there. I'm jealous!\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sure its gleam will dull over time with experience.\nYew:\nPhwwh... Are you saying your reputation will also tarnish over time with it?\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...! That's not what I meant!\nYew:\nPhwwh! Well, you just can't avoid some things in life.\nEdgeworth:\n(I'll never allow my badge or my reputation to become tarnished.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Yew... What do you think about this piece of evidence?\nYew:\nActually Edgeworth, I'm interested in finding out what you think about it.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I don't really know all that much about it.\nYew:\nHmm... Then, I don't really know all that much about it, either.\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nYew:\n...Phwwh! Ahahahahahaha! Sorry! Guess I can't be of any service!\nEdgeworth:\n(I shouldn't push her too much... She'll just start laughing again.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAnd you are...?\n???:\n...Who, me? Hey, pal... ...it's common courtesy to tell someone your name first before asking their's!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...! Point taken. My name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a district prosecutor.\n???:\nA prosecutor? I've never seen a prosecutor as young as you, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n...I've told you my name. Now would you mind telling me yours?\nGumshoe:\nDetective Dick Gumshoe! And just recently, I achieved my dream of becoming a detective! More than a dream... It's what I was born to do! Wait... Maybe I should check and make sure I'm not really in some crazy dream first...\nEdgeworth:\n(This detective is entirely too excited to be at a murder scene...)\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo Detective Gumshoe... Would you mind telling me what you know about the incident?\nGumshoe:\nYou know that I don't have to tell you anything, right?\nEdgeworth:\nI know that. But it would behoove you to fill me in on what you know.\nGumshoe:\n...Wow, you're a proud one for such a youngster, aren't you? Well, anyway, Detective Badd is the one in charge... ...so you're just gonna have to ask him for all the details, OK? As for me, I was guarding the door to Defendant Lobby No. 2.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... So you were on (changed from [the] in the original release) guard detail... Did you notice anything strange while you were on duty?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I freaked out when I heard a gunshot, and then I kinda froze.\nEdgeworth:\n(You're a detective and a measly gunshot scared you that much? ......Then again, I can hardly claim to not know what it's like to hear one at close range...)\nGumshoe:\nThen, Detective Badd came running to the scene. We went into Lobby No. 2 together, and both men were lying there, dead.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that everything?\nGumshoe:\nHmm......... Yeah, that's it. I was in the hallway the whole time, but I didn't hear a single peep of a struggle.\nEdgeworth:\n(Interesting... Other than the gunshot, he didn't hear a single sound of commotion.)\nDet. Gumshoe's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nCrime scene (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo Detective Gumshoe... Would you mind telling me what you know about the incident?\nGumshoe:\nYou know that I don't have to tell you anything, right?\nEdgeworth:\nI know that. But it would behoove you to fill me in on what you know.\nGumshoe:\n...Wow, you're a proud one for such a youngster, aren't you? Well, anyway, Detective Badd is the one in charge... ...so you're just gonna have to ask him for all the details, OK? As for me, I was guarding the door to Defendant Lobby No. 2.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... So you were on (changed from [the] in the original release) guard detail...

We went into Lobby No. 2 together, and both men were lying there, dead.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that everything?\nGumshoe:\nHmm......... Yeah, that's it. I was in the hallway the whole time, but I didn't hear a single peep of a struggle.\nEdgeworth:\n(Interesting... Other than the gunshot, he didn't hear a single sound of commotion.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou mentioned that you've only recently become a detective, did you not?\nGumshoe:\nYou got it! I'm a brand spankin' new detective!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... So that means you've probably never seen a real Prosecutor's Badge, right? If you so desired to see one, I just might be able to make your day.\nGumshoe:\nYou don't have to go through the trouble, pal, because a real man has a police badge! And someday, I'm gonna become an Ace Detective, just like Detective Badd!\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Did I say something wrong, pal?\nEdgeworth:\n......... ...Forget it, Detective.\n\n\n\n\nDet. Gumshoe's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you were guarding the door to Lobby No. 2 at the time of the crime, correct?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right! And I'll have you know, not even a single ant got by me!\nEdgeworth:\nReally? Are you sure that not even a single ant slipped in?\nGumshoe:\nWell, umm... I-I guess if we're talking about \"slipped in\", then maybe a frog or something did!\nEdgeworth:\n...It would appear that my point also completely slipped by you, Detective.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any insight on this, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHmm, well... As a detective I'd rather see something that is actually related to the case, pal!\nEdgeworth:\n(And here I thought this was related enough...)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSofa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(This sofa looks like it's seen its fair share of use. And it looks like another part of the courthouse is visible from the window... Ack! My eyes have locked with my reflection's eyes in the barred window! As a student of Von Karma, I refuse to back down!) ..................I won.\n\n\n\n\nOrange vending machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Interesting. They're selling special court-themed food products here. Many of them seem sort of troublesome and suspicious. Objection...! I suppose.)\n\n\n\n\nBlue vending machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, a drink vending machine. .................. Ack! (Now is not the time to be pondering what kind of drink I want!)\n\n\n\n\nCenter door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Defendant Lobby No. 1 is through here. The incident took place in Lobby No. 2 next door... I shouldn't allow myself to be sidetracked like this. I'd better get a move on.)\n\n\n\n\nPoster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(A poster of the Judge. There's a longer slogan of some sort on it in tiny letters at the bottom (changed from [slogan of some sort on it] in the original release)... ) \"Every strike of my gavel brings the truth closer to me, and my hair farther away.\" .................. (Is this a promotional poster for the court or a hair growth product...?)\n\n\n\n\nFire extinguisher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(A fire extinguisher... If one were to be hit in the head with this... ...I suppose the victim would lose a memory or two. But it's not as though I'D ever be so foolish as to be struck by one of these.)\n\n\n\n\nRight door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(First, I need to get a handle on the situation. Perhaps, I should talk to some people.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options with Tyrell Badd, Calisto Yew, and Dick Gumshoe:\nBailiff:\nMs. Yew! There is someone here who wishes to see you...\nYew:\n......Who is it?\nBailiff:\nA Cohdopian Embassy staff member by the name of Manny Coachen.\nYew:\nWh--!\nBadd:\n.........!\nEdgeworth:\n(What's going on? Detective Badd and Ms. Yew's moods just changed all of a sudden. Wait a second... Wasn't Manny Coachen...!?)\nYew:\nI'll be right there.\nCoachen:\nIt's nice to see you again... Ms. Yew.\nYew:\nWhy are you here? I have no desire to ever see you again.\nCoachen:\nNow, now... Actually, would you mind stepping outside for a brief chat?\nYew:\n........Fine. Let's go.\nManfred:\n...Badd.\nBadd:\nVon Karma...? It's been a long time.\nManfred:\nI knew you would show up. You usually do when the Yatagarasu is involved, and I see this case is no exception.\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know Detective Badd, sir?\nManfred:\nYes. He's like an old bloodhound that never leaves the scene of a crime. If only he would get a promotion and move on.\nBadd:\nIt's the crime scene where a detective is most useful and effective.\nManfred:\nHmph! It's not like I don't know that. Moving on though, Badd. The man that I just passed by... ...was he not the suspect from the KG-8 Incident!?\nEdgeworth:\n(So I was right...!)\nManfred:\nJust what is that man doing, wandering around here!? That Faraday... I can't believe he let such an easy catch get away! Imbecile! I would've proved his guilt in three minutes!\nBadd:\nVon Karma! ...I think you've said enough for now. It's in poor taste to speak like that about the departed.\nManfred:\nHmph... Very well. Back on topic... I'm placing Edgeworth in charge of the investigation here...\n???:\n???:\nPapa! How can you place him in charge!?\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska... What are you doing here?\nFranziska:\nI'm here for summer vacation, what else?\nEdgeworth:\n(Franziska von Karma... So she is here on vacation from Germany... She is the daughter of Manfred von Karma and a student of his, who's also junior to me.)\nFranziska:\nYou're the one who's junior to me! And don't you forget it!\nEdgeworth:\nYou're not conveniently avoiding the Bar Examination, are you?\nFranziska:\nHah... If you were able to pass, then I'll have absolutely no trouble at all. I'll never allow myself to lose to you! Never!\nEdgeworth:\n(Why does she always have to be this competitive...?)\nFranziska:\nAnyway... Papa... Are you really assigning Miles Edgeworth to cover the case?\nManfred:\nYes, I am. Why do you ask?\nFranziska:\nWell, you know... I'm close to becoming a prosecutor myself... And I am 100% confident that I can do a better job than him!\nEdgeworth:\n(That's just like Franziska. She has no problem bad-mouthing someone right in front of them.)\nManfred:\n...Badd.\nBadd:\nYeah...?\nManfred:\nThese two will be conducting the investigation.\nBadd:\nWhat? You want me to let both of these kids loose on the crime scene?\nManfred:\nHah. This is a perfect opportunity for them to work on their prosecutorial skills.\nBadd:\nA crime scene is not a place for children to be messing around in!\nManfred:\nI'm the one with the authority over this crime scene, Badd. ...And I will not tolerate complaining.\nBadd:\n...Knngh...!\nManfred:\nEdgeworth! Franziska! I leave this case to the two of you.\nEdgeworth:\nUnderstood, sir.\nFranziska:\nYes, Papa.\nManfred:\nI'll go take care of the paperwork now. Remember, I'll accept nothing but a perfect report from the both of you. Do not disappoint me.\nBadd:\nHold up, Von Karma.........! I still... haven't agreed to this!\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth...!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's been quite some time, Franziska.\nFranziska:\nThis will be the perfect chance for us... ...to see which of us is truly worthy of the Von Karma name.\nEdgeworth:\nWould it kill you to at least say hello?\nFranziska:\nUnngh... Umm... Long time no see.\nEdgeworth:\nVery good.\nFranziska:\nJust because you became a prosecutor first doesn't mean you can act all proud!\nEdgeworth:\n(S-She hasn't changed a bit...)\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth! As I was saying, we shall see which one of us is worthy of the Von Karma name...\nBadd:\nFor cryin' out loud... I've been reduced to a babysitter...\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like Mr. von Karma was successful in convincing the detective. That's just like him; he never fails.) Now, I'd appreciate it if you could quickly run me through the facts, Detective Badd.\nBadd:\nYou're better off checking things out on your own.\nEdgeworth:\n...Very well. (Seems like getting help from Detective Badd will be a most arduous task...)\nSeptember 10, 4:15 PM\nDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 2\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... Is the only real explanation that they killed each other simultaneously...?)\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth! You should listen to someone until they are finished talking!\nEdgeworth:\nUmm... What are you talking about?\nFranziska:\nI'll only say it one more time... This is a competition to see who is truly worthy of the Von Karma name!\nEdgeworth:\nA competition...?\nFranziska:\nThe person that figures out the truth first wins.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... So the person who doesn't discover the truth is a dishonor to the name?\nFranziska:\nExactly! I don't care that you became a prosecutor before me... ...I simply refuse to hear any more foolish things come from your foolishly, foolish mouth.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Fine, whatever makes you happy.\nFranziska:\nCan I take that as you accepting my challenge?\nEdgeworth:\nOnce again... Whatever makes you happy.\nFranziska:\nHah... Well then, let's begin the investigation, shall we? I'm going to find the perfect evidence and prettily present it like the professional I am.\nEdgeworth:\n(Competing to discover the truth behind a crime -- how delightfully... childish.)\nBadd:\nYou kids, over there! Hold it!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Kid\"!?\nFranziska:\nHa! Serves you right, Miles. He just called you a kid...!\nBadd:\n...I said \"kids\", kid.\nFranziska:\nH-How dare you call me a kid as well!?\nBadd:\nI'll do what I please. And I won't allow you to cause a ruckus on my crime scene. Hey, big guy. You're... going to watch over these two.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir! Detective Badd, sir! Now, do what I say from now on kids, OK!?\nFranziska:\nYou'd better not get in our way, Scruffy! You'll feel the bite of my whip if you do!\nGumshoe:\nE-Eeek! Th-Then you, p-prosecutor boy! Let's get your investigation started already, alright!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Great. Now, even THAT detective is treating me like a child...)\nGumshoe:\nAlright! It's time to get investigating! Get a move on, prosecutor boy!\nEdgeworth:\n...My name is Miles Edgeworth. And if you were [sic] to call me \"prosecutor boy\" one more time... ...it will be my duty as a prosecutor to \"look into\" your monthly salary.\nGumshoe:\nWh-What!? And what would you do with my salary after you saw how much it was!?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's up to you now, isn't it?\nGumshoe:\nReally!? Sounds good, pal!\nEdgeworth:\n(He's so naïve...)\nBegin Investigation\nDefendant Lobby No. 2\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Badd, may I have a word with you?\nBadd:\n...What is it?\nEdgeworth:\nIt appears that both a knife and a gun were used as murder weapons.\nBadd:\n...Yeah, it does.\nEdgeworth:\nThat leads us to our first question of the investigation. Where did the men acquire the weapons?\nBadd:\n...The gun was inside of Faraday's bag. It was a piece of evidence that was presented in the trial earlier today. It was used... to kill the Cohdopian Embassy staff member. But... I never heard anything about the knife. Mr. Rell was being held by the police. There's no way he could have brought it in. Which means it's possible that Faraday had the knife on him from the start as well.\nEdgeworth:\n(Could it have been a piece of evidence that had yet to be presented...? But then, why doesn't Detective Badd know about it? Wait! What if...!?) It's possible that Mr. Faraday brought the knife in under the guise of prosecutorial evidence. He could have then brought it out and attacked Mr. Rell with it.\nBadd:\nHuh... Maybe you've got a brain in there after all, kid.\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...! (Is he going to treat me like a child forever!?)\nBadd:\n...It looks like Mr. Faraday attacked Mr. Rell first, who then counterattacked... That's the only logical conclusion you can draw from a scene like this.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... Not yet. I feel that it's much too early to be drawing conclusions already. I must first find conclusive evidence, so as to protect (changed from [ensure] in the original release) the honor of the Von Karma name.)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska von Karma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nAhh... I see.\nEdgeworth:\nDid you figure something out?\nFranziska:\nThis is a competition, Miles! And as such, I'd appreciate it if you didn't talk to me!\nEdgeworth:\n*sigh* As you wish.\n\n\n\n\nTyrell Badd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Badd, do you have any thoughts on the case?\nBadd:\nFaraday and Rell... It looks like they killed each other to me... Although... there are a few things that just don't seem right.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... And what would they be?\nBadd:\nHmph...... Why don't you try thinking on your own first before you bother me, boy?\nEdgeworth:\n(Wh--!? Now I've been downgraded to just \"boy\"!?)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis decorative plant's foliage is quite nice. It's actually soothing to be around it. Hmm... Perhaps I should purchase one for my room.\n\n\n\n\nSofa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like this sofa is ready to be disposed of...)\nGumshoe:\nIt's so soft! I could sleep for all 25 hours of the day on this thing!\nEdgeworth:\n.................. (If only I could dispose of him...)\n\n\n\n\nPlastic bags on ground\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHm...? Why are there plastic bags scattered all around?\nGumshoe:\nThose bags are for keeping evidence safe, pal.\nEdgeworth:\nI know that much, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nYou sure are good at this stuff, aren't you, pal!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Normally, I'd be happy when someone compliments me, but when it's this guy... Anyway, could these plastic bags be evidence of a fight (Plastic bags strewn about - Plastic bags used to store evidence are strewn all over the floor.) between the two men?)\n\n\n\n\nBodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(It looks like Mr. Faraday fell on top of Mr. Rell. At first glance, it seems like they must have killed each other, however...)\nGumshoe:\nUsing logic, the only logical conclusion is... Aha!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What was that outburst for!?\nGumshoe:\nMy detective's instinct just hit me real hard! It was Mr. Rell that fell first, see!\nEdgeworth:\nYou don't need a detective's instinct for that! It's common sense!! (But I suppose we won't know much more than that until after I examine the bodies. I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nGun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLooks like Mr. Faraday died while holding the gun in his right hand...\nEdgeworth:\nSo he shot Mr. Rell, and then fell on top of him while still gripping onto the gun...?\nGumshoe:\n...I guess that does seem kinda strange, huh? I mean, why would Mr. Faraday know how to fire a gun!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's not exactly rocket science; even I know how to pull a trigger. ...Although I doubt I'll ever need to use one.\nGumshoe:\nI hope I never have to fire a gun, either, pal. But it sure does look cool to hold a gun in your hands!\nEdgeworth:\n(It appears that the police's screening procedures need a thorough review... Anyway, I should jot down some notes about the handgun in Mr. Faraday's hand.)\nHandgun data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nGun (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLooks like Mr. Faraday died while holding the gun in his right hand...\nEdgeworth:\nSo he shot Mr. Rell, and then fell on top of him while still gripping onto the gun...?\nGumshoe:\n...I guess that does seem kinda strange, huh?

But it sure does look cool to hold a gun in your hands!\nEdgeworth:\n(It appears that the police's screening procedures need a thorough review... Anyway, I should jot down some notes about the handgun in Mr. Faraday's hand.)\n\n\n\n\nByrne Faraday's head\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Faraday... How ironic it is for him to lose his life in a courthouse.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, why did it have to be like this? I don't know what to say... I can't believe this happened while I was on watch, pal!\nEdgeworth:\nRather than beating yourself up, you should spend your time continuing the investigation. Didn't you become a detective in order to solve crimes?\nGumshoe:\n...Yeah.\nEdgeworth:\nThen get back to work. Find out the cause of his murder!\nGumshoe:\nR-Right! I'm on it, pal!\n\n\n\n\nMack Rell's head\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nFirst he killed a Cohdopian Embassy staff member, then he was murdered himself.\nGumshoe:\nThis guy... wasn't exactly an angel, you know.\nEdgeworth:\nOh? What makes you say that?\nGumshoe:\nWell, he's been hauled in to the precinct several times for theft and assault, pal. So yeah, he's definitely the type to have committed a murder or two.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, he did admit to killing Mr. Deid Mann.\nGumshoe:\nHey! Good point, pal! I knew my detective's intuition was telling me something!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective's intuition...?\nGumshoe:\nYup! Do you know about it? It's a special feeling that all detec--\nEdgeworth:\nWe don't have time for this conversation right now. Let's return to the investigation.\n\n\n\n\nBloody plastic bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHm...? Why are there plastic bags scattered all around?\nGumshoe:\nThose bags are for keeping evidence safe, pal.\nEdgeworth:\nI know that much, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nYou sure are good at this stuff, aren't you, pal!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Normally, I'd be happy when someone compliments me, but when it's this guy... Anyway, could these plastic bags be evidence of a fight (Plastic bags strewn about - Plastic bags used to store evidence are strewn all over the floor.) between the two men?)\n\n\n\n\nByrne Faraday's left hand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHis hand is all black down here, see? ...I wonder what it could be?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... If you look closely... ...this blotching pattern resembles an ink stain (Ink stain - Mr. Faraday has ink on his left hand. Why is there ink on such a place anyway?).\nGumshoe:\nAn... ink stain?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. I usually get ink on my own hand when I use my feather pen.\nGumshoe:\nA feather pen...? I've never seen one before. Sure you aren't just making it up, pal?\n\n\n\n\nKnife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLooks like Mr. Rell died with the knife in his hand.\nEdgeworth:\nThere's some blood stuck on it.\nGumshoe:\nThen, he must've used this as a weapon. Yup, no doubt about it!\nEdgeworth:\n(Was Mr. Faraday carrying this on his personage...? Did he bring this as a piece of evidence for the trial? Or... did he bring it with a very different intention in mind...? I should jot some notes down about it.)\nKnife data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nKnife (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nLooks like Mr. Rell died with the knife in his hand.\nEdgeworth:\nThere's some blood stuck on it.\nGumshoe:\nThen, he must've used this as a weapon. Yup, no doubt about it!\nEdgeworth:\n(Was Mr. Faraday carrying this on his personage...? Did he bring this as a piece of evidence for the trial? Or... did he bring it with a very different intention in mind...? I should jot some notes down about it.)\n\n\n\n\n\nBodies (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nTea set, plastic bags on table, or chairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere are some plastic bags stacked up on the table. There's a tea set, too... but there doesn't seem to be any sign of a disturbance.\nGumshoe:\nYeah... The table's all neat and tidy (Neat and tidy table - The tea set and plastic bags on top of the table are completely undisturbed.). Maybe... they were super quiet in their scuffle!? After all, I didn't hear anything from out in the hallway, you know?\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe the plastic bags scattered on the floor are throwing us off?\n\n\n\n\nBag on table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's some stuff in the bag, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n(I suppose this was Mr. Faraday's bag...) It's probably the trial evidence I was supposed to collect from him.\nGumshoe:\nTh-This is the evidence!? Ah! I'd better not touch it! I'll leave prints on it!\nEdgeworth:\n(Do you just not pay attention to anything you do?)\n\n\n\n\nOpen window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe window is open, and... heh, there's a fresh, flowery scent in the air.\nGumshoe:\nUgh! The flowers in the garden down there are so gross and ghastly!\nEdgeworth:\n(......Do you think maybe you could try offering something useful for a change?)\nGumshoe:\nWell, at least there's no way someone escaped through this window, pal! They wouldn't wake up and smell the flowers after a fall from the third floor.\nEdgeworth:\n...Are you willfully ignoring the fact that there are also iron bars on the windows (Lobby No. 2 window - No human can climb through these barred windows. The scent of flowers is in the air.)?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, I guess there's that, too. Either way, no one could get through these windows, right?\nEdgeworth:\n(They thought of everything when they were designing this courthouse. Very nice.)\n\n\n\n\nTV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWhoooaaa!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What is it. Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nMy TV at home is so tiny compared to this one, pal!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Then perhaps you should purchase a more normal-sized television like this one!)\nGumshoe:\nOoh, let me see here... Wow! This thing is huge! Uwaah! And way too noisy!\nFranziska:\nYou're the noisy one, Scruffy!\nBadd:\nDon't touch it! You'll get your fingerprints all over it.\nGumshoe:\nB-But...! I didn't touch it...\nBadd:\nPreservation of the crime scene is the foundation of detective work!\nEdgeworth:\n(The foundation, huh...? Sounds like something the rookie here needs to shore up on.)\n\n\n\n\nTV (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe TV has been left on...\nGumshoe:\nWhy are you looking at me like that!? It wasn't me! I didn't touch anything!\nBadd:\nGumshoe... you do know what will happen to you if you touch something again... Right?\nGumshoe:\nI won't touch anything! I won't even go anywhere near the TV, sir! A-And you! Get back to your investigation, alright!?\nEdgeworth:\nI was planning to do so anyway.\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal?\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout investigating (changed from [The investigation] in the original release)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI-I'm so excited, pal! This is my first real crime scene! Let's get investigating!\nEdgeworth:\nUmm... Detective Gumshoe... I thought investigations were supposed to be conducted in a calm, collected manner.\nGumshoe:\nHmph! What do you know about running (changed from [how to run] in the original release) an investigation, little boy prosecutor?\nEdgeworth:\nI know that at the very least, I have greater grasp than you of what happened here.\nGumshoe:\nWhy you! You don't know any more than me, pal! Look, you just stay behind me, boy, and out of the way!\nEdgeworth:\n(Ironic coming from the guy that's been a step behind me the entire case...)\n\n\n\n\nNotice anything?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis is my first time setting foot inside the courthouse! Who would've thought it'd be for my first case as a detective? But you know... I get the feeling I'll be coming here a lot more in the future!\nEdgeworth:\n...As a suspect, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nOf course not, pal! Anyway, this lobby's actually pretty luxurious. I mean, for a defendant's lobby, it's got a pretty big TV... Oh! And there's that tea set on the table over there! Bet you didn't know that I like to drink tea... Wow, this room really is decked out. If it means spending time in here, maybe being a suspect isn't such a bad thing after all!\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm beginning to suspect that leaving this detective in charge of anything might be bad... But he is right; this room is rather well furnished. And somewhere in this room, the truth is slumbering. It's time to find it, and give it a wake-up call!)\n\n\n\n\nThe murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo... Detective Gumshoe.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, what is it, boy?\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr! Of all the people to call me that, this detective is by far the least qualified!) ...I wanted to ask you about how the investigation is proceeding.\nGumshoe:\n......See for yourself... pal. Ho ho! Do I do a great Detective Badd or what!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Has this man not a professional bone in his body!?) Nngh... Very well, then I will inspect the victims' bodies myself.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey, so that's a prosecutor's badge, huh?\nEdgeworth:\nYou mentioned that you've only recently become a detective, did you not?\nGumshoe:\nYou got it! I'm a brand spankin' new detective!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... So that means you've probably never seen a real Prosecutor's Badge, right? If you so happened to want to take a look, I just might be able to make your day.\nGumshoe:\nYou don't have to go through the trouble, pal, because a real man has a police badge! And someday, I'm gonna become an Ace Detective, just like Detective Badd!\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Did I say something wrong, pal?\nEdgeworth:\n.........Let's return to the investigation, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nDet. Gumshoe's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat's the whole truth there, pal. I swear!\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you were guarding the door to Lobby No. 2 at the time of the crime, correct?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's right! And I'll have you know, not even a single ant got by me!\nEdgeworth:\nReally? Are you sure that not even a single ant slipped in?\nGumshoe:\nWell, umm... Guess if we're talking about \"slipped in\", then maybe a frog or something did!\nEdgeworth:\n...It would appear that my point also completely slipped you by, Detective.\n\n\n\n\nHandgun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nEeeek! Hey, pal! I'd appreciate it if you didn't point that thing at me, OK!?\nEdgeworth:\nDon't get cheeky with me, Detective! I simply wished to show it to you.\nGumshoe:\nAnd? You got a point in showing it to me!? B-Because I don't even have a single penny on me, so you're out of luck, pal!\nEdgeworth:\n(Well THAT was an unusual reaction to being shown a piece of evidence...)\n\n\n\n\nKnife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat knife is one of the murder weapons, right?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it is the weapon that took Mr. Faraday's life.\nGumshoe:\nOoonnnrrrgh... There's blood stuck on the blade, and it's still fresh...\nEdgeworth:\nYou're in the Homicide Division, correct? You'll be seeing a lot more blood. Even if it's not your cup of tea, you might as well get used to it.\nGumshoe:\nRnnngh... But the sight of blood isn't something I want to get used to...\nEdgeworth:\nDon't think of it as seeing blood, but rather, as a representation of the killer. If viewed in that sense, you begin to see how the killer operates.\nGumshoe:\n...You're right, pal! Thanks for the fresh perspective. I feel so much better now!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmph... I'm glad someone does.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any insight on this, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHmm, well... As a detective I'd rather see something that is actually related to the case, pal!\nEdgeworth:\n(And here I thought this was related enough...)\nAfter examining gun, Byrne Faraday's left hand, and knife:\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Rell's cause of death was from being shot, correct?\nGumshoe:\nThat's what we think, but it's hard to tell with him lying face down.\nEdgeworth:\nDeath is bad enough, but it's truly lamentable that someone would try to hide the truth.\nGumshoe:\n...Um, are you sure they were trying to hide something?\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't confirm Mr. Rell's cause of death with his body positioned like that.) Detective Badd, I'd like to examine the bodies in further detail, if possible...\nFranziska:\nWhat's this? You're not able to form a theory with them the way they are?\nEdgeworth:\nI believe an examination of the bodies is vital to finding the perfect evidence, don't you?\nFranziska:\nHmm... I suppose you do have a point. Well!? Hurry up and get on with it!\nBadd:\n...Labbie.\nForensics:\nYes, sir! We've taken enough photos of the scene, sir.\nBadd:\n...And there you have it.\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nBadd:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\nD-Do you not approve?\nBadd:\n...Of course not.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nBadd:\nInvestigation of a crime scene is the work of a detective. So don't touch a thing. Hey, big fella, turn over the bodies for me, will you?\nGumshoe:\nO-OK......... Please forgive me, Mr. Faraday, sir...!\nBadd:\nGumshoe... do not get emotionally involved. Remember, you're a detective!\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir! Understood, sir!\nLeads to examination of bodies\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nMack Rell's wound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nShot in the chest...\nGumshoe:\nIt takes some guts to fire a gun in a courthouse... I mean, I've been a detective for a whole week and I STILL haven't fired a single round yet!\nEdgeworth:\nThere aren't any burn marks on his clothes. That must mean...\nGumshoe:\nWait... Burn marks...?\nEdgeworth:\nA round grows very hot as it is discharged from a firearm. Therefore, burn marks are usually left when a shot is fired from point blank range. Ergo, Mr. Rell must have been shot from at least a yard or two away.\nHandgun data updated in my Organizer.\nGumshoe:\nYou sure do know a buncha neat stuff for your age, pal!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Apparently, this detective has as much common (changed from [comon] in the original release, correcting the typo) knowledge as your everyday marsupial.)\n\n\n\n\nMack Rell's wound (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nShot in the chest...\nGumshoe:\nIt takes some guts to fire a gun in a courthouse... I mean, I've been a detective for a whole week and I STILL haven't fired a single round yet!\nEdgeworth:\nThere aren't any burn marks on his clothes. That must mean...\nGumshoe:\nWait...

It's... a fountain pen (Fountain pen in pocket - The fountain pen in Mr. Faraday's pocket has an especially nice nib.).\nGumshoe:\nHey, you know, I always keep a pencil behind my ear! It's because Detective Badd is always telling me... \"You should always write your name on everything you own!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes... Somehow, you do strike me as quite a forgetful individual.)\n\n\n\n\nByrne Faraday's wound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThere's a knife wound in his chest here, see?\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if the wound matches the knife Mr. Rell is holding?\nBadd:\n...Labbie.\nForensics:\nYes, sir! Verifying now, sir!\nBadd:\n...Make it quick.\nEdgeworth:\n(From the look of things... ...one could deduce that the knife Mr. Rell is holding is what killed Mr. Faraday.)\n\n\n\n\nGun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Faraday is holding a gun in his right hand.\nGumshoe:\nThat's the one Mr. Rell got blown away by, right?\nBadd:\n...Labbie, your answer.\nForensics:\nYes, sir! We've found that the ballistic markings do match that gun.\nGumshoe:\nOh, um... Ballistic markings are, um...\nEdgeworth:\n...Are the figurative fingerprints a gun leaves on a bullet when fired. Every gun leaves its own unique ballistic markings. Therefore, by looking at the markings on a bullet, you can tell which gun it came from.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's it! O-Of course, I already knew all about that, pal!\nBadd:\n.........Maybe you'd be better off going back to the academy.\nGumshoe:\nEeeek! Come on, sir! Cut me some slack, will ya!?\nEdgeworth:\n(So the bullet that was fired from this gun is what felled Mr. Rell...)\n\n\nAfter examining pen in pocket and both wounds:\nEdgeworth:\nLet us now try to understand how the two men died. First, Mr. Faraday took the gun and the knife out from today's trial evidence... ...then he aimed the gun at Mr. Rell and fired. However, Mr. Rell managed to grab the knife and counter Mr. Faraday while being shot. Then, the two men fell together where they stood. ...That is my theory, in any case.\nGumshoe:\nWhat a crazy way to go...\nEdgeworth:\n(Still... something about that explanation just doesn't seem right...)\nCrime Scene Notes jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I believe I now have a firmer grasp on what happened here.\n\n\n\n\nBodies (subsequent times, after examining pen in pocket and both wounds)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Plastic bags strewn about\" and \"Neat and tidy table\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is a very tidy pile of plastic bags on the table... ...and yet, a portion of them wound up scattered on the floor as well. It's not likely that the ones on the floor were knocked over during a struggle... ...in which case, might there not be another explanation as to how they got there?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Another reason...?\nEdgeworth:\nI believe it's possible that the blood on the outside of the bag is related somehow.\nGumshoe:\nEek! Please get that blood away from me, pal!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. Whose blood is on this bag?\nGumshoe:\nUmmm... Hold on, let me ask the lab guy!\nEdgeworth:\nAlright. Please hurry. ..................\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWait 'till you get a load of this, pal! It's Mr. Faraday's! Oh, and the technician said they didn't find anything else on or in the bag, either.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... It would appear that this bag is a very important piece of evidence.\nGumshoe:\nOK, if you say so! I leave it in your hands, pal!\nPlastic Bag data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Ink stain\" and \"Fountain pen in pocket\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat splotch on Mr. Faraday's hand... I wonder if it might be the ink from his fountain pen.\nGumshoe:\nOoh, let's ask the lab guy!\n\n\nForensics:\nDetective Gumshoe! I confirm that the substance on Mr. Faraday's hand is the ink from his fountain pen!\nGumshoe:\nI see. Good work! Ahhh... You know, I've always wanted to say that! Even if it was just one time in my life!\nEdgeworth:\n......... (If Mr. Faraday wrote with his fountain pen in his left hand... I think it's fair to assume he was left-handed.) It appears that Mr. Faraday's pen is very important to our case as well.\nGumshoe:\nOK, if you say so, pal!\nMr. Faraday's Fountain Pen data jotted down in my Organizer.\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent Mr. Faraday's Fountain Pen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nSo that's what Mr. Faraday uses to write with. It's in a completely different league from my 10 for $9.95 ballpoint pens!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... It looks to be well-used.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, he probably used it a lot at work. I heard he was really passionate about his job. I just can't believe he died like this... Poor guy.\nEdgeworth:\n(As for why he died... I suppose I'll find that out once we solve this case.)\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlastic Bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBloodstain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(This blood here is from Mr. Faraday, but there are no other clues to be found. Which begs the question... ...do I need to put this bag inside another bag to preserve it as evidence?)\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Faraday's Fountain Pen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... It seems Mr. Faraday was in the habit of using very nice fountain pens.\nGumshoe:\nThat's the total opposite of me! I don't get these things at all...\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... Well, I think the pencil behind your ear suits you just fine.\nGumshoe:\nReally!? You think so, pal!? Man, I knew it was worth something!\nEdgeworth:\n.........That wasn't exactly a compliment, Detective.\n\n\n\n\nNib\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... This looks like a quality nib.\nGumshoe:\nHey, let me test it out, pal! Ooh... This is really, really... Ack! I got ink all over my hand!\nEdgeworth:\n...Detective Gumshoe. Don't EVER play with the evidence like that again!\nAfter connecting all possible Logic and examining both wounds, open window, and TV:\nGumshoe:\nI guess there's not much left to investigate, huh? They really did kill each other...\nEdgeworth:\nNo... We can't conclude that quite yet. There's still something I find very peculiar here. The theory that they simply killed one another is too simplistic in this case. In fact, there is actually a contradiction that shows there is another possibility!\nGumshoe:\nNo way, pal! Really!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph...

(I guess I was mistaken...)\nLeads back to examination of bodies\nEdgeworth:\nNow we come face to face with the contradiction I spoke of, and it is... this! Mr. Faraday used his left hand to write with his fountain pen. Ergo, he is left-handed. And yet, the handgun is in his right hand! Don't you find it odd that the left-handed Mr. Faraday would hold the gun in his right hand? That. lady and gentlemen... is the great contradiction haunting this crime scene!\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're right, pal! That does seem kinda strange! But... How could something like that happen?\nEdgeworth:\nThe facts add up to one conclusion, and one alone. Someone else put the gun in Mr. Faraday's hand after he died.\nGumshoe:\nSomeone else...!?\nEdgeworth:\nPlastic bags scattered on the floor, and a gun in the wrong hand... I sense the presence of a shadowy figure behind this case. A person of vile intent who is serious about keeping the truth from us!\nInvestigation Complete\nSeptember 10\nDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 2\nBadd:\nHere's the autopsy report.\nFranziska:\n\"It is probable for that Mr. Rell survived for a short time after he was shot. However, Mr. Faraday died instantaneously from his stabbing.\" Interesting...\nCrime Scene Notes updated in my Organizer.\nFranziska:\nIt looks like we now know everything we need to know about this case.\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure we know everything...?\nFranziska:\nOf course! The incident began with Mr. Faraday attempting to get his revenge. The prosecutor went into a rage from being accused, and tried to kill the defendant... But, the defendant fought back and they ended up killing each other. It's all very clear and simple. There is absolutely no margin for doubt.\nEdgeworth:\nDo you really believe that to be the truth?\nFranziska:\nHah! Are you saying that just because I figured out the truth before you... ...that you don't want to believe it's true?\nEdgeworth:\nN-Nngh...\nFranziska:\nIt's alright. If you disagree with my argument, then prove me wrong. Well, if there are any contradictions to be found, that is...\nEdgeworth:\nDon't worry, I will.\nArgument\n-- What Happened --\nFranziska:\nMr. Faraday's death was instantaneous, while Mr. Rell survived for a short time.\nFrom this, it is obvious that Mr. Faraday died after he shot Mr. Rell.\nAnd Mr. Rell, while on the brink of death, stole Mr. Faraday's knife and stabbed him.\nThose are the facts of this case.\nEdgeworth:\n(Mr. Faraday's death was instantaneous, therefore, he must've attacked first... Proving that logic to be false is probably the fastest way to show her that she's wrong. In that case, I should first look for any holes in her theory!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you truly believe that Mr. Faraday died instantaneously? Franziska: I have the murder report right here... \"Mr. Faraday died instantaneously of shock due to being stabbed in the chest.\" There, you see? It's been documented, clear as day. Edgeworth: Arngh...!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Faraday shot Mr. Rell before he died...? Do you have any basis for that statement? Franziska: Your foolishness has no end, does it? Now, I hate to repeat myself, however... ...\"Mr. Faraday died instantaneously.\" That's all the basis I need. Edgeworth: Alright, so if Mr. Faraday died instantaneously... ...then he must have attacked Mr. Rell before being stabbed. Franziska: You're finally beginning to catch on, I see.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you believe that the dying Mr. Rell stole the knife from Mr. Faraday? Franziska: Mr. Rell became desperate as he did not want to die. Human beings can do amazing things when they are put to the test. So, the two men struggled... And in the end, Mr. Rell was able to grab the knife and stab Mr. Faraday. The messy condition of this room is a testament to their struggle. Hmm... Yes, my logic is perfectly sound. Edgeworth: ...Can you really say that it's \"perfect\"? Franziska: What are you insinuating? Edgeworth: Nothing... However, I can't let what you said slide by without further inquiry. One must be clear and precise, so if you could append that statement to your testimony... Franziska: ...Fine. Changes statement from \"And Mr. Rell, while on the brink of death, stole Mr. Faraday's knife and stabbed him.\" to \"They struggled, and Mr. Rell used the last of his strength to counterattack Mr. Faraday.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: About this statement... Franziska: Mr. Rell used all of his remaining strength to take the knife and defend himself. One can easily see that they had a violent struggle. Of course, it's nothing compared to what my riding crop can do. Edgeworth: (How does one compare the damage her crop can do with the state of this room!?) Franziska: Furthermore, all the plastic bags on the floor in this room... ...were scattered there due to the fight. Is there anything else that I can explain for you? Edgeworth: No, that will be fine...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Claiming speculation as fact already? Don't you feel that the evidence is a bit lacking? Franziska: You'll find all the evidence you need just by looking around this room. Mr. Faraday collapsed on top of Mr. Rell... In addition, Mr. Faraday died instantaneously, making a counterattack impossible. Furthermore, the room is a total mess from their fight... Heh, I dare say that there's more evidence here than you could whip a whip at. Edgeworth: (It looks like she's becoming more and more confident... And... looking at this place, she might have a right to be. After all, everything here seems to support her theory...) Franziska: It looks like you're starting to see my point. I've as good as won our little competition.\nEdgeworth: (There's something strange about Franziska's theory... I should compare her claim with the data I've gathered thus far. I just know there's a contradiction somewhere!)",

However, Detective Gumshoe testified that he heard absolutely nothing!\nFranziska:\nHah. You place too much faith in that detective's testimony, you know. But for the sake of argument, let's say there wasn't a fight. How, then, did Mr. Rell get his hands on the knife?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Faraday's bag was sitting right here in Lobby No. 2. It is not hard to imagine that perhaps Mr. Rell saw a chance and took it out at some point!\nFranziska:\n.................. So... What you're saying this: Mr. Rell took a chance when he saw the opportunity, and took the knife from the bag. And then Mr. Faraday shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed...?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm......... (Isn't there something... strange in Franziska's statement just now?)\nNo, it all makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt... does all add up.\nFranziska:\n...So then, there's no problem, right?\nEdgeworth:\nN-No...?\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nYes?\nFranziska:\nTaking random shots in the dark is unbecoming of a disciple of Von Karma!\nEdgeworth:\nNnghoooh!\nFranziska:\nNow, take a step back and think for a change!\nEdgeworth:\nN-Nngh... (Is Franziska's explanation of things really perfect? I'm going to carefully review what she said once again in my head!)\n\n\nFranziska:\nMr. Rell took a chance when he saw the opportunity, and took the knife from the bag. And then Mr. Faraday shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed...?\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(As I suspected... There is definitely something wrong with her theory!)\nFranziska:\nHah... If you have nothing to say, then I suppose that I win--\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWait, as I suspected, something doesn't add up.\nFranziska:\n...Oh?\nLeads to:\n\"It's simply not possible for Mr. Faraday to have shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed!\"\nYes, something is off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWait, something doesn't add up.\nFranziska:\n...Oh, really?\nLeads to:\n\"It's simply not possible for Mr. Faraday to have shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed!\"\nEdgeworth:\nIt's simply not possible for Mr. Faraday to have shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed!\nPresent Crime Scene Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"According to the coroner's report, Mr. Faraday died instantaneously, meaning...\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the piece of evidence that proves it!\nFranziska:\nHah! And what is this supposed to prove?\nEdgeworth:\n...Take a closer look.\nFranziska:\n.........? I'm still not seeing it.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... In that case, I'll just have to try and explain it to you.\nFranziska:\n\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth... You should know by now that you can't fool me!\nEdgeworth:\nAaarghn! (I guess this evidence was unrelated after all... I have to think this over one more time... Mr. Rell grabbed the knife from Mr. Faraday's bag when he wasn't paying attention... And Mr. Faraday shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed by the knife. But it just doesn't add up, and I have the evidence that proves that it doesn't!)\nLeads back to:\n\"It's simply not possible for Mr. Faraday to have shot Mr. Rell after being stabbed!\"\nEdgeworth:\nAccording to the coroner's report, Mr. Faraday died instantaneously, meaning... ..that he died immediately upon being stabbed by the knife! Ergo, he could not possibly have fired the gun after that!\nFranziska:\n...Ooh, you got me.\nEdgeworth:\nBut of course.\nFranziska:\nWell then, if the report is correct, then there is only one correct explanation. If we suppose that Mr. Rell attacked first... ...then Mr. Faraday, who died instantaneously, would have been unable to kill Mr. Rell.  Therefore, Mr. Rell must have stabbed Mr. Faraday after he was shot. Then they both died. That is the only explanation that makes logical sense!\nEdgeworth:\nNegating your opponent's ideas in order to prove your own theory... I see you've been studying, Franziska.\nFranziska:\nI just wanted to explain it to you as simply as possible. Before you foolishly propose a foolish theory that only a foolish fool like you could.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... How naïve of you to believe that only your opinions are valid... ...and still expect to discover the truth that the crime scene offers you... Franziska... You've still got a ways to go.\nFranziska:\nWhat are you talking about!? Are you saying there's a flaw in my logic!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Mr. Faraday died instantly... And the fact that he did is what gives rise to the contradiction in this scene!) The contradiction here in this crime scene is...!\nThe order of events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is a contradiction in the order you say the crime took place in.\nFranziska:\n\nFranziska:\n...Oh? In that case, why don't you prove the contradiction already!? Miles Edgeworth! Remember that we Von Karmas must strive to be perfect in every way!\nEdgeworth:\n...Nnghhoooh!\nFranziska:\nAnd that kind of half-baked answer can hardly be called \"perfect\", now can it?\nEdgeworth:\n(Maybe I should've given a more detailed explanation... Let's see... Mr. Faraday died instantaneously...)\nLeads back to:\n\"And the fact that he did is what gives rise to the contradiction in this scene!\"\nThe order the bodies fell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight.\"\nThe evidence bag's location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe evidence bag is too far away from the bodies. If the bag that held the weapons was [sic] this far from the victims... ...then neither of the two men could have taken one out without the other noticing!\nFranziska:\n\nFranziska:\nHeh. Weren't you the one who just said: \"...perhaps Mr. Rell saw a chance and took it out at some point\"? Now take some responsibility for your own claims!\nEdgeworth:\nNnghoooh...! (Maybe I should've given a more detailed explanation... I need to think this over one more time. Let's see... Mr. Faraday died instantaneously...)\nLeads back to:\n\"And the fact that he did is what gives rise to the contradiction in this scene!\"\nEdgeworth:\nLet me get this straight. What you are arguing is this: Mr. Faraday took the gun from his evidence bag and shot Mr. Rell. Then, the wounded Mr. Rell found an opportunity to take the knife and strike back. Upon being stabbed, Mr. Faraday died on the spot, and Mr. Rell died thereafter. If that's the case, then how do you explain this? Take a good look at the order in which their bodies are piled.\nFranziska:\n............N-No...!\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Faraday's body is lying on top of Mr. Rell's. Therefore... ...Mr. Rell must have died before Mr. Faraday!\nFranziska:\nI-Impossible!\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, I agree that it seems strange no matter what angle you approach it from... ...which means that the real mystery behind this crime scene that we must solve is--!)\nFranziska:\nFranziska:\nNo...! Not so fast, Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat now...?\nFranziska:\nI simply think that you ought to think a bit more outside the box... And that it's even clearer now that the incident started with Mr. Faraday's murderous intent!\nEdgeworth:\n(She sure bounced back quickly. An explanation won't be enough this time. It's going to take some very decisive evidence to prove her wrong!)\nArgument\n-- What Happened, Pt. 2 --\nFranziska:\nIt was just chance that Mr. Faraday's body fell on top of Mr. Rell's.\nThe two bodies fell into a pile...\n...which indicates that they attacked each other at the same time.\nIt really doesn't matter in the slightest that they fell in the opposite order.\nEdgeworth:\n(I just know that Franziska's explanation isn't absolutely correct. All I have to do is find a hole in her logic! Once I do, I can then present her with the evidence that proves the contradiction!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: About that-- Franziska: Franziska: *sigh* Pressing someone's testimony in order to gain some time to think... You're a real one-trick pony, aren't you? It's too bad your trick only works on fools. Edgeworth: Th-That wasn't my intent! I simply wish for more details as to how Mr. Faraday ended up on top of Mr. Rell... Franziska: Hmph. Someone's impatient. I was just about to explain everything to you. So do you think you could hold on for a minute!? Edgeworth: Argh! ......Franziska, I'll make you a deal. I'll hold on if you hold on to that whip of yours. Franziska: Oh, I'll hold on to it alright, As I whip you! Edgeworth: Arrngh! Franziska: Well, now that you've quieted down a bit, I'd like to continue, if you don't mind.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: The two fell on top of each other...? Don't you find that to be just a bit strange? Franziska: Not at all. Edgeworth: Aarngh! (I can see it in her eyes... She's dead set against me from the bottom of her heart.) Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... Once I'm done here, you'll see that there's nothing strange at all! Now then, the two men fell into a pile...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: What do you mean by \"they attacked each other at the same time\"? Franziska: I assume Mr. Faraday had the two different weapons in his hands... He made to attack Mr. Rell while holding both the knife and revolver... and then... After Mr. Faraday fired the gun... ...Mr. Rell grabbed the knife as he was falling, and stabbed Mr. Faraday. That is how Mr. Rell wound up on the bottom with Mr. Faraday on top. At close range, that is more than possible. Edgeworth: Yes, it's possible, but... Franziska: Well, if you have any other ideas... ...then show me what you've got! Edgeworth: Oh, I will. And to that extent... I'd like for you to append what you just said to your testimony. Franziska: Hmph... I don't see any point to that, but as you please. Changes statement from \"...which indicates that they attacked each other at the same time.\" to \"That fact indicates that they attacked each other at the same time from close range.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You're saying that they attacked each other at the same time from close range? Franziska: Exactly. Mr. Faraday pointed the gun at Mr. Rell's chest and pulled the trigger. Mr. Rell then took the knife from Mr. Faraday and stabbed him before he fell unconscious. The dead Mr. Faraday instantly fell on top of Mr. Rell from the stabbing... ...pinning Mr. Rell under him, where he died shortly thereafter. And that's how they ended up on top of each other with no contradictions to be seen. Edgeworth: Hmm...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you really believe they fell in the exact opposite order in which they attacked? Franziska: Miles Edgeworth... You're not listening to a word that I'm saying! Edgeworth: Arrngh! Franziska: They both attacked each other at the same time, and Mr. Rell fell first by chance... ...leaving Mr. Faraday to just happen to fall on top of him. Then, Mr. Rell died shortly thereafter, pinned underneath Mr. Faraday. That's how it happened. Edgeworth: (So the two men attacked each other, with Mr. Rell randomly falling down first...?)\nEdgeworth: (The fact that the order that they attacked each other in... ...varies from the order they fell in doesn't cause a problem for me. However, there's definitely one certain aspect that I'm having trouble swallowing!)",

You're a real one-trick pony, aren't you? It's too bad your trick only works on fools.\nEdgeworth:\nTh-That wasn't my intent! I simply wish for more details as to how Mr. Faraday ended up on top of Mr. Rell...\nFranziska:\nHmph. Someone's impatient. I was just about to explain everything to you. So do you think you could hold on for a minute!?\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! ......Franziska, I'll make you a deal. I'll hold on if you hold on to that whip of yours.\nFranziska:\nOh, I'll hold on to it alright, As I whip you!\nEdgeworth:\nArrngh!\nFranziska:\nWell, now that you've quieted down a bit, I'd like to continue, if you don't mind.\nFranziska:\nThe two bodies fell into a pile...\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe two fell on top of each other...? Don't you find that to be just a bit strange?\nFranziska:\nNot at all.\nEdgeworth:\nAarngh! (I can see it in her eyes... She's dead set against me from the bottom of her heart.)\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth... Once I'm done here, you'll see that there's nothing strange at all! Now then, the two men fell into a pile...\nFranziska:\n...which indicates that they attacked each other at the same time.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean by \"they attacked each other at the same time\"?\nFranziska:\nI assume Mr. Faraday had the two different weapons in his hands... He made to attack Mr. Rell while holding both the knife and revolver... and then... After Mr. Faraday fired the gun... ...Mr. Rell grabbed the knife as he was falling, and stabbed Mr. Faraday. That is how Mr. Rell wound up on the bottom with Mr. Faraday on top. At close range, that is more than possible.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it's possible, but...\nFranziska:\nWell, if you have any other ideas... ...then show me what you've got!\nEdgeworth:\nOh, I will. And to that extent... I'd like for you to append what you just said to your testimony.\nFranziska:\nHmph... I don't see any point to that, but as you please.\nChanges statement from \"...which indicates that they attacked each other at the same time.\" to \"That fact indicates that they attacked each other at the same time from close range.\"\nFranziska:\nThat fact indicates that they attacked each other at the same time from close range.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou're saying that they attacked each other at the same time from close range?\nFranziska:\nExactly. Mr. Faraday pointed the gun at Mr. Rell's chest and pulled the trigger. Mr. Rell then took the knife from Mr. Faraday and stabbed him before he fell unconscious. The dead Mr. Faraday instantly fell on top of Mr. Rell from the stabbing... ...pinning Mr. Rell under him, where he died shortly thereafter. And that's how they ended up on top of each other with no contradictions to be seen.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm...\nPresent Handgun or Crime Scene Notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"So you believe they killed each other at close range...? Sorry, but that's impossible.\"\nFranziska:\nIt really doesn't matter in the slightest that they fell in the opposite order.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you really believe they fell in the exact opposite order in which they attacked?\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth... You're not listening to a word that I'm saying!\nEdgeworth:\nArrngh!\nFranziska:\nThey both attacked each other at the same time, and Mr. Rell fell first by chance... ...leaving Mr. Faraday to just happen to fall on top of him. Then, Mr. Rell died shortly thereafter, pinned underneath Mr. Faraday. That's how it happened.\nEdgeworth:\n(So the two men attacked each other, with Mr. Rell randomly falling down first...?)\nEdgeworth:\n(The fact that the order that they attacked each other in... ...varies from the order they fell in doesn't cause a problem for me. However, there's definitely one certain aspect that I'm having trouble swallowing!)\nEdgeworth:\nSo you believe they killed each other at close range...? Sorry, but that's impossible. Just as it is written in the crime scene notes... ...the firing of the handgun did not leave a gunpowder burn on Mr. Rell's clothes. Therefore... Mr. Rell and the gun... ...must have been separated by a distance of at least two or three yards!\nFranziska:\nAaaaah!\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes... This is by far the biggest contradiction! The two bodies are piled up on each other, yet the gun was fired from a distance. And with there being no chance that Mr. Rell moved that far after being shot... ...that leaves only one possible explanation!)\nFranziska:\nWh-What a completely foolish line of foolish thought from a thoroughly foolish fool! If I'm not right... ...then who was it that made the first move with the intent to kill, huh!? Who!?\nEdgeworth:\nThe person that attacked first with murderous intent? That would be...\nMr. Faraday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Faraday, of course.\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal. What you're saying now contradicts with what you said earlier.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, um... (I have to re-think this... carefully!)\nLeads back to:\n\"The person that attacked first with murderous intent?\"\nMr. Rell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Rell, of course.\nFranziska:\nYou know... ...your foolishly foolish foolhardy idea is making me feel just as foolish as you! The murder weapons used in this case were taken straight from Mr. Faraday's bag. The fact that Mr. Faraday had items that could be used to kill in his possession... ...is something Mr. Rell wouldn't have known!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh! (She's right, of course... Mr. Rell wouldn't have known what was inside Mr. Faraday's bag... I have to re-think this... carefully!)\nLeads back to:\n\"The person that attacked first with murderous intent?\"\nNeither man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Here in this room...\"\nEdgeworth:\nHere in this room... ...contradictions appear no matter which man we claim attacked first. Thus, there can be only one explanation. There was... a third person here!\nFranziska:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nIt was that third person who killed both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell... ...and set their bodies up to make it look like a double murder... That third person is the real culprit!\nFranziska:\n............ Miles Edgeworth... There's just one thing you're missing.\nEdgeworth:\n...Evidence, correct?\nFranziska:\nExactly. Everything you've said up until now is nothing but a story played out in your head. However, this is where the real test begins. Can you prove that there was a third person involved in this crime!?\nEdgeworth:\n...Of course. (If a third person was [sic] truly here, that fact would resolve the glaring contradiction. The proof that this has all been a set-up, made to look like they killed each other... I'll present it, and lay bare the final piece of the puzzle that's not yet in place! What is the piece of evidence that proves there is a third person involved...?)\nPresent Handgun or Plastic Bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The gun in Mr. Faraday's hand and the plastic bag with his blood on it...\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is that very evidence.\nFranziska:\n...? And exactly how is this related? Do you think you could explain it to me?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... There is no need for an explanation.\nGumshoe:\nUmm, well, I have no idea how it's related, so could you please explain it to me!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, well, um...\nFranziska:\nLet me guess, you can't explain it can you?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm...\nFranziska:\n..............................\nEdgeworth:\nGnnaaargh! (I-It would appear that I was wrong... But there is definitely a contradiction here... ...and it should resolve itself if there truly was a third person here... I just need to go over the evidence and my thoughts once again!)\nLeads back to:\n\"What is the piece of evidence that proves there is a third person involved...?\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe gun in Mr. Faraday's hand and the plastic bag with his blood on it... These two items point to the presence of a third person.\nFranziska:\nHow so...?\nEdgeworth:\nRecall Detective Gumshoe's testimony.\nGumshoe:\nI was in the hallway the whole time, but I didn't hear a single peep of a struggle.\nEdgeworth:\nIf there wasn't a struggle in this room... ...then there shouldn't be any plastic bags on the ground. Meaning that someone else must've deliberately scattered them around!\nFranziska:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nDo you not see the possibility in this? Disregarding the gun for the moment... ...there's a high probability of blood splatter when a knife is used on a person. If the culprit held the knife with a plastic bag around it... ...they could use the bag to catch any blood splatter from when they withdrew the knife. Then, by spreading a few more plastic bags around, mixing the bloody one in with them... ...and arranging the room to make it look like there was a struggle between the two... ...they were able to conceal their presence!\nFranziska:\nAaaaaaaaah!\nBadd:\nLooks like... we've still got a long way to go in this investigation...\nEdgeworth:\nYes.\n???:\nGumshoe:\nWh-What the heck's up with you, pal!?\nYew:\nMr. Badd, I advise you to place Detective Gumshoe under arrest.\nGumshoe:\nWh...WHAAAAAAAAAAAT!?\nBadd:\n......What's the meaning of this?\nYew:\nHah! Looks like you're not man enough to discipline your own subordinates.\nBadd:\n...Don't you dare...!\nYew:\nThat detective claims he was there, standing in front of the door the entire time... ...but I have it on good authority that it was all a giant lie!\nBadd:\n......!\nEdgeworth:\n...Ms. Yew! I ask that you please explain that last statement!\nYew:\nI'll let His Honor explain it himself.\nJudge:\nI-I saw it with my own eyes, I tell you! During the recess, there was a period of time when there was no one in the hallway!\nGumshoe:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nYew:\nSee, Mr. Badd? So I ask you, why would a detective who was supposedly doing his job the whole time... ...want to fabricate such a lie?\nBadd:\n...Gumshoe. Did you... Did you kill Faraday...!?\nGumshoe:\nN-Noooooooooooooooooo! Of course not, sir!\nFranziska:\nIt would appear that the one who set this whole crime scene up is that detective. ...Which basically renders his testimony a complete lie and wholly invalid. It looks like your \"perfect\" logic has just come tumbling down, Miles.\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...\nGumshoe:\nI was in the hallway the whole time, but I didn't hear a single peep of a struggle.\nEdgeworth:\n(Was that statement really a lie...?)\nBadd:\n...Detective Gumshoe. You're now a suspect in the murder of two men. Now, spit out the truth, or so help me...!\nGumshoe:\nI...I haven't lied to anyone, sir! Honest! I really was really there... I was in the hallway the whole time!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Badd, I ask that you please do not act without my permission. After all, I am the one that is heading up this investigation, am I not?\nBadd:\n.........Don't talk like you know what's going on, boy...\nEdgeworth:\nAll I want is for this investigation to run perfectly.\nFranziska:\nPerfection is the only wish of a disciple of Von Karma, after all.\nEdgeworth:\nTherefore, before you take Detective Gumshoe into custody... ...I'd like to set the record straight on something.\nBadd:\n...And what's that...?\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm, what should I ask Detective Gumshoe about...?)\nMotive for the murders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I suppose the one thing I'd like clarified...\"\nWhy he wasn't in the hallway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe, why were you missing from the hallway for a span of time?\nGumshoe:\nLook, pal! Like I said, I was there the whole time, OK!?\nEdgeworth:\nBut there is testimony against you that...\nFranziska:\n\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth! Why are you wasting our time with a completely useless question!?\nEdgeworth:\nHm...?\nFranziska:\nThe only logical reason as to why he was absent is that he was busy committing the crime!\nEdgeworth:\n!\nFranziska:\nAnyone who says otherwise... is a fool!\nEdgeworth:\nGnnrk...! (Maybe I should ask about something else...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Hmm, what should I ask Detective Gumshoe about...?\"\nState of the hallway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. I take it that no one else was in that hallway at any time, correct?\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? O-Oh, of course not, pal!\nEdgeworth:\nYou're being awfully defensive... Might you be hiding something from me?\nGumshoe:\nW-Watch your mouth, pal! You can't go around saying stuff like that about me without any evidence!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm...! I suppose you're right. I have no evidence at this point...\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth! How can you be losing a battle of wits with THIS detective!? You're a disgrace!\nEdgeworth:\nGnnrk...! (Maybe I should ask about something else...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Hmm, what should I ask Detective Gumshoe about...?\"\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose the one thing I'd like (changed from [liked] in the original release, correcting the typo) clarified... ...is Detective Gumshoe's motive for committing this crime.\nBadd:\nHmph... Motive, huh. Gumshoe... You got a grudge against Faraday or anything...?\nGumshoe:\nN-No, sir! Not me! Not a single bad thing against Mr. Faraday, sir!\nBadd:\n...Is that a fact...?\nYew:\nYew:\n...You really have a problem with lying, don't you, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nI'm telling you... I AM NOT LYING!\nFranziska:\nThe more unnatural you act, the more suspicious you become, you know.\nYew:\nIf you want a motive, Edgeworth, I have one for you right here.\nEdgeworth:\nCould you please share it with us? However, be forewarned that I won't hesitate to object to flights of fancy... ...because all I'm interested in is the perfect explanation.\nYew:\nPhwwh! Ahahahahahaha! You're serious, aren't you? ...Fine. You amuse me, so I'll humor you with a little courtroom practice.\nArgument\n-- Gumshoe's Motive --\nYew:\nIt was... about a week ago.\nI saw the detective get chewed out by a livid Faraday in front of the precinct.\nHe stood there super pale, as Mr. Faraday yelled, \"That's a salary cut for you, you nitwit!\"\nA brand new detective suddenly getting his salary cut -- that's reason enough for a grudge.\nWell? How's that for the \"perfect explanation\"?\nGumshoe:\nY-You totally misunderstand me, pal! No matter how mad I get, I could never hold a grudge!\nBadd:\n.........Quiet. We can't trust anything you say...!\nGumshoe:\nSir...\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... There's nothing wrong with the motive she proposed, per se... ...but there are some gaps in her logic that need to be filled in. Ms. Yew's \"perfect explanation\"... ...may not be so \"perfect\" at all...!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: A week ago...? Then, you and Detective Gumshoe are acquaintances? Yew: Phwwwwwh...! No way. I only met him in-person today. Edgeworth: Then how did you know about Detective Gumshoe? Yew: Oh, I've seen him around before.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Faraday was upset? Yew: Yeah. You know what else? Mr. Faraday isn't exactly known to get angry often... ...Phwwh! Phwwwwwh! But there he was, totally beet red in the face! ...Ahem. And the offending detective just stood there, pale as a ghost, like he was about to die! Franziska: Just like the face he's making now, right? Gumshoe: Arnngh... I'm completely innocent I tell you... Yew: ...Phwwh! Phwwwwh! Edgeworth: (...The poor man.) Yew: Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! ...Ahem. It was quite the scene with the detective.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You just stood there, watching this unfold in front of you? Yew: Yeah. I have to say it was really enjoyable, too. But that's why when I saw Detective Gumshoe earlier, I knew to steer clear of him. Gumshoe: No way... I thought it was because I had something stuck on my face! Yew: Phwwh...! Ahahahahahaha! But you do! Gumshoe: Huh? What've I got stuck on my face? Yew: Let's start with your eyes, nose, mouth... Oh, and those ridiculous eyebrows. Gumshoe: Huh? Yew: Phwwwwwh! AHAHAHAHAHAHA! Oh, man! Messing with your head is just too much fun! Edgeworth: ...Ms. Yew. If you don't mind, I'd like to return to your testimony now. Yew: Phwwwh... Sure, why not?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmm... To cut a new detective's salary right off the bat like that... Yew: I'm not really familiar with the way you guys relate, but is that a common practice? Gumshoe: Nnnnnnn... Speaking of cutting my salary, didn't you threaten to do that to me earlier, too!? Edgeworth: ............I suppose I did. Franziska: It's only natural to cut a worthless detective's salary down to their actual worth. My father can even fire anyone, new or old, with a snap of his fingers. Yew: Phwwh! Do you think maybe that's reason enough for detectives to hate you people? Badd: .........Well, I guess... They really... shouldn't cut people's pay. Edgeworth: (Detective Badd... Don't tell me, Mr. von Karma cut your salary earlier...?)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You call your explanation \"perfect\"? Yew: Ahah...! Is it not to your liking? Edgeworth: Unfortunately for you, it's just not up to my standards. Yew: Oh? Is there something you want me to clarify, in that case? Edgeworth: (What should I do? Should I raise an objection?) Raise an objection Leads to: \"Alright, if you could clear this one thing up for me...!\" Don't raise an objection Edgeworth: (Maybe I should wait and listen to what she has to say for a bit longer...) Leads back to rebuttal Leads to: \"Alright, if you could clear this one thing up for me...!\" Edgeworth: (Maybe I should wait and listen to what she has to say for a bit longer...) Leads back to rebuttal\nEdgeworth: (Detective Gumshoe certainly had a motive to kill Mr. Faraday. However, there is just one thing I can't wrap my head around in this explanation.

He may look like an easy-going guy... ...but he's actually... a bit of a nut for strict discipline and manners.

Wouldn't you agree?\nYew:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\nIs there anyone else who might have had a grudge against either of the two men? Or should we look into that ourselves?\nYew:\nOh... In that case... .........I have absolutely no idea.\nEdgeworth:\n.........! (What? But that's impossible! She must know SOMETHING!)\nYew:\nPhwwh... Wait... Ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Can you please not glare at me like that? ...It makes me laugh. Phwwwwwh!\nEdgeworth:\n(Grr...! I didn't even do anything, and you're already laughing away!)\nYew:\nWell, anyway... the way I see it, as long as he had a motive to kill one of the two... ...this crime would've played out the way it did anyway.\nEdgeworth:\n...Oh? Would you care to explain your logic? And this time, please try to provide a truly perfect explanation.\nYew:\nPhwwwwh...! Perfect this, perfect that... Stop being so uptight, or is that a requisite trait for being a Von Karma? Ahahahaha!\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth! I demand that you shut this rude woman up!\nEdgeworth:\n(...I wish you'd BOTH be quiet for just one second...)\nYew:\nAhem... Oh well. I guess I'll just have to explain it to you kids.\nArgument\n-- Motive To Kill The Men --\nYew:\nThere's no one out there with a motive to kill both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell.\nAll you really have to establish is that someone had a grudge against one of the two men.\nMr. Rell, who happened to be there, became a witness to Mr. Faraday's murder.\nTherefore, he was killed out of necessity, and set up to look like they had killed each other.\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder if that's really true... Is there no one out there with a grudge against both men? I should take another hard look at the evidence for this morning's case. The second KG-8 Incident, as people are calling it, involving an Embassy staff member... ...and the two men who both wound up as suspects in the case... Is there someone else I'm overlooking who is somehow related to them?)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So there is no one else who might have a grudge against both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell? Yew: I suppose \"no one\"... is a bit of a stretch. But I'm pretty sure no one like that was here in this courthouse today. Edgeworth: (...She's lying through her teeth. We just saw a someone \"like that\" here earlier!) Yew: Besides, you don't need to prove that the killer had a grudge against both men.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Someone with a grudge against one of the men... In that case, aren't there plenty of other people who fit the bill? Yew: Sure. After all, who doesn't garner scorn from another simply by being alive? But the only one who held a grudge and acted upon it by killing was Detective Gumshoe. Edgeworth: Nngh...! Yew: Furthermore...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you're saying that he was basically silenced...? Yew: Aren't you glad you managed to avoid the same fate, Your Honor? Why, if you had been the one to witness the blood-covered detective... Ahahaha! Judge: Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What!? Detective Gumshoe! Y-You would kill even me!? Gumshoe: Whaaaaaaaat!? I-I... I could never do something as terrible as that, Your Honor! Judge: There's no need for even a second of deliberation! I will hand down my verdict here-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor. Take a look around. We are not in court right now! It would be greatly appreciated if you would stay here with us in reality. Judge: Ack! Please forgive me! I know not what I do! Yew: Phwwh...! Franziska: And you there, Ms. Yew! Hurry up and continue with your testimony. If you fail to do so... I will whip you into shape! Yew: Ha ha ha... That's nice. Sounds kind of like fun, actually. Anyway, Detective Gumshoe had to erase the witness, Mr. Rell.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmm... Gumshoe: I. Didn't. Do. It. Pal! Yew: No hard feelings, but I don't think we can take the word of a criminal seriously. Gumshoe: *whimper* B-But! I can't even begin to think up ways to set up a crime scene! Edgeworth: ......... Franziska: ...I suppose you do lack the necessary tactical mind required to do such a thing. Gumshoe: *whimper* Why do you have to kick a man when he's down, pal? Yew: Ahahaha! You shouldn't put yourself down, Detective! You're a big boy. I bet you thought it up all by yourself, right? Gumshoe: Y-Yeah! That's right! And I worked real hard at it, too! Edgeworth: (I think this proves one thing about the detective: he has the mental acuity of a worm.)\nEdgeworth: (I have to admit, her explanation makes sense. However, there is also something she overlooked in her testimony. I should present that piece of evidence, and see if I can't make her see the truth!)",

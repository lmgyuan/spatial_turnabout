This is Maya.Mia:\nHey Maya, it's me.???:\nMia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.Mia:\nSorry, I've been so busy. How you been????:\nWell, LONELY. And it's all YOUR fault. Nah, I'm just teasing. I've been great! I'm finally getting used to having my own place.Mia:\nThat's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.???:\nI know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you?Mia:\nSharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.???:\nI gotcha. So, what is it this time?Mia:\nIt's... a clock.???:\nA clock?Mia:\nYeah, it's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.???:\nHey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!Mia:\nNow, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.???:\nHuh? It's not working? That's lame!Mia:\nI had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.???:\nPapers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.Mia:\nCan you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then.???:\nOkay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger.Mia:\nOkay, okay. We'll hit the usual joint.???:\nAlright! It's a deal! Okay, Sis, see you soon!Mia:\nYep. I'll be waiting, Maya.Cellular:*beep*[Conversation recorded. September 5, 9:27 AM]September 5, 8:57 PMFey & Co. Law Offices???:\nNow, Miss Fey, I'll take what's mine... the papers.Mia:\nI'm sorry, but I can't give you what I don't have.???:\nMiss Fey, you are a poor liar. Why, I see it right over there... That must be \"The Thinker\" that swallowed those papers.Mia:\nHow could you know...????:\nHo hoh. You are not cogniferous of my background? Gathering information is my business, you see.Mia:\nI... I should have been more careful.???:\nHo hoh. My dear Miss Fey... I am so very sorry. But I am afraid I must ask you for one more thing. Your eternal silence... Farewell, Miss Fey.Mia:\n!!!Red... White... Blue...Episode 2Turnabout SistersSeptember 5, 9:08 PMFey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:\nUh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay!Phoenix:\nThat smell... Blood!???:\n... *sob* Sis...Phoenix:\n(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?Chief!!!Phoenix:\nWho are you????:\n...Phoenix:\n(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:\nChief...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroken glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSome shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.\n\n\n\n\nChair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.\n\n\n\n\nMia Fey's body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nChief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. \"The Thinker\" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.\nThe Thinker added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.\nGlass Shards added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nNothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?\n\n\n\n\nMia Fey's body (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.\n\n\n\n\n\"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday.\nReceipt added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; after clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co.

I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.)\n\n\n\n\n\"The Thinker\" statue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a large building right across from the office. The \"Gatewater Hotel.\" A nice, luxurious place.\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAll the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.\n\n\n\n\nComputer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSurprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office d√©cor: \"Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple.\"\n\n\n\n\nLedger book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.\n\n\n\n\nCorded phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nRight! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.\n???:\nPolice!? Please, come quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...\n\n\n\n\nCorded phone (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe phone receiver is missing a few screws. I'd better not use it.Fey & Co. Law OfficesIf Fey & Co. Law Offices is being visited for the first time, before Receipt is added to the Court Record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...! (That girl just now... where'd she go!? I put her right there on that sofa...! Uh oh... I hope she didn't run on me.) Yipes! (Don't scare me like that...) Umm... Excuse me but, who are you?\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\nIt's okay. I work here.\nMaya:\nMaya... Maya Fey.\nPhoenix:\nMaya... Fey?If Fey & Co. Law Offices is being visited for the first time, after Receipt is added to the Court Record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...!

Excuse me but, who are you?\n???:\n...\nPhoenix:\nIt's okay. I work here.\nMaya:\nMaya... Maya Fey.\nPhoenix:\nMaya... Fey? (\"Maya\"...? So Mia was writing this girl's name! Maybe I should show her the receipt? I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom!)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant.\n\n\n\n\nDoor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob.\n\n\n\n\nPainting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA large painting. I guess you'd call this \"modern art.\" I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.\n\n\n\n\nReception desk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe reception desk. I usually sit here.\n\n\n\n\nSofa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model.\n\n\n\n\nWriting desk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA small writing desk cluttered with office supplies.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened?\nMaya:\n... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...!\nPhoenix:\n(So she was already dead.)\n\n\n\n\nYou and the Chief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're the chief's...?\nMaya:\nSister. I'm her younger sister.\nPhoenix:\nAnd you were here... visiting? This late at night?\nMaya:\nYes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her.\nPhoenix:\nEvidence...?\nMaya:\nYes... I-it was that clock... It was \"The Thinker.\"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, about \"The Thinker\"...\nMaya:\n! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob*\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...)\n\n\n\n\nGlass Shards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis was lying next to the chief.\nMaya:\nI know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand.\nPhoenix:\nHmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...)\n\n\n\n\nReceipt (before examining corded phone in Office)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBefore Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.\nMaya:\n! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?\nPhoenix:\nPlease, just calm down.\nMaya:\nW-why would Sis write my name?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!)\n\n\n\n\nReceipt (after examining corded phone in Office)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBefore Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.\nMaya:\n! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?\nPhoenix:\nPlease, just calm down.\nMaya:\nW-why would Sis write my name?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh. Now I've done it...)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI'm sorry, I've never seen that before.After examining corded phone in Office and presenting Receipt in Fey & Co. Law Offices:*whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*... *whee-ooo* *whee-ooo*...Phoenix:\n! The police! (Sounds like they're coming this way!)Freeze! Police!Gumshoe:\nAlright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see?Phoenix:\n(Gumshoe...? What an odd name.)Gumshoe:\nWe received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder.Phoenix:\n(It must have been that woman I saw.)Gumshoe:\nAnyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay?Phoenix:\n(Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.)Gumshoe:\nWhoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me!Maya:\nEek!Gumshoe:\nThis word \"Maya\" here mean anything to you?Maya:\n...! Um... that... That's my name...Gumshoe:\nWHAAAAT!? The victim drew this here note in her own blood, see? With her dying breath, she wrote down the killer's name!Maya:\nK-killer...? I'm not--Gumshoe:\nCase closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am.Maya:\nW-what?Phoenix:\nMia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:\n(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)Maya:\nOh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.Phoenix:\nGood morning! (She looks so tired...)Maya:\nUm... Are you going to be my attorney?Phoenix:\nWell, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...It's up to you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.\nMaya:\nUp... to me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.\nMaya:\n... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!\nLeads to:\n\"Did I look at her like that?\"Of course I will\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up!\nMaya:\nR-really...?\nPhoenix:\n(Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it?\nMaya:\n... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!\nLeads to:\n\"Did I look at her like that?\"Sorry, not a chance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding...\nMaya:\n... ... ...\nPhoenix:\n(Eh heh. Whoops. That didn't go so well.)\nMaya:\n...Heh...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? M-Maya...? Was that a... chuckle?\nMaya:\nWhat? N-no! ... It wasn't very believable, was it?\nPhoenix:\n(Not really...)\nMaya:\nI-I'm sorry! I just thought, since you'd made a joke... Please, don't mind me! You're doing just fine!\nPhoenix:\n(Who's trying to cheer up who here!?)\nMaya:\n... I knew it. No one will believe me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nEven you-- when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!\nLeads to:\n\"Did I look at her like that?\"Phoenix:\n(Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought...Maya:\nI-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you.Phoenix:\nHeard...? Heard what about me?Maya:\nI... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day...Mia:\n\"Today was my junior partner's first time in court.\"Maya:\nWow! Really? How'd that go?Mia:\n\"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while...\"Maya:\nHah! So, he crashed and burned?Mia:\n\"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience.\"Maya:\nHuh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!Mia:\n\"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty.\"Maya:\nThat's what she said!Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nI-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you...Phoenix:\nNo, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia...Maya:\n... I know...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSmile for the camera...\n\n\n\n\nSecurity guard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's something I've been wanting to ask you...\nMaya:\nYes?\nPhoenix:\nWhat's with that outfit?\nMaya:\nOh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.\nPhoenix:\nA-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?\nMaya:\nOh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.\nPhoenix:\nA s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)\n\n\n\n\nThe day of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about the day of the murder?\nMaya:\nYes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.\nPhoenix:\nEvidence?\nMaya:\nYes. That clock shaped like \"The Thinker.\"\nPhoenix:\n(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?\nMaya:\nUm, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?\nPhoenix:\nH-her own voice!?\nMaya:\nYes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.\nPhoenix:\nYou recorded it!\nMaya:\nYeah! I forgot how to delete those things.\n\n\n\n\nThe day of the crime (after clearing \"Your cell phone\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.\nMaya:\nNo, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.\nPhoenix:\n(That's \"The Thinker\" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?\nMaya:\nIt was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.\n\n\n\n\nYour cell phone (appears after \"The day of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!\nMaya:\nRight! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.\nMaya:\nI'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?\nPhoenix:\nSure, thanks.\nMaya's Memo added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nYour cell phone (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!\nMaya:\nRight! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.\nMaya:\nI'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?\nPhoenix:\nSure, thanks.\n\n\n\n\nSpirit mediums (appears after \"Maya\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training.\nMaya:\nThat's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.\nPhoenix:\nWait a second, you said the \"Fey Family\"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?\nMaya:\nOf course! She left the mountain to \"follow her career,\" she said. Her powers were first-class, too!\nPhoenix:\n(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!\nMaya:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?\nMaya:\nYes. ...In training.\nPhoenix:\nWell, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!\nMaya:\n...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I thought that would be too easy.)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about the murder weapon...\nMaya:\nPoor Sis... *sniff*\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. Better not ask her about this now.)\n\n\n\n\nGlass Shards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis was lying next to the chief's body...\nMaya:\nI saw that too. They said they thought these were pieces of a broken light stand.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that seems about right. (Though I'd never heard of a glass light stand before this...)\n\n\n\n\nReceipt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nRemember that receipt?\nMaya:\nY-you mean the one with my name on it?\nPhoenix:\nAny idea why she...\nMaya:\nAbsolutely none! Um... Do you trust me?\n\n\n\nI trust you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI trust you.\nMaya:\nWhy? Don't you think I did it, too?\nPhoenix:\nNo, I don't. (It's just a hunch, but...)\nMaya:\nThat detective thinks I did it.\nPhoenix:\n...\nLeads back to Court Record\n\n\n\n\nI don't trust you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nI didn't think you'd believe me. You're just like the detective.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it! (She seemed so lost at the crime scene.)\nLeads back to Court Record\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya's Memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about your cell phone...\nMaya:\nThat detective took it when they brought me in.\nPhoenix:\n(So, Gumshoe took it... I'll have to try to get it back next time I see him...)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSorry... I've never seen that before.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:\n... Um...!Phoenix:\nHuh? Something the matter?Maya:\nUm... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor?Phoenix:\n...?Maya:\nThis is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me?Phoenix:\n(Hmm...)Accept\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSure, why not? I'll go ask.\nMaya:\nThank you so much! I have no one else to turn to...\nPhoenix:\n...? Say, what about your parents...?\nMaya:\n... ... ...\nPhoenix:\nI... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me.\nMaya:\nThank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00.\nPhoenix:\nW-what!? Tomorrow!?\nMaya:\nTomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nWhat if this guy refuses!?\nLeads to:\n\"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\"Refuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry... I think this is the kind of thing you should really do yourself.\nMaya:\n...You're right. ...\nPhoenix:\nSomething wrong?\nMaya:\nActually, I asked the police to contact him, and they tried calling a few times. Nobody could get a hold of him!\nPhoenix:\nThey couldn't find him?\nMaya:\nI have no one left to ask!\nPhoenix:\n...? Say, what about your parents...?\nMaya:\n... ... ...\nPhoenix:\nO-okay! Don't worry, I'll go ask him for you.\nMaya:\nY-you will? Thank you so much!\nPhoenix:\nI'm just worried what will happen if I can't find him.\nLeads to:\n\"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\"Maya:\nThey told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.Phoenix:\nWhen will that happen?Maya:\nThey're giving me until 4:00 this afternoon.Phoenix:\n(And visiting hours are almost up... I'd better hurry!) Right, I'll be back!September 6Fey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:\n(The office is filled with police officers. They're all busily searching for clues...)???:\nHey! You there! This is a crime scene, pal! No trespassing! Umm... Sorry, don't I know you from somewhere? Wait, you're that Butz guy, aren't you!Phoenix:\nNo, no, Phoenix Wright. (How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?)???:\nAh, guess I got the wrong name, Mr. Wright. Sorry 'bout that. That Butz guy, he was a killer! And you're no killer! Right?Phoenix:\n(He WAS proven innocent...) Umm... right. And you were...Detective Gumshoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... Gumshoe, wasn't it? Dick Gumshoe?\n???:\nRight! At your service. Hang on! That's Detective Gumshoe to you, pal!\nLeads to:\n\"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\"Detective Suedeshoes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... Suedeshoes, wasn't it?\n???:\nThat's me! Don't step on my blue suede shoes... Wait! That's a song, pal! My name's Dick Gumshoe... W-wait! That's Detective Gumshoe to you, pal!\nLeads to:\n\"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\"Detective Gumtree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... Gumtree, was it? Detective Gumtree?\n???:\nG-Gumtree...? Gum doesn't grow on trees, pal!

And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\"Gumshoe:\nAnyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...Police:\nHey, Dick! Get over here!Gumshoe:\nY-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick!Phoenix:\n(Whew! He thinks I'm Maya's lawyer...!)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is that Mia probably read all of these.\n\n\n\n\nHouseplant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia's favorite potted plant. I remember it had this bizarre name no one could ever remember.\n???:\n\"Cordyline stricta,\" pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Who was that!?)\n\n\n\n\nMia's desk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia's desk. Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia.\n\n\n\n\nMovie poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe sky is blue, and so am I... There's that hotel, right across the way.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy?\nGumshoe:\nHmm? You want to know the results, eh?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nNow don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all!\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nMia (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, Mia's death was instantaneous.\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.\nPhoenix:\nYou knew her, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nSure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.\n\n\n\n\nMaya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, about Maya...\nGumshoe:\nYeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!\nPhoenix:\nW-why do you say that?\nGumshoe:\nThe city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nI'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth (appears after \"Maya\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nProsecutor Edgeworth...\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?\n\n\n\nOf course I do!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his \"guilty\" verdict.\nGumshoe:\nAww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.\nPhoenix:\n(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)\nLeads to:\n\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"\n\n\n\n\nOf course not!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNever heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nWhoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!\nPhoenix:\n(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a \"guilty\" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)\nLeads to:\n\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering, do you know anything about this?\nGumshoe:\nThat statue? That's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)\n\n\n\n\nGlass Shards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere was broken glass at the crime scene, right?\nGumshoe:\nHmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.\n\n\n\n\nReceipt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure that Mia wrote it herself?\nGumshoe:\nGiven the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.\nPhoenix:\n(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)\n\n\n\n\nMaya's Memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?\nGumshoe:\nOh that? I have that.\nPhoenix:\nDo you think you could give it back?\nGumshoe:\nSure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)\n\n\n\nTell him straight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)\nGumshoe:\nSomething the matter?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!\nGumshoe:\nNope. I know nothing, pal!\nPhoenix:\nThat cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!\nGumshoe:\nUrk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!\nPhoenix:\nImpressive! You're quite the detective.\nGumshoe:\nUh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.\nLeads to:\n\"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\"\n\n\n\n\nTell him not-so-straight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?)\nGumshoe:\nSomething the matter?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone...\nGumshoe:\nThis? Hmm... it says \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo\"... \"The Steel Samurai\"... that action hero on TV?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct.\nGumshoe:\nThat what she said?\nPhoenix:\nUm. Yes.\nGumshoe:\n... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway. Here you go.\nLeads to:\n\"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)\nMaya's Cell Phone received from Detective Gumshoe.

When it comes to dealing with lawyers, \"fight fair and square,\" is our motto!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know how I feel, seeing everything written up like this... It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.)\n\n\n\n\nMaya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHmm? What's that? Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you!After clearing \"Mia\" and \"Maya\" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo:Phoenix:\n(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)Gumshoe:\nYou all done, pal?Phoenix:\nUm, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.Gumshoe:\nOh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!Phoenix:\n... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?Gumshoe:\nYeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:\n(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:\nAhah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:\n(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.Gumshoe:\nYou got that right, pal!Phoenix:\n(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)September 6Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:\n(According to the receptionist, the big boss is \"out\". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nExpensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.\n\n\n\n\nPainting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.\n\n\n\n\nPotted plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Maya:\nHey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?Phoenix:\nSorry. I haven't seen him yet.Maya:\nI see...Phoenix:\n(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour family\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about your family?\nMaya:\nI only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.\nPhoenix:\n(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)\n\n\n\n\nYour mother (appears after \"Your family\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Ruined\"...?)\nMaya:\nAfter that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would \"become a lawyer\" and she left the mountain.\nPhoenix:\n... So, you live by yourself?\nMaya:\nYes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)\n\n\n\n\nYour mother's enemy (appears after \"Your mother\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, who was this man who, um, \"ruined\" your mother?\nMaya:\nAbout 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...\nPhoenix:\nWait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?\nMaya:\nThe police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.\nPhoenix:\nWow... So, what happened?\nMaya:\nThe case was solved... we thought.\nPhoenix:\nYou \"thought\"...?\nMaya:\nThe man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nMaya:\nThe police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.\nPhoenix:\nI see.\nMaya:\n... White...\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me? White?\nMaya:\nThat was his name. My sister told me.\nPhoenix:\nWhite? Hmm...Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHey, I got your cell phone back.\nMaya:\nOh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice?\n\n\nPhoenix:\n... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ...\n\n\nMaya:\nThank you.September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303April:\nWell! Hello there, handsome.Phoenix:\nUmm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)April:\nYou're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, \"Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!\" Tee hee!Phoenix:\n(Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.)April:\nGee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness!Phoenix:\n(I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here.\n\n\n\n\nFlowers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nOpen drawer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.)\"\n\n\n\n\nPainting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAh. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be \"still life\"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall.\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though.Phoenix:\n(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)April:\nHey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?Phoenix:\n(Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen drawer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... what's inside I wonder?)\nApril:\n*cough* *cough*\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe later...)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you witnessed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident.\nApril:\nOoh. \"Observe,\" \"incident\"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please?\nApril:\nLet me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy.)\n\n\n\n\nMiss May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, could you... just who exactly are you?\nApril:\nOooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me?\nPhoenix:\nN-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here!\nApril:\nTee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush.\nPhoenix:\n(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do?\nApril:\nWell... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy.)\n\n\n\n\nThis room\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you?\nApril:\nOooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television!\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer!\nApril:\nSay, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy.)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril:\nExcuse me, but I'm a witness? Police witness? You understand?

So, you're the one they say has been looking for me?Phoenix:\nUh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!)Grossberg:\nHmm...? That badge on your collar...?

Out with it!Phoenix:\nUm... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey.Grossberg:\n...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on.Phoenix:\n(Hmm? Why the strange reaction?)Grossberg:\nA-cha-cha.

A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion.Phoenix:\n(What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him!

She knew her sister would be in good hands.\nGrossberg:\nYes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye.\nPhoenix:\nCreep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.\nGrossberg:\n*grumble*... Think not.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Did you say something?\nGrossberg:\nI think not, I said.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what do you mean?\nGrossberg:\nI'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy.\nPhoenix:\nWhy!?\nGrossberg:\nI... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you.\nPhoenix:\n(What's going on here!?)\n\n\n\n\nMia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know Mia Fey...?\nGrossberg:\n... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see.\nPhoenix:\nA \"mission\"?\nGrossberg:\nYou could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one.\n\n\n\n\nThat painting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's... quite a painting.\nGrossberg:\nAhah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!\nPhoenix:\n(I wasn't interested...)\nGrossberg:\nIt's not for sale!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not buying!

That's so kind of you... *sniff*... ...Phoenix:\nWell! Let's fight this one and get you out of here!Maya:\nR-right! Thank you!Phoenix:\n(Whew, she smiled at last. She looks like an entirely different person!) One last question... You are innocent, right?Maya:\nYes! And I trust you... So you trust me, too, okay?Phoenix:\nIt's a deal. (So, what next... There's something that's been bugging me... Just what was inside that strange woman's drawer? It was when I tried to look into the drawer that she got all defensive. There has to be something in there!)Gatewater HotelBellboy:\nGood afternoon, sir!Phoenix:\nExcuse me, you are...?Bellboy:\nAh, I beg your pardon, sir! I am the bellboy of this establishment, at your service, sir.Phoenix:\nOh, right.Bellboy:\nI've just come up to deliver room service, sir.Phoenix:\nUm... do you know where Miss May might be?Bellboy:\nAh. I believe our guest Miss May is currently using the, er, facilities...? If you've no need of anything, I'll be taking my leave. Please, stay as long as you like. Enjoy...Phoenix:\nYeah... Wait... no! Hey! ... (Why does it seem like every time I come here, I end up embarrassing myself? Wait... now's my chance to snoop around a bit!)Bellboy:\nAh, I almost forgot!Phoenix:\nGah! Y-you came back quick!Bellboy:\nMight I ask you to inform Miss May that there is a message for her? Please tell her that Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned.Phoenix:\nOh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?)Maya:\nWhite... That was his name. My sister told me.Phoenix:\n(\"White\" was the name of the guy who ruined Mia and Maya's mother!

What would a woman like her be doing with a thing like this?Wiretap added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nThere is definitely something suspicious about this \"Miss May\"! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean.April:\nOh, bellboy...? Still there?Phoenix:\n(Uh oh, time to scram!

(Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:\nThank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:\nIf we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:\nWitness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:\nSir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nVery well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:\nAnd the cause of death?Gumshoe:\nLoss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of \"The Thinker\" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:\nThe court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:\n(They're still calling it a \"statue\"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nNow, Detective...Gumshoe:\nY-yes sir!Edgeworth:\nYou immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:\nHmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this \"hard evidence.\"Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!\nThere were two people there already:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!\nWhy? We had a witness account describing her!\nThe witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:\nHmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:\n(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:\nSomething the matter?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho did you say you got a call from?\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:\nThere were two people there already:Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?\nGumshoe:\nHmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!\nPhoenix:\nTh-that's pretty fast!\nGumshoe:\nOur motto this month is \"quick response\"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.\nGumshoe:\nYes sir!Gumshoe:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure it was us?\nGumshoe:\nListen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy's that? What's your reason?Gumshoe:\nWhy? We had a witness account describing her!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on just one second!\"Gumshoe:\nThe witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on just one second!\"Phoenix:\n(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)Phoenix:\nHold on just one second!Gumshoe:\nY-yeah?Phoenix:\nIf I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had \"hard evidence\" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:\nHuh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:\nI heard you say it!Judge:\nYou did say it.Edgeworth:\nYou said it.Phoenix:\nExactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was \"hard evidence\"!?Gumshoe:\nWh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:\nThat's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:\nUmm...Phoenix:\n(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:\n... Yes.Phoenix:\n(Gah!)Gumshoe:\nSorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:\nVery well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!\nOn it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!\nLab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!\nAlso, there was blood found on the victim's finger!\nBefore she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\nHow you like that? That's my \"hard evidence\"!Judge:\nHmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nY-Your Honor?Judge:\nWhy didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:\nAh... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:\nTry to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd did you find any evidence?\nGumshoe:\nNow, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)Gumshoe:\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nJust because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!\nGumshoe:\nHo hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?\nPhoenix:\nWh-who? Um...\n\n\n\nThe killer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nTh-the killer! Anyone can see that!\nGumshoe:\nHoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!\nPhoenix:\nShe was framed!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?\nPhoenix:\nAh... (Urk!)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...!)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\"\n\n\n\n\nMiss May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell... it could have been the witness, Miss May!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!\nGumshoe:\nYeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...!)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\"\n\n\n\n\nI did\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt... it could have been me!\nGumshoe:\nWhat! S-so it was you!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nEdgeworth:\nListen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!\nPhoenix:\n(...!)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Detective?

I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!\nJudge:\nYes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nTh-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe.\nGumshoe:\nY-yeah?\nEdgeworth:\nI think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.\nGumshoe:\nOh? Oh hoh hoh.\nPhoenix:\n(That was a mess...)\nGumshoe:\nRight!

Nice try!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh...

It happens all the time in books and the movies!\nPhoenix:\nThis isn't a movie, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nOof!\nPhoenix:\nLet's talk about reality, shall we?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.\nPhoenix:\nDon't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?\nGumshoe:\nAh, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nStop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!\nJudge:\nOrder!

What he said!Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Phoenix:\n(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?Gumshoe:\nWh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?Phoenix:\nYou have it backwards, Detective.Gumshoe:\nB-backwards?Phoenix:\nThe victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. \"Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object.\" She died immediately!Gumshoe:\nBut...!Phoenix:\nNo \"but\"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!Judge:\nOrder! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?Phoenix:\nWh-when...!?The day of the murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.\nGumshoe:\nYou're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!\nPhoenix:\nOh.

It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write \"Maya\"! That is all.Judge:\nI see!Phoenix:\n(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)Edgeworth:\nWhy, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?You're a sham, Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth...

This isn't good!)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!Judge:\nLet the witness Miss April May take the stand.Phoenix:\n(Exactly what part of her is \"innocent\"...?)Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name, please.April:\nApril May! At your service! *wink*Judge:\nOrder! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking!

She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)Edgeworth:\nTell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?April:\nUm... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.Edgeworth:\nAnd this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?April:\nMmm... that's right, big boy.Judge:\nPlease testify to the court about what you saw.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:\nIt was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!\nAnd then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!\nThe one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!\nThen the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!\nBut that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!\nThen the woman with long hair...\nShe kinda... slumped.\nThe end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWell, Your Honor?Judge:\nI see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...Phoenix:\nW-wait, Your Honor!Judge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nWhat about my cross-examination!?Judge:\nI thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...Phoenix:\nH-hey! How dare you!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?Yes, I'm doing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to!

That's it!?)\nJudge:\nVery well.\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! Hold on!\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?\nPhoenix:\nYes yes yes!

Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?\nEdgeworth:\nThere was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(He's right...)\n\n\n\nYep, he's right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Her testimony certainly does make sense...

You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!April:\n...!Phoenix:\nNo one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!April:\nBut... but!Judge:\nStill, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...Phoenix:\nShe was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?April:\nRowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.Judge:\nMiss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.April:\nI'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*Judge:\nYour testimony again, if you would.Phoenix:\n(Damn, I almost had her!)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:\nI did see everything! I did!\nThe victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.\nThen the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...\nAnd she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!\nThat... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think?\nWell? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee!Judge:\nI... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --April:\nI did see everything! I did!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you saw me then, too?\nApril:\nOf course! I'd remember that spiky hair anywhere!\nPhoenix:\n(Spiky...?)\nJudge:\nThe witness will refrain from personal attacks on the defense attorney.\nApril:\nAww, was I a bad girl? I'm sowwy.\nJudge:\nVery well... continue.April:\nThe victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs that \"right\" as in your right, as you looked from the hotel?\nApril:\nUm... which hand do I hold my knife in again...? Right! It was my right hand! Right?\nEdgeworth:\nSatisfied, Mr. Wright? Please continue.April:\nThen the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow convenient for you to remember her \"hippie\" clothes!\nApril:\nThat's what you--I mean, that's what she was wearing! Oh, and her hair was all done up like a bun!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh*...)\nJudge:\nWhat happened then?April:\nAnd she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhere did this weapon come from?\nApril:\nShe picked it up from the desk!\nJudge:\nI see. What sort of weapon was it?April:\nThat... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA... clock? (Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?)\nApril:\nW-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all.\nPhoenix:\n(No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!)Present The Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Miss May.\"Phoenix:\n(Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.)Phoenix:\nMiss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.April:\nRevealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...Phoenix:\nYou just said that this statue of \"The Thinker\" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!April:\nUrp!Phoenix:\nAnother person in much the same position as you recently called this a \"clock,\" too... And he was found guilty... of murder!Judge:\nOrder! Order!Phoenix:\nMiss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?April:\nOooh... urp!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThe witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!Judge:\nYes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)Judge:\n... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.Phoenix:\n(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)April:\nHuh? What? So... what happens now?Phoenix:\nWhat happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?April:\nWhat...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!Phoenix:\nSo, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!April:\nN-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!Edgeworth:\nThe law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!Judge:\nHmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...She couldn't have heard it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou have proof that she could not?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nEdgeworth:\nAmateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing.\nPhoenix:\nThen I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard...\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution denies your request!\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!? On what grounds?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Objection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!)\nJudge:\nReady to proceed, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"No, Your Honor!\"It couldn't have rung\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, members of the court...\"Phoenix:\nYour Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!It's empty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat clock is missing its clockwork!\nJudge:\nH-how could you possibly...?\nPhoenix:\nJust have a look... Right now! (Changed from [Just have a look... As soon as you can!] in the original release)\nJudge:\n... Oh!\nPhoenix:\nSee anything interesting, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nIt is as the defense says!\nLeads to:\n\"This clock is missing its clockwork!\"It's broken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think it's broken! That clock's busted!\nJudge:\nYou \"think\"?\nPhoenix:\nJ-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock!\nJudge:\nHmm... Oh!\nPhoenix:\nSee anything interesting, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell, I'm not sure I would call this \"broken,\" but I doubt it could ring...!\nLeads to:\n\"This clock is missing its clockwork!\"The batteries are dead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe batteries on that clock must be dead!\nJudge:\n\"Must be,\" Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, if you would inspect the clock...!\nJudge:\nHmm... very well. ... Oh!\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor? Are they...?\nJudge:\nThis clock has graver problems than dead batteries!\nLeads to:\n\"This clock is missing its clockwork!\"Judge:\nThis clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?Phoenix:\nIt is as you can see. The \"clock\" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!April:\nF-fat!?Phoenix:\nWell, Miss May?Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk.Phoenix:\n?Edgeworth:\nQuite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)Edgeworth:\nI'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!Judge:\n! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.Edgeworth:\nAnd that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?Edgeworth:\nHo hoh! Impossible, of course...Phoenix:\nI have proof.Edgeworth:\nW-what!?Phoenix:\nWasn't it you who told me \"proof is everything\"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the \"proof\" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...Present Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Take a look at this!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you say to that?\nApril:\nW-what? I don't rightly understand what that's supposed to mean!\nJudge:\nI don't rightly understand either.\nEdgeworth:\nHo hoh!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... I think I blew it.)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future.\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor!\nLeads back to:\n\"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...\"Phoenix:\nTake a look at this!Judge:\nHmm. That's a very cute cell phone.April:\nOoh hoo! You have a girlie phone!Phoenix:\nW-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!Judge:\nOrder! Order!Edgeworth:\nThe defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!Phoenix:\nPerhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?Edgeworth:\n*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)Phoenix:\n(I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.) (Changed from [My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.] in the original release) Let's hear the conversation.Cellular:*beep*...Maya:\n[So you just want me to hold on to \"The Thinker\" for you, then?]Mia:\n[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]Maya:\n[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]Mia:\n[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]...[September 5, 9:27 AM]Cellular:*beep*Phoenix:\nYour Honor, I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded, (Changed from [I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone...] in the original release) which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel! (Changed from [and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!] in the original release)April:\nMuh... muh... muh!?Phoenix:\nWell, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?April:\n... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*Judge:\nSo the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?Yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\"No\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!)\nJudge:\nThen, the court would like--\nPhoenix:\nHold on! P-please wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nY-yes...? So you do have an objection?\nPhoenix:\nUm, yes, well...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Your Honor, it's just...\nLeads to:\n\"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\"Phoenix:\nThe witness claims she had \"seen it before.\" But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!Judge:\nWell then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.Present The Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's simple.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere is undeniable proof!\nEdgeworth:\nHah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece!\nJudge:\nHmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind?\nLeads back to:\n\"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.\"Phoenix:\nIt's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!April:\nW-whaaat!?Phoenix:\nA friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!April:\nI-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!Phoenix:\nMiss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?April:\nMmpf...Phoenix:\nOh? Excuses not on sale today?April:\nOooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!Judge:\nW-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!April:\nHrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*Phoenix:\n(S-scary...)Judge:\nMiss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?April:\n...Judge:\nHmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?Phoenix:\n(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...You held it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! When was this!?\nPhoenix:\nWhen she used it to strike the victim! When else?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nApril May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made \"The Thinker\" ring! That's when you heard it!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\nW-what's that supposed to mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt was you who just proved that \"The Thinker\" was empty!\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(S-she can't prove it! She did it!)\nApril:\nIt would be MY pleasure!\nPhoenix:\nN-no way!\nApril:\nYes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!\nEdgeworth:\nIncidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know \"The Thinker\" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!\nJudge:\nWell... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that already.\nPhoenix:\nTake another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]\nMia:\n[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]\nMaya:\n[Again? What's it this time?]\nMia:\n[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!]\n\n...\n\nJudge:\nThey do mention \"The Thinker.\" But how would the witness know of this conversation?

I can't afford any mistakes now!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Your evidence, please!\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave a look at this.\nApril:\nAh! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...\nPhoenix:\nI found this in Miss May's room.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!\nPhoenix:\nMiss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!?\nApril:\nI... I...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is ridiculous!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.\nApril:\nLa... laaa... lrrrrgf!\nJudge:\nWitness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?\nApril:\n...\nJudge:\nMiss May!\nApril:\nShut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!\n......\nApril:\nI-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\n(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)\n\n\n\nYou did it, didn't you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMiss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?\nApril:\nAre you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\"\n\n\n\n\nWhy the wiretap?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMiss May... Why did you tap her phone?\nApril:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nApril:\nDo I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?\nPhoenix:\n(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"!\nJudge:\nWhile this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?\nApril:\nAt the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her?

You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?\nApril:\nOooh. Oooooh!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, This is irrelevant!\nJudge:\nI'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.\nEdgeworth:\nThis is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?\nPhoenix:\nAbsolutely!\nEdgeworth:\nEven if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWHAAAAT!?\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I present the defendant's cell phone.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis! I think...\nJudge:\nThat's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! That was just a warm up!\nJudge:\nHmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI present the defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that.\nPhoenix:\nListen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia!

A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops!\nPhoenix:\nSo you admit you tapped her phone!\nApril:\nHeh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder!

On with the cross-examination.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)\nJudge:\nThen I believe the cross-examination is over.

You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...Bellboy:\nI believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was Miss May on the phone?\nBellboy:\nAbsolutely, sir.\nPhoenix:\nH-how can you be so certain!?\nBellboy:\nI checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir.\nJudge:\nYes, what then?Bellboy:\nShe asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n9:00 \"on the dot,\" you say?\nBellboy:\nYes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(9:00... the time of the murder!)Bellboy:\nI brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Precisely\" 9:00, then?\nBellboy:\nPrecisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM.\nPhoenix:\nHow can you be so sure!?\nBellboy:\nMiss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. \"Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!\" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Why would she be so particular about the time?)Bellboy:\nAnd I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou are sure it was Miss April May herself?\nBellboy:\nAb-SO-lutely, sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Ab-SO-lutely\"...?\nBellboy:\nYes, sir. As in, \"so very absolutely,\" sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.\nPhoenix:\nHow come you're so very certain!?\nBellboy:\nWell, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an \"embrasser,\" sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Embrasser\"!? Is that French for \"embrace\"?\nBellboy:\nIt's French for \"kiss,\" sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.\nPhoenix:\nWh-why would she have done that...?\nBellboy:\nI believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)Phoenix:\n(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)After pressing fourth and fifth statements:Phoenix:\n... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now...

This charade of justice has gone on long enough!Judge:\nNow, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all.Phoenix:\n(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)Check-in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nT-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May.\nBellboy:\nOh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really.\nPhoenix:\nI see...¬†? Excuse me... what exactly was a \"disappointment\"?\nBellboy:\nWell, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there.\nPhoenix:\n(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?\nBellboy:\nAh! Oh... er... rather, quite!\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Room service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nT-tell me again about er... room service!\nBellboy:\nA-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall.\nPhoenix:\nI see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?\nBellboy:\nY-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?\nBellboy:\nAh! Oh... er... rather, quite!\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Bed making\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day.\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question.\nBellboy:\nYes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see.\nPhoenix:\nI see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say?\nBellboy:\nEh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir?\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Edgeworth:\nI object! That was... objectionable!Judge:\n... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.Bellboy:\nEr... yes, I see.Phoenix:\nWhy did you not mention this in your testimony!?Bellboy:\nW-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!Phoenix:\n(Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!Bellboy:\nAh, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...Phoenix:\n!Bellboy:\nHe asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.Edgeworth:\nOof! Y-you fool!Phoenix:\nI've done it... I've won!Phoenix:\nMiss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?Bellboy:\nYes, sir.Phoenix:\nThen, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?Bellboy:\nThat's right, sir.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nYour Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nAnd who, Mr. Wright! Who is this \"other person\"!

I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!Edgeworth:\nOof! Upstart... amateur...!

I promise.Maya:\nI'm counting on you!Phoenix:\nI asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that hasn't been stricken from the record.

I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nThat's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Maya Fey...\n\nGuilty\n\nJudge:\nThe accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date.

That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this!Phoenix:\n(What does he mean by that?)White:\nNo matter. So, what business does a \"mighty\" lawyer have with a man such as myself?Phoenix:\n(Yipes! This guy's arrogance meter is off the scale!)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my...

The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White.\nWhite:\nTruly a work of art!

What a shock it was to hear what she has done!\nPhoenix:\n\"What she has done\"... You mean the wiretap?\nWhite:\nIndeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods! It is ineffable that she would do this.\nPhoenix:\n(It sounds like he's trying to turn Miss May into a scapegoat...)\n\n\n\n\nNight of the murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOn the night of the murder were you in April May's hotel room?\nWhite:\nWho can say? I seldom pay attention to mundane details such as time and place. My motto is: \"Don't worry, be happy!\"\nPhoenix:\nStill, Mr. White... The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly.\nWhite:\n... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have \"seen\" the same thing as April May!)\nWhite:\nOh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement!\n\n\n\n\nBluecorp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway?\nWhite:\nAh, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future!\nPhoenix:\n(Sell... information?)\nWhite:\nIn just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color \"blue\"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not?\n\n\n\n\nThat painting (appears after \"Miss May\" and \"Night of the murder\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUh... there's something that's been bothering me.\nWhite:\nYes? What might that be?\nPhoenix:\nThat big painting on the wall over there...\n\n\n\nIt's gorgeous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a very striking piece of art.\nWhite:\nMagnificentatious, isn't it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah. ...

Er, rather, my question is simple: Why is that painting hanging on your wall?\nLeads to:\n\"...\"\n\n\n\n\nWhen did you get it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSay, when did you get that painting?\nWhite:\n...

Bad, bad girl.\nPhoenix:\nShe testified that she placed the wiretap at your request.\nWhite:\nHow pathetic. I guess she's trying to pass the buck. Bad, bad girl. Sorry I can't help you.

That's a picture of me! Ah, I see it was taken in the prime of my youth. About 10 years ago, at a guess.\nPhoenix:\nThe hotel bellboy says he saw this man on the night of the murder.\nWhite:\n... On closer inspection, he does look a lot like me, but I'm afraid this is someone else. Nope. That's definitely not me. He's far too young.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite:\nI am terribly sorry. But that really doesn't seem to concern me at all.White:\n...

A \"mere\" lawyer. Worth nothing. Zilch. Zippo. Nada! Just like that sorry excuse for an attorney, Grodyburger!Phoenix:\n(Wh-what!?) Ungh! Oof...! Unh... uhhh... (He... he punched me!)White:\nWell, Mr. Lawyer. What will you do, eh? Charge me with assault? Charge away, I welcome it! For it is YOU who will be found guilty!Phoenix:\nWhat...?White:\nHeed my exposition! The police, the courts, they all do my bidding.Phoenix:\n(So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?)White:\nI don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?Phoenix:\nMr. Grossberg's... yes.White:\nThen you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you?

I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl.\n\n\n\n\nYour refusal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense?

White would have destroyed me if I did.Phoenix:\n(So that's the connection!)Grossberg:\nIt is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.Phoenix:\nImpossible? Why!?Grossberg:\nHe has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Grossberg:\nThey are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that.

It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium.\nPhoenix:\n(A medium...?)\nGrossberg:\nHer name was Misty Fey.\nPhoenix:\n(Fey!)\nGrossberg:\nIndeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud.\nPhoenix:\n(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)\nGrossberg:\nI did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident.\n\n\n\n\nReason for blackmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBut why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?\nGrossberg:\nThe DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.\nPhoenix:\nYou told White?\nGrossberg:\nHe offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail.\nPhoenix:\n... I see.\nGrossberg:\n... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office.\nPhoenix:\nMia's office...?\nGrossberg:\nShe followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found.Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Reason for blackmail\" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices)Phoenix:\nIt's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAll the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here.

Hmmm... Should I take a look?\n\n\n\nRead it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press.

Then, when you revealed it, he was driven to suicide!\nWhite:\nMr. Lawyer. I know nothing of this. And, even in the highly unlikely event that I did do such a thing...

You are a mere lawyer! As was Miss Mia.Phoenix:\nHow dare you!White:\nI'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled.

I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally.\nPhoenix:\nAre you always so... so prim?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...Bellboy:\nI believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was Miss May on the phone?\nBellboy:\nAbsolutely, sir.\nPhoenix:\nH-how can you be so certain!?\nBellboy:\nI checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir.\nJudge:\nYes, what then?Bellboy:\nShe asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n9:00 \"on the dot,\" you say?\nBellboy:\nYes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(9:00... the time of the murder!)Bellboy:\nI brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Precisely\" 9:00, then?\nBellboy:\nPrecisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM.\nPhoenix:\nHow can you be so sure!?\nBellboy:\nMiss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. \"Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!\" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Why would she be so particular about the time?)Bellboy:\nAnd I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou are sure it was Miss April May herself?\nBellboy:\nAb-SO-lutely, sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Ab-SO-lutely\"...?\nBellboy:\nYes, sir. As in, \"so very absolutely,\" sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.\nPhoenix:\nHow come you're so very certain!?\nBellboy:\nWell, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an \"embrasser,\" sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Embrasser\"!? Is that French for \"embrace\"?\nBellboy:\nIt's French for \"kiss,\" sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.\nPhoenix:\nWh-why would she have done that...?\nBellboy:\nI believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)Phoenix:\n(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)After pressing fourth and fifth statements:Phoenix:\n... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now...

My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really.\nPhoenix:\nI see...¬†? Excuse me... what exactly was a \"disappointment\"?\nBellboy:\nWell, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there.\nPhoenix:\n(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?\nBellboy:\nAh! Oh... er... rather, quite!\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object!

The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall.\nPhoenix:\nI see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?\nBellboy:\nY-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?\nBellboy:\nAh! Oh... er... rather, quite!\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Bed making\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day.\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question.\nBellboy:\nYes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see.\nPhoenix:\nI see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say?\nBellboy:\nEh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir?\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Edgeworth:\nI object! That was... objectionable!Judge:\n... Objection overruled.

That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!Bellboy:\nAh, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...Phoenix:\n!Bellboy:\nHe asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.Edgeworth:\nOof! Y-you fool!Phoenix:\nI've done it... I've won!Phoenix:\nMiss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?Bellboy:\nYes, sir.Phoenix:\nThen, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?Bellboy:\nThat's right, sir.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nYour Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nAnd who, Mr. Wright! Who is this \"other person\"!

This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder!\nApril:\nNo! No, that's not right.\nPhoenix:\n(Nice try, Miss Cooperative.)\nApril:\nD-do you have proof that was him? Hmm?

Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.Bellboy:\nNo, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's \"rep,\" as they say.Phoenix:\nHuh? \"Rep\"?Bellboy:\nYes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir!Phoenix:\nWhoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder.Bellboy:\nI, too, will become famous! \"The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee\"...!Phoenix:\n(Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...)Bellboy:\nSo!

There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer!\nBellboy:\nAh, please leave that as it is, sir.

I call it: \"The last drink... before murder!\" We'll be famous! The talk of the hotel industry!\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNice weather again today. I can see the Fey & Co.

He struck me as a real \"Lady Killer,\" if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger.\nPhoenix:\n(There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.)\nBellboy:\nIf you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him.\nPhoenix:\n(A photo. Hmm...)\n\n\n\n\nThe hotel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about this hotel?\nBellboy:\nAbsolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir!

Right.)\n\n\n\n\nPhotograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this photo.\nBellboy:\n... That's him, Detective.\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm the lawyer.\nBellboy:\nOh, I know that! I just wanted to say \"Detective\" once. You know how it is.\nPhoenix:\n(No. No I don't.)\nBellboy:\nWithout a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him!\nPhoenix:\nAn affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...)\n\n\n\nHave him write it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, sure. Why not?\nBellboy:\nYes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as \"The Bellboy who swore the affidavit\"!

Perhaps I have intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary...?Phoenix:\n(What is this guy's problem!)White:\nI'm Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You know, Corporate Expansion Official? My business dealings bring me into contact with the elite of the elite. So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged.Phoenix:\n(What a fruitcake!)White:\nHmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this!Phoenix:\n(What does he mean by that?)White:\nNo matter.

What a shock it was to hear what she has done!\nPhoenix:\n\"What she has done\"... You mean the wiretap?\nWhite:\nIndeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods!

The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly.\nWhite:\n... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have \"seen\" the same thing as April May!)\nWhite:\nOh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement!\n\n\n\n\nBluecorp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway?\nWhite:\nAh, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future!\nPhoenix:\n(Sell... information?)\nWhite:\nIn just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color \"blue\"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not?\n\n\n\n\nThat painting (appears after \"Miss May\" and \"Night of the murder\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUh... there's something that's been bothering me.\nWhite:\nYes?

On closer inspection, he does look a lot like me, but I'm afraid this is someone else. Nope. That's definitely not me.

Is that kind of control really possible?)White:\nI don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?Phoenix:\nMr. Grossberg's... yes.White:\nThen you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you?

White would have destroyed me if I did.Phoenix:\n(So that's the connection!)Grossberg:\nIt is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.Phoenix:\nImpossible? Why!?Grossberg:\nHe has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Grossberg:\nThey are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that.

It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium.\nPhoenix:\n(A medium...?)\nGrossberg:\nHer name was Misty Fey.\nPhoenix:\n(Fey!)\nGrossberg:\nIndeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud.\nPhoenix:\n(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)\nGrossberg:\nI did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident.\n\n\n\n\nReason for blackmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBut why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?\nGrossberg:\nThe DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.\nPhoenix:\nYou told White?\nGrossberg:\nHe offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail.\nPhoenix:\n... I see.\nGrossberg:\n... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office.\nPhoenix:\nMia's office...?\nGrossberg:\nShe followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found.Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Reason for blackmail\" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices)Phoenix:\nIt's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAll the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here.

Hmmm... Should I take a look?\n\n\n\nRead it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press.

I do not believe you are in a position to freely offer your opinions to me, correct? I'm telling you to send the police, now!Interphone:*beep*White:\n... Did I not tell you, Mr. Wrong? You are a mere lawyer! As was Miss Mia.Phoenix:\nHow dare you!White:\nI'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled. No lawyer of any worth will defend you. I have friends in the local lawyer's association, you see. You'll be given a lawyer so stupendously inept that they make even you look competent.Phoenix:\n(I... I feel faint.)Gumshoe:\nDetective Gumshoe, reporting, sir! Aaa! Butz! Hairy Butz!Phoenix:\nWright, actually. Phoenix Wright. And my friend's name is \"Larry\"...Gumshoe:\nOh, right! Sorry, pal. Butz was that murderer, right?White:\nDetective Gumshoe.

White's going to set a trap for me. And the prosecution will be in on it, of course. Edgeworth, included. An attorney was assigned to me by the state, yesterday. I refused. I had an idea.Maya:\n... Wright! Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nOh, Maya! Great, they let you out of detention.Maya:\nJust now, yes. It's all thanks to you!Phoenix:\nHah. Now I'm afraid we've switched places.Maya:\nWhat? You mean, you...?Phoenix:\nI explained what had happened to Maya. ...Maya:\nI don't believe it! How many people does that man need to destroy before he's satisfied!? My mother... My sister... And now you! This has gone too far! Mr. Wright, please tell me, is there anything I can do?Phoenix:\nUm... well...Defend me in court\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAlright, you can be my defense lawyer tomorrow!\nMaya:\nAlright!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nLeave it to me!

It's good to know you're on my side. (And there really isn't anything you can do for me anyway...)Maya:\nBut... but I can't just sit here and do nothing! I've got to give that man a piece of my mind!Phoenix:\n(Just a piece...?) Okay. Then, come to the court tomorrow.Maya:\nO-okay! I'll be there! I'll show them a thing or two!Phoenix:\nTimes may change, yet with crime it's the same old story. (Changed from [It's the beginning of a new century, yet with crime it's the same old story.] in the original release) In fact, it's gotten worse. Lengthy court proceedings are no longer realistic. Beginning a few years ago, a limit of three days was put on initial court trials. Almost all finish in a day. Most with a guilty verdict. I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself for this case. (Changed from [I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself.] in the original release) With the true culprit appearing as the star witness. (Changed from [Tomorrow the true culprit will appear as a witness.] in the original release) This is it! Tomorrow, it's me or him! (Changed from [This is it!

Edgeworth.)Edgeworth:\nI received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.Phoenix:\n?Edgeworth:\nHe told me that whatever Mr. White says today, it will be the \"absolute truth.\" No matter how you try to attack his testimony... If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.Phoenix:\n(What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?) So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?Edgeworth:\n... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.Maya:\nWhy... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?Edgeworth:\n\"Innocent\"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared \"guilty\"! So I make that my policy.Phoenix:\nEdgeworth... You've changed.Maya:\nHmm? Phoenix! You know him!?Edgeworth:\nDon't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.Maya:\nPh-Phoenix...?Phoenix:\nWell... court will be starting soon.

Are you sure you're up to doing this?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.Judge:\nUnderstood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nAs the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of a witness to the defendant's crime. (Changed from [today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.] in the original release)Judge:\nI see. The prosecution may call its witness.Phoenix:\n(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)Objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court.\nJudge:\nExcellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Great.

You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?White:\nCorrect.Edgeworth:\nAnd you witnessed the murder from there?White:\nAhem. Why tell you what you already know?Judge:\nVery well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)White:\nHo hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:\n...!Maya:\nLet him have it, Phoenix!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --White:\nLet's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.\nI was quietly perusifying... er, that's \"reading\" to you, some papers by the window.\nThen I heard a bedlam coming from outside!\nSurprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.\nIt was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!\nNeedless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!\nI called Miss May over at once.

Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!\nPhoenix:\nW-why do you say that?\nGumshoe:\nThe city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nI'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth (appears after \"Maya\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nProsecutor Edgeworth...\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?\n\n\n\nOf course I do!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his \"guilty\" verdict.\nGumshoe:\nAww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.\nPhoenix:\n(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)\nLeads to:\n\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"\n\n\n\n\nOf course not!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNever heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nWhoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!\nPhoenix:\n(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a \"guilty\" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)\nLeads to:\n\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering, do you know anything about this?\nGumshoe:\nThat statue? That's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)\n\n\n\n\nGlass Shards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere was broken glass at the crime scene, right?\nGumshoe:\nHmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.\n\n\n\n\nReceipt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure that Mia wrote it herself?\nGumshoe:\nGiven the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.\nPhoenix:\n(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)\n\n\n\n\nMaya's Memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?\nGumshoe:\nOh that? I have that.\nPhoenix:\nDo you think you could give it back?\nGumshoe:\nSure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)\n\n\n\nTell him straight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)\nGumshoe:\nSomething the matter?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!\nGumshoe:\nNope. I know nothing, pal!\nPhoenix:\nThat cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!\nGumshoe:\nUrk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!\nPhoenix:\nImpressive! You're quite the detective.\nGumshoe:\nUh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.\nLeads to:\n\"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\"\n\n\n\n\nTell him not-so-straight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?)\nGumshoe:\nSomething the matter?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone...\nGumshoe:\nThis? Hmm... it says \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo\"... \"The Steel Samurai\"... that action hero on TV?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct.\nGumshoe:\nThat what she said?\nPhoenix:\nUm. Yes.\nGumshoe:\n... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway. Here you go.\nLeads to:\n\"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)\nMaya's Cell Phone received from Detective Gumshoe.

When it comes to dealing with lawyers, \"fight fair and square,\" is our motto!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know how I feel, seeing everything written up like this... It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.)\n\n\n\n\nMaya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHmm? What's that? Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you!After clearing \"Mia\" and \"Maya\" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo:Phoenix:\n(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)Gumshoe:\nYou all done, pal?Phoenix:\nUm, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.Gumshoe:\nOh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!Phoenix:\n... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?Gumshoe:\nYeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:\n(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:\nAhah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:\n(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.Gumshoe:\nYou got that right, pal!Phoenix:\n(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)September 6Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:\n(According to the receptionist, the big boss is \"out\". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nExpensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.\n\n\n\n\nPainting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.\n\n\n\n\nPotted plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Maya:\nHey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?Phoenix:\nSorry. I haven't seen him yet.Maya:\nI see...Phoenix:\n(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour family\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about your family?\nMaya:\nI only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.\nPhoenix:\n(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)\n\n\n\n\nYour mother (appears after \"Your family\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Ruined\"...?)\nMaya:\nAfter that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would \"become a lawyer\" and she left the mountain.\nPhoenix:\n... So, you live by yourself?\nMaya:\nYes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)\n\n\n\n\nYour mother's enemy (appears after \"Your mother\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, who was this man who, um, \"ruined\" your mother?\nMaya:\nAbout 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...\nPhoenix:\nWait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?\nMaya:\nThe police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.\nPhoenix:\nWow... So, what happened?\nMaya:\nThe case was solved... we thought.\nPhoenix:\nYou \"thought\"...?\nMaya:\nThe man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nMaya:\nThe police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.\nPhoenix:\nI see.\nMaya:\n... White...\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me? White?\nMaya:\nThat was his name. My sister told me.\nPhoenix:\nWhite? Hmm...Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHey, I got your cell phone back.\nMaya:\nOh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice?\n\n\nPhoenix:\n... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ...\n\n\nMaya:\nThank you.September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303April:\nWell! Hello there, handsome.Phoenix:\nUmm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)April:\nYou're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, \"Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!\" Tee hee!Phoenix:\n(Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.)April:\nGee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness!Phoenix:\n(I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here.\n\n\n\n\nFlowers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nOpen drawer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.)\"\n\n\n\n\nPainting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAh.

Somebody must be staying with her.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though.Phoenix:\n(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)April:\nHey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?Phoenix:\n(Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen drawer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... what's inside I wonder?)\nApril:\n*cough* *cough*\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe later...)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you witnessed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident.\nApril:\nOoh. \"Observe,\" \"incident\"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please?\nApril:\nLet me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy.)\n\n\n\n\nMiss May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, could you... just who exactly are you?\nApril:\nOooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me?\nPhoenix:\nN-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here!\nApril:\nTee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush.\nPhoenix:\n(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do?\nApril:\nWell... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy.)\n\n\n\n\nThis room\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you?\nApril:\nOooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television!\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer!\nApril:\nSay, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy.)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril:\nExcuse me, but I'm a witness? Police witness? You understand?

So, you're the one they say has been looking for me?Phoenix:\nUh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!)Grossberg:\nHmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now?Phoenix:\nY-yes, well... yes.Grossberg:\nAnd what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed!Phoenix:\n(Not busy...?

Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see!\nPhoenix:\nBut the client is Mia Fey's sister!\nGrossberg:\nHmm... ahem.\nPhoenix:\nMia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands.\nGrossberg:\nYes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye.\nPhoenix:\nCreep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.\nGrossberg:\n*grumble*... Think not.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Did you say something?\nGrossberg:\nI think not, I said.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what do you mean?\nGrossberg:\nI'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy.\nPhoenix:\nWhy!?\nGrossberg:\nI... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you.\nPhoenix:\n(What's going on here!?)\n\n\n\n\nMia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know Mia Fey...?\nGrossberg:\n... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see.\nPhoenix:\nA \"mission\"?\nGrossberg:\nYou could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one.\n\n\n\n\nThat painting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's... quite a painting.\nGrossberg:\nAhah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!\nPhoenix:\n(I wasn't interested...)\nGrossberg:\nIt's not for sale!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not buying! (Geez!)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrossberg:\nVery sorry, but I've got nothing to say regarding this matter.Fey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:\n...

The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:\nIf we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:\nWitness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:\nSir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nVery well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:\nAnd the cause of death?Gumshoe:\nLoss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of \"The Thinker\" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:\nThe court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:\n(They're still calling it a \"statue\"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nNow, Detective...Gumshoe:\nY-yes sir!Edgeworth:\nYou immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:\nHmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this \"hard evidence.\"Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!\nThere were two people there already:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!\nWhy? We had a witness account describing her!\nThe witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:\nHmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:\n(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:\nSomething the matter?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho did you say you got a call from?\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:\nThere were two people there already:Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?\nGumshoe:\nHmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!\nPhoenix:\nTh-that's pretty fast!\nGumshoe:\nOur motto this month is \"quick response\"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.\nGumshoe:\nYes sir!Gumshoe:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure it was us?\nGumshoe:\nListen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy's that? What's your reason?Gumshoe:\nWhy? We had a witness account describing her!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on just one second!\"Gumshoe:\nThe witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on just one second!\"Phoenix:\n(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)Phoenix:\nHold on just one second!Gumshoe:\nY-yeah?Phoenix:\nIf I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had \"hard evidence\" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:\nHuh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:\nI heard you say it!Judge:\nYou did say it.Edgeworth:\nYou said it.Phoenix:\nExactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was \"hard evidence\"!?Gumshoe:\nWh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:\nThat's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:\nUmm...Phoenix:\n(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:\n... Yes.Phoenix:\n(Gah!)Gumshoe:\nSorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:\nVery well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!\nOn it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!\nLab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!\nAlso, there was blood found on the victim's finger!\nBefore she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\nHow you like that? That's my \"hard evidence\"!Judge:\nHmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nY-Your Honor?Judge:\nWhy didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:\nAh... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:\nTry to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd did you find any evidence?\nGumshoe:\nNow, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)Gumshoe:\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nJust because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!\nGumshoe:\nHo hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?\nPhoenix:\nWh-who? Um...\n\n\n\nThe killer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nTh-the killer! Anyone can see that!\nGumshoe:\nHoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!\nPhoenix:\nShe was framed!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?\nPhoenix:\nAh... (Urk!)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...!)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\"\n\n\n\n\nMiss May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell... it could have been the witness, Miss May!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!\nGumshoe:\nYeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...!)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\"\n\n\n\n\nI did\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt... it could have been me!\nGumshoe:\nWhat! S-so it was you!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nEdgeworth:\nListen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!\nPhoenix:\n(...!)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Gumshoe:\nOn it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I do, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...)Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Gumshoe:\nLab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of \"tests\" were these again?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!\nJudge:\nYes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nTh-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe.\nGumshoe:\nY-yeah?\nEdgeworth:\nI think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.\nGumshoe:\nOh? Oh hoh hoh.\nPhoenix:\n(That was a mess...)\nGumshoe:\nRight! Where was I?Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Gumshoe:\nAlso, there was blood found on the victim's finger!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nOn which hand was the bloody finger, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThe right hand!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... she WAS right handed...)\nGumshoe:\nHah hah hah! Nice try!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... I guess it wasn't too hard to see what I was getting at there.)Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Gumshoe:\nBefore she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?\nGumshoe:\nSure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!\nPhoenix:\nThis isn't a movie, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nOof!\nPhoenix:\nLet's talk about reality, shall we?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.\nPhoenix:\nDon't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?\nGumshoe:\nAh, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nStop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!\nJudge:\nOrder!

What he said!Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Phoenix:\n(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?Gumshoe:\nWh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?Phoenix:\nYou have it backwards, Detective.Gumshoe:\nB-backwards?Phoenix:\nThe victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. \"Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object.\" She died immediately!Gumshoe:\nBut...!Phoenix:\nNo \"but\"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!Judge:\nOrder! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?Phoenix:\nWh-when...!?The day of the murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.\nGumshoe:\nYou're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!\nPhoenix:\nOh.

But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow.\" I received these results this morning.Phoenix:\nN-no way!Edgeworth:\nYour Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write \"Maya\"! That is all.Judge:\nI see!Phoenix:\n(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)Edgeworth:\nWhy, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?You're a sham, Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth...

The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.Judge:\nI suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.Phoenix:\n(Darn! This isn't good!)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!Judge:\nLet the witness Miss April May take the stand.Phoenix:\n(Exactly what part of her is \"innocent\"...?)Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name, please.April:\nApril May! At your service! *wink*Judge:\nOrder! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking!

She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)Edgeworth:\nTell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?April:\nUm... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.Edgeworth:\nAnd this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?April:\nMmm... that's right, big boy.Judge:\nPlease testify to the court about what you saw.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:\nIt was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!\nAnd then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!\nThe one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!\nThen the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!\nBut that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!\nThen the woman with long hair...\nShe kinda... slumped.\nThe end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWell, Your Honor?Judge:\nI see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...Phoenix:\nW-wait, Your Honor!Judge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nWhat about my cross-examination!?Judge:\nI thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...Phoenix:\nH-hey! How dare you!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?Yes, I'm doing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to!

I guess there wouldn't be much point.\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-what? That's it!?)\nJudge:\nVery well.\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! Hold on!\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?\nPhoenix:\nYes yes yes!

Were you expecting to see something?\nApril:\nOh, well, um... gee!\nPhoenix:\n(What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)\nApril:\nI sort of, y'know.

I will not have you badgering my witness!\nPhoenix:\nB-badgering?\nEdgeworth:\nYou insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed.\n(Yeah! Yeah!

Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?\nEdgeworth:\nThere was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(He's right...)\n\n\n\nYep, he's right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Her testimony certainly does make sense...

You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!April:\n...!Phoenix:\nNo one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her!

I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.Judge:\nMiss May.

What you said just now was quite... revealing.April:\nRevealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...Phoenix:\nYou just said that this statue of \"The Thinker\" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!April:\nUrp!Phoenix:\nAnother person in much the same position as you recently called this a \"clock,\" too... And he was found guilty... of murder!Judge:\nOrder! Order!Phoenix:\nMiss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?April:\nOooh... urp!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThe witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!Judge:\nYes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)Judge:\n... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.Phoenix:\n(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)April:\nHuh? What? So... what happens now?Phoenix:\nWhat happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?April:\nWhat...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!Phoenix:\nSo, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!April:\nN-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!Edgeworth:\nThe law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!Judge:\nHmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...She couldn't have heard it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou have proof that she could not?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nEdgeworth:\nAmateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing.\nPhoenix:\nThen I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard...\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution denies your request!\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!? On what grounds?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Objection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!)\nJudge:\nReady to proceed, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"No, Your Honor!\"It couldn't have rung\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, members of the court...\"Phoenix:\nYour Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!It's empty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat clock is missing its clockwork!\nJudge:\nH-how could you possibly...?\nPhoenix:\nJust have a look... Right now! (Changed from [Just have a look... As soon as you can!] in the original release)\nJudge:\n... Oh!\nPhoenix:\nSee anything interesting, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nIt is as the defense says!\nLeads to:\n\"This clock is missing its clockwork!\"It's broken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think it's broken! That clock's busted!\nJudge:\nYou \"think\"?\nPhoenix:\nJ-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock!\nJudge:\nHmm... Oh!\nPhoenix:\nSee anything interesting, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell, I'm not sure I would call this \"broken,\" but I doubt it could ring...!\nLeads to:\n\"This clock is missing its clockwork!\"The batteries are dead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe batteries on that clock must be dead!\nJudge:\n\"Must be,\" Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, if you would inspect the clock...!\nJudge:\nHmm... very well. ... Oh!\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor? Are they...?\nJudge:\nThis clock has graver problems than dead batteries!\nLeads to:\n\"This clock is missing its clockwork!\"Judge:\nThis clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?Phoenix:\nIt is as you can see. The \"clock\" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!April:\nF-fat!?Phoenix:\nWell, Miss May?Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk.Phoenix:\n?Edgeworth:\nQuite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)Edgeworth:\nI'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!Judge:\n! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.Edgeworth:\nAnd that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?Edgeworth:\nHo hoh! Impossible, of course...Phoenix:\nI have proof.Edgeworth:\nW-what!?Phoenix:\nWasn't it you who told me \"proof is everything\"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the \"proof\" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...Present Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Take a look at this!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you say to that?\nApril:\nW-what? I don't rightly understand what that's supposed to mean!\nJudge:\nI don't rightly understand either.\nEdgeworth:\nHo hoh!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... I think I blew it.)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future.\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor!\nLeads back to:\n\"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...\"Phoenix:\nTake a look at this!Judge:\nHmm. That's a very cute cell phone.April:\nOoh hoo! You have a girlie phone!Phoenix:\nW-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!Judge:\nOrder! Order!Edgeworth:\nThe defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!Phoenix:\nPerhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?Edgeworth:\n*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)Phoenix:\n(I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.) (Changed from [My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.] in the original release) Let's hear the conversation.Cellular:*beep*...Maya:\n[So you just want me to hold on to \"The Thinker\" for you, then?]Mia:\n[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]Maya:\n[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]Mia:\n[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]...[September 5, 9:27 AM]Cellular:*beep*Phoenix:\nYour Honor, I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded, (Changed from [I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone...] in the original release) which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel! (Changed from [and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!] in the original release)April:\nMuh... muh... muh!?Phoenix:\nWell, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?April:\n... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*Judge:\nSo the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?Yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\"No\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!)\nJudge:\nThen, the court would like--\nPhoenix:\nHold on! P-please wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nY-yes...? So you do have an objection?\nPhoenix:\nUm, yes, well...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Your Honor, it's just...\nLeads to:\n\"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\"Phoenix:\nThe witness claims she had \"seen it before.\" But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!Judge:\nWell then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.Present The Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's simple.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere is undeniable proof!\nEdgeworth:\nHah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece!\nJudge:\nHmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind?\nLeads back to:\n\"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.\"Phoenix:\nIt's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!April:\nW-whaaat!?Phoenix:\nA friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!April:\nI-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!Phoenix:\nMiss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?April:\nMmpf...Phoenix:\nOh? Excuses not on sale today?April:\nOooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!Judge:\nW-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!April:\nHrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*Phoenix:\n(S-scary...)Judge:\nMiss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?April:\n...Judge:\nHmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?Phoenix:\n(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...You held it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! When was this!?\nPhoenix:\nWhen she used it to strike the victim! When else?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nApril May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made \"The Thinker\" ring! That's when you heard it!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\nW-what's that supposed to mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt was you who just proved that \"The Thinker\" was empty!\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(S-she can't prove it! She did it!)\nApril:\nIt would be MY pleasure!\nPhoenix:\nN-no way!\nApril:\nYes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!\nEdgeworth:\nIncidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know \"The Thinker\" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!\nJudge:\nWell... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that already.\nPhoenix:\nTake another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]\nMia:\n[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]\nMaya:\n[Again? What's it this time?]\nMia:\n[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!]\n\n...\n\nJudge:\nThey do mention \"The Thinker.\" But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\n\n\n\nPresent Wiretap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Have a look at this.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Your evidence, please!\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave a look at this.\nApril:\nAh! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...\nPhoenix:\nI found this in Miss May's room.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!\nPhoenix:\nMiss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!?\nApril:\nI... I...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is ridiculous!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.\nApril:\nLa... laaa... lrrrrgf!\nJudge:\nWitness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?\nApril:\n...\nJudge:\nMiss May!\nApril:\nShut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!\n......\nApril:\nI-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\n(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)\n\n\n\nYou did it, didn't you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMiss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?\nApril:\nAre you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\"\n\n\n\n\nWhy the wiretap?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMiss May... Why did you tap her phone?\nApril:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nApril:\nDo I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?\nPhoenix:\n(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"!\nJudge:\nWhile this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?\nApril:\nAt the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her?

Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...\nPhoenix:\nI found this in Miss May's room.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!\nPhoenix:\nMiss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?\nApril:\nOooh. Oooooh!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, This is irrelevant!\nJudge:\nI'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.\nEdgeworth:\nThis is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?\nPhoenix:\nAbsolutely!\nEdgeworth:\nEven if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWHAAAAT!?\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I present the defendant's cell phone.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis! I think...\nJudge:\nThat's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! That was just a warm up!\nJudge:\nHmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI present the defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that.\nPhoenix:\nListen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia!

Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?\nPhoenix:\nAbsolutely!\nEdgeworth:\nEven if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWHAAAAT!?\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof.

No way!\nApril:\nWay, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night?

I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"!\nJudge:\nWhile this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?\nPhoenix:\n(Hah! I'd like to see her pull THAT off!)\nApril:\nMr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin!

What's your reason?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness.\nPhoenix:\nCondition...?\nEdgeworth:\nIf Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of \"guilty\" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition.\nPhoenix:\n(What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared \"guilty\" on the spot! What should I do...?)\n\n\n\nAccept the condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph.

I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness.\nJudge:\nI see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nRight. On with the cross-examination.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)\nJudge:\nThen I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?\nEdgeworth:\nNone, Your Honor. She's the last.\nPhoenix:\n(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense would like to call the bellboy after all!\nEdgeworth:\n... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\nMay I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced \"guilty\"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!\nLeads to:\n\"Very well!

You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...Bellboy:\nI believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was Miss May on the phone?\nBellboy:\nAbsolutely, sir.\nPhoenix:\nH-how can you be so certain!?\nBellboy:\nI checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir.\nJudge:\nYes, what then?Bellboy:\nShe asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n9:00 \"on the dot,\" you say?\nBellboy:\nYes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(9:00... the time of the murder!)Bellboy:\nI brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Precisely\" 9:00, then?\nBellboy:\nPrecisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM.\nPhoenix:\nHow can you be so sure!?\nBellboy:\nMiss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. \"Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!\" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Why would she be so particular about the time?)Bellboy:\nAnd I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou are sure it was Miss April May herself?\nBellboy:\nAb-SO-lutely, sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Ab-SO-lutely\"...?\nBellboy:\nYes, sir. As in, \"so very absolutely,\" sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.\nPhoenix:\nHow come you're so very certain!?\nBellboy:\nWell, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an \"embrasser,\" sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Embrasser\"!? Is that French for \"embrace\"?\nBellboy:\nIt's French for \"kiss,\" sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.\nPhoenix:\nWh-why would she have done that...?\nBellboy:\nI believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)Phoenix:\n(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)After pressing fourth and fifth statements:Phoenix:\n... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now...

This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)Check-in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nT-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May.\nBellboy:\nOh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really.\nPhoenix:\nI see...¬†? Excuse me... what exactly was a \"disappointment\"?\nBellboy:\nWell, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there.\nPhoenix:\n(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?\nBellboy:\nAh! Oh... er... rather, quite!\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Room service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nT-tell me again about er... room service!\nBellboy:\nA-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall.\nPhoenix:\nI see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?\nBellboy:\nY-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?\nBellboy:\nAh! Oh... er... rather, quite!\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object!

A new low!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question.\nBellboy:\nYes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see.\nPhoenix:\nI see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say?\nBellboy:\nEh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir?\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now...

That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!Bellboy:\nAh, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...Phoenix:\n!Bellboy:\nHe asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.Edgeworth:\nOof! Y-you fool!Phoenix:\nI've done it... I've won!Phoenix:\nMiss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?Bellboy:\nYes, sir.Phoenix:\nThen, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?Bellboy:\nThat's right, sir.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nYour Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nAnd who, Mr. Wright! Who is this \"other person\"!

Spiky-head!Phoenix:\n(Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard.April:\n... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then?

So criminal!\nPhoenix:\nUm... tapping people's phones is a crime, Miss May.\nApril:\nOh, and I suppose you learned that in Lawyer School, hmm? Creep!\nPhoenix:\n(This woman is impossible to talk to...)\n\n\n\n\nYour attitude\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSay... Why are you so... angry?

This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder!\nApril:\nNo! No, that's not right.\nPhoenix:\n(Nice try, Miss Cooperative.)\nApril:\nD-do you have proof that was him? Hmm? Y-yeah! Proof! Show me proof!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm so close!)September 7Gatewater HotelRoom 303Bellboy:\nAh, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself.Phoenix:\nOh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.Bellboy:\nNo, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's \"rep,\" as they say.Phoenix:\nHuh? \"Rep\"?Bellboy:\nYes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir!Phoenix:\nWhoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder.Bellboy:\nI, too, will become famous! \"The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee\"...!Phoenix:\n(Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...)Bellboy:\nSo!

There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer!\nBellboy:\nAh, please leave that as it is, sir. That's the \"Drawer of Terror, Hiding Place of the Murderer's Wiretap.\" It's set to become one of the most popular attractions here.\nPhoenix:\n(This guy's serious! I don't believe it...)\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA bottle and two glasses rest on the table. Why hasn't he cleaned these up by now?\nBellboy:\nAh, I beg your pardon, sir, but if you could please refrain from touching those... It's part of the decor. I call it: \"The last drink... before murder!\" We'll be famous! The talk of the hotel industry!\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNice weather again today. I can see the Fey & Co. Law Offices, of course.\nBellboy:\nAh, yes. We plan to install a telescope in that window, of course. Just $5.00 will earn you three minutes of a \"view to a kill\"!\nPhoenix:\n...\nBellboy:\nJ-just kidding, sir.

Sir, not to boast but I knew the moment I saw her... \"She'd do it!\" I said!\nPhoenix:\n(Do WHAT!? I'm starting to think the most suspicious person here is this guy!)\n\n\n\n\nThe man with May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...?\nBellboy:\nAh, yes... He struck me as a real \"Lady Killer,\" if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger.\nPhoenix:\n(There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.)\nBellboy:\nIf you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him.\nPhoenix:\n(A photo. Hmm...)\n\n\n\n\nThe hotel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about this hotel?\nBellboy:\nAbsolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir!

Right.)\n\n\n\n\nPhotograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this photo.\nBellboy:\n... That's him, Detective.\nPhoenix:\nUm... I'm the lawyer.\nBellboy:\nOh, I know that! I just wanted to say \"Detective\" once. You know how it is.\nPhoenix:\n(No. No I don't.)\nBellboy:\nWithout a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him!\nPhoenix:\nAn affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...)\n\n\n\nHave him write it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, sure. Why not?\nBellboy:\nYes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as \"The Bellboy who swore the affidavit\"!

His tea set is rattling!)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBellboy:\nI'm sorry... All I could think about during the trial was the hotel...

Perhaps I have intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary...?Phoenix:\n(What is this guy's problem!)White:\nI'm Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You know, Corporate Expansion Official? My business dealings bring me into contact with the elite of the elite. So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged.Phoenix:\n(What a fruitcake!)White:\nHmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this!Phoenix:\n(What does he mean by that?)White:\nNo matter.

What a shock it was to hear what she has done!\nPhoenix:\n\"What she has done\"... You mean the wiretap?\nWhite:\nIndeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods!

The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly.\nWhite:\n... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have \"seen\" the same thing as April May!)\nWhite:\nOh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement!\n\n\n\n\nBluecorp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway?\nWhite:\nAh, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future!\nPhoenix:\n(Sell... information?)\nWhite:\nIn just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color \"blue\"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not?\n\n\n\n\nThat painting (appears after \"Miss May\" and \"Night of the murder\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUh... there's something that's been bothering me.\nWhite:\nYes?

On closer inspection, he does look a lot like me, but I'm afraid this is someone else. Nope. That's definitely not me.

Is that kind of control really possible?)White:\nI don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?Phoenix:\nMr. Grossberg's... yes.White:\nThen you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you?

White would have destroyed me if I did.Phoenix:\n(So that's the connection!)Grossberg:\nIt is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.Phoenix:\nImpossible? Why!?Grossberg:\nHe has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Grossberg:\nThey are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that.

It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium.\nPhoenix:\n(A medium...?)\nGrossberg:\nHer name was Misty Fey.\nPhoenix:\n(Fey!)\nGrossberg:\nIndeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud.\nPhoenix:\n(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)\nGrossberg:\nI did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident.\n\n\n\n\nReason for blackmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBut why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?\nGrossberg:\nThe DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.\nPhoenix:\nYou told White?\nGrossberg:\nHe offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail.\nPhoenix:\n... I see.\nGrossberg:\n... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office.\nPhoenix:\nMia's office...?\nGrossberg:\nShe followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found.Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Reason for blackmail\" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices)Phoenix:\nIt's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAll the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here.

Hmmm... Should I take a look?\n\n\n\nRead it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press.

You are a mere lawyer! As was Miss Mia.Phoenix:\nHow dare you!White:\nI'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled. No lawyer of any worth will defend you. I have friends in the local lawyer's association, you see.

Edgeworth.)Edgeworth:\nI received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.Phoenix:\n?Edgeworth:\nHe told me that whatever Mr. White says today, it will be the \"absolute truth.\" No matter how you try to attack his testimony... If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.Phoenix:\n(What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?) So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?Edgeworth:\n... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.Maya:\nWhy... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?Edgeworth:\n\"Innocent\"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared \"guilty\"! So I make that my policy.Phoenix:\nEdgeworth... You've changed.Maya:\nHmm? Phoenix!

Are you sure you're up to doing this?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.Judge:\nUnderstood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nAs the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of a witness to the defendant's crime. (Changed from [today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.] in the original release)Judge:\nI see. The prosecution may call its witness.Phoenix:\n(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)Objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court.\nJudge:\nExcellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Great. He gets to show off and I get nowhere.)\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!\"Let it go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Forget it.

That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?Edgeworth:\nName!Phoenix:\n(These two are great together...)White:\nMy name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp.Edgeworth:\nDid you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?White:\nThat would be a negatory! No, I did not.Edgeworth:\n... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?White:\nCorrect.Edgeworth:\nAnd you witnessed the murder from there?White:\nAhem. Why tell you what you already know?Judge:\nVery well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for.

She, too, was flabbergasted of course.\nThe victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!\nFinally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Judge:\nHmm... If things occurred as you testify, then I'm afraid the defendant is guilty. Very well, defendant... er, I mean, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination...Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --White:\nLet's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow do you know what time it was?\nWhite:\nBecause I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect, you know?\nPhoenix:\nNo no no, you're not getting away with that!\nWhite:\nYou are so mistrusting, Mr. Lawyer! So... what was the proper term for \"secretary\" again...? Anyway, Miss May ordered room service for 9:00. It happened soon after the room service arrived.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. That's what Miss May said, too.)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nTrue, the bellboy who brought the coffee saw Miss May.

Don't add them together!\nJudge:\nI think the witness is trying to say his eyesight is good.\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what did you do then?White:\nI called Miss May over at once. She, too, was surprised of course.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Miss May doing at that time?\nWhite:\nShe had just finished watching a soap opera on the TV, and was weeping openly.\nPhoenix:\nDid you know she had been tapping the Fey office phone?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIrrelevant! That has nothing to do with the case at hand.\nWhite:\nI care not. I will answer the lawyer's bold inquiry. Miss May was acting alone when she tapped the phone of this Fey woman.\nPhoenix:\nYou'd make a good politician, Mr. White.\nWhite:\nHo hoh! After all, I am \"El Presidente.\"\nJudge:\nPlease continue.White:\nThe victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan you be a little more detailed about that? I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened.\nWhite:\nOf course! Comprende! I understand! The victim was attacked, by you, and ran to the left. You gave chase, and struck her down!\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure?\nWhite:\nAs you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect!\nJudge:\nPerhaps you could change your testimony to reflect this new detail.\nChanges statement from \"The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!\" to \"The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!\"White:\nThe victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nWhite:\nHow many times must I say it?

She clearly stated that the victim ran \"right\"!White:\n...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.Phoenix:\nI think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?White:\n! Very strange... I did see her run to the left... I did.Maya:\nPhoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.Phoenix:\nTrue. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)Judge:\nMr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nMiss May says \"right,\" and Mr. White says \"left.\" Can you explain this contradiction to the court?Mr. White is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs Mr. White testified, Mia ran to the left.\nJudge:\nBut... But if that's the case... Why would she run in the opposite direction from the door?\nPhoenix:\nShe did not. She was running towards the door, Your Honor.\nEdgeworth:\nBwah! Now you're the one making a contradiction, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nNot at all.\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Miss May is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs Miss May has stated, Mia ran to the right after she was attacked.\nWhite:\nWhat is this?

Er, rather, that does not clear up the contradiction!\nPhoenix:\nThere is one scenario that would explain their conflicting accounts.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Phoenix:\nObviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!Judge:\nMr. Wright! What do you mean?Edgeworth:\nYes, what do you mean, he was not \"viewing the crime from the hotel\"!? If he was not in the hotel, where could he have been!?Phoenix:\nIn the law offices of Fey & Co., of course! More specifically, he was standing here! (Time to show the court where Mr. White was standing!) (Changed from [Show the court where Mr. White was standing!] in the original release)Present killer's location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is where he was!\"Present victim's location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's where he was!\nEdgeworth:\nM-Mr. Wright! We are not fools! How could he have been exactly where the victim was standing!?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh... oh, right!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Your Honor! Sorry! Let me try that again...\nLeads back to:\n\"Time to the court where Mr. White was standing!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's where he was!\nJudge:\nHold it right there, Mr. Wright! If he was there during the very act of murder... That would make him an accomplice!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nImpossible! There was no one other than the criminal and victim in the room! There is no evidence, no proof to the contrary! None!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry! Er... let me try that again!\nLeads back to:\n\"Time to show the court where Mr. White was standing!\"Phoenix:\nThis is where he was! Look! When the victim ran for the door... If he was watching from this point, to him it would appear that she ran to the \"left.\"Edgeworth:\nPlease! This is no time for jokes in ill taste! That is where the killer was standing!Judge:\nOrder! I will have order! Anyone disturbing the order of this courtroom will be held in contempt! Mr. Wright! What are you suggesting!?White:\nR-r-rapscallion!!!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThe postulations of the defense are a distortion of the truth, Your Honor!Judge:\nIndeed. They do seem a bit far-fetched...White:\n... Ho hoh hoh! You provide us with so much entertainment, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:\n(What now!? He's... laughing!?)White:\nThe hilarity of the moment made me remember something... It appears I have been unclear, and for this, I apologize. Mr. Your Honor... Might I be allowed to testify once more?Judge:\nVery well, let's hear your revised testimony.Phoenix:\n(Good luck. You can't fix a broken testimony, buddy!)Witness Testimony-- She Ran to the \"Left\" --White:\nMiss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!\nWhen you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left.\nAnd then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw.\nNext, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.\nYou chased her, and delivered the final blow.\nThat is what Miss May saw.\nYou see? You hit her twice!\nDon't you remember, Mr. Lawyer?Judge:\nHmm... That does seem to make sense. Will you be cross-examining the witness's testimony?Phoenix:\nYou bet I will! I mean, yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination",

Chief...?Chief!!!Phoenix:\nWho are you????:\n...Phoenix:\n(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:\nChief...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroken glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSome shards of glass are scattered on the floor.

She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. \"The Thinker\" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.\nThe Thinker added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.\nGlass Shards added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nNothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?\n\n\n\n\nMia Fey's body (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake.

I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:\n(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)Maya:\nOh! It's you! The lawyer...

It's up to you.\nMaya:\nUp... to me?\nPhoenix:\nYes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.\nMaya:\n...

This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.\nPhoenix:\nA-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?\nMaya:\nOh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.\nPhoenix:\nA s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)\n\n\n\n\nThe day of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about the day of the murder?\nMaya:\nYes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.\nPhoenix:\nEvidence?\nMaya:\nYes. That clock shaped like \"The Thinker.\"\nPhoenix:\n(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?\nMaya:\nUm, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?\nPhoenix:\nH-her own voice!?\nMaya:\nYes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.\nPhoenix:\nYou recorded it!\nMaya:\nYeah! I forgot how to delete those things.\n\n\n\n\nThe day of the crime (after clearing \"Your cell phone\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.\nMaya:\nNo, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.\nPhoenix:\n(That's \"The Thinker\" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?\nMaya:\nIt was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.\n\n\n\n\nYour cell phone (appears after \"The day of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!\nMaya:\nRight! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.\nMaya:\nI'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?\nPhoenix:\nSure, thanks.\nMaya's Memo added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nYour cell phone (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone?

So, Mia was into this stuff too?\nMaya:\nOf course! She left the mountain to \"follow her career,\" she said. Her powers were first-class, too!\nPhoenix:\n(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!\nMaya:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?\nMaya:\nYes. ...In training.\nPhoenix:\nWell, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!\nMaya:\n...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...

You're just like the detective.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it!

Nobody could get a hold of him!\nPhoenix:\nThey couldn't find him?\nMaya:\nI have no one left to ask!\nPhoenix:\n...? Say, what about your parents...?\nMaya:\n... ... ...\nPhoenix:\nO-okay!

Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all!\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nMia (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, Mia's death was instantaneous.\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.\nPhoenix:\nYou knew her, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nSure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.\n\n\n\n\nMaya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, about Maya...\nGumshoe:\nYeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!\nPhoenix:\nW-why do you say that?\nGumshoe:\nThe city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nI'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth (appears after \"Maya\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nProsecutor Edgeworth...\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?\n\n\n\nOf course I do!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his \"guilty\" verdict.\nGumshoe:\nAww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.\nPhoenix:\n(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)\nLeads to:\n\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"\n\n\n\n\nOf course not!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNever heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nWhoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!\nPhoenix:\n(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a \"guilty\" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)\nLeads to:\n\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering, do you know anything about this?\nGumshoe:\nThat statue? That's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)\n\n\n\n\nGlass Shards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere was broken glass at the crime scene, right?\nGumshoe:\nHmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.\n\n\n\n\nReceipt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure that Mia wrote it herself?\nGumshoe:\nGiven the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.\nPhoenix:\n(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)\n\n\n\n\nMaya's Memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?\nGumshoe:\nOh that? I have that.\nPhoenix:\nDo you think you could give it back?\nGumshoe:\nSure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)\n\n\n\nTell him straight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)\nGumshoe:\nSomething the matter?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!\nGumshoe:\nNope. I know nothing, pal!\nPhoenix:\nThat cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!\nGumshoe:\nUrk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!\nPhoenix:\nImpressive! You're quite the detective.\nGumshoe:\nUh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.\nLeads to:\n\"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\"\n\n\n\n\nTell him not-so-straight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?)\nGumshoe:\nSomething the matter?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, um...

Hmm... it says \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo\"... \"The Steel Samurai\"... that action hero on TV?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you see that strap is a collector's item...

Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you!After clearing \"Mia\" and \"Maya\" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo:Phoenix:\n(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)Gumshoe:\nYou all done, pal?Phoenix:\nUm, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.Gumshoe:\nOh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!Phoenix:\n... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?Gumshoe:\nYeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:\n(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:\nAhah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:\n(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.Gumshoe:\nYou got that right, pal!Phoenix:\n(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)September 6Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:\n(According to the receptionist, the big boss is \"out\". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nExpensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.\n\n\n\n\nPainting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.\n\n\n\n\nPotted plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Maya:\nHey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?Phoenix:\nSorry. I haven't seen him yet.Maya:\nI see...Phoenix:\n(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour family\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about your family?\nMaya:\nI only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.\nPhoenix:\n(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)\n\n\n\n\nYour mother (appears after \"Your family\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Ruined\"...?)\nMaya:\nAfter that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would \"become a lawyer\" and she left the mountain.\nPhoenix:\n... So, you live by yourself?\nMaya:\nYes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)\n\n\n\n\nYour mother's enemy (appears after \"Your mother\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, who was this man who, um, \"ruined\" your mother?\nMaya:\nAbout 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...\nPhoenix:\nWait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?\nMaya:\nThe police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.\nPhoenix:\nWow... So, what happened?\nMaya:\nThe case was solved... we thought.\nPhoenix:\nYou \"thought\"...?\nMaya:\nThe man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nMaya:\nThe police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.\nPhoenix:\nI see.\nMaya:\n... White...\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me? White?\nMaya:\nThat was his name. My sister told me.\nPhoenix:\nWhite? Hmm...Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHey, I got your cell phone back.\nMaya:\nOh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice?\n\n\nPhoenix:\n... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ...\n\n\nMaya:\nThank you.September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303April:\nWell! Hello there, handsome.Phoenix:\nUmm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)April:\nYou're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, \"Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!\" Tee hee!Phoenix:\n(Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.)April:\nGee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness!Phoenix:\n(I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here.\n\n\n\n\nFlowers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nOpen drawer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.)\"\n\n\n\n\nPainting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAh. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be \"still life\"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall.\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though.Phoenix:\n(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)April:\nHey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?Phoenix:\n(Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen drawer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... what's inside I wonder?)\nApril:\n*cough* *cough*\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe later...)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you witnessed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident.\nApril:\nOoh. \"Observe,\" \"incident\"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please?\nApril:\nLet me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy.)\n\n\n\n\nMiss May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, could you... just who exactly are you?\nApril:\nOooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me?\nPhoenix:\nN-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here!\nApril:\nTee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush.\nPhoenix:\n(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do?\nApril:\nWell... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy.)\n\n\n\n\nThis room\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you?\nApril:\nOooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television!\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer!\nApril:\nSay, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy.)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril:\nExcuse me, but I'm a witness? Police witness? You understand? How could I possibly give you any information in good conscience, hmm? Me... \"the witness\"! It's just like the movie!Grossberg Law Offices (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Phoenix:\n(Hmm... seems like Mr. Grossberg is out. Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.)???:\n*Ah-HHHHEM!*Phoenix:\n(If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!)Grossberg:\nAh hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me?Phoenix:\nUh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!)Grossberg:\nHmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now?Phoenix:\nY-yes, well... yes.Grossberg:\nAnd what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed!Phoenix:\n(Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?)Grossberg:\nHmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it!Phoenix:\nUm... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey.Grossberg:\n...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on.Phoenix:\n(Hmm? Why the strange reaction?)Grossberg:\nA-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible.Phoenix:\nW-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!?Grossberg:\nUrk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion.Phoenix:\n(What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour refusal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHow can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case!\nGrossberg:\nHmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see!\nPhoenix:\nBut the client is Mia Fey's sister!\nGrossberg:\nHmm... ahem.\nPhoenix:\nMia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands.\nGrossberg:\nYes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye.\nPhoenix:\nCreep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.\nGrossberg:\n*grumble*... Think not.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Did you say something?\nGrossberg:\nI think not, I said.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what do you mean?\nGrossberg:\nI'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy.\nPhoenix:\nWhy!?\nGrossberg:\nI... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you.\nPhoenix:\n(What's going on here!?)\n\n\n\n\nMia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know Mia Fey...?\nGrossberg:\n... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see.\nPhoenix:\nA \"mission\"?\nGrossberg:\nYou could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one.\n\n\n\n\nThat painting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's... quite a painting.\nGrossberg:\nAhah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!\nPhoenix:\n(I wasn't interested...)\nGrossberg:\nIt's not for sale!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not buying! (Geez!)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrossberg:\nVery sorry, but I've got nothing to say regarding this matter.Fey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:\n...

(Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:\nThank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:\nIf we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:\nWitness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:\nSir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nVery well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:\nAnd the cause of death?Gumshoe:\nLoss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of \"The Thinker\" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:\nThe court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:\n(They're still calling it a \"statue\"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nNow, Detective...Gumshoe:\nY-yes sir!Edgeworth:\nYou immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:\nHmm. Detective Gumshoe.

Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:\n(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:\nSomething the matter?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho did you say you got a call from?\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:\nThere were two people there already:Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?\nGumshoe:\nHmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!\nPhoenix:\nTh-that's pretty fast!\nGumshoe:\nOur motto this month is \"quick response\"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.\nGumshoe:\nYes sir!Gumshoe:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure it was us?\nGumshoe:\nListen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy's that? What's your reason?Gumshoe:\nWhy? We had a witness account describing her!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on just one second!\"Gumshoe:\nThe witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on just one second!\"Phoenix:\n(I can't see a single contradiction in there!

You said you arrested her because you had \"hard evidence\" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:\nHuh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:\nI heard you say it!Judge:\nYou did say it.Edgeworth:\nYou said it.Phoenix:\nExactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was \"hard evidence\"!?Gumshoe:\nWh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:\nThat's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:\nUmm...Phoenix:\n(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:\n... Yes.Phoenix:\n(Gah!)Gumshoe:\nSorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:\nVery well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!\nOn it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!\nLab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!\nAlso, there was blood found on the victim's finger!\nBefore she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\nHow you like that? That's my \"hard evidence\"!Judge:\nHmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nY-Your Honor?Judge:\nWhy didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:\nAh... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:\nTry to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd did you find any evidence?\nGumshoe:\nNow, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)Gumshoe:\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nJust because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!\nGumshoe:\nHo hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?\nPhoenix:\nWh-who? Um...\n\n\n\nThe killer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nTh-the killer! Anyone can see that!\nGumshoe:\nHoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!\nPhoenix:\nShe was framed!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?\nPhoenix:\nAh... (Urk!)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...!)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\"\n\n\n\n\nMiss May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell... it could have been the witness, Miss May!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!\nGumshoe:\nYeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...!)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\"\n\n\n\n\nI did\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt... it could have been me!\nGumshoe:\nWhat! S-so it was you!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nEdgeworth:\nListen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!\nPhoenix:\n(...!)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Gumshoe:\nOn it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I do, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...)Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Gumshoe:\nLab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of \"tests\" were these again?\nGumshoe:\nHuh?

I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!\nJudge:\nYes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nTh-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe.\nGumshoe:\nY-yeah?\nEdgeworth:\nI think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.\nGumshoe:\nOh? Oh hoh hoh.\nPhoenix:\n(That was a mess...)\nGumshoe:\nRight! Where was I?Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Gumshoe:\nAlso, there was blood found on the victim's finger!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nOn which hand was the bloody finger, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThe right hand!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... she WAS right handed...)\nGumshoe:\nHah hah hah! Nice try!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... I guess it wasn't too hard to see what I was getting at there.)Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Gumshoe:\nBefore she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?\nGumshoe:\nSure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!\nPhoenix:\nThis isn't a movie, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nOof!\nPhoenix:\nLet's talk about reality, shall we?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.\nPhoenix:\nDon't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?\nGumshoe:\nAh, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nStop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!\nJudge:\nOrder!

What he said!Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Phoenix:\n(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?Gumshoe:\nWh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?Phoenix:\nYou have it backwards, Detective.Gumshoe:\nB-backwards?Phoenix:\nThe victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. \"Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object.\" She died immediately!Gumshoe:\nBut...!Phoenix:\nNo \"but\"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!Judge:\nOrder! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?Phoenix:\nWh-when...!?The day of the murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.\nGumshoe:\nYou're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!\nPhoenix:\nOh. Right.\nLeads to:\n\"The prosecution's point being...?\"The day after the murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was the day after the murder...\nLeads to:\n\"The prosecution's point being...?\"I forget\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm... sorry, I forgot.\nEdgeworth:\nHah!

R-right.\nLeads to:\n\"The prosecution's point being...?\"Judge:\nThe prosecution's point being...?Edgeworth:\nThat autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nWh-what!?Edgeworth:\nA second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! \"Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow.\" I received these results this morning.Phoenix:\nN-no way!Edgeworth:\nYour Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write \"Maya\"! That is all.Judge:\nI see!Phoenix:\n(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)Edgeworth:\nWhy, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?You're a sham, Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution!\nEdgeworth:\nNo matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable.\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.\"The detective's a sham!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe!

The court accepts the evidence.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nWell, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.Judge:\nI suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.Phoenix:\n(Darn! This isn't good!)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!Judge:\nLet the witness Miss April May take the stand.Phoenix:\n(Exactly what part of her is \"innocent\"...?)Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name, please.April:\nApril May! At your service! *wink*Judge:\nOrder! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking! ([wanton] misspelled as [wonton] in the original release)April:\nAww... Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)Edgeworth:\nTell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?April:\nUm... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.Edgeworth:\nAnd this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?April:\nMmm... that's right, big boy.Judge:\nPlease testify to the court about what you saw.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:\nIt was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!\nAnd then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!\nThe one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!\nThen the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!\nBut that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!\nThen the woman with long hair...\nShe kinda... slumped.\nThe end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWell, Your Honor?Judge:\nI see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...Phoenix:\nW-wait, Your Honor!Judge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nWhat about my cross-examination!?Judge:\nI thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...Phoenix:\nH-hey! How dare you!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?Yes, I'm doing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!)\nLeads to:\n\"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!\"No thanks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point.\nEdgeworth:\nHeh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-what? That's it!?)\nJudge:\nVery well.\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! Hold on!\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?\nPhoenix:\nYes yes yes!

I looked out the window, y'know!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you do that?\nApril:\nHuh? \"Why\"? Like, why what?\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something?\nApril:\nOh, well, um... gee!\nPhoenix:\n(What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)\nApril:\nI sort of, y'know. I had a feeling!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question!

I will not have you badgering my witness!\nPhoenix:\nB-badgering?\nEdgeworth:\nYou insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed.\n(Yeah! Yeah!

Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?\nEdgeworth:\nThere was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(He's right...)\n\n\n\nYep, he's right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her.

You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!April:\n...!Phoenix:\nNo one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!April:\nBut... but!Judge:\nStill, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...Phoenix:\nShe was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?April:\nRowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.Judge:\nMiss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.April:\nI'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*Judge:\nYour testimony again, if you would.Phoenix:\n(Damn, I almost had her!)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:\nI did see everything! I did!\nThe victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.\nThen the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...\nAnd she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!\nThat... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think?\nWell? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee!Judge:\nI... see.

I'm sowwy.\nJudge:\nVery well... continue.April:\nThe victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs that \"right\" as in your right, as you looked from the hotel?\nApril:\nUm... which hand do I hold my knife in again...? Right! It was my right hand! Right?\nEdgeworth:\nSatisfied, Mr. Wright? Please continue.April:\nThen the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow convenient for you to remember her \"hippie\" clothes!\nApril:\nThat's what you--I mean, that's what she was wearing! Oh, and her hair was all done up like a bun!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh*...)\nJudge:\nWhat happened then?April:\nAnd she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhere did this weapon come from?\nApril:\nShe picked it up from the desk!\nJudge:\nI see. What sort of weapon was it?April:\nThat... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA... clock? (Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?)\nApril:\nW-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all.\nPhoenix:\n(No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!)Present The Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Miss May.\"Phoenix:\n(Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.)Phoenix:\nMiss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.April:\nRevealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...Phoenix:\nYou just said that this statue of \"The Thinker\" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!April:\nUrp!Phoenix:\nAnother person in much the same position as you recently called this a \"clock,\" too... And he was found guilty... of murder!Judge:\nOrder! Order!Phoenix:\nMiss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?April:\nOooh... urp!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThe witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!Judge:\nYes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)Judge:\n... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.Phoenix:\n(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)April:\nHuh? What? So... what happens now?Phoenix:\nWhat happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?April:\nWhat...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!Phoenix:\nSo, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!April:\nN-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!Edgeworth:\nThe law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!Judge:\nHmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...She couldn't have heard it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou have proof that she could not?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nEdgeworth:\nAmateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing.\nPhoenix:\nThen I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard...\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution denies your request!\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!? On what grounds?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Objection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!)\nJudge:\nReady to proceed, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"No, Your Honor!\"It couldn't have rung\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, members of the court...\"Phoenix:\nYour Honor, members of the court...

Somehow... he knew!)Edgeworth:\nI'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!Judge:\n! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.Edgeworth:\nAnd that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?Edgeworth:\nHo hoh! Impossible, of course...Phoenix:\nI have proof.Edgeworth:\nW-what!?Phoenix:\nWasn't it you who told me \"proof is everything\"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the \"proof\" you like so much!

I think I blew it.)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future.\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor!\nLeads back to:\n\"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...\"Phoenix:\nTake a look at this!Judge:\nHmm. That's a very cute cell phone.April:\nOoh hoo! You have a girlie phone!Phoenix:\nW-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!Judge:\nOrder! Order!Edgeworth:\nThe defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!Phoenix:\nPerhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?Edgeworth:\n*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)Phoenix:\n(I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.) (Changed from [My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.] in the original release) Let's hear the conversation.Cellular:*beep*...Maya:\n[So you just want me to hold on to \"The Thinker\" for you, then?]Mia:\n[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]Maya:\n[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]Mia:\n[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]...[September 5, 9:27 AM]Cellular:*beep*Phoenix:\nYour Honor, I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded, (Changed from [I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone...] in the original release) which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel! (Changed from [and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!] in the original release)April:\nMuh... muh... muh!?Phoenix:\nWell, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?April:\n... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*Judge:\nSo the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?Yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\"No\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!)\nJudge:\nThen, the court would like--\nPhoenix:\nHold on! P-please wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nY-yes...? So you do have an objection?\nPhoenix:\nUm, yes, well...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Your Honor, it's just...\nLeads to:\n\"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\"Phoenix:\nThe witness claims she had \"seen it before.\" But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!Judge:\nWell then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.Present The Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's simple.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere is undeniable proof!\nEdgeworth:\nHah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece!\nJudge:\nHmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind?\nLeads back to:\n\"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.\"Phoenix:\nIt's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!April:\nW-whaaat!?Phoenix:\nA friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!April:\nI-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!Phoenix:\nMiss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?April:\nMmpf...Phoenix:\nOh? Excuses not on sale today?April:\nOooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!Judge:\nW-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!April:\nHrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*Phoenix:\n(S-scary...)Judge:\nMiss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?April:\n...Judge:\nHmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?Phoenix:\n(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...You held it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! When was this!?\nPhoenix:\nWhen she used it to strike the victim! When else?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nApril May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made \"The Thinker\" ring! That's when you heard it!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\nW-what's that supposed to mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt was you who just proved that \"The Thinker\" was empty!\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(S-she can't prove it! She did it!)\nApril:\nIt would be MY pleasure!\nPhoenix:\nN-no way!\nApril:\nYes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!\nEdgeworth:\nIncidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know \"The Thinker\" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!\nJudge:\nWell... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that already.\nPhoenix:\nTake another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]\nMia:\n[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]\nMaya:\n[Again? What's it this time?]\nMia:\n[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!]\n\n...\n\nJudge:\nThey do mention \"The Thinker.\" But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\n\n\n\nPresent Wiretap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Have a look at this.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Your evidence, please!\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave a look at this.\nApril:\nAh! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...\nPhoenix:\nI found this in Miss May's room.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!\nPhoenix:\nMiss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!?\nApril:\nI... I...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is ridiculous!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.\nApril:\nLa... laaa... lrrrrgf!\nJudge:\nWitness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?\nApril:\n...\nJudge:\nMiss May!\nApril:\nShut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!\n......\nApril:\nI-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\n(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)\n\n\n\nYou did it, didn't you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMiss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?\nApril:\nAre you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\"\n\n\n\n\nWhy the wiretap?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMiss May... Why did you tap her phone?\nApril:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nApril:\nDo I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?\nPhoenix:\n(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"!\nJudge:\nWhile this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?\nApril:\nAt the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent Wiretap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHave a look at this.\nApril:\nAh!

You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?\nApril:\nOooh. Oooooh!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, This is irrelevant!\nJudge:\nI'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.\nEdgeworth:\nThis is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?\nPhoenix:\nAbsolutely!\nEdgeworth:\nEven if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWHAAAAT!?\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I present the defendant's cell phone.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis! I think...\nJudge:\nThat's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! That was just a warm up!\nJudge:\nHmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI present the defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that.\nPhoenix:\nListen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia!

Maybe that wasn't the thing...)\nJudge:\nI'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again:\nLeads back to:\n\"How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?\"You had heard about it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock!\nJudge:\nShe \"heard\"...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known \"The Thinker\" was a clock! And I can show you the proof!\nJudge:\nWell, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had \"heard\" the murder weapon was a clock.\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that already.\nPhoenix:\nTake another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia!

I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"!\nJudge:\nWhile this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?\nPhoenix:\n(Hah! I'd like to see her pull THAT off!)\nApril:\nMr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin! You were probably thinking \"I'd like to see her pull THAT off,\" weren't you!\nPhoenix:\n(Damn... she's good!)\nApril:\nWell you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will!\nPhoenix:\nYou can't be serious! No way!\nApril:\nWay, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...\nPhoenix:\nR-room service!?\nApril:\nIce coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.\nPhoenix:\nI-ice coffee...!?\nApril:\nThink I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*\nEdgeworth:\nErgo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!\nPhoenix:\n!\nJudge:\nSo, where does that leave us...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!\nPhoenix:\n(No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is my evidence!\nJudge:\nI'm afraid I'm not sure where you are going with all of this, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm... \"where\"?

There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it!\nApril:\nI think you've sunken quite low enough already.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI object to calling the bellboy!\nPhoenix:\nW-why? What's your reason?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness.\nPhoenix:\nCondition...?\nEdgeworth:\nIf Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of \"guilty\" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition.\nPhoenix:\n(What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared \"guilty\" on the spot! What should I do...?)\n\n\n\nAccept the condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph.

I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness.\nJudge:\nI see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nRight. On with the cross-examination.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)\nJudge:\nThen I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?\nEdgeworth:\nNone, Your Honor. She's the last.\nPhoenix:\n(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense would like to call the bellboy after all!\nEdgeworth:\n... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\nMay I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced \"guilty\"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!\nLeads to:\n\"Very well!

I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally.\nPhoenix:\nAre you always so... so prim?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...Bellboy:\nI believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was Miss May on the phone?\nBellboy:\nAbsolutely, sir.\nPhoenix:\nH-how can you be so certain!?\nBellboy:\nI checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir.\nJudge:\nYes, what then?Bellboy:\nShe asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n9:00 \"on the dot,\" you say?\nBellboy:\nYes. I confirmed that detail several times.

Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!\" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Why would she be so particular about the time?)Bellboy:\nAnd I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou are sure it was Miss April May herself?\nBellboy:\nAb-SO-lutely, sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Ab-SO-lutely\"...?\nBellboy:\nYes, sir. As in, \"so very absolutely,\" sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.\nPhoenix:\nHow come you're so very certain!?\nBellboy:\nWell, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an \"embrasser,\" sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Embrasser\"!? Is that French for \"embrace\"?\nBellboy:\nIt's French for \"kiss,\" sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.\nPhoenix:\nWh-why would she have done that...?\nBellboy:\nI believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)Phoenix:\n(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)After pressing fourth and fifth statements:Phoenix:\n... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now...

My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really.\nPhoenix:\nI see...¬†? Excuse me... what exactly was a \"disappointment\"?\nBellboy:\nWell, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there.\nPhoenix:\n(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?\nBellboy:\nAh! Oh... er... rather, quite!\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Room service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nT-tell me again about er... room service!\nBellboy:\nA-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall.\nPhoenix:\nI see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?\nBellboy:\nY-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?\nBellboy:\nAh! Oh... er... rather, quite!\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Bed making\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day.\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question.\nBellboy:\nYes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see.\nPhoenix:\nI see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say?\nBellboy:\nEh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir?\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now...

That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!Bellboy:\nAh, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...Phoenix:\n!Bellboy:\nHe asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.Edgeworth:\nOof! Y-you fool!Phoenix:\nI've done it... I've won!Phoenix:\nMiss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?Bellboy:\nYes, sir.Phoenix:\nThen, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?Bellboy:\nThat's right, sir.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nYour Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nAnd who, Mr. Wright! Who is this \"other person\"!

What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?Phoenix:\nI heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.Maya:\nYes sir!Phoenix:\nI'm going to find out more about this man.Maya:\nDo you think he was the one who...?Phoenix:\nMaybe so.Maya:\nSis...Phoenix:\nDon't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.Maya:\nI'm counting on you!Phoenix:\nI asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that hasn't been stricken from the record.

This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder!\nApril:\nNo! No, that's not right.\nPhoenix:\n(Nice try, Miss Cooperative.)\nApril:\nD-do you have proof that was him? Hmm?

Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.Bellboy:\nNo, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's \"rep,\" as they say.Phoenix:\nHuh? \"Rep\"?Bellboy:\nYes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir!Phoenix:\nWhoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder.Bellboy:\nI, too, will become famous! \"The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee\"...!Phoenix:\n(Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...)Bellboy:\nSo!

There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer!\nBellboy:\nAh, please leave that as it is, sir.

He struck me as a real \"Lady Killer,\" if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger.\nPhoenix:\n(There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.)\nBellboy:\nIf you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him.\nPhoenix:\n(A photo. Hmm...)\n\n\n\n\nThe hotel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about this hotel?\nBellboy:\nAbsolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir!

You know how it is.\nPhoenix:\n(No. No I don't.)\nBellboy:\nWithout a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him!\nPhoenix:\nAn affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...)\n\n\n\nHave him write it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, sure.

What a shock it was to hear what she has done!\nPhoenix:\n\"What she has done\"... You mean the wiretap?\nWhite:\nIndeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods!

The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly.\nWhite:\n... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have \"seen\" the same thing as April May!)\nWhite:\nOh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement!\n\n\n\n\nBluecorp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway?\nWhite:\nAh, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information.

Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color \"blue\"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course!

You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?Phoenix:\nMr. Grossberg's... yes.White:\nThen you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you?

My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl.\n\n\n\n\nYour refusal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense?

I don't think I can help you with that.Grossberg:\nRedd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now...Phoenix:\n(15 years...!)Grossberg:\nAll because of the \"DL-6 Incident,\" as you may have guessed.Phoenix:\n(The name on the back of those photographs!)Grossberg:\nAs you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did.Phoenix:\n(So that's the connection!)Grossberg:\nIt is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.Phoenix:\nImpossible? Why!?Grossberg:\nHe has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Grossberg:\nThey are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DL-6 Incident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat is the \"DL-6 Incident\"?\nGrossberg:\n\"DL-6\" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium.\nPhoenix:\n(A medium...?)\nGrossberg:\nHer name was Misty Fey.\nPhoenix:\n(Fey!)\nGrossberg:\nIndeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud.\nPhoenix:\n(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)\nGrossberg:\nI did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident.\n\n\n\n\nReason for blackmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBut why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?\nGrossberg:\nThe DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.\nPhoenix:\nYou told White?\nGrossberg:\nHe offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail.\nPhoenix:\n... I see.\nGrossberg:\n... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office.\nPhoenix:\nMia's office...?\nGrossberg:\nShe followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found.Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Reason for blackmail\" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices)Phoenix:\nIt's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here.

Hmmm... Should I take a look?\n\n\n\nRead it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press.

If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.Phoenix:\n(What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?) So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?Edgeworth:\n... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.Maya:\nWhy... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?Edgeworth:\n\"Innocent\"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared \"guilty\"! So I make that my policy.Phoenix:\nEdgeworth... You've changed.Maya:\nHmm? Phoenix! You know him!?Edgeworth:\nDon't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.Maya:\nPh-Phoenix...?Phoenix:\nWell... court will be starting soon. (Changed from [Well... court will be opening for session soon.] in the original release)Maya:\nWhat? But wait! Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! They're not... (Changed from [Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! He's not...] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI'll be defending myself.Maya:\nWhaaaat!?Phoenix:\nOkay, let's do this.September 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nMr. Wright... Are you sure you're up to doing this?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.Judge:\nUnderstood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nAs the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of a witness to the defendant's crime. (Changed from [today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.] in the original release)Judge:\nI see. The prosecution may call its witness.Phoenix:\n(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)Objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court.\nJudge:\nExcellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Great. He gets to show off and I get nowhere.)\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!\"Let it go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Forget it. I smell a trap.)\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!\"Edgeworth:\nI would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!Edgeworth:\nPlease state your full name.White:\nYou wish to know the title of my personage?Edgeworth:\nEr... your name?White:\nYes! That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?Edgeworth:\nName!Phoenix:\n(These two are great together...)White:\nMy name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp.Edgeworth:\nDid you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?White:\nThat would be a negatory! No, I did not.Edgeworth:\n... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?White:\nCorrect.Edgeworth:\nAnd you witnessed the murder from there?White:\nAhem. Why tell you what you already know?Judge:\nVery well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)White:\nHo hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:\n...!Maya:\nLet him have it, Phoenix!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --White:\nLet's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.\nI was quietly perusifying... er, that's \"reading\" to you, some papers by the window.\nThen I heard a bedlam coming from outside!\nSurprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.\nIt was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!\nNeedless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!\nI called Miss May over at once. She, too, was flabbergasted of course.\nThe victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!\nFinally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Judge:\nHmm... If things occurred as you testify, then I'm afraid the defendant is guilty. Very well, defendant... er, I mean, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination...Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --White:\nLet's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow do you know what time it was?\nWhite:\nBecause I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect, you know?\nPhoenix:\nNo no no, you're not getting away with that!\nWhite:\nYou are so mistrusting, Mr. Lawyer! So... what was the proper term for \"secretary\" again...? Anyway, Miss May ordered room service for 9:00. It happened soon after the room service arrived.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. That's what Miss May said, too.)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nTrue, the bellboy who brought the coffee saw Miss May. But he testified that he did not see you at the time!\nWhite:\nAhem. This is your concern? Silly Lawyer! Miss May received the coffee outside the room! Of course he could not see me. He would need X-ray vision to pull off something like that!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nEdgeworth:\nTell us, what were you doing at the time?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I don't see anything to gain by attacking him on this point any further.) Okay, what were you doing at the time?\nLeads back to cross-examinationWhite:\nI was quietly perusifying... er, that's \"reading\" to you, some papers by the window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy window, you mean the one directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Office?\nWhite:\nCorrect! That is the only window, you see.\nPhoenix:\nAnd there you were reading... papers?\nWhite:\nCorrect! The Gatewater is a businessman's hotel, and I am a busy man who had business to do!White:\nThen I heard a bedlam coming from outside!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA \"bedlam\"?\nWhite:\nIt must have been when you attacked, I assume.\nEdgeworth:\nWe see. Continue.White:\nSurprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were reading your papers until you heard that sound?\nWhite:\nBut of course. I am no snoop, peeping out of windows at night.\nPhoenix:\n(No snoop? Yeah, right! You've made a career out of snooping!)White:\nIt was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nS-spiky-haired!?White:\nNeedless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat you just said directly conflicts with Miss May's testimony! Miss May clearly stated that the assailant looked like a \"girl\"!\nWhite:\nI've always been proud of my eyesight, Mr. Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nJust what is your eyesight?\nWhite:\nCounting both eyes... 40!\nPhoenix:\n40!? Don't add them together!\nJudge:\nI think the witness is trying to say his eyesight is good.\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what did you do then?White:\nI called Miss May over at once. She, too, was surprised of course.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Miss May doing at that time?\nWhite:\nShe had just finished watching a soap opera on the TV, and was weeping openly.\nPhoenix:\nDid you know she had been tapping the Fey office phone?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIrrelevant! That has nothing to do with the case at hand.\nWhite:\nI care not. I will answer the lawyer's bold inquiry. Miss May was acting alone when she tapped the phone of this Fey woman.\nPhoenix:\nYou'd make a good politician, Mr. White.\nWhite:\nHo hoh! After all, I am \"El Presidente.\"\nJudge:\nPlease continue.White:\nThe victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan you be a little more detailed about that? I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened.\nWhite:\nOf course! Comprende! I understand! The victim was attacked, by you, and ran to the left. You gave chase, and struck her down!\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure?\nWhite:\nAs you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect!\nJudge:\nPerhaps you could change your testimony to reflect this new detail.\nChanges statement from \"The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!\" to \"The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!\"White:\nThe victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nWhite:\nHow many times must I say it? I am abso-posi-lutely perfect! End of story!\nPhoenix:\n(How many times must I hear that?)\nMaya:\nPsst! Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as a little odd?Present May Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait right there!\"White:\nFinally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... \"impaction\"? Don't you mean just \"impact\"?\nWhite:\nRidiculosity! I think you need to brush up on your language skills!\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, perhaps I'd better leave the whole language thing alone...)Phoenix:\n(Did Edgeworth \"prep\" this guy, too, I wonder? Anyway, I'd better find a weakness in there...)Phoenix:\nWait right there! Mr. White, you've dug your own grave!White:\nWhat is this!?Phoenix:\nYou said the victim ran to the \"left.\" But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran \"right\"!White:\n...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.Phoenix:\nI think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?White:\n! Very strange... I did see her run to the left... I did.Maya:\nPhoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.Phoenix:\nTrue. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)Judge:\nMr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nMiss May says \"right,\" and Mr. White says \"left.\" Can you explain this contradiction to the court?Mr. White is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs Mr. White testified, Mia ran to the left.\nJudge:\nBut... But if that's the case... Why would she run in the opposite direction from the door?\nPhoenix:\nShe did not. She was running towards the door, Your Honor.\nEdgeworth:\nBwah! Now you're the one making a contradiction, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nNot at all.\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Miss May is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs Miss May has stated, Mia ran to the right after she was attacked.\nWhite:\nWhat is this? I am not fashioning fabrications, I assure you! That lady ran to the left! I am sure of it!\nPhoenix:\nThen there can be only one explanation.\nEdgeworth:\nEh...? And that is?\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Both are right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBoth witnesses are telling the truth. (For once...)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! I doubt it! Er, rather, that does not clear up the contradiction!\nPhoenix:\nThere is one scenario that would explain their conflicting accounts.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Phoenix:\nObviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!Judge:\nMr. Wright! What do you mean?Edgeworth:\nYes, what do you mean, he was not \"viewing the crime from the hotel\"!? If he was not in the hotel, where could he have been!?Phoenix:\nIn the law offices of Fey & Co., of course! More specifically, he was standing here! (Time to show the court where Mr. White was standing!) (Changed from [Show the court where Mr. White was standing!] in the original release)Present killer's location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is where he was!\"Present victim's location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's where he was!\nEdgeworth:\nM-Mr. Wright! We are not fools! How could he have been exactly where the victim was standing!?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh... oh, right!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Your Honor! Sorry! Let me try that again...\nLeads back to:\n\"Time to the court where Mr. White was standing!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's where he was!\nJudge:\nHold it right there, Mr. Wright! If he was there during the very act of murder... That would make him an accomplice!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nImpossible! There was no one other than the criminal and victim in the room! There is no evidence, no proof to the contrary! None!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry! Er... let me try that again!\nLeads back to:\n\"Time to show the court where Mr. White was standing!\"Phoenix:\nThis is where he was! Look! When the victim ran for the door... If he was watching from this point, to him it would appear that she ran to the \"left.\"Edgeworth:\nPlease! This is no time for jokes in ill taste! That is where the killer was standing!Judge:\nOrder! I will have order! Anyone disturbing the order of this courtroom will be held in contempt! Mr. Wright! What are you suggesting!?White:\nR-r-rapscallion!!!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThe postulations of the defense are a distortion of the truth, Your Honor!Judge:\nIndeed. They do seem a bit far-fetched...White:\n... Ho hoh hoh! You provide us with so much entertainment, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:\n(What now!? He's... laughing!?)White:\nThe hilarity of the moment made me remember something... It appears I have been unclear, and for this, I apologize. Mr. Your Honor... Might I be allowed to testify once more?Judge:\nVery well, let's hear your revised testimony.Phoenix:\n(Good luck. You can't fix a broken testimony, buddy!)Witness Testimony-- She Ran to the \"Left\" --White:\nMiss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!\nWhen you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left.\nAnd then you hit her, savagely!

You hit her twice!\nDon't you remember, Mr. Lawyer?Judge:\nHmm... That does seem to make sense. Will you be cross-examining the witness's testimony?Phoenix:\nYou bet I will!

Nah, I'm just teasing. I've been great! I'm finally getting used to having my own place.Mia:\nThat's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.???:\nI know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you?Mia:\nSharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.???:\nI gotcha. So, what is it this time?Mia:\nIt's... a clock.???:\nA clock?Mia:\nYeah, it's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.???:\nHey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!Mia:\nNow, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.???:\nHuh? It's not working? That's lame!Mia:\nI had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.???:\nPapers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.Mia:\nCan you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then.???:\nOkay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger.Mia:\nOkay, okay.

She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay!Phoenix:\nThat smell... Blood!???:\n... *sob* Sis...Phoenix:\n(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?Chief!!!Phoenix:\nWho are you????:\n...Phoenix:\n(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:\nChief...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroken glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSome shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.\n\n\n\n\nChair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.\n\n\n\n\nMia Fey's body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nChief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. \"The Thinker\" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.\nThe Thinker added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.\nGlass Shards added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nNothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?\n\n\n\n\nMia Fey's body (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.\n\n\n\n\n\"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co.

How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a large building right across from the office. The \"Gatewater Hotel.\" A nice, luxurious place.\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAll the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.\n\n\n\n\nComputer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSurprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office d√©cor: \"Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple.\"\n\n\n\n\nLedger book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.\n\n\n\n\nCorded phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nRight! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.\n???:\nPolice!? Please, come quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...\n\n\n\n\nCorded phone (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe phone receiver is missing a few screws. I'd better not use it.Fey & Co.

I'd better not touch the door knob.\n\n\n\n\nPainting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA large painting. I guess you'd call this \"modern art.\" I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.\n\n\n\n\nReception desk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe reception desk.

Sis...!\nPhoenix:\n(So she was already dead.)\n\n\n\n\nYou and the Chief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're the chief's...?\nMaya:\nSister.

You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am.Maya:\nW-what?Phoenix:\nMia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:\n(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)Maya:\nOh! It's you! The lawyer...

You're doing just fine!\nPhoenix:\n(Who's trying to cheer up who here!?)\nMaya:\n... I knew it. No one will believe me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nEven you-- when you found me in the office.

That is, unless you want to be found guilty.\"Maya:\nThat's what she said!Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nI-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you...Phoenix:\nNo, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia...Maya:\n...

This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.\nPhoenix:\nA-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?\nMaya:\nOh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.\nPhoenix:\nA s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)\n\n\n\n\nThe day of the crime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about the day of the murder?\nMaya:\nYes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.\nPhoenix:\nEvidence?\nMaya:\nYes. That clock shaped like \"The Thinker.\"\nPhoenix:\n(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?\nMaya:\nUm, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?\nPhoenix:\nH-her own voice!?\nMaya:\nYes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.\nPhoenix:\nYou recorded it!\nMaya:\nYeah! I forgot how to delete those things.\n\n\n\n\nThe day of the crime (after clearing \"Your cell phone\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.\nMaya:\nNo, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.\nPhoenix:\n(That's \"The Thinker\" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?\nMaya:\nIt was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.\n\n\n\n\nYour cell phone (appears after \"The day of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!\nMaya:\nRight! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.\nMaya:\nI'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?\nPhoenix:\nSure, thanks.\nMaya's Memo added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nYour cell phone (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone?

A, er, medium-in-training.\nMaya:\nThat's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.\nPhoenix:\nWait a second, you said the \"Fey Family\"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?\nMaya:\nOf course! She left the mountain to \"follow her career,\" she said. Her powers were first-class, too!\nPhoenix:\n(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!\nMaya:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?\nMaya:\nYes. ...In training.\nPhoenix:\nWell, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!\nMaya:\n...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I thought that would be too easy.)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about the murder weapon...\nMaya:\nPoor Sis... *sniff*\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. Better not ask her about this now.)\n\n\n\n\nGlass Shards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis was lying next to the chief's body...\nMaya:\nI saw that too. They said they thought these were pieces of a broken light stand.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that seems about right. (Though I'd never heard of a glass light stand before this...)\n\n\n\n\nReceipt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nRemember that receipt?\nMaya:\nY-you mean the one with my name on it?\nPhoenix:\nAny idea why she...\nMaya:\nAbsolutely none!

You're just like the detective.\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it!

She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me?Phoenix:\n(Hmm...)Accept\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSure, why not? I'll go ask.\nMaya:\nThank you so much! I have no one else to turn to...\nPhoenix:\n...? Say, what about your parents...?\nMaya:\n... ... ...\nPhoenix:\nI... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me.\nMaya:\nThank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00.\nPhoenix:\nW-what!?

I think this is the kind of thing you should really do yourself.\nMaya:\n...You're right. ...\nPhoenix:\nSomething wrong?\nMaya:\nActually, I asked the police to contact him, and they tried calling a few times. Nobody could get a hold of him!\nPhoenix:\nThey couldn't find him?\nMaya:\nI have no one left to ask!\nPhoenix:\n...? Say, what about your parents...?\nMaya:\n... ... ...\nPhoenix:\nO-okay! Don't worry, I'll go ask him for you.\nMaya:\nY-you will?

Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia.\n\n\n\n\nMovie poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe sky is blue, and so am I...

You want to know the results, eh?\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\nNow don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all!\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nMia (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, Mia's death was instantaneous.\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.\nPhoenix:\nYou knew her, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nSure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.\n\n\n\n\nMaya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, about Maya...\nGumshoe:\nYeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!\nPhoenix:\nW-why do you say that?\nGumshoe:\nThe city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nI'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth (appears after \"Maya\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nProsecutor Edgeworth...\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?\n\n\n\nOf course I do!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his \"guilty\" verdict.\nGumshoe:\nAww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.\nPhoenix:\n(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)\nLeads to:\n\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"\n\n\n\n\nOf course not!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNever heard of him.\nGumshoe:\nWhoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!\nPhoenix:\n(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a \"guilty\" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)\nLeads to:\n\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering, do you know anything about this?\nGumshoe:\nThat statue? That's the murder weapon.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)\n\n\n\n\nGlass Shards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere was broken glass at the crime scene, right?\nGumshoe:\nHmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.\n\n\n\n\nReceipt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure that Mia wrote it herself?\nGumshoe:\nGiven the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.\nPhoenix:\n(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)\n\n\n\n\nMaya's Memo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?\nGumshoe:\nOh that? I have that.\nPhoenix:\nDo you think you could give it back?\nGumshoe:\nSure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)\n\n\n\nTell him straight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)\nGumshoe:\nSomething the matter?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!\nGumshoe:\nNope. I know nothing, pal!\nPhoenix:\nThat cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!\nGumshoe:\nUrk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!\nPhoenix:\nImpressive! You're quite the detective.\nGumshoe:\nUh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.\nLeads to:\n\"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\"\n\n\n\n\nTell him not-so-straight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?)\nGumshoe:\nSomething the matter?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, um...

Hmm... it says \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo\"... \"The Steel Samurai\"... that action hero on TV?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you see that strap is a collector's item...

I'll be heading out now.Gumshoe:\nOh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!Phoenix:\n... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?Gumshoe:\nYeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:\n(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:\nAhah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:\n(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.)

My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.\nPhoenix:\n(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)\n\n\n\n\nYour mother (appears after \"Your family\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Ruined\"...?)\nMaya:\nAfter that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would \"become a lawyer\" and she left the mountain.\nPhoenix:\n... So, you live by yourself?\nMaya:\nYes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers!

It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...\nPhoenix:\nWait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?\nMaya:\nThe police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.\nPhoenix:\nWow... So, what happened?\nMaya:\nThe case was solved... we thought.\nPhoenix:\nYou \"thought\"...?\nMaya:\nThe man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nMaya:\nThe police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.\nPhoenix:\nI see.\nMaya:\n... White...\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me? White?\nMaya:\nThat was his name. My sister told me.\nPhoenix:\nWhite?

You know, you're cute when you blush.\nPhoenix:\n(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh.

Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.)???:\n*Ah-HHHHEM!*Phoenix:\n(If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!)Grossberg:\nAh hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me?Phoenix:\nUh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!)Grossberg:\nHmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now?Phoenix:\nY-yes, well... yes.Grossberg:\nAnd what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed!Phoenix:\n(Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?)Grossberg:\nHmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it!Phoenix:\nUm... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey.Grossberg:\n...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on.Phoenix:\n(Hmm? Why the strange reaction?)Grossberg:\nA-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible.Phoenix:\nW-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!?Grossberg:\nUrk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion.Phoenix:\n(What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour refusal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHow can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case!\nGrossberg:\nHmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see!\nPhoenix:\nBut the client is Mia Fey's sister!\nGrossberg:\nHmm... ahem.\nPhoenix:\nMia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands.\nGrossberg:\nYes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye.\nPhoenix:\nCreep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.\nGrossberg:\n*grumble*... Think not.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Did you say something?\nGrossberg:\nI think not, I said.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what do you mean?\nGrossberg:\nI'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy.\nPhoenix:\nWhy!?\nGrossberg:\nI... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you.\nPhoenix:\n(What's going on here!?)\n\n\n\n\nMia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know Mia Fey...?\nGrossberg:\n... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see.\nPhoenix:\nA \"mission\"?\nGrossberg:\nYou could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one.\n\n\n\n\nThat painting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's... quite a painting.\nGrossberg:\nAhah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!\nPhoenix:\n(I wasn't interested...)\nGrossberg:\nIt's not for sale!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not buying! (Geez!)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrossberg:\nVery sorry, but I've got nothing to say regarding this matter.Fey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:\n...

(Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:\nThank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:\nIf we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:\nWitness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:\nSir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nVery well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:\nAnd the cause of death?Gumshoe:\nLoss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of \"The Thinker\" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:\nThe court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:\n(They're still calling it a \"statue\"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nNow, Detective...Gumshoe:\nY-yes sir!Edgeworth:\nYou immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:\nHmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this \"hard evidence.\"Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!\nThere were two people there already:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!\nWhy? We had a witness account describing her!\nThe witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:\nHmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:\n(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:\nSomething the matter?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho did you say you got a call from?\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:\nThere were two people there already:Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?\nGumshoe:\nHmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!\nPhoenix:\nTh-that's pretty fast!\nGumshoe:\nOur motto this month is \"quick response\"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.\nGumshoe:\nYes sir!Gumshoe:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure it was us?\nGumshoe:\nListen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy's that? What's your reason?Gumshoe:\nWhy? We had a witness account describing her!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on just one second!\"Gumshoe:\nThe witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on just one second!\"Phoenix:\n(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)Phoenix:\nHold on just one second!Gumshoe:\nY-yeah?Phoenix:\nIf I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had \"hard evidence\" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:\nHuh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:\nI heard you say it!Judge:\nYou did say it.Edgeworth:\nYou said it.Phoenix:\nExactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was \"hard evidence\"!?Gumshoe:\nWh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:\nThat's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:\nUmm...Phoenix:\n(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:\n... Yes.Phoenix:\n(Gah!)Gumshoe:\nSorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:\nVery well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!\nOn it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!\nLab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!\nAlso, there was blood found on the victim's finger!\nBefore she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\nHow you like that? That's my \"hard evidence\"!Judge:\nHmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nY-Your Honor?Judge:\nWhy didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:\nAh... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:\nTry to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd did you find any evidence?\nGumshoe:\nNow, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)Gumshoe:\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nJust because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!\nGumshoe:\nHo hoh!

(Urk!)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...!)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\"\n\n\n\n\nMiss May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell... it could have been the witness, Miss May!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on.

S-so it was you!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nEdgeworth:\nListen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements!

I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.\nPhoenix:\nDon't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?\nGumshoe:\nAh, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nStop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!\nJudge:\nOrder!

You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?Gumshoe:\nWh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?Phoenix:\nYou have it backwards, Detective.Gumshoe:\nB-backwards?Phoenix:\nThe victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it!

The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.Judge:\nI suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.Phoenix:\n(Darn! This isn't good!)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!Judge:\nLet the witness Miss April May take the stand.Phoenix:\n(Exactly what part of her is \"innocent\"...?)Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name, please.April:\nApril May! At your service! *wink*Judge:\nOrder! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking!

She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)Edgeworth:\nTell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?April:\nUm... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.Edgeworth:\nAnd this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?April:\nMmm... that's right, big boy.Judge:\nPlease testify to the court about what you saw.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:\nIt was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!\nAnd then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!\nThe one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!\nThen the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!\nBut that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!\nThen the woman with long hair...\nShe kinda... slumped.\nThe end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWell, Your Honor?Judge:\nI see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...Phoenix:\nW-wait, Your Honor!Judge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nWhat about my cross-examination!?Judge:\nI thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...Phoenix:\nH-hey! How dare you!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?Yes, I'm doing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to!

That's it!?)\nJudge:\nVery well.\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! Hold on!\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?\nPhoenix:\nYes yes yes!

Were you expecting to see something?\nApril:\nOh, well, um... gee!\nPhoenix:\n(What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)\nApril:\nI sort of, y'know.

I will not have you badgering my witness!\nPhoenix:\nB-badgering?\nEdgeworth:\nYou insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed.\n(Yeah! Yeah!

Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?\nEdgeworth:\nThere was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(He's right...)\n\n\n\nYep, he's right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Her testimony certainly does make sense...

You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!April:\n...!Phoenix:\nNo one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!April:\nBut... but!Judge:\nStill, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...Phoenix:\nShe was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?April:\nRowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.Judge:\nMiss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.April:\nI'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl.

I did!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhere did this weapon come from?\nApril:\nShe picked it up from the desk!\nJudge:\nI see. What sort of weapon was it?April:\nThat... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA... clock? (Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?)\nApril:\nW-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all.\nPhoenix:\n(No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!)Present The Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Miss May.\"Phoenix:\n(Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.)Phoenix:\nMiss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.April:\nRevealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...Phoenix:\nYou just said that this statue of \"The Thinker\" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!April:\nUrp!Phoenix:\nAnother person in much the same position as you recently called this a \"clock,\" too... And he was found guilty... of murder!Judge:\nOrder! Order!Phoenix:\nMiss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?April:\nOooh... urp!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThe witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!Judge:\nYes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)Judge:\n... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.Phoenix:\n(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)April:\nHuh? What? So... what happens now?Phoenix:\nWhat happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?April:\nWhat...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!Phoenix:\nSo, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!April:\nN-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!Edgeworth:\nThe law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!Judge:\nHmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...She couldn't have heard it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou have proof that she could not?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nEdgeworth:\nAmateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing.\nPhoenix:\nThen I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard...\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution denies your request!\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!? On what grounds?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Objection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!)\nJudge:\nReady to proceed, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"No, Your Honor!\"It couldn't have rung\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, members of the court...\"Phoenix:\nYour Honor, members of the court...

Are they...?\nJudge:\nThis clock has graver problems than dead batteries!\nLeads to:\n\"This clock is missing its clockwork!\"Judge:\nThis clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?Phoenix:\nIt is as you can see. The \"clock\" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!April:\nF-fat!?Phoenix:\nWell, Miss May?Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk.Phoenix:\n?Edgeworth:\nQuite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)Edgeworth:\nI'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!Judge:\n! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.Edgeworth:\nAnd that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?Edgeworth:\nHo hoh! Impossible, of course...Phoenix:\nI have proof.Edgeworth:\nW-what!?Phoenix:\nWasn't it you who told me \"proof is everything\"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the \"proof\" you like so much!

I think I blew it.)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future.\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor!\nLeads back to:\n\"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...\"Phoenix:\nTake a look at this!Judge:\nHmm. That's a very cute cell phone.April:\nOoh hoo! You have a girlie phone!Phoenix:\nW-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!Judge:\nOrder! Order!Edgeworth:\nThe defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!Phoenix:\nPerhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?Edgeworth:\n*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)Phoenix:\n(I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.)

Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?April:\n... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*Judge:\nSo the witness had seen it before. That would make sense.

Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?April:\n...Judge:\nHmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?Phoenix:\n(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...You held it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! When was this!?\nPhoenix:\nWhen she used it to strike the victim! When else?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nApril May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made \"The Thinker\" ring! That's when you heard it!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\nW-what's that supposed to mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt was you who just proved that \"The Thinker\" was empty!\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(S-she can't prove it! She did it!)\nApril:\nIt would be MY pleasure!\nPhoenix:\nN-no way!\nApril:\nYes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!\nEdgeworth:\nIncidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know \"The Thinker\" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!\nJudge:\nWell... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that already.\nPhoenix:\nTake another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia!

Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWHAAAAT!?\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof.

I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness.\nJudge:\nI see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nRight. On with the cross-examination.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)\nJudge:\nThen I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?\nEdgeworth:\nNone, Your Honor. She's the last.\nPhoenix:\n(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait!

Are you prepared to accept my condition?\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!\nLeads to:\n\"Very well!

She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(9:00... the time of the murder!)Bellboy:\nI brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Precisely\" 9:00, then?\nBellboy:\nPrecisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM.\nPhoenix:\nHow can you be so sure!?\nBellboy:\nMiss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. \"Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!\" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Why would she be so particular about the time?)Bellboy:\nAnd I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou are sure it was Miss April May herself?\nBellboy:\nAb-SO-lutely, sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Ab-SO-lutely\"...?\nBellboy:\nYes, sir. As in, \"so very absolutely,\" sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.\nPhoenix:\nHow come you're so very certain!?\nBellboy:\nWell, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an \"embrasser,\" sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Embrasser\"!? Is that French for \"embrace\"?\nBellboy:\nIt's French for \"kiss,\" sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.\nPhoenix:\nWh-why would she have done that...?\nBellboy:\nI believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)Phoenix:\n(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)After pressing fourth and fifth statements:Phoenix:\n... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here!Judge:\nHmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand.Phoenix:\n(I can't let this happen... can I?)Protest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"W-wait! Please wait!\"Give up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No...! If I give up now, I lose everything... If I just give up the case, I'd be giving up the very reason I became a lawyer!)\nLeads to:\n\"W-wait! Please wait!\"Phoenix:\nW-wait! Please wait!Judge:\nYes? Does the defense have something to add?Phoenix:\nOne last question... let me ask one last question!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!Judge:\nNow, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all.Phoenix:\n(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)Check-in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nT-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May.\nBellboy:\nOh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really.\nPhoenix:\nI see...¬†? Excuse me... what exactly was a \"disappointment\"?\nBellboy:\nWell, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there.\nPhoenix:\n(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?\nBellboy:\nAh! Oh... er... rather, quite!\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Room service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nT-tell me again about er... room service!\nBellboy:\nA-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall.\nPhoenix:\nI see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?\nBellboy:\nY-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?\nBellboy:\nAh! Oh... er... rather, quite!\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Bed making\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day.\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question.\nBellboy:\nYes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see.\nPhoenix:\nI see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say?\nBellboy:\nEh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir?\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Edgeworth:\nI object! That was... objectionable!Judge:\n... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.Bellboy:\nEr... yes, I see.Phoenix:\nWhy did you not mention this in your testimony!?Bellboy:\nW-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!Phoenix:\n(Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!Bellboy:\nAh, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...Phoenix:\n!Bellboy:\nHe asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.Edgeworth:\nOof! Y-you fool!Phoenix:\nI've done it... I've won!Phoenix:\nMiss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?Bellboy:\nYes, sir.Phoenix:\nThen, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?Bellboy:\nThat's right, sir.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nYour Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nAnd who, Mr. Wright! Who is this \"other person\"! (Changed from [Who! Who is this 'other person'!] in the original release)Phoenix:\nSimple, it was...Miss April May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNone other than Miss April May!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nEh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder!\nPhoenix:\nOh... right.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!\nLeads back to:\n\"Simple, it was...\"The man with Miss May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The man who checked in with Miss May!\"The Bellboy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was the bellboy and none other!\nJudge:\nWell, this comes as some surprise...\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, Mr. Wright... It was the bellboy who confirmed Miss May's alibi... And this in turn confirms the bellboy's alibi! He was in the hotel!\nPhoenix:\nWell, s-sure... if you put it that way...\nEdgeworth:\nI do put it that way, and I trust you will too!\nPhoenix:\nBut what if they were in cahoots!\nJudge:\nYou have evidence of this?\nPhoenix:\nUm... no, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!\nLeads back to:\n\"Simple, it was...\"Phoenix:\nThe man who checked in with Miss May!Edgeworth:\nOof!Phoenix:\nYour Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!Edgeworth:\nM-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late...Phoenix:\n\"Too late\"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!Edgeworth:\nOof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!Judge:\nEnough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood?Edgeworth:\nYes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor.Judge:\nThat is all today for the trial of Maya Fey.

What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?Phoenix:\nI heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.Maya:\nYes sir!Phoenix:\nI'm going to find out more about this man.Maya:\nDo you think he was the one who...?Phoenix:\nMaybe so.Maya:\nSis...Phoenix:\nDon't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.Maya:\nI'm counting on you!Phoenix:\nI asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that hasn't been stricken from the record.

I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nThat's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial.

So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged.Phoenix:\n(What a fruitcake!)White:\nHmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this!Phoenix:\n(What does he mean by that?)White:\nNo matter.

What a shock it was to hear what she has done!\nPhoenix:\n\"What she has done\"... You mean the wiretap?\nWhite:\nIndeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods!

The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly.\nWhite:\n... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually...

Is that kind of control really possible?)White:\nI don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?Phoenix:\nMr. Grossberg's... yes.White:\nThen you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you?

But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you!\nGrossberg:\nW-w-what! My boy!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Grossberg. The other day, there was a giant painting hanging on that wall. I saw that painting again, today. It was in the CEO's office of Bluecorp. It was a present, wasn't it?\nGrossberg:\nWell, my boy, you have a splendid imagination!\nPhoenix:\nI... I don't understand how you could...\nGrossberg:\nThat's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I guess I was wrong. But it just seemed so right!)\nLeads back to Talk optionsPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrossberg:\nSorry, my boy. I don't think I can help you with that.Grossberg:\nRedd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now...Phoenix:\n(15 years...!)Grossberg:\nAll because of the \"DL-6 Incident,\" as you may have guessed.Phoenix:\n(The name on the back of those photographs!)Grossberg:\nAs you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did.Phoenix:\n(So that's the connection!)Grossberg:\nIt is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.Phoenix:\nImpossible? Why!?Grossberg:\nHe has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Grossberg:\nThey are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DL-6 Incident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat is the \"DL-6 Incident\"?\nGrossberg:\n\"DL-6\" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium.\nPhoenix:\n(A medium...?)\nGrossberg:\nHer name was Misty Fey.\nPhoenix:\n(Fey!)\nGrossberg:\nIndeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud.\nPhoenix:\n(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)\nGrossberg:\nI did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident.\n\n\n\n\nReason for blackmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBut why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?\nGrossberg:\nThe DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.\nPhoenix:\nYou told White?\nGrossberg:\nHe offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail.\nPhoenix:\n... I see.\nGrossberg:\n... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office.\nPhoenix:\nMia's office...?\nGrossberg:\nShe followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found.Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Reason for blackmail\" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices)Phoenix:\nIt's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAll the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here. They're in alphabetical order. Let's take a look... Which file should I look at...?\n\n\n\nFile \"A-I\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLet's see if there's \"A\" record in this file that catches my \"I.\" \"A\"... \"B\"... \"F\"! \"Misty Fey.\" That's Mia and Maya's mother. Hmmm... Should I take a look?\n\n\n\nRead it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is...\"\nPhoenix:\nHmm. The record stops there. ... So Mia knew Grossberg...\nLeads back to examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave it be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't think it has much to do with the current case.

Nothing much in here. Maybe I'll just skim some of this?\n\n\n\nSkim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* Well, no harm in flipping through a bit, I guess... The biggest part's here at the end in \"S\"... \"Suicide\"? Eww... She has a collection of suicide reports. There's politicians... policemen... ... ...! There's writing on most of these in pencil. \"White\"...? This is Mia's handwriting. Wait, I get it! Mia thought he was involved in these \"suicides\"! White drove them all to... ... I can use these newspaper clippings. Hmm... let's find the most disturbing one...\nNewspaper Clipping added to the Court Record.\nLeads back to examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave it be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNah... this is taking too long.

I'm not sure reading suicide accounts will be very good for my mood... I think that's enough reading for today.\nLeads back to examination\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave 'em\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't see much point in checking files that are missing all the key parts. *yawn* I give up.\nLeads back to examinationGrossberg Law OfficesPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewspaper Clipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI found this in Mia's files...\nGrossberg:\nSo she was investigating Redd White, as I expected.

But it seems the message has not yet penetrated your thick skull... Stop bothering me! If you try my patience further, I fear a nasty accident may occur. Do I make myself clear?Phoenix:\n(Transparent...)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiss May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think we're past needing to talk about April May.

I need some evidence I can use as ammo...)\nWhite:\nWhat's wrong? Is something stuck to my face? Why yes! There's my eyes, and my nose, and my mouth... But of course I jest. You need not restrain your mirth, my friend! It is okay to indulge in my cosmopolitan sense of humor. I will not think less of you.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewspaper Clipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This is the only clue that Mia left me... I'd better make this one count!) Mr. White... see this?

The very next day he took his own life.\nWhite:\nAnd this concerns me how...?\nPhoenix:\nI found this article in Mia's office.\nWhite:\nMiss Mia...?\nPhoenix:\nShe had a file filled with articles like this.

Then, when you revealed it, he was driven to suicide!\nWhite:\nMr. Lawyer. I know nothing of this. And, even in the highly unlikely event that I did do such a thing... All I would have done is provide \"information.\" That is not a crime in this country.\nPhoenix:\n(Gah!

You are a mere lawyer! As was Miss Mia.Phoenix:\nHow dare you!White:\nI'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled. No lawyer of any worth will defend you. I have friends in the local lawyer's association, you see.

So... what was the proper term for \"secretary\" again...? Anyway, Miss May ordered room service for 9:00. It happened soon after the room service arrived.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. That's what Miss May said, too.)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nTrue, the bellboy who brought the coffee saw Miss May.

Don't add them together!\nJudge:\nI think the witness is trying to say his eyesight is good.\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what did you do then?White:\nI called Miss May over at once.

That has nothing to do with the case at hand.\nWhite:\nI care not. I will answer the lawyer's bold inquiry.

I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened.\nWhite:\nOf course! Comprende! I understand! The victim was attacked, by you, and ran to the left. You gave chase, and struck her down!\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure?\nWhite:\nAs you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect!\nJudge:\nPerhaps you could change your testimony to reflect this new detail.\nChanges statement from \"The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!\" to \"The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!\"White:\nThe victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nWhite:\nHow many times must I say it? I am abso-posi-lutely perfect! End of story!\nPhoenix:\n(How many times must I hear that?)\nMaya:\nPsst! Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as a little odd?Present May Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait right there!\"White:\nFinally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... \"impaction\"? Don't you mean just \"impact\"?\nWhite:\nRidiculosity! I think you need to brush up on your language skills!\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, perhaps I'd better leave the whole language thing alone...)Phoenix:\n(Did Edgeworth \"prep\" this guy, too, I wonder? Anyway, I'd better find a weakness in there...)Phoenix:\nWait right there! Mr. White, you've dug your own grave!White:\nWhat is this!?Phoenix:\nYou said the victim ran to the \"left.\" But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran \"right\"!White:\n...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.Phoenix:\nI think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?White:\n! Very strange... I did see her run to the left... I did.Maya:\nPhoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.Phoenix:\nTrue. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)Judge:\nMr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nMiss May says \"right,\" and Mr. White says \"left.\" Can you explain this contradiction to the court?Mr. White is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs Mr. White testified, Mia ran to the left.\nJudge:\nBut... But if that's the case... Why would she run in the opposite direction from the door?\nPhoenix:\nShe did not. She was running towards the door, Your Honor.\nEdgeworth:\nBwah! Now you're the one making a contradiction, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nNot at all.\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Miss May is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs Miss May has stated, Mia ran to the right after she was attacked.\nWhite:\nWhat is this? I am not fashioning fabrications, I assure you! That lady ran to the left! I am sure of it!\nPhoenix:\nThen there can be only one explanation.\nEdgeworth:\nEh...? And that is?\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Both are right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBoth witnesses are telling the truth. (For once...)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! I doubt it! Er, rather, that does not clear up the contradiction!\nPhoenix:\nThere is one scenario that would explain their conflicting accounts.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Phoenix:\nObviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!Judge:\nMr. Wright! What do you mean?Edgeworth:\nYes, what do you mean, he was not \"viewing the crime from the hotel\"!? If he was not in the hotel, where could he have been!?Phoenix:\nIn the law offices of Fey & Co., of course! More specifically, he was standing here!

They do seem a bit far-fetched...White:\n... Ho hoh hoh! You provide us with so much entertainment, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:\n(What now!? He's... laughing!?)White:\nThe hilarity of the moment made me remember something... It appears I have been unclear, and for this, I apologize. Mr. Your Honor...

Allow me to explain.Phoenix:\n(I really don't like the way this is headed...)Edgeworth:\nAs you know, Mr. White is the CEO of Bluecorp. He ordered his secretary, Miss April May, to tap the law offices of Ms. Fey.Judge:\nWhat does that have to do...?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. The question is: when was the wiretap placed in the office, and by who?Phoenix:\nNo! You wouldn't!Edgeworth:\nMr. White. In order to place the wiretap, you entered Ms. Fey's office. Am I correct...?White:\n...¬†! C-correct! You are most correct, Miles!Phoenix:\nGive me a break!White:\nYes... in order to place the wiretap, I breached the Fey & Co. Law Offices! That is when I saw that accursed light stand!Judge:\nNow I'm confused. Please explain to the court what all this means, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nGladly, Your Honor. Mr. Phoenix Wright has made his position quite clear. He has determined that Mr. White knew the glass stand was in the office. He has shown that there was only one time Mr. White could have seen the stand: at the very moment of the murder! ([at] was capitalized in the original release) Thus, Mr. Wright would like you to believe that Mr. White was the murderer!Judge:\nI see.Edgeworth:\nHowever! It is a fact that Mr. White had been to that office well before the murder took place! When he went to place the wiretap! (Changed from [He went to place the wiretap!] in the original release) He could have seen the glass light stand then. Ergo, Mr. Phoenix Wright's theory is revealed for the baseless conjecture it is!Judge:\nMr. White! You will testify to the court about this wiretapping!

I feel faint.)Witness Testimony-- The Wiretapping --White:\nIt was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.\nI had entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices.\nOf course, I had done so to place the wiretap.\nThat is when I saw this glass light stand.Judge:\nHmm... So, you saw the stand before the night of the incident... And this is how you were able to identify what had fallen over. By the sound?White:\nCorrect! That is right.Judge:\nI see. Very well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine.Phoenix:\n(Gah!

Mr. Wright here is only trying to fluster you with baseless accusations!\nWhite:\nOh... oh right. Thank you, Miles.White:\nThen you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Thwap\"...? That doesn't sound like the \"savage\" attack from your earlier testimony...\nWhite:\nHo! Hoh hoh! Yes, well, I am a man of peace, you see.Maya:\nPhoenix! He's getting a lot less talkative.Phoenix:\nHe's probably afraid I'll catch him on something! (But it won't be easy!)Phoenix:\nLook at this!Judge:\nThese are the floor plans to the scene of the murder, yes?Phoenix:\nCorrect, Your Honor. Now, look... If you were to look through the window at the office... This is the area you would be able to see! Here! Well...? Note that the stand is not within the visible area! Well, Mr. White! What do you have to say to that!?White:\nEr... erp! Ri... dicu... losity...Phoenix:\nMr. White. If you were in the Gatewater hotel as you claim, you could not have seen the stand before it fell over! In fact, you wouldn't have been able to see it after it fell, either! There's no way you could have recognized the broken shards as a glass light stand! So, when did you see the stand, Mr. White? It must have been the moment that it fell! And the only place you could have seen that from... is inside the Fey Law Offices! In other words, you were at the scene of the crime, when the murder took place!White:\nGaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!Judge:\nMr... White?White:\n...Phoenix:\nMr. White.White:\n...Phoenix:\nYou did it, didn't you?White:\n... Mr. Your Honor. I... I... Miss Mia... ...Phoenix:\n(Heh. Looks like we're about to get our verdict!)Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThat's far enough, Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\nW-what!? (Urk! I forgot about Edgeworth!)Edgeworth:\nMr. White...White:\n...Edgeworth:\nI think the time has come. Shouldn't you confess your crime now, hmm?White:\nW... what?Edgeworth:\nI said, you should confess your crime. Ergo, confess that you placed the wiretap!Phoenix:\nThe w-wiretap!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! Explain to the court what you mean by this!Edgeworth:\nDistinguished members of of the court... Mr. White is slightly confused. Allow me to explain.Phoenix:\n(I really don't like the way this is headed...)Edgeworth:\nAs you know, Mr. White is the CEO of Bluecorp. He ordered his secretary, Miss April May, to tap the law offices of Ms. Fey.Judge:\nWhat does that have to do...?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. The question is: when was the wiretap placed in the office, and by who?Phoenix:\nNo! You wouldn't!Edgeworth:\nMr. White. In order to place the wiretap, you entered Ms. Fey's office. Am I correct...?White:\n...¬†! C-correct! You are most correct, Miles!Phoenix:\nGive me a break!White:\nYes... in order to place the wiretap, I breached the Fey & Co. Law Offices! That is when I saw that accursed light stand!Judge:\nNow I'm confused. Please explain to the court what all this means, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nGladly, Your Honor. Mr. Phoenix Wright has made his position quite clear. He has determined that Mr. White knew the glass stand was in the office. He has shown that there was only one time Mr. White could have seen the stand: at the very moment of the murder! ([at] was capitalized in the original release) Thus, Mr. Wright would like you to believe that Mr. White was the murderer!Judge:\nI see.Edgeworth:\nHowever! It is a fact that Mr. White had been to that office well before the murder took place! When he went to place the wiretap! (Changed from [He went to place the wiretap!] in the original release) He could have seen the glass light stand then. Ergo, Mr. Phoenix Wright's theory is revealed for the baseless conjecture it is!Judge:\nMr. White! You will testify to the court about this wiretapping! (Changed from [You will testify to the court about this wiretap!] in the original release)White:\nAhem. Leave it to me!Phoenix:\n(I... I feel faint.)Witness Testimony-- The Wiretapping --White:\nIt was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.\nI had entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices.\nOf course, I had done so to place the wiretap.\nThat is when I saw this glass light stand.Judge:\nHmm... So, you saw the stand before the night of the incident... And this is how you were able to identify what had fallen over. By the sound?White:\nCorrect! That is right.Judge:\nI see. Very well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine.Phoenix:\n(Gah! What am I supposed to do now...!?)Maya:\nGood luck, Phoenix...Cross Examination",

Nah, I'm just teasing. I've been great! I'm finally getting used to having my own place.Mia:\nThat's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.???:\nI know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you?Mia:\nSharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.???:\nI gotcha. So, what is it this time?Mia:\nIt's... a clock.???:\nA clock?Mia:\nYeah, it's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.???:\nHey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!Mia:\nNow, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.???:\nHuh? It's not working? That's lame!Mia:\nI had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.???:\nPapers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.Mia:\nCan you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up?

Chief...?Chief!!!Phoenix:\nWho are you????:\n...Phoenix:\n(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:\nChief...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroken glass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSome shards of glass are scattered on the floor.

She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. \"The Thinker\" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.\nThe Thinker added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.\nGlass Shards added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nNothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?\n\n\n\n\nMia Fey's body (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake.

About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA perfectly normal office desk.

Please, come quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...\n\n\n\n\nCorded phone (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe phone receiver is missing a few screws. I'd better not use it.Fey & Co.

Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.\nPhoenix:\nEvidence?\nMaya:\nYes. That clock shaped like \"The Thinker.\"\nPhoenix:\n(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?\nMaya:\nUm, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?\nPhoenix:\nH-her own voice!?\nMaya:\nYes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.\nPhoenix:\nYou recorded it!\nMaya:\nYeah!

She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.\nPhoenix:\n(That's \"The Thinker\" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.)

So, Mia was into this stuff too?\nMaya:\nOf course! She left the mountain to \"follow her career,\" she said. Her powers were first-class, too!\nPhoenix:\n(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!\nMaya:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?\nMaya:\nYes. ...In training.\nPhoenix:\nWell, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then?

She was... a beautiful person.\nPhoenix:\nYou knew her, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nSure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer.

He won't stop until he gets his \"guilty\" verdict.\nGumshoe:\nAww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.\nPhoenix:\n(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20.

The wood's been polished to a deep luster.\n\n\n\n\nPainting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.\n\n\n\n\nPotted plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Maya:\nHey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?Phoenix:\nSorry. I haven't seen him yet.Maya:\nI see...Phoenix:\n(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour family\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about your family?\nMaya:\nI only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.\nPhoenix:\n(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)\n\n\n\n\nYour mother (appears after \"Your family\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThe women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Ruined\"...?)\nMaya:\nAfter that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would \"become a lawyer\" and she left the mountain.\nPhoenix:\n... So, you live by yourself?\nMaya:\nYes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)\n\n\n\n\nYour mother's enemy (appears after \"Your mother\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, who was this man who, um, \"ruined\" your mother?\nMaya:\nAbout 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...\nPhoenix:\nWait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?\nMaya:\nThe police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.\nPhoenix:\nWow... So, what happened?\nMaya:\nThe case was solved... we thought.\nPhoenix:\nYou \"thought\"...?\nMaya:\nThe man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nMaya:\nThe police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.\nPhoenix:\nI see.\nMaya:\n... White...\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me? White?\nMaya:\nThat was his name. My sister told me.\nPhoenix:\nWhite? Hmm...Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHey, I got your cell phone back.\nMaya:\nOh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice?\n\n\nPhoenix:\n... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ...\n\n\nMaya:\nThank you.September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303April:\nWell! Hello there, handsome.Phoenix:\nUmm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)April:\nYou're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, \"Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!\" Tee hee!Phoenix:\n(Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.)April:\nGee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness!Phoenix:\n(I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here.\n\n\n\n\nFlowers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nOpen drawer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.)\"\n\n\n\n\nPainting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAh. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be \"still life\"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall.\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though.Phoenix:\n(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)April:\nHey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?Phoenix:\n(Upset!?

I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident.\nApril:\nOoh. \"Observe,\" \"incident\"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please?\nApril:\nLet me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy.)\n\n\n\n\nMiss May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, could you... just who exactly are you?\nApril:\nOooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me?\nPhoenix:\nN-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here!\nApril:\nTee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush.\nPhoenix:\n(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do?\nApril:\nWell... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy.)\n\n\n\n\nThis room\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you?\nApril:\nOooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television!\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer!\nApril:\nSay, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy.)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril:\nExcuse me, but I'm a witness? Police witness? You understand?

Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.)???:\n*Ah-HHHHEM!*Phoenix:\n(If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!)Grossberg:\nAh hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me?Phoenix:\nUh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!)Grossberg:\nHmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now?Phoenix:\nY-yes, well... yes.Grossberg:\nAnd what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed!Phoenix:\n(Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?)Grossberg:\nHmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it!Phoenix:\nUm... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey.Grossberg:\n...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on.Phoenix:\n(Hmm? Why the strange reaction?)Grossberg:\nA-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible.Phoenix:\nW-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!?Grossberg:\nUrk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion.Phoenix:\n(What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him!

Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see!\nPhoenix:\nBut the client is Mia Fey's sister!\nGrossberg:\nHmm... ahem.\nPhoenix:\nMia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands.\nGrossberg:\nYes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye.\nPhoenix:\nCreep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.\nGrossberg:\n*grumble*... Think not.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Did you say something?\nGrossberg:\nI think not, I said.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what do you mean?\nGrossberg:\nI'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy.\nPhoenix:\nWhy!?\nGrossberg:\nI... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you.\nPhoenix:\n(What's going on here!?)\n\n\n\n\nMia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know Mia Fey...?\nGrossberg:\n... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see.\nPhoenix:\nA \"mission\"?\nGrossberg:\nYou could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one.\n\n\n\n\nThat painting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's... quite a painting.\nGrossberg:\nAhah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!\nPhoenix:\n(I wasn't interested...)\nGrossberg:\nIt's not for sale!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not buying! (Geez!)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrossberg:\nVery sorry, but I've got nothing to say regarding this matter.Fey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:\n...

Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:\nThank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:\nIf we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:\nWitness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:\nSir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nVery well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:\nAnd the cause of death?Gumshoe:\nLoss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of \"The Thinker\" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:\nThe court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:\n(They're still calling it a \"statue\"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nNow, Detective...Gumshoe:\nY-yes sir!Edgeworth:\nYou immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct?

Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:\n(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:\nSomething the matter?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho did you say you got a call from?\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:\nThere were two people there already:Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?\nGumshoe:\nHmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!\nPhoenix:\nTh-that's pretty fast!\nGumshoe:\nOur motto this month is \"quick response\"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.\nGumshoe:\nYes sir!Gumshoe:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure it was us?\nGumshoe:\nListen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far!

I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy's that? What's your reason?Gumshoe:\nWhy? We had a witness account describing her!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on just one second!\"Gumshoe:\nThe witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on just one second!\"Phoenix:\n(I can't see a single contradiction in there!

Me?Phoenix:\nI heard you say it!Judge:\nYou did say it.Edgeworth:\nYou said it.Phoenix:\nExactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was \"hard evidence\"!?Gumshoe:\nWh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:\nThat's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:\nUmm...Phoenix:\n(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:\n... Yes.Phoenix:\n(Gah!)Gumshoe:\nSorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:\nVery well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!\nOn it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!\nLab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!\nAlso, there was blood found on the victim's finger!\nBefore she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\nHow you like that? That's my \"hard evidence\"!Judge:\nHmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nY-Your Honor?Judge:\nWhy didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:\nAh... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:\nTry to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd did you find any evidence?\nGumshoe:\nNow, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal.

Then who did write it, smarty-pants?\nPhoenix:\nWh-who? Um...\n\n\n\nThe killer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nTh-the killer! Anyone can see that!\nGumshoe:\nHoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!\nPhoenix:\nShe was framed!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?\nPhoenix:\nAh...

S-so it was you!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nEdgeworth:\nListen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements!

I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.\nPhoenix:\nDon't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?\nGumshoe:\nAh, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nStop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!\nJudge:\nOrder!

Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?Gumshoe:\nWh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?Phoenix:\nYou have it backwards, Detective.Gumshoe:\nB-backwards?Phoenix:\nThe victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. \"Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object.\" She died immediately!Gumshoe:\nBut...!Phoenix:\nNo \"but\"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!Judge:\nOrder! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?Phoenix:\nWh-when...!?The day of the murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI...

The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.Judge:\nI suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.Phoenix:\n(Darn! This isn't good!)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to call its next witness.

I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.Edgeworth:\nAnd this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?April:\nMmm... that's right, big boy.Judge:\nPlease testify to the court about what you saw.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:\nIt was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!\nAnd then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!\nThe one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!\nThen the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!\nBut that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!\nThen the woman with long hair...\nShe kinda... slumped.\nThe end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWell, Your Honor?Judge:\nI see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...Phoenix:\nW-wait, Your Honor!Judge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nWhat about my cross-examination!?Judge:\nI thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...Phoenix:\nH-hey! How dare you!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?Yes, I'm doing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to!

Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?\nEdgeworth:\nThere was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(He's right...)\n\n\n\nYep, he's right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Her testimony certainly does make sense...

You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!April:\n...!Phoenix:\nNo one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!April:\nBut... but!Judge:\nStill, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...Phoenix:\nShe was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?April:\nRowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.Judge:\nMiss May.

I did!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhere did this weapon come from?\nApril:\nShe picked it up from the desk!\nJudge:\nI see. What sort of weapon was it?April:\nThat... that clock!

So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.)Phoenix:\nMiss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.April:\nRevealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...Phoenix:\nYou just said that this statue of \"The Thinker\" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!April:\nUrp!Phoenix:\nAnother person in much the same position as you recently called this a \"clock,\" too... And he was found guilty... of murder!Judge:\nOrder! Order!Phoenix:\nMiss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?April:\nOooh... urp!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThe witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!Judge:\nYes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)Judge:\n... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.Phoenix:\n(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)April:\nHuh? What? So... what happens now?Phoenix:\nWhat happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?April:\nWhat...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!Phoenix:\nSo, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!April:\nN-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!Edgeworth:\nThe law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!Judge:\nHmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...She couldn't have heard it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou have proof that she could not?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nEdgeworth:\nAmateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing.\nPhoenix:\nThen I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard...\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution denies your request!\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!? On what grounds?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand!\nJudge:\nIndeed. Objection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!)\nJudge:\nReady to proceed, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"No, Your Honor!\"It couldn't have rung\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor, members of the court...\"Phoenix:\nYour Honor, members of the court...

Somehow... he knew!)Edgeworth:\nI'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!Judge:\n! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.Edgeworth:\nAnd that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?Edgeworth:\nHo hoh! Impossible, of course...Phoenix:\nI have proof.Edgeworth:\nW-what!?Phoenix:\nWasn't it you who told me \"proof is everything\"?

Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?Yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\"No\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!)\nJudge:\nThen, the court would like--\nPhoenix:\nHold on! P-please wait, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nY-yes...? So you do have an objection?\nPhoenix:\nUm, yes, well...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Your Honor, it's just...\nLeads to:\n\"The witness claims she had \"seen it before.\"\"Phoenix:\nThe witness claims she had \"seen it before.\" But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!Judge:\nWell then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.Present The Thinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's simple.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere is undeniable proof!\nEdgeworth:\nHah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece!\nJudge:\nHmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind?\nLeads back to:\n\"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.\"Phoenix:\nIt's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!April:\nW-whaaat!?Phoenix:\nA friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!April:\nI-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!Phoenix:\nMiss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?April:\nMmpf...Phoenix:\nOh? Excuses not on sale today?April:\nOooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!Judge:\nW-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!April:\nHrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*Phoenix:\n(S-scary...)Judge:\nMiss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?April:\n...Judge:\nHmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?Phoenix:\n(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...You held it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! When was this!?\nPhoenix:\nWhen she used it to strike the victim! When else?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nApril May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made \"The Thinker\" ring! That's when you heard it!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nPhoenix:\nW-what's that supposed to mean!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt was you who just proved that \"The Thinker\" was empty!\nPhoenix:\nOh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(S-she can't prove it! She did it!)\nApril:\nIt would be MY pleasure!\nPhoenix:\nN-no way!\nApril:\nYes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!\nEdgeworth:\nIncidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know \"The Thinker\" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!\nJudge:\nWell... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that already.\nPhoenix:\nTake another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]\nMia:\n[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]\nMaya:\n[Again? What's it this time?]\nMia:\n[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time!]\n\n...\n\nJudge:\nThey do mention \"The Thinker.\" But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\n\n\n\nPresent Wiretap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Have a look at this.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Your evidence, please!\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave a look at this.\nApril:\nAh! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...\nPhoenix:\nI found this in Miss May's room.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!\nPhoenix:\nMiss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew \"The Thinker\" was a clock! Am I wrong!?\nApril:\nI... I...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, this is ridiculous!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.\nApril:\nLa... laaa... lrrrrgf!\nJudge:\nWitness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?\nApril:\n...\nJudge:\nMiss May!\nApril:\nShut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!\n......\nApril:\nI-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!\nPhoenix:\n(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)\n\n\n\nYou did it, didn't you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMiss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?\nApril:\nAre you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\"\n\n\n\n\nWhy the wiretap?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMiss May... Why did you tap her phone?\nApril:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nApril:\nDo I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?\nPhoenix:\n(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that \"irrelevant\"!\nJudge:\nWhile this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?\nApril:\nAt the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, does the defense have anything to say?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent Wiretap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHave a look at this.\nApril:\nAh! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...\nPhoenix:\nI found this in Miss May's room.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!\nPhoenix:\nMiss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?\nApril:\nOooh. Oooooh!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, This is irrelevant!\nJudge:\nI'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.\nEdgeworth:\nThis is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?\nPhoenix:\nAbsolutely!\nEdgeworth:\nEven if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!\nEdgeworth:\nWHAAAAT!?\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I present the defendant's cell phone.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis! I think...\nJudge:\nThat's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! That was just a warm up!\nJudge:\nHmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI present the defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that.\nPhoenix:\nListen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia!

Maybe that wasn't the thing...)\nJudge:\nI'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again:\nLeads back to:\n\"How did the witness know \"The Thinker\" was a clock?\"You had heard about it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock!\nJudge:\nShe \"heard\"...?\nPhoenix:\nThat is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known \"The Thinker\" was a clock! And I can show you the proof!\nJudge:\nWell, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had \"heard\" the murder weapon was a clock.\n\n\n\nPresent Maya's Cell Phone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant's cell phone.\nJudge:\nYes, we've seen that already.\nPhoenix:\nTake another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.\nCellular:\n\n*beep*\n...\n\nMaya:\n[Mia!

A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops!\nPhoenix:\nSo you admit you tapped her phone!\nApril:\nHeh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl!\nPhoenix:\nReally? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!)\nApril:\nYou think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will!\nPhoenix:\nYou can't be serious! No way!\nApril:\nWay, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...\nPhoenix:\nR-room service!?\nApril:\nIce coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD.

Well, it's not so much a place as a... er...\nEdgeworth:\nCome to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nW-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, this court does not condone the presentation of evidence for \"practice.\" Let's see your evidence, for real this time, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"Show me evidence proving that the witness had \"heard\" the murder weapon was a clock.\"Judge:\nWell, does the defense have anything to say?Phoenix:\nUm, well... (Come on, think of something!)Call the bellboy as a witness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it!\nApril:\nI think you've sunken quite low enough already.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI object to calling the bellboy!\nPhoenix:\nW-why? What's your reason?\nEdgeworth:\nBecause I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nHowever... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness.\nPhoenix:\nCondition...?\nEdgeworth:\nIf Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of \"guilty\" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition.\nPhoenix:\n(What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared \"guilty\" on the spot! What should I do...?)\n\n\n\nAccept the condition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph.

I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness.\nJudge:\nI see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nRight. On with the cross-examination.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)\nJudge:\nThen I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?\nEdgeworth:\nNone, Your Honor. She's the last.\nPhoenix:\n(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense would like to call the bellboy after all!\nEdgeworth:\n... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!\nPhoenix:\n...?\nEdgeworth:\nMay I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced \"guilty\"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?\nPhoenix:\n(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!\nLeads to:\n\"Very well!

I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally.\nPhoenix:\nAre you always so... so prim?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...Bellboy:\nI believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was Miss May on the phone?\nBellboy:\nAbsolutely, sir.\nPhoenix:\nH-how can you be so certain!?\nBellboy:\nI checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir.\nJudge:\nYes, what then?Bellboy:\nShe asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n9:00 \"on the dot,\" you say?\nBellboy:\nYes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(9:00... the time of the murder!)Bellboy:\nI brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Precisely\" 9:00, then?\nBellboy:\nPrecisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM.\nPhoenix:\nHow can you be so sure!?\nBellboy:\nMiss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. \"Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!\" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Why would she be so particular about the time?)Bellboy:\nAnd I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou are sure it was Miss April May herself?\nBellboy:\nAb-SO-lutely, sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Ab-SO-lutely\"...?\nBellboy:\nYes, sir. As in, \"so very absolutely,\" sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.\nPhoenix:\nHow come you're so very certain!?\nBellboy:\nWell, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an \"embrasser,\" sir.\nPhoenix:\n\"Embrasser\"!? Is that French for \"embrace\"?\nBellboy:\nIt's French for \"kiss,\" sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.\nPhoenix:\nWh-why would she have done that...?\nBellboy:\nI believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)Phoenix:\n(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)After pressing fourth and fifth statements:Phoenix:\n... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here!Judge:\nHmm. It was a bit tedious.

Does the defense have something to add?Phoenix:\nOne last question... let me ask one last question!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!Judge:\nNow, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all.Phoenix:\n(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)Check-in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nT-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May.\nBellboy:\nOh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really.\nPhoenix:\nI see...¬†? Excuse me... what exactly was a \"disappointment\"?\nBellboy:\nWell, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there.\nPhoenix:\n(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?\nBellboy:\nAh! Oh... er... rather, quite!\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Room service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nT-tell me again about er... room service!\nBellboy:\nA-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall.\nPhoenix:\nI see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?\nBellboy:\nY-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?\nBellboy:\nAh! Oh... er... rather, quite!\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Bed making\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day.\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low!\nJudge:\nNow, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question.\nBellboy:\nYes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see.\nPhoenix:\nI see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say?\nBellboy:\nEh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir?\nPhoenix:\nBellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I object! That was... objectionable!\"Edgeworth:\nI object! That was... objectionable!Judge:\n... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.Bellboy:\nEr... yes, I see.Phoenix:\nWhy did you not mention this in your testimony!?Bellboy:\nW-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!Phoenix:\n(Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!Bellboy:\nAh, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...Phoenix:\n!Bellboy:\nHe asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.Edgeworth:\nOof! Y-you fool!Phoenix:\nI've done it... I've won!Phoenix:\nMiss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?Bellboy:\nYes, sir.Phoenix:\nThen, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?Bellboy:\nThat's right, sir.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nYour Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nAnd who, Mr. Wright! Who is this \"other person\"! (Changed from [Who! Who is this 'other person'!] in the original release)Phoenix:\nSimple, it was...Miss April May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNone other than Miss April May!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nEh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder!\nPhoenix:\nOh... right.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor!

He was in the hotel!\nPhoenix:\nWell, s-sure... if you put it that way...\nEdgeworth:\nI do put it that way, and I trust you will too!\nPhoenix:\nBut what if they were in cahoots!\nJudge:\nYou have evidence of this?\nPhoenix:\nUm... no, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!\nLeads back to:\n\"Simple, it was...\"Phoenix:\nThe man who checked in with Miss May!Edgeworth:\nOof!Phoenix:\nYour Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!Edgeworth:\nM-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late...Phoenix:\n\"Too late\"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!Edgeworth:\nOof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!Judge:\nEnough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully!

What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?Phoenix:\nI heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.Maya:\nYes sir!Phoenix:\nI'm going to find out more about this man.Maya:\nDo you think he was the one who...?Phoenix:\nMaybe so.Maya:\nSis...Phoenix:\nDon't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.Maya:\nI'm counting on you!Phoenix:\nI asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that hasn't been stricken from the record. (Changed from [In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.] in the original release)May Testimony added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nI don't know how much good this will do me at all, now.

I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nThat's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial.

Y-yeah! Proof! Show me proof!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm so close!)September 7Gatewater HotelRoom 303Bellboy:\nAh, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself.Phoenix:\nOh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.Bellboy:\nNo, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's \"rep,\" as they say.Phoenix:\nHuh? \"Rep\"?Bellboy:\nYes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir!Phoenix:\nWhoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder.Bellboy:\nI, too, will become famous! \"The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee\"...!Phoenix:\n(Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...)Bellboy:\nSo!

There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer!\nBellboy:\nAh, please leave that as it is, sir. That's the \"Drawer of Terror, Hiding Place of the Murderer's Wiretap.\" It's set to become one of the most popular attractions here.\nPhoenix:\n(This guy's serious! I don't believe it...)\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA bottle and two glasses rest on the table. Why hasn't he cleaned these up by now?\nBellboy:\nAh, I beg your pardon, sir, but if you could please refrain from touching those... It's part of the decor. I call it: \"The last drink... before murder!\" We'll be famous! The talk of the hotel industry!\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNice weather again today. I can see the Fey & Co.

Just $5.00 will earn you three minutes of a \"view to a kill\"!\nPhoenix:\n...\nBellboy:\nJ-just kidding, sir.

Sir, not to boast but I knew the moment I saw her... \"She'd do it!\" I said!\nPhoenix:\n(Do WHAT!? I'm starting to think the most suspicious person here is this guy!)\n\n\n\n\nThe man with May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...?\nBellboy:\nAh, yes... He struck me as a real \"Lady Killer,\" if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger.\nPhoenix:\n(There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.)\nBellboy:\nIf you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him.\nPhoenix:\n(A photo. Hmm...)\n\n\n\n\nThe hotel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about this hotel?\nBellboy:\nAbsolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir!

You know how it is.\nPhoenix:\n(No. No I don't.)\nBellboy:\nWithout a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him!\nPhoenix:\nAn affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...)\n\n\n\nHave him write it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, sure. Why not?\nBellboy:\nYes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as \"The Bellboy who swore the affidavit\"!

What a shock it was to hear what she has done!\nPhoenix:\n\"What she has done\"... You mean the wiretap?\nWhite:\nIndeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods!

The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly.\nWhite:\n... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually...

Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color \"blue\"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course!

You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?Phoenix:\nMr. Grossberg's... yes.White:\nThen you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you?

I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl.\n\n\n\n\nYour refusal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know.\nGrossberg:\nA right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy.\nPhoenix:\n... (He does seem troubled about something... I'm starting to have a feeling I know what it is.)\n\n\n\n\nMr. White\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, I paid Bluecorp a visit.\nGrossberg:\nOh? Oh, I see.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Grossberg... I have to admit, something has been bothering me.\nGrossberg:\nOh? What is it? Well, out with it, my boy!\nPhoenix:\nYou see, it's just...\n\n\n\nThat big painting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.\nGrossberg:\n... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Grossberg, I know you and Mr. White are connected somehow!\nGrossberg:\nC-connected, you say?\nPhoenix:\nYes! And I know what it is...\n\n\n\nHe's giving you information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou're his client, aren't you? He's giving you information!\nGrossberg:\nWhat's that now?\nPhoenix:\nYou've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services!\nGrossberg:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYou gave him that painting in exchange for some valuable information, didn't you?\nGrossberg:\nUtterly ridiculous. Me, his client? I would never willingly deal with that man. Never!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? Did I get it wrong?)\nLeads back to Talk options\n\n\n\n\nHe's blackmailing you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?\nGrossberg:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nI think that painting is fairly gaudy proof.\nGrossberg:\n... Very well. This may be the chance I've been waiting for. Maybe it's time to get this off my chest, so I can finally rest easy again. After all, you were Mia's understudy. Perhaps it was fate?\nPhoenix:\n(What's he talking about...?)\nLeads to:\n\"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\"\n\n\n\n\nYou're lovers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you!\nGrossberg:\nW-w-what! My boy!\nPhoenix:\nYou sent that painting to him! As a sign! A sign of undying love!\nGrossberg:\nM-m-my boy, please! You're letting your fancies run away with you! Where do you get these bizarre ideas?\nPhoenix:\nI... I don't understand how you could...\nGrossberg:\nThat's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! ... Enough. I'll swallow my pride and tell you all.\nPhoenix:\n(I knew it! They are lovers!)\nGrossberg:\nN-no! We are NOT lovers!\nLeads to:\n\"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat photo of Mr. White\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat photo of Mr. White... Why would you have his photo, Mr. Grossberg?\nGrossberg:\nUmm... yes, well. It's been a long time since then...\nPhoenix:\nA long time ago? I'm sorry... but I think not. I think you still have ties to Mr. White even today.\nGrossberg:\nR-really! Whatever gave you that idea! W-what connection could I possibly have to an individual such as he?\nPhoenix:\nIt's pretty straightforward, actually...\n\n\n\nYou go drinking together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou go drinking together! You're friends, aren't you?\nGrossberg:\n... Now you're being foolish, my boy. Why in the world would I ever drink with the likes of him!?\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.)\nLeads back to Talk options\n\n\n\n\nHe's blackmailing you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?\nGrossberg:\n...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had \"no intention of parting with\"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.\nGrossberg:\n... So... you noticed.

It is a large painting...\nPhoenix:\nMr. Grossberg... tell me what happened.\nLeads to:\n\"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\"\n\n\n\n\nHe's giving you information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nRedd White is supplying you with information, obviously!\nGrossberg:\nWhat's that now?\nPhoenix:\nYou've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services!\nGrossberg:\n... Now you're being foolish, my boy. What possible use could I have for the services of the likes of him!?\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.)\nLeads back to Talk options\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy wouldn't you defend Maya?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI thought it was strange. Here was Maya, your own apprentice's little sister, in desperate need... Accused of killing her own sister no less, and you wouldn't take the case! I finally realized why. You and Redd White are connected. He's...\n\n\n\nYour boss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'll bet you and White go way back! He's your boss now, and was before, I bet!\nGrossberg:\nMy what? Boss? Are you serious?\nPhoenix:\nYeah! You both have that sort of \"we're in the same club together\" feel to you.\nGrossberg:\nPlease, stop. You have a very peculiar sense of humor, Mr. Wright. Very well, I'll talk.\nPhoenix:\n(What does he mean... \"sense of humor\"? I was serious!)\nLeads to:\n\"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation.\"\n\n\n\n\nBlackmailing you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. White has something on you doesn't he?

But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you!\nGrossberg:\nW-w-what! My boy!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Grossberg. The other day, there was a giant painting hanging on that wall. I saw that painting again, today. It was in the CEO's office of Bluecorp. It was a present, wasn't it?\nGrossberg:\nWell, my boy, you have a splendid imagination!\nPhoenix:\nI... I don't understand how you could...\nGrossberg:\nThat's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I guess I was wrong. But it just seemed so right!)\nLeads back to Talk optionsPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrossberg:\nSorry, my boy. I don't think I can help you with that.Grossberg:\nRedd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now...Phoenix:\n(15 years...!)Grossberg:\nAll because of the \"DL-6 Incident,\" as you may have guessed.Phoenix:\n(The name on the back of those photographs!)Grossberg:\nAs you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did.Phoenix:\n(So that's the connection!)Grossberg:\nIt is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.Phoenix:\nImpossible? Why!?Grossberg:\nHe has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Grossberg:\nThey are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DL-6 Incident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat is the \"DL-6 Incident\"?\nGrossberg:\n\"DL-6\" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium.\nPhoenix:\n(A medium...?)\nGrossberg:\nHer name was Misty Fey.\nPhoenix:\n(Fey!)\nGrossberg:\nIndeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud.\nPhoenix:\n(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)\nGrossberg:\nI did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident.\n\n\n\n\nReason for blackmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBut why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?\nGrossberg:\nThe DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.\nPhoenix:\nYou told White?\nGrossberg:\nHe offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail.\nPhoenix:\n... I see.\nGrossberg:\n... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office.\nPhoenix:\nMia's office...?\nGrossberg:\nShe followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found.Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Reason for blackmail\" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices)Phoenix:\nIt's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAll the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here. They're in alphabetical order. Let's take a look... Which file should I look at...?\n\n\n\nFile \"A-I\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLet's see if there's \"A\" record in this file that catches my \"I.\" \"A\"... \"B\"... \"F\"! \"Misty Fey.\" That's Mia and Maya's mother. Hmmm... Should I take a look?\n\n\n\nRead it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is...\"\nPhoenix:\nHmm. The record stops there. ... So Mia knew Grossberg...\nLeads back to examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave it be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't think it has much to do with the current case. I'd be interested to know what it contains... but I'll leave it alone for now.\nLeads back to examination\n\n\n\n\n\nFile \"J-S\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLet's see... \"J\" through \"S\"... Nothing much in here. Maybe I'll just skim some of this?\n\n\n\nSkim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* Well, no harm in flipping through a bit, I guess... The biggest part's here at the end in \"S\"... \"Suicide\"? Eww... She has a collection of suicide reports. There's politicians... policemen... ... ...! There's writing on most of these in pencil. \"White\"...? This is Mia's handwriting. Wait, I get it! Mia thought he was involved in these \"suicides\"! White drove them all to... ... I can use these newspaper clippings. Hmm... let's find the most disturbing one...\nNewspaper Clipping added to the Court Record.\nLeads back to examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave it be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNah... this is taking too long.

I'm not sure reading suicide accounts will be very good for my mood... I think that's enough reading for today.\nLeads back to examination\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave 'em\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't see much point in checking files that are missing all the key parts. *yawn* I give up.\nLeads back to examinationGrossberg Law OfficesPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewspaper Clipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI found this in Mia's files...\nGrossberg:\nSo she was investigating Redd White, as I expected. Well, if you wanted to challenge him, you could present this in court.\nPhoenix:\n(Not a bad idea...)Bluecorp (after Newspaper Clipping is added to the Court Record)White:\nWell, aren't you persistent.Phoenix:\nSorry, but there's something I have to ask you.White:\nMr. Lawyer, I really hate having to repeat myself... But it seems the message has not yet penetrated your thick skull... Stop bothering me! If you try my patience further, I fear a nasty accident may occur. Do I make myself clear?Phoenix:\n(Transparent...)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiss May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think we're past needing to talk about April May.

I need some evidence I can use as ammo...)\nWhite:\nWhat's wrong? Is something stuck to my face? Why yes! There's my eyes, and my nose, and my mouth... But of course I jest. You need not restrain your mirth, my friend! It is okay to indulge in my cosmopolitan sense of humor.

The very next day he took his own life.\nWhite:\nAnd this concerns me how...?\nPhoenix:\nI found this article in Mia's office.\nWhite:\nMiss Mia...?\nPhoenix:\nShe had a file filled with articles like this. Every one of them was labeled with a single word... \"White.\"\nWhite:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nMr. White, I know what you did to this politician.\n\n\n\nYou bribed him\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou bribed him!\nWhite:\nB-bribed!? ...

You certainly have an active imagination.\nPhoenix:\n(Dammit!)\nLeads back to Court Record\n\n\n\n\nYou spied on him\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were spying on him, weren't you?\nWhite:\n\"Spying\"...?\nPhoenix:\nYou snooped on him, and found out about the embezzlement. Then, when you revealed it, he was driven to suicide!\nWhite:\nMr. Lawyer. I know nothing of this. And, even in the highly unlikely event that I did do such a thing... All I would have done is provide \"information.\" That is not a crime in this country.\nPhoenix:\n(Gah!

Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court.\nJudge:\nExcellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Great. He gets to show off and I get nowhere.)\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!\"Let it go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Forget it. I smell a trap.)\nLeads to:\n\"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!\"Edgeworth:\nI would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!Edgeworth:\nPlease state your full name.White:\nYou wish to know the title of my personage?Edgeworth:\nEr... your name?White:\nYes! That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?Edgeworth:\nName!Phoenix:\n(These two are great together...)White:\nMy name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp.Edgeworth:\nDid you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?White:\nThat would be a negatory! No, I did not.Edgeworth:\n... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?White:\nCorrect.Edgeworth:\nAnd you witnessed the murder from there?White:\nAhem. Why tell you what you already know?Judge:\nVery well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)White:\nHo hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:\n...!Maya:\nLet him have it, Phoenix!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --White:\nLet's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.\nI was quietly perusifying... er, that's \"reading\" to you, some papers by the window.\nThen I heard a bedlam coming from outside!\nSurprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.\nIt was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!\nNeedless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!\nI called Miss May over at once. She, too, was flabbergasted of course.\nThe victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!\nFinally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Judge:\nHmm... If things occurred as you testify, then I'm afraid the defendant is guilty. Very well, defendant... er, I mean, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination...Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --White:\nLet's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow do you know what time it was?\nWhite:\nBecause I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect, you know?\nPhoenix:\nNo no no, you're not getting away with that!\nWhite:\nYou are so mistrusting, Mr. Lawyer! So... what was the proper term for \"secretary\" again...? Anyway, Miss May ordered room service for 9:00. It happened soon after the room service arrived.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. That's what Miss May said, too.)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nTrue, the bellboy who brought the coffee saw Miss May. But he testified that he did not see you at the time!\nWhite:\nAhem. This is your concern? Silly Lawyer! Miss May received the coffee outside the room! Of course he could not see me. He would need X-ray vision to pull off something like that!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nEdgeworth:\nTell us, what were you doing at the time?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I don't see anything to gain by attacking him on this point any further.) Okay, what were you doing at the time?\nLeads back to cross-examinationWhite:\nI was quietly perusifying... er, that's \"reading\" to you, some papers by the window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy window, you mean the one directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Office?\nWhite:\nCorrect! That is the only window, you see.\nPhoenix:\nAnd there you were reading... papers?\nWhite:\nCorrect! The Gatewater is a businessman's hotel, and I am a busy man who had business to do!White:\nThen I heard a bedlam coming from outside!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA \"bedlam\"?\nWhite:\nIt must have been when you attacked, I assume.\nEdgeworth:\nWe see. Continue.White:\nSurprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were reading your papers until you heard that sound?\nWhite:\nBut of course. I am no snoop, peeping out of windows at night.\nPhoenix:\n(No snoop? Yeah, right! You've made a career out of snooping!)White:\nIt was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nS-spiky-haired!?White:\nNeedless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat you just said directly conflicts with Miss May's testimony! Miss May clearly stated that the assailant looked like a \"girl\"!\nWhite:\nI've always been proud of my eyesight, Mr. Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nJust what is your eyesight?\nWhite:\nCounting both eyes... 40!\nPhoenix:\n40!? Don't add them together!\nJudge:\nI think the witness is trying to say his eyesight is good.\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what did you do then?White:\nI called Miss May over at once. She, too, was surprised of course.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Miss May doing at that time?\nWhite:\nShe had just finished watching a soap opera on the TV, and was weeping openly.\nPhoenix:\nDid you know she had been tapping the Fey office phone?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIrrelevant! That has nothing to do with the case at hand.\nWhite:\nI care not. I will answer the lawyer's bold inquiry. Miss May was acting alone when she tapped the phone of this Fey woman.\nPhoenix:\nYou'd make a good politician, Mr. White.\nWhite:\nHo hoh! After all, I am \"El Presidente.\"\nJudge:\nPlease continue.White:\nThe victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan you be a little more detailed about that? I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened.\nWhite:\nOf course! Comprende! I understand! The victim was attacked, by you, and ran to the left. You gave chase, and struck her down!\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure?\nWhite:\nAs you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect!\nJudge:\nPerhaps you could change your testimony to reflect this new detail.\nChanges statement from \"The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!\" to \"The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!\"White:\nThe victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nWhite:\nHow many times must I say it? I am abso-posi-lutely perfect! End of story!\nPhoenix:\n(How many times must I hear that?)\nMaya:\nPsst! Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as a little odd?Present May Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait right there!\"White:\nFinally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... \"impaction\"? Don't you mean just \"impact\"?\nWhite:\nRidiculosity! I think you need to brush up on your language skills!\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, perhaps I'd better leave the whole language thing alone...)Phoenix:\n(Did Edgeworth \"prep\" this guy, too, I wonder? Anyway, I'd better find a weakness in there...)Phoenix:\nWait right there! Mr. White, you've dug your own grave!White:\nWhat is this!?Phoenix:\nYou said the victim ran to the \"left.\" But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran \"right\"!White:\n...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.Phoenix:\nI think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?White:\n! Very strange... I did see her run to the left... I did.Maya:\nPhoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.Phoenix:\nTrue. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)Judge:\nMr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nMiss May says \"right,\" and Mr. White says \"left.\" Can you explain this contradiction to the court?Mr. White is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs Mr. White testified, Mia ran to the left.\nJudge:\nBut... But if that's the case... Why would she run in the opposite direction from the door?\nPhoenix:\nShe did not. She was running towards the door, Your Honor.\nEdgeworth:\nBwah! Now you're the one making a contradiction, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nNot at all.\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Miss May is right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs Miss May has stated, Mia ran to the right after she was attacked.\nWhite:\nWhat is this? I am not fashioning fabrications, I assure you! That lady ran to the left! I am sure of it!\nPhoenix:\nThen there can be only one explanation.\nEdgeworth:\nEh...? And that is?\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Both are right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBoth witnesses are telling the truth. (For once...)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! I doubt it! Er, rather, that does not clear up the contradiction!\nPhoenix:\nThere is one scenario that would explain their conflicting accounts.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!\"Phoenix:\nObviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!Judge:\nMr. Wright! What do you mean?Edgeworth:\nYes, what do you mean, he was not \"viewing the crime from the hotel\"!? If he was not in the hotel, where could he have been!?Phoenix:\nIn the law offices of Fey & Co., of course! More specifically, he was standing here! (Time to show the court where Mr. White was standing!) (Changed from [Show the court where Mr. White was standing!] in the original release)Present killer's location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is where he was!\"Present victim's location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's where he was!\nEdgeworth:\nM-Mr. Wright! We are not fools! How could he have been exactly where the victim was standing!?\nPhoenix:\n(Oh... oh, right!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Your Honor! Sorry! Let me try that again...\nLeads back to:\n\"Time to the court where Mr. White was standing!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's where he was!\nJudge:\nHold it right there, Mr. Wright!

There is no evidence, no proof to the contrary! None!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry! Er... let me try that again!\nLeads back to:\n\"Time to show the court where Mr. White was standing!\"Phoenix:\nThis is where he was! Look! When the victim ran for the door... If he was watching from this point, to him it would appear that she ran to the \"left.\"Edgeworth:\nPlease! This is no time for jokes in ill taste!

What are you suggesting!?White:\nR-r-rapscallion!!!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThe postulations of the defense are a distortion of the truth, Your Honor!Judge:\nIndeed. They do seem a bit far-fetched...White:\n... Ho hoh hoh! You provide us with so much entertainment, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:\n(What now!? He's... laughing!?)White:\nThe hilarity of the moment made me remember something... It appears I have been unclear, and for this, I apologize. Mr. Your Honor... Might I be allowed to testify once more?Judge:\nVery well, let's hear your revised testimony.Phoenix:\n(Good luck. You can't fix a broken testimony, buddy!)Witness Testimony-- She Ran to the \"Left\" --White:\nMiss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!\nWhen you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left.\nAnd then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw.\nNext, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.\nYou chased her, and delivered the final blow.\nThat is what Miss May saw.\nYou see? You hit her twice!\nDon't you remember, Mr. Lawyer?Judge:\nHmm... That does seem to make sense. Will you be cross-examining the witness's testimony?Phoenix:\nYou bet I will! I mean, yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- She Ran to the \"Left\" --White:\nMiss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by that!\nWhite:\nThat is what I am about to explain! You Americans, always so impatient! It does not become you.\nPhoenix:\n(Hey buddy, you're an American, too!)White:\nWhen you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean \"first\"?\nWhite:\n\"First\"? That is what comes before what happens \"next.\" You do speak English, right? Please, sit back, relax. I will try to use simple words for your benefit. First, she ran to the left, and then...White:\nAnd then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI didn't hit anyone!\nWhite:\nNow, now, Mr. Wright. There is no point hiding things from this court.\nPhoenix:\nI'm not hiding anything!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution requests that the defense refrain from interrupting the testimony!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, you have been warned.\nPhoenix:\n(Why's he mad at me!?)White:\nNext, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean \"next\"!?\nWhite:\n\"Next\" is what comes after \"first.\"\nPhoenix:\nI know that!\nWhite:\nThen that is all you need to know, Mr. Lawyer. As I said, she turned and made a desperate dash to the right.Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. White!\"White:\nYou chased her, and delivered the final blow.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStop saying it was me!\nWhite:\nBut, it was you.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright!

Doesn't something about that strike you as odd?\n\n\n\nYeah, very odd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, that is odd. I'll press further.) Mr. White.\nWhite:\nHuh?

(But it won't be easy!)Phoenix:\nLook at this!Judge:\nThese are the floor plans to the scene of the murder, yes?Phoenix:\nCorrect, Your Honor. Now, look... If you were to look through the window at the office... This is the area you would be able to see! Here! Well...? Note that the stand is not within the visible area! Well, Mr. White! What do you have to say to that!?White:\nEr... erp! Ri... dicu... losity...Phoenix:\nMr. White. If you were in the Gatewater hotel as you claim, you could not have seen the stand before it fell over! In fact, you wouldn't have been able to see it after it fell, either! There's no way you could have recognized the broken shards as a glass light stand! So, when did you see the stand, Mr. White? It must have been the moment that it fell! And the only place you could have seen that from... is inside the Fey Law Offices! In other words, you were at the scene of the crime, when the murder took place!White:\nGaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!Judge:\nMr...

I forgot about Edgeworth!)Edgeworth:\nMr. White...White:\n...Edgeworth:\nI think the time has come. Shouldn't you confess your crime now, hmm?White:\nW... what?Edgeworth:\nI said, you should confess your crime. Ergo, confess that you placed the wiretap!Phoenix:\nThe w-wiretap!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! Explain to the court what you mean by this!Edgeworth:\nDistinguished members of of the court... Mr. White is slightly confused. Allow me to explain.Phoenix:\n(I really don't like the way this is headed...)Edgeworth:\nAs you know, Mr. White is the CEO of Bluecorp. He ordered his secretary, Miss April May, to tap the law offices of Ms. Fey.Judge:\nWhat does that have to do...?Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. The question is: when was the wiretap placed in the office, and by who?Phoenix:\nNo! You wouldn't!Edgeworth:\nMr. White. In order to place the wiretap, you entered Ms. Fey's office. Am I correct...?White:\n...¬†! C-correct! You are most correct, Miles!Phoenix:\nGive me a break!White:\nYes... in order to place the wiretap, I breached the Fey & Co. Law Offices! That is when I saw that accursed light stand!Judge:\nNow I'm confused. Please explain to the court what all this means, Mr. Edgeworth!Edgeworth:\nGladly, Your Honor. Mr. Phoenix Wright has made his position quite clear. He has determined that Mr. White knew the glass stand was in the office. He has shown that there was only one time Mr. White could have seen the stand: at the very moment of the murder! ([at] was capitalized in the original release) Thus, Mr. Wright would like you to believe that Mr. White was the murderer!Judge:\nI see.Edgeworth:\nHowever! It is a fact that Mr. White had been to that office well before the murder took place! When he went to place the wiretap! (Changed from [He went to place the wiretap!] in the original release) He could have seen the glass light stand then. Ergo, Mr. Phoenix Wright's theory is revealed for the baseless conjecture it is!Judge:\nMr. White! You will testify to the court about this wiretapping! (Changed from [You will testify to the court about this wiretap!] in the original release)White:\nAhem. Leave it to me!Phoenix:\n(I... I feel faint.)Witness Testimony-- The Wiretapping --White:\nIt was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.\nI had entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices.\nOf course, I had done so to place the wiretap.\nThat is when I saw this glass light stand.Judge:\nHmm... So, you saw the stand before the night of the incident... And this is how you were able to identify what had fallen over. By the sound?White:\nCorrect! That is right.Judge:\nI see. Very well, Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine.Phoenix:\n(Gah! What am I supposed to do now...!?)Maya:\nGood luck, Phoenix...Cross Examination-- The Wiretapping --White:\nIt was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nD-do you have proof!?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nMiss April May knew the details of Ms. Fey's phone conversation!

Law Offices.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas it really you that went into the office? Or was it Miss May?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nUnidentified fingerprints several days old were found in the Fey & Co. Law Offices. Those were obviously Mr. White's.\nPhoenix:\n(And if I know Edgeworth, he's already run a check on those prints...)\nEdgeworth:\nNow, Mr. White. Tell us why you went to the Fey & Co. Law Offices.White:\nOf course, I had done so to place the wiretap.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you tap Mia's phone!?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat has no bearing on the current case, Your Honor.\nWhite:\nBluecorp is a detective agency of sorts. We have a responsibility to protect client confidentiality!White:\nThat is when I saw this glass light stand.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you notice something as innocuous as a light stand!?\nWhite:\nThe light stand was made entirely out of glass. It was quite stylish, so I guess it made a lasting impression on me. Such a beautacious thing deserves attention, does it not? That is all.Phoenix:\n(Dammit! There's nothing there for me to press him on! Oh well... maybe he's rattled enough that I can bluff something out of him!)After pressing first, second, and fourth statements, then pressing third statement:Phoenix:\n(Uh oh! Don't tell me I've run out of ammo!)Edgeworth:\nTsk tsk. I'm afraid that's as far as you go, Mr. Wright. The time has come for you to admit your defeat! You fought... honorably.Phoenix:\n(No more... I can't take this anymore...)Judge:\nMr. Wright? Are you giving up?Phoenix:\n... Y-yes, Your Honor.???:(Phoenix!)Phoenix:\n...????:(Phoenix! Over here!)Phoenix:\n(I know that voice! ...

Phoenix, I want you to look at me.Phoenix:\nY-You're... M-Maya...?Mia:\nDidn't you know the Fey women have strong psychic powers...? When you accepted your defeat in court... It appears that was enough of a shock to awaken Maya's true powers.Phoenix:\nSo... Maya is channeling you, Mia?Mia:\nThat's right. I am Maya, but I'm also Mia. Now, I want you to listen to me, Phoenix. Maya never gave up. You can't either! That's what I came here to tell you.Phoenix:\n...! B-but!Mia:\nWe don't have much time, Phoenix. Now listen. You've already won.Phoenix:\nHuh...?Mia:\nYou have that Receipt in the court record, right?Phoenix:\nUm... oh, yeah! The one you wrote \"Maya\" on...?Mia:\nPhoenix! White wrote that, not me!Phoenix:\nSo... so what do I do with it?Mia:\nLook at the front of the receipt!Phoenix:\nThe... front? (It's a regular receipt...

I think the court is about to reconvene! Go do it, Phoenix! You know you're innocent, now you just have to prove it!Phoenix:\nRight!Receipt updated in the Court Record.September 9, 1:16 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:\nThe court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.

There is nothing to go back to! The cross-examination of Mr. White is finished! All that is required now is for you to pass judgment on the defendant Phoenix Wright!Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\nYour Honor! Please, give me one more chance. I promise you, this is the last time I'll ask you!Judge:\nHmm... But, as Mr. Edgeworth has noted, the trial is more or less finished. Mr. Edgeworth, do you have an opinion on this matter?Edgeworth:\nI say... let us give Mr. Phoenix Wright his \"last chance.\"Judge:\nVery well!

I'm not really sure, ayup.Judge:\nWhat do you mean?Uncle:\nMy, er, memory...Karma:\nYour Honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name.Judge:\nHmm... he can't recall, you say?Karma:\nYes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify.Judge:\nVery well. Let's hear his testimony then, shall we.

I'd like to begin the cross-examination...Karma:Karma:\nThere is nothing to question in my witness's testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now!Judge:\nEr... yes... M-Mr. Wright...?Cross-examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you saying!? Of course I'll cross-examine the witness!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well, you may begin.\nLeads to:\n\"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\"Don't cross-examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He's right. That testimony sounded pretty solid. Maybe I should hold back.)\nMaya:\nB-but, Nick! You have to cross-examine him! This is your only chance to turn this trial around!

Right outside the window of my little shack.\nPhoenix:\nAnd, could you see the man's face?\nUncle:\nWell, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me.

Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth's right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...?\nPhoenix:\nExactly!\nKarma:\nThat is easily explainable!

There's something I've been meaning to ask you.Edgeworth:\nWhat's that?Maya:\nWhy are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?Edgeworth:\nOh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking.

I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking!Judge:\nR-right, of course.Karma:\nA prediction! Today's trial will end three minutes from now!Judge:\nOrder... order! Mr. von Karma! What is the meaning of your statement just now!?Karma:Karma:\nBah! Must you question everything! It will be over in three minutes! We have no time to waste! I'll call my witness now!Judge:\nR-right...Karma:\nI call my witness... my decisive witness to the stand!Phoenix:\n(It's that mysterious boat shop owner.)Karma:\nWitness... state your profession.Uncle:\nMmph... zzzz... ... I, er, am the proprietor of the restaurant the \"Wet Noodle\" at Gourd Lake.Karma:\n...Uncle:\nAnd I, er, also rent boats.Karma:\nThe night of the incident, you were in the boat rental shop, correct?Uncle:\nEr... ayup, yup I was.Karma:\nPlease testify.Phoenix:\n(Wait a second... We still haven't heard who this old guy is!)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a minute!\"Let it slide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I guess it doesn't really matter.)\nMaya:\nDoesn't matter!? What are you thinking, Nick!? What if that old man had something to do with the DL-6 Incident? If we don't find out who he is, we won't be able to build a case here!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, she has a point.)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a minute!\"Phoenix:\nWait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!Karma:Karma:\nBecause I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate!Phoenix:\n(Yeah, right!)Judge:\nThe witness will state his name.Uncle:\nZzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I'm not really sure, ayup.Judge:\nWhat do you mean?Uncle:\nMy, er, memory...Karma:\nYour Honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name.Judge:\nHmm... he can't recall, you say?Karma:\nYes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify.Judge:\nVery well. Let's hear his testimony then, shall we. Witness?Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:\nIt was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.\nI was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.\nThen I heard a \"bang!\" Ayup.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.\nThen I heard another \"bang.\"\nJust about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Judge:\nHmm...Very well. I'd like to begin the cross-examination...Karma:Karma:\nThere is nothing to question in my witness's testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now!Judge:\nEr... yes... M-Mr. Wright...?Cross-examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you saying!? Of course I'll cross-examine the witness!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well, you may begin.\nLeads to:\n\"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\"Don't cross-examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He's right. That testimony sounded pretty solid. Maybe I should hold back.)\nMaya:\nB-but, Nick! You have to cross-examine him! This is your only chance to turn this trial around! Your last chance!\nPhoenix:\n(O-oh... right.)\nLeads to:\n\"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\"Karma:\nRaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nE-excuse me? Mr. von Karma?Karma:\nThree minutes just passed.Judge:\nI see. Well then, let's just take our time. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:\nIt was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Just after midnight,\" you say?\nUncle:\nAyup, just around then.\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure?\nUncle:\nPretty sure, ayup.\nPhoenix:\nWhen I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I'm surprised you seem so sure about it today.\nUncle:\n...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nI asked him, and he remembered. Isn't that right!?\nUncle:\nZzzz... D-don't glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup.\nKarma:\nYou see? Continue!Uncle:\nI was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs there anyone who can verify that?\nUncle:\n... Well, I guess Polly could.\nPhoenix:\nTh-that's not good enough for a court of law!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... exactly what's not good enough?\nPhoenix:\nAh, uh, Your Honor, this \"Polly\" is a parrot.\nJudge:\nA... parrot?\nUncle:\nDon't be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy!\nJudge:\nKeith...?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop. Witness... please continue.Uncle:\nThen I heard a \"bang!\" Ayup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd where did the \"bang\" seem to come from?\nUncle:\nFrom the lake, I figure.\nKarma:\nAre you certain?\nUncle:\nA-ayup.\nKarma:\nGood. Continue!Uncle:\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas there someone in the boat?\nUncle:\nIt was pretty far out there... I couldn't see clearly... But I figure there was two men out there, ayup.\nPhoenix:\nBut you couldn't see them clearly!\nUncle:\nAyup... at the time, that is.\nPhoenix:\n(At the time...?)Uncle:\nThen I heard another \"bang.\"Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you heard two gunshots total?\nUncle:\nAyup.\nPhoenix:\n(That's what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)Uncle:\nJust about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"By your window\"?\nUncle:\nAyup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack.\nPhoenix:\nAnd, could you see the man's face?\nUncle:\nWell, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me. I saw him.\nJudge:\nThis is rather important detail! Please add it to your testimony.\nUncle:\n...\nKarma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(I have a bad feeling about this...)\nAdds statement \"That man was the defendant... he was saying \"I can't believe he's dead.\"Uncle:\nThat man was the defendant... he was saying \"I can't believe he's dead.\"Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"A-are you sure!?\"Phoenix:\n(If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I'm not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it's tough being a lawyer.)Phoenix:\nA-are you sure!?Uncle:\n...Phoenix:\n(Uh oh!) D-Dad!Uncle:\nDead certain, Keith! He said \"I can't believe he's dead\" as he was walking by, too.Karma:\nWitness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?Uncle:\nIt was him! That Edgeworth boy!Judge:\n... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.Phoenix:\n(von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)Karma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk...Maya:\nN-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!Phoenix:\n(I'd better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! We proved in yesterday's court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun!\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth's right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...?\nPhoenix:\nExactly!\nKarma:\nThat is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness's testimony is true!\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm...\"Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?)\nKarma:\nJudge! There is no room for doubt in the witness's testimony! I demand that you declare your verdict!\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm...\"Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(The judge is lost in thought... what should I do?)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! This witness claims that Edgeworth said \"I can' t believe he's dead\"... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright. In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof!\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nMaya:\nNick! Do we have evidence...?\nLeads to:\n\"It's no good! There's nothing I can do.\"Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I can't see any room to raise an objection... I'd better hold back and see how things develop.)\nMaya:\nNick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth'll be found guilty for sure!\nLeads to:\n\"It's no good! There's nothing I can do.\"Phoenix:\nIt's no good! There's nothing I can do.Maya:\nA... are you sure?Phoenix:\nTo be honest... I don't know what to do anymore.Maya:\nPlease... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record.Judge:\nEnough! The witness may leave the stand.Uncle:\nZzzz...Judge:\nThis court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.Phoenix:\n(W-what!? No!)Karma:\nHmph.Judge:\nThis court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...GuiltyJudge:\nThe accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!W-w-waaaaaaait!Judge:\nWh-who was that just now?Me!!!Phoenix:\nHuh? Waaaaah! L-Larry!Judge:\nWh-what are you doing here!?Butz:\nListen! Y-you gotta listen to me! I... I was...  I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn't sure about it until just yesterday. B-but today I remembered it!Judge:\nRemembered what?Butz:\nThe gunshot! I heard it too!Judge:\nO-order!Karma:Karma:\nWhat is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!Judge:\nOne moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?Butz:\nYeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can't just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It's... It's just not right! I'll testify! Lemme testify!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I'm not quite sure how to proceed...Karma:\nJudge! You've already given your decision! The trial is over!Maya:\nNick! This is it! Larry's given us one final chance at this!Phoenix:\n(She's right! If only it wasn't Larry... He could make things even worse...)Maya:\nMr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn't get any worse!Phoenix:\nYou're right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!Karma:\nA waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned!Judge:\nHmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard!Karma:\nWh-what is this!?Judge:\nI withdraw my previous verdict of \"guilty\"! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now!Karma:\nWhaaaat!Judge:\nThe court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned!December 27, 10:28 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:\nWhew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHmph. I've seen worse.Phoenix:\n(Yeah right, Edgeworth. You're sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there.Maya:\nLarry was at the lake that night?Phoenix:\nYes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.Maya:\nOh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?Phoenix:\nYeah.Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nHey, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n... Huh? You say something, Wright?Phoenix:\nYeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What's wrong?Edgeworth:\nIt... it's nothing.Phoenix:\nHmm?Maya:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth? There's something I've been meaning to ask you.Edgeworth:\nWhat's that?Maya:\nWhy are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?Edgeworth:\nOh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn't have a reason, really.Maya:\nI see...Edgeworth:\nWright...Phoenix:\nYeah?Edgeworth:\nThis might be our chance.Phoenix:\nOur chance?Edgeworth:\nvon Karma has only ever run perfect trials.Phoenix:\nPerfect trials...?Edgeworth:\nPerfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That's the secret to his success. This is the first time he's ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has to let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court! (Changed from [He has let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court!] in the original release) And that someone... is Larry!Phoenix:\nWhat are you getting at?Edgeworth:\nIt's likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright.Maya:\nThat's right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We'll milk this one for all it's worth!Phoenix:\nHey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything's on Larry now...) (Changed from [Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)] in the original release)December 27, 10:35 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th.Butz:\nRight... leave it to me!Phoenix:\n(Please, Larry, don't mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you're our last chance!)Karma:\n...Phoenix:\n(von Karma didn't even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...)Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:\nThat night, I was out in a boat on the lake.\nI was looking for something and I, er, found it.\nSo I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.\nThen, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this \"bang\"!\nI looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.\nSo after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Judge:\nHmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor...Maya:\nWhat's wrong, Nick?Phoenix:\nIt's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him. I'm a little scared.Maya:\nHmm... Well, we've come this far. There's no way to go but forward, Nick!Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:\nThat night, I was out in a boat on the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nSomething wrong, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThere were so many things wrong I don't know where to begin...\nJudge:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, okay. First of all, what time was it?\nButz:\nOh, it was after 11:00 when I went out in the boat. By that time everyone had gone home for the night. So I waited until the coast was clear, so to speak.\nPhoenix:\nAnd why were you out on a boat at such a late hour...?Butz:\nI was looking for something and I, er, found it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Looking for something\"...?\nButz:\nEr, yeah.\nJudge:\nMr. Butz, what was it you were looking for?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nWhat the witness was searching for is irrelevant! Most likely he was hunting for this \"Gourdy\"!\nPhoenix:\n(You know, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was the truth.)\nKarma:\nThis is all irrelevant! Let's get it over with.Butz:\nSo I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAround what time was that?\nButz:\nUh... Well, let's see... I figured I was out searching for about an hour... I guess it was around 12:00. Yeah.\nJudge:\nYou're not sure?\nButz:\nHey! Don't give me that face! I'm not some sort of human sundial, okay!?\nPhoenix:\n(People use watches these days, Larry...)Butz:\nThen, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this \"bang\"!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhere did the sound come from?\nButz:\nYeah, well, I wasn't too sure about that. I looked around, y'know.\nJudge:\nDid you look at the lake?\nButz:\nYeah, I looked.Butz:\nI looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWasn't there a boat on the lake!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Well? Mr. Butz!\nButz:\nWhoa, whoa. Everybody just calm down, okay? I mean, it was real foggy that night. I'm not sure whether there was a boat out there or not.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, okay, no problem. That's just the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the case!!!)\nKarma:\nHmph!Butz:\nSo after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you only heard one \"bang\" correct?\nButz:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh.)Present Lotta's Deposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"W-wait a sec, Larry!\"Maya:\nWell, Nick?Phoenix:\nHmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn't it? I guess I should just start working on the contradictions.Maya:\nSorry...\nI wish I could be more helpful. I wish I could call my sister...Phoenix:\nW-wait a sec, Larry!Butz:\nWh-what!?Phoenix:\nYou only heard one \"bang\"!? You're sure!?Butz:\nThat's what I said!Phoenix:\nBut Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two \"bang\"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!Butz:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nWere you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said?Butz:\nYo, Nick, please!Phoenix:\nHuh?Butz:\nYou know, something's been bothering me. I'm a witness, see? I'm like a customer here! So you got to treat me nice and stuff, okay!?Phoenix:\n...Judge:\nMr. Butz.Butz:\nWhat!?Judge:\nYou only heard one gunshot? Are you sure?Butz:\n... Umm... Well, to tell ya the truth... I'm not sure.Judge:\nEh...?Phoenix:\nNot sure!? H-how could you not be sure?Butz:\nYeah, well... I, uh, I might have missed the other gunshot. I was, uh, listening to something else...Phoenix:\nSomething... else?Butz:\nMy radio, dude! With my headphones. (Changed from [My radio, dude! On my headphones.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nWhaaaaaaat!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! And stop that booing! M-Mr. Butz! You were listening to the radio with your headphones? (Changed from [You were listening to a radio on earphones?] in the original release)Butz:\nY-yeah! So what! That a crime!? I listen to my radio! Everybody listens to the radio! What's the big deal!?Judge:\nHmm... Mr. von Karma... your opinion?Karma:\nWaste of time. I do not accept this witness, nor his shoddy testimony.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Should he continue the testimony?That's enough\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I think I've heard enough. This is all too embarrassing... In fact, I think we've all heard enough.)\nMaya:\nWhat are you saying, Nick!? If you stop now, Mr. Edgeworth will be found guilty! We have to turn this trial around now!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor.\"Continue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor.\"Phoenix:\nYour Honor. Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony.Karma:\nBah! Nothing is more pitiful than a lawyer who doesn't know when he's lost!Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Butz. Please give your testimony, and be sure to include details like your RADIO.Butz:\nRight! Leave it to me!Phoenix:\n(I wouldn't if there were any other way out of this, believe me.)Witness Testimony-- What Larry Heard --Butz:\nIt's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!\nThat's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?\nI was listening to it real booming loud, like.\nBut I'm sure I heard that gunshot!\nI remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.Judge:\nYou were listening to your radio... at a high volume!?Butz:\nYeah, what's the big problem? Can't a man listen to his radio in peace? Isn't this a free country!?Phoenix:\n(I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem here is.)Karma:\nJudge. Can you believe a word this witness says? What he heard was probably nothing more than a drum beat from the radio!Judge:\nTrue enough, it is difficult to believe this testimony.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nWait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot!Judge:\nExcuse me? \"Dee-jay\"...?Phoenix:\nAn announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake! I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor!Judge:\nV-very well, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(I can't believe I'm continuing this charade...)Cross Examination",

You mean...?Phoenix:\nNo, I heard it's his successor this time...Maya:\nSuccessor...? ... Manfred von Karma... was a really sinister man. (Changed from [Manfred von Karma. He was a really sinister man.] in the original release) He pulled all sorts of nasty tricks; all so he could win.Phoenix:\n(He was a man obsessed with the word \"perfection\"... He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor... I wonder what kind of person they will turn out to be...)Maya:\nIt's no good...Mystic Maya!!Maya:\nPearly! You showed up! Thanks for coming all this way!Pearl:\nI was really worried about you...Maya:\nHey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together?Pearl:\nMother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks.Maya:\nHuh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself?Pearl:\nYup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map.Phoenix:\nDon't tell me you walked all the way here...Pearl:\nOf course not! ...I ran!Phoenix:\nThat's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...)Maya:\nPearly... What about the train?Pearl:\nHuh? What's a... \"tray-in\"?Phoenix:\n(I give up...)Pearl:\n...It's time, isn't it?Maya:\nUm... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma!Pearl:\nMr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that?Maya:\nUm, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend.Edgeworth:Maya:\nI still remember him as though I'd seen him only yesterday. (Changed from [I still remember him as if I had just seen him only yesterday.] in the original release)Phoenix:Maya:\nEvery trial was a scorchingly fierce battle until the very end. (Changed from [Every trial was a scorching fierce battle until the very end.] in the original release)Edgeworth:Phoenix:Maya:\nIt was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life...Phoenix:\nMaya! Please don't mention that name ever again...Maya:\nHuh...? But why, Nick?Phoenix:\nI'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back...Maya:\nWhaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!?Bailiff:\nCourt will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom.Phoenix:\n... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway.Maya:\nN...Nick...?June 21, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared????:\n...Phoenix:\n... (What is with this kid...?) (Changed from [... (What is with this girl...?)] in the original release)Judge:\n... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you prepared!? (Changed from [*Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nHuh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?)???:\nMr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:\n...!???:\nYou must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct?Phoenix:\n(...Hold on. So SHE'S the famed \"successor\" to Prosecutor von Karma...?) (Changed from [...Hold on. So this kid is the \"famed\" Prosecutor von Karma...?] in the original release)von Karma:\nI am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy.Phoenix:\nI... see...von Karma:\nI gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge.Phoenix:\nRevenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?)Judge:\nUm... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww!von Karma:\nI'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me.Phoenix:\n(Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!!von Karma:\nMake no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Judge:\nProsecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please...von Karma:\nThose of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is \"perfection\". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch.Judge:\nV-Very well... What is the defense's position?Phoenix:\nYour Honor.Judge:\nDoes the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"?Phoenix:\n...Yes.von Karma:\nFoolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time.Phoenix:\n(\"Justified self-defense\"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of themself. (Changed from [A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself.] in the original release) We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of \"not guilty\", Your Honor! (Because to plead \"justified self-defense\" is to say you did kill someone.)von Karma:\nHow foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness.Phoenix:\n(She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.)von Karma:\nWitness, your name and occupation?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!!von Karma:\nGet to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room.Judge:\nWhat were they doing in there?Gumshoe:\nUm... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir.Judge:\nCh-Channeling a spirit??Phoenix:\n(That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release)Gumshoe:\n*ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room.Judge:\nAh, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over.Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Judge:\nSo, how was the victim killed?Gumshoe:\nI was about to get to that...von Karma:\nStop wasting my time, then.Witness Testimony-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Judge:\nHmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot...Gumshoe:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report, sir.Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThe court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.Cross Examination-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim? Now, why would he have...\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\n\"Why would he have a pistol?\" Who cares? The point that you are missing is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start.\nJudge:\nFingerprints? There were fingerprints?\nGumshoe:\nAlong with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir.\nJudge:\nHmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...! I walked right into her hands there.) (Changed from [Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPoint blank, huh? So about how far away was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away.\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know he was shot at point blank?\nvon Karma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me!?\nvon Karma:\nGunpowder burn.\nPhoenix:\n...Gunpowder burn?\nvon Karma:\nWhen something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\nGumshoe:\nGunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...)Gumshoe:\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStabbed... And what was he stabbed with?\nGumshoe:\nA fruit knife.\nJudge:\nI see. And whose knife was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it.\nJudge:\nHmm... All over it, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. This does not look good...)\nvon Karma:\nHa ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Gumshoe:\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow severe was the wound?\nGumshoe:\nIf it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand.\nPhoenix:\n(This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...)Gumshoe:\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure he was stabbed first, then shot?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal.\nvon Karma:\nA fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... What a pain...)Phoenix:\n(Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...)After pressing first, second, third and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered.Gumshoe:\nI brought the two murder weapons with me today.Judge:\nVery well. The court accepts them into evidence.Pistol added to the Court Record.Knife added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThe date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time.Judge:\nAnd two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them, huh... (Changed from [And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...?] in the original release) Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case.von Karma:\nNaturally!Phoenix:\n(This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...)von Karma:\nYour Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there?Judge:\nThat is quite true... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Judge:\nEven in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead \"not guilty\"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose.von Karma:\nSee, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes...Judge:\nWhat will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to \"justified self-defense\"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance.Phoenix:\n(This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!)Plead justified self-defense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to \"justified self-defense\"...\nvon Karma:\nHah.\nJudge:\nUnderstood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea.\nPhoenix:\n(...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?)\nMia:\n...You already hold the key... ...If you don't believe, you cannot win...\nPhoenix:\n(...! If we plead \"justified self-defense\", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor!\nJudge:\nY-Yes?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty!\nLeads to:\n\"...You.\"Plead not guilty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If we plead \"justified self-defense\"... we would basically be confessing to a murder!

Go ahead Detective and give your testimony...von Karma:\nI think the court would like to hear about the other piece of incriminating evidence!Witness Testimony-- Incriminating Evidence --Gumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.\nThis is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.\nAs you can see, it's covered in blood.\nThe defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.Judge:\nSo this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this.Gumshoe:\nThis piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts this into evidence.Maya's Costume added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??)von Karma:\nHah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer.

I don't, like, remember anything else. -Doctor Lurking in the Shadows? If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney.

You mean...?Phoenix:\nNo, I heard it's his successor this time...Maya:\nSuccessor...? ... Manfred von Karma... was a really sinister man. (Changed from [Manfred von Karma. He was a really sinister man.] in the original release) He pulled all sorts of nasty tricks; all so he could win.Phoenix:\n(He was a man obsessed with the word \"perfection\"... He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor... I wonder what kind of person they will turn out to be...)Maya:\nIt's no good...Mystic Maya!!Maya:\nPearly! You showed up! Thanks for coming all this way!Pearl:\nI was really worried about you...Maya:\nHey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together?Pearl:\nMother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks.Maya:\nHuh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself?Pearl:\nYup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map.Phoenix:\nDon't tell me you walked all the way here...Pearl:\nOf course not! ...I ran!Phoenix:\nThat's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...)Maya:\nPearly... What about the train?Pearl:\nHuh? What's a... \"tray-in\"?Phoenix:\n(I give up...)Pearl:\n...It's time, isn't it?Maya:\nUm... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma!Pearl:\nMr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that?Maya:\nUm, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend.Edgeworth:Maya:\nI still remember him as though I'd seen him only yesterday. (Changed from [I still remember him as if I had just seen him only yesterday.] in the original release)Phoenix:Maya:\nEvery trial was a scorchingly fierce battle until the very end. (Changed from [Every trial was a scorching fierce battle until the very end.] in the original release)Edgeworth:Phoenix:Maya:\nIt was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life...Phoenix:\nMaya! Please don't mention that name ever again...Maya:\nHuh...? But why, Nick?Phoenix:\nI'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back...Maya:\nWhaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!?Bailiff:\nCourt will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom.Phoenix:\n... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway.Maya:\nN...Nick...?June 21, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared????:\n...Phoenix:\n... (What is with this kid...?) (Changed from [... (What is with this girl...?)] in the original release)Judge:\n... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you prepared!? (Changed from [*Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nHuh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?)???:\nMr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:\n...!???:\nYou must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct?Phoenix:\n(...Hold on. So SHE'S the famed \"successor\" to Prosecutor von Karma...?) (Changed from [...Hold on. So this kid is the \"famed\" Prosecutor von Karma...?] in the original release)von Karma:\nI am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy.Phoenix:\nI... see...von Karma:\nI gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge.Phoenix:\nRevenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?)Judge:\nUm... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww!von Karma:\nI'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me.Phoenix:\n(Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!!von Karma:\nMake no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Judge:\nProsecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please...von Karma:\nThose of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is \"perfection\". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch.Judge:\nV-Very well... What is the defense's position?Phoenix:\nYour Honor.Judge:\nDoes the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"?Phoenix:\n...Yes.von Karma:\nFoolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time.Phoenix:\n(\"Justified self-defense\"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of themself. (Changed from [A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself.] in the original release) We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of \"not guilty\", Your Honor! (Because to plead \"justified self-defense\" is to say you did kill someone.)von Karma:\nHow foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness.Phoenix:\n(She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.)von Karma:\nWitness, your name and occupation?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!!von Karma:\nGet to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room.Judge:\nWhat were they doing in there?Gumshoe:\nUm... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir.Judge:\nCh-Channeling a spirit??Phoenix:\n(That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release)Gumshoe:\n*ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room.Judge:\nAh, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over.Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Judge:\nSo, how was the victim killed?Gumshoe:\nI was about to get to that...von Karma:\nStop wasting my time, then.Witness Testimony-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Judge:\nHmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot...Gumshoe:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report, sir.Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThe court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.Cross Examination-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim? Now, why would he have...\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\n\"Why would he have a pistol?\" Who cares? The point that you are missing is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start.\nJudge:\nFingerprints? There were fingerprints?\nGumshoe:\nAlong with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir.\nJudge:\nHmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...! I walked right into her hands there.) (Changed from [Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPoint blank, huh? So about how far away was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away.\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know he was shot at point blank?\nvon Karma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me!?\nvon Karma:\nGunpowder burn.\nPhoenix:\n...Gunpowder burn?\nvon Karma:\nWhen something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\nGumshoe:\nGunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...)Gumshoe:\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStabbed... And what was he stabbed with?\nGumshoe:\nA fruit knife.\nJudge:\nI see. And whose knife was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it.\nJudge:\nHmm... All over it, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. This does not look good...)\nvon Karma:\nHa ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Gumshoe:\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow severe was the wound?\nGumshoe:\nIf it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand.\nPhoenix:\n(This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...)Gumshoe:\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure he was stabbed first, then shot?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal.\nvon Karma:\nA fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... What a pain...)Phoenix:\n(Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...)After pressing first, second, third and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered.Gumshoe:\nI brought the two murder weapons with me today.Judge:\nVery well. The court accepts them into evidence.Pistol added to the Court Record.Knife added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThe date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time.Judge:\nAnd two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them, huh... (Changed from [And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...?] in the original release) Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case.von Karma:\nNaturally!Phoenix:\n(This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...)von Karma:\nYour Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there?Judge:\nThat is quite true... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Judge:\nEven in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead \"not guilty\"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose.von Karma:\nSee, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes...Judge:\nWhat will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to \"justified self-defense\"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance.Phoenix:\n(This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!)Plead justified self-defense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to \"justified self-defense\"...\nvon Karma:\nHah.\nJudge:\nUnderstood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea.\nPhoenix:\n(...There's nothing else I could do...

You mean...?Phoenix:\nNo, I heard it's his successor this time...Maya:\nSuccessor...? ... Manfred von Karma... was a really sinister man. (Changed from [Manfred von Karma. He was a really sinister man.] in the original release) He pulled all sorts of nasty tricks; all so he could win.Phoenix:\n(He was a man obsessed with the word \"perfection\"... He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor... I wonder what kind of person they will turn out to be...)Maya:\nIt's no good...Mystic Maya!!Maya:\nPearly! You showed up! Thanks for coming all this way!Pearl:\nI was really worried about you...Maya:\nHey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together?Pearl:\nMother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks.Maya:\nHuh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself?Pearl:\nYup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map.Phoenix:\nDon't tell me you walked all the way here...Pearl:\nOf course not! ...I ran!Phoenix:\nThat's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...)Maya:\nPearly... What about the train?Pearl:\nHuh? What's a... \"tray-in\"?Phoenix:\n(I give up...)Pearl:\n...It's time, isn't it?Maya:\nUm... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma!Pearl:\nMr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that?Maya:\nUm, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend.Edgeworth:Maya:\nI still remember him as though I'd seen him only yesterday. (Changed from [I still remember him as if I had just seen him only yesterday.] in the original release)Phoenix:Maya:\nEvery trial was a scorchingly fierce battle until the very end. (Changed from [Every trial was a scorching fierce battle until the very end.] in the original release)Edgeworth:Phoenix:Maya:\nIt was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life...Phoenix:\nMaya! Please don't mention that name ever again...Maya:\nHuh...? But why, Nick?Phoenix:\nI'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back...Maya:\nWhaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!?Bailiff:\nCourt will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom.Phoenix:\n... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway.Maya:\nN...Nick...?June 21, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared????:\n...Phoenix:\n... (What is with this kid...?) (Changed from [... (What is with this girl...?)] in the original release)Judge:\n... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you prepared!? (Changed from [*Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nHuh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?)???:\nMr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:\n...!???:\nYou must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct?Phoenix:\n(...Hold on. So SHE'S the famed \"successor\" to Prosecutor von Karma...?) (Changed from [...Hold on. So this kid is the \"famed\" Prosecutor von Karma...?] in the original release)von Karma:\nI am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy.Phoenix:\nI... see...von Karma:\nI gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge.Phoenix:\nRevenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?)Judge:\nUm... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww!von Karma:\nI'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me.Phoenix:\n(Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!!von Karma:\nMake no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Judge:\nProsecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please...von Karma:\nThose of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is \"perfection\". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch.Judge:\nV-Very well... What is the defense's position?Phoenix:\nYour Honor.Judge:\nDoes the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"?Phoenix:\n...Yes.von Karma:\nFoolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time.Phoenix:\n(\"Justified self-defense\"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of themself. (Changed from [A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself.] in the original release) We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of \"not guilty\", Your Honor! (Because to plead \"justified self-defense\" is to say you did kill someone.)von Karma:\nHow foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness.Phoenix:\n(She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.)von Karma:\nWitness, your name and occupation?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!!von Karma:\nGet to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room.Judge:\nWhat were they doing in there?Gumshoe:\nUm... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir.Judge:\nCh-Channeling a spirit??Phoenix:\n(That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release)Gumshoe:\n*ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room.Judge:\nAh, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over.Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Judge:\nSo, how was the victim killed?Gumshoe:\nI was about to get to that...von Karma:\nStop wasting my time, then.Witness Testimony-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Judge:\nHmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot...Gumshoe:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report, sir.Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThe court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.Cross Examination-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim? Now, why would he have...\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\n\"Why would he have a pistol?\" Who cares? The point that you are missing is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start.\nJudge:\nFingerprints? There were fingerprints?\nGumshoe:\nAlong with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir.\nJudge:\nHmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...! I walked right into her hands there.) (Changed from [Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPoint blank, huh? So about how far away was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away.\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know he was shot at point blank?\nvon Karma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me!?\nvon Karma:\nGunpowder burn.\nPhoenix:\n...Gunpowder burn?\nvon Karma:\nWhen something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\nGumshoe:\nGunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...)Gumshoe:\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStabbed... And what was he stabbed with?\nGumshoe:\nA fruit knife.\nJudge:\nI see. And whose knife was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it.\nJudge:\nHmm... All over it, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. This does not look good...)\nvon Karma:\nHa ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Gumshoe:\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow severe was the wound?\nGumshoe:\nIf it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand.\nPhoenix:\n(This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...)Gumshoe:\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure he was stabbed first, then shot?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal.\nvon Karma:\nA fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... What a pain...)Phoenix:\n(Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...)After pressing first, second, third and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered.Gumshoe:\nI brought the two murder weapons with me today.Judge:\nVery well. The court accepts them into evidence.Pistol added to the Court Record.Knife added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThe date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time.Judge:\nAnd two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them, huh... (Changed from [And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...?] in the original release) Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case.von Karma:\nNaturally!Phoenix:\n(This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...)von Karma:\nYour Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there?Judge:\nThat is quite true... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Judge:\nEven in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead \"not guilty\"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose.von Karma:\nSee, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes...Judge:\nWhat will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to \"justified self-defense\"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance.Phoenix:\n(This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!)Plead justified self-defense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to \"justified self-defense\"...\nvon Karma:\nHah.\nJudge:\nUnderstood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea.\nPhoenix:\n(...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?)\nMia:\n...You already hold the key... ...If you don't believe, you cannot win...\nPhoenix:\n(...! If we plead \"justified self-defense\", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor!\nJudge:\nY-Yes?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty!\nLeads to:\n\"...You.\"Plead not guilty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If we plead \"justified self-defense\"... we would basically be confessing to a murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'd be labeled a murderer... I can't let that happen!) Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHave you reached a conclusion, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense will not change its plea. We will accept nothing short of complete acquittal!\nLeads to:\n\"...You.\"von Karma:\n...You. You have sealed your fate, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!von Karma:\nPresent the final portion of your testimony -- the final strike.Gumshoe:\nUm... Y-Yes... sir...Judge:\nN-Now, see here! Proceedings are run by... Eek!von Karma:\n...Judge:\nOh, yes, of course. Go ahead Detective and give your testimony...von Karma:\nI think the court would like to hear about the other piece of incriminating evidence!Witness Testimony-- Incriminating Evidence --Gumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.\nThis is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.\nAs you can see, it's covered in blood.\nThe defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.Judge:\nSo this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this.Gumshoe:\nThis piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts this into evidence.Maya's Costume added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??)von Karma:\nHah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer. Feel free to sulk off with your tail between your legs, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\n(Please stop calling me by my full name. It's disturbing.)Cross Examination-- Incriminating Evidence --Gumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you say so in your testimony earlier!?\nGumshoe:\nUh... You're kinda scary today, you know, pal?\nJudge:\nCome now, Mr. Wright... There is no need for that kind of attitude in my court...\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nA-Alright. Just, please stop glaring at me like that...Gumshoe:\nThis is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya's... costume?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. She was wearing this when we arrested her.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... She's wearing her channeling costume today too... Is she not allowed to wear anything else...?)Gumshoe:\nAs you can see, it's covered in blood.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis blood on the costume...\nGumshoe:\nLab results show that it is the victim's blood.\nJudge:\nHmm... So there is blood from the victim on the defendant's clothes.\nPhoenix:\n(Definitely not good...) (Changed from [Definitely not good... Urk.] in the original release) So, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence? (Changed from [Hmm, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nUm, well...\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nIf you must change the topic, then the good detective here must testify again. But too bad. Not enough time. Let's move on. (Changed from [But too bad. Not enough time. Time to move on.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nAh, yes, Ms. von Karma is perfectly correct...\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... Now even the Judge is on her side! But if I bite off more than I can chew here...

There must be a reason as to why she suddenly threw out an objection like that... There must be something about this costume...!

There is no way for you to poke a hole in it.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! Looks like my time is up.

Actually, there is something very wrong with this piece of evidence.\nJudge:\nWh-What!?\nGumshoe:\nWhat are you talking about, pal!?\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nWh-Where is this problem you are talking about!?\nPhoenix:\n(I've come this far... There's no turning back now!)

We've determined that the blood splatter is from the victim. Where is the problem in that?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, where, pal?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I wonder about that too...\nJudge:\nThat last antic of yours just pushed me over the top, Mr. Wright. I hereby declare this cross-examination over... (Changed from [I am declaring that this cross-examination period is over...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nP-Please wait, Your Honor! (Ack! I'd better not mess up again...)\nLeads back to:\n\"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is a problem... somewhere around... here!\nJudge:\nWh-What does he mean, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nThere's nothing wrong with it. The only thing wrong here is the defense's head.\nJudge:\nWell said. You certainly do take after your father!\nPhoenix:\n(I've just been made to look like a fool again... Alright... Focus, Phoenix!)\nLeads back to:\n\"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume.\nJudge:\nThe sleeve? ...! There is a tiny hole here...\nGumshoe:\n..A... A hole...? But that wasn't in the report.\nJudge:\nHold on! What's this around the hole? I-It smells faintly of gunpowder!\nGumshoe:\nG-Gunpowder!? No one ever told me!\nJudge:\nA hole that smells of gunpowder...\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I've found the \"hole\" I was looking for!) Your Honor, the only logical conclusion you can make is that it must be a bullet hole!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! This is a very grave matter. It's best we correct the Court Record first before anything else.\nMaya's Costume updated in the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nSorry about that. I guess we messed up, sir.\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...! (I-Is she actually... smiling!? What else is she hiding!?)\nvon Karma:\nPull yourself together, Detective. That tiny \"hole\" doesn't change a thing. The strength of the evidence still holds. Continue with your testimony. That, just now, was a fluke. Nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nH-How can you say something like that!? This is a huge oversight!\nJudge:\nWhile I agree it is a mistake on the part of the police, what Prosecutor von Karma has said is true. The evidence still stands. If you do not find a more definitive problem with the evidence, then...\nPhoenix:\nNo way!!\nJudge:\nDetective Gumshoe, please continue with your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nLet it go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this.\nJudge:\nGood. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAlright. I'll give you that the blood spatter is from the victim, but... what is this hole in the sleeve?\nGumshoe:\nUm... Sorry, pal. We must've thought it was just a tear in the seam...\nPhoenix:\nMissing the hole is not what I'm asking you about. I'm talking about the hole itself! The smell of gunpowder  clearly gives away that... it is a bullet hole!\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nAs if little things like that matter.\nPhoenix:\nBut they do.\nvon Karma:\nA \"bullet hole\" in the sleeve, blood splatter all over the costume... Neither of these things can change the fact the defendant killed the victim.\nPhoenix:\n(...Grr... I know there's something more to that costume.)\nvon Karma:\nCome now Detective. You're wasting precious time.\nGumshoe:\n... Yes, sir.Gumshoe:\nThe defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe wasn't \"fighting back\"? How do you know if he was or wasn't!?\nGumshoe:\nWe could find no evidence that the victim put up any sort of struggle, pal.\nJudge:\nHmm... So did the murderer have a fight with the victim, or not? Depending on this, the circumstances around this murder change drastically.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... We're in real trouble now... If only I had something to prove that the victim did fight back...)Present Maya's Costume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Dick Gumshoe!\"Phoenix:\n(That Von Karma! She thinks she can decide the verdict with this testimony alone! I have to somehow find a critical contradiction and then I'll have her!)Phoenix:\nDetective Dick Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes? Heh, having you call me by my full name is kind of a weird feeling...Phoenix:\nYou said that my client killed \"a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.\"Gumshoe:\nYeah, I did.Phoenix:\nThen what, may I ask, is the bullet hole you police overlooked supposed to mean!?Gumshoe:\nEh, um... What does it mean?Phoenix:\nI'll tell you what it means. It means that the victim had fired off a shot. Is this what it means to \"not fight back\"?Gumshoe:\nA-Ah! You're right!Judge:\nIt seems you are correct! (Changed from [It would seem that way!] in the original release) If the victim had tried to shoot the defendant, then... it would change everything... (Changed from [If the victim tried to shoot the defendant, then... It would change everything...] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Alright! The wind seems to be shifting...)von Karma:\nHah.Phoenix:\n(What is with that \"are you finished yet\" laugh?)von Karma:\nAre you finished yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Judge:\nMs. von Karma?von Karma:\nIt seems... that Maya Fey was shot at by the victim. However, that is only grounds enough to support a \"justified self-defense\" plea.Judge:\nThat is correct.von Karma:\nBut I'm sure you remember, Your Honor, what the defense clearly said. They rejected \"justified self-defense\" and pleaded \"not guilty.\"Phoenix:\nAck!Gumshoe:\nNow that you...Judge:\nWhy, that's right!von Karma:\nWhich means! The defense has yet to prove anything at all!Phoenix:\nNooooo!!Judge:\nW-Well... Yes, that's true...von Karma:\nFurthermore... just the fact that there is a bullet hole in the costume... is not enough to substantiate even a plea of \"justified self-defense\".Judge:\nHuh? How so?Gumshoe:\nAaah!von Karma:\nDon't just stand there. Hurry up and tell the court what transpired that day. ...With the new information we acquired added in, of course.Gumshoe:\nHuh? You mean... By myself...? You want me to put together the scenario all by myself? Aah!von Karma:\n...Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Right away, sir!Witness Testimony-- What Transpired --Gumshoe:\nDuring the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.\nOf course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.\nWhile the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.\nThe victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.\nThe defendant then picked up on the opening, took the victim's gun, and ended it...Judge:\nHmm... This scenario you have put together does make sense...Gumshoe:\nYes, sir.Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(On the surface, it does seem to make sense... (Changed from [Just by listening, it does make sense...] in the original release) However, I won't give up that easily!)Judge:\nP-Please refrain from glaring at me like that... Now then, your cross-examination, please.Cross Examination-- What Transpired --Gumshoe:\nDuring the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is quite a difference in height between Dr. Grey and the defendant. Add in body strength, and it seems unlikely the defendant could have stabbed the victim!\nGumshoe:\nNow that you mention it... Yeah, I guess...\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nYou think you can get away with such flimsy reasoning? Mr. Phoenix Wright! Maya Fey was in the middle of channeling, was she not?\nPhoenix:\n...?\nvon Karma:\nWhen channeling with the Kurain Channeling Technique, the medium physically changes. With the nurse's build, the defendant could have easily been a match for the doctor.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't believe it... She even studied up on the Kurain Channeling Technique!)\nvon Karma:\nLike I said before... I am perfect.\nJudge:\nUm... Uh... About what you were talking about... I didn't quite get it...\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nUm, n-never mind. Let's continue with the testimony...Gumshoe:\nOf course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo he was stabbed, but the stab wound didn't kill him.\nGumshoe:\nBut if you think about the blood loss, it was pretty bad.\nPhoenix:\nHow bad would you say it was?\nGumshoe:\nActually, I went to give blood the other day. And afterward, I felt a little lightheaded and dizzy. ...I guess the damage was maybe... about 10 times the dizziness...? Ack!\nvon Karma:\n...\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry!Gumshoe:\nWhile the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhere in the world did that pistol come from?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Dr. Grey had specifically bought it for that day.\nPhoenix:\nBut a handgun...?\nGumshoe:\nHe got it off the black market about 2 days before the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(Why did Dr. Grey bring a gun...? Was he taking precautions against something...?)Gumshoe:\nThe victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're saying that the bullet hole in this costume was made then?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's what I'd think. The two of them were already fighting when a shot was fired.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... I'm really glad you weren't hurt...)\nvon Karma:\n...Present Maya's Costume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Missing the tiny hole on this costume...\"Gumshoe:\nThe defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya has never fired a gun before in her life!\nGumshoe:\nThe victim had already taken off the safety. With the safety off, even an amateur like you can fire it by pulling the trigger.\nPhoenix:\n(Even me...? I wonder...?)\nvon Karma:\nNow do you understand? A Von Karma's logic is perfect.Phoenix:\n(His testimony certainly makes us look very bad, but there's gotta be a contradiction in there somewhere... And uncovering it is going to uncover the truth! I can feel it!)Phoenix:\nMissing the tiny hole on this costume... will be the prosecution's undoing.Gumshoe:\nEh? What do you mean?Phoenix:\nThis little hole has actually created a huge hole in your testimony!Judge:\nE-Explain yourself, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nYou said the two of them were fighting when the victim fired his gun at point blank. If that were true, then where is the gunpowder burn on this costume!?Gumshoe:\nG-Gunpowder... burn?Phoenix:\nThis is what you testified earlier: \"When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\"Gumshoe:\nOH!Phoenix:\nBut there is not a single trace of gunpowder burn on this costume!!Judge:\nThat is a very good point. And... what exactly does this mean?Phoenix:\nIt means that when the shot was fired, they were standing apart from each other.Judge:\nHmm...von Karma:von Karma:\nI'm disappointed, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You think you can punch a hole in my logic with that? With wishy-washy thinking like that, anyone can explain anything away!Phoenix:\nThen I implore you to disprove my line of thinking.von Karma:\nLet's see... In the middle of their fight, the victim pushed the defendant away. And it was then, when they were separated, that he fired! How was that?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nAs if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that!von Karma:\n...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself. And then while she was preparing to strike again, the doctor took his shot. There. That sound satisfy even you.Judge:\nHmm... That does make an awful lot of sense. What do you think, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(I must be careful. I can't afford to make a mistake here! Concentrate and think!)It makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Ack, it's no good. I can't find a \"hole\" in her logic at all this time...) I admit it. Somehow, your reasoning makes logical sense.\nvon Karma:\nThat's it. That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Drat. It's 11:00 AM. I've already missed my morning tea. ...However. At least we were able to arrive at a conclusion.\nJudge:\nHmm... It does look that way.\nPhoenix:\n(...Oh boy... If I don't do something soon, it'll be curtains for Maya...)\nJudge:\nWell then, I think we can...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Please... Wait!\nJudge:\nWho was that? Mr. Wright? Please refrain from making unnecessary outbursts!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't care how, but I must find something to go on in Von Karma's explanation!)\nLeads to:\n\"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\"Something doesn't make sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\"Phoenix:\nThere is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!Gumshoe:\nFatal...?Judge:\nFlaw...!? Yeow!von Karma:\nVery interesting. I would love to see where this \"flaw\" is! Show me something that contradicts my explanation!Phoenix:\n(There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere! \"She put some distance between them before rushing to make the final blow. And when she was about to strike, the doctor took his shot.\" There must be a piece of evidence that contradicts this line of thinking!)Present Folding Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this!\nGumshoe:\nWhy are you showing this to me, pal?\nPhoenix:\nProsecutor von Karma's explanation and this piece of evidence...\nGumshoe:\n...Do not contradict!\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nGumshoe:\nHaha, looks like you need to use your brain a little more, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Being lectured by Gumshoe, of all people, is so embarrassing...)\nGumshoe:\nCome on! Hurry up and get that thinking cap on!\nLeads back to:\n\"There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere!\"Phoenix:\nThis is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.Judge:\nWhat is that? A folding screen?Phoenix:\nI would like to point the court's attention to the \"hole\" in this folding screen.von Karma:\nAaah!Phoenix:\nIt looks like you already know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\nWho? Where? What?Judge:\nMr. Wright! Your explanation, please!Phoenix:\n(Are these two really that clueless...?) The bullet went through the defendant's sleeve first, then the folding screen. It passed through at a height of approximately 8 inches off the ground... Which means! When the shot was fired, Maya... I mean, the defendant, was not getting ready to strike, but was actually squatting low to the ground!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Th-This changes everything!Phoenix:\nPlease look at this diagram of the crime scene. The victim, Dr. Grey was here when he fired the shot. And the bullet hit this folding screen. It hit at this location, about 8 inches off the ground. At this time, the defendant was in this area.Present area directly in front of bullet hole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"She was standing here, near the folding screen!\"Present area behind folding screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere!\nJudge:\nBehind the folding screen...?\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nvon Karma:\nThe victim and his attacker were fighting, were they not? Then what would the attacker be doing all the way back there!?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nvon Karma:\nBesides which, if the attacker was behind the folding screen, then how could the victim even know where to shoot? It's obviously impossible!\nPhoenix:\n... Yeah, I guess so...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Boy, did I just screw up royally... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)\nLeads back to:\n\"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSomewhere around here!\nJudge:\n...?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh.

Excuse me while I freshen up.\nPhoenix:\nUh, sure...\nJudge:\nIn the meantime, I want you to think things through again, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, of course... Whoops... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)\nLeads back to:\n\"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\"Phoenix:\nShe was standing here, near the folding screen!von Karma:\nW-Wait a second! We know the defendant was close to the ground based on the height of the bullet hole. But... How can you gauge the distance from that!? Isn't it possible that the defendant was standing much closer to the victim?Phoenix:\nThat's impossible.von Karma:\nB-But why!?Phoenix:\nYou, of all people, should know the answer to that question, Ms. von Karma. If she were shot from somewhere closer, there would be gunpowder burns present. However! There is nothing of the sort around the bullet hole of this costume!von Karma:\nAaaaaah! C-Curse you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You...!Judge:\nHmm... I believe it has now been proven that the defendant was standing a ways from the victim when she was shot at. But do you think this has changed the defendant's situation...?It doesn't change anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, even with that explanation, it feels like nothing has changed...

Let's continue with the testimony...Gumshoe:\nOf course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo he was stabbed, but the stab wound didn't kill him.\nGumshoe:\nBut if you think about the blood loss, it was pretty bad.\nPhoenix:\nHow bad would you say it was?\nGumshoe:\nActually, I went to give blood the other day. And afterward, I felt a little lightheaded and dizzy. ...I guess the damage was maybe... about 10 times the dizziness...? Ack!\nvon Karma:\n...\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry!Gumshoe:\nWhile the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhere in the world did that pistol come from?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Dr. Grey had specifically bought it for that day.\nPhoenix:\nBut a handgun...?\nGumshoe:\nHe got it off the black market about 2 days before the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(Why did Dr. Grey bring a gun...? Was he taking precautions against something...?)Gumshoe:\nThe victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're saying that the bullet hole in this costume was made then?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's what I'd think. The two of them were already fighting when a shot was fired.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... I'm really glad you weren't hurt...)\nvon Karma:\n...Present Maya's Costume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Missing the tiny hole on this costume...\"Gumshoe:\nThe defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya has never fired a gun before in her life!\nGumshoe:\nThe victim had already taken off the safety. With the safety off, even an amateur like you can fire it by pulling the trigger.\nPhoenix:\n(Even me...? I wonder...?)\nvon Karma:\nNow do you understand? A Von Karma's logic is perfect.Phoenix:\n(His testimony certainly makes us look very bad, but there's gotta be a contradiction in there somewhere... And uncovering it is going to uncover the truth! I can feel it!)Phoenix:\nMissing the tiny hole on this costume... will be the prosecution's undoing.Gumshoe:\nEh? What do you mean?Phoenix:\nThis little hole has actually created a huge hole in your testimony!Judge:\nE-Explain yourself, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nYou said the two of them were fighting when the victim fired his gun at point blank. If that were true, then where is the gunpowder burn on this costume!?Gumshoe:\nG-Gunpowder... burn?Phoenix:\nThis is what you testified earlier: \"When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\"Gumshoe:\nOH!Phoenix:\nBut there is not a single trace of gunpowder burn on this costume!!Judge:\nThat is a very good point. And... what exactly does this mean?Phoenix:\nIt means that when the shot was fired, they were standing apart from each other.Judge:\nHmm...von Karma:von Karma:\nI'm disappointed, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You think you can punch a hole in my logic with that? With wishy-washy thinking like that, anyone can explain anything away!Phoenix:\nThen I implore you to disprove my line of thinking.von Karma:\nLet's see... In the middle of their fight, the victim pushed the defendant away. And it was then, when they were separated, that he fired! How was that?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nAs if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that!von Karma:\n...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself. And then while she was preparing to strike again, the doctor took his shot. There. That sound satisfy even you.Judge:\nHmm... That does make an awful lot of sense. What do you think, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(I must be careful. I can't afford to make a mistake here! Concentrate and think!)It makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Ack, it's no good. I can't find a \"hole\" in her logic at all this time...) I admit it. Somehow, your reasoning makes logical sense.\nvon Karma:\nThat's it. That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Drat. It's 11:00 AM. I've already missed my morning tea. ...However. At least we were able to arrive at a conclusion.\nJudge:\nHmm... It does look that way.\nPhoenix:\n(...Oh boy... If I don't do something soon, it'll be curtains for Maya...)\nJudge:\nWell then, I think we can...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Please... Wait!\nJudge:\nWho was that? Mr. Wright? Please refrain from making unnecessary outbursts!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't care how, but I must find something to go on in Von Karma's explanation!)\nLeads to:\n\"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\"Something doesn't make sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\"Phoenix:\nThere is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!Gumshoe:\nFatal...?Judge:\nFlaw...!? Yeow!von Karma:\nVery interesting. I would love to see where this \"flaw\" is! Show me something that contradicts my explanation!Phoenix:\n(There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere! \"She put some distance between them before rushing to make the final blow. And when she was about to strike, the doctor took his shot.\" There must be a piece of evidence that contradicts this line of thinking!)Present Folding Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this!\nGumshoe:\nWhy are you showing this to me, pal?\nPhoenix:\nProsecutor von Karma's explanation and this piece of evidence...\nGumshoe:\n...Do not contradict!\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nGumshoe:\nHaha, looks like you need to use your brain a little more, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Being lectured by Gumshoe, of all people, is so embarrassing...)\nGumshoe:\nCome on! Hurry up and get that thinking cap on!\nLeads back to:\n\"There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere!\"Phoenix:\nThis is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.Judge:\nWhat is that? A folding screen?Phoenix:\nI would like to point the court's attention to the \"hole\" in this folding screen.von Karma:\nAaah!Phoenix:\nIt looks like you already know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\nWho? Where? What?Judge:\nMr. Wright! Your explanation, please!Phoenix:\n(Are these two really that clueless...?) The bullet went through the defendant's sleeve first, then the folding screen. It passed through at a height of approximately 8 inches off the ground... Which means! When the shot was fired, Maya... I mean, the defendant, was not getting ready to strike, but was actually squatting low to the ground!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Th-This changes everything!Phoenix:\nPlease look at this diagram of the crime scene. The victim, Dr. Grey was here when he fired the shot. And the bullet hit this folding screen. It hit at this location, about 8 inches off the ground. At this time, the defendant was in this area.Present area directly in front of bullet hole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"She was standing here, near the folding screen!\"Present area behind folding screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere!\nJudge:\nBehind the folding screen...?\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nvon Karma:\nThe victim and his attacker were fighting, were they not? Then what would the attacker be doing all the way back there!?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nvon Karma:\nBesides which, if the attacker was behind the folding screen, then how could the victim even know where to shoot? It's obviously impossible!\nPhoenix:\n... Yeah, I guess so...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Boy, did I just screw up royally... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)\nLeads back to:\n\"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSomewhere around here!\nJudge:\n...?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh. The judge's face is scrunched like he just smelled some serious bad breath...) Uhh... Um... That is, I mean...\nJudge:\nWait! I just realized I forgot to brush this morning... Excuse me while I freshen up.\nPhoenix:\nUh, sure...\nJudge:\nIn the meantime, I want you to think things through again, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, of course... Whoops... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)\nLeads back to:\n\"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\"Phoenix:\nShe was standing here, near the folding screen!von Karma:\nW-Wait a second! We know the defendant was close to the ground based on the height of the bullet hole. But... How can you gauge the distance from that!? Isn't it possible that the defendant was standing much closer to the victim?Phoenix:\nThat's impossible.von Karma:\nB-But why!?Phoenix:\nYou, of all people, should know the answer to that question, Ms. von Karma. If she were shot from somewhere closer, there would be gunpowder burns present. However! There is nothing of the sort around the bullet hole of this costume!von Karma:\nAaaaaah! C-Curse you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You...!Judge:\nHmm... I believe it has now been proven that the defendant was standing a ways from the victim when she was shot at. But do you think this has changed the defendant's situation...?It doesn't change anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, even with that explanation, it feels like nothing has changed... But I can't give up just yet!)\nLeads to:\n\"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\"It changes everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\"Phoenix:\nHonestly, Your Honor! This changes everything! The prosecution has claimed that the defendant was aiming to kill by stabbing. If that were true, delivering the final strike with the knife would be ideal. However! Where and what was the defendant doing at the time...?Gumshoe:\n...Squatting all the way by the folding screen...?Phoenix:\nExactly. If Maya Fey was the real murderer, why would she be by the folding screen instead of preparing to strike?von Karma:\nNnngh...Judge:\nUpon further consideration, it does make very little sense.Gumshoe:\nYeah, I figured there had to be a reason.Phoenix:\nFiguring things out and proving the logic behind everything is YOUR job!Gumshoe:\nOof...Phoenix:\n(Alright! With this, the rest of the trial should be in the b--)von Karma:\n...Phoenix:\n(...blast radius of disaster.)von Karma:\nYou are such a smart man, Mr. Phoenix Wright. To think that you've been able to take a completely hopeless case to this point... Now I know why Papa had a tough time with you. Mmm, you amuse me...Phoenix:\n(Uuugh. Of all the things to inherit, why did it have to be that smarmy smile!?)von Karma:\nDetective. How dare you damage my perfect logic!?Gumshoe:\nH-Huh!?... How is it all my fault??von Karma:\nYou can start repairing your standing by first removing that three-strand \"goatee\". Oh, and rest assured your punishment will come later.Gumshoe:\n...P-Punishment...von Karma:\nWell then, Your Honor, I think I've had all I can take of this detective's face. I think it's time to call in the next witness.Phoenix:\n(Next witness...? That's gotta be Lotta!)Judge:\nVery well. The court will take a 5 minute recess. After we reconvene, we will hear from the next witness.To be continued.June 21, 11:37 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Phoenix:\nPhew, that was a close one.Maya:\nI know you were giving it your all to defend me. But I could feel the death penalty hanging in the air...Phoenix:\nI felt like I was pretty close to dying myself...Pearl:\nBut you were wonderful out there. You listened carefully, made theories, and tricked everyone into believing you.Phoenix:\nTh-Thanks. Wait... Tricked??Pearl:\nThat must be the \"lawyer's\" secret technique, right?Maya:\nBy the way... Is the next witness who I think it is...?Phoenix:\nYeah, I'm pretty sure it's Lotta Hart.Maya:\nOh... Guess there's no escaping her, huh? (Changed from [Oh... Another jam, like always...] in the original release) Remember, Nick! You promised you'd save me! If you lose, me and my sis's ghosts will come after you and haunt you! (Changed from [If you lose, my ghost will come after you with my sis', and we'll haunt you!] in the original release)Pearl:\nYour sister...? Um, are you talking about Mystic Mia?Maya:\nYeah. Do you remember her, Pearly? My sister was a super good lawyer! She was also Nick's teacher.Pearl:\n...Oh, I didn't know that...June 21, 11:43 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Now, the first order of... Oww!von Karma:\nI don't want to hear it, old man. After I call my witness, sit there quietly and watch like a good little boy.Judge:\nY-Yes, sir.von Karma:\nBring in the photographer who witnessed the channeling!von Karma:\nWitness. Your name and occupation, if you please.Lotta:\nHey, Phoenix! How ya doin'?Phoenix:\nJust fine...Lotta:\nSorry 'bout this. Didn't exactly have a choice, ya know...? Yeowza!von Karma:\nName and occupation.Lotta:\nI-I declare! What in tarnation!? Hey, Judge! This here is violence against my fair self!Judge:\nThat's fine.Lotta:\n\"That's fine!?\" That ain't fine!! That's a whip! Eaaah!von Karma:\nThere's no need for foolish outcries from foolishly foolish fools. Just hurry up and testify about what happened on the day of the murder.Lotta:\nI haven't even gotten to say my name and job yet...von Karma:\n...Lotta:\nThe name's Lotta Hart, paranormal photographer, and I'm here to testify!Judge:\nNow, now, let's all be one big happy family... OK...?Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nOnly the Doc and the defendant went into the Channelin' Chamber.\nWe were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot!\nMr. Lawyer there broke the door down, and we rushed into the room.\nInside was the dead victim, and the defendant, wavin' a pistol around.\nI swear, other than those two, there was no one else in the room.Judge:\nAnd did you take a picture of the scene right after the murder took place?Lotta:\nReckon course!Phoenix:\nEh? ...Excuse me?Lotta:\nReckon course! It's short for \"Ya reckon!? Of course I did!\" Aah!von Karma:\nDoes it look like I care? Just hurry up and show your picture to the court.Phoenix:\n(The moment of truth. What will be in that picture?)Lotta:\nUmm, let's see here... This here's the picture!Judge:\nHmm... It would certainly seem that only the defendant and the victim were in that room.Lotta's Photo added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nAre you ready, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Phoenix:\n(I will clear all doubt about Maya through this cross-examination...

You mean...?Phoenix:\nNo, I heard it's his successor this time...Maya:\nSuccessor...? ... Manfred von Karma... was a really sinister man. (Changed from [Manfred von Karma. He was a really sinister man.] in the original release) He pulled all sorts of nasty tricks; all so he could win.Phoenix:\n(He was a man obsessed with the word \"perfection\"... He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor... I wonder what kind of person they will turn out to be...)Maya:\nIt's no good...Mystic Maya!!Maya:\nPearly! You showed up! Thanks for coming all this way!Pearl:\nI was really worried about you...Maya:\nHey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together?Pearl:\nMother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks.Maya:\nHuh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself?Pearl:\nYup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map.Phoenix:\nDon't tell me you walked all the way here...Pearl:\nOf course not! ...I ran!Phoenix:\nThat's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...)Maya:\nPearly... What about the train?Pearl:\nHuh? What's a... \"tray-in\"?Phoenix:\n(I give up...)Pearl:\n...It's time, isn't it?Maya:\nUm... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma!Pearl:\nMr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that?Maya:\nUm, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend.Edgeworth:Maya:\nI still remember him as though I'd seen him only yesterday. (Changed from [I still remember him as if I had just seen him only yesterday.] in the original release)Phoenix:Maya:\nEvery trial was a scorchingly fierce battle until the very end. (Changed from [Every trial was a scorching fierce battle until the very end.] in the original release)Edgeworth:Phoenix:Maya:\nIt was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life...Phoenix:\nMaya! Please don't mention that name ever again...Maya:\nHuh...? But why, Nick?Phoenix:\nI'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back...Maya:\nWhaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!?Bailiff:\nCourt will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom.Phoenix:\n... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway.Maya:\nN...Nick...?June 21, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared????:\n...Phoenix:\n... (What is with this kid...?) (Changed from [... (What is with this girl...?)] in the original release)Judge:\n... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you prepared!? (Changed from [*Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nHuh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?)???:\nMr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:\n...!???:\nYou must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct?Phoenix:\n(...Hold on. So SHE'S the famed \"successor\" to Prosecutor von Karma...?) (Changed from [...Hold on. So this kid is the \"famed\" Prosecutor von Karma...?] in the original release)von Karma:\nI am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy.Phoenix:\nI... see...von Karma:\nI gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge.Phoenix:\nRevenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?)Judge:\nUm... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww!von Karma:\nI'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me.Phoenix:\n(Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!!von Karma:\nMake no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Judge:\nProsecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please...von Karma:\nThose of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is \"perfection\". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch.Judge:\nV-Very well... What is the defense's position?Phoenix:\nYour Honor.Judge:\nDoes the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"?Phoenix:\n...Yes.von Karma:\nFoolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time.Phoenix:\n(\"Justified self-defense\"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of themself. (Changed from [A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself.] in the original release) We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of \"not guilty\", Your Honor! (Because to plead \"justified self-defense\" is to say you did kill someone.)von Karma:\nHow foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness.Phoenix:\n(She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.)von Karma:\nWitness, your name and occupation?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!!von Karma:\nGet to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room.Judge:\nWhat were they doing in there?Gumshoe:\nUm... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir.Judge:\nCh-Channeling a spirit??Phoenix:\n(That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release)Gumshoe:\n*ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room.Judge:\nAh, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over.Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Judge:\nSo, how was the victim killed?Gumshoe:\nI was about to get to that...von Karma:\nStop wasting my time, then.Witness Testimony-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Judge:\nHmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot...Gumshoe:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report, sir.Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThe court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.Cross Examination-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim? Now, why would he have...\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\n\"Why would he have a pistol?\" Who cares? The point that you are missing is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start.\nJudge:\nFingerprints? There were fingerprints?\nGumshoe:\nAlong with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir.\nJudge:\nHmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...! I walked right into her hands there.) (Changed from [Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPoint blank, huh? So about how far away was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away.\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know he was shot at point blank?\nvon Karma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me!?\nvon Karma:\nGunpowder burn.\nPhoenix:\n...Gunpowder burn?\nvon Karma:\nWhen something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\nGumshoe:\nGunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...)Gumshoe:\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStabbed... And what was he stabbed with?\nGumshoe:\nA fruit knife.\nJudge:\nI see. And whose knife was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it.\nJudge:\nHmm... All over it, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. This does not look good...)\nvon Karma:\nHa ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Gumshoe:\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow severe was the wound?\nGumshoe:\nIf it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand.\nPhoenix:\n(This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...)Gumshoe:\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure he was stabbed first, then shot?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal.\nvon Karma:\nA fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... What a pain...)Phoenix:\n(Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...)After pressing first, second, third and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered.Gumshoe:\nI brought the two murder weapons with me today.Judge:\nVery well. The court accepts them into evidence.Pistol added to the Court Record.Knife added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThe date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time.Judge:\nAnd two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them, huh... (Changed from [And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...?] in the original release) Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case.von Karma:\nNaturally!Phoenix:\n(This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...)von Karma:\nYour Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there?Judge:\nThat is quite true... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Judge:\nEven in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead \"not guilty\"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose.von Karma:\nSee, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes...Judge:\nWhat will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to \"justified self-defense\"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance.Phoenix:\n(This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!)Plead justified self-defense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to \"justified self-defense\"...\nvon Karma:\nHah.\nJudge:\nUnderstood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea.\nPhoenix:\n(...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?)\nMia:\n...You already hold the key... ...If you don't believe, you cannot win...\nPhoenix:\n(...! If we plead \"justified self-defense\", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor!\nJudge:\nY-Yes?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty!\nLeads to:\n\"...You.\"Plead not guilty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If we plead \"justified self-defense\"... we would basically be confessing to a murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'd be labeled a murderer... I can't let that happen!) Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHave you reached a conclusion, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense will not change its plea. We will accept nothing short of complete acquittal!\nLeads to:\n\"...You.\"von Karma:\n...You. You have sealed your fate, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!von Karma:\nPresent the final portion of your testimony -- the final strike.Gumshoe:\nUm... Y-Yes... sir...Judge:\nN-Now, see here! Proceedings are run by... Eek!von Karma:\n...Judge:\nOh, yes, of course. Go ahead Detective and give your testimony...von Karma:\nI think the court would like to hear about the other piece of incriminating evidence!Witness Testimony-- Incriminating Evidence --Gumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.\nThis is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.\nAs you can see, it's covered in blood.\nThe defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.Judge:\nSo this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this.Gumshoe:\nThis piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts this into evidence.Maya's Costume added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??)von Karma:\nHah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer. Feel free to sulk off with your tail between your legs, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\n(Please stop calling me by my full name. It's disturbing.)Cross Examination-- Incriminating Evidence --Gumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you say so in your testimony earlier!?\nGumshoe:\nUh... You're kinda scary today, you know, pal?\nJudge:\nCome now, Mr. Wright... There is no need for that kind of attitude in my court...\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nA-Alright. Just, please stop glaring at me like that...Gumshoe:\nThis is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya's... costume?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. She was wearing this when we arrested her.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... She's wearing her channeling costume today too... Is she not allowed to wear anything else...?)Gumshoe:\nAs you can see, it's covered in blood.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis blood on the costume...\nGumshoe:\nLab results show that it is the victim's blood.\nJudge:\nHmm... So there is blood from the victim on the defendant's clothes.\nPhoenix:\n(Definitely not good...) (Changed from [Definitely not good... Urk.] in the original release) So, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence? (Changed from [Hmm, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nUm, well...\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nIf you must change the topic, then the good detective here must testify again. But too bad. Not enough time. Let's move on. (Changed from [But too bad. Not enough time. Time to move on.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nAh, yes, Ms. von Karma is perfectly correct...\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... Now even the Judge is on her side! But if I bite off more than I can chew here... What should I do!?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Why is Ms. von Karma suddenly putting up resistance? There must be a reason as to why she suddenly threw out an objection like that... There must be something about this costume...! (Changed from [There must be a clue somewhere on this costume!] in the original release) I just have to look harder!)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Ms. von Karma's logic is perfect. There is no way for you to poke a hole in it.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! Looks like my time is up. So, about the costume...)\n\n\n\nThere is nothing wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this.\nJudge:\nGood. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nThere is one little thing...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. Actually, there is something very wrong with this piece of evidence.\nJudge:\nWh-What!?\nGumshoe:\nWhat are you talking about, pal!?\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nWh-Where is this problem you are talking about!?\nPhoenix:\n(I've come this far... There's no turning back now!) The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\n\n\n\nPresent bullet hole on left sleeve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent blood splatter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe problem is obviously the blood splatter here!\nJudge:\nB-But... We've determined that the blood splatter is from the victim. Where is the problem in that?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, where, pal?\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I wonder about that too...\nJudge:\nThat last antic of yours just pushed me over the top, Mr. Wright. I hereby declare this cross-examination over... (Changed from [I am declaring that this cross-examination period is over...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nP-Please wait, Your Honor! (Ack! I'd better not mess up again...)\nLeads back to:\n\"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is a problem... somewhere around... here!\nJudge:\nWh-What does he mean, Ms. von Karma?\nvon Karma:\nThere's nothing wrong with it. The only thing wrong here is the defense's head.\nJudge:\nWell said. You certainly do take after your father!\nPhoenix:\n(I've just been made to look like a fool again... Alright... Focus, Phoenix!)\nLeads back to:\n\"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume.\nJudge:\nThe sleeve? ...! There is a tiny hole here...\nGumshoe:\n..A... A hole...? But that wasn't in the report.\nJudge:\nHold on! What's this around the hole? I-It smells faintly of gunpowder!\nGumshoe:\nG-Gunpowder!? No one ever told me!\nJudge:\nA hole that smells of gunpowder...\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I've found the \"hole\" I was looking for!) Your Honor, the only logical conclusion you can make is that it must be a bullet hole!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!! This is a very grave matter. It's best we correct the Court Record first before anything else.\nMaya's Costume updated in the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nSorry about that. I guess we messed up, sir.\nvon Karma:\n...\nPhoenix:\n...! (I-Is she actually... smiling!? What else is she hiding!?)\nvon Karma:\nPull yourself together, Detective. That tiny \"hole\" doesn't change a thing. The strength of the evidence still holds. Continue with your testimony. That, just now, was a fluke. Nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nH-How can you say something like that!? This is a huge oversight!\nJudge:\nWhile I agree it is a mistake on the part of the police, what Prosecutor von Karma has said is true. The evidence still stands. If you do not find a more definitive problem with the evidence, then...\nPhoenix:\nNo way!!\nJudge:\nDetective Gumshoe, please continue with your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nLet it go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I pursue this and I turn up nothing, it could be disastrous...) You're right, Your Honor. There is absolutely nothing more to this.\nJudge:\nGood. Well, Detective, please continue with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Maya's Costume is updated in the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAlright. I'll give you that the blood spatter is from the victim, but... what is this hole in the sleeve?\nGumshoe:\nUm... Sorry, pal. We must've thought it was just a tear in the seam...\nPhoenix:\nMissing the hole is not what I'm asking you about. I'm talking about the hole itself! The smell of gunpowder  clearly gives away that... it is a bullet hole!\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nAs if little things like that matter.\nPhoenix:\nBut they do.\nvon Karma:\nA \"bullet hole\" in the sleeve, blood splatter all over the costume... Neither of these things can change the fact the defendant killed the victim.\nPhoenix:\n(...Grr... I know there's something more to that costume.)\nvon Karma:\nCome now Detective. You're wasting precious time.\nGumshoe:\n... Yes, sir.Gumshoe:\nThe defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe wasn't \"fighting back\"? How do you know if he was or wasn't!?\nGumshoe:\nWe could find no evidence that the victim put up any sort of struggle, pal.\nJudge:\nHmm... So did the murderer have a fight with the victim, or not? Depending on this, the circumstances around this murder change drastically.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... We're in real trouble now... If only I had something to prove that the victim did fight back...)Present Maya's Costume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Dick Gumshoe!\"Phoenix:\n(That Von Karma! She thinks she can decide the verdict with this testimony alone! I have to somehow find a critical contradiction and then I'll have her!)Phoenix:\nDetective Dick Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes? Heh, having you call me by my full name is kind of a weird feeling...Phoenix:\nYou said that my client killed \"a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.\"Gumshoe:\nYeah, I did.Phoenix:\nThen what, may I ask, is the bullet hole you police overlooked supposed to mean!?Gumshoe:\nEh, um... What does it mean?Phoenix:\nI'll tell you what it means. It means that the victim had fired off a shot. Is this what it means to \"not fight back\"?Gumshoe:\nA-Ah! You're right!Judge:\nIt seems you are correct! (Changed from [It would seem that way!] in the original release) If the victim had tried to shoot the defendant, then... it would change everything... (Changed from [If the victim tried to shoot the defendant, then... It would change everything...] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Alright! The wind seems to be shifting...)von Karma:\nHah.Phoenix:\n(What is with that \"are you finished yet\" laugh?)von Karma:\nAre you finished yet, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Judge:\nMs. von Karma?von Karma:\nIt seems... that Maya Fey was shot at by the victim. However, that is only grounds enough to support a \"justified self-defense\" plea.Judge:\nThat is correct.von Karma:\nBut I'm sure you remember, Your Honor, what the defense clearly said. They rejected \"justified self-defense\" and pleaded \"not guilty.\"Phoenix:\nAck!Gumshoe:\nNow that you...Judge:\nWhy, that's right!von Karma:\nWhich means! The defense has yet to prove anything at all!Phoenix:\nNooooo!!Judge:\nW-Well... Yes, that's true...von Karma:\nFurthermore... just the fact that there is a bullet hole in the costume... is not enough to substantiate even a plea of \"justified self-defense\".Judge:\nHuh? How so?Gumshoe:\nAaah!von Karma:\nDon't just stand there. Hurry up and tell the court what transpired that day. ...With the new information we acquired added in, of course.Gumshoe:\nHuh? You mean... By myself...? You want me to put together the scenario all by myself? Aah!von Karma:\n...Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Right away, sir!Witness Testimony-- What Transpired --Gumshoe:\nDuring the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.\nOf course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.\nWhile the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.\nThe victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.\nThe defendant then picked up on the opening, took the victim's gun, and ended it...Judge:\nHmm... This scenario you have put together does make sense...Gumshoe:\nYes, sir.Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(On the surface, it does seem to make sense... (Changed from [Just by listening, it does make sense...] in the original release) However, I won't give up that easily!)Judge:\nP-Please refrain from glaring at me like that... Now then, your cross-examination, please.Cross Examination-- What Transpired --Gumshoe:\nDuring the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere is quite a difference in height between Dr. Grey and the defendant. Add in body strength, and it seems unlikely the defendant could have stabbed the victim!\nGumshoe:\nNow that you mention it... Yeah, I guess...\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nYou think you can get away with such flimsy reasoning? Mr. Phoenix Wright! Maya Fey was in the middle of channeling, was she not?\nPhoenix:\n...?\nvon Karma:\nWhen channeling with the Kurain Channeling Technique, the medium physically changes. With the nurse's build, the defendant could have easily been a match for the doctor.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't believe it... She even studied up on the Kurain Channeling Technique!)\nvon Karma:\nLike I said before... I am perfect.\nJudge:\nUm... Uh... About what you were talking about... I didn't quite get it...\nPhoenix:\n...\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\nUm, n-never mind. Let's continue with the testimony...Gumshoe:\nOf course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo he was stabbed, but the stab wound didn't kill him.\nGumshoe:\nBut if you think about the blood loss, it was pretty bad.\nPhoenix:\nHow bad would you say it was?\nGumshoe:\nActually, I went to give blood the other day. And afterward, I felt a little lightheaded and dizzy. ...I guess the damage was maybe... about 10 times the dizziness...? Ack!\nvon Karma:\n...\nGumshoe:\nS-Sorry!Gumshoe:\nWhile the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhere in the world did that pistol come from?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the victim, Dr. Grey had specifically bought it for that day.\nPhoenix:\nBut a handgun...?\nGumshoe:\nHe got it off the black market about 2 days before the murder.\nPhoenix:\n(Why did Dr. Grey bring a gun...? Was he taking precautions against something...?)Gumshoe:\nThe victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're saying that the bullet hole in this costume was made then?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but that's what I'd think. The two of them were already fighting when a shot was fired.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... I'm really glad you weren't hurt...)\nvon Karma:\n...Present Maya's Costume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Missing the tiny hole on this costume...\"Gumshoe:\nThe defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya has never fired a gun before in her life!\nGumshoe:\nThe victim had already taken off the safety. With the safety off, even an amateur like you can fire it by pulling the trigger.\nPhoenix:\n(Even me...? I wonder...?)\nvon Karma:\nNow do you understand? A Von Karma's logic is perfect.Phoenix:\n(His testimony certainly makes us look very bad, but there's gotta be a contradiction in there somewhere... And uncovering it is going to uncover the truth! I can feel it!)Phoenix:\nMissing the tiny hole on this costume... will be the prosecution's undoing.Gumshoe:\nEh? What do you mean?Phoenix:\nThis little hole has actually created a huge hole in your testimony!Judge:\nE-Explain yourself, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nYou said the two of them were fighting when the victim fired his gun at point blank. If that were true, then where is the gunpowder burn on this costume!?Gumshoe:\nG-Gunpowder... burn?Phoenix:\nThis is what you testified earlier: \"When something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\"Gumshoe:\nOH!Phoenix:\nBut there is not a single trace of gunpowder burn on this costume!!Judge:\nThat is a very good point. And... what exactly does this mean?Phoenix:\nIt means that when the shot was fired, they were standing apart from each other.Judge:\nHmm...von Karma:von Karma:\nI'm disappointed, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You think you can punch a hole in my logic with that? With wishy-washy thinking like that, anyone can explain anything away!Phoenix:\nThen I implore you to disprove my line of thinking.von Karma:\nLet's see... In the middle of their fight, the victim pushed the defendant away. And it was then, when they were separated, that he fired! How was that?Phoenix:Phoenix:\nAs if that was even possible. According to testimony, the wound from the stabbing was very severe. The victim would not have had the strength to push the defendant very far after that!von Karma:\n...! W-Well... Then... That's right! The defendant must have pushed the victim away! After stabbing him, she must have put some space between the doctor and herself. And then while she was preparing to strike again, the doctor took his shot. There. That sound satisfy even you.Judge:\nHmm... That does make an awful lot of sense. What do you think, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\n(I must be careful. I can't afford to make a mistake here! Concentrate and think!)It makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Ack, it's no good. I can't find a \"hole\" in her logic at all this time...) I admit it. Somehow, your reasoning makes logical sense.\nvon Karma:\nThat's it. That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! Drat. It's 11:00 AM. I've already missed my morning tea. ...However. At least we were able to arrive at a conclusion.\nJudge:\nHmm... It does look that way.\nPhoenix:\n(...Oh boy... If I don't do something soon, it'll be curtains for Maya...)\nJudge:\nWell then, I think we can...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Please... Wait!\nJudge:\nWho was that? Mr. Wright? Please refrain from making unnecessary outbursts!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't care how, but I must find something to go on in Von Karma's explanation!)\nLeads to:\n\"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\"Something doesn't make sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!\"Phoenix:\nThere is a fatal flaw in her argument, Your Honor!Gumshoe:\nFatal...?Judge:\nFlaw...!? Yeow!von Karma:\nVery interesting. I would love to see where this \"flaw\" is! Show me something that contradicts my explanation!Phoenix:\n(There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere! \"She put some distance between them before rushing to make the final blow. And when she was about to strike, the doctor took his shot.\" There must be a piece of evidence that contradicts this line of thinking!)Present Folding Screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this!\nGumshoe:\nWhy are you showing this to me, pal?\nPhoenix:\nProsecutor von Karma's explanation and this piece of evidence...\nGumshoe:\n...Do not contradict!\nPhoenix:\n...Huh?\nGumshoe:\nHaha, looks like you need to use your brain a little more, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Being lectured by Gumshoe, of all people, is so embarrassing...)\nGumshoe:\nCome on! Hurry up and get that thinking cap on!\nLeads back to:\n\"There has to be a snag in her explanation somewhere!\"Phoenix:\nThis is the piece of evidence that destroys your logic.Judge:\nWhat is that? A folding screen?Phoenix:\nI would like to point the court's attention to the \"hole\" in this folding screen.von Karma:\nAaah!Phoenix:\nIt looks like you already know what I'm talking about.Gumshoe:\nWho? Where? What?Judge:\nMr. Wright! Your explanation, please!Phoenix:\n(Are these two really that clueless...?) The bullet went through the defendant's sleeve first, then the folding screen. It passed through at a height of approximately 8 inches off the ground... Which means! When the shot was fired, Maya... I mean, the defendant, was not getting ready to strike, but was actually squatting low to the ground!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Th-This changes everything!Phoenix:\nPlease look at this diagram of the crime scene. The victim, Dr. Grey was here when he fired the shot. And the bullet hit this folding screen. It hit at this location, about 8 inches off the ground. At this time, the defendant was in this area.Present area directly in front of bullet hole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"She was standing here, near the folding screen!\"Present area behind folding screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere!\nJudge:\nBehind the folding screen...?\nPhoenix:\nAck!\nvon Karma:\nThe victim and his attacker were fighting, were they not? Then what would the attacker be doing all the way back there!?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nvon Karma:\nBesides which, if the attacker was behind the folding screen, then how could the victim even know where to shoot? It's obviously impossible!\nPhoenix:\n... Yeah, I guess so...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Boy, did I just screw up royally... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)\nLeads back to:\n\"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSomewhere around here!\nJudge:\n...?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh. The judge's face is scrunched like he just smelled some serious bad breath...) Uhh... Um... That is, I mean...\nJudge:\nWait! I just realized I forgot to brush this morning... Excuse me while I freshen up.\nPhoenix:\nUh, sure...\nJudge:\nIn the meantime, I want you to think things through again, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, of course... Whoops... What's done is done. For now, I should focus on where Maya was at the time of the crime.)\nLeads back to:\n\"At this time, the defendant was in this area.\"Phoenix:\nShe was standing here, near the folding screen!von Karma:\nW-Wait a second! We know the defendant was close to the ground based on the height of the bullet hole. But... How can you gauge the distance from that!? Isn't it possible that the defendant was standing much closer to the victim?Phoenix:\nThat's impossible.von Karma:\nB-But why!?Phoenix:\nYou, of all people, should know the answer to that question, Ms. von Karma. If she were shot from somewhere closer, there would be gunpowder burns present. However! There is nothing of the sort around the bullet hole of this costume!von Karma:\nAaaaaah! C-Curse you, Mr. Phoenix Wright! You...!Judge:\nHmm... I believe it has now been proven that the defendant was standing a ways from the victim when she was shot at. But do you think this has changed the defendant's situation...?It doesn't change anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, even with that explanation, it feels like nothing has changed... But I can't give up just yet!)\nLeads to:\n\"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\"It changes everything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Honestly, Your Honor! This changes everything!\"Phoenix:\nHonestly, Your Honor! This changes everything! The prosecution has claimed that the defendant was aiming to kill by stabbing. If that were true, delivering the final strike with the knife would be ideal. However! Where and what was the defendant doing at the time...?Gumshoe:\n...Squatting all the way by the folding screen...?Phoenix:\nExactly. If Maya Fey was the real murderer, why would she be by the folding screen instead of preparing to strike?von Karma:\nNnngh...Judge:\nUpon further consideration, it does make very little sense.Gumshoe:\nYeah, I figured there had to be a reason.Phoenix:\nFiguring things out and proving the logic behind everything is YOUR job!Gumshoe:\nOof...Phoenix:\n(Alright! With this, the rest of the trial should be in the b--)von Karma:\n...Phoenix:\n(...blast radius of disaster.)von Karma:\nYou are such a smart man, Mr. Phoenix Wright. To think that you've been able to take a completely hopeless case to this point... Now I know why Papa had a tough time with you. Mmm, you amuse me...Phoenix:\n(Uuugh. Of all the things to inherit, why did it have to be that smarmy smile!?)von Karma:\nDetective. How dare you damage my perfect logic!?Gumshoe:\nH-Huh!?... How is it all my fault??von Karma:\nYou can start repairing your standing by first removing that three-strand \"goatee\". Oh, and rest assured your punishment will come later.Gumshoe:\n...P-Punishment...von Karma:\nWell then, Your Honor, I think I've had all I can take of this detective's face. I think it's time to call in the next witness.Phoenix:\n(Next witness...? That's gotta be Lotta!)Judge:\nVery well. The court will take a 5 minute recess.

I think it was something that sounded like a gunshot...\nJudge:\nAnd why are we here listening to the defense testify!?\nPhoenix:\n(...And the world becomes just a little crueler...)\nLotta:\nI heard a gunshot a long time ago, so I know.

It was Maya that went in.)\nJudge:\nHmm... It looks like we've come to a collective conclusion. The person in this picture is most certainly Maya Fey.\nvon Karma:\nExactly.\nPhoenix:\n(Rats!

I mean, I am having a little difficulty in understanding you. If you would stop saying such things as \"Reckongiven\" and so forth... Aah!\nvon Karma:\nNow then, Mr. Phoenix Wright, do you see a problem with the testimony or don't you?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nbehind the door?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about... behind the door? Did you check there?\nLotta:\nWhat do I look like to you? I wasn't born yesterday, ya know! First off, the one that bust that door open was you! With the way ya slammed that door, anyone standin' behind it woulda had more face and less nose, free of charge!\nvon Karma:\nIn any case, there was no one standing behind the door.\nPhoenix:\n(She actually had the police investigate that too!?)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nunder the flooring?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about... under the flooring?

You were there too, were you not!?\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nvon Karma:\nWhy don't you answer that yourself? Was it really just the two of them?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes. Dr. Grey and Maya were the only two who went into the room...\nJudge:\nH-Hold on! We can't have the defense testifying against its own client!\nLotta:\nAnyway, folks, only the two of 'em went into the Channelin' Chamber, ya hear?\nvon Karma:\nBut you knew that from the very beginning, didn't you? ...Witness, continue.Lotta:\nWe were waitin' outside the door and then, \"bang!\" we hear this gunshot!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas it really a gunshot!?\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nAre you insane!? You must have heard it as well!\nPhoenix:\nUrk.\nvon Karma:\nWhy don't you testify for the court, Mr. Phoenix Wright? Was it really a gunshot?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes. I think it was something that sounded like a gunshot...\nJudge:\nAnd why are we here listening to the defense testify!?\nPhoenix:\n(...And the world becomes just a little crueler...)\nLotta:\nI heard a gunshot a long time ago, so I know. And I tell ya that was a gunshot I heard.

This \"Mr. Lawyer there\" broke the door down!?\nvon Karma:\nHonestly, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Why don't you tell us what happened, then?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Yes, Ms. von Karma... I broke the door down. Sorry. (Why does this feel like an inquisition?)\nLotta:\nNo need for apologizin'! That was great! You're a real man!\nJudge:\nOh, really?

Think back to when those two entered the Channeling Chamber.\nLotta:\nWhen they entered...?\nvon Karma:\nOne of those people that entered the chamber was Maya Fey, correct?\nLotta:\nYeah, that's right!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... It was Maya that went in.)\nJudge:\nHmm... It looks like we've come to a collective conclusion. The person in this picture is most certainly Maya Fey.\nvon Karma:\nExactly.\nPhoenix:\n(Rats!

I mean, I am having a little difficulty in understanding you. If you would stop saying such things as \"Reckongiven\" and so forth... Aah!\nvon Karma:\nNow then, Mr. Phoenix Wright, do you see a problem with the testimony or don't you?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nbehind the door?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about... behind the door? Did you check there?\nLotta:\nWhat do I look like to you? I wasn't born yesterday, ya know! First off, the one that bust that door open was you! With the way ya slammed that door, anyone standin' behind it woulda had more face and less nose, free of charge!\nvon Karma:\nIn any case, there was no one standing behind the door.\nPhoenix:\n(She actually had the police investigate that too!?)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nunder the flooring?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about... under the flooring? Did you check there?\nLotta:\nI ain't no ignoramus to make it out here!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?... Wh-What are you talking about?\nLotta:\nDon't \"what are ya talkin' about\" me! Under the floorin'? C'mon!, even a bug wouldn't crawl under that!\nvon Karma:\nSorry to disappoint, but there was no secret passageway under the flooring.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh... Yeah, that was a bit far-fetched, huh...?)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\n(Argh! Her story adds up... What's worse, I was there at the scene of the crime with her...

The face of the defendant can not be verified in this picture. However, if we think about the circumstances, it would have to be the defendant.Phoenix:\n(What am I going to do!?

Your show of support was just great...)\nvon Karma:\n...\nJudge:\n...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof.

I thought I would work on my inflections. Just wondering what an \"Objection!\" with a twist of \"You're wrong!\" sounds like.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I'm sorry, but I don't follow your logic.\nPhoenix:\n(Shoot. I guess I wasn't showing enough confidence...)\n\n\n\nPresent another piece\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads back to:\n\"...Now, then, Mr. Wright. Please show the court some proof.\"\n\n\n\n\nGive up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright?\"Can't present anything yet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright?\"Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nNothing, Your Honor...von Karma:\nThat's very smart of you, Mr. Phoenix Wright.

I just don't have the right piece of evidence to prove my argument...)Judge:\nThat's enough!Phoenix:\n(I-Is this it...? Is this all I could do...?)Judge:\nI think it is quite obvious to this court that a verdict of not guilty is not possible.von Karma:\nI told you. Totally, 100% impossible.Judge:\nMs. von Karma, do you have any further questions for this witness?von Karma:\nHaving established the defendant's guilt, further questioning won't be needed.Judge:\nWhat about the defense? No further questions, I presume?Phoenix:\n(I... I couldn't protect Maya...) The defense... The defense......Phoenix... ...Phoenix, you can't make that kind of face... ...A lawyer is someone who smiles... no matter how bad it gets!...Phoenix:\nM-Mia!Mia:\nI guess I made it just in time, wouldn't you say?Phoenix:\nY-You...

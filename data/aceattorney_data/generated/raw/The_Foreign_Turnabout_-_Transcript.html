Phoenix:<br />
On the western edge of the Far East lies a peaceful country of spirit mediums and mystery -- the kingdom of Khura'in. But now, the flames of revolution are threatening to consume it whole. But things like "revolt" and "revolution" were the furthest things from my mind when I first arrived in this land.
</p>

<div style="text-align: right;">Episode 1<br />The Foreign Turnabout</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<center>Here in Khura'in, death is not the end. Even after death, the soul lives on in the Twilight Realm... ...and priestesses can commune with the spirits of the dead. Fear not death. In the name of the Holy Mother... ...fear only the impurities of your soul.</center>
<p><br />
???:<br />
This blight on my soul... I'll have the child take the blame...
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">April 23, 4:26 PM<br />Kingdom of Khura'in</span></center>
<p><br />
Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Whew! I'm finally here. So this is the <span style="color:#E16935">Kingdom of Khura'in</span>, huh? What a long trip. I wonder how many hours I was in the air. But just look at this place! Get a load of this street! It really feels like I'm in another world here! And that gorgeous temple! I read that's the center of town. Wow! An ox right in the middle of the street! I have to get a picture of that!)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
E-Excuse me, sir.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I wonder what kind of bird that is. I've never seen anything like it. That's quite a crest it has on its head!)</span>
</p><p>???:<br />
Excuse me, sir!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What? Oh! Yes?
</p><p>???:<br />
Pardon me, but are you Mr. Wright?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Uh, yes, that's right. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Oops. Hope he hasn't been trying to get my attention all this time...)</span> Wait a minute. Are you...?
</p><p>???:<br />
That's right! <span style="color:#E16935">Ahlbi Ur'gaid</span>, at your service!
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
I'm a monk-in-training at Tehm'pul Temple, and I'll be your guide around town. It's very nice to meet you. Hap'piraki!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
"H-Happy" what, now...?
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
"Hap'piraki"! That's how we greet people here in Khura'in. It's like "Hello!" or "How do you do?" It's a pretty handy expression to know!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Okay, let me give it a try. Hello. I'm Phoenix Wright. Hap'piraki!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(My name is <span style="color:#E16935">Phoenix Wright</span>. And I run a small law office. Well, that's what I do back home, anyway. Right now, I'm just a traveler; a stranger in a strange land.)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ahlbi:<br />
Welcome to our country! Welcome to the Kingdom of Khura'in, land of spirit mediums and mystery! This is for you! To celebrate your arrival!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
S-Speaking of mystery, what is this mysterious green lump, exactly?
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Allow me to explain! This is a famous Khura'inese sweet bun. It's called a "<span style="color:#E16935">magatah'man</span>," or "<span style="color:#E16935">soul bun</span>"! It's shaped like a magatama. It's so yummy it'll send your soul right to the Twilight Realm!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That... doesn't exactly make me eager to try it...)</span> Th-Thanks. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I think I'll indulge later.)</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
That will be twenty dahmas. Thank you for your patronage!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I have to pay?!)</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
I always have plenty of those on hand, so just let me know if you ever want any more!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(No wonder his bag looks so heavy. It's stuffed with all the tools of his trade.)</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Oops! I almost forgot to tell you something really important. It's about <span style="color:#E16935">Miss Maya</span>. She can't come to see you for a few days yet.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yeah. When I called her from the airport, she said she was still training up in the mountains. I told her I'd wait for her here. Either way, I was glad to hear she's in good spirits. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Maya Fey. She's a spirit medium who used to work as my assistant. I came all the way out here to celebrate the end of her ascetic training with her.)</span> Ahlbi, this is my first time in this country, so I'll be counting on you, okay?
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
You got it, sir! Please don't hesitate if you need anything at all!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Maya was right when she told me I could leave everything in your capable hands.
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Aww shucks, she said that? That sure was nice of her! I had a chance to show Miss Maya around a little bit, too.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If there's one person Maya WAS worried about, it's me. "Because we both know trouble likes to follow you wherever you go," she said. Hmph! That girl worries too much.)</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
But you sure came early to the party, Mr. Wright, sir! I mean, Miss Maya won't be done with her training for another two weeks.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh. I hate to admit it, but I came early because I was worried about her, too...)</span> Oh, well, you know. Ha ha! I thought I'd get in a little sightseeing first.
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Ooh, sightseeing?! Well, I'm your man for that! I'll show you all the best sights this country has to offer!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Th-Thanks. That would be great. <span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess Ahlbi takes his job very seriously.)</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Well?! What are we waiting for? Those sights aren't going to see themselves!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yikes! You don't have to shove!
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
First stop, <span style="color:#E16935">Tehm'pul Temple</span>, right there in the center of town! There's something there I really want to show you!
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:green">April 23, 4:45 PM<br />Tehm'pul Temple Plaza</span></center>
<p><br />
Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Wow! It's even more impressive up close!)</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Allow me to explain! This is the heart of our town, Tehm'pul Temple. It was created by the founder of <span style="color:#E16935">Khura'inism</span>, the <span style="color:#E16935">Holy Mother</span>, herself! I'm training right here at this temple to be a monk someday.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I read that the people of this country are all adherents of Khura'inism. According to my guidebook, it's a religion in which ancestral spirits are venerated.)</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
The Holy Mother was a great <span style="color:#E16935">spirit medium</span> who could commune with our ancestors' souls. And spirit mediums become <span style="color:#E16935">queen</span> to this day, direct descendants of the Holy Mother.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A spirit medium rules the entire country, huh. Talk about power and influence...)</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
The main thing you'll want to see when you come to Tehm'pul Temple is... ...the <span style="color:#E16935">Dance of Devotion</span> rite! The Dance of Devotion takes place twice, one in the morning and once in the afternoon. This dance, along with the <span style="color:#E16935">Song of Ceremony</span>, is performed in offering to the Holy Mother! The Dance of Devotion has the power to summon forth souls from the Twilight Realm! In Khura'inism, we believe the soul is carried by the sacred Khura'inese butterfly! Its wings form a loop that wraps around the soul to transport it--
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Hold it! Slow down! I can't remember all of that at once.
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Oh! I'm sorry! I guess I got a little overexcited.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Anyway, the main thing I got from all that is that you really, really love your country.
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Heh heh. Well, that's sure true!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I like this kid. He pours his heart into everything he does.)</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />

Come to think of it, Miss Maya told me she could tell I love my country, too. We stood here for about an hour while I told her all about the Holy Mother.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Really?! An hour?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Hope that counted as patience training...)</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
And she seemed really interested, too. She listened to my whole speech!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />

Is it that time already?! We have to hurry into the temple right away! But first... let me give you this lyrics card for the Song of Ceremony I told you about. There's an English translation of the lyrics there, too, so give it a read, okay? Let's go!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
B-But why the big rush?
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
If we don't hurry, we'll miss the beginning of <span style="color:#E16935">Her Benevolence</span>'s Dance of Devotion!

Wait. What?

Of course you wouldn't be aware, being a foreigner and all... ...but we have no need for defense attorneys here in the Kingdom of Khura'in. We leave it all up to Her Benevolence's sacred power of Spirit Communion. Her <span style="color:#E16935">Divination Séances</span> determine all.

Hmm... But I have a previous engagement, you see. A class together with the missus.

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, if you would please give your opening argument once again, Mr. Payne.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Certainly, Your Magistry. The accused is charged with two crimes: <span style="color:#E16935">larceny</span>... and <span style="color:#E16935">murder</span>. Yesterday, the <span style="color:#E16935">Founder's Orb</span> was stolen from the treasure room of Tehm'pul Temple. In addition to the theft, two other things were discovered in the treasure room: the <span style="color:#E16935">dead body</span> of Mr. Paht Rohl, temple security guard, and... ...the empty <span style="color:#E16935">treasure box</span> that housed the orb which Mr. Rohl was in charge of guarding. We believe that Mr. Rohl was murdered by the thief who stole the treasure.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
To kill a guard armed with a gun... What a terrifyingly bold act!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I couldn't agree more, Your Magistry. Please allow me to submit as evidence the victim's autopsy report and crime photo.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Rohl's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Crime Photo added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... It's been a long time since we had evidence presented in court as well. It's kind of refreshing, actually. Ha ha ha!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
We may rely on the power of the Séances, but our police still carry out investigations. Thus, any proof I provide is indisputable!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh, really? Well, forgive me if I don't just take your word for it. <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from &#91;I can check the evidence out myself by looking at them in the Court Record.&#93; in the original release">I can check the evidence out myself by looking in the <span style="color:#E16935">Court Record</span> ([R / RB / E]).</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [I can check the evidence out myself by looking at them in the Court Record.] in the original release)</span> We'll see just how thorough you and your police were, Mr. Payne.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Such a deplorable crime! The audacity of stealing the sacred treasure of Her Holiness, our founding mother... It's a crime that strikes at the very heart of our nation!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Exactly, Your Magistry! We mustn't let the culprit get away with these heinous deeds. Indeed, such deeds are best described as "treason against the crown."
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Is this treasure really such a valuable object?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
H-How can you even ask such a thing?! Of course it is! Why, sealed within this treasure is the very soul -- the mitamah -- of the Holy Mother!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Her soul is sealed within the treasure? <span style="color:#0070C0">(I think I'll take that with a grain of salt.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Grrr. You don't believe it, do you?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
O-Of course I believe it! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Something tells me I'd better play along.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmph. This kind of irreverence is exactly why I dislike defense attorneys so much.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Your Honor-- Er, Your Magistry?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What is it now?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
This treasure... I've never seen it, so it's a little hard for me to imagine. Could I see a photo of it or something?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Of all the outlandish requests! You defense attorneys are truly beyond the pale!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's been getting awfully angry with me. And are those veins popping out of his forehead?!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
It's forbidden for anyone outisde of the royal family to view the treasure itself. They say that anyone without the proper spiritual power would be blinded instantly. That is why the average person has never seen the treasure, Mr. Wright.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess there are national treasures that are off-limits to the public back home, too.)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
For the benefit of the shamelessly uninformed defense, let me share this newspaper article. It includes photos taken about eight years ago when the treasure was unearthed. These are the only public photos of the outer box in existence. What's more, the treasure box only leaves the temple's treasure room but once a year... ...for a special New Year's rite that takes place at the palace. Therefore, this treasure box has only ever been seen by a handful of people.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Treasure Box added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I hear there's been a string of thefts lately of historic artifacts from the temple.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Right, Your Magistry. Inexcusable thievery of precious national treasures for personal gain. And the culprit is the accused.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So he used his position as monk-in-training to get his hands on the treasure, is that it?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The accused's family is by no means wealthy. To help with family finances, he works as a tour guide in addition to his ascetic training.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you for giving an excellent outline of the case, Mr. Payne. Now, then. No more questions from the defense, I presume?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What? No, I DO have questions!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Even more? But you just asked a bunch. Well, make it snappy. My class starts in just a few short minutes.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What?! He's still planning on going to that thing...? There's still a lot I don't know about the case. I should ask now while I have the chance. Let's see. What else do I need to know more about?)</span>

What do you claim was the defendant's motive?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mr. Payne has already explained that. He wanted to sell the treasure in order to help his family with living expenses.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Oh, yeah. Guess it slipped my mind.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So it's true what they say about lawyers never listening to anyone but themselves.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
My apologies, Your Magistry! Please let me give it one more try!

<p>Phoenix:<br />
Mr. Payne, what was the murder weapon?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The murder weapon was... the <span style="color:#E16935">treasure box</span> itself. The empty treasure box left at the scene had a large bloodstain on it.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
How utterly reprehensible, using the sacred treasure box for murder!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The accused came to the treasure room with the express purpose of stealing the treasure. <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from &#91;He climbed the altar stairs and snatched the box, ready to abscond with the treasure.&#93; in the original release">He climbed the altar stairs and snatched the box, ready to abscond with it.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [He climbed the altar stairs and snatched the box, ready to abscond with the treasure.] in the original release)</span> But he was discovered by Mr. Rohl, who had come to the room in the course of his rounds. After walloping Mr. Rohl on the head with the treasure box... ...the accused forced the bloodied housing open and made off with the treasure inside.
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Treasure Box updated in the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But the defendant is just a little boy. I hardly think he would be able to hit the victim -- a grown man -- on the head.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Ah, a very good point, Mr. Wright... but I'm afraid that won't help you. At the time of the crime, the accused was on the stairs leading up to the altar. The accused's elevated position would more than make up for their difference in stature.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yeah... I guess that makes sense...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ha ha ha ha! Mr. Payne, your reasoning is flawless. What an elegant argument! Hats off to you, Chief Prosecutor! Your title is obviously well earned! Well, the accused's guilt is certainly conclusive. Unless there is anything else, I am ready to announce my verdict. Very well. In that case, I find the accused...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
J-Just one moment, Your Magistry! Don't-- Don't you think you're rushing the verdict just a little bit?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I told you. I have plans to attend to, and... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH! I'm late! It's already started! How did the time fly by so fast?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's STILL stuck on that...?)</span> We haven't even heard the defendant's side of the story yet! Your Magistry, the defense asserts its right to cross-examine the defendant!
</p>
<center>............</center>
<p><br />
Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Huh? Did I say something funny?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
"Cross-examine the"...? What do you mean by that?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What?! What do you mean, "what do I mean"?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I seem to have some dim recollection of the process, but I can't quite recall...
</p><p>Payne:<br />
And little wonder! A so called "defendant" hasn't been questioned in over twenty years.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Should I even be surprised anymore?)</span> Anyway, I demand we let the defendant -- or the "accused" -- tell his side of the story!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
......Is that really necessary?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Of course it's necessary, Your Magistry!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh heh. What harm could it do? I say we allow the boy to speak, Your Magistry. Though I doubt he'll have anything of relevance to say... Heh heh heh heh heh heh.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Oh, how kind of you, Your Royal Payne-ness.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Very well. As long as it's okay with you, Mr. Payne. I'm already hopelessly late for my class, anyway.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
In that case, the prosecution calls the accused back to the witness stand.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh! But before we do, I'd better call my wife and apologize for missing that class. Any objections...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
...Go for it, Your Magistry.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Payne:<br />
Accused, state your name and occupation again, if you would.
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Ahlbi Ur'gaid... I'm in training to be a monk... and I'm a tour guide, too.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
*sigh*... Why me...? Now, where were we?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Cross-examining the defendant, Your Magistry.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Right, right. Let's do that, then. At the defense attorney's insistence, I might add. *sigh*...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He sounds a little dispirited. His wife must've given him a piece of her mind.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, the defense had better get to it. And make it quick, if you please.
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
"Th-The defense"... Mr. Wright... I didn't know you were a lawyer...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well, I am, and I'm here to defend you, Ahlbi. Don't worry. All you have to do is tell the truth, and you'll be all right.
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
You... You tricked me!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What?
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
If I knew you were a lawyer, I wouldn't have given you that tour! Give back that magatah'man I gave you yesterday!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
A-Ahlbi, what's gotten into you?
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Don't talk to me. You... You disgust me!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Now even Ahlbi's against me! But why?!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh heh. This must be a new experience for you, Mr. Wright, being loathed by a client.
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
............
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Now, then, accused, please give the court your testimony. The incident occurred around noon... ...during the break between the morning and afternoon Dances of Devotion. I want you to tell the court what you were doing around that time.
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
All right...
</p>
<hr />
<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- The Accused's Account --</span></center>
<p>Ahlbi:<br />
I didn't kill Mr. Rohl, and I didn't steal the treasure.<br />
I'm not allowed to go anywhere near the treasure room.<br />
I've never even seen that treasure box with the green Khura'inese butterfly on it!<br />
When the incident happened, I was in the hallway, planning out my tour route.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Judge:<br />
Were you well-acquainted with the victim?
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Yes. He used to chat with me whenever we ran into each other in the temple. Mr. Rohl was a monk-in-training when he was a kid, too, you know.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I bet Ahlbi looked up to him.)</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
But he had to give that up and go work when his family needed money... That's why he became a guard. But at least that way, he could still stay on at the temple. He was so proud when he was put in charge of guarding the treasure box! He even got to carry the box to the palace for the New Year's rite!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The victim's parents apparently both died relatively young. So Mr. Rohl had to support his younger brothers and sisters as well. But even with his job as a security guard, I'm sure things couldn't have been easy for him.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(It sounds like his circumstances and Ahlbi's were very similar.)</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Mr. Rohl encouraged me to never give up. "Ahlbi, you train hard and make sure you become a monk one day! Don't end up like me," he'd say. He was always cheering me on, in my training, and in my tour guide business, too. Why in the world would I kill a nice man like that?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, yes. I see. You expressed yourself well. Defense, now that you've heard the accused's account, are you finally satisfied? If so, let's draw this to an expeditious conclusion...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But, Your Magistry! I haven't even cross-examined the defendant yet!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hm? That wasn't the end of it? It's been so long, I don't rightly recall what this "cross-examining" thing is all about.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(A judge who doesn't know what a "cross-examination" is... What fresh hell is this?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I really do wish I could remember how it works...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Should I give the judge a refresher on cross-examination?)</span>

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Clearly, something is getting lost in translation with His Magistry...)</span> The point is, it's possible that a statement could contain a <span style="color:#E16935">lie</span> or a <span style="color:#E16935">mistake</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />

Hmph. "<span style="color:#E16935">Presenting</span>" evidence is one thing, but "<span style="color:#E16935">Pressing</span>" witnesses? I'll have you know, defense, that I do not allow violence in my courtroom!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
R-Rest assured! Only gentle verbal pressure is used. No physical force involved!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, I'm not convinced... After all, who knows what sort of tactics an attorney will resort to? One false move and I'll call the bailiff!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yeah... Something's definitely getting lost in there...

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But you weren't in the treasure room at the time of the incident, right?
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
......O-Of course I wasn't.

</p><p>Payne:<br />
Hmph. That is a lie. You were most definitely inside the treasure room on the day of the incident. And I have proof.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He does?!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
This was found on the floor of the treasure room. It's a scroll entitled "<span style="color:#E16935">Notice</span>," and contains a list of temple monk duties. These instructions pertain to the day of the incident.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
A-And what exactly is that supposed to prove?!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The <span style="color:#E16935">accused's fingerprints</span> were found on the scroll.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Oh, no! Where is it? It's not here! I must've dropped it somewhere...
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Indeed. You must've dropped it when you were busy murdering the victim!
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Ngh!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Notice added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(No, no, no, no, no... Then that means... ...Ahlbi was there on the day of the incident?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ha ha ha ha! So this is the power of "cross-examination"! The more the accused talks, the guiltier he paints himself.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Yes, it would seem so, Your Magistry. Heh heh heh.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Argh! He predicted my argument and had evidence ready to refute it!)</span>
</p><p>Gallery:
</p>
<center>How was any of that supposed to help the accused?<br />See?! I told you you can't trust lawyers and their lies!<br />Her Benevolence already said the kid's guilty!<br />Just declare him guilty and get it over with!</center>
<p><br />
Ahlbi:<br />
Ngh... No... Everything's going all wrong... Shah'do... What do I do?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
As I suspected, this "cross-examination" session has served no purpose whatsoever.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(No...! You're wrong!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But armed as we are with Her Benevolence's Insight, there's no reason to doubt his guilt.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Then I guess I'll just have to poke holes in this "Insight" of hers!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
By the way, this didn't prove to be "very interesting" at all, Mr. Payne. Nevertheless, I will now finally announce my verdict.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Wait just one moment, Your Magistry! I haven't seen this <span style="color:#E16935">Divination Séance</span> for myself yet. As the defense, I have the right to check it!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... Is that really necessary? I have to get home and apologize to my wife...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I guess she really did give him the business...)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Your Magistry, I enthusiastically support having Mr. Wright see the Séance.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You do? And why is that, Mr. Payne?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Don't you want to see it? See the lawyer being utterly crushed by the power of the Séance... ...and then watch him tearfully beg for mercy?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, now!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I'm sure it'll make up for not getting to go to that class with your wife.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It certainly does sound worth seeing! And it'd give me a juicy tidbit to tell the missus. Ha ha ha ha!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I've been reduced to a "juicy tidbit"...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Well, foreign interloper, I imagine you do have to see it for yourself to be convinced. It's certainly unprecedented, but let's have the Divination Séance performed again. But, then, right after the tearful begging, I really do have to be going.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The only "tearful begging" is going to come from the prosecution when we're through!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh heh. How pitiful the defense looks, still scrambling desperately for a foothold... ...blissfully unaware that defeat and despair are all that await him.

Your Benevolence, Rayfa Padma Khura'in. Thank you for coming all this way once again.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Your gratitude is unnecessary. This is simply my duty. ......Barb-headed attorney!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Y-Yes?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
I am told you question the veracity of the sacred Divination Séance. It would seem the depths of your irreverence and blasphemy are lost on you.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I'm just a foreigner, ignorant in the ways and customs of this country. I apologize in advance for anything rude I might say or do, Your Benevolence. All I want is a fair trial for Ahlbi.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
You would imply that the trials of this country are unfair? Do explain, outsider... ...how verdicts founded on truths imparted by the very souls of the dead lack impartiality.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What's fair about trials with no defense and no chance for the accused to tell their story?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
H-How dare you speak to Her Benevolence in that manner?!
</p><p>Gallery:

Silence, one and all!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Is she... standing up for me?)</span>
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Be not disquieted, my people. He merely expresses his opinion.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Well, well. Looks like "Her Benevolence" is going to be more reasonable than I thought.)</span>
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Attorneys are ghastly creatures, with souls stained black by brazen untruths. The words of a lowly worm such as that are not worth troubling yourselves over.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(All right, I take that back...)</span>
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
None of his prattling can sway the truth of my Insights. Rest assurred, he will soon see the error of his foolish ways!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now then, Your Benevolence. The <span style="color:#E16935">Divination Séance</span>, if you would.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Certainly. Nayna, my robe... O Holy Mother! We hold this <span style="color:#E16935">Divination Séance</span> in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their <span style="color:#E16935">final memories</span> in the <span style="color:#E16935">Pool of Souls</span>!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What just happened?! An image appeared in the pool!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A final message from the victim's soul, the last communication of his mitamah... The Divination Séance has revealed this to us.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Her Benevolence can use her power of Spirit Communion... ...to project a victim's memories of <span style="color:#E16935">the last few moments before their demise.</span>
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So what we saw in the pool is what Mr. Rohl actually experienced?!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
In the victim's memories, we see the accused raising a weapon up over his head. This is consistent with the findings of the police investigation.
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Th-There has to be some kind of mistake! I didn't do it!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This looks bad for Ahlbi... Really, really bad...)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh heh. Now do you see why I'm "The Incredible Payne"?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(More than I can express... But even if those are the victim's last memories, what can I do with them?)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh heh! There it is! There's the face of a man being utterly crushed! Oh, how long I've waited to see it! Isn't it wonderfully gratifying, Your Magistry?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, yes. Very satisfying, indeed! Now are you finally convinced, traveler? The accused is most assuredly guilty.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Am I really the only unbiased one here...?)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now, then, I think we've all been "amused" enough. If you give up now, I won't even invoke the <span style="color:#E16935">Defense Culpability Act</span> against you. You'd be free to slink back to your own country with your tail between your legs.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The Defense Culpability Act? What's that?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What?! You mean you honestly don't know?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I, uh... No...? <span style="color:#0070C0">(What's with all the hubbub?)</span>
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Well, well. Not only is he a lying, black-hearted lawyer, he's also an imbecile. Your Magistry, I think you'd better explain the Defense Culpability Act to him.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, I think I'd better. The Defense Culpability Act -- or "DC Act" for short -- is as follows. "In the name of Her Eminence, those who would support criminals... ...will be deemed just as <span style="color:#E16935">guilty</span>." In other words, if you help the accused by defending him and he is found guilty... ...you will receive the <span style="color:#E16935">same sentence</span> as he.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(What?! What kind of insane law is that?!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Under the DC Act, many an attorney has been convicted and met with a grim fate. Some went to prison. Others received the death penalty. That's why there are so few in our country today who admit to being an attorney.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Hmph. That's as it should be. The history of our courts proves that... ...attorneys are black-souled creatures who will tell any lie to save the accused. Thus, attorneys deserve to be exterminated!

</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh... heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha! You fell right into my trap, Phoenix Wright! Your win streak against me and my brother ends today! With the <span style="color:#E16935">Séance</span> and the <span style="color:#E16935">DC Act</span> on my side, I'll finally get my revenge!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(So that's why he was so eager to have me defend Ahlbi!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Chased out and humiliated back home, fate brought me to the foothills of Khura'in. I thank my lucky stars that I'm chief prosecutor here now! 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Defense, know that if I rule the accused guilty, you will go to prison, too. 
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(That explains Ahlbi's reaction earlier...)</span>
</p>
<hr />
<p>Ahlbi:<br />
Defend me?! Mr. Wright! What are you saying? You can't do that!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Payne:<br />
Your Magistry, isn't a prison sentence a bit lenient? After all, we're talking about treason. One should pay for such a crime with one's life. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm, yes. I believe the <span style="color:#E16935">death penalty</span> might be appropriate under these circumstances.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
TH-THE DEATH PENALTY?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(N-No way...)</span> Y-You're k-kidding, right, Your Magistry...?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ha ha ha ha! ...Do I look like I'm kidding? I'll have you put your life and your dark, tainted soul on the line here. 
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(D-Death...? This can't be happening...)</span>
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
"<span style="color:#E16935">The Courts of Resignation</span>." Our courts are well-known as thus. In this land where my Séances provide the truth and no attorneys can intervene... ...criminals know that all they can do is resign themselves to their fate. 
</p><p>Judge:<br />
O foreign lawyer, I ask you once more: Are you sure you still want to defend the accused?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />

<p>Phoenix:<br />
Wait just a moment!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Yes? What is it, Barbed Head?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You're saying the incident occurred AFTER the morning Dance of Devotion, right?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
That's right. What of it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Then isn't it strange that Mr. Rohl could still hear the Song of Ceremony?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, my! You're absolutely right!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
............Hmph. Is that all that troubles you?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Huh?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
What the victim heard was just a practice run of the Song of Ceremony.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Practice run? What are you talking about?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Mr. Payne, if you would?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Certainly! Allow me to explain. The incident occurred in the interval between the morning and afternoon Dances. During that time, the singers were practicing in the performance hall.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Precisely! I was there as well, so I can corroborate this statement.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I see. So what the victim hears was that practice session.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh. There goes my contradiction... Okay, so they were practicing in this "performance hall"... That must be the room where Ahlbi and I saw Her Benevolence dancing.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
However, Mr. Payne, I admit one detail troubles me.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Ask away, Your Magistry.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It's a big temple. The performance hall and treasure room are quite far from each other. Could the song really be heard all the way in the treasure room?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(He's right. It is a very big temple.)</span> Well? How about it, Mr. Payne?!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Your Magistry, have you forgotten? There are <span style="color:#E16935">speakers</span> in every room of Tehm'pul Temple, including the treasure room.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh, that's right!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Speakers? For what purpose?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Are you serious, Mr. Wright? They're to broadcast the sacred music of the performance hall throughout the temple.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
That's why the victim could hear the Song of Ceremony in the Séance vision. It was the practice run going on in the performance hall, heard over the speakers.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Thank you for your explanation, Your Benevolence. That makes perfect sense even to a feeble-minded old man like me.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Think nothing of it.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now if you wouldn't mind, could you please alter your Insights for us?
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Very well.

</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh, heh. Now now. Let's not be too hasty, Your Magistry. I think I can clear this up.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You have something to add, Mr. Payne?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
A thousand apologies. It seems the prosecution has failed to make one tiny thing clear.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
And that would be...?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
On the day of the incident, there was a power outage -- a <span style="color:#E16935">blackout</span> in one part of the temple. And, as I recall, the crime scene was in that sector. The power outage must be why the victim's field of vision went dark. I apologize for neglecting to tell the court this detail. I'm afraid it slipped my mind.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Or rather, you knew all along and are only letting it slip now that it's convenient, Payne!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The power outage knocked out both the lights and the speakers.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Oh! There was a blackout there, was there?! Well now... That explains everything, does it not?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-What do you men, Your Benevolence? Please share your thoughts with us, if you would.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
The blackout occurred when the accused and the victim were faced with one another. Fearing the victim would flee under the cover of darkness... ...the accused swiftly brought his weapon down on the victim's head.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I see! That makes perfect sense, Your Benevolence.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
So the victim was struck after the lights went out. The depth of your insight is awe-inspiring, Your Benevolence! Give her a hand, everyone!

</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
You never know when to stop talking, do you? I hope you realize your words are an insult to all adherents of Khura'inism.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Defense! Watch what you say! If you don't mind that tongue of yours, you won't have one left to mind!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It's certainly not my intention to insult spirit mediums. But maybe I'm not the one who needs to learn when to stop talking.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
What malarkey.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I believe you said a few moments ago... ...that the victim could hear the Song of Ceremony thanks to the temple's <span style="color:#E16935">speakers</span>. But then, how do you explain... ...how the victim could still hear the Song of Ceremony, even after the power went out!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
This contradiction of facts can only mean...  ...that the Song of Ceremony Mr. Rohl heard was NOT coming from the speakers!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
What?! Impossible!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wh-What are you saying?! That the song he heard was coming directly from the <span style="color:#E16935">performance hall</span>?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's exactly what I'm saying. It's the only possible explanation.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But the scene of the crime was nowhere near the performance hall!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Right. The song couldn't make it all the way to the <span style="color:#E16935">treasure room</span>... Not unless...
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Y-You mean to say...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes, the treasure room was NOT the actual scene of the crime. It must have been <span style="color:#E16935">somewhere else</span> -- somewhere closer to the performance hall!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Wh-Whaaaaaat?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Y-You can't be serious!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
There is a glaring contradiction in the claims of Her Benevolence and the prosecution. Therefore, the defense insists that this case be thoroughly re-examined!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
What? N-No...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Th-This is completely unprecedented! An inconsistency in Her Benevolence's Insights...? Unbelievable...
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
H-Head not his forked tongue, Your Magistry! These are but the claims of a corrupt lawyer! A feeble ruse from a feeble mind!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
B-B-But... But the contradiction revealed by the defense... is undeniable... I-I can't... We can't... We can't just turn a blind eye to it!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
B-But the defense's assertion is, in the end, meaningless! Even if the location of the murder turned out to be different... ...it doesn't change what we've seen of the moment of the murder!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
I-Indeed! The accused is standing right there in front of the victim! Furthermore, the murder weapon remains raised above his head! My Insights still stand!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I hate to admit it, but she's right. The Séance vision still makes the situation look really grim for Ahlbi.)</span>

Heh heh heh. I doubt even the defense can dream up an explanation as to why... ...the accused had his hands up over his head.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Well, this defense dares to dream! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Of making it out of this nightmare alive...)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
You what?!

You still insist on trying to tear down my Insights, do you? You'd better be prepared to back up your claim. Remember what will happen to that tongue of yours if we find you are just wagging it.

Of course I can back up my claim! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Just as soon as I think of something...)</span>

I concur, Your Magistry. Prepare the tongue shears! Chop-chop!

N-No... I can't believe it... A contradiction in one of my Insights...? There has to be some kind of mistake... I... I won't accept it...!

That's right, Your Benevolence! And I won't accept it, either! It goes against all we hold sacred! Throw him in jail immediately for lese-majesty!

<span style="color:#0070C0">(Hm...? Is he...?)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Your Magistry, please assign this black-hearted attorney a suitable punishment.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
............ No. I can't charge him with lese-majesty.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
What?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Wh-What?! But, why not, Your Magistry?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
He was simply following the proper procedure for defending the accused. There's nothing unlawful about that.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
B-But, Your Magistry... Don't you want to wrap this trial up quickly? Why not just give your verdict? Then you can go home and make it up to your wife...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
We can't end the trial now, not when we just learned new information about the case.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Wh-Whaaaaaat?!
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
Your Magistry! Not you, too! You would honestly entertain the idea that my Insight contains a contradiction?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
...Truly, it is shocking. In the twenty-plus years since the DC Act went into effect, such a thing has never occurred. To be honest... I didn't want to believe it, either. But with his life on the line, the defense pointed out an inconsistency. And it is our duty to scrutinize it to the satisfaction of the law.
</p><p>Rayfa:<br />
You dare go against the royal priestess, you... NON-BELIEVER?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
No, my faith is as strong as ever. But I have a duty to make a fair ruling in this trial. If you insist on interfering with that process, Your Benevolence... ...I'm afraid I must request your removal from this courtroom, royal priestess or not.

WHAAAT? I'll have you know--!

</p><p>Judge:<br />
Now then, defense. Mister... Light, was it...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's "Wright," Your Magistry. Phoenix Wright.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Of course. Mr. Wright. My apologies. Well, now that we have this newly uncovered fact, I suggest we proceed with arguments.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Thank you, Your Magistry.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, yes... But do not misunderstand me. This doesn't mean I trust you completely. I'll be keeping a close eye on you, so don't even think about lying to this court.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I understand, Your Magistry. <span style="color:#0070C0">(Whew! Maybe NOW we can finally run a real trial!)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh heh. Arguments, Your Magistry? Very well. I accept your challenge.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Huh? What's with him?)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Hee hee hee! Oh, the look on your face, Mr. Wright! It's just... Heh heh! It's just too hilarious!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What's so funny, Mr. Payne?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The defense still doesn't get it. The "truth" he unearthed is going to bury him and his case instead.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What do you mean by that, prosecutor?!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I told you! It's "Chief Prosecutor"!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Yes... Because that's the point to focus on right now...)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The defense is digging its own grave. Consider this, Your Magistry. Why would the victim -- a security guard -- point a gun at the accused?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Oh!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
"Oh," indeed! Because the accused was about to commit a theft. It's the only logical explanation!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Whaaaaaaaa?! <span style="color:#0070C0">(That... does sound pretty logical, actually...)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
It doesn't help the accused's situation at all! If anything, it makes him look even more guilty!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, I have to agree.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Allow me spell out this "truth" the defense didn't bother to think through. Mr. Rohl came across the accused, just as he was trying to steal the treasure. The guard pointed his gun at the accused, and, just when the power went out... ...the accused murdered the victim and hid his body in the treasure room.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Gnrk!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
A hand truck for moving heavy treasure around is stored in the treasure room. The accused could have easily moved the body with that.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(And after all that hard work to knock down those <span style="color:#E16935">Insights</span>... Ahh, backed into the ol' familiar corner once more...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mr. Wright, do you have a rebuttal?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
............ <span style="color:#0070C0">(Ugh. I'm drawing a total blank here...)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh heh. I hope you're ready to climb that scaffold...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I... Uh...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I asked you a question, defense!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(......I've got nothing. I can't think of any grounds for an objection... The only thing to do at this point is ask the defendant himself what happened. But I don't know if Ahlbi will cooperate with me or not...)</span> Ahlbi?
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Will you tell us what really happened?
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
............
</p><p>Payne:<br />
You don't have to say anything, accused. Fall for his evil trap and you'll only dirty your own soul.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Ahlbi, you have to tell me the truth! I can't help you unless you do!
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Ungh...... Nngh... Mr. Wright... I'm sorry...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why?! Why won't he trust me?! Is this it? Is this the end... for both of us...? Maya... I'm sorry...)</span>
</p>
<center>I-I never met a real <span style="color:#E16935">lawyer</span> before...</center>
<p><br />
Ahlbi:<br />
Everybody always told me they're bad, bad people who help dirty criminals go free. I never thought a lawyer would actually try to help me... would actually believe in me... Would risk his own life for me... I never would've even imagined it.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
A-Ahlbi...!
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
So... that's why I lied. To try and save myself. But I'm not going to lie anymore! If you believe in me enough to put your life on the line... then I'm going to believe in you, too!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Wh-Whaaaaat?!
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Allow me... Allow me to explaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaain!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Now we're talking! Time to finally get to the bottom of things!)</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
To be honest, I went into the treasure room lots of times to look at the treasure box.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Even though the temple told you you weren't allowed to go anywhere near it?!
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Yes. I'm sorry... Mr. Rohl even saw me once and scolded me. But that box is so beautiful! The way it glows in the dark... I couldn't help myself.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Wait. It glows in the dark?
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
That's right. It's covered in this special mineral called "<span style="color:#E16935">fluorenite</span>" that makes it glow. It's absolutely breathtaking. It's really a shame they don't put it on display for the public! Can't you imagine how many people would go on night tours if they did?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(If only he applied such passion to telling me the truth earlier...)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Treasure Box updated in the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
On the day of the incident, I was on my way to the treasure room again... ...when I ran into Mr. Rohl on the <span style="color:#E16935">great stairs</span>.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So those were not the treasure room stairs in the Séance vision...?
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
No, they were the great stairs that connect the hallway.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Makes sense. The vision wasn't clear enough to show us what was at the top of those stairs...)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Temple Diagram added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
All of a sudden, Mr. Rohl drew his gun and threatened me with it. I quickly put my hands up. Mr. Rohl... He acted so scary... For some reason, he had his scarf over his mouth. I couldn't read his expression at all. Just then, the power went out. So I took that chance to hightail it out of there! I ran for my life! Even now, when I try to think back on it... ...all I can remember are the gun and the piercing look in Mr. Rohl's eyes... That must've been when I dropped the <span style="color:#E16935">notice</span> scroll.

I have no idea why, but... ...he asked me a strange question. "Did you steal it?" he said.

I'm sorry... I'm sorry I didn't say all this before. I didn't think anybody would believe me.

And what better reason to suspect the boy than <span style="color:#E16935">seeing the treasure box in his hands</span>? In the course of his rounds, the victim must've noticed that the treasure had been stolen. And then, just after that... ...he ran into the accused, Ahlbi Ur'gaid.

<p>Phoenix:<br />
With the defendant standing in front of the victim... ...isn't it possible that the victim could've been struck from behind?

From behind, you say? Hmm... I see. Yes, I suppose it's not outside the realm of possibility.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Good. Now at least I have some breathing room.)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
But who do you suppose it could have been?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Oh, uh... The true culprit, naturally -- the one who actually committed the theft and murder!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The true culprit? And I suppose you have a true timeline of events to go along with that?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I should've known I'd have to explain everything... All right. If we assume the true culprit struck the victim from behind, then that means...)</span> After going to the treasure room and stealing the treasure, the true culprit tried to escape. But then Mr. Rohl appeared, making his rounds. I imagine the culprit then quickly hid in the storeroom at the other end of the hallway.

Heh heh heh. You're grasping at straws, Mr. Wright. Admit it. You have nothing but baseless conjecture.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I-I'm going to look for something to base it on right now! Ahlbi? When you ran into Mr. Rohl in the hallway, was there anyone around the storeroom area?

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">("Instructor"?)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Not only is Mr. Andistan'dhin Tehm'pul Temple's head monk... ...but he's also a renowned dahmalan expert.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Sorry to have to ask, but what's a "dahmalan"?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Check it! Here she is, my sweet serenader, my one and only. Groovy, right? But you heard our sultry sounds once before, brother... When dragon and tiger battle...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's the song from the <span style="color:#E16935">Dance of Devotion</span>!
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Right on, brother. The Song of Ceremony. Playing this tune together is a precious gig for me and my girl here, ya dig?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The Song of Ceremony, the song that was playing at the time of the murder...)</span>
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
O Holy Mother! May the righteous sounds of my dahmalan serve as my offering to you!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Wonderful! A great performance, as always!
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
This is my thing, ya know? My bag. I make instruments speak, baby. By the by, Magistry Pops... ...no dahmalan class today?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
No. I'm afraid this trial has gone into overtime... thanks to this lawyer over there.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The class the judge wanted to attend was a dahmalan lesson?)</span>
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Well, ya know what they say, baby. Never trust the lawyer-man! But transgressors against the Holy Mother have to be brought to justice.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Andistan'dhin. As the treasure's keeper... ...you must've been shocked to learn that it had been stolen.
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Yeah, man... That was not cool.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Keeping the treasure safe is one of your duties, Mr. Andistan'dhin?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
That's right, brother. This here's the one and only treasure box key... ...and I keep it on me at all times. Can ya dig? But the sneaky thief went and cracked open that sucker anyway... Total bummer, man.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
So that's the key to the treasure box, is it?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
You know it, baby! It's called the "<span style="color:#E16935">Magatama Key</span>," and it's a historical artifact, to boot. It's been passed down from head monk to head monk at Tehm'pul Temple.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(The <span style="color:#E16935">Magatama Key</span>, huh?)</span>
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Magatama Key added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
And now someone's jacked the treasure, on my watch... It's a real buzzkill, man... How am I ever gonna face Her Holiness again! O Holy Mother! Please find it in your infinite mercy to forgive me! Please guide this lost and humble lamb!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Why do I always get the faaaaar out ones...?)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Mr. Andistan'dhin, you witnessed the accused and the victim heading to the treasure room?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
You know it, baby! Best believe I scoped that tiny transgressor...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Would you please give the court your testimony regarding what you saw?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
To bring justice against the transgressor, man, yes, of course, I'll do all I can. In the name of Her Holiness, I vow to sing, naught but the truth, I swear to bring! Hit me!

<center><span style="color:blue">Witness Testimony</span></center>
<center><span style="color:#E16935">-- What I Saw, Baby --</span></center>
<p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
After morning Dance of Devotion, to go back to my chamber, I got the notion.<br />
Don't you know my chamber's on the way, to the temple's treasure room, hey, hey.<br />
Any small footsteps I can quite clearly hear, if anyone to the treasure room goes near.<br />
Ahlbi was the only one. Ahlbi was the only one.<br />
Before the blackout, one other than Rohl, only Ahlbi to the treasure room did stroll.
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Tell me I was hallucinating just now...)</span>
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Like, can you believe Mr. Rohl bit the big one after that? Harsh, man.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
I share your sentiments. You were the one who discovered the victim's body, weren't you, Mr. Andistan'dhin?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What? You found the body as well? <span style="color:#0070C0">(He really is a key witness, then.)</span>
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
That's right, brother. After the blackout, I went to reset the breaker and give power back to the people. The circuit box is near my chamber, so I'm always the man for the job, ya feel me?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
The breakers are in the first floor hallway, in front of the storeroom.
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
On the way, I got a whiff of something funky -- blood, man. Really harshed my mellow. I knew something wasn't kosher, so I swung by the treasure room to see what's what. And it was like, whoa, man! There was poor Mr. Rohl, dead as a doornail!
</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Temple Diagram updated in the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
In the interval between the end of the Dance of Devotion and the blackout... ...the only ones who went to the scene of the crime were the victim and the accused. So you see, Mr. Andistan'dhin's unassailable account is what led to the accused's arrest.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Hold it! Isn't it possible that the murder took place before the end of the Dance of Devotion?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh heh. I'm afraid that's not possible. The victim was in the performance hall until the very end of the dance.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
He was?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Would you like some proof? <span class="hidden"><span class="explain" style="text-decoration: underline dotted" title="Changed from &#91;How&#39;s this -- a photo, taken by a tourist, of the morning Dance of Devotion.&#93; in the original release">How's this: a photo of that morning's Dance of Devotion, taken by a tourist.</span></span><span style="display: none;"> (Changed from [How's this -- a photo, taken by a tourist, of the morning Dance of Devotion.] in the original release)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Payne's right. There's Mr. Rohl, on duty.)</span>
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh heh. Never underestimate The Incredible Payne!

</p><p><span style="color:#0070C0">Dance of Devotion Photo added to the Court Record.</span>
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
As head monk, my monks-in-training are like my own kids -- like family -- can ya dig it? I should've taught Ahlbi better, man... Before Her Holiness, the Holy Mother, O Ahlbi, confess your sins, my young brother.
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
H-Head Monk Andistan'dhin... I-I didn't kill Mr. Rohl... So I don't have anything to confess to the Holy Mother...
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
What?! ...Bogus, little man. Your faith is weak, like a wet paper bag. Are ya feeling me? Spare the rod, hey baby, Spoil the child, not maybe. Her Holiness is magnanimous, son. If you confess your guilt... ...she'll forgive you in the Twilight Realm.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(I don't suppose she could forgive him in this realm first...?)</span>

</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
You had a question for me, brother?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You were playing something during the Dance of Devotion, weren't you?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
You know it, baby. I was playing my beautiful girl here, this dahmalan. In offering to Her Holiness, I play the music, and the singers sing the Song of Ceremony.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Mr. Andistan'dhin's playing is the best in the kingdom. It must please Her Holiness greatly. Now, then. Could you continue with your testimony, Mr. Andistan'dhin?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
For the Holy Mother, I keep on truckin'! This dahmalan still needs some plucking!

How can you be so sure that nobody else was there?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Whoa, man. You lawyers are as uptight as they say.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Isn't it possible that someone else could have snuck past?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
The answer, my friend, is... squeaky wooden floorboards, baby. They make such a racket, not even the quietest cat could sneak by me, ya dig?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Yes, that makes sense. And all of that just now was simply more of the attorney's unfounded suspicions, I see.
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
That's the truth, baby. It's all that I sing. The truth is all, it's everything.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
W-Words of wisdom! Words of truth! Erm... Baby tooth, forsooth, phone booth!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Much thanks to Mr. Andistan'dhin. Let's bring an end to defense grandstandin'.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
You're not stopping me until my client goes free! <span style="color:#0070C0">(Wait a minute! Why am I singing?!)</span>

There's something off about that, Mr. Andistan'dhin.
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
My music is off? I'm sorry ya feel that way, man. Maybe this vibe ain't topping the charts where you're from. What's your poison? Orchestra? Jazz Soul?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
There's nothing wrong with my ears, witness. But something's not quite right with your eyes. Mr. Andistan'dhin, you've been lying to this court.
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Now why would I lie? I got nothing to hide. Truth and truth alone is all I sing. Lying, y'all? Now, lying ain't my thing.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I contend otherwise. Do you recognize this object, Mr. Andistan'dhin?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
It's a temple notice, man. What of it?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
In this notice, the following instruction to the temple monks is written: "...all of the hallway shutters will <span style="color:#E16935">remain shut</span> for today's Dance of Devotion."
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Whatchoo talkin' bout, Phoenix?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I'm talkin' about the fact that from your chamber... ...you couldn't have seen ANYONE going into the treasure room through those shutters!
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Gaaaaah!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Looks like you didn't get the memo.
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
...No way! I don't believe it, man!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
If you don't believe it, why don't you read the notice for yourself?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Umm... Let's see... Something, something, "will," something, "for," something, something...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Is that your idea of "reading"?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
I'm not so hot at reading Khura'inese, man. I usually get one of the other monks to read stuff for me, ya know?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Doesn't that make your duties as head monk a little difficult?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Hey, cut me some slack, man! I only moved to this country six months ago.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's quite recent, isn't it? So... how did someone who's only been here six months become head monk of a temple?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
How little you understand. Religious faith can't be measured in months or years. I've only been an adherent of Khura'inism for three months, myself. The Holy Mother's teachings really spoke to me, prompting me to stay in this country.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(...Or was it the fact that there are no lawyers here that spoke to you, hm?)</span>
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Mr. Payne, I know just how you feel, my man. Her Holiness's teachings spoke to me, too.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Ladies and gentlemen, I present: Brother Dumb and Brother Dumber... Well, I know why Payne suddenly became a believer in Khura'inism... ...but could Andistan'dhin have had an ulterior motive for becoming a believer, too?)</span> Mr. Andistan'dhin. Were you really in your chamber as you claim?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Wh-What? Hey, be chill, brother...

M-Mr. Wright, what kind of nonsense are you spouting now?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
According to Mr. Andistan'dhin's testimony, he saw Ahlbi with his own eyes. Therefore, is it really "nonsense" to suggest he could've seen Ahlbi from somewhere else?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
W-Well...
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Do you have a theory, defense? Do you know where Mr. Andistan'dhin was, if not in his chamber?

WH-WHAT?!

Y-Y-You can't possibly be serious!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Does this mean you're claiming that Mr. Andistan'dhin's oath of faith... ...is nothing but a <span style="color:#E16935">lie</span> designed to get him close to the treasure?!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
If the victim was the thief, everything we've learned so far would all make sense. And it would give us <span style="color:#E16935">a completely new way</span> to interpret the victim's actions! After the morning Dance of Devotion, Mr. Rohl went to the treasure room. He grabbed the box that contained the treasure and started to take off with it. But then he ran into Ahlbi on the great stairs. That's why Mr. Rohl pulled his gun on Ahlbi. Then, when the blackout occurred... ...Mr. Rohl was bludgeoned to death in the darkness. This explains why the victim would be holding the glowing treasure box in the dark. And how it would've been possible for someone other than the accused to kill him!

Mr. Payne, take a good look at the victim's hand. See this? That's blood.

What...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
If we place Mr. Rohl's hand inside the bloody outline...

I can hardly believe it. Apparently, not everything out of the defense's mouth is a bluff.

Of course not, Your Magistry. This tongue doesn't lie. And I'd like to continue to use my tongue in the future, too, if you wouldn't mind. <span style="color:#0070C0">(He never has to know it really WAS a bluff...)</span>

If the victim was holding the treasure box, it couldn't have been the murder weapon. Which means the real murder weapon must've been something else.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The real murder weapon...?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
...Was something else...?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
The blood was thought to have gotten on the box when the box was used as a weapon. But it turns out that wasn't the case. The blood splattered onto the treasure box the victim was holding... ...when he was struck with the real weapon. THAT'S what really happened! Isn't that right, Mr. Andistan'dhin?!
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
............ Are you insinuating I'm the one who used this "real weapon"?!

Are you saying I'm wrong in my "Andistan'dhin"?

Ha ha ha ha ha ha! You got me riled up, lawyer-man! I feel a song comin' on! Looking for a weapon that just don't exist. Pathetic lawyer-man, drop into the abyss! Despicable lawyer-man, yo you make me sick! You can disappear, just like a magic trick! Worthless lawyer-man, done in by a weapon. For you, miserable wretch, hell doth beckon! Yeaaah!

I know, You're Magistry.

Yet you're prepared to risk it on this mere idea of a "<span style="color:#E16935">real murder weapon</span>"?

<span style="color:#0070C0">(This is it! The moment of truth... I can't back down! Not now!)</span> Yes, Your Magistry, I am. I'm confident the <span style="color:#E16935">real murder weapon</span> does indeed exist!

</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Nnnrgh... <span style="color:#0070C0">(Now there's no proof to show...!)</span>
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Oh, come on! That was pathetic. Your agony can sound better than that! Where's that great scream of yours?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This... This can't be how it ends!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I think I've heard enough. It seems the defense is unable to produce the evidence it needs to prove its assertion.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
B-But, Your Magistry! That's only because the witness destroyed it!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
"Evidence is everything in court." Don't tell me you've forgotten this most fundamental principle of our profession?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Without sufficient proof... ...your claim that Mr. Andistan'dhin is the murderer is no more than conjecture.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Aaaaaarrrgghh!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Heh heh heh. There's the pained expression I've been looking for. By the way, there seems to be one more thing you're forgetting.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
What is it now?
</p><p>Payne:<br />
You accused Mr. Andistan'dhin of being the thief. But the real thief turned out to be the victim.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Uh-oh...
</p><p>Payne:<br />
And, with that, Mr. Andistan'dhin's purported motive for murder goes out the window.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Great point, Prosecutor! You tell 'im! If I had been there, I would've just collared Rohl and gotten the treasure back. There wasn't any reason for me to kill him, now, was there?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I-- <span style="color:#0070C0">(There's no good counterargument to that...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
It sounds to me like Mr. Andistan'dhin has been completely wrongfully accused. Unfortunate as it may be, I think it's time to hand down the verdict in this case.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Not good! Not good!)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Defense, I trust you understand what you yourself will receive for taking on this case.

</p><p>Payne:<br />
Mr. Wright, you've wasted this court's time and disparaged everything we hold sacred. We should charge you with lese-majesty, in addition to the crime of abetting the accused.
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
......Yeah. You should pay for desecrating my good name! Buh-bye, lawyer-man. Time for you to do some repentin'... in the Twilight Realm!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(This guy is guilty as sin. I just know it! He must've had SOME reason to kill Mr. Rohl... but what?)</span>

Don't tell me you're going to start begging for your life now?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
No, You're Magistry. That's not it. It's just that I realized something more important. We've been operating under a serious misconception this whole time.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
A misconception, you say?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
That's right. A mistaken notion about the treasure box. <span style="color:#0070C0">(But could this really be true? If so, there's still a lot to figure out...)</span>
</p><p>Judge:<br />
............ Very well. Let's hear what you have to say.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Thank you, Your Magistry!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Your Magistry! This is just more of his nonsense! He's just stalling for time.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
This is your last chance, defense. The second I find it really IS nothing but nonsense... ...no amount of begging will stay my hand. Understand?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes, Your Magistry.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Hmph...! We all know this is just going to be another one of your stupid bluffs...!

<p>Ahlbi:<br />
"Did you steal it?" he said.

Not at all, Your Magistry. Not once you realize that... ...by the time Mr. Rohl got to the treasure room... the treasure box was already empty.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I-I beg your pardon?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Mr. Rohl suspected that Ahlbi had gotten to it first... ...which is why he confronted Ahlbi when he ran into to the boy on the stairs.

Once a year, the victim had the duty of carrying the treasure box to the palace.

<hr />
<p>Ahlbi:<br />
He was so proud when he was put in charge of guarding the treasure box! He even got to carry the box to the palace for the New Year's rite!
</p>
<hr />
<p>Phoenix:<br />
He would've been able to tell by the weight when he lifted it that the box was empty!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Ah, I see! I suppose he would've been able to tell, wouldn't he!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Mr. Rohl most likely decided to at least steal the empty box. It's an important historical artifact in and of itself, after all.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Gah... But what's your point, Mr. Wright? What does any of this have to do with Mr. Andistan'dhin?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
My point is this. It gave Mr. Andistan'dhin a motive to murder the victim.
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
A motive?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Mr. Andistan'dhin, keeping the treasure safe is one of your duties, isn't it? So if anyone had found out that the treasure was missing... ...you would've been accused of <span style="color:#E16935">incompetence</span>.
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
............
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
From the moment Mr. Rohl discovered that the treasure was gone, his fate was sealed. Because you decided then that he had to be silenced forever!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
But that's absurd!
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Can ya believe the stuff that comes outta this guy's mouth?! This is all just a colossal joke!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
So then, what really happened to the treasure?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
It had been stolen long before this incident occurred... ...by Mr. Pees'lubn Andistan'dhin himself!
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
............
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Mr. Wright, will you stop at nothing to accuse Mr. Andistan'dhin?! Your Magistry, please don't listen to these trumped-up charges. The defense is grasping!

All right. We've now heard from both sides. Either the treasure box was forced open by the accused, as the witness claims... ...or, Mr. Andistan'dhin opened it... ...as the defense claims. Defense. This is your last chance to cross-examine the witness.

Yes, yes... You told me...
</p><p>Payne:<br />
There's just no reasoning with this man. The accused forced the lock open. There's no other explanation.
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
That's right! He desecrated the box by opening it without using this Mitamah Key!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Wait. What did he just say?)</span>
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
I'll sing it as many times as I have to, to get it through your thick lawyer skull! Only the Mitamah Key unlocks the treasure. Force it, and reap the founder's displeasure! Yeaaaaaaah!

For the forgetful defense's sake, could you please add that to your testimony?

<p>Phoenix:<br />
Just a minute, Mr. Andistan'dhin. You just called your key the "<span style="color:#E16935">Mitamah Key</span>," didn't you?
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Ah!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
But didn't you originally say it's called the "<span style="color:#E16935">Magatama Key</span>"?!
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Gaaaaagh!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
The <span style="color:#E16935">Mitamah Key</span>? What's that?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
I don't know, Your Magistry. But, apparently, it's a rather crucial question.
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Wh-What? What's the big deal? S-So I said the wrong thing. So what? Simple slip of the tongue!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
An "A" for effort, Mr. Wright, but your grandstanding betrays your desperation. I'm afraid a small slip of the tongue like that adds absolutely nothing to your argument.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
What say you, defense? Is it an important detail?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(Judging by Andistan'dhin's reaction... ...I'd say it's everything my argument needs!)</span> Yes, Your Magistry. It's very important. This key is apparently not the "Magatama Key," but rather, the "<span style="color:#E16935">Mitamah Key</span>." And I believe this discrepancy holds great significance for the defense!
</p><p>Andistan'dhin:<br />
Naw, man. Just a meaningless mistake. Insignificant! Hmph. You're riding the crazy train to nowhere, lawyer-man!
</p><p>Payne:<br />
Your Magistry, please don't pay the defense any heed. It's all nonsense.
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Hmm... To tell the truth, I'm not really clear on what the defense is driving at myself. However... I am eager to find out.
</p><p>Payne:<br />
What?!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
Defense, you will explain yourself like your life literally depends on it... because it does. Now, then. Is the name of the key an important detail?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yes, it's an absolutely important detail! <span style="color:#0070C0">(...I think.)</span> Because the Mitamah Key is connected to the Founder's Orb!
</p><p>Judge:<br />
I see. Very well. In that case... ...please show the court the grounds on which you are basing this claim.
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Th-The grounds, Your Magistry...?
</p><p>Judge:<br />
You can of course show grounds, can you not, defense?
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
O-Of course! <span style="color:#0070C0">(What else can I say? Nngh... I have to come up with something! Anything! Even if it's just a bluff... The Mitamah Key... "Mitamah"... Hmm... There has to be something somewhere that ties "mitamah" and the orb together...)</span>

What's that? The <span style="color:#E16935">Song of Ceremony</span>...?!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
<span style="color:#0070C0">(All this time... The answer was right there in front of me! It's right there in the Song of Ceremony performed during the Dance of Devotion!)</span> Your Magistry! The Song of Ceremony tells of the treasure of the founder of Khura'inism.

The Song of Ceremony contains the following lyrics: "When the butterfly embraces the <span style="color:#E16935">mitamah</span> The favor of the orb is bestowed." I believe the "mitamah" here refers to the "Mitamah Key."
</p><p>Judge:<br />
W-Well, yes, it is the same word, but that doesn't mean...
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
We've been calling this key the "<span style="color:#E16935">Magatama Key</span>." And that's why I inserted the key into the lock with the magatama design on it. But that was obviously not the right way to use it.

What?!

</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
Yeah, well, no use worrying about it. We have more important things to think about. Such as when can we continue the sightseeing tour?
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
Tour?! Ooh, anytime, sir! We still have plenty of time until Miss Maya's training ends! And there are still lots more temples to see, and all kinds of local foods to eat! I can show you the natural beauty of the area, and the waterfalls used for training! And I haven't shown you the breathtaking mountain view from the Plaza of Devotion yet! And there's this place where they dangle you off a really steep cliff that offers your soul a great view of the Twilight Realm! And walking on a bed of nails doubles as a foot massage!
</p><p>Phoenix:<br />
All right! All right! Slow down, Ahlbi! There's plenty of time!
</p><p>Ahlbi:<br />
And when we're done with all that, we can go see Miss Maya together!

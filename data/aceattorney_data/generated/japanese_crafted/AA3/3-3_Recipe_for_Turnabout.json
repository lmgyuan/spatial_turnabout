I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh? But he was there when I took the coffee over, sir. Scout's honor!???:\nMaggey!Byrde:\nAck! D-Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nA-Are you doing alright!? How're you feeling!?Byrde:\n...As if you need to ask either question, sir.Gumshoe:\nDon't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK?Byrde:\nRoger!Gumshoe:\nAnd you!Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Gumshoe:\nYou'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!Phoenix:\n(I-I think he's serious!)Maya:\nHey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?Gumshoe:\nYup.Maya:\nSo you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?Byrde:\nReally? Can you, sir!?Gumshoe:\nO... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?Phoenix:\nS-Sure.Gumshoe:\nOK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?Byrde:\nI can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you.Maya:\nLooks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?Phoenix:\n(I can only wish...)January 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\n... Aaah, bitter!Judge:\nMr... Um... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAaaah!Phoenix:\nWh-What's wrong!?Judge:\nNothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating.Phoenix:\nNo, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.Judge:\nI see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?Phoenix:\n(\"Our trusty\"...?)Judge:\nSo, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.Godot:\nMr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.Phoenix:\nBut I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!Godot:\nI wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.Phoenix:\n(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!)Judge:\nAs everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.Phoenix:\n(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)Judge:\nNow then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.Godot:\nLet's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?Gumshoe:\n...Judge:\nWitness! State your name for the court!Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.Godot:\nOther way around, Detective.Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!Judge:\nSince yesterday?Gumshoe:\nYeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.Maya:\nI hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.Judge:\nI see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?Gumshoe:\nY-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.Judge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\nUm... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.Judge:\nThe waitress being the accused?Gumshoe:\nYeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.Judge:\nHmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.Trés Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Godot:\nCome, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.Judge:\nNow then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.Gumshoe:\nUmm... Yes, sir...Witness Testimony-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Judge:\nHmm...Godot:\nUsing the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!Judge:\nThe facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...Phoenix:\nYes?Judge:\nPlease, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?Phoenix:\nI already told you! That wasn't me!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's what she said. And I--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWhat killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction?\nPhoenix:\nHey!\nGodot:\nSadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way.\nGodot:\nHa...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Trés Bien, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nI have here in my possession a ticket.\nPhoenix:\nA ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.)\nGodot:\nYes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen.\nJudge:\nThis is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct?\nGodot:\nI think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table?\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nIt certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh?

He had a portable radio in his chest pocket.\nMaya:\nMaggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\".\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone.

How should I know?\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.)\nMaya:\nThis isn't going very well, is it...?\nJudge:\nHmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee?\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!?\nGumshoe:\nOh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nIn case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? For me?\nGodot:\n\"Oh, hey! You're right!\"?

Wh-What piece was it again?\nGodot:\nThis!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup.\nGodot:\nYes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim.\nJudge:\nOh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it.\nGodot:\nConclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this!\nPhoenix:\nUuuurgh!\nGumshoe:\nFor the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's.\nCoffee Cup added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nUpon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance...\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.Gumshoe:\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide.

Eat too much, and you're history.\nMaya:\nHow much is too much?\nGodot:\nA lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off.\nMaya:\n0.2 grams? How much is that?\nGumshoe:\nYou know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much.\nPhoenix:\n(Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere.Gumshoe:\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I don't get it.\nGodot:\nI'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.\nGumshoe:\n*gulp*\nGodot:\nSo stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive?\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nShe was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.\nPhoenix:\nI knew it...

The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.Godot:\nI like an old man who knows the score.Judge:\nThere is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!Godot:\nI don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.Maya:\nNot good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.Phoenix:\nYeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.Godot:\nI'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.Phoenix:\n(He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)Godot:\nThis is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.Maya:\nWow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...Phoenix:\nTh-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?)Godot:\nHa...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.Phoenix:\nThe coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...Godot:\nOf course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.Judge:\nSomething else? I presume you mean...Godot:\nOf course. I'm referring to the pocket.Phoenix:\nThe... pocket?Godot:\nA search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!Phoenix:\nA bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?Gumshoe:\nYeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.Phoenix:\nWHAAAT!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.Apron added to the Court Record.Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThere's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?Godot:\nBloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?Judge:\nDon't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!Godot:\nThat's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix:\n(You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)Godot:\nWell, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?Gumshoe:\nN-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.Phoenix:\nKetchup!?Gumshoe:\nShe must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.Judge:\n... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!Godot:\nPull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!Gumshoe:\nUnnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.Judge:\nHmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nThe motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.Godot:\nWell, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.Phoenix:\n(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)Judge:\nWitness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.Witness Testimony-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Judge:\nHmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.Godot:\nLast chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nDon't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nThere's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...)\nGumshoe:\nOfficers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds...\nJudge:\nHmm... Seeds...\nGodot:\nHa...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...)\nGodot:\nThe old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime.Gumshoe:\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow long was the defendant unconscious for?\nGumshoe:\nThe officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself.\nPhoenix:\n(I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...)\nGumshoe:\nI woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful.\nPhoenix:\n(You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!)\nGodot:\nSave the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation.\nGumshoe:\nOops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I?Gumshoe:\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then?\nGumshoe:\nNo, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet.\nPhoenix:\nFifty-eight cents...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah.

D-Did I say something dumb again!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, basically.\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly?\nGumshoe:\n... Oh... That.\nPhoenix:\n(He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...)\nGumshoe:\nThere was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket.\nGodot:\nIt seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Trés Bien.\nGumshoe:\nWe got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the prescription bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo what sort of medicine was in the bag?\nGumshoe:\nWell... Actually, the bag we found was empty.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Completely empty.\nPhoenix:\n(It was completely empty...?)\nVictim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nHa...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence?

Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him!\nJudge:\nOh! That is very true!\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen!\nGodot:\nHa...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nJudge:\nHmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man.\nGodot:\nOr some kind of outlaw...

That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...)\nJudge:\nIt appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness.Gumshoe:\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for.\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nInteresting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day?\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(And they're just going to let him get away with it...?)\nJudge:\nIt was just one dollar, Detective.\nMaya:\nI guess no one cares when it's that little...

I caught each one with my teeth.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...)\nGodot:\nThe old man was only other customer in the place at the time.

Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later?Gumshoe:\nUm, no. They didn't.Phoenix:\nThe victim was given a prescription right before going to Trés Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!?Gumshoe:\nY-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!Judge:\nI-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!?Gumshoe:\nI, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?Phoenix:\nThe victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that?Godot:\nHa...! That's all.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Godot:\nRead for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will.Phoenix:\nWhat's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological?Judge:\nJust what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot?Godot:\nHardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say.Judge:\nA war wound?Godot:\nThe day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum.Phoenix:\nHe ruptured his eardrum!?Judge:\nThen what on earth was the prescription he was given?Godot:\nIt was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Godot:\nIt's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear.Judge:\nYes. Here it is. In very, very fine print.Godot:\nIt seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication.Phoenix:\nUuurgh...Judge:\nIt seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all.Phoenix:\nN-No...Maya:\nNick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!Phoenix:\n(She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection.

Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time.\nJudge:\nIndeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Umm...!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground!\nJudge:\nNow then...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!?\nPhoenix:\n(Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.)\nLeads to:\n\"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"Phoenix:\nOnly moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!?Godot:\n...!Judge:\nBut the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThat doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth!Godot:Godot:\nYou know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nIt hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable!Godot:\nAaargh!Judge:\nThat's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call?Godot:\n...Judge:\nMr. Godot...?Godot:\n...Gumshoe:\nUm... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder.Phoenix:\n(Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?)Judge:\nVery well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me.Maya:\nYay! Good job, Nick!Judge:\nThe court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness.Godot:\nHa...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups.Judge:\nCourt is adjourned for recess!January 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Maya:\nPhew! That was close!Phoenix:\nTell me about it... I nearly died in there!Byrde:\nThat's my line, sir!Maya:\nNo! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit.Byrde:\nLooks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!?Maya:\nHuh?Byrde:\nHe said he'd help me. But he totally set me up!Phoenix:\nI don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right?Byrde:\nIt's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again!Phoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)Maya:\nSo the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right?Phoenix:\nYeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds!Byrde:\nI bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know?Maya:\nYeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick?Phoenix:\nYeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds!January 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please.Godot:\nThe prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand.Godot:\nName and occupation, if you don't mind.Kudo:\nThe name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too.Phoenix:\nWe don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation.Kudo:\nMy occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!?Phoenix:\nKimono embroidery?Kudo:\nThat's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed!Maya:\nWow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.Kudo:\nAnyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile!Phoenix:\n(That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...)Judge:\nNow then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident?Kudo:\nOh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino.Judge:\nSeeds?Kudo:\nWhat do you think these are, hmm!?Judge:\nI-I see...Godot:\nSo you saw everything that happened, gramps?Kudo:\nDid I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all!Godot:\nThen please, tell the court. We're all ears.Kudo:\nSure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail!Phoenix:\n(He's really getting into this...)Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Kudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nMr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress.Kudo:\nKah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!?Judge:\nN-Newfangled?Kudo:\nAll this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you!Judge:\nE-Excuse me...Kudo:\nListen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away!Judge:\nWell, um...

You saw Mr. Glen Elg?\nKudo:\nI wanted to know if Gusten Brawn retained his championship or not.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was looking at the sports paper the victim was reading, huh...) And at the location in question... ...there are partitions between tables on the same side of the restaurant, right?\nKudo:\nSo what if there are?\nPhoenix:\nIf you say that you could see the victim... ...that means you were sitting at a table on the other side of the restaurant, correct?\nKudo:\nKah!

Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms?\nGodot:\nHa...! A bottle like this, perhaps?\nKudo:\nOh, there it is! That's the one!\nJudge:\nThat's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume?\nGodot:\nSo what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nArgh...Kudo:\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe took just one sip?\nKudo:\nYou young'uns! You waste everything! Those javaccinos cost 8 dollars! In the good old days, we would have drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died!\nPhoenix:\n(Congratulations. You have earned the title of Battiest Man To Grace A Courtroom.)\nGodot:\nSo it was an immediate death? Well, with potassium cyanide, I suppose that is possible.\nKudo:\nOh, yes. He slumped over without so much as a twitch! I felt the javaccino I'd just drank turn sour in my stomach.\nGodot:\nOh, yes. I know that feeling.\nJudge:\nAnd the waitress? I presume she is...?Kudo:\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair.

She's practically naked in that uniform!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image.\nMaya:\nDon't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together!\nPhoenix:\n(I-I guess I got a bit carried away...)\nKudo:\nKah! There are other things I recognize about her, too.\nPhoenix:\n(He seems pretty sure of himself.

But what matters is whether that waitress was Maggey Byrde or not.\nJudge:\nQuite right. Mr. Kudo. These other \"features\" that you recognize about the defendant... I would ask you to add them to your testimony.\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nAdds statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\"Press (after adding statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress...

He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face.\nKudo:\nThat's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red!\nGodot:\nSo you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do?

We don't need to embarrass the witness.\nKudo:\nListen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish!\nJudge:\nHmm...

And make it strapless.\nKudo:\n*grumble grumble*\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the waitress's back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back.\nKudo:\nSo what?\nPhoenix:\nIs it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! He's got you there, gramps!\nPhoenix:\nPeople normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons!\nKudo:\nTh-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony.\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nMaya:\nThe old man's testimony is getting longer and longer!\nPhoenix:\nAnd if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet.\nAdds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\"Press (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou do seem to remember several details about her appearance.

I remember that well.\nThen the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.\nThe little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.Judge:\nThe testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is.

What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook!Godot:\nSorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee.Kudo:\nWhat have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the javaccino you want if you come to my house after the trial. (Changed from [I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial.] in the original release) I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man!Judge:\nThat's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony.Kudo:\nYou bet! Much, much quicker!Maya:\nI can't believe this is happening...Kudo:\nHa ha ha! You better get ready, youngster!Phoenix:\nI get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!?

I'm not too sure of myself.\nThe young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino...\nWell, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over.\nIt broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!\nWell!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?Judge:\n... Um... Is that all?Kudo:\nYes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!?Judge:\nN-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo.Maya:\nDon't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick?Phoenix:\nYeah. \"So what?\" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy!Kudo:\nYou're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of!Judge:\nVery well... Mr. Wright. Your final cross-examination, please.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Final Showdown --Kudo:\nFirst of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... The court generally prefers if witnesses are sure of themselves, Mr. Kudo.\nKudo:\nNoisy brat! I'm warning you, I'm more savage than a macho man right now! You won't beat me with this testimony! This is the final battle!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow! (He's chucking those seeds harder than ever! I better be careful...)\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! Nail him!Kudo:\nThe young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe court has already heard that testimony, Mr. Kudo...\nKudo:\nI know that! I was just setting the mood. How else am I supposed to build up the suspense, hmm!?\nPhoenix:\nThe suspense?\nKudo:\nIsn't it enough? Should I work the audience a bit more?\nJudge:\nNo, no! Please continue, Mr. Kudo. As quickly as possible!\nKudo:\nAlright. Now where was I...? ...Ah yes. The young boy slumped over the table, and...Kudo:\nWell, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA vase, you say?\nKudo:\nYes. There are vases on all the tables in that place. They're accidents waiting to happen! They're practically begging to be knocked over!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, he's right about there being vases. I do remember seeing them, too... There was a vase on the table when I ate munch there.) And you saw the moment when the victim actually knocked over the vase?\nKudo:\nWell... it's hard to say... It's a bit unclear... How do you really define...\nPhoenix:\nOK, I get it.\nKudo:\nI heard it break! And the sight of it is burned into my memory as clear as day!Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\"Kudo:\nIt broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSoaked in water, you mean?\nKudo:\nYes. It splashed me on the knee as well.\nPhoenix:\nYou said you were sitting at a table across the room from the victim, correct? And yet, the water still managed to splash onto you?\nKudo:\n... It was cold! I clearly remember it splashing me!\nPhoenix:\n(Could the water really make it all the way across to the other side of the room...?)Present Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\"Kudo:\nWell!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean, the vase on the victim's table falling upside-down and breaking?\nKudo:\nThe vase turned upside-down, and my testimony's turning this case upside-down... It's a joke! I just wanted everyone to hear it! What do you think, Captain!?\nGodot:\n...I'm impressed. By your ability to waste time.\nPhoenix:\n(Godot hasn't raised any objections for a while now...)\nKudo:\nSo, you young show-off! With that scrap of information, I'm throwing down the gauntlet! If I lose this one, I'll take it like a man and admit defeat!Phoenix:\nHe's really giving you the evil eye, Maya.Maya:\nIt's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, \"I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!\"Phoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to rise to the challenge then...",

Yesterday's session didn't go so well, and then ended on a giant mystery.Phoenix:\n(That's true... And we still haven't solved a single part of it yet...)Maya:\nAre you OK, Nick?Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, uh... Yeah. Of course.Byrde:\nI saw that! That little flash of doubt in your eyes!Phoenix:\nN-No! That wasn't doubt. That was, umm... determination!Byrde:\nWhy don't I believe you...?Maya:\nIt's nearly time, Maggey. You'd better get going to the defendant's seat.Byrde:\nRoger. Don't let me down, Mr. Wright. I'm counting on you!Hey, pal!Phoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe...Gumshoe:\nQuit stressing Maggey out! She doesn't need that!Phoenix:\nH-How did you know she was stressed...?Gumshoe:\nI was watching through the doorway.Phoenix:\nOh...Gumshoe:\nYou look like you lost the case already. Show a bit of confidence, will you, pal!? Here, maybe this'll help.Maya:\nHuh!? Have you taken up aromatherapy, too?Gumshoe:\nNot in a million years, pal! Don't tell me that you don't remember this thing?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Come to think of it, that doesn't look like one of those aromatherapy bottles...)Gumshoe:\nThis is the small bottle that turned up in Trés Bien's kitchen a couple of days ago.Maya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!Phoenix:\nOh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...Maya:\nHey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.Phoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.Maya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn't smell.Gumshoe:\nWe finally got the analysis results back from the lab.Maya:\nSo!? What is it? Is it the poison?Gumshoe:\nI'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.Maya:\nMedication?Gumshoe:\nYeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.Phoenix:\nFor ears? You mean...?Gumshoe:\nYeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!Phoenix:\n(What was Glen Elg's ear medicine doing in the kitchen...?)Small Bottle refiled into the Court Record.Phoenix:\nUm, what about the unidentified fingerprints? Anything on that?Gumshoe:\nSomeone screwed up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... That's going to weaken its impact as a piece of evidence...)Gumshoe:\nOK, pal! This is it! Make sure your defense is impregnable today, got it!?Phoenix:\n(Today's trial... I'm gonna expose that guy for what he's done, or my name isn't Phoenix Wright!)January 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\nReady and waiting as always, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery good. Then we'll get underway at once. Yesterday we heard the testimony of Mr. Victor Kudo. He claims to have witnessed the defendant putting a powder into the victim's coffee. However, the witness's testimony was plagued with a number of problems.Godot:\nThe mark on the rim of the cup shows that the victim drank from it with his right hand. But according to the old man's testimony, he picked it up with his left hand.Judge:\nThank you, Mr. Godot. Furthermore, according to the witness's account... ...the victim was listening to the radio with an earpiece in his left ear. Yet, the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, which made him effectively deaf in that ear.Maya:\nIt's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?Godot:\nHa...! Allow me to enlighten you, Your Honor. The world, you see, keeps turning, and we must turn with it.Judge:\n... You've lost me already, Mr. Godot.Godot:\nDon't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today. Only losers think like that. You've got to change with the times! That's one of my rules!Judge:\nAre you implying that you've resolved these contradictions? You know the answers to these riddles!?Godot:\nThe old guy wasn't just throwing seed in here. He was throwing us off the scent. And today I'll prove it.Judge:\nVery well. Let the first witness take the stand!Godot:\nAnd you are?Armstrong:\nOh bonjour, everyone! I am Jean Armstrong. z'e owner and 'ead chef of la Trés Bien restaurant. Enchanté!.........Judge:\nForgive me for asking, witness, but... are you a woman?Armstrong:\nOh là là, monsieur! As you can see, I am la pert and perky gentleman, non?Judge:\nEr... Umm...Godot:\nOn the day of the incident, you were in Trés Bien's kitchen. Isn't that right?Armstrong:\nW'iz you monsieur...Godot:\n...?Armstrong:\n...everything feels right!Godot:\nHa...!Phoenix:\n(Wow, he's totally unfazed! Doesn't anything intimidate this guy...?)Judge:\nVery well. Your testimony please, witness. Please tell the court what happened that day at Trés Bien.Armstrong:\nOui! Volontiers!Witness Testimony-- At Trés Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Phoenix:\nA m...m...m... MIRROR!?Armstrong:\nOui! Un grand mirror! La most enormous mirror!Godot:\nAnd suddenly, the mystery disappears! Like I said, the world keeps turning, so roll with it!Judge:\nHmm... That would explain the coffee cup and the earpiece conundrum... The mirror would have made everything appear back to front.Phoenix:\n(What the heck!? It's way too early in the morning for this to be happening to me!)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- At Trés Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd who were the two customers, exactly?\nArmstrong:\nMais, of course. La young man who died... ...and la other, not-so-young, man.\nJudge:\nHmm... You are referring to yesterday's witness, I presume?\nPhoenix:\n(What about the other man Maggey says she saw at the table? Something tells me Mr. Armstrong isn't planning to disclose his existence...)\nMaya:\nWe need some hard evidence first before we can bring him up, don't we...?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to try a different approach for the time being.Armstrong:\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were experimenting with art deco? How come I never heard about that before today?\nArmstrong:\nYou are not familiar w'iz z'e language of interior design, monsieur?\nPhoenix:\nPlease stay on topic! Now, why didn't you tell the court about this before!?\nArmstrong:\nBut I did. Just a few moments ago!\nJudge:\nAhem! Excuse me, Mr. Armstrong. This \"deco\" you mentioned... Are you referring to some sort of \"decocture\"?\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! Art deco, it is a style of design! ...Your Honor. He's talking about interior design. Walls, ceilings, carpets, that kind of thing.\nJudge:\nAh, yes. Of course. That \"deco\".\nArmstrong:\nI was trying to achieve a more \"la effeminate\" look for my restaurant. I was planning z'e most bold remodeling of la decor.Armstrong:\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow big of a mirror are we talking about here?\nArmstrong:\nBof! Something about 4 meters wide and, err... Oui. About 2 meters 'igh.\nPhoenix:\n(Let's see... If 1 meter is about 1 yard... Holy glass in a frame, that's huge!)\nArmstrong:\nI was intending to install it on la ceiling eventually.\nPhoenix:\nThe ceiling!? (Was there a mirror on the ceiling!? I don't remember...)\nArmstrong:\nMais, non. But I decided not to go through w'iz it in z'e end.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I ask him more about the mirror or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He couldn't lie about such a huge object like that. It must've been there in the restaurant somewhere.)\nGodot:\n...\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you really had such a large mirror in the restaurant, someone would have noticed it! But there's nothing about a mirror in Mr. Kudo or Maggey Byrde's testimonies!\nArmstrong:\nB-But...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou didn't ask, Trite. You have only yourself to blame for such sloppy work.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nA mirror was delivered to Trés Bien the day before the incident.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?\nGodot:\nAs Mr. Armstrong testified, he was carrying out some design changes. And as it turned out, he didn't actually use the mirror in the end.\nPhoenix:\n(This just doesn't add up. Even if a mirror was delivered to Trés Bien... ...it doesn't prove that it was in the restaurant on the day of the crime.)\nGodot:\nHa...! If you want to doubt someone, Trite, look in the mirror. I'm sure the person looking back at you will be dubious enough!\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\nJudge:\nHmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...Armstrong:\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNormally, I'd expect people to know the difference between a reflection and a real object.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\n\"Normally\"? How does normality come into this? That's lame, Trite. Even for you.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nAre you trying to say that if something isn't normal, it isn't possible? Is that it? Where does that leave the porcu-headed lawyer and the topknot chick over there... and the ungodly cool guy with the mask over here? Well, Trite!?\nPhoenix:\nAaack! Not the hair!\nMaya:\nI do not have a topknot!\nJudge:\nMr. Godot is correct. A lack of normality is no basis for discounting an argument.\nArmstrong:\nBien!

We should take a sec and think about what Old Seedy said in his testimony...\nPhoenix:\n(How did he phrase it again...?)\n\n\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\n\n\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!\n\n\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\n\n\nMaya:\nIf he saw everything he described reflected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the \"left\" was actually on the \"right\", huh.\nPhoenix:\n(And that clears up all the problems with his testimony, I guess... Or does it...?)\nGodot:\nHa...!Present Glen Elg profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD...\"Phoenix:\n(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?Phoenix:\nIf he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.Maya:\nBut that just makes the situation worse for Maggey!

His left hand!\n\n\nMaya:\nIf he saw everything he described reflected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the \"left\" was actually on the \"right\", huh.\nPhoenix:\n(And that clears up all the problems with his testimony, I guess... Or does it...?)\nGodot:\nHa...!Present Glen Elg profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD...\"Phoenix:\n(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?Phoenix:\nIf he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.Maya:\nBut that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!Phoenix:\nThe coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD... Let's think back over Mr. Kudo's testimony for a second, shall we?Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.Kudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!Phoenix:\nSo, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's left side. Now, if Mr. Kudo saw all that as a reflection in a mirror... ...it means both the HMD and the earpiece were actually on the victim's right side.Armstrong:\nExactement! You see, monsieur. Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his right eye.Godot:Godot:\n...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.Phoenix:\nA-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?Godot:\nYou don't understand the way the witness thinks.Judge:\nHow he thinks?Godot:\nYou remember this, I presume?Phoenix:\nThe \"I broke the vase... sorry\" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?Godot:\nExactly. The old man has one very grievous habit... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more muddled his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?Judge:\nClearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.Godot:\nAnd that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. \"I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!\" Ha...! Well, Trite?Phoenix:\nUrk... (That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)Maya:\nWow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!Judge:\nEnough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.Maya:\nBad luck, Nick. Looks like the \"boil\" of a contradiction you found is just a \"rash\".Godot:\nA mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.Armstrong:\nOui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.Witness Testimony-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nAlors. Is everyone sitting comfortably?\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Judge:\nHmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.Armstrong:\nWhat a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!Godot:\nDon't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.Phoenix:\n(Argh! I hate that guy!)Judge:\nYou said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?Armstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, run this by me again. The mirror was here, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nPhoenix:\nOui? Really!? Because I know if I were you, I wouldn't have put a mirror there! It would be in the way!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nLook who's talking, Trite.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're obstructing my view, among other things.\nPhoenix:\nBut, but, but! This is my seat in the courtroom...!\nGodot:\nTrés Bien's \"charm\" is that it gives you the impression that you're the only customer. Temporarily placing a mirror in that spot would hardly be \"in the way\". Unlike you... Trite.\nArmstrong:\nI tell you, monsieur. la mirror was z'ere, in z'e middle of la restaurant.Armstrong:\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd where would that be!?\nArmstrong:\nOh lá lá! Look 'ow you lean towards me! I always attract z'e younger boys! Maybe I should keep you in suspense a little longer!\nJudge:\nMr. Armstrong! Tell the court what you know at once!\nArmstrong:\nI attract z'e older ones, too, you know, 'andsome! Shall I tease you, too!?\nJudge:\nNnngh...\nGodot:\nI'm already seeing a very hot someone, so I'm afraid you'll be waiting for a long time.\nMaya:\nI bet she has mocha-cream skin and cappuccino perfume.\nArmstrong:\nBien. I will tell you... Z'ere was only one seat from which you could 'ave seen...Armstrong:\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo why can you only see the victim from that particular seat?\nArmstrong:\nMais, monsieur. It is obvious, non? If you look at la plans you will understand. La victim would 'ave been reflected in la mirror like so. If you were sitting at la table next to 'im, you would see everything, non?\nMaya:\nSo that's the seat Old Seedy was sitting in on that day... ...when the poisoning happened.\nPhoenix:\n(The old man was sitting at the table next to the victim? Why does that seem kinda odd...?)Present Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor!

I guess useless people are only really good at identifying useless things.\nJudge:\nWhat relevance does this scrap of paper have to the trial, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo's testimony is actually very relevant to the question at hand, Your Honor!

In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examinationMaya:\nIt is pretty strange, though, isn't it? I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.Phoenix:\nThen the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Trés Bien that day. (Now I've just got to prove it... Somehow...)Phoenix:\nThere is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony. Mr. Kudo broke the vase that was on the table where he was sitting. And yet! As the court can see, there is an unbroken vase on the table next to the victim! Why? Because Mr. Kudo was not, in fact, sitting at the table next to the victim at all!Godot:Godot:\nDon't be an idiot, Trite! That's impossible! That seat's the only one Kudo could've seen the victim's reflection from!Phoenix:\nExactly!Godot:\n...!Phoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion we can draw from this contradiction. There was no mirror in Trés Bien that day! Your testimony, Mr. Armstrong, is an elaborate lie!Armstrong:\nMon dieeeeeeeu!Godot:Godot:\nDon't try to confuse the court, Trite! Obviously, the witness cleaned up the vase... ...while the police were taking their time getting to the crime scene!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Godot, that doesn't quite work for me. Mr. Armstrong already testified to the contrary. In his own words... \"I did not touch anything else\" except the mirror!Godot:\nUr... urgh! ... Gaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nWell, witness? What do you have to say for yourself?Armstrong:\n*sniffle*Phoenix:\n(I was right! There was no mirror in the restaurant that day!)Judge:\nIn light of this revelation, we return back to the original problem. Why did the victim have an earpiece in an ear in which he couldn't hear?Godot:\nHa...! You only get one shot in life. There's no turning back. If you want to claim that the mirror wasn't there, Trite... ...then this problem is all yours. How do you explain what the old man saw?Phoenix:\n(If I can answer this, then I'll be that much closer to the truth! I can feel it!)Maya:\n...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?Phoenix:\nThere's more than just this one contradiction, Maya.Maya:\nWhat do you mean?Phoenix:\nRemember what Maggey told us? \"There was another man at the victim's table.\" And, \"there was a sample CD on the victim's table.\" It all flies in the face of Mr. Kudo's testimony. (And I think I know the reason why nothing in this case is adding up.)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Let's hear your answer.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The reason behind all the contradictions in Mr. Kudo's testimony is simple.Mr. Kudo made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, Mr. Kudo made a mistake!\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... You're the one who brought up all these contradictions.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nGodot:\nIf you're trying to tell us the old man just made a mistake... ...we can wrap up this case right now with a guilty verdict!\nJudge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? Should I just declare your client guilty?\nMaya:\nIs that the best you can come up with, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The ear doctor made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe we're looking at this the wrong way. It was actually the doctor's mistake.\nJudge:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The doctor got the wrong ear!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWell, I believe we saw an autopsy report yesterday. One that stated the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, and had medicine in it!\nJudge:\nI'm beginning to wonder if it's not your eardrum that's ruptured, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be playing with people's perceptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The victim was a phony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This case is riddled with contradictions.\"Phoenix:\nThis case is riddled with contradictions. Yet, there is one very simple answer that clears them all up.Judge:\nA-And what is that?Phoenix:\nThe incident Mr. Kudo witnessed, and the incident the victim experienced... ...were two completely different events!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nYes! The \"victim\" that Mr. Kudo saw wasn't Mr. Glen Elg at all! It was an imposter -- a phony pretending to be Mr. Elg! Obviously, unlike the victim, there was nothing wrong with the imposter's left eardrum. That's how he ended up wearing the earpiece in his left ear by mistake!Godot:\nPhwoooooooh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Settle down, or I'll clear the courtroom!Godot:\nQuiet, gramps! Why don't you clear out of here, huh?Judge:\nWHAT DID YOU SAY!?Godot:\nTrite... Are you saying what Mr. Kudo saw was a set-up?Phoenix:\nYes. Someone pretended to be Glen Elg and acted out the whole coffee poisoning. All for the express purpose of creating a \"witness\" out of one Mr. Victor Kudo!Godot:Godot:\nGet real, Trite! Why would anyone want to do that?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious? The thing Mr. Kudo was most insistent about in his testimony was...Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nI-It's so hard to believe, but...Phoenix:\nThere was one, and only one reason to show Mr. Kudo this fake poisoning! To show Maggey Byrde in the act of poisoning the coffee!Godot:Godot:\nAre you insinuating that the waitress in the old man's story was a fake as well? It's true that there were no customers in the restaurant at the time, but... ...it's also true that the chef was there! He would have noticed what was happening.Judge:\nTh-That's right! Well, witness? If your restaurant really was the scene of such theatrics... ...you would have known about it, correct!?Armstrong:\nOh là là... Z'is is most difficult for me...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, it's quite simple. All you have to do is testify. You are under oath, after all. Was there, in fact, a phony at Trés Bien that day!? The defense demands that Mr. Armstrong tell the whole truth about what happened.Judge:\nThe defense's request for additional testimony is accepted. You will accurately explain, in detail, the events in the restaurant that day!Armstrong:\nOu... Oui.Witness Testimony-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\nZ'ere were no other customers.\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Judge:\n...Just so we're clear, there was no mirror in the restaurant, after all?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Forgive me, Your Honor! I lied because I wanted z'is mess to be cleared up quickly.Judge:\nWhat you have just done is commit perjury, Mr. Armstrong! I will decide how to punish you later.Armstrong:\nO-Oui...Judge:\nFor now, we will hear your cross-examination. Mr. Wright, if you please. (Changed from [For now, we will hear your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Hmm.. He took that perjury charge a bit too well. But I'm guessing he'll be more serious trouble after this cross-examination!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas he alone at his table as well?\nArmstrong:\nMais, oui. I saw 'im from la kitchen.\nPhoenix:\nYet the defendant, Ms. Byrde, remembers it differently. She swears there was another man at the victim's table.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Unfortunately for you, Trite... ...yesterday's witness also testified that the victim was alone.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou know, seeing you squirm like that reminds me... ...of a certain coffee's bitter-sweet bite.\nPhoenix:\n(What kind of coffee has he been drinking!?)\nMaya:\nIt's not coffee, it's love! It's love that's bitter-sweet.\nPhoenix:\n(Hearing Maya say that makes her seem wise all of a sudden...)Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy old man, you mean Victor Kudo, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui. 'E comes often for my special coffee.\nGodot:\nI drank your coffee once, Mr. Armstrong. It's special, I'll give you that. It's worth a sip just for the experience.\nArmstrong:\nOh, you make me so 'appy, monsieur! You are most welcome any time!\nGodot:\nI said it was worth one sip, and nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n(So old Mr. Kudo arrived at the restaurant around the same time as the victim. Maybe I should ask about his arrival in more detail.)\n\n\n\nDon't ask anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I need to do is establish that this phony victim really existed. Asking more about the old man is only going to cloud the issue.) I think that's enough about coffee. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Armstrong.\nArmstrong:\nYou are welcome any time too, Monsieur Wright. I'll brew something special for you!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHow many minutes after?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying that not much time elapsed between when the victim and Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Z'at is correct.\nPhoenix:\n(But that still leaves the possibility that something happened in that gap of time.) And by your recollection, how much time would you say elapsed?\nArmstrong:\nLet me see... Approximately 2 minutes, I would say.\nPhoenix:\nT-Two minutes!? That's all?\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems unlikely that anything untoward could have happened in such a short time.\nPhoenix:\n(Rats! I knew I shouldn't have pursued this line of questioning...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhat time is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOut of curiosity, about what time was it when Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOh, no... I cannot remember, monsieur.\nJudge:\nHmm... I believe we were told by a witness yesterday...\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\n\n\nJudge:\nDoes that perhaps jog your memory, witness?\nArmstrong:\nLa incident 'appened about 20 minutes after 'e arrived. So the victim must 'ave arrived between 2:00 PM and 2:10 PM, non?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Just after 2, huh...)\nArmstrong:\nThank you for your 'elp, in jogging my memory, monsieur. You are wonderful!\nJudge:\nHah hah hah! I can't sit here all the time and do nothing now, can I!? The time of day will be added to the witness's testimony.\nArmstrong:\nOui, Monsieur Judge. Everything I do, I do it for you!\nJudge:\nMerci bien. That's French, isn't it? Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad at least one person is in a good mood...)\nMaya:\nH-He's even humming a song to himself...!\nChanges statement from \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\" to \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.\"Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure about the time?\nArmstrong:\nWhen I think really 'ard, 1 am sure it was just after 2. Oui. It is la time I stop serving la lunch menu.\nJudge:\nQuite right. I always break for lunch when the restaurants are serving their specials. I've been known to wind up a case early just to make it on time! Hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess you should never get between a hungry judge and his lunch...)\nJudge:\nOh, would you look at that! It's almost lunchtime already.\nPhoenix:\nWitness! Get on with your testimony, please!Present Millionaire Radio Flyer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nZ'ere were no other customers.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo your only customers were Mr. Kudo and the victim?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHow many times do you need to ask the same thing, Trite? You'd never catch me drinking the same blend twice!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're trying to establish the presence of a \"phony victim\" in the restaurant. But you're wasting your time. You can't grind bird seed to make coffee, if you catch my drift...\nPhoenix:\n(But there's a hole in this testimony somewhere! I'm sure of it!)Armstrong:\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see him?\nArmstrong:\nNon, I was in ze kitchen. But I 'eard 'im. I remember 'im shouting, \"Yes! 'Alf a million bucks!\"\nGodot:\nPresumably the defendant heard that too, then, correct?\nArmstrong:\nMaggey...? She looked like a poor little frightened dove!\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about Mr. Kudo?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man chocked on some bird seed z'at got stuck in 'is throat.\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems we now have yet another incident on our hands.Armstrong:\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what were you doing at that point? Without any customers, you must have had time to kill.\nArmstrong:\nI am multi-talented woman, monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nSorry? What do you mean?\nArmstrong:\nZ'ere is la renowned chef, Jean Armstrong, and la tragic poet, Claurice Armstrong.\nJudge:\nC-C-Claurice...?\nArmstrong:\nOui. I was writing a poem. An angry tale of a chef in 'alf a million dollars of debt... ...cooking for a man who won 'alf a million dollars on la lottery! It is called, \"Pourquoi\". It means, \"Why\". Per'aps I could recite it for la court?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you contacted the police as soon as the incident occurred?\nArmstrong:\nI asked la old man to call from la pay phone.\nGodot:\nBy your own argument, Trite... ...the purpose of this \"phony victim's\" performance was so the old man would see it. In other words... ...once the incident occurred, this opportunity would completely disappear.\nJudge:\nIndeed.\nArmstrong:\nBien.

Unfortunately for you, Trite... ...yesterday's witness also testified that the victim was alone.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou know, seeing you squirm like that reminds me... ...of a certain coffee's bitter-sweet bite.\nPhoenix:\n(What kind of coffee has he been drinking!?)\nMaya:\nIt's not coffee, it's love! It's love that's bitter-sweet.\nPhoenix:\n(Hearing Maya say that makes her seem wise all of a sudden...)Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy old man, you mean Victor Kudo, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui. 'E comes often for my special coffee.\nGodot:\nI drank your coffee once, Mr. Armstrong. It's special, I'll give you that. It's worth a sip just for the experience.\nArmstrong:\nOh, you make me so 'appy, monsieur! You are most welcome any time!\nGodot:\nI said it was worth one sip, and nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n(So old Mr. Kudo arrived at the restaurant around the same time as the victim. Maybe I should ask about his arrival in more detail.)\n\n\n\nDon't ask anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I need to do is establish that this phony victim really existed. Asking more about the old man is only going to cloud the issue.) I think that's enough about coffee. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Armstrong.\nArmstrong:\nYou are welcome any time too, Monsieur Wright. I'll brew something special for you!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHow many minutes after?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying that not much time elapsed between when the victim and Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Z'at is correct.\nPhoenix:\n(But that still leaves the possibility that something happened in that gap of time.) And by your recollection, how much time would you say elapsed?\nArmstrong:\nLet me see... Approximately 2 minutes, I would say.\nPhoenix:\nT-Two minutes!? That's all?\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems unlikely that anything untoward could have happened in such a short time.\nPhoenix:\n(Rats! I knew I shouldn't have pursued this line of questioning...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhat time is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOut of curiosity, about what time was it when Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOh, no... I cannot remember, monsieur.\nJudge:\nHmm... I believe we were told by a witness yesterday...\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\n\n\nJudge:\nDoes that perhaps jog your memory, witness?\nArmstrong:\nLa incident 'appened about 20 minutes after 'e arrived. So the victim must 'ave arrived between 2:00 PM and 2:10 PM, non?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Just after 2, huh...)\nArmstrong:\nThank you for your 'elp, in jogging my memory, monsieur. You are wonderful!\nJudge:\nHah hah hah! I can't sit here all the time and do nothing now, can I!? The time of day will be added to the witness's testimony.\nArmstrong:\nOui, Monsieur Judge. Everything I do, I do it for you!\nJudge:\nMerci bien. That's French, isn't it? Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad at least one person is in a good mood...)\nMaya:\nH-He's even humming a song to himself...!\nChanges statement from \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\" to \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.\"Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure about the time?\nArmstrong:\nWhen I think really 'ard, 1 am sure it was just after 2. Oui. It is la time I stop serving la lunch menu.\nJudge:\nQuite right. I always break for lunch when the restaurants are serving their specials. I've been known to wind up a case early just to make it on time! Hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess you should never get between a hungry judge and his lunch...)\nJudge:\nOh, would you look at that! It's almost lunchtime already.\nPhoenix:\nWitness! Get on with your testimony, please!Present Millionaire Radio Flyer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nZ'ere were no other customers.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo your only customers were Mr. Kudo and the victim?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHow many times do you need to ask the same thing, Trite? You'd never catch me drinking the same blend twice!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're trying to establish the presence of a \"phony victim\" in the restaurant. But you're wasting your time. You can't grind bird seed to make coffee, if you catch my drift...\nPhoenix:\n(But there's a hole in this testimony somewhere! I'm sure of it!)Armstrong:\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see him?\nArmstrong:\nNon, I was in ze kitchen. But I 'eard 'im. I remember 'im shouting, \"Yes! 'Alf a million bucks!\"\nGodot:\nPresumably the defendant heard that too, then, correct?\nArmstrong:\nMaggey...? She looked like a poor little frightened dove!\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about Mr. Kudo?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man chocked on some bird seed z'at got stuck in 'is throat.\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems we now have yet another incident on our hands.Armstrong:\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what were you doing at that point? Without any customers, you must have had time to kill.\nArmstrong:\nI am multi-talented woman, monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nSorry? What do you mean?\nArmstrong:\nZ'ere is la renowned chef, Jean Armstrong, and la tragic poet, Claurice Armstrong.\nJudge:\nC-C-Claurice...?\nArmstrong:\nOui. I was writing a poem. An angry tale of a chef in 'alf a million dollars of debt... ...cooking for a man who won 'alf a million dollars on la lottery! It is called, \"Pourquoi\". It means, \"Why\". Per'aps I could recite it for la court?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you contacted the police as soon as the incident occurred?\nArmstrong:\nI asked la old man to call from la pay phone.\nGodot:\nBy your own argument, Trite... ...the purpose of this \"phony victim's\" performance was so the old man would see it. In other words... ...once the incident occurred, this opportunity would completely disappear.\nJudge:\nIndeed.\nArmstrong:\nBien. It seems la shadow of doubt 'as been lifted, n'est-ce pas?\nPhoenix:\n...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Maya:\nI guess Mr. Armstrong is connected to this case, huh?Phoenix:\nAbsolutely. Someone was impersonating Mr. Elg, and I refuse to believe he was oblivious. He was there the whole time, after all.Maya:\nBut if you're right, wouldn't Maggey have noticed, too?Phoenix:\nShe fell unconscious when the incident occurred, remember?Maya:\nAh! You mean that's when the phony staged his act?Phoenix:\nWe'll know for sure once I find a hole in this testimony.Phoenix:\nI'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.Armstrong:\nQ-Quoi? What do you mean?Phoenix:\nAt the time in question, the victim was listening to the radio with his earpiece. The show he was listening to was \"Millionaire Radio\". Each week, they announce the winning number of a half million dollar lottery ticket.Armstrong:\nOui. Z'at must be la show Mon. Elg was listening to.Judge:\nI can't see any problem with this testimony, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nI wonder...Armstrong:\n...?Phoenix:\nYou say the victim arrived at your restaurant after 2 PM, correct?Armstrong:\nOui, oui. I am sure of it. I remember it perfectly now! I know it was z'at time, because I 'ad just finished serving la lunch menu.Godot:\nGet to the point, Trite. If you have one.Phoenix:\nThat show is broadcast live at 1:30 PM. And it claims to be \"the most thrilling 10 minutes of your life\"...Judge:\nI-It's on the air at 1:30!?Phoenix:\nNow, supposedly, the victim made some noise when it was announced that he had won. And yet... I don't believe his cry of joy could have occurred after 2 PM! Because the show had already finished more than 30 minutes earlier by that point in time!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Phoenix:\nThis \"victim\" we've been told about has done nothing but the impossible! Listening to the radio with a ruptured eardrum, catching a show that was already over... There is only one conclusion you can draw from these facts! This \"victim\" was an imposter, acting out the poisoning 30 minutes after the real murder! Yes, there were two Glen Elgs in Trés Bien that day. The real Glen Elg, now dead, having been poisoned by the real killer... ...and the phony Glen Elg, acting out the events for Mr. Kudo to witness!Judge:\nI-It certainly seems that way... I mean, if that wasn't the case, how could you explain the time discrepancy?Godot:Godot:\nQuite a performance, Trite. You were almost on a roll.Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nBut sadly, you lack the rock hard foundation of rhythm to build your song!Phoenix:\n(...What is this? Music Theory 101?)Godot:\nLet's recap. According to your \"imaginative\" theory, it's now just after 2 PM... The phony Elg is performing a play for the benefit of Mr. Kudo. How do you explain then, where the real Glen Elg is!?Phoenix:\nI don't believe I have to spell this out for court! However! At that time, the real Glen Elg was already dead!Judge:\nThat's certainly the obvious conclusion.Godot:Godot:\nThank you, Trite. That's exactly what I was hoping you would say.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Godot:\nNow, I presume you can prove this theory of yours...? Can you explain where the missing corpse went to!?Phoenix:\nTh-The missing corpse...?Godot:\nAccording to the old man's testimony, there was only one other customer there. If that \"customer\" was the phony Glen Elg... ...then where did the killer hide the body of the real victim!?Phoenix:\nNaaaaaargh!Judge:\nThe prosecution has a valid point, Mr. Wright. If your theory is to stand up to examination by the court... ...you must provide us with proof by answering the prosecution's question. Where did the killer hide the body?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...Godot:\nNo conjecture, Trite. Let's hear some facts for once. Show the court a piece of evidence that proves where the body was hidden!Phoenix:\nE-Evidence!?Maya:\nWh-What's with the intense pressure in here all of a sudden!?Phoenix:\n(I thought I had him with that contradiction. But he's turned it all around and backed me into a corner instead!)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence. First, where was the body of the real Mr. Elg concealed?Outside Trés Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Trés Bien. Therefore, the killer must have hauled the body outside!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight. What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nStart over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think I need to clear my head...\nGodot:\nHa...! I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo también.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent more evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll hit them with another piece of evidence and see if that helps...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Clearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Trés Bien.\"Inside Trés Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt'd would [sic] have been too dangerous to take the body outside. Obviously, the body must have been hidden somewhere inside Trés Bien.\nJudge:\nHmm... Interesting... But where could a body have been hidden inside a restaurant? Perhaps you would care to show the court on these plans, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The exact location where the body was concealed inside Trés Bien is...\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe body was hidden here!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent Small Bottle (after presenting Kitchen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight. What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nStart over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think I need to clear my head...\nGodot:\nHa...! I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo también.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPick another location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll have another go at proving where the body was hidden.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It'd would have been too dangerous to take the body outside.\"Phoenix:\nMr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non, non! I 'ave never seen z'at ugly bottle before in my life! I only use la very best bottles, monsieur! Z'e 'ighest quality only for me!Judge:\nWhere was that bottle found, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nInterestingly enough, Your Honor. it was found in the kitchen of Trés Bien.Armstrong:\nEh? Quoi!? But I only ever use z'ese bottles for my aromatherapy oils.Phoenix:\nBut this bottle doesn't contain aromatherapy oil, Mr. Armstrong. No, it contains a medication.Judge:\nWhat kind of medication?Phoenix:\nI'm sure everyone remembers, don't they? That Mr. Elg visited an otolaryngological clinic, and was given medication that day!Godot:\nY-You can't be serious...Phoenix:\nThe defense had the contents of the bottle analyzed, and I have the lab results here! The contents of the bottle match the prescription that was given to Mr. Elg!Godot:\nBwooooar!Phoenix:\nGlen Elg's murderer hid the body in the restaurant kitchen. At which time, this bottle fell out of the victim's pocket. Mr. Armstrong! When the incident occurred, didn't you say you were in the kitchen?Armstrong:\nM-M-Mon dieu!Phoenix:\nYes, you know about what I'm about to say, It was YOU who hid the victim's body! You did a fine job pretending to defend my client, Maggey Byrde. However! You were setting her up to take the fall behind the poor girl's back!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! This is an extraordinary development. Witness! Did you... Did you murder Mr. Glen Elg?Armstrong:\nNever! I could not do such an 'orrible thing!Godot:\nNoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!?Godot:\n...The bitterness... Every time I get lied to, I always down a mug of coffee. ...That's one of my rules.Phoenix:\n(Do you have the slightest idea how many cups you've had by now...?)Godot:\nThen I like to do the same to the person who lied to me. I like to take them down with my empty cup! Listen up, chef! How about a brand new flavor in your ear, my \"h\" deficient friend?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Please, you must 'ear me out! It is a trap! Listen to me! Por favor!Judge:\nYo hablo Español, Mr. Armstrong, and \"Por favor\" is Spanish.Godot:\nI'm only going to ask you once. Did you do it?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non! Absolutely non! I simply... I...Godot:\nLet's hear it. You've got one shot. Right, gramps?Judge:\nWitness! The court will permit you the chance to make one final statement. If you lie under oath again, Mr. Godot's coffee mug awaits you... As does my gavel!Armstrong:\nO-Oui... It is clear.Phoenix:\n(What do they always say in the movies...? \"I've got a bad feeling about this...\"?)Judge:\nVery well! Begin your final testimony, Mr. Armstrong!Witness Testimony-- The Confession --Armstrong:\nIt is true, I 'id la body in la kitchen.\nA man forced me to do it. I 'ad no choice.\nI 'ad to go along w'iz 'im because... Z'ere was a reason why I could not refuse.\nBut I did not kill 'im! I swear it! You must believe me!Judge:\nYou were \"forced\"? By who!?Armstrong:\nI-I cannot say! Or I will be... erased!Phoenix:\nLet's try a different question then. When Mr. Elg died, was he really the only person at his table?Armstrong:\n... Z'ere was... Z'ere was another man.Phoenix:\n(I knew it!)Maya:\nMaggey was telling the truth!Judge:\nYou may cross-examine the witness now, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(There's just one more thing I need to do. I gotta break this guy, and get him to tell us the name of the real killer.)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Confession --Armstrong:\nIt is true, I 'id la body in la kitchen.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you carry the body by yourself?\nArmstrong:\nOui. I carried 'im. And I carried Maggey, too.\nPhoenix:\nMaggey, too!?\nArmstrong:\nWhen she saw la victim collapse, she fainted. I could not leave 'er z'ere.\nJudge:\nBut why did you hide the bodies?Armstrong:\nA man forced me to do it. I 'ad no choice.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat man? Who was he?\nArmstrong:\nNon! Non, I cannot say! I fear for my life!\nPhoenix:\n(He's really scared...)\nMaya:\nYou'll just have to put the words in his mouth, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you're right. If he won't tell me, I'll tell him.\nJudge:\nBut why would you go along with this man?Present Jean's Loan Contract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou have a half a million dollar debt, don't you?\nJudge:\nH-Half a million dollars!?

But if that's the line the prosecution takes, we could be in trouble.

If Detective Gumshoe's going to check some prints for us, shouldn't he be checking this?\nGumshoe:\nThat's that small bottle I gave back to you this morning, right?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim's ear medication that we found in the kitchen?\nMaya:\nLook, it even says, \"covered in unidentified fingerprints\" right in the Court Record!\nGumshoe:\nYou're right!

I think it's time we got something straight.Godot:\nWhat's this, Trite? A new line of irrelevant questioning?Phoenix:\nThese are the floor plans of the crime scene. You say you were standing at the entrance, Mr. Tigre? From there, your field of vision would have covered an area something like... this.Judge:\nIndeed. The witness would have had a clear view of the victim's seat.Tigre:\nIsn't that what I just said? I saw the back of the kid's head.Phoenix:\nUnfortunately for you, that is not possible. If the court would think back, you'll remember that between each of the tables... ...is a tall partition!Judge:\nWhy...! That's true!Phoenix:\nNow look at the plans again! The truth is painfully obvious! From the entrance, the field of vision of any customer walking in... ...ends here!Tigre:\n...Phoenix:\nSo, from the entrance of Trés Bien, you couldn't have seen the victim's seat. But you did see the victim that day... because you met with him!Godot:Godot:\nWrong! Have you forgotten the old man's testimony yesterday? The victim was alone at his table.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut the defense just proved that point to be moot! The \"victim\" witnessed by Mr. Kudo was not Glen Elg, but a fake!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nIn order to have Mr. Kudo falsely testify... ...the real killer posed as the victim he had just killed and acted out a charade!Judge:\nThat will do! This trial has gone on long enough without the obvious question being answered. Who exactly was this \"real killer\" who impersonated the victim?Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nYou say the killer murdered Glen Elg... ...and then impersonated his victim in a performance for Victor Kudo? In that case, Mr. Wright, reveal the identity of this \"criminal\" to the court!Present Furio Tigre profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nObviously, it's the person you least expect!

Carry on with the proceedings as normal.\nMaya:\nBetter think again while he's down there, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I should've picked the obvious choice...)\nJudge:\nVery good. I've found my pen now. So, allow me to pose the question again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"You say the killer murdered Glen Elg...\"Phoenix:\nObviously... ...the killer is Furio Tigre! No one else could have done it.Judge:\nWh-What!? Well, witness?Tigre:\n... Grrrah ha hah! Now that's cute! Youse think you can pin this on The Tiger!? Maybe youse don't understand. The Tiger is king of the jungle! So I dares you' to say it again! Come on! You' got the guts!?Judge:\nY-Y-You can't threaten m-me, Mr. Tigre! I-It's the defense! Go ahead and tell the witness, Mr. Wright! Mr. Wriiight!Tigre:\nSounds to me like it must be you', old man. Youse got guts, I'll give you that.Judge:\nM-M-Mr. Wright! Do not leave me to handle this alone!Godot:\n...Ha...! Perhaps I can end this embarrassment.Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!Godot:\nLet's just go back over Mr. Kudo's testimony one more time. The old man didn't see just the victim! Oh, no, no, no.Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there!Godot:\nWas the victim he saw the real victim or not? That doesn't matter. The fact remains, he saw the accused put the poison into the coffee!Judge:\n...! Yes, it was the waitress who poisoned the coffee--Phoenix:Phoenix:\nV-Very impressive, Mr. Godot. ...Waiting for my absence to launch your attack!Godot:\nHa...! Found your pen at last, Trite?Phoenix:\nIt was in my pocket. *ahem* But anyway... Mr. Kudo witnessed two people that day. He saw the victim, the \"supposed\" Mr. Glen Elg, and the \"waitress\"... from behind.Judge:\nYes... Your point, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nI think the conclusion is obvious. If this \"Glen Elg\" was really the killer in disguise... ...then surely it's possible the \"waitress\" was also part of the show.Judge:\nWhat!? You mean, the waitress was an imposter as well!?Phoenix:\nThe defendant, Ms. Byrde, fell unconscious immediately after the incident. And someone used her fainting to hatch an elaborate plan to pin the murder on her!Judge:\nWho on earth was it!? Who was this \"waitress\" that Mr. Kudo witnessed?Present Viola Cadaverini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"W-Who is this woman?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nObviously, it's the person you least expect!

I've found my pen now. So, allow me to pose the question again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"Who on earth was it!?\"Judge:\nW-Who is this woman?Phoenix:\nHer name is Viola Cadaverini. She's an employee of Tender Lender.Tigre:\nYouse makin' a big mistake... D'you know who Violetta's grandfather is? You' betta be goin' home in an armored truck tonight, if you' know what I mean...Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nStop shaking, Nick!Phoenix:\nWh-Where was I? Yes, the defendant, Ms. Byrde, has stated the following...Byrde:\nWell, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant.Byrde:\nUmm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh.Tigre:\n...Phoenix:\nThere are just too many contradictions in this case. The \"second man\" at the victim's table who nobody but Ms. Byrde seems to have seen. The earpiece worn by the victim in his left ear when that eardrum was ruptured! And the radio show he was supposedly listening to half an hour after it was over. There is only one logical explanation that clears up all of these contradictions! The whole incident took place twice! Once for real, and once for show! And, Mr. Furio Tigre, the only person who could have committed the crime... ...was you!Tigre:\n... ......Judge:\nW-Witness? What have you got to say?Tigre:\n... That's cute!Judge:\nS-Sorry?Tigre:\nYouse alright. I could do with a guy like you' around.Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean?Tigre:\nOK, I'm in on this game! I'm gonna have to charter a jet to get me to my meetin' now, but... ...I'm gonna give youse one more thing to think about before I go.Phoenix:\nSomething to think about?Tigre:\nYouse got it all wrapped up nice, huh, Wright? But youse missed out one real important thing!Phoenix:\nBut that can't be!Tigre:\nI was in the joint that day. And I met that kid, too.Phoenix:\n...!Tigre:\nBut I couldn't have poisoned him, youse hear?Judge:\nWhat!? Do you really expect us to believe you now, Mr. Tigre?Godot:\nHa...! What a troublemaker.Phoenix:\nT-Troublemaker...?Godot:\nLooks like we're going to need another one for the road. One more steaming cup of hot testimony!Judge:\nIndeed. Witness, you will explain yourself to the court. I will give you one more chance to testify. What happened that day at Trés Bien between yourself and the victim?Witness Testimony-- Ties to the Victim --Tigre:\nYeah, I loaned Elg cash. About 100,000 dollars.\nThat day, we was due to have a little chat. The kid had hit his payback date, see?\nSo anyway, he tells me he's got no way to pay up.\nI'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.\n\"Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks!\" He got lucky, you' know. Real lucky.\nIf that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.Judge:\nNow, I see that the principal amount you loaned to Mr. Elg was 50,000 dollars...Tigre:\nYeah, well. Youse got the vig to take into account. Interest builds up fast, you' know.Phoenix:\n(That's faster than fast! 100,000 dollars is twice his principal!)Judge:\nAnd the repayment deadline was December 3rd, the day of the incident in question.Tigre:\nYeah. He was one lucky kid! He got that half a million just in time. So I ain't have no reason to kill the kid. And if I ain't got no motive, you ain't got no case!Phoenix:\n(His motive? Hmm... He has to have one, but what is it?)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Ties to the Victim --Tigre:\nYeah, I loaned Elg cash. About 100,000 dollars.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid he have any way of paying the loan back?\nTigre:\nThe fool was a gambler. He said he couldn't give it up 'til he landed a big win. So I agreed to help him.\nJudge:\nHelp him? You?\nTigre:\nI kept hittin' him with ideas for ways he could getta big win. But the guy kept losin'.\nPhoenix:\nSo you were helping him for his sake? Or yours?\nTigre:\n\"Win Through Compromise\"! Youse help me, I help youse! What's the difference, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(...I don't believe this!)\nMaya:\nNick, would anyone really ever loan money to someone they thought was unreliable? Like, for example, if it were you, I'd only loan you five bucks, max.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks a lot, Maya.)Tigre:\nThat day, we was due to have a little chat. The kid had hit his payback date, see?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo how much were you expecting him to pay you back on that day?\nTigre:\nWhat d'youse think!? The whole package! $100,000, including interest.\nMaya:\nThat's a real heavyweight punch!\nTigre:\nOnce a client misses a repayment, you' call the whole loan in. You' wanna make it in my world, that's all youse gotta know.\nJudge:\nAnd how many times had Mr. Elg been late with his repayments?\nTigre:\nOnce.\nPhoenix:\nAnd how much was he supposed to pay back every month?\nTigre:\n50 bucks.\nMaya:\nSounds like Mr. Elg was in a real sticky spot.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, at 50 dollars a month, he'd never pay that huge loan off!)Tigre:\nSo anyway, he tells me he's got no way to pay up.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow much did he have left on his debt?\nTigre:\nYou want it in round figures? About 100,000 bucks.\nPhoenix:\n(That's the whole amount!)\nGodot:\nWe're talking about a guy who had 58 cents in his wallet.\nTigre:\nWhat!? Youse tellin' me he wasn't even gonna pay for the coffee!?\nJudge:\nHe certainly seems to have been a brave man, this Mr. Elg.\nTigre:\nThat guy was smooth, I tell youse. Real smooth! \"You'll have your money in less than 5 minutes!\" That's what he says to me. The guy then calls me the \"Tender Tiger\". He was skatin' on thin ice with me!Tigre:\nI'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas that because he...?\nTigre:\nThe guy won the lottery. Was his last chance at a big win.\nJudge:\nAnd you confirm that this is the ticket in question?\nTigre:\n...That's it.\nJudge:\nThe \"Millionaire Radio\" show starts at 1:30 PM and runs for 10 minutes... That fixes the time you two met with some accuracy.\nPhoenix:\n(And the whole scene was acted out again 30 minutes later. All so that Mr. Kudo would see it!)\nTigre:\nI can still see the kid's face now. I ain't never gonna forget it.Tigre:\n\"Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks!\" He got lucky, you' know. Real lucky.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas there anyone else in the restaurant at the time?\nTigre:\nI don't remember.\nPhoenix:\n(If there was no one there, I'll wear that ridiculous tiger shirt for a month! Mr. Armstrong, Maggey and if I'm right, Viola Cadaverini, were all there at that time.)\nJudge:\nSo, the victim had intended to repay you from his lottery winnings from the beginning?\nTigre:\nSeems dat way to me.\nJudge:\nB-But you wouldn't normally expect to win the lottery, would you!?\nGodot:\nHa...! The undying belief that your next roll will end the worst losing streak you ever had... That's what defines a true gambler.\nPhoenix:\n(He makes it sound so cool...)\nMaya:\nDon't be tempted, Nick! You haven't got the will-power for it!\nTigre:\nAll I know is, the kid took a shot and he got lucky in the end.Tigre:\nIf that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe waitress. You mean...?\nTigre:\nThe girl with the glasses in the defendant's chair! Who else could I mean!? If she hadn't got in the way, things woulda been, bada-bing, bada-boom, over and done with!\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe I should push a little on this...)\n\n\n\nAsk about what Maggey did\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat exactly are you implying the defendant did?\nTigre:\nHow about you go ask four-eyes about that half a million dollar ticket! She wanted it so bad... ...she poisoned Elg's coffee.\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA likely theory! Your word hasn't held water lately, Mr. Tigre.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nLet's not forget this witness was actually at the scene, Trite.\nTigre:\nThe law don't exactly agree with some of the deals I send down. I couldn't be there when de cops showed up, so I split.\nJudge:\nI-I see...\nGodot:\nYour Honor! The witness's last few statements are worth a good two cups of coffee.\nJudge:\nI concur, Mr. Godot! You will amend your testimony accordingly, witness!\nTigre:\nHa ha ha! So that's what youse after, Phoenix Wright!\nChanges statement from \"If that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.\" to \"Thanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!\"\n\n\n\n\nAsk how things would've been\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean things would have been over and done with?\nTigre:\nAre youse all there or what!? I'm talkin' about the cash! I was there to get my 100,000 bucks back. That's all. I'm a business man. It was all comin' together before that waitress got in the way.\nJudge:\nHmm... As far as I can tell from the witness's testimony... ...other than recouping his loan, Mr. Tigre had no motive for killing the victim. Witness! You will amend your testimony to reflect what you just said.\nPhoenix:\n(The Tiger's motive, huh...)\nChanges statement from \"If that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.\" to \"I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\"Tigre:\nThanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(The Tiger's trying to pin the crime on Maggey. If I ask him about what he saw, it's only going to damage our case.) What do you mean things would have been over and done with?\nTigre:\nAre youse all there or what!? I'm talkin' about the cash! I was there to get my 100,000 bucks back. That's all. I'm a business man. It was all comin' together before that waitress got in the way.\nJudge:\nHmm... As far as I can tell from the witness's testimony... ...other than recouping his loan, Mr. Tigre had no motive for killing the victim. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you happy with the testimony, or would you like it amended?\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I better leave it at that and try to figure something out...) Thank you, Your Honor, but there is no need to amend the testimony.\nJudge:\nVery well. Continue with your cross-examination, then.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHave it amended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not going to get anywhere with the testimony as it stands...) Your Honor, the defense would like the testimony amended.\nJudge:\nVery well. Witness! You will amend your testimony to reflect your recent statements, please.\nChanges statement from \"Thanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!\" to \"I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\"Tigre:\nI was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you saying you had no other motives that day?\nTigre:\nYeah, so what?\nGodot:\nThen why didn't you take the lottery ticket when you left?\nTigre:\nWhy d'youse think!? Because of four-eyes over there!\nPhoenix:\n(Because of Maggey!?)\nTigre:\nHow about you go ask four-eyes about that half a million dollar ticket! She wanted it so bad... ...she poisoned Elg's coffee.\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA likely theory! Your word hasn't held water lately, Mr. Tigre.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nLet's not forget this witness was actually at the scene, Trite.\nTigre:\nThe law don't exactly agree with some of the deals I send down. I couldn't be there when de cops showed up, so I split.\nJudge:\nI-I see...\nGodot:\nYour Honor! The witness's last few statements are worth a good two cups of coffee.\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Are you happy with the testimony, or would you like it amended?\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I better leave it at that and try to figure something out...) Thank you, Your Honor, but there is no need to amend the testimony.\nJudge:\nVery well.

I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\" to \"Thanks to what she did, my business with that kid was over!\"Present Sports Paper or MC Bomber\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you just intended to get back the 100,000 dollars Mr. Elg owed you, correct?\nTigre:\nI loaned the guy the cash, so that's my right.\nPhoenix:\nUnfortunately for Mr. Elg... I don't believe the 100,000 dollars is what you were after.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWhat are you getting at, Trite? What else would a moneylender be after other than money!?\nPhoenix:\nOh, the moneylender was after money. But money in a totally different league. The kind of money that a single disc like this would fetch!\nTigre:\n...!\nJudge:\nWhat is that?\nPhoenix:\nA computer virus, Your Honor. A virus called \"MC Bomber\"!\nJudge:\nA \"computer virus\"? What does one of those do?\nPhoenix:\nA computer virus is a program that wreaks havoc on the insides of a computer.\nJudge:\nA \"computer\"? What does one of those do?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess the beard isn't the only part of His Honor that is from the stone age!) I'll explain it to you later, Your Honor. Right now, this is the important point... A virus like \"MC Bomber\" would be worth several million dollars on the black market.\nJudge:\nS-Several million dollars!?\nPhoenix:\nLending money with no hope of ever seeing repayment would normally be bad for business. But in this case, the very fact that Glen Elg had no way to repay the money is crucial.\nJudge:\nWhat!?\nPhoenix:\nGlen Elg was a programmer. A highly skilled programmer. That skill was the collateral Mr. Elg put up in order to borrow the money.\nTigre:\n...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou're trying to suggest the witness's motive was to get hold of that program?\nPhoenix:\nExactly.\nGodot:\nThe witness may be poor fashion sense, but he is by no means an idiot, Trite. A man like him could get his hands on one million dollars without resorting to murder.\nPhoenix:\nOf course he could... Provided that he had time. But what if he had needed the money right then? When the pressure's on, the luxury of choice tends to disappear.\nJudge:\nIt seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright. Would you care to share it with us? Why did Mr. Tigre need money to the tune of one million dollars?\n\n\n\nPresent Viola's Medical Papers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"In December of last year, you found yourself in need of a huge amount of money.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?\nGodot:\nIt's evidence... that Trite has no idea what he's doing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? What do you mean?\nGodot:\nYou're way off track, Trite. That evidence is irrelevant!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did he have the right to dish out penalties?)\nMaya:\nA-Are you alright, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n100,000 dollars wasn't enough for Mr. Tigre. He needed much more money than that. And in a hurry!\nLeads back to:\n\"It seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright.\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIn December of last year, you found yourself in need of a huge amount of money.\nTigre:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nAbout 6 months ago, you were involved in a traffic accident, weren't you? An accident involving a car and a scooter, in which a young woman was injured. She was taken to the hospital, where she underwent surgery.\nTigre:\nH-How muccha dis... do youse know...!? (Changed from [Wh-Where did youse get all this info...?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nThese medical papers document the treatment of the young woman in question. According to these, her operation cost... one million dollars! And yet, when the payment was due last month, you somehow managed to pay it in full! (Changed from [Payment for these expenses was due in December of last year, and was paid in full!] in the original release)\nJudge:\nO-One million dollars!? A preposterous sum! Someone should sue these HMOs!\nGodot:\nHa...! No one would pay a bill like that. If the medical association got wind of it, the hospital would end up as dead as a morgue.\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Tigre had no choice but to pay! Because his very life depended on it!\nTigre:\nGrrraaaaaaaargh!\nJudge:\nO-Order! Order! Order! You say his very life depended on it, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nIndeed it did. Simply because the injured woman was none other than Viola Cadaverini.\nGodot:\n...! Did you say, \"Cadaverini\"?\nPhoenix:\nBruto Cadaverini, Mob boss in charge of all underworld activities in the city, and... ...doting grandfather to his precious \"Violetta\", also known as Viola Cadaverini.\nGodot:\nBwooooar!\nPhoenix:\nYour life was in danger unless you paid \"compensation\" to the boss, correct? It makes sense! You were desperate to acquire the one million dollars Cadaverini demanded of you! So desperate, in fact, that you decided to sacrifice Glen Elg's life to pay your debt!\nLeads to:\n\"On the day of the murder, Mr. Tigre's sole intention was to get his hands on this CD!\"Present Viola's Medical Papers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you just intended to get back the 100,000 dollars Mr. Elg owed you, correct?\nTigre:\nI loaned the guy the cash, so that's my right.\nPhoenix:\nUnfortunately for Mr. Elg... ...100,000 dollars wasn't enough to cover it, wasn't it?\nTigre:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nAbout 6 months ago, you were involved in a traffic accident, weren't you? An accident involving a car and a scooter, in which a young woman was injured. She was taken to the hospital, where she underwent surgery.\nTigre:\nH-How muccha dis... do youse know...!?

So desperate, in fact, that you decided to sacrifice Glen Elg's life to pay your debt!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! What do you say to that, witness?\nTigre:\n...Grrr... urgh...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nIt's a nice little fairy tale, Trite. But even if the witness did need a million dollars... ...that doesn't tie him to Mr. Elg's murder. Mr. Elg only owed him 100,000 dollars, and had no hope of repaying it anyway!\nTigre:\nYeah. That guy wasn't worth my spit!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't think so. In fact, the opposite is true.\nGodot:\nThe opposite?\nPhoenix:\nLending money with no hope of ever seeing repayment would normally be bad for business. But... In this case, the very fact that Glen Elg had no way to repay the money is crucial.\nJudge:\nWhat!?\nMaya:\nDo you know where you're going with this, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYou've got to think outside the box, Maya.\nMaya:\nOutside the box?\nPhoenix:\nIt's very straightforward. Mr. Tigre wasn't after the 100,000 dollars at all.\nJudge:\nIt seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright. Would you care to share it with us? What exactly was Mr. Tigre \"after\"?\n\n\n\nPresent Sports Paper or MC Bomber\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Glen was a programmer. A highly skilled programmer.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of this, Mr. Wright!?\nGodot:\nIt's evidence... that Trite has no idea what he's doing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? What do you mean?\nGodot:\nYou're way off track, Trite. That evidence is irrelevant!\nPhoenix:\n(Since when did he have the right to dish out penalties?)\nMaya:\nA-Are you alright, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Tigre needed one million dollars. Recovering a loan 100,000 dollars wasn't enough. (Besides, Elg had the means to make that kind of money if he wanted to.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It seems you have a logical conclusion for this theory, Mr. Wright.\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nGlen was a programmer. A highly skilled programmer. That skill was the collateral Mr. Elg put up in order to borrow the money.\nGodot:\nCare to explain how skill can be used as collateral to secure a loan, Trite?\nPhoenix:\nHe had the skill to create a computer virus, and so he did. A virus known as \"MC Bomber\"!\nJudge:\nA \"computer virus\"? What does one of those do?\nPhoenix:\nA computer virus is a program that wreaks havoc on the insides of a computer.\nJudge:\nA \"computer\"? What does one of those do?\nPhoenix:\n(I guess the beard isn't the only part of His Honor that is from the stone age!) I'll explain it to you later, Your Honor. Right now, this is the important point... A virus like \"MC Bomber\" would be worth several million dollars on the black market. Mr. Tigre! You couldn't have cared less about the 100,000 dollars! Isn't that right? All you cared about was one thing! The virus!\nTigre:\nGrrr... Grrraaaaaaaaaaaargh!\nLeads to:\n\"On the day of the murder, Mr. Tigre's sole intention was to get his hands on this CD!\"Maya:\nSo The Tiger was meeting Glen Elg to get his money back. If Mr. Elg had just given him the lottery ticket, that would have been the end of it.Phoenix:\nYeah, so what's The Tiger's motive? (This is the big one. If I don't manage to undermine this testimony, it's all over for us.) Why would he have to poison Mr. Elg? And why did he loan him the money in the first place, when he knew he couldn't repay him?",

It's freshly baked desserts! ♬\nRay: This program sure brings back memories. Gregory... Tomorrow, I'm heading towards that fateful place with your son. To find out the truth of 18 years ago...\nEdgeworth: Mr. Shields, isn't it about time you told me what this is all about? Why did you bring me to this museum with you?\nRay: You're not busy now, are you Miles? I thought it would be nice if we could share the romance of the constellations together.\nEdgeworth: ...I beg your pardon, but I would like to leave.\nRay: Sorry, sorry. It was just a joke. Do you know about the final case your father worked on? The \"IS-7 Incident\"?\nEdgeworth: Yes... Manfred von Karma showed it to me immediately after I became a prosecutor. I reviewed the case file again last night, after you invited me here. And... while I don't remember it very well, I also had been in attendance at the trial back then. (When I was young... I loved watching my father do battle in the courtroom. During that trial, it was my father, the defense attorney Gregory Edgeworth against... ...my former mentor, Prosecutor Manfred von Karma. And while the trial ended with the defendant being declared guilty...)\nRay: I see... So you were there too, at Gregory's final trial. In that case, I'll cut to the chase and tell you what you want to know. The truth about the \"IS-7 Incident\". It happened 18 years ago, during the winter... All the buildings were covered in snow, coating the entire town like a layer of frosting. And it was in this very place, that the incident occurred. This was all before Uncle Ray became a defense attorney...\nRay: Mr. Edgeworth. This request sure was sudden, don't you think?\nGregory: Indeed. We were contacted immediately after the client was arrested.\nGregory: My name is Gregory Edgeworth. I am a defense attorney. I brought my assistant, Raymond, with me to meet our client, but...\nRay: A murder on Christmas Eve! This is just too much!\n???: ♪ Ahh... In the darkneeeess... A miraculous meetiiiiiing... ♬ ♬ Welcome one and aaaall to the visitor's roooom! ♪\nRay: A-Amazning! So this is what meeting a client is like! It all happened so suddenly, I was completely surprised!\nGregory: (...I'm also surprised.)\n???: A thousand pardons for startling you. I am merely expressing my happiness through song. Welcome one and all... I greatly appreciate you coming.\nGregory: So you're the client for this case...?\n???: Indeed.\nGregory: My name is Gregory Edgeworth. I'm a defense attorney. I will be representing you in court. This is my assistant, Raymond Shields.\nRay: N-Nice to meet you! I... um...! I'll do my best to help you!\nGregory: Relax, Raymond. ...Please excuse his jitters. He's working part time at my office as an apprentice. I thought I'd let him assist me in this investigation.\n???: So, Mr. Gregory and Raymond, correct? I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.\nGregory: (My job involves saving my clients from crimes in which they were falsely accused. First, I should determine if he is truly innocent.) First, I would like to know more about you.\n???: Ah, I have forgotten to introduce myself. My name is Jeffrey Master.\nRay: What!? You mean you're... \"Master Jeff\"!? \"The World's Greatest Pastry Chef\" Jeff Master the Master Chef...?\nMaster: Yes... I am honored that you have heard of me. All my fans call me \"Master Jeff\".\nRay: Wowzers! I'm totally star-struck! I can't believe I get to meet Master Jeff!\nGregory: (Raymond seems to know quite a bit about Mr. Master.)\nRay: Master Jeff makes fantastic desserts while putting on a song and dance show!\nRay: Macaroons and waffles ♬ Light and fluffy chiffon cake!\nMaster: Happiness for one and all ♪ The sweetest temptations... There!\nRay: Where?\nMaster: Over there! ♬ Take a peek inside the oven!\n*ding*\nLook! It's freshly baked desserts! ♬\nGregory: ...! (I got caught up in their song myself.)\nRay: Wahooo! I'm so happy that I got to sing with Master Jeff! It's my dream come true!\nMaster: Ho ho... Thank you. I am happy to hear that as well.\nGregory: ...Mr. Master. Raymond. Shall we return to the matter at hand?\nMaster: Yes, of course. My sincerest apologies for making you wait. Now, where should we start?\n(Clearing all \"Talk\" options leads to:)\nGregory: (...I believe I have a sufficient understanding of Mr. Master's personality.) Mr. Master, before I accept your request, there is one final matter I must confirm. You did not kill Mr. Dover. ...Can I take your word for it?\nMaster: Yes. That is correct. I did not kill him. No matter what happens, I would never take another person's life.\nGregory: ..... (Those aren't the eyes of a liar.) I understand. I believe you. Thank you very much for taking the time to talk with us.\nMaster: The pleasure is all mine. I am grateful to speak with someone other than a detective.\nGregory: Next, we shall begin our investigation of the crime scene. ...We will report back with our findings once we have finished.\nMaster: Mr. Gregory, Raymond. I wish you good luck.\nRay: Whew, it sure is cold outside. I didn't expect it to be snowing this hard.\nGregory: Indeed. A blizzard like this will probably not clear up for a while.\nRay: But even so, this mansion is ginormous! So this is what Master Jeff's place is like, huh?\nGregory: If you're going to hold a contest in your own home, you would need this much space, after all.\n???: ♬ La, la, laaa~ Welcome! Thank you for coming! Eek! Oh my! Are you okay? I-I'm so very sorry! Would you happen to be Monsieur Edgeworth?\nGregory: Yes, I am Gregory Edgeworth.\nRay: And I'm his assistant, Raymond Shields!\nKate: Greetings and welcome, Monsieur Edgeworth and Monsieur Shields. Please call me Katherine Hall! I am in charge of the household affairs of this estate, and am also Monsieur Master's assistant.\nRay: Ahhh! No way! You're the famous \"Kate\", aren't you?\nKate: You know of me?\nRay: Of course I do! I see you on TV all the time! I'm a big fan of \"Piece of Cake\"!\nKate: Oh, goodness! I'm glad to hear that you're a fan!\nGregory: ...Tell me, what is this \"Piece of Cake\"?\nRay: It's a TV show that's hugely popular with the kids! Master Jeff and Kate sing and dance while they make delicious treats. Just like this!\nRay: ♪ Cookies and caramel ♬ Rich and feathery cream puffs!\nKate: Let's make it together! ♪ A delectable paradise... Here!\nRay: There!\nKate: Everywhere! ♬ ♪ You just open up the oven!\n*ding*\n♪ Now! It's time for dessert! ♬\nKate: Oh, Monsieur Shields! That was incredible!\nRay: He he he! I always practice along with the show.\nGregory: ..... (Maybe I should tell my son about this show.)\nRay: But man, doing this dance repeatedly sure works up your appetite.\nKate: Ah! Pardon my inconsideration! I've forgotten to take care of our guests! Please relax and have some tea.\nGregory: Oh... This is some fine Ceylon tea... I hear the aroma of citrus does wonders for your concentration.\nRay: I see... So this is what Ceylon tea smells like.\nGregory: Oh? These saucers are chilled.\nKate: Yes. They help cool the tea more quickly for people who are bad with hot beverages.\nGregory: I see... These tea cups also have a wonderful design.\nKate: Oh, thank you very much! They are one of the few pride and joys of our estate, ordered directly from France! They were made by the famed sculptor Pierre Hoquet. They are my absolute favorite articles of tableware.\nGregory: ...You seem to greatly appreciate this man's works.\nKate: Yes! They are like treasures to me.\nGregory: (She appears to be very honest about what she likes.) Thank you, Ms. Hall, but it's time for us to move on to business. Are there any details that you can give us about the incident?\nKate: Ah... You're right. I sometimes get so distracted welcoming guests that I forget myself. To tell the truth, I was the one who discovered Monsieur Dover's body.\nGregory: So you were the first one to discover the body? It is true that the body was discovered in one of Mr. Master's desserts?\nKate: Yes... It was during the judging of the Great Dessert Contest. I heard the sound of something breaking from Monsieur Master's room.\nKate: ...Monsieur Master? Are you in here? Eek...!\nKate: When I looked inside the room, I saw Monsieur Dover's body inside the treasure chest...\nGregory: ...Thank you very much. I'm sorry to have made you recall such painful memories.\nKate: No... I should be the one apologizing for not being much help.\nGregory: Now then, I believe it's time for us to start investigating the crime scene.\nKate: Monsieur Edgeworth, Monsieur Shields. Please find some way to save Monsieur Master. Monsieur Master is not someone who could commit murder!\nGregory: ...Yes. Of course.\nRay: Just leave it to us!\nKate: Then I shall entrust it to you. If you'll excuse me, I have to continue serving tea to the other inspectors.\nGregory: Raymond, let's head to the crime scene.\nRay: Yes, sir! Mr. Edgeworth!\nRay: Wow! This whole thing is made of chocolate! I can't believe I'm actually seeing Master Jeff's desserts up close!\nGregory: Were this not the scene of a murder, I admit, I too would have delighted in this occasion.\nRay: Uuugh... Now that you've reminded me it's a murder scene, I'm getting shivers down my spine.\nGregory: ...Perhaps it's because this room is cold to begin with?\nRay: Now that you mention it, this room really is cold. *A-ACHOO*\n???: ...Never expected the defense attorney to show up so early.\nGregory: Pleased to meet you. I'm Jeff Master's defense attorney, Gregory Edgeworth. This is my assistant, Raymond.\nRay: How do you do!\nBadd: ...Detective Tyrell Badd. Homicide.\nRay: Mr. Badd, the detective in charge of this case... A man of few words... Mmm... Tastes kinda bitter...\nBadd: He ate... the paper...!\nGregory: He likes to digest his memos in his stomach as well as in his mind... It's just a strange habit of his. Please don't be too concerned. (It would probably be too much to ask him not to be concerned at all...) More importantly... Detective Badd. Will you give us permission to participate in the investigation?\nBadd: ...Permission denied.\nRay: Wh-Why!? Mr. Edgeworth is Master Jeff's defense attorney!\nBadd: Defense attorneys... plant false evidence... to try and get their \"Not Guilty\" verdict. I don't want... their kind to disturb the crime scene...\nRay: Mr. Edgeworth would never use false evidence to defend his client!\nBadd: Heh... I can't trust that, coming from a defense attorney...\nGregory: Do the police still suspect Mr. Master, even after the investigation?\nBadd: .....If we didn't, we wouldn't have arrested him...\nGregory: I believe that Mr. Master is innocent. That's why I have come to investigate.\nBadd: Believing in his innocence... without investigating the crime scene... How naïve...\nGregory: ...That's why I would like your permission to investigate. By investigating the crime scene, I want to ascertain if my thinking was naïve or not.\nBadd: ...Hmph. ...So you don't intend to leave until you've investigated the crime scene...?\nGregory: Yes.\nBadd: ...Tch... Fine then... I will give you permission to investigate the crime scene.\nGregory: ! Thank you.\nBadd: But, I'll be accompanying you. ...I can't trust you defense attorneys, after all! ...If you understand that, you... can begin your investigation.\nRay: That's... a lollipop?\nGregory: (...I'm a little surprised myself.) Alright, let's begin the investigation. Raymond, be sure to take notes on the case.\nRay: Leave it to me, Mr. Edgeworth!\nBadd: Just... begin already...\n(Connecting all possible Logic, examining handprint and counter, talking to sitting forensics, and deducing missing chocolate piece leads to:)\nGregory: It seems our investigation of this room is just about over.\nCrime Scene Notes updated in the Court Record.\nBadd: This should make it clear... Jeff Master is the culprit.\nRay: ! Wh-Why!?\nBadd: All the rooms in this mansion... were locked from the inside. And... the only way to open them from the outside, was to use this key to the mansion...\nGregory: ...Do you know who had the key?\nBadd: Master... was the only one with the key. ...There were no spare keys.\nMansion Key added to the Court Record.\nBadd: By using the mansion key... Master... could enter all the contestants' rooms. Of course... the key could also lock his room from the outside...\nGregory: However, Mr. Master's room is currently unlocked.\nBadd: Yeah... That's why I suspect Master is the culprit...\nGregory: ...I'd like to hear your reasoning in more detail.\nBadd: If the body had been found in a locked room... Master would've been the prime suspect. That's why Master made sure to leave the door to his own room unlocked... And to ensure that the body would be seen... Master broke the lid on the treasure chest. After the judging... everyone was scheduled to meet in Master's room... That would have created the impression... that the murder had occurred... while he was away.\nBadd: Contrary to his expectations... the body was discovered by Ms. Hall... ...That's my reason for suspecting Master. Got that, Ace Attorney?\nGregory: ...So you also think it was Mr. Master himself who vandalized this room?\nBadd: Yeah... You defense attorneys believe that justice lies in trusting your clients... But I'm a detective. If I believed every poor sap's story... I'd let the suspicious ones get away...\nGregory: ...I understand your reasoning thoroughly. However... I'd like you to hear my thoughts on the subjects now.\nBadd: ...Hmph. Fine.\nGregory: (Detective Badd believes that he is right, but I won't give up so easily. I can't accept his reasoning... I'll have to show him evidence that contradicts it!)\nBadd: If the body had been found in a locked room... Master would've been the prime suspect.\nBadd: That's why Master made sure to leave the door to his own room unlocked...\nBadd: And to ensure that the body would be seen... Master broke the lid on the treasure chest.\nBadd: After the judging... everyone was scheduled to meet in Master's room...\nBadd: That would have created the impression... that the murder had occurred... while he was away.\nGregory: Detective Badd seems adamant that Mr. Master is the culprit.\nRay: I don't think Master Jeff would have broken his own creations! But... why was the treasure chest broken then?\nGregory: Hmm... Just think back to the situation in which the body was found. In doing so, we should be able to see the contradiction in Badd's reasoning.\nGregory: Originally, the victim's body was hidden inside the chocolate treasure chest. Ms. Hall entered the room when she heard a sound. I think it is likely that this was the sound of the chocolate ship falling over.\nBadd: Yeah... That's what you would think... just by looking at the crime scene...\nGregory: You said that Mr. Master broke the treasure chest lid himself... ...but, this photo shows that the ship's fall caused the lid to break.\nBadd: .....\nGregory: If the lid broke just before Ms. Hall found the body... ...then Mr. Master, who was in the middle of judging, could not have broken it!\nBadd: I... never said that Master broke the lid directly... The ship was set up to fall during the judging... I believe he tampered with the stand.\nGregory:\nGregory: Do you have proof he tampered with it?\nBadd: No... but the investigation isn't completely over yet...\nGregory: (It seems they still haven't found anything conclusive...) Have you found any other fingerprints, other than Mr. Master's, in this room?\nBadd: ...Yeah. There were some left on the floor.\nGregory: !\nBadd: But... the victim, Dover, and Master were also among the fingerprints left behind.\nGustavia: Before we made our desserts, we all gathered here to have the judging explained to us. Perhaps that was when we left those fingerprints?\nGregory: ...But, you didn't find any fingerprints on the works in this room?\nBadd: ...What...?\nGregory: Someone tampered with the chocolate in this room. So perhaps there are other fingerprints on it, apart from Mr. Master's.\nBadd: ...Hmph. No matter what we find, it won't clear Master of suspicion...\nBadd: .....Labbie! Hurry up and dust the chocolate for fingerprints!\nForensics: Roger that, sir!\nForensics: Detective Badd! We found another person's fingerprints... on all the chocolates in the room!\nBadd: .....! Whose... fingerprints...?\nForensics: They belong to a pastry chef by the name of Delicia!\nBadd: ...Good work... Return to the investigation.\nForensics: Yes, sir!\nGregory: It would seem that there are other suspicious people besides Mr. Master, after all.\nBadd: ...Hmph. I don't need a defense attorney to tell me that... I'm not stopping my investigation... We will just... go and listen to what this Delicia has to say.\nGregory: (Delicia... Gustavia told us about her not long ago. Is she really a \"frightening woman who would do anything to achieve her goal\"?)\nRay: Mr. Edgeworth, this Delicia lady sounds mighty suspicious to me!\nGregory: Mmm. It seems that it will be necessary for us to speak with her directly, as well. Detective Badd. Would you allow us to accompany you?\nBadd: ...I'm not obligated to do that.\nRay: What...!?\nBadd: But... you were the one who discovered the truth of the crime scene... Fine, have it your way. Follow me...\nGregory: Detective Badd...! Thank you.\nForensics: D-Detective Badd, sir! Are you sure about that? Right now, that prosecutor is in the room...!\nBadd: ...Doesn't matter. Him and I... don't see eye to eye.\nRay: \"Him\"...? Who's the prosecutor in charge of this case anyway?\nBadd: ...Manfred von Karma...\nRay: WHAAAAAA! Von Karma is in charge!? That guy hasn't lost a case in 25 years...\nGregory: (Manfred von Karma... The \"living legend\" of the prosecutor's office...? If the rumors of his courtroom performance are to be believed... ...he's a man who would do anything for a guilty verdict. ...No matter what kind of prosecutor he is, I can only hold true to the path I believe in.)\nTo be continued.\nRay: Wow! A candy castle! And there are even some fairies over there!\nBadd: This room... seems to be structured in the same way as Master's room...\nRay: But it's nowhere near as cold!\nBadd: This room... also seems to have been fitted with a temperature control panel...\nRay: Ah, it's over by that that orange lamp, right!?\nGregory: Indeed. Let's not forget to investigate it later. (Even so... this room is like something out of a fairy tale. Is this cream-covered castle Delicia's work?)\nBadd: ...Where is Delicia...?\nDelicia: Oi! Can I help you? Hullo boys! I'm Delicia Scones. In my native England, I'm known as \"Ms. Delicious\"!\nGregory: (Being called a \"boy\" even though I'm already 34... It's certainly a rare experience.)\nRay: B-Boys? I understand you calling me that, but... Mr. Edgeworth!?\nDelicia: As far as I'm concerned, you're all boys to me, even that detective over there.\nBadd: ...My name is... Badd. Not \"boy\"...\nGregory: (Just how old is this woman?)\nBadd: ...Mr. Attorney. Let's just finish our business here.\nGregory: Hmm... Right.\n???:\n???: You! What do you think you're doing!? Conversing with a mere attorney!?\nRay: Mr. Edgeworth! A-A scary man came out of the candy castle...!\nBadd: ...Von Karma...\nRay: Eh! This man is, Prosecutor von Karma...?\nDelicia: Eep! Manny!\nGregory: (So he's Von Karma...) Pleased to meet you, Prosecutor von Karma. My name is Gregory Edgeworth, defense attorney.\nvon Karma: Bah! I have no interest in the names of defense attorneys. After all, they only exist to be crushed by me.\nGregory: (...What a rude man.)\nRay: That piercing gaze and furrowed brow...! Uugh... He's even scarier than the rumors say.\nGregory: (Although that statement was also very rude.) Prosecutor von Karma. Would you allow us to investigate too?\nvon Karma: Hmph. You think I would give information to a mere defense attorney?\nGregory: (As I thought, it won't be that simple...)\nvon Karma: ..... ...However, I'll make a special exception for this room.\nGregory: ! (Why did he change his mind so quickly?)\nvon Karma: You, old bloodhound.\nBadd: ...Don't call me that. ...My name is... Badd.\nvon Karma: Hah! A mere detective, speaking back to me. ...I admire your courage at least. Badd. Stand watch and see to it that they don't misbehave.\nBadd: Why... me...!\nvon Karma: I will not accept your refusal. Well then, I'll be investigating Gustavia's room next.\nBadd: Tch... I'm babysitting again...\nGregory: (I wonder why he and Von Karma aren't investigating together? Instead of being on bad terms, it seems like they hardly know each other...)\nRay: Mr. Edgeworth, now that we've got Von Karma's permission, we can continue investigating!\nGregory: Yes. His manner bothers me, but I am glad we can at least continue the investigation.\nBadd: ...Hold it. I also need to investigate this room... I don't want you disturbing the room... So you'll investigate... after me.\nRay: What!? Aren't you the detective in charge of this case? Why haven't you investigated this room yet?\nBadd: ...The detective in charge of the initial investigation was a close colleague of Von Karma. I came to take over for him, so I only got to this mansion just recently.\nGregory: (So that's why he and Von Karma aren't investigating together...) Detective Badd. Will you allow us to investigate with you like before? In doing so, you'll be able to supervise us and also ensure we don't tamper with anything.\nBadd: You want me to watch you? ...You're a strange lawyer. ...Hmph. I'll let you stick around... a little longer.\nRay: Yay! You did it, Mr. Edgeworth!\nGregory: Thank you, Detective Badd.\nBadd: ...But if I decide you're holding up the investigation, you'll have to leave...\nGregory: Yes... I understand. Well then, let's begin the investigation.\n(Connecting hexagon Logic and examining blue cloth rolls leads to:)\nGregory: (The \"blue cloth\" and the \"rocks\" inside the castle... I wonder if they belong to Delicia?) Delicia. Those things in the castle, what are they used for?\nDelicia: Ah... uhh, those? I'm afraid I can't tell you.\nBadd: ...Looks like Von Karma is... keeping her silent...\nDelicia: Eep! I've been found out... He'll get made at me if I talk.\nGregory: (Prosecutor von Karma... doesn't intend on being upfront with his information.)\nRay: Aww... it's such a shame. We finally figured out where the rocks are supposed to go.\nDelicia: ! Could it be that you're interested in my goods?\nRay: Eh? Your \"goods\"...?\nDelicia: Those are my popular relaxation goods.\nGregory: You mean... the rocks and the cloth?\nDelicia: Yessie! That's right! You see, they're not actually rocks, but special lamps made from rock salt.\nRay: Wow! So those are lamps!\nDelicia: Ha ha ha ha! It gets even more exciting! Because, this cloth also has an amazing secret!\nGregory: (As soon as we showed interest in her goods, she became quite talkative.)\nDelicia: Since we've got them out, come experience the therapy, boys. Baddie! Could you put everything up!\nBadd: It's... not Baddie, it's Badd...\nDelicia: ...So you won't do it? Is Baddie being a bad boy?\nGregory: .......\nBadd: ...Labbie! Are you done photographing this room?\nForensics: Yes, sir! I am!\nBadd: ...Then go help Delicia...\nForensics: Yes, sir! I'm on it!\nDelicia: Ha ha ha ha! Thanks! I knew you were a good boy underneath, Baddie!\nRay: Ms. Delicious... That was amazing. You even persuaded Detective Badd!\nDelicia: Thanks a lot, Baddie! And you too, Forensies!\nRay: ...She even gave the forensics a nickname.\nGregory: I think that's her way of showing she cares.\nBadd: What's so... therapeutic... about these things anyway?\nDelicia: We don't have time for that now, Baddie! The show's about to begin! Forensies! Finishing touches, please!\nForensics: Yes, ma'am!\nBadd: It's...\nRay: Wow, It's so beautiful!\nGregory: It really is... (I wish my son could see this.)\nDelicia: Oi! I told you so, right? \"The Four Fairies and the Curious Candy Castle\" was the theme of my work. It's so sparkly and cute, right?\nGregory: (It seems like... one of them is missing something.)\nDelicia: The truth is, I had planned to unveil it during the contest. Well, I'm glad I got to show it to you boys!\nRay: Huh? But it doesn't look like the rock salt lamps are lighting up.\nDelicia: H-Huh? I wonder why...?\nGregory: (I think I'll need to examine... the rocks and the fairies again.)\n(Connecting all possible Logic and examining fairy on right leads to:)\nBadd: That's enough... investigating...\nGregory: Hmph... We've found much more than I expected. (And yet, something from before still bothers me. Prosecutor von Karma must have found the murder weapon in this room... So then, why did he let Delicia be? First, I must ascertain Von Karma's true motives...!) Detective Badd. I would like to ask Prosecutor von Karma something.\nBadd: ...I've also got business with him... And Delicia there too...\nDelicia: Eep! What's the idea, Baddie? Don't glare at me like that.\nGregory: (It seems Detective Badd also has his doubts about Delicia and Von Karma.) Delicia, would you come with us for a moment?\nDelicia: Yessie! That's... fine. What for?\nGregory: ...We have to find Von Karma. There are some things we need to talk about.\nGregory: Prosecutor von Karma. We need to talk about the case.\nvon Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... From the look on your face, I assume you've found the murder weapon?\nGregory: Yes... We discovered the murder weapon in Delicia's room. ...It would seem Mr. Master isn't the only suspect in this case.\nvon Karma: Bah... That's not true. Where the murder weapon was found does not change the fact that Master is the culprit. ...As long as I am here.\nGregory: (Why is Von Karma so sure of himself...?) Well then, aren't you going to explain? Why the murder weapon was in Delicia's room!\nvon Karma: Hmph... Naturally. If you wish to know, I'll tell you.\nvon Karma: In order to pin the crime on Delicia, Master used the rock salt lamp to kill the victim. He then deposited the murder weapon in Delicia's room. If he had left the murder weapon at the crime scene, Master would have been the one suspected. He couldn't move the body, but it was easy to move the murder weapon. Ergo, there would be no evidence pointing to a specific culprit at the crime scene.\nGregory: Mr. Master took the rock salt lamp...?\nvon Karma: ...Precisely. I carried out the investigation myself... There can be no room for doubt.\nGregory: Do you have evidence that he moved it?\nvon Karma: ...Hmph. That will not be necessary.\nGregory: Wha...!\nvon Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... If you have an objection, say it. Do you think a mere defense attorney can break my logic!?\nvon Karma: In order to pin the crime on Delicia, Master used the rock salt lamp to kill the victim.\nvon Karma: He then deposited the murder weapon in Delicia's room.\nvon Karma: If he had left the murder weapon at the crime scene, Master would have been the one suspected.\nvon Karma: He couldn't move the body, but it was easy to move the murder weapon.\nvon Karma: Ergo, there would be no evidence pointing to a specific culprit at the crime scene.\nGregory: (It seems Von Karma won't be shaken easily. I'll just have to present evidence that contradicts his reasoning...!)\nGregory: It's true that the murder weapon and bloodstains disappeared from the vicinity. However, there was still one piece of incriminating evidence left behind! Have a look at this photograph, which was taken when the body was first discovered. This cloth was used to wrap the body... Doesn't it remind you of the fluorescent cloth from Delicia's room?\nDelicia: Eep! My fluorescent cloth was at the crime scene?\nvon Karma: Hah! Fluorescent cloth...? You! Just what part of this cloth is fluorescent!?\nRay: I guess Von Karma doesn't know about this cloth's secret.\nGregory: It looks like a normal cloth at first glance, but if you use this rainbow light device... ...you can make it glow!\nvon Karma: .....!\nRay: Prosecutor von Karma... seems a little surprised.\nGregory: (I don't think it was the cloth's ability to glow that surprised him...) ...One sheet of this fluorescent cloth is currently unaccounted for. Now, I'd like you to look at the color of the cloth in this photo. Don't you think it looks like the color of the fluorescent cloth before it's been lit up?\nvon Karma: .....Hmph.\nGregory: Both the rock salt lamp and the fluorescent cloth originally belonged to Delicia. Wouldn't it be natural to assume that this cloth was used to wrap the body?\nvon Karma: .....\nGregory: ...Prosecutor von Karma. I believe the present conditions give us much reason to suspect Delicia.\nDelicia: Eep! Hold it, Greggy! Do you really suspect me?\nGregory: I don't yet know if you are the culprit. But, it is true that you're hiding something. Am I right?\nDelicia: Uu... That's...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma: ...So. You're saying that the murder weapon and the cloth were originally from Delicia's room?\nGregory: Yes.\nvon Karma: Tsk tsk tsk...!\nGregory: ...What's so funny?\nvon Karma: Just as I expected from you! The murder weapon and the cloth are not from her room. How unfortunate, for you.\nGregory: ...! (What does he mean...!?)\nvon Karma: Before the contest began, Master noticed her violation of the rules. He confiscated the cloth and the rock salt lamp, and kept them in his room for safekeeping!\nGregory: Wha...!\nvon Karma: The victim was not seen, as he stayed locked up in his room after the contest had begun. The only one who could have unlocked the locked rooms was Jeff Master. And the murder weapon, the rock salt lamp, was being kept in Master's room. This should be the decisive evidence in proving Master's guilt! Defense attorney. You've lost to me before you even had a chance to stand in court!\nGregory: ..... (Ngh... What's this!)\nRay: Wh-What? Was all our investigating for nothing... Ms. Delicious! Why didn't you tell us about your confiscated items?\nDelicia: Uuh... Well... Manny said I'd look suspicious if I did!\nRay: Prosecutor von Karma...?\nDelicia: And it's true, you all suspect me, don't you!\nGregory: ...!\nvon Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... How clumsy of you, defense attorney.\nGregory: (Von Karma...! So that's why he let us investigate Delicia's room!)\nvon Karma: And in your clumsiness, there's one more thing I need to inform you of. Two sets of fingerprints were found on the murder weapon.\nGregory: Two...?\nvon Karma: Yes... They belong to Jeff Master and Delicia Scones. No other fingerprints were found.\nGregory: .....\nvon Karma: After Master killed Dover with the confiscated rock salt lamp... ...he foolishly concealed the murder weapon bearing his own fingerprints in its owner's room. Tsk tsk... I don't even need to prove my case in court. I have more than enough perfect evidence to prove Master's guilt.\nGregory:\nGregory: Hold it! I still have some doubts about the fluorescent cloth found in Mr. Master's room.\nvon Karma: Bah! Irrelevant. After disposing of the body, he intended to return it to Delicia's room.\nGregory: ...Ngh...! (I don't have enough information to refute Von Karma's reasoning...)\nvon Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... Nothing left to say? If your job is done, leave this place!\nRay: Th-That's!\nGregory: (I can't give up yet...)\nvon Karma: Hmph! We've wasted enough time as it is. Badd, take them away!\nBadd: There are still... some doubts left in our investigation.\nGregory: Detective Badd...!\nvon Karma: ...What's the meaning of this?\nBadd: It's not my nature... to leave any doubts behind. There is still one piece of evidence... that has yet to be identified.\nGregory: .....! (That's right... there are still the traces someone left behind!)\nvon Karma: Bah! Talk about your doubts as much as you want later. But... this, my dear attorney, is none of your business.\nGregory:\nGregory: No. I also have some doubts about one piece of evidence. It's likely... That I have the same doubts Detective Badd has.\nvon Karma: What...?\nGregory: (This is the piece of evidence left in Mr. Master's room that has yet to be identified!)\nGregory: Somebody left gloved fingermarks on one of Mr. Master's desserts.\nvon Karma: .....\nGregory: If these were the killer's fingermarks... ...then it's possible that the killer also didn't leave any fingerprints on the murder weapon!\nvon Karma: .....How did you know the state of the crime scene?\nBadd: ...I gave them... permission to investigate...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma: Badd! What possessed you to let a defense attorney into the crime scene!?\nBadd: I don't recall... you telling me not to let them in...\nvon Karma: Bah... Such impudence! ...You'd best remember, Badd... Your salary review depends on me!\nBadd: *gulp*...!\nRay: ...This isn't good for Badd. I'm so glad I have a kind boss like Mr. Edgeworth!\nGregory: (Your salary review depends on how you perform here...)\nvon Karma: Hmph... I'm surprised at what a mere attorney like you managed to uncover in such a short time. ...However, it's possible those fingermarks were Master's own thing. Because he always wore gloves while cooking!\nGregory:\nGregory: Do you have evidence that those fingermarks were left by Master? And moreover... there are still a few points of suspicion surrounding Delicia.\nvon Karma: Oh...? You still haven't give up on that?\nDelicia: Uuh... Greggy. You still suspect me? I've already apologized for stealing a few bites...!\nGregory: ...I don't want to suspect you. However, I can't easily trust those who tell lies. You must still be hiding something!\nDelicia: Uuh... Greggy is a bully...\nGregory: Don't you know the temperature fresh cream must be kept at? You call yourself a dessert chef, but you lack even the most basic knowledge.\nDelicia: Uuh... I'm sorry. For my lack of knowledge...\nGregory: In your case, it's not even about the lack of knowledge. In truth... you don't even know how to make desserts, do you?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma: Defense attorney! Stop trying to force your own reasoning. ...In a court of law, the evidence tells all. If you say the witness is lying, show it with evidence!\nGregory: We're not in court yet, but... very well. This evidence shows that Delicia can't make desserts.\nGregory: The only things Delicia made were those that broke the rules.\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma: The lamp and cloth that broke the rules were being held in Master's room. There is no way the witness could have returned them to her room!\nGregory:\nGregory: Those were not the only fake desserts she made.\nvon Karma: .....What?\nGregory: Her desserts may look like something out of a fairy tale at first glance... ...but in reality, they are nothing but mannequins, decorated with cream. Apart from the cream, they're all fake!\nvon Karma: ...!\nGregory: This is not something one aiming to become the world's greatest pastry chef would do.\nvon Karma: ...Is this true, Badd?\nBadd: Yes... My shoes... can attest to that...\nvon Karma: .....\nRay: Will that be enough to convince Prosecutor von Karma?\nGregory: (Once he sees what Delicia has done, he'll have no choice but to be convinced.) Delicia... The fact that your actions could lead to you being a suspect is no laughing matter.\nDelicia: Th-That's! I didn't murder...!\nGregory: ...Isn't it time you told us the whole truth? Who are you? And why were you indulging yourself in another contestant's work!?\nDelicia: ...Yessie... I understand.\nDelicia: The truth is... I'm not really a dessert chef, like I led you to believe. I'm actually a pharmacist.\nRay: What! A pharmacist?\nGregory: (That's a completely different occupation... It's no wonder he couldn't hide his surprise.) Why is a pharmacist like you participating in this contest?\nDelicia: ...I just love eating desserts. I joined because I thought I'd be able to eat some of Jeffy's desserts. I never thought I'd end up making it to the finals.\nvon Karma: .......\nGregory: (...Even Prosecutor von Karma is at a loss for words.)\nRay: S-So that's the real reason why you entered the contest?\nDelicia: Yessie... As expected, Jeffy's desserts were oh-so-good.\nBadd: So... The gloved fingermarks on the picture frame... were your doing?\nDelicia: Eep! No way! I never wore gloves!\nGregory: Delicia's fingerprints were found on Mr. Master's chocolates. So it is true that she wasn't wearing gloves.\nDelicia: Yessie! Exactly! You do believe me, Greggy!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma: ...Is your face stuffed with nothing but desserts!?\nDelicia: Eep! Sorry, Manny.\nGregory: (...I think it's her belly that's stuffed.) Were Master's desserts all that you ate?\nDelicia: ...Actually, no. After the afternoon tea, I also ate Icy's desserts...\nGregory: ! You mean you entered the victim's room?\nDelicia: Yessie! Exactly. The room was empty after all.\nGregory: (Perhaps the victim was already dead by then...)\nDelicia: But my first bite tasted way too salty and I couldn't eat it! So, I ate the delicious star-shaped dessert that was nearby.\nRay: Ms. Delicious... You really are a glutton.\nGregory: (Is it rare you see a woman with this kind of appetite.)\nDelicia: That's all I did. Greggy, Manny, everyone... I'm sorry I caused you trouble.\nGregory: Now that you've told us the truth, everything's fine. There's no need to apologize.\nvon Karma: ...This does not mean that your testimony is trustworthy. I'll be investigating the victim's room after this. Only then will I decide if your testimony is true.\nGregory: Prosecutor von Karma. I'd like to go as well. I also need to ascertain whether my reasoning up until now has been correct.\nvon Karma: Hmph...! I'll let you follow, but I have no intention of letting you investigate.\nGregory: ...That's enough for me.\nvon Karma: This...! What is the meaning of this!\nRay: The desserts adorning the victim's room had disappeared without a trace. Was this the true killer's doing? A body that was hidden inside a dessert, and a murder weapon that was moved... Further investigation would be required to arrive at the truth of this case.\nTo be continued.\nRay: ...Oops, I guess I went on for a little too long there.\nEdgeworth: Something like that... happened? I had no idea. None of the case files I read went into such detail.\nRay: Well, I doubt there would be anything in there that would be inconvenient to the prosecution. Especially with that Von Karma at the head.\nEdgeworth: How did the investigation go from there?\nRay: The desserts had disappeared from the victim's room, so the investigation hit a rough patch. Thanks to that, it took about a whole year before a verdict was handed down.\nEdgeworth: One whole year...?\nRay: This was before the whole 3-day pre-trial system was established. Trial didn't need to finish in the short amount of time that they do now.\nEdgeworth: ...I see. Did they ever find out why the victim's dessert disappeared?\nRay: Well, kinda... His dessert was like a candy ice sculpture, made from sherbet... Since it was made from ice, the general consensus was that it had melted. ...However, that might not quite be the case.\nEdgeworth: What do you mean?\nRay: This museum used to be Mr. Master's mansion.\nEdgeworth: The stage of the IS-7 Incident...\nRay: And in this very place, they're exhibiting the \"Sherbet Salon\" from 18 years ago.\nEdgeworth: ! The victim's dessert...?\nRay: Yep. Though it could be just a replica of the original. That's why Uncle Ray had to come today, to check it out. ...And for your old man, too.\nEdgeworth: .....\nRay: Now then! Let's get a move on and check out the room! I'm pretty sure it's over in the \"Winter Palace.\" Hmm... The Winter Palace should be... Huh? It's... locked up. That's odd. They've already opened the museum.\nEdgeworth: ...Mr. Shields. According to the pamphlet we received at the entrance, the Winter Palace is over here.\nRay: Really? I could've sworn it was this one. Alright, let's scoot. We gotta confirm the truth of what happened 18 years ago.\nRay: Man... It's still as cold as ever. Uncle Ray's gonna freeze solid.\nEdgeworth: It seems the \"Winter Palace\" lives up to its name. It's like a freezer in here. (With the light dimmed like this, it's almost as if the room itself is made of ice...)\nRay: I think the control panel for the room temperature is on the back wall. Miles, why don't you check what temperature it's set at for me? Uncle Ray's gonna give the curator a piece of his mind later. It's way too cold in here.\nEdgeworth: Hm... Very well.\nRay: But if you want to look around the room a bit, feel free to stay, or freeze, to your heart's content. I'll get the camera ready. I want to take some pictures of this place and show it to your old man.\nEdgeworth: ...Understood.\n(Examining control panel, ice statues, and ice block on right leads to:)\nRay: Alrighty, now that I've got some pictures of this room, let's check out the other places. Might as well see them all, since we're already here.\nEdgeworth: ...I suppose you're right.\n???: AAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!\nEdgeworth: ! That yell just now...!\nRay: It came from the Fountain Patio! Let's go, Miles!\nEdgeworth: (There's someone passed out on the floor! And that man there is...!) Larry! What are you doing here!? No, I'm getting ahead of myself. What exactly happened here?\nLarry: E-Edgeyyyyy! I... I saw something that no one should ever have to see! Agaaain!\nEdgeworth: Larry, calm down! Why is there someone passed out here?\nLarry: I-I didn't do anything! He just fell down all of a sudden!\nRay: ! This man... He can't be...!\n???: Excuse me, but what is the matter here?\n???: You can't raise such a ruckus in the museum, boys.\nEdgeworth: Hm? This scent is...!\nRay: Seems like he's still breathing, but this is a bad situation...! Miles, it's not safe here! Get everyone out of here!\nEdgeworth: Everyone, get away from that room right now! There's... poison gas coming out from it!\nEdgeworth: Hmm. Mr. Shields. How is the victim?\nRay: It looks like he breathed in a little too much of that poison gas... He's still unconscious. According to the doctor in the ambulance, there are no external injuries or any other wounds. Thanks to our fortunate timing, we were able to save him before he was too far gone... ...but he's not out of the woods yet. He's currently being treated by a specialist in the infirmary.\nEdgeworth: I see... Mr. Shields, is he an acquaintance of yours?\nRay: Yeah, you could say that. He's Dane Gustavia. He was involved in the IS-7 Incident.\nEdgeworth: The pastry chef? (So he was involved in the case 18 years ago.)\nRay: At least the other guy is doing alright. Is he a friend of yours, Miles?\nEdgeworth: ...Yes, you could say that. It is unfortunate you were not hurt, Larry.\nLarry: What's \"you could say that\" supposed to mean, Edgey!? How could you treat a childhood friend like that? That's just cruel! And also, when I'm dressed like this, I'm called Laurice Deauxnim, y'know. So don't call me \"Larry,\" It's \"Laurice!\"\nEdgeworth: (This man is Larry Butz. He's nothing but trouble, but he's been one of my friends since grade school. Some time ago, he awakened to the calling of art and assumed the alias \"Laurice Deauxnim\"... ...but a Butz by any other name would smell just as much.)\nRay: Really? You two are childhood friends? I better report that to your old man, too. I'm sure it will bring him joy. He was always worried about you not being able to make friends.\nLarry: Good for you, Edgey! Aren't you glad to have a bosom buddy like me?\nEdgeworth: (My father was worried about something like that...?) But anyway, what are you doing in a place like this, Larry?\nLarry: How many times do I have to tell you, Edgey!? I'm \"Laurice\"!\nEdgeworth: What. Are you doing. In a place. Like this!?\nLarry: Yikes! Don't glare at me when you talk!\nEdgeworth: So are you going to tell me?\nLarry: Isn't it obvious? I've come here to study art! I'm going to take Mandy on a date here, so I was just doing some scouting beforehand!\nEdgeworth: (Aren't you just using art as an excuse to go on a date...?)\nRay: Not bad, Laurice! Maybe you can introduce some pretty girls to me next time.\nLarry: Oh, now you're talkin' my language, dude!\nEdgeworth: (...I think I'm getting a headache.)\nRay: By the way, Laurice... Did you notice anything strange when you found the victim?\nLarry: Nah... not really.\nEdgeworth: Nothing that would make you say, \"I saw something that no one should ever have to see\"?\nLarry: Oh, yeah... That. I was just surprised when I saw that old dude fall down out of nowhere like that. I didn't do anything this time, for once!\nEdgeworth: ...Is that anything to brag about!?\n???: Visitors, we wish to deeply apologize for the disturbance. I am the curator of this museum. My name is Katherine Hall.\nEdgeworth: (She's also one of the people involved in the IS-7 Incident...!)\nRay: Hello there, Ms. Kate.\nKate: Monsieur Shields, thank you for your continued assistance.\nEdgeworth: (She was the woman we saw at the reception. So she's the curator here...)\nKate: We apologize for the inconvenience, especially since it's the opening day...\nRay: No, no. You don't have to apologize for a thing, Ms. Kate. Ah... I almost forgot. Let me introduce you to someone. This is Miles Edgeworth. ...He's Gregory Edgeworth's son.\nKate: Oh! Monsieur Edgeworth's...! ♬ Oh! How wonderfuuuuuul! I meeeet the soooooon... Afteeer eighteeeeen years...! ♪ ♪ It is an honor to meet youuu! Deefeensee attooorneyyyy Miles Edgewooooooorth! ♬\nRay: Wow, that was amazing! You still got that golden voice, Ms. Kate.\nEdgeworth: ...Actually, I'm a prosecutor.\nKate: Oh, so you are a prosecutor? My most sincere apologies, Monsieur Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth: (This woman is very polite, but... slightly odd.)\nLarry: U-Uh... Katey! Could I get your autograph right here, pretty please?\nKate: Yes... if you so desire.\nEdgeworth: Why do you want her autograph?\nLarry: Hey! Don't tell me... You don't know who she is?\nRay: My, my. You really don't keep up with the entertainment news, do you, Miles?\nEdgeworth: (What...? What is this unbearable atmosphere!?)\nRay: She's a superstar actress who's been in tons of musicals and movies. She's a great singer too.\nKate: *giggle*... Currently, I am the curator of this museum. I have already retired from the stage. I finished filming my role for my last movie a few days ago. My costars also said that they would come here once I opened the doors. ...And here you are, Monsieur Artiste. I return this to you.\nLarry: Thanks a bunch, Katey! I'll treasure it for the rest of my life!\nRay: Well, well. Looks like me and Laurice share the same interests.\nEdgeworth: (...So I gathered.) Larry, you said you're here to study art. Why don't you practice drawing as well? ...Since you're here at Ms. Hall's art museum.\nKate: Oh! It would be an honor to have Monsieur Artiste sketch our exhibits.\nLarry: Oh, I guess even you have some good ideas every now and then, Edgey! I'll do a bit of sketching for Katey here!\nKate: Hee hee... what an amusing person.\nEdgeworth: ...Forgive the disturbance. Incidentally, who was the woman that was with you earlier?\nKate: That was Madame Delicia Scones. She is currently assisting in the treatment of Monsieur Gustavia in the infirmary. Even though I said \"infirmary\", since this is an art museum now, it is only provisional. As I am the only staff member working here, I cannot take a leave of my duties for too long.\nEdgeworth: Delicia Scones... I believe we have heard that name before, Mr. Shields.\nRay: Yep. Looks like the whole gang from the IS-7 Incident is here. Well. ...I doubt that's a coincidence.\nEdgeworth: ......\nKate: ...Monsieur Shields. Monsieur Edgeworth. Would you care for some hot tea?\nRay: Oh! Ms. Kate's tea. That takes me back.\nEdgeworth: ...Yes, if you please.\nKate: Now, I must take my leave. I must explain the situation to the other visitors.\nRay: Alright, thanks for everything.\nEdgeworth: (This smells like... Ceylon tea. I should drink it before it cools.) Oh... This Ceylon tea is of very high quality. And this aroma of citrus...\nRay: \"Does wonders for your concentration,\" right?\nEdgeworth: !\nRay: He he he, your old man said the exact same thing 18 years ago. But the saucers back then were chilled. Today they're warm.\nEdgeworth: ...Hmm. A-Anyway... Don't you think this current situation is rather unusual?\nRay: You mean how everyone involved in the case 18 years ago has gathered at this museum?\nEdgeworth: Yes. I would like to be in charge of this case, if at all possible...\nGumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth, sir! Are you OK!?\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth! Mr. Shields! I came here as fast as I could when I heard that you were done in by the poison gas!\nRay: Ohh! My sweet honey Kay! How about a hug after being parted for so long?\nKay: No. Geez! So you're perfectly fine? I can't believe you made us worry so much!\nEdgeworth: Detective Gumshoe... What is the meaning of bringing Kay here?\nGumshoe: I-I'm sorry, sir! I knew the gas was dangerous, so I tried to stop her... But no matter how much I ran and ran and and ran and ran, I couldn't gain any ground...\nKay: ...He he heh, when it comes to running away, no one is faster than the Yatagarasu!\nEdgeworth: (But you weren't running away from here...)\nGumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth, I'm all set, sir! I'll start investigating the crime scene! Since there might still be traces of gas in the room, I'll have to ask everyone to wait here.\nEdgeworth: Very well. I'm counting on you.\nRay: Good luck in there, flatfoot!\nKay: Wow. Gummy's so cool! He's just like a detective!\nEdgeworth: (...But that's what he is...)\nEdgeworth: ...Yes, Edgeworth here.\nGumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! It looks like the poison gas has dissipated, sir!\nEdgeworth: Detective, calmly explain the state of the Autumn Palace.\nGumshoe: Yessir! I'll start with the exhibits. On the left, there's a statue with two people. And on the right, there's a statue of an animal with two horns.\nEdgeworth: (A statue of two people and a statue of an animal with horns... Isn't that the exact same thing I saw in the Winter Palace just a while ago...?)\nGumshoe: Also, the room is wet with water thanks to the sprinkler system! That also prevented the gas from harming everyone else.\nEdgeworth: The sprinkler system... Was there a fire in the room?\nGumshoe: There are no signs of a fire, and the fire alarm hasn't gone off either, sir. The sprinklers in this museum are the kind that detects both smoke and fire. If it detects smoke, it will send an alert to the security room. I think the poison gas might have set off the alarm in the security room, sir.\nEdgeworth: Was there anyone in the security room at the time?\nGumshoe: The only one working here is the curator, Ms. Katherine Hall, sir. She has been in the reception booth, opposite the security room ever since the museum opened.\nEdgeworth: Did Ms. Hall turn on the sprinklers?\nGumshoe: The sprinkler system can only be operated manually from the security room, sir. If it had been automatic, it would have sprayed water all over the exhibits. Since the system is manual, the situation can be examined and the exhibits moved if need be.\nEdgeworth: (I guess there would be more priority over the exhibits than the building. Only at a museum.)\nGumshoe: Brrrr... But it's way too cold in this room, sir! Isn't this supposed to be the Autumn Palace? It feels more like the dead of winter in here!\nEdgeworth: The Autumn Palace... is \"cold\"?\nGumshoe: I checked the thermostat earlier, and it was set to 27℉! I couldn't believe it!\nEdgeworth: (Why would the Autumn Palace be set to the same temperature as the Winter Palace...?)\nGumshoe: That's about all I know for now, sir. If I figure out anything else, I'll give you another call!\nEdgeworth: I see. I'm counting on you, Detective.\nKay: What did Gummy say?\nEdgeworth: ...He said it feels more like winter in the Autumn Palace.\nKay: ? I don't get it!\nEdgeworth: I haven't been able to enter the room personally... ...but it should be possible to look inside ater the police have finished investigating.\nRay: Hmm. I'd like to know what it's like in there myself.\nKay: Isn't there anyone else who knows about the incident?\nRay: Aah! There is someone! Miles' friend, right!\nKay: Friend...?\nEdgeworth: (Though he's such a nuisance, we have no choice but to listen to what he has to say for now...)\nKay: Wait, you mean...!\nLarry: Oh! You're here too Kay! You're looking as cute as ever!\nKay: Eheheh. Long time no see! It's Larry... isn't it!\nLarry: ...Kay, right now my name is \"Laurice\"... I'm an artist, that's why.\nKay: Ah, so that's your pen name! Laurice, the artist formerly known as Larry!\nLarry: Wow, you really are a good girl, Kay! ...Nothing like Edgey here.\nEdgeworth: ..... Larry. I have many things I need to ask you.\nLarry: What's this! Don't tell me you suspect me again! You're gonna say because I was first on the scene, I must be the culprit, aren't you!?\nEdgeworth: ...I never said anything like that. I only want you to tell me what you saw. You said you \"saw something that no one should ever have to see\", did you not?\nLarry: BUUUUT! Now I'm saying I didn't see nothing, and I didn't do nothing! ....Probably.\nRay: Oh my, he didn't seem so confident at the end there.\nEdgeworth: ...There are somewhat troublesome circumstances surrounding this man. The saying \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz\" still holds true, 26 years on. One could say his tendency to attract trouble is legendary. (It seems he's done something troublesome, without even realizing it himself... ...I'll just have to try and extract the truth from him.)\nEdgeworth: My goal is to expose whatever Larry is hiding. However...\nLarry: I didn't see nothing, I didn't do nothing!\nEdgeworth: (Larry is an extremely restless and troublesome man. Until he cools down, I'll just wait and see.) First, I'll ask him about his goal. This isn't something I can't handle. I'll finish this quickly.\nEdgeworth: What was your purpose for coming to the art gallery?\nLarry: What!? Are you saying that I don't belong in an art gallery!?\nEdgeworth: ......\nLarry: Hey! If you're not gonna talk, hold that pose so I can paint your portrait! And then, I'll scribble all over the portrait I drew of you.\nEdgeworth: .........\nLarry: I-I was just joking. I would never scribble over my paintings, of course. They're works of art, after all!\nEdgeworth: I don't think any of your works would qualify as \"art\".\nLarry: Don't look down on me! There are people who recognize my skills as an artist!\nEdgeworth: ........\nLarry: Mandy is my girlfriend, but it's really my paintings she fell in love with! That's why, I'll sketch anything my girlfriend likes!\nEdgeworth: Then, why are you here on your own today?\nLarry: So what! Can't a guy with a girlfriend spend some time alone!?\nEdgeworth: ........\nLarry: Mandy said she's a Gemini. I thought she'd be happy if I showed her a sketch of it on our next date.\nEdgeworth: Do you really have that much confidence in the sketch?\nLarry: Well... I'm not so confident about this one. But I thought she would be happy... if I did a sketch of her astrological sign.\nEdgeworth: Hmph... I see. That's just like you. To impress Mandy, you came here to see the Gemini Sculpture, didn't you?\nLarry: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAT! How'd you find out!?\nEdgeworth: Because you just unknowingly told me everything!\nLarry: W-Well then, I'm not saying another word from now on!\nEdgeworth: He's finally decided to remain silent. In that case, I'll be more relentless in my questioning. I'll try to find out what he was doing here at the art gallery. I'll expose his true motives. This shouldn't take long!\nEdgeworth: You... just what did you do in this art gallery!?\nLarry: Wh-What's with that glare...!? I-I don't really remember anything. I didn't have a pamphlet... so I just loitered around the Fountain Patio.\nEdgeworth: Don't they give you a pamphlet at the reception booth after you pay the admission fee?\nLarry: Huh? Oh... is that right? So... the admission wasn't free, huh...?\nEdgeworth: Don't tell me... you sneaked in here without paying!?\nLarry: I'm sooooooooorry! I-I didn't mean to do anything bad! I-It's just... there was no one at the reception booth... That's why... I thought you could come in here for free!\nEdgeworth: Ms. Hall wasn't at the reception booth?\nLarry: Yeah. It didn't look like there was anyone on the other side of the desk.\nEdgeworth: Come to think of it... Gumshoe did say something about that. Ms. Hall was busy activating the sprinklers from the security room. Because of the incident, she had to leave the reception booth.\nLarry: Poor Katey... She went to all that trouble to open up the palace. And now, the art gallery's star attraction, the \"Winter Palace\" is completely ruined...\nEdgeworth: You're certainly well-informed about the Winter Palace, for someone without a pamphlet. The Winter Palace is where your goal, the Gemini Sculpture, is located... You had your sights set on the Winter Palace from the beginning, didn't you?\nLarry: Whaaaaaaaat? H-How'd you find me out again!? That's right! My goal was to see the Gemini Sculpture! From the very beginning, the Winter Palace was the very reason why I came here!\nEdgeworth: He confessed quite easily... You can never tell anything with this man. Next, I'll ask for further information regarding the Winter Palace. ...He may still have some fight left in him. I'll watch his reactions, and extract the information I need!\nEdgeworth: Perhaps I should try using that clue...?\nEdgeworth: You came here to sketch the sculpture for your girlfriend, did you not? I don't think you would give up that easily! Even after the victim collapsed, you could still see inside the room from the outside, right?\nLarry: W-Well, I may have gotten a tiny glimpse, but... ...there's no evidence... that I saw something scary in there, right...?\nEdgeworth: My, my... I'm disappointed it turned out to be this simple. Larry. You saw \"something scary\" at the crime scene, didn't you!?\nLarry: U-Uw-waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Edgey! You! Can you read my mind!? In that case... there's no point in keeping any more secrets from you!\nEdgeworth: ...You just told me everything of your own accord. That was a complete waste of time, but, finally... It's checkmate.\nLarry: I had my eyes fixed on the Gemini Sculpture...!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: You've mentioned the Gemini Sculpture many times now, but... I don't believe the sculpture you saw was the Gemini one.\nLarry: Wh-What!? Was it a mirage then?\nEdgeworth: (Larry mistakenly thought he saw the Winter Palace.) This piece of evidence shows what Larry really saw!\nEdgeworth: Take a look at this pamphlet. In the Autumn Palace... The Pisces, Capricorn, Aries, and Aquarius sculptures are displayed. Incidentally, I can confirm that the Gemini Sculpture is located in the Winter Palace. Therefore, the sculpture you saw could not have been the Gemini one!\nLarry: ......I knew it.\nEdgeworth: (...Hm. I expected him to be a bit more shocked at the news...)\nLarry: I thought it was kinda strange. I know I saw a single goddess. ...And that transformation was no mirage.\nEdgeworth: ...\"Transformation\", you say?\nLarry: Oh! You're curious too, Edgey? Well, nothing for it, guess I'll have to show you!\nEdgeworth: ...Show me? What, exactly?\nLarry: I drew a picture of the very scene I saw back then! But, I really can't believe what I drew.\nKay: Picture, what picture?\nLarry: This one, right here!\nEdgeworth: Wh... What! What is this disturbing picture!? Is that sculpture weeping tears of blood?\nKay: Laurice! ...This picture is scary!\nLarry: Kay! It scared me too! This Gemini Sculpture suddenly transformed into a goddess right before my eyes. I couldn't help but scream.\nEdgeworth: (...So the victim collapsing wasn't what surprised him.) What do you mean when you say \"transformed\"?\nLarry: I don't really understand it myself! The lower half of its body just turned into a fish!\nRay: A fish goddess... That would be the Pisces Sculpture, wouldn't it. In mythology, Pisces represents the fish that a goddess and her son transform into.\nKay: Really! So Pisces isn't just a couple of ordinary fish?\nLarry: Edgey... you don't think that sculpture is cursed, do you? Those tears of blood turned the Gemini Sculpture into a fish.\nEdgeworth: ...Preposterous. You simply mistook the Pisces Sculpture for the Gemini one.\nPisces Sketch data jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay: Oh. You put the sketch in your Organizer?\nEdgeworth: Hmph... Even a sketch like this can be used as scrap paper, after all.\nLarry: How could you!\nRay: But, it's strange. Why did only the lower half of the sculpture transform? Uncle Ray is a bit curious about what went on in the Autumn Palace.\nEdgeworth: (Indeed... I wonder if someone tampered with the Pisces Sculpture.) Yes. Edgeworth here.\nGumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! We've finished searching the room! The poison gas isn't a threat anymore, so you can enter the crime scene!\nEdgeworth: Right. Good work, Detective. ...It seems we can enter the Autumn Palace now.\nRay: Nice timing, Mr. Detective.\nKay: Let's go right now! I wanna see the Pisces Sculpture!\nLarry: If Kay's going, I'm going too.\nEdgeworth: (...I was planning on bringing him along anyway.) Right then, let's proceed to the Autumn Palace.\nEdgeworth: So this is the Autumn Palace... (It certainly does resemble the Winter Palace.)\nGumshoe: I've been waiting, sir! ...Huh? Aren't you... that Harry Butz guy!\nLarry: Wrong! I'm Laurice Deauxnim!\nEdgeworth: .....Never mind that, Detective. Your report, if you please.\nGumshoe: ...Roger that, sir! Err... We discovered a used gas burner during our investigation. The nozzle was still warm when we found it, so it may be related to the incident.\nEdgeworth: ...Hmm. (Was it used to heat something?)\nUsed Gas Burner data jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth: Was that ladder always there on the ground?\nGumshoe: It was probably used by the person who set off the poison gas. The poison gas was released when someone lifted the lid off that glass case, sir!\nEdgeworth: Hm...? ! The Pisces Sculpture...!\nGumshoe: Huh? Seems like you know about it, sir. Well then, do you know what the sculpture next to it is?\nEdgeworth: Since we're in the Autumn Palace, it would probably be the Capricorn Sculpture.\nGumshoe: As expected of Mr. Edgeworth! I thought it was Taurus myself. I was thrown off as it was covered by this weird cloth!\nRay: The fluorescent cloth! I wonder what it's doing here.\nEdgeworth: (Evidence from the IS-7 Incident...!)\nFluorescent Cloth data jotted down in my Organizer.\nGumshoe: No matter what it is or how it got here... The sculptures in this room are all covered with this fluorescent cloth.\nKay: And because they're hidden, it makes me want to see them even more.\nGumshoe: Let's take a look! I'll just get this cloth off.\nKay: Wow! They're beautiful!\nEdgeworth: You don't think... the \"transformation\" Larry saw... Was, in fact, the moment the cloth wrapped around the lower half of Pisces fell...?\nLarry: See, Edgey! It wasn't a mirage or a mistake after all!\nEdgeworth: Ngh...!\nRay: Hey... Miles. There sure is something strange about this room. It looks exactly the same as the Winter Palace we were in just a moment ago.\nEdgeworth: ...Yes. I agree. Perhaps the sculptures were hidden to make it look like the Winter Palace. If you wrap the cloth around the lower half of the Pisces Sculpture, it looks like Gemini.\nRay: Capricorn is a half-fish too. Hide the lower half and it resembles Taurus. The remaining two, which couldn't be altered with trickery, were covered up.\nEdgeworth: The Autumn Palace was made to look like the Winter Palace. So it seems... Mr. Shields. It looks like we'll need to conduct an investigation of the Autumn Palace too.\nEdgeworth: Mr. Debeste and Judge Courtney...!\nDebeste: Hey, hey, hey! You guys again!? This is a problem. You see, this is MY crime scene.\nCourtney: Mr. Edgeworth... it seems my power is insufficient. If you're here, then it would appear that you still haven't understood my warnings.\nEdgeworth: Ngh...!\nCourtney: Furthermore... you know full well your reckless actions will cause trouble for that detective. In the name of the Goddess of Law, I must pass judgement.\nGumshoe: You've got it all wrong, pal! I was the one who asked Mr. Edgeworth to investigate!\nDebeste: Really? Well then, flatfoot, I'll have to do \"that\".\nGumshoe: \"That\"...?\nDebeste: Yeah, \"that\"... err. Right! Cut your salary! Looking forward to your next payday!? I've always wanted to say that!\nGumshoe: Uugh... You're the last person I want cutting my salary, pal.\nEdgeworth: Hold it, Debeste. I am only cooperating with the police as a witness to this incident. ...Detective Gumshoe is not to blame.\nDebeste: Hmmm. So that's how it is. Well then, should I be raising his salary?\nEdgeworth: ...No, that's not what I meant.\nGumshoe: But, it would be really nice to get my salary raised.\nCourtney: Your mercy is deeply moving, Sebastian. But past transgressions must lead to future judgement. Prosecutor Edgeworth, and all in his company. Depart at once from this holy site.\nKay: B-But that's! We only just got here!\nCourtney: The one given the Goddess of Law's blessing for this incident was Sebastian.\nEdgeworth: In other words, Mr. Debeste is the prosecutor in charge of this case...\nDebeste: That's right, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening performance is over! Besides, I've already got my eyes set on the culprit!\nGumshoe: Whaaaaaaat!? Wh-Who, pal?\nDebeste: Well, naturally! ...That artist!\nLarry: M... Me? Hey! What's going on Edgey!\nEdgeworth: Don't ask me. I can't understand his reasoning.\nDebeste: Tsk tsk tsk... If you can't understand how the best prosecutor thinks, it simply shows how inculpable you are.\nEdgeworth: (It seems he doesn't know what \"inculpable\" even means...)\nCourtney: ...That's right, Sebastian. Prosecutor Edgeworth is quite \"incapable\".\nDebeste: Umm. Yes! He's incapable!\nKay: ...She just nonchalantly corrected him.\nDebeste: Don't underestimate my intelligence gathering skills! I just came from the infirmary and asked the doctor there... ...about the cause of the poison gas!\nEdgeworth: ...And what was the cause?\nDebeste: Err. Some \"normal\" substance... What was its name again? H-Hold on a second. I'll call the doctor to make sure.\nCourtney: Since Sebastian is on the phone, I'll answer for him.\nKay: ...In that case why didn't you tell us before he called?\nCourtney: The poison gas was caused by the mixing of two different types of chemicals. Their names are Normallium and Fatallium.\nKay: So, what are those chemicals exactly?\nCourtney: Normallium is a red liquid that's commonly used in everyday products. It can be found in paint and detergent, among other things, but it is not toxic by itself.\nEdgeworth: ...So you're saying that it's a substance readily available to anyone.\nCourtney: Yes. But Fatallium, on the other hand, is not so easy to obtain.\nKay: Its name sure sounds dangerous. What's it used for?\nCourtney: It is the active ingredient of a white pesticide known as Megatoxin X. Fatallium itself also has a deep white color, but it's not readily sold in stores. It's nearly impossible to obtain domestically. Right now, we are looking into how this chemical was obtained.\nPoison Gas data jotted down in my Organizer.\nDebeste: OK! I've finally found out the names of those chemicals!\nEdgeworth: ...Judge Courtney has already told us. We don't need to hear it again.\nDebeste: Eh. ...Fine, then. I'll cut to the chase! You know that Normallium from the poison gas is also used in paint, right? Today, out of everyone who visited the art gallery, the only one carrying paint... ...was that artist!\nLarry: Y-You're treating me as the culprit just because of that!\nDebeste: I object... to the red paint on the palette you're carrying!\nLarry: Hey, Edgey... Don't you think this prosecutor is kind of an idiot?\nEdgeworth: Indeed. Although I've known him for a short time, his logic is always absurd.\nDebeste: Hey! Don't ignore me!\nCourtney: It's alright, Sebastian. They're only doing it because they're afraid of you. Like the first star to appear at night, show us reasoning that shines the best.\nDebeste: The first star shines best... Not bad. Hey, you guys better listen up too!\nDebeste: That artist was the \"first\" to discover the victim, so naturally he's the \"best\" suspect! The poison gas was caused by Normallium, a chemical found in paint, right? As he was carrying paint near the victim, he would've had the \"best\" chance. The paint, along with being the first witness! ...That pretty much proves he's the culprit!\nDebeste: ...So! What do you think, Justine?\nCourtney: ...We cannot ignore the possibility. Well then, Mr. Artist. Please tell us the truth. Did you leave red paint at the crime scene? Or else... Did you cause the poison gas to go off?\nLarry: The only thing I leave behind is my \"bond of love\" with you...\nCourtney: ...Please watch what you say. My gavel is already prepared to declare you guilty.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: Please pay no heed to this man's statements.\nDebeste:\nDebeste: Hey, hey, you guys! Ignoring my reasoning just because it's flawless won't do you any good. Mr. Edgeworth, if you've already admitted defeat, you should take your leave!\nEdgeworth: Hmph. Even though I don't really have time to deal with your ridiculous reasoning...\nDebeste: That artist was the \"first\" to discover the victim, so naturally he's the \"best\" suspect!\nDebeste: The poison gas was caused by Normallium, a chemical found in paint, right?\nDebeste: As he was carrying paint near the victim, he would've had the \"best\" chance.\nDebeste: The paint, along with being the first witness! ...That pretty much proves he's the culprit!\nEdgeworth: It seems he doesn't pay much attention to what other people are saying. There is a clear contradiction in Mr. Debeste's logic.\nKay: Why'd he even bother making the phone call?\nEdgeworth: (I'll finish this quickly. ...This is a waste of time.)\nEdgeworth: Mr. Debeste. Your logic is more akin to a shooting star than a shining star.\nDebeste: He heh. It shines the best like a shooting star, right?\nEdgeworth: ...It may shine brightly for a brief moment, but then it burns itself out. The poison gas originated from inside the glass case of the Pisces Sculpture.\nDebeste: Exactly! So that's where the artist set off the gas, right? He used the Normallium in his red paint!\nEdgeworth: As your senior, let me give you one piece of advice. Listen to the explanations of others. The poison gas was caused by mixing both Normallium and Fatallium together. The Normallium contained in the red paint is not enough by itself.\nDebeste: .....Really? But I thought I heard that \"Normallium caused the fatality\"...\nEdgeworth: ...Don't tell me you just misheard the forensic report!\nDebeste: D-Darn it!\nEdgeworth: By the time Larry discovered the victim, the room was already filled with poison gas. It is time for you to realize how incapable you really are!\nDebeste: Hey! What do you mean by \"incapable\"!?\nKay: You tried to use that word earlier, and you still don't know what it means...\nCourtney: He means to say... you are lacking in ability.\nEdgeworth: Incidetally, \"inculpable\" has a completely different meaning.\nDebeste: .....I get it! You're making fun of me again, aren't you!\nEdgeworth: I am merely saying you were incapable in your investigation.\nCourtney:\nCourtney: Before you insult Sebastian, I still have some doubts about your own statement.\nEdgeworth: ...What kind of doubts?\nCourtney: For all we know, Mr. Artist could have simply entered the Autumn Palace at an earlier time.\nEdgeworth: ...That's...!\nCourtney: Moreover, do you have evidence that the red paint is unrelated to the case?\nEdgeworth: ...The most important thing now is not the red paint. The red Normallium and the white Fatallium... Exactly how were these two substances mixed? I believe that is our main concern.\nCourtney: Naturally. It was Sebastian's job to investigate that. ...Were it not for your interference, we would have found that out by now.\nEdgeworth: I never intended to interfere. On the contrary... I'd like to cooperate.\nDebeste: Don't tell me you're going to say you know the cause of the poison gas?\nEdgeworth: How the poison gas started... I have something that may shed some light on this matter.\nCourtney: Sebastian, do not fall for his bluff.\nDebeste: Come now, it's fine really. Let's hear what he's come up with.\nCourtney: .......If you say so, Sebastian.\nDebeste: Come on, show us! How did the poison gas start?\nDebeste: Surely you're not saying that this was the cause of poison gas?\nEdgeworth: Hmph... It seems even you've noticed it.\nDebeste: Duh! It really stands out!\nEdgeworth: ...Those red tears that Larry saw were undoubtedly Normallium.\nDebeste: Huh? Wait a second! If those were chemicals... Does that mean a ghost set off the poison gas?\nEdgeworth: (...I don't have time to play along with him.) The red tears of Normallium... could not have triggered the poison gas by itself. That red liquid was mixed inside the case to create the poison gas.\nDebeste: What!? Just where do you see evidence that the chemicals were mixed!?\nEdgeworth: That can also be seen in this sketch. Here is the evidence! (Show evidence that the two chemicals were mixed!)\nEdgeworth: A pink liquid can be seen flowing out from under the case of the Pisces Sculpture. This is proof that the two chemicals were mixed!\nDebeste: H-Hold on a second! I still don't get it. How does this show that Normallium and Fatallium were mixed?\nEdgeworth: Since we have a self-proclaimed artist here, I'll let him explain. Larry. You fancy yourself an artist, so you should know about mixing paint, right? ...What do you add to red to make pink?\nLarry: Don't take me for a fool, Edgey! I'll have you know I graduated from middle school! You add white to red to make pink, it's common knowledge! Well, technically there's \"rose pink\", \"baby pink\" and several others...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: That's enough. Now do you understand, Mr. Debeste?\nDebeste: Ah! ...That's how it is! By mixing red Normallium with white Fatallium... ...you get a pink liquid!\nEdgeworth: Yes, exactly. (Took him long enough...)\nDebeste: Hmmm. .....I see.\nKay: It looks like Mr. Debeste finally gets it.\nCourtney:\nCourtney: Prosecutor Edgeworth. You have merely presented one possibility... Do we really know if the color was the result of the two chemicals mixed together? Furthermore, this sketch was drawn by the suspect. I cannot put much faith into it.\nLarry: I just painted what I saw! How could that be a lie!\nCourtney: Mr. Artist. I did not permit you to speak.\nLarry: Ugh... So cold... But that's part of her charm!\nEdgeworth: ...Of course, I intend to bring the truth to light immediately.\nCourtney:\nCourtney: It would not be wise to jeopardize your position even further. Aren't you going to answer my question from before? How do you know that Mr. Artist did not enter the Autumn Palace? If you cannot prove this, there is no room for you to argue any further.\nGumshoe: Hey! Couldn't we find that out if we talked to the victim, pal?\nCourtney: ...The victim, Dane Gustavia, remains unconscious and in critical condition.\nGumshoe: ...Ah, that's right.\nCourtney: Well then, Sebastian will be investigating the crime scene now. All of you, please vacate the premises.\nCourtney: ...If you were to take a stand in court, you'd cause a lot of trouble for the presiding judge. Is there something you would like to say? .....Mr. Artist?\nLarry: Hold your horses, Ms. Cool Beauty!\nCourtney: ...My name is Justine Courtney. Please don't address me by such a strange title.\nLarry: Oh, you finally told me your name. Pleased to meet you, Justy! I'm Laurice Deauxnim! But you can call me Laurice!\nCourtney: ...Mr. Artist. Please get to the point.\nLarry: I just remembered something I haven't had a chance to say yet! When I first got to this room, it was locked, so I couldn't go in. But then, that old dude just suddenly fell through the door!\nCourtney: ...It would appear that the palace rooms can be locked from the inside. But... just because you say it was so, doesn't mean the door was locked. Without proof, your statement holds no value.\nRay:\nRay: Well, why not let Uncle Ray prove it for you.\nCourtney: Wha...!\nRay: After all, we can confirm the room was locked too. Right, Miles?\nEdgeworth: ...Yes. I remember as well.\nRay: Hmm... The Winter Palace should be... Huh? It's... locked up. That's odd. They've already opened the museum.\nEdgeworth: Until the gas outbreak, no one could have entered this room.\nCourtney:\nCourtney: Perhaps the suspect entered the room with the victim during the gas outbreak?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: As you can see, this man did not inhale any of the gas. If you examine his belongings, you'll find he wasn't carrying a gas mask either.\nCourtney: .....Is that so? Well then, I have no choice but to agree.\nEdgeworth: (...? That was easier than I expected.) Anyway... I presume this clears up any suspicion surrounding Larry? ...It seems Mr. Debeste's logic was off once again.\nDebeste: Wah hah hah. Not exactly. I just didn't have enough information, that's all. Therefore, my reasoning was just \"before its time\"!\nKay: He sure has a grand way of saying that things didn't work out for him.\nCourtney: In that case, there is one more suspect who has yet to take the stand. ...Mr. Artist, you are free to go.\nLarry: Huh! But I wanted to talk to you a little more, Justy.\nCourtney: ...Overruled.\nLarry: Your cold demeanor leaves me mesmerized all the more!\nEdgeworth: This other suspect is...\nCourtney: ...a pharmacist by the name of Delicia Scones. It would have been difficult for this artist to obtain the Fatallium from Megatoxin X. ...But a pharmacist may have knowledge of how to do that.\nEdgeworth: !\nCourtney: The court will now take a 10 minute recess. Sebastian. It would be best if we brought her in quickly.\nDebeste: \"Best\" if we brought her quickly? Heh heh. Sounds good, leave it to me! Hey, Flatfoot! Keep up the investigation!\nGumshoe: Ugh... Got it.\nEdgeworth: Don't tell me... Judge Courtney suspected her from the very beginning?\nKay: So Mr. Debeste's logic wasn't any help at all.\nEdgeworth: (Judge Courtney... Just what is she thinking?)\nTo be continued.\nKay: She said it would only be a 10 minute recess. They sure are taking an awfully long time.\nDebeste: Ahem. Sorry to keep you waiting! Prosecutor Debeste presents Ms. Delicia Scones.\nDelicia: Yessie! You called, so here I am! It is I, Delicia Scones, the pharmacist who makes delicious drugs. But you can call me, Ms. Delicious!\nDebeste: And you can call me, \"Mr. DeBestest.\"\nDelicia: Oi! Nice to meet you, Besty!\nEdgeworth: (They've gone straight to nicknames...)\nDelicia: Huh? That boy... reminds me of someone.\nRay: He he he. This is Miles Edgeworth. ...He's Gregory's son.\nDelicia: Yessie! Nice to meet you, Miley.\nEdgeworth: Hmph... Could you please not call me \"Miley.\"\nDelicia: Ha ha ha! Meeting Greggy's boy... I guess it's a sign that I'm getting old.\nEdgeworth: (How old is this woman...?)\nCourtney: Sebastian. isn't there something you'd like to ask Ms. Pharmacist?\nDebeste: Oh. Right, yeah! Ms. Delicious, could you tell us the reason why you came to the gallery?\nDelicia: Yessie! I came to see the curator, Katey! I've been friends with her for 17 years, so I visit her quite often.\nCourtney: Is it true, Ms. Pharmacist, that you also assisted in the treatment of Mr. Gustavia?\nDelicia: I guess you could say that, although I only made the antidote for the doctor.\nKay: Wow! You made the antidote on the spot?\nDelicia: Yessie! As long as I have the right ingredients, I can make any drug easily. The infirmary here is well equipped, you see. Instead of sending him to the hospital in critical condition, we treated him right away. I did all I could do. The rest... depends upon his body's ability to recover.\nDebeste: Do you know the victim, Ms. Delicious?\nDelicia: Yessie... although it's been 18 years since I last saw him. I only knew that he had become a world-famous pastry chef.\nDebeste: Eh! Is the victim that famous?\nDelicia: I heard on the news that he had won a competition for designing desserts.\nRay: That reminds me, I do remember him mentioning something about studying design in Zheng Fa.\nCourtney: Now, let's get down to business. ...Ms. Pharmacist. Are you familiar with the drug, Megatoxin X?\nDelicia: Yessie! It's the drug that's used to kill \"those things\". It's \"mega effective\"! Because the effects are so potent, it's not avaliable to the general public.\nEdgeworth: What are \"those things\" you're referring to?\nDelicia: It's a drug for vanquishing the creatures that strike fear into the heart of a lady! ...The ones that often infest kitchens and the like.\nKay: Ah... I think I know what she's talking about.\nCourtney: So, Ms. Pharmacist. May I ask you one more thing? Do you know what happens when you mix Normallium with Fatallium?\nDelicia: Yessie... I know. It's even written on the warning label for Megatoxin X: \"Hazardous when mixed.\" When the two drugs are mixed together, a chemical reaction occurs and a gas is released. Inhaling a large amount of this gas can cause breathing difficulties... and even death. From the amount of poison gas Gusty breathed in, I think... ...there was probably at least 500 millilitres of each chemical in the gas.\nEdgeworth: (As expected of a pharmacist, she's very well informed.)\nDelicia: Normallium is an adhesive liquid that becomes hot as soon as heat is applied. It also has a red color and a minty fragrance. Due to its low cost, it's used everywhere! Fatallium is a white, watery liquid.\nCourtney: That's enough for now. ...As expected of a pharmacist. You're very knowledgeable.\nDelicia: Yessie! Of course I am. Megatoxin X is one of the chemicals that the company I work for produces!\nEdgeworth: ...!\nDelicia: Ah... But! Not just anyone has access to it! It's so potent as a poison that it couldn't be sold to the public, after all.\nCourtney: Thank you... I think that's all I need to hear.\nEdgeworth: (Does Judge Courtney suspect her? What is she hiding behind that smile...)\nDebeste: Oh? Flatfoot. Have you made progress in the investigation or something?\nGumshoe: Yeah... Let me tell you. The glass case that contained the sculptures can be opened by a mechanism in the lid.\nDebeste: Hmm. What strange cases.\nGumshoe: The temperature in the cases can be lowered down to 0℉. The inside of the Pisces case was set to 27℉, so my hand nearly got stuck to the ice!\nDebeste: Good thing it didn't! ...So then?\nGumshoe: From the lid of the Pisces case... ...we detected slight traces of Normallium!\nDebeste: Ehh! Not bad!\nDelicia: Huh? If the Normallium was in a glass case at a temperature of 27℉, then... ...it would have been frozen to the lid.\nDebeste: Ehh. Really? So... What happened?\nEdgeworth: ...Mr. Debeste. Why don't we try borrowing the power of Kay's Little Thief? I think the circumstances will be easier to understand if we use our \"Mr. Thief.\"\nDebeste: Hmph. So you really want to help me out that much? Fine! I'm not really sure how this all works, but... You, get on with it!\nKay: I hate being bossed around by this guy, but to arrive at the truth, I'll do it!\nCourtney:\nCourtney: ...Stop acting as you please. The Goddess of Law has no need of your power.\nRay: Don't be such a stick-in-the-mud, Courtney-pie! We have approval of the prosecutor in charge, so what's the problem? Could it be, there's something the P.I.C. doesn't want us to find out?\nCourtney: ......That's none of your concern. If you insist on participating in the investigation... ...then, let me check if you're qualified by asking you a question.\nEdgeworth: (...What is she planning?)\nCourtney: Who set off the poison gas? ...If you can answer me that, I'll allow you to work with us.\nRay: ...Well then, Miles. The person who opened the Pisces case and set off the gas... When you think about the circumstances, there's only one person it could have been.\nEdgeworth: Yes... Considering the circumstances, it's clear who it was.\nCourtney: So, please give me your answer. Who set off the poison gas?\nEdgeworth: There was no one in the Autumn Palace, other than the victim, Dane Gustavia. It's hard to believe it could have been anyone but him.\nCourtney: ...It seems that way. Very well, I'll allow you to participate this time. However... If I feel you are a hindrance, I will have to ask you to leave.\nEdgeworth: ...Understood. (But, what I don't understand is why the victim opened that case...)\nKay: So, Mr. Edgeworth. What shall I re-create?\nEdgeworth: Based on the information we've gathered so far, let's re-create the scene before the gas.\nKay: Got it!\nDebeste: Uwaaaah! D-Don't scare me like that!\nCourtney: So, this is the true power of \"Sir Thief\"...\nEdgeworth: Let's investigate the Pisces Sculpture posthaste. There's frozen Normallium on the lid of the Pisces Sculpture's glass case.\nKay: It's frozen so thick you can't even open the lid!\nGumshoe: On the actual glass case, the lid was heavily cracked... It was like someone had it out for the Pisces Sculpture, sir!\nEdgeworth: ...Do you have any idea how it came to be cracked like this?\nGumshoe: Hmm... Well, the damage didn't seem to have come from outside of the glass case, sir.\nEdgeworth: I see. So the inside of the case was below freezing point, and the case had developed cracks. There are no signs of external damage... From this we can deduce...\nGumshoe: Below freezing...? Like Mr. Edgeworth's cold stare...\nKay: And cracked...? Like Mr. Edgeworth's furrowed brow...\nEdgeworth: Thermal fracturing! The cold glass case was heated from the outside, causing it to crack.\nRay: Hmm. But why did thermal fracturing occur here, and what caused it?\nEdgeworth: Hmph... Inside the thermally fractured glass case, there was frozen Normallium...\nRay: Oh? That face means you've probably thought of something, Miles.\nEdgeworth: Indeed I have. I know how Mr. Gustavia was able to open the glass case.\nDebeste: WHAT! How can you possibly know something I don't!\nEdgeworth: (I'd say the things he DOES know are in the minority...)\nDebeste: Hey! Aren't you going to LET me know? How did Dane Gustavia open the glass case?\nEdgeworth: This gas burner, that was found in the Autumn Palace, shows signs of recent use. I believe this was the cause of the thermal fracturing in the Pisces Sculpture's glass case.\nDebeste: A gas burner...? Why would he use something like that?\nKay: Ah! I got it! The lid was frozen shut, so he had to use the burner to melt the ice!\nEdgeworth: Indeed, that is correct.\nDebeste: Ngh... I just had a late start. I-I'm still \"the best\", y'know!\nKay: Late start... you didn't even understand a single thing, did you?\nDebeste: Well, that's just because Mr. Edgeworth's explanation was too hard to follow!\nEdgeworth: ...Kay, why don't you update the Little Thief so that he can understand it.\nKay: If you say so. Right, let's restart the re-creation!\nEdgeworth: The victim, Dane Gustavia, was the only one to enter the Autumn Palace. If he used the gas burner then... ...the Normallium in the glass case would have melted.\nDebeste: ...Uh huh, uh huh. And then?\nEdgeworth: The melted Normallium would have come into contact with the Fatallium inside the case... ...and produced the poison gas! The moment Mr. Gustavia opened the lid, he would have begun to inhale the gas. He managed to drag himself out to the Fountain Patio just before his strength ran out.\nDebeste: ...So he inhaled the gas when he opened the lid...\nEdgeworth: (It seems he finally understands.)\nRay: But why did Mr. Gustavia open the glass case of the Pisces Sculpture?\nEdgeworth: The victim's goal... That, I do not yet know.\nRay: Perhaps he had the same reason as Uncle Ray. Maybe he actually came to see the Winter Palace, not the Autumn one.\nEdgeworth: !\nRay: Uncle Ray also thought that this was the Winter Palace at first.\nDelicia: Oi! You too, Ray Ray? Actually, I thought so too! It looks just like Icy's room from 18 years ago. It's even got the exact same plants in front of the door.\nEdgeworth: (It seems everyone involved with the IS-7 Incident made the same mistake. It is imperative that we investigate the real Winter Palace immediately. I should suggest that to Mr. Debeste.)\nDebeste: I get it now...! Yeah. That's how it was!\nEdgeworth: Huh... Did you think of something?\nDebeste: The victim committed suicide! He thought he would look refined if he died in an art gallery!\nEdgeworth: .....\nKay: ...Have you even been listening?\nDebeste: Well, if you're as smart as me, just hearing half of the story will be enough.\nCourtney: Sebastian. I'll explain it from the top later.\nDebeste: \"Top\"...! That means \"best\", right? Alright, I'll leave it to you!\nEdgeworth: (Yes, it would indeed be \"best\" to let Judge Courtney handle him.)\nCourtney: That aside, don't you have some information to inform everyone of?\nDebeste: Aah! I totally forgot!\nEdgeworth: ...What are you talking about?\nDebeste: He heh. We did a little checking on that pharmacist. \"We\" meaning me, \"The Best\" Prosecutor's... subordinate!\nKay: That's not something to brag about.\nDebeste: S-Shut up, you! Quiet down and listen! Suicide is... um... Off the table for now, yeah. That's because, umm... in short... That pharmacist is the culprit! She set up the gas as a trap!\nDelicia: Eeep! N-No!\nCourtney: It's a terrible shame, ...Ms. Pharmacist. How could one in the profession of saving lives stoop to extinguishing them!\nDelicia: Huh? Wh-What are you saying? I... I would never do such a thing!\nEdgeworth: Mr. Debeste. Do you have a basis for these accusations?\nDebeste: Hmph! Of course! This is my basis! Her pharmacist's license. It would permit her to handle Megatoxin X, right?\nEdgeworth: .....And its active ingredient Fatallium was one of the components of the poison gas.\nDebeste: Exactly! That chemical is almost impossible for ordinary people to obtain! But, that pharmacist is another story altogether!\nDelicia: I-It wasn't me! You've got it all wrong!\nDebeste:\nDebeste: And that's not all! A bottle of Megatoxin X was found in the victim's pocket. And on the bottle... we found clear fingerprints, yours!\nDelicia: E... EEEEEEEEEEP!\nDebeste: You and the curator took the victim to the infirmary, right? That would have given you the perfect opportunity to plant the bottle on him!\nDelicia: Th-That's...!\nEdgeworth: ......\nCourtney: You are the only pharmacist on the premises who could have handled Megatoxin X. Furthermore, as for the curator of this art gallery, you're an acquaintance of hers. You would've had access to the gallery at any time, in order to prepare the poison gas trap.\nDelicia: P-Please wait! That Megatoxin X, it was stolen!\nCourtney: ...Trying to lie your way out of this won't go well with me.\nDelicia: It's true! Look, I've got the proof right here in my bag...!\nEdgeworth: (...What is she searching for?)\nDelicia: Not this... Not this either...!\nEdgeworth: (...Hm? I remember seeing cloth like that recently...)\nDelicia: Ah! Here! Please take a look at this!\nEdgeworth: Hm? It's some sort of paper...?\nDelicia: What's it say?\nEdgeworth: \"April 1st Theft Report Accepted. Stolen Item: Megatoxin X\" This... is a theft report acceptance certificate.\nDebeste: Wh-What!?\nDelicia: Yessie! Truth is... one week ago, my Megatoxin X was stolen.\nCourtney: One week ago...? That means, you didn't have it with you today?\nDelicia: Yessie... That bottle you just found is probably the one that was stolen from me. I normally carry that bottle of Megatoxin X in my bag at all times. Even though I often forget to keep it locked up... I would never even think about mixing it with Normallium!\nEdgeworth: But... Why in the world would you carry such a dangerous substance on your person?\nDelicia: Well, you never know when those things will appear. Those... those...\nKay: ...\"Those creatures that infest the kitchen, striking fear into the heart of a lady,\" right? Although if you had a rolled-up newspaper, you could just squash them with one blow.\nDebeste: ...Justine, what do we do now?\nCourtney: Well then... Can we really accept this theft report? Let's ask for confirmation. That should clearly tell us whether or not she's lying.\nDebeste: Right! Well then, I'll just call and confirm it.\nKay: It looks like Ms. Delicious isn't the culprit.\nEdgeworth: Indeed. If she really did set up the poison gas as a trap... I don't believe she would do it in the way that incriminates her the most.\nRay: ...So Miles, who do you think is the culprit?\nEdgeworth: Predicting the actions of the victim would require a fair amount of advance planning... And there's only one person here capable of that.\nRay: Huh? Uncle Ray would like to know too. ...Who do you suspect?\nEdgeworth: The one who stole the Megatoxin X and prepared the room in advance was...\nEdgeworth: It had to be the curator of the Zodiac Art Gallery... Ms. Katherine Hall. However, I still don't have any evidence that she is the criminal yet...\nRay: I see... She is... .....\nEdgeworth: (...? The way he said that just now sounded like he had been expecting it...)\nRay: Hmm. Good job Miles! As expected from Uncle Ray's future apprentice!\nEdgeworth: ...I have no intention of becoming your apprentice.\nDebeste: Aaaand I will now announce the results of my verification! I can confirm that her theft report was indeed accepted! Therefore... it's a little too early to come to a decision!\nEdgeworth: Hmph... that means your logic was completely faulty.\nDebeste: Ngh... Y-You're wrong! My real performance is still to come!\nEdgeworth: Really...? And how do you plan to proceed with your investigation?\nDebeste: Th-That's... First, we need to speak with the curator.\nEdgeworth: And after that?\nDebeste: Ugh... W-We'll cross that bridge when we come to it!\nCourtney: Sebastian. Mr. Gustavia may have had business in the Winter Palace. I believe we should send an investigator there as well.\nDebeste: Oh! That's good too! Detective Gumshoe! Investigate the Winter Palace at once!\nGumshoe: Uugh... Got it, sir.\nDebeste: Justine! Let's go talk to the curator!\nCourtney: Yes, let us proceed.\nEdgeworth: ...We should go and listen to what Ms. Hall has to say as well.\nDebeste: Alright, I want you guys to listen to what the curator has to say.\nKay: ...Mr. Debeste, weren't you going to go and talk to her yourself?\nDebeste: Nah. That's a job for my subordinates. All I have to do is wait for their report. ...I'm \"The Best\" Prosecutor, after all.\nEdgeworth: Such arrogance...!\nKay: Well, this is anticlimactic. I'm gonna chill for a bit. Huh? What's that in the fountain...! A-AAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!\nDebeste: WAAAAAAAHH! Th-There's a dead body in the fountaaain!\nEdgeworth: What... is the meaning of this...!?\nRay: .....!\nCourtney: Silence, everyone! Forensics! Identify this body at once...!\nGumshoe: I-It's terrible, paaaal!\nCourtney: Please be quiet, Detective!\nGumshoe: The ice sculptures in the W-Winter Palace... They've all melted, paaaaal!\nRay: Wha?\nKay: Wha?\nDebeste: Wha?\nEdgeworth: WHAAAAAAAAAT!?\nEdgeworth: What's going on here!?\nKay: There are two victims now...\nRay: This is all... just like 18 years ago. Once again, the ice sculptures have melted.\nKay: Again...?\nRay: ...And everyone related to the incident 18 years ago is gathered here now. This is no mere coincidence. Don't you think so, Miles?\nEdgeworth: Yes. The key to finding the truth of this case lies in this IS-7 Incident. ...This is what I believe.\nRay: He he heh. That's right. Uncle Ray thinks so too. Looks like it's time once again for Uncle Ray to tell you about the IS-7 Incident.\nTo be continued.\n\n",

Isaac Dover was murdered at the venue of a dessert contest... And his body was discovered in the chocolate treasure chest made by Jeff Master. The victim died from blood loss after being struck in the head with a rock salt lamp. The murder weapon was found hidden inside Delicia's candy castle. Then... in the victim's room, where no one had searched yet... ...All of Dover's sherbet sculptures had melted.\n-- 18 Years Ago --\nDecember 24, 9:05 PMContest VenueFountain Patio\nGregory:\n(The sculptures in Mr. Dover's room have melted... Due to that, Prosecutor von Karma immediately drove us away from the scene.)\nRay:\nHow are we gonna investigate now? And what's with that \"Defense attorneys, out!\"!? Von Karma's methods are deplorable!\nGregory:\nWell... investigating the crime scene is supposed to be the police's job, after all.\nRay:\nBut you gotta admit, Von Karma's methods are way outta line! Defense attorneys and the police should work together to discover the truth.\nGregory:\n...Raymond, you must realize that not everyone shares the same views as us. Should one expose the truth for the sake of justice, or simply accept things as they appear? Everyone has their own view on what is right and what is wrong.\nRay:\nEven if that means convicting an innocent man!?\nGregory:\nBoth ourselves, and the police are only human. And as humans, we all make mistakes. It is for this reason that we defense attorneys exist. So that those who are alone and helpless can have an ally on their side.\nRay:\nAn ally on their side...\nGregory:\nIf we cannot investigate, shouldn't we just find some other way to help?\nRay:\n...! I'm sorry, Mr. Edgeworth. I... still have much to learn.\nGregory:\nHmm... you're still young, so you'll have many opportunities to learn.\nRay:\nRight! I'll do my best!\nKate:\nMonsieur Edgeworth and Monsieur Shields. Would you like to take a brief respite? I know it's not much, but please, eat these.\nRay:\nWow! Thank you!\nChocolates added to the Court Record.\nGregory:\n...Let's eat. (I appreciate getting some sugar into my system. ...But these are a little too sweet. ...And it's a little misshapen too.)\nKate:\nI'm terribly sorry. Does it not suit your tastes?\nRay:\nNot at all! It's deliciously sweet!\nKate:\nHee hee... Thank you very much. But... making sweets isn't really my forte.\nRay:\nHuh! You made this chocolate, Kate?\nKate:\nYes. Chocolate is Monsieur Master's favorite food! Preparing his favorite food is also part of my job. But I'm still not that good at it, so I need him to instruct me.\nRay:\nI envy Master Jeff... He gets to eat Kate's handmade sweets whenever he wants.\nKate:\n? Did you say something?\nRay:\nAh! N-No, it's nothing!\nGregory:\n(This is so sweet... in more ways than one.) Ms. Hall, you seem very dedicated to your work.\nKate:\nWithout my work... I wouldn't even have the right to be here.\nRay:\nWhat do you mean?\nKate:\nWhen I was a child... I was abandoned. Monsieur Master took me in.\nRay:\n...!\nKate:\nOne snowy Christmas Eve, I was left on the doorstep of his mansion. I owe Monsieur Master my life... He became like a father to me. And so, to repay his kindness... ...I want to continue working for him.\nRay:\nKate... ...You're incredible...!\nGregory:\n(I've lived a long life... ...yet that brought tears even to my eyes.)\nKate:\nToday, Christmas Eve has finally arrived once more... ...but it looks like I won't be able to give him the present I prepared. I would do anything, if it meant saving Monsieur Master. If there's any way I could be of service to you, please ask!\nGregory:\nYes... I appreciate that. Well then, do you happen to know anything about the victim, Isaac Dover?\nKate:\nI don't really know much about Monsieur Dover, but... ...I have a photo of the desserts he made for the contest finals!\nGregory:\nHmm. This is... certainly a splendid piece of work.\nKate:\nYes! With this exquisite beauty, it's truly a work of art! It's crafted so intricately that you almost forget it's made out of sherbet...! It seems Monsieur Master was also fond of Monsieur Dover's work as well.\nRay:\nWow! These are the Taurus and Gemini constellations!\nGregory:\n...Do you know a lot about constellations, Raymond?\nRay:\nOf course! There is so much romance in the constellations! For example, take the club, lyre, and arrow held by Gemini here. These come from... ...Huh? There are no strings on this lyre. Hmm... Did Mr. Dover make a mistake in his sculpting?\nKate:\nIt's hard to think he would make a mistake like that...\nRay:\nHuh? I thought you said you didn't know much about him...?\nKate:\nAh! Err... I... just sort of felt that way somehow!\nGregory:\n(...It appears she is hiding something from us.)\nGregory:\nMs. Hall, did you take this photograph yourself?\nKate:\nYes. I took it with this instant camera. It develops pictures instantly, It's one of my greatest treasures.\nRay:\nWow! I would love to see it in action.\nKate:\nHee hee... Well then, why don't we take a picture right now?\nRay:\nYay! Let's have our picture taken, Mr. Edgeworth!\nGregory:\nSure, I don't mind. (I'm confident in my hairstyle today...)\nKate:\nAlright, I'm taking the picture! Say cheese! Here, it's developed! A present from me to you, Monsieur Shields.\nRay:\nWow! Thank you so much! ...That's such a great camera!\nKate:\nIt's the only camera in this mansion. Unfortunately, its convenience comes at a cost. There are no negatives...\nGregory:\n(No negatives... huh.) Is this the same camera Mr. Master used during the contest?\nKate:\nYes. You are well-informed. While he made his desserts, Monsieur Master photographed his work. After that, he took photos of all the other competitors' works.\nGregory:\n...? Was he taking photos at the time the body was found? The body was discovered during the judging, was it not?\nKate:\nMonsieur Master intended to take photos of everyone's rooms, but... After he photographed Gustavia's room, he ran out of film. Monsieur Master asked me to change the film in the camera. It seemed the film he prepared in advance wasn't enough...\nGregory:\nThere wasn't enough film?\nKate:\nIt seems the number of photos he took didn't match up with the amount of film remaining. Well... He told me himself it might have been just a mistake, though.\nGregory:\n(Was it really just a mistake...?)\nKate:\nI retrieved more film from the main building and went back to the Fountain Patio. And it was then, that I heard the sound of something breaking in Monsieur Master's room...\nKate:\n...Monsieur Master? Are you in here? Eek...!\nKate:\nAnd that's when... I found Monsieur Dover's body in Monsieur Master's room. It was so terrible. I was really shaken up... Before I spoke to anyone else, I called the police. This camera... I've kept it with me ever since.\nGregory:\nI see. If it's alright with you, would you mind lending me your camera and that photo?\nKate:\nSure. I don't mind at all. Here you go!\nGregory:\nThank you very much.\nInstant Camera added to the Court Record.\nDover's Sherbet Salon added to the Court Record.\nRay:\nDetective Badd, Ms. Delicious! Is the investigation over already?\nDelicia:\nHe said he had no more use for me and kicked me out! Hmph! Manny, that meanie! What a rude thing to say!\nGregory:\n(...It was probably to ensure that you wouldn't eat any more of the crime scene.)\nRay:\nSo, Detective Badd, did you get kicked out too?\nBadd:\n...It seems Von Karma thought I was getting in the way. He won't let me investigate...\nGregory:\n(Why would he prohibit his own detective from investigating...?)\nBadd:\nBut... we know just about all there is to know about the crime scene... Right now... he's talking to Gustavia in Dover's room...\nRay:\nWhy does he need to speak to Mr. Gustavia?\nBadd:\nWe heard... from Hall... that Gustavia was seen entering the victim's room.\nGregory:\nMr. Gustavia...?\nKate:\nYes. I saw him entering Dover's room, and it seemed like he was trying to avoid being seen. Although I have no idea what he did in there...\nBadd:\nHe is... currently under suspicion... for melting Dover's sherbet.\nGregory:\n(Just why DID Mr. Gustavia enter that room...?)\nBadd:\nI also have... a photo of Dover's room here. If you need it... I'll let you take a look at it.\nGregory:\n!\nRay:\n...Eh? Whaaaat? Why would you do that for us?\nBadd:\n...Hmph. You still don't get it, kid... I'm saying I want to help you guys. In order to discover... the truth of this case.\nGregory:\nDetective Badd...!\nRay:\nIs... Is that alright, Detective Badd? Won't Von Karma chew you out again?\nBadd:\nI... have no intention of becoming Von Karma's lab dog. If he won't let me investigate... I'll just do as I like. Getting tied up in stupid rules will only blind you to the truth. Isn't that right...? ...Attorney Edgeworth.\nGregory:\n...Of course, Detective Badd. I thank you.\nRay:\nThis is amazing, Mr. Edgeworth...! Now we've got Detective Badd on our side.\nDelicia:\nI don't really get what's going on... but I'm glad you boys are all friends now!\nGregory:\n(I'm grateful that he'll lend us his strength...) Well then, can we see the photo now?\nBadd:\nRight... This... is the current state of Dover's room.\nRay:\nWow...! The sherbet has completely melted.\nGregory:\n(The room is drenched in a light blue liquid... We should compare this with the photo Ms. Hall took.) Did the sherbet melt because the power cord was pulled out?\nBadd:\nYeah... Because it was pulled... All of the refrigerated glass cases... lost power completely.\nRay:\nLooks like all the power cords were connected to one socket.\nGregory:\nDo you have any idea when this cord was pulled out?\nBadd:\nNo... it's still under investigation at the moment...\nRay:\nWhat a waste of beautiful sherbet.\nDelicia:\nHonestly! Had I known it would end up like this, I would've eaten even more of the stuff!\nRay:\nDid Mr. Dover's sherbet taste that good?\nDelicia:\nOh yessie! His sherbet was most delicious!\nRay:\nReally? I wish I could have eaten some too.\nDelicia:\nBut there was one piece that was so salty I couldn't eat it.\nGregory:\nSalty...?\nDelicia:\nIt's right here in this photo. It was a part of that lyre.\nGregory:\nThat's the lyre from the Gemini constellation...\nRay:\nAh! You snuck a bite from the lyre. That's why the strings are missing!\nDelicia:\nFie! I could never have eaten that much! It was way too salty.\nDelicia's Testimony added to the Court Record.\nGregory:\n(One part of the sherbet tasted different. That's rather curious... Did someone other than her also take a bite out of it?) Did you notice anything else?\nDelicia:\nNow that you mention it, Icy's sherbet sculptures had these strange markings on them. They had two letters carved into them... Wait a minute... there! It looked something like this!\nGregory:\n(...An alphabet signature? It can't be...!)\nKate:\nI knew it! I just knew that Monsieur Dover made this lyre! He isn't one to make mistakes in his sculptures, after all.\nGregory:\n...Ms. Hall. It's been troubling me for a while, but... ...do you know something about Mr. Dover?\nKate:\nHuh! Wh-Why would I know something about Monsieur Dover...?\nGregory:\nYou seem quite attached to Mr. Dover's handiwork.\nKate:\nTh-That's just because his sculptures are such great works of art!\nGregory:\nNo. I believe that his works are very special to you in particular.\nKate:\nH-How do you know that...?\nGregory:\nThere is a piece of evidence that we believe belongs to Mr. Dover... ...and it happens to share a common feature with another piece of evidence.\nKate:\n! P-Please show me! I have no idea what you're talking about! Which two pieces of evidence share something in common?\nGregory:\n(Two pieces of evidence that point to Mr. Dover... Let's start by presenting the first one.)\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nLeads to:\n\"(And now, the second piece of evidence, which shares a common feature is...!)\"\nGregory:\n(And now, the second piece of evidence, which shares a common feature is...!)\nPresent Signet Crest or Jeff's Teapot after presenting other one of them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Delicia saw two letters of the alphabet...\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nGregory:\nThis connection between these two pieces of evidence tells all!\nKate:\n...Err...?\nRay:\nHmm? How exactly are those two things connected?\nGregory:\n(Blast. I was wrong...! There must be something Ms. Hall valued that she was collecting. I should examine the evidence once more...)\nLeads back to:\n\"(Two pieces of evidence that point to Mr. Dover...)\"\nGregory:\nDelicia saw two letters of the alphabet... They were probably used as Mr. Dover's \"signature\". Just as an artist would sign their name on their works.\nKate:\nR-Right...\nDelicia:\nOi! I remember now! ...Icy's sherbet sculptures had PH carved into them, I'm sure of it!\nBadd:\n...PH...? Those aren't Isaac Dover's initials though...\nGregory:\nNo. ...But, we found this seal at the scene of the crime. It had probably fallen out of the late Mr. Dover's pocket. If you had pressed this seal into something, it would mark the letters PH. Also... the very same PH symbol is engraved into this teapot.\nBadd:\n...The same... symbol...?\nGregory:\nThis teapot was made by the sculptor Pierre Hoquet. In other words... this PH is the signature of Pierre Hoquet. Ms. Hall, you know about this signature all too well, don't you?\nKate:\nYes... Monsieur Hoquet's works always bear that signature. Since he never shows himself in public, his signature is used to identify his works.\nBadd:\n! No way... Are you saying Pierre Hoquet is...!\nGregory:\n(It seems Detective Badd has also realized Isaac Dover's true identity...) To Ms. Hall, Mr. Dover was no ordinary pastry chef. That's because, his true identity was...!\nA pastry chef\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nMr. Dover's true identity was a pastry chef!\nRay:\nOf course! How would he have made that delicious sherbet otherwise! But that doesn't solve the mystery of the seal at all! M-Mr. Edgeworth! That just created a ton of contradictions!\nGregory:\nMmph... I hereby withdraw my previous statement...\nLeads back to:\n\"To Ms. Hall, Mr. Dover was no ordinary pastry chef.\"\nA sculptor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"That's right...\"\nA fan of sculptures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nMr. Dover was really a devoted fan of sculptures.\nRay:\n.....\nKate:\n.....\nBadd:\n...Are you really an attorney? Or just a devoted fan of attorneys!?\nGregory:\nMmph... (Don't treat me like a fan...!)\nBadd:\n*sigh*... Let's hear it again...\nLeads back to:\n\"To Ms. Hall, Mr. Dover was no ordinary pastry chef.\"\nGregory:\nThat's right... Mr. Dover's true identity was the sculptor Pierre Hoquet!\nRay:\nWhaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Dover was... a sculptor!?\nBadd:\nThings like signatures... can be faked... if you have the original designs... Can you really use that... as proof that he was a sculptor...?\nGregory:\nNo. But what's important here is that Ms. Hall thought he was. As for proving his real identity, I'll leave that to the police.\nBadd:\nHmph... I get it. ...I'll have the boys check up on it.\nKate:\nAs I expected from you... Gregory Edgeworth.\nGregory:\nYou... You knew Mr. Dover's real identity all along, didn't you?\nKate:\nYes... When I discovered the body, I noticed the seal... I knew from that moment he was Pierre Hoquet, the man I greatly admired. Thinking that this would be his final posthumous work, I just couldn't sit still...!\nGregory:\nSo... that's why you entered Dover's room?\nKate:\n...Huh? Wh-What did you say?\nGregory:\nWhen exactly... did you take this photo of Dover's room?\nKate:\nTh-That was... Perhaps this was taken during the judging...\nGregory:\nGregory:\nThat's strange. I thought you said the camera ran out of film during the judging. Before Mr. Master entered Dover's room, you were the one in possession of the camera. Wasn't that why you were able to take the photo when you discovered the body?\nKate:\nYes... That's right.\nGregory:\nThe only photos you took with the new film were of Dover's room and the body. ...If that's the case, a new contradiction comes to light.\nKate:\nUgh... Another one...!\nGregory:\n(The piece of evidence that contradicts the two photos Ms. Hall took is...!)\nPresent Instant Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nLeads to:\n\"That is... my instant camera...\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nGregory:\nThis piece of evidence contradicts the photos Ms. Hall took.\nKate:\nErr... I don't think there's anything contradictory about that...\nGregory:\n(...My logic is the only thing contradictory here. If I think back on the number of photos she took, the answer should be clear. I already carry the evidence that shows the contradiction!)\nLeads back to:\n\"(The piece of evidence that contradicts the two photos Ms. Hall took is...!)\"\nKate:\nThat is... my instant camera...\nGregory:\nYou've already handed the photos of Dover's room and the body to myself and the police.\nRay:\nThat reminds me, didn't you also take a photo of me and Mr. Edgeworth just now?\nGregory:\nThe film used in this camera can take up to 20 photos. However... this camera only has three photos left. ...Which leaves 14 photos unaccounted for. Exactly what were they used to photograph?\nKate:\n...Ughh.\nGregory:\nPlease show us ALL the photos you took. We will be able to discern your actions from these photos.\nKate:\n...I'm so sorry... I have told... a terrible lie.\nBadd:\nDon't tell me... All of the remaining shots... are of Isaac Dover's room...\nKate:\nMy deepest apologies...\nRay:\nIt seems they are all shots of the ice sculptures from various angles.\nBadd:\nSo when these were taken... the sculptures had not melted yet. But that means... the one who caused them to melt was you...?\nKate:\nYes... I am positive... that I melted them.\nGregory:\nYou are \"positive\"...?\nKate:\nI am an aficionado of the sculptor Pierre Hoquet, who is actually Monsieur Dover. Before the authorities could defile his final masterpieces during their investigation... I thought I should preserve them through photographs. Hence, I entered his room...\nBadd:\nIn that case... why did all the ice melt...?\nKate:\n...It's probably... because... As I was taking the pictures, I became entranced with his works... ...and it seems that my foot accidentally got caught in the power cord, unplugging it...\nGregory:\nAccidentally, you say?\nKate:\nI did not notice the power cord at the time... I would never have imagined that I would be the cause of those sculptures melting.\nGregory:\n(Could the truth really be that simple? However, I cannot say with certainly that she is lying...)\nKate:\nI am so sorry to have caused you all so much trouble...!\nGregory:\nAs long as you are telling the truth, there's no need to apologize.\nRay:\nThat's right! Don't sweat it, Kate!\nKate:\n...Thank you very much.\nBadd:\n...Edgeworth. Here... take this picture. ...Do what you want with it.\nDover's Sherbet Salon updated in the Court Record.\nvon Karma:\n...You meddling fools still haven't given up yet, have you? No matter how long you wait, I have no intention of allowing a defense attorney to investigate.\nGregory:\n...No matter. If we can't investigate, we'll find the truth through some other method.\nvon Karma:\n...Always ready with a comeback. Well, do try your best.\nKate:\nUm, excuse me... Monsieur von Karma? The truth is... it was I who melted the ice sculptures in Monsieur Dover's room!\nvon Karma:\nWhat...? What's the meaning of this, you clod!?\nKate:\nI am truly sorry! Both to you and Monsieur Gustavia...!\nGustavia:\nNnph... Do not be concerned about me. Sir von Karma has already recognized that I had no hand in this act.\nGregory:\nThat reminds me... Why did you enter Mr. Dover's room, Mr. Gustavia?\nGustavia:\nAh. Well, that was because...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nSilence, ignoramus! You are not to give that attorney the tiniest hint of information. Katherine Hall! You are coming with me! You are under suspicion of being \"complicit\" in the murder.\nGregory:\n...!\nKate:\nN-No!\nvon Karma:\nI shall be interrogating you personally. ...You best prepare yourself.\nKate:\n...Very well.\nGregory:\nPlease wait. I still have some questions I want to ask her...!\nvon Karma:\nI do not care for your sorry plight in the least.\nGregory:\nUrgh...!\nvon Karma:\nBadd, Gustavia, and while I'm at it, you as well, Scones. I have plenty of questions for you all.\nBadd:\n...Hmph.\nGustavia:\nUnderstood.\nDelicia:\nFie! \"While I'm at it\", he says... The nerve!\nRay:\n...He just took everyone away with him.\nGregory:\nYes... Even if we stay here, I don't think we'll be able to investigate any further today. Let's take our leave for now. It has already grown rather late. (I hope the snow has stopped by now...)\nRay:\nSounds good! ...I'm starving anyway.\nGregory:\nHmm... Let's stop somewhere for hamburgers then. (Before my stomach joins the chorus...)\nRay:\nHe he he! You can't fight on an empty stomach after all!\nGregory:\n(We'll need to report back to Mr. Master with our findings first thing tomorrow...)\nTo be continued.\nDecember 25, 10:00 AMDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nRay:\nHuh? What are you doing here, Kate?\nKate:\nAh... Monsieur Shields and Monsieur Edgeworth. Allow me to apologize once again for all the trouble I caused you yesterday.\nGregory:\n(Ms. Hall looks a bit tired...) Has Von Karma finished interrogating you?\nKate:\nYes, aside from what happened to the ice sculptures, I was not at fault for anything else.\nRay:\nAre you also here to meet with Master Jeff, Kate?\nKate:\nYes... I am worried about how he is holding up...\nGregory:\nDetective Badd...? Why are you here?\nBadd:\nI just happened to be here... ...I'll be heading to the crime scene soon.\nRay:\nI don't think this is a place that people \"happen to be\" though...\nMaster:\n...Hello...\nGregory:\n...!\nRay:\nM-Master Jeff! What happened to you!?\nKate:\nOh, no! Monsieur Master! Why do you look so poor!?\nMaster:\n...I didn't get much sleep last night... The tribulation known as questioning... was rather harsh. I'm just... a little exhausted.\nGregory:\n! ...They didn't let you sleep?\nRay:\nEven for an interrogation, that's going too far! Detective Badd!\nBadd:\n...The detective in charge of the initial investigation was also in charge of the interrogation... I don't like Von Karma's methods, but... this was all I could do.\nMaster:\nHe was the one who brought me here. It seems... I was supposed to be interrogated for a little bit longer, though...\nBadd:\n...Hmph.\nGregory:\n(It seems that Detective Badd is looking out for Mr. Master in his own way...) So, shall we inform Mr. Master about what happened yesterday, Raymond?\nRay:\nYessir! I got all my memos right here!\nGregory:\nMr. Master, we would like to inform you about yesterday's investigation...\nMaster:\nYes... Thank you very much... Please go ahead...\nRay:\nMaster Jeff. It's almost like your spirit's gone...\nMaster:\nAh... My sugar levels are low, so I might not seem like my usual energetic self...\nKate:\nMonsieur Master...\nGregory:\n(Do we have anything that can give his spirit and his glucose a boost...?)\nThe contestants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nMr. Master...?\nMaster:\nYes...What is it...?\nRay:\nYou look dizzy, Master Jeff...\nMaster:\nAh... My sugar levels are low, so I might not seem like my usual energetic self...\nGregory:\n(Do we have anything that can give his spirit and his glucose a boost...?)\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChocolate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ohh...! Those chocolates...! Are you giving them to me?\"\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nMr. Master...?\nMaster:\nYes...What is it...?\nRay:\nYou look dizzy, Master Jeff...\nMaster:\nAh... My sugar levels are low, so I might not seem like my usual energetic self...\nGregory:\n(Do we have anything that can give his spirit and his glucose a boost...?)\nMaster:\nOhh...! Those chocolates...! Are you giving them to me?\nKate:\nAh... Those chocolates are...\nGregory:\nIf possible, I would like to give them to you immediately... ...but it's against the rules to give anything to the suspects in the detention center.\nMaster:\nI... see... Regrettably, if those are the rules, then there's nothing we can do about it...\nBadd:\n.....\nRay:\nAre you sure there's no way we can give them to him...?\nGregory:\n(Detective Badd... looks like he noticed what we're trying to ask of him.)\nBadd:\n...Tsk. ...I'll inspect the chocolates, and if there are no problems... I'll think about it.\nGregory:\n! Detective Badd... Thank you very much.\nRay:\nAlright! I knew we could count on you, Detective Badd!\nMaster:\n...! I am truly in your debt.\nBadd:\n...Wait right here. ...Take it.\nMaster:\nThank you very much...!\nBadd:\nNot a word... to anyone else. ...It would cause problems for me later...\nMaster:\nYes, of course... I apologize for making you go through so much trouble. Now, I shall partake in eating these delicious delights at once.\nGregory:\nI'm sorry for asking you to do something so dangerous, Detective Badd.\nBadd:\nHmph. I only did... what I wanted to do...\nRay:\nHe he he. Why can't you just be honest here, Detective?\nMaster:\nOhhh... How sweet! It's like I've come back to life...! Ho ho... Did Kate make these chocolates?\nKate:\nY-Yes, sir, I did. How does it taste...?\nMaster:\n♬ Meeeelts... in your mouth Nooot iiin youuur haand Sweet choocoolaates! ♪ Meeeelting iiin my mouth Sooo sweet! Sooo divine! ♬ ...Thank you for the tasty treat. Ho ho, they're a bit misshapen... but so sweet and delicious. Thank you.\nKate:\n! I am so glad that you enjoyed it!\nGregory:\n...And above all, it helped you regain your spirit.\nMaster:\nThank you for your concern. The food they serve here has been absolutely tasteless... And combined with the lack of sleep, I was thoroughly exhausted.\nRay:\nIs the food here that bad?\nBadd:\n...Just salt beef and stew... Your average prison fare.\nMaster:\n? That is odd. I really could not taste anything...\nGregory:\n...?\nBadd:\n...Whatever. I'm about to head out... to the crime scene.\nGregory:\nPlease wait, Detective Badd. Can you give us any new information?\nBadd:\n...Yeah. I think I can... We've identified the victim. Just as you said... Isaac Dover was a sculptor who worked in France. It seems he went by the name... Pierre Hoquet.\nMaster:\nIsaac Dover was... Pierre Hoquet...? How could that be...!?\nKate:\nMonsieur Pierre Hoquet...\nRay:\nSo Pierre Hoquet wasn't actually French, huh?\nGregory:\nWhich is likely why he never showed himself in public while he worked under that name.\nBadd:\nThe \"Zodiac Sculptures\"... They were his masterpieces, it seems... ...Although they will remain forever unfinished.\nRay:\nUnfinished...? Even though they were his masterpieces?\nBadd:\nIt seems he worked on them... by season... Once he finished... the remaining winter constellations... his work would be done...\nRay:\nHuh? The winter constellations are... Taurus and Gemini, right?\nGregory:\nSo those ice sculptures were his final pieces.\nRay:\nIt is heartbreaking that they melted...\nKate:\nI cannot apologize enough...\nRay:\nAh! No! I wasn't blaming you or anything...!\nBadd:\nAlso... Dover was infamous for being greedy... He would charge... hundreds of thousands... just to make a single sculpture... It seemed like... he always had money troubles. The murder might be related to that... but it's still under investigation.\nRay:\nSo he had money problems even though he was a famous artist?\nGregory:\nDo you know why he entered a dessert contest?\nBadd:\n...Not yet. He kept it a secret... Even from his family.\nGregory:\nI see...\nBadd:\n...It's time. I'm bringing in the replacement guard... I can't... hang around here any longer than I have.\nGregory:\nYes. I understand. Let's meet again later.\nMaster:\nThat detective... is a kind soul.\nGregory:\nIndeed. He never strays from his own beliefs... He truly has a strong will.\nRay:\nBut he's pretty scary when you first meet him!\nMaster:\nI see... Could you tell me everything that happened yesterday?\nGregory:\nOf course. Allow me to give you a report of our investigation.\nMaster:\nSo this is what happened...? I am sorry for the trouble Kate has caused you.\nKate:\nI am truly very sorry...\nGregory:\n...You have no need to worry so long as you have told the truth, Ms. Hall. Mr. Master, would you mind if I asked you a few questions as well?\nMaster:\nYes. I shall divulge all that I know.\nThe contestants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nPlease tell us about the other three contestants in the final round of your contest.\nMaster:\nLet's see... Ms. Delicious' desserts had a fantastic design. However, she broke the rules so I could not recognize her as the winner. Up until the semifinals, Mr. Gustavia's flavors and design were to my liking... Unfortunately, both the taste and appearance of his finals entry left much to be desired. And.. there was something strange about his dessert in the semifinals.\nGregory:\n...Something strange?\nMaster:\nBoth Mr. Gustavia's and Mr. Dover's desserts had the exact same taste. ...They had different designs, but in terms of taste, it was like eating the same thing.\nRay:\n? What did they look like?\nMaster:\nAh... there should be a picture of them at my mansion.\nKate:\nPlease allow me to show you later.\nGregory:\nCertainly. Thank you very much.\nMaster:\nAnd then, there was Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures. Oh, they were absolutely heavenly!\nGregory:\nHm...? Did you have a chance to taste his creations? If I recall correctly, his body was discovered in the middle of judging...\nMaster:\nYes, but I was not informed of this until after the judging had finished. Since he was not present in the room, I helped myself to a piece of his edible lyre. It was fantastically delicious...! I was so moved, I broke into song!\nGregory:\n! Wait a moment, please. Did you say the lyre was... \"delicious\"? Could you please give us a little more detail about that?\nThe delicious lyre (appears after The contestants)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You ate the lyre from the sculpture in Mr. Dover's room, correct?\"\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContest Rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThe prize of the contest is the title of \"The World's Greatest\"... Would a \"Master\" like yourself have anything to gain by winning it?\nMaster:\nI am most grateful that others would call me by such names... However, if I were to let that satisfy me, I would be bringing an end to my personal growth. That is why I always desire challengers to test me for those titles.\nGregory:\n...I see. That is a fine attitude.\n\n\n\n\nJeff's Teapot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nWere you the one who purchased this tea set?\nMaster:\nNo, it was a present from Kate. It was made by Pierre Hoquet. Ever since I saw his work while I was abroad, I have been a great fan of his.\nGregory:\n(You do seem fond of his work.)\n\n\n\n\nInstant Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster:\nI bought that as a birthday present for Kate.\nGregory:\nIs that so? It seems she takes it wherever she goes.\nMaster:\nYou might think it a little unrefined as a present for a young lady... ...yet she takes great joy in using it, so I could not ask for anything more.\nGregory:\n(I think it might be because it was a present from you... ...but bringing that up would be doubtlessly unrefined.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster:\n...I see nothing of particular interest in this.\nGregory:\n(Mr. Master must be tired from questioning. I should be careful in selecting my own questions.) In that case, please do not let it bother you. Please entirely forget what I just showed you.\nMaster:\n...When you put it that way, it makes me all the more concerned...\nGregory:\nYou ate the lyre from the sculpture in Mr. Dover's room, correct?\nMaster:\nYes, the one that was in the same glass case as the Gemini Sculpture.\nGregory:\n...Please have a look at this picture, Mr. Master. Did you eat from this lyre that's missing the strings?\nMaster:\nYes, that lyre originally had strings. However, I ate them all, resulting in what you see here in this picture.\nGregory:\n(So the strings on the lyre were missing because he ate them...) Actually, Delicia ate part of the same lyre that you did. However, she said it was so salty that she could not eat it.\nMaster:\n! ...You don't say...! That means... there might be a problem with my sense of taste, after all...\nGregory:\nA problem with your sense of taste...? How so?\nMaster:\nThere is a taste disorder called \"hypogeusia\", in which you lose the ability to taste salt. Perhaps... I have contracted this illness. I just never realized it since I eat nothing but sweets... However, I now know with certainly.\nGregory:\n(So that's why he couldn't tell what the food they served here tasted like...)\nKate:\nNo...! For a pastry chef to lose their sense of taste is fatal!\nGregory:\n...Even if there is treatment for taste impairment, there isn't a cure for it yet. But, it's probably best that you let the police know so you can receive a medical examination.\nMaster:\nNo... That won't be necessary. ...There is a recipe in my mansion specifically for making the cure.\nGregory:\nA recipe for a drug that will cure your taste impairment?\nMaster:\nYes... Please look for it later when you return to the mansion.\nKate:\n! Monsieur Master... but that means revealing the...!\nMaster:\nKate... We should no longer conceal it from Mr. Gregory.\nKate:\n...Yes, sir. I understand. If that is what you wish...\nGregory:\n(A recipe for a special drug... Just what are they hiding?)\nKate:\nWell, then... I must be returning to the mansion now, so I will take my leave.\nGregory:\nYes, we will be heading there later as well.\nMaster:\n...Kate.\nKate:\n? What is it, Monsieur Master?\nMaster:\nYou... should not live for my sake.\nKate:\n!\nMaster:\nYou should... reconsider your lifestyle. So that you can live by yourself, even if I were no longer around...\nKate:\nP-Please do not say things like that! I simply cannot live without you, Monsieur Master! I promise to wait for you until you return...! .....Excuse me!\nRay:\nAh...! Kate...!\nMaster:\n...Katherine...\nRay:\nMaster Jeff... Kate was crying. Why did you say something so cruel...?\nMaster:\n...I am worried about her. Katherine always put me... before herself.\nGregory:\nWhat do you mean...?\nMaster:\nShe collects Pierre Hoquet's works and makes sweets... ...all to make me happy, nothing more. That is the only reason she does anything.\nRay:\n!\nMaster:\nShe always puts aside her own preferences and things that she wants to do herself. ...I want Katherine to choose to live her own life. I do not want her to waste her valuable life because of me.\nRay:\nIs... that so...?\nGregory:\n(He thinks of Ms. Hall as his own daughter. And he would want his children to choose their own path in life. And... a parent would do anything to protect their own children. That feeling... I also know it well.) Well, that should do it for the questions. We must return to the scene of the crime.\nMaster:\nAh... It is already time to leave, I see. So will my tribulations... of questioning... resume...\nGregory:\nWe should take measures against their interrogations from our side as well.\nMaster:\nCan you ask the police about that?\nGregory:\nI can... But I have other ways in mind, as well. ...When the time comes.\nMaster:\nHo ho... You are a dependable man. I shall be counting on you.\nRay:\nMaster Jeff... We'll come here every day with reports of our progress! And we'll bring Kate, too!\nMaster:\nYes... Thank you very much. I shall be looking forward to it.\nGregory:\n...Mr. Master, know that the police will be attempting to get you to confess. I am sorry to ask an innocent soul like yourself to bear with these painful experiences... ...but please hold on for now. If you confess, I am positive that Von Karma will use that to his advantage. And that will make helping you all that much more difficult.\nMaster:\n...I understand. I shall do my best.\nGregory:\nIf you believe in me until the bitter end, I will definitely get you out of here.\nDecember 25, 11:03 AMContest VenueFountain Patio\nGregory:\n...Detective Badd, thank you for helping us earlier.\nRay:\nYes, thank you!\nBadd:\nHmph... Thanks for what?\nGregory:\nHeh.....\nRay:\nAh ha ha ha! There's no need to be shy about it!\nBadd:\n.....Tsk. Enough about that... I suppose... you intend to investigate today too?\nGregory:\nOf course. We still need more information to prove Mr. Master's innocence.\nBadd:\nI'm sorry... but apart from this patio... you're not allowed to investigate anywhere else.\nRay:\nWhat!? So you're saying we can't investigate!?\nGregory:\n...I'm guessing this is Von Karma's doing?\nBadd:\nYeah... Von Karma's a bit on edge at the moment... He still... hasn't received the autopsy report. Moreover... the only ones in this mansion are Ms. Hall and the police... So don't get your hopes up... on speaking with the people connected to this case.\nRay:\nVon Karma's being completely unreasonable! He's gone too far...!\nGregory:\n.....Detective Badd. What you intend to do?\nBadd:\nI promised... I'll do anything I can... to assist you.\nGregory:\n...You have my thanks.\nRay:\nWe won't let any of Von Karma's dirty tricks get the best of us!\nGregory:\nDetective Badd, is it alright if we investigate the Fountain Patio?\nBadd:\nYes... but we've already finished checking everything, except for the fountain...\nGregory:\nThat's fine. As long as there is still something, I shall continue investigating.\nBegin Investigation\nContest VenueFountain Patio\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\n...What?\n\n\n\nThe investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nWhat do you think about the case, Detective Badd?\nBadd:\n...The police's opinion... is the same as Von Karma's. But... I don't buy that. The investigation of this patio... is also lacking as well... I have... already talked to the labbies. You can ask them... anything you want.\nGregory:\n...I appreciate that. Thank you, Detective Badd.\nBadd:\nHmph... I'm not really doing it for you. I just want an investigation I can approve of.\nInstruments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIt seems these musical instruments were used in \"Piece of Cake\". Of course, these probably aren't made of candy.\nBadd:\n......\nGregory:\nDetective Badd looks somewhat disappointed...\nOfficiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficer:\nThe investigation is underway. Only authorized personnel beyond this point.\nBadd:\nAren't I... authorized personnel...?\nOfficer:\nS-Sorry! Authorized personnel are prohibited too!\nGregory:\nI guess that means no one can enter.\nBadd:\nAre these... Von Karma's orders...? I can't stand that guy...!\nDrum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIt's a drum in the shape of a cake... It was probably used in \"Piece of Cake.\" Detective Badd, about this drum...\nBadd:\n...It's already been investigated... The inside... is hollow. But, there's no sign that anything was hidden inside. It's not related to the case.\nGregory:\n...You knew exactly what I was going to say.\nBadd:\nHmph. I may have a sweet tooth, but... that doesn't mean I have candy for brains.\nSanta Claus figure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIt's a figure of Santa Claus... I suppose it's also made of candy.\nBadd:\n...Behind that door... is Master's room. This Santa... is probably another one of his works.\nGregory:\n(Santa, huh... I wonder what I should get my son for Christmas this year. I think he said... he wanted an attorney's badge... I wonder if I could ask Mr. Master to make him one out of candy...)\nReindeer figure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\nThis leads to... Gustavia's room.\nGregory:\nThere's a reindeer by the door. According to the nameplate, it's made entirely of candy.\nBadd:\nSuch splendid antlers... Very manly...\nGregory:\nBut, a male reindeer's antlers fall off during the winter. So, this must be a female.\nBadd:\n...You lawyers, always giving out useless information...\nGregory:\n(What does that have to do with being a lawyer...)\nTrophy on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nWhat an amazing trophy.\nBadd:\nIt's probably... Master's. \"World's Greatest Pastry Chef\", huh...\nGregory:\nIt's also made out of candy. ...It doesn't seem like it would last long.\nBadd:\nHonor and glory... don't last long... I think that's the lesson here.\nGregory:\n(I don't think it's quite as deep as that...)\nRaymond Shields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nRaymond. Could we talk for a bit?\nRay:\nSure thing, Mr. Edgeworth! Fire away!\n\n\n\nAbout the case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nRaymond. Have you noticed anything about the case?\nRay:\nA lot actually! Mr. Dover's body was found in Mr. Master's room... And we found the murder weapon, that rock salt lamp, in Ms. Delicious' candy castle! *sigh* ...Ms. Delicious' desserts aren't so dreamy anymore, huh.\nGregory:\nYes... You're right.\nRay:\nAnd Kate looks sad too...\nGregory:\nI asked you to \"note\" not to \"dote\"...\nRay:\n...Huh? Did I do something wrong?\nGregory:\n(...I'm getting a little worried about your future.)\n\n\n\n\nRaymond Shields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThis case was your first investigation, huh, Raymond.\nRay:\nYes! And I've been taking memos on everything that's happening! It's truly an inspiration to be investigating with you, Mr. Edgeworth!\nBadd:\n...You aiming to be an attorney...?\nRay:\nYeah, defense attorneys are heroes of justice who help those in need! The moment I saw how amazing Mr. Edgeworth was in court, I decided to be his apprentice!\nBadd:\nBut... detectives also defend people...\nRay:\nBut, I already have my heart set on becoming a defense attorney.\nBadd:\n.....Hmph... Is that so? Well... good luck then.\nGregory:\n(...Perhaps Detective Badd wants an apprentice too?)\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nThat's the attorney's badge I've been yearning for... I'll get one too, you'll see!\nGregory:\n...The scale engraved on this badge represents \"truth\" and \"fairness\". You shouldn't just aim at getting one of these badges... You should aim at becoming an attorney that wouldn't put this badge to shame.\nRay:\n...Y-Yes!\nGregory:\n(I, too, need to set an example as a venerable attorney for him to follow.)\n\n\n\n\nJeff's Teapot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nI'd like to drink tea elegantly from a tea pot like that.\nGregory:\nI'm sorry... all we've got at the office is black coffee. ...My son likes drinking tea, so we keep it at home.\nRay:\nO-Oh, don't worry! I like your coffee too. Blacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than hell itself. That is... ...coffee... I love it. B-But, it is rather bitter!\nGregory:\n(...Note to self: coffee has a bad effect on lawyers.)\n\n\n\n\nRock Salt Lamp or Fluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nMs. Delicious' decorations are all so cool!\nGregory:\nAnd, also against the rules...\nRay:\nIt seems she has a few more. Relaxation goods, I mean. Fluorescent pillows, fluorescent dresses, fluorescent sunglasses, and so on...\nGregory:\nI don't think that's a particularly relaxing lineup.\n\n\n\n\nDover's Sherbet Salon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nSo, it's all made of sherbet.\nGregory:\nIt has amazing workmanship. But there's something that is bothering me... (I don't know why, but something feels out of place with these sculptures...)\nRay:\nSomething bothering you...? Ah, I get it! Because the statues are works of art, you can't eat them... So they're \"hard to stomach\".\nGregory:\nThe sculptures are edible, though. Delicia and Mr. Master both had some.\nRay:\nUugh... I was just joking...\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nHmm... Is this an important piece of evidence? Yeah! It's been very helpful!\nGregory:\n...Could I ask how you found it helpful?\nRay:\nErr... sorry. I haven't digested its contents yet!\nGregory:\n(It would seem he hasn't matured at all since our conversation earlier...)\nFountain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThese angel statues look like they're eating chocolate fondue.\nBadd:\nIt would seem... these angel statues... are also Pierre Hoquet's works. As expected... they're very well made. ...Looks just like the real thing...\nGregory:\nSo, you've seen a real angel before, Detective Badd?\nBadd:\n...Tch. Defense attorneys... Always the first to find fault with everything...\nGregory:\n(Hmm... Perhaps that was wrong of me?)\nElevator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nWhere does this elevator go?\nBadd:\nTo the second floor... Master and Hall's quarters... Apparently, on their days off... Master makes candy and holds tea parties upstairs... But if it's a nice day... They probably have it in the gardens or something...\nGregory:\nThat sounds nice. I'd like an invite when the case is over. Would you like to come too, Detective Badd?\nBadd:\n...You're wasting your breath. I don't fraternize with attorneys...\nForensics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nWhat... are you investigating exactly?\nForensics:\nSir! I'm testing the water in the fountain for foreign matter, sir!\nBadd:\nHave you... found anything...?\nForensics:\nIt seems there's both chocolate and sherbet mixed in with the fountain water. It matches the chocolate from Jeff Master's room... ...and the sherbet that melted in Isaac Dover's room. They all share the same composition.\nBadd:\nThe fountain water circulates through the streams that flow from each of the four rooms... Perhaps the melted sherbet... flowed into the fountain.\nForensics:\nAlso... someone's blood was detected as well!\nBadd:\n...What are you saying? How could there have been blood in the fountain...!\nGregory:\nDetective Badd, please think back to our investigation of the crime scene.\n\n\nGregory:\nDetective Badd. Please look at the crime scene carefully once more. The bloodstain that should have remained at the crime scene has disappeared!\nBadd:\n...! I definitely... didn't get any reports about the bloodstain being cleaned up...\n\n\nGregory:\nThe blood disappeared from the crime scene. Also, part of the treasure chest was missing too.\nBadd:\n!\nGregory:\nPerhaps... the blood in the fountain belongs to this person.\n\n\n\nPresent Isaac Dover profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... the victim...\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nGregory:\nI think the blood belongs to this person...\nBadd:\nI think... the blood... must have rushed to your head... When did... that person... ever bleed...?\nGregory:\nE-Er, well... (What was I thinking... There's only one person who shed blood!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Perhaps... the blood in the fountain belongs to this person.\"\n\n\nBadd:\nHmm... the victim... Let's run a comparison... with the blood on the murder weapon...\n\n\nBadd:\n...It's a match. The blood in the fountain... is Dover's.\nGregory:\n(I wonder why the criminal spilled the victim's blood into the fountain...)\nVictim's Blood added to the Court Record.\nForensics (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(He's testing the water. I won't disturb him. The victim's blood was found in the fountain water... I wonder why the criminal spilled the victim's blood into the fountain.)\nSign panel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nThe owner of the works in each room are written on this notice board. From the left, Mr. Master, Mr. Gustavia, Ms. Delicia, and Mr. Dover. Incidentally, it would seem the board is also made of candy. ...Do they plan to eat all this stuff when the contest is over?\nTrophies on right side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nMany of the tropies Master has received are placed here. Besides dessert contests, there are also awards for his charity work. An evident display of both his skill and character. Hm? This trophy is... To recognize the TV program \"Piece of Cake\" for giving children hopes and dreams. Hopes and dreams... Now I want to see it too.\nSnowman figure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\nThis leads to... Delicia's room...\nGregory:\nThis snowman here is rather eye-catching. It's made from powdered sugar...\nBadd:\n...Oh. Powdered sugar, huh...\nGregory:\n(He's staring at it quite intently. ...I hope he's not thinking of sneaking a taste.)\nHarp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nA harp and some maracas are lined up here. They're so exquisitely crafted, I can't tell from looking if they are sweets or the real thing. I'd like to touch them, but... that would go against the rule of preserving the crime scene.\nBadd:\nKeep your hands off them. I... already checked. They're... real instruments...\nGregory:\nBut, if you can't tell by looking, how did you know they were real without touching them?\nBadd:\nIndeed... I didn't touch them. ...Not with my hands, that is.\nGregory:\n(Surely not...... No, I'm overthinking it.)\nChristmas tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nIt's a Christmas tree made out of table sugar.\nBadd:\nThanks to these decorations... this place is on red alert... If even a single ant made it inside... It would be terrible...\nGregory:\n(Indeed, if ants got in here, it would be disastrous.)\nKatherine Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nMs. Hall. I've come to investigate today.\nKate:\nAh... Monsieur Edgeworth. I apologize for my disgraceful behavior earlier.\nRay:\nKate... She still looks a bit down.\nGregory:\n(What Master said earlier must have been a real shock to her.)\nKate:\n...I've prepared the photo I took of the desserts during the semifinals. ...Please, take a look.\nRay:\nWow! Delicia's cake is so cute!\nKate:\nMonsieur Master also praised the design of Delicia's work very highly. Messieurs Gustavia and Dover's works gained high praise for both taste and design, but... ...Monsieur Master said it felt like he was eating the exact same thing twice. But it seems that their desserts had completely different tastes for the finals.\nGregory:\n...Was there anything else that was different between the finals and the semifinals?\nKate:\n...It's nothing major, but there was something. During the contest, Monsieur Gustavia's son always came to see him, but... ...there was no sign of him at the finals.\nGregory:\n(His son came to visit...? I wonder if there is any significance behind that.) Would you mind leaving this photo with me?\nKate:\nCertainly. Anything to aid in the investigation.\nSemifinal Desserts added to the Court Record.\nKate:\nAnd... here's the recipe book that contains the special drug for caring taste disorders.\nGregory:\n! That cover looks familiar.\nBadd:\nWasn't this framed... in Master's room...?\nKate:\nSince it's also the prize for the contest, we put it out on display.\nRay:\nEhh! So the contest prize, \"Angel's Recipe\"... ...wasn't just a recipe for desserts?\nKate:\nThat's right. We've informed the participants, but... ...it seems you all don't know yet.\nGregory:\n(So the participants knew about the true contests of the Angel's Recipe...)\nAngel's Recipe Book added to the Court Record.\nGregory:\nMs. Hall. Please tell me all know about the Angel's Recipe.\n\n\n\nThe Angel's Recipe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nSo, the Angel's Recipe contains the formula for the drug.\nKate:\nYes. It's a recipe book for new drugs that haven't been released to the public yet. If sold to a pharmaceutical company, I'm sure it would fetch a substantial price.\nBadd:\nWhy... is something like that a prize in the contest...?\nKate:\nMonsieur Master is the only heir to the Chairman of the Master Group.\nRay:\nM... Master Group? That name sounds familiar...\nBadd:\n...They're... a pharmaceutical company who deal a wide range of products...\nRay:\nAh! They've become big news recently with the release of Coldkiller X. I often use the Coldkiller products!\nGregory:\n(But, I've never once seen you with a cold...) I would like to hear more about the Master Group.\n\n\n\n\nMaster Group (appears after The Angel's Recipe)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Did Mr. Master not want to follow in his parent's footsteps?\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKate:\nWhy dod you carry that badge around with you?\nGregory:\nAs long as I have this with me, people can tell that I'm a defense attorney at first glance.\nKate:\nHow convenient. If only pastry chefs had such a badge. Or better yet, make murderers wear a badge.\nGregory:\n...For murderers, there's a thing called handcuffs.\n\n\n\n\nSignet Crest or Jeff's Teapot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKate:\nI still can't believe Monsieur Dover and Pierre Hoquet are the same person...\nGregory:\nCan you prove you didn't know that until recently?\nKate:\nW-Well, no. That would be difficult... But... will that be a problem?\nGregory:\n...Well, no, I suppose not. (That didn't really get me anywhere. But I guess that comes with the job...)\n\n\n\n\nInstant Camera or Dover's Sherbet Salon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKate:\nThere is... no excuse for what I've done.\nGregory:\nIt has amazing workmanship. But there's something that is bothering me... (I don't know why, but something feels out of place with these sculptures...)\nKate:\nSomething bothering you...? Ah, I get it! Because the statues are works of art, you can't eat them... So they're \"hard to stomach\".\nGregory:\nThe sculptures are edible, though. Delicia and Mr. Master both had some.\nKate:\nUugh... I was just joking...\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\nI'd like to hear what you have to say about this.\nKate:\n♪ I don't know! Much about! ♪ ♬ The items related to the incideeeent! ♪\n*ding*\nKate:\n♪ Aaaah! I'm soooo soorryyyy! ♬\nGregory:\n...*sigh*\n\n\n\nGregory:\nDid Mr. Master not want to follow in his parent's footsteps?\nKate:\nMonsieur Master... wanted to bring joy to people with his desserts. His parents also wanted him to become a great pastry chef and supported him. When his parents died, the recipe book was left to him as his inheritance.\nGregory:\nWhy would he give away a memento of his parents as a prize in the contest...?\nKate:\nThere were always people who were after it, something which troubled Monsieur Master. But just giving away the memento would have been disrespectful to his parents. So, he decided to pass it over to someone he acknowledged.\nBadd:\nAnd the members of the Master Group... approved of that? Information about new drugs... being passed on to outsiders...\nKate:\n...Of course they objected. That's why... Delicia participated in the contest. On the order of the Master Group, she was requested to win the championship.\nGregory:\n! You knew Delicia's true identity from the start?\nKate:\n...Yes. In order for her to win, I told her Monsieur Master's tastes and preferences.\nGregory:\nWhy did you help her?\nKate:\nI helped her... in order to protect Monsieur Master and the Master Group... If the drug recipes were given to another company, he would be reprimanded by the board. I wanted to return the recipes to the company in a way that Monsieur Master would accept...\nGregory:\n(So it was due to Ms. Hall's help that Delicia was able to reach the finals...)\nRay:\nSpeaking of which, Mr. Dover wasn't a pastry chef either. He sure did well to make it to the finals, considering he's just a sculptor.\nKate:\nYes. For him to be able to make such fine desserts despite being a sculptor...!\nGregory:\n(From the sherbet sculptures he made for the finals, it's clear to see he has great talent, but... ...could he really have made that by himself?)\nKate:\nThat is all I know... Is there anything else I can do to help?\nGregory:\n(...To save Mr. Master, she's trying to help as much as she can.) May we perhaps have some more of that tea from yesterday please, Ms. Hall? I'm sure that would help us get on with the investigation.\nRay:\nYeah! I'd like some of Kate's tea too!\nKate:\n...Right! Understood. I'll be back in a minute!\nRay:\nKate looks a bit better now!\n(Examining forensics and clearing Kate's all \"Talk\" options leads to:)\nInvestigation Complete\nGregory:\n(We've gathered information about all the contestants... ...and yet we still haven't heard Gustavia's side of the story.)\nGregory:\nThat reminds me... Why did you enter Mr. Dover's room, Mr. Gustavia?\nGustavia:\nAh. Well, that was because...\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nSilence, ignoramus! You are not to give that attorney the tiniest hint of information.\nGregory:\n(What exactly was he doing in Mr. Dover's room...? And moreover... something is odd about his semifinal entry. A pastry chef bad at design, and a sculptor skilled only at designing... It would have been extremely difficult for either of them to win the contest alone. Could it be that Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover's connection is...) Detective Badd. We have reason to suspect the actions of Dane Gustavia.\nBadd:\nYeah...\nGregory:\nIt is imperative that we find a way to contact him at once.\nvon Karma:\n...Oh? This conversation is most interesting. However... I cannot allow you to speak with Mr. Gustavia.\nGregory:\nVon Karma...!\nvon Karma:\nI have already conducted my interrogation of him. It is not necessary for him to speak any further, especially to a mere defense attorney. Tsk tsk tsk... but I will answer your questions in that fool's place.\nGregory:\n(...It seems Von Karma intends to prevent me from meeting Gustavia in person.) I understand. In that case, I have but one thing to ask you.\nvon Karma:\n...Yes?\nGregory:\nI would like to know the relationship between Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover.\n-- Their Connection --\nvon Karma:\nGustavia and Dover's relationship?\nIt's obvious the only relationship they had was that they happened to participate in the same contest.\nGregory:\n...That's it?\nvon Karma:\nHmph... There is nothing more to say.\nRay:\nWhat! How are we supposed to understand anything from so little...!?\nGregory:\nIf we want Von Karma to divulge the truth, we have no choice but to present evidence. ...It's all too obvious that he's hiding something.\n\nGregory: Gregory: Are you sure Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover aren't linked in some way? von Karma: Hmph... Do not interrupt me with your baseless allegations. If we were in court right now I'd have you held in contempt. Ray: I don't think Von Karma has that kind of authority though... Badd: Von Karma... is famous... for having even the judges wrapped around his finger... Ray: WHAAAAAAAA!? That's insane! Gregory: (...Seems like it won't be easy to go against him in court.) Prosecutor von Karma. Please continue your argument.\nGregory: Gregory: It may have been a coincidence that the two participated in the same contest... ...however, you can't say for sure that they weren't connected. von Karma: von Karma: Defense attorney. How many times must I tell you... If you have no evidence to challenge my argument, be silent! Gregory: ...... (I'll be silent for now, then. So I need to show evidence of a link between Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover...) von Karma: ...Your mouth may be silent, but your eyes tell me everything. What is it you want to say!? Gregory: (D... Does he want me to speak or be silent!?)\nGregory: It would seem Von Karma does not want us to know Gustavia and Dover's real connection.\nRay: Maybe the connection between those two puts the prosecution at a disadvantage?\nGregory: (Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover should have had something in common. I should enlighten Von Karma on this fact.)",

I should enlighten Von Karma on this fact.)\nGregory:\nProsecutor von Karma. I'd like you to look at these desserts. The desserts were made for the contest's semifinals. ...Don't you think these two have a particularly impressive design?\nvon Karma:\nHmph! Just what are you getting at?\nGregory:\nThese two desserts were made by Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover. I wouldn't exactly call Mr. Gustavia's design skills praiseworthy. And yet, for the semifinals, he was able to produce something comparable to Mr. Dover's. Furthermore, these two desserts have the exact same flavor.\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\n...What are you trying to say?\nGregory:\nI'm saying it's possible they collaborated with each other on their entries! Prosecutor von Karma. Please take a closer look at their desserts. At first glance, they may look completely different... But even though the designs are different, it's clear they were made from the same materials!\nvon Karma:\n......Is that so?\nGregory:\nThe same flavor and composition... It's impossible to dismiss their similarity as coincidence. The very existence of these two desserts points to a link between Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover!\nvon Karma:\n...Hmph. Since you already know this much, I'll tell you the truth.\nGregory:\n! (Did Von Karma know about their collaboration...?)\nvon Karma:\nHowever... what I am about to say is not going to help your case at all.\n-- Their Real Connection --\nvon Karma:\nIf you want to know about Gustavia and Dover's connection so badly, I'll tell you.\nLast night, when I interrogated Gustavia, he told me about his connection with Dover.\nUntil the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together.\nGregory:\nYou knew about their cooperation all this time, didn't you? Why would you conceal the truth?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nI would appreciate it if you didn't sully my reputation. Until I explain my points in court, I avoid giving away unnecessary details. I was merely saving you time.\nGregory:\n(How can he act like this and keep the truth from us...? His concealment of the truth... is something I simply cannot ignore!)\n\nGregory: Gregory: It seems you knew about their real connection all along. Why did you hide it from us...!? von Karma: Tsk tsk tsk... I would never divulge information to a mere insect such as yourself so easily. ...I am not a fool like that detective after all. Badd: ! I... was just doing things... my way. von Karma: Hmph! It was because you defied me that he gained this information in the first place.\nGregory: Gregory: Last night... that was after Mr. Dover's sculptures had melted, right? von Karma: Yes. Afterwards, I went to interrogate Gustavia personally. Ray: I-Interrogated by Von Karma? Uuugh... Sounds scary. Gregory: Knowing Mr. Gustavia, I feel like he probably tried to meditate through the interrogation. von Karma: The moment he closed his eyes... ...I snapped my fingers, like, so, to show him that no one remains silent in front of me! Gregory: (And did that... have any effect?) von Karma: Because of that, I was able to get a perfect a perfect confession about his connection with Dover.\nGregory: Gregory: Why do you think Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover collaborated? von Karma: Why? Because Gustavia had poor design sense, and Dover was a novice at baking. Without the help of each other, they would never have made it through a single round. Gregory: ...If so, what was their mutual goal? Why cooperate until the finals? von Karma: \"The finals will be fought on our own merits\", Gustavia said, and he ended their collaboration. Gustavia's goal was to obtain the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef. It seems his pride as a pastry chef won out in the end.

Gregory: (So he believes that their cooperation only went as far as the semifinals... ...but what if it really continued through the finals?) ...Prosecutor von Karma.

For the finals, they were on their own.\"\nGregory: Gregory: Concerning your statement about Mr. Gustavia's designs... I've no objections to that. Ray: I have... no objections either. He's got no sense of style. von Karma: When I saw him attempting to fashion my likeness with candy... Hmph! Just thinking about it disgusts me! Badd: I actually liked his candy crafting, though... von Karma: A novice pastry chef, and one with no sense of design. ...It's only natural such pathetic specimens would associate with each other.\nGregory: Gregory: They cooperated the day before, but not the day itself...? That seems highly unnatural, don't you think? von Karma: von Karma: What I am saying is only the truth. How \"unnatural\" it is matters not! Gregory: (But weren't you \"unnaturally\" concealing that very same truth just a minute ago? There must have been a reason he hid this fact from us...!)\nGregory: Mr. Master said Mr. Dover was the favorite to win at the finals.\nRay: Which means he must have still been cooperating with Mr. Gustavia at the time, right?\nGregory: ...Yes, that is what I believe.

That's strange...\nvon Karma:\n......\nGregory:\nDelicia testified that \"Dover's sherbet was most delicious.\" Being a novice chef, I doubt he could have done all that by himself. Perhaps the two of them cooperated during the finals as well?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nDefense attorney! How many times do I have to tell you! Delicia Scones' subjective opinion cannot be admitted as evidence! There is still a chance that a novice chef could make something tasty! My wife is an amateur, yet her cooking rivals that of world class chefs!\nGregory:\n(...How is THAT not a subjective opinion!)\nvon Karma:\nMoreover... even if you take this pharmacist's testimony to be true, it changes nothing. She also mentioned that a part of his sherbet was very salty. Which means you can hardly call his entry for the finals perfect!\nGregory:\nN... Nnghhoooh!\nvon Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... What, no more objections?\nGregory:\n(Is there no way I can prove their collaboration...?)\nRay:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth. There's something that's been bugging me...\nGregory:\nHm... What is it?\nRay:\nThe desserts Mr. Dover made for the finals would have taken a long time to make, right?\nGregory:\nIndeed... They were frozen sculptures after all.\nRay:\nHow would he have had the time to sculpt it after it was frozen? Let alone help Mr. Gustavia with his design as well...\nGregory:\n!\nRay:\nThe way I see it, just waiting for the sherbet to freeze would have used up all of his time. Hmm... Just how was he able to make those sherbet sculptures?\nGregory:\n.....Raymond. You may have a promising future after all. Thanks to you, I have noticed one more possibility.\nRay:\n......?\nGregory:\n(That's right... Mr. Dover's sherbet needed time to freeze properly. And the contest's time limit would not have been enough. The method Mr. Dover used to make his sherbet within the time limit was...)\nIt was prepared in advance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"(If the sherbet was prepared in advance, all he'd need to do was sculpt it...!)\"\nIt was frozen on that day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(Maybe he somehow... managed to freeze it on that day... Heh... What's gotten into me? If that were the case, my logic wouldn't hold up. Mr. Dover's sherbet needed time to freeze properly.)\nLeads back to:\n\"(And the contest's time limit would not have been enough.)\"\nThey weren't desserts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n(Perhaps those sculptures weren't desserts to begin with... Delicia's teeth would have to be amazingly strong to bite through that! ...In other words, this theory is impossible. Mr. Dover's sherbet needed time to freeze properly.)\nLeads back to:\n\"(And the contest's time limit would not have been enough.)\"\nGregory:\n(If the sherbet was prepared in advance, all he'd need to do was sculpt it...!)\nvon Karma:\nYou... Just what are you mumbling about?\nGregory:\n...Please excuse me. I've finally realized. Your earlier view... was correct.\nRay:\nHuh!? M-Mr. Edgeworth...?\nBadd:\n...What are you doing...?\nvon Karma:\nOh? So you're finally admitting defeat?\nGregory:\nNo... All I am admitting to is the truth of one of your statements. \"Dover and Gustavia's collaboration lasted only until the day before the finals.\" It is exactly as you said, they only cooperated until the day before the finals.\nvon Karma:\n.....\nGregory:\nThe sculptures in Mr. Dover's room were all made out of sherbet. ...Such an amount would most likely need to be left overnight to freeze. Which means Mr. Gustavia prepared Mr. Dover's sherbet in advance the day before!\nvon Karma:\n......Hmph. That's right. So you realize Gustavia's cooperation ended the day before the finals.\nGregory:\nThen, why did Mr. Dover not help Mr. Gustavia in return?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\n...The views of the dead are of no concern to me.\nGregory:\nGregory:\nIf you aren't going to answer that, I'll need to get in touch with Mr. Gustavia himself. Or was your interrogation not quite as thorough as you claim?\nvon Karma:\nYou ingrate... You dare mock me!\nGregory:\nThat was not my intention, but I do have a problem with your attitude. I want you to give us a clear reason why we can't speak to Mr. Gustavia in person.\nvon Karma:\nHmph. A clear reason? Gustavia and Dover's collaboration has no bearing on this case.\nGregory:\nGregory:\nYou claim their collaboration is irrelevant? If Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover's relationship had turned sour... ...it could serve as a motive for murder!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nYou're saying that Gustavia and Dover's collaboration was linked to the motive for the murder...? If that were the case, why did he not conceal it? After all, we found out about this collaboration from Gustavia himself!\nGregory:\n!\nvon Karma:\nIf you really are a lawyer, show us evidence that gives us reason to suspect Gustavia!\nGregory:\n...... (Only one of Mr. Gustavia's actions has been suspicious so far. Doubtless Von Karma already knows of this facts. This... could be a trap by Von Karma.)\nvon Karma:\nHmph... What's wrong, defense attorney? Not going to answer?\nGregory:\n(But... I mustn't back down now!) Mr. Gustavia sneaked into Mr. Dover's room. His reasons for this are currently unclear. But the very fact he secretly entered the victim's room is reason enough to suspect him!\nvon Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... If that's the extent of it, I can dispel those doubts.\nGregory:\n(I knew it. Was it a trap after all...?)\nvon Karma:\nI was intending to save this for the courtroom, but I'll make a special exception. We wouldn't want to prolong the trial with unnecessary information, would we? ....Take a look at this.\nGregory:\nThis is...!\nvon Karma:\nThis is a photo of Gustavia and Dover... and their sons.\nFamily Photo added to the Court Record.\nvon Karma:\nGustavia entered Dover's room in order to steal this photo.\nGregory:\nTo steal the photo...?\nvon Karma:\nIt seems their sons attended the same elementary school. Apparently he thought that he'd be suspected if people find out he and Dover were acquainted. Yes... just like you're doing now!\nGregory:\nNgh...!\nvon Karma:\nThere is nothing suspicious about Gustavia's actions! No further room for argument!\nGregory:\nNghoooooooooooooooooooooooooooh!\nGregory:\n(He's still adamant on not letting us meet with Mr. Gustavia...!)\nvon Karma:\n...I have an investigation to return to. I have no more time to waste on the likes of you.\nRay:\nCurse that Von Karma! Calling us a waste of time! What should we do... Mr. Edgeworth! At this rate, Master Jeff will be...!\nGregory:\nVon Karma is... busy? (Of course... Why would he be so busy? Both the body and murder weapon have been found, and he already has his suspect. The police should have more than enough evidence to prove Mr. Master's guilt. If that's the case, then why is Von Karma still investigating the crime scene?)\nRay:\nMr. Edgeworth...? Is there something wrong?\nGregory:\n...It seems I have been overlooking a matter of vital importance. Considering that he already has the evidence he needs to convict Mr. Master... I feel that Von Karma isn't as composed as he should be. He didn't even tell Detective Badd the full results of the investigation.\nBadd:\nYeah... Von Karma's a bit on edge at the moment... He still... hasn't received the autopsy report. (No autopsy report - A day after the incident, the autopsy report still has not arrived.)\nGregory:\nFurthermore... something vanished from the crime scene, and we still don't know why.\nGregory:\nDetective Badd. Please look at the crime scene carefully once more. The bloodstain (Bloodstain disappeared - The victim's blood was not found in Mr. Master's room.) that should have remained at the crime scene has disappeared!\nBadd:\n...! I definitely... didn't get any reports about the bloodstain being cleaned up...\nGregory:\nBut the strangest thing we found wasn't in Mr. Master's room at all...\nBadd:\n...It's a match. The blood in the fountain... is Dover's (Blood in the water fountain - Traces of Dover's blood was found in the fountain water.).\nGregory:\n(Mr. Dover's blood vanished from Mr. Master's room... And somehow found its way into the fountain. What does this mean?)\nConnect \"Bloodstain disappeared\" and \"Blood in the water fountain\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"(Although the victim's blood wasn't found in Mr. Master's room...)\"\nGregory:\n(Although the victim's blood wasn't found in Mr. Master's room... It was detected in the water fountain. There would be no need for the killer to conceal the bloodstains after the body was found. It's unnatural that only the bloodstains that were found with the body disappeared. Unless the body was moved, the blood would have still remained on the chocolate. Don't tell me... someone removed the body (Was the body removed? - Blood vanished from the scene because body was removed?) and then erased the bloodstains?)\nConnect \"No autopsy report\" and \"Was the body removed?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"(It's possible that the body was removed from the crime scene...)\"\nGregory:\n(It's possible that the body was removed from the crime scene... And the autopsy report still has not arrived. Although we have a murder weapon and a suspect, we don't know much about the body... I've been investigating under the assumption that the body had been discovered... Perhaps this assumption was wrong from the very beginning...! Why didn't Von Karma give Detective Badd the autopsy report? To understand that... yes, I must turn my logic around! My thinking shouldn't be \"why is Von Karma hiding information about the body.\" But rather, \"what if Von Karma doesn't even have the information to begin with?\" ...What happens if I think of it like that? It's possible that the body wasn't removed by the police for autopsy... It was moved and hidden by the real killer!)\nRay:\nMr. Edgeworth...?\nGregory:\n...I've heard many dark rumors surrounding Von Karma. He's a prosecutor who forges evidence, fabricates testimonies and makes backroom deals.\nRay:\nYeah, I've heard that too! But... what does that have to do with this?\nGregory:\nI try to avoid judging others based on rumors. And I didn't let those rumors influence my opinion on Von Karma... Until today. It seems... he is a man who would distort the truth.\nRay:\nDistort the truth...? You don't mean... forgery...!\nGregory:\n...I do. (And I can't allow him to get away with this...!)\nvon Karma:\n...I must return to the Prosecutors' Office for now. Not a word to that attorney.\nForensics:\nRoger!\nGregory:\nvon Karma:\n...What do you want, defense attorney?\nGregory:\nI want to know the truth that you've been hiding.\nvon Karma:\nFool... Are you trying to mislead the police's investigation again!? If you interfere with the investigation any more, I'll be forced to reprimand you myself!\nGregory:\nGregory:\n\"Police\" ...no. My objection is with you!\nvon Karma:\n.....What?\nGregory:\nIsn't it a prosecutor's job to ensure justice for criminals...!?\nvon Karma:\nHmph... What are you saying? I have no time to debate the job of a prosecutor with you. However, I will tell you one more thing. My job is to ensure all those I prosecute are found guilty. Before the perfect proof, there can be no room for doubt.\nGregory:\nGregory:\nAnd to find that perfect proof, you would even stoop to forgery?\nvon Karma:\nHa! I was wondering what you were going on about... You intend to accuse me of forgery, don't you?\nGregory:\n.....Yes. And it's for that reason... you did not allow Detective Badd to investigate.\nvon Karma:\n...!\nBadd:\n....What do you mean...?\nGregory:\nThe real reason Detective Badd wasn't investigating was not so he could keep an eye on us. It was to hide the fact you never found the body!\nBadd:\nWha...!\nRay:\nThey never... found the body...?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nYou cretins! You WILL cease with these ludicrous accusations! I will not tolerate any further insults!\nGregory:\nIn that case, let us verify the body! If you do, we will have evidence that shows whether I am right or not!\nvon Karma:\n.....Ngh! Tsk tsk tsk... The burden of proof falls on you, defense attorney! I have no reason to comply with your baseless conjecture!\nGregory:\nGregory:\nYou must have noticed it too. The lack of bloodstains at the crime scene. So why did the blood vanish? And more importantly... Where did it go?\nvon Karma:\nFoolishness. Why would anyone erase just the blood in the chest that contained the body!?\nGregory:\nYes... that's exactly right. If the body had been found there, the disappearing bloodstains would have no meaning at all. ...However, what if the body was already gone? To erase the traces of the body being there, one would have to get rid of the bloodstains as well!\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\nWhy make such a fuss over those bloodstains. It seems like a trivial detail to me. Or, are you saying that you can show me where those bloodstains went!?\nGregory:\n\"In court, everything must be said with evidence.\" ...Isn't that right, Von Karma? In that case, I'll show you the evidence supporting my claim! (Which piece of evidence shows where the blood in Mr. Master's room went?)\nPresent Victim's Blood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There were traces of the victim's blood found in the fountain.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGregory:\n\nGregory:\nAs you can clearly see... this is where the blood disappeared to!\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nI see no problem. With this flawed logic, you're the one who should disappear!\nGregory:\nNnghhoooh! (I-I can't just disappear!)\nvon Karma:\nTypical defense attorney. I have no time for you! I must be going!\nGregory:\n\nGregory:\nV-Von Karma! W-Wait, please look at this first!\nLeads back to:\n\"(Which piece of evidence shows where the blood in Mr. Master's room went?)\"\nGregory:\nThere were traces of the victim's blood found in the fountain.\nvon Karma:\n.....\nGregory:\nTraces of Mr. Master's chocolate were also found in this very fountain. In other words, the blood was washed down the stream, which then flowed into the fountain. All of this points to only one possibility! After the body was removed, someone erased the bloodstains!\nvon Karma:\nGah.....!\nGregory:\nVon Karma. Where was the body really found? If you really found the body, you should be able to answer!\nvon Karma:\n...You... How, how do you know this information!? How do you know the results of the water composition test on the fountain...!?\nBadd:\n...Because I allowed them to investigate.\nvon Karma:\nBadd...! Always a thorn in my side...! From here on out, I will not allow you to associate any further with this case!\nBadd:\nHmph... it's not like you were letting me do much anyway...\nGregory:\n...Von Karma. You still haven't answered my question. Or... are you admitting to the fact that you didn't find the body after all?\nvon Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... You say I never found the body? Where is your evidence?\nGregory:\n! (He's never going to confess...!)\nvon Karma:\nI have nothing further to say to you. Gregory Edgeworth... This matter will be decided in court. We'll see just how well your logic holds up there!\nGregory:\nVon Karma...! I know your methods are wrong! I promise, without fail... I will expose the truth you've hidden!\nGregory:\n...Detective Badd, I'm sorry. It's because you let me investigate that...\nBadd:\nNo... this was bound to happen... sooner or later. This is also... the first time... I have been restricted in my investigation... ...Your theory that they never found the body sounds pretty close to the mark.\nGregory:\nThat... I will make clear in court.\nBadd:\nHeh... if there's anything I can do to help, let me know. Even though... I'm no longer in charge of this case...\nGregory:\nThen... though I'm very sorry about this, I have one more favor to ask of you.\nRay:\nHey, what are you guys whispering about? I wanna know too!\nGregory:\nHeh... this will be my trump card in court. The information I've gathered up until now should be enough to prove Mr. Master's innocence. ...But, if all else fails, I'll have this ready.\nRay:\nYour trump card...?\nGregory:\nHe heh... you'll see at the trial.\nRay:\nWow! I get to be at the trial too!?\nGregory:\nOf course. You are my assistant after all.\nRay:\nHe he heh... I'll be an Ace Attorney too next year! Von Karma will never beat the two of us!\nGregory:\n...Right. Although I hope to clear Mr. Master's name before you become a lawyer... If Von Karma is to be my opponent... he'll want the trial ended in a day.\nRay:\nThat's right... we have to save Master Jeff as fast as we can! After all, this is you we're talking about... I'm sure you'll beat Von Karma!\nGregory:\n(Jeff Master, alone in a dark cell, arrested on false charges. I must expose Von Karma's lies if I am to save him...!)\nTo be continued.\nApril 2, 2:10 PMZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio\nRay:\n...And that's all Uncle Ray knows about the IS-7 Incident.\nEdgeworth:\n(So that's what happened in my father's last case... The truth of the IS-7 Incident.)\nKay:\nWhat happened at the trial?\nRay:\nIn the end... Von Karma defeated us.\nKay:\nEh...! So, you couldn't prove Mr. Master's innocence?\nRay:\nWe had gathered plenty of evidence to prove it. But, Von Karma was even more despicable than we thought.\nEdgeworth:\nHe was... a prosecutor who would do anything for his guilty verdict.\nRay:\nThat's right... and he really did use any means necessary. Because of this, the trial dragged on for about a year, until it finally reached a conclusion. I'll never forget that fateful day, when the judgement was passed down. The 28th of December. It's April now... So it's been a little over 17 years. How time flies...\nEdgeworth:\n(...The 28th of December, 17 years ago. I was watching from the gallery that day...)\nRay:\n...Before the trial, your old man noticed that Mr. Master was acting strangely. He was at the breaking point, both mentally and physically. He wanted to be found guilty...\nKay:\nNo... Mr. Master didn't fake a confession, did he...?\nRay:\nYeah... That was what Von Karma was aiming for from the start. When your old man tried to expose the fact that the body had not been found... ...Von Karma used the power of his police cronies to quash that argument. ...He even went as far as to prepare a fake autopsy report. Then... they made Mr. Master give a false testimony, and confess to being an accomplice. With Mr. Master's confession, the situation quickly became dire... But... your old man had a trump card up his sleeve.\nEdgeworth:\nWas that the trump card he was talking to Detective Badd about...?\nRay:\nYeah. That trump card was to be our insurance, in case Mr. Master confessed. He had asked Detective Badd to have Mr. Master's interrogation recorded.\nKay:\nDetective Badd... wanted to know the truth too, huh.\nRay:\nAfter he was dropped from the investigation, he never stopped caring about the case. Even when he was involved with other large cases... He really was the definition of a true detective. The defense presented the recording, which proved that the confession was forced. Well, it seems the detective in charge of the initial investigation and interrogation... ...Rip Lacer, took all of the blame and was charged and dismissed. Still, at the trial, your old man exposed Von Karma's corruption, and... ...Von Karma received his first penalty from the then chief prosecutor.\nEdgeworth:\nThe only penalty in his 40 years of prosecution...\nRay:\nHowever... Mr. Master didn't want the trial to continue any longer. And the curtains closed on the trial that day with the verdict of \"guilty\"...\nEdgeworth:\n(My memory of that time is fuzzy, but... I was also there, watching my father's final trial. And I think his final regret... became my own.)\nRay:\nYour old man wanted a retrial to prove Master's innocence. But... he passed on before he could fulfill his wish... ...after getting entangled in another case...\nEdgeworth:\n......\nRay:\nIt breaks my heart even now... that I didn't return home with him that day. And what's more, to blind myself from my own worthlessness... ...Uncle Ray put all of his hatred on you, as a traitor for being Von Karma's pupil. ...I'm sorry.\nEdgeworth:\nDon't be... It's natural you would hate me. After I became a prosecutor... I was able to get Von Karma to show me the case file. Mr. Master was found guilty for the murder of Isaac Dover...\nRay:\n...Eh, that's not right. Wasn't Mr. Master found guilty of being an accomplice?\nEdgeworth:\nBut, this case file says, \"guilty of murder\"... There shouldn't be anything unresolved in the cases handled by Manfred von Karma.\nRay:\n...Wait, can I take a look at that file? ! ...It looks the charges have been re-written.\nEdgeworth:\nWha...!\nRay:\nLook at this.\nEdgeworth:\nThe charge is... \"accomplice to murder\"?\nRay:\nThis is a copy of the original case file I received from the courts.\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would the charge be altered?\nRay:\nThis file... was given to you by Von Karma, right? Maybe he just didn't want you to know the truth, since you're Gregory's son. He would have wanted to avoid another retrial before the statute of limitations ran out after all.\nEdgeworth:\nSo what I had come to believe back then, had all been a lie...\nRay:\n...If you didn't know about it, just make sure you know it from now on.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nRay:\nThe statute of limitations has long expired, but the truth still sleeps, right here. After your old man passed away, Uncle Ray took over as Mr. Master's defense attorney. Although Von Karma also had another prosecutor take over the case... Perhaps he thought that since his opponent was a rookie... he didn't even need to turn up. In the end the real killer was never found... and Mr. Master was found guilty.\nKay:\nNo...! Is there nothing we can do, even now?\nRay:\nSince the killer was never found, he can't withdraw his confession. I found out after the trial that... ...Mr. Master made a deal with Von Karma because Von Karma had threatened him... \"If you don't confess, Katherine Hall will be held under the same charges.\"\nKay:\nThat's terrible...!\nRay:\nI don't think Mr. Master really thought that Kate was the killer, but... ...to protect her, he faked a confession. ...Miles. On the day that Knightley-boy was killed, why do you think Uncle Ray was at the prison?\nKay:\n...Ah, I see!\nEdgeworth:\nYou went to see Mr. Master, didn't you...?\nRay:\nI said I'd visit him every day. I couldn't keep that promise, but... ...I asked Katie-pie to look in on him for me when I couldn't. Through rain or snow she went... every single day without fail. But... nothing has changed, and Mr. Master still serves his punishment.\nKay:\nThat's so sad...! Isn't there anything we can do?\nRay:\n...That's why I came here. Because, I knew those \"ice sculptures\" would be on display here today. ...So, what are you going to do, Miles?\nEdgeworth:\nI am a prosecutor. My position is different from you and my father...\nRay:\nMiles...\nEdgeworth:\nBut, moving past my position, what I want as Miles Edgeworth... Is to know the truth of these two cases. It is for that reason that... I am here.\nRay:\nHe he he... You really are your father's son. Well then! If that's what you've decided, I'll support you all the way! I'd better leave the IS-7 documents and evidence with you then! Alright, here are the documents. By the way, the parts in orange are Uncle Ray's old notes.\nIS-7 Incident File updated in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\n...Thank you.\nRay:\nAnd now, here's the IS-7 evidence. There's a lot, so make sure to look it over while you investigate.\nReceived a lot of IS-7 evidence from Mr. Shields.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... Right. (I'll check through it later...)\nKay:\nAnyway, there are so many strange things about this case.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed... Those involved in the case 18 years ago have reunited, and another incident occurs... (Replicas of the statues from 18 years ago were displayed in the Winter Palace, and... Poison gas was released in the Autumn Palace, which had been disguised as the Winter Palace. The two chemicals in the Pisces case... Normallium and Fatallium, were mixed, causing an outbreak of poison gas... The victim of the poison gas was Dane Gustavia. A person involved in the IS-7 Incident. Because he was unconscious, he received treatment in the Zodiac Art Gallery's infirmary... Finally, the dead body found floating in the fountain... ...And once again, the ice sculptures have melted.) There are deep connections between the two cases. ...It's possible there are still some clues left from 18 years ago.\nKay:\nRight! Let's get started!\nDebeste:\nDebeste:\nJuuuust one second! Don't tell me you've forgotten about me? Didn't I tell you that I'm the one in charge of this case?\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. If you intend to continue disrupting Sebastian's investigation... ...the world \"Guilty\" will be added to your P.I.C. report.\nEdgeworth:\n(...What does she mean \"guilty\"?) Please allow me to assist in your investigation as before.\nCourtney:\nI appreciate your proposal, but I'm afraid I must overrule it.\nKay:\n...That was fast.\nCourtney:\nEven though we're short on hands to identify the victim right now... ..it's only a matter of time until we figure it out.\nEdgeworth:\n...In that case, I shall take that load off your shoulders at once. Regarding the identity of the unidentified body... One person comes to mind.\nDebeste:\nReally!? Then tell us!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Very well.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's not just the sculptures that have made a comeback from the incident 18 years ago... The body in the fountain is...!)\nPresent Isaac Dover profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It's likely that the identity of the body is the victim of the murder that occured here 18 years ago.\"\nPresent anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI think there is a very high chance that the body belongs to this person!\nDebeste:\nWhat!? A-Ah, I got it...!\nCourtney:\nThat's absolutely impossible. Are you trying to disrupt the investigation!?\nEdgeworth:\nA-Ah, my apologies...!\nDebeste:\nHa ha, serves you right! I knew all along you were wrong!\nEdgeworth:\n(Then why did you say, \"I got it\" earlier...!) ...Please allow me to try again.\nLeads back to:\n\"(It's not just the sculptures that have made a comeback from the incident 18 years ago...)\"\nEdgeworth:\nIt's likely that the identity of the body is the victim of the murder that occurred here 18 years ago. ...Isaac Dover.\nDelicia:\nEhhhhhh! It's Icy's body!?\nDebeste:\nHey! Who's that!? I've never heard of him!\nCourtney:\nMr. Isaac Dover... A truly great sculptor. But he was better known as Pierre Hoquet. The sculptures on display here in the museum are all his creations.\nDebeste:\nAh, so in other words, that sculptor was the best. Somehow, I feel a strong kinship to him.\nCourtney:\nAnd... he was the victim in the IS-7 Incident.\nEdgeworth:\n! (She knew about the IS-7 Incident...)\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. The IS-7 Incident occurred 18 years ago. And what's more, the police reported the removal of the body.\nRay:\nThat's what's on the record. But... I wonder if that really is the truth?\nCourtney:\n...What are you saying?\nRay:\nThe defense attorney in the IS-7 Incident claimed that the body was never found. ...Not that the prosecution would ever admit to such a thing.\nCourtney:\n.....\nDebeste:\nHello... Eh! Really!\nCourtney:\n...Is something wrong, Sebastian?\nDebeste:\nNo... it's just, they said that they know who the victim is.\nCourtney:\n!\nDebeste:\nIt's just as that prosecutor says, it's Dover...\nCourtney:\nNo... it can't be!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... (It would seem my father's suspicion were correct.) What is it, Judge Courtney? Have you finally realized that I'm much helpful than Mr. Debeste?\nDebeste:\nHey... You! Are you trying to steal Debeste position for yourself!?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm doing no such thing. I just want to know the truth. And for that to happen, we need to cooperate, no?\nCourtney:\nThe truth... is none of your concern.\nRay:\nRay:\nI don't think that's true, Courtney-pie.\nCourtney:\nYou again...!\nRay:\nUncle Ray assisted the defense attorney involved in the IS-7 Incident. The one who claimed that Mr. Dover's body was never found.\nCourtney:\n.....!\nRay:\nThe prosecution denied it at the time, but now the body has been discovered here. ...In other words, the IS-7 investigation was unjust. And, isn't it the duty of the P.I.C. to investigate corrupt prosecutors?\nCourtney:\nUuuh....!\nRay:\nThen, wouldn't you want to cooperate with those who were involved in the case? ...Unless, you have an ulterior motive?\nCourtney:\n!\nEdgeworth:\n(Now that I think about it... Judge Courtney knew about the IS-7 Incident. So it would seem she really is here because of the P.I.C.)\nCourtney:\nEven if you're related to the incident, I don't see how Prosecutor Edgeworth is.\nRay:\nHe is the son of the attorney in that case, and a prosecutor taught by Von Karma himself. And what's more... he was in the audience at the IS-7 trial. I'm sure there are many points he can enlighten us on.\nCourtney:\nUrgh...! ...Very well. I will allow you to cooperate. However, your investigation must not hinder the other investigators. The Winter Palace is currently being investigated, but the Fountain Patio is open to you.\nRay:\nThat's my Courtney-pie! Now we're talking! As thanks, I will allow you to have a hug with Uncle Ray!\nCourtney:\nOverruled. If I feel your cooperation isn't needed, I will have to ask you to leave.\nEdgeworth:\n...Understood.\nRay:\nAhh... Isn't that great, Miles? Now we can start investigating.\nEdgeworth:\n...You really helped us there.\nRay:\nHe he he. Uncle Ray did it all for himself.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph...\nRay:\nAlright! Uncle Ray's going to investigate too, so let me know if you figure something out.\nEdgeworth:\nGot it. Right then... Kay, let's begin the investigation.\nKay:\nOK! Let's do this!\nEdgeworth:\nWe still don't know... ...where Mr. Dover's body and the Normallium were hidden.\nKay:\nWe don't have enough information to go on.\nEdgeworth:\nYou're right. Our first priority is the Normallium.\nKay:\nWell, Normallium is used in washing detergents, paints and the like.\nEdgeworth:\nIf I recall... it's a red liquid with a minty aroma (Minty aroma - Normallium is a red liquid with a minty aroma.).\nKay:\nWell then, let's get looking for that Normallium!\nBegin Investigation\nZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nYeah, what's up?\n\n\n\nNotice anything?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nI wonder if this case and the IS-7 Incident are connected somehow?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's hard to say for certain right now, but I also don't think they are completely unrelated.\nKay:\nBut your father was in charge of the IS-7 Incident, right? This can't be just a coincidence, it must be destined by fate! Let's solve both of these cases! I'll make sure to steal the \"truth\" for you!\nEdgeworth:\nThat sounds promising. Now then, to the task at hand... Let's resume the investigation of the Normallium.\nKay:\nIt's a red liquid with a minty aroma, right? Let's go ask around!\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThat's a really cool badge. It depicts a blazing sun on top of winter frost, right?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. It symbolizes the severity of the criminal justice system.\nKay:\nMy badge has symbols too! U-Uh Umm... It symbolizes Love and Justice and Peace and Courage and Honor and Kindness!\nEdgeworth:\n(What happened to \"Truth\"?)\n\n\n\n\nFluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nIt sure looks nice... I really like the color! I wonder if it's possible to use this to make a cloak?\nEdgeworth:\nKay... No, never mind.\nKay:\n?\nEdgeworth:\n(That would make it easier to catch her, but... let's not tell her for now.)\n\n\n\n\nPisces Sketch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThe Pisces Sculpture shedding tears of blood... It's certainly a fishy sketch.\nEdgeworth:\n........\nKay:\nAh, was it too hard to get? The \"Pisces\" being \"fishy\"...?\nEdgeworth:\nKay, that's enough. You're interrupting my concentration.\nKay:\nMy efforts to lighten the mood have gone unappreciated yet again...\n\n\n\n\nAngel's Recipe Book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThe Angel's Recipe... It makes my heart skip a beat!\nEdgeworth:\nPlease don't steal it.\nKay:\nThat's all you ever go on about, Mr. Edgeworth! Just what kind of person do you think I am!?\nEdgeworth:\n...Aren't you a Great Thief?\nKay:\nThat's right, I'm the Great Thief Yatagarasu! So the \"truth\" is the only thing I'll ever still!\nEdgeworth:\nWell then, why does that make your heart skip a beat?\nKay:\nA-A person doesn't need a reason for their heart to skip a beat!\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nI believe that even a Great Thief has rights. For example, we have the right to choose what we want to steal.\nEdgeworth:\n(I guess she doesn't consider this valuable.)\nHuman statues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThey're statues of a couple in Roman costume. Are these by Pierre Hoquet too?\nEdgeworth:\nI think these were made in the middle years of his life, at the height of his fame. He modeled them after the Roman gods, at the request of his beloved wife. The piece is entitled... \"Venus, the Goddess of Beauty, and Her Manservent.\"\nKay:\n...I think it's obvious who wore the pants in that relationship.\nSpring Palace door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThere's a vase of tulips in front of this door.\nEdgeworth:\nProbably because this is the \"Spring Palace.\"\nKay:\nY'know, speaking of spring... It's the moving season! People who have just moved always let their guard down... So, it's also thieving season!\nEdgeworth:\nAs a Great Thief, don't you think burglary is a little beneath you?\nKay:\nUgh... Y-You're right.\nLarry Butz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarry:\nHey, Edgey! Move out of the way!\nEdgeworth:\nMmph... Wh-What is it now?\nLarry:\nI'm in the middle of sketching Justy in all her beauty! I got a feeling this is gonna be my masterpiece! Quit getting in the way of my art!\nKay:\nReally! How much have you drawn so far?\nLarry:\nWell, I only just decided on the composition. The drawing part starts now!\nEdgeworth:\nIsn't it a bit early to be calling it your masterpiece?\nKay:\nWell, this is Laurice we're talking about, after all!\nStatues on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nSculptures of a man with the face of a moon and a woman with the face of a sun. The man looks kinda gloomy though... Were these also made by Pierre Hoquet?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it seems he made these in his youth, when he was enthralled with the stars. The piece likens the relationship between the moon and the sun to something closer to home. The piece is entitled... \"My Parents\".\nKay:\n...I think we know who wore the pants in that marriage.\nTea cart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nOn this service cart, Ms. Hall has prepared her tea set.\nKay:\nAccording to the pamphlet, the museum is also famous for its tea.\nEdgeworth:\nYes. It certainly had a flavorful, rich taste.\nKay:\nHmm... It seems this tea set was also made by Mr. Dover.\nEdgeworth:\nOh? So the tea set was made by the victim? ...Let's take a closer look.\n\n\n\n\nSubsequent times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nTablecloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's not a single stain on this pure white tablecloth.\nKay:\n...Take hold of the edge, and focus your mind. Then in one go... pull!\nEdgeworth:\nKay, I hope you're not planning to do anything bad.\nKay:\nN... No, don't worry! Even if I fail, the table cloth would just be dyed a nice black à la tea.\nEdgeworth:\nThe tablecloth looks better white. Please refrain from changing it.\nKay:\nI wonder about that. It might look better in another color... Like pink, or blue... ...or tea.\nEdgeworth:\n......\n\n\n\n\nTea set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"So, this tea set was made by Isaac Dover...\"\n\n\n\n\nTea container\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is a container with Ceylon tea leaves in it. To prevent exposure to sunlight and moisture, the container is airtight and made of tin. This should help preserve the quality of the tea leaves.\nSummer Palace door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThere's a vase of sunflowers in front of this door.\nEdgeworth:\nProbably because this is the \"Summer Palace.\"\nKay:\nY'know, speaking of summer... It's bonus season! Fat wallets stuffed with cash... Which means, it's also thieving season!\nEdgeworth:\nAs a Great Thief, don't you think pickpocketing is a little beneath you?\nKay:\nUgh... I-I guess so.\nStain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. This smell and this color... Don't tell me this is a puddle of tea!\nKay:\nHuh? There's a piece of pottery in the middle of the puddle.\nPottery Shard data jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay:\nI wonder what broke?\nEdgeworth:\n(I think... I recognize the design. I should probably show this to that man and see what he has to say.)\nRaymond Shield\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nMiles. How's the investigation going?\nEdgeworth:\nWell... Little by little I'm beginning to see the entire truth behind this case.\nRay:\nOh. That's good to hear! Uncle had better not fall behind, either!\n\n\n\nAbout the two cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis case seems to have a lot in common with the case 18 years ago.\nRay:\nI agree. The melted ice in the Winter Palace and the body of the victim from 18 years ago...\nKay:\nI wonder why nobody ever noticed the body was missing after all this time?\nRay:\n...The only family Mr. Dover had was a young son. His son... and Mr. Gustavia's son, who attended the same elementary school. After the case, they both went missing...\nKay:\nWhaaat!? And, they haven't been found yet?\nRay:\nI haven't heard any news about Mr. Gustavia's son being found... But as for Mr. Dover's son. he was found and his inheritance was delivered to him. And because of that, Mr. Dover never had a proper funeral. That way they were able to make it look like the body had been in police custody. The autopsy report had also been forged, so nobody but the defense ever found out...\nEdgeworth:\n(Von Karma... You would go that far...!)\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nI never would've imagined that you'd end up becoming a prosecutor.\nEdgeworth:\n.....I'm sorry.\nRay:\nNo no! I'm not blaming you. You have your own reasons behind it as well, right? But... Standing in the courtroom as a prosecutor isn't the same as doing it as a defense attorney. It's something I would like you to experience just one... As a defense attorney.\nEdgeworth:\n(There was actually a time when I stood in the courtroom as a defense attorney. It definitely... didn't feel bad at all.)\n\n\n\n\nIS-7 Incident File or Winter Palace Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nThe IS-7 Incident... It sure was a fateful case. At least it was for Uncle Ray.\nEdgeworth:\n...For me, as well.\nRay:\nI've been thinking a lot about the IS-7 Incident... Don't you think that it'd be better to abbreviate it as the \"ISs Incident\"?\nKay:\nOh, then what about the \"Sweet Incident\"? Or perhaps the \"Cold Case\"!\nRay:\nWhich one should we decide on? It's quite a dilemma, eh?\nEdgeworth:\n(Sometimes I don't know how seriously he takes things...)\n\n\n\n\nFluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nWe never did manage to find the fluorescent cloth that went missing 18 years ago. Isn't it weird for something that stands out like that to just disappear?\nEdgeworth:\nSo the question becomes, was it overlooked, or was it...\nRay:\nHidden... right? ...By someone.\n\n\n\n\nAngel's Recipe Book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nIt's called the Angel's Recipe because it contains the recipes for many miraculous medicines.\nEdgeworth:\nIs there any medicine in particular that you're interested in?\nRay:\nUncle Ray? Not really. How about Kay?\nKay:\nI'd love a medicine that made me genius, or turn invisible, or gave me the ability to fly!\nEdgeworth:\n...Aren't you expecting a little too much from a medicine?\n\n\n\n\nFrame Fingermarks or Rock Salt Lamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nOh, this one sure takes me back.\nEdgeworth:\nIf you've noticed anything strange about it, I'd like you to tell me.\nRay:\nI've been thinking about this case for the past 18 years. ...I don't think I'm going to conveniently notice something strange all of a sudden. But you might be able to, Miles.\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nKay:\nYou're talking all cool... But you pretty much have nothing to say, right?\nRay:\nEh heh he, did you notice?\nEdgeworth:\n(...It seems a lot has come to nothing.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nAh, Ah-hah, this, eh. This evidence holds the so-called key to the case, right?\nEdgeworth:\nErr... It's possible.\nRay:\nYup. Then, hold on to it closely. Hurry, hurry, put it away!\nEdgeworth:\n(...He doesn't think much about this.)\nTrolley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHm... This lift trolley has just been left here.\nKay:\nI wonder if it was used recently to carry something heavy.\n\n\n\nFirst time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe surface of the platform appears to be wet...\nRay:\nHmm. I remember seeing this lift trolley... someplace before.\nKay:\n! You mean during the IS-7 Incident?\nRay:\nAh, that's right! I remember now! It was in Dover's room. If I remember correctly, it was used to transport the ice sculptures! The lift trolley has a feature that allows you to adjust the height and angle of the platform. With just one of these, a single person could move the sculptures all by themselves.\nLift Trolley data jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay:\nWow! How convenient! I want one too!\nRay:\nWhy is there a lift trolley here... I guess that's something we'll need to think about.\nEdgeworth:\nYes... it could be related to the case.\nFountain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt appears the body has already been recovered by the police.\nKay:\nWhy was the body of the victim from 18 years ago found floating in the fountain? I mean, wouldn't the body have gone all goopy after 18 years?\nEdgeworth:\n(...I don't know if I would call it \"goopy\"...) It certainly would have required a special method to preserve the body.\nKay:\nYeah, I wonder if such a method even exists...? Hey, Mr. Forensics Guy! Any new information?\nForensics:\nYes! Normallium and Fatallium have been detected in the fountain water.\nKay:\nThey must have flowed through the stream from the Autumn Palace to the fountain.\nForensics:\nAside from the chemicals, we also found high levels of sugar. We're working hard on investigating it!\nEdgeworth:\n(Sugar in the fountain water...? What could have caused that?)\nOfficer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficer:\nP-Prosecutor Debeste ordered me not to let you investigate anything but this room. I absolutely cannot let you pass through any further than this! I'm sorry!\nEdgeworth:\nI won't, since I can't pass through anyway. You're standing in front of a wall.\nOfficer:\nNo! After all, you're Prosecutor Edgeworth! If you really wanted to, this wall wouldn't stop you.\nKay:\nWow! You are even more fearsome than I thought, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Just what kind of human do these people think I am...?)\nTrophies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nOn the shelf are trophies commemorating Isaac Dover's work as Pierre Hoquet. He truly was a first-rate artist. There are quite a number trophies lined up here.\nKay:\nI remember you have some trophies too, Mr. Edgeworth. I would love to have some too. If only there were a contest for thieves. How about it, Mr. Edgeworth? We could hold one at the Prosecutor's Office!\nEdgeworth:\n...I don't mind you holding a contest, but all the participants would be arrested.\nElevator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like this elevator is for authorized personnel only.\nKay:\nWhat do you think is on the second floor?\nEdgeworth:\nI heard it's the infirmary. Mr. Gustavia should be there right now, receiving medical treatment...\nKay:\nI sure hope he's okay. We still need to talk with him once he regains consciousness.\nEdgeworth:\nThere's nothing we can do until he recovers. For now, we should find something else to do.\nForensics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForensics:\nWe've recovered the victim's body. Forensics are currently performing the autopsy.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what of the investigation of the fountain?\nForensics:\nThe fountain is completely clear. You could cleanse both your heart and soul with it.\nEdgeworth:\n(A body was floating in this fountain just a moment ago, though...)\nDelicia Scones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicia:\nOi! How's the investigation coming along? Have you found anything?\nKay:\nHoi! Not quite, actually... We haven't found any clues yet.\nDelicia:\nYou're doing wrong! \"Hoi\" is only used when you're showing someone something! Also, \"Yessie\" is used to confirm and is also a greeting. \"Eep\" is used when you're afraid. \"Fie\" is used when you don't like something. \"Oi\" is used when you're calling someone.\nKay:\nHmhm. I see. I didn't know it was that deep. Oi oi, Mr. Edgeworth! Did you catch all of that?\nEdgeworth:\n...Kay. Be more serious.\nKay:\nYessie...\nWinter Palace door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThere is a maple tree in front of this door.\nEdgeworth:\nBut, that door leads to the \"Winter Palace.\" Maple trees are autumn trees, so this must have been placed here as a red herring.\nKay:\nWell then, how about we freeze it to make it look like a maple tree in the winter?\nEdgeworth:\nPlease don't complicate matters any further...\nStatues on right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nIt's a statue of a brave warrior fighting a snake. Was this also made by Pierre Hoquet?\nEdgeworth:\nIt appears to be one of his early works, when he was enamored with fantasy and myths. The statue represents his heroic resolution to oppose hopeless difficulties in his youth. The title is... \"The Math Test\".\nKay:\n...I know that feeling all too well.\nSebastian Debeste\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Debeste, you're getting a bit in my way if you stand here.\nDebeste:\nHmph. I am not going to move! Just do what you can over there!\nKay:\nDon't say that. It's probably the best if you just stand over there.\nDebeste:\n\"The Best,\" you say? OK, I'll go stand over there!\nEdgeworth:\n(So anything is fine as long as you add \"The Best\" to it?)\nJustine Courtney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney:\nI feel that your conduct thus far has clearly been out of line. I will make sure to bring this matter up to the P.I.C.\nEdgeworth:\n...Do whatever you want.\nKay:\nBut in return, we're going to be doing whatever we want as well!\nCourtney:\nIf I remember correctly, you're the little Ms. Great Thief... I will have to report your misconduct to the P.I.C. as well, young lady.\nKay:\nSure. Since it will only serve to increase my fame as the Great Thief!\nCourtney:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems even Judge Courtney is unable to get a handle on Kay...)\nAutumn Palace door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThere is a fir tree in front of this door.\nEdgeworth:\nBut, that door leads to the \"Autumn Palace.\" Fir trees are winter trees, so this must have been placed here as a red herring.\nKay:\nWell then, why don't we paint it an autumn red!\nEdgeworth:\n...Kay, fir trees are green all year around.\nKay:\n! ...I-I knew that.\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue cloth of Fluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA blue cloth... I guess this kind of relaxing color is nice once in awhile.\nKay:\nAfter all, when you're sneaking around, it's better not to have a color that stands out! But, when you want to make a cool entrance, flashy colors are better... It's a hard choice.\nEdgeworth:\n...Couldn't you fulfill both those conditions with this cloth?\nKay:\n! You're right! This cloth... is awesome.\n\n\n\n\nFront side of Pottery Shard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nHuh? I feel like I've seen this design somewhere before...?\nEdgeworth:\n...Isn't it Pierre Hoquet's, the sculptor, signature?\nKay:\nI wonder why this was dropped in a puddle of tea?\nEdgeworth:\n(Why do I get the feeling I know who's behind this?)\n\n\n\n\nBack side of Pottery Shard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nIt's completely broken.\nEdgeworth:\nYes. I suspect it will be hard to tell where this piece originally came from.\nKay:\nIf only there were some kind of distinctive mark on it...\n\n\n\n\nPlatform of Lift Trolley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis lift is wet...\nKay:\nMaybe it was carrying something that was wet?\nEdgeworth:\n(Did someone move something with this...?)\nKay:\nI wonder why this was dropped in a puddle of tea?\nEdgeworth:\n(Why do I get the feeling I know who's behind this?)\nEdgeworth:\nSo, this tea set was made by Isaac Dover...\nKay:\nFancy stuff, huh.\nEdgeworth:\nKay, I'd say this tea set is worth thousands of dollars. Please be careful with it.\nKay:\nEh...! This tea set is such a treasure!?\nEdgeworth:\n...Please don't look so excited. (If I recall correctly, Ms. Hall was a huge fan of Mr. Dover...)\nTeapot data jotted down in my Organizer.\nLarry:\nHey! Edgeeey!\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVessel of Jeff's Teapot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nWow! This teapot sure looks fashionable!\nEdgeworth:\nFashionable...? I'd say it borders along the lines of eccentric.\nKay:\nIf you don't appreciate the design, you're not qualified to be a Great Thief!\nEdgeworth:\n...I wouldn't mind being unqualified.\n\n\n\n\nBottom side of Jeff's Teapot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nLook, there's a mark engraved on the bottom... It says \"PH\"?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's because this teapot was created by the sculptor, Pierre Hoquet. As the creator, he would engrave his initials onto his works.\nKay:\nAh, but... wasn't his real name \"Isaac Dover\"?\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. Apparently, the victim of the IS-7 Incident created this piece. (Though I'm left to wonder... Are all these works in the Zodiac Art Gallery his creations?)\nEdgeworth:\n...What is it?\nLarry:\nBe careful with that teapot!\nEdgeworth:\n(Why must I be warned by him of all people...?)\nKate:\n...Madame and Messieurs. Would you care for some tea?\nEdgeworth:\n! ...Ms. Hall.\nLarry:\nAah...! K-Katie...! N-No... I'm fine, thanks. Kay and Edgey, you guys can have some!\nEdgeworth:\n...? Well... Since you asked, we might as well take a short break.\nKate:\nCertainly.\nKay:\nThanks for the tea! Wow! It's so tasty! ...What kind of tea is this, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's Ceylon tea. Known for its citrus aroma. However... Ms. Hall, is this the same tea you served us this morning?\nKate:\nYes, that's right... Was it not to your liking?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, it's not that... The tea we had this morning had a slightly different aroma (Different tea aroma - Smells different from the tea we had this morning. Did something change?).\nKate:\n...? How strange. It is the same Ceylon tea I served this morning. There shouldn't be anything different about it...\nLarry:\nWh-What's wrong with you, Edgey! Quit nitpicking about the tea Katie so kindly prepared for you!\nEdgeworth:\nLarry... What are you getting so upset about?\nLarry:\nI-I'm not upset! You're just being a rude jerk! And I told you to call me Laurice! Sheesh! I'm not gonna talk to you anymore!\nEdgeworth:\n(...It's like arguing with a child...)\nKay:\nLaurice... I wonder what's wrong?\nEdgeworth:\nI'd like to ask him that later myself. (And... I also need to speak with Ms. Hall. I don't have any evidence that shows she is the culprit, but... ...I dare say she is the one who set up the poison gas trap.)\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Different tea aroma\" and \"Pots were switched\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMaybe the reason why the Ceylon tea smelled different was because the pots had been switched.\nKay:\nEh? Really?\nEdgeworth:\nThe taste of the tea itself did not actually change after all. ...Let's go ask Ms. Hall about it in more detail. Ms. Hall. Was the reason why the Ceylon tea smelled different because the pots were switched?\nKate:\nYes..... That's certainly possible.\nEdgeworth:\n...It had a fresh minty aroma, not unlike that of Uva tea.\nKate:\nAh! I remember now. I prepared some mint tea yesterday. I'm sure that the aroma just happened to remain in the teapot. (Pot with a different aroma - The tea has a minty aroma because a different teapot was used.)\nEdgeworth:\n(...Is that really all there is to it?)\n\n\n\n\n\"Pot with a different aroma\" and \"Minty aroma\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA minty aroma was emanating from the pot Larry had replaced.\nKay:\nMs. Hall said the aroma was left over from the mint tea she prepared yesterday.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. ...She seemed less surprised to find out that Larry broke the teapot... And more surprised by the fact that the pots had been switched.\nKay:\nThat's right... Normally, it would have been the reverse. A broken teapot is much more shocking!\nEdgeworth:\nShe was probably trying to hide this teapot.\nKay:\nHide the pot...?\nEdgeworth:\nOne of the characteristics of Normallium is a minty aroma. There is a possibility that she was hiding Normallium inside this teapot.\nKay:\nWhaaaaaat! I-Inside the pot!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt is only a possibility for now, but it's one worth investigating. Mr. Debeste, I assume you haven't found the Normallium yet?\nDebeste:\nHuh? O... Oh! I've had the entire art museum searched, but I haven't received any reports yet. And what about you. Don't you have any ideas?\nEdgeworth:\n...Only one.\nDebeste:\nI knew it. Nobody but me would be able to find it... Wait, what? You have an idea where it is!?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed.\nDebeste:\nTh... Then tell me!\nEdgeworth:\n...It may have been in this teapot that Ms. Hall had used.\nDebeste:\nOoh? This teapot is pretty nice! It would make the perfect present for The Best Prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's not a present! It's an important piece of evidence!\nDebeste:\nOh, it's just evidence. Then I guess I'll have forensics take a look at it.\nKate:\nMonsieur Edgeworth... Is there something wrong with the teapot I used?\nEdgeworth:\nThis teapot has a minty aroma to it. It's the same aroma as one of the two chemicals used to create the poison gas.\nKate:\nMonsieur Edgeworth, surely you don't mean... ...you suspect me of having set off the poison gas?\nEdgeworth:\n.....I do. Setting up the poison gas trap in the Autumn Palace would have required some preparation. As the curator of this museum, you're the only one who could have prepared it in advance.\nKate:\n...I wonder about that. Preparations for the opening of the museum took about a week... And I received help from both outsiders and Madame Delicia. I think there are people besides me, who are also suspicious.\nEdgeworth:\nOf course, Delicia is also under scrutiny.\nKate:\nFurthermore... I don't even know how to create something like poison gas. Even if you found Normallium in my teapot... ...there is no way I could have prepared the poison gas.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nKate:\nWell then... I look forward to hearing the analysis results of the teapot.\nEdgeworth:\n(Her excuse is that she doesn't know how to prepare the poison gas. I must find a way to shatter that excuse...)\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nYeah, what's up?\n\n\n\nNotice anything? (after connecting aroma logic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nIf Normallium is found in the teapot, will Ms. Hall be arrested? I don't think someone who seems so gentle could ever be the true murderer...\nEdgeworth:\nIt isn't good to judge people by their outward appearance, Kay. (Although, it's true that it would be an upsetting conclusion. I should try asking Mr. Shields and Delicia for their opinions as well...)\n\n\n\n\nSketching beauties (after talking about \"Sketching beauties\" from Larry)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nMs. Hall and Ms. Courtney... They certainly are beauties. But, look here! Little Miss Kay is not gonna lose either!\nEdgeworth:\n...Ah, a \"girl's sketchbook,\" I see.\nKay:\nPlease don't steal the \"beautiful\" part! It's a \"beautiful girl's sketchbook!\"\nEdgeworth:\nDon't get caught up in all of this...\nKay:\nAm I really that ugly...?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not it. What you shouldn't get caught up in is this whole beauty sketch affair. I vaguely feel that something is off about this sketch... What could it be? (It seems like the sketch contradicts something in the crime scene...)\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSketch of Beauties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nLaurice's sketch sure looks pretty.\nEdgeworth:\nHe's surprisingly good with his hands, though the same can't be said about his brain.\nKay:\nIf he got a proper model, he might even be able to create a normal painting!\nEdgeworth:\n(That's right... Larry just draws whatever he sees in front of him. In other words... ...if there's a discrepancy with the truth in this sketch, there should be a reason for it.) The \"contradiction\" that appears in the sketch... I just can't ignore it.\n\n\n\n\nChocolates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nActually, I really love sweets! Thank you!\nEdgeworth:\nW-Wait!\nKay:\nBut you just came up to me and held it out right in front of me.\nEdgeworth:\nI just wanted to ask you if you have noticed anything about these chocolates.\nKay:\n...I've noticed that they're sweet and absolutely delicious. They've stolen my heart... I wants it... My precious! Give me chocolate!\nEdgeworth:\nC-Calm down!\nKay:\nPlease put it away quickly! My hand is about to steal it on its own!\nEdgeworth:\nS-Sure. (This stuff seems to be more dangerous than I thought.)\nTea cart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore obtaining Sketch of Beauties or after deducing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nTea set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe teapot is shaped like the moon, while the tea cups are shaped like stars. We had Ceylon tea with this tea set just now, but... For some reason, I thought it smelled different from the one we had this morning. (There must be some reason behind this strange feeling...)\n\n\n\n\nDeduce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)\n\n\n\nDeduce tablecloth and present Sketch of Beauties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Larry... There's something I want to ask you about your sketch.\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis spot contradicts the evidence!\nKay:\nReally? I don't see it. Why don't you relax and have another cup of tea. That'll help you get it together.\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmm. Upon relaxing and reflecting, it seems I was mistaken. (Ms. Hall was using this white service cart... However... why do I feel like something is amiss. I should look over my evidence again.)\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry... There's something I want to ask you about your sketch.\nLarry:\nHuh? You want a lecture on sketching from the famed Professor Laurice, do ya?\nEdgeworth:\nNo... I just need to ask you something. The tablecloth in your sketch, are you sure it was light blue?\nLarry:\nYeah, my eyes never fail me!\nEdgeworth:\nBut, the one on the service cart here is white, isn't it?\nLarry:\n.........Dude. You're always so busy thinking with just your head, that you miss the obvious.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What's with that look on your face!\nLarry:\nWhen I drew that painting... I was using the cart with the tea set on it, remember? Because I was tidying up the broken pottery shards!\nEdgeworth:\n...That's not something to be proud of!\nLarry:\nAnd right then, Katie came out of the Winter Palace. I had to hurry and hide the broken teapot, so that she wouldn't notice it.\nEdgeworth:\nDid you just say... Ms. Hall came out of the Winter Palace?\nLarry:\nThat's right. But this time, she was pushing another service cart. And the tablecloth was light blue, just like how I drew it.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat did she do with that service cart?\nLarry:\nBeats me. She went into the Summer Palace with it, so I don't know. And when she came out, she was pushing the lift trolley.\nEdgeworth:\nThe lift trolley...?\nLarry:\nWhen I called out to her, she was so surprised that she just left it there. ...She's so cute when she's shy!\nEdgeworth:\nA second service cart... and a lift trolley...\nKay:\nMaybe there were two tea sets along with two service carts.\nEdgeworth:\n...We'll have to verify it with Ms. Hall.\nRaymond Shields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChocolates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nOh. It's Katie's chocolates! Uncle Ray really loves how sweet they are. He he he. The sweet flavor really goes well with the bitter coffee in the office.\nEdgeworth:\nI see. Coffee would indeed go well with this.\nRay:\nMr. Master said that these were his favorites... I just wish I could paint over the bitter memories of that case with this sweet chocolate.\nKatherine Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Hall, where have you been until now?\nKate:\nI was showing the remaining guests out and handing out complimentary gifts as an apology. Did you require my services?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... There are a few things I want to ask you about. (If my suspicions are correct... She's the one who set up the poison gas trap...!)\n\n\n\nTwo service carts (after deducing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIs it true you keep two service carts on the premises?\nKate:\nY-Yes. Is there something wrong?\nEdgeworth:\nEarlier I was looking at one of the sketches from that so-called \"artist\" and... I noticed that he had drawn the cart's tablecloth light blue.\nKate:\nLight blue...? Are you sure you weren't mistaken, Monsieur? I only ever use tablecloths that are pure white.\nKay:\nThat's true. The tablecloth here doesn't have a single spot on it!\nKate:\nYes. That's because I always change them immediately whenever they get dirty.\nEdgeworth:\n(Did Larry really get the color wrong then?) ...What were you doing when this sketch was drawn?\nKate:\nAt that time... I was just doing my job as usual.\nEdgeworth:\nThen, could you tell me exactly what that work entails?\n\n\n\n\nKate's job (appears after Two service carts)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat were you doing when you were drawn in this sketch? From the looks of the drawing... it doesn't seem like you were transporting the tea set.\nKate:\nThis was when I was delivering chocolates to all the people in the investigation.\nKay:\nAha, how nice. Chocolates! I wish I could've got some too!\nKate:\nThere are still a few left, so please eat these, then. I made them myself, though it's possible they might not suit your taste...\nKay:\nWoohoo! Eheheh. Thank you so much!\nEdgeworth:\nHm... Thank you. (...Perhaps it's because she had them in her pocket, but it looks like they've melted a bit.)\nChocolates data jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay:\nMmm! The sweet goodness!\nKate:\n*giggle* ...I'm happy to hear you say that.\nEdgeworth:\n(These chocolates are a little misshapen, but I'm glad to get some sugar into my system. ...Although they're a little too sweet for my taste.)\n\n\n\n\nThe poison gas trap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHow exactly did you prepare the melted sculptures from 18 years ago?\nKate:\nMy! So you know about what happened 18 years ago? It's because 18 years ago, I photographed Monsieur Dover's sculptures. Using the photos as a base, I managed to create replicas.\nEdgeworth:\n...Replicas?\nKate:\nThe Zodiac Sculptures had been an unfinished work, so I wanted to complete it somehow. Because I am the one who accidentally melted Monsieur Dover's sculptures...\nEdgeworth:\n...And could you tell me why the Autumn Palace resembles the Winter Palace so much?\nKate:\nWell...! My apologies. Did they really look so alike? I think I may have gotten some of the decorations mixed up.\nEdgeworth:\n(She is obviously lying. But, I haven't gathered any evidence to prove that yet...)\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKate:\nFor Monsieur Edgeworth's son to have become a prosecutor... I'm sure there must have been some awful circumstances to it.\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes. A lot has happened, although I cannot talk about the details right now...\nKate:\nHa ha. Monsieur Edgeworth, you really take after your father. Even if your profession is different, I'm sure you are as excellent as he was.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's what I aspire to be, but... (My father would always face his work with unwavering conviction. Even now... I am still lost regarding the question of what my path should be...)\n\n\n\n\nArt Gallery Pamphlet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is a great actress like you doing as a curator of an art gallery?\nKate:\n...Deep down, I don't think there is much of a difference. Films, musicals, sweets, singing, sculptures... It's all the same. At the end of the day, all artists are striving for the same goal. To move the human heart.\nKay:\nIs Laurice striving for that too?\nEdgeworth:\n...Of course not. He's not an artist. He's Larry.\n\n\n\n\nFluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKate:\nThat's a special fluorescent cloth I received from Madame Delicia.\nEdgeworth:\nCould you tell me how many cloths she gave you?\nKate:\n...There were... four.\nEdgeworth:\n(The Autumn Palace also had four fluorescent cloths... But, I feel like I saw one more. It seems she is hiding something...)\n\n\n\n\nAngel's Recipe Book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat kind of methods for medicine preparation are described in the Angel's Recipe?\nKate:\nIt contains many ways of preparation, so I can't explain them all in such a short time. Although if you really want to know I can tell you! It will take about 2 hours, though! I can tell you every one of them while maatching the meeloodyy! ♬ Let's staart my explanatiooon! ♪\nKay:\nWhat should we do? Listen to all of it?\nEdgeworth:\nN-No... That won't be necessary.\n\n\n\n\nLift Trolley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nApparently, this lift trolley was here 18 years ago...\nKate:\nYes. It has allowed me to move various things from other rooms into this one. It was intended to carry heavy objects, but it has been quite useful for all sorts of things.\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm curious as to why the top of the lift trolley was wet when we examined it. That lift trolley... I wonder if it was used to move something that made it wet?)\n\n\n\n\nSketch of Beauties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKate:\nMy...! Is this... me?\nEdgeworth:\nYes.

Are you giving it to me as a commemoration gift?\nEdgeworth:\nN-No. For the time being, this is a valuable piece of evidence.\nKate:\nI see...

It's dangerous, so I'll tidy up the broken pieces. Allow me to take this piece from you as well.\nEdgeworth:\n...Wasn't this tea set one of Isaac Dover's works? I heard that it was very important to you...\nKate:\nYes... But... there's no use crying over spilled tea.

That other teapot you were talking about, is it the one on that cart?\nKate:\nYes...?\nLarry:\nTruth is, when I was trying to hide the broken shards, I looked under that cart.

Everything's cool now! I took great care to make sure no one would break that pot!\nEdgeworth:\nYou... Don't brag about that when you were the one who broke it in the first place!\nLarry:\nUuuh...

Ah, but just to be clear, the \"beauties\" only refers to Justy and Katie. That other plump lady has nothing to do with that!\nKay:\nThen why did you draw her on the same page?\nLarry:\nWell, I was taking a break from my still life painting when those beauties caught my eye. I guess I just drew them on the same page without thinking.\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you're saying that the pictures on this page were each drawn separately?\nLarry:\nHuh? Oh, yeah. I may have drawn them at different times. By the way, there's a drawing of the beautiful Little Miss Kay on another page.\nKay:\nWow! Beautiful, huh! Eheheh, thanks!\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, you drew this exactly as you saw it, correct?\nLarry:\nWell, yeah! Even I can't draw what I can't see!

I-I suppose so.\nLarry:\nIt's not your job that matters. It's what you do that counts! Look at me, for example. I'm constantly changing jobs, yet have I changed as a person?\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmph. You're certainly still as annoying as always.\nLarry:\nYou haven't changed either. You're always complaining about me!!\n\n\n\n\nPisces Sketch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarry:\nWhoa... That is one scary sketch!\nEdgeworth:\nYou're the one who drew it! The scene you sketched here, you're sure you didn't mistake what you saw, right?\nLarry:\nOf course not. It was a shocking sight, so I remember it well. I drew it exactly like I saw it. I really am a genius!\nEdgeworth:\n...You certainly are a genius. At causing trouble.\n\n\n\n\nPottery Shard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, take a look at this.\nLarry:\n.....Ugh. Wh-What's that?\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, I've got a feeling that what you're hiding is related to the tea and this pottery shard.\nLarry:\nUuuh... uuuuhh.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, if you're not going to talk to me, I can always hand this shard over to Judge Courtney.\nLarry:\nWait! I'm trying to keep a clean image for Justy! I don't want her to see how I've dirtieeed myseeeeelf!\nEdgeworth:\nI can't imagine what part of you can be considered \"clean,\" but... ...If you don't want her to declare you guilty, I suggest you speak truthfully now.\nLarry:\nI... I got it! I'll tell you!\n\n\n\n\nSketch of Beauties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarry:\nAhhh, they're just so beautiful! Katie and Justy!\nKay:\nSo, which one's your type, Laurice?\nLarry:\nWell, both of them are my type! Ah, and of course you too, Kay!\nEdgeworth:\n...So, anyone's your type as long as they're female?\nLarry:\nIt's not like that at all! Even I have standards! Like that pink lady I drew in my sketch, she's way too old for me!\nEdgeworth:\n(This man... He could tell Delicia's age with just a single look!?)\n\n\n\n\nChocolates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarry:\nEarlier, Katie gave me some chocolate. Her hot gaze was enough to melt the chocolate... I can tell she's totally fallen for me!\nEdgeworth:\n...If you're talking about the chocolate, Kay and I got some too, you know?\nLarry:\nWh-Wh-Whaaaaat!? That's so unfair, Edgey! Dammit! I'll just die now! I'm gonna drop dead on Valentine's Day, cursing all the couples in the world!\nKay:\nI-Is it fine if we just leave him like this?\nEdgeworth:\nIn time, melted chocolate cools down and hardens once more... When Valentine's Day comes, I'm sure this man's head will have cooled down as well.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarry:\n...Hmm... Aha! Here's the title of my next picture book! \"Justy's Gaveling Gavel Gala.\" I'm sure the sales will rival even \"Franzy's Whippity Whip Trip\"!\nEdgeworth:\nLarry! Would you just look at this evidence for a second!\nLarry:\nHuh? What'd you want?\nEdgeworth:\nAm I invisible to him or something?\n(Connecting all possible Logic and examining fountain leads to:)\nEdgeworth:\n...This is Edgeworth.\nGumshoe:\nIt's Gumshoe, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nDid something happen?\nGumshoe:\nActually, right now all the investigators but me have left the Winter Palace. So I can finally tell you what we've found!\nEdgeworth:\n(It's not good for a detective to be leaking out information about the investigation, but... ...his resourcefulness has saved me many times these past few days.)\nGumshoe:\nAll of the sculptures in the Winter Palace have melted. There's still some liquid left in the cases, but... ...there's less in the Gemini case than in the Taurus case.\nEdgeworth:\n! There's still liquid in the glass cases?\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir! We just investigated the light blue liquid a moment ago. We only detected sugar in the Taurus case, but... ...for some reason, in the Gemini case, we detected three different substances.\nEdgeworth:\nThree substances...?\nGumshoe:\nThey, consisted of... sugar, salt and blood!\nEdgeworth:\n! ...Blood? (...Blood and salt were detected in the Gemini case?)\nGumshoe:\nI wonder whose blood it could have been? I've asked forensics to look into it, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nRight. I leave it to you, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nThat reminds me, the forensics investigating the Fountain Patio contacted me... It seems the sugar found in the fountain matches that found in the light blue liquid.\nEdgeworth:\nOh...? That sounds like valuable information.\nLiquid Analysis Results jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\n...Is that all the new information you have for me?\nGumshoe:\nAh, now that you mention it, we found a Rainbow Light Device in there too!\nEdgeworth:\nThe device was used to disguise the Autumn Palace... (It seems the device that was used in the IS-7 Incident is also connected to this one. I should listen to what Delicia has to say about that.)\nGumshoe:\nI have to go back to investigating now, sir! When we get the results of the blood tests, I'll let you know right away!\nEdgeworth:\nYes... Thank you, Detective.\nKay:\nWas that Gummy calling? That sure was a long call.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... But, thanks to him, we now have an important piece of information.\nKay:\n?\nEdgeworth:\n(In order to break Ms. Hall's alibi... ...I'll need to talk to everyone involved in the IS-7 Incident.)\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What Kate did\" and \"Contained in the book\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe method used to set off the poison gas is explained in the Angel's Recipe. And, the current owner of the Angel's Recipe is Ms. Hall.\nKay:\nAh! So, that means...!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. It means that it is possible she knew how to set off the poison gas. With this... We can expose her lies for what they are!\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nYeah, what's up?\n\n\n\nThe investigation (after clearing all talk options for both Raymond Shields and Delicia Scones)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nWe've sure found out a lot about both this case and the IS-7 Incident as well.\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder about that. The truth still seems to be wrapped in a deep, thick mist.\nKay:\nDon't we have what we need to clear up that mist? Because if we don't, I can take Little Thief out for another spin!\nEdgeworth:\n...No, it's fine. We've already gathered all the information we need. If I just use logic and match up all the pieces, the mist should clear and we will see the truth.\nKay:\nI understand. Well then, do your thing!\nRaymond Shields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatherine Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Shields. Could you tell me what kind of person Ms. Hall is?\nRay:\nHm? Miles... Don't tell me... You're also interested in Katie?\nEdgeworth:\n...No.\nRay:\nWell, all joking aside... All Uncle Ray can say is... the Kate I know is a truly admirable woman. For 18 years, she has always wanted to remain here, and wait for Master's return. However, she was driven out of the mansion by Master's relatives.\nKay:\nWhaaa! She... was driven out of the mansion?\nRay:\nThat's because Kate... isn't related by blood to Mr. Master. With no family, and her job taken from her... She could only live on with the song and dance that Mr. Master had taught her. Well, she's now retired as a world famous actress, though.\nEdgeworth:\nWhy did she retire...?\nRay:\n...Because she had already saved up enough money to buy this mansion. It seems she even got back the Angel's Recipe (What Kate did - Kate got back the mansion and the Angel's Recipe for Mr. Master's sake.) that had been taken by the Master Group. This mansion, where she lived with Mr. Master had been everything to her... She probably just wanted to... take back everything that she lost.\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems that Mr. Shields sympathizes with Ms. Hall... But you could also say that her actions have taken away everything Mr. Master had.)\nDelicia Scones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDelicia. Would you be willing to aid in the investigation?\nDelicia:\nYessie! Of course! Anything for Miley and Kay Fay. I listen to whatever you have to say!\nEdgeworth:\n...I was wondering if you could stop calling me \"Miley\".\nKay:\nAnd stop calling me \"Kay Fay\"!\nDelicia:\nFie! That's out of question! I can't just change a name I've already decided on!\nKay:\nUuh... Even if we ask her, she won't listen to what we have to say at all!\n\n\n\nThe decorations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know anything about the decorations that are used in this museum? ...Specifically, the fluorescent cloths and a special device called a rainbow light device.\nDelicia:\nYessie! Of course I do! Because they are presents that I gave to Katie. As an apology for breaking the rules 18 years ago... I gave her four new rock salt lamps and the four fluorescent cloths I used in the contest.\nKay:\nWow! That sounds nice. Fluorescent cloths and rock salt lamps!\nDelicia:\nHa ha ha! Seems like only us girls can understand how wonderful they are!\nRay:\nThat's a cruel thing to say, Ms. Delicious. I liked them too, you know?\nDelicia:\nFie! That was back when Ray Ray was still a cute little boy!\nKay:\nB-Back when Mr. Shields was a cute little boy? Hmm... I can't even imagine it.\nEdgeworth:\nAre they the same decorations you saw 18 years ago?\nRay:\nProbably. The rock salt lamp, the cloth and the rainbow light device... They all seem the same.\nEdgeworth:\n(Four fluorescent cloths were used in the Autumn Palace... But I have the feeling I saw one more of the same cloth.)\n\n\nDelicia:\nIt's true! Look, I've got the proof right here in my bag...!\nEdgeworth:\n(...What is she searching for?)\nDelicia:\nNot this... Not this either...!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Hm? I remember seeing cloth like that recently...)\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Let's show Delicia and have her confirm my suspicions.)\n\n\n\n\nSetting off poison gas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI'd like to ask you something, since you're a pharmacist... Exactly how would one gain the knowledge required to set off poison gas?\nDelicia:\nOh, that's basic knowledge for any pharmacist acquainted with Megatoxin X! It even says on the warning label, \"Danger: Do not mix with Normallium.\"\nEdgeworth:\nThen... is there another way for someone who isn't a pharmacist to obtain that information?\nDelicia:\nHmm. Well... It might be possible if they've seen the Angel's Recipe!\nEdgeworth:\n(The recipe book that was the grand prize of the contest, 18 years ago...)\nDelicia:\nSince it also contains the recipe (Contained in the book - The Angel's Recipe also contains the method to prepare the poison gas.) to prepare Megatoxin X.\nEdgeworth:\nDoes this mean that you've also seen the contents of the Angel's Recipe?\nDelicia:\nYessie! That's a given, of course. The pharmaceutical company I work for is the Master Group. It's the company that makes the Coldkiller X medicine!\nEdgeworth:\n(Coldkiller X... The cold medicine that promises to kill colds good.)\nDelicia:\nAfter Jeffy got declared guilty, the company took back the recipe book. However, only a small group of elite pharmacists have been allowed to see it, though.\nEdgeworth:\n(So this woman is also a part of that small group of elite pharmacists...)\n\n\n\n\nFluorescent cloth (after presenting Fluorescent cloth after The decorations)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nPlease tell me the reason why you hid this cloth.\nDelicia:\nOooh... I guess I have no choice, since the cat's out of the bag... I found this cloth floating in the fountain. And right after that, I was called to the Autumn Palace.\nEdgeworth:\n(So that's the moment Larry captured in his so-called sketch of beauties...)\nDelicia:\nAt first, I thought one of the fluorescent cloths I'd given Katie had washed away.\nEdgeworth:\nBut didn't you only give four fluorescent cloths as a present to this museum?\nDelicia:\n...There were four fluorescent cloths covering the sculptures in the Autumn Palace, right? So, that's when I realized... ...that this was the cloth that went missing 18 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nDelicia:\nThe poison gas broke out because someone had stolen my Megatoxin X. ...So I thought the fluorescent cloth had also been used for the crime. I was afraid I'd be suspected, so I didn't say anything about it to anyone...\nEdgeworth:\n...I see.\nDelicia:\nBut, I sure feel a lot better after talking about it. Stress isn't good for your figure, after all.\nEdgeworth:\n(18 years ago, the cloth that was wrapped around the body went missing... Who would have thought it would turn up in the fountain along with the body...)\nFluorescent Cloth data updated in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicia:\nOh? Didn't Greggy have a different badge?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, my father was a defense attorney. And I... chose a different path than my father.\nDelicia:\nAhh... I see! So that's how it is. It can't be helped, eh? Since you're at that age. But, when you get a bit bigger, I'm sure you'll understand that your father loved you!\nEdgeworth:\n.....?\nDelicia:\nBecause everyone goes through the rebellious phase. There's no reason to be ashamed about it!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...! I didn't become a prosecutor because I was in a rebellious phase!\n\n\n\n\nFluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicia:\nThe cloth is made from some pretty expensive materials. It's hard to come by, you know!\nKay:\nThe technology is amazing! How is it made?\nDelicia:\nYessie! If you're interested, I'll share my secret information with you!\nKay:\nHmhm. So it was developed by Blue Screens Inc., huh... I've gotta steal that tech! I'll aim to be the shining star in the world of thieves.\nEdgeworth:\nCould you please let me talk to her as well...?\n\n\n\n\nFluorescent Cloth (after talking about The decorations)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWasn't there a dirty rag in your bag that looked simillar to this?\nDelicia:\nFie! I'm not going to give any information to someone who calls it a dirty rag!\nEdgeworth:\nThen... Would it be better if I called it a wash cloth?\nDelicia:\nFie! Wrong again! It's a fluorescent cloth! Ah, Oopsie! That was supposed to be a secret...!\nEdgeworth:\n...Please tell me all you know about this fluorescent cloth.\n\n\n\n\nPoison Gas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicia:\nIt's true. I know how to make the poison gas. But, even if you know how to fire a gun, it doesn't mean you actually shot one, right?\nEdgeworth:\n...I haven't actually decided that you're the criminal yet though.\nKay:\nI may be a Great Thief, but that doesn't mean I would commit evil deeds!\nDelicia:\nAnd I may be a pastry chef, but that doesn't mean I can make desserts!\nEdgeworth:\n(That's because you're a fake pastry chef...!)\n\n\n\n\nAngel's Recipe Book\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou've also read the Angel's Recipe, right?\nDelicia:\nOf course! I may look like this, but I'm an ace pharmacist!\nKay:\nThat's amazing! An ace pharmacist. That's been my long-felt dream!\nDelicia:\nThat's right, that's right! At least Kay Fay understands!\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the first I've heard about her being interested in pharmacology, though...\nKay:\nShhh! A little flattery can go a long way when you're stealing or trying to get information. Well, then, Ms. Delicious! There's something I would like to ask of you!\nDelicia:\nFie! No can do! I can't just change names I've already decided on!\nKay:\n! For a Great Thief of all people to have their thoughts stolen like this!\nEdgeworth:\n...Looks like it didn't get you very far.\n\n\n\n\nRock Salt Lamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nI'm surprised that you can make a lamp out of rock salt.\nDelicia:\nYessie! It's weak against water, but it's strong against fire! It's pretty sturdy, you know? ...So sturdy it can be used as a murder weapon.\nKay:\nY-Yes, that's right, isn't it...\nEdgeworth:\n(The reason the rock salt lamp was broken was because it was used as the murder weapon. But then, I wonder why the other rock salt lamp was also broken...)\n\n\n\n\nSketch of Beauties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicia:\nThis sketch... Is this the one called the \"sketch of beauties\"?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's what the one who drew it called it. (Although it seems you were excluded from it.)\nDelicia:\nWas that boy perhaps Laurice? I'd love to chat with him one on one later!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... It would be my pleasure to introduce you.\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth... You're making an awfully evil face right now!\n\n\n\n\nChocolates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicia:\nYessie! That's Katie's chocolates, right? They... seem to have melted a bit, though. Not eating them when they look their best is rude to the chocolate, Miley!\nEdgeworth:\nNo... They had already melted when I got them.\nKay:\nMaybe Miley's hands got hotter when he received sweets from a sweetie!\nEdgeworth:\nKay...! I beg of you, please don't steal her manner of speech.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelicia:\nOi! That thing you've got there is rather cute, Miley. But, the color is rather unappealing. Now, if I were to coat it with fresh cream...\nEdgeworth:\nS-Stop it!\n(Connecting all possible Logic, examining trolley, clearing \"Kate's job\" of Kate and all \"Talk\" options of Delicia and Ray leads to:)\nInvestigation Complete\nEdgeworth:\n(Now, all that's left is to wait for the results of the teapot...!)\nTo be continued.\nApril 2, 2:33 PMZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio\nForensics:\nI have a report! We have detected traces of Normallium from the teapot!\nDebeste:\nY... You can't be serious...!\nKay:\nIt's just like Mr. Edgeworth said!\nDebeste:\nDarn it! Did Mr. Edgeworth take the title of \"the best\" from me again...?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Debeste. It seems like you have an obsession about being the best... But when you're on a case, winning and losing is of no importance.\nDebeste:\nWhat are you saying...? Obviously, it's best to be the best at everything!\nEdgeworth:\n...If you can't understand that, then you have no business being a prosecutor.\nDebeste:\nWha...! I-I...\nCourtney:\nPlease stop harassing Sebastian. Sebastian. A person of your caliber has no need to listen to such things.\nDebeste:\nJustine...! Yeah... you're right.\nCourtney:\nPlease leave this to me. Why don't you go check on the victim's condition?\nDebeste:\nY-Yeah... that's a great idea! I'll be right back then!\nCourtney:\nAlright. I'll be waiting.\nEdgeworth:\n(Judge Courtney is much more troublesome than Mr. Debeste...)\nCourtney:\nWell then... Ms. Curator. Can you tell us why Normallium was discovered in the teapot?\nKate:\nI was not aware that it contained such a chemical. I suppose it may have been an ingredient from the detergent I had used.\nCourtney:\n...So you're saying that you did not put it in deliberately?\nKate:\nNo. Of course not. There is no way for me to have known how to create the poison gas.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nDespite being a former actress, ...it seems you're not very good at lying.\nKate:\nWhat do you mean?\nEdgeworth:\nThe Angel's Recipe is in your possession. And the method to create the poison gas is contained inside that recipe book. So you must have known how to create it!\nKate:\n...I'm surprised you knew about that.\nCourtney:\nMs. Curator, is this true?\nKate:\n...It's true that information about the poison gas is contained in one of the recipes. However, just because I saw it does not mean that I was responsible for the crime. Could you tell me what set off the poison gas?\nCourtney:\nIt was caused by the victim heating the lid of the glass case with a burner.\nKate:\nHa ha... I see. If he locked himself in that room of his own will and then set off the poison gas... ...wouldn't that suggest \"suicide\"?\nEdgeworth:\n(Does she intend to deny it until the bitter end...?)\nKate:\nFuthermore, I wouldn't have been able to obtain a chemical like Megatoxin X.\nEdgeworth:\nThat may be true, but you could have stolen it from someone else.\nDelicia:\nThat reminds me. I met up with Katie a week ago and... ...that night was when I realized that my Megatoxin X was gone! Katie... you couldn't have...!\nKate:\n...Madame Delicia always carried her medicine bag around with her. Anyone could have stolen it.\nEdgeworth:\n(That's right... I don't have any proof that she was the one who stole it...!)\nRay:\nKatie. Can't you tell us what you're hiding? I know you're not the kind of person who would hurt someone without a reason.\nKate:\nMonsieur Shields... You doubt me as well?\nRay:\n...Setting a trap on one of the gallery's exhibits, and then disguising the rooms... I just think it would have been impossible for anyone but the curator...\nKate:\n.....That's not true. There are no guards or security cameras at this gallery. If any ill-intentioned person wanted to sneak into the gallery... ...it would have been an easy task for them.\nKay:\nTh-Then, isn't it like an all-you-can-steal buffet in here!? ...You have to be careful! You never know when a Great Thief could appear.\nEdgeworth:\n(It doesn't sound like a joke when Kay says it.)\nKate:\n...Actually, Monsieur Gustavia apparently entered the gallery before it opened.\nRay:\n...Well, I'm beat. Looks like Uncle Ray can't do anything to break down Kate's iron guard. Hmm. This might be a good time to use the technique your old man taught me.\nEdgeworth:\nThe techinque... my father taught you?\nRay:\nThis case is deeply connected to the one from 18 years ago. If we just pursue the present case, it may seem like there is a lot we don't understand... But if we try turning things around, there might be a hint in the case from the past.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Thinking the other way around\"...! (Did my father do that too?)\nRay:\nFor example... just consider the relationship between the past case and Kate...\nEdgeworth:\n...! (Ms. Hall melted Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures 18 years ago... And today, Mr. Dover's works are on display in this gallery. It can't be, she...!) I see... Now I know what to ask her.\nRay:\nHe he he. That's good to hear. In that case, Uncle Ray will just watch over you as you do your work.\nEdgeworth:\n...Ms. Katherine Hall. 18 years ago, it seems that you melted Mr. Dover's sherbet sculptures.\nKate:\nYes... I was young and inexperienced, and I did something inexcusable.\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, isn't that why you were able to open the Zodiac Art Gallery?\nKate:\n...I don't know what you mean.\nCourtney:\nI don't understand either. Prosecutor Edgeworth. Do you seek her testimony?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. I would like her to tell me about the Zodiac Art Gallery. I would like to know the reason you decided to open a gallery for Mr. Dover's artwork.\nCourtney:\nIf you insist that this is related to the case at hand... I will allow it. Ms. Curator. Your testimony, if you please.\nKate:\nVery well... if that will clear your suspicions about me...\nCourtney:\nNow then, please testify about the Zodiac Art Gallery.\n-- The Zodiac Art Gallery --\nKate:\n18 years after Monsieur Master was arrested, I was finally able to buy back this mansion.\nThen, in order to maintain it, I decided to manage it as an art gallery.\nI collected Pierre Hoquet's works from all over the world.\nAfter all, it was my dream to open the Zodiac Art Gallery.\nCourtney:\nIt's wonderful that your dream has come true. What do you think, Prosecutor Edgeworth? I don't believe there was anything strange about her testimony.\nEdgeworth:\n...Judge Courtney. I believe in the courtroom, it is standard to cross-examine the witness. Wouldn't you agree it's a little too early to say that there are no contradictions?\nCourtney:\nHmhm... you speak like a defense attorney. Very well. Proceed, as you please.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: It must've taken a lot of hard work these past 18 years, to buy back the mansion. Kate: ♪ The place full of my memoriiies with Monsieur Masteeer! It iiis the ooonly place for meee! No matter whaat, at any coost I wanted iiit baaaaaaack. ♬ Kay: Sh-She looks like she's having fun... Ray: Well... she is a former actress. Singing and dancing is her livelihood. Edgeworth: ...Enough with the singing. Please continue your testimony.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you managing this gallery by yourself? Kate: Yes. Well, I say \"manage,\" but it only opened today. And... I must continue protecting this mansion. So that Monsieur Master has a place to return to... Edgeworth: (So she took back the mansion for Mr. Master's sake...) Ray: Kate... I'm so sorry. I was powerless... Kate: ! It's not your fault, Monsieur Shields. I couldn't do anything either. ...All I can do now is continue to protect the mansion.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Pierre Hoquet... That's Mr. Dover's alias, correct? Kate: Yes. It's the name he used when he worked as a sculptor in France. Edgeworth: About collecting his works... How did you prepare the Taurus and Gemini sculptures? I heard that Mr. Dover passed away before he completed those two sculptures. Kate: I had the sculptures in the Winter Palace specially made, based on the photos I took. Edgeworth: Oh...? Could you tell us about that in more detail? Add statement: \"I prepared replicas of the sculptures in the Winter Palace based on the photos I took.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Opening the Zodiac Art Gallery was your dream? Kate: The truth is... I wanted to manage the gallery together with Monsieur Master. ♬ Singiiing and daaancing and aall kinds of sweeets! ♪ ...That's the kind of gallery I dreamed about. Edgeworth: (Was she planning on staging a musical in here?) Courtney: Jeffery Master disobeyed the Goddess of Law... It is unfortunate, but I'm afraid that your dream will never come to pass. Kate: No! Monsieur Master is... innocent. The prosecutor at the time did not believe it, but... Edgeworth: (In order to protect Katherine Hall... Jeffery Master gave a false confession. They were both trying to protect each other...)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: By photos, do you mean the ones taken in Isaac Dover's room? Kate: ...Yes. You seem quite familiar with the events from 18 years ago, Monsieur Edgeworth. Kay: So the sculptures in the Winter Palace were replicas. They melted and I didn't even get to see them once. Edgeworth: (No. The sherbet sculptures shouldn't have been replicas. Ms. Hall... is obviously lying.) Kate: After all that trouble it took to prepare them, it's a shame they melted...\nEdgeworth: (The sculptures in the Winter Palace are the same sherbet sculptures from 18 years ago. Unless I point that out to her, I won't be able to find out the truth...)",

It iiis the ooonly place for meee! No matter whaat, at any coost I wanted iiit baaaaaaack. ♬\nKay:\nSh-She looks like she's having fun...\nRay:\nWell... she is a former actress. Singing and dancing is her livelihood.\nEdgeworth:\n...Enough with the singing. Please continue your testimony.\nKate:\nThen, in order to maintain it, I decided to manage it as an art gallery.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you managing this gallery by yourself?\nKate:\nYes. Well, I say \"manage,\" but it only opened today. And... I must continue protecting this mansion. So that Monsieur Master has a place to return to...\nEdgeworth:\n(So she took back the mansion for Mr. Master's sake...)\nRay:\nKate... I'm so sorry. I was powerless...\nKate:\n! It's not your fault, Monsieur Shields. I couldn't do anything either. ...All I can do now is continue to protect the mansion.\nKate:\nI collected Pierre Hoquet's works from all over the world.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nPierre Hoquet... That's Mr. Dover's alias, correct?\nKate:\nYes. It's the name he used when he worked as a sculptor in France.\nEdgeworth:\nAbout collecting his works... How did you prepare the Taurus and Gemini sculptures? I heard that Mr. Dover passed away before he completed those two sculptures.\nKate:\nI had the sculptures in the Winter Palace specially made, based on the photos I took.\nEdgeworth:\nOh...? Could you tell us about that in more detail?\nAdd statement:\n\"I prepared replicas of the sculptures in the Winter Palace based on the photos I took.\"\nKate:\nAfter all, it was my dream to open the Zodiac Art Gallery.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nOpening the Zodiac Art Gallery was your dream?\nKate:\nThe truth is... I wanted to manage the gallery together with Monsieur Master. ♬ Singiiing and daaancing and aall kinds of sweeets! ♪ ...That's the kind of gallery I dreamed about.\nEdgeworth:\n(Was she planning on staging a musical in here?)\nCourtney:\nJeffery Master disobeyed the Goddess of Law... It is unfortunate, but I'm afraid that your dream will never come to pass.\nKate:\nNo! Monsieur Master is... innocent. The prosecutor at the time did not believe it, but...\nEdgeworth:\n(In order to protect Katherine Hall... Jeffery Master gave a false confession. They were both trying to protect each other...)\nKate:\nI prepared replicas of the sculptures in the Winter Palace based on the photos I took.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBy photos, do you mean the ones taken in Isaac Dover's room?\nKate:\n...Yes. You seem quite familiar with the events from 18 years ago, Monsieur Edgeworth.\nKay:\nSo the sculptures in the Winter Palace were replicas. They melted and I didn't even get to see them once.\nEdgeworth:\n(No. The sherbet sculptures shouldn't have been replicas. Ms. Hall... is obviously lying.)\nKate:\nAfter all that trouble it took to prepare them, it's a shame they melted...\nPresent Liquid Analysis Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Did you really think that your excuses would continue to hold up?\"\nEdgeworth:\n(The sculptures in the Winter Palace are the same sherbet sculptures from 18 years ago. Unless I point that out to her, I won't be able to find out the truth...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Did you really think that your excuses would continue to hold up? No matter how much you lie, you can't deny the composition of the sculptures. From the analysis results, it's quite clear... ...that the sculptures in the Winter Palace are the sherbet sculptures Mr. Dover created!\nDelicia:\nOi! Miley! As a pharmacist, it's my turn to shine! What we call \"sugar\" actually comes in many different varieties and tastes. Even if the sculptures were replicas, it's nearly impossible to replicate the composition!\nEdgeworth:\nI-I see. Thank you for the explanation. (Though I don't recall asking for one...)\nKate:\n....!\nEdgeworth:\nThat, Ms. Hall, means you couldn't have melted the sherbet sculptures back then. You stole them and preserved them for 18 years!\nKate:\nAAAAAAAHH!\nKay:\nWHAAAT!? She preserved the sherbet for 18 whole years!?\nRay:\nHmm. If you freeze it properly, it's not impossible.\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nSilence, please. ...Ms. Curator, what do you have to say?\nKate:\n...I can't believe you've already uncovered so much.\nCourtney:\nSo you're admitting that you stole the sherbet sculptures?\nKate:\n...No. I cannot admit to such a thing. There isn't any proof that I stole them, after all. Also... I couldn't have stolen the sculptures 18 years ago. I don't think they would've been easy to steal without the police noticing.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Is that so? I don't know what you did 18 years ago. As such, how can I judge how difficult it would have been to steal them?\nKate:\n...It looks like you won't give up so easily.\nEdgeworth:\nI don't intend on giving up until I learn the truth.\nKate:\n...I understand. Then I shall tell you. What I did 18 years ago.\n-- What I Did 18 Years Ago --\nKate:\nOn the day of the incident, I was waiting in the main building until the judging.\nDuring the judging, at Monsieur Master's request, I went to change the film in the camera.\nBut before I could deliver the camera to him, I discovered Monsieur Dover's body.\nAfter Monsieur Gregory arrived, I prepared tea for everyone involved in the investigation.\nIt was then that I witnessed Monsieur Gustavia entering Monsieur Dover's room.\nKate:\nAnd that was everything I had done on that day. I don't think there is anything suspicious about my actions.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not your decision to make.\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth, were there any contradictions in her testimony?\nEdgeworth:\nFor now, I should just prove that she stole the sculptures. (But when could Ms. Hall have stolen them...? If I can answer that, her crime should come to light!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: What were you doing before the judging began? Kate: I was in my room on the second floor, practicing my dancing. I was performing on the TV show \"Piece of Cake\" back then... Kay: Piece of Cake...? What kind of show was that? Edgeworth: ...It was a children's program. The hosts made sweets while singing and dancing. Kay: Ooooh! That sounds like fun! Ray: Well, that's unexpected! You knew about the show, Miles? Edgeworth: M-My father told me about it once, so I just happened to watch it a few times. (So Ms. Hall was practicing her dancing in her room... Could Ms. Hall have stolen the sculptures then?) She stole them then Edgeworth: This was when you stole the sherbet sculptures! Kate: And how would I have done that? Edgeworth: That's... Hmm... Kay: Not even a Great Thief could have taken it then, you know! Edgeworth: (It seems... I was mistaken.) ...My apologies. Please continue, Ms. Hall. It couldn't have been then Edgeworth: (...It could't have been then. I should listen to more of her testimony.) Edgeworth: This was when you stole the sherbet sculptures! Kate: And how would I have done that? Edgeworth: That's... Hmm... Kay: Not even a Great Thief could have taken it then, you know! Edgeworth: (It seems... I was mistaken.) ...My apologies. Please continue, Ms. Hall. Edgeworth: (...It could't have been then. I should listen to more of her testimony.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you were the only one who could move freely during the judging period? Kate: I certainly would have had more freedom to move about than the contestants. However... I couldn't possibly have stolen the sculptures right in front of Monsieur Master. Moreover, upon being asked to change the film, I went directly to the entryway. Edgeworth: (At Mr. Master's request, she went to change the film in the camera... Could Ms. Hall have stolen the sculptures then?) She stole them then Edgeworth: This was when you stole the sherbet sculptures! Kate: And how would I have done that? Edgeworth: That's... Hmm... Kay: Not even a Great Thief could have taken it then, you know! Edgeworth: (It seems... I was mistaken.) ...My apologies. Please continue, Ms. Hall.

Please continue, Ms. Hall. Edgeworth: (...It could't have been then. I should listen to more of her testimony.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you entered Mr. Master's room before you delivered the camera? Kate: Yes. I heard the sound of something breaking, you see. Kate: ...Monsieur Master? Are you in here? Eek...! Ray: ...That was actually the sound of the ship breaking. Someone snuck a bite of it, you see. Edgeworth: When the body was discovered, was Mr. Master still judging Mr. Gustavia's room? Kate: I am sure that he was. Monsieur Master is the type of person who would carefully judge one room at a time. Edgeworth: (She found Mr. Dover's body inside Mr. Master's room... Could Ms. Hall have stolen the sculptures then?) She stole them then Edgeworth: This was when you stole the sherbet sculptures! Kate: And how would I have done that? Edgeworth: That's... Hmm...

Please continue, Ms. Hall. Edgeworth: (...It could't have been then. I should listen to more of her testimony.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Did you do so in the same manner as today? Kate: Yes. I poured tea for everyone working on the investigation. Ray: Now that you mention it, Uncle Ray also got some tea from you that day. Kate was pushing her service cart back and forth, from the patio to the main building. Edgeworth: I see. Did anything seem strange to you then? Ray: Hmm... Well, I remember your old man singing praises of her Ceylon tea. And he also said something about how the saucer was chilled. Edgeworth: (...The saucer was chilled? Could Ms. Hall have stolen the sculptures then?) She stole them then Leads to: \"This was when you stole the sherbet sculptures!\" It couldn't have been then Edgeworth: (...It could't have been then. I should listen to more of her testimony.) Leads to: \"This was when you stole the sherbet sculptures!\" Edgeworth: (...It could't have been then. I should listen to more of her testimony.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: When exactly did Mr. Gustavia enter the victim's room? Kate: It was when Monsieur Gregory and the rest were investigating the crime scene... Ray: Apparently Mr. Gustavia went into Mr. Dover's room to retreive a family photo. Kay: He stole the picture so their partnership would remain a secret, right? But, you can't be a Great Thief if you get caught stealing! Edgeworth: Kay, I don't think Mr. Gustavia is a Great Thief... (The moment Mr. Gustavia sneaked into Mr. Dover's room... Could Ms. Hall have stolen the sculptures then?) She stole them then Edgeworth: This was when you stole the sherbet sculptures! Kate: And how would I have done that? Edgeworth: That's... Hmm... Kay: Not even a Great Thief could have taken it then, you know! Edgeworth: (It seems... I was mistaken.) ...My apologies. Please continue, Ms. Hall. It couldn't have been then Edgeworth: (...It could't have been then. I should listen to more of her testimony.) Edgeworth: This was when you stole the sherbet sculptures!

Please continue, Ms. Hall. Edgeworth: (...It could't have been then. I should listen to more of her testimony.)\nEdgeworth: Now, when could she have stolen the sculptures?\nKay: When did Ms. Hall steal the sherbet, eh...? Hmm. Even with the brains of a Great Thief, I'm stumped.\nRay: If you want to know what happened, you should ask someone who was there. Don't forget, you can always count on Uncle Ray!\nEdgeworth: ...Yes, that's right.",

Monsieur Shields and company were at the Fountain Patio the entire time. Are you saying that I stole them in broad daylight?\nEdgeworth:\n...That's precisely what I'm saying. (This is where she hid the sculptures, to steal them right under the noses...!)\nPresent tea cart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Neither my father nor Mr. Shields realized the sculpture was right in front of them.\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWouldn't it be possible to hide them here?\nKate:\nMonsieur Shields would certainly have noticed if the sculptures were hidden there.\nRay:\nOf course!

What you were pushing around was no ordinary service cart. It was the sculpture itself!\nKate:\nEeeeeeeeek!\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nBut surely that would still be impossible! If she placed the sculptures on the service cart, people would notice immediately.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI never said she used the \"service cart\" to move the sculptures.\nCourtney:\nWhat...!? What do you mean? Then what did she use to move the sculptures around!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is what Ms. Hall used to transport the sculptures!\nPresent Lift Trolley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"And this is...?\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nObviously, she used this to carry them around.\nCourtney:\n...Well, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Could you please show us how she would have done so?\nEdgeworth:\nW-Well, that's...\nCourtney:\nThere's no way you could use that to move the sculptures.\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (Indeed, it's as she says...)\nCourtney:\nI will have you write a letter of reflection on this later on.\nEdgeworth:\nBefore that... could I please have one more chance?\nCourtney:\n...I guess I have no choice. I'll hear what you have to say one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"This is what Ms. Hall used to transport the sculptures!\"\nCourtney:\nAnd this is...?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the lift trolley Mr. Dover used 18 years ago to move his sherbet sculptures. It seems this same lift trolley lies here, in the Fountain Patio.\nKate:\n...That's because it was originally prepared for the contest in the first place.\nCourtney:\nAre you saying she used the lift trolley to move the sculptures?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. If the sculptures were placed on this lift trolley, and then covered with a tablecloth... ...it could be disguised as a service cart, and moved without arousing suspicion!\nCourtney:\nH-How could that be...!?\nRay:\n...So the saucers were chilled because they were sitting on the ice sculptures?\nKate:\n......\nRay:\nKate...! What's the meaning of this? What were you thinking...!?\nKate:\n...... That was truly impressive.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nKate:\nYou certainly are... Monsieur Gregory's son. After 18 years... it's hard to imagine any proof that I stole the sculptures remained... But, I knew it was only a matter of time until I was suspected.\nCourtney:\nMs. Curator. Does this mean you admit to stealing the sculptures?\nKate:\n...Yes. I admit it. 18 years ago, I stole the sherbet sculptures from Monsieur Dover's room. It's just as Monsieur Edgeworth says. I disguised the lift trolley as a service cart. And I served tea as I made my way back and forth. That wasn't all. I also took the ice block with all the star clusters on it...\nEdgeworth:\n(An ice block with star clusters on it...? That seems familiar...)\nEdgeworth:\n(A giant block of ice is being displayed here. It appears to be quite heavy... No, the inside must be hollow.)\nEdgeworth:\n(The Winter Palace is a reproduction of Mr. Dover's room from 18 years ago. Because they had melted, my father never got the chance to see them... But those blocks of ice were also originally from Dover's Sherbet Salon.)\nKate:\nThe two sculptures and the two blocks of ice, I took everything I could... ...and then I placed empty glass cases in Monsieur Dover's room. The sculptures were all encased in glass to preserve their fine details... ...but the ice blocks were being displayed as they were. As per the rules, we prepared the glass cases for Mr. Dover.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm. So it would have been easy for her to prepare the glass cases...)\nKate:\nIn Monsieur Dover's room, there were some sculptures that were still unfinished. I thought I melted them, it would look like the ones I stole had melted too... So, everything you see in the Winter Palace are all original works from 18 years ago.\nKay:\nMs. Hall... It didn't take much to get her to confess.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Then she must know. She knows it isn't enough to try her in court.)\nKate:\nThat is all I have to say. But... Even though I admit to stealing the sculptures, you can't arrest me for it.\nKay:\nWhat!? Wh-What do you mean by that?\nCourtney:\nHeavens! You're assisting an investigation without knowing this much? Perhaps you should read this book concerning the \"Statute of Limitations\".\nKay:\nS-Statute of limitations...?\nStatute of Limitation data jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nTo put it simply... ...it's the time frame in which a suspect can be taken to court. ...You can see it on this page.\nKay:\nThe statute of limitations for murder is 15 years, and for theft it's 7 years..... AH!\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right... And Ms. Hall's theft was 18 years ago. According to statute, she cannot be arrested for stealing the sculptures.\nKay:\nSo that's how it is...\nCourtney:\nStealing evidence from a crime scene is an unforgivable offense. However, for this crime at least, we have no right to pass judgement. ...it appears that Prosecutor Edgeworth's tepid reasoning has all been for naught.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... I wonder about that. I deduced Ms. Hall's actions simply to expose a different crime. If she only took the sculptures, we wouldn't have found the body from 18 years ago.\nKate:\n...Are you saying that I hid Monsieur Dover's body?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's correct.\nKay:\nBut, how can someone hide a body for 18 years?\nEdgeworth:\nI would imagine it would be very difficult, under normal circumstances.\nKay:\nSo you're saying the circumstances weren't... normal...?\nCourtney:\nAre you claiming that you knew where the body was hidden?\nEdgeworth:\nWhen you consider Ms. Hall's actions, the answer becomes obvious. 18 years ago, Ms. Hall stole something more than just sherbet sculptures.\nCourtney:\nIf you're so confident, I would like to hear your answer. Where did Ms. Hall hide the body!?\nPresent Winter Palace Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is the photograph of Mr. Dover's sculptures...?\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sure Ms. Hall hid the body... here!\nCourtney:\n...Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please show us how she could have done so.\nEdgeworth:\nW-Well... isn't it obvious?\nCourtney:\nI believe you have confused \"obvious\" with \"impossible\" Prosecutor Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (Indeed, it's as she says...)\nCourtney:\nIf you plan on disrupting the investigation, I will have you removed immediately.\nEdgeworth:\nBefore that... could I please have one more chance?\nCourtney:\n...As you wish. But if you continue to be disruptive, I will not hesitate.\nLeads back to:\n\"Where did Ms. Hall hide the body!?\"\nCourtney:\nThis is the photograph of Mr. Dover's sculptures...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, and perhaps you've noticed that the victim's body can be seen in this picture?\nCourtney:\n.....I do not see it. Please point it out clearly. Where in this picture can one see the body of the victim?\nEdgeworth:\n(It's time to expose the location of the body in the photograph!)\nPresent Gemini Sculpture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The Gemini Sculpture...?\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis was Mr. Dover's body.\nCourtney:\n...Does that honestly look like a body to you...?\nRay:\nYou OK, Miles? Maybe all that thinking short-circuited your brain?\nKay:\nI always knew this day would come...\nDelicia:\nMiley. Do you need medicine?\nKate:\nHow about some nice Ceylon tea?\nEdgeworth:\nI-I'm fine, thanks. (Those looks of pity... they pierce my soul...)\nCourtney:\nWhy don't you try again one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"(It's time to expose the location of the body in the photograph!)\"\nCourtney:\nThe Gemini Sculpture...?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... While it may look like the Gemini Sculpture at first glance... ...in reality, this is none other than Isaac Dover himself!\nCourtney:\nThis... This ice sculpture was the victim's body...? But all I can see from this picture is an ice sculpture statue...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThat's because a certain piece of evidence was used to conceal it.\nCourtney:\nConceal it...? Which piece of evidence did Ms. Hall use to conceal the body!?\nPresent Fluorescent Cloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is... the cloth that was covering the sculptures in the Autumn Palace...\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nShe used this!\nKate:\nWhaat makes you think! ♪ Thaat thiis prooves anything! ♬ About mee hiding the boodyy! ♬\nEdgeworth:\n(Urgh.....!)\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! Let's sing a duet for a rebuttal!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, I'll be fine alone. ...And next time, I won't let her sing.\nCourtney:\nI don't have time to waste, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please get it right this time.\nLeads back to:\n\"Which piece of evidence did Ms. Hall use to conceal the body!?\"\nCourtney:\nThis is... the cloth that was covering the sculptures in the Autumn Palace...\nEdgeworth:\nThis cloth manipulates light. With it, it's entirely possible to make something look like ice. Isn't that right, Delicia?\nDelicia:\nYessie! When it glows red, it's like a raging inferno! And when it glows blue, you can almost feel the glittering cool ice!\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nThat cloth will only emit light when it is attached to a special device!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney... Look closely at the picture one more time. Beneath the Gemini case... lies a box-shaped object attached to the pedestal.\nCourtney:\nTh-This is...!\nEdgeworth:\nA rainbow light device. Detective Gumshoe reported one in the Winter Palace. This is the device that went missing 18 years ago. Originally, it would have been attached to the cloth inside the glass case. Naturally, Ms. Hall took the device with her when she moved the sculptures. By using the rainbow light device to make the fluorescent cloth glow... ...Mr. Dover's body was made to look like an ice sculpture!\nCourtney:\nThat's... ridiculous...!\nRay:\nSo then, when Uncle Ray took a photo of the Winter Palace...\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right. The body had been in front of us all along, disguised as Gemini!\nCourtney:\nHowever, the body and the fluorescent cloth were both discovered in the fountain. If the ice sculpture was the body, we would have found it in the Winter Palace!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIf we had found it there, her trick would have been revealed immediately. Ms. Hall moved the body out of the Winter Palace to prevent us from discovering it.\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nAbsurd. You say she threw the body into the fountain without any of us noticing?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, Judge Courtney... There was no need for that. She simply used the same method as before. Remember the lift trolley...?\nCourtney:\nA... Aaaah!\nEdgeworth:\nShe moved the body to some other room and dumped it into the stream to the fountain. ...Naturally, the frozen body would have sunk to the bottom of the fountain. That's why the cloth floated up first, and was found by Delicia.\nCourtney:\nAnd eventually, the body thawed out and floated to the surface...?\nKate:\nMonsieur Edgeworth. You truly have a gift for deductive reasoning. However... do you have any proof that I moved the body?\nEdgeworth:\n......\nKate:\nIf you cannot prove that, then there is no way I can accept what you are saying.\nKay:\nHrmm... Wasn't there anyone who saw Ms. Hall move the body?\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, I believe such a person exists. (The answers lie in the evidence that person gave me... And that piece of evidence will reveal the truth of Ms. Hall's actions.)\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. Are you able to prove the crime of Ms. Curator?\nEdgeworth:\nCertainly. I have evidence that will show exactly what she did.\nCourtney:\nThen, it's time we see your answer. Which piece of evidence reveals Ms. Curator's actions?\nPresent Sketch of Beauties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Another sketch?\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nJust by looking at this, you should be able to understand. ...Let it enlighten you.\nCourtney:\n........\nKay:\nOverruled!\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! Wh-Why are you...!\nKay:\nI thought it would be less embarrassing if I was the one to say it... But well, you can't really show what Ms. Hall was doing with that, y'know?\nEdgeworth:\n(I suppose not... I should present something else.)\nCourtney:\nLet us hear your answer one more time.\nLeads back to:\n\"Which piece of evidence reveals Ms. Curator's actions?\"\nCourtney:\n...Another sketch? ...Oh? It appears I have been drawn in this one...\nEdgeworth:\nThis is a sketch Larry drew of the women at the Fountain Patio. I would like to direct your attention to the service cart on the left side of the sketch.\nCourtney:\nService cart...? What about it?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Don't you see? What transpired 18 years ago has happened again. Ms. Hall was moving... the body in this sketch!\nCourtney:\nNo...!\nKate:\n...Please wait. I don't see Monsieur Dover's body anywhere in that drawing. All I did was hand out chocolates to everyone.\nEdgeworth:\nThe key detail in this sketch is the color of the tablecloth. Up until now, I thought Larry had just made a mistake.\nCourtney:\n...The tablecloth. It's light blue.\nEdgeworth:\nIt may be light blue in the sketch, but no blue tablecloths exist in this mansion. Perhaps it's light blue because the body was hidden, still glowing, underneath the tablecloth.\nCourtney:\nWhat...! B-But... the lift trolley is rectangular in the sketch! If she just placed the body in the lift trolley, we would notice it immediately!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThere were two blocks of ice in the Winter Palace that are completely hollowed out. If she put the body inside the block of ice, it would look like a service cart.\nCourtney:\nThat's...!\nEdgeworth:\n...Ms. Hall. You put the body in the block of ice and used the lift trolley to move it, didn't you?\nKate:\nI... I never imagined you would be able to deduce so much from just a single sketch. ...But what if it was just a mistake, like you said before? It doesn't prove anything.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... I agree that alone the sketch is worthless.\nKate:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nOnce you removed the body, the \"service cart\" would revert back to a lift trolley. That's why the lift trolley was left behind in the Fountain Patio. And without the service cart, there would be no place for you to put your chocolates.\nKate:\nThe chocolates I gave everyone...?\nEdgeworth:\nUntil then, the chocolates had sat on top of the service cart as you gave them away... ...but when you gave them to us, you took them from your pocket.\nKate:\nAh... Now that you mention it, they were a bit melted. But they were still really sweet and tasty!\nEdgeworth:\nSo, why was it necessary to put them in your pocket halfway through?\nKate:\nTh-That's because...!\nEdgeworth:\nThat's because once the body was disposed of, you no longer had a service cart.\nKate:\n...Aaah!\nCourtney:\nHold it right there. If she put the chocolates in her pocket, and left the lift trolley in the patio. Then... Where did the tablecloth go?\nEdgeworth:\n(If she had been forced to put the chocolates in her pocket... ...she wouldn't have had time to dispose of the tablecloth!)\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. Can you answer that for me?\nEdgeworth:\nThe tablecloth wasn't hidden. It's right in front of us.\nCourtney:\n...Do clarify. The tablecloth used to hide the body. Where is it now?\nIt's inside the fountain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf I may be so blunt, it's inside the fountain.\nCourtney:\nIf I may be blunt as well... We have already investigated the fountain.\nRay:\nMiles... If I may also be blunt, I think that's wrong.\nEdgeworth:\nI-It seems so...\nRay:\nOh yeah... When we first met Kate... ...she had something that looked like a tablecloth wrapped around her waist.\nEdgeworth:\n! I see... That must be the key to exposing the truth of her actions.\nRay:\nYeah... Seems so.\nCourtney:\nWell then... This time for sure, tell us clearly.\nLeads back to:\n\"The tablecloth used to hide the body. Where is it now?\"\nIt's outside of the patio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt is... probably hidden somewhere outside of the patio.\nCourtney:\nOutside of the patio? And where exactly do you mean?\nEdgeworth:\n...I don't know that yet...\nCourtney:\nMost of the world would fall \"outside of the patio.\" If that's all you have to say, I'm afraid you're only wasting our time.\nEdgeworth:\nNnnnnnngh...! (If I just calmly consider the possibilities, there's only one place it can be.)\nRay:\nOh yeah... When we first met Kate... ...she had something that looked like a tablecloth wrapped around her waist.\nEdgeworth:\n! I see... That must be the key to exposing the truth of her actions.\nRay:\nYeah... Seems so.\nCourtney:\nWell then... This time for sure, tell us clearly.\nLeads back to:\n\"The tablecloth used to hide the body. Where is it now?\"\nMs. Hall has it with her\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Isn't it obvious? Ms. Hall is carrying it with her out in the open.\"\nEdgeworth:\nIsn't it obvious? Ms. Hall is carrying it with her out in the open.\nCourtney:\nOut in the open...? Ah...! Y-You mean...!\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Hall. You are... wearing the tablecloth around your waist!\nKate:\n......\nEdgeworth:\nThe block of ice was not encased in a glass case. In other words, the tablecloth was in direct contact with the block of ice. If we have it examined, we will undoubtedly find traces of sherbet on it. ...Ms. Hall. You will turn your tablecloth over to the police at once!\nKate:\n...... .....There's no need to examine the tablecloth.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nKate:\n...It is just as you say. I stole the poison from Madame Delicia, and I moved the body... I have done... I have done terrible things.\nKate:\nMadame Delicia... I am so sorry. One week ago, I took your Megatoxin X bottle. I slipped it into that man's pocket... to make it look like suicide. And if they suspected it was murder, the evidence would point to Madame Delicia.\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform of Lift Trolley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis was made to look like a service cart, and was used to move the body.\nKay:\nAnd the reason the lift was wet was because the body had been kept inside a case of ice.\nDelicia:\nEep! K-Katie?\nRay:\nKate...! What were you thinking...? Weren't we always trying to save Mr. Master together!?\nKate:\nI... could not let myself be arrested. Not until... I had proven Monsieur Master's innocence...! From the very beginning, I had planned to turn myself in once everything was over... ...but I suppose it is too late to say that now.\nRay:\nKate... Why? Why would you go this far...?\nKate:\n...Even for Monsieur Shields, I've caused nothing but trouble. For the past 18 years... I have been a criminal.\nCourtney:\nThe IS-7 Incident... Don't tell me that you were the true culprit?\nKate:\nMy greatest crime was stealing the sherbet sculptures for my own selfish interests. When Monsieur Dover died... they were no longer just ordinary sculptures. They had become the final works of the sculptor Monsieur Master so deeply loved. What if... What if they melted before Monsieur Master returned? With that in mind, I couldn't let anyone touch them, not even the police... Even though I knew it was wrong, I moved them to the mansion's freezer... However... I only wanted to preserve Monsieur Dover's art. I did not know his body was hidden among them...!\nEdgeworth:\n(So she stole the sculptures without noticing the body...)\nKate:\nMonsieur Master would never take another person's life. But, because of me, the body vanished, and Monsieur Master was found... Guilty...! That kind man... he treated someone like me as family. He meant more to me than anyone else, and yet...!\nRay:\nKate...\nKate:\nWhen Monsieur Master was found guilty, I was chased out of this mansion. I was finally able to reclaim the mansion just a few days ago, but... ...when I saw the sculptures still sleeping away in the freezer, I realized... ...that I was the one who hid Monsieur Dover's body. However... the statute of limitations had already expired. Therefore, I... ...could think of no other way to atone for my sins...!\nEdgeworth:\n..... (...It appears I have misunderstood her. It seems... she caused this entire incident in order to save Mr. Master.)\nKay:\nWhatcha thinking about, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...There is one thing that has been bothering me this whole time. Why would Ms. Hall plan a murder with such an uncertain method like poison gas? And, the reason she disguised the Autumn Palace to look like the Winter Palace... ...was to make those involved in the incident 18 years ago confuse the two rooms.\nKay:\nI wonder what Kate was trying to accomplish...?\nEdgeworth:\n(She was trying to prove Mr. Master's innocence... In that case, Ms. Hall's true objective was...!)\nTo turn herself in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(To turn herself in by exposing her crime... No, if that was her goal, she didn't have to take things this far.)\nLeads back to:\n\"(In that case, Ms. Hall's true objective was...!)\"\nTo find the true culprit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"(Perhaps she was trying to find the true culprit?)\"\nTo make us find the body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Was it to make us investigate and find the body? But, that's not enough to prove Mr. Master's innocence...)\nLeads back to:\n\"(In that case, Ms. Hall's true objective was...!)\"\nEdgeworth:\n(Perhaps she was trying to find the true culprit?) Ms. Hall... Were you trying to prove Mr. Master's innocence?\nKate:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nYou wanted to reveal the true culprit and have the police find the body from 18 years ago... Was that not your true goal?\nKate:\n.....\nEdgeworth:\nBy displaying those sculptures, you'd attract those involved in the past incident. Only two people would know where the body was hidden. You... and the true culprit.\nRay:\nThe culprit would've panicked, knowing that the body would be displayed publicly...\nEdgeworth:\nYes. And if the culprit really showed up, there's the risk they'd erase their tracks. In the worst-case scenario, they might have even stolen the body. So, how could she protect the evidence while simultaneously luring in the culprit?\nRay:\n...I see. That's why she made the Autumn Palace look like the Winter Palace...!\nEdgeworth:\nYes. And then... Ms. Hall, you must have thought... ...whoever opens the Pisces case, believing it to be the Gemini case... ...must be the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident!\nKate:\n!\nCourtney:\nWhat...!\nKay:\nB-But that means...! That person is... the true culprit...?\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nPlease wait a moment, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Do you realize what you're saying? Do you intend to accuse that person of being the culprit behind the IS-7 Incident!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Ms. Hall was trying to trap the true culprit... If so, wouldn't the person who feel for the trap, be the true culprit? However... I have no evidence to back up my claims. If I make a formal accusation without any proof, it will not end well. Should I announce the true killer of Isaac Dover...?)\nMake an accusation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"(What I should do is reveal \"the truth.\")\"\nDon't make an accusation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Should I be more careful and do it after I've collected more evidence? ...No, if I miss this chance I might not be able to work on this case any further. Above all, I can't just leave the true culprit at large any longer... I can't just leave the people that have suffered for 18 years! I will solve this case by my own hand!)\nLeads to:\n\"(What I should do is reveal \"the truth.\")\"\nEdgeworth:\n(What I should do is reveal \"the truth.\" In that case... there is no need to hesitate!) ...Yes, that's correct. Judge Courtney. I indict this person as the true culprit behind the IS-7 Incident!\nPresent Dane Gustavia profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Dane Gustavia, who fell victim to the poison gas, is the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident...?\"\nPresent anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nCourtney:\n...Is there any basis to suspect this person?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is... not.\nCourtney:\nIt's outrageous that you would suspect somebody without any basis! You could get sued for defamation!\nEdgeworth:\n(There is nothing more embarrassing than to fail at this juncture...)\nRay:\nIf it came to that, you want me to be your lawyer?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, no thanks... Before that allow me to correct myself!\nLeads back to:\n\"Which piece of evidence reveals Ms. Curator's actions?\"\nCourtney:\nDane Gustavia, who fell victim to the poison gas, is the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident...?\nDelicia:\nG-Gusty is...!\nRay:\nMr. Gustavia...\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Hall. Didn't you believe, that if you opened this gallery, the true culprit would come? That's why... you set up the poison gas trap, is it not?\nKate:\n...You truly have... a gifted mind, just like your father. It is as you say, Monsieur Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\n...Now, would you please tell us the whole truth?\nKate:\nYes... I have nothing more to hide. I will... tell you everything. I set a trap in the gallery to find the true culprit. Before the gallery opened... I left only the Autumn Palace unlocked. At opening time, when I went around to unlock each room... I discovered that the Autumn Palace had been locked from the inside. I knew that the true culprit was on the other side of the door. My hand was... t-trembling...\nEdgeworth:\n(...All that was left was for the trap do its work...)\nKate:\nWhen I heard Monsieur Gustavia was exposed to the poison gas, I realized he was the culprit. And, I thought that if the police discovered Monsieur Dover's body... ...it would prove Monsieur Master's innocence.\nRay:\n...Why didn't you ever come talk to me...? There might have been another way!\nKate:\nI know that you did everything you could for me over the past 18 years. However... all of this had been brought on by my own crime... That's why I wanted to save Monsieur Master as soon as possible...!\nRay:\nKate...\nKate:\nNot only that, the police hid the fact that the body went missing 18 years ago. Even if I reported the body, there was a chance that the truth would be hidden again. That's why I caused the incident at the museum's opening, with as many witnesses as possible.\nRay:\n.....I'm sorry. Gregory, Mr. Master... And even you... I couldn't protect anyone!\nEdgeworth:\n(Mr. Shields... It must be tough on him as well.)\nKate:\nThe one who should be apologizing... is me. Monsieur Edgeworth. Monsieur Shields. ...I'm terribly sorry. I shall accept whatever punishment I am given. However, I must ask of you... Please clear Monsieur Master's name!\nEdgeworth:\n(The truth that was hidden for 18 years was revealed in an unexpected manner... However... to think that things would end this way...)\nTo be continued.\nApril 2, 3:11 PMZodiac Art GalleryFountain Patio\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Hall. ...Have you composed yourself?\nKate:\n...Yes.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat you did, no matter the reason, was unforgivable.\nKate:\nYes, I know.\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, you committed this crime in order to prove Mr. Master's innocence. If the true culprit is someone else, we have a duty to reinvestigate.\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nNo false evidence from the IS-7 Incident remains in the official case files. Moreover, there is no evidence to lend credence to Ms. Hall's testimony. We should first arrest Ms. Hall as the culprit behind today's incident.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWe cannot be certain that all the case files are accurate. After all, the prosecutor in the case has a history of... forging evidence.\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nAre you suggesting that the P.I.C. overlooked such a prosecutor...?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's none of my concern. The truth is that evidence was falsified. ...And the fact that Dover's body from 18 years ago was just discovered proves it.\nCourtney:\n..... Prosecutor Edgeworth. I can see remnants of Prosecutor von Karma within you...\nEdgeworth:\n...What did you say?\nCourtney:\nYou try to deceive the P.I.C. and fabricate the truth! Let me inform you of my... or rather, the P.I.C.'s logic.\n-- The P.I.C.'s Logic --\nCourtney:\nI acknowledge that Prosecutor von Karma fabricated the information about the body.\nHowever, he successfully convicted Mr. Master as an accomplice.\nI believe that the true culprit was Ms. Curator herself.\nShe even attempted to murder Mr. Gustavia today, in order to pin the blame on him.\nEdgeworth:\nIs that really... what the P.I.C. believes?\nCourtney:\nYes. Every word I utter is for the sake of law and order.\nEdgeworth:\n(...It seems she intends to hide the truth for the sake of the P.I.C. At this rate, neither Mr. Master nor Ms. Hall will be saved...!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: If you acknowledge that, why won't you reopen the case! Courtney: The Goddess of Law does not err in her judgements. While Prosecutor von Karma may have used underhanded tactics... Ray: Ray: If you ask me, it's all been bogus ever since Von Karma fabricated evidence. And you claim that justice was served... What is the P.I.C. thinking? Courtney: ...I can already declare my verdict. There is no need for further investigation. Edgeworth: Let's hear your explanation on the matter then.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I heard that the biggest factor in Mr. Master's conviction was his confession. If Prosecutor von Karma had a hand in his confession, the ruling may not be just. Courtney: Courtney: The initial investigation was handled by Detective Rip Lacer... He was the one who obtained the confession... according to the official reports. All I can say is that the ruling has already been handed down. Kay: Jeez! Why does Ms. Courtney have to be so stubborn? Is the P.I.C. so high and mighty? Edgeworth: ...They sure seem like the archenemy of prosecutors, to say the least. Kay: Hmm. So they're kinda like what the police are to Great Thieves... Edgeworth: (...Says the Great Thief who nonchalantly works alongside the police.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you saying that both Ms. Hall and Mr. Master murdered Isaac Dover? Courtney: Mr. Master committed the murder, while Ms. Curator moved the body... That's what I believe. Kate: What...! How can you say that...!? We would never kill Monsieur Dover...! Courtney: Did you not steal the body and preserve it for 18 years? ...It is only natural to suspect you of being an accomplice. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: She has already confessed to her crimes. And now is not the time to judge her of her past crimes. Courtney: ...In that case, let's judge Ms. Hall for her current crime.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: If she wanted to pin the crime on somebody, why choose Mr. Gustavia? Courtney: Perhaps Mr. Gustavia suspected Ms. Hall was the criminal. As he attempted to confirm whether or not the Gemini Sculpture was genuine... ...he was caught in a trap meant to silence him forever. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Can you prove that theory? Courtney: Mr. Gustavia is currently teetering on the brink of death. There's probably no way to prove it, unless he regains consciousness. In other words... there is nothing we can do for now. Edgeworth: That can't be true. There must still be something we can do! Courtney: You still don't get it, do you...? Allow me to give you a clearer explanation. Edgeworth: (In order to protect Katherine Hall... Jeffery Master gave a false confession. They were both trying to protect each other...) Add statements: \"We already have ample evidence for both the IS-7 Incident and today's poison gas incident.\" and \"There is no need to investigate any further.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: By ample evidence, you mean...? Courtney: For the IS-7 Incident, we have a body, the murder weapon... and a pair of suspects. For the poison gas incident, we have the two chemicals and Ms. Hall's confession. Furthermore, I have finished collecting all the evidence necessary... ...for your own P.I.C. hearing, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Edgeworth: What...! Kay: H-How can you say something like that so casually! Ray: Miles, you know you're always welcome to join the Edgeworth Law Offices. Edgeworth: ...Mmgh... Judge Courtney. I'd like to ask that you refrain from making such needless remarks. Courtney: Hmhm... I understand. Well, regardless...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you saying that there is nothing left for us to investigate? Courtney: We have already exhausted all ends in regards to the evidence. This court will accept no further deliberations. I shall now deliver my verdict for the defendant, Katherine Hall. I hereby pronounce you... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hold it! There is still a need for further investigation! Courtney: If you wish to halt my verdict, please do so with evidence. That is, if there is any evidence that requires further deliberation...\nEdgeworth: (I cannot allow this case to end here. There is still something that needs to be cleared up! Looks like I'll have to show Judge Courtney something to convince her...!)",

So they're kinda like what the police are to Great Thieves...\nEdgeworth:\n(...Says the Great Thief who nonchalantly works alongside the police.)\nCourtney:\nI believe that the true culprit was Ms. Curator herself.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you saying that both Ms. Hall and Mr. Master murdered Isaac Dover?\nCourtney:\nMr. Master committed the murder, while Ms. Curator moved the body... That's what I believe.\nKate:\nWhat...! How can you say that...!? We would never kill Monsieur Dover...!\nCourtney:\nDid you not steal the body and preserve it for 18 years? ...It is only natural to suspect you of being an accomplice.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nShe has already confessed to her crimes. And now is not the time to judge her of her past crimes.\nCourtney:\n...In that case, let's judge Ms. Hall for her current crime.\nCourtney:\nShe even attempted to murder Mr. Gustavia today, in order to pin the blame on him.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf she wanted to pin the crime on somebody, why choose Mr. Gustavia?\nCourtney:\nPerhaps Mr. Gustavia suspected Ms. Hall was the criminal. As he attempted to confirm whether or not the Gemini Sculpture was genuine... ...he was caught in a trap meant to silence him forever.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nCan you prove that theory?\nCourtney:\nMr. Gustavia is currently teetering on the brink of death. There's probably no way to prove it, unless he regains consciousness. In other words... there is nothing we can do for now.\nEdgeworth:\nThat can't be true. There must still be something we can do!\nCourtney:\nYou still don't get it, do you...? Allow me to give you a clearer explanation.\nEdgeworth:\n(In order to protect Katherine Hall... Jeffery Master gave a false confession. They were both trying to protect each other...)\nAdd statements:\n\"We already have ample evidence for both the IS-7 Incident and today's poison gas incident.\" and \"There is no need to investigate any further.\"\nCourtney:\nWe already have ample evidence for both the IS-7 Incident and today's poison gas incident.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBy ample evidence, you mean...?\nCourtney:\nFor the IS-7 Incident, we have a body, the murder weapon... and a pair of suspects. For the poison gas incident, we have the two chemicals and Ms. Hall's confession. Furthermore, I have finished collecting all the evidence necessary... ...for your own P.I.C. hearing, Prosecutor Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...!\nKay:\nH-How can you say something like that so casually!\nRay:\nMiles, you know you're always welcome to join the Edgeworth Law Offices.\nEdgeworth:\n...Mmgh... Judge Courtney. I'd like to ask that you refrain from making such needless remarks.\nCourtney:\nHmhm... I understand. Well, regardless...\nPresent Liquid Analysis Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is still one piece of evidence from the IS-7 Incident that remains unsettled.\"\nCourtney:\nThere is no need to investigate any further.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAre you saying that there is nothing left for us to investigate?\nCourtney:\nWe have already exhausted all ends in regards to the evidence. This court will accept no further deliberations. I shall now deliver my verdict for the defendant, Katherine Hall. I hereby pronounce you...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold it! There is still a need for further investigation!\nCourtney:\nIf you wish to halt my verdict, please do so with evidence. That is, if there is any evidence that requires further deliberation...\nPresent Liquid Analysis Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is still one piece of evidence from the IS-7 Incident that remains unsettled.\"\nEdgeworth:\n(I cannot allow this case to end here. There is still something that needs to be cleared up! Looks like I'll have to show Judge Courtney something to convince her...!)\nEdgeworth:\nThere is still one piece of evidence from the IS-7 Incident that remains unsettled. ...Take a look at this.\nCourtney:\nThis is...?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the forensic results from the Gemini Sculpture that melted in the Winter Palace. According to the results of the analysis, traces of someone's blood were found. Who does this blood belong to...? Until we know the answer, this case is still open!\nCourtney:\nThere was blood mixed in with the remains of the Gemini Sculpture...? I heard nothing of this from Sebastian!\nEdgeworth:\nThis was a report from Detective Gumshoe. ...I had planned to tell Mr. Debeste myself.\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nHmph... So even though you had no investigate authority, you still did as you please. I shall report everything that transpired today to the P.I.C.\nEdgeworth:\nI will not avert my eyes from the truth, nor shall I overlook the mistakes of the past.\nCourtney:\n.....\nEdgeworth:\nIf you wish to report my actions to the P.I.C., be my guest. But in exchange, I want you to let me investigate this case to the very end.\nCourtney:\n...It is not my place to decide such things. I must ask that you check with Sebastian regarding this matter.\nDebeste:\nHeeey! Good news, you guys! Thanks to our early detection, Mr. Gustavia's life was saved.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nRay:\nMr. Gustavia...!\nKay:\nSo... he's alive...\nGustavia:\nWould you be the ones... who saved my life?\nRay:\n...Hey, Mr. Gustavia.\nGustavia:\nHmm? You are... Sir Assistant, are you not!? You've grown so big! This time... this one is your assistant, then?\nEdgeworth:\n! No. I'm...\nRay:\nHe he he. He's an assistant candidate. And Gregory Edgeworth's son.\nEdgeworth:\n...I am Miles Edgeworth, a prosecutor.\nGustavia:\nNnph. What a twist of fate...! I am in your debt! It is thanks to you that I have completely recovered.\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... There's no need for thanks. Since you're alive, we can reach the truth behind the incident 18 years ago.\nGustavia:\nHmm...? What do you speak of?\nRay:\nWhile you were unconscious, the truth has started to come to light. You may be Isaac Dover's murderer.\nGustavia:\n!\nDebeste:\nWhaaat!? Really?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Hall was looking for the criminal behind the events of 18 years ago. That's why... she set up the poison gas in the Pisces case.\nGustavia:\n.....\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Gustavia. The events of the incident 18 years ago... Tell us what really happened.\nGustavia:\n........\nEdgeworth:\n...So you wish to remain silent?\nRay:\nNah. I think he's just meditating.\nKay:\nHe can sleep standing up? What a useful skill to have!\nEdgeworth:\n(Meditation is different from sleeping, though...)\nRay:\nMr. Gustavia! Please tell us what you did 18 years ago!\nGustavia:\n.....Nnph. Nwahahahahaha! I'm the criminal because I fell for the trap...? That's not a very funny joke! I'm a victim, not a culprit!\nCourtney:\nMr. Gustavia. It has not yet been made clear whether or not you are the criminal. This is only their baseless speculation. Do not concern yourself with the drivel of a prosecutor without jurisdiction.\nGustavia:\nNnph...! At least there is one person here who understands.\nCourtney:\nMy name is Justine Courtney. I am a judge. If you would like, I would be happy to assist you. Let us show Prosecutor Edgeworth the truth of 18 years ago.\nGustavia:\nNnph... Understood. I shall prove my innocence to you, Sir Prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney... Is that your answer? Do you intend to bury the truth of the IS-7 Incident before it can be brought to light!?\nCourtney:\n...I merely believe in the judgement of the Goddess of Law.\nEdgeworth:\nUltimately, those who render judgement are only human. As long as humans control the law, there is no guarantee that every verdict is correct. If you are going to help conceal the truth... I will not hold back!\nCourtney:\nHmhm... I'm looking forward to it.\nGustavia:\nLady Justine. What should I do now?\nCourtney:\nYou are being suspected because you set off the poison gas. Can you tell us the reason... ...why you opened the Pisces case?\nGustavia:\nUnderstood. I came to see Sir Dover's works from 18 years ago. However, I accidentally entered the museum a half hour before it opened.\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Hall. There was nobody at the entrance, correct?\nKate:\nSince I thought the criminal from 18 years ago might be coming... ...I had no security guards in place. I didn't even lock the doors. I was very busy with opening preparations, so there was nobody on the first floor. In addition... I locked every place door aside from the Autumn one.\nEdgeworth:\n...I see. (This must have been done in order to lure the criminal to the Autumn Palace... Which is why he ended up entering the Autumn Palace.)\nKay:\nIt's already suspicious that he snuck into the museum in the first place.\nCourtney:\nThe gallery should remain silent. Unless you have evidence that can prove his testimony false, I will not allow any objections.\nKay:\nG-Gallery!? This isn't even a courtroom...\nCourtney:\nNow then... why did you open the Pisces case?\nGustavia:\nI wished to view Sir Dover's handiwork up close. The Gemini Sculpture... No, it was actually the Pisces, wasn't it? The lid had been frozen shut, so I borrowed a burner to open it... ...but as soon as I opened the lid, poison gas began pouring out.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's quite a... convenient testimony.\nKay:\nIt sounds like a total lie, doesn't it...?\nCourtney:\nThere are parts of Mr. Gustavia's testimony that I have issues with, as well. However... there is no evidence to disprove it.\nKay:\nB-But that's...!\nGustavia:\nWould it not make sense for suspicion to fall on Lady Katherine before myself? She may have intended to release the poison gas haphazardly.\nRay:\nRay:\nKate turned on the sprinklers as soon as the gas was released. She was specifically targeting the person who triggered the trap. ...Mr. Gustavia. You were her only target.\nGustavia:\nYou... You are willing to accept the words of this criminal as the truth?\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Hall must atone for her crimes. However... the same can be said for the criminal from 18 years ago.\nGustavia:\nSir Prosecutor, it seems you wish to suspect me to the bitter end. However, I had no reason to murder Sir Dover. If there is no evidence to suggest that I killed him, you cannot suspect me!\nEdgeworth:\nUgh...!\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth. Can't you prove that Mr. Gustavia is the criminal?\nEdgeworth:\nAll we know for sure is that Mr. Gustavia fell victim to the poison gas... No matter how strange his behavior was, it won't prove he committed the murder.\nKay:\nBut that's...! Mr. Shields, is there nothing we can do?\nRay:\nWell... if there isn't any evidence, we should try reorganizing the facts. If Mr. Gustavia was the one who killed Mr. Dover, there must have been a motive.\nEdgeworth:\nMotive (Motive for the murder - Gustavia claims he has no motive to murder Dover...)... Mr. Gustavia himself is denying that such a motive exists.\nRay:\n...It's not easy to take another person's life. 18 years ago, your old man also discussed motive with Prosecutor von Karma...\nGregory:\nYou claim their collaboration is irrelevant? If Mr. Gustavia and Mr. Dover's relationship had turned sour (Partnership turned sour - Gustavia helped Dover with his finals dessert, but Dover didn't help.)... ...it could serve as a motive for murder!\nRay:\nWe couldn't talk with Mr. Gustavia 18 years ago... but this time things are different. If we connect everything we've learned so far, the truth might be revealed...\nEdgeworth:\nYes... I suppose so. (It seems I must re-examine the information from 18 years ago. I must recall all the details that have remained unexplained!)\nBadd:\nSo... The gloved fingermarks on the picture frame... Was your doing?\nEdgeworth:\n(Delicia denied leaving the fingermarks on the frame. If they were left by Mr. Gustavia... ...he may have been trying to view the Angel's Recipe (Was Angel's Recipe his goal? - Was Gustavia's goal to view the Angel's Recipe?).)\nKate:\nMonsieur Master asked me to change the film in the camera. It seemed the film he prepared in advance wasn't enough...\nGregory:\nThere wasn't enough film?\nKate:\nIt seems the number of photos he took didn't match up with the amount of film remaining (Remaining film - The amount of film in the camera decreased. Did someone use it?). Well... He told me himself it might have been just a mistake, though.\nEdgeworth:\n(The information my father collected 18 years ago was certainly not for naught... If there is no evidence, then I shall use logic to reveal the truth!)\nConnect \"Motive for the murder\" and \"Partnership turned sour\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Mr. Gustavia.\"\nEdgeworth:\n...Mr. Gustavia. You collaborated with the victim, Isaac Dover, to create your desserts, didn't you?\nGustavia:\nOh...? It seems you know about my secret.\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Shields told me about it. Mr. Dover handled the design, while you were in charge of the taste. Is that correct?\nGustavia:\nNgh... Back then my training had been insufficient.\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems you worked together through the semifinals, but not during the finals. Why is that?\nGustavia:\nWe both wished to compete in the finals against Sir Master on our own merits...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYou must have also helped with Isaac Dover's dessert even during the finals!\nGustavia:\nNnph... What makes you able to declare something like that?\nEdgeworth:\nDidn't you tell Prosecutor von Karma about it yourself, 18 years ago? ...That you \"cooperated until the day before the finals\"?\nGregory:\nThe sculptures in Mr. Dover's room were all made out of sherbet. ...Such an amount would most likely need to be left overnight to freeze. Which means Mr. Gustavia prepared Mr. Dover's sherbet in advance the day before!\nvon Karma:\n......Hmph. That's right. So you realize Gustavia's cooperation ended the day before the finals.\nGregory:\nThen, why did Mr. Dover not help Mr. Gustavia in return?\nvon Karma:\nvon Karma:\n...The views of the dead are of no concern to me.\nEdgeworth:\nWhy did Isaac Dover not help you in return?\nGustavia:\nNgh...\nEdgeworth:\nIf there is a reason why your partnership with Isaac Dover broke down... ...that would be a motive for murder!\nGustavia:\nMmmmph...! That could be a possibility. However! Sir Dover and I ended our partnership peacefully!\nKay:\nA peaceful breakup? ...That's hard to imagine.\nGustavia:\nNot to mention, it's absurd to think that I killed Sir Dover in Sir Master's room! I couldn't have killed Sir Dover (Timing of Dover's murder - Gustavia could not have murdered Dover while Master was in the room.) while Sir Master was also there, making his desserts. In other words, there is no way I could have committed the murder.\nEdgeworth:\n(...That's not true. If there was a moment when Mr. Master was absent from the room... ...I could prove that it was possible for Mr. Gustavia to commit the murder!)\nConnect \"Remaining film\" and \"Was Angel's Recipe his goal?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"If he had photographed the contents of the Angel's Recipe, he wouldn't need to steal it.\"\nEdgeworth:\nIf he had photographed the contents of the Angel's Recipe, he wouldn't need to steal it. Perhaps Mr. Gustavia used Mr. Master's camera to take the pictures.\nKay:\nIf he had stolen the actual recipe book, the police would've found out!\nRay:\nI see... Pictures, eh?\nEdgeworth:\nThe problem is the time at which he entered Mr. Master's room...\nRay:\n...Mr. Gustavia could've moved around freely during the afternoon tea, right? Because it seems both him and Mr. Dover did not participate in the afternoon tea (Afternoon tea - Dover and Gustavia did not participate in the afternoon tea.).\nEdgeworth:\n(If I remember correctly, the only time we can prove that Dover was still alive is...)\nvon Karma:\nThe victim was not seen, as he stayed locked up in his room after the contest had begun. The only one who could have unlocked the locked rooms was Jeff Master.\nGregory:\nWere Master's desserts all that you ate?\nDelicia:\n...Actually, no. After the afternoon tea, I also ate Icy's desserts...\nEdgeworth:\n(After the contest began, Isaac Dover was locked up in his room. If we assume he was killed at some point before Delicia snuck into his room... ...then there is a high chance that he was killed before the afternoon tea was over.)\nConnect \"Afternoon tea\" and \"Timing of Dover's murder\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"(Isaac Dover was alive up until the afternoon tea began.)\"\nEdgeworth:\n(Isaac Dover was alive up until the afternoon tea began. Ergo, that is the only time when Gustavia could have killed Dover.)\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. Are you satisfied?\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... Sorry, but I am far from satisfied. Because I am finally starting to see... the truth behind this case!\nCourtney:\nAre you saying you have found some evidence to show us that truth?\nEdgeworth:\nNo... There is no need to present my evidence. Since we can just have Mr. Gustavia tell us the truth.\nKay:\nAh! So this is where you use \"that\", right!?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. ...Mr. Gustavia, there is one thing I want you to tell me.\nGustavia:\n........................\nEdgeworth:\nI said... Mr. Gustavia, there is one thing I want you to tell me!\nGustavia:\nNnghhoooh! Wh-What is it!?\nEdgeworth:\nDuring the finals of the contest, you made your desserts on your own.\nGustavia:\nI wanted to compete for the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef on my own merits.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIf that was truly the case, you would have competed on your own merits from the start. I want you to tell me why it was necessary for you to cooperate with Isaac Dover.\nEdgeworth:\nDuring the contest 18 years ago, Mr. Gustavia collaborated with Mr. Dover. I wonder... What made them decide to cooperate in the first place? That's what I need to draw out from him, but...\nGustavia:\n......\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... It seems he pretends to meditate when things aren't going his way...) First, I'll ask about why he collaborated with Mr. Dover. The truth has been hidden for 18 years... That ends today!\nBegin Logic Chess\nWhy did you collaborate with Mr. Dover?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Why did you decide to collaborate with Isaac Dover?\"\nEdgeworth:\nWhy did you decide to collaborate with Isaac Dover?\nGustavia:\nSir Dover and I were already acquaintances, even before the contest began. Since he was interested in the contest, we simply decided to enter it together.\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... Joining forces with a sculptor. You weren't confident in your own abilities?\nGustavia:\nNnph...! You know nothing about me! We wanted to make great works together!\nYou couldn't make it on your own?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI will reveal all your lies for what they are.\nGustavia:\n...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.\nEdgeworth:\n(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!\nLeads back to first\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"......\"\nEdgeworth:\n......\nGustavia:\nSir Dover's son and my own attended the same elementary school. We all got along well from the start.\nEdgeworth:\nReally? So were you going to share the title of World's Greatest Pastry Chef together?\nGustavia:\nNnph...... ......\nWake up!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Heh... as expected, he pretends to meditate when things aren't going his way.\"\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n.......\nGustavia:\nNnph... my condition may be worsening.

I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!\nLeads back to first\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... as expected, he pretends to meditate when things aren't going his way. Mr. Dover was a sculptor... I doubt he had any interest in the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef. In that case, where did his true goal lie?\n1 PIECE BROKEN\nGustavia:\nNn... Nnph...! Indeed... my goal was the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef. However, Sir Dover's goal was the grand prize, the Angel's Recipe.\nEdgeworth:\nI see. You cooperated because your interests were aligned. But there must have been a reason why your partnership soured.\nGustavia:\n...Sir Prosecutor, I am the victim of a poisoning. If you're going to suspect me in this manner... Perhaps I'd better return to the infirmary!\nEdgeworth:\nW-Wait a moment!\nGustavia:\nIn that case, you should end things soon. ...I am not a patient man.\nEdgeworth:\n...It seems he's trying to leave. I can't let that happen. He's still hiding something. Next, I should ask him about his true goal. I need to keep the pressure on him, while being cautious of the time!\nDid you want to appear on Piece of Cake?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDid you want to appear on Mr. Master's TV show?\nGustavia:\nNnph... I believe it was called \"Shake and Bake\", was it not?\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm pretty sure it's called \"Piece of Cake\"...)\nGustavia:\nWould you really want to see me dance about while I make desserts?\nEdgeworth:\nNo... That probably wouldn't be too popular with the kids either.\nGustavia:\nNnph...! Exactly. I know my limitations! I have no interest in that kind of theatrical tomfoolery! Sir Prosecutor... You should think about who you're talking to before asking questions!\nEdgeworth:\nGah... I understand. (I should refrain from making unnecessary statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!\nLeads back to first\nDid you have another goal besides the title?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Didn't you have another goal besides the title?\"\nEdgeworth:\nDidn't you have another goal besides the title? The title alone doesn't seem to have much value.\nGustavia:\nNnnnpphh...! How dare the likes of you insult the title of a confectionery artist! My only goal was the \"title\" itself! I had no interest in anything else! My dream was to become the world's greatest pastry chef!\nIt would be impossible with your skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI will reveal all your lies for what they are.\nGustavia:\n...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.\nEdgeworth:\n(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.)

At the time, I also studied Mr. Master's works. I would often watch his show with my son.\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you were studying Mr. Master's work to improve your own skills. If you had his recipes, perhaps it would've been easier for you to become the world's greatest.\nGustavia:\nNnph... Perhaps. To a pastry chef, Sir Master's recipes were worth their weight in gold... ......\nYou were interested in his recipes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Heh...

The recipes of the world's greatest pastry chef... I would be lying if I said that I wasn't interested...! However... I wouldn't think that simply being interested would be a problem!\nEdgeworth:\n...I wonder about that. (The Angel's Recipe's true nature was not for making desserts, but cures. And all of the contest participants should have been aware of that...)\nGustavia:\n...Nnggrrrrrr...\nEdgeworth:\nLooks like I'm getting close. He isn't meditating any more. Now to slowly but surely drive him into a corner. Next, I'll ask what he planned to use the recipe book for!\nDid you know the recipe book's value?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe Angel's Recipe... Did you know its true value?\nGustavia:\nSilly question! It contained Sir Master's best dessert recipes... Any pastry chef worth their salt would want it!\n\n\n\nBefore obtaining clue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. ...Maybe I should try another line of attack.\nLeads back to first\n\n\n\n\nAfter obtaining clue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Looks like that clue will come in handy.\"\nDid you intend to make desserts with it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you intend to win the Angel's Recipe and use it to make desserts?\nGustavia:\nOf course. If I obtained the Angel's Recipe, I was going to use it in my training!\nEdgeworth:\nI hear the Angel's Recipe was worth a lot of money.\nGustavia:\nNnph..... I don't know the exact details, but... ...that recipe book was much too valuable to be sold. ......\n\n\n\nYou seem to know a lot about the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You seem to know quite a lot about the Angel's Recipe.\"\n\n\n\n\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n.......\nGustavia:\nNnph... my condition may be worsening.

It was explained to all the contest participants at the beginning of the contest.\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... In that case, you must know about the recipe's true nature. That it was not a recipe book for desserts at all!\nGustavia:\nNnnnnngghh! Impressive, Sir Prosecutor... So you know the true nature of the Angel's Recipe. The Angel's Recipe... Some have called it the \"Ultimate Recipe Book.\" It contained formulas for new medicines that were not yet on the market!\nEdgeworth:\nHe knew the recipes were actually formulas for new medicines. This could be a useful clue.\nLeads back to first\nDid you intend to make desserts with it? (after clearing this option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI've run this line of questioning to its conclusion...

Yes... my goal was more than just the title of the World's Greatest Pastry Chef! At the time, my son was ill... I needed the recipe for the medicine!\nEdgeworth:\nYour son was ill...? Tell me more about that.\nGustavia:\n.....To protect my son's honor, I can say no more.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm. Judging by the worried look on his face, I must have struck a nerve.) Next, I need him to tell me more about his son's illness. This is it! This will be my final move of the game!\nWhat was the name of the illness?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was the name of your son's illness?\nGustavia:\nNnph... Sir Prosecutor. How insensitive of you! My son was seriously ill! I will not be discussing this with likes of you!\n\n\n\nBefore obtaining clue from \"What was your son like?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. ...Maybe I should try another line of attack.\nLeads back to first\n\n\n\n\nAfter obtaining clue from \"What was your son like?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Looks like that clue will come in handy.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLooks like that clue will come in handy.\n\n\n\nBut the illness wasn't life-threatening!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You told me your son's illness was not life-threatening.\"\n\n\n\n\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n.......\nGustavia:\nNnph... my condition may be worsening.

I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!\nLeads back to first\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou told me your son's illness was not life-threatening. Is there really a need to be so secretive about it?\nGustavia:\n...... It was enough to keep him from living a normal life...\nEdgeworth:\nThat... must have been difficult for your son.\nGustavia:\nI tried everything I could to cure his illness... It wasn't fair for the poor boy. He could never taste the desserts he loved so much... ......\n\n\n\nWas it a taste disorder?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The Angel's Recipe contains a cure for a certain illness.\"\n\n\n\n\nWas he too fat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI will reveal all your lies for what they are.\nGustavia:\n......

I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!\nLeads back to first\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe Angel's Recipe contains a cure for a certain illness. A remedy that could also cure Mr. Master's \"taste disorder.\"\nGustavia:\n! What...! He had it too!?\nEdgeworth:\nHe had it \"too\"... I see... So your son suffers from a taste disorder?\nGustavia:\nNnghoo! I didn't think you'd figure it out so quickly!\nEdgeworth:\nIn order to cure your son's taste disorder, you needed the recipe book... Wasn't that your true goal?\nGustavia:\n...... Nnph. It is as you say.\nEdgeworth:\nBased on how he's acted up until now, it appears he is still hiding something.\n\n\n\nBefore obtaining clue from \"Did the recipe book have the only cure?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning. ...Maybe I should try another line of attack.\nLeads back to first\n\n\n\n\nAfter obtaining clue from \"Did the recipe book have the only cure?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Looks like that clue will come in handy.\"\nWhat was your son like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat kind of person was your son?\nGustavia:\nAh! My boy! He loved the desserts I made!\nEdgeworth:\nDid you enter the contest solely for your son?\nGustavia:\nSir Prosecutor, you could never understand! The feelings a father has for his son! I wanted nothing more than to cure my boy's illness!\n\n\n\nI doubt that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI will reveal all your lies for what they are.\nGustavia:\n...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.\nEdgeworth:\n(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.)

Wouldn't he get in your way? I doubt you had time to care for your son while you were challenging Mr. Master!\nGustavia:\n...That may be so... but I wanted to grant my son's wish. He said he always wanted to be the first to eat my desserts...\n\n\n\nYour son sounds pretty healthy to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"About your son...\"\n\n\n\n\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n.......\nGustavia:\nNnph... my condition may be worsening.

If he was so sick, wouldn't it be difficult for him to come and play with you?\nGustavia:\nNnph...! My son's illness... it wasn't life-threatening...\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... That might serve as a clue.)\nLeads back to first\nWhat was your son like? (after clearing this option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.\nLeads back to first\nDid the recipe book have the only cure?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDid the Angel's Recipe have the only cure?\nGustavia:\n...Yes. Though the medicine is being sold everywhere now. At the time, the recipe book was my one and only option. That's why I continued making my desserts, without joining the others for tea time.\nEdgeworth:\nSo you weren't interested in what Mr. Master was making? You sure seemed confident in your chances of winning.\nGustavia:\n.....I couldn't be bothered to pay attention to the other contestants' desserts...\n\n\n\nYou had interest in Mr. Master's works!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You just said earlier that you studied Mr. Master's works.\"\n\n\n\n\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n.......\nGustavia:\nNnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.\nEdgeworth:\nW... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!\nLeads back to first\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou just said earlier that you studied Mr. Master's works. In addition, if your goal was to win the contest in order to get the medicine formula... ...you must have been curious about the other contestants' entries as well!\nGustavia:\n...Nn... Nmmph. There was time to sample the other desserts during the contest, but... ...none of their entries... had any flavor, so I didn't want to eat any of it. I suspect... I may have been a bit nervous as well.\nEdgeworth:\n(So everything he ate tasted flavorless... This could be a useful clue.)\nLeads back to first\nDid the recipe book have the only cure? (after clearing this option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI've run this line of questioning to its conclusion... Let's try another line of attack.\nLeads back to first\nEdgeworth:\nLooks like that clue will come in handy.\nDidn't you also have the illness?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Being unable to taste anything, regardless of what you eat... Such a bitter illness.\"\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n.......\nGustavia:\nNnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.\nEdgeworth:\nW... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!\nLeads back to first\nEdgeworth:\nBeing unable to taste anything, regardless of what you eat... Such a bitter illness. That reminds me... didn't you say something similar earlier? \"None of their entries had any flavor, so I didn't feel like eating any of it\", wasn't it? Perhaps, your son wasn't the only one who suffered from a taste disorder.\nGustavia:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's hard to imagine being a successful pastry chef without a sense of taste. Perhaps what you really wanted was to cure yourself?\nGustavia:\nNnngghh... That's completely ludicrous... 18 years ago, I made those desserts all by myself...!\nYou must have worked hard then!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI will reveal all your lies for what they are.\nGustavia:\n...... Nnph... is that all? You bore me with your empty threats, Sir Prosecutor.\nEdgeworth:\n(Gah... I need to be careful not to make careless statements.) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!\nLeads back to first\nDidn't you collaborate with Mr. Dover!?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Heh... it sees you've caught yourself in a contradiction.\"\nWait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n.......\nGustavia:\nNnph... my condition may be worsening. I should get back to the infirmary.\nEdgeworth:\nW... Wait! (I was too passive there...) I must read my opponent's reactions and emotions, and strike with the right words!\nLeads back to first\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... it sees you've caught yourself in a contradiction. Didn't you cooperate with Isaac Dover in the contest!? You can hardly say you made the desserts \"all by yourself\"!\n1 PIECE BROKEN\nGustavia:\nNngh... NNGUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH!\nEdgeworth:\nYou must take great pride in your abilities as a pastry chef. But to betray your pride and cooperate with another contestant... ...you did it all to cure your own disease!\nGustavia:\n...Well done, Sir Prosecutor. It's as you say... The one with the taste disorder is not my son... ...It is I. No one knew... I've kept it a secret for 18 years...!\nEdgeworth:\nIt doesn't matter how long a secret is kept. If you lie before me, I will expose it. Dane Gustavia and Isaac Dover were both trying to obtain the recipes for the new medicines. Gustavia to cure his condition, and Dover most likely to sell the recipe book for money... For this reason, they entered the contest as a collaborative effort. And with that... Checkmate.\nLogic Chess Complete\nGustavia:\nNnnnnnnnngh...! I have never told this to anyone... Well done. As you say, I developed a taste disorder 18 years ago.\nKay:\nTaste disorder...?\nGustavia:\nIt was a severe disorder. I was unable to discern any flavor at all... It's the one illness a pastry chef dreads above all.\nEdgeworth:\nThose symptoms sound a bit different from Mr. Master's taste disorder...\nRay:\nMr. Master's condition is known as \"hypoguesia.\" It simply causes a decreased sensitivity to certain specific flavors.\nGustavia:\nI'm sure it has caused Sir Master much pain too. After all, no medication was available to cure it 18 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\nIn order to cure your taste disorder, you would need Mr. Master's Angel's Recipe... ...and that's why you entered the contest, am I correct?\nGustavia:\nThat was one of my goals, but I still had my sights set on the title of World's Greatest. When it comes to making desserts, I won't lose to anyone! Even without the ability to taste, I still have the utmost confidence in my flavors!\nEdgeworth:\nOh? So, I presume you also prepared your dessert in the finals with the intent to win?\nGustavia:\nNnph... That goes without saying.\nEdgeworth:\n(According to what Mr. Shields told us earlier, the evaluation of Mr. Gustavia's entry was...)\nMaster:\nUp until the semifinals, Mr. Gustavia's flavors and design were to my liking... Unfortunately, both the taste and appearance of his finals entry left much to be desired.\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems the dessert you made for the finals was not rated highly in regards to flavor.\nGustavia:\nNmmmph..............\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Gustavia! You will tell us about how you made your dessert during the finals.\nGustavia:\n...Very well...! It seems I must teach you upstarts a lesson!\n-- Dessert for the Finals --\nGustavia:\nSir Dover and I cooperated until the finals. I handled the flavor, he was in charge of the design.\nHowever, for the finals, I wanted to challenge Sir Master with my own skills.\nI helped Sir Dover make his entry, but I made mine completely on my own.\nIf the flavor of my entry wasn't good enough, my own lack of training was to blame.\nGustavia:\nHow about that, Sir Prosecutor. This is the truth of 18 years ago!\nEdgeworth:\nNgh... I can't find any contradictions in his testimony...!\nRay:\nWell, of course he isn't going to fess up that easily. This gun's been on the run for 18 years, after all. Guess we'll just have to keep on pressing him until he breaks, eh?\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So Mr. Dover took care of the design, while you handled the flavor... Gustavia: Sir Dover was a sculptor by tade. His sense of design was splendid. But he was just an amateur chef. We combined out strengths by working together. Ray: He he heh. You never did have much design sense, did you, Mr. Gustavia? Gustavia: Nnph.....! ...What do you think of this? Edgeworth: Hm... That's the symbol of Zheng Fa...! Kay: Wow! A phoenix! That is really good! Ray: Woah! You really improved these past 18 years! Gustavia: Nwahahahahahaha! Behold the fruits of my 18 years of training! I've put my life and limb on the line for my dessert skills! It's true that I cooperated with Sir Dover 18 years ago, up until the finals...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you were really serious about the title of World's Greatest Pastry Chef? Gustavia: Yes. Confectionery is my life... Naturally, I wanted to be the World's Greatest. ...But back then I was still inexperienced, and I was no match for the better chef. Edgeworth: But your goal was also to obtain the Angel's Recipe, right? Wouldn't the recipe book be worth more to you than the title? Gustavia: Nmph......... Courtney: Courtney: I will not stand by and watch badger a convalescent man like this... My gavel shall protect you, Mr. Gustavia. Edgeworth: Gah... I realize he's still recuperating, but...! Courtney: Mr. Gustavia, do not yield to this devilish prosecutor! Now then, please continue with your testimony.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you helped Mr. Dover with his dessert, but made yours all by yourself...? No matter how you look at it, this seems odd. Why didn't Mr. Dover assist you? Gustavia: It matters not how it seems, it's the truth. I do not know what Sir Dover was thinking. Ray: It's hard to prove if someone is lying about something that happened 18 years ago. Hey, Kay, does your secret weapon also work as a lie detector? Kay: If it did, I'd have already stolen Mr. Edgeworth's spotlight! Edgeworth: ...There's no need for that, I will expose this man's lies myself. Dane Gustavia. Please continue with your testimony.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Up until the finals, I heard that you received high praise for the flavor of your desserts. Was there some sort of accident during the finals? Gustavia: Nmph... Nothing of the sort. I simply... was unable to taste my work due to my taste disorder. My intuition must have been off. That's all. Edgeworth: Then, was your intuition fine while making Mr. Dover's entry? How could there be such a huge difference between the finals and the previous day? Gustavia: Nnngghh.................... Kay: Hmmm... We're not getting anywhere at this rate. Edgeworth: (Should I change the topic...?) Ask about the semifinals Edgeworth: So, you're sure there wasn't anything different between the semifinals and the finals? Gustavia: Yes... That's right... Add statement: \"Aside from not cooperating with Sir Dover, the finals weren't much different from the semifinals.\" Ask about Mr. Dover Edgeworth: You knew Mr. Dover before you entered the contest, right? Gustavia: Yes... I knew him well... Add statement: \"Sir Dover's son and my own attended the same elementary school.\" Don't change the topic Edgeworth: (I don't think there's any reason to change the topic.) Edgeworth: So, you're sure there wasn't anything different between the semifinals and the finals? Gustavia: Yes... That's right...

Gustavia: I may have lacked design sense, but I was confident in the flavor. Apart from the design, there were no major differences between my finals and semifinals entries. Ray: Huh? That sure is strange. That's not how Uncle Ray remembers it. I'm pretty sure both the look and taste of your finals dessert scored poorly. Kay: Then, there's no way he would have won the contest. Edgeworth: (Even the flavor, which he was so confident about, failed to materialize during the finals. Something must have changed besides Mr. Dover's cooperation, but what...?)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Then, it wasn't a coincidence that you both participated in the contest? Gustavia: I heard about the contest, so I made the suggestion to Sir Dover. He always wanted money for his sculpting business. Edgeworth: (If I recall... Mr. Dover was a greedy man who was always after more money.) Kay: Oooh, so the Angel's Recipe is really worth that much...? Ray: Kay, the recipe book was certainly valuable 18 years ago. But nowadays, most of the medicines it contains are availavle commercially. Kay: Awww... That's a shame. Edgeworth: (In the end, it seems that each of the contestants had the Angel's Recipe as their goal...)\nEdgeworth: (All those unanswered questions 18 years ago...

He hasn't even been taught Home Economics!\nEdgeworth:\n(I guess it'd be impossible...)\nGustavia:\nI'll ask you once more.\nLeads back to:\n\"What else could my elementary school son have done, besides cheer me on?\"\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sure your elementary school son would have remembered the taste of your desserts.\nGustavia:\nOf course! My son always loved my desserts.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, he would have been able to taste test your desserts in your place.\nGustavia:\nNngh... Wh-What did you say...?\nEdgeworth:\nEarlier, you told us that you have a taste disorder...\nGustavia:\nNnnnnnnnngh...! I've never told this to anyone... Well done. As you say, I developed a taste disorder 18 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\nNo one else knew about your taste disorder. If Mr. Dover had found out, he would have ended your partnership. After all, you were in charge of the flavor.\nGustavia:\n.........................................\nEdgeworth:\nYour son didn't just cheer you on! He also helped you determine if your desserts tasted correct!\nGustavia:\nNngh... Nnguoooooooh!\nRay:\nAh, I see... Mr. Dover's dessert was made the day before, so it still tasted good.\nGustavia:\nNwahahahaha!\nRay:\n!\nEdgeworth:\n.....\nGustavia:\nWhat are you saying is quite amusing, Sir Prosecutor! You say that my elementary school son assisted me as a taste tester!? ...You are insulting my pride.\nEdgeworth:\nYour pride...?\nGustavia:\nIt's true, I had no sense of design 18 years ago. However, I won't lose to anyone when it comes to flavor! You claim I would cast aside my pride and rely on my son...? Don't get carried away with your foolish conjecture... you upstart.\nEdgeworth:\nNgh... In that case, I'm sure your son can confirm if my theory is mere conjecture!\nGustavia:\nNwahahaha! Unfortunately for you... I no longer have a son!\nEdgeworth:\nWh... What!?\nGustavia:\nAfter my taste disorder was cured, I went to train in Zheng Fa immediately. ...During that time, I severed all ties with my son!\nKay:\nWhaaaaaaat!?\nEdgeworth:\nDon't tell me...! You would even abandon your own son!?\nRay:\nThat's not all... Even today, the whereabouts of his son are still unknown. The police have been searching, but they haven't been able to find any traces of him.\nGustavia:\n...You wish to confirm your theory? I welcome you to try. Nwahahahahaha! Desserts are the only things that are important to me! After regaining my sense of taste, my son no longer mattered!\nCourtney:\n...Order in the court. Mr. Gustavia's actions are certainly inhumane. However... we are not here to judge whether or not he is a good father. Prosecutor Edgeworth. I believe this is your loss.\nGustavia:\nAfter all, there is no evidence left from 18 years ago that could prove your theories!\nEdgeworth:\nNgh...!\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! Is there nothing we can do! At this rate... we'll never find out the truth!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm.....! (Detective Gumshoe... Where are those results...!?)\nGumshoe:\nI wonder whose blood it could have been? I've asked forensics to look into it, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nRight. I leave it to you, Detective.\nEdgeworth:\n(I entrusted Detective Gumshoe with the last piece of evidence. If only I knew who that blood belonged to...!)\nRay:\nMiles... there's still one thing that's bothering Uncle Ray. Was Mr. Gustavia's only reason for coming to the art gallery to check on the body?\nEdgeworth:\n..... If he only wanted to confirm the body's presence, he wouldn't have needed to open the case.\nRay:\nThat's right... Is there a way we can prove this?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is one way. We just need that evidence from Detective Gumshoe...!\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. What are you talking about?\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth! Sorry to keep you waiting, siiir!\nCourtney:\n!\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... Just the person I was talking about. Detective Gumshoe. I trust you have the test results?\nGumshoe:\nOf course, sir! I just got the report back from the lab!\nCourtney:\nDetective... Please be silent. So, this is the evidence that Prosecutor Edgeworth was talking about...\nDebeste:\nHuh? Hey, what's this...? This is the first I've heard of it!\nGumshoe:\nErrrrm...\nEdgeworth:\nThis was a request from me. I asked him to investigate a certain piece of evidence.\nDebeste:\nWhy... Why is everyone always helping you out!? I'm the one in charge of the crime scene!\nEdgeworth:\n...Mr. Debeste. I apologize for taking matters into my own hands, but how about we hear his report first?\nDebeste:\n...Uh, sure...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. What were the results?\nGumshoe:\nHere's the report, sir! The traces of blood found in the Gemini Sculpture belong to... ...the victim of the poison gas, Dane Gustavia!\nGustavia:\n...What are you saying?\nEdgeworth:\n...Good work, Detective Gumshoe. As I thought... my theory was correct.\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! What do you mean?\nCourtney:\nWe, too, would like an explanation. What on earth does this blood prove!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis blood... is something the culprit of the IS-7 Incident tried to conceal.\nGustavia:\n! I-It can't be... That's...!\nEdgeworth:\n...This blood was found inside the glass case of the Gemini Sculpture. In other words, your blood was found alongside Mr. Dover's body!\nGustavia:\nNgh... NGUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHH!\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nWh... Why would Mr. Gustavia's blood be in a place like that!?\nGustavia:\n........\nEdgeworth:\nIf you intend to remain silent, then I'll reveal the truth myself. In the Gemini case, aside from the blood, we also found traces of salt and sugar.\nCourtney:\nSalt and blood...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd only one of Mr. Dover's sherbet desserts tasted salty.\nRay:\nCome to think of it... I remember Ms. Delicious saying the same thing 18 years ago.\nDelicia:\nOh yessie! His sherbet was most delicious!\nRay:\nReally? I wish I could have eaten some too.\nDelicia:\nBut there was one piece that was so salty I couldn't eat it.\nGregory:\nSalty...?\nDelicia:\nIt's right here in this photo. It was a part of that lyre.\nGregory:\nThat's the lyre from the Gemini constellation...\nEdgeworth:\nExactly... For some reason, salt bad been mixed into the lyre. No other traces of salt were found in Dover's room.\nCourtney:\nIn that case... Please explain. Where did the salt detected in the lyre come from?\nPresent Rock Salt Lamp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is...! The rock salt lamp used as the murder weapon in the IS-7 Incident...?\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis was the true nature of the salt!\nCourtney:\n...Presenting me with such absurd logic... You fill my eyes with salty tears!\nEdgeworth:\n(Mmph... I can almost feel the cold salty tears flowing down my cheeks as well...)\nCourtney:\nThis time, give us an explanation we can understand.\nLeads back to:\n\"Where did the salt detected in the lyre come from?\"\nCourtney:\nThis is...! The rock salt lamp used as the murder weapon in the IS-7 Incident...?\nEdgeworth:\nI believe part of this rock salt lamp was mixed in with the sherbet from the lyre. At the time of the murder, there were two rock salt lamps in Mr. Master's room. One of those lamps took Mr. Dover's life. We know that Mr. Dover's blood was left behind on the murderous lamp, however... ...there were no traces of anyone's blood found at the crime scene, Mr. Master's room.\nRay:\nBecause the killer disposed all of the desserts with traces of blood into the streams of water, right?\nEdgeworth:\nNo other traces of salt were found in Mr. Dover's room.\nGustavia:\nNnngh.....!\nRay:\nSpeaking of which... Weren't the two rock salt lamps found in Ms. Delicious' room also broken?\nGregory:\nIt looks like both the lamps in the pillars are broken.\nBadd:\nBoth of their light bulbs... are broken...\nRay:\nMaybe they were dropped on the floor.\nRay:\nWe never did figure out why the other rock salt lamp was broken... Maybe Mr. Gustavia's blood was on the other lamp!\nGustavia:\nNnnnngghh...\nEdgeworth:\nIf your blood was found on the lamps at the crime scene, you would have been suspected. As the culprit, you would have needed to conceal all traces of your blood from the police.\nCourtney:\nDon't tell me he concealed it in the sherbet lyre...?\nEdgeworth:\n...Exactly. The rock salt lamp and his blood were mixed into the sherbet lyre and hidden inside the glass case. Unlike the fountain's water, the sherbet desserts would not be analyzed right away. Perhaps he had planned to dispose of the sherbet when the opportunity presented itself?\nCourtney:\nTh-Then... the reason Mr. Gustavia came to this gallery...!\nEdgeworth:\n...18 years ago, the body and the evidence pointing to the killer were both stolen. Even the killer could not have anticipated that. There was no way of knowing when the body and the evidence would be discovered.\nRay:\nSo he planned to destroy the evidence before the Zodiac Art Gallery's grand opening.\nGustavia:\n....................\nEdgeworth:\nDane Gustavia... isn't it about time you confessed? You are the true culprit of the IS-7 Incident!\nGustavia:\nNn... Nnnngghh...\nKate:\nMonsieur Gustavia...! You're the reason Monsieur Master is...!\nGustavia:\nNWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\nEdgeworth:\n.....\nRay:\nMr. Gustavia...\nGustavia:\nCould it be...? After all this time my crime is finally brought to light! The prosecutors and defense attorneys 18 years ago never even came close. Bravo, bravo! Well done, Sir Prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\n...So you admit that you killed Mr. Dover?\nGustavia:\nNWAHAHAHAHAHA! It is true. I killed Isaac Dover! But, he had only himself to blame...!\nEdgeworth:\n...What do you mean?\nGustavia:\nDover and I worked together in order to win the contest. No matter who won, we agreed that we'd share the Angel's Recipe. But, on the day of the finals, he stabbed me in the back!\nGustavia:\nSir Dover! This isn't what we agreed to!\nDover:\nI'm sorry Gustavia. ...The deal is off.\nGustavia:\nWha...! But I made your desserts for you! I'm the reason you got this far!\nDover:\n...And what of it? Can you prove that you assisted me in any way?\nGustavia:\nDover, you...! You were planning to betray me all along...!\nGustavia:\nBecause of Dover's treachery, I was forced to make my finals entry on my own. It's just as Sir Prosecutor said, my son assisted me every day until the finals.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat about your \"pride\" as a confectionery artist?\nGustavia:\nA proud chef loses the ability to taste his own creations... That's a feeling an upstart like you would never understand! Mastering the art of dessert making is my reason for being! It is my one and only pride!\nEdgeworth:\nCommitting murder for the sake of pride. That's another feeling I will never understand. To say nothing of abandoning your own son... such a thought disgusts me.\nGustavia:\n...Before you judge me, first understand what happened 18 years ago. On the day of the finals, my son never came to assist me. Thinking back on it now, I suppose Dover had a hand in that as well.\nKay:\nHuh...? What exactly happened to your son?\nGustavia:\nI do not know. But it no longer matters. Ever since that day, my son meant nothing to me. From what I hear, he's still missing.\nKay:\nTh... That's awful! Giving up on him like that...!\nEdgeworth:\nWithout your son, you had no chance of winning... Correct?\nGustavia:\nYes. And since I was guaranteed to lose, I needed a fail-safe. During the afternoon tea time, I made my way to Sir Master's room... I just needed to take a photo of the cure to my taste disorder. It would have all worked out. ...If only Dover hadn't interfered!\nDover:\nAh, Gustavia... Trying to steal a picture of my prize are you? That hardly seems sporting...\nGustavia:\n...Y-You!\nDover:\n\"Cure for taste disorders\"...? Oho. You have... a taste disorder, don't you? Ah, this is rich! A pastry chef who can't taste!\nGustavia:\nDover! You...! Gaah...!\nDover:\nPuny worm... You are in no position to oppose me.\nGustavia:\n...Why you...!\nGustavia:\nWhen I attempted to hit Dover, he struck me and sent me flying. I crashed into one of the rock salt lamps, and that was when my blood stained on it.\nKay:\nSo Mr. Dover wasn't the first one to be injured...\nGustavia:\nTo conceal my blood, I shaved away part of the rock salt lamp and mixed it into the sherbet. After that, it became a part of the lyre sculpture!\nRay:\nSo... that's how you tried to erase your traces from the crime scene!\nGustavia:\n...Dover tried to blackmail me by using his knowledge of my taste disorder. If I didn't want it to become public, I was to pay him a large sum.\nEdgeworth:\nSo... that's the reason why you killed Isaac Dover!?\nGustavia:\nNwahahaha! Exactly! What reason do I have to let those who obstruct me live? He was the one who drew first blood. I simply gave him his just desserts.\nEdgeworth:\n(So that was his motive...)\nGustavia:\nI carried the rock salt lamp that bore my blood into Dover's room. Then I came up with a hiding place where it would not be easily found.\nRay:\n...I get it. That room contained plenty of tools for sculpting sherbet.\nGustavia:\nYour deduction was spot on, Sir Attorney. It was the ideal place to shave away the rock salt. I then proceeded to coat the surface of the sherbet lyre with vast amounts of the salty mixture.\nKate:\nBut why...? Why did you try to pin the crime on Monsieur Master!?\nGustavia:\nYou are wrong to blame me for that, Lady Katherine. If not for your unnecessary meddling, Sir Master would never have been a suspect.\nKate:\n.....!\nGustavia:\nWhy do you think I hid the murder weapon and fluorescent cloth in Lady Delicia's room?\nEdgeworth:\n...There is only one reason why you'd place a murder weapon in someone else's room. You wanted to pin the crime on Delicia.\nDelicia:\nEeeeeep! M-Me...?\nGustavia:\nYes... That is correct.\nDelicia:\nG-Gusty! Why... Why me?\nGustavia:\nAs one who sought to be the world's best confectioner, I greatly respected Sir Master. It was never my intention to cast suspicion on him. But, an insolent woman who dared to sully the contest with fake desserts... I had no problem letting someone like you take the blame for the crime!\nDelicia:\nTh-That's...! That makes me sad!\nGustavia:\nIf you hadn't snacked on other people's desserts, the body would never have been found. It was when Sir Master would be judging Lady Delicia's room... That's when I finally saw an opportunity to freeze the body, but... ...before I could move the body, Lady Katherine had already discovered it...!\nKate:\nWhy... did you need to freeze Monsieur Dover's body...?\nGustavia:\nWhy indeed...?\nKate:\nMonsieur Edgeworth... Please tell us! Why would Monsieur Gustavia have needed to freeze the body?\nTo disguise it as an ice sculpture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Gustavia froze the body in order to disguise it as an ice sculpture.\nKate:\nHuh...? R-Really...?\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! Ms. Hall looks like she's frozen solid!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I'm sorry. (It seems I was mistaken...)\nKate:\nMonsieur Edgeworth... Please tell us the truth this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Why would Monsieur Gustavia have needed to freeze the body?\"\nTo throw off the time of death\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Mr. Gustavia intended to freeze the body in order to throw off the time of death.\"\nTo create a fake crime scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe reason Mr. Gustavia froze the body... It was probably to create a fake crime scene.\nKate:\nErr... Fake crime scene?\nCourtney:\n.........\nKay:\nJudge Courtney's icy glare is so cold, I feel like I'm about to freeze!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... It seems I was mistaken...)\nKate:\nMonsieur Edgeworth... Please tell us the truth this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Why would Monsieur Gustavia have needed to freeze the body?\"\nEdgeworth:\n...Mr. Gustavia intended to freeze the body in order to throw off the time of death. If the time of death had coincided with the tea party, Mr. Gustavia would have been suspected.\nGustavia:\nNWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! That is correct. Preparations were necessary to freeze the body. While I was preparing in Dover's room... ...I placed the body in the treasure chest in Sir Master's room. I could think of no better hiding place at the time... ...but thanks to that gluttonous pharmacist, the lid of the chest broke!\nKay:\nBut why did you disguise him as an ice sculpture?\nEdgeworth:\nOnce the body was discovered, there would be no time to throw off the time of death. To buy time, you needed to hide it some place else.\nKate:\nHow horrid...! How could you hide Monsieur Dover's body within one of his own works!?\nGustavia:\nIt all would have worked out if the body hadn't been discovered while it was in Sir Master's room. If everything had gone according to plan, Sir Master would have been arrested.\nKate:\nSo... because I... discovered the body...? It's my fault Monsieur Master was...!\nRay:\nKate... don't take his words to heart. Even if suspicion hadn't fallen on Mr. Master, Ms. Delicious would have taken the fail. No matter who he targeted, the one at fault here... is Mr. Gustavia himself.\nGustavia:\n...The detective in charge of the initial investigation was also a dunce. To think that he never reported the missing body to the prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nProsecutor von Karma indicted Mr. Master without knowing the body had vanished...?\nRay:\nI see. That would explain why he looked so flustered at the crime scene. Although... It's something that would stand out if you read the official documents.\nEdgeworth:\n(Could someone have intentionally distorted the information...?) At any rate, Von Karma found out about the missing body after he had made his indictment. And if he had let one person be acquitted, he'd have a stain on his much-prided perfect record. That's why he concealed the fact that the body was hidden, and had Mr. Master declared guilty...!\nCourtney:\nWh-What are you saying...!?\nKay:\nFor 18 years, that man has taken the blame for your crimes... Don't you feel anything at all?\nGustavia:\nNwahahah... I don't care what you say.\nGumshoe:\nWhat a monster! I'm arresting him right here, right now, sir!\nCourtney:\n...I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that will be impossible.\nEdgeworth:\n.....!\nGustavia:\nNWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! So, you've figured it out! That's right... You have no right to sentence me!\nKay:\nW... WHAT!? But the culprit is standing right in front of us!\nGustavia:\nNWAHAHAHAHA! Allow me to tell you the reason why you can't arrest me!\n-- Why You Can't Arrest Me --\nGustavia:\nIt has been 18 years since I murdered Dover.\nThe statute of limitations for murder in this country is 15 years, is it not?\nIn other words, it's impossible for you to arrest me!\nI only confessed my crime because the statute of limitations had expired!\nKay:\nThe statue of limitations for murder... is 15 years...! Mr. Edgeworth... Is there nothing we can do?\nEdgeworth:\n...Ngh...! As long as the statute of limitations remains, arresting him is impossible...!\nKay:\nNo way...!\nCourtney:\n...My sincerest apologies, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Neither Mr. Gustavia's testimony nor your logic... can be taken as official legal proof. The verdict of the trial 18 years ago cannot be overturned.\nEdgeworth:\nWha...! What about the fact that Mr. Dover's body was hidden? Even if we can't arrest Mr. Gustavia, this should at least earn Mr. Master a retrial!\nCourtney:\nReally? I wonder about that. Overturning a verdict of the Goddess of Law... is much harder than you think.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is the P.I.C. trying to justify the verdict from 18 years ago...!?)\nGustavia:\nNwahahahahahahaha! How unfortunate, Sir Prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Is there nothing I can do!? Is there no way to continue pursuing Mr. Gustavia!?)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: No matter how many years have passed, your sin will never fade! Gustavia: Sir Prosecutor, I'm sure you must have realized by now... ...there's no way you can arrest me! Gumshoe: Arresting you would be a piece of cake for someone like Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't that right. sir!? Edgeworth: Uh... Hmm... I don't think it will be that simple. Gustavia: Nwahahahahaha! It's impossible for you to arrest me!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You trained in Zheng Fa...? Gustavia: After the incident 18 years ago, I left on a journey. I already decided to hone my candy crafting skills in Zheng Fa. Thanks to that... My design sense is incomparable to what it was in the past! Debeste: Woooooah! That's awesome! Gustavia: ...You may have it, if you'd like. Debeste: Oh! Sweet! Edgeworth: (So, he trained in Zheng Fa...?)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you weren't called as a witness by Prosecutor von Karma or my father? Gustavia: I had more important things to do than attend the trial. I was much too busy trying to master the art of desserts. Ray: Your old man did try to find him, but could never get hold of a contact address. Edgeworth: (...So he took the initiative, and left before he could be summoned to court.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: It's possible that some of your actions 18 years ago were not affected by the statute! Gustavia: Nwahaha... It's been so long, I've got nothing left to hide. Ask me anything you'd like. Edgeworth: ...Very well. Could you explain to me what you did during these past 18 years? Gustavia: Certainly. After the contest, the medicine from the recipe book allowed me to fully cure my taste disorder. I then immediately headed to Zheng Fa, to train my design skills. Ray: So he wasn't seen ever since that case because he was in a foreign country... Gustavia: Indeed. And I'm certain that I went abroad to train... ...about one year after that case... Right before Sir Master's final trial began. And thanks to my training, I am now a confectioner unparalleled in both taste and design! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You should not be proud of a position earned through the sacrifices of others. Gustavia: Nwahahahahahahaha! You can't bake a cake without breaking a few eggs. Sacrifices were necessary for my goal! Kay: That's horrible... Gustavia: Say what you will! The fact still remains that you cannot arrest me! Edgeworth: (Ngh...! I have to get more information out of Mr. Gustavia. Was there anything of note in his recent testimony?) His training in Zheng Fa Edgeworth: Could you please add the details about your training in Zheng Fa to your testimony? Gustavia: Certainly. Add statement: \"Afterwards, I trained in Zheng Fa to become the world's best confectioner.\" Mr. Master's final trial Edgeworth: Could you please add the details about Mr. Master's final trial to your testimony? Gustavia: Certainly. Add statement: \"I did not witness the Sir Master's final trial.\" Nothing seems important Edgeworth: (...Nothing seems particularly important. I'll think about this a little more.) Edgeworth: Could you please add the details about your training in Zheng Fa to your testimony? Gustavia: Certainly. Add statement: \"Afterwards, I trained in Zheng Fa to become the world's best confectioner.\" Edgeworth: Could you please add the details about Mr. Master's final trial to your testimony? Gustavia: Certainly. Add statement: \"I did not witness the Sir Master's final trial.\" Edgeworth: (...Nothing seems particularly important. I'll think about this a little more.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: It's... too early to say for sure that it's impossible! Gustavia: Just give up, Sir Prosecutor. Just like your father before you, you cannot catch me! Edgeworth: Ngh...! (It was because of Von Karma's interference that my father couldn't find the truth. And now, I'm about to lose the truth due to the statute of limitations...!) Kay: Mr. Edgeworth! We can't give up now! Your father's last case... We have to see it through the end! Edgeworth: Kay... Kay: We can't let the culprit steal the truth! That's our job, as Great Thieves! Edgeworth: I am not a Great Thief... But, it is as you say. Dane Gustavia... I won't let you escape! Gustavia: Nwahahahahahahaha! By all means, do try your best!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you confessed because you knew that the statute of limitations had already expired. Gustavia: Nwahahahaha! Of course! Who would confess otherwise!? Well... I would have preferred to carry the truth of Dover's murder to my grave. Edgeworth: ...Why is that? Gustavia: I am now the World's Best Confectioner...! I wouldn't want to have such a trifling matter affect my path as an artisan of desserts. Ray: So you let Mr. Master take the fall, while you protected your own position. ...You alone, I cannot forgive...! Gustavia: My path is for me to decide. I don't need your forgiveness! Ray: Miles. It's been a long time... Since your Uncle Ray's been this angry. Edgeworth: ...I feel the same way. I cannot allow this man to go unchecked...!\nEdgeworth: ...I can see how he was able to escape justice for 18 years.\nKay: Isn't there some way we can catch him!?\nRay: Mr. Gustavia is an amateur at law, after all. He's no match for a real ace attorney. ...I'm sure there's some flaw in his plan that we can exploit.\nEdgeworth: (...An amateur at law, huh...)",

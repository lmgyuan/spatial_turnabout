One of the black raven... ...and one of the white raven. A country torn in two. One to the west... ...and one to the east. When those which were split are made whole again... ...the truth will reveal itself.\nI-It's the Yatagarasu! The Yatagarasu's here!\nEdgeworth:\nYou... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...!\n-- 8 Hours Earlier --\nMarch 14, 10:17 AM\nHigh Prosecutors' Offices - Room 1202\nEdgeworth:\n(It's so nice, almost dreamlike, to finally have the chance to relax and sip some tea. Especially after what a whirlwind the past few days have been.) On my return flight, I was dragged into a case involving an Interpol agent's murder. The next day, I investigated a kidnapping and a murder at the Gatewater Land theme park. And later that night, a detective's dead body welcomed me back to my office... ...along with a thief who was out to pilfer files related to a case from 10 years ago. (How did I manage to find myself in the middle of so many cases back to back? Well, at least I have today. All I ask is that I be allowed to spend it quietly.)\n???:\nMr. Edgewooooorth! This is big! Big, I tell you! ...Hey, what's wrong with you? Where's your enthusiasm...?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd suddenly, the phrase \"the fragility of dreams\" comes to mind...\nKay:\nWhat are you talking about, \"fragile dreams\"!? Come on, let's go! The fake Yatagarasu isn't going to just find herself, you know!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, if you must know... it's possible that I was paid a visit last night by your \"fake\".\nKay:\nSay what?\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately for us, the thief managed to escape. But even now, we're still looking for this criminal. However, I must warn you that we've only had a few hours to search so far... ...so I must insist that you be patient on this one, Kay.\nKay:\nWh-What's with you today...? Are you sure you aren't sleep-talking to me right now? Anyway, I've got something much more important that I want you to see!\nEdgeworth:\nOh, and that is?\nKay:\nTake a look at this!\nEdgeworth:\n\"On March 14th, I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" That's quite a bold declaration to send to an embassy... (I suppose it was inevitable that a newspaper would catch wind of this.)\nKay:\nThe date the card mentions is today!\nEdgeworth:\nToday, huh...\nKay:\nCome on, we've gotta hurry! The embassy awaits!\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose it IS quite an urgent matter... ...however, do you know which country's embassy we should be investigating?\nKay:\nWell, it's some really special country, and I'm actually really fuzzy on the details... But never mind that! Where's all your energy!? Why are you so lackadaisical today!?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm not, Kay. You're just too wound up.\nKay:\nWell, then you should get too wound up, too! Because this just might be our chance to catch that woman!\nEdgeworth:\nYou mean Ms. Yew? (The woman who killed Kay's father, Byrne Faraday, seven years ago... Calisto Yew... She claimed to be the Great Thief Yatagarasu... ...and then disappeared from the courtroom.)\nKay:\nArgh! She makes me so mad! The phony! Everyone knows that the real Yatagarasu would never send something like a calling card! Until a company's underhanded dealings are made public... ...the target is always totally unaware that the Yatagarasu has paid them a visit. That's what makes the real Yatagarasu so awesome!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... The Yatagarasu's card that's shown in this article... It looks to me as though it could be genuine.\nKay:\nSee, that's the thing. Whoever it is, that person isn't the real deal, but has knowledge of the Yatagarasu. If this isn't a clue that that woman's involved, then nothing is! Come on, Mr. Edgeworth! Out the door you go!\nEdgeworth:\nWait, there are a few preparations I must make before we go... (There's something interesting about this card we found last night here in my office... It's of a different color than the one in the article, which makes me wonder why.)\nKay:\nWhat's up? Any reason why you're boring a hole through the newspaper with your eyes?\nEdgeworth:\nNo... No reason at all. Very well. Seeing as how Ms. Yew is also someone of a special nature to me... ...I agree there is some merit to be found in investigating this.\nKay:\nI knew you'd come around!\nMarch 14, 5:00 PM\nTheatrum Neutralis\n???:\nBy the light of this night's glorious moon... We are ready!\nPink Princess:\nReady to embark on our nightly outing.\nSteel Samurai:\nAnd this is where... ...our tale begins!\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... What a coincidence. Who would've thought that a Steel Samurai stage show... ...would ever be held at such an elegant theater inside a foreign embassy?\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront of badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis badge's design is said to reflect the relentlessness and discipline of law enforcement. It comes from the authority vested in us as strict protectors of the law... ...and executors of sentences, much like harsh winter frosts and blazing summer days. To wear it is to identify oneself as a prosecutor, but I have no interest in doing so.\n\n\n\n\nBack of badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nEach Prosecutor's Badge is engraved with the number of its owner on the back. Hmph. Numbers. As if we're not human on the inside like everyone else!\nKay:\nYeah! The climax was really awesome! \"Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\" I got chills down my spine when he pulled that move out!\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose it really is more impactful to watch a show in person than on television.\nKay:\nI have to say, though, this embassy is set up kinda funny. I mean, they have two countries sharing the same building!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, as you said yourself, this place and the countries it houses are very special. Even this theater is special in that it is a neutral zone shared by the two countries.\nKay:\nUmm... So, let me get this straight... The Steel Samurai show just now is being sponsored by one of the two countries. The one that's called the Kingdom of Allebahst, right?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it would appear that the Steel Samurai is very popular in that country as well.\nKay:\nSeems that way! But you know who I'M really into? The Jammin' Ninja! The Republic of Babahl is sponsoring a Jammin' Ninja stage show! That's something for fangirls like me! We've totally gotta see that too, Mr. Edgeworth! The Jammin' Ninja's show is gonna kick the Steel Samurai show's rear end!\nEdgeworth:\n(You know, ever since I first met this girl, I've always had this inkling... ...that what she really wants to be... ...is not a thief, but rather, a ninja...)\nKay:\nSo anyway, about today's event... umm... What's it called again?\nEdgeworth:\n\"The Kingdom of Allebahst versus The Republic of Babahl Goodwill Jubilee\". The small, European countries of the Kingdom of Allebahst... ...and the Republic of Babahl. These two countries used to be a single entity that was abundant with nature. And it was called... the Principality of Cohdopia. ..................\nKay:\nHm? Is everything alright, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I'm alright. Moving on... After a period of civil unrest, the country split in two, though signs of their past remain. For example, their flags preserve the flower and butterfly motifs to this day. ......... (Cohdopia, huh... The KG-8 Incident... and what was referred to as the second KG-8 Incident... ...in which an Embassy staff member was murdered... Both of these cases were related to the Principality of Cohdopia. In the seven years that have passed, the country may have split into two... ...however, the Yatagarasu still sent a calling card here. What could it all mean?) .........\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth... I know you're thinking about something!\nEdgeworth:\nOh, excuse me. What were we talking about again?\nKay:\nArgh, if you could please stop spacing out on me! Anyway, we were talking about the Allebahst versus Babahl Goodwill Jubilee. The two countries have had a pretty bad relationship with each other... ...but supposedly, they've been trying really hard to make up recently. That's why they decided to hold this event.\nEdgeworth:\n(If that's the case, then why the \"versus\"...?)\nKay:\nAlso, both countries claim to own the real \"Primidux Statue\", a national treasure to both. They're planning to have them publicly evaluated today, to see which one's the real deal.\nEdgeworth:\nKay, need I remind you to take care and not succumb to your thieving desires?\nKay:\nWell, when it comes to treasure, I can't help myself. You know that!\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... She had better be saying that in jest...)\nKay:\nHey! I can read your body language, you know! And you've got it all wrong! Look! I'm here to do some investigating! INVESTIGATING, I tell you!\nEdgeworth:\nHeh, I know. And although we don't know if the Yatagarasu will really make an appearance... ...I suppose we should still spend some time examining this place.\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuard by left door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuard:\nIs there something I can help you with?\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering what is beyond these doors.\nGuard:\nIt's the Allebahstian Embassy. Now, unless you have some business with the Embassy...\nEdgeworth:\n(I suppose I can't really claim to have any business with the Embassy right now.)\nKay:\nWell, you don't have to be so rude about it, Mr. Guard! Hrmph!\n\n\n\n\nMan in blue suit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMan:\nTen more minutes... No, in five more minutes... But isn't it really bad for me to spend time doing this? It's no use! Would someone please just tell me what I should do!\nEdgeworth:\nYou appear to be troubled by something. May I be of any assistance?\nMan:\nLeave me alone! I'm trying to figure out just the right time to talk to that girl over there! And if I mess up, it'll be because I'm talking to you right now!\nKay:\nSomehow, I get the feeling he's about to fall flat on his face.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, let's just do as he wishes and leave him alone.\n\n\n\n\nGirls by pamphlets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFan:\nYou know, I've seen a lot of these shows in a bunch of other places... ...but today's show, it was like they went for a complete comedy, know what I mean?\nFriend:\nYeah, And that last move, the Steel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Sushi Slice] in the original release)... I couldn't help but laugh!\nFan:\nI know, right!? And that Pink Princess's movements were really stiff. In the middle of the show, I could swear that I heard her hip crack.\nFriend:\nOh, I know! I totally thought that, too! The Pink Princess has a bad hip!? Seriously!? Just what were they thinking, you know!?\nEdgeworth:\n(I suppose there is no graceful way to enter this conversation...)\n\n\n\n\nMan in green suit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMan:\nThis is... the perfect angle!\nEdgeworth:\n?\nMan:\nGo, my image! Travel across the wave world and into every TV set around the globe!\nEdgeworth:\n(A more honest approach to appearing on TV might serve your ambitions better...)\n\n\n\n\nReporter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporter:\nAnd we're here, reporting live from the Theatrum Neutralis. As you can see, tonight's audience is full of enthusiasm! Let's see what this member of the audience has to say.\nEdgeworth:\nW-Well, I...\nCameraman:\nOK, that was good. Let's do one more run-through!\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me, but when you are ready to film for real, would you mind giving me a call...? (I sense that she didn't hear a single world I just said.)\n\n\n\n\nCameraman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCameraman:\nOK, OK, that's good. Alright, now give me a dramatic \"slam!\" right there! Stop! Stoooop! Hey, do you mind!? Get out of the way, buddy. OK, once more! In 3, 2, 1, action!\nEdgeworth:\nKay, was that my fault just now?\nKay:\nWell, he's obviously working... I guess we should leave him alone.\n\n\n\n\nBoy by TV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(It appears that the child is watching a video from the first season of the Steel Samurai.)\nChild:\n♪Go! Go! Keep on fighting, until your last breath!♪ ♪Go, my hero, the Steel Samurai!♪\nEdgeworth:\n(Completely absorbed in singing the theme song, I see... I'll let the child watch in peace.)\n\n\n\n\nCamerawoman (Lotta Hart)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCameraman:\nWhere in tarnation are they!? Come on, big scoop! Hey, mister! Outta the way! Yeah, I'm talkin' to ya!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh... (I seem to remember this woman from somewhere... ...yet my instincts are directing me not to engage in conversation with her. Perhaps it would be best if I left her alone.)\n\n\n\n\nGuard by right door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuard:\nIs there something I can help you with?\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering what is beyond these doors.\nGuard:\nThe Babahlese Embassy is just beyond these doors, sir. Do you have some business with the Embassy? Do you require immediate access?\nEdgeworth:\nAh, no, that's quite alright.\nGuard:\nAre you sure, sir? Anyone and everyone is always welcome in the Republic of Babahl!\nKay:\nWell, then! Since we're here!\nEdgeworth:\nAn embassy isn't some sort of theme park, Kay.\nKay:\nTch! You're such a buzz kill!\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPamphlets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere are pamphlets about the two embassies here on this table.\nKay:\nHmm... It still looks weird to me.\nEdgeworth:\nThe country split into two a few years back. And they've shared the building and its grounds 50-50 ever since.\nKay:\nOh? I guess it's because they don't have the money to build two separate ones, huh?\nEdgeworth:\nI-I should think that's not the reason why, Kay.\n\n\n\n\nFlag by left door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe national flag of the Kingdom of Allebahst is on display here. The crest on it features a flower.\nKay:\nFlowers and butterflies are kind of rare motifs for flags, don't you think?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, when they used to be Cohdopia, the government used to take pride in its land. The citizens also loved the rich, bountiful nature all around them, thus the design.\nKay:\nHey, if the Steel Samurai got popular enough, do you think they'd put him on their flag?\nEdgeworth:\nAre you in your right mind, Kay?\nKay:\nHmm... Or maybe the Jammin' Ninja would make a better candidate...?\nEdgeworth:\n(Hah, don't make me laugh (changed from [Heh, don't make me laugh, Kay] in the original release). Only the Steel Samurai deserves such an honor.)\n\n\n\n\nFlowers on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThose are some nice flowers! I wonder who they're from? \"Gatewater Imperial Hotel\"? Where's this, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nAh, it's an ultra-luxurious hotel that sponsors the Steel Samurai series. I've been there once to investigate a case.\nKay:\nOh? So what kind of case was it?\nEdgeworth:\nI believe it was related to the Nickel Samurai and the Jammin' Ninja...\nKay:\nOh, I remember reading about that! You must be the head of Steel Samurai affairs down at the Prosecutor's Office, huh?\nEdgeworth:\n(I should think that even you can figure that such an office does not exist, Kay.)\n\n\n\n\nTV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is a flat-panel, a tape deck, and a row of Steel Samurai videos on this table. I suppose it's so visitors can watch an episode or two at their leisure.\nKay:\nI guess it really is just that popular, huh?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, although I never thought I would see it reach this level of popularity...\nKay:\nI wonder why they decided to call on the Steel Samurai for an event like this? I mean, it's like they intended to cut the two countries apart with the Samurai Sword instead!\nEdgeworth:\n(Wouldn't that go against the whole point of this event...?)\n\n\n\n\nFlowers on right side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese flowers were sent by Global Studios.\nKay:\nGlobal Studios?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's where they film the Steel Samurai television show. They have been producing hit after hit recently, so the studio is being remodeled.\nKay:\nOh! I read about that in the papers the other day! That mascot of theirs is also getting a face-lift, too, right? Umm... what's its name?\nEdgeworth:\nYou mean Mrs. Monkey?\nKay:\nYeah, I thought it was something like that! You really have a great memory!\nEdgeworth:\nHah! Never underestimate my powers of recollection.\n\n\n\n\nFlag by right door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe national flag of the Republic of Babahl is on display here. The crest on it features a butterfly.\nKay:\nIt's really rare to see a national flag featuring an animal on it!\nEdgeworth:\nNot really. I can list at least a few off for you that do.\nKay:\nOK, then are there any flags with really chic things on them?\nEdgeworth:\n\"Chic\" things? That's pretty vague, Kay... Although, by my definition, there aren't really any flags that feature a \"chic\" object.\nKay:\nAww, that's too bad. Because if there was, I was thinking about stealing it...\nEdgeworth:\n(And what exactly would you do with a stolen national flag, Kay...?)\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's a very festive atmosphere in here.\nKay:\nYup, super festive! I'm really happy for the Kingdom of Allebahst and the Republic of Babahl. It's great that they have re-established diplomatic relations! The newspapers say that it's almost like they're Cohdopia once again.\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps we are bearing witness to a historic moment in time.\nKay:\nHey! Look! They're selling some commemorative merchandise to celebrate this event! Founder's Cohdopia Biscuits. And over here, they're selling Royal Cohdopia Biscuits.\nEdgeworth:\n...It would seem that they have yet to reconcile their competitive spirits.\nAfter examining pamphlets:\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose I'll just help myself to one of these...\nEmbassy Guide stuck into the pages of my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? What is all the hubbub?) Ack!\nKay:\nHey, look! It's the Steel Samurai! And he's got his son, the Iron Infant, with him!!\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"May I speak with you for a second?\"\nEdgeworth:\nMay I speak with you for a second? (...It's... the Steel Samurai...)\nSteel Samurai:\n.........\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! What are you glaring at him for!?\nEdgeworth:\nAhem, please excuse me. It's just that I've never seen a super-hero up close before.\nSteel Samurai:\n.........\nKay:\nIt looks like he's written something down for you!\nEdgeworth:\n\"To Edgeworth, From Steel Samurai Daddy: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo\"\nKay:\nWow, an autograph! Pretty cool that you got one, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nHeh...\nSteel Samurai's Autograph received.\nGuard:\nMr. Steel Samurai! Ambassador Alba is waiting for you!\nReporter:\nAnd now the Steel Samurai... ...will proceed to enter the Kingdom of Allebahst to shake the hand of the ambassador. The Steel Samurai isn't only here for the two countries tonight... ...but rather, can be thought of as a goodwill ambassador from our own country as well!\nKay:\nThere he goes. Off to spread goodwill to the world.\nEdgeworth:\nHe really does seem like a goodwill ambassador, doesn't he?\nCameraman:\nOK! We're shooting the next segment now! Cue camera!\nReporter:\nIn just a few seconds, the Jammin' Ninja stage show is set to begin. After the show, the Jammin' Ninja will enter the Republic of Babahl. He is set to meet with the Ambassador of Babahl at that time.\nKay:\nAHH! The Jammin' Ninja's show is about to start! We've gotta get back to our seats!\nEdgeworth:\nRegrettably... I don't have much of an interest in ninjas...\nKay:\nWell, this show will change your mind! Come on, we have to hurry! If we miss even a second of the Jammin' Ninja's awesome playing, I'll never forgive you!\nEdgeworth:\n(Nngh... I suppose you're not about to give me much of a choice here, are you, Kay?)\nKay:\nAhhh! I could listen to that \"A Ninja Marked for Death's Lullaby\" song all day! His superb playing and that sad melody really brought a tear to my eye! And his heart-wrenching voice! Now THAT'S the Jammin' Ninja's greatest weapon!\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nKay:\nAhh! Those pieces of Jammin' Ninja merchandise over there! I've got to have them! I especially want the hair sticks they're selling exclusively at these shows. They're exactly like the ones the heroine, Princess Misola, wears in her hair!\nEdgeworth:\n...Anyway.\nKay:\nAnyway!? ANYWAY!? Hold it right there, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nYes?\nKay:\nYou're thinking of going home, aren't you!?\nEdgeworth:\nWell, it doesn't seem likely that the Yatagarasu will be making an appearance tonight. Most likely, it was simply a prank.\nKay:\nNo way! I just know the Yatagarasu will show!\nEdgeworth:\nBut I thought you said that the Yatagarasu doesn't send calling cards.\nKay:\nYeah, I did, but...\nEdgeworth:\nI figured from the very beginning that this would wind up being a wild goose chase.\nKay:\nBut that card she sent was a genuine fake calling card!\nEdgeworth:\nA genuine fake...?\nKay:\nWell, how can I word this...? The Yatagarasu's mark that's on the calling card is exactly the same as my mark. Get it now?\nOfficer:\nW-We've got a problem! Th-The Yatagarasu has been spotted in Allebahst!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nKay:\nYou hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? Hah! So you finally decided to show yourself, you phony! Hey, what gives!?\nGuard:\nI'm sorry but I will need to search you before you may enter.\nKay:\nWhat the!? Hey! The Steel Samurai just waltzed straight on through without one! Now if you don't hurry up and let me through, my phony is going to escape!\nEdgeworth:\nKay, a country's embassy is considered to be a part of the country itself. If you don't go through the proper procedures to enter the country...\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth! I'm going to enter through Babahl and climb over the wall into Allebahst!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYou would tell a prosecutor straight out that you intend to illegally enter another... Kay, are you listening to me!?\nKay:\nKay Faraday, and I'm coming through!\nGuard:\nYes, and welcome!\nEdgeworth:\nSomeone stop her! Anyone!\nMarch 14, 6:12 PM\nOpen-Air Stage\nEdgeworth:\n*huff, huff, huff*... Kay... Where are you? Don't tell me you really did find some way over this fence... Ack!\nGuard:\nFire! This is too big for us to handle! Looks like the Yatagarasu came to Babahl, too!\nEdgeworth:\nYou... accursed Yatagarasu! Kay! You...! You had better be alright, wherever you are!\nMarch 14, 6:45 PM\nBabahlese Embassy - Secretariat's Office\nKay:\nI told you! It wasn't me!\nShih-na:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n*huff, huff, huff*... Kay! Are you alright!?\nKay:\nDo I look alright to you!? Now, can you do something about this woman!?\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe! What is the meaning of this!?\nGumshoe:\n*sigh* Well, sir... it's um, this.\nEdgeworth:\nHe's...!\nKay:\nIt wasn't me! He was already dead when I ran in here, hot on the heels of the fake Yatagarasu! Look, I only came in here because I saw a suspicious person at the open-air stage!\nEdgeworth:\nA suspicious person?\nKay:\nA long, black coat and a hood over their head -- I dare you to tell me that's not suspicious! When I saw that person, I immediately thought that they must be the fake Yatagarasu. So I chased after them into the Embassy, then into here, and then lost sight of them... But I just KNOW that person is the one who did it!\nShih-na:\nWhat are you so worked up over? There is no reason for you to be this loud.\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but you're Agent Lang's secretary... ...Shih-na, I believe your name is, correct?\nShih-na:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\nAnd if you are making an arrest... ...I assume you have evidence that it was Kay who committed the crime, is that also correct?\nShih-na:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\nYou refuse to answer!?\nShih-na:\nI don't need to answer.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nShih-na:\nYou are merely a prosecutor in this country, meaning you have no investigative authority.\nGumshoe:\nH-Hey, pal! Just what the heck does what you just said mean!? If it happened here, it's under Mr. Edgeworth's jurisdiction. The end. And seeing as how this building is sitting on our soil, we can investigate wherever we'd like!\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, Detective, embassies are a different matter.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nThis office is considered to be a part of the Republic of Babahl. Which means that anything that happens in here... ...defaults to the control of the Babahlese government and Babahlese law... ...giving them exclusive extraterritorial rights.\nGumshoe:\nExtraterrestrial (changed from [Extraterristrial] in the original release, correcting the typo) rights? Sir, do you really believe that the truth is out there!?\nEdgeworth:\n*sigh* Basically, our country's laws do not apply inside the embassy of another country. That's what was agreed to by our respective governments. Our authority to investigate was effectively nullified the second we entered this place. Which means we can do little here in this situation...\nGumshoe:\nN-No way, sir!\nShih-na:\nPlease leave this matter in Interpol's hands and go home.\nEdgeworth:\nN...Nnnnngh...\nGumshoe:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth...\nKay:\nH-Hey, you're not...!? Mr. Edgeworth!\n???:\n???:\nIn that case... allow me to join your investigation.\nGumshoe:\nM-Ms. von Karma! Eeek!\nFranziska:\nAmbassador Palaeno, I truly appreciate you allowing me to join the investigation.\nPalaeno:\nIt's really nothing. Manny was my secretariat, so of course I want to help you as much as I can. In fact, it's a blessing that Interpol agents were able to make it so quickly.\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska...\nFranziska:\nWell, well. I never imagined that I'd meet you here of all places. This is an embassy, meaning that you have no authority to conduct...\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska:\nA-Already!? What is it!?\nEdgeworth:\nAmbassador Palaeno.\nPalaeno:\nHm? And you are?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm Miles Edgeworth, public prosecutor. I ask that you please allow me to investigate this case as Ms. von Karma's assistant.\nGumshoe:\nA...Assistant?\nFranziska:\nMiles!? What the heck do you think you're...!?\nEdgeworth:\nPlease, I implore you, Ambassador Palaeno.\nPalaeno:\nVery well. I'll be counting on the two of you, Ms. von Karma and Mr. Edgeworth.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... What did you mean by you'll be Ms. von Karma's assistant...?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't exactly have a choice, do I, Detective? If I don't become Franziska's assistant, I can't participate in this investigation.\nFranziska:\nHmph. There you go again, running at the mouth with that aloof expression on your face.\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska, please...\nFranziska:\nI don't know what you're planning quite yet... ...but at least I do know one thing -- that you are now my subordinate. Just remember that my whip is always ready to wake you, should you have a brain lapse.\nEdgeworth:\nOf course. I'll keep that in mind.\nShih-na:\n...If you are done playing games...!\nEdgeworth:\nRight. let's begin the investigation.\nBegin Investigation\nBabahlese Embassy - Secretariat's Office\nEdgeworth:\nBy the way, Detective... I suppose it's a bit late to be asking, but why are you here?\nGumshoe:\nWell, better late than never, I guess, sir. I was placed on guard duty for the Babahlese Embassy today!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why are our police guarding an embassy?\nGumshoe:\nWell, on account of the card they got from the Yatagarasu... ...they called us up and asked for our help, sir. Oh, and because we've been searching for the Yatagarasu these past seven years! It was a more or less mutually beneficial arrangement, if you ask me!\nEdgeworth:\nExcept for how mutually unbeneficial this has all turned out to be, I suppose. It looks like you failed to competently perform your guard duty yet again.\nGumshoe:\nAck...!\nEdgeworth:\nLook forward to your next salary negotiation... although, it's out of my hands.\nGumshoe:\nBut sir! If it gets cut any more, I won't be able to buy even instant (changed from [packet] in the original release) noodles anymore...\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska von Karma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is it?\nFranziska:\nLet me tell you something. You are currently my subordinate. And if you wish to convince everyone else of that, you will speak to me with respect!\nEdgeworth:\n(What's with the giddy glint in her eyes?) I don't think that will really be necessary, Franziska.\nFranziska:\nOh, really? Well, it doesn't matter. It doesn't change the fact that you are still under me.\nEdgeworth:\n(I thought Franziska was flying around the world in pursuit of the smuggling case. So then, why is she here at this embassy (Franziska's return - Why is she here when she is supposed to be overseas in pursuit of a smuggling ring?)...?)\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nI was investigating at the Allebahstian Embassy when I got wind of this mess.\nEdgeworth:\nAh, that's right. The Yatagarasu was due to appear at that embassy as well.\nFranziska:\nYes, but the difference is that we didn't have a fire over there. Although, there was an incident at the Allebahstian Embassy as well... But I left Agent Lang in charge of that case and came over to the Babahlese Embassy.\nEdgeworth:\nAh... So Agent Lang is here as well, huh?\nFranziska:\nI see you've met. Well, he's in the Allebahstian Embassy acting as body guard for Ambassador Alba. ...However, he seems to have a different reason for being there.\n\n\n\n\nYatagarasu (appears after \"The murder\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nSo the suspect in the murder that occurred in this office is that little girl, I see. Is she, perhaps, trying to be the Yatagarasu?\nGumshoe:\nK-Kay would never harm a soul, sir!\nFranziska:\n...Kay?\nEdgeworth:\nYou remember, do you not? About the case we investigated together seven years ago? That girl is the daughter of the victim in that case, Mr. Faraday.\nFranziska:\n! So she's that feisty little girl...\nEdgeworth:\nKay has been on the trail of the Yatagarasu, which is how she ended up here... ...looking for the one who took her father's life.\nFranziska:\n...I see.\nGumshoe:\nKay's trying so hard, but you know what!? The Yatagarasu just keeps on tricking us all!\nEdgeworth:\nHm...? How so?\nGumshoe:\nThe Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret (Stealing of secret - The card warned that the Yatagarasu will steal the embassy's 'dirtiest secret'.)\"... ...but all we've had is an arson and a murder! The lab boys are going in circles! You know what this is, sirs!? It's a breach of contract, and it's going on the rap sheet!\nFranziska:\nIf you ask me, I'm perfectly fine with the fact that nothing was stolen tonight.\nEdgeworth:\n(I do wonder, though, if Calisto Yew really is the Yatagarasu...)\n\n\n\n\nSmuggling (appears after connecting \"Stealing of secret\" and \"Franziska's return\" Logic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska, when we last talked, you said that you were on the trail of a smuggling ring. I suppose the reason you are here right now is related to that?\nFranziska:\n...Yes. After analyzing the intel we've gathered from various countries... ...this embassy... rose to the top of our list of sites to investigate. And this is what tipped us off.\nEdgeworth:\nThis accounting document...?\nFranziska:\nIt's only one page of the whole thing, so we're not sure about all the details... ...however, it's enough for us to grab onto the tail of the beast. For you see... this type of paper was made only in the Principality (changed from [Kingdom] in the original release) of Cohdopia. Which means that somewhere in the countries of Allebahst and Babahl is the head! The one pulling the strings behind the entire smuggling ring!\nEdgeworth:\n(That's Franziska for you... She's amazing -- pursuing this case with all she has.)\nCohdopian Paper Document data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nSmuggling (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska, when we last talked, you said that you were on the trail of a smuggling ring. I suppose the reason you are here right now is related to that?\nFranziska:\n...Yes. After analyzing the intel we've gathered from various countries... ...this embassy... rose to the top of our list of sites to investigate. And this is what tipped us off.\nEdgeworth:\nThis accounting document...?\nFranziska:\nIt's only one page of the whole thing, so we're not sure about all the details... ...however, it's enough for us to grab onto the tail of the beast.

She's amazing -- pursuing this case with all she has.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nWhat about your Prosecutor's Badge? I have one, too, you know.\nEdgeworth:\nAh, yes... So you do. But seeing as I'm not currently a proper prosecutor, I thought I'd give presenting it a try.\nFranziska:\n............ Is that any way for you to act towards your superior!?\nEdgeworth:\nAs if threatening a whipping is the proper way of lecturing someone!\n\n\n\n\nNotes on Coachen's Body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nIt appears that he died of a stab wound. Arngh!! Whoever did this had a lot of nerve! I just can't fathom what could've led the killer to turn a knife against a man!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I just can't fathom what the prosecutor lashing out with her whip is thinking...\n\n\n\n\nKnife or Yatagarasu's Key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nWould you mind not pointing that in my direction? It's dangerous. And anyway, why are you showing it to me?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no particular reason...\nFranziska:\n!!\nEdgeworth:\nGnnrk!\nFranziska:\nIf you have no reason! Don't you bring that dangerous object near me! Do you understand!?\nEdgeworth:\n! (I-Is she really that oblivious to the irony in that statement? She lets loose that dangerous whip of hers for no reason all the time!)\n\n\n\n\nCohdopian Paper Document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nWe were able to finally obtain this proof of the smuggling operation through Interpol. So remember to take extra care when handling it... my subordinate.\nEdgeworth:\n*sigh*... (She's enjoying the power trip of calling me her subordinate just a taaaad too much...)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMs. von Karma, what do you think of this piece of evidence?\nFranziska:\nHmph, well, since you asked so nicely as my subordinate, I'll answer you. However, as your superior, I also must make sure that my subordinates grow on the job. Therefore, please gather your own thoughts together first, and then try presenting again.\nEdgeworth:\n(A simple, \"I don't have any thoughts about that\" would've sufficed...)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColias Palaeno\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalaeno:\nI can't believe that Manny fell among thieves tonight... Without him, I have no idea what my schedule for tonight is.\nEdgeworth:\nAmbassador Palaeno, I believe your schedule tonight will consist of... ...listening to reports from the police. That and only that. I ask you to cooperate not only for your own sake, but for Mr. Coachen's as well.\nPalaeno:\n...You're a rather strong man, aren't you? How fascinating! Here, I know it isn't much, but I'd like you to have these.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but it would be against my principles to accept a bribe.\nPalaeno:\nOh, no, no. These are simply coupons we distribute to promote Babahl. Remember, we offer a large number of discounts and offers when you visit lovely Babahl!\nEdgeworth:\n(Now I remember. The Republic of Babahl is known for its feverish tourism industry...)\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManny Coachen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI was wondering if you might tell me a bit about the deceased, Manny Coachen.\nPalaeno:\nHe was my secretary, and the embassy secretariat, charged with running the whole place. He was an admirable man. His death is a great loss to our country. He was in charge of everything, accounting, printing, taking care of our national treasures...\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry, but did you say \"printing\"?\nPalaeno:\nOur country's primary source of revenue is our tourism industry. So, in order for us to print the necessary pamphlets, flyers, coupons, etcetera... ...we have a printing press here at our embassy.\nEdgeworth:\nI see. Please excuse my forwardness, however... ...I feel I should mention that I have the distinct impression that I've met him before.\nPalaeno:\n! Oh, yes... Since you are of the legal profession, I suppose you just might have. After all, Manny was involved in the KG-8 Incident.\nEdgeworth:\nTh-The KG-8 Incident!?\nPalaeno:\nThe defendant who was found innocent in that case was Manny.\nEdgeworth:\nSo your Mr. Coachen is the same man as the one in that case...\nPalaeno:\nIt's been 10 years. Manny recovered personally from that case, and dove enthusiastically into this job. He was the one who planned this event, and was to oversee this embassy's renovations. It really is a shame. He had such a bright future ahead of him.\n\n\n\n\nRenovations (appears after \"Manny Coachen\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat exactly did you mean earlier by \"renovations\"?\nPalaeno:\nWe can't have tourists and visitors to our embassy think we're a poor nation, can we? So renovating the embassy is something of an investment. We may have a rather paltry budget, but we're trying our best to make do (changed from [due] in the original release, correcting the typo). However... ...I guess the only person who could've helped us do our best is now no longer with us.\n\n\n\n\nCohdopia (appears after examining key on body and clearing \"Manny Coachen\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAmbassador Palaeno, I was wondering if I may ask you about Cohdopia.\nPalaeno:\nCohdopia? Alright. What would you like to talk about?\nEdgeworth:\nFirst... I'd like to ask you about this key.\nPalaeno:\nHm? What about this key?\nEdgeworth:\nI found it sticking out of Mr. Coachen's pocket. I believe it originally belonged to this embassy. Is that correct?\nPalaeno:\nHmm... Upon closer inspection, it seems that this key is shaped like a butterfly.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not all about this key. It's also capable of changing into a knife.\nPalaeno:\nOh! How fascinating!\nEdgeworth:\n(Is it possible that the ambassador didn't know about the existence of this key...?)\nPalaeno:\n...Hm? In its knife form, there is a flower mark at the base of the blade. Hmm... I guess this knife might be from when we used to be a part of Cohdopia.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nAnd how did you come to that conclusion?\nPalaeno:\nIt has both of Cohdopia's national symbols, the butterfly and the flower. I suppose Manny used this key here at the embassy (Key used at Embassy - This key was stolen from the Cohdopian Embassy 7 years ago by the Yatagarasu.) back when we were still Cohdopia.\nFranziska:\nAmbassador Palaeno, this key was stolen from the Cohdopian Embassy seven years ago... ...by Calisto Yew, otherwise known as the Great Thief Yatagarasu.\nPalaeno:\n! O-Oh, really?\nEdgeworth:\nYou were not aware that Ms. Yew had broken into this embassy at that time?\nPalaeno:\nI'm sorry I can't be of much help. I'm not very familiar with the details, you see. I only became the ambassador after Babahl became its own independent nation. But if Manny were still alive, he would probably know about what happened back then...\nEdgeworth:\n(Mr. Coachen and Ms. Yew knew each other seven years ago... But that doesn't explain why I found the Yatagarasu's Key here in the present.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalaeno:\nOh, is that a Prosecutor's Badge? It has a very cool design! Aha! I know! We should start selling items like this as souvenirs in Babahl! The tourists will absolutely go nuts over them!\nEdgeworth:\n(Please don't compare a proud symbol of my profession to a cheap souvenir...)\n\n\n\n\nEmbassy Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalaeno:\nOh, isn't that about our great embassy? Ah... How do you like our pamphlets?\nEdgeworth:\nI feel indifferent about them, to be honest. I'm just using this as evidence.\nPalaeno:\nOh, that's too bad... In that case, I guess we'll just have to try harder to make more charming ones! ! I-I just had a flash of inspiration! We should make all of our pamphlets into coupon books!\nEdgeworth:\n............ (His expectations of what a coupon can do is just a tad hyper-inflated.)\n\n\n\n\nNotes on Coachen's Body or Knife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalaeno:\nOh, dear... If people were to find out that a murder occurred at our embassy... ...the number of tourists would plummet, as would our revenues! It'd be a disaster! What are we going to do...?\nEdgeworth:\n(He really does seem worried. Perhaps I should refrain from bringing this up...)\n\n\n\n\nBabahl's Primidux Statue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalaeno:\nThis statue resembles that hero, the Steel Samurai, don't you think? I was thinking, what would you say to changing its name to the \"Steel Samurai Statue\"? It just might attract a few more tourists to our country if I did, right?\nEdgeworth:\nI-I'm not sure what to think... (I thought that thing was a national treasure...)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAmbassador Palaeno, I was wondering if you might have some thoughts on this.\nPalaeno:\nI think that you would know more about the case than I. So let me make it up to you for not knowing anything about that with these coupons!\nEdgeworth:\n...Thank you, however, I feel I must decline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficer:\nSorry, but Interpol is still conducting its investigation beyond this point.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm a subordinate of Ms. von Karma. Is there some reason why I'm being denied access?\nOfficer:\nMy superior clearly stated, \"Don't you dare let anyone near the site, you got it!?\" If I let you examine the site, my superior would get really angry at me!\nGumshoe:\nYou know, Mr. Edgeworth... I feel really bad for the guy, so why don't we do as he says?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... I suppose we might as well.\n\n\n\n\nShih-na or Kay Faraday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nKay, are you alright?\nKay:\nYou believe me, don't you, Mr. Edgeworth? You don't think I did it, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, of course I don't. And I promise to prove that it wasn't you.\nShih-na:\nThat's enough chit-chat. You can investigate all you like, but it's only a matter of time before we take her in. It would be wise of you to give up while you can.\nEdgeworth:\nNo, I don't think so. Kay isn't lying, and my investigation will prove that to be true.\nShih-na:\nGo ahead and try then, if you're that confident.\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't allow this to continue on this way. I must prove her innocence post haste!)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFireplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat's some fireplace! You know, it really gives this place a mansion-like quality, don't you think, sir!? Ooh! If these are a staple in every Babahlese house... ...then I bet Santa Claus pays them a visit, too.\nEdgeworth:\n(Just how old are you again, Detective...?)\n\n\n\n\nSafe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA small, personal safe...\nFranziska:\nThis was Mr. Coachen's office. So perhaps he stored his most important documents in here.\nEdgeworth:\nAh, of course it's locked. It appears we won't be able to open it without the key (Locked safe - The secretariat's office safe. It can't be opened without the key.).\n\n\n\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo our victim... was the secretariat of this embassy, I take it.\nFranziska:\nManny Coachen. I heard that he was an admirable person... very admirable.\nEdgeworth:\nThe cause of death is a stab to the base of his neck... He was lax in watching his back.\nFranziska:\nWe were fortunate that the fire missed our victim's body for the most part. If the fire had burned a bit longer, it would've made identifying him a hassle.\nEdgeworth:\n(So Mr. Coachen was stabbed to death in the middle of a raging fire...? What in the world happened inside this room?)\nNotes on Coachen's Body jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm? This man... Where do I know him from...?)\n\n\n\n\nWound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a knife wound.\nFranziska:\nIt's obvious what he was killed with, but I wonder if it's consistent with the wound?\nShih-na:\nIndeed.\n\n\n\n\nKnife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIs this knife the murder weapon...!?\nShih-na:\nSome preliminary testing has been conducted. According to the results, the blood on that matches the victim's blood. The blade's shape was also found to be consistent with the stab wound.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose this means that we now know that the crime was committed with this knife.\nGumshoe:\nThis knife's got some really fancy ornamentation going on, huh, sir? This thing practically screams \"ARTSY!\" at me, too! Although, it's also covered in blood, just like the last thing that I said was artsy...\nFranziska:\nHmm, but the handle is pristine, there's not a single drop of blood on it. Speaking of the handle... I believe it has a butterfly motif (Motif on knife handle - A butterfly-shaped guard adorns the handle of the murder weapon.). It's very beautiful.\nKnife data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nKnife (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIs this knife the murder weapon...!?\nShih-na:\nSome preliminary testing has been conducted. According to the results, the blood on that matches the victim's blood. The blade's shape was also found to be consistent with the stab wound.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose this means that we now know that the crime was committed with this knife.\nGumshoe:\nThis knife's got some really fancy ornamentation going on, huh, sir? This thing practically screams \"ARTSY!\" at me, too! Although, it's also covered in blood, just like the last thing that I said was artsy...\nFranziska:\nHmm, but the handle is pristine, there's not a single drop of blood on it. Speaking of the handle... I believe it has a butterfly motif. It's very beautiful.\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... There appears to be something in his pocket. ! This key! It can't be...! Isn't this the Yatagarasu's Key that was stolen seven years ago!?\nFranziska:\nWhat!? But that's...!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Seven years ag...oooh! You mean that case where I was framed, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it's the piece of evidence that stole the life of Kay's father seven years ago... ...which was then stolen by Calisto Yew.\nGumshoe:\nWh-What!? Mr. Faraday was killed with this key, sir!? I thought he was killed with a knife... Eeeek!\nFranziska:\nScruffy! At the very least, try to remember the details of crimes you were a suspect in!\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska, as you will recall... ...Detective Gumshoe was not present when Ms. Yew made her escape. Plus, even among law enforcement, only a few knew of this key's existence. I doubt that a new rookie at the time would've been made privy to such knowledge.\nGumshoe:\nOoonnngh... I feel like the victim right now, all trampled on, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... I suppose I'll just have to fill you in now. The secret to this key is...!\nLeads to examination of Yatagarasu's Key\n\n\n\nExamine butterfly=shaped key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's not that far-fetched to think that the end of this key was meant to be a butterfly. The key maker must've been a true patriot to have fashioned this after the national symbol.\n\n\n\n\nExamine button in handle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ohoooo!\"\n\n\nGumshoe:\nOhoooo! Wow, that's amazing, sir! It's like some kind of magic trick!\nYatagarasu's Key data jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nI knew it. This is the same exact piece of evidence that Ms. Yew took with her... I remember this beautiful pattern in the blade.\nFranziska:\nI remember this as well. It's a vine motif, isn't it?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it looks like two interwoven vines, crisscrossing down the blade.\nGumshoe:\nVines, sirs? I think it looks like a bunch of stars, if you ask me. It's one of those six-sided stars, just like the police mark on our IDs!\nEdgeworth:\nI... really don't think you can call these stars. (...To say that the detective's art sense is underdeveloped would be an understatement.)\nFranziska:\nThe real question is why was the Babahlese Embassy's secretariat holding this?\nEdgeworth:\nWhile we don't know how Mr. Coachen came to possess this key... ...we do know that this was stolen by the Yatagarasu from the Cohdopian Embassy.\nFranziska:\nThat's right. Mr. Faraday had written that fact down in his organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nI believe this means that further research is required into the country of Cohdopia.\nFranziska:\nWhy don't you ask Ambassador Palaeno about what he knows? Supposedly, he was a candidate to be the next Cohdopian ambassador once long ago. He should be able to answer any specific questions you may have.\n\n\n\n\nKey (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the Yatagarasu's Key... I wonder how it managed to return here?\nGumshoe:\nSo this key was stolen by Calisto Yew seven years ago, right?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, although originally, it was stolen from this very building.\nGumshoe:\nWell, then, maybe Ms. Yew just decided to bring it back.\nEdgeworth:\nI can't dismiss that possibility, however... (...it doesn't fit her modus operandi, given all of her other actions.)\n\n\n\n\n\nBody (after examining knife and key)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nButterfly on wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHeeeey! It's another butterfly!\nEdgeworth:\nI believe it is the symbol of the Republic of Babahl (Buttlerfly of Babahl - National symbol that adorns the national flag. Allebahst's flower is its counterpart.). A drawing this big on the wall of an embassy... It definitely conveys a sense of overwhelming patriotism.\nGumshoe:\nWell, I've got a lot of patriotism, too, sir! The reason I became a cop in the first place was because I wanted to protect our country!\nEdgeworth:\nYou may want to, Detective, however, I have yet to see the fruits of your desire.\nGumshoe:\nY-You don't have to be so blunt about it, sir!\n\n\n\n\nBroken ceiling fan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis ceiling fan must've fallen from the ceiling.\nGumshoe:\nA ceiling fan? What does one of those do?\nEdgeworth:\nExactly what it sounds like it does; it's a fan that is installed on one's ceiling.\nGumshoe:\nWell, if I had one of those in my room, I bet I'd go dizzy from staring at it as I slept.\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. In the real world, we close our eyes when we sleep.\n\n\n\n\nGolden statue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalaeno:\nBecause this is a national treasure, can I ask that you please not touch it? I'm afraid the only ones allowed to touch it are myself and the secretariat.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBut there is a possibility that it is related to the murder, wouldn't you agree?\nGumshoe:\nHey, Mr. Edgeworth... Why don't we give up for now? We can force them to let us investigate it later when we find some solid proof!\nEdgeworth:\n...I suppose I don't have a choice here. (This must be one of the Primidux Statues Kay was talking about earlier. ............ Is it just me or does this man look just like the Steel Samurai? They could be twins.)\nBabahl's Primidux Statue data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nGolden statue (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalaeno:\nBecause this is a national treasure, can I ask that you please not touch it? I'm afraid the only ones allowed to touch it are myself and the secretariat.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nBut there is a possibility that it is related to the murder, wouldn't you agree?\nGumshoe:\nHey, Mr. Edgeworth... Why don't we give up for now? We can force them to let us investigate it later when we find some solid proof!\nEdgeworth:\n...I suppose I don't have a choice here. (This must be one of the Primidux Statues Kay was talking about earlier. ............ Is it just me or does this man look just like the Steel Samurai? They could be twins.)\n\n\n\n\nKnife rack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth! There's still something on this display rack, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nKnives, huh... Although, the blades are all that remain of them, unfortunately.\nGumshoe:\nI guess the handles all got burnt off by the fire.\nPalaeno:\nAh... So even the knives fell victim to the fire...\nEdgeworth:\nAmbassador Palaeno, are these knives yours?\nPalaeno:\nWhy yes, they are. They are a special set of ornamental knives featuring the national symbol of Babahl. These butterfly-themed knives, along with Allebahst's own set of knives... ...are comprised of three knives each. But... But I can't believe the Babahlese ones have been reduced to this state...\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (Ornamental knives, huh? ...Hm? There's a small release on the tang of this blade.) Ambassador Palaeno, what is this notch here for...?\nPalaeno:\nOh, that! It's a feature of these knives wherein you can freely exchange the handles on them. So that we can change how they look to fit the situation, of course.\nEdgeworth:\nI see. So these knives were constructed so that the handles could be easily removed.\n\n\n\n\nShelves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese shelves are lined with American souvenirs and memorabilia.\nGumshoe:\nIt's really strange isn't it? I mean, I thought this was the Babahlese Embassy! So, umm, why are there so many American souvenirs, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps the Babahlese are studying American culture and our tourism industry...? If they have plans to make the Babahlese tourism industry truly flourish... ...then they would need to observe and study other countries' methods, I suppose.\nGumshoe:\nSpeaking of tourism, I got these from the blond guy earlier, sir. He said that if I bring these with me to Babahl, I can trade them in for a few buffets!\nEdgeworth:\nOh? So, how do you expect to travel to Babahl?\nGumshoe:\nWell, the whole world is connected by the oceans, sir! And for an all-you-can-eat buffet, I'd swim all the way to Babahl if I have to!\nEdgeworth:\n(Can a few simple coupons really motivate people to do such fantastic things?)\n\n\n\n\nBurnt objects by clock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere are still some burnt objects scattered on the floor.\nGumshoe:\nWell, burnt things get burnt and then they become burnt things, you know?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, because there is no way to prove that the burnt thing started out as a burnt thing.\nGumshoe:\nWas it a burnt thing, or was it not? I have no idea what's what anymore, sir...\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I suppose it's a bit hard for someone with a burnt-out light bulb to comprehend.\n\n\n\n\nGrandfather clock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt looks like this was once a magnificent grand father [sic] (changed from [grand grandfather] in the original release) clock, but it has fallen victim to the fire.\nGumshoe:\nHey, Mr. Edgeworth! Is it OK for me to talk about the clocks in my house, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nIf they're unrelated to the case, I hope that you will refrain from sharing, but...\nGumshoe:\nWell, there's this one clock that I made by myself, but the timer on it manages to auto...\nEdgeworth:\nThat's quite enough, Detective.\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnife\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is what took Mr. Coachen's life. Some of his blood is still on the blade.\nGumshoe:\nWow, I've been a detective for 7 years already? I've seen a lot of weapons in my days... ...but knives that were used to kill are always the hardest for me to bear.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, unlike guns, this is one weapon where you're likely to find the victim's blood on it.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, just like how this one is practically drenched in it, huh, sir?\nEdgeworth:\n(Despite that, it looks like the blood managed to miss the handle somehow.)\n\n\n\n\nOrnate butterfly on handle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is a lot of skilled detailing on this handle. I believe this is a butterfly.\nGumshoe:\nThis is one amazing ornamental knife. And I'm really glad that this beautiful butterfly wasn't ruined by blood.\nEdgeworth:\nThere is not even a drop of blood on it. It really is quite exquisite. So much so that even you can understand its beauty, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nHey, why do you always have to look down on my tastes, sir!? I know what I like, and this is really well-crafted!\nEdgeworth:\n(Why do I look down on his tastes...? Because, my dear Detective, I'm afraid your tastes are usually quite questionable...) ! This knife... It would appear that the handle is removable.\nGumshoe:\nI guess so people can change them whenever they feel like it. Sounds like fun, sir!\nEdgeworth:\n(I don't think people would remove the handle just for fun, Detective...)\n\n\n\n\n\nYatagarasu's Key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnife blade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is a vine motif to the ornamentation on this blade. Even if Detective Gumshoe claims to see a star motif in it. Between the blade and handle, there is a flower, and the key itself is a butterfly. This key was stolen by the Yatagarasu seven years ago from the Cohdopian Embassy... ...which suggests that this was made while Cohdopia still existed as a country.\n\n\n\n\nButton in handle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWe discovered this trick seven years ago, and with it, we were able to corner Ms. Yew. But who would've thought that I'd see this key again after all this time...\n\n\n\nButterfly-shaped key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's not that far-fetched to think that the end of this key was meant to be a butterfly.\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"We know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy.\"\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Stealing of secret\" and \"Franziska's return\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\"To steal your dirtiest secret\"... Is it possible that the \"dirty secret\" the Yatagarasu was out to steal is in this very room?\nFranziska:\n\"Dirty secret\"?\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska, you're in pursuit of some \"dirty\" underhanded dealings yourself, are you not? Something tells me that this is no coincidence.\nFranziska:\nIn that case then, the person I'm looking for is here in the Babahlese Embassy, huh? The head of the smuggling operation!\nEdgeworth:\n(I think I just might need to ask Franziska about her smuggling case in more depth.)\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe design on the knife's handle... ...it greatly resembles the special Babahlese species of butterfly.\nFranziska:\nIt does, doesn't it? Plus, it says right here.\nEdgeworth:\n\"This knife is property of the Republic of Babahl.\" Perhaps this means that the knife used in the crime was found right in this room...?\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir?\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhile you were on guard duty, did you notice anything unusual?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I was on watch inside the Embassy... ...but unfortunately, I didn't run into the Yatagarasu, sir. But I did talk to an officer who was on duty near the border between the two Embassies... ...who told me that not a single person crossed the boundary during the incident.\nEdgeworth:\nI see.\nGumshoe:\nThe investigations into the fire and the Yatagarasu are a mess thanks to both events! I'm so confused, sir! Should I be putting the fire out or investigating!? What do you think, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\n...Aren't you old enough to solve your own problems yet, Detective?\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI'd like an update on how the investigation is going.\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah... Well... it's going, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nIn other words... ...no one has any idea of what happened here, correct?\nGumshoe:\nTo put it simply... yeah, you got it, sir. But! We do know that something happened in this room, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nAny moron with a pair of eyes can see what happened, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nAww... W-Well, anyway! Let's investigate every single nook and cranny in this room, sir! We have to get serious, or Kay will end up getting arrested as the killer!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I am already well aware of that.\nGumshoe:\nOh...\nEdgeworth:\n(In order to find out what really happened here in this room... ...we will need to gather whatever information we can. It's time to take a good look.)\n\n\n\n\nThe crime scene (appears after clearing \"Yatagarasu\" Talk option with Franziska von Karma and examining knife near body, key on body, safe, and butterfly on wall)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like all that's left is a bunch of burnt stuff... But, well, I guess we've got all the info we need now, huh, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, it would appear so.\nGumshoe:\nBut you know, after all is said and done... ...I still have no idea of what's going on! Nope! Not a clue, sir! I just can't figure it out...\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Detective Gumshoe. It's nothing to get so worked up over.\nGumshoe:\nOh! You mean I should use that thing, right!? Umm... Defunction? No, that's not it. Projection? No, no, that's not it either. I think it sounded like... Oh, I've got it! \"Lock it\"!\nEdgeworth:\n...It's \"logic\", Detective. Logic. (Now that I've collected some information, the next step... ...is to connect a few of them together to see if I can make sense of this mess!)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey, it's your Prosecutor's Badge! This thing's really important, right? So what would happen if you lost it, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are you asking me such an ominous question?\nGumshoe:\nWell, because I've lost my police badge before, sir! I just wanted to tell you to be careful, sir! Because writing the explanation section on those requisition forms is really annoying!\nEdgeworth:\n(I believe SOMEONE needs to listen to his own advice a bit more often...)\n\n\n\n\nYatagarasu's Key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHmm... So this is the Yatagarasu's Key, huh? That's a really nifty trick they built into it. I can't stop playing with it! This is great! It's like one of those transforming toys, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nE-Evidence is not meant to entertain, Detective!\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you notice about this piece of evidence, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... Well, uh... I don't really sense anything special about it... But the embassy is a different story!\nEdgeworth:\n.........I see.\nGumshoe:\n...I'm not really sensing anything special from you either, sir...\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I'm sensing a special look at your monthly salary, Detective!\nAfter connecting \"Locked safe\" and \"Key used at Embassy\" Logic:\nEdgeworth:\nWe know for a fact that the Yatagarasu's Key was used at this embassy. Furthermore, we found it in the victim, Mr. Coachen's pocket. Which leads me to think that perhaps it is the key to the personal safe in this office.\nGumshoe:\nGood thinking, sir! Let's go try it out!\nEdgeworth:\n...It appears I was correct. (The key that was left to us in the victim's pocket... It literally turned out to be the key to the next piece of the truth!) Hmm... What do we have here?\nGumshoe:\nHey! There's nothing inside! D-Do you think the Yatagarasu made off with everything, sir?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, Detective, I believe all we need is a closer look.\nLeads to examination of safe\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nPiece of paper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"What is this here?\"\n\n\n\n\nOddly shaped hole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey, there's a hole here, sir.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's a little too oddly shaped for a latch hole...)\nGumshoe:\nWow, that's a funny shape for a latch hole, huh? It's shaped kinda... like a star, don't you think, sir!?\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, I would hardly call that shape a star... (There must be some reason for this hole...)\nGumshoe:\nWell, there's gotta be some reason why this hole's shaped so weirdly, you know!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Am I over thinking this? No, I don't think so...)\nGumshoe:\nHmm, maybe I'm over thinking things? Nah, there's no way I could ever do that, ho ho!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe, could you please be quiet for a second? You're frightening me.\n\n\n\n\nInside of safe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like such a serious safe, but there's not a scrap of paper inside... Which reminds me, the safe in your office is just as empty, huh, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's merely a coincidence that both safes are empty, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nWell, make that a triple coincidence because my piggy bank at home is empty, too...\nEdgeworth:\nI don't think there's anything coincidental about that, Detective.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is this here?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like the ripped corner of a piece of paper, sir.\nEdgeworth:\nNo, I don't think it's ripped; it seems more, to me, like it's stuck in the safe.\nGumshoe:\nHey, you're right! It won't budge an inch, not even when I tug on it! But I don't think I've ever seen paper stuck on the inside of a safe before...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nDetective, I think you have it backwards. It's not the paper that's strange... It's the safe.\nGumshoe:\nWhat do you mean?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat I mean is that the secret to this safe is that...\nit has two compartments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Even just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow.\"\nit's completely empty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is nothing in the safe.\nGumshoe:\nWell, yeah, there's nothing in the safe... but what's that got to do with anything?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... Why is the safe here in the first place?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... To keep really important things safe, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, precisely. However, there is nothing inside this safe... ...which points us to a clear contradiction of facts!\nGumshoe:\n.........But remember when we checked out your safe that time, and you answered...\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nRight now? Nothing.\n\n\nGumshoe:\n...when I asked you what was inside? Wouldn't that count as a contradiction, too, then?\nEdgeworth:\nArngh! (I suppose there are times when there just isn't anything that needs to be safeguarded. Alright, time to recollect my thoughts...)\nLeads back to:\n\"What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that...\"\nit has a crack there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... It is just as it appears to be. There is a crack in the safe, from where the lodged piece of paper is protruding!\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's exactly what it looks like, alright.\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...\nFranziska:\nWe already know, so there's no reason for you to state the obvious so confidently, Miles.\nEdgeworth:\nN...Nngh...\nGumshoe:\nHey, I feel like I'm a step closer to understanding what it's like to be Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(Drat... It appears the only thing I managed to do here is waste time.) Th-That wasn't what I had meant to say! The paper is sticking out, and that in itself is an important fact. So...\nLeads back to:\n\"What I mean is that the secret to this safe is that...\"\nEdgeworth:\nEven just eye-balling it, you can see that the inside is a bit too shallow. Furthermore, with the unnatural way the paper is stuck at the back of the safe... ...I'd say that there is an extra bit of space behind the back wall of this safe! In other words, this safe has a second compartment.\nGumshoe:\nWh-Whaaaaaaat!?\nFranziska:\nI suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner. However, if what you say is correct and there is a second compartment... ...how do we go about opening the door to it then? As you can see, there is no other lock or keyhole in sight.\nEdgeworth:\nActually, there is one more spot of interest to me on this safe.\nFranziska:\nOh?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, and I believe that spot is the keyhole to our mystery second lock!\nFranziska:\nThe safe and its locks... Alright then, since you are so sure of yourself, show me how you deduced your answer!\nLeads to examination of safe\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiece of paper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nI suppose that you are correct in asserting that the paper is stuck in an unnatural manner.

I'm sure you're right in what you said! Although... I'm not quite sure how that piece of evidence is related to the safe either...\nEdgeworth:\nArrngh... (It's bad enough for Franziska to doubt me, but Detective Gumshoe as well!? I must remain calm, and examine this safe once more for a clue on how to open it!)\nLeads to examination of safe\nEdgeworth:\nDoesn't the shape of this keyhole remind you of something, Franziska?\nFranziska:\nThe shape? It does look very familiar... However, I believe it's simply a latch hole for the safe's lock mechanism. It's just for keeping the door shut, nothing more.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIs that so? The person who used this safe... ...Mr. Coachen, made sure this safe had two compartments, in order to hide something. Do you honestly think someone like that would allow the keyhole to the hidden half... ...to look so obviously like a keyhole that even the average person could figure it out?\nFranziska:\n! ...You can't be serious...! Are you saying that this hole is the keyhole to the hidden compartment of this safe?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's precisely what I'm saying.\nFranziska:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I will prove to you right now... ...that the Yatagarasu's Key is the key that will open it!\nFranziska:\nFranziska:\nThe Yatagarasu's Key!? Miles Edgeworth! This had better be a very bad joke!\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, but this is no joke. The Yatagarasu's Key... ...is the very key that will open the second compartment of this safe.\nFranziska:\nWe know that this key opens the first compartment of the safe. But the keyhole you're talking about... ...is of an entirely different shape than that of the key!\nLeads to examination of Yatagarasu's Key\nExamine button in handle, then blade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let's go over this again, shall we?\"\nEdgeworth:\nLet's go over this again, shall we? The Yatagarasu's Key... ...was originally made to open Mr. Coachen's safe in the Cohdopian Embassy. We confirmed that as fact by opening the door to his safe with it. Now, let's take a look at the back end of the key. Looking at the knife portion head on, what do you see?\nFranziska:\nWhat are you talking... Aaah!\nEdgeworth:\nIt appears that you've come to understand what I'm talking about. When viewed head-on, the knife's blade is the exact same shape as the keyhole! The real function of the knife portion is to act as the key to the hidden portion of the safe.\nFranziska:\nB-But that's... preposterous!\nEdgeworth:\nBecause it looks like a knife and was used like one to kill Mr. Faraday seven years ago... ...we fell under the misconception that it was always meant to be a knife. But for both the safe and its key to conceal such clever tricks... ...whatever is hidden inside the secret section must be of incredible importance.\nFranziska:\n.........Then, it's even possible that what I've been searching for is inside! Scruffy! Hurry up and open that safe!\nGumshoe:\nEeeek! Y-Yes, sir! Opening it now, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nThese items... They're...!\nGumshoe:\nIt's a bunch of funny-shaped things. I guess they're pieces of art, huh, siiiiir!?\nFranziska:\nYou're in the way! Now, move, Scruffy!\nGumshoe:\nI didn't think I was in the way... *sniffle*\nFranziska:\nThese pieces of art...! They're identical to ones that have been stolen from various countries around the world!\nEdgeworth:\nI figured as much... These are the treasures this section of the safe was to hide from view! Hmm... I believe a more thorough examination is required.\nLeads to examination of safe\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOddly shaped hole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt appears that we've found the key that the Yatagarasu... ...no, Ms. Yew stole seven years ago.\nGumshoe:\nSince it was originally from this embassy, maybe she came back to return it...?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't think she's the type to be so kind as to do such a thing, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nUmm... OK, then what do you think, sir?\nEdgeworth:\n(Calisto Yew... For what reason did she steal the key...?)\n\n\n\n\nArt pieces\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese are pieces of stolen art from around the world...\nGumshoe:\nI wonder how much they're worth? Especially this one... Eeeeeek!\nFranziska:\nScruffy! Don't touch those valuable pieces of art with your filthy hands! Why, do you have any idea what would happen to you if one of them were to break?\nEdgeworth:\n(Is it just me, or did she hit one of the pieces of art just now...?)\n\n\n\n\nPapers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the document that we thought was stuck earlier. I wonder what it's about?\nGumshoe:\nBeats me, sir!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy don't we take a look at it first before we give up, Detective? Mr. Coachen's name is written here on the last page. (I wonder what the significance of this document is?)\n\n\n\n\nDoor to second compartment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nTo build this sort of trick into one's safe is really something...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, it's neat how this safe has two compartments, but what's really impressive... ...is that at the other end of the key was another key! I totally hadn't noticed!\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if Mr. Coachen was just paranoid or if he had secrets of that great a value.\nGumshoe:\nSpeaking of paranoid, I once sharpened both ends of my pencil. But then, when I went to erase something, I got all paranoid that I was gonna stab myself.\nEdgeworth:\nPlease refrain from dispensing your special brand of unrelated stories while on duty.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir...\n\n\n\n\n\nDeduce papers (after clearing \"Smuggling\" Talk option with Franziska von Karma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)\n\n\n\nPresent Cohdopian Paper Document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Take a good look at these documents, Franziska.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI believe this piece of evidence is somehow related.\nGumshoe:\nOh, I see!

(...I'm not sure that I can explain it... I guess it's not related after all.)\nGumshoe:\nCome on, sir! Hurry up and explain it to me!\nEdgeworth:\nI will. Eventually. Let's save it for another time when I have the proper time to explain it to you. (I suppose I should carefully examine everything one more time...)\nLeads to examination of safe\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYatagarasu's Key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnife blade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis Yatagarasu's Key was originally made to open the safe... ....in Babahlese Embassy's secretariat's office. And whilst the blade looks like a simple knife at first glance... ...when viewed head-on, it's actually the same shape as the second keyhole in the safe. This key was stolen by the Yatagarasu seven years ago from the Cohdopian Embassy... ...which suggests that this was made while Cohdopia still existed as a country.\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice anything?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI can't believe there's a secret door inside the safe... Guess the stuff inside must be really, really important!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, they appear to be quite important.\nGumshoe:\nThe little figures and stuff... I wonder how much those are worth?\nEdgeworth:\nKnowing that they are stolen merchandise, I would say they are probably priceless. Their value is probably worth more than what you could ever hope to make in your lifetime.\nGumshoe:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? You're kidding right, sir!? I-I mean, they're so small...\nEdgeworth:\n(Well, we're talking about purchasing it with YOUR salary, detective, so...)\nGumshoe:\nOk, then I guess those pieces of paper must be pretty valuable, too, right?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I assume so. I'm actually quite curious about them. (Even if they are not physically worth much, great care was taken to hide them. Which means they must be very important documents to someone. I wonder if the papers in the safe might be related to that other document...?)\nEdgeworth:\nTake a good look at these documents, Franziska.\nFranziska:\nIt says that there are three pages in total, and yet, there are only two here.\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect. Now take a look at the smuggling activity document in your possession. Tell me, is it not possible that your page was taken from this set of three?\nFranziska:\nWell, well... It certainly looks that way.\nEdgeworth:\nBy putting our multi-part puzzle together, we seem to have arrived at an answer. And it seems that you have now found what you were looking for.\nFranziska:\nYes, and with this, it has become crystal clear... ...that Mr. Coachen himself was responsible for the mass smuggling of Babahlese ink!\nEdgeworth:\nBabahlese ink?\nFranziska:\nBabahlese ink is a special product of the Republic of Babahl. However, due to a special reason, only a limited volume is ever exported.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that reason is...?\nFranziska:\nThat's classified. It's on a need to know basis, and you don't need to know. In any case, it seems that the head of the smuggling ring was our victim, Mr. Manny Coachen.\nEdgeworth:\nHis base was in an embassy, thus, it was hard for both our country and his to interfere. Making it the ideal conditions under which to run a smuggling operation.\nFranziska:\nArgh... but it's so frustrating. I lost the person I was to rain judgment down upon with my Whip of Justice.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, even if he is dead, we still have a responsibility to look into his misdeeds.\nFranziska:\nYou expect me to whip a dead man? ...Well, I'm not interested.\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska... You must know... ...that Manny Coachen was the suspect in the KG-8 Incident...\nFranziska:\nOf course I know! On top of being the head of the smuggling ring... ...there is the matter of what really happened in that case that needs to be resolved.\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColias Palaeno\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent Cohdopian Paper Document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalaeno:\nI can't believe that Babahlese ink was being used in such an evil scheme... And if people were to find out, that would really tarnish the global image of Babahl. Ah, this is really bad. Really, really bad. Ooh, Babahl's in a bind now... *sigh*\nEdgeworth:\n......... (Is it just me or do his words not match his facial expressions?)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\nPapers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe existence of this document in itself is quite important, isn't it?\nFranziska:\nYes, it proves that Manny Coachen was the ringleader of the smuggling operation.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose it does. (It really does look that way, however... ...I don't believe this shows us all that he was up to. And in order to find the truth behind his dealings, we'll need to continue investigating.)\nAfter connecting \"Motif on knife handle\" and \"Butterfly of Babahl\" Logic, and examining golden statue and knife rack:\nInvestigation Complete\nShih-na:\n...Are you done investigating?\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nShih-na:\nYou realize now, don't you? That this girl is the only one it could be. Now come along quietly, Yatagarasu... Kay Faraday. You are under arrest for the murder of Manny Coachen.\nKay:\nM...Mr. Edgeworth! Please, you have to believe me! I didn't do it! I chased the fake Yatagarasu in here... and he... he was already...\nShih-na:\nYou have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI'd like to help you reduce the number of mistaken arrests Interpol makes.\nShih-na:\n...What is that supposed to mean?\nEdgeworth:\nI believe I told you that Kay Faraday is not the culprit of this crime.\nShih-na:\n...Very well. I suppose I have no choice. I'll show you just how foolish your claims are!\nTestimony\n-- Why Arrest Kay? --\nShih-na:\nEven your police confirmed that the Yatagarasu infiltrated the Babahlese embassy tonight.\nUtilizing the confusion caused by the fire, the Yatagarasu snuck into this embassy.\nFurthermore, this girl claims to be the Yatagarasu.\nAnd most importantly, other than her, there was no one else in here with the body.\nEdgeworth:\nYour reason for suspecting Kay is because you think she is the Yatagarasu?\nShih-na:\n...Exactly. But it isn't just me. She calls herself the Yatagarasu.\nKay:\nArgh! Look, how many times do I have to tell you!? I was only out to capture the fake Yatagarasu!\nShih-na:\nImposter or not... it matters not. A Yatagarasu is a Yatagarasu.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well. Then I shall prove that Kay is not the Yatagarasu who killed Mr. Manny Coachen!\nShih-na:\n...Go ahead and try. Show me what the prosecutors of this country are made of.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: They may have confirmed it, but are you telling me that no one could catch the thief? If so, you're basically admitting that the Yatagarasu that committed murder eluded us! Shih-na: ......... Of course, I chased after the Yatagarasu that entered the Babahlese Embassy right away. And that is also why I'm making this arrest right now. Because at the end of my long chase... there was only this girl. Edgeworth: Nnnghoooh! Shih-na: In any case, this is what I believe happened tonight.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: The confusion caused by the fire...? Are you saying... that the Yatagarasu was not the arsonist who started the fire? Shih-na: A suspicious person in a long coat was spotted in the area. Officers in the area claim to have seen that person start the fire. Edgeworth: Hmph... It sounds like we have a phantom in our midst. Gumshoe: Umm... Yeah... Edgeworth: (In a way... he could be considered a phantom, with the way he randomly appears.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because she calls herself that, it doesn't prove that she is a killer. Shih-na: No, but it does give her a motive. The Yatagarasu sent a card saying, \"I will be there to steal your dirtiest secret.\" Furthermore, there are documents pertaining to some smuggling activity in this room. She obviously wanted to steal them... ...so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Edgeworth: I see... (Her logic is very sound. I expected nothing less of Agent Lang's secretary. However, that statement just now didn't sound right. It might just be the opening I need.) Adds statement \"She wanted to steal documents regarding smuggling, so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because she calls herself that, it doesn't prove that she is a killer. Shih-na: No, but it does give her a motive.

She obviously wanted to steal them... ...so she killed Mr. Coachen for the key. Edgeworth: I see... (Her logic is very sound. I expected nothing less of Agent Lang's secretary.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you're claiming that Kay knew that a foreign country's embassy had such documents? Shih-na: As stated in the calling card, the Yatagarasu was out to steal a \"dirty secret\"... ...which means that the goal tonight was to steal those smuggling activity documents. Kay: You have it all wrong! It was the fake that sent that card! Shih-na: ...Your words are meaningless. If you are truly innocent, then let's see some proof. Kay: Umm... Hey, Mr. Edgeworth! I leave it to you to handle this! Edgeworth: Yes, I'd rather you did. (The Yatagarasu's goal, huh...) Shih-na: You can claim she's innocent, but you can't change the facts I've already outlined.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I really don't think that being the first to discover the body makes her the killer by default. Shih-na: No, but if you saw the self-purported Yatagarasu standing in front of a body... ...wouldn't you get a little suspicious yourself? Edgeworth: Gnnrk! Even so... I'd still listen to what that person had to say before I passed judgement! Franziska: Hah, are you talking about yourself and those times when you were under suspicion? Edgeworth: I think the pain of being falsely accused is something you really should experience. Gumshoe: I, personally, know that feeling really well, sir! Kay: And given my situation, I now know exactly what it's like, too! Franziska: I'm fine with never experiencing it, ever. Shih-na: ...Are you done with your little group conference?\nEdgeworth: (So Agent Shih-na suspects Kay of murder simply because Kay is the Yatagarasu. But if I can prove that the Yatagarasu's goal is not related to murder... ...then I may be able to begin to reason with her!)",

I saw her holding the knife she used on the victim with my own eyes.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What...!?\nShih-na:\n...Allow me to tell you a bit more about the evidence that will put her away behind bars.\nTestimony\n-- Definitive Evidence --\nShih-na:\nThe knife wound on the body is consistent with the blade of the knife.\nThe knife with the butterfly handle is the murder weapon, which the killer was holding.\nI assume she obtained the knife from the display rack and used it on the victim.\nThe knife is a part of a special 3-piece set, which has a design like no other.\nThe evidence and testimony, it all points to the girl. There is no counterargument.\nEdgeworth:\nNnnnnrrrrrgh... Th-That is your definitive evidence...!?\nShih-na:\nYou see now that she is definitely the killer, right?\nKay:\nNo! Mr. Edgeworth, you've gotta believe me! I saw a suspicious person in a long black coat outside the Embassy, I swear!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd you came in here because you were chasing this suspicious person?\nKay:\nThat's right. I ran into this office only because I was chasing after that person... But when I entered the room, it was pitch black. I couldn't see a thing. I felt something on the ground next to my foot, so I turned on the lights, but then...\nKay:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\n???:\n...Who's there!?\nShih-na:\nThis is...\nShih-na:\nI came to this room upon hearing the girl's scream. And when I saw her holding the knife, I immediately restrained her.\nEdgeworth:\nSo the object Kay felt by her feet on the floor was the murder weapon...!?\nShih-na:\nI had the knife analyzed right away, but we failed to find anyone's (changed from [anyone] in the original release, correcting the typo) prints on it.\nKay:\nBut the suspicious person in the black coat who came into this room before me...!\nShih-na:\nShih-na:\nYou continue to insist there was such a person, but if there was, where did they go?\nKay:\nThat... I don't know. But I know they came in here!\nShih-na:\nShih-na:\nThat sounds like the desperate excuses of a suspected killer, not a trustworthy testimony. You understand, don't you? We can't trust this girl's words, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nGnnrk! (She has a point. Even if Kay's words are the truth... ...I must show that they are with some solid evidence!)\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth... I really didn't...!\nEdgeworth:\n! Kay... Don't worry. If you didn't do it, then there must exist a way for me to prove that.\nShih-na:\nShih-na:\nStill not giving up, I see. In that case, try to counter my argument, if you can.\nEdgeworth:\nDon't worry, I can and I will!\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Does this mean that you already have the results back? Shih-na: We have confirmed that the shape of the Babahlese knife's blade matches the wound. Please don't confuse the efficiency of Interpol's forensics teams with your own. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I won't if you don't underestimate our police force. And so we're clear, I'd hardly say your logic is sound, which you will see in a bit. Shih-na: If you can prove me wrong... please, by all means go ahead. Edgeworth: That has been my intention all along. Now, let us return to your testimony.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You mean to say that you saw Kay holding the murder weapon with your own eyes? Shih-na: I was also on the search for the Yatagarasu. When I heard that girl's scream coming from this room, I rushed over straight away. When I arrived, I saw that girl standing there motionless with the knife in her hands. Kay: But I already told you! I only came in here because I was also after the Yatagarasu! The suspicious person I saw came into this room! But when I entered, it was pitch dark. I felt something by my foot on the floor, so I turned on the lights, and then... Edgeworth: ...You found out that it was the murder weapon at your feet. Shih-na: How many times do I have to tell you? We can't trust the words of a suspect. Edgeworth: The only thing you'll accept is evidence, is it? Shih-na: That's the only acceptable way to counter an agent of Interpol on the scene of a crime. Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... Do you have some kind of evidence that can prove me innocent...? Edgeworth: I think I do, because there is one piece of evidence I find to be a bit... interesting. (I think I need to carefully examine that piece of evidence again.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I ask that you please refrain from speculation! Shih-na: It's a sound hypothesis derived from the evidence. ...There's no room for debate. Edgeworth: Arngh! ???: Franziska: Miles Edgeworth, know that an ungraceful loss will not be tolerated, my subordinate. Now, rebut her hypothesis with factual logic. Otherwise, what was your investigation for? Edgeworth: Yes, you are correct. Thank you. Franziska: Heh... Helping a subordinate out with advice is the job of any good superior. Edgeworth: (She seems to be rather enjoying herself. But she is correct, none the less [sic].) Agent Shih-na, please continue with your testimony.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: About the three-piece set, is there really no other like it? Shih-na: Let's ask Ambassador Palaeno for more details, shall we? Palaeno: The knives are indeed special. They have the butterfly, the symbol of the Republic of Babahl, engraved on them. And because there are only three of them in the world, they are very, very valuable. Edgeworth: (The national symbol, huh? Well, the knives are covered in the butterfly design...) Palaeno: Along with the Allebahstian set, our respective countries only have three knives each. Edgeworth: I see... Shih-na: Are you satisfied now? If so, let's continue.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: No, I believe there is still room for debate, and I'll thank you to not decide that for me. Shih-na: I didn't decide anything for you. I'm merely looking at reality the way it is. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Are you sure you're not just viewing the facts through rose-colored glasses? Shih-na: ............ Kay: Mr. Edgeworth... I think she's mad at you. Edgeworth: ...Perhaps. (But our definitions of reality are a tad different.) Shih-na: ...Are the two of you done chatting?\nEdgeworth: Agent Shih-na's proof is the Babahlese knife that Kay was allegedly holding.\nGumshoe: Yeah... So, um, how are you going to prove that Kay didn't do it, sir?\nEdgeworth: If Agent Shih-na wants to suspect Kay merely because Kay was the only one here... ...then I must show with evidence that Kay couldn't have committed the murder!\nGumshoe: Um, but do you have such evidence, sir?\nEdgeworth: Yes. There is one piece of evidence that seems very unnatural to me. ...And I believe it is my duty to point that out to Agent Shih-na.",

But is that really the truth?\nShih-na:\nWhat are you getting at?\nEdgeworth:\nI'd like for you to take a look at this. There is blood on the blade, and yet, there's not a speck of blood on the handle. This signifies that at the time of the crime, a different handle was attached to this blade. The knife that Kay was holding... ...had its handle switched, and was, in fact, not the real murder weapon!\nShih-na:\nIt wasn't... the real murder weapon!?\nEdgeworth:\nThis knife can be taken apart.

The killer must have pulled the murder weapon out of the victim's body... ...and proceeded to swap the knife's original handle with this butterfly one. It was all to create the illusion that Mr. Coachen was killed with the butterfly-themed knife!\nShih-na:\nUurrnngh...

For what purpose would she do such a thing!?\nShih-na:\nI don't care to know how a criminal thinks. The way they view the world is beyond the comprehension of a normal person like myself. Therefore, I wouldn't put anything past them, no matter how odd it may seem.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...Heh. The truth is right there in front of you, and this knife will show you the way! You will come to see that Kay is not and could not have been Mr. Coachen's killer!\nLeads to examination of Babahlese knife\nExamine flower engraving\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"What is this mark on here?\"\nExamine blade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is quite a bit of Mr. Coachen's blood on this blade. Thanks to being a prosecutor, I guess I have become accustomed to seeing blood... But this is not what is important right now!\nShih-na:\nWhat is this mark on here?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the mark of a flower. I assume you know what this means?\nShih-na:\nNo, not really. Butterflies rest on flowers all the time to drink their sweet nectar.\nEdgeworth:\n...And so they do. (However, would this butterfly really drink the nectar of this flower? The answer is clearly... not a chance! Now to prove the relationship between the butterfly and the flower with this!)\nPresent Embassy Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"! Y-You can't be serious...!\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis piece of evidence will make everything clear to you!\nShih-na:\nI can't quite figure out what you're trying to prove with that.\nEdgeworth:\nI! That is...\nFranziska:\nIf you are that uncertain, then I demand you try again!\nEdgeworth:\nNngh... Yes, that's exactly what I was about to do. (It would appear that this piece of evidence was not sufficient enough. I should think this over once again, calmly and rationally... The flower mark engraved into the blade... and the butterfly on the handle... There must be something that can put these two symbols into the correct context for us!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now to prove the relationship between the butterfly and the flower with this!\"\nShih-na:\n! Y-You can't be serious...!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... It appears that you've made the connection. The flower on this blade is designed after a certain country's national symbol. That's right... The Kingdom of Allebahst. In other words... This blade is from one of Allebahst's ornamental knives!\nShih-na:\nAah!\nEdgeworth:\nThis part of the knife handle... ...has Babahl's national symbol of the butterfly on it. Therefore, it is undeniably Babahlese in origin! But as we both know, you can't kill someone with just a knife handle. Incidentally, when exactly did the murder occur again, Agent Shih-na?\nShih-na:\nAck! After the fire had broken out...\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right. Kay entered the Babahlese Embassy after the fire had taken place. Furthermore, she had not been to the Allebahstian side of the building before then. On top of that, not a single person passed between the two countries during the fire... ...which means that Kay could not have transported an Allebahstian object over here! This makes it impossible for her to be the true killer!\nShih-na:\n..................!\nGumshoe:\nWhooooop! Way to go, Mr. Edgeworth, sir! What a great victory!\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nFranziska:\n..................\nShih-na:\n..................\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Hey, why is everyone so quiet...?\nEdgeworth:\n(I'm happy we got this far and cleared Kay's name... ...but what worries me now is what will happen next.)\nFranziska:\nFranziska:\nWhat is the meaning of this!? An Allebahstian knife, here...!?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you mean... how did this find its way to the Republic of Babahl? It didn't just find its way over. Rather, we should focus on how it was smuggled over!\nKay:\nYou know what!? My brain hurts thinking about it while we're just standing around! Thinking while you're on the run? Now THAT'S the way a real Great Thief operates!\nEdgeworth:\nKay...?\nKay:\nOh, thanks a bunch, Mr. Edgeworth! For proving me innocent, I mean! You believed in me the whole time, right? Tell me you did!\nEdgeworth:\nUmm, not really, but...\nKay:\nHa ha. Come on, you don't have to be shy about it!\nShih-na:\nShih-na:\n...Your argument is still not airtight.\nEdgeworth:\nWould you care to elaborate?\nShih-na:\nI understand now that the girl didn't commit the murder. However, there is still the possibility that she is the Yatagarasu.\nKay:\nThat again!? Look, how many times do I have to explain it to you!? I am the real Yatagarasu! I'm not like that fake one that goes around setting fires, OK!?\nShih-na:\nWhether you're the real deal or a fake, it doesn't really matter. All I have to say is this: I have my suspicions that this girl is the one who started the fire.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nPreposterous! On what grounds do you suspect her of such a thing!?\nShih-na:\nThe fact that she calls herself the Yatagarasu. That in itself is the (changed from [a] in the original release) most elegant proof.\nKay:\nMs. Shih-na.\nShih-na:\nYes?\nKay:\nI... have no intention of taking back any of what I've said.\nShih-na:\n...?\nKay:\nI am the Great Thief Yatagarasu. And I refuse to allow some imposter to claim that name as their own! The path of justice that my father pointed me towards... I will walk it the best I can!\nShih-na:\nIt's not good to be so stubborn. I hope you can understand that.\nKay:\nThanks a lot for the concern, Ms. Shih-na! Let me share something with you, too, as a token of my appreciation! Those sunglasses totally do nothing for you, so I'll steal them from you next time, OK!?\nShih-na:\nWh--!?\nKay:\nWell, I guess we'd better get going!\nFranziska:\nGoing...? To where?\nKay:\nTo the Kingdom of Allebahst! If we don't go, we won't know for sure, right?\nFranziska:\nI suppose not... We won't get anywhere simply by standing here thinking. To see where the Allebahstian knife came from... ...we'll have to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. Let's go, Miles Edgeworth. As you are my subordinate... I will not tolerate you bringing the investigation to a halt.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph...

Dismissed!\nSir!\nLang:\nYo, were you guys there the whole time? I got a call from Shih-na, and she's already filled me in. It sounds like you're out to get in my way again.\nEdgeworth:\nI have absolutely no intention of interrupting your investigation. I simply request that you grant me permission to investigate the Allebahstian Embassy.\nLang:\nHmph. And what if I say no?\nFranziska:\nFranziska:\nAgent Lang! This man is my subordinate. As I have received permission from the ambassador, he is to be extended the same rights.\nLang:\nSorry, sis, but it's not that simple. Allebahst has the strictest immigration regulations in the world, or didn't you know? Even among my elite men, about only half of them were admitted into the country. Besides, any more cooks in the kitchen, and we might spoil the soup, if you get what I mean.\nFranziska:\nHow dare you make such assumptions!?\nLang:\nDon't take this the wrong way, but I thought I was in charge of Allebahst, Ms. von Karma.\nFranziska:\nGrrr!\nLang:\nLook, try to understand, OK? Things over in Allebahst are a bit of a mess right now.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you mean by \"a bit of a mess\"?\nLang:\nNo one told you? We had an \"incident\" in Allebahst as well. This is what we call a decision based on the investigation, Mr. Prosecutor.\nKay:\nLook, Wolfy! Just let us in already!\n???:\n???:\nIs there a problem here, Agent Lang?\nLang:\nNot really. Just having a \"discussion\" about whether or not to let these guys in.\nFranziska:\nAmbassador Alba, I ask that you please allow these people to join the investigation.\nAlba:\nHaving a debate because of my country... I'm terribly sorry for placing you good people in that kind of situation... It is all because I lacked the strength to govern well.\nEdgeworth:\nPlease, it is nothing of the sort, Ambassador...\nAlba:\nYou weakling, Quercus! Curse your frailty and inability to affect change in your country!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What are you--!?\nAlba:\nThe thing is, investigations conducted in my country have been under Agent Lang. And it is my judgment that in order to minimize disruption in the investigation... ...I should leave everything up to Agent Lang.\nLang:\n...There, you see?\nKay:\nOh, no way!\n???:\nPalaeno:\nAmbassador Alba, I ask you to please reconsider letting them into Allebahst.\nAlba:\nWhat's that...?\nPalaeno:\nMy very own secretary has been murdered in the Babahlese Embassy. And he was apparently caught up in some very shady dealings completely unbeknownst to me. So I ask for your cooperation in our investigation. These aren't much, but I hope they can cover your travel expenses to Babahl someday.\nLang:\nAlright, alright. I get it. Even if you beg Ambassador Alba, I still have to give the final OK anyway.\nKay:\nAlright! You hear that, Mr. Edgeworth!? We're in!\nLang:\nNot so fast, my little crow-girl. You're still a witness in the Babahl murder. So I'd like you to please stay in the Republic of Babahl.\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please take good care of Kay for me.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nLang:\nSounds good to me. The fewer troublemakers, the better.\nKay:\n......... *rasp!*\nGumshoe:\n*rasp!*\nKay:\nHey, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nYes?\nKay:\nSo I wanted to ask for a while now, but... ...that lady over there, is she who I think she is!?\nEdgeworth:\nAh, that's right. I didn't introduce the two of you yet.\nFranziska:\nFranziska von Karma, the prosecutorial prodigy. ...It's nice to see you again.\nKay:\nOoh, I knew it! You're the whip lady!\nFranziska:\n.........You may address me as Ms. von Karma.\nKay:\nMs. von Karma, I leave the investigation of Allebahst in your hands!\nFranziska:\nThanks. Rest assured, I will outsmart both the smuggling ring and the Yatagarasu!\nEdgeworth:\n(The smuggling ring, huh... Perhaps I should ask Franziska a bit more about them before I head into Allebahst. Ah, and I mustn't forget to thank Ambassador Palaeno for all that he has done for me.)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska von Karma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou've made so much progress in your investigation in such a short period of time. It's truly amazing.\nFranziska:\nAgent Hicks, whose help I had requested, was cut down before he completed his task. There is no room for further failure in my perfect investigation.\nEdgeworth:\n......... In spite of that, I believe you were able to obtain some insight into the ring, correct?\nFranziska:\nIt was nothing. I simply made some deductions based on the smuggled item I was following.\nEdgeworth:\nYou mean the Babahlese ink? But why are there restrictions on the export of Babahlese ink to begin with?\nFranziska:\nThat's classified Interpol infor...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska! As your subordinate, I'm a part of your investigation now. Don't you think it would be beneficial if I was [sic] as well-informed as you?\nFranziska:\n.........Point taken. Very well, I'll fill you in. Recently. we discovered some very well-made counterfeit bills circulating in Zheng Fa.\nEdgeworth:\nCounterfeit bills?\nFranziska:\nYes... As you may have deduced... ...the counterfeits are being made with Babahl's special Babahlese ink. And it's virtually impossible to distinguish bills made with Babahlese ink from real ones. Thus, it was only natural for Interpol to keep an eye on the Republic of Babahl.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's where this document comes into play, correct?\nFranziska:\nCorrect. Mr. Coachen was smuggling large amounts of Babahlese ink. Furthermore, he was charged with running the Embassy's printing equipment. That's all the evidence I need to know that he was the head of the smuggling ring. However, there remains one tiny problem.\nEdgeworth:\nLet me guess. You still have yet to find the counterfeit bills or the smuggled ink?\nFranziska:\nYes, and while we're listing things, I might as well add the counterfeit plates to the pile. Since we haven't been able to locate any of these items in the Babahlese Embassy... ...we're looking into the Allebahstian Embassy next. It doesn't matter where they're hidden, mark my words, I will find them.\nCounterfeit Bills data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nFranziska von Karma (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou've made so much progress in your investigation in such a short period of time. It's truly amazing.\nFranziska:\nAgent Hicks, whose help I had requested, was cut down before he completed his task. There is no room for further failure in my perfect investigation.\nEdgeworth:\n......... In spite of that, I believe you were able to obtain some insight into the ring, correct?\nFranziska:\nIt was nothing. I simply made some deductions based on the smuggled item I was following.\nEdgeworth:\nYou mean the Babahlese ink? But why are there restrictions on the export of Babahlese ink to begin with?\nFranziska:\nThat's classified Interpol infor...\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska! As your subordinate, I'm a part of your investigation now. Don't you think it would be beneficial if I was [sic] as well-informed as you?\nFranziska:\n.........Point taken. Very well, I'll fill you in. Recently. we discovered some very well-made counterfeit bills circulating in Zheng Fa.\nEdgeworth:\nCounterfeit bills?\nFranziska:\nYes...

Because it's about all I can do for you, I'm afraid. I only ask that you please bring Manny's killer to justice.\nEdgeworth:\nI will, Ambassador. On my honor.\nPalaeno:\nWooow, you're so sensational! You've really piqued my curiosity! I know they aren't much, but know that I'm giving them to you wholeheartedly.\nEdgeworth:\nNo, that's quite alright.\nPalaeno:\nOh, well... How about this, then?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what exactly is it?\nPalaeno:\nIt's fountain pen ink. Known as \"Babahlese ink\", it's made exclusively in Babahl.\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is Babahlese ink...\nPalaeno:\nWe make it from whitcrystal oil, which is mined through our mineral mines. Please accept this ink. One dip of your fountain pen in this... ...and you can write for hours in your organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nHow fortunate for me. The ink in my pen just happened to have run out. I gladly accept your gracious gift.\nBabahlese Ink data jotted down in my Organizer.\nPalaeno:\nGreat! Wonderful! I guarantee to you that writing with our ink is an unforgettable experience. And since we don't export it... ...if you run out, you're always welcome to come and visit our fair nation!\nEdgeworth:\n(Talk about cornering the customer along with the market...)\n\n\n\n\nColias Palaeno (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAmbassador Palaeno, I am in your debt.\nPalaeno:\nNo, no, it's nothing.

Please, feel free to enter the Flower Nation, the Kingdom of Allebahst.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm, the \"Flower Nation\", you say? Well, the garden certainly lives up to that name.\nGuard:\nYes, it does! Our rose garden, which is in full bloom right now, is really something else!\nEdgeworth:\nOh, if only it wasn't [sic]. I could enjoy myself a bit more then.\n\n\n\n\nKay Faraday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nKay... I'm glad you were not hurt, but please refrain from such recklessness, alright? What if you had run into the Yatagarasu? You could've been killed.\nKay:\nSorry to make you worry like that... I'll be more careful from now on.\nEdgeworth:\nGood girl. It's good to conduct some self-reflection every once in a while.\nKay:\nEheheheh... It's funny, you know. When I talk with you, Mr. Edgeworth... ...it's like I'm talking with my father.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I-Is that so...? (Do I really seem that old to her...?)\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe, I'm counting on you to keep Kay safe.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir! You just leave eeeeeverything to me, sir!\nKay:\nAnd don't worry, I'll take good care of Gummy for you!\nGumshoe:\nWe'll go investigate into the Babahl side of things together! Right, Kay!?\nKay:\nThat's right, Gummy!\nEdgeworth:\n(...All they're missing is the last stooge.)\n\n\n\n\nGuard by right door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... May I ask you to please move out of the way?\nGuard:\nI'm sorry, sir, but we are currently clearing the area beyond of fallen, burnt brush. I ask for your patience until we are done.\nEdgeworth:\nVery well... Oh, and I hope the brush-clearing goes smoothly.\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag by left door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe national flag of the Kingdom of Allebahst is on display here. The crest on it features a flower. The knife with the flower design on it that we found in the Babahlese Embassy... It would appear that it is definitely connected to the Kingdom of Allebahst.\n\n\n\n\nWindow by left door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I can see the courtyard and the Allebahstian Embassy through this window. But this side is under the same dire straits as the Babahlese side. An incident has occurred on both sides of this one building. Why must fate make everything in my life so full of complexities?)\n\n\n\n\nFlowers on left side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese flowers are a gift from the Gatewater Imperial Hotel. It appears that their business has boomed since they became a Steel Samurai sponsor.\n\n\n\n\nPamphlets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere are stacks of pamphlets about the two embassies here.\nPalaeno:\nOh, Mr. Edgeworth. Please take as many as you would like! You'll find that you can cut out the last page and use it as a coupon.\nEdgeworth:\nI'm afraid I must decline, as I have little interest in them.\nPalaeno:\nWait, I thought Americans loved coupons? That man in the green coat earlier was beyond ecstatic when I gave him some.\nEdgeworth:\nAmbassador Palaeno, I ask that you please not think of him as representative of all Americans.\n\n\n\n\nCenter door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe Steel Samurai and Jammin' Ninja stage shows were held just beyond these doors. After the Jammin' Ninja's show ended, we came out here, and were greeted with a fire... ...then the appearance of the Yatagarasu, and a murder; we're far from solving anything yet.\n\n\n\n\nTV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is a flat-panel, a VCR, and a row of Steel Samurai videos on this table. There might be a clue among these... I had better check the titles of these videos. My my, the things I put myself through for the sake of the investigation.\n\n\n\n\nFlowers on right side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese flowers are a gift from Global Studios. They seem to be prospering quite a bit, thanks to their constant stream of hit shows.\n\n\n\n\nWindow by right door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(The Babahlese Embassy is just outside this window. The burn marks on it look pretty bad. It's a shame that they were in the middle of renovations. The fire did little to help there. And behind me, Ambassador Palaeno's dry smile hides the tears in his eyes...)\n\n\n\n\nFlag by right door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe national flag of the Republic of Babahl is on display here. The crest on it features a butterfly. The Babahlese Embassy, which sits to the right of the theater... ...and the Allebahstian Embassy which sits to the left... Something has happened in each of the two embassies. I sense that unconventional methods will be required to solve both of these mysteries.\nAfter talking with Franziska von Karma and Colias Palaeno:\nEdgeworth:\nWell, shall we get going?\n???:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's wrong, Kay?\nKay:\nI didn't get permission to enter Allebahst... ...so we're going to go gather whatever info we can over on the Babahlese side, OK!?\nEdgeworth:\nAlright, I'm counting on you two.\nKay:\nRight, and I'm counting on you and Ms. von Karma to sniff out clues in Allebahst! Oh, and Mr. Edgeworth! If you happen to come across my phony, you let me know, OK!? If you tell me, I'll rush on over straight away no matter where you are!\nEdgeworth:\n.................. I'll let you know when the time comes.\nMarch 14, 8:17 PM\nAllebahstian Embassy - Ambassador's Office\nEdgeworth:\n(...Hm?) Gwoooooooh!\nFranziska:\nWhat do you think you're doing to my subordinate!?\nEdgeworth:\nY...You're...!\n???:\nEdgey...! Oh, thank the heavens you're here...! I'm in a really, really big pickle, Your Lordship! The Raven, it appeared, poof! And then disappeared, swoosh! And though I am the Steel Samurai, my sword, it... Waaaaaaaaah! I'm so confused, I don't know what anything means anymore!\nFranziska:\nWho is this fruitcake!?\nLarry:\nI am Larry of the House of Butz: Married Man of Neo Olde Tokyo, m'lady!\nFranziska:\nNow I remember. This... person is one of your friends, isn't he, Miles?\nEdgeworth:\nYes, frighteningly enough... he is.\nLarry:\nHey! What's up with that answer!? Your best bud is in a bind, and you act like it's no big deal!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat sort of \"bind\" are we talking about here...?\nLarry:\nThe suspect kind! I accidentally became a suspect in a murdeeeeeer!\nEdgeworth:\nI see. That is quite the bind.\nFranziska:\n...Not that we're in the least bit surprised.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, I pretty much expected this news... ...from the instant I saw this unlucky face. (His name is Larry Butz. I've known him since grade school, and for as long as I've known him... ...he has been the world's largest source of Trouble with a capital T.)\nLarry:\nHey! What kind of introduction is that!? You're so mean, Edgey! If you're not careful, you might find your tiny number of friends go down by one!\nEdgeworth:\nThat was uncalled for. Besides, you're............ Wait, hold on. Laaaaaaryyyy! It was you!? YOU'RE the one who wrote my Steel Samurai autograph!?\nLarry:\nHm? Oh, you didn't notice earlier? I even winked at you through my headpiece.\nFranziska:\n.........What's going on? And why are you beet-red?\nEdgeworth:\nSorry... but could you not speak to me right now...?\n???:\nLang:\nOh, sorry, am I interrupting your comical, yet melodramatic play?\nEdgeworth:\n! .........Aha. So this is the incident you mentioned earlier.\nLang:\nMr. Prosecutor, this man... this childhood friend of yours... is our prime suspect. Of what, you ask? Of the murder of a man who had snuck into this embassy, Mask☆DeMasque II!\nEdgeworth:\nMask☆DeMasque II...? .................. (Only Larry could get himself into yet another mess as fine as this. But no matter what the facts seem to say, Larry is not the type to commit murder. Still, it's a rather daunting stroke of misfortune I've struck. I have to prove... that Larry Butz is innocent of all wrongdoing!)\nMIB:\nShifu! We've identified the victim!\nLang:\nGood work. I'll take that report now.\nEdgeworth:\nAgent Lang, would you mind if I took a peek at it as well?\nLang:\nWhat did I tell you earlier, Mr. Prosecutor? Don't get in my way! There's only enough flesh here to feed one wolf, and that one is me! So, no, you may not take a \"peek\".\nEdgeworth:\nBut Agent Lang...!\n???:\nBadd:\n...Agent Lang. Will you... allow an investigator such as myself... to take a look?\nLang:\nAh, yes. Of course. ...You, let the detective see the file.\nEdgeworth:\nYou're... Detective Badd!\nBadd:\nYou're... the prosecutor, Mr. Edgeworth, right?\nEdgeworth:\nFancy meeting you here, Detective.\nBadd:\nYou weren't expecting me...? Ever since that day seven years ago... I've chased after the Yatagarasu... non-stop. I even pressured Interpol... into keeping me in the loop... in case a card was ever found.\nEdgeworth:\n(What incredible dedication to the case.)\nLang:\nDetective Badd knows the Yatagarasu's M. O. very well. And his passion for the chase hasn't died down in these seven long years. It's something... I can respect. But, Detective Badd, I must ask: are you going to make an ally out of this prosecutor?\nBadd:\nMy only goal is to arrest the Yatagarasu. If he can get to the bottom of this case, then I'm willing to share info with him.\nEdgeworth:\nI am in your debt, Detective Badd.\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAbout the murder of DeMasque II... Would you be willing to fill me in on a few of the details?\nBadd:\nWhen the Yatagarasu showed up... Agent Lang and I took ourselves off guard duty... ...and put ourselves in charge of directing things... at this crime scene. Taking advantage of the chaos... ...DeMasque II... he broke into this embassy... Probably... to steal some treasure or another...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I suppose he lost his life when he was forced to fight someone else in this room?\n\n\n\n\nSuspect (appears after \"Initial investigation\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhy exactly was that man placed under arrest, Detective?\nBadd:\nThat... samurai?\nEdgeworth:\nHe was born looking suspicious, but not for the reasons you suspect, I assure you. As you can plainly see, he is completely harmless.\nBadd:\nWell, it was just a random guess... It's not like he's actually under arrest... Tonight... here, at the Allebahstian Embassy... ...Ambassador Alba... was to give a commemorative speech... And that's when... the Yatagarasu showed. But keep in mind... the Yatagarasu isn't who I'm talking about right now... Those seats... for the guests who had been called to sit in them... were empty.\nEdgeworth:\nA no-show...? Who was it that failed to take their seat?\nBadd:\nThe Steel Samurai. Until the speech was to begin, each member of the entire Steel Samurai family... ...was to wait in a separate room, However, for some weird reason... ...that man... was spotted in a different location than his assigned room... at that time.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd where was he?\nBadd:\nHe was on the roof... with one of his legs down a chimney... ...That chimney... leads directly into this room...\nEdgeworth:\nNnrrrgh...! (Larry Butz...! You've really outdone yourself this time! What were you thinking!?)\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes on Coachen's Body or Cohdopian Paper Document\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder if you might take a look at this, Detective Badd?\nBadd:\nYeah... I heard. Coachen's dead... ...What a waste. ............\nEdgeworth:\n(He's staring at his mirror with his eyes unfocused and his jaw clenched tight...)\n\n\n\n\nYatagarasu's Key\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Badd, this is something you absolutely need to see.\nBadd:\n! What... is that doing here? I've been looking for that... for seven long years. Never in my wildest dreams... did I imagine... this turn of events. Without a doubt... this means that \"she\"... is involved. That Yew woman!\n\n\n\n\nCounterfeit Bills or Babahlese Ink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Badd, if you could please take a look at this for me?\nBadd:\n...I see. The truth... that lies beyond this piece of evidence... is not going to be fun. Are you ready to take it on?\nEdgeworth:\nOf course I am!\nBadd:\nI don't know how close to the truth you are... ...but there are only a few things... I can say. So listen up, and listen well... Don't ever lose your detective's spirit.\nEdgeworth:\n(That would be a good piece of advice... if I was [sic] a detective.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Badd, I'm wondering if you might be able to tell me something about this?\nBadd:\n...Sorry, but I don't give a hoot about things that aren't related to the Yatagarasu...\nFranziska:\nHeh... It looks like nothing about you has changed in these seven years, huh?\nBadd:\nHmph... Daughter of Von Karma, you're still just a sapling of a prosecutor, so..\nFranziska:\nArngh! I-I'll have you know that I've already grown into a stately tree of a prosecutor!\nBadd:\n...Heh... Is that right...?\nEdgeworth:\n(Is he just toying with Franziska...? He seems to be enjoying this quite a bit.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case, I believe it's high time for me to start my investigation.\nBegin Investigation\nAllebahstian Embassy - Ambassador's Office\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarry Butz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, there are a few things I need to ask you about.\nLarry:\nHey, how about that!? I've got a few things I've gotta ask you, too!\nEdgeworth:\n......... What is it?\nLarry:\nIt's like... both you and him... How is it that the two of you always manage to have some cute or hot girl by your side!? And Franzy! What about that promise you made to me!?\nFranziska:\nPromise...? What promise...?\nLarry:\nThe one where you said you would model for my next book, \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip\"! Yeeoowww!\nFranziska:\nI made no such promise!\nEdgeworth:\n(Ever since grade school, we've had a certain saying about Larry. \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" One needs to look no further than this man to find the King of Troublemakers!)\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nAs I recall, aren't you calling yourself Laurice Dounim now?\nLarry:\nThat's \"Deauxnim\"! Laurice Deauxnim! Get that straight in your head, Edgey! Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!\nFranziska:\nNow I remember... You're that rude, pale imitation of a real artist.\nLarry:\nNo, no, no! You've got it all wrong. I gave up on that whole Laurice business! Besides, when Banjolina left me and my heart in pieces... ...that's when Mindy walked into my life. She's been so good to me that I wanted to help her in some way... ...and I figured I could through this Steel Samurai outfit!\nFranziska:\nYour inane blathering makes less and less sense each time we meet.\nEdgeworth:\nI believe he's saying that he picked up this part-time job as the Steel Samurai so that... ...he may attempt to capture the heart of the actress who plays the Pink Princess.\nLarry:\nYou got it! I knew you'd know what I meant, Edgey!\nEdgeworth:\n(Not really. It's not so much as I understood... ...but a simple deduction based on your usual modus operandi, Larry.)\n\n\n\n\nTime of the murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, I'd like you to confess right now... to everything you did tonight.\nLarry:\nC-C-Confess!? Hey! Don't tell me you suspect me, too!\nEdgeworth:\nNonsense. I don't believe you have the mental acuity needed to plan and execute a murder. However, we are talking about you here, so I find it hard to believe that nothing happened. For past experience has taught me that you are always at the center of some insane event!\nLarry:\nE-E-Edgey! How can you be so mean, stabbing me with your words like that!?\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, I don't have the time to search out a key to unlock your heart this time. So I suggest that you cooperate and tell me what you know.\nLarry:\nOK, OK! I get it! Just stop Franzy from whipping me from behind! So... I guess you know what I did, right, Edgey?\nEdgeworth:\n...I can't even begin to imagine. However... ...I imagine that whatever you were up to was probably beyond my imagination. So you will tell me what exactly you did, Larry!\nLarry:\nNope, not yet, Edgey! It'll take more than that to loosen my lips! A lot moooooooooooore!\nFranziska:\nConfess. Now.\nLarry:\nOoooghnnn... OK, well, I was up on the roof.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd why exactly were you up there?\nLarry:\nOh, you know, that wintry custom and the legendary hero!\nFranziska:\nLegendary...?\nEdgeworth:\nHero...?\nLarry:\nSanta Claus!\nFranziska:\nSanta...\nEdgeworth:\nClaus...\nLarry:\nI wanted to do that thing he does, so I climbed up to one of the chimneys! But when I got there, there was smoke pouring out of the chimney (Smoke from chimney - Smoke was pouring out of the chimney when Larry thought to climb down it.).\nEdgeworth:\n...And?\nLarry:\nWell, I couldn't go down the chimney with smoke coming up, right? So, I gave up.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, you do realize that Santa Claus does not exist, right?\nLarry:\nOf course I know! I did graduate from junior high, you know?\nEdgeworth:\nThen you should also understand this: If Santa was [sic] real... he would be the biggest unlawful trespasser in history!\nLarry:\nAw, cruuuuuuuuuuud!\nEdgeworth:\nIt is your attempt to imitate Santa that has landed you as prime suspect in this murder!\nLarry:\nCome on, man. What's so wrong with pretending to be Santa...?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nLet's start with the fact that it will be the ides of March in a matter of hours. Santa only visits homes on December 24th! That's in December, you nitwit!\nLarry:\nNooooooooooooooooooooooo! Hey, wait a sec! We're not in court!\n\n\n\n\nMurder weapon (appears after examining sword by body)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, about the Samurai Sword that was used as the murder weapon...\nLarry:\nOh, that. Well, I shook hands with the ambassador in this room, you know.\nEdgeworth:\nYes.. apparently you did.\nLarry:\nAnd, well, I totally forgot about it and left it behind when I left afterwards! You wanna talk about shock, I was the most shocked of all when I heard it killed someone! Shooooooooooocked!\nFranziska:\nFoolish fool looking especially foolish for foolishly stating such a foolish excuse... You forgot to take something that big with you!? Who would believe such a tale!?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Sorry, Ms. von Karma, but I believe him. Because if anyone could forget something like that, it would be Larry.\nLarry:\nEdgeyyyy... You believe meeeee...! I just knew that our friendship is something special!\nEdgeworth:\n(Anyway... even if Larry had simply forgotten the sword and left it behind... ...that, in no way, clears his name. Which means that I will have to prove his innocence from a different angle.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteel Samurai's Autograph or Photo with Steel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarry:\nOh, hey, it's the Steel Samurai.\nEdgeworth:\nI want you to answer this question for me, Larry, and depending on the answer, I may let you live. The Steel Samurai that was up there on that stage... Was that really you?\nLarry:\nYup, sure was!\nEdgeworth:\nL-Laaaarrrrryyyyyyyyy! Yooooooooooou...!!\nLarry:\nSteel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\nEdgeworth:\n! (I was moved by the performance of this man!? This completely useless, worthless bum!? I fear I may never recover from this...)\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Spear or Samurai Sword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarry:\nHey! That's an official Steel Samurai weapon! Huh? What? You want me to do it? Oh, you have no idea how many fans ask that of me!\nEdgeworth:\n? What are you prattling on about now?\nLarry:\nSteel Samurai Sushi Slash (changed from [Slice] in the original release)!\nEdgeworth:\n!\nLarry:\nHow was that? I bet it sent shivers up your spine!\nEdgeworth:\n......... (Ack! I let myself get caught up in being a spectator! How could I have failed myself!?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, I wonder if you might know what this is?\nLarry:\nNope, not a clue!\nEdgeworth:\nYou didn't even look at it!\nLarry:\nNah, that's because the only thing I can see right now is the form of my lovely Franzy!\nFranziska:\nOh? In that case, allow me to help you sear my form into you for all eternity!\nLarry:\nEek! Aaaah! Whippity-Whip Triiiiip!\nEdgeworth:\nNow THIS is a trip I'm willing to endorse, especially if we can finally get some peace here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShi-Long Lang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLang:\nYou did some investigating over in the Babahlese Embassy, too, right?\nEdgeworth:\nI did. Is there a problem?\nLang:\nLang Zi says: \"A wolf who aims to hunt for two rabbits at once...\"\nEdgeworth:\nI believe the idiom you require is, \"He who runs after two hares will catch neither.\"\nLang:\nHeh. A REAL wolf can catch both.\nEdgeworth:\nI see. So what are you trying to say, seeing as how I am currently handling two cases?\nLang:\nHeh... Suit yourself. But don't say I didn't warn you.\n\n\n\n\nMIB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMIB:\nNo matter how hard you try, you'll never be a necessity in our Shifu's investigation!\nEdgeworth:\nIs that a fact? But no matter how good he is, he is bound to overlook something.\nMIB:\n! If you insult our Shifu, then prepare to be punished!\nFranziska:\nOh? And how exactly would you punish us?\nMIB:\nEvery investigator under Shifu's command will work to disrupt your investigation!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Vindictive much?)\n\n\n\n\nTyrell Badd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent DeMasque II's Note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadd:\nSo... he clutched this note... as he went about his business... ...He was a poor excuse for a criminal... On top of which... he was only following in someone else's footsteps... What a small fry. I've been a detective for a long time. I can see straight through these people.\nEdgeworth:\n(He really has a different air about him. Now if only Gumshoe could understand that and be more like Detective Badd...)\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlants in lower left corner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nThere are decorative plants here as well... This room is overflowing with nature.\nEdgeworth:\nHumans used to live in the grandeur of nature once, long ago. I believe I'm not mistaken in thinking that those people truly loved nature.\nFranziska:\n...Hmph. This is coming from a man who loves shows featuring costumed actors.\nEdgeworth:\n(Arngh! She just had to go there again, didn't she?)\n\n\n\n\nGrandfather clock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere was a grandfather clock just like this one earlier in the Babahlese Embassy. You know, symmetry is a fine thing, but their interior design really suffers for it.\nFranziska:\nReally? I think this clock actually fits the décor of this room quite well.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose the wood does suit the all-natural atmosphere of this room.\nFranziska:\nIts design and the material it's made of strikes a good balance with the plants.\nLarry:\nHey! You two! Now's not the time to be talking about interior decorating, you know! Hurry up and save me!\nFranziska:\nBe quiet!\nLarry:\nAck!\nFranziska:\nThis is all a part of my elite investigation. All you need to do is be quiet and watch.\nEdgeworth:\n(Actually, I do believe Larry has a point for once.)\n\n\n\n\nPlants by knife rack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nWhat is that plant supposed to be?\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska, can't you see that it's supposed to be a likeness of Ambassador Alba?\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth! As a subordinate, you have a lot of nerve telling me what to think! ...I look forward to your salary assessment next month.\nEdgeworth:\n(You are deluding yourself if you think you have any control over that!)\n\n\n\n\nKnife rack area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere are some weapons on display on this wall. A crossbow... and under that... ...a set of knives bearing a flower motif. They must be the counterparts to the Babahlese knives. Which means that the blades inside these scabbards... ...should match the blade that was used to kill Mr. Coachen. (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nWhat is that plant supposed to be?\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska, can't you see that it's supposed to be a likeness of Ambassador Alba?\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth! As a subordinate, you have a lot of nerve telling me what to think! ...I look forward to your salary assessment next month.\nEdgeworth:\n(You are deluding yourself if you think you have any control over that!)\n\n\n\n\nSpear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the Steel Samurai's primary weapon, the Samurai Spear.\nLarry:\nIsn't it awesome!? I totally fell for this thing! It's sleek and shiny, just like my heart! It comes at you like, whoosh! When you hold it, you just wanna live life like, BAM!\nEdgeworth:\nYou'd do well to watch what you say, Larry. (Although, it is just as Larry says. The spear is quite the symbol of valor. However, speaking of spears... ...aren't you supposed to use them by thrusting the point straight into your opponent...? ...I'm not entirely convinced this spear is up to the task.)\nLarry:\nWhat's wrong, Edgey? You're just staring off into the distance! Oh! I get it! Tell you what. I'll tell the studio to make you one, OK? But this one's mine!\nEdgeworth:\nDid I say anything about wanting one!? (Maybe I can shut him up if I show him the piece of evidence... ...that will point something out about this spear.)\n\n\n\n\nCrossbow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Why is there a weapon on display in a place like this?)\nFranziska:\nI wonder why there are no whips on display here?\n\n\n\n\nKnife rack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nKnives adorned with flowers are on display here. I suspect that these are the counterparts to the Babahlese knives. The blades of these knives should match the blade of the knife that killed Mr. Coachen. Wh--!? One of the knives is missing its blade. Let's see if the two pieces, the blade and handle, fit each other.\nFranziska:\nIt would appear that they fit together quite well, almost seamlessly.\nEdgeworth:\nThen this means that an Allebahstian knife did find its way into Babahl! But how...?\n\n\n\n\nKnife rack (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe knife display is set up almost identically to the one in the Babahlese Embassy.\nFranziska:\nI believe Ambassador Palaeno said that both Allebahst and Babahl... ...have a set of three knives each.\nEdgeworth:\nIt would appear that way. Also, the knives here all have flowers on their handles.\nFranziska:\nThe two countries embellished their knives with their own national symbols, I guess. And just like the Yatagarasu's Key, they are exquisitely made. This level of craftsmanship makes these knives worthy of being owned by me.\nEdgeworth:\n(I believe you already have all the dangerous toys you will ever need, Franziska.)\n\n\n\n\nStatue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI can spot absolutely no difference between this Primidux Statue and Babahl's.\nFranziska:\nThe statue's face looks a bit like that costumed hero you like so very much. I only wonder why you Americans have such an affinity for this kind of face?\nEdgeworth:\n(The statue wasn't made by an American, you know. At least, I don't suppose so.)\n\n\n\n\n\nDeduce spear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)\n\n\n\nPresent Steel Samurai's Autograph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Larry, about this spear...\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe contradiction of this here is related to this piece of evidence!\nFranziska:\n...I don't see how they're related in any way.\nEdgeworth:\nGnnrgh! .............................. Hmph... Franziska. This is not like you at all. Don't tell me that you don't understand the meaning behind this piece of evidence?\nFranziska:\nWell, I don't.\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose I have no choice then. I'll just have to explain it to you from the beginning.\nFranziska:\nWhat you should be doing from the very beginning is admitting your mistake!\nEdgeworth:\nGnwaaaah! (Sh-She saw right through me...)\nLeads to examination of knife rack area\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, about this spear...\nLarry:\nOh! Are you feeling it? BAM!\nEdgeworth:\nI thought there was something strange about this spear... Tell me, Larry. Is it just me or is the spear a bit bent?\nLarry:\nWh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What!? No way! It's exactly as it should be, yo!\nEdgeworth:\nI have here the autograph you wrote for me earlier. Now, take a good look at this which you drew with your own hands. You can see that the spear is clearly of a different shape!\nLarry:\nA...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat do you have to say to that!?\nLarry:\nI-I'm soooooooorry! When I hold the spear in my hands, all of a sudden I feel super powerful... And then, during practice, I was spinning it around and around... ...and BAM! It hit the waaaaaaaaaall!\nFranziska:\n\nFranziska:\nYou unbelievable--! This is an EMBASSY!\nLarry:\nBut I've always been like that... ever since I was a kid. One time on an overnight field trip, I bought a fake sword and played with it late that night. I'm just a useless, hot-blooded maaaaaaaaaaan!\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, clarify that for me, will you?\nLarry:\nOK, so it was some field trip, and I began to shadow-fight with myself...\nEdgeworth:\nNot that! I meant what you said earlier, about spinning the spear and hitting the wall!\nLarry:\nOh, that! It's no biggie. It's not like I left a hole or anything!\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not why I'm asking, Larry. The Samurai Spear is made of metal. I somehow doubt that a move as simple as spinning it around would cause it to bend.\nLarry:\nMan, Edgey, you're so naïve!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What!? Where did that come from!?\nLarry:\nWell, you keep calling it the Samurai Spear. But it's not real. You can't really fight someone with it... ...because it's hollow on the inside! You could hit it against practically anything and it would bend.\nEdgeworth:\nI-Is that so...?\nLarry:\nDon't tell me you thought it was real? Oh, but don't take it the wrong way. I just think that part of your personality is cute.\nFranziska:\nI see. Your friendship truly is something \"special\", Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n(Arngh! That's not \"friendship\"; it's \"utter humiliation\"!)\nSamurai Spear data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnife rack area (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nKnife rack area (after correctly deducing spear)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\nSpear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the Steel Samurai's primary weapon, the Samurai Spear.

Oh, but I guess you can call me a pro at getting caught up in all sorts of mischief!\nEdgeworth:\n(...You also seem to be a pro at being defiant in the face of punishment for said mischief.)\n\n\n\n\n\nGolden statue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere... was the exact same statue sitting in that Babahlese office we examined.\nFranziska:\nIt's the Primidux Statue. It was the national treasure of the Principality of Cohdopia. There was only one of these statues, meaning that one of the two is a replica. But both Allebahst and Babahl claim to have the real thing.\nEdgeworth:\n(What an incredibly childish fight to have.)\nAllebahst's Primidux Statue data jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnife rack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There was almost the exact same wall mount for the knives on the Babahlese side.

There was one of these on the Babahlese side as well.\nFranziska:\nI hear it's very valuable and made of pure gold. It was the national treasure of Cohdopia. There was only one of these statues... ...meaning that one of the two is a replica.

They're both lovely things... But can we interpret this to mean that Allebahst provides honey to Babahl?\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska, can't you come up with a more meaningful, or profound comment?\nFranziska:\nVery well then, let's hear what sort of profound comment you can come up with.\nEdgeworth:\nAhem... Well, flowers cannot survive without the butterflies that spread their pollen. And butterflies cannot live without the nectar that flowers provide. If either one were to disappear from the equation, neither would survive. How was that, Ms. von Karma?\nFranziska:\nYour explanation took so long that I nearly fell asleep.

As such, only an ambassador or a secretariat-level person is allowed to handle it.

A few months ago... this thief caused a lot of havoc on the populous [sic].\nFranziska:\nSo this thief is separate from the Yatagarasu?\nBadd:\n...I thought they were for a while... because their M. O. and targets were different. DeMasque likes high-value trinkets and jewels, and being gaudy is his signature. Gumshoe was in charge of that investigation, so he'd know more about DeMasque.\nFranziska:\nThat's alright. All I'd probably hear are tales of his failure anyway.\nBadd:\nHmph... You haven't changed a bit, I see...\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case... let's get started here, shall we? (I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\nPaper in hand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat is he holding...? It looks like a piece of paper from a notepad. It would appear that directions on how to reach this room were written by hand. Hm? There is something written on the back as well.\nFranziska:\n...\"I'd like you to steal the Primidux Statue in this room\"... What is that supposed to mean? Who writes a note to themselves like that?\nEdgeworth:\nIf I had to guess from the text... ...I would say that this is actually a request from someone about what to steal.

A phony \"successor\"... He's... just another petty thief... His real identity... is an out-of-work guy... by the name of Ka-Shi Nou. He's 29... and wanted on larceny charges. From his clothes... and what he was carrying... ...we determined... that this guy is the real DeMasque II...\nEdgeworth:\nThe cause of death appears to be the loss of blood from the back of his head. It seems that he was struck with something very hard. In other words, he was bludgeoned to death.\n\n\n\n\nCostume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nThere is not a single shred of fashion sense in DeMasque's costume.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, at least I can appreciate the great effort he must've put into making it.\nBadd:\nYou two don't know? You can buy this costume almost anywhere now.\nEdgeworth:\n...It's being sold? Since when?\nBadd:\nSince around New Year's. The streets are practically flooded with them. Turns out, DeMasque is a lot more popular than I thought he'd be.\nFranziska:\nI can't believe that foolish fool would dress in fools' clothing to act foolishly!\nEdgeworth:\n(...We got your point about three \"foolish\"-es back, Franziska.)\n\n\n\n\nCloth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nI suppose this was the wrapping cloth DeMasque II used to carry his stolen goods. But there's nothing wrapped in it now. I guess he never did manage to get his hands on whatever it was he was out to steal.\n\n\n\n\nSword\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo this is the murder weapon in this case.\nFranziska:\nThere's blood on the blade. It's rather sweeping sword, isn't it?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat did you expect? It's Steel Samurai Daddy's secondary weapon. I only call it his secondary because although he uses his sword in most of his battles... ...it's his trusty Samurai Spear that he turns to in a real fight.\nFranziska:\nYou sure know quite a bit about the Steel Samurai.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's only because I saw the stage show earlier.

Which means that there must be some reason behind that action!\n\n\n\n\nFlower ornamentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's a striking flower ornament on the handle of this knife.

Of course. I was planning to do that from the very beginning.\nFranziska:\nIn that case, hurry up and start the investigation already!\nEdgeworth:\nI-I will! So let's get started! (In order to find out the truth behind what happened here... ...I should start by gathering as much information as I can.)\n\n\n\n\nMask☆DeMasque II (this Talk option disappears after examining piece of paper, Mask☆DeMasque II's head, and sword)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nMask☆DeMasque... I see that yet another weirdo has popped up in my absence.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, and as I understand it, he was a brilliant thief to whom the world was his oyster. He stole extremely valuable objects one after another for a while. Detective Gumshoe was in charge of the case, and not once did he catch DeMasque.\nFranziska:\nHmph... I had already researched all that, you know.\nEdgeworth:\nLast year, when DeMasque gave himself up and was finally arrested... ...he was apparently represented by that man. Knowing him, I'm almost curious as to how insane that trial turned out to be.\nFranziska:\nIndeed...\nEdgeworth:\n(But why would anyone want to kill DeMasque? I should really find out some more about the victim...)\n\n\n\n\nSteel Samurai (this Talk option disappears after correctly deducing spear)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nWhat exactly is that hideous, fashion faux pas of a costume he's wearing supposed to be? I feel like I've seen it somewhere before... ...but there's something different about it than what I remember.\nEdgeworth:\nThat costume is from the very first Steel Samurai. It's a live-action superheroes show on television, beloved by children and adults alike. The Steel Samurai's weapon is the Samurai Spear. And it is with the Samurai Spear that he performs his special attacks... ...which enthrall all who watch them in action.\nFranziska:\nYou seem to know quite a bit.\nEdgeworth:\nN-Not at all! And in any case, Franziska... ...I believe the Samurai you are familiar with is the second one... ...the Nickel Samurai, which was part of that case last year. Do you recall that case?\nFranziska:\n! Y-Yes, I remember... Although, I'd much rather it stay buried in the depths of my mind...\nEdgeworth:\n(Not that I blame her... She was shot during the course of that trial. I fear she may still be suffering great trauma over the shooting...)\nFranziska:\nNnrgh... Anyway, that aside... ...it looks like the Steel Samurai is the suspect this time.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, although that's because of who is inside the costume rather than the character... Ack! That's right! If HE is the Steel Samurai...\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth, have you been in shock over something this whole time?\nEdgeworth:\nN-No, I'm not in shock over anything... (I wanted to forget that I had received the Steel Samurai autograph from Larry... But... the autograph... The drawing of the Samurai Spear and the caricature of his face... Why did he waste so much time on the most useless parts of the autograph!?)\nLarry:\nHm? Hey, Edgey! Did you say something?\nEdgeworth:\nNO! I didn't say anything!\n\n\n\n\nPrimidux Statue (appears after examining golden statue and table with photograph) (this Talk option disappears after correctly deducing golden statue)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nIt's a statue of the founder of Cohdopia, Primi Dux. Because it's the national treasure, I've heard that only a few are allowed access to it.\nLang:\nThat's exactly right. Even we're not allowed to touch it. Not without the ambassador's permission, anyway. If we lay even a single finger on it... BAM! It's instant jail time!\nEdgeworth:\n...Understood. (So it's that precious of a national treasure that a single touch can lead to arrest. And yet, I sense that there is something off about the statue... What is the source of this unease I feel...?)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounterfeit Bills or Babahlese Ink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nRecently, incredibly well-forged counterfeit bills have been found coming out of Zheng Fa. Counterfeits made using Babahlese ink, that is. That smuggling ring that I've been chasing is the group behind the whole operation. But mark my words, no one involved in it will escape my whip! They will all know pain! Hmph!!\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What am I getting whipped for!?\n\n\n\n\nPassionflowers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nPassionflowers... They are a most beautiful flower.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. They are a magnificent species.\nFranziska:\nBut always be mindful of the fact that beautiful flowers have painful thorns.\nEdgeworth:\n......... (I suppose that advice coming from a woman with a whip is best heeded...)\nAfter correctly deducing spear and golden statue, and examining knife rack, paper in hand, Mask☆DeMasque II's head, sword, and flowers on windowsill:\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... I guess that about wraps up my investigation. Hm? That's...\nLarry:\nYo! Pink Princess! How're you feeling? Still feeling ill?\nPink Princess:\n..................\nFranziska:\n...And yet another strange character comes out of the woodwork.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd so the Pink Princess also comes to pay the Allebahstian Embassy a visit. (I believe I may need to speak with her as well...)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPink Princess\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Pink Princess. I have a few questions I'd like to ask you.\nPink Princess:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Pink Princess! If you would please answer... ...meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!\nOldbag:\nHeh... This must be what they call \"fate\".\nEdgeworth:\nH-How could this happen two days in a roooooooooooow!?\nLarry:\nWh-Whaaaaaaaaat the--!? A-Aren't you Ms. Oldbag!?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are YOU so surprised!?\nOldbag:\nAh, so you're the one they got to play the Steel Samurai. It's too bad I didn't realize that until now.\nEdgeworth:\n...You are acquaintances with Larry...?\nOldbag:\nWhy, yes. We worked at the same company for a little while, you know. That's why it's OK, my Edgey-poo! You don't need to be jealous!\nEdgeworth:\nNnnnghoooooooh!\nOldbag:\nI was in the next room, you know, trying to get in some beauty sleep. But it was so noisy here that I couldn't fall asleep. So I came over to complain! So imagine my shock when I saw my precious Edgey-poo waiting here for me! I mean, who could've imagined that you would ever come to a show like this! I guess I've misjudged you, Edgey-poo!\nFranziska:\nYou \"misjudged\" him...?\nOldbag:\nI thought he was trying to avoid me, you know.\nEdgeworth:\n(That was no misjudgment on your part! That's PRECISELY what I was trying to do!)\nOldbag:\nBut it looks like the winds have shifted and he's now willing to be chased after! I'm simply overwhelmed! Don't you worry, Edgey-poo! I'd chase you for forever! To the ends of the Earth!\nFranziska:\n...Isn't that just peachy?\nEdgeworth:\n(This is one of those rare times when Franziska and I actually see eye to eye...)\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPink Princess\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, ahem... What are you doing here? I thought you were working at Gatewater Land as the Pink Badger...?\nOldbag:\nWhat are you talking about!? That was ages ago!\nEdgeworth:\n(That was YESTERDAY!)\nOldbag:\nLook, I worked at Global Studios before, a long time ago, right? Well, they called me up this morning, kind of out of the blue, actually.\nFranziska:\nThey called you?\nOldbag:\nApparently, the girl who plays the Pink Princess collapsed from a bad cold. It happened so suddenly, so they called me in to be her last minute replacement.\nEdgeworth:\n(Do they not have enough people on staff at that studio...!?)\nOldbag:\nI really couldn't say no, so here I am, playing the role of the heroine! Instead of that Mindy girl, I mean. But the poor girl, I feel bad for her. Because they let me stand in for her, she's going to have a terrible time when she returns. I mean, I'm not exactly great at reading that strange font they use, plus I was called in to be a stand-in at the very last second, so I tripped over all the most important lines, I threw that rag doll instead of the shuriken, hit the Steel Samurai instead of the enemy, and the audience was in an uproar, but as an avant-garde actress, they'll forgive me, because I tell you, they're really just a bunch of simpletons.\nFranziska:\n...You're a rather lively old lady.\nEdgeworth:\nS-So basically, you received the stand-in request this morning, correct?\nOldbag:\nYou got it. If you need to see it, I've got it right here. Look.\nFranziska:\n...It appears that she is telling the truth.\nStand-In Request data jotted down in my Organizer.\nOldbag:\nI tell you, my fine acting moved the entire audience to tears!\nEdgeworth:\n(Yes, tears of laughter, as I recall.)\nOldbag:\nBut being famous has its problems too, you know. Here, take a look at this.\nFranziska:\n...?\nOldbag:\nIt's a letter from a stalker! I was just taking my break when I found this stuck under the door to my room. Honestly, you really have to watch out for these kinds of things! Look at what it says! \"Wéndy, I'll be descending on you from above tonight. Your loving knight\". Hmph! How absolutely revolting! I mean, you'd think he could get my name right. There's no accent in my name!\nEdgeworth:\n(Wait, this horrible handwriting... Where have I seen this before...?)\nOldbag:\nAh, but now that you're here, Edgey-poo, I feel 100% safe.\nEdgeworth:\nEh? I... Where do I factor into this?\nOldbag:\nYou'd bust that evil stalker-man for my sake, wouldn't you, Edgey-poo?\nEdgeworth:\nWell... if you allow me the liberty to handle this in my own way... ...I'll gladly dispatch a detective to your house later.\nOldbag:\nOh, come on, Edgey-poo! Stop being so dismissive and playing hard to get!\nLetter from a Stalker data jotted down in my Organizer.\n\n\n\n\nPink Princess (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, ahem... What are you doing here? I thought you were working at Gatewater Land as the Pink Badger...?\nOldbag:\nWhat are you talking about!? That was ages ago!\nEdgeworth:\n(That was YESTERDAY!)\nOldbag:\nLook, I worked at Global Studios before, a long time ago, right?

Stop being so dismissive and playing hard to get!\n\n\n\n\nTime of the murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhat were you doing at the time of the crime?\nOldbag:\nWhat crime?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat--!?\nOldbag:\nAfter the show was over, I've had nothing but free time on my hands. So I used the fireplace (Used the fireplace - At the time of the crime, Ms. Oldbag was warming her hip in the room next door.) in the room next door to keep my bad hip warm.\nFranziska:\nWell, a murder occurred in the room right next to yours!\nOldbag:\nIs that right? Oh, Edgey-poo! I'm so scared! Hold me! Carress me!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI-If you could please not cling on to my personage! [sic]\nFranziska:\nIn any case, I take it then, that you failed to show up at Ambassador Alba's speech?\nOldbag:\nOh, that. No, I didn't go. I mean, I may have the heart of a young, tender maiden... ...but my body just refuses to cooperate at times. As soon as the show ended, my hip started acting up and got stiff. I couldn't move at all!\nEdgeworth:\nCan you provide proof of your condition?\nOldbag:\nOh, you just go on ahead and ask the doctors in the infirmary. They're the ones who carried me from the theater all the way to this embassy.\nEdgeworth:\n(I have to admit, the thought of her not being able to leave that room is rather pleasant.)\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStand-In Request\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldbag:\nAh, what a strange twist of events. Because they needed a stand-in, I was able to become a heroine, just like that!\nEdgeworth:\nI assume that the actual reason you were called in is due to a lack of personnel.\nOldbag:\nWell, there's that too. But no matter what you say, it's obvious that I have presence. I bet that's how I caught the eye of the director. I ask you, is being beautiful really such a crime!?\nEdgeworth:\n(I suspect even the director is lamenting the lack of personnel from the depths of his heart.)\n\n\n\n\nLetter from a Stalker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldbag:\nSo this person will be descending on me from above tonight, huh!? Oh, Edgey-poo! I'm so scared! Hold meeeeeee!\nEdgeworth:\nI-If you could please not cling on to my personage! [sic]\nOldbag:\nHonestly, beautiful people have it so hard. All it took was for me to be up on that stage for a little while, and a stalker is born!\nEdgeworth:\nActually, the whole time while you were up on that stage, you were in-costume. Therefore, no one should've recognized you or what you looked like underneath...\nOldbag:\nBut there is that thing, you know. They say people can identify you by your aura. So even without seeing my face, my stalker could see the beauty within me. So you see! That's how I charm the pants off of men!\nEdgeworth:\n(Charm? You? Preposterous.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldbag:\nWhat's this!? A present for me?\nEdgeworth:\nN-No! Obviously, I can't simply give you a piece of evidence!\nOldbag:\nHmph... I see. You're just embarrassed to give it to me in front of all these people. But don't worry, I can wait. A \"present of love\" from my Edgey-poo is beyond worth it!\nEdgeworth:\nGnnnrk.........!\nFranziska:\n...What a bother.\nEdgeworth:\n(If you only knew how much, Franziska...)\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Smoke from chimney\" (after clearing \"Time of the murder\" Talk option with Larry Butz) and \"Used the fireplace\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere is no trace of this room's fireplace being used...\nFranziska:\nAnd your point is?\nEdgeworth:\nAhem, smoke was supposedly pouring out of the chimney connected to this fireplace. At least, according to Larry. This is a contradiction of facts, is it not?\nFranziska:\nAre you sure he wasn't just disoriented or something up on that roof?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is testimony from an investigator that puts Larry at this particular chimney... ...so, no, I don't think it was a mistaken impression on Larry's part. On the other hand, the fireplace in the next room was being used at the time. Where do you suppose the smoke from that fireplace went?\nFranziska:\nAh, I see. So what you are proposing is this. The smoke that came out of the chimney was actually from Ms. Oldbag's fire. So basically, the fireplaces of neighboring rooms... ...share one chimney (Shared chimney - The office fireplace and the one in Ms. Oldbag's room share the same chimney.)! Is that what you are implying?\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely.\nAfter clearing all Talk options with Wendy Oldbag:\nOfficer:\nProsecutor von Karma! I've brought the police dog, as you requested, sir!\nFranziska:\nGood work. You may leave now, Officer.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... This dog...\nFranziska:\nI requested the assistance of a dog in our search for the Yatagarasu.\nLang:\nLooks like you guys have some pretty bright dogs in this country, too.\n???:\nWoof! Woof!\nLang:\nHey... You're a real cutie, aren't you? Yeah! That's a good boy!\nBadd:\n...That's the police dog Gumshoe's been taking care of... I think its name is... Missile.\nFranziska:\nWhat a fitting name for a police dog that dashes out in front and attacks.\nEdgeworth:\n(That action alone isn't exactly what's going to solve the case for us, you know.)\nFranziska:\nNow, Missile. I want you to find some clues! Go!\nMissile:\nWoof!\nFranziska:\nGood dog. You really are quite bright, aren't you? ...Unlike a certain someone I know. Now, what do we have here? What... is this? It looks like a small hot dog, but...\nEdgeworth:\nHm? Wait, Franziska, isn't that... an official Samurai Dog?\nMissile:\nGrrraaaaaaarh!\nFranziska:\nAh! No! Bad Missile! .........He ate it. I wonder if it's alright for him to eat that?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's just a meat-substance snack featuring the Steel Samurai. I'm sure he'll be fine.\nFranziska:\nThat's quite a bit of information you gathered there in a single, quick glance.\nEdgeworth:\n(We should really be focusing on why there was a Samurai Dog there in the first place.)\nFranziska:\nHm? It looks like that snack wasn't all Missile found.\nEdgeworth:\nOh? And what do we have... here...?\nFranziska:\nIt appears to be a lady's undershirt. I wonder if Ambassador Alba might have an interest in cross-dressing?\nEdgeworth:\nI somehow doubt that. It doesn't look like the shirt would even fit him. (A Samurai Dog and a lady's undershirt... What are these two items doing in a room like this? Given the circumstances, the lady's undershirt could only belong to one person. I suppose I should get this over with and ask the owner of said undershirt about it...)\nLady's Undershirt data jotted down in my Organizer.\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWendy Oldbag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent Lady's Undershirt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"If you could please take a look at this brown-colored undershirt...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMissile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissile:\nWoof!\nFranziska:\nHe was a much bigger help than I thought he would be.\nEdgeworth:\nYes... However, there are a few aspects I don't understand about what he found.\nFranziska:\nIn that case, you should keep on investigating until you do understand. Now, my subordinate, continue with the investigation!\nEdgeworth:\nA-Alright, I will. (It is with great dread that I proceed and do what I must to solve the case...)\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFranziska:\nWe borrowed this dog from the local precinct... ...but is he really capable of handling this case? I thought police dogs are usually of a much larger breed.\nEdgeworth:\nHe may be small, but he is an excellent police dog. Furthermore, he was raised by Detective Gumshoe.\nFranziska:\nYou had me thinking the dog was capable until you said that he was raised by Scruffy.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, well... (I suppose that wasn't the best of arguments to use...)\nEdgeworth:\nIf you could please take a look at this brown-colored undershirt...\nOldbag:\nOh, Edgey-poo... What is the meaning of this!?\nEdgeworth:\n?\nOldbag:\nWhy did you steal that thing from my bags...? All you had to do was ask, and I would've gladly given you as many as you'd like!\nEdgeworth:\nNnnrghk! Th-Thanks, but no thanks! This shirt was found here at this crime scene.\nOldbag:\nWhat!?\nEdgeworth:\nCome now, why don't you just confess... and explain what it's doing here.\nOldbag:\nI know nothing! NOTHING, I tell you!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nOldbag:\nOh, I admit that I used the fireplace to dry that shirt! But I can't really help the fact that I had to, you know! Wearing that Pink Princess costume was like being in a sauna! And on top of that, I get fingered as a suspect!? You're too cruel, Edgey-poo!\nEdgeworth:\nAre you claiming that you never once set foot inside this room?\nOldbag:\nOf course I am! If I had been the one to find the body, do you think I'd be as calm and relaxed as I am!? I tell you, it's always like this! It's always my fault for some reason or another. That weekly tabloid article is missing? The camera is missing? That lawyer always makes sure it's my fault they're missing. Speaking of missing, there's the matter of my husband. Can you believe when we got married, he said, \"I guess I'm stuck marrying you.\" What kind of way to propose is that!? What he should've done is he should've whispered in my ear, \"I don't deserve you... but I can't help it. Will you marry me?\" Honestly, men these days!\nEdgeworth:\nUmm... Well... (I don't believe she is lying about her actions... So I can safely assume she really was drying her shirt by the fireplace on her break. And somehow, the undershirt managed to move from the next room into this one (Undershirt from next door - The undershirt was found in the office fireplace, but how did it get there?)...) I assume the Samurai Dog was also yours...?\nOldbag:\nAh, that brilliant mind of yours. You really can see through everything about me!\nEdgeworth:\n(And so the feeling of dread continues... But I suppose I should ask for more details...)\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWendy Oldbag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Dogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat Samurai Dog was yours, wasn't it?\nOldbag:\nOh, of course I'm forever yours, my Edgey-Wedgey-poo!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI-If you could just stick to what I asked you!\nLarry:\nEdgey... Are you... and Ms. Oldbag...\nEdgeworth:\nNO!\nOldbag:\nYou really don't change, do you? When will you learn how to take a joke? Anyway, that Samurai Dog wasn't mine. Those things are a present from the studio to the Embassy.\nFranziska:\nA present...?\nLarry:\nThe studio big-wigs basically told us to play delivery boys. We were supposed to hand the Dogs off to the embassy people and tell them \"hi\". I had to pile them all into the pushcart just to move them all! Those studio guys should've delivered those things by themselves! Right, Edgey!?\nEdgeworth:\nSo, did you deliver the Samurai Dogs to the embassy staff as per your instructions?\nLarry:\nHey! Edgey! Don't just ignore me and my question! Aren't you going to stick up for me!?\nOldbag:\nAh, about that. See, after the show, I went to rest a spell in the dressing room. Because of my bad hip, you know. And there they were, the Samurai Dogs were just sitting on the dressing room floor.\nFranziska:\nI suppose you had to make preparations for distributing them after the show.\nOldbag:\nWell, if by preparation, you mean sampling them as well.\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nOldbag:\nOh, I tried one and thought they were actually quite good! Sorry, but I just had to find out. I know it was silly of me to think this, but... ...I figured that since they're for a kid's show, their taste was probably for kids, too. But they were so good that I couldn't stop. Before I went back to my room, I just had to help myself to half a dozen or so boxes! As I sat there by the roaring fire, warming them and eating them, I thought, \"Ah, this is...\"\nFranziska:\n............\nEdgeworth:\n............\nOldbag:\nHmph. What is it now? Oh! I know! I bet you want a box, too, don't you, my Edgey-poo? Well, who am I to say no to you. But I'll only give you one. The rest are all for me.\nSamurai Dogs forced onto me.\nFranziska:\nLooks like the lesson for today is that when the Steel Samurai and the Pink Princess... ...take off their masks, they transform into a pair of annoying troublemakers.\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Dogs (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat Samurai Dog was yours, wasn't it?\nOldbag:\nOh, of course I'm forever yours, my Edgey-Wedgey-poo!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI-If you could just stick to what I asked you!\nLarry:\nEdgey... Are you... and Ms. Oldbag...\nEdgeworth:\nNO!\nOldbag:\nYou really don't change, do you? When will you learn how to take a joke? Anyway, that Samurai Dog wasn't mine.

This old lady's underwear!\nEdgeworth:\nTh-That's not the reason I kept it! It's a very important piece of evidence...!\nOldbag:\nFor you, Edgey-poo, I can spare an undershirt or two, you know. All you have to do is ask! Anytime, anywhere!\nEdgeworth:\n(Arngh! If this wasn't [sic] a valuable piece of evidence, I would've disposed of it upon contact!)\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Dogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldbag:\nThis thing really showed me not to underestimate the taste of a snack meant for kids.\nEdgeworth:\nWas it really that tasty?\nOldbag:\n*gasp* Don't tell me you haven't had one yet! In that case, I'll just have to feed you one! Now, open wide! Here comes the hotdog train!\nEdgeworth:\nN-No! That's perfectly alright! I'm currently on the job right now!\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect \"Shared chimney\" and \"Undershirt from next door\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe lady's undershirt that Missile found... Arrrngh!\nFranziska:\nWhy are you getting all excited over holding on to a lady's undergarment!? Miles Edgeworth... you uncouth sea slug! If you know the owner of said undershirt, then hurry up and return it to her already!\nEdgeworth:\nYou have it all wrong! This is evidence! And the owner of this piece of evidence was in the room next door. And yet, despite that, Missile found it in the fireplace of this room. This.. lady's undershirt...\nFranziska:\nAre you seriously claiming that it somehow passed through a solid brick wall?\nEdgeworth:\nNot quite. The fireplace in this room is connected to a chimney. The other fireplace in the other room is also connected to the same chimney... ...leading us to the possibility that the two fireplaces are connected to each other.\nFranziska:\n...Perhaps a closer look at the back of the fireplace is in order.\nEdgeworth:\n(There is an X on the back wall of the fireplace. Let's see if I can't get a better look at it.)\n\n\nFranziska:\nWh-What in the--!?\nEdgeworth:\nThe wall separating this room's fireplace from the next room's fireplace... ...apparently turns. As I suspected, this fireplace does indeed connect this room to the neighboring room.\nFranziska:\nThe neighboring room?\nEdgeworth:\nThere appears to be... nothing particular about the next room. (But the fact that there is nothing special about the next room isn't what's important. It's the fact that there is a secret passageway through this room's fireplace (Connected fireplaces - Ambassador Alba's office fireplace is connected to the neighboring room's fireplace.)!)\nFranziska:\nWe now know that the fireplace connects the two rooms. But how exactly is that significant? You aren't going to suddenly name the old lady as DeMasque II's killer now, are you?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, she couldn't move at all because of her stiff hip... ...so she could not have been the one. Unfortunately, I believe... ...that this fireplace has nothing whatsoever to do with DeMasque II's murder.\nExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFireplace (after connecting \"Shared chimney\" and \"Undershirt from next door\" Logic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(This fireplace connects this room with the room next door. But the old bag was suffering from a stiff hip at the time and couldn't move. Which means that all of this is probably irrelevant to DeMasque II's murder.)\nAfter connecting all possible Logic and clearing \"Samurai Dogs\" Talk option with Wendy Oldbag:\nInvestigation Complete\nEdgeworth:\n(It would appear that the answer has made itself known.)\nLang:\nYou're making quite a confident face there, Mr. Prosecutor. Bring it on! I'm ready to counter any argument you may have!\nEdgeworth:\nVery well, then. If you are prepared... ...I'll show you exactly where my deductions have led me!\nLarry:\nGood! I'm counting on you, Edgey!\nEdgeworth:\nLeave it to me, Larry. My first attack will be... to expose your lie for what it really is.\nLarry:\nM-My liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie!?\nEdgeworth:\nI know that there is still something you are keeping from the rest of us.\nLarry:\nWh-What's wrong with you!? Why is it you won't believe me no matter what I say, Edgey!? Curse you! I should just hurry up and die already if that's how it's gonna be! I'll confess to every murder in the whole world, and then kill myself... ...and throw everything into mass confuuuuuuuuusion!\nLang:\nHeh, you made some wonderful friends as a child, I see.\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, I only have one thing to say to you.\nLarry:\nEven if you make that face at me, it's no use! A man who is ready to die is strong-willed, you know!\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, it doesn't matter what sort of harebrained trouble you've caused... ...I only ask that you do not lie to me. If you cause an innocent person to be judged unfairly because of some insipid lie... ...I will never forgive you!\nLarry:\nE...Edgey...\nEdgeworth:\nAlthough, allow me to say... ...that I consider you to be among the innocent in this case. And that I will draw the real killer out. You can trust me on this.\nLarry:\nAlright. I... I... This time... This time, I'll tell you the whole truth, OK!? What happened, what didn't happen, the works!\nEdgeworth:\nJust what happened will do! Now then, if you would please testify as to what you did up on the roof tonight.\nTestimony\n-- Up on the Rooftop --\nLarry:\nAfter the show, I left the pushcart in the Rose Garden, and came into the embassy.\nThen, they took a picture of me shaking hands with the ambassador.\nAfter that, and until my next appearance, I had some free time, so I wandered around.\nThat's when I spotted the chimney. A chimney like that is a rare thing, you know.\nSo then, I wanted to play Santa and decided to give it a try.\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, I thought I just finished telling you to not lie anymore.\nLarry:\nUmm......... But it's... kinda, ultra-embarrassing.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what exactly is so ultra-embarrassing that you can't tell me!?\nLarry:\nEdgey, man! I just said it was embarrassing, so of course I can't just blurt it out! So you're just gonna have to reason it ouuuuuuuuuuuuut of me!\nFranziska:\nAs your superior, I command you to hurry up and expose this man's lie!\nEdgeworth:\nI have every intention to, for I'm not about to let us waste time on such a trifling matter.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You left the pushcart? Could you please clarify that statement for me? Larry: Yeah. So the wheels on the pushcart got covered in dirt from the Rose Garden. It would've made a mess of the floor inside, so Ambassador Alba said to just leave it. Edgeworth: (Well, it WOULD be rather impolite to dirty another country's embassy.) Larry: Come to think of it, I recall seeing the Pink Princess on my way into the Embassy. Edgeworth: And what was she doing? Larry: Nothing in particular. Because she was being carried by some docs on a stretcher! Edgeworth: (She must've been incapacitated by the pain of her bad hip that she suffered during the show.) Larry: So, I came into the embassy, right? And then...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you shook hands with the ambassador of the Kingdom of Allebahst, did you...? Larry: Yeah! Can you believe it!? I did something really cool for a change. ...But, honestly speaking, there's nothing interesting about shaking some guy's hand. Lang: Hey, there. Are you disrespecting another country in their very own embassy? Franziska: As someone with roots in this country, I'm feeling nothing but incredible shame at this second. Edgeworth: Agreed... I apologize for his inconsiderate words. Now, Larry, please continue. Larry: Wh-What is with all of you!? You keep saying that kind of thing and I'll tell you only lies! Edgeworth: You're already telling us nothing but lies! So let it go and move on! Larry: Aaaaaaaalright, already! You don't need to glare at me like that, Edgeeeeeeey!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Larry, I want you to listen very carefully and take this to heart. The whole point of your life is to cause misery and pain to everyone you encounter. Larry: I-I knoooooooow! I get it! I'm totally the bad guy again! Lang: Lang: I thought you're his friend. Don't you think that was a bit harsh? Lang Zi says: \"True friends are bosom friends.\" If you are in trouble, call on your bosom friend, whose shoulder you can truly cry on. Larry: Hey! Bosom buddy! I hope you're listening carefully to my testimony! Edgeworth: (Has it crossed your pea-sized brain yet that Agent Lang is only out to arrest you, Larry?) Lang: Now then, you were wandering around inside the Embassy, and then what happened?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I should hardly think that chimneys are that rare. Franziska: Agreed. Especially since they are a traditional feature of American houses. Lang: Plus, many grand buildings have even larger and fancier chimneys. Larry: Yeah, but the kind of chimney I'M talking about is the really romantic type! Edgeworth: A \"romantic\" chimney...? Larry: It might sound kinda silly... umm... but women seem to really enjoy them... And I just had a good feeling about that chimney!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You... suddenly wanted to play Santa...? Larry: Oh, well, actually, I dressed up as Santa once before already. That was down at Gourd Lake. Edgeworth: Gnnrk! ...I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't dredge up such unnecessary memories for me! Lang: Heh, sounds like you guys share a lot of history. A perk to being childhood friends, huh? Besides, it's not a felony to dress up and play Santa, you know. Santa doesn't go around killing people after he comes down a family's chimney, after all. Edgeworth: (Actually, is it worth delving into whether or not playing Santa is a big deal?) Raise an objection Leads to: \"Actually, I believe in the case of this man, playing Santa is actually quite a big deal.\" Don't raise an objection Lang: So I guess you don't have a problem with my statement? Edgeworth: Perhaps... (...I need to gather more information first.) Leads back to rebuttal Leads to: \"Actually, I believe in the case of this man, playing Santa is actually quite a big deal.\" Lang: So I guess you don't have a problem with my statement? Edgeworth: Perhaps... (...I need to gather more information first.) Leads back to rebuttal\nEdgeworth: As I suspected, you do have something to hide, Larry. But what could be so embarrassing that you'd be willing to go to jail for it!?\nFranziska: This man's mind is a complete mystery to me.\nEdgeworth: I believe it's a secret to everyone of a normal mindset how Larry's mind works. However, taking into account his usual, women-obsessed way of thinking... ...I believe that his lie this time is also related to a woman, and this is what I intend to prove.",

You hit the nail on the head, Agent Lang.\nLarry:\nHey, Edgey! That's so incredibly mean!\nEdgeworth:\nTell me something, Larry. Did you know that Santa's job is to deliver presents to people all over the world?\nLarry:\nOf course I know that! I DID graduate from junior high, you know!\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, it's your turn to tell me something. I want you to tell me to whom you were delivering a present to.\nLarry:\nUmm... I was, ah... delivering a present to a child not basking in the warm glow (changed from [glow] in the original release) of love?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThat must be the most elegant description of you I've ever heard, but a lie is still a lie.\nLarry:\nY-You sure know how to kick a guy when he's down, you know that!?\nEdgeworth:\nIn any case, the person you wished to deliver a present unto was most certainly this!\nPresent Ex-Security Lady profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Heh, interesting tastes you have there, Mr. Suspect.\"\nPresent anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right, it was this person!\nFranziska:\n...\nLang:\n...\nBadd:\n...\nLarry:\n.........Edgey. Looks like you can say totally irrelevant things, too, just like meeee!\nEdgeworth:\nI refuse to be lectured by a man who bumbles through life like a punch-drunk monkey! (Gnnrk... It would appear that I was mistaken... But if I think through this rationally and calmly, the answer should become clear. The person Larry wanted to deliver a present to... There really is only one person it could be!)\nLeads back to:\n\"In any case, the person you wished to deliver a present unto was most certainly this!\"\nLang:\nHeh, interesting tastes you have there, Mr. Suspect.\nLarry:\nD-D-Don't spread lies about me! I totally didn't want to see Ms. Oldbag so much that I'd try to go down a chimney! Owww!\nFranziska:\nI advise you to stop right there in your bashing of a lady.\nEdgeworth:\nWell, I must admit that I, myself, hardly ever have the want to run into that lady. However... what if you were misinformed, and under the wrong impression? Then what?\nLang:\nDefine \"wrong impression\".\nEdgeworth:\nI simply mean that the man before you thought to enter the old lady's room... ...without knowing one very important fact. And that fact... is best summed up with this!\nPresent Stand-In Request\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is something the old lady received from her employer for the night.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, I'd like for you to take a look at this piece of evidence.\nLarry:\nNo way!\nEdgeworth:\nBut--!\nLarry:\nIt's not really all that important, is it!? It's always like this! You acting so high and mighty, and then you bully me! That's why... I refuse to look at it!\nFranziska:\nBe quiet and just take a look!\nLarry:\nWell, if you say so, Franzy. But only because you say so!\nEdgeworth:\n(Some people never change... Even if their attitudes do change at the whim of women.)\nLarry:\n...So what's up with that anyway?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Why, it's proof that you never even knew existed, of course.\nLarry:\nOh, is that all! Well, I don't need it right now, so I'll just give it back to you.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!?\nLarry:\nHeh, I've got you on the ropes now, don't I?\nEdgeworth:\n(Was that piece of evidence unrelated to the question at hand...? I need to think through this one more time. Larry didn't know one very important fact when he tried to sneak into the old bat's room.)\nLeads back to:\n\"And that fact... is best summed up with this!\"\nEdgeworth:\nThis is something the old lady received from her employer for the night. The girl who normally plays the Pink Princess... Mindy, was it again? It seems that this man is quite taken with that actress.\nLarry:\nLarry:\nBut that's not true, Edgey!\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nLarry:\nShe's the one with the hots for me! I just know it! I can feel her sexy beam piercing my heart when she's watching me! Seeeeeexy beam, I tell you!\nFranziska:\nYou filthy, despicable, inconsiderate, fickle, idiotic, cowardly... ...apparition of a man! You haven't matured at all since we last met!\nLang:\nHey, Mr. Prosecutor.\nEdgeworth:\nYes?\nLang:\nThis guy... He's got bigger problems than just getting involved in murders, I take it?\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose you could put it that way.\nLarry:\nHey! What the heck, man!? I don't get you guys at all! Why do you all have to make me out to be some sort of bad guy!?\nEdgeworth:\nTo return to the original topic, I propose that at least this much has been made clear. Without any knowledge that Ms. Mindy had fallen ill... ...Larry tried to make his way into the Pink Princess's room. That much we know for sure!\nLarry:\nLarry:\nHey, Edgey... Looks like I've got the hang of this court thing now.\nEdgeworth:\nBut we're not in court at the moment...\nLarry:\nShut up! I see what's going on here, and it looks just like what you do in court!\nLang:\nI guess old boy here still has something he'd like to say. Lang Zi says: \"Until the root of the tongue dries, one never knows the whole truth.\" You shouldn't form conclusions until everything is out in the open, which is why I'll listen.\nLarry:\nAlright! Then get ready to listen to me defeat Edgey in a battle of wits!\nEdgeworth:\n(Larry, have you forgotten that should I \"lose\", your victory prize will be your arrest?)\nTestimony\n-- Larry's Assertion --\nLarry:\nSo you think that all I wanted to do was to go visit Mindy?\nWell, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick.\nIt was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech.\nThen, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant.\nBut why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!?\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nLang:\n..................\nLarry:\n..................Hey! Someone say something!\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, are you seriously trying to submit this, not as a confession, but as testimony?\nLarry:\nSo what if I am!? Is there something wrong with that!? My claim is a claim claiming my claim. Do you have a problem with that!?\nOldbag:\nSo it was you! You're my stalker! But I should warn you, it doesn't matter what kind of flattery you throw at me. I'm the devoted type of woman who's wholly focused on one man, and one man only! And as long as Edgey-poo is alive, I can't just drop him and be unfaithful! No, I can't! Although, earlier, I was tempted just a tiny-winy bit by that wolf-man! But that was just a test of my love for my dear Edgey-poo, which I passed with flying colors! But from now on, I will stay completely true to my beloved Edgey-poo for the rest of eternity! I swear it!\nLarry:\nAaaaah! I-I'm so inspired!\nFranziska:\nYou're such an inconsiderate, cowardly, idiotic, and all-around completely worthless man!\nEdgeworth:\n(I thought I heard something ominous just now, but perhaps it was just my imagination.) I believe there is nothing further for me to prove at this point...\nLarry:\nWhat do you mean!? Of course you've still got something to prove! You still have to show some proof that I was trying to meet up with Mindy!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Proof\", you say?\nLarry:\nRemember, Edgey!? Everything is evidence in court, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nYou mean, \"Evidence is everything in court,\" Larry, but I understand your point.\nLarry:\nYeah, see! I'm totally a pro at this now!\nEdgeworth:\nVery well. If you wish to see the evidence... ...then let me show you the last piece of evidence you'll ever wish to see.\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, I have been saying that for a while now... After all, if not for that, then for what other reason did you wish to go down that chimney? Larry: Larry: You can't say that without any evidence! That's against the rules, Edgey! Lang: Lang: Heh! Thanks for keeping the prosecutor in line for me, Mr. Suspect! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph... I have the evidence. And if you wish to see it that badly, I can introduce you two. Franziska: Ah, but it's not good to keep them waiting, my subordinate. Hurry and show them already! Larry: L-Lies! All lies, Edgey! Edgeworth: Well, if YOU wish to lie, then by all means, continue. Because I'm ready to expose your lie at a moment's notice! Larry: Arrrrnngh... Y-You won't get the better of me! Now, let's see...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Was the smoke coming from the chimney really that thick? Larry: You bet! It was so thick, I had tears pouring out of my eyes! It was a mess! Lang: .................. Franziska: .................. Edgeworth: Hmph... I see. You do realize that you've just confirmed for us, your chimney escapade? Larry: What!? Th-That's totally unfair! Y-You tricked me, Edgeyyyyyy! Edgeworth: Hardly. You simply have yet to master how to counter this cross-examination technique. Larry: W-Well, what I just said was a slip of the... No, I mean, I said the wrong thing! Besides, isn't this what you really meant to say about what I did tonight?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not quite sure how you could mistake that actress for this lady... Oldbag: Ooh, Edgey-poo! Are you staring at me? Ah, are you finally succumbing to my feminine charms? Edgeworth: I-I should think that the Steel Samurai is the one who should know all about your \"charms\". Larry: Whaaaaat!? M-Meeeee!? Edgey! What are you trying to do to me!? Edgeworth: Nothing! Simply that the Steel Samurai and the Pink Princess are husband and wife. Oldbag: Aww, is my poor, little Edgey-poo jealous? Edgeworth: Arngh! I-If you could please drop that line of discussion right this instant...! Larry: But Edgey! I... I told you! I already have Mindyyyy! Edgeworth: Speaking of Mindy, exactly what kind of woman would you say she is? Larry: Larry: Edgey, are you seriously telling me you don't know who THE Mindy is? She's just like what her name means! She's super sweet with a great smile! I don't mean to brag, but she's one of the troupe's fastest rising stars! Edgeworth: Interesting... Lang: Lang: Hah! So you're saying a woman like that is what made you late to the speech? Larry: ...Huh? C-Curse you, too! Why is everyone out to make a suspect out of me!? Look, all I can say is this! I was late to the speech...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I suppose you might be correct in a small way. Larry: Wh-What do you mean by that!? Franziska: Besides being a suspect in a murder, there are a few other things you are a suspect of. Larry: Oooonngh... Not you, too, Franzy! Oldbag: You tried to stalk me! But I won't let you intimidate me like that! Larry: Look! I already told you, Ms. Oldbag! I wasn't after you, I was trying to see Mindy... Lang: Lang: Hey, Mr. Prosecutor, can I just arrest this guy already? Edgeworth: .........I completely understand how you feel, Agent Lang. Larry: W-Wait! Pleeeease listen to what I have to saaaaaaaay! Edgeworth: If you have a serious assertion to make, then I'd consider listening, however... Larry: No problem! I'm gonna put all I've got into this, so listen good, OK!?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Larry... This is the final point you wish to make? Larry: You got it! I've called on all the energy I have and told it to you with all my soul! Edgeworth: In that case, allow me to take that soul and break it. Larry: Huh? Franziska: Yes. We'll stamp it under our feet until it's been ground to a fine powder! Larry: A-A fine powder...!? Oldbag: .................. Larry: Eek! Lang: If you really put all your soul into that, then you're ready for what's coming, right? Larry: I-In place of the honorable Larry, I offer my soul to you. Edgeworth: ...Larry... Come out from behind there and face this like a man! Larry: Y-You're scary, My Lieeeeeeege!\nEdgeworth: (This whole testimony is one giant confession of all that he's done tonight. He's practically begging me to show why he bothered to put himself through all of this.)",

All lies, Edgey!\nEdgeworth:\nWell, if YOU wish to lie, then by all means, continue. Because I'm ready to expose your lie at a moment's notice!\nLarry:\nArrrrnngh... Y-You won't get the better of me! Now, let's see...\nPresent Letter from a Stalker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Larry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter.\"\nLarry:\nWell, I dressed up as Santa and climbed up to the chimney, but the smoke was really thick.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWas the smoke coming from the chimney really that thick?\nLarry:\nYou bet! It was so thick, I had tears pouring out of my eyes! It was a mess!\nLang:\n..................\nFranziska:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... I see. You do realize that you've just confirmed for us, your chimney escapade?\nLarry:\nWhat!? Th-That's totally unfair! Y-You tricked me, Edgeyyyyyy!\nEdgeworth:\nHardly. You simply have yet to master how to counter this cross-examination technique.\nLarry:\nW-Well, what I just said was a slip of the... No, I mean, I said the wrong thing! Besides, isn't this what you really meant to say about what I did tonight?\nLarry:\nIt was a case of mistaken identity, and that mistake made me late for the speech.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI'm not quite sure how you could mistake that actress for this lady...\nOldbag:\nOoh, Edgey-poo! Are you staring at me? Ah, are you finally succumbing to my feminine charms?\nEdgeworth:\nI-I should think that the Steel Samurai is the one who should know all about your \"charms\".\nLarry:\nWhaaaaat!? M-Meeeee!? Edgey! What are you trying to do to me!?\nEdgeworth:\nNothing! Simply that the Steel Samurai and the Pink Princess are husband and wife.\nOldbag:\nAww, is my poor, little Edgey-poo jealous?\nEdgeworth:\nArngh! I-If you could please drop that line of discussion right this instant...!\nLarry:\nBut Edgey! I... I told you! I already have Mindyyyy!\nEdgeworth:\nSpeaking of Mindy, exactly what kind of woman would you say she is?\nLarry:\n\nLarry:\nEdgey, are you seriously telling me you don't know who THE Mindy is? She's just like what her name means! She's super sweet with a great smile! I don't mean to brag, but she's one of the troupe's fastest rising stars!\nEdgeworth:\nInteresting...\nLang:\n\nLang:\nHah! So you're saying a woman like that is what made you late to the speech?\nLarry:\n...Huh? C-Curse you, too! Why is everyone out to make a suspect out of me!? Look, all I can say is this! I was late to the speech...\nLarry:\nThen, to top it all off, I became a suspect in a murder. THAT'S what you really meant.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose you might be correct in a small way.\nLarry:\nWh-What do you mean by that!?\nFranziska:\nBesides being a suspect in a murder, there are a few other things you are a suspect of.\nLarry:\nOooonngh... Not you, too, Franzy!\nOldbag:\nYou tried to stalk me! But I won't let you intimidate me like that!\nLarry:\nLook! I already told you, Ms. Oldbag! I wasn't after you, I was trying to see Mindy...\nLang:\n\nLang:\nHey, Mr. Prosecutor, can I just arrest this guy already?\nEdgeworth:\n.........I completely understand how you feel, Agent Lang.\nLarry:\nW-Wait! Pleeeease listen to what I have to saaaaaaaay!\nEdgeworth:\nIf you have a serious assertion to make, then I'd consider listening, however...\nLarry:\nNo problem! I'm gonna put all I've got into this, so listen good, OK!?\nLarry:\nBut why would I ever put myself through so much humiliation on purpose!?\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nLarry... This is the final point you wish to make?\nLarry:\nYou got it! I've called on all the energy I have and told it to you with all my soul!\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, allow me to take that soul and break it.\nLarry:\nHuh?\nFranziska:\nYes. We'll stamp it under our feet until it's been ground to a fine powder!\nLarry:\nA-A fine powder...!?\nOldbag:\n..................\nLarry:\nEek!\nLang:\nIf you really put all your soul into that, then you're ready for what's coming, right?\nLarry:\nI-In place of the honorable Larry, I offer my soul to you.\nEdgeworth:\n...Larry... Come out from behind there and face this like a man!\nLarry:\nY-You're scary, My Lieeeeeeege!\nPresent Letter from a Stalker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Larry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter.\"\nEdgeworth:\n(This whole testimony is one giant confession of all that he's done tonight. He's practically begging me to show why he bothered to put himself through all of this.)\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, don't even think about denying that you have knowledge of this letter.\nLarry:\nH-H-H-H-H-Hey! Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Why are you showing that thing to me!?\nFranziska:\n\"Wéndy, I'll be descending on you from above tonight. Your loving knight\" Well, isn't that just romantic?\nEdgeworth:\nBut you weren't able to \"descend on her from above\", were you... Mr. Loving Knight?\nLarry:\nAaaaaaaaaaaarghn! I-I have no idea what you're talking about! I don't remember a thing!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYou can pretend to be ignorant all you'd like, but it's written right here. This letter proves that you were not out to meet the old lady... ...but rather, that you were attempting to pay Ms. Mindy a visit! (What part of this letter shows that the person Larry had intended to meet was Mindy?)\nPresent \"Wéndy\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Larry, I suggest you take up penmanship lessons.\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... All will be answered if we simply look here!\nLarry:\nReally? Because I'm not sure where I'm supposed to be looking, Edgey!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... (My finger is apparently not as precise as I thought (changed from [thought it to be] in the original release).) You leave me with no other choice. I shall have to point you to a spot that even you can easily comprehend.\nLeads back to:\n\"What part of this letter shows that the person Larry had intended to meet was Mindy?\"\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, I suggest you take up penmanship lessons. That is... ...if you never wish to experience this level of embarrassment ever again.\nLarry:\nWh-Wh-Wh-What the heck!? What are you talking about!? Speak English!\nEdgeworth:\nYou wrote \"Mindy\" so sloppily that it became \"Wéndy\" to the average eye.\nLarry:\n...Hey, stop picking on me... It's so embarrassiiiiiiiiiing!\nLang:\nThere, there. Isn't that what childhood friends are for? They're the best, aren't they? ...For punching. But that will have to wait until we're off of this crime scene.\nLarry:\nEek! Edgey! Save me from the scary man!\nEdgeworth:\nSure, if you're willing to make amends. Starting with your incredibly embarrassing mistake!\nLarry:\n.........That... That... That wasn't me!\nEdgeworth:\nCome again?\nLarry:\nIt's a fake! Someone's out to get me, so they made that fake letter... ...to set me uuuuuuuuup!\nFranziska:\nAccept your defeat graciously!\nLarry:\nBut... you guys are being so mean...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n...Penmanship analysis.\nLarry:\nWhat's that?\nEdgeworth:\nNo matter who, all people have certain unique features to their handwriting. Ergo, all we have to do is compare the handwriting in this letter to a sample of yours... ...and we'll know soon enough who it was that sent this letter.\nLarry:\nI...I...I... I'll never write another thing in my life!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nTsk, tsk, tsk... It's no use, Mr. Loving Knight. For you've already graciously provided me with a sample of your handwriting!\nPresent Steel Samurai's Autograph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This autograph and our mysterious letter...\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou remember this, don't you?\nLarry:\nNope, But if you're giving it to me, I'll take it.\nEdgeworth:\nAs if I'd give this to you! (Oops. wrong piece of evidence...) Hmph... A-Anyway! I don't need you to write anything for me!\nLeads back to:\n\"For you've already graciously provided me with a sample of your handwriting\"\nEdgeworth:\nThis autograph and our mysterious letter... If we compare the handwriting, we'll know the answer to our questions soon enough.\nLarry:\nGnn...nnn... Nnnnnnnn...!\nEdgeworth:\nConfess now, Larry... to your miserable failure!\nLarry:\nI...I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorry! I... I... I did it... It was me causing trouble again... I admit it. You hit the nail right on the head... Edgey...\nEdgeworth:\n(So, he finally confesses...)\nLarry:\nI saw the Pink Princess being carried around in a stretcher, and got worried, alright!? I wanted to go into Mindy's room, but the doctors wouldn't let me in. So what choice did I have!? It was the chimney or bust, Edgey!\nFranziska:\nYour mind jumped from the door to the chimney? What a criminally overactive imagination.\nLarry:\nWell, at least I was honest and wrote Mindy a letter, and stuck it under the door. That way, she wouldn't be so shocked when I came down through the chimney!\nEdgeworth:\n(Except for the fact that the letter was an utter failure at conveying said sentiment...)\nLarry:\nI'm really, really sorry...\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, you may be a shameful, good-for-nothing blight on the face of humanity... ...however, I always knew you weren't the killer. I told you to trust me... ...because, at the very least, I can attest to that about you.\nLarry:\nEdgey... You're... Aaaack!\nFranziska:\nWe've lost a lot of valuable time because of you...!\nLarry:\nOwwwwwwwww!\nFranziska:\nIn any case, I believe we can say that we now know exactly what happened. Mr. Larry Butz sought to climb down the chimney... ...not for access to the crime scene... ...but to enter the room of the elderly lady next door.\nLang:\nLang:\nGreat job, Mr. Prosecutor. Although, I still find it a bit unbelievable that the two of you are friends.\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nLang:\nBut the suspicion on that guy over there... ...isn't completely resolved yet, so don't get any funny ideas about running off, OK?\nLarry:\nOwwwww...w? H-Hey... What--? Edgey... What does the wolf-man mean when he says I'm not off the hook yet?\nEdgeworth:\n.........He means the murder weapon. Larry, did you forget? There are two layers of suspicion hanging over your head.\nLang:\nThat's exactly what I mean. We can't only rely on the words of the suspect, after all. We may have figured out where he was and what he was doing all night... ...but the blood-stained Samurai Sword that was left at the crime scene... As long as there is no satisfactory explanation for that... ...this wolf will refuse to ease up on his bite!\nLarry:\nEeeeeek! Edgey! That guy... He looks like he's seriously about to take a bite out of me!\nEdgeworth:\nI'm well aware. And you should be as well, that this upcoming battle will be crucial.\nLang:\nThanks to the cooperation of our lovely bumbler... ...I've been dealt a very nice hand, and a sweet trump card. Looks like we're about to enter the final bout! Now, Mr. Prosecutor! Let's see what you've got!\nEdgeworth:\n(I can easily point out the contradiction in the supposed \"murder weapon\"... ...but the real problem for me is figuring out what the real murder weapon is. This will be a high-stakes gamble! But this is one game I can't afford to lose!)\nArgument\n-- Why Larry? --\nLang:\nI was the one who found the body of the victim, DeMasque II.\nBeside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood.\nIt was supposed to be in the Steel Samurai's dressing room, but I found it here instead.\nPlus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too.\nEdgeworth:\nIsn't it a bit far-fetched to accuse someone simply on the basis of ownership?\nLang:\nBut this owner wanted to sneak onto the crime scene. I think that's plenty to go on, don't you?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're alluding to his reason for being by the chimney, we've already established that!\nLang:\nLang:\nHold on there, Mr. Prosecutor. You two are long-time friends, right? Who's to say you didn't fabricate the evidence to give him an alibi?\nEdgeworth:\n.........You're accusing me of fabricating evidence?\nLang:\nYou think I can believe anything you produce? Forging evidence is all you prosecutors do!\nEdgeworth:\n.........! (This man has some serious issues with prosecutors...)\nLarry:\nBut come on, I can't think up something as complicated as that! Right, Edgey!?\nEdgeworth:\nLarry, I can agree because I know you and your personality well. However, Agent Lang knows nothing about you... or me, for that matter. (I sense his hatred for my entire profession emanating from his entire being. Meaning that the only way I can prove Larry's innocence is to present irrefutable evidence.)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were the first to discover the body this time... Lang: \"This time\"...? What's that supposed to mean!? You'd better watch what you say! Edgeworth: I only said \"this time\" because earlier, Kay was the first to discover the body in Babahl... ...and your secretary, Agent Shih-na, was ready to accuse her of murder for that. Lang: Lang: Hah! So are you going to use that excuse to call me \"suspicious\" now? Edgeworth: Of course not; I was simply pointing out the usual pattern with discoverers of bodies. Lang: But in the Babahlese case, there was proof that she was holding the weapon, right? Well, in this one, it's a bit different, since we know exactly where the weapon is.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Excuse me, but \"glittering red and offering up the scent of blood\"...? Lang: Do I have to spell it out for you? I mean the sight and smell of blood, of course! And according to the tests, the blood on the sword belongs to the victim. The sword was made to only be used on stage, so it's not sharp. But it is pretty weighty. It's certainly heavy enough to beat someone to death with. Which leads me to suspect that the victim was beaten to death with the sword. Edgeworth: Beaten to death, huh? (This last statement is too important to just let it slip by.) Changes statement from \"Beside him was the Samurai Sword... glittering red, and offering up the scent of blood.\" to \"Beside him was the Samurai Sword... covered in the victim's blood.\" Adds statement \"I suspect he beat the victim to death with that thing.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So the sword is covered in the victim's blood...? Lang: Yeah, the lab results confirm that the blood on the sword matches the victim's. But the sword is as dull as a vanilla envelope. It's just a stage prop, after all. Larry: The Steel Samurai is all about \"Safety First\"! So you can't use it like a real sword! Edgeworth: The Steel Samurai has spoken. Oldbag: .................. Franziska: The Pink Princess also appears to have something she'd like to petition to you personally. Edgeworth: ...Wh-What the Pink Princess would like to say can wait for the day after eternity! Lang: Anyway, my point is that even though the sword is too dull to slice with... ...it's certainly heavy enough to bludgeon someone to death with. Therefore...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: About this Samurai Sword... Have you received a report from forensics yet? Lang: They confirmed that the blood on the sword belongs to the victim. Edgeworth: Alright, but have they confirmed that the outline of his wound is consistent with the weapon? Lang: Tell me something... Do you see the dead body right there in front of you? So! If they were conducting the autopsy right now, shouldn't that body not be here!? Well!? Edgeworth: Hmph... I suppose so. (I guess they must still be investigating this room. Meaning that it's possible he doesn't know about that piece of evidence's true nature.) Lang: Anything else you'd like to chit-chat about? No? Good. Now let's continue.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Larry has already testified that he forgot the Samurai Sword here... Larry: Yeah! I was shaking hands with the ambassador in here, and I left it behind by accident! Lang: Lang: So what? You lied earlier, so who's to say that this excuse isn't just another lie? Larry: But I forget stuff all the time! Right, Edgey!? Tell him! Edgeworth: ...Why don't you tell him yourself!? Franziska: You see? What did I tell you earlier? No one will buy such a pathetically weak excuse. Edgeworth: Yes, well... I know that it's not possible to prove such an excuse as truth... Lang: And yet you offer it up as fact!? You're a worse person than I originally thought. Edgeworth: You are free to think what you'd like, however, I know that Larry is not the killer. Agent Lang, please continue with your argument. I'll expose the flaw in it soon enough!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Just because he is the owner of the weapon, therefore he must be the killer, is it? Lang: No. Climbing all the way up to the chimney is plenty suspicious in my book as well. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Regarding that, I have already drawn the truth out, and the truth is one thing I don't bend. Lang: Lang: It doesn't matter if it's you or whoever. You prosecutors are all the same. And as for me, prosecutors are the one thing I don't trust in! Franziska: Franziska: An agent who doesn't trust prosecutors? What are you playing at? Lang: ...Sorry, sis. But there are only two things I trust: my subordinates and evidence at the crime scene. Edgeworth: (Agent Lang hates prosecutors. But as long as he trusts evidence that has been left at a crime scene... ...then there IS something I can show him that he can believe in!)\nEdgeworth: (It's simply not possible that the Samurai Sword is the real murder weapon. So I should focus on proving that point to Agent Lang first.)",

So I should focus on proving that point to Agent Lang first.)\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know what this is, Agent Lang?\nLang:\nHeh, it's a long spear, right? We used to use those a lot in my country a long time ago. Piercing, mowing people down... Spears are the weapon of heroes throughout history.\nFranziska:\nIt's the next most effective weapon after the whip.\nEdgeworth:\n(I think the whip is in a slightly different category...)\nLang:\nSo, what's your point? Are you going to tell me that the spear is the real weapon?\nEdgeworth:\nNo. I simply want you to take a look at this section here.\nLang:\nThe way it's bent...?\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. Apparently, a certain troublemaker hit it against a wall in this embassy earlier. And as you can clearly see, the insides of the Steel Samurai's weapons are hollow. In other words, they're replicas that aren't strong enough to deliver a damaging blow... ...let alone the multiple strikes necessary to bludgeon someone to death. And yet, there is not even a dent in the Samurai Sword. How do you explain that!?\nLang:\nA...Aiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\nLarry:\nOh, yeah... The sword and the spear are made of the same stuff, so they bend easily! But I wish they'd make them out of better stuff! Because the spear got bent... ...I wasn't able to do my special \"Early Summer Rain Jab!\" move! Man, I got such an earful from the director of the play for not doing it in the show!\nEdgeworth:\n(The Steel Samurai's special move was changed tonight because of him...!?)\nSamurai Spear data updated in my Organizer.\nLarry:\nYeoooooooooowch!\nFranziska:\nThat's more than enough of your whiny whimpering! Now... back on the topic of the spear.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, let's return to the real topic of discussion. (This is where the real gamble begins. I don't have a real strategy, per se... ...so all I can do for now is let the chips fall where they may.)\nFranziska:\nUsing guesswork and taking risks in place of real logic is hardly the Von Karma way. It's neither smart nor very clever.\nEdgeworth:\nMs. von Karma, as you know, unlike your father, I am not a genius prosecutor. Plus, I doubt his record of a 40-year win streak will ever be broken.\nFranziska:\n..................\nEdgeworth:\nBut perhaps, it is for the best if it remains unbroken. For no one should've conceived of the notion to \"convict all defendants\" in the first place!\nFranziska:\nFranziska:\nWhat a foolishly foolish statement from a foolish fool who hates to lose... It's the job of a prosecutor to make sure that all defendants are found guilty in court. There is nothing more important in this world than a perfect victory!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThat may be your opinion, however, I don't believe that's all we are.\nLang:\n.........!\nEdgeworth:\nAs a prosecutor, what I pursue is not the perfect victory, but the perfect truth. And if that means that the bridge I must cross will crumble beneath my feet... ...then let it crumble as I walk on towards the truth!\nLang:\nLang:\nYou're good at keeping me entertained, Mr. Prosecutor! But you know... humans are delicate creatures. The slightest bump and we expire. I'd like you to consider, if you will, the possibility that... ...the sword was used in such a way that the attack killed DeMasque II without bending it.\nEdgeworth:\n..................\nLang:\nSo, what do you think of my hypothetical scenario? I think you know what to do here, right? And what you need!\nEdgeworth:\nOf course. (What I need is evidence even he (changed from [Agent Lang] in the original release) can't refute! This is it! It's time to bring this to a close!)\nArgument\n-- Why Larry? Pt. 2 --\nLang:\nIt's possible to use the Samurai Sword to kill someone.\nAnd under these circumstances, it's the only logical conclusion.\nWe searched the Embassy, top to bottom, but the victim's blood is only on that weapon.\nSo isn't it only natural that suspicion would fall onto the owner of said weapon?\nEdgeworth:\nHow long do you intend to cling onto that preposterous theory?\nLang:\nAs long as I want, because we examined every corner within the walls of this Embassy. There's no stone we've left unturned! And we have managed to come up with only one logical conclusion! That the only place inside this embassy with the victim's blood on it is this sword.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYou left no stone unturned? Is that a fact?\nLang:\nLang:\nIf you've got something to say, then say it in the only way I respect, Mr. Prosecutor!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, of course. In that case, allow me to make it all crystal clear for you!\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: May I inquire as to how are you able to make such a claim, Agent Lang? Lang: Lang Zi says: \"Capable of miracles beyond comprehension, a mysterious creature is man.\" Edgeworth: (...Rather than man, it's Agent Lang's quotes that are getting increasingly incomprehensible.) Lang: The human body is a mysterious thing. Even with a toy-like sword... ...it's easy to kill a man if you hit just the right spot. Which is why I think it's possible to kill with this thing without leaving a dent. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: But we can only be sure one way or the other by seeing if the wound matches the sword! Lang: Hmph, I know that. But as long as it's a possibility, I can proclaim it as much as I'd like.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: But you must know that your conclusion is wrong! Lang: Given the circumstance I'm in, the only people I can trust are my subordinates. Because they're a much more trustworthy bunch than you prosecutors will ever be. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Are you call yourself a professional...!? Lang: Lang: You still don't see, do you, Mr. Prosecutor? You have to earn my trust. And the only way to do that is to show me proof of another possible murder weapon! Edgeworth: (Another possible weapon... In this room, there is only one other thing left... This is going to be a gamble, but I can't withdraw from the game now!) Lang: You're not going to get me to trust you by the power of your glare alone, you know. Plus, I have other reasons as to why I think the Samurai Sword is the murder weapon!\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: The only place where you could find blood was on the Samurai Sword...? Lang: That's right. Even with Luminol. Which means that there are no other possibilities outside of what I've already outlined. Edgeworth: (Do I have a problem with Agent Lang's assertion that the Samurai Sword is the weapon?) Raise an objection Leads to: \"If you believe that there is no other door of possibility left to open...\" Don't raise an objection Edgeworth: (Hmm... Perhaps I should wait and see how this plays out for a bit longer.) Agent Lang, if you could be so kind as to continue with your testimony... Lang: Hrmph! Leads back to rebuttal Leads to: \"If you believe that there is no other door of possibility left to open...\" Edgeworth: (Hmm... Perhaps I should wait and see how this plays out for a bit longer.) Agent Lang, if you could be so kind as to continue with your testimony... Lang: Hrmph! Leads back to rebuttal\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: And what if you were to find a different murder weapon? Would that clear Larry's name? Lang: Lang: Are you saying you can prove the possibility? Edgeworth: Of course. And if you don't believe that I can... ...then I'll show you something to convince you; evidence that you cannot refute! Lang: .........Hah! Ha ha ha ha ha! Sounds like fun, Mr. Prosecutor! Alright then, go ahead and show me what you've got!\nEdgeworth: ...I can prove to you... the possibility that the murder weapon is something else... ...but I cannot do so on my strength alone.\nFranziska:\nFranziska: Miles Edgeworth. What are you running straight into a quagmire for? I thought you said that you were busy in pursuit of the perfect truth. And if that's the case, then show me this perfect truth, if it exists at all!\nEdgeworth: Don't worry. Thanks to you, I've already prepared myself to do just that.\nFranziska: There's no need to thank me. I'm simply doing what any good superior would.\nEdgeworth: Heh... I suppose you are. Very well, then. I will show you the possibility of a different murder weapon.",
